THE SECRET OF THE
SARGASSO
PROLOGUE
THE COSMOPOLITES
An impenetrable darkness lay over the ocean, and,
hidden in its folds, with carefully-screened lights,
a steamer rested almost motionless. Any one
acquainted with the science of marine architecture
would have glanced twice at the vessel, although
to the untrained eye there was nothing unusual
about her, except, perhaps, her great length in
proportion to her breadth, and her peculiar posi-
tion in the water. The expert, however, would
have wanted to know where in the slender hull
engines to develop the speed her lines suggested
had been placed ; why she lay so heavily, seeing
that she could not possibly be a cargo vessel,
and why her deck resembled that of a torpedo-
boat-destroyer more than anything else, and yet
was surmounted by only one very insignificant -
looking funnel. He would have wondered still
more had he seen her interior.


Down in her long, narrow, but comfortably fur-
nished and well-lit saloon, a score of men sat,
deep in some discussion. They were not ordinary
men, as the intellectual expression on their
strongly-marked faces showed, but it would have
taken a real cosmopolitan to tell their various
nationalities. And such was their Chief. He sat
at one end of the long central table and listened
to what each man had to say, supplying a word in
English sometimes, for the benefit of the assembly,
when some speaker, in order to express himself
thoroughly, had to call in a word of his native
tongue. He was certainly a man who would
attract attention in any company. Five feet eleven
in height, he was ? proportionately built ; but it
was his face that marked him as chief wherever he
was. His was a face such as is rarely seen.
Determination and force of character were evident
in the straight mouth, well-formed chin, and cold
grey eyes, but intellectuality had also expressed
itself in the lofty forehead, distance between
the eyes, and in the many ways which mark a
genius.
? Well, comrades,? he said, after all had spoken,
? everything comes to an end, and to-night brings
about the dissolution of the Cosmopolites. It is
now six years since we formed, and we have reason
to feel well pleased with ourselves. We have done
nothing of which we need be ashamed, yet we have
amassed sufficient wealth to enable each member
to go on in his own way developing the special
talents with which nature has endowed him. I
can?t help some regrets, however, for we have been
very happy together, and it was our wonderful
combination that helped us to carry through our


most daring schemes and ventures. However, a
fair divide has been made, and to-night we?ll dis-
guise the Lucifer for the last time and sail into
some convenient port on the Clyde. By our
arrangements, the Lucifer remains mine, so after
some time has passed I will let her be seen openly,
and give out that she is an experiment I am
making in marine architecture. Should at any
time any of the Cosmopolites tire of life on shore,
they will always find a welcome with their old
Chief. Gentlemen, I have finished.?
The Chief sat down, and the men looked at
each other curiously, but in silence.
? But why should we allow ourselves to be
broken up? ? suddenly asked one of the men with
a slightly German accent. ?We are now a perfect
working combination, and better able than ever
before to do great things. We are not com-
pelled to disband unless we wish ?
? And I for one dinna like to say goodbye to
ma bonnie wee engines,? put in another, in a voice
that proclaimed his Scotch nationality.
? I have not yet ze words of Inglish so well to
say my thinks,? began another.
? Speak in French, then,? interrupted the Chief,
? and I will translate.?
? Not so,? cried a Japanese. ? Every man must
talk the language that we have made common or
we will soon be as bad as we were at first ?
? I vote we bind ourselves for another five
years,? moved a tall Russian, in excellent
English. ? See what we can do now. We can
make every ship that sails pay toll ; we can disable
vessels and then take them into port as salvage.
We can trade and make profits out of our know-


ledge of the world?s markets and our ability to
influence them. We can ?
? Oh, shut up, Glasowhisky,? growled the Scot.
? We had far better turn honest pirates and hang
out the skull and crossbones at once.?
1 have one good idea,? suddenly remarked a
man of Spanish cast of features ; ? let us go
rounda de world and buy silver where it is cheap
and then sail away and make it into money of
countries whose coins are worth more than de
silver ?
?What say you, sir? ? ?the German who had
first spoken looked at the Chief inquiringly.
? The world is before us. We can be a power
in it ?
?Is it not a pity that there is a tendency in
most races to abuse power when they get it,?
spoke the Chief. ? There, you now, for instance,
Hassenrahn. When I first knew you, you were a
scientist whose whole existence seemed bent on
doing good to humanity, and now you are calmly
proposing, or at least agreeing to a proposal, that
we should turn our unique abilities to the trade
of piracy, and transform the Lucifer into a floating
counterfeiter?s den.?
? But, sir, look at the possibilities. We need
fear nothing. We are ?
? Developing into a set of scientific cut-throats,
Hassenrahn, and that is really my chief reason for
insisting upon disbandment. If we could devote
ourselves to the carrying out of any scheme
whereby we would be doing some good as well as
making a fair profit, I shouldn?t stand in the way ;
but, frankly, I don?t believe that that is possible
now, and it is to prevent the brain machine, which


as yet I control in you, gentlemen, from becoming
a pest to the world that we split up to-night.?
? But we can simply form again,? put in the
German, eyeing the Chief closely.
? That may be,? replied the latter, ? but you
will be harmless without the Lucifer , and, as you
are aware, Mac and I alone possess some very
essential secrets of her driving power.?
? But we can have the Lucifer , too,? cried a man
from the far end of the table.
??You err in saying so, Signor Antonio. The
ship is mine by the terms of our contract, and I
have no intention of allowing her to become an
ocean parasite ?
? But, sir,? persisted Hassenrahn, who had been
talking to those near him in low terms while the
Russian and the Italian had been speaking to the
Chief, ? with, say, half a dozen Lucifers we could
dictate to any Power and practically put an
end to war. Surely that is an object worthy of the
Cosmopolites.? There was just the suspicion of a
change in the German?s voice, but the Chief
noticed it.
? Sit down, Hassenrahn,? he said sternly ; ??sit
down at once and place your hands on the table.?
The Chief did not move in any way while he spoke,
nor did he make any apparent sign that he
possessed the power of enforcing his order.
Nevertheless, the German obeyed, and the men
became sullenly silent. ?? Nice people we would be
to keep the peace of the world,? the Chief con-
tinued ; ??l can imagine no greater calamity over-
taking mankind than an organised band of clever
but soulless men having the control of the world.
Gentlemen, in ten minutes I expect you to be at


your respective stations to disguise the ship for the
last time. Rig up another funnel, mount the false
decks, and get the hull sheaths ready for lowering.
Macpherson, you will be ready to start your engines
when you receive the signal. Marquis, you may
resume your duties in the steering chamber. Set
a course for the Mull of Kintyre, but look out for
the Anchor liner Caledonia. We should run into
her tracks off Rathlin Island. We are in 7 west
by 56 north now.?
Both the Scot and the Japanese rose without a
word and left the saloon to attend to their duties,
and, glancing round on the others, the Chief cried ;
? Comrades, our next meeting in council will be in
the Hotel Victoria, London, at the usual time. We
can then compare notes.? He walked carelessly
from the room and closed the door after him.
? What a temptation,? he muttered. ? Here am
I in absolute command of the finest combination of
brains and skill in the entire world. What might
I not do? It is as I feared, however. So long as
they could only w'ork in concert through the
medium of a Chief they were easily controlled.
They did not know their own power. If only I
could have kept them from acquiring a knowledge
of English all might have been well ; but then,
I suppose, brains like those of the Cosmopolites
would soon have evolved a common language for
themselves. How is it that that which is wrong is
always the most attractive to most men? By Jove !
what an inferno would be let loose if Hassenrahn
and a few others had their way. I suppose it
would be safer for me simply to resign and leave
them. No, I?ll play the game through.? He
opened a door and entered a large apartment fitted


up as a laboratory and through which passed a
series of tubes not unlike large steam pipes. These
tubes seemed to be connected with a boiler-shaped
affair, and from the bubbling sound that issued in
a subdued manner from this contrivance it was
evident that some sort of chemical action was pro-
ceeding inside. But the Chief?s carelessness had
now gone, and he moved from one valve to another
as if much depended upon his speed.
? Ah, well, I rather fancy the Lucifer has lost
the blue ribbon of the ocean now,? he spoke, dis-
connecting two huge cables from terminals fixed
in ebonite plugs, which in turn were mounted upon
one of the tubes just where it passed into the large
cylindrical receiver. She can still draw her gas
through ; but without that wonderful liquid hydro-
carbon compound of Mac?s, which I have now shut
off, she will at least drop a few knots. Now to
destroy the liquid itself so that Hassenrahn may
not be able to analyse it.? He opened a valve at
the base of the great central tank, and about two
gallons of a dense whitish fluid ran out into a
trough underneath. He then dropped the ends of
the cables he had previously connected from the
tubes overhead into the fluid. A vivid flash of light
followed and a peculiarly smelling vapour filled
the apartment, upon which the Chief at once started
an electric fan and blew the mist-cloud through the
open portholes. In a few seconds nothing re-
mained, and turning round, well pleased with his
work, the Chief beheld Hassenrahn standing in
the open doorway, an evil smile upon his otherwise
handsome face.
? AII is now read 7> sir,? he said, with an exagge-
rated salute. Will you give the order to start? ?


? How dare you come to this room without per-
mission, sir? ? spoke the Chief angrily. ? You
know that no one is allowed here ?
? I beg your pardon, sir, Hut as the men have
decided that when this ship begins to move again
I am to be the Chief, not you, I am therefore
naturally anxious that she should start without
delay. All the men are at their post and she is
already disguised ?
? Indeed ; then I conclude you mean to land me
somewhere and steal my ship? ?
? You are only partly correct in your surmises,
my Chief. We do not intend to land you.?
? What ! ?
??As I have said. You have been our Chief
from the beginning, and we have decided that at
least you will be our guest until we have made your
name famous ?ah, pardon ! The English language
is so delicate that I sometimes make a mistake.
Perhaps the word notorious expresses the idea
better ?
?You insolent scoundrel. I?ll ?
? What ! Is my Chief losing command of his
temper? Really, it is time a man who cannot
control himself should have the command of others
taken from him. Ah ! ? The Chief had
sprung upon him and thrown him head first along
the alley.
? This vessel is mine, sir,? the Chief said as the
German sat up slowly, ? and while on board I shall
take insolence from no one.? He pressed the
button of an electric push, mounted with several
other switches on a frame in the laboratory.
? Now,? he continued, ? I have given the order to
start, and the man who disobeys me in any way

will have reason to regret it. Get up and go to
your post. I shall talk to you later about this.?
The German arose. ??My Chief,? he said,
quietly, lam indebted to you for reminding me
in this practical manner that sometimes brute
strength provides an effective method of dealing
with refractory people. I shall remember it. You
took me unawares that time though, so perhaps the
next time we obey our animal instincts I may repay
you.? He bowed and turned away. At the same
moment several men, who apparently had been
awaiting his signal, burst from an adjoining alley
and threw themselves upon the Chief, bearing him
back into the laboratory again.
Be careful, men,? Hassenrahn cried coming
back, ?we must not harm him.? A revolver
flashed in the Chief?s hand, and three shots rang
out. ? Mac !? he cried ; ? Mac ! Marquis ! ?
I hafa no lika for this,? growled one of the
men who had been shot ; ?me see how you lika
knife between your ribs.? He rushed at the Chief
again, and once more the Chief?s revolver spoke,
but the man on falling fell forward and his knife
gashed the Chief?s coat before it dropped from his
hands, and a crimson stream rushing forth showed
that more than the coat had suffered. But now
the place was alive with men, and shouts and curses
?*\ l * he lan S ua ffes of Europe, and half of Asia,
filled the air. Evidently the Chief had some sup-
porters, and, taking in the situation at once
they started to help him to the best of their
ability.
And now, down in the heart of that mysterious
ship, as she drifted erratically on the Atlantic
ucean, pandemonium reigned. A huge Polish
2


mechanic, armed with a crowbar, knocked down
two men who were standing over the Chief, and
a little Japanese wriggled through a mob of yelling
humanity until he also gained the Chief s side. A
slimly-built Frenchman, who had made his name
as a scientist, but who certainly was of little use
in a fight, attacked half a dozen of his comrades
in the rear ; and an American, who seemed to be
as much at home in such a battle as was now being
waged as he had been while teaching science
classes in Boston, his last occupation, fought any
and every man who barred his progress towards
the Chief. ? I guess I don?t care a cent whether
we turn pirates or not,? he remarked casually as
he yanked a burly German off his feet and threw
him into a corner, ? but may I never see a gin-fiz
again if I don?t smash a few mongrel heads for the
everlasting glory of the Anglo-Saxon race, and a
few more for the Chief himself for being a white
man clean through.? He had accounted for two
or three of the Cosmopolites while speaking, but
just as he concluded an Italian struck at him from
behind with a ferocious-looking knife, and Ted B.
Perry, from Boston, went down for the time being.
Meanwhile Hassenrahn was doing his best to
stop the fight, but the men, so accustomed to keep-
ing their passion subservient to their intellect, were
now indulging in what to them was a new sensa-
tion, and they enjoyed it too much to stop for
any man.
But they did stop, notwithstanding, and that
suddenly.
? What?s a? the row aboot? ? a voice demanded,
and Mac, who was supposed to be on duty in the
engine-room appeared. He trailed behind him


two long flexible rubber-covered cables, which he
stretched out as he advanced. The ends were
bared, and vivid flashes flew between them when
he allowed them to approach each other
? Go back to your station at once ! ? roared
Hassenrahn, as he saw the burly Scot. The others
paused. Mac?s plan was obvious to all.
? Just baud on a wee, Germany,? Mac retorted ;
? you?re only second-in-command on this ship, an
even that is only because the Chief doesna think it
fair for Cosmopolitans like us to hae twa o ain
country as first an? second. Noo, if the Chief
canna speak for himself I?m hanged, but I?ll fecht
you for the boss?s job.?
? Come on, Scottie,? shouted the Frenchman,
who was fighting for the Chief, we vill conquer
them all. They are pigs. Bah ! they are women.
They all fight the Chief not at different times ?
??Then I?m the Lord High Executioner,? sang
out Mac, advancing with his sparking cables.
? The other ends o? these wires are connected wi?
the big dynamos in the engine-room, an? it?s
runnin?, an? the man that gets tickled wi? ma
sparkers will be a cinder in a second?
With a rush the men cleared away in all direc-
tions, and proudly Mac marched up to the door of
the Chief?s private control-room. The big Pole
and the Jap had also run at Mac?s approach.
Their English was not equal to the task of explain-
ing their position, and they knew that Mac was
rough sometimes even with friends.
At this moment, too, relief came from another
quarter, and just as Mac closed the door and lifted
the Chief tenderly in his strong arms Hassenrahn
shouted out : ? Leave them alone in the mean-


time, boys ; here is a big liner bearing down on us.
We?ll have to get out of the way.?
On hearing this the men ran to their various
posts, and Hassenrahn sent a couple of engineers
into the engine-room, entering the steering-room
beside Marquis Ikato, their best navigator, himself.
? Man, hoo did ye no? keep me wi? ye, Chief? ?
murmured Mac, unbuttoning the Chief?s garments
to see the extent of the wound. ?Ye ken ye can
never trust a Dago if he?s behind ye ?
? Don?t worry, Mac,? said the Chief lightly,
standing up ; ?I am not nearly so bad as I look.
See that that door is shut safely, and give me your
best attention for a minute or two.?
? It?s shut all right, Chief ; in fact, we?re
locked in. They?ve trapped us after all. We?ll
need to invent some new strategy ?
? That is already done, Mac ; but listen. We
can?t fight the crowd on board this ship ourselves.
Nor yet can we allow the Lucifer to become a
pirate ship ?
?Your plan, then, Chief? Hoo are we to dae
anything? ?
? Why did you not start the engines when I
signalled? ?
? I never got any signal. That?s why I came
round here. You said to be ready in ten minutes,
an? when that time passed an? I heard the noise
I suspected something was wrong an? came here
to see ?
? Then they have disconnected the wires. No,
Mac ! Look there ! I forgot I did so myself.
They can?t start now until we allow them. All
the connections pass through this room.?
?Ay, I hear the engineers swearing in two or


three different languages already. We will have
a visit from Hassenrahn as soon as he hears the
news, but we can haud oot until that liner gets
alongside.?
? And then be the means of making the Cosmo-
polites commit their first lawless act. No, Mac,
that would simply precipitate matters, and we
would not alter our own position. By to-morrow
every fast cruiser in the Home Fleet would be after
us ?
? But they couldn?t catch us.?
? Mac, I believe you would as soon turn pirate
as not.?
?I?m no? concerned either way ; but I hear
Hassenrahn coming. He?ll be wanting to com-
promise ?
? And we?ll agree.?
? What ! Agree to come to terms wi? that
greasy German. I?d sooner gang through that
porthole.?
?Just what we are going to do. It is the Anchor
liner Caledonia that is coming up just now. I
know her captain very well, and, suspecting what
would happen to-night, sent him a Marconigram
early in the evening to look out for a drifting boat
when near Rathlin Island.?
?Then, what is she doing up here? She is a
long way north of her course.?
? Not at all, Mac. We are directly in her
proper course now. I said 7 west by 56 north
to-night purposely to mislead the others. Only
the Marquis knows, and he is staunch to me,
although he doesn?t care what he does otherwise.
Ah 1 there?s Hassenrahn at the door. Throw all
these chemicals and instruments into the sea while
I talk to him.?


? I have something of great importance to say,
sir,? cried the German at the outside of the door.
? Then say it and clear out,? answered the
Chief.
? There is a large steamer bearing straight
down upon us, and, as you have control of the
Lucifer's power in there, we can?t get out of her
way. We don?t care much ourselves, for we have
decided to make war against mankind, and may
as well start by robbing this vessel ; but as we
would prefer to get further away from the British
Home Fleet before commencing business, perhaps
you will see your way to allowing us to do so.?
? If I refuse? ?
? Then we shall attack the vessel, and the proba-
bilities are that you ?our Chief ?and our Articles
of Association will be left on its deck ; and you
know what that means.?
? Yes, I have a fair idea ; and if I turn on the
power? ?
? Then we?ll sail out into the ocean and consider
what our future business will be. When you care
to fall in with the views of the majority you will
be made Chief again ; but, of course, until then
you must be confined where you are. Your
answer? Quick ! We have no time.?
? One moment only ? The Chief turned to
Mac. ? Mac, drop through that porthole and cut
out the dinghy you will find tied at the stern.
I got it lowered this evening. I shall follow you
in a few minutes ?-
? What are you talking about in there? It
doesn?t seem to be about the question under dis-
cussion, and the steamer is almost alongside.?
? You are too nervous, Hassenrahn, to make a


on deck and tell the
due west. The Lucifer
good commander. Get
Marquis to set a course
is under power now.?
? All right, sir. Shall
I send a doctor to look
after your wound? ?
?No, never mind me.
Get the Lucifer out to
sea.?
further words went on
The German without
deck, and next minute the ship vibrated with the
motion of her powerful engines.
? Farewell, then, my Lucifer , for a time,
muttered the Chief, looking round the room affec-
tionately. ?At present you represent the highest
point of engineering science, and you are mine.
Perhaps another such as you may soon exist, and,
deprived of your great speed as you are now, I
hope by its aid to own you again.
He swung himself up to the porthole, and just
as the vessel began to gather a forward movement
dropped through into the ocean. The Caledonia
was almost alongside, and as the darkened and
disguised Lucifer shot into the night the Chief
caught Mac?s arm and a moment after was in the
little dinghy. A flare was then lit. A shout
arose from the decks of the Caledonia , and her
engine bell rang out ? Stop !
Shortly after two dropping figures stood in the
captain?s room, and the steamer proceeded towards
Glasgow. Meanwhile, the Lucifer raced westward
into the long Atlantic swell.




CHAPTER I
THE YOUNG ENGINEERS
? Then we are agreed? ? James Robertson
looked inquiringly at his two comrades, the light
of youthful enthusiasm shining in his eyes.
? Agreed as to what, Jim? ? asked Harry South-
wood ; ?I was not aware that we had been dis-
cussing any subjects except our discontent, and
the poor chances fellows like us have of ever
bettering ourselves.?
? Well, that is what I mean. Are we all agreed
that we wish to do something great? ?
? What is the use of talking, boys? ? said Bob
Fitzgerald, ?Of course we should like to alter
our position, but here we are in Glasgow, and in
this great city we?ll likely remain, unless the Clyde
ceases to be the home of shipbuilding and engi-
neering ; in which case I suppose we?ll grow old
in Belfast, or somewhere on the Tyne, or perhaps
have to emigrate to Germany to find work.?
? What a dismal old croaker you are, Bob I ?
laughed Harry ; ?no one would think you were
an Irishman from your talk. I thought your
people were always light-hearted.?
? Oh, that is all very well in a way, but I don?t
see how even an Irishman could shout with delight
35


at our prospects. We are all engineers, or, rather,
will be when our time is finished next year. Now,
there are thousands of other young people just as
smart as we are, and in any case the Clyde ship-
building yards are well supplied with managers
at present, so what chance have we of ever getting
out of the rut? ?
? That?s just what we met here to-day to dis-
cuss,? broke in Robertson. ?If we are content
to remain ordinary working engineers all our lives
then we need say no more, and I?ll look for some
other mates ; but if we are agreed that we mean
to make an attempt to do something great, then
we have taken the first step towards that end.?
? I don?t think you will have to look for new
mates, Jim,? said Southwood, quietly. ? Bob and
I are just as anxious as you to do something ; but
what can we do? We have no money, and we
cannot very well compel our employers to give
us more than the very fair wages we are earning
at present.?
? My idea was to form ourselves into a sort of
syndicate,? began Robertson. ? Combination, as
you know, is one secret of success. Then we
would discuss those things we three might possibly
do in which we should have at least chances as
good as any other people. Perseverance, oneness
of aim, and faith in ourselves will do the rest.?
? I understand,? said Fitzgerald, thoughtfully ;
? we?re to form a Trust, in which the capital will
be our brains, hands, and some files, chisels, and
hammers ?
? Don?t use the word trust,? interrupted South-
wood, ? it suggests shipping rings, beef factories,
and a lot of other things that the newspapers say


grind the people down somehow. And you might
have added a few more tools to our capital. Ive
got a good vice of my own, and I know Jim has
a very fine lot of other tools, not to mention that
wonderful almost perpetual motion model of his
at present on show in my uncle?s window in
Buchanan Street.?
? Keep to the point,? interrupted Robertson.
? Let?s start at the very beginning, and then move
ahead slowly, making everything secure as we go,
just as if we were erecting some big job in the
fitting shop.?
?Well, what?s first?? asked Southwood. ?I
am ready to start any scheme now.?
? Why, form our syndicate, of course,? replied
Robertson ; ? here is a sheet of paper upon which
we can draw up our Articles of Association
? What?s that, Jim? ?
? I don?t know, Harry, but it sounds all right.
Now, what shall we call ourselves? ?
Robertson took up a pen and waited for his com-
rades? suggestions.
? How would ? The Get Rich Quick Syndicate ?
do? ? asked Fitzgerald ; ?I saw that name some-
where lately ?
? It wouldn?t do at all,? broke in Robertson
sharply, ? this is to be a real working combine,
not a patent pill company.?
? But what are we to do? ? asked Southwood ;
? if we knew that we could easily find a name for
ourselves afterwards.?
? I have a copy of a prospectus of a soap-
making company here,? said Robertson ; ? I
thought we might go on its lines.?
?What, to make soap?? The speaker was
Fitzgerald.


?Oh, no! But listen and I?ll read: ?This
Company is formed to acquire land, build railways,
steamships, and motor-cars, and everything else
that may be deemed advisable by the directors for
the successful carrying on of a soap factory. Also
to obtain concessions of cocoanut-bearing islands
in the South Seas, to print and publish books, to
buy, sell, or otherwise acquire or dispose of pro-
perties that may from time to time appear to be
to the Companv?s advantage to deal with.
Furthermore ? ?
? Oh, stop, Jim. Those people want to run the
planet ?
? Nevertheless, Harry, I propose that we put
our names on this paper, and underneath write
out a copy of this soap people?s programme, leav-
ing out, of course, all mention of soap.?
? Hadn?t we better say something like this and
be done with it? ? said Fitzgerald?? * We, the
undersigned, James Robertson, of Glasgow, Scot-
land, and at present residing in that city ; Harry
South wood, of ? Where do you come from,
Harry? ?
? Liverpool. Hurry up.?
Harry Southwood, of Liverpool, at present
residing in Glasgow, and Robert Fitzgerald, of
Dublin, at present also of Glasgow, hereby give
notice to all whom it may concern ? ?
No, no, Bob, we are not writing a trespass
notice.?
? All right, cut out that last sentence and just
add the words, ? agree to form ourselves into a
company to do anything and everything, as may
be deemed advisable by the three of us at
a general meeting.? ?


? That certainly covers everything all right,?
mused Robertson ; ?it is a bit vague, though,
and I am not sure that the words are in proper
legal phraseology.?
? Hang legal phraseology ! ? cried Southwood ;
? we?re not going to have any dealings with law-
yers, and if the wording pleases ourselves I don?t
see that it matters whether it is correct or not.?
??Then we?ll let it stand,? said Robertson.
? Come on, boys, scratch out your names here.?
He rapidly wrote out the words Fitzgerald had
suggested, and then his three comrades subscribed
their names and the date.
? But we haven?t given ourselves a name after
all,? cried Fitzgerald, as they surveyed the com-
pleted agreement.
? Well, we can think out one any time and add
it in a postscript,? said Southwood ; ? let?s get
on with the important part of the business.?
? And here, Bob,? added Robertson, ? you are
the best writer. We had better each have a copy
of this document, so you might write out another
two, and we?ll all sign them. That will be equal
to a deed of co-partnery, and who knows what it
may not mean before very long? ?
? Oh, but Jim,? interjected Southwood, ? one
would think from your words that there were
millions at stake already, and that we three mates
were each trying to get the better of one another.?
? No, Harry, I trust we shall stick together,
no matter how we succeed. But I remember what
happened in the case of my father. He was the
real inventor of one or two things that became
very famous, but he was not a business man, and
had no agreement with his friend and partner who


provided the money to develop them. As a result
when that gentleman died his heirs contested my
father?s claim to his own inventions, and the law
upheld their claim.?
? And what happened? ? asked Fitzgerald, as he
finished writing the two copies.
? My father left me all the money he possessed
and went away broken-heartedly no one knows
where. He must be dead now, but that is why
I am so eager to see that everything between us
is in proper order. We may have to fight the
world before we are done or our partnership
breaks up. To ourselves we know we shall be true,
but who can say what other influence may come
amongst us? ?
? Here are the other papers, then, Jim,? said
Fitzgerald ; ? you have made me imagine that we
have got big things in hand already.?
?By Jove ! I feel that way myself now,? re-
marked Southwood. ? Boys, let us swear that no
matter what happens we shall stand by each other,
that our lives belong to our comrades, and that
no outside influence ?girls and the like ?will be
allowed to come between us until our compact is
broken up.?
?No, no,? cried Fitzgerald, ? you have spoiled
the thing by your last words. Let our compact
be for life.?
? Rather say, Bob,? Robertson smiled, ? our
compact is binding until any of us decide that
it is no longer a proper partnership. Then he
can simply hand in his paper to the other members,
who can go on with things or not, as they choose.
Let us add words to that effect on our papers so
that the dissenting man may not afterwards run


the other two into any troublesome affair or ex-
penses. There now, Harry, there is your copy of
our arrangement. That is the paper I wrote out
myself. Bob, you and I will each keep one of
those documents you have just finished. Gentle-
men, our compact is sealed.?
For a minute after Robertson had finished the
boys remained silent, then Southwood asked :
?Well, partners, what is our first move??
To get some money, to be sure,? answered
Fitzgerald ; ?we can?t move at all without that.?
? Unfortunately you are right, Fitz,? agreed
Robertson, ? we must get some money somehow.
I thought of allowing my model to be sold. Mr.
Southwood told me that he had had quite a number
of inquiries about it.?
? But that would give the patent away, Jim,?
said both boys, simultaneously.
? Well, we can?t help that, and we can easily
discover some other form of power.?
? I don?t like the idea at all,? said Southwood.
? Here you have discovered a most wonderful
method of driving an ordinary gas engine with a
small chunk of coal, or wood, or old boots, or
anything, and when once the engine starts it doesn?t
seem to want to stop, or need more fuel. Why,
the model in my uncle?s window has been running
for over a week, and no one has been near it.
And you calmly talk about selling it ! I?d rather
start and write stories for the magazines than you
should do that.?
? But > Harry,? remonstrated his comrade with
a smile, ? there is really not much in the affair.
Your uncle wanted some kind of motor to drive a
revolving table on which he might display jewel-


lery and such like. He could have got an electric
motor for the purpose without any trouble ; but,
having the little machine finished, I thought he
might just as well have the use of it. He would
buy it himself, I know, but I don t like the idea
of selling it to your uncle. He has always been
such a good friend to us all.?
? That is all very well, Jim, but the thing is
worth a lot of money. It is a real invention. If
the small model can work for a week on a pound
of coal, a large engine built on the same lines
would drive a boat across the Atlantic with at
least the saving of half the coal now used by
ordinary engines and turbines.?
? Well, we couldn?t build a large machine with-
out money, so we are back to where we started.
I think if we could get a few pounds for the model
from any one who is interested in it we could
devise something perhaps better. Of course you
know, boys, there is really something else con-
sumed in the affair besides coal. The coal pro-
vides the gas, but the gas is sucked through a tank
of a highly explosive fluid~as nearly picric acid
as my analysis can find out ?which I discovered
accidentally.? The gas thus impregnated has much
more explosive force than ordinary coal gas, but,
of course, the supply of the fluid has to be kept
up too. No, boys, it is by no means perpetual
motion ?
? But you can make the fluid? ? The speaker
was Fitzgerald. He was greatly excited. Evidently
some idea had just occurred to him.
? Oh yes, it is a comparatively simple matter.?
? Then let us advertise that we can increase the
power of any gas engine. We can then manu-


facture the fluid and sell it to whoever wants it,
for although they may analyse it, if they can?t
make it we don?t need to care.?
? I don?t think it can be made in any other
manner than in that which I discovered,? said
Robertson. ? But we?ve been sitting inside all
the afternoon. Let us go out for some fresh air.
We?ll be able to think better then.?
? By Jupiter, Jim,?- cried Southwood, ? I said
I would write stories, but I didn?t think I was
going to get such a splendid idea for one so soon.
I?ll start this very night, even although it is Satur-
day, and write about a terribly destructive new
power in the hands of three boys. I will tell how
they applied it to Atlantic liners, and broke all
ocean records with its aid the first try. Then I
will picture a war with Germany, and show the
German fleet beating our own ?
? Rot 1 ? interjected Fitzgerald, ? it couldn?t.?-
? Shut up a minute. It?s only for dramatic
effect, and ?there, I?ve lost the hang of the yarn,
and it?s all your fault, Fitz.?
? It couldn?t be much good if Germans were to
boss us.?
?Ha 1 I?ve got it again. Just as all is on the
point of being lost, a long black mysterious craft
will flash past the German flagship and send it to
the bottom with a well-aimed torpedo. It will be
out of sight before any of the other vessels can
fire at her, and then before they know where they
are it will come up again and sink another. Of
course, after this has gone on for some time the
remaining ships will surrender, and to the surprise
of the world, it will then transpire that three boys
only handled the terrible destroyer. We will make


a present of the German fleet to our King,
and ?
? Wake up and find it all a dream, and the
three boys pushing files, making red lead joints,
or hammering fiat cold chisels along the edge of
a steel plate.?
? You didn?t need to drop me so hard as that,
Fitzgerald. I had forgotten all about files and
chisels.?
? Come on, then, boys,? laughed Robertson,
? let us take the subway into the city and see how
the model is working.?
? And perhaps I?ll get some more ideas from
the people watching it,? said Southwood.
? I believe I?ll be seeing foreign spies and
pirates everywhere,? Fitzgerald said, as they went
into the street ; ? but I fancy we three partners
can look after ourselves, and I?ll bet a pair of
calipers we?ll be doing big things before long.?
The boys had been in Robertson?s rooms all
that Saturday afternoon. They lived in different
parts of the city, but spent all their spare time
together, usually in Robertson?s apartments or in
the open air, because the only Scotch member of
the trio was of a somewhat retiring disposition,
and did not feel entirely at his ease when visiting
his two comrades, each of whom lived with his
parents.
They walked to the nearest subway station, and
soon after alighted at St. Enoch?s, whence they
walked up Buchanan Street to the jeweller?s shop
in whose window the wonderful model gas engine
worked a show turntable. There was quite a
crowd of people around the large window. Some
were doubtless admiring the fine display of gems


and jewellery which the cunningly-placed electric
lights showed off to their best advantage, but the
majority?Glasgow being essentially an engineer-
ing city?were chiefly interested in the strange-
looking apparatus which occupied one corner of
the window, and which supplied the motion to the
large turntable by means of an endless belt. It
certainly did not look imposing, and but for the
moving belt might easily have escaped observa-
tion entirely. The whole affair seemed to consist
only of three vertical tubes about six inches long
and about one inch, or slightly more, in diameter,
and an ordinary model gas-engine. They were
all fitted together on an ornamental stand, and
took up almost no space. On the top of the first
tube a tiny hopper was fixed, and just disappearing
in it was a piece of coal. Nothing more was to
be seen, yet silently, smoothly, and swiftly the
little engine worked as if perpetual motion had
indeed been accomplished.
The boys stood on the outskirts of the crowd
and listened to the comments made by the
people.
? What do you think of it, Tom? ? one young
man, evidently a technical college student, asked
his companion, apparently, a practical engineer in
one of the shiphards.
? Nothing,? the latter individual answered, ?it?s
only a dodge to catch the eye. These tubes are
dummies, and the engine is worked by gas from
the mains. The boss of this shop knows what
will draw a Glasgow crowd.?
? But look at that piece of coal ; what is its
use? ?
? To make a fellow think that these tubes form


a suction gas plant. They can?t fool me with that
trick, though. I?ve been watching this machine
for a week, I see it morning and night, and the
difference in the coal supposed to be consumed
wouldn?t drive even that model for an hour.?
The two men passed on, and two other
mechanics who had been listening took up the
subject. ? What is this suction-gas, Jack? ? one
said ; ? every one is talking about suction-gas
now.?
? Ask me something easy, Andrew. It would
take a day to tell you in full, but in effect it is
gas made by the suction of an engine directly
connected to a generator containing burning coke,
coal, or any gas-yielding substance. The out-
stroke of the piston draws in air through the in-
candescent material used, which, when mixed with
superheated steam ?provided usually by the waste
heat of the fire ?forms a highly explosive gas.
To cut it short, it is an ingenious arrangement
invented by I don?t know whom, in which you
get practically the utmost calorific value from fuel
used direct, whereas in the steam engine you only
get a very small percentage, and indirectly.?
? Great Scott ! ? ejaculated Fitzgerald, as the
last speaker concluded, ? hear that fellow? He
must be a science lecturer. I wonder he didn?t
choke over his words.?
? No,? said Southwood, ? I know him ; he is
only an ordinary engineer over in an engine shop
in Govan ? A kick from Robertson made him
cease talking abruptly. Two gentlemen of the
upper class, judging from their appearance, were
now discussing the plant.
? Yes, it is very clever,? remarked one, and the

boys noted that he spoke in what to them seemed
a slightly German accent. ? I can?t see the use of
the third tube, though. What do you think,
Count? ?
? I am with you. I do not see where ze use is
of ze third tube,? responded his companion, and
the boys thought he spoke like a Frenchman.
? I can see the idea so far,? continued the first
speaker ; ??it is practically the same as what we
have ourselves. There is a fire kept under that
coal constantly by the suction of the engine, but
it seems to me it ought to have been consumed
since we first saw it. One of the other tubes, of
course, is merely used to cool and purify the gas,
but what the remaining one is for is beyond me.?
? It seems to me that it is ze same idea our old
Chief used, only he had ze oder tube in his own
room,? rejoined the Frenchman. ? Suppose we
go inside and inquire who the clevair inventor is? ?
? Yes > we cannot afford to miss any chance.
The Lucifer cannot now make the speed she had
at one time, and I know that that is because the
Chief destroyed some apparatus only he and Mac
knew of.?
The two men entered the shop, and the boys
turned to each other eagerly.
| What did I tell you? ? demanded Southwood.
? No, it was I who said we?d meet foreign
spies,? said Fitzgerald.
? Well, while you are settling the matter
between yourselves,? observed Robertson, ? I am
going inside to hear a little more of the invention
which I seem to have copied.?
? We?ll all go,? said Southwood ; ?my uncle is
never in the place on Saturday evenings, and none


of the men know us at all. Besides, I have to
buy some medals for our sports next Saturday,
and we, as the Committee, have a right to inspect
stock before we purchase.?
? In you go, and never mind,? spoke Fitzgerald ;
and next moment they were inside.
? We are the committee of the engineer appren-
tices? sports, and would like to look at some suit-
able prizes,? began Southwood boldly, as an
assistant came forward to attend them. He turned
his face away and disguised his voice as much as
possible, so that if the shopman had seen him
before he would not remember who he was.
? We?ll look round these cases ourselves,? put
in Robertson, ? and tell you what we have decided
upon afterwards.?
? Very well, gentlemen,? responded the assis-
tant, ? you?ll find all the prices marked in plain
figures, and, of course, there is a small discount
for sports prizes.? He turned to assist in attend-
ing to the wants of the two imposing-looking
strangers, and the boys became all ears.
? I would like to purchase a small present for
a young lady friend,? began the German, ? some-
thing original and not loud ?er, I do not mean
loud in the sense of making a noise, I mean ?
?confound your English ?
? I understand, sir,? put in the shopman, ? you
desire something tasteful and quiet, and ?
? Exactly, anything you like ?eh, quiet? Of
course, that was the word I wanted. Quiet means
not loud. Ha I Ha !
? Oh, ze clevaire Englis,? laughed the French-
man, ? you say quiet and loud, yet no one of him
speak at all.?


? The language is not to be compared with' the
French, sir, as a medium of delicate expression,?
said the man who had been attending to the boys.
??How would this suit your friend?? He lifted
a case containing a magnificent diamond ring and
handed it across the counter. ? This is only sixty
guineas ?
? Ah, yes, that will do ?but stay ?I noticed one
or two little things on that revolving table in the
window. Perhaps they ?
But the assistant had already gone to the win-
dow. It was not every day, even in Buchanan
Street, that people able to afford sixty guineas for
a simple little present, and who didn?t seem to
care whether they bought an engagement ring, or,
for that part, a gas engine, came into a shop, and
the man intended to make the most of his
opportunity.
?? Here are two rather nice little things, sir,?
he said, lifting a pearl necklet and a fire-flashing
opal brooch from the revolving table. ?They, as
doubtless you know, are very cheap at one hundred
guineas for the necklet, and eighty pounds ten
shillings for the brooch.?
? Off, I don?t mind the cost if I get what I want.
I?ll take that pearl thing But, dear me ! What
is that peculiar machine in your window? I did
not notice it before.?
? That is a show turntable, sir.?
? Yes, yes, I can see that ?but that little affair
that seems to be driving it. Those tubular
things? ?
? Oh, that? That is merely a model gas-plant,
sir. Some young engineer built it in his spare
time. Would you like to examine it closer, sir?
Just step behind, then, please.?


The German and his companion followed the
two assistants round behind the large window, and,
on a velvet background being removed, found
themselves standing over the silent but active
model.
Meanwhile the boys had been watching every
movement and drinking in every w r ord. The fact
that the strangers were spending a hundred
guineas on what they clearly did not want, merely
to see the model at close quarters, impressed them
greatly.
? There is a lot about this I don?t understand,?
Robertson whispered ; ? why couldn?t they have
simply asked to see the thing direct without all
this beating about? ?
? I?ll tell you, Jim,? replied Southwood. ? They
don?t want any one to know they are anxious.
They know what the secret of that model means,
and intend having it, I?ll bet my new centre-
punch.?
? Shut up 1 ? growled Fitzgerald ; ? listen ! ?
? It is wonderful ! ? exclaimed the Frenchman
enthusiastically. ?lamof ze engineer taste my-
self, but it is bettair than anything I know.?
? Just wrap up that necklet and brooch, will
you, while we are looking at this,? suddenly said
the German, turning to the younger assistant ; ?we
are pressed for time, but this interests us.?
?Are you taking both articles, sir?? inquired
the chief assistant, wondering if he were dealing
with one of the Rothschilds.
? Yes, I may as well have them. I suppose you
couldn?t disconnect that engine for a moment, just
to let us see the gas-producer itself? ?
? Jupiter ! Do you hear him? ? gasped South-
wood ; ? he?ll be asking to have it dissected next.?


? Well, sir,? said the somewhat startled assis-
tant, ? the engine has never stopped since it was
placed there by its maker ; but I feel sure that
Mr. Southwood, my employer, would not object
if he knew how the matter interested so good a
customer.?
? Oh, your employer will not be displeased.
There is my card. Tell him ?
? I beg your pardon, your Highness ? began
the flustered assistant as he gazed at the card.
? Hush ! No names. My friend and I are
travelling in what you English term incognito .
Show my card to your master only if necessary
Ah ! you have stopped the engine.?
? Surely, your Highness. Here is the whole
apparatus.? The man brought the frame of
vertical tubes from the window and placed it on
the counter, and the two foreigners bent over it
eagerly.
? What have we struck, boys? ? ejaculated Fitz-
gerald ; ? are they anarchists? ?
Shut up and we?ll soon know,? whispered
Robertson.
But they 11 find out all about the affair in no
time,? said Southwood.
? They can?t,? answered Robertson ; ? the
instant they stopped the engine all action in the
generator ceased, and the middle tube is rivetted
tight.?
? Ah, I see,? remarked the German, ? this is
a clever suction-gas arrangement, but can you ex-
plain it to us? How does it work, and where
does all the power come from? ?
? Well, sir?l beg pardon?your Highness, the
gas is generated by principles now fairly well


known in all civilised countries in this first tube ;
it is cooled and made pure in one of the others,
and thence drawn by the suction of the engine into
its cylinder, where it is exploded.?
? Wonderful I But there are three tubes here.
What does the third one do? ?
? That I cannot say, sir. I think it is useless
myself, but probably the engineer who built it
had some idea of his own about it.?
? I?ll bet a face-plate he had,? muttered South-
wood.
? But it is all so what you call dead now,?
observed the Frenchman. ??There is no gas
coming from ze engine pipe.?
?No, sir,? said the man, ? the gas is only gene-
rated while the engine is working.?
? I should really like to know the meaning of
the third tube,? continued the German ; ?it can?t
be of any use unless it is intended to add something
to the gas.?
? I don?t know, sir. The engineer who made
it put it in position here and said nothing about
it except that we were to let him know when it
stopped working, and he would start it again.?
? I see the last tube is rivetted while the first
two have ordinary screwed caps. Perhaps
ah ! ? The German bent over the machine and
applied his mouth to the pipe which had previously
been connected with the engine. ? Whew 1? he
cried suddenly, after sucking at the pipe, ? it?s
some sort of sweet acid that is in it, and the gas
is sucked through it. I believe I?ve got at the
secret of the Lucifer?s falling off now, Count, and
if only Valli can get the Chief and Mac to sample
his memory-destroying drug Ah ! I beg


pardon?; the idea of the model is so clever that I
became excited over it. Can you give me the
name and address of the inventor? ?
? I am very sorry, sir, that I can?t ; but Mr.
Southwood knows, and if you would care to call
in again on Monday I could have it for you.?
? On Monday I expect to be far from Scotland
?but I have a plan. Telephone or telegraph or
send a messenger to your master?s home, asking
for the name and address of the inventor, and then
send the information to me at the Central Hotel.
I shall wait for it. Ah, yes, one hundred guineas
and eighty pounds ten shillings. I am not well
skilled in calculating in your money, but I think
this will cover my purchases.?? He laid twenty
ten-pound notes on the counter.
? You get fourteen pounds ten shillings change,
sir?your Highness.?
??Do I? Well, keep it for yourself, and take
your best girl to the theatre. You?ll remember
to get the information I have asked for? ?
? I shall call at the Central myself, sir, within
an hour, with the name and address you require,?
gasped the assistant, startled and agreeably sur-
prised beyond measure at the windfall which had
so strangely befallen him.
The two foreigners left the shop, and both shop-
men turned to the prize-selecting committee.
Their intention was to hurry them from the shop
so that they could argue out their respective
shares in the plunder.
But the boys had gone.


CHAPTER II
valli?s work and its result
Seated at a corner table in the dining-room of
one of the great London hotels were two men.
They were just finishing an excellent dinner, and
had purposely refrained from conversing upon the
subject uppermost in their minds until they had
dined. But now the waiter brought on fruit and
dressed the table with an exquisite vase of flowers,
and feeling that they could properly talk at this
stage, one turned to the other and said : ? Well,
Mac, how do we stand now? I am sure I saw
Hassenrahn at the Club the other night, and his
presence can only mean that the Lucifer is some-
where around the British coast, and that our old
friends are on our tracks.?
??Do you think he recognised you, sir? ?
? Drop that, Mac. We are comrades, and there
must be no ceremony between us. Use my name.?
Mac laughed. ? I?m a bit of a socialist myself,?
he said, ? but we?ve got so used to discipline these
last six years that it seems natural to give you the
title of respect, an? any way I dinna ken your
name. You were just the Chief on board, an? ye
didna keep visiting cards.?
? Dear me ! I had forgotten that the men did


not know who I was. My name is Robert Howard.
There is a title tacked on somewhere, I believe,
but I did nothing for it, and I only use it when I
take the fancy to have a holiday among London
Society. Just call me ?
?I?ll just call ye the Chief, and that will save
trouble to both of us.?
? All right, then, Mac. And now that we?ve
introduced ourselves, let us get to business. I?ve
been fooling away the time since we took French
leave of the Lucifer , but I know you?ve been
working. Any result? ?
?Yes. You gave me a free hand to get a craft
built in which we could go after the Lucifer , an?
as no builders would build a boat to our specifica-
tions withoot lettin? a? the world ken, I took a
hint from the Government engineers. They built,
an? experimented wi?, fleein? machines up among
the Grampian Mountains, near a place called Blair
Atholl, so I found out a bonnie wee arm of the sea
near Oban, an? got a lot o? picked men frae
Glasgow, Belfast, and the Tyne shifted up there.
We worked night and day, and noo the hull is
almost feenished, an? the engines are in their place.
So we can start getting our accelerating power
ready any time.?
?Do you know, Mac, I?ll need you to help me
with that? You remember we burnt all our papers
and committed the formula to memory? Well,
while of course I haven?t forgotten that, I feel
strangely hazy about some part of the work. Now,
what did we do with all the stuff we had ready in
the Lucifer? ?
? Michty me, man I your memory is goin? all
to the mischief. Ye telt me yoursel? that ye elec-


trolysed it so that the other fellows wadna be able
to analyse it, but I?m thinkin? there?s mair than us
have tumbled on the idea. When passing doon
Buchanan Street, in Glasgow, yesterday, I saw a
model gas-engine working in a jeweller?s window,
an? I?ll bet it was the same idea as oors that was
driving it. But I feel awfu? heavy like ; I?ve got
a bit of a headache.?
?It is the heated room, Mac'; I feel the same
way myself. We?re not accustomed to being
cooped up in a town, however large it is, and
Ah I look over at the table next the orchestra.
Who is that little man? I know him well, and
yet I cannot recollect who he is.?
'_. m 1 I . 1
? Gracious I that?s Valli, the Greek, ane o the
band, an? as clever a wee deevil as ever missed
bangin?. What?s he doin? here, I wonder? He
canna be trackin? us, for he kens brawly that I
could eat him.?
? The beggar has a great nerve, at any rate.
He is not disguised in the slightest, and he must
know us and be aware that we have seen him.
Ah 1 he is actually smiling. Why, he is coming
over ! ?
?I?d rather meet Hassenrahn than the greasy
Greek,? muttered Mac. ?Ye never ken when
these hot-blooded folk are goin? to stick a knife
into ye.?
? There must be more of the Cosmopolites
about or he wouldn?t dare come near us.?
?Why not, Chief? The Cosmopolites are no
frichtened o? each other.?
? Mac, what do you mean? Have we not de-
clared war upon them? Don?t you remember
Now, what is it that you don?t remember? ?


? Good evening, my Chief,-? smiled the Greek,
coming up and standing by the table ; ? good
evening, friend Mac. What a beautiful blend of
colour you have in your flowers.?
? Ay,? said Mac, lifting one and smelling it ;
? I don?t remember what you call them, but they?ve
got a fine scent.?
Sit down, Valli,? spoke the Chief suddenly ;
why do you stand there? People will think you
are a waiter.?
? Veil, I have been a waiter in my time, Chief,
as veil as a good many other things. Don?t you
remember vere you picked me up first? ?
No, Valli, I don?t. You were a wonder-
ful Dear me I my memory is away com-
pletely. I know you were a specialist in something
or other on board the ?the Mac, what is the
matter with me? ?
Mac stood up and gazed around the room in
bewilderment. ? Chief,? he said, ?we were to do
something to-night, but I?ve forgotten what. I
think I?m mesmerised.?
Shall I explain vat is the matter, gentle-
men? ? said Valli, with a smile.
? I must have been poisoned !-? gasped the
Chief. ??Waiter ?
?No, you?re not poisoned, Chief,? Valli con-
tinued. ? Sit down and compose yourself so as
not to attract attention, and I vill tell you. It
vas a mistake, vaiter ;ve do not vish you ?
??l?ll wring your dirty neck, ye slithery reptile,
if ye talk to the Chief like that,? broke out Mac.'
? Vair veil,? the Greek laughed. ?You try,
friend Mac ; you vill find strong arms not always
the best way to harm do to any one. Bah ! you


are both fools to me. Yes, Valli, the Greek, laughs
at you. I have accomplished vat all the Cosmo-
polites together could not do. I have removed
your stings. Ha ! ha ! ?
? What is the fellow talking about, Mac? ?
? I don?t know. What were you saying, Valli? ?
?Listen! I vill tell. Your memory has de-
parted. Why? Because I have dropped the
shutters it over. No, do not cry out or move, or
you vill never know. You do not remember Valli?s
great discovery, and vy he, a poor vaiter, news-
paper-seller, thief, and gentleman, vas given a
full share vith all ze aristocrats like you, Chief,
and Hassenrahn and others? No? Then it vas
because he had found out how to take a man?s
memory from him, and as ve Cosmopolites do not
murder nor take vat ve cannot give, this discovery
vas great because people who might be able to
tell strange things about us, and whom ve vould
have to kill to save ourselves, could just be given
to Valli for five minutes and then allowed to go
free. He would then have only a dream of vat
happened, and people would at him laugh if he
told his foolish dream.?
? You are a magnificent liar, Valli,? inter-
rupted the Chief. ? You talk as if the Cosmopo-
lites had done many dark and strange deeds, and
as yet they have done absolutely nothing that
could not be done before the eyes of the whole
world.?
? Your memory again, Chief. It is over six
months since you disappeared from ze ship. You
forget vat ve did before that, and you do not know
vat has been done since.?
? Oh, your little game will soon be stopped.
We have ?have What have we, Mac? ?

To face page 48,




? A secret, but I dinna mind what it is.
? Bah ! your secret you have forgotten. That
is vat I vatch to mak you do. You took some power
avay from ze ship vich only you two knew. Vair
good. Now I take that power avay from you.
You do not know ze secret. Everything that is
past is just a dream to you, and if you believe
your dreams you will go mad in a veek, for ven
Valli throws a cloud over ze outer mind he gives
ze inner and dream mind a chance, and you vill
now dream for ever.?
? Get out, Valli, you are trying to hypnotise us,?
laughed the Chief. ? I feel all right now, and
Mac is just about to kick you out of the room.?
?Of course I have hypnotise you. You first
smell my wonderful powder which I put among
these flowers before the vaiter brought them to
this table. After, ven I see that all is working
veil, I come over and tell you so that the truth
vill sink into your brain, and you vill always
know that your memory is taken avay by Valli,
and never know ven you are not dreaming. Valli
vill now vish you good evening. He has other
work to-night to do. Your secret I Ha ! ha ! you
no secret have. You have von big foolish dream,
and only Valli can change it. Go and dream now,
and tell people of ze Cosmopolites and their von-
derful ship. Tell people of your secret power and
how to make it. Bah I go back and be schoolboys
again. You know nothing. Good night, mine
Chief ; good night, friend Mac. Valli bids you
fare veil.- With a laugh the Greek glided from
the table, and next moment passed through the
folding doors into the street.
As if under a spell, the Chief and Mac sat still


50 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
for a full minute after the creature had gone, but
rousing himself suddenly, the Chief said : Mac,
excuse me, the heat of the room has been too
much for me. I have actually been asleep.
?Have ye?? asked Mac, eyeing the Chief
closely.
?Well, I?ve been dreaming any way?a mixed-
up dream in which a horrible little Greek demon
called Valli played a large part.?
? He telt ye ye had lost your memory? ?
?He did, and, by Jupiter ! I feel as if I had.
What did we meet here for to-night? Dear me 1
I seem to be dreaming still of mysterious boats
and bands of lawless men. Why, Mac, have I
been ill? Where have I been 'this long time?
Why are we here? I thought?now, what did I
think? ?? The Chief buried his face in his hands,
and Mac, looking greatly puzzled, reached for
the vase of flowers. Gingerly he lifted a rose
from among them, and, with averted head, shook it
carefully over a corner of the table-cloth. A sus-
picion of a white powder seemed to fall from
among the petals, but even as Mac looked it
faded into the air. ?Ay, it?s true, I?m thinkin?,?
he muttered, then, signing to a waiter, he ordered
two glasses of brandy. ? Chief,? he then began,
? what you think was a dream was no dream.
We came here to-night for some purpose con-
nected with boats and engines, but just wait a
wee an? I?ll show you.?
The waiter now came with the brandy. None
for me, Mac,? said the Chief j I feel that
brandy would make me sick.
? I feel the same way, but it wasna for dr inkin?
purposes I ordered it. Chief. Just watch. He


carefully selected another rose and shook it into
one of the glasses. Instantly the contents became
a vivid green, and two or three faint bubbles burst
upon the surface. ?Dae ye see that. Chief??
Mac continued, now excited. ? Alcohol is a sol-
vent for most o? these narcotics. Michty me 1
it?s oxidising the brandy. That?s aldehyde now,
I ken it by its awful smell. It?ll empty the
hotel in twa minutes.?
? Throw it through the window, Mac,? cried
the Chief. ? I?ve got an idea.?
? Dinna forget it, then, for ony sake,? re-
sponded Mac, obeying the Chief?s request. ? What
is it? ?
? I ?oh ?why, yes, we?ll collect all that mys-
terious powder for analysis. Here, waiter, bring
us some more brandy. Now, Mac, make a paper
filler and we?ll shake all these flowers into this
soda-water bottle. We can then preserve the
powder by dissolving it in alcohol, and if we
can only cork the bottle tight enough, perhaps
we?ll be able to keep the gas from coming off.
We can analyse it thoroughly at a more con-
venient time.?
? All right, Chief,? agreed Mac, and the brandy
coming then, both men proceeded to carry their
plan into effect.
? Now, Mac,? said the Chief, when the frothing
green fluid was bottled and corked, and the cork
tied down with a wire, ?it seems we don?t know
anything about ourselves. We may He dreaming
now for all we know. Tell me candidly, have
you the faintest memory of anything? Who was
that dream man who stood there and told us all
Or was there a man at all? Or did he tell us any-
thing? ?


? Chief, I dinna ken what?s fact and what?s
only fancy, but I?ve got a kind o? an idea that we
were tricked by a member o? a gang we baith
ken, and o? which you were the Chief. Noo, if
what I?m saying is intelligible to you it proves
that I am talking facts.?
?It is intelligible, Mac. I have the same im-
pression myself, but where the reality ends and
the dream begins I don?t know. I feel it strong
within me, however, that we were working to
accomplish some end, and that we were using
some discoveries known only to ourselves to bring
it about.?
? Ay, that?s true, but it seems to me that the
wee Greek fellow was na talkin? vera carefully
when he said he had dropped a shutter over our
memories. Noo, I feel as if my mind is like a
phonograph record that has been shaved o? all
that had been on it, an? is noo ready to take new
impressions as weel as ever it was.?
? From which you infer, that only what is past
is a blank, and that from now on we can build
afresh? But the whole thing is most nonsensical.
I could almost believe that we have been drinking.
Our memory gone? What an idea ! Come, let us
go to the theatre. Confound it ! I?ve forgotten
your name, and I know you as well as I do
myself.?
? I?ve forgotten it mysel?, but ?an awfu? idea
has just struck me. Chief ?ay, that?s your name
?l?ve been dreaming afore this time, an? I?m noo
wakened to what happened lang ago. I was an
inventor, an? I had a partner who died, an? I had
a son who had the makings o? a first-class engi-
neer in him. Oh, what?s gone wrong wi? me noo?


What can have happened to him? It feels as if
it were only yesterday I saw him, but ?
Mac paused as if in thought, then thrust his
hand into an inside pocket and pulled out a news-
paper. ?I see by the date on this paper that it?s
six years since I forgot the first time ?
? Come, my comrade, let us get away from here.
We must have been drugged to-night. To-morrow
we?ll be all right.?
? Ah, ye think I?m raving, Chief, I see that,
but let me tell you that my memory is as clear
on all my life up to about six years ago as that
last six years are hazy. I ken noo a lot o? things,
an? I can see that the hocussing o? my memory
this last time has lifted the screen that was put
over it the first time. Why, I can even remember
that Greek, Valli, an? some other folk cornin? to
me wantin? to buy the knowledge I had discovered
o? hoo tae make a boat slip through the water wi?
only half the skin tension, I didna tell them
though, I remember that, and everything after that
is blank. An? whaur can ma wee laddie be noo? ?
The Scot was much troubled, and the Chief seemed
to be equally so.
? Mac,? he said ?? see, I remember your name
now ?I can see that we have been the victims of
a most diabolical outrage, as apparently you have
been before. In my dream mind just now, however,
I can recall my first meeting you in Glasgow in
connection with some gas engine you had invented.
It, of course, may be only my fancy, but I think I
asked you to join my company of scientists and
engineers on a boat I had. After this we built
another vessel with many improvements in her,
and we have been together ever since. I even


have it somewhere in the back of my head that we
.were both recently prisoners on the same boat,
owing to a mutiny having broken out, and that we
escaped by jumping through the porthole in my
private experimenting room. Say if you have any
recollection of what I have just said.?
? Chief, ye?ve just spoken what I would mysel?.
We were wi? a band o? men, all working to bring
out some new inventions, an?, among other things,
extracting gold from the water o? the ocean ; but
they wanted to turn pirates an? we wouldna, so
they stole the ship, an? we decided to build another
boat an? chase them until we got it back.?
? Exactly, Mac. Then we haven?t lost our
memories at all. We are only a little bit hazy ;
we?ve been drugged, that?s all.?
? Ay, we?ve lost oor memories. Chief, but I?ve
only lost six years and got back all ma life afore
that. Valli must have been in league wi? some gey
queer folk before he joined the Cosmopolites.?
? See, Mac, you are talking quite rationally.
We shall be all right to-morrow. We know that
what looks like a dream is really true, and we can
act on that until we regain our full memories.?
? But the trouble is that Valli has robbed us
completely o? the knowledge o? these details which
are necessary for us to know if we want ever to
get even wi? the other fellows. Evidently we had
some patents, but what they were I dinna ken,
and whaur we were workhT at the new ship is
completely gone from me. One thing, however, I
have now got all the knowledge I had afore I lost
my memory first, an? wi? that alone we?ll catch the
beggars though we chase them over every sea. I
wish we kent what oor secret power was, though ;


YALLI?S WORK AND ITS RESULT 55
there?s naething like having plenty q? horse power
if ye want to travel fast.?
? Never mind, Mac, we?ll get that somehow,
even though we have to invent the thing over
again, and I am sure you can do that. But I
see that paper you have in your hands is the
Glasgow News. Now that shows, or at least
makes it probable, that you were in Glasgow on the
date of its issue. It is dated Friday, the 27th, and
by the menu card I see to-day is Saturday, the
28th. I think we?ll go to Glasgow, Mac. Luckily,
although we?ve forgotten some things, I have not
forgotten that my banking account is fairly
large ?
? Look 1 you were right about Glasgow,- inter-
rupted Mac, springing from his seat and leaning
over the table to point out a marked paragraph in
the paper. ? Read that 1 ?
The Chief took the paper and read : ? Engi-
neers in the West of Scotland are greatly inte-
rested in a new form of gas engine which is shown
in model form in the window of a well-known
jeweller?s shop in Buchanan Street. It seems a mar-
vellous little plant, and appears to be a remarkably
near approach to the dreamer?s perpetual motion.
Inquiries so far have failed to elicit any information
concerning the working of the engine, but we are
informed that it has been running constantly since
last Friday without having received any attention
or fuel, and that the clever inventor and maker is
a young apprentice in one of the local shipbuilding
yards.?
?What dae ye think o? it? ? Mac asked when
the Chief laid down the paper. ?It must have
some special interest for us or I wouldna have
marked the paragraph.?


? It suggests to me, Mac, that some Glasgow
youth has found out something of the same nature
as that with which we drove the Lucifer , for,
unless I am dreaming again, that was done by
a strange gas engine you invented.?
?You are right, Chief, it was, and we had
an accelerating power which naebody on board
kent o? but our two selves,?
? Well, Mac, we?re somewhat handicapped now
by the loss of our memory for details, so we?ve got
to make up for that by some other means, and
speed is always a factor of some account. Waiter 1
find out when the trains leave for Glasgow to-
night.?
? Half-past nine and midnight from St. Pan-
cras, sir; 8.45 and 11.30 from King?s Cross;
and 8.50 and 11.50 from Euston. The 11.50
from Euston is the fastest train, sir, and lands
you at the Central Station in Glasgow at 7.50 in
the morning.?
? Thank you. Get our bill then, please, and
call a cab.?
? For the 11.50, sir? ?
? No, for the 9.30, St. Pancras. We?re better
away from London, Mac ; we can ?phone for a
sleeping berth, and by to-morrow morning I hope
we shall waken up in St. Enoch?s Station and find
that most of our strange experiences to-night were
in reality little more than the results of indiges-
tion.?
? And if we find that they are only too real? ?
? Then we?ll see the inventor of this gas plant
and buy his patent from him. If it is not so good
as our own it may serve to put us on the right
track to invent our own over again, and, in any


case, we want to get as many clever engineers as
possible into our services if we hope to outwit
these desperado dream people.?
? Only let me get ma hands roond that Greek?s
throat an? I?ll ask nae mair,? said Mac. ? I could
let him off so far as I am personally concerned,
but to think o? ma wee laddie left fatherless and
homeless wi? no? a frien? in the whole wide world.
I wonder what has become of him? ?
? We?ll find him too, Mac, though we turn the
planet upside down ; but I feel sure he is all right.
If he inherited any of your inventive powers he?ll
probably be well known in engineering circles.
How old should he be? ?
?He was twelve when I saw him last. He will
be aboot eighteen now.?
Just such another as the young inventor we
are going to see to-morrow in Glasgow. In fact,
Mac, it may be him. It would be only natural for
a son to follow out the same line of thought as
his father.?
Dinna talk that way, Chief, or ye?ll make me
forget the work we?ve on hand.?
? Which we have pretty well forgotten already,
Mac. But we?ll clear out of here. Waiter, did
you ask any one to get our baggage ready? ?
? The porter has everything in the hall now,
? �i '
sir.
I dinna ken whether we had ony baggage or
no,?.? muttered Mac, as they rose from the table.
Nor I, Mac, but that was my way of finding
out. Oh, evidently this is ours. We are each the
possessor of suit cases, it seems, and I have a
portmanteau in addition. I wonder what is in it? ?
?What station, sir? ? the porter asked respect-
fully.


? Oh, St. Pancras,? the Chief answered, step-
ping into the cab waiting outside. ? Come on,
Mac, we?ve only an hour.?
? I can put you there in thirteen minutes, sir,?
the cabman volunteered as they drove off.
? And, by Jupiter I you?ll get the chance,
cabby,? cried the Chief, excitedly, ? I?ll give half
a sovereign for every half-minute you take off that
time ; but to Euston instead of St. Pancras.?
? Right, sir,? the cabman responded, whipping
up his horse.
?What?s up, Chief?? asked Mac, surprised at
the sudden change in the Chief?s manner. ? And
why is it Euston now? ?
? Because I saw some of the dream people in
the hall as we left. They were watching us, and I
could see were greatly surprised at our being appa-
rently so able to look after ourselves. They will
certainly take some steps to waylay us in the 9-3�
train, so now we?re going to catch the 8.50 from
the other station instead.?
? Good,? said Mac in approval. ? I can see you
are still smart enough for maist things even if ye
have lost your memory. Now, if we could only
find oot whaur I was working at a dream ship to
chase the other one, we might make these dream
people sit up sooner than they expect. Hallo 1
Chief, I?ve done it ! ? Mac while speaking had
been searching in his vest pockets, and he now
produced therefrom the return half of a railway
ticket. ? Valli is a fool after all,? he said. ? He?s
left us the means o? findin? oot a second time all
we?ve forgotten. Chief, I was in Glasgow yester-
day, so I must have seen the model, and our patent
ship is being built somewhere near Oban. Here?s


a half o? a return ticket wi? that name on it, an?
it?s dated yesterday.?
? We?ll have everything pieced together in no
time, Mac,? laughed the Chief. ? Already we know
enough to go on with, and we?ll soon find out the
rest. But we must take great care of ourselves
from now on, for our dream devils are powerful,
and will not hesitate at anything.?
??We?ll take every precaution, Chief ; but I?m
beginning to think they?re less deadly than we gave
them credit for. I find I haven?t lost my memory
at all. That was the Strand near Charing Cross
we crossed a while since, and this is Oxford Street
we?re cornin? tae noo. We?ll next gang up Totten-
ham Court Road an? turn into Euston by the right
at the top.?
? Can you remember the name of the hotel we
have just left? ? put in the Chief.
? The ?the Why, it?s clean oot o? ma head.
But look at the bill.?
? I never thought of that. Ah 1 it is the ? Vic-
toria.? Remember that, Mac.?
? That?s one o? my dream places too.?
? Yes, I think we always met there when on
shore.?
Mac did not answer. He was thinking deeply,
and a few minutes after they reached Euston Sta-
tion with ten minutes to spare.
The 8.50 train to the north is not the fastest by
any means, but that did not matter to either the
Chief or Mac, as they fell asleep an hour or so
after the train started, only awaking as it rolled
over the great Clyde bridge into the Central Sta-
tion, Glasgow. A porter was at hand as the train
stopped, and, pointing out their belongings, the


Chief laconically said, ? Station Hotel,? and turned
to walk down the platform with Mac. But the
porter uttered an exclamation as he pulled out the
baggage. It had been labelled by the Midland
route before leaving the hotel.
? What?s the matter? ? asked the Chief.
?Ye maun be lucky folk, sirs,? the man
answered, ? or Providence has been guid tae ye.?
? Why, my good man? I have often fancied
that, if anything, the fates were unkind.?
? Your baggage is addressed by the Midland
9-30.?
??Well? ?
? Well, that train was smashed up an hour ago
near Dumfries. We dinna ken the damage yet
nor what caused it, but they?ll likely be able to
tell ye at St. Enoch?s Station. There?s something
no richt aboot the affair onyway.?
The Chief and Mac looked at each other. The
same thought had occurred to both. ? See what
we have missed, Mac,? said the former.
? Ay,? replied Mac thoughtfully, ? if that acci-
dent was brought about by our friends it shows
that they?ll stick at nothing ; but it also shows
that they are more afraid o? us than we are o? them.
I hope naebody has been hurt ?
? Stand still a moment, Mac,? the Chief inter-
rupted. ? Ah, porter, just take that baggage under
your own special charge until we come back. Let
no one see it. Show us a side way out of the
station.?
??What?s wrong noo, Chief?? asked Mac, as
the porter led them to a passage out into Hope
Street,
? Look down the platform and tell me if you


see anything of special interest to us near the
entrance to the hotel.?
? Michty me ! I see the chief deevil o? ma
dream demons an? twa o? his satellites just goin?
into the hotel, an? they?re leadin? in another fellow
who seems to be dead drunk.?
? Exactly what I see, Mac. Hence we are not
going to that hotel, just nqw at any rate. Let us
take a walk in the fresh air until we think matters
over,?
They walked aimlessly through the streets, which
at that early hour on Sunday morning were quite
deserted. Suddenly, however, Mac cried ?
?? Hallo, Chief ! we are in Buchanan Street.
Let us look for the shop where the model is.?
? All right ; but what are those people doing
over there at this hour of the morning? ?
44 They?re watching. Ah ! there has been a
burglary in a jeweller?s shop.? The two crossed
over the road to where a couple of policemen were
standing guard over a broken but barred window,
round which a crowd of nondescripts and one or
two well dressed chance passers-by were clustered.
? What is the matter, constable? ? inquired the
Chief. ? Shop robbed, I suppose? ?
? Don?t know, sir, until the owner, Mr. South-
wood, comes. We?ve telephoned for him, but so
far as we can see it is only a broken window, for
there does not seem to be anything stolen.?
44 But there is,? observed a youth standing by.
44 The model gas engine and plant is not there. It
was there last night at ten o?clock, and must have
been stolen since then.?
44 Move on there, please,? cried the constable,
not caring for any one to know more than he did


himself ; ?my mate and I have been on duty in
sight of the shop all night. It must have been a
drunk going home this morning who fell against
the window. Jewellers ought to have shutters the
same as other people.?
? Git out, ye green un,? laughed a loafer ; ? an?
then a thief once he got into the shop would be all
right, an? could work all night without being seen.
Don?t ye know that we pay big fat-headed police-
men to watch our shops.?
The two policemen turned angrily, but the
speaker, probably recognising the fact that he
could not get his fingers on any of the articles of
value so temptingly near without risking too much,
had taken his departure.
? Do you know anything of the model that was
there? ? spoke the Chief, turning to the youth who
said it had been stolen.
? I should say so,? replied the boy. ? Its in-
ventor and Bob here and I are partners. We
saw the machine last night.?
? Look here, my lads,? said the Chief, ?my
friend and I have come up from London specially
to see that model ; could you take us to your part-
ner?s house? We should like to talk with him and
you about its purchase.?
? But it is stolen,? put in the one named Bob' ;
? and any way I don?t think Jim would care to
receive visitors on Sunday morning.?
? Laddies,? began Mac, ? there?s more in our
wantin? to see him than could be told to you inside
an hour. We want his machine, or the knowledge
how to make another, an? we?re ready to pay for
either.?
? Some other people expressed the same desire


for knowledge last night,? said the boy, but
somehow I like your faces, and I shall risk Jim s
displeasure. Come on, Bob, we?ll take them there.
Jim rises early.?
A cab was called, and the two boys, the Chief,
and Mac drove out to where James Robertson
resided. His landlady opened the door. ? Can
ye no give the poor laddie Sunday to himself? ?
she began, recognising the boys ; ? it?s hardly
twa hours since the last lot o? foreigners left him.?
? We want to see him specially, Mrs. Brown,?
cried Harry Southwood, rushing past the landlady
and running to his comrade?s room. ? Jim,? he
cried, ?Bob and I have brought visitors who want
to buy your patent. Get up quick.?
There was no answer, and, becoming impatient,
Southwood called again, and then opened the door
of the room.
It was empty, and the bed had not been slept in.


CHAPTER 111
THE BALTIC PRINCE
Southwood?S news naturally caused great excite-
ment, and soon the four visitors and Mrs. Brown
were in the deserted room.
? The laddie?s been stolen,? cried the lady,
wringing her hands. ? I kent nae good would
come o? his nicht work and inventions ?
? Quick ! ? cried Fitzgerald, ? the two foreigners
said they were staying at the Central Station
Hotel. Let us get there at once.?
? Perhaps Jim has gone over to breakfast with
them,? suggested Southwood, but Mrs. Brown
shook her head.
? No, no,? she said, ? he wadna gang oot with-
oot lettin- me ken, besides I kent there was some-
thing wrang with the foreigners the moment I saw
them last night ?
? Calm yourself, my dear lady,? spoke the Chief
soothingly. ? We?ll find out all about this and
bring the boy back very soon.?
? Are you two detectives? ?
? Not by profession, but we have a special in-
terest in this case?Mac, there is a faint odour of
something in the room. What is it? ?
? It is?it is ? stammered Mac, sniffing the
64


atmosphere. ? Man, I ken the stuff well, but I
canna mind the name o? it.?
? Chloroform,? suggested Southwood.
? That is it,? said the Chief. ? Chloroform.
Your comrade has been drugged by some one,
and ??he examined the window for a moment ?
? lowered into the street by means of a rope. See,
there is the mark the rope made chafing on the
window framework, and on the ledge outside is a
button scraped off his garments as he was passed
through.?
? Well, what are we to do? ? asked Fitzgerald.
??lt is evident that these foreigners who were so
interested in his patent have been here and taken
him away. The police should be informed at
once ?
? Sit down, young man,? ordered the Chief,
? I?ll take this business in hand. Does any one
know where the Sunday morning trains from the
Central Station go to, and when they leave? And,
Mac, you might hurry out and turn down the first
side-street leading in the direction of the Central.
I expect you?ll find the rope lying in the roadway
if no one has already picked it up. They couldn?t
carry it far when they had the boy to look after,
and they would not be so foolish as to use a cab.?
Mac at once left the apartment, and the Chief
continued ; ? One of you boys might piece together
those fragments of a visiting card lying in the
grate. They have been thrown there since the fire
went out, and should tell us something.? Fitz-
gerald had set about the task before the Chief had
finished speaking, and Southwood, who had been
looking up a time-table to find out the Sunday
trains, said : ? There are not many trains leaving


Glasgow from the Central on Sunday mornings.
I find there are two for Perth and the north, at
6.10 and seven o?clock, and one at 7.30 for
Greenock. There seems to be another two which
go to Paisley, but I can?t trace them past that
town.?
? The name on this card is ? John Smith,
ss. Chameleon , Greenock,? ? intimated Fitzgerald,
looking up. ? I?ll bet that is a faked name any-
how.?
? I am of the same opinion, my lad,? the Chief
said. ?Is there a garage anywhere near here? ?
? There is one round the next corner, sir,? re-
plied the boy, surprised at the question.
? Then run along and hire the fastest car they
have in the place.?
? But they wouldn?t give one to me, sir, without
paying a large sum as a deposit ?
? Oh, yes, I forgot. Here are some banknotes.
They are English, but I expect the Bank of
England has a fairly good credit in Glasgow.
Bring the car round yourself. We don?t want any
man. Ah, Mac, you?ve got the rope, I see.?
? Ay, just where you said it would be. It is a
rope that has been much used at sea, for the smell
o? the salt water is gey strong on it.?
? Well, Mac, old comrade, our dream people
have got a start on us, but if they always leave
tracks as they have done as yet, we?ll soon overhaul
them. That rope has certainly been wet with sea
spray a good many times.?
? But what does that matter, sir? ? asked South-
wood. ?We know now that poor Jim was lowered
through the window, but what difference does it
make whether that was done by an old or a new
rope? ?


? It proves that the rope came from a ship, my
boy, as apparently did also Mr. John Smith, for,
allowing his card to be misleading, he is a sailor.
No landsman could fix up a boatswain?s chair like
that on the end of a rope.?
? Then you think John Smith is the man
? There were two of them, and they were
foreigners,? put in Mrs. Brown. Their names
werena Smith any more than mine is.?
? Possibly not,? agreed the Chief, ? but the man
who tore up that card ?probably the card by which
he announced himself ?was in this room after the
fire went out.?
? An? it was a big fire, sir,? said Mrs. Brown.
? He, or his companion, doubtless had that rope
rolled around his body, and after they had rendered
our young friend unconscious they returned with
him to the vessel from which they came. Now
John Smith gives out that he lives on board the
Chameleon at Greenock, and as the only Sunday
train left at 7.30, he most likely travelled by it,
and we are going after him as soon as that
motor-car arrives ?
? But, sir,? persisted South wood, ? assuming
that the man, or men, and the rope, came from
some ship, is it not possible that they came from
some vessel at present in Glasgow harbour? That
visiting card may have been left there on purpose.?
? True,? mused the Chief, ? I was following out
an idea, and was fitting facts to it without thinking
of other possibilities.? 1
? And then, what about the stealing of the
model? The men we saw last night couldn?t very
well have done both things. Anyway, they had no
rope about their person.?


? I hae a fancy,? said Mac, looking at the Chief,
** that there is a gang o? them. Some o? them saw
the model and got the address o? its inventor, an?
then sent for the others. Greenock is less than an
hour?s journey from Glesga, and a telegram could
have brought a man with a rope.?
? But why Greenock, Mac? ? asked the Chief.
??You are on the same track as I am, I can see,
but I fear we are both wrong.?
? Describe the men you saw last night, and
whom you suspect of stealing the model,? said
Mac. ?Or wait ?tell us a?- you ken first, Mrs.
Brown.?
? After the boys had gone home last nicht, an?
left ma laddie to himsel?, two men came to the door
and asked to see him. One looked like a gentle-
man, but I could see he was a foreigner, while the
other was a big, ugly nigger. Both were dressed
up like tailors? dummies, an? one gave me his card
to take in. I heard them talking for some time,
and then they laughed and seemed to become very
friendly. I got tired after a bit and went to bed,
an? you ken the rest.?
? Then it can?t be the same couple,? said South-
wood. ? The men who were so interested in Jim?s
model were foreigners, but both were good-looking,
well-dressed men, and had more money than they
knew what to do with. They were particularly
anxious to know about the use of the middle tube
in the gas producer, and said they stayed at the
Central Station Hotel. We went home with Jim
after that, expecting them to call, but about eleven
o?clock we thought they had changed their minds,
and went home ourselves. This morning early
Bob and I had arranged to come along and see


what difference was in the coal in the hopper from
last night, but when we got to the shop we found it
had been broken into and the model stolen. That?s
all we know.?
? They said they were staying at the ? Central,?
mused the Chief. ? I wonder if we really saw those
dream-people this morning. Ah ! Mac, don?t you
remember they were supporting another man be-
tween them? They were our dream-people after
all, and now they have got the very man we came
to see in their hands. I hear the motor-car coming
up the street. We?ll go down to the ? Central and
have it out with them. We are surely their match
in anything they like to do.?
? They were particularly interested in what the
middle tube was used for?? murmured Mac, deep
in thought, as after telling Mrs. Brown that they
would come back, they proceeded downstairs to
where Fitzgerald was waiting, as proud as could be
that he had proved able to steer a car the first time
he had ever tried. The fact that he had only come
about a hundred yards, and along a straight street,
made no difference to his pleasure.
But Mac now took his place, and under his skil-
ful guidance they soon reached the ? Central,? only
to find that two gentlemen answering to the boys?
description had departed early that morning along
with some other foreign-looking people.
? But where did they go? ? inquired the Chief.
? Don?t know, sir,? answered the clerk ; ? per-
haps some of the porters might be able to tell
you.?
Rushing through into the deserted station, the
Chief searched the platforms, and his eyes fell
on the baggage Mac and he had left that
morning.


? Dear me, I had forgotten all about them,?- 1 he
exclaimed aloud.
? But I hadn?t, sir,? spoke the porter into whose
charge he had entrusted them, ? and I had to keep
my eyes on them too, I can tell you, for these
foreigners seemed gey anxious to get ower close
to them.?
? How many people were there in the party of
foreigners? ? the Chief asked.
? Aboot seven or eight ; but there was one
among them I?ll swear was never far awa? frae the
Clyde in his life. He was a young fellow, an? was
as drunk as any man I ever saw.?
? Indeed,?-? laughed the Chief, ? they must have
been a strange lot. Was there a negro among
them? ?
? Ay, a giant of a fellow. He was carrying the
young fellow who was drunk. The man that
seemed to be a sort of boss had a name that
spelt like Hassanrahn. He had a dirty wee box
wi? him he was awfully careful of, an? he gied me
half a sovereign for puttin? it in the carriage beside
him.?
? Well, here is another for looking after my
baggage. By the way, which way did they go?
Or you wouldn?t notice, perhaps ?
?Did I no?? Catch me no? noticin? anything.
They went doon tae Greenock wi? the 7.30 train,
an? frae their talk I understood that they had a
yacht lying there.?
? Ah, well, good morning. Just put these things
into the hotel for me now, or I?ll be forgetting
again.?? The Chief re-entered the hotel.
? Come on, boys,? he said to Mac and the
others. ? Get on board the car, and barring
accidents, the first stop is Greenock.?


? Have ye discovered anything, Chief,? Mac in-
quired.
?Yes, Mac, our dreams are not dreams. Our
enemies and the people who stole the model, and
who carried off these boys? comrade, are all the
same. Come, boys, we must join forces to get even
with those who are fighting against us. They are a
very powerful organisation, and are playing a game
far deeper than appears. They have taken your
comrade on board their yacht.
? We?re going to have our partner out of their
hands, anyway,? said Southwood. We 11 get the
police to board their yacht at Greenock.?
The Chief and Mac smiled. In their dreams
they saw a band of men who would make short
work of policemen.
? We?ll devise some plan going down,? the Chief
said as they got into the car. ? But just wait one
minute.?* He turned and ran into the hotel again,
and shortly after an elderly man, evidently of the
prosperous merchant class, came out and gazed
critically at the car and its occupants.
? Weel,? said Mac good-naturedly, after the
stranger had indulged in a good stare at him, I
hope I?ll pass. Ye ken I?m an orphan, an? if ye
dinna like me I?ll lose my job. Ay, but ca canny,
ma man, this car is no pro bo no publico The
stranger had attempted to enter the car.
? Why, Mac, won?t you let me in? ? the man
cried. ? It?s hardly fair of you to object to my
having a seat.?
? It?s the Chief ! ? yelled Mac, forgetting that
the name was meaningless to the boys. Man,
ye fairly cheated me. What?s in the wind noo? ?
? It would be very foolish for us to show our-


selves openly to the members of the gang,? the
disguised Chief answered, ?so I took the pre-
caution of getting the hairdresser inside to alter my
appearance?evidently he is a master of the art.?
?He is,? grunted Mac, as he swung the car
into Union Street. ? But I seem to have the idea
that you were always pretty good at disguising
yourself.?
? Strange to say, Mac, that idea is in the back
of my head, too. But our young friends do not
know of our adventures, Mac, so we had better not
refer to them until they know us better.?
Both boys were amazed when they realised that
the portly, city-like man who had joined them was
the same clean-shaven person who had been with
them all the morning ; but quickly understanding
that they were now associating with men different
from any they had previously met, they, after the
first involuntary exclamations of surprise, said
nothing. But now Mac, with a skill that showed
he had driven cars before, was carefully negotiat-
ing Jamaica Bridge, and next moment he turned
into the Paisley Road. It was a high-powered car,
easily capable of a forty mile per hour speed, but
Mac somehow knew that the iaws of the country did
not allow such a rapid rush through space, and
kept well within the limit until he had passed
through the famous engineering burgh of Govan.
After this, he opened her out, and the car flew down
to Renfrew at a great pace. It was still early in
the morning, and few people were about to witness
the rate at which the car then travelled towards
Greenock. The sensation was new to the boys, and
but for the knowledge that their comrade was in
trouble they would have enjoyed the exhilarating


ride beyond measure. As they neared Greenock all
scanned the broad and placid waters of the Firth
for signs of the Chameleon , but there seemed to be
only one vessel anchored in the roadstead popularly
known as the Tail of the Bank, the early tide
having allowed most vessels to proceed to Glasgow
an hour before. On the road down the Chief had
been thinking out a plan, but nothing definite had
been devised. He knew he could not tell the wild,
improbable story which was in his mind as a far-
away dream, but well he knew also that no police
force could help him much. At length he came
to the conclusion that he must be exaggerating the
power of the foreign gang, and saw that in any
case he must enlist the services of the police, or
lay his own party open to serious charges for
breaking the peace ; so, ordering Mac to stop, he
asked a policeman the way to the Police Station,
where soon after he was telling the Chief of the
Police as much as he dared about the abduction of
James Robertson.
? I am afraid there is some mistake,? that
official said, as the Chief finished. ? I happen to
know that the Chameleon cleared from Greenock
last night. I saw her owner, Mr. Smith, yester-
day, and he told me he was going down into the
Mediterranean until warmer weather favoured us.?
? But I know the boy has been taken away, and
was brought down to Greenock by the train this
morning,? persisted the Chief. ? I have every
reason to believe he was smuggled on board a
yacht lying here ?
? My dear sir, make a charge and we shall take
it up, but unless you do that why should we make
fools of ourselves by searching vessels for stolen


boys? Reflect a little, sir, this is not the age of
kidnapping. Why should any one wish to steal a
boy? We are living in the twentieth century, and
the police force is too well organised to allow of
any such mad scheme being carried out.?
? Nevertheless, I know of some things that
would startle the police if they knew,? said the
Chief. ? I tell you this boy and a patent model
were stolen from Glasgow during the early hours
of this morning ?
? I have heard no word from Glasgow head-
quarters beyond that some drunken man had
stumbled against a window in Buchanan Street.
The owner of the place, I am informed by tele-
phone, states that nothing of value has been
missed. In any case, the constable on duty at the
station this morning would have noticed if there
was anything unusual in the appearance of any
passengers ?
? They could have come off at a station before
the terminus. Doubtless they had a boat waiting
to take them to the yacht,?
The officer shook his head. ? Make a specific
charge against any one,? he said, ? and we?ll do
our duty ; but we can do nothing on the strength of
such an improbable-looking story as yours ?
? Then I charge the owners, at least, the present
occupiers, of the yacht Chameleon with abduction
and theft. Why, I could truthfully charge them
also with train-wrecking in an attempt on the lives
of my comrade and myself ?
? There, there, my dear sir, don?t get excited,?
began the officer, and the Chief saw that he had
now no hope of obtaining help from him. Clearly
he thought he was mad, just as Valli had said


people would think if he tried to tell them his
experiences. And the Chief wondered if he were
not really mad, for he was so hopelessly mixed up
in what seemed dreams, yet what he felt was real,
and yet could scarcely be anything else than
imaginary, that his reasoning powers could not
be at their best.
? Come round to-morrow, and we?ll take a sail
round all the craft that may be at anchorage just
to convince you,? continued the officer. But
I give you my word you will find no Chameleon
there. She sailed yesterday ?
The Chief departed and told the others the result
of his mission.
? We?ll have to go ourselves,? he said, as they
stood upon the quay, having left the car in a con-
venient garage.
? But there is only one boat out there,? observed
Fitzgerald, ? and it is by no means a yacht.
? I dinna ken,? said Mac doubtfully. ? A
chameleon changes its colour ; m?ybe this one
can change more than her colour. I?ve got an
idea that I kent a boat that made a practice o?
that game ?
? By Jupiter, Mac, you are right ! ? cried the
Chief. ? I dimly remember something like that
too. We?ll go out and have a look at that craft.?
?How about a boat?? inquired Southwood.
? There doesn?t seem to be any for hire here ?
? There is a motor launch at the foot of these
steps. Find out who owns it, boys, and beg,
borrow, hire, or buy it.?
? There is a man in it cleaning its engines now,?
said Fitzgerald, ? I?ll ask him if we can have it.?
He ran over and held a brief conversation with the


76 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
man, and then signed for the others to come for-
ward. It s for hire,? he cried, as they came near,
but it is double price on Sundays.?
? Never mind that,? replied the Chief. ? Get
m, boys.? Then, turning to the boatman, he said ;
Take us out to that craft over there and then sail
slowly round it.?
??All right, sir,? answered the man, starting the
engines. ?Itis a strange ship that, sir. I?ve been
over twice this morning with visitors to it, and
she has a couple of launches of her own running,
too. That s why I am here just now, for I expect
to have to take people off her yet.?
? Why? ? the Chief asked. ? May they not be
staying on board? ?
? There is no room, sir. She is about the ugliest
specimen of a cargo tramp that ever lay at the
Tail o? the Bank, and there?s nothing but coal all
over her. I don t know where she can be trading
to, but she?s a tub right enough.?
You took some people over to her this morn-
ing, you said? ?
? Yes > a lot of foreigners, but I don?t believe two
of them were of the same country.?
? When did she come in? ? asked Mac.
Some time this morning. She wasn?t there
last night, but she was the first craft my eyes
rested on this morning.?
?? Did you know the Chameleon? ? inquired the
Chief casually.
Not very well. You see, she was a private
yacht, and had her own launches to connect with
the snore. They say Mr. Smith, her owner, is
very wealthy. She lay about a hundred yards
further out than this cargo hulk, but she cleared
last night for the south.?


?Did you see her go? ?*
? Yes, I watched her lights until she had
rounded the point. My ! she could travel, too.
She was a ship to do a sailor?s eye good. But
here we are, sir. Do you want to go any closer?
There?s a lot of coal dust flying about from her
decks.? 1
?No, this will do ; sail slowly round her. Mac,
perhaps it might be as well if you kept out of sight
behind the engines.? 1
? I understand, Chief. Poor old Mac canna dis-
guise himsel?.? He hid his face behind the engines,
but nevertheless kept his eyes closely on the un-
gainly-looking vessel they were sailing round.
She certainly was not much to look at, and
seemed built specially for her cargo-carrying
capacity. She lay with her blunt bows low in the
water, apparently very badly trimmed. Her broad
dirty decks were broken by two enormous hatches,
over which were swung large cranes, and some
wooden erections, evidently cattle houses, defaced
her stern. A short black funnel and three masts
completed the ship.
? No, Mac, we?re sadly out of our reckoning this
time,?? the Chief remarked as they crossed her
bows. ? This ship is named the Baltic Prince , and
she looks a cheap Russian tramp.??
? There are no signs of life on board,? 1 said
Southwood. ? Nor can I imagine how any one
would stay amidst that coal dust if they could get
on shore.??
? But there are at least a dozen well-dressed
fellows there now, unless they swam ashore,?? put
in the boatman.
? Perhaps they were put off in the ship?s boat,?


the Chief suggested. ? They may have been
landed further up the river, you know.?
? Then our comrade is not here,? said Fitz-
gerald. ?Let me climb on board and I?ll hunt
the whole ship.?
?No use,? said Mac, ?he canna be there.
That s the Baltic Prince , an? the Chameleon
couldna change into a thing like that in one nicht.
It is clear to me that somebody who had no right
was using John Smith?s card last night.?
But we know that they came down this morn-
ing,? interrupted the Chief, ? They must be some-
where. Are there no other vessels about just now?
What ship is that lying a mile up stream, and what
is that near Gourock? ?
? That ship up the water is an Allan Line cattle
boat from South America,? answered the boat-
man, ? and that?s a new war-ship you see off
Gourock. But are you ready for the shore now,
sir? ?
? Mac, I cannot understand matters at all,? the
Chief spoke sadly, ? and my head feels as if it
were a big balloon.?
? Mine feels the same, Chief, but what is causin?
it wi? me is that I canna chase the notion oot o?
my head that I?ve kent this ship afore. Come back,
laddie. Are ye daft? ?
They were passing quite close to a ladder hung
from the vessel?s deck, and, actuated by some
sudden impulse, Southwood had caught it and
swung himself clear of the launch. ?Just hang
about,? he cried, ? I?ll make sure Jim isn?t on
board this mysterious ship.? He clambered up the
ladder and disappeared on deck before any one
could interfere.


? Let him go,? said the Chief, ? the lad has
pluck, and anyhow he?il put us out of our
suspense.?
? They can?t do anything to him,? added the
boatman, ? although it is a bit cheeky to go on
board a ship without being asked.?
? Look, look I ? shouted Fitzgerald, 41 the ship
is moving.? A white mass of boiling foam had
suddenly appeared at the stern.
44 Michty me ! So it is,? yelled Mac, as the
churned water-track became longer.
44 I can?t hear her engines,? exclaimed the boat-
man, 44 and blow me if I can see where she has
hidden her propeller. Where is her exhaust steam
going to? And what kind of fires has she that
don?t send any smoke out of the funnel?
44 Oh, follow her,? cried Fitzgerald. 44 Southwood
will be stolen, too. Let me get with him ?
The little launch was now racing alongside the
big vessel, but to the surprise of all, the despised
cargo tramp was fast getting a way on that was
strangely in contrast to what her appearance
promised.
44 She?s a cheat,? roared Mac, 44 her engines
must be phenomenal.?
44 There?s the boy,? cried the boatman. 44 Jump,
ye beggar, jump 1 ?
At that moment Southwood appeared in an open
iron doorway on a lower bulwarked deck, and
angry voices were now heard issuing from the
inner regions of the ship. Southwood turned and
gazed for a few seconds into the gloom through
which he had just passed, then as two men rushed
at him, sprang round, and jumped into the water.
The Baltic Prince sailed on and left the launch


tossing in its wake, apparently unnoticed, and by
the time the latter had picked up Southwood, who
was a good swimmer, was well on its way down the
Firth.
? Ma lad,? began Mac, as the boy was hauled on
board, ? I feel inclined to say you are a very
foolish laddie, but I?ll no dae it, for I?m no so sure
but that I once did the same thing mysel?.?
? Is Jim there? ? cried Fitzgerald.
? I don?t know,? gasped his comrade, ? but that
boat is driven with gas engines.?
? Eh, what ! ? cried Mac.
? And a man ?I think he was a Jap?asked me
to put this advertisement in all the leading
papers
? Begin at the beginning, my lad,? advised the
Chief, ? and we?ll understand better.?
? When I got on deck the Jap was waiting?he
had been watching us, I think. He caught me at
once and threw me down, then he pushed this
note into my hands, and said : 4 Put this in all the
leading papers, and if it is seen by the right person
he will pay you well. Here is some money now.?
He then lifted me to my feet before I could say a
word, and said : 4 Run, here are some of the Cos-
mopolites coming. Take that door to the left and
run through the engine-room.? I did so, just as a
shout got up, and jumping the stairs leading down,
I raced round the engines to where I saw the open
door. A couple of engineers came after me, but I
saw the engines before I jumped.?
44 This is gettin? excitin?,? remarked the boat-
man, as he steered for the shore without asking for
instructions. 44 If they had caught you they would
have made you work. I fancy they are clearing
out without a full crew on board.?


? But your message ; let me see it,? said the
Chief.
Southwood tore open his collar and produced
from the region of his shirt-front a crumpled and
soaked piece of paper on which were some pen-
cilled lines in large, laboured handwriting. The
Chief read them in silence and passed the paper to
Mac.
? ? If this is seen by the Chief,? ? read Mac
aloud, then he stopped and looked puzzled.
? That?s funny,? he remarked, ? the Chief is the
first man who did see it.?
?Go on, Mac,? said the Chief, ? see if you
take the same view as I do.?
? ? He will know,? ? continued Mac, ? ? that the
Lucifer has sailed for Cape Town. He has four
friends on board.? ? Mac handed the paper to
Southwood. ?Of all the maist marvellous coin-
cidences I?ve ever heard o?,? he said, ? that takes
the cake. There?s a signature to it that spells
Ikato.?
? Shall I put it in the papers, sir? ? Southwood
asked. ?If he gave me any money I?ve lost it in
the water.?
The Chief was silent.
? Here you are then, gentlemen,? cried the boat-
man, ? you?re back in nice time for lunch.?
? Which reminds me,? spoke Mac, ? that we
haven?t had our breakfast yet.?
? But what about Jim Robertson and his patent,
cried Southwood, as they stepped ashore, ? and
what about this advertisement? ?
? Your comrade and his stolen model we have
still got to find,? spoke the Chief slowly, ? and
we?ll do it. As for the advertisement, you need
6


not put it in the papers. The man it is intended
for has seen it. I am the Chief.?
? What, are you the man whom Valli was to
do something to? -
? What do you know of Valli? ? cried the Chief.
? Quick, tell me.?
?Why, we heard the two foreigners say that
everything would be right if Valli succeeded with
you and some one called Mac. Did he manage?
? He did, my boy,? groaned the Chief, ? only
too well. But we have all got the one object
now. Let us get back to Glasgow and we?ll tell
you everything.?


CHAPTER IV
THE NEMESIS COMES INTO BEING
It was late in the afternoon when, after having
lunched together in the Central Hotel, the Chief
told the boys the strange adventures Mac and he
had so recently experienced. Mac had gone out
to try to think. The air of the hotel seemed to
choke him, and the memory of his life before the
great blank rose vividly before him.
? And have you really lost your memory? ? Fitz-
gerald asked after a long pause. He was wonder-
ing what the two men would be like under normal
conditions, having seen much that day which
showed him that the Chief and Mac were even now
men of exceptional ability and character.
?To all practical purposes we have,? the Chief
answered. ?We have always a hazy sort of vision
in our minds, but we cannot tell whether it has
any significance or is only imagination. But it is
only the past that is blurred. We remember every-
thing that happened since Valli left us, and we
have not lost our reasoning powers in the slightest.
We have Valli?s powder preserved for analysis,
but I am doubtful if we can discover what gives
it its peculiar power even if we separate its com-
ponent parts. One thing we know about it is that


a second inhalation of the drug dissolves the cloud
formed on the brain by the first. Mac has proved
that. But we are fast fitting in links to a long
chain of strange circumstances, and, from what
you boys have told us, and our experiences to-day,
we can now grasp roughly what has occurred. We
know ?Valli himself impressed it on us ?that we
had some form of accelerating power by which we
increased the speed of our ship, and that we had
destroyed it. That, it seems, was about six months
ago. But they knew we had done this, and to
prevent us from building another vessel which, by
the use of this accelerator, would be able to travel
faster, they contrived to take our memory from
us ?
? But how could a band of people such as you
have described exist at the present time? ? broke
in Southwood. ? The world would be bound to
hear of them.?
** The world will hear of them, I expect. You
must remember, though, that what I have told you
is all like a dream to me. I have pieced it together
from what I know to be fact, and that message
from the faithful little Marquis Ikato proves to
me that a lot of what is dreamlike has really some
foundation. It appears that I was Chief of the
band until they mutinied, and that was brought
about because I wouldn?t allow them to become
evildoers. Now, Mac happened to have a paper
in his pocket in which was an article on the gas-
model in a certain jeweller?s window, and when
we realised that this was almost exactly the secret
Valli had caused us to forget we came down from
London at once to buy the patent, or make arrange-
ments by which we could make use of it. But,


as you boys have told us, the other side had seen
the model too, and recognised it as what they
wanted. Thus they have scored again, for not
only have they the discovery now, but they also
have its inventor, which fact, unless you can
remedy matters, puts an end to our hopes.?
? We know the general rules, sir,? said South-
wood, ? but we do not know what Jim used to
impregnate the gas.?
??lt was something of the nature of picric acid,?
added Fitzgerald ; ? but can?t we make the police
find Jim? He can?t be far away.?
?He is en route to Cape Town now in the,
hands of the cleverest men on earth.?
? What ! On the Baltic Prince? ? cried South-
wood.
?On the Lucifer said the Chief. ? That was
the Lucifer we sailed round to-day. She was dis-
guised. I thought there was something familiar
about her, but my memory would not help me
until you brought that message.?
? Well, we are Jim?s partners, and we are going
to find him somehow,? said Fitzgerald. ? We?ll
get away to Cape Town as junior engineers on that
new boat our yard is finishing just now, Harry.?
? I?ll borrow money from my uncle and we?ll
leave by the first steamer. That will be a better
plan,? Southwood said.
? My dear boys, you needn?t worry about money
matters. I have sufficient ; but I think we had
better join forces instead of acting separately. I
want the Lucifer; you must have your comrade.
Very well, we can?t get either simply by going to
Cape Town and taking them. The Cosmopolites
?yes, that?s their name ?are far too clever to allow


that. Their ship will be disguised there beyond
recognition, and she could just sail away again for
parts unknown at any moment.?
??lf we only had a ship of our own to chase
them,? muttered Fitzgerald.
? That is my idea. We?ll get the fastest boat
possible and follow them wherever they go. If
we could only get Valli into our hands we could
force him to restore our memories, and then Mac
would quickly put his patent gas-engine forces
into a vessel, and we could soon run them down
after that.?
The boys thought for a moment. ?We should
like to join you, sir,? Southwood then said, ? but
we are only two apprentice engineers, and I am
afraid not of much use to you when it comes to
capturing big ships. It?s our comrade, Jim Robert-
son, we?re anxious about ?
?An? it?s ma son, Jim Robertson, I?m anxious
about,? cried a voice, and Mac, fairly shaking
with suppressed excitement, stood beside them.
? Calm yourself, Mac,? spoke the Chief kindly.
? You are excited ?
? An? what for should I no? be excited? ?
answered Mac. ? Look at that photograph, Dae
ye see onything there to remind ye o? onything
ye?ve seen before? ? He handed the Chief a
photograph, and waited eagerly for him to speak.
? Yes, Mac, this boy has got your features.
He is almost your image, although, of course,
younger. This must be your lost son. Where
is he? ?
? I wish I kent,? groaned Mac in anguish.
? That?s the inventor of the thing we came to see.
I got it frae Mrs. Brown this afternoon. That?s
my son.?


the nemesis COMES INTO BEING 87
? Yes, that is our comrade,? cried the boys, not
quite understanding the meaning of Mac?s words.
? gut, Mac,? reasoned the Chief, your name
jg is?why, you never had a name.
?Aye had I. There?s a letter in ma pocket
which tells me that, an? a guid bit mair. They
called me Macpherson these last six years odd, but
ma name before that, I mind weel, was Andrew
Robertson. And noo, ma laddie is in the hands
o? the Cosmopolites ?
The Chief arose and grasped Mac?s hand, the
boys gazing at them in intense astonishment as
the truth slowly dawned on them. My
comrade,? said the Chief, his eyes shining, you
stuck to me when I was in trouble and together
we?ll see the thing out now. We?ll move the world,
if money can buy the brains and strength to do
it But it is the boy we want now, the Lucifer
they can keep. I?ll cable to them at Cape
rp J >
Town .
? Na, na, Chief, nae compromises. I ken what
ye are goin? to propose, but I?ll no hear o it.
Besides, if they kent wha they had got, or saw that
we were anxious aboot him, they d keep him as a
hostage for ever. We?ll use strategy, Chief, an
hae baith him an? the Lucifer afore lang. I?ve
found oot quite a lot aboot ourselves, an we re
no so helpless as we thought. Did ma laddie
ever tell ye onything aboot his faither, boys?
? Only that he went away because he was done
out of some patents,? said Southwood.
? Ay, that?s true enough, but he kept the secret
o? his last one, an? thereby hangs the story o his
misfortune ?
? But are you really Jim?s father? asked Fitz-
gerald. ?It all seems so strange.?


? Laddie, look at me. Tak? ony objection ye
like and tell me what ye think yersel?.? The big
Scot stood up, and the boys gazed critically at him.
? There is no doubt about it with me, Mr.
Robertson,? Southwood said finally.
?Nor with me,? added Fitzgerald. ? But why
didn?t you come back sooner? Poor Jim had to
fight against everything without any friends except
Harry and me ?
? My boys,? began Mac, ? ye?ve heard frae the
Chief all that I can tell. But gie me a grip o?
your fists ; I?ll tak? ma son?s place in your
partnership until he?s back wi? ye himsel?, and
by all that was ever in me, I swear that that will no
be long.? The two boys in turn got their hands
crushed in Mac?s powerful grip. Then the Chief
said : ? Don?t leave me out, boys. Make it a
quartette, for we?re all going to fight together.?
? Well, sir,? said Southwood as he grasped the
Chief?s hand, ? I don?t care what you tell me to
do, I?ll do it, so long as it is with the intention'
of helping my comrade.?
? And if we can get him,? added Fitzgerald,
? we?ll all fight for you to the very last ; and my !
if Jim is with us we can do anything. He?d invent
something that would get you back your ship in
half a minute ?
?My boys, Jim?s father can do that too ; but I
don?t want the ship. The son of my comrade is
of far more account to me than the Lucifer. We
can build another ship, and with some picked?
but not too clever ?men to help us we can make
fortunes many times over.?
? We?ll hae nae foreigners among us anyway,?
said Mac, brightening up considerably. ? But


listen, friends, till I male? ye acquainted wi? some-
thing that will put a spoke in the wheel o? the
other folk. Some years afore I went away I in-
vented one or two things that became vera famous,
ah? I made a lot o? money wi? the help o? a wealthy
partner who stood by me. But he didna live long,
and when he died I was swindled oot o? nearly a?
ma money, because we had nae written agreement
between us. However, I didna care vera much,
for I had just made a big discovery that I couldna
patent ; but that, as a secret, was worth a lot o?
money. But somehow the folks that did me oot
o? my share o? what our first patents made got
wind o? ma discovery an? tried all sorts o? dodges
to get it oot o? me. But I was as cute as them,
an? never breathed a word on the subject to ony-
body. At last they sent to me and said they were
prepared to pay a hundred thousand for the
discovery if it proved to be a? I claimed, and
asked me to meet them an? talk over the matter.
Noo, as I had never made any claims, nor even
mentioned what lines the discovery was on, I
suspected that their offer wasna straight, but as
I thought I was weel able to look after mysel?, I
met them as they asked. There were lots o? people
there, but the one who spoke to me most was a
wee Greek. He was a professor o? something or
other, an? a mind specialist, so some one told me.
I remember him asking me if my discovery really
solved the secret o? aerial navigation, but I dinna
mind what answer I gave him, nor anything else,
until I woke up yesterday in London an? found I
had been in some kind o? waking dream for six
years, and that my discovery was still known only
to myself?


? That was Valli?s work, Mac. He thought if he
could take your active memory away that you
might be readily hypnotised and made to tell him
everything.?
?It didna work anyway. You found me after
that, it seems, Chief, an? I became your chief
engineer.?
? Yes, Mac, I have the idea too that it was Valli
who told me of you, and advised my getting you
among us. Doubtless he thought that by persistent
effort he would get your secret. I have a sort of
dream idea that he was always asking you about
flying machines.?
? Weel, I kent nothing aboot flying machines,
so couldna tell him onything. Ma discovery was
a method by which I could halve the resistance of
water to any metallic or conducting body passing
through it, and, thanks to Valli for so kindly liftin?
the shutters o? my mind yesterday, that discovery
is goin? to mean the end o? him and the rest of
the gang as soon as we can put it into effect.?
? Jupiter ! ? ejaculated Southwood. ? Halving
the resistance of water against a ship?s side is
equal to multiplying the propelling power by
four ?
? Ay, and in a big ship a lot more, laddie.?
?Of course it is,? cried Fitzgerald. ? Halve
the resistance and the object will travel twice as
fast, and no power could drive, say, the Lusitania
or Mauretania through the water twice as fast as
they at present sail.?
? Are you sure of what you say, Mac? ? The
Chief was plainly incredulous.
? I?m sure o? making the resistance less, an?
it?s nearly a half ; but I canna guarantee the


exact decimal point. But I?ll no say that even if
the resistance is halved a ship will go twice as
fast; it looks like it, but maybe some undis-
covered law o? hydrostatics will come into play.
I?ll guarantee, though, that the ship we chase the
pirates in will run them oot o? water like a fast
cruiser runnin? doon a barnacle-covered tramp.?
? But she has enormous power behind her too,
Mac, and if they can apply the accelerator ? ?
? I don?t care what amount o? power they can
put into her screw ; as the laddie here said, no
possible amount o? H.P. can equal halving the
resistance.?
??Then we?ll get a boat built at once, Mac.
We?ll go and see the builders to-morrow. We?ll
get them to work night and day until it is
finished ?
? The boat?s built already, Chief.?
? What 1 How can that be? ?
? You forget we?ve lost our memories, Chief.
We werena sittin? idle waitin? for Valli cornin?, I
ken, an? here is proof that we?ve been workin?
hard.? He pulled a letter from an inner pocket.
? Now, ye?re a? tae keep cool,? he said, ? and
think as hard as ye can, but dinna speak.?
He then read :
? ? Dear Sir, ?As ordered by you the night you
left the island, I now post you the result of that
night?s work after your departure. The rivetters
finished the shell at 3 o?clock in the morning and
the caulkers completed the joints of sections 25
and 26. The fitters have the keel-pistons in place,
and during the night the keel itself was laid out.
Work proceeded as usual in the engine-room, but


the men are unable to turn out fast work as yet,
owing to the space being so much crowded with
the men of the other departments. I shall expect
you, with the owner, by train arriving at Oban
at 4.45 a.m. on Tuesday morning or Wednesday.
If you come by any day train wire me to the Station
Hotel ?I will keep a man there until you return ?
so that I may send the launch for you. Of course
to meet any day train the launch will go to Connel
Ferry, so as to avoid attention.
? ? Faithfully yours,
William Bell.? ?
Mac looked round to see the effect of the letter,
but no one seemed conscious that he had stopped.
Each was building a picture for himself.
? There?s a postscript which says,? went on Mac,
I am posting this as per instructions to Glasgow.
It should reach you before you leave for London.
Wire any instructions. ?W.B.? ?
? Well, Mac, it all sounds incomprehensible to
me, but I gather that somewhere near Oban you
have been building some weird kind of craft.
Doubtless we have both gone into the matter
before, but you know our strange predicament.
We?ll go north to-morrow. Can you boys make
anything out of the letter? ?
??lt is plain that Mr. Robertson has a large
staff of engineers and others working secretly at
some kind of ship near Oban,? said Southwood.
? But I can?t make head nor tail out of the part
which talks of keel-pistons. What is a keel-
piston? I never heard of such a thing. And then
the writer says, after describing the work com-
pleted on the shell ?hull he means, I suppose ?that


the keel itself was laid. I never heard of a vessel
whose keel wasn?t laid first.?
? There must be a lot of men employed,?
observed Fitzgerald. ?We may get a good job
if Mr. Robertson thinks we are able for it. By
Jupiter ! if Jim were only here now,?
? Of course, we mustn?t breathe a word of this
in the yard to-morrow,? said Southwood.
? Boys, you are not going to any yard to-
morrow,? the Chief put in. ? Your services are
required elsewhere. Tell your parents to-night
that your opportunity has come, and that, if they
do not object, you?ll take it. As for leaving your
regular work, I don?t suppose that that will hurt
your employers greatly. At any rate, I will call
round to-morrow and make matters right. But
we?ve talked enough. It?s work after this. I will
just add one thing : Learn to have confidence in
yourselves?that is the secret of success. Reason
a thing out, make up your mind, and go ahead.
When you are in a position of trust, take on the
responsibility, but also make sure you take com-
mand. Don?t let any one make you modify your
plans. That is all now. It?s nearly dinner-time.
Have dinner with us, then go home to your people ;
they will be getting anxious about you. We?ll go
up and see Mrs. Brown to-night?poor lady, she
feels as if she has lost her own son ; perhaps she
will allow us to take your comrade?s property in
charge, and we may find some indication of his
patent gas-plant specifications somewhere.?
? But, sir, are you really taking us into your
service? ? inquired Southwood ; it all seemed too
good to be true, and everything had come so
suddenly, that the boys were even yet afraid they


would awake and find all a dream. Ah ! but then
their comrade would be with them in that case.
? Not into our service, but into a sort of partner-
ship,? answered the Chief. ? I?ll pay you each five
pounds a week as pocket money until we are
earning profits, and then we?ll make other arrange-
ments. Meanwhile I don?t think you?ll find Mac
difficult to deal with as cashier if you want more
funds.?
The boys held their breath in wonderment.
?But we are not worth that money, sir,? cried
South wood. ? That amount is much more than
what we could earn as journeymen engineers.
And, anyhow, we?ll work to help our comrade for
nothing ?
? Boys, I believe you ; but all the same you will
be worth what money cannot purchase to me before
long, so meanwhile you?ll draw a salary. But
come along ; dinner is ready.?
After dinner the boys went home and astonished
their people with their strange tale ; but dwellers
by the banks of the Clyde are philosophical, and
very soon their parents accepted the idea of their
sons going to some unknown spot to work at a
mysterious ship as a matter of course, and so next
morning the boys reported themselves to the Chief
and Mac at the hotel, ready for whatever they were
told to do. The Herald that morning had two
separate items which interested them, but were
meaningless to its many thousand other readers.
One item reacl : ? Yesterday morning a window
of the shop in Buchanan Street occupied by Mr.
Southwood, the jeweller, was found by a constable
to be broken. Nothing of value was removed,
however, we are informed, and the police are in-


dined to the opinion that the window was broken
accidentally by a drunken man returning home
early in the morning.? The other paragraph, in
another part of the paper, was as follows : ??A
Lost Engineer.?On Saturday evening a young
engineer, named James Robertson, residing in
Hyndland Road, retired as usual to his rooms, but
early on Sunday morning his landlady made the
discovery that he had gone out through the window
during the night. Nothing has since been heard
of him, and his landlady, who is almost distracted,
tells an improbable story to the effect that the
young man has been kidnapped.?
? Shouldn?t we go and tell the Press the true
story, and point out the connection between these
two events? ? suggested Southwood.
? No,? answered the Chief. ? The Press cannot
help us, but publicity will only lead to our actions
being watched, and serve to warn the pirates that
we are on their track ?
? Come awa?, laddies, an? I?ll gie ye your work,?
broke in Mac hastily. ? The sooner we get started
the sooner these devils will be brought to book.
You go round the place, Bob, and buy where you
can get it two or three tons o? zinc either in sheet
or ingot, then gang to some chemical work an?
buy five hundred gallons o? sulphuric acid. Get
everything doon to some wharf on the Clyde side
as soon as ye can, and report to me when you?ve
managed it. And you, Harry, catch the first train
that leaves for Oban. Find out who William Bell
is an? all ye can aboot him, but on no account must
he ken. I?ll wire ye this afternoon to the Station
Hotel when we?re cornin? up, and ony further in-
structions. Meanwhile both of you laddies


remember if ye have to telegraph to either o? us
that ye must be careful. I think a good plan
would be to start wi? a dummy word, and then
make every alternate word a dummy too. We
could nearly make a message read exactly opposite
to what was meant by doing that ?
? Dear me, Mac,? broke in the Chief, ? that
system is not new to me. Where did I hear of
it before? ?
? I dinna ken, but I seem to be quite familiar
wi? it too. Here?s money, boys. Pay for every-
thing in cash, an? answer no questions aboot ony-
thing.?
The boys took the large sum Mac handed them
without comment. They were beginning to get
accustomed to their new environment. ?Ye can
settle up at the end o? the week, but ye must
always have money ready to act at once in
emergencies.?
The boys departed, and Mac said to the Chief :
? Noo we?ll have to concoct a telegram to William
Bell. It won?t do to let him ken we?ve forgotten
onything, so we?ll just appear to take everything
for granted when we get up there, an? use oor best
wits to get the hang o? things as soon as we can.?
? You are a remarkable engineer, Mac ; I am
in your hands at present.?
? Well, here?s what I propose to say : ? Meet
the train arriving 4.45 Tuesday morning. The
Chief is with me. ? Macpherson.?
? A moment, Mac. Just in case that code you
described to the boys is one of our dream affairs,
or one which you have already in use at the island,
let us arrange that message so that it will read
right in any way. Suppose we say : * Please meet


the train on arriving at 4.45 on Tuesday morning.
Have the Chief up with me. ? Macpherson,?
Now, supposing this manager of ours reads that
wire in the ordinary way it will mean the same as
if he, acting as may have been arranged, deletes
the first and every alternate word, as I have
emphasised. ?-
A good idea, Chief, but I intended the system
to be used to conceal our meaning. However,
we re in a position that doesna allow us to
dae as we like, so I'll send this off as you
have said.?
The message was despatched, and the two men
went out to make some purchases for themselves.
Early in the afternoon Bob came back and reported
that he had done his work, and an hour later a,
telegram was handed to Mac. Opening it he read :
Don t come train before to-morrow morning.
Not serious.?W.B.?
? What in thunder does that mean, Chief? ? he
asked. ?We distinctly said we were travelling
by the morning train.?
Perhaps you have a code between you which
altered the meaning. Ah ! Apply your own code,
Mac. Why, it now reads : ? Come before morning.
Serious - Just then another message was
handed to Mac. ? Things are getting lively,? he
muttered. ? Hallo ! this one is from the laddie :
? Have made no important real discovery. Hard-
ship all finished, no danger now.?H.S.? ?
Hardship all finished.? WEat does that
mean? ? mused the Chief.
Why, hardship is really two words,? exclaimed
Fitzgerald. ?Harry couldn?t get another word
for ship.?


?You?re right, laddie,? spoke Mac. ?There?s
more trouble in front o? us, I can see. This
message reads to us : ? Made important discovery.
Ship finished. Danger.? ?
? Well, Mac, I vote we go right into that danger
at once. Send a wire to both Bell and the boy
that we?re coming to-night. I see there?s a train
leaving Glasgow at 4.45 p-ni. ?half an hour from
now ?which gets into Oban at 8.54 to-night.?
? All right, Chief. If there?s danger it means
that we?ve a chance o? meeting some o? our auld
friends, an? that is a big enough inducement for
me. Gang on to the station?Buchanan Street
Station the Oban train leaves from ?an? I?ll follow
directly.?
Thus it was that as the wintry darkness fell over
the hills the Chief, Mac, and Bob were rushing
northwards, five hours in advance of the night
train they had at first intended travelling by. They
reached Connel Ferry, the last station before Oban,
at half-past eight, and were just about to depart
again when a figure, hatless and breathless, and
covered with blood, burst into the compartment.
? Come out, quick 1? it gasped. ? The gang is
here, and they?ve got all our telegrams. They
are going to stop this train somewhere and murder
you all ?
? Why, it is Harry,? cried Bob'. ? What has
happened to you? ?
? Oh, don?t wait. Come out now,? his comrade
implored. ? I cycled from Oban to warn you, but
they tripped me up about four miles back and shot
at me when I got on my feet to run. I got
through, though,? he added proudly.
By this time all were on the platform, and next

moment the train left the station. ? Now, boy,
explain,? said the Chief.
??No time just now, sir. Mr. Bell will be on
the beach with a launch in five minutes. See !
there is his signal now. We are going straight
to your ship, the Nemesis; it is ready for
launching.?
? But I don?t understand. How do you happen
to know Mr, Bell already? ?
? He used to be an engineer in the same yard
with Jim, Bob, and me. We recognised each other
when I got off my train. He was in the station
watching some one. While walking along the
esplanade I saw the Baltic Prince sail slowly into
the bay, and then I was forced to tell him that I
served the same masters as he did, and that the
Baltic Prince meant danger to them. Afterwards
things came on so fast that we had to work
together, and it was under his orders that I
attempted to cycle through to get you off the train.
This is his launch coming in now ?
??l am glad you have arrived, gentlemen,? a
voice called out from the approaching boat. 4 ? I
don?t know your plans, and things here call for
action at once.? The boat ran up on the beach,
and a man of about thirty years of age stepped
out. He shook hands with Mac without any hesi-
tation, and was then introduced by the latter to
the Chief. He knew Harry at once, and smiled
as he shook hands with him. ?So the old shop
is following me,? he said. ? I hope, young man,
that you have some sense now, and have become
more like Robertson. I suppose he is manager of
a department or he would be here with you ; you
three were always inseparable.?


? Robertson is a prisoner in the hands of the
people we are working against,? said the Chief,
? and the first work of the Nemesis is to rescue
him.?
? Well, gentlemen, if you will get in I will push
off,? said Mr. Bell. ?We have little enough time,
and I calculate we have two hours? sail in front
of us.?
? But is the craft really finished? ? asked Mac,
as they left the shore, hoping to gain additional
information.
? Yes, sir ; last night?s shift completed the shell,
and she is ready for slipping into the water. But
it seems, gentlemen, that your enemies have some
agents among our men, and I expect an attempt
will be made by them to-night to launch the hip.
That strange craft that came into Oban Bay this
afternoon will then take her in tow, I suppose ;
which I hardly think is in your programme. How-
ever, you are here yourselves now, and can give
your orders.?
? But how did our?well, we?ll say friends
get to know we were coming, and why have they
not made their presence known bef�rre? ? asked
the Chief.
Bell shook his head. ? Can?t say, sir,? he said.
? My business was to get the Nemesis ready in the
shortest possible time, and I concluded you could
watch your enemies?if you had any ?yourselves.
Of course, when they threatened my work I had
to look round a bit, and I find that they are swarm-
ing in Oban?mostly foreigners, I think, but they
are there all the same. They must have some
system of tapping the wires, for evidently they got
all our messages, and saw through our code. But


yonder is our island, gentlemen. Round that first
corner is the land-locked bay on the shores of
which awaits the Nemesis .?
The Chief and Mac continued to question Mr,
Bell, and thereby gathered much information as
to what had been their plans before their mis-
fortune, and were also enabled to bring some
pictures out of their dream mind and place them
in the light of actualities.
In time they entered the bay, and soon after
landed at a little jetty.
? All the men?s houses are at the other side of
the island, sir, as you probably know,? said Mr,
Bell to the Chief. But the Chief diplomatically
said he knew nothing except what he had been
told on the launch, and what Mac had informed
him in a general way.
? Mr. Macpherson would not allow the men to
be near the ship when not working on her,? Mr.
Bell went on, ? so we had to build their barracks
on the other side. There were always two shifts
off duty and one on, but the external work being
finished now, I have only some picked men on to-
night as watchmen.?
?You have done your duty remarkably well,
Mr. Bell,? said the Chief, ? and you shall certainly
not lose by that ?
? Oh dear, no, sir, I have only carried out Mr.
Macpherson?s orders. I couldn?t have done this
myself. ?-
Mac grinned quietly. ?I?m glad to hear I?ve
been doing something,? he muttered ; then aloud
he said : ? I?ll no? allow ye to belittle yourself,
Mr. Bell, ye have done what nae other man that
I ken could dae. But show the Chief the boat
noo?, an? then we?ll get ready for oor friends ?


They were standing at the base of a huge rock
which rose almost vertically from the beach.
? Then, sir, there is your ship,? said Bell, and
as he spoke part of the rock seemed to rise in
front of them, disclosing a long dark tunnel lead-
ing into the heart of the mountain. Bell then felt
with his hand for some object, and next moment
a flood of light from innumerable electric lamps
filled the cavern, and showed a strange object
resting at a slight angle, stretching back as far
as they could see. With an effort, the Chief and
Mac subdued all signs of astonishment, but not
so the boys, and it was some time before they got
their excitement worked off sufficiently to allow
them to take in what lay before them. They were
looking at a long tubular structure which seemed
about two hundred feet in length and about sixteen
feet in diameter. From a point about forty feet
from both ends the tube began to taper conewise,
terminating in a shaft of solid steel which pro-
jected from stem and stern about six feet. A
vertical finlike series of steel plates was suspended
underneath the shell by means of heavy tubing,
and a railed platform, which could fold, ran round
the central part of the top of the vessel. A bul-
warked dome rose from the centre, and several
manhole doors were let into the structure, which
was also well pierced with wire-glass ports. The
whole thing was coloured a dark brown, evidently
so as to be as unnoticeable as possible.
? Gentlemen,? cried Mr. Bell, ? you have seen
the outside of the Nemesis. Now we?ll explore
her inner mysteries. Great powers 1 Have I gone
mad? Am I dreaming ? ?
The Nemesis had suddenly begun to move.


Slowly at first, then faster and faster, she glided
past the startled onlookers, until with a plunge she
entered the water. Then she swung round and
drifted helplessly but gracefully, and exactly on
the lines marked on her hull, out into the bay.


CHAPTER V
THE CHIEF BECOMES HIMSELF AGAIN
At first the Chief and Mac thought that the sud-
den launching of the Nemesis was part of Mr.
Bell?s programme of surprises ; but that gentle-
man?s actions soon dispelled that idea.
? She is stolen !? he cried wildly. ? After her,
men, in the launches. Quick ! or she?ll be out
into the open,?
About a score of men who had been staring in
astonishment at the vessel suddenly came to their
senses, and with shouts of anger rushed down to
the water side. And now could be heard the
sound of engines revolving at high speed, and a
deadly fear struck both the Chief and Mac to
the heart. Had they come only to see that they
had built a vessel with which they might run their
enemies off the ocean? Better had they not seen
it if it were now in the hands of those powerful
men.
From the vessel, still drifting, the whirr of
machinery sounded louder and louder, but boats
and petrol launches were closing round from all
sides.
? She?ll run those small craft down,? cried the


Chief ; and simultaneously Southwood cried,
?Where?s Bob??
?Ha ! ha ! ? laughed Bell loudly, ? but this is
the best joke that ever came my way.?
? Poor fellow, he?s lost his reason,? said the
Chief. ? Come, Mac, we?ll make a try to board
her anyway.?
? Stay where you are, gentlemen,? cried Bell,
throwing round a switch which caused a search-
light to play on the waters ; ?I am not mad ;
but the thieves who stole that boat will be by
this time ?
? Why is she not moving? ? cried Southwood.
? She is not tied up, and her engines are running
themselves red hot.?
? Because,? Bell laughed hysterically, the per-
spiration streaming from his face, ? her propellers
are not keyed on? The man sat down. ? I
thought the owner would like to hammer in the
keys which would complete his ship himself,? he
continued, ? and the engines have run away with
the unloaded shafting only.?
A light dawned upon the Chief and Mac.
?Then we?ll yet catch her,? Mac cried. ?A
hundred pounds to the man who is on board her
first,? he shouted over the waters. ? Quick, men,
the thieves are jumping off her.?
? And a hundred pounds for every thief caught,?
shouted the Chief, jumping into a boat and pulling
out to the drifting craft. A loud cheer came in
reply, and a dozen men clambered on board over
a rope ladder that had been left hanging from the
central part of the ship when it was launched.
Next moment an anchor splashed into the sea,
and when the rattling of its chains ceased, the
ship?s engines had also stopped.


? Why, there?s no one on board 1 ? cried a man
coming out of the conning tower.
? They must be hiding in the darkness,? 1 cried
another ; ?get lights, somebody.?
? Who stopped the engines? ? asked the Chief,
passing through the bulwarked deck entrance.
? I did, sir,? came a voice from the dark in-
terior ; ? but I am afraid I have killed the thief
who was engineer ?
? Why, Bob, is that you? ? cried the Chief, as
some one approached with a light. ? How did
you get on board??
? I jumped on board when she slid past us, sir.
I was standing beside the ladder when she began to
move, and I wanted to be on board when she took
the water.?
Men were now pouring into the engine-room,
and, as the apartment was lit up, they beheld
a boy with pale face and set teeth standing by
the hot but still engines. Lying across the thrust-
block couplings of the starboard shaft was a man.
There was an ugly bruise on his head, from which
blood was gushing freely. Partly resting on his
body, and partly on the shaft, was a blood-stained
engineer?s chipping hammer.
? He?s not dead,? announced the Chief, bending
over him. ? Take him on shore and attend to
him. Who is he? ?
? He?s not one of our men,? said Bell, swinging
through the entrance door. ? I never saw that
man before.?
? His companions have escaped, 1 ? spoke the
Chief quietly ; ? search the whole island, men,
and for every person you bring to me, except my
two boy comrades, who is a stranger among you,
I will pay a hundred pounds.?


? Where is the other boy, sir? - asked one of
the men, as they departed. A revolver shot rang
out from the shore, and a voice cried : ? Help I
Help I I?ve caught one of the thieves.?
? That is the other one,? said the Chief, ? go
and secure the prisoner.?
When all but Mr. Bell had departed the Chief
turned to Bob, who was still standing by the en-
gines, and said : ? Now, Bob', your story.?
? There isn?t any, sir,? replied the boy. ? When
I heard the engines start I knew something was
wrong, and entered this room through that door
overhead. It was very dark, though, and I was
just striking a light when a man caught me and
threw me among the shafting. Luckily I fell clear
of everything, and knowing now that some despe-
rate game was afoot, I groped until I found that
hammer, and aimed it at the man?s head. I could
just make it out as he bent over among the valve
gearing. When I heard him fall I ran forward
and stopped the engines, and that is all.?
?Do you know anything about this type of
engine, Fitzgerald? ? Bell asked. ? I didn?t think
there were any in the old yard. Suction-gas is
not very common yet.?
? Oh, Harry and I know all about it. We
worked at nights with Jim Robertson helping him
to build his model. It was an improvement on
that type, but he had also an accelerator which
he invented ?
? We?ve got what Mr. Macpherson calls an ac-
celerator here, too, but no one but himself knows
anything about it, and we are now ready for
him to fit in his apparatus. By the old Clyde,
though ! wasn?t it lucky the propellers were slack


on the shafts? But what are your orders now,
sir? Shall we pull her on shore, or leave her
anchored? ?
? I think she is better where she is in the mean-
time. Put a strong watch of men whom you can
trust implicitly on board. I am going ashore to
see who our prisoners are. Bob, you can stay
here until Mac or I take you away, and shoot any
man who enters this apartment. Mr, Bell, you
will give orders that no man must go into the
engine-room under any circumstances.?
? You?ll find me here, sir, no matter what hap-
pens,? Bob answered ; and knowing that the
boy meant what he said, the Chief and Bell went
on shore. Mr. Bell then picked out a score of
men, and made them responsible for the safety
of the Nemesis, telling them at the same time
that the engine-room was not to be entered unless
they wished to be shot. He then led the Chief
to a little house built into the rock near the cave
in which the Nemesis had been constructed. ??Mr.
Macpherson and I live here,? he remarked, ? we
are thus on the spot always. Hallo ! I see
they?ve taken the wounded man in. Shall we send
him over to a doctor? ?
? No,? said the Chief grimly, ? I will doctor
him, but I want his story first.?
They entered the house. Mac, Harry, and
several men stood round the wounded engineer,
and another man who was bound with what must
have been about a hundred yards of rope, and then
fastened to a length of anchor chain, at the other
end of which was a heavy anchor. Clearly he had
but a poor chance of escaping. The engineer
had now regained his senses, thanks to Mac?s ad-

ministration ; he was sitting on the ground, but
his bandaged head and ghastly white face showed
that Bob?s hammer had struck no light blow.
? Who is that gentleman, Mac? ? inquired the
Chief, indicating the bound man with a nod.
? What was he doing? Who caught him, and what
has he to say? ?
? That?s the fellow who started the launching
machinery,? answered Mac ; ?he was just skulk-
ing oot frae among the cradle timbers when the
laddie saw him an? asked him to stop. He wouldna
though, an? rushed on the laddie instead. But
that was were he did wrang, for Harry just sent
a bullet into his leg ?it was a good shot for a
fellow no used to firearms ?and when he fell
jumped on him and held him by the windpipe
until I got along. I havena asked for his cre-
dentials yet, as I thought you micht like to dae
that yourself.?
?You were right, Mac ; I want to ask a few
questions.?
?No good,? interrupted the bound man, sul-
lenly ; ? you can a put me in calaboose but I no?
tell one word. You no? seem to know me, Chief?
The Chief and Mac started. ? I certainly do
not. But you are not going to any calaboose.
We have a quicker way of dealing with your kind,
and no one will ever hear of it. You observe that
switchboard on the opposite wall? I believe it
is the main control board of the entire electric
current used on this island ?
? We have two systems, sir,? broke in Bell,
dimly grasping the Chief?s meaning ; ? two of
these terminals complete the day current, but the
other two are in connection with the night
dynamos.?


? But you can run both at the same time if
necessary? - asked the Chief.
? Oh, certainly, but we would have to remove
the switch lever.?
? Exactly what I intend to do. When I tell you,
start both night and day dynamos. We shall then
establish a parallel circuit by means of this gen-
tleman?s body. Tie one hand to each of those
two terminals and a bare foot to each of the
corresponding ones. I have often desired to watch
the reflex movements of the nerves under a strong
current. ?
? You no? watch mine, Chief. I haf not got
nerve in my body. Ha 1 ha ! ? laughed the man
gaily, ? I can tell a better way than dat to kill
me if you want ?
? Proceed, then.?
??You plant me inside a tank of petrol and set
a fire to it ?
? Here, shut up, you blamed greaser 1 ? roared
Mac. ? This poor beggar has fainted. He hasna
got an appetite like you.? Mac referred to the
wounded engineer.
? I belong Italia,? interrupted the man,
haughtily, ? I am not a greaser ! ?
? Why not chuck the beggar into the sea with
some fire-bars for sinkers, and be done with him? ?
suggested Bell. His face gave no sign whether he
knew that the Chief was in earnest or not.
? Na, na,? put in Mac, ? that would be wastry.
Let us put him in ane o? the hoppers in the boat
an? make suction-gas wi? him. There?s nae use
in bein? cruel.?
? As you please/-? said the man with a sickly
grin ; ??l haf played my cards and lost, while you
haf the nap hand.?


? Let the poor beggar go,? said the Chief ;
? somebody give him a thrashing, then put him
on the mainland somewhere.?
?Ah ! you are the cowards,? hissed the prisoner
furiously ; ? you no kill me when you haf a
chance. You insult me with a ?a whipping, be-
cause you haf de numbers. Take good care you
haf plenty men, or see me well tied, or I might
hurt some of you.?
? Cut the fellow loose, men ; I will thrash him
myself, and whatever the result may be, put him
ashore in the morning.?
? What 1 You gif me a chance, Chief? ? gasped
the Italian. ? I?l?no like ?
? Let me attend to him, Chief,? cried Mac ;
? I?ll gie him a? he wants.?
? And am I to go free? ? asked the man, read-
ing surprised displeasure on the faces of all around.
They had not anticipated such soft-hearted foolish-
ness.
? Yes, you may go free. We are not murderers,
and we are British. Cut him out.?
In a few minutes the men had set him free of his
bonds, and, cramped and stiff, he staggered to his
feet, the men forming a circle round him.
? When you feel able to defend yourself let me
know,? said the Chief.
? No, sir,? shouted the Italian, ? I will not fight
now. lam one free man. lam a gentleman. I,
Antonio, will tell my Chief all he wants to know.?
? Good old Italia 1 ? cried Harry, and the men
gave vent to a cheer.
? I thought you would, Antonio,? said the Chief.
? You may go, men. Mr. Bell, if you can beach
the Nemesis stern first, do so, and key up her
propellers ?


? But are you safe, sir? These foreigners are
treacherous devils.?
?Not always, Mr. Bell ; I have had consider-
able experience among them. Now, Signor An-
tonio, I am not going to ask you anything that
will commit either yourself or those to whom you
belong. You are a gentleman, and I will trust
to your honour to tell me truly ; if I ask a question
that seems to you to be probing into affairs which
you are bound to keep from me, just say so, and
I shall not press the point. Is that fair? ?
?It is, my Chief. I shall answer you as one
gentleman to another.?
? You know me? ?
? Surely, sir ; you were the Chief of the Cos-
mopolites until six months ago, and Mac, with
Hassenrahn, were your lieutenants
? Noo tae replenish ma memory,? muttered
Mac ; and Southwood, perceiving what the Chief?s
object was, listened intently, inwardly noting all
names mentioned.
? Well, then. Signor, tell me what, in your
opinion, the Cosmopolites were while under my
chieftainship.?
? A band of scientists, sir. But if you would ?
a ?so very kindly, sir, order him to be taken away,
it would ?a ?be more ?a ?pleasant for me to
speak.? He pointed to the unconscious engineer
?who, just at that moment, came round again.
? I vill tell all,? he exclaimed. ? Haf mercy
upon me, unt I vill tell eferythink.?
The Italian?s lips curled in scorn. ?He is a
Polish Jew,? he said ; ? you can find out every-
thing from him now. He is not one of the old
Cosmopolites that you knew. He is one disgrace.?


THE CHIEF BECOMES HIMSELF AGAIN 113
I do not wish to hear the story of a person
who speaks to save himself from trouble, Signor.
I would much rather talk with a man who laughed
at danger to himself, and who volunteers what
he says. Take that person into the next room,
Mac, and give him a drug which will make him
sleep for some hours. Did we break any of the
laws of nations, Signor? ?
No, my Chief, you would not allow that. We
sailed into the Sargasso Sea and much treasure
got from?a?ships that were there for long time.
We sailed far away south, and took much silver
from islands far down in the Antarctic Ocean.
Then we sail all over the world inventing and per-
fecting many things, and making money at what-
ever we tried. It was then, as you will remember,
that?a?Mac discovered his, what he call him?
his power accelerator, and then old Lucifer become
the fastest boat on the ocean ?
? And then? ?
? Why, and then our time was up. We had all
agreed to come with you for six years, and you
would not have us wait any more. That was what
caused the trouble. We wanted to continue, you did
not. We knew we could make millions many times
by robbing ships at sea, and by making money
of all de countries that have big high value silver
coins. You say, ? No, we will break up.? Has-
senrahn, he say, ? You fool ; we do it ourselves ?
You say ? Vary well, do it. I take my ship to mine-
self. He say ? Ship we keep.? You say him liar.
Then we all fight, an? you disappear. We think
you drowned, until one day we sail into Greenock
on de Clyde, to pass lot of counterfeit money, and
hear that some people haf bought a leetle island
8


somewhere, on which they are building one ship.
We become curious, and soon find out it is you.
I know no more. We leave Greenock after dis-
guising our ship one night, and come up here, and
it fell to me and some others to try to steal the
ship. Of course, we know all about it, for we
have many men working for you.?
? What about that boy you kidnapped, Signor?
Where have you put him, and what are your inten-
tions regarding him? ?
? Oh, he most clever engineer, same as Mac.
Hassenrahn and some of the other heads of the
Cosmopolites find him out. He know same thing
as you and Mac know about making boat go faster.
Hassenrahn send down to ship on Saturday for
Major, the nigger, to come up with a rope to steal
him. He think if he get the boy you not get?a?
him, and then Valli?a?but that I must not tell.?
? Certainly not, Signor, if you do not wish to.
But I know all about Valli. He was to meet Mac
and me, and, by means of that mysterious drug
which he has discovered, take our memories away,
and then of course our secret power would be for-
gotten, while you people would have it through the
stolen boy.?
? That is true, Chief. But Valli boast too much.
He say he did it in London. He liar as well as
boaster ? ? �
?Hal ha ! that is a good joke. Do we look
as if we had forgotten anything, Signor? -
?It no look like from your wires to-day?l
mean yesterday?which we read.?
? Ah, yes, how did you manage that business? ?
? That I cannot tell, sir. One of de Cosmopo-
lites made one discovery. When we knew you


were coming up by train arriving Tuesday morning,
and that your foreman would be awaiting you,
we say through de night is de time to do our
work, so come over in small boat when dark and
get hid by our people, an? when de rock open as
we had arranged, why, I start de hydraulic rams.
De ship go. I try to get away. Am shot by this
boy. To my much surprise, you come along, and
I know de game is all up. Den I see him with
big smash on head, and know he must have made
one big mistake, for which we both have to pay.
But how did you manage to get here, Chief? Has-
senrahn and the others \vere so sure that they had
you every way that he and two of the men went
to one grand ball on shore. He expects to see
your ship along?a?side of de Lucifer when he
gets back in de morning.?
??Ah, does he?? The Chief rose. ??Well,
Signor, I will ask you no more, and I am sure you
will give me credit for not troubling you with
questions which you might feel in honour bound
not to answer. Mac, see that the gentleman is put
ashore on the mainland at daylight in the morning.
Send the other fellow, too. We have no need for
such as he. Come, boy. Good morning, Signor.?
The Chief walked out of the house, followed by
Harry, but they had not gone more than a few
steps when Mac overtook them. 0
??What game is on?? he demanded. ?What
are ye goin? to do that I canna do? ?
? Mac,? said the Chief affectionately, ? we have
to-night filled up many blanks in our memories,
and materialised a few dreams. But to ensure
that a catastrophe which might wreck all our
plans will not occur again, we must so contrive


that we two never take part in the same adventure.
One of us will then always be left to ?
? An? what adventure are ye goin? to hae to-
night? Hae we no? had enough? ?
? I am going to make an attempt to bring you
your son, Mac No, don?t speak. Your place
is here. Every thing and person on this island
is in your charge, and you alone I hold respon-
sible. Send Mr. Bell to me, and mount a guard
over your prisoners till morning.?
Mac departed without a word, and the Chief
and Harry walked down to the beach, where, a
minute later, Mr. Bell joined them. ? Ah, Mr.
Bell,? said the Chief, as he came near, ? I am
under a deep obligation to you for the manner in
which you have looked after my interests, and
especially for your work to-night in my behalf.
Please notify the men that they will each receive
a bonus of five pounds with their wages this week.
And as for yourself, I do not know your salary,
but it is doubled. Now, I wish you to send to
me two of the strongest men you have, that you
can personally guarantee.?
? There is your man by that launch over there.
And, sir, I do not require to be paid extra for
doing my duty. I cannot accept the increase in
my salary.?
? My dear fellow, it is really not an increase.
You were undervalued from the start, and this is
merely the difference made up. But I asked for
two men ?two strong, reliable men who do not
care for a few possible hard knocks, and who are
willing to take part in a risky adventure.?
? Sir, I believe after Tom Munroe over there
that I myself am the strongest man on the island.
I will be your second man.?


? But there may be danger.?
? Well, I am used to that.?
? We are going to break the law of the country,
perhaps.?
? There are some laws, sir, higher than our
country?s laws, and I am sure that it will be in
carrying out some such law that you will break
the other. I am coming, sir.?
? All right, then. Call that man over and I
will explain. Meanwhile, boy, get that boat into
the water, and see if you can find some biscuits
somewhere. We must all be hungry, as it is
now six hours since we came off the train.?
Thus it came about that at four o?clock that
morning, when the Great Western Regatta Club?s
ball broke up, three gentlemen in evening dress,
walking along the coast road out of Oban, were
suddenly attacked by another three men, and after
a fierce struggle bound hand and foot, and carried
off the roadway. ?Go back into town, now,?
said one of the attackers to his companions, ? and
patrol it till morning, keeping a close look-out for
any of our own men. Any one you see on shore
is a traitor. We will come for you at daylight.?
? Hadn?t we better gag these fellows first? ?
suggested one of the men.
?No, leave them as they are, so that they can
draw the attention of the first morning passers
by-
? I say, you people,? called out one of the
prostrate men, ? just mention the sum of money
you hope to get out of us, and I?ll send for it
at once.? He spoke with a trace of a German
accent.
? Oh, we don?t want money or we would relieve


you all of those diamonds you sport in your shirt-
fronts,? said the Chief. ? And, by the way, Has-
senrahn, you are really a bungler, \ou leave too
much to chance ever to make a good chief.?
? Who are you? ? gasped the astonished Ger-
man, rolling round on the ground so as to face
the speaker.
? I?m one of the men who forgot ; but excuse
us leaving you, we?ve important business on hand.?
Two of the men now turned towards the town ;
but the third walked the opposite way for about a
hundred yards and then whistled, and in answer
to his signal a petrol launch, in which sat a youth,
raced shoreward out of the gloom.
? Everything went as I expected,? the man said
to the boy, as he stepped on board. ? Turn that
light this way a moment until I make some changes
in my adornments.?
Meanwhile, out on the waters at the extreme
southern end of the bay lay the Baltic Prince . She
looked like a heavy water-logged craft, yet
strangely enough she danced on the very slight
shore swell as a graceful bird might do. On her
decks men paced up and down, keeping careful
watch, and lights shone from several portholes
in different parts of the vessel.
In one of the lighted cabins a young man sat,
deep in thought. ?It is really very funny,? he
remarked aloud, at length, ? and if I hadn?t got so
much evidence to the contrary, I should say I was
dreaming. I wonder what Bob and Harry would
think if they heard my story. I suppose they
would miss me in the yard to-day, or, rather,
yesterday, for the first time, and call round in the
evening to see what was wrong. By Jupiter I


They?ll think I?ve sold the idea of the gas-plant
and cleared out. Now, what really happened?
The German Prince, or whatever he was, and a
big black man called to see me late on Saturday
night. They offered to buy my patent, and when
I told them it was not a patent but merely a dis-
covery I had made, they offered to pay me a
thousand pounds for the secret. I forget what
happened after that, but this morning I awoke and
found myself in bed in a comfortable ship?s cabin,
and out at sea. A Chinaman brought me a first-
class breakfast, and told me he was my servant ;
but he either didn?t understand or wouldn?t answer
my questions. Then the German who had offered
to buy my secret came in, and told me not to be
afraid. Well, I wasn?t afraid, and told him that,
at which he laughed and said : ? Most people
would be.? In answer to my questions he then
told me that they had kidnapped me really in my
own interests, and counted out a thousand pounds
in gold before my eyes as payment for my secret.
I told him to keep his money and put me on shore
at once, and he again laughed. ?We won?t do
that,? he said, 4 because your secret is wanted
by other people who would give a good deal to
get it.? I then said that if I sold the information
to him I couldn?t sell it a second time, and his
answer was : 4 We?ll make sure of that by making
you as our guest for a trip to the Cape.? Well, I
wouldn?t mind a trip to the Cape if Bob and Harry
were with me, or if I could send them word that
I was not really running away. However, we?re
not off to the Cape yet, and I could almost swear
that is Oban over there. There can?t be two
towns built on bays like this. I remember com-


ing to Oban long ago with my father, but we
travelled all night, and why, there?s a train?s
whistle now. Of course this is Oban, and that
is the very same morning train coming in from
Glasgow and Edinburgh ?
? Well, youngster, have you made up your mind
whether you are to become a Cosmopolite or not? ?
A voice broke in on Jim?s musings, and looking
up, the boy saw a Japanese, dressed in an elaborate
naval uniform, standing before him. The man
had a kindly face, the boy thought, and thinking
he might get some information, he said :
? I take it that that is the name the people on
this funny ship sail under? ?
? And we deserve it. We number about two
hundred, afloat and ashore, and we have repre-
sentatives from every race on earth. But I hear
the Chief?s launch coming now. He?s a terror
when he is roused, so I would advise you to give
up your secret and throw in your lot with us.
He means to sail at once after coming on board.?
?If I don?t tell what my accelerating power is,
what will happen? ?
? Oh, nothing much ; but you?ll be a prisoner
instead of a guest, and only give yourself a bad
time for nothing. But, boy, what is your name?
You are the image of a great friend of mine.?
? James Robertson, sir. May I ask yours, and
what your place is here? ?
? I am the Marquis Ikato, and I am chief navi-
gator on board. I had almost made certain your
name was Macpherson ; you have no near relative
that name, have you? ?
?No, sir, I don?t think I have any relative
alive of any name, and I have only two friends in


the whole world ?Harry Southwood and Bob Fitz-
gerald ; and if they were here we would join any
band so long as we were not expected to do any-
thing beneath the honour of a Briton.?
? Ah, you see we are Cosmopolites. We do not
recognise the honour of an Englishman as being
any more than that of, say, a Japanese. But
the Chief?s launch is at the gangway. Do what
he asks, my boy, and don?t be foolish. Any way,
if you?ll allow me, I?ll be your third friend for
the sake of your resemblance to old Mac. I must
get on deck.?
He ran away, and, listening, Jim heard a petrol
launch shoot past under his porthole and come
to a stop at where he guessed was a lowered
gangway. Next minute there was some commo-
tion on deck, and he heard some one ask where
he was.
? In ze room nombair tree,? some one answered.
? You gave ze ordair he was to be stayed there.?
? Certainly, I had forgotten. No, don?t raise
the gangway ; I?m going on shore again.?
?Not that way, sir. That companion has been
shut up since ze old Chief left.?
? Confound you, then 1 Lead the way. Can?t
you see I?m not used to these liquid fire drinks
of Scotland? ? Some mutterings followed, and
then footsteps approached the cabin.
? So I have to deal with a man who has been
sampling Scotch drinks,? Jim muttered ; ? well,
he needn?t think he?ll bully me. I?ve met drunk
men before.?-?
Just then the two men entered the room.
? Thanks, you may go now,? said the man who
had just come on board, ? and next time remem-


ber that the drink of the Scots goes to the head
as well as to the feet.?
? I shall nevair forget, sir,? answered the man,
departing with a salute.
The newcomer closed the cabin door and then
turned and gazed straight at Jim for a full minute.
? The very image,? he muttered ; then in tones
in which were no signs of the effect of Scotch or
any other drink he said : ? Well, my boy, I sup-
pose you are in a hurry to leave your prison? ?
? No, sir, I can?t call it a prison. I have been
well treated, and, on the whole, have enjoyed the
experience. If you would only arrange so that
two-thirds of this money be paid to Harry South-
wood and Bob Fitzgerald I would not mind going
with you to the Cape and letting you have my
discovery.?
So they have treated you well? I am glad
of that.?
? Certainly, sir, I have never been so well
treated since I lost my father, and one in my
position can appreciate things.?
? James, prepare yourself for a surprise, and
don?t make a sound, I am not Hassenrahn, the
present chief of this gang ; I left him lying bound
on the beach. I am your father?s friend, and
I have come to take you to him.?
? What 1 My father, did you say? Please do
not joke with me on that subject ?
?It is true. The story is too long to tell here,
so get ready and come away with me. Your com-
rade Southwood is in a launch at the gangway
waiting to take us off. See, lam disguised.? He
pulled off his German-like turned-up moustache
and showed his clean-shaven face. At that

moment the door flew open, and a man with a
revolver extended in his hand standing in the en-
trance laughed loudly. ? Donner unt blitzen ! ~
he cried ; ? you must vas forget dat dis ship has
got mooch changed since you left her. Dis room
is von big microphone, unt I invented it. I heard
efery word you said, unt now hands oop, or I vill
blow the top off your head.-?
? All right, Dutchy,? interrupted the Chief.
? As you say, I have forgotten many things, and
one of them is who you are.?
? Hands oop unt say less.?
The Chief threw up his hands, but in his right
was a tiny weapon, which, as the hand came in
a line with the Dutchman?s extended arm, spat
out a leaden pellet the size of a pea. But it did
its work : the ball struck the Dutchman s pistol
hand, and he dropped his weapon with a howl.
Throwing himself upon him before he had time
to recover from his shock, the Chief gripped him
by the throat and dashed him against the opposite
side of the alley-way.
But now, alarmed by the pistol shot, men were
rushing from all quarters.
? Better luck next time, Jim,? cried the Chief ;
? do anything you can to ensure comfort for your-
self. We are on your track, and also your two
comrades.? He sprang into an adjoining cabin
as several men came rushing forward.
? After him, boys I cried the Dutchman. ?He
has shust gone.?
?Who?? cried the men. ?Who fired that
shot? We?re not going to allow even the boss
to have target practice on board.?
?It vas no boss ; it vas our old Chief, unt he
has shust left our boss tied oop on shore.?


? Here is another launch coming alongside,?
cried some one on deck. ? Hallo ! there?s some
game on. The Chief?s on board already. Stop,
there. Who are you? ?
? Lower that gangway, you fool,? came the
reply ; ? can?t you see? We have been attacked
on shore by a gang. Anything happened? ?
\es, you came on board about fifteen minutes
back ?
Ah ! then we have him now,? cried one of
the men from the launch ; ? all the ports are
barred, he can?t go through them.?
?Nor does he intend to,? muttered the Chief,
leaving his shelter and running on deck, where
he crouched amidst the shadows.
?The men came on board. ?Haul up the
gangway now,? said Hassenrahn ; ? everything is
now in our hands, and we can start for the Cape.
If they had gagged us they would have won, but
now the trumps are with us,?
? Are you sure, sir? ? asked the Marquis Ikato.
? Quite ; but Mohammed, who has been sha-
dowing them all the time, reported to-night that
Valli?s work was really accomplished. Another
agent informed me that they?ve only ordinary gas
engines in their craft, and that although they didn?t
get off with it to-night, she?ll be at the bottom of
a hundred fathoms of water before morning. And
he?s on board. Ha ! ha ! ?
? He was, but not now,? muttered the Chief,
taking a header into the sea ; ? I?ll see that you
are well gagged the next time.?
The disguised Baltic Prince began to move, a
whistle sounded out over the water, and soon a
launch shot from the darkness, and the Chief
climbed on board.


CHAPTER VI
MAC?S PATENT
The belated dawn of a winter morning was just
stealing over the land when the Chief and South-
wood regained the island. All the men were
waiting, for those left in charge during the night
would not leave without orders, and the day-shift
men had also appeared for their day?s work. The
latter contingent knew nothing of the proceedings
during the night, and great was their amazement
and indignation when the facts were made known
to them. Nor had they yet seen the man for whom
they had just finished such a peculiar vessel, and
when the launch darted round the sheltering pro-
montory into the bay and the word went round
from the night watchers that this was the owner
coming, a great cheer went up. They had ex-
pected to see a weakly, overdressed faddist with
more money than brains, for few of the men looked
on the Nemesis as anything else but a mad experi-
ment ; but when they beheld a tall, lithe young
man of commanding appearance, whose sole dress
consisted of an overcoat and a rug ?he had re-
moved his sodden garments in the launch?they
felt that they were looking at a man who always
125


carried out, despite opposition and regardless of
self-inconvenience, what he planned.
? Good morning,?-? he said, leaping lightly oh
the beach as the launch grounded ; ?I hope you
will excuse my dress, but I have been in the water,
and the weather is too cold in these parts to remain
in wet clothing. Ah 1 I see the Nemesis is still
floating. Who is foreman among you???
? I am, sir,? answered one of the men, saluting.
? You are our employer, I think? We are waiting
on instructions as to our work, and Mr. Bell is on
shore, I believe.?
? Yes ; send some one with a launch for him and
Tom Munroe at once. Where is Mac ?I mean
Mr. Macpherson? -
? Making a dock at the top of this inlet, sir.
He has all the night shift with him except those
who were on watch here, and they won?t go off
without your orders.?
?Ah ! put me on board now. Boy, go and find
out how to get some breakfast. You are tired and
hungry.?
? But you, sir ; you must be far more needing
than I am ! ? cried Harry.
? I heard Mr. Macpherson send an order to the
cooks to have breakfast ready at daylight for seven
or eight people, sir,? put in the foreman.
? But there are far more than that. Where do
the men dine who have been on duty all night? ?
? Oh, they get their breakfast in the general hall
over in the barracks, sir.?
?Very well. Then, Southwood, go and find
Mac, and tell him what I told you about Jim.
Men, you who have been about all night had better
go and rest now. You did quite right in waiting,
but I?ll relieve you of all responsibility now.?


A launch had now departed for the mainland,
and, going on board the Nemesis , the Chief looked
around him. She lay where she had been
anchored, but a barge was now moored on each
side of her, on which men crowded, applying the
finishing touches to the larger vessel?s hull.
? If you please, sir,? spoke a man, addressing
the Chief, ? there is still some work to be done
to the engines. I am the night foreman, and
there is a matter I should like to mention to you
which the men don?t know yet.?
? Well, my man, what is it? ?
? The Nemesis was scuttled, sir. She makes
water fast enough to put her in the bottom in half
an hour.?
??Yes, I expected that. How did you find it
out, and how did you remedy matters? It must
have been very difficult working in the water last
night.?
? She is not repaired yet, sir. It was in the
engine-room that she made the most water, but
we couldn?t get in there. The young fellow who
knocked over the man last night is sitting on the
top of the starboard engine, and he peppers any one
with bullets who tries to go in. He says he?ll sit
there if he drowns, unless you tell him to leave.?
? Dear me ! I forgot all about the boy. Bob',
come out now, your watch is over. Come and get
breakfast.?
? All right, sir I ? cried a voice from the regions
underneath, and Fitzgerald, soaked through and
through, climbed out on deck.
? You young rascal,? spoke the foreman re-
provingly ; ?if you had let us in we might have
done something. The ship might have been on


the bottom with you in it by this time if we hadn?t
got those barges alongside and passed chains
underneath between them.?
? Good,? remarked the Chief. ?So you are
practically holding the Nemesis up now? ?
? Practically, sir. But we can now see the
damage, and the day men can make it right. I
expect they?ll have to beach her though.?
? No, I don?t think so,? said Bob. ? I plugged
up all the holes fairly tightly.?
? You ! ? cried the man. ??How in thunder
could you plug the holes? Go away and get your
clothes shifted or you?ll catch a cold that won?t
leave you in a hurry. But, sir, you?ll be ill too ;
you?re shivering.?
? We?ll both go, Bob,? laughed the Chief. ? A
good blazing fire would not be a bad thing to see,
and the men can do anything now.?
The two foreman were now holding a con-
sultation as to what should be done, when Bob
said to them : ??l fear I have ruined some of the
sea-cocks ; at least, they will require new valves.
Some one had removed all the valves, and that was
what did the mischief. As soon as I saw her
making water I found that out and hammered
plugs in their places.?
? Plugs ! ? repeated the two foremen. ? There
was nothing down there but some pipe nipples
and a few reducing couplings.?
? And I used them,? said Bob?. ? I hammered
the nipples into the valve holes, and screwed in
the reducing couplings ; then, finding a set of inch
pipe dies, I made plugs for the small ends of the
couplings out of some rivets, and screwed them in.
It was a long job, and before I got the last plug
screwed I was nearly up to the neck in water.?


?You are a marvel, youngster,? said both men.
? But why in creation wouldn?t you let some one
in to help you? ?
? Because I had the Chief?s orders to keep
every one out. How was I to know, too, but that
among the men whom I might allow into the
engine-room there might not be another of these
thieves? It was dark, and one man could do a lot
of damage.?
?It is well seen you come from a Clyde engi-
neering shop,? spoke the day foreman. ? They
tell me that apprentices there can measure the
thickness of a flash of lightning with their cali-
pers.?
? I believe Jim Robertson could, any way,? Bob
answered. ?He could do anything.?
? I was speaking to that young man an hour or
so ago, said the Chief to Bob, ? but we had to
part rather suddenly ; that was wdiy I got wet.
But let us go. Send a man to direct us to the
nearest erection with a big fire, will you, Mr.
I forget your name.?
? Palmer is my name, sir,? replied the night
foreman, ?and my mate is Wright. We?re both
Tyne men.?
? And better men than those from Tyneside are
not made,? said the Chief, stepping into the launch
with Bob ; ? but just get that water pumped out
in the meantime. Mr. Bell will be here himself
shortly, and he knows best what has to be done.?
Following the man sent as their guide, they
came to a large wooden erection on the other side
of the little island, and entering, they found them-
selves in a large dining-hall, in which the men just
off from night work were preparing to breakfast
9


? Mac has done his work well,? commented the
Chief, as they passed through, still following their
guide, into a smaller but more luxuriously fur-
nished room in which blazed a cheery fire.
? This is the boss?s place, sir,? their guide said.
? If you ring, those engaged by Mr. Bell to be
your servants will attend.? He departed with a
salute, and, sitting down in front of the fire, the
Chief remarked : ?It is a bit strange, Bob, to
come to your own place and not know where to
turn for anything. I wonder how Mac feels about
it? ?
? Were you never here before, sir? ? Bob asked.
?No; at least, I don?t think so ; but Mac
created this place. He bought the island for me,
and brought all those men here, and generally
engineered everything. Mr. Bell will give us all
information when he comes, though. Ah, here is a
born waiter ; I know him by his air of superiority
yet evident readiness to cringe to his masters. I?ll
risk it, anyhow. Are there any rooms prepared
for us? ?
? Yes, sir. All the apartments on this side are
at your disposal.?
?? Thanks. Do you know if I have any dry
clothes?
? They are laid out for you now, sir, in that
room on your right. The other gentleman will
find his in here.?
? Thanks. Let me know when Mr. Macpherson
or Mr. Bell arrives.?
The waiter bowed and retired, and the Chief
laughed. ?That man has everything that could
be desired in the way of manners, Bob,? he said.
?He could pass in society where our engineers


would not feel at home, yet where could you find
better men? By Jove ! if ever I gather a band
round me again, I?ll have them all of that cool,
self-reliant, independent type like Bell and his
subordinates. These are men who, when they see
an effect, will not rest until they know the cause.
But.l forgot. Run away and change ; we?ve a lot
to do to-day yet, I expect.?
Bob found his comrade Southwood waiting for
him in their joint apartment when he entered, and
while he got into dry clothing they told each other
of their experiences since the launching of the
Nemesis.
??This is something like life,? said Southwood,
as they entered the larger hall again ; ? and I do
hope that after we rescue Jim the Chief will keep
us with him.
? I hope so, too, Harry. He is a strange man.
I wonder why he ever came to form the Cos-
mopolites.?
? Come away, laddies, we?re waitin? for ye,?
broke in Mac?s voice, and, looking up, they saw
that a table had been set, round which were already
seated the Chief, Mac, and Mr. Bell. An appe-
tising breakfast was just being brought in, but the
boys were so hungry that they could have eaten
anything.
? Well, my lads,? the Chief said kindly, as they
took the seats assigned to them, ? how do you like
your new life? Not very pleasant, is it? ?
We couldn t imagine a better, sir,? answered
Southwood ; ? and we were just saying as we
came in that we hope if you ever gathered
another band round you we might be allowed to
join.?


The Chief?s eyes shone. ? But why another
band? ? he asked. ? What is wrong with the
present one? ?
? It will break up when we catch that other
boat and rescue Jim, and that?s just when we
would like the fun to begin,? answered Bob.
? But is this really a band of men sworn to do as
you tell them? ?
? No, Bob, it is merely a party of engineers
employed to build and equip the boat you sat in
all night. If it had been built in any other yard,
on the Clyde or elsewhere, our friends with whom
we had some dealings last night would never
have allowed its completion, assuming always that
any first-class yard would have taken the contract.?
? You have a definite object in view then, sir,
to which you intend to apply the Nemesis? ? asked
Mr, Bell. ? I gathered that much, of course, but
not officially.?
?We have. We intend to run down that mys-
terious craft you saw last night, the chief officer
of which we attacked and left bound, but unfor-
tunately not gagged, as you suggested, on the
beach.?
? It shouldn?t need any special effort to do that,
sir. The ship we saw would probably burst her
boilers to make ten knots.?
? She has no boilers. She is driven by gas
engines.?
? What ! I thought the Nemesis was the first
to adopt that system.?
? Hardly. That other ship has been sailing the
ocean for some years, and she can make a good
bit more than ten knots.?
? Surely not, sir ; she is nothing else than a


hulk built for some owners who wanted the utmost
penny of profit they could get out of her. In
fact, I wonder the Board of Trade ever passed her.
Her skipper and engineers must have had bad luck
or they would never have come down to handle
such a barge. The use of suction-gas, I should
say, is merely another dodge of its owners to get
some extra carrying space without infringing
the measurements of the Board of Trade.?
The Chief and Mac allowed Mr. Bell to say
all he wished against ? freak ? ships ; evidently
he was well acquainted with the devices of certain
tramp owners to make their ships more profitable.
? And yet, Mr. Bell,? the Chief remarked when
the other had finished, ? the ship we are talking of
is owned, or at present we?ll say chartered, by a
company of very wealthy?well, gentlemen. She
is officered and manned by the most skilful men,
in their respective capacities, the world can pro-
duce. Suction-gas is used because more power is
obtained thereby than half the ship full of water-
tube boilers and steam turbines could produce,
and it also ?
? But what is the idea in wasting good men and
big power on a tub like what she is? ?
? And it also, I was going to add,? continued
the Chief, apparently ignoring the interruption,
? by reason of the compactness of the plant, and
the low centre of gravity of what we may term the
marine type of explosive gas engine, allows of a
hull being built on very much finer lines than could
otherwise be practicable.?
? But no one could call that ship?s lines fine ;
her length wasn?t much more than three times her
beam amidships.?


? Which is a little, though pardonable, mistake
of yours, Mr. Bell. I found in my bag while dress-
ing just now an old note-book of mine which tells
me her length is 256 feet 6 inches, whereas her
beam is only 25 feet 5 inches, a ratio, you will
observe, of just over 10 feet to 1, which is unique,
you will allow.?
? Then, sir, we must be thinking of different
ships ; and yet the people we attacked last night
came off the ship' I am thinking of. I saw them
come ashore from her yesterday afternoon.?
? Oh, yes, they came off that ship all right, but
I expect if you saw the ship now you would agree
with me as to her lines. She will be well out to
sea now, unless she intends calling at some con-
venient port to pick up her much scattered people.
To come to the point, Mr. Bell, that ship was dis-
guised. She can be made to assume almost any
appearance. I once knew all about how that was
done, but ?
? I can tell you,? broke in Mac. ? The signor
fellow wadna gang awa? this mornin?. He said he
was goin? to stick to his old Chief, so after I packed
Mr. Broken Heid awa? to the mainland, I drew
the whole story oot o? him, an? he doesna ken yet
that he was tellin? me onything that I didna ken.
They alter the ship by hanging round her a false
shell o? jointed patent metallic plates that weigh
next to nothing. This shell only reaches to the
water, of course, and they have portholes and bul-
warks an? cut pieces to imitate well decks, which
they can shift anywhere, an? they always carry a
couple o? dummy funnels.?
? Dear me I ? ejaculated Bell, ? what is the use
of all that? The Customs people would spot that
game at once.?


? But they don?t get the chance. She never
goes into any port like that. When she is at sea
everything is packed inside, and she is just a
racing machine, but when she enters any port
officially she is a private yacht ?she wasna really
in port last night, ye ken ?an? then her dummy
shell is stretched tight round her and painted to
correspond wi? her assumed character.?
? I never heard of such a thing outside story-
books before,? said Bell. ? But you haven?t said
what the use of it all is.?
? She was honest enough at first, I believe, and
her owner found it convenient to keep people frae
interferin? wi? his business, as they would have
done if his ship went flying about the world as
she really was ; but the men mutinied, and she is
now a pirate ship.?
? And I 'was her owner,? put in the Chief
quietly. ? I want you now to build a light port-
able shell to fit on to the Nemesis. Build it in
such a manner that it will not interfere with her
sailing lines, and put in all effects to make her
look like an ordinary yacht.?
? You mean practically to place a superstructure
on the middle or parallel part of her body and
leave both ends projecting? ?
? Exactly. The ends will be under water, and
therefore not seen.?
? But that is what we have already built, sir ;
Mr. Macpherson put that in hand at the very
first.?
? Eh, what was that? ? asked Mac, pretending
he had not been listening. ?Is the superstructure
finished? I had forgotten to ask about that,?
Mr. Bell seemed surprised somewhat. ? Why,


sir, it has been finished for over a month now,? he
said, ? Don?t you remember ordering it to be
stowed into the cove round the bend of our har-
bour. It lies there floating, and the Nemesis has
merely to sail into it and the whole thing becomes
locked together into a very fine-looking steamer.?
?Ma memory is no vera guid ? Mac began,
but the Chief stopped him.
?I am glad things are so far forward,? he said.
? We?ll be able to get away after that other ship
as soon as you, Mac, can get your resistance-
halving arrangement working. I?ll pick out likely-
looking men and ask for volunteers from among
them to-day ?
?And another thing I forgot, Mr. Bell,? inter-
rupted Mac. ? I have some stuff lying at the
Broomielaw in Glesca. Have we any means of
getting it up here soon? ?
? I?ll send a wire through to Thomson to lift
it. He sails this afternoon, and is due here to-
morrow some time.?
? Thomson,?? muttered Mac to himself. ? Noo,
I wonder who is Thomson? 1 ?
? Thomson, as you probably know,? continued
Bell, addressing the Chief, as if in answer to
Mac s muttered inquiry, ?is the skipper of the
Hercules. We found it necessary to charter a
steamer to carry our material up here. It saved
railway rates and prevents the people in Oban
from knowing too much about our work.?
? I was wondering about that,? observed the
Chief. ? The people round this quarter will natu-
rally be curious to know what such a large body
of men are doing here. How do you manage to
keep prying visitors away? ?


? Well, the people are not so interested as one
might think. You see, they are accustomed to
all sorts of mysterious happenings now. That
grass-hopping aeroplane the Government engi-
neers built over among the Grampian Mountains
near Blair Atholl, has made secret works quite
popular. There is another big undertaking going
on too, much more convenient of access to those
who are curious. A company is employing all
the men they can find anywhere to build an elec-
tric power plant. They have got a concession of
the water rights of a chain of mountain lochs, and
they are tapping this supply and bringing the
water down in great pipes to a low-level station,
where, by means of turbines and dynamos, they
hope to generate cheap electricity, I believe they
even have the idea of carrying it to Glasgow and
Greenock, and I know they are erecting a fair-
sized plant for the reduction of aluminium from
its ores. Most people during the past autumn went
there, and now, when we really have something to
be seen, the weather is much too cold for the
chance investigator. I fancy, too, that the people
of Oban believe in minding their own business ;
but, anyhow, we have not been troubled greatly.?
? I should have thought the Press would have
been more curious.?
? Oh, Mr. Macpherson saw to that long ago.
We have a half-literary fellow among the engi-
neers. He?s got a most vivid imagination, so
Mr. Macpherson got him appointed as special cor-
respondent to some news agency, and he supplies
a column every week or so.?
? A column of what we are doing? ? The
Chief half rose from the table in his surprise.


? No,? laughed Bell, ? a column of what we
are not doing. I mentioned that his powers of
imagination were remarkable.?
The Chief sat down again and smiled. ? I
understand,? he said. ? Everything has been well
arranged, and now, after that excellent breakfast,
I feel confident that all will go well.?
? I hope so, sir ; but if you will excuse me I?ll
go. The men are awaiting orders, and I must
?phone this message over to the post office at once.
We have connection, you know, by submarine
telephone.?
? We?ll all be round presently,? said the Chief,
as Bell departed. Then he turned to Mac.
? Mac,? he said, ? the lad would tell you I saw
and spoke to your son. He is well and even
enjoying himself, for in him they see a valuable
acquisition to their ranks, and they are treating
him accordingly. I almost succeeded in getting
him away, but they have some wonderful traps
on their ship now, and I was found out and had
to run for it. We?ll get him soon now, however,
and he knows welTe after him, and then we?ll
devote ourselves in peace to inventions and dis-
covery.?
? The news that they are no?? bad to the laddie
makes me feel better,? said Mac. ? And it is a
good thing for them, for I?ll no rest until I have
drooned every man o? them if they mak? him suffer.
But I?m forgettin? again, although ma memory is
gettin? weel replenished wi? the things Valli made
us forget. I?ve got to get a tank ready to hold
the Nemesis."
? A tank, Mac? How on earth can you do that?
And what is the tank for? ?


?The tank will no? b'e difficult to mak?. I?ve
got it started already. The Nemesis has got to
float in it because her hull is goin? to be a pole in
the biggest galvanic battery ever made. But we?ll
go an? see how the work is gettin? on. I feel able
for onything noo ; a guid breakfast is a grand
thing.?-
? I think I?ll go and have a talk with our Italian
friend,? said the Chief. ? I want to know as
much as possible, and how I came to be sailing
about the world in company with the Cosmopo-
lites. I?ll join you later.?
They all went out and crossed over to where
work on the Nemesis was proceeding rapidly.
There Mac and the boys left the Chief and walked
along the shore of the haven until they came to
its head. Here a great number of men were
engaged excavating a huge trench along the course
of the stream which entered the bay just there.
Floating peacefully, a hundred feet from the shore,
was the ship-like superstructure Mac had designed
for the Nemesis at an earlier period. From the
boys? point of view it looked exactly like a ship ?as
indeed it really was ?but, as it swung on its anchor
some minutes afterwards, they saw the stern, and
realised the scheme in a moment. They were
looking through a long tunnel, into which the
Nemesis proper was intended to fit, the super-
structure resting on its back like a saddle on a
horse. A row of cabins ran along both sides
between the inside of the arch and the outer casing.
The deck was complete in every w r ay, a central
row of deck houses running its entire length, and
a rakish funnel issuing from about the middle.
Two masts also graced the structure, and boats


hung from the davits over the stern and elsewhere.
A companion-way gave access to the inner com-
partment, and the boys could see that the central
part of the tubular craft would just fit under it.
? Of all the ideas I ever heard, this is the
greatest,? Southwood summed up after a long
examination. ? Imagine what could be done with
a ship like what this will be.?
No, don t do that,? broke in Mac, who had
been watching the boys. ? That?s what the Cos-
mopolites did, an? they did not stop at their
imagining. Come here, an? I?ll explain the idea
o? this dock we?re makin?.?
? I can see that already,? cried Fitzgerald.
You mean to deepen that stream by digging and
damming until it can hold the Nemesis .?
Exactly ; but we?ve got to sail the Nemesis
in and then shut the door on her. Then ye?ll see
a job done in about half an hour that wad take a
month by the ordinary way. But we?ve nae time
to go into details just now. Ye?ll see it done the
morn, an? the next day, if Providence doesna
object, we?ll sail awa? after the pirate boat.?
? Tell us what to do then, please,? said South-
wood, ? We?re engineers too, you know.?
? � ne of you go and tell Mr. Bell to send every
man here as soon as he has finished wi? the work
on hand. Then both o? ye go an? lay cables frae
the dynamos along to this place, an? then visit
the store an? see what?s there o? sulphate o? copper,
zinc oxide and metallic sodium. If there?s no?
enough there o? these materials we?ll hae to start
an? make them.?
Filled with enthusiasm, the boys rushed away.
Harry delivered the message to Mr. Bell, and


then they both set about laying the cables as
directed. Afterwards they filled boat-loads of
sulphate of copper and other chemicals from the
store, and rowed them to where Mac required
them. When night fell they did not wish to stop
work, but the Chief and Mac were obdurate, and
they were compelled to leave off. At six o?clock
the night shift went on, and amidst the glare of
electric arc lamps men toiled in the fast-widening
dock, and towards morning it was completed.
At mid-day the Hercules sailed into the bay and
unloaded a cargo of material that had been ordered
some time before, and early in the afternoon the
Nemesis herself was skilfully manoeuvred into the
dock and the gates closed. Mac then ordered
gallon after gallon of sulphuric acid to be dis-
charged into the water, and the men, puzzled but
interested, waited to see what Mac?s idea was.
When he ordered a ton of copper sulphate to be
dissolved in the now acidulated contents of the
dock, the Chief, who was standing by, smiled,
and Mr. Bell looked much worried.
? I have just grasped your idea, Mr. Macpher-
son,? he said. ? You mean to copper the hull of
the Nemesis by electro-deposition, but unfortu-
nately we have not nearly enough copper to make
anodes to surround the ship.?
? There?s more ways than one o? doin? ony-
thing, Mr. Bell,? said Mac. ?We dinna need
anodes. Stir up that cyanide of potassium, boys,
an? pour it in, an? add that ammonia, Harry.?
The water at first, after the copper sulphate had
been dissolved, had assumed a deep blue tinge,
but when the ammonia was added this changed
to a dazzling purple colour, which in time, after


the addition of the potassium cyanide, faded away
and left the water almost colourless.
? That acid will eat the hull away, Mac,? said
the Chief.
?It will gie it a bit clean, I?ve nae doubt,?
replied Mac. ? Turn on that hydrogen gas,
Harry.?
Southwood, who had been making hydrogen gas
all the morning by dissolving zinc in dilute sul-
phuric acid, now directed the ends of a couple of
pipes connected with his gasometer into the dock.
Instantly the water began to bubble furiously,
and the hull at once shone out like an endless
sheet of gold.
? I dinna think I need to gang into the theory o?
the thing,? said Mac. ?You a? ken the idea o?
copper plating, only I have used hydrogen gas
to cause the deposit o? the copper frae its solution.
In half an hour the copper on the hull will be a
thirty-secondth of an inch thick.?
? But, Mac, while copper lining will prevent
barnacles growing on the submerged part of the
ship, it will not really make the resistance of the
water any less. We won?t travel any faster be-
cause of that,? began the Chief.
? Chief, you are in too big a hurry,? interrupted
Mac, ? although I am a bit greedy o? time mysel?.
Just wait till ye see the end.?
? All right, Mac, I will not interfere again.
Mr. Bell said nothing. He was a thorough
engineer, but he had long ago discovered that
Mac was a past master of engineering science,
as well as an expert in all matters relating to
chemistry. But he was now witnessing something
that Mac had not told him about previously, and


he wondered what idea lay behind it. True, to
plate a ship?s bottom with copper electrically or
chemically was not in itself a feat that other engi-
neers could not perform, although he had never
heard of its having been done before. That some-
thing was to follow he felt sure. Nor was he
wrong.
? That will do now,? suddenly cried Mac ;
? shut off the gas.? This was done, and then
Mac turned to the Chief and said : ? The next
stage o? this experiment is one we canna carry
through in public. We?d better leave it till after
dark, when only ourselves and some picked men
will be here.?
? You know, Mac. We?ll go away now, then.?
? Take Mr. Bell with you, an? we?ll decide upon
the best way o? doin? the trick over in his house.?
Giving orders to open the sluices, and thus
allow the acidulated fluid to escape, and leaving
instructions with the foreman to allow the dock
to fill itself again with the next tide, Mac followed
the Chief and Mr. Bell to the house in which the
manager lived so as to be near the work.
?I?ve given the boys all instructions as to what
we want for to-night,? he said, when they were
seated inside, ?an? I?m ready to tell you o? my
discovery noo.?
? Fire away then, Mac,? the Chief said.
?Wait a moment,? spoke Mr. Bell. ?I know
there is some secret to be disclosed. Hadn?t I
better leave you alone? ?
? We?ll see later,? said Mac ; ? meanwhile
listen to my theory an? catch me up if I say any-
thing that you think is no practicable. I have
discovered how to make a body travel through


water much easier than is believed to be pos-
sible.? Mac spoke slowly and in good English.
? I have found that if you surround the body with
a thin film of hydrogen gas it will slide through
the water the same as if the water pressure on
its sides had been halved. Of course the pressure
of the water closing in has not really been altered,
that remains constant, but the film of gas seems
to act as a lubricant does with machinery.?
? But, Mac,? interrupted the Chief, ? allowing
all you say to be correct, which I have no doubt it
is, the thing is not feasible. How can you sur-
round the submerged part of a ship with a film
of gas? ?
? And how could you keep it surrounded even
if you managed to place it there while the vessel
was stationary? ? said Mr. Bell. ?It seems to
me the gas would bubble to the surface.?
?It would,? said Mac ; ? but it is the genera-
tion of the gas at the point of contact that does
the work, it doesn?t matter where the gas goes
afterwards. The ship practically sails along in
gas, and the water presses that against its wetted
surface.?
? Yes, yes, Mac, the theory is all right,? said
the Chief ; ? but how are you to get the gas? ?
Easily enough ; the sides of the ship wherever
it touches the water generate the gas by electro-
chemical action.?
? Really, Mr. Macpherson,? said Mr. Bell, ? if
you are referring to the corroding action of salt
water on a ship?s hull I can understand you, but
you have just coppered the Nemesis to prevent
that.?
? I have coppered the Nemesis for a very dif-
ferent purpose.?


But how can she generate gas externally then?
I presume you don?t intend to force it through the
minute pores in the steel plates? ?
No, I don?t ; but I intend coating that copper
we put on to-day with another substance, and
partly because of the galvanic action between this
substance and the copper, but chiefly because of
the oxidising powers of the compound in contact
with the salt water ?it won?t work in fresh water
?there is a constant film of gas generated on the
outside, and the result is that the boat slips through
as easily, compared with the ordinary craft, as a
shaft in well-oiled bearings runs compared with
one fired up.?
? Do you know of a substance that will act as
you say? ? asked Mr. Bell.
I do. It is a fairly well-known element, but
it wouldn?t work at all if I hadn?t found how to
break it down. The boys are making the com-
pound now, and I propose laying it on to-night.?
? But it must waste, Mac.?
It certainly will, but as an hour?s work in a
dock like the one we have at the end of every
twenty thousand miles will make everything right
again, I don t think that is a fatal objection.?
? Mac, you are a marvel,? said the Chief. ? I
ha\e never known you to make a mistake, and I
do^ not believe you have made one now.?
? If what you say is correct, Mr. Macpherson ?
put m Bell, ? you have made the discovery of the
century, and undreamt-of possibilities are before
it* t But you cannot patent such a discovery.?
I know that, but I don?t want to patent it It
is going to be used to run down that craft you saw
the other day because it has my son on board, and


because it belongs to our Chief. After that is
done I don?t care what becomes of the discovery,
for I have all the money I want.?
? Well, Mac, it is getting dark now ; what are
your plans? ? The Chief was enthusiastic. ? How
many men shall we require, and what kind?
? We?ll not require any men. The boys and
ourselves are quite enough.?
? Then, gentlemen, I suppose I had better
knock off all work to-night? ?
? Except a guard of men you know personally,
Mr. Bell. Make them form a ring round the dock
at a safe distance away, and we?ll work the rest
between us. By to-morrow night we?ll be ready
to set the Nemesis on the trail, and ? Mac
paused. His thoughts were deep.
? And a lot of men will have to seek work else-
where,? put in Bell, ??and I?ll clear over to Ger-
many. I don?t think I could go back to ordinary
work in a Scotch yard again.?
? I might be able to secure you a good posi-
tion,? said the Chief, ? but to-morrow I wish you
to pick out some men for me ?men who do not
care what risks they run, but who can be faithful
to any trust confided to them.?
? I know one man who can fill that bill, and
that is myself,? cried Bell. ? 1 don t care a belt-
rivet what I do, and I?ll stand by you and Mr.
Macpherson while life is in me.?
??Very well, Mr. Bell,? said the Chief, ?we
accept your services. I will not insult you by
pointing out possible dangers, and I leave the
matter of finding a score or so of first-class men
to you. You know the type that is required.?
? And I?ll awa? to the boat an' see how the


laddies are gettin? on,? said Mac, reverting to the
Scotch again. ? I dinna ken hoo they?ll manage
to get the sodium an? zinc to the proper propor-
tions.?
? Sodium and zinc ! ? cried the Chief ; ? is that
your other substance? ?
? It is, an? we?re goin? to deposit a coating of
that alloy on top of the copper to-night. The
sodium itself is electro-positive, and so is the zinc,
but they behave vera strangely as an alloy under
a big electric current.?
? But you have given me the knowledge of the
secret now, Mr. Macpherson,? spoke Bell. ? I
am very sorry I overheard, but ?
? Man, ye were meant to hear. We?ve nae
secrets frae ourselves, an? we?re a? in the same
boat noo in mair senses than one. But it?s dark,
and the laddies will be waiting. Come away.?
? Just a moment ! ? cried Bell. ? I?ll telephone
over to the night foreman to keep the men away
to-night. Then, when the day shift knocks off
we?ll have the whole place to ourselves.?
? But what about a guard? ? asked the Chief.
? We can?t take any risks, you know.?
? I?ll pick the men now,? said Bell, going to the
telephone ; and, speaking to the night foreman,
he asked for over a dozen men by name. ? I?ll
go out and pick another dozen from the other
shift,? he said to the Chief. ? They can stay
behind and will not mind any inconvenience.?
? Then you two follow me when ye are ready,?
said Mac ; ? I must help the laddies.? He left
the house and walked quickly round to where the
incoming tide was slowly causing the Nemesis to
assume her proper position. The two boys were


running about everywhere, and the great arc lamps
lit up the place almost as effectively as daylight.
About a hundred men, engineers and labourers,
were also working hard, for it wanted but half an
hour of stopping time, and they wished to see the
outcome of the experiment, for all now knew that
something was to be attempted that, if success-
ful, would make the event historical. Evidently
only the boys had any idea of what was to be done,
but the men worked under their directions loyally,
and very soon constructed a wooden framework
on both sides of the dock. Meanwhile other men
were busily filling hundreds of flat-looking canvas
sacks with some granulated metal-like substance
which had evidently just been poured from a row
of huge melting-pots. But now the men had
finished the two frames, and the Nemesis was
just beginning to float.
? Lay a bare conductor along the top of these
frames now,? ordered Mac. ? Lead it up one side
and down the other and connect one end with the
switchboard.?
In a few minutes the army of men had accom-
plished this, and then Mac cried : ? Hang these
copper hooks along the frame four feet apart,
making sure of metallic connection with the con-
ductor.?
The sacks were all filled already, and hooked
copper connections fastened in among their con-
tents.
? Now, gentlemen,? cried Mac, ? I am vera
much obliged to you for the way you have worked.
But it is all finished now, except for what can be
done any time. You?ll see the result to-morrow,
but in the meantime you can all knock off.?


The men would have rather stayed on to see the
finish, but there was no excuse for their so doing,
especially as the night shift men began to arrive
just then, and orders were very strict that no man
was to be on that side of the island after working
hours without orders. But it was only the men
whom Mr. Bell had telephoned for who had
arrived, and as the day men moved away that
gentleman moved quickly among their ranks and
spoke a word to several, with the result that a
dozen fell back and resumed their places round
the dock.
? Men ! ? cried Mr. Bell then, ? you are all
trusted men here. I need say no more.? A loud
cheer greeted the words ; then Mac assumed com-
mand.
??You are all engineers, I can see,? he cried,
? but the Chief wants you to do some other work
to-night. Hang one of these sacks on each of
these hooks all the way round, making sure that
each one has metallic connection with the stuff
inside.? The men went to work with a will, and
very soon Mac?s order had been carried out.
? These tanks standing all round are full of a
solution of zinc oxide,? he then cried ; ? empty
them all into the water.? As he spoke he closed
the sluices and the Nemesis floated proudly. She
had been submerged over her lines by heavy
ballast. A faint hissing sound now rose from
the encircling line of sacks, and all waited
anxiously. Bob and Harry, acting under instruc-
tions, then connected the ship itself to a huge
electric cable, and the dock was now a galvanic
battery, with the sacks of sodium-zinc and the
ship as two poles.


? Everything is right, sir,? Southwood cried
after running round all the connections ; ? but
the bags are generating gas themselves.?
? Chief,? said Mac, ? this is your own ship.
Come here and transform her into the fastest thing
floating yourself. These sacks are at present the
positive plates, but when you switch the current
on they?ll be changed, and the sodium-zinc be
deposited on the coppered hull.?
The Chief did not speak. He stood beside Mac
and threw the switch handle round. The hissing
in the sacks ceased instantly, and a cloud of
vapour rose from the hull of the ship. Then the
water burst into a bubbling mass, and lights ap-
peared like pin-points and darted erratically over
the surface. Then a cloud of gas gathered above
the dock, and from the smell every one recognised
hydrogen.
??That will explode, Mr. Macpherson,? cried
Bell. ??lt is dangerous.?
? No, it won?t,? replied Mac, ? it?s rising too
fast.? All stood by, speechless and amazed.
They knew Mac ; and even if there were danger
what cared they? An hour all stood thus, then
Mac signed to the Chief and he switched off the
current. ? It?s feenished noo,? Mac remarked,
dropping into the Scotch, and thus showing that
he had been under great strain mentally for
the last hour ; ? open the gates an? let the ship
oot.?
The sluice gates were opened and ropes attached
to the hull.
? Why, she is coming herself, boys,? cried a
man as they all began to pull her. ?We don?t
need the capstan.?


? Great economisers ! she?s slipping through
the water,? cried another.
The Chief turned to Mac. ? That is the word,
old comrade?she is slipping through the water.?
Their hands grasped each other?s.
A mighty cheer floated upwards. The Nemesis
drifted out into the bay.


CHAPTER VII
A RACE TO THE CAPE
Two days after the foregoing, all the buildings on
the island were burned to the ground, and the
bulk of the men who had been employed, well-paid
for their work, and with all the machinery and
tools, packed on board the Hercules, which at
once sailed for Greenock. That evening the
Nemesis put to sea. She was now complete in
every detail, and looked like a first-class private
steam yacht, although one might have wondered
why there was so little smoke issuing from her
funnel. It was pitch dark when she rounded the
northern end of the island and headed for the open
Atlantic. Through the rifts in the scudding
clouds overhead the stars shone intermittently, and
a yawning gulf of blackness lay ahead. But
Captain Thomson, late of the Hercules, was in
charge, and a better sailor, and perhaps a more
unfortunate one, never sailed the seas. ?If we
run down the 10.30 meridian, sir, we shall clear
Ireland by some miles,? he said to the Chief, as
both stood on the bridge of the superstructure ;
? that course will bring us within sighting distance
of Cape Finisterre.?
? We cannot catch them this side of Cape Verde,
152


I fear,? said the Chief. ? They can travel twenty
knots, and have four days? start, less any time they
lost picking up their men at some port.?
? Very well, sir ; I presume they have no desire
to be seen any more than we have, and will there-
fore give the Madeiras and Canaries a wide berth.
With your permission I will run out to about
twenty degrees when off Cape St. Vincent, and
thence make a course for the Cape inside the usual
trade route.?
? When we know our speed exactly, Captain, we
can settle the exact course better. Meanwhile we
trust to you and your officers. I am tired and am
going to turn in.?
Onwards rushed the Nemesis; her twin pro-
pellers raced as if they were churning empty space ;
but the boiling geysers flying high from her sub-
merged stem-point, told a different tale, and the
swirling spindrift cast in dense clouds into the air
had not time to settle ere the Nemesis had passed
through. Behind her lay a wake of seething foam,
but ahead and on either side was the inky blackness
of a wild winter?s night.
? We?re makin? twenty-nine knots,? Mac an-
nounced an hour after they had left the island
behind. ** There?s nothing afloat can come near
us, an? I?m awa? to bed.?
?By Jupiter ! ? exclaimed Harry Southwood,
as Bob Fitzgerald and he worked their way along
the staggering deck. ?This is something like
speed. The wind we?re making will blow our
hair off.?-
? And we are not pushing her yet,? said Fitz-
gerald. ? The generators are almost clogged be-
cause the engines are not being allowed to take
the gas away fast enough.?


? We?ll be down at Cape Town in about twelve
days if we can keep this up,? continued South-
wood.?
?Of course we can keep it up. We are not a
steam-driven craft,? laughed Fitzgerald. ?By
Jupiter ! I wonder what our old mates in the yard
would say if they knew where we are, and what
we are doing. I can hardly believe things myself.
It is not yet a week since Jim, you, and I, were
working at the engines of that Japanese cruiser.?
? You had better turn in, boys,? spoke Mr. Bell,
coming out of the engine-room. ? This speed will
likely make you feel a bit squeamy when we turn
to run south, and we?ll perhaps need you to-morrow
as the engineers are not too well acquainted with
gas-engines.?
? We are ready to go on duty now, sir,? said
Southwood. ?We are not tired, and ?
? And you?ll get all you want to do before long.
Turn in and sleep.?
? I think we should, Bob,? said Harry. ? I feel
?I mean ?I ?
?So do I,? answered Bob, ? This speed has
upset my centre of displacement.? They went
below, and soon throughout the ship few but those
on duty were awake. Blindly, but swiftly, the
strange ship tore forwards. Her engines had now
settled down to steady work, and the regular ex-
plosions in the cylinders showed that an even speed
had been reached.
Captain Thomson kept the bridge. He had three
junior officers, all from the Hercules , and all of
whom had joined in the adventure with the reckless
enthusiasm of youth. There were only three en-
gineers required to work the ship, and about twice


that number of deck hands, but as all on board,
excepting the officers, were highly skilled en-
gineers, it was arranged that four-hour watches
should be taken of all work indiscriminately until
all had had a turn. They were besides the Chief,
Mac, the boys, Mr. Bell, and Captain Thomson,
thirty men on board, including Signor Antonio,
and some cooks and stewards. The Signor had
implored the Chief to allow him to come to try
to make amends for his past conduct. The Signor
was a scientist of no mean ability, so the Chief
had finally consented. The Nemesis was luxu-
riously furnished inside, and was fitted with every
convenience and appliance known to science, and
a great many which were not yet past the experi-
mental stage, according to popular belief. She
also carried guns, but the Chief did not place
much reliance on them. ? They are good enough
in a fight between vessels of equal, or nearly equal,
speed and strength,? he had said to Mac, ? but
we must depend more upon other weapons, and our
speed is the best one.?
But now the course had been set southward,
and Captain Thomson smiled as he saw a dim,
tossing light appear like a setting star far away on
the starboard bow. ? That must be the Anchor
Liner California? he muttered ; ?she has made a
good passage, but what would old , her
skipper, say if he knew that I had a craft in charge
that could sail round him, yes, and tie knots as
well?
?He wouldn?t believe you if you told him,
Captain,? spoke Mr. Bell, appearing on the bridge
beside him, ? and yet you could truly say the same
to the skippers of the Lusitania and Mauretania .?


? Ah, well, the old man of the California will
think we are a meteor flashing across his bows if
he is on deck just now,? laughed Captain Thomson,
? but to tell you the truth, Bell, I can hardly get
it out of my head that I am dreaming. Here am
I, a poor, no-good mud-scraper, who lost his ticket
twice, on the bridge of the fastest thing afloat. Of
course I know it is all due to your influence ?
??You are not dreaming, old man. This ship is
real, and I can tell you her owner and old Mac-
pherson are real enough, too. There is a mystery
about them both that I cannot solve ?and don?t
mean to try ?but a finer gentleman than him whom
the boys call the Chief, nor a better engineer than
Mr. Macpherson, never lived ?
? And yet they are all below sleeping, careless
of everything, as if they were merely passengers
on board, say, the California coming up there. One
would have thought that they might have been
anxious the first night. No one knows what this
ship can do, or, in fact, if she is really safe.?
? Don?t you worry about that, Captain. What
old Mac doesn?t know is not worth our while to
try to find out. Why, man, don?t you see they
have complete confidence in us. They look to you
for the navigation, and to me ?no, they don?t de-
pend on me for anything, they could drive the ship
without me. Still, I feel that I am responsible in
a way, and that is why I am hanging about to-
night. Ah I yonder is a light on the port bow.?
?Yes, that must be the turbine steamer Gram-
pian, of the Allan Line. She left Glasgow for
Montreal to-day. We?ll give her old man a bit
of a fright, too.?
Good-night, then, Captain, I am going to see


how things are doing in the engine-room, and if
all is right I shall turn in. By to-morrow I sup-
pose we?ll be in the Bay of Biscay? ?
? At this time to-morrow night, if we keep up
this speed, we will be nearly through the Bay, and
in sight of Cape Finisterre light. I see by the last
report of the acting-quartermaster that we are just
touching twenty-nine knots.?
?It is marvellous. Who would dream that this
frail-looking craft could stand that speed? No
one would believe it, and even less would one
believe that this ship is like a turtle and its shell.
This well-behaving superstructure is the shell, the
turtle is underneath.?
I don?t think much of your powers of imagina-
tion, Bell,? laughed Thomson. Who but a hard-
headed engineer would compare this flying craft
to a slow-moving, ungainly turtle, even although
this is only a shell borne along on the back of the
living part? ?
** Well, you know what I mean. Doubtless
young Jones would have said something else, but
then he has an imagination even greater than that
of a newspaper man. Of course it is not the idea
of two ships in one that is unique ; it is the nature
of the vessel down below. Any firm could build a
ship like this if any one ordered it ; in fact, Vickers
and Maxim are building one now ?if it is not com-
pleted?for the Japanese Government. She has to
carry two submarines in her hold, or under her
somewhere, and when they are wanted for business
purposes they just slip out quietly, do their work,
and come back again.?
? Yes, I read something about that ship in the
papers. Great Barnacles I We?re fairly shifting


through the old ocean. Look where we have left
the two liners? ??
? I wonder what they?ll think we are. We?ve
cut across in front of them like a flash of lightning.
They?ll probably think we are a torpedo-boat de-
stroyer on some special trial. What is the first
land we?ll sight?
? The Blasket Islands, then Valentia Island, on
the south-west of the Irish coast. Do you know if
we are to send off any Marconigrams? ?
? I don?t know, but I rather think not. The
Chief doesn?t want our whereabouts known. But
I feel a bit sleepy, Captain, I?ll have a look at the
engines and turn in. Good-night.?
? Good-night. At daylight we?ll be cutting
across to the Bay of Biscay.?
Mr. Bell went below and passed through the
man-hole door in the real hull which gave access
to the engine-room. This was a well-lit compart-
ment ventilated by two powerful electric fans which
sucked the fresh air from the top deck and de-
livered it lavishly in what otherwise would have
been a stuffy room. There were two sets of en-
gines and also a small independent one for driving
the dynamo. The main engine had six cylinders
or explosion chambers, and were not unlike the
type of engine used on the most powerful motor-
cars, only of course, many times larger, and heavier
in build. They were the latest form of suction-
gas engines, and had been specially made for the
Chief by one of the largest firms of gas-engine
makers in England. Gas was supplied from two
separate generators, and passed through purifying
chambers in the usual manner before reaching the
engines. These generators were at one end of the


engine-room, and were fed automatically with coal
by means of some mechanical contrivance Mac
had invented. But between the purifying chambers
and the engines were two large boiler-like objects
mounted with gauges, valves, and curiously indexed
gas-meters. What this apparatus was intended for
no one knew. Certainly Mac had fitted them there
for some purpose, but in the meantime they were
disconnected.
There were two men in the engine-room, for
although one was quite sufficient, Mr. Bell had
thought it best to put two men in charge, especially
as such a large number of competent men were at
his disposal.
?Well, Jones, how is everything?? Mr. Bell
asked, after he had watched the whirring machinery
for a moment.
? O. K., sir,? came the reply ; ? the engines run
as smoothly as sewing machines, and the generators
need about as much attention as the chief man at
an Irish wake.?
The man drew a grimy hand across his per-
spiring face and smiled cheerfully.
? You?ve got a wonderful descriptive way about
you, Jones. I suppose you couldn?t come down to
real bed-rock if you tried? ?
? I don?t want to, sir, I?ve been on the rocks
before.?
Mr. Bell looked at the man with just the sus-
picion of a twinkle in his eyes.
? Indeed,? he said. ? Where? ?
?At Rio de Janeiro, sir. I got stranded there
and the only thing I had that I could call my own
was a pretty bad attack of yellow jack ?
? You haven?t got it about you now, Jones? ?


? No, sir, I sold it.?
? Sold it. Come now, Jones, I know you could
give Ananias a hundred yards in the mile and beat
him easily ; but you needn?t stuff me with that sort
of thing.?
? It is a fact, sir, I assure you?isn?t it, Tom? ?
He turned to his comrade, who was oiling some-
thing.
?So you have often said,? Tom replied. ? But
tell Mr. Bell the yarn, and maybe he?ll believe
you.?
? You see, sir, I was pretty bad. I thought if
I could get away from the evil-smelling town I
might have a chance to push a file for some time
yet, so when I saw a low-down tramp coming sail-
ing up the harbour with the Union Jack over her
stern, I swam out to her, and I was so ill that the
sharks wouldn?t come near me. Well, I got on
board somehow, and almost the first man I saw
was a funny-looking fellow with spectacles. I
sang out not to come near me ; but he grinned
all over his face, and in language that was a cross
between Chinese and Welsh told me that they had
come to Rio Janeiro specially to find a man filled
up as full as he could hold with yellow jack. I
don?t remember much more, I think I flopped on
the deck, but when I came to my senses I was
sitting on the verandah of a bungalow built in the
middle of the finest garden I have ever seen. The
same old fellow was standing beside me with a
small bottle in his hand. I could see the place
was an island, and, judging by the angle of the
sun?s rays, pretty near to the tropics, but as sure
as I am oiling this crank-bearing just now,
the water all round about was dark brown in
colour ?

?? I THINK YOU ARE AT THE WRONG TRADE, JONES ; YOU SHOULD
WRITE A BOOK.? ?




? You are wandering from the point,? inter-
rupted Mr. Bell ; ? come back to the funny man
and the bottle.?
? All right ; but I am telling the truth ?
? Possibly ; but go ahead, I want my mind taken
off engines and gas-producers before I try to
sleep.?
? Well, he told me he had got all the yellow
jack I had in his bottle, and that I would be landed
in New York in about a week.?
But I don?t want to go to New York,? I said.
? You didn?t ask where we were going when
you came on board,? he answered in effect.
Well, anyhow, that bottle of yellow jack is
mine,? I said ; * I can make some money by show-
ing it round.?
No, you won?t,? he said, *it is mine now,
but as you ran some risk while under treatment,
it is only fair that you get something. What do
you want in payment? ?
? ? Is all that jack mine? ? I asked, and he told
me it was all taken from my blood. I thought the
bacilli of old jack would be like a lot of snakes,
but as I couldn?t see any in the bottle I concluded
he hadn?t got much after all, so I said I thought
the stuff was worth a fiver at least. He said it
was, and gave me fifty English sovereigns on the
spot, and that very day I was placed on board
the ship again and locked in a cabin, and a week
later was landed in New York. I got a job as
fourth on the White Star Oceanic, and came over
to Liverpool, and I?ve never left the country
since. ?
? Very good, Jones, but I think you are at the
wrong trade. You should write a book ?


? I did write a book, sir ; I wrote all my ex-
periences.?
? Oh, did you? Did you make anything out
of it? ?
? No, sir, but the publisher made my yellow
jack?s fifty pounds. He made me pay that as part
of the publishing expenses, and when I asked him
for some of the dollars that were flowing in to
him he said that my share came to nothing, and
then he showed me a lot of cuttings of what the
critics said ? Jones began to polish some
brass oil cups with great assiduity.
? I suppose they said something to the effect
that the book consisted of so many pages of good
paper, which unfortunately was spoiled because
of the printing upon it? ?
? No, sir, they didn?t. They said that while
the work was better than De Rougemont?s, it was
not so artistic as Munchausen?s ; and the publisher
added that there was now no market for second-
class work, and advised me to try again.?
? Just what I should advise, too, Jones,?
laughed Mr. Bell. ?If you could beat a liar
of the calibre of De Rougemont, there?s every
hope for you. Ah I there?s eight bells, and here
comes your relieving watch. Good-night.?
? Good-night, sir,? responded Jones with a
sickly grin, as he and his comrade prepared to
leave the engine-room. ? The trouble with me
was that my tales were true and the experiences
actual fact.?
? Yes, yes, of course, you are not the kind of
man who could imagine anything, Jones, and that
yellow jack story carries the hall-mark of truth
on its face.?


?In some connection with that experience, sir,
I believe I could say something which might prove
of interest to our Chief and Mr. Macpherson.?
? I have no doubt you could say plenty, Jones,
but I am afraid they would not see any humour
in the thing. They would call it by another
name.?
Jones did not answer. He climbed out of the
room with a strange expression on his face, and
Mr. Bell began to talk to the relieving engineer.
On through the night rushed the Nemesis , her
lights burning brightly, and everything in order.
But for the vibration, no one would have guessed
that they were making 29.4 knots.
When daylight appeared, a faint haze far away
over the stern on the port side indicated the re-
ceding mountainous shores of Kerry and Cork,
When the boys came on deck, even this faint haze
had faded from view, and the Nemesis was alone
in the great world of waters. At breakfast time,
however, she began to roll to such an extent that
quite a number of the men began to feel the effects
of sea-sickness.
? I think, sir,? said Mr, Bell, addressing the
Chief, ? we should try our adjustable keel now.
It might steady us down a bit.?
? Certainly,? the Chief replied. ? How is it
worked? ?
? By pistons, to which it is attached, which pass
through glands up into compartments forward and
abaft the engine-room. I?ll take some men and
lower it now.?
? This is the first time I knew what the keel
pistons were,? said Southwood to Fitzgerald. ? I?ve
been wondering about them all the time. Hallo 1


we?re steadier already. By Jove ! that adjustable
keel must be a good thing.?-
And it was, for when it was lowered the Nemesis
gained the stability that a ship many times her
size would have had, owing to the greater leverage
her keel exerted in the water against the swing on
the floating line of the ship.
? That will act very well in choppy seas, sir,?
said Captain Thomson, ? or in local surface dis-
turbances ; but I fear it will not help us so much
in a deep-rooted swell, the ocean, as you most
probably are aware, despite what most people
think, being in motion corresponding to that on
the surface as far down as divers have ever gone.?
? Yes, Captain, I am well aware that in the
depths of the ocean streams travel in certain de-
fined limits, the same as a river does between banks
on land. The ocean is never at rest, and even
although the surface may look like a sheet of glass,
down in the depths may be fierce contending cur-
rents. I was with the Prince of Monaco on one of
his submarine exploration cruises, and I learned
much then that surprised me. That is the bridge
telephone bell ringing ?
Captain Thomson attended at once, and after
a moment?s conversation with the chief officer, Mr.
Wilson, came back and said : ?Mr. Wilson says
there?s a fleet of warships going through some
evolutions about ten miles over on our port. He
says the Dreadnought is among them, and he wants
instructions.?
? Ah, we?ll go and have a look at them,? said
the Chief, rising from the table. ?We have
nothing to fear, for even the Dreadnought couldn?t
overhaul us, and if she did, our papers are quite
in order.?


? She might send a shot from her 12 -inch guns
after us, though,? said Mr. Bell, who had now re-
joined the company. ? And her gunners are about
the best in the world.?
?You are right,? said the Chief ; ? we can t
afford to heave to for examination, and if we run,
after being asked to stop, a shot would likely
follow us. Tell Mr. Wilson to give the fleet a
berth, Captain ; we?ll pay our compliments
some other time.?
? They?re almost astern already, sir,? spoke the
Captain, as they went on deck. ? They haven?t
seen us, and they can?t even fire after us now.
We shall just clear Cape Ushant and Cape
Finisterre on this course.
Soon the fleet of Britannia?s ocean watch dogs
became an indistinct blur, and shortly after sank
down over the horizon. But the gallant Nemesis
kept ploughing on with absolutely the same pro-
peller revolutions minute after minute, hour after
hour. At one o?clock in the afternoon the look-out
sighted a cloud of black smoke far ahead on the
port bow, and half an hour later two masts and two
funnels rose from the waters. They belonged to
a steamer travelling the same way.
? I don?t know what that can be,? said the
Captain in some surprise. ?The P. and O. and
the Orient Liners all leave London on the Friday,
Last week?s Australian or China mails will be
lying at Marseilles just now, and this week?s will
only be leaving Tilbury Docks.?
? But she may be a Cape Liner,? said the Chief.
? No, sir, they will only be leaving Southampton
at this time to-morrow. Well, Jones, what is it? ?
? I beg your pardon, sir, but seeing you were


in doubt about that steamer?s family, I thought
I would risk drawing your attention. I know her
cut well ; she is one of the Pacific Line, and is a
mail steamship between London, Madeira, and
South American ports. I went a round trip on one
of her sisters.?
? Thank you, I believe I recognise that line?s
particular style in her now.?
? Who is that fellow? ? asked the Chief, as
Jones departed to play a game of deck quoits with
some others ; ??he seems to have more than the
average intelligence, even for an engineer.?
? That is the man who acted as press corre-
spondent on the island,? said Bell. ?He is one
of the greatest storytellers I have ever met, but
all the same he is a first-rate engineer.?
? Come here, you boys,? called the Chief, ob-
serving Bob and Harry leaning over the rail.
??You might cultivate that man there and get to
know him. I know by his face that he has a
tragedy behind him, and if money will help mat-
ters, I may put him right.? He pointed out the
ever-smiling Jones as he spoke, and the boys at
once set off on their mission.
? Keep well to the west of that craft, Captain
Thompson,? then ordered the Chief ; ?? it will not
do any good to us if she puts into Santa Cruz and
reports that a mysterious ship raced past her south-
ward bound.?
? All right, sir, we?ll pass her in an hour, but
she won?t see us as we lie so low in the water.
But we are in the regular trade route now ; to-
morrow we?ll be running down the Portuguese
coast, and passing an endless funeral procession
of ships. There is the Cape Mail coming up now.
These Union Castle boats run like clockwork.?


? And we will be right between the two
steamers. Run out west, Captain, we must get
out of this crowded highway.?
Captain Thomson sprang on the bridge and
seized the wheel himself, and at that moment Mac
came rushing forward. ? Don?t swing her round,
he cried, ?or ye?ll break her back. Wait till I
get the engines slowed, and then it will be safe.
?I never thought of that,? muttered Bell.
? Why, the terrific strain which would be put on
the ship by throwing the rudders against her at
this speed would cause her to snap like a piece
of glass.? But the Captain had now rung down
? half speed,? and immediately afterwards the
vibration ceased, the hurricane that had been blow-
ing fell away, and it seemed as if the vessel were
standing still.
? This is the difference between forcing a ship
and running easy,? said the man Jones to the
boys, ? but by all the leeks I never ate, we?re still
making a good bit over twenty knots. Just look
over the side.?
? Rather look astern, Bob,? cried Harry, ? look
at the circle of churned green water our altering
course has made in the middle of the intense blue
of the sea. But there goes full speed again. We?ll
hit America soon if the Captain forgets to head
south again.?
But the Captain did not forget ; half an hour?s
running south-west took the Nemesis out of sight
of everything, and then she resumed her original
course. When darkness fell she was headed land-
ward to enable the Captain to pick up Finisterre
light, and at ten o?clock the look-out shouted,
? Light on the port bow, sir.?


? That is Finisterre,? said the Captain ; ? we?ve
crossed old Biscay faster than anything without
wings has ever done.?
That night they overtook and left far astern
one of the North German Lloyd mail steamers,
and a British India boat going out on her maiden
voyage. Lying low in the trough of the swell,
they also raced past the homeward bound P. and O.
Australian mail as she came up from Gibraltar,
her many decks ablaze with electric light, and
just before daybreak a British destroyer, with
smoke-stalks belching fire came up out of the
south and passed in a twinkling. ? That is one
of the Scout class,? the second officer, who was
an R.N.R., remarked to Southwood, who had gone
on deck early ; ? she is on special service, and is
trying to do the thirteen hundred miles between
Gibraltar and Portsmouth in record time. She?ll
catch it in the Bay though. She hasn?t the grip
in the water we had.?
At daylight the Nemesis again headed seaward
and sped along on the outmost fringe of the trade
route. The weather was now much warmer, and
every one on board felt in good spirits now that
the dismal fog, rain, and cold of Britannia?s shores
had been left far behind. At night they were
passing the Madeira Islands, and later on the peak
of Teneriffe shone out through the clouds ahead,
and when morning again broke they were sailing
on a smooth sea under a sun whose genial rays
made all feel that life was indeed pleasant. At
noon they entered the tropics. It was Sunday, and
the men lay about the deck enjoying the day
of rest, for although all were not required to work
the ship throughout the week, the finishing of


various things about the vessel had still to be at-
tended to, and this kept every man employed.
Signor Antonio had hitherto kept his cabin.
He was trying to analyse a bottle of some greenish
fluid the Chief had given him, but the result was
most puzzling, and he had not yet determined what
were free elements and what were in a state of
combination. He came on deck on Sunday after-
noon, however, and walked up and down with the
Chief. ? You haf indeed a wonderful ship, sir,?
he said as they paused to look over the side ;
? there can be nothing in the water as swift as
this.?
? What about the Lucifer? She can travel fairly
fast, and if she now has her accelerator working
she may be able to keep in front of us for a long
time,? was the Chief?s answer.
? Yes, she is one big box of power, but she never
sailed more than twenty-five knots even when you
were on board ; that would be about equal to one
hundred miles less than this ship every day? ?
? About that, but she had four days? start,
so I calculate we?ll just run into Table Bay along-
side each other. The distance roughly from Oban
is six thousand one hundred and fifty miles.?
? What do you mean to do, Chief, when you
find the other ship? ?
? Lay this craft alongside, and give the people
the option of coming on board as my guests to the
nearest port, or being sunk with the ship they
stole.?
? But is there not a chance that they may the
tables turn on you? They may steal this ship, too,
for there are much more numbers of the Cos-
mopolites than are of your men.?


? That is true, Signor, but this ship is so ar-
ranged that even if they did get command it could
only be of this deck here. The fighting, and I
may say the impregnable, part would detach itself
and thus leave her supposed captors in an ex-
tremely unenviable position.?
? I didn?t know ?I haven?t seen how this won-
derful trick is arranged.?
? No, signor, it is another of Mac?s ideas. I
don?t know exactly how it is done myself, but you
can rest assured that Mac never makes any mis-
takes ?
?I so curious am to see de ship split in two
itself,? said the Italian.
? I believe you,? said the Chief dryly ; ? but
there are some things in connection with this craft
that no one knows excepting Mac and myself, and
we do not at present intend to share our know-
ledge.?
? Ha, ha ! you not intend to give de knowledge
that is power away again? ? The Italian?s words
were spoken with a laugh, but there was a peculiar
glint in his eyes which did not escape the Chief?s
notice, and the subject of conversation was
changed.
The Nemesis continued on her course down
through the tropics. She kept on the fringe of
the Cape mail track so as to see, but not be seen.
But not many ships came within her range of
vision, an outward bound White Star steamer with
passengers for the Cape and Australia, a home-
ward bound Blue Anchor Liner, two Union-Castle
boats, a French tramp, and, on the day before
reaching the Cape, a ponderous slow-moving Nor-
wegian steamer, evidently making her way to


Western Australia for a load of the famous karri -
wood, the carrying trade of which is almost ex-
clusively in Norwegian vessels, being the entire
list.
South of the equator the heat had become very
intense, but as Cape Town was neared the weather
gradually grew cooler again, and one fine morning
Table Mountain loomed through the mist clouds
far ahead on the port bow. About three hours
later the Nemesis sailed into Table Bay, and
dropped anchor. Nothing answering to the de-
scription of the Lucifer was anywhere outside or
inside the docks, and that evening the Norwegian
ship came in and anchored alongside.
Some time afterwards, as the Chief was just
about to go ashore to enlist the services of the
authorities in detaining the Lucifer should she
come in, Harry Southwood came up and said :
? That engineer Jones asked me to say that he
would like a word with you, sir.?
? Jones ?that is the fellow who is always smiling
as if to hide some sorrow or tragedy? ?
??Yes, sir ; he says the great tragedy of his life
is that no one ever believes anything he says.?
? Well, Mr. Bell told me one of his stories, and
I can hardly wonder. Send him along.?
? I am here, sir,? said Jones, stepping out of the
darkness. ? Was the story you heard about yellow
jack? Because that was true, although no one
believes it, and it is about that that I want to speak
to you now.?
? Yes, I know your yellow jack yarn,? laughed
the Chief, ? but I am in a hurry just now. Will
your business not hold until I come back? ?
? I don?t know, sir. It may not be of any in-


terest at all to you, but one of the men of the
ship that took me from the island is on board this
ship ?
? What ! your imagination is carrying you away
again ?
No, it is not, sir. I thought I recognised him
at first, but as they did not do badly with me I had
no right to say anything against him.?
? Well, what made you change your mind? Did
you tell him a story? ?
?No, sir, but here is a copy of a message he
sent from this ship yesterday, not by the wireless
apparatus on board, but from his own cabin by
some sort of marine telegraphy, which I now re-
member they had on board their ship. I heard
him tapping it out while I was fitting up some
electric lamps in the cabin next his, and knowing
the Morse, I couldn?t help listening.? Jones
handed the Chief a piece of paper on which was
written ; ? Beware Nemesis. Keep clear. Dan-
gerous invention. Send instructions.?
? This is interesting,? said the Chief. ? Why
did you not tell me yesterday? ?
? Because I knew you wouldn?t believe it was
true ; but an hour ago I was in the engine-room
and I heard this message tapped out from some-
where.? He gave the Chief another piece of paper
which read ; ? Come aboard at once. Leaving for
island. Great game on hand. Destroy as much as
possible,?
?Great powers ! Is this true, Jones? You are
not inventing the whole thing? ?
?No, sir, I have stated the facts as known to
me only.?
? Call Mr. Macpherson and Mr, Bell at once,


Harry,? cried the Chief. ?We must take steps to
protect the ship?s machinery.?
Harry ran off, and Jones continued : ??l thought
the idea was to damage, sir, so I have kept my
eye on the man. In fact, I locked him in his cabin
when I came on deck just now.?
? Who is he? He may escape through the port-
hole.?
? That Italian fellow, Signor something or
other ?
? And he has disappeared,? cried Harry, rushing
on deck again. ? There was a smell of fire in his
cabin, and Mr. Bell burst the door open. Signor
Antonio was not there.?
At that moment a handsome steam yacht sailed
past and dropped her anchor near.


CHAPTER VIII
ON BOARD THE LUCIFER
At daybreak the Norwegian timber ship picked
up her anchor with a noisy clatter and headed
for the open sea, via Green Point. She had ap-
parently come into port for some fresh pro-
visions, and, having got them, was now about to
continue her long voyage across the great southern
ocean. But she had no such intention, for as soon
as the bay was hidden by Lion Head rock she
swung round in a great circle, and went off at a
surprisingly rapid rate on a WNW. course. In
an hour?s time Table Mountain had become lost
in the haze which so often envelops its upper
slopes, and then the timber ship underwent some
quick changes. Her bluff bows disappeared, and
a mast came down and with it a system of pulleys
and tackle mounted on its yard-arm. The dummy
deck-houses sank from view, and the squat blue
funnel, with its yellow cross, gave place to a long
rakish black one, from which, however, little or no
smoke issued. Then the ship itself seemed to
shrink in size, and in half an hour the metamor-
phosis was complete. The old timber hulk had
shed her outer coat and become a smart yacht-
like vessel, with a suggestion of the torpedo-boat
174


about her. Her crew, too, had also changed.
Hitherto those seen on her decks were un-
mistakably weather-beaten sturdy Norsemen,
descendants of a race of sea-kings, now scarcely
ever seen, except, perhaps, on Arctic whaling
ships. Now, they were smartly-dressed, youth-
ful looking men, some in a highly ornamental
uniform and some in white flannels. And, with
possibly an exception or two, their faces were no
longer Norse, for the complexions ranged from
the healthy red glow of the Scot to that of the
olive-skinned natives of Southern Italy and Greece,
the yellow skin and high cheek-bones of the
Mongolian were also in evidence, and some almost
black faces betokened the presence of men from
tropical latitudes. But all faces bore the mark of
intellect, although in some were signs which
suggested that that intellect was not always applied
to the best ends.
A group of five men were talking together on
the after-deck as the last of Table Mountain faded
over the stern. They were all carelessly, though
artistically, dressed in flannels, and were smoking
very fine cigars.
? Well, gentlemen, that was smartly done, but
it was a little bit too close to be comfortable,?
said one with a laugh. ? I don?t think I want to
see Cape Town again for some time.?
? Can they not follow us to the island? ? asked
a Japanese. ??lf they have the speed, why not? ?
? Because I, Valli, never make the mistake,?
answered another of the party. ? They do not
remember the island, nor where it is ; and after
they find out all that, if they can, they have still
got to find their way in ?


? At present they do not know of de island,?
said the fourth ; ? but there ees one man on de
ship who knows there ees such a place and who
suspects that eet ees ours. He does not know
where eet ees, though, and no one will believe
what he says. They all laugh at him ?
? I?ll bet my best set of teeth I can spot that
fellow in two tries,? put in the fifth member of
the party, a handsome, powerfully-built American.
? It?s either that fellow old Kocknitz cured of
yellow jack or that Scotch skipper who lost his
ship among the weeds ?
? Eet ees de yellow jack man,? answered Signor
Antonio, the man who had spoken fourth. ? And
I tell you, Mister Perry, that that man knows
something about your patent submarine telegraph.
I haf? watched him ?
? It can?t be helped now,? said Hassenrahn,
the first speaker. ? Before they can cause us any
trouble we can have a ship built to go twice the
speed of the Lucifer, and if that youngster, who
is so confoundedly like old Macpherson that I
sometimes feel afraid of him, can be induced to
join us, and therefore give us absolute command
of his patent power, we can then tackle the other
people openly. But here are the men to put
up the awnings. I?d forgotten we?re going back
into the heat again.
? Eet ees dat boy dat I fear will bring us all
our trouble,? said the Signor. ? There are two
of his comrades coming after us, and they haf
not got de sense to be afraid. One of them shot
me at de launching of de ship. He came at me
like a young John Bull, and did not care that I
could haf put one shot in him vair easily. But


gentlemen, our old Chief ees one straight man.
He will fight fair ?
? Oh, dry up, Italy,? cried the American,
? we all know that.?
??lf it ever comes to a fight, remember that I
am a free agent,? spoke the Japanese. ? The
terms on which I agreed to remain with the
Cosmopolites make that plain.?
** Oh, yes, Marquis,? Hassenrahn laughed, ? you
are indispensable to us, and you make your own
terms. You do what the English call run with the
hares and hunt with the hounds. But we are
gentlemen, Marquis ; and when a fight is unavoid-
able we will see that you are safely locked up
somewhere.?
Perry grinned. ? I guess you?ll have to lock
up one or two more if it comes to that, Hassen-
rahn,? he said, ? and for quite another reason
too. I wouldn?t speculate a cent on Valli?s life
one minute after the Chief or old Macpherson gets
their eyes on him.?
? Pooh ! Valli no? afraid,? the little Greek
said with a sneer. ?Valli haf? de science. He
no? fight vith Englishman?s vay. He no? fight
Dago?s vay either?stick long knife in ribs. No,
Valli vill call de science to him help and ?
The Marquis Ikato laughed. ? You will have
to begin calling a long time before the fight
begins,? he said. ? After it starts you?ll not have
time?nor, I expect, any of us.?
? Suppose we leave that prospective day of
Armageddon to look after itself,? remarked Has-
senrahn. I don?t think the Cosmopolites will
be taken unawares. Nor do I think that, if we
lie low on our island for a time, preparing for our
12


178 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
next grand affair, we will ever hear of our Chief
again. He will grow tired of chasing shadows
very soon and settle down to the life of a wealthy
English gentleman. Now, let us discuss matters
more pressing. We have succeeded in our Cape
Town business exceptionally well, and that modern
Don Quixote has now met with an adventure which
should satisfy him ?
?What is dis thing you haf? done?? asked
Signor Antonio. ? I haf? not de knowledge of
things for some time, and I only know you were
coming to the Cape to pick up some Cosmopolites
on secret service there.?
? You are quite correct, Signor,? answered Has-
senrahn. ?We came to pick up some of our men,
but it was from another ship we took them. In-
cidentally, we also took the ship and its owner,
along with his beautiful daughter.?
? But I thought the Cosmopolites did not make
war with private individuals,? said the Marquis
Ikato. ? This story is all new to me ?
?Of course it is, Marquis,? laughed Perry.
? You see, you have openly said that you do not
necessarily approve of all the Cosmopolites do,
so they, respecting your feelings, don?t tell you
everything. In this case, however, I don?t think
you need feel worried. It is too good a joke for
that.?
? I must go and get the men started to work,?
interrupted Hassenrahn. ? Tell him the story,
Perry, or what you think fit for him to know.?
He walked forward and disappeared through
the companion-way.
? And I, too, haf? some work to do,? said Valli.
? You to them tell what you like, Perry. -I haf?


not de language so powerful enough.? Valli
walked after Hassenrahn, and the American turned
to the Italian and said sarcastically : ?So your
idea of honour, Signor, is to try to betray the man
who, instead of killing you, as I should have done,
treated you as a guest. It is a noble idea. It is
grand?magneeficent ! ?
? You wish me to insult, sir? ? cried the Italian
in a passion.
? Impossible, Signor,? sneered Perry. ? How
could I insult you? Tell me, and I?ll do it. Oh,
you needn?t draw that knife. I could wring that
long neck of yours before you could move. Yes,
that?s right ; go and repeat what I have said to
you to the boys. I guess I know what they?ll
think of a skunk like you.?
The Italian was speechless with rage, but well he
knew that the man standing before him could shake
the life from his body with very little effort.
Suddenly he regained his self-control, but his
swarthy face had grown white, and the blood on
his lips showed where his teeth had pierced them.
? I see,? he spoke slowly, ? you wish me to
challenge you so that you may kill me. Vair
well, it shall be ; but mine shall be de weapons.
You are oh so brave a man, and I am not. We
shall fight with knives to-morrow, but in de sea.
We shall tell no one, and de ship will sail on
and leave us. ? You kill me, good. Then the
sharks eat me dead. They eat you alive ?
? You are making a mistake, I guess,? inter-
rupted Perry. ? You think you are talking to the
Marquis. I am not a Japanese, and don?t believe
a cent?s worth in Hari-kiri ?
? Then you refuse to fight with me? ?


? See here, Signor, get out of my sight at once.
You know the rules of the Cosmopolites as well as
I do. We are not allowed to fight without the
consent of the others, and then only with all of
them around us. Now I guess you know that in
the fighting line I could pretty well make you into
a deck swab ?
?Ha ! Then, who is de coward? You insult a
man you know can?t get revenge ?
? Insult you? Did I? I thought I merely com-
plimented you on your high standard of honour.
What did you think, Marquis? ?
? I thought so, too, but perhaps the Signor could
explain his actions? ?
? I can. I was caught by de other people.
They wouldn?t kill me. I had already sworn to
be true to the Cosmopolites. The old Chief say
put me on shore and leave me. That no
good to me when the Cosmopolites have already
sail away. I say no ; I stay with him. I stay
with him until we catch you, then I leave him.
I no? tell anything I haf? found out, nor haf? I
done any damage on de other ship. I was com-
mand to leave at once, and I did so. I left one
letter to say goodbye to de old Chief ; and if
ever we catch him I will be his friend.?
? So you don?t feel mean about the matter at
all, Signor? ? asked Perry. ?Well, I opine your
nature is different from mine. Still, as you say,
you had first to be true to the Cosmopolites ?
? And the others wouldn?t kill me, and while I
haf? life, or until we break up, I must work for
the Cosmopolites.?
? I understand you, Signor,? put in the Marquis,
? you couldn?t help yourself. In your case I would
have killed myself.?


?No good that. I am here now, and can do
our old Chief good if he fall into our hands, an
I no tell anything to hurt him. I play fair de
game.?
? Then I beg your pardon, Signor,? said Perry.
? I thought at first you had sneaked into his con-
fidence and were now going to give us the means
of hitting him in the back. I was wrong, and as a
good Cosmopolite, I apologise, and will do the
usual penance.?
? No, no ! ? cried the Italian, ? I forgive. No
one know any more about this. Marquis no? tell.
I am pleased you see I was no? what you say was
skunk. Gif? me your hand.? The two men shook
hands, and then with a laugh, which might have
meant anything, the Italian moved off.
? What do you make of him, Marquis? ? asked
Perry as the Signor went forward. ? He?s not a
coward, yet I?m hanged if I can make him out. I
just remembered all at once that I was giving my
hand away by saying so much ; that?s why I
knuckled down.?
? You were right. The fellow has strange ideas
of honour, yet I think the fact that he felt he had
to be true to his comrades even at the expense of
self-degradation is a point in his favour, and I
half believe him that when the time comes he?ll
be all right. But let him go. What is this about
cutting out a ship and taking its owner and
daughter prisoner? Have we come down to
that? ?
? That is another reason why I tried to chase
the Italian away. I wanted to talk about that
freely, and if the boys begin to think that I am
another half-measure man like you, Marquis, my


influence will go in two shakes. Here?s the yarn :
Obadiah Z. Collins made a corner in something
or other ?old boots, for all I know ?over in the
country that claims me as a citizen. He became
very wealthy and then ?most likely because his
conscience was troubling him ?tried to give his
money away to any one and every one. But he
couldn?t do it. The dollars rolled in to him faster
than he could get people to cart them away, and,
finally, seeing that he was making an enemy of
every man who got his money, he concluded the
game was no good. By this time he had a grown-
up daughter, one of the most beautiful creatures,
so report said, that ever graced this little planet,
and his whole life became absorbed in her. He
brought her over to Europe, where every penniless
count, duke, and earl promptly fell in love with her,
and between ourselves, Marquis?from what I
heard our old Chief and Macpherson say one night
?I believe our Chief was one of them, only, of
course, he could have bought up all the others.
Well, old Obadiah, who wasn?t really a bad sort,
was well received everywhere, and especially in
Britain. He was a dreamy old fellow, and some-
how the idea of adventure ?whether assisted by
his daughter or not, I can?t say ?grew upon him,
and he one day bought a steam yacht and
announced that he was sailing away in search of
Eldorado, or to meet with such adventures as the
fates had in store for him. I fancy it was just
about this time that our old Chief wanted to break
up the Cosmopolites, but I would not go the length
of saying there was any connection between the
circumstances. Anyhow, Obadiah looked for ad-
venture, and found none ?his millions effectually


prevented all chance of that?until about a couple
of months ago we got on his trail. It was Has-
senrahn?s idea. He said we might as well gi'G
the old fellow what he wanted and enrich our-
selves at the same time, and most of us agreed
with him ; but you, of course, your sentiments
being known, were never asked. The rest is
simple. We sent over a crowd of fellows to get
engaged by any means they liked on his yacht.
It was then in Melbourne, and how our fellows
did their work you may imagine if you like?l
hope they didn?t kill anybody. But they suc-
ceeded, and sent word that they were due at the
Cape on a certain date. Well, we determined to
be at the Cape to meet them, and when they sailed
in last night we put a fresh supply of men on board
to replace those who belonged to the original
officers and crew, and the yacht is following us
now. To-night we will wait until she comes up,
and then bring the old man and his daughter on
board this ship and make for our island at full
speed. From there old Obadiah will send word
to his bankers to pay over to some person named
whatever ransom we determine upon, and then he
will have had what he was looking for, and our
funds will have increased accordingly. But it is
getting hot, Marquis ; I think I?ll go and have
a cold bath.?
? I have some work to do myself over a com-
plete chart I am preparing,? said the Marquis,
and the two separated and walked away.
Then a figure arose from inside one of the hang-
ing boats and climbed down on to the deck.
? There are more than Obadiah having adven-
tures,? it muttered. ? I consider my own experi


ences are worthy of that title. But to think that
Harry and Bob are really coming after me. How
ever were they enabled to do that?unless there
was really some truth in what that strange man
who impersonated Hassenrahn said at Oban? I?ll
just continue to keep my ears open and my mouth
shut.? He went below, and entered a large apart-
ment adjoining the engine-room, evidently, from
the machinery it contained, a workshop. In it were
turning lathes, planing machines, vertical borers,
and other machines of peculiar construction, all
driven by electric motors, which received their
current from two big dynamos in the engine-room.
There were also several electro-deposition vats,
electro-welding furnaces, and one or two machines
that seemed to be die-stampers. A number of men
were working in the place, and heaps of pieces of
silver lay around promiscuously.
? Hallo, kid ! we don?t want you in here,? a
man cried on seeing the visitor.
He vas come to serve his apprenticeship may-
be, laughed another. ?Ve vill make him
vork.?
I thought you were warned not to come in
here, Robertson,? spoke a man, coming forward
from among the others.
? I was told I had the freedom of the ship. I
am not going to stay in a stuffy cabin always
because you people are afraid of me.?
?We are not afraid of you. Don?t you see
that you will compel us to adopt drastic measures
with you if you poke your nose in where it should
not be? ?
? I never promised anything further than the use
of my accelerator while I was on board. Put me
on shore if you are not pleased.?


? Dat boy haf too much cheek. Spoil his booti-
ful face I ? cried a man from one of the vats.
? Come and try to do that yourself, you slobber-
ing Dutchman,? cried the youth. ??You have been
wanting that chance for a long time, so come
now ?
? Clear out, Robertson,? whispered the man he
had been talking to, in his ear. ? I am really
your friend, but that beggar has got it in for you
because you remind him so much of a man who
thrashed him before.?
? Let me at him. Let me teach him vat shentle-
men?s manners is,? howled the Dutchman, work-
ing himself into a passion.
? Well, come along and make less noise about
it,? answered Robertson.
? Confound you, you hot-headed youngster,?
cried his adviser. ?Do you want your bones
broken? I am the only man here just now who
would not like to see you come to harm. Get out
at once ?
? No, don?t, Robertson. Remember what I have
taught you, and you?ll give him what some other
fellow gave him before.? The Marquis Ikato
stood behind the boy, and it at once became
apparent to Perry, the boy?s friend, that the Dutch-
man would likely get a surprise, for the Marquis
was the greatest living exponent of Jiu-Jitsu, and
seemingly he had been teaching young Robertson.
As he looked at the boy, too, he wondered why he
had not noticed his splendid development before.
He was a youth only in years, for he had the chest
and muscles of a very powerful man. The Dutch-
man, the gleam of a long-treasured revenge in
his eyes, suddenly sprung upon Robertson and


fastened his two great rough hands round his
throat. For a fraction of a second the American?s
heart stood still. He threw a glance of inquiry
at the Marquis, but that gentleman did not catch
it. He stood with an inscrutable smile upon his
dark face, immediately behind his pupil. An abso-
lute silence, save for the hum of the motors and
the buzzing of some electrical appliance, prevailed
for an infinitesimal space of time, then a roar burst
from the throats of the motley crowd of onlookers.
The youth had suddenly flung up his clasped hands
inside the Dutchman?s grip. The wedge-shaped
stroke instantly threw off the throat-grip, and the
boy?s effort spent itself under his opponent?s chin.
The Dutchman staggered back and fell into a
plating vat, where he lay until some one pulled him
out. The fight was over. At that moment
Hassenrahn entered the workshop.
? What is the meaning of this? ? he asked
sternly, looking round from face to face.
? Oh, our latest member has just proved himself
a chip of the old block,? answered Perry, ? for
I?ll go nap on that youngster being old Mac?s son.?
? Did you men actually allow the boy and that
man to fight? ? The tone of Hassenrahn?s voice
showed his surprise.
? We did,? said Perry, ? and I guess you?ll have
to do without the services of the man until he
recovers.?
? Boy, come with me.? Hassenrahn?s voice was
sharp and peremptory, and Robertson obeyed. But
it was no broken-spirited youth who followed the
imperious German ; it was a young man, sharp-
witted, confident in his own strength, and a believer
in his own ability to look after himself. And more.

-


he had been sleeping in one of the small boats on
deck the night before and had heard much that
was mystifying, and he had determined that he
would get to the bottom of everything con-
cerning ? old Mac ? and ? the Chief ? and the new
prisoners. But he knew he was in the hands of
men who recognised no law other than their own
and with remarkable foresight had mapped out
his programme.
? Now, sir,? began Hassenrahn, when they were
inside his private cabin, ? while I am glad you
were able to successfully defend yourself, I must
say that such things as have happened cannot be
tolerated. I thought I told you that you were not
to go where I found you? ?
? Oh, no, sir, you said that if I entered that
place it would be at my own risk.?
? Well, isn?t that plain enough to show you that
I did not desire you to go there? ?
? No, sir ; I decided I would take the risk.?
** Boy, do you know that most men on this ship
are afraid of me? ?
? I believe you when you say so, sir.
And are you not? ? The German almost
roared the words.
? Why should I be afraid of you? You are not
a professional murderer ; but, even if you were,
I was trained in a Clyde shipbuilding yard, and
can look after myself.?
? What ! Do I hear you aright? Do you know
that I could kill you where you stand? ?
? Perhaps you could, but ? James Robert-
son paused abruptly.
? Continue,? cried Hassenrahn in his fiercest
voice. ? But what? ?


? On second thoughts I?d rather not say what
the outcome might be. I?ll just remind you,
though, that if you did murder me this ship?s
speed would drop from twenty-five and a half
knots to somewhere about eighteen shortly after.
Then that other ship you are all so afraid of
might come alongside ?
? I must compliment you on your coolness,?
interrupted Hassenrahn, changing his tone of voice.
? As you have already said, I am not a profes-
sional, nor even an amateur, murderer, and your
life is a good bit safer here than mine is, seeing
that no harm will come to you while I am alive
to prevent it. But you amuse me. Supposing you
did cut off your accelerating power and we could
not discover its secret, that other ship you think
we dread so much could not catch us. We are
now off all trade routes, and even eighteen knots
will take us to our own impregnable island before
they could possibly find us? ? There was a note
of inquiry in the speaker?s voice, but Robertson
pretended not to notice it.
? Yes, sir,? he said simply.
? Yes what? Confound you. You said that I
couldn?t dare to ?to dispense with your services,
and I have just shown you that I can.?
? Very well, sir,? The boy appeared to be very
simple-minded.
? Look here, youngster, you are by no means a
fool. What do you hope to gain by making me
angry? ?
? Are you angry? I am very sorry if I am
the cause of it. I have no desire to annoy you.
What do you wish me to do? ?
? Speak. Tell me what you hold in reserve,


and why you didn?t finish what you were about
to say.?
? What I hold in reserve matters little so long
as I have absolute freedom, and I didn?t finish my
sentence because of the very same reason that made
you change your tone to me. I knew when
you ceased trying to bully me that it was to find
out all I know ; but, as I have said before, I come
from a Clyde yard, and that game is out of date
there.?
? Oh, you think I am playing a double part? I
may tell you, boy, that such practices are not in
my line, I am Chief at present of the society
known as the Cosmopolites, and it is in their in-
terests entirely I am working. Now, I will make an
offer. Tell me your method of making that accele-
rating fluid of yours, and I will pay you in cash
twenty thousand pounds down and land you at
any South American port, or at Santa Cruz, in
Teneriffe, which will be much nearer.?
? I believe you would, sir, but there are three
reasons why I can?t accept.?
? And they are ? ?
? First, that I cannot sell my secret without the
consent of my two partners, Harry Southwood and
Bob Fitzgerald. Second, you would pay me most
likely in counterfeit money ; and in the third place
I don?t intend to leave this ship until I have solved
one or two mysteries.?
Hassenrahn laughed loudly. ?You are candid,
my young friend,? he said. ? But we can get
over all your points, I think. In the first place,
we can take steps to get your partners? consent.
In the second, I would pay you myself with an
order on the Bank of England ; and, thirdly, I


might be able to give you the solution of all your
mysteries.?
? Can you? Then who is the person called
? old Mac ? by every one on board? ?
? Ah, answer my question first, my boy. What
are the elements of your accelerating fluid? ?
? Hydrogen and carbon chiefly. Now answer
my question.?
? The gentleman known here as ? old Mac ? is
not really old at all. He was a Scotch engineer of
great ability, and, much to my regret, left this ship
through a porthole when our late Chief took his
departure. He invented an accelerating power
similar to yours.?
? But you haven?t told me anything I didn?t
know.?
?Nor have you. I know your fluid was chiefly
hydrogen and carbon. It couldn?t very well be
anything else.?
?If I tell you any more I will be putting
myself entirely in your hands, sir, and. I?ll put
it plainly : would you, if you were in my position,
give away any advantage you had, always sup-
posing that you looked on yourself as a prisoner
more or less? ?
No, I would fight to the end were I a prisoner.
But you are not ?
? Oh, no, I am only a guest taken on board
while under chloroform. A fine distinction.?
?Then, hang it all, boy, what do you want?
You must be driving at something.?
? I want nothing, sir, unless an understanding
between us. Things have come to my knowledge
which have made me determined to remain on
this ship until I have probed the matter to the


bottom. I do not mean that lam curious to
know anything about what work you carry on.
That is none of my business, and I am not a police-
man. Until I have found out what I want to know
or until you think you can do without me, I am
willing to give you my accelerating power, and
if I leave you of my own accord I shall leave it
with you ; but it is on the condition that I am
entirely a free agent.?
? Which means that you will give no promise not
to tell all you know to the world the first chance
you get, and if we prevent you getting a chance
that you will do something desperate? ?
??You have misunderstood me, sir. I am not
concerned in what you do on this ship, and if I
do happen to know some of the things you practise,
I do not feel that I am called upon to give that
information to others.?
? So you propose that we should fight fairly? ?
? Fight, sir? I did not propose fight of any
kind. W T hy should I fight you? I have no cause
to feel aggrieved. You kidnapped me, of course,
but I have enjoyed my experiences, and have been
treated well. No, sir, I do not look upon you
and your fellows as enemies ; I merely refuse to
be bound to you, and claim complete indepen-
dence.?
? All right, my boy, you shall have it. We
have your power while you are with us, and if
you decide upon leaving us through a porthole, as
has been done before, you will leave us the method
of finding out the secret? All the same, I may
tell you, that we shall do everything we can to
find it out for ourselves, and then the position may
be altered.?


? I understand, sir ; but, of course, if you adopt
measures which threaten me, I reserve the right of
retaliation.?
? Quite so,? blandly said the German. ? Now
our interview is over. Good morning.?
? Good morning,? responded Robertson, leaving
the cabin and going to his own. His cabin was
not now the one he had occupied previously,
but a large apartment next the engine-room, at
the stern end of the ship. It was very large and
of peculiar design, for several tubes passed through
the bulkhead near the roof, leading from two
vertical boiler-like structures which occupied one
end of the cabin. Locking his door and con-
necting some harmless-looking rubber-covered
copper wires, he switched on the electric current,
then sat down and smiled. ? There are certainly
some wonderfully clever men on board this
mysterious ship,? he said, ? but none of them are
in the same street with my old foreman, or that
fellow Bell, who left our yard to try his luck else-
where. Jove ! to think that I hold a whip hand
among such a cosmopolitan crowd of scientists
and cut-throats ? A loud voice outside his
door interrupted his musings ; it was certainly an
angry voice, but it was unmistakably American,
the language being, to say the least, emphatic.
? Shut it off, you young beggar. I am electro-
cuted I ? it cried, among other words.
? Why didn?t you knock, then? ? asked the boy,
throwing off the current and opening the door.
? I fitted up that trap for the benefit of visitors
who came when I was not at home.?
? And, howling coyottes ! you caught me in it
first shot,? gasped Perry, as he entered. ? How
is it done? ?


? It?s a little idea of my own,? laughed Robert-
son. ? I have insulated the handle of the door
and connected it with the current of both dynamos,
the ship itself is the return circuit ?
??But how do you manage to tap the current?
This room was specially insulated before you were
given it so that you couldn?t try any monkev
tricks.?
Oh, wires are out of date now for carrying
the electric current ; I have another system of
tapping it. I leave it on too when I leave the
cabin ?
? But what do you do yourself when you come
back? You are not lightning proof? ?
? Hardly ; but I can come in without being
inconvenienced all the same.?
Then you must have a disconnecting switch
somewhere on the outside.?
Robertson smiled. ? When you wish to talk to
me, Mr. Perry, knock on the door, and if I am
inside, I?ll answer you and admit you when I am
satisfied that it is you. It seems I am at war
with the whole ship, and I cannot afford to give
away any points.?
M> lad, if it came to the bit, you might find
you had more friends on this pirate craft than you
think. But we have no time to talk of any but
the one thing just now, and that is this. To-
night we 11 heave to, and wait on another ship that
is coming on behind us. She will put some
passengers aboard us?passengers something like
i' * .
I am to take charge of her and
keep m touch with this ship until we reach our
island. Now, if you could so contrive that this
craft would lose her power of speed some night
13 5


after giving us some signal, you could jump over-
board and we would pick you up. We could then
right-about-wheel and make tracks of our own.
None of the men would know where we were going,
and, in any case, there will be some of the old
Chief?s friends on board, so that we might even
risk a fight ?
? But that would not do me much good. That
would only be out of the frying-pan into the fire.
Here I have a weapon I can use effectively, but
on the other ship ?
? You would have none,? spoke a voice from
somewhere, ? and I don?t think you?ll take com-
mand of the other ship after all, Perry. I in-
tended to get rid of you that way, but now I?ll
have to put up with you here. Get outside at
once or I?ll blow your brains out, and that would
make a mess of the cabin.?
? Who the mischief are you? ? cried Perry.
? And where are you? ?
? Above your head,? answered the voice.
? This is a little spy-hole I contrived so as to!
watch our young friend preparing his accelerator ;
but you see it serves for other purposes also.?
An electric lamp and its protecting casement dis-
appeared through the roof into the cabin above,
and in its place appeared the scowling features of
Hassenrahn. ?It seems I have to be for ever on
guard among my men ; I suppose you know the
fate of traitors, Perry? ?he continued. His face
vanished, and an arm with a cocked Colt revolver
took its place.
? Oh, go to blazes, you greasy old German,?
retorted Perry coolly. ? Haul me before the boys
and we?ll both tell our story. Sorry the scheme


is off in the meantime, Robertson. See you later
about something else.? He opened the door and
passed out, Robertson switching off the current
to allow him to do so.
? And now,? continued Hassenrahn, ? I?ve dis-
covered what your idea of fair fighting is. The
first time I find you out of your cabin after this
I will shoot you as I would a dog. Your secret I
almost know already.?
? Do you call your work fair fighting? ? de-
manded Robertson, but the lamp falling back in
its place violently was his only answer.


CHAPTER IX
ROBERTSON GOES EXPLORING
Night again lay over the phosphorescent ocean.
The constellations of the south shone out bril-
liantly, and the crescent moon lent a quiet, peace-
ful effect to the scene. The waters were as still
as if no tempest had ever disturbed their serenity.
Floating like a bird resting on the wing, the
Lucifer lay on the water, all forward motion
stopped. She was waiting, secure amidst the dark-
ness, and in the fact that she was at least one
hundred miles west of the great Europe and Cape
waterway. Men were gathered about her decks
talking, as well as their knowledge of English
would permit, of the events that had transpired
in the world since they had left the British shores.
Evidently papers had been brought on board at
Cape Town, for the people on the Lucifer only
used their wireless telegraphic system sparingly.
They did not wish their movements to be chro-
nicled. A minute or so after eight bells had
gone a figure issued from the after companion-
way and moved into the shadows behind a deck
house. No one was about just then, so after
waiting a little the figure moved silently and
swiftly across the deck towards a boat which hung
196


from her davits abaft of midships. ?For a gang
of pirates they keep a very poor watch/? the
person muttered to himself ; ?I could easily
club ? He choked his words, held his breath,
and drew closely into the boat shadows. A man
passed within a foot of him. ? A voire sante mon
ami? he was saying to himself, ? if you I see I
you have to shoot. A\a foi! Eet ees not ze work
that I like. Ze boy has not done harm.? He
passed on along the deck, and the boy he was
talking of breathed again.
?So it is a fact after all,? he soliloquised.
? I thought Hassenrahn might only have been
bluffing, but if he has given orders to shoot me
on sight it seems he must have discovered the
secret of the accelerator and doesn?t care how
soon he gets rid of me.? He pulled himself up
into the boat as he spoke, and had just got safely
inside when two men walked past.
? What is this about the American? ? one was
asking the other. ?What has he done? ?
? The Chief him did catch in von trap,?
answered the other. ?He go to de boy ve have
on board and say to him : ? Come vith me on
the ship dat come up to-night. Ve sail avay
and start gompany of our own.? Hassenrahn him
hear, so he now in de prison room, and vill be
before de men brought to-morrow.?
? But what about the boy? Did you see how he
went for Dutchy to-day? ?
?De boy vill go overboard one day. De Chief
has said ? Shoot him ven you see him outside
his cabin ? ? Their voices became indistinct,
and Robertson was again alone.
But for an hour afterwards men passed and re-


passed, and he gathered much information from
the fragments of their conversation which he over-
heard. Among the items which interested him
was the statement that Hassenrahn had told the
men that they need no longer look for the boy on
deck that night as he had him under watch. This
amused Robertson greatly, and he smiled as he
thought of the substitute he had made for himself
in his bunk with some iron tubing and several rolls
of blankets. ? Hassenrahn is not so smart after
all,? he laughed. ? Even a director of a limited
company would know that no man would wrap
himself up in blankets on a night so hot and
stifling as this ? A cry from the look-out on
the masthead cut short his musings and he lay
quiet.
? Light coming up over the stern, sir,? the look-
out had called in the nearest English he could
find to these words, and Hassenrahn himself re-
sponded from the bridge.
And now all was excitement. As yet the other
ship could not see the Lucifer, for all her deck
lights were screened and she carried no masthead
lights. The oncoming vessel crept up, and soon
her deck lights came into view. A ruddy glow
about where the top of the funnel should be showed
that she was using forced draught, and soon the
dense cloud of smoke that belched from the long
black stack became plainly visible.
? Show the signal ! ? cried Hassenrahn, and in
response a huge electric searchlight on the bridge
flashed out a series of signals in the Morse code.
The blinding strips of light cut the heavens in long
vivid slashes, and then the darkness closed in
again. For a minute every man on board awaited


anxiously a reply ; for all they knew their mis-
deeds might have been discovered, and the vessel
coming up so swiftly be a British cruiser about
to call them to account. The engineers stood by
the engines. Hassenrahn stood by the telegraph,
and the Marquis Ikato was in the steering-room.
All was ready for a dash westwards should there
be no reply, or one which did not clearly give the
proper sign. But the correct answer came. A
series of flashes suddenly shot athwart the sky
from the oncoming vessel?s bows, spelling out the
letters C-o-s-m-o-s. In answer Hassenrahn
switched on all the lights, and the Lucifer stood
out in bold relief amidst a blaze of electric light.
Swiftly the other ship raced towards them, every
instant its predominant features becoming more
plainly revealed. It was a steam yacht, that fact
being evident from its smoking funnel. It was
also being driven at its utmost speed, as was now
clearly shown by the glistening geysers of foam
which shot from its bows and fell in two graceful
curves over its forecastle. As it drew near its
whistle sounded out blasts which, translated into
long and short dashes and dots, spelt the letters
C-o-s-m-o-, and the Lucifer responded with her air
syren, p-o-l-i-t-e-s. The watcher hidden in the
boat well knew the signals, and also awaited
eagerly the results. In half an hour the vessel
was within hailing distance, and then a man
shouted through a megaphone: ?What ship??
At once came the answer : ? The Lancelot.
? Where bound? ? next inquired the Lucifer.
? X Island,? came the reply.
? What cargo? ?
? Geese with golden eggs.?


? All right ; come alongside and we?ll take the
geese from you,? cried Hassenrahn, and after five
minutes? manoeuvring the Lancelot laid herself in
position as requested. Both vessels were then
lashed together and a gangway thrown across as
a bridge from the Lucifer. Hassenrahn and the
man who acted as skipper of the Lancelot now
entered into conversation, and a score of men from
the Lucifer boarded the other ship. Shortly after
they returned, partly leading and partly carrying
several persons who certainly did not appear to
change ships with their own free will. Two of
them were ladies ?that much the watcher in the
boat could determine ?one was an elderly gentle-
man, and the rest were apparently only members
of the old crew who had been refractory ; at least,
their rough handling suggested that such was the
case. The Frenchman or Austrian who had ac-
companied Hassenrahn on his visit to the jeweller?s
shop in Glasgow acted as Captain of the Lancelot ,
and after the transfers had been effected he came
on board and held a long consultation with Hassen-
rahn. Another apparently prominent official of
the Cosmopolites also came on board and entered
into conversation with some of his comrades on
the deck of the Lucifer. There was something
about this person that the watcher in the boat
thought seemed familiar, but he couldn?t recollect
any circumstance which gave him reason for his
idea. But suddenly he became all attention.
Hassenrahn and his companion were pacing the
deck just underneath him. They were talking as
if it did not matter who heard them, and the lis-
tener?s business was to learn all he could.
??We will now make easy speed to the island,


Count/? spoke Hassenrahn, ? and you can follow as
fast as you can. What can the Lancelot make? ?
? Seventeen and a half knots, sire.
? Drop that term, Count. Here I am simply
Hassenrahn, for somehow the men cannot bring
themselves to call me Chief. I suppose the title
was copyrighted by the one who held it last.?
? Possibly?sir. But in any case we now do
not to fear him need. He went on shore at Cape
Town with one of the boys we know. He was
seen at the Post Office and at the Mount Nelson
Hotel. Some of our fellows followed him through
the gardens to Adderley Street, thinking they
would be led to Mac, who is, as you know, as
dangerous as he is. They up to him came at the
Strand ?what you say, junction?and attack him
and the boy. The boy he escape and run away,
but he cry something out to the boy and then fell
down. When the police came up our men all run
away and come out to the Lancelot , which I had
already of got command. They say they think the
Chief dead, but I not believe that. He not the
kind to kill so easily.?
? He has more lives than a cat, I know,? said
Hassenrahn ; ? but he can?t escape every time.?
? We then lie low until morning, and when you
sail away we followed as soon as people from the
other ship go ashore to look for their Chief.?
? Ah, well, he brought his trouble on himself,?
Hassenrahn continued. ? I don?t like the idea of
attacking a man in the dark, but he ought to have
known better than to follow us, and should not
have played into our hands by going on shore with
only a boy.?
? WTiy, sir, you have got the sorrow for him?


Did not he on us fall that night in Oban? He
think he win then. We play best cards this time.?
?Where was Mac all this time? They were
always together.?
?No one nevair see him. I watch the deck of
Nemesis all the time with night-glass, but see no
people but the two boys. They were everywhere
at the same time, and even sail round the Lancelot
this morning in little boat to see if she have too
much clothes on. They went round tree times,
but at last one of them look through engine-room
port and cry out to other : ? This is not her, Bob.
This ship have reciprocating engines.? They then
go aw r ay and we leave soon after.?
? They are smart youngsters, but not quite smart
enough for the Cosmopolites,? laughed Hassen-
rahn. ? The one we have on board is a terror,
though. He deliberately forced a fight on that
fellow Dutchy this morning and knocked him out
first round. He and the other two seem to have
been partners, judging from the strange docu-
ment we took away with Robertson, and I suppose
they will follow us through the seven seas until
they find him. These British boys are all like
that. They are either too pig-headed to see their
danger, or else have so much belief in themselves
that they disregard it.?
? Why not catch them, sir? They are the means
which by the Chief and Mac to fight us hope.
They too will know the secret of the make-quicker
power, and will have given it to the other ship so
that they may their partners soon find.?
? I have arranged a plan which should relieve
us of their attentions. We have a man on board
who can imitate any handwriting, and he will write


a letter to them in Robertson?s hand telling them
that he is here of his own free will, and that he
wants their consent to sell his discovery to us for
a certain sum of money.?
? But they may refuse to give their consent.?
? In the document I have there is a clause to
the effect that when any of the partners wish to
leave the partnership he simply has to send his
copy of the agreement to the others, and that is
taken as a token that henceforth he does not
consider himself bound to them. When they
receive this document naturally their interest in
matters will cease, and they will be very glad
indeed to accept some money instead of getting
nothing. We might even by some careful
scheming get them to tell us the secret, for once
they think we have the knowledge already they?ll
be off their guard, and the rest is easy.?
? But what will you do with the boy we have,
then? ?
? Hand him over to Valli, and then dump him
ashore somewhere. We won?t need him when we
know how it is done ourselves, and a lot of the
men are a bit afraid of him, he reminds them so
much of old Mac.?
? Vair well then, sir ; there are clouds on the
sky gathering. We shall cast off ships, for of
sudden squall I have a fear.?
? Very good, I?ll give the order now. You will
remain in command of the Lancelot , Count. I
wanted you here, but Perry has shown his teeth,
and I?ve got to extract them before I can trust
him now. Take sufficient men to man her and
keep as close as you can to us. All your prisoners
are with us. We?ll revive some old customs if


they cause trouble. The Lancelot has a Marconi
installation, hasn?t she? ?
Yes, sir, but we can fit in our own hydro-
radiating system without much trouble.?
The speakers moved forward to see about the
casting off of the two ships, and Robertson sat
up. ?This is getting interesting,? he said. ?I
understand a good many things now. That man
who came to me while in Oban Bay is the mys-
terious Chief every one talks of, and he and
Southwood and Fitzgerald are chasing us. Then
there is old Mac, whom it seems I resemble.
Jupiter ! the man they call the Chief told me at
Oban that my father was with them. Can it be
possible? No, I?ll not allow myself to get excited.
I must keep cool at all costs, and I must also get
that agreement of ours. I had forgotten all about
it.?
He slid down on deck, and crossing to the other
side, began to make his way stealthily along to the
main companion-way. All the men were now en-
gaged in casting off the two ships and he was not
observed, and seeing that Hassenrahn and some
others were still talking forward, he slipped down
into the saloon and ran through it. ** Boldness is
my only chance,? he muttered. ?No one is about
now, and I?ll risk it.? He was standing outside
Hassenrahn?s private cabin. Softly he tried the
door. It was not locked, strangely enough, and
yielded before him, and in half a minute he was
inside. ? I suppose my lease of life will terminate
suddenly if I am caught now,? he laughed to him-
self just a trifle hysterically, turning out some
papers in Hassenrahn?s desk. ? I wonder why he
has left everything so carelessly. Ah ! here is the

his vigilance was rewarded by Hassenrahn s return,
but this time he was accompanied by an elderly
gentleman of unmistakable American appearance.
Hassenrahn had now lost all trace of his former
hurry, and, motioning his companion to a seat on
the couch which hid the tube in which Robertson
lay, he began :
?Well, Mr. Collins, I must apologise for my
apparent neglect, but the fact is I have been much
troubled by internal disturbances.?
? Let me recommend Smith and Brown?s patent
pills,? interrupted his companion ; ? they are
guaranteed to cure all internal complaints.
? The troubles to which I referred in the best
English at my command are not such as can be
cured by the means you advise,? said Hassenrahn
with a laugh ; ?I was thinking of dissensions
among ourselves, in the ranks of the Cosmopo-
lites.?
? Oh, I see. The shareholders are getting
nasty, are they? I know the feeling well. They
want to kick the Directors from here to Chicago
with one kick. Shake, old man; I?ve been
a Director myself.?
? You are still wrong, Mr. Collins. The Cos-
mopolites, as we term ourselves, are fairly well
pleased with their governing board, of which at
present I am chief. We arrange things so that
they can get plenty of money, and that is what most
of them desire in the meantime. Of course, when
they discover that money is a false god, they?ll
probably change their mind. No, it is not trouble
between the men and the leaders that I meant, it
is discord between themselves. You see, we are
Cosmopolites. There are scarcely two men on
board of the same nationality.?


? I guess, then, Mister, the cause of your trouble
ain?t far to seek. Sack the whole howling mob
of them, and advertise for half their number of
Americans and Britishers to fill their places.?
? I can?t discharge the Cosmopolites,? said Has-
senrahn ; ? the last time that game was tried
proved unfortunate for the man who tried it. It
also resulted in the chieftainship falling to me.?
? I see. You murdered the other fellow? ?
The old man was certainly frank.
??Not quite. He jumped through a porthole
into the sea.?
? Poor beggar ! I suppose he got wet. But I
say, Mister ?you haven?t given me your handle yet,
you know ?in my own room on that steam yacht,
which also belonged to me, were some boxes of
very good cigars. Now, you didn?t happen to
come across them, did you? for I could do a good
smoke now.?
? You will find that those cigars in that box
on your left are not bad. I prefer them to any
other variety, but I regret that your own special
brand was left on your yacht. You will find them
intact, however, on your return. The Cosmopolites
are not paltry thieves.?
? No, I guess they are whole hoggers. You
don?t object to smoking in your cabin, I hope, for
you?ll have to kick me out if you do. Valeria ?
my daughter, you know ?allows me to smoke in
my own.?
? And you may smoke here, too, sir, and when
you light up we?ll talk business.?
? I never do that ?My ! this isn?t a bad smoke.
Where do you get them? I suppose these will run
you about ten cents apiece wholesale? ?I have


retired from business long ago, and my secretary
attends to all correspondence.?
? Nevertheless, I am afraid you will have to
give this matter your personal consideration.?
?I?ll have to, will I? I?d have you to know,
sir, that Obadiah Z. Collins is his own master, and
recognises no authority on earth but the great
United States Constitution. Gosh ! I wish Valeria
heard you.?
? But until we have come to an understanding
one way or another you must remain on this ship.
? Well, it isn?t a bad ship, so far as its sailing
powers and the cooking arrangements are con-
cerned, and it is not every day I meet a man of
your intelligence to talk to. I guess I?ll be quite
comfortable on board until you get tired of me?
but there, I forgot ; you were telling me about
things not going as smoothly as they might among
your crew.?
? That was of no importance. They are inclined
to be superstitious, that is all.?
? Foreigners always are. I wouldn t have a
dirty German on my ship for all ?
? I am a German, sir.?
? Are you, now? Well, who would have guessed
it? I say, mister, take a tip from old Obadiah :
don?t tell any one, and they?ll never know.?
? But I am proud of my nationality. I consider
a German is the highest effort of civilisation.?
? But you never saw what old Nature has done
in the way of civilising up Chicago way. Why,
even the tax-collectors say ? please ? to you there,
dogs bark in five different languages, and ?
? I know Chicago very well,? interrupted Has-
senrahn with a weary smile ; ? but you can?t


make me lose my temper by saying things against
Germany, Mr. Collins. I am a Cosmopolitan my-
self from choice. All countries are alike to me,
and I certainly have more enemies in Germany
than in all the rest of the world put together. I
suspect you will understand that fact readily.?
?? Yes, old man, I can feel with you there, for
do you know the whole of Europe thinks and says
nice things about me ; but I guess you?ll hunt
round the States from ?Frisco to New York and
back again and not find any one who doesn?t think
the world would be better if I gave up my ticket.?
?We understand each other fully, then, Mr.
Collins. As a matter of fact, the gentlemen on
this ship place a fairly high value on you. Of
course, your history is well known to us all, also
your thirst for adventure, and the opinions you
have at various times expressed to newspaper men.
Now, the Cosmopolites thought they would do you
and themselves a good turn at the same time by
supplying you with the adventures you were hunt-
ing all over the world to find, and they have, I
think you will admit, done so.?
? And where do the Cosmopolites come in? I
do admit it is an almost unbelievable fact that
I and my ship could be cut out of Table Bay, a
first-class British port, in this twentieth century.
But the idea, Mister? Where do your people come
in? I suppose it is a case of ransom and a promise
of silence afterwards? ?
? One hundred thousand pounds is what the
Cosmopolites expect you to pay them before you
regain your liberty. That price, of course, in-
cludes your daughter, for we do not make war upon
women, and your captive crew.?


? You only fight with the hundred thousand
pounders and old men like me. It is really good
of you not to charge for the others ; I suppose
they can walk away into the sea when they
please? ?*
? You are sarcastic, Mr. Collins.?
? Now, do you tell me so? Oh, I say, who is
your tailor, and where does he hang out? I guess
those pants of yours are a work of genuine art.?
? Really, sir, I am at a loss to understand you.
The fact that you, with your daughter, and her
companion, and your ship?s crew ?at least, all that
we didn?t provide before you left Melbourne ?are
prisoners in the hands of a company of men who
recognise no law but their own, does not seem to
have impressed you much,?
?Not five cents? worth, sir. I?ve had dealings
with miserable foreigners before. Why, when a
mob of Polish Jews, or Dagoes, or something else,
tried to run up a strike in my works, and threatened
to burn the place, I just turned the hose-pipe on
them, and they got so broken-hearted at being
washed that they went back to their work without
a murmur.?
? On this ship, sir, you must remember that it
is you who are the foreigner. Every man on
board, too, has been picked from the cities of the
world for some special talent he possessed. The
world at present, though, offers more inducement
to such men to become breakers of all State laws
than it does to make them become good, honest,
respectable, but half-starved citizens of the State
in which the accident of birth first placed
them.?
? Cut it short, Mister ; you could never afford


to pay full advertising rates for all that. Get to
the point.?
? I stated that long ago. Your ransom is one
hundred thousand pounds.?
? And if I don?t stump up? ?
? You will remain a prisoner on our island until
you do, and I think we can find means to make
that alternative a bad speculation for you.?
? A hundred thousand pounds,? mused the old
gentleman ; ? wal, I guess that isn?t much to me,
but I?ll be onternally spifflicated if the idea of
being bested goes down with me. I?ll tell you,
Mr. Pirate, I?ll see Valeria and see what engage-
ments she has on hand. If there?s anything press-
ing we?ll pay and go ; but if she hasn?t I?ll ?
well. I?ll see you No, I told her I wouldn?t
swear. I?ll think it over, Mr. Pirate.?
? I am extremely sorry I cannot give you my
name, Mr. Collins. But it so happens that your
daughter knows me. We met in New York, Lon-
don, Berlin, and Paris, and I have, in connection
with her, an alternative to offer you.?
? Oh, were you one of the Johnnies who were
always pestering her wherever we went? ?
? I trust not. But my proposition is this. If
you will remove any objections you may have
formed towards me, and give your consent to my
winning your daughter?s hand, I will pay the
hundred thousand pounds ransom myself and land
you wherever you wish, or put you on board your
steamer again.?
The old man looked at the German for a long
time without saying a word. ? Young man,? he
observed finally, ? there?s something about you that
I like, but there?s a heap more I don?t like. If


you mean that I am simply not to use my influence
against you and allow you to play for yourself,
I don?t need you to pay my fine ; but if your
proposal means that to save that paltry bit of
money I?ve got to sell my girl, I?ll?l?ll offer
a million dollars to the men on this ship to mutiny
and string you up to one of the yard-arms.?
** My dear sir, you are excited needlessly . I
am not asking you to favour me.?
?? And I tell you, sir, that no pirate?be he
foreigner or not, and have a dozen titles tacked
to his name?will ever have my goodwill. Valeria
knows that what will give her happiness will please
me, and I will not influence her in any way. Bring
me a pen and ink and I?ll pay you your bill now.
Order your ship to put back to Cape Town.?
? You have misunderstood me, Mr. Collins, and
if you will only allow me to explain I think I can
make that much clear to you. In the first place,
while I may deserve the term ? pirate ??l am not
going to attempt to justify myself?l am not at
heart one who glories in evil-doing. I am the
Chief of the Cosmopolites, it is true, but until
lately their record was clean. The last Chief
and I were rivals ; we both met your daughter at
the same time. I was, and am, a member of one
of the, shall we say, highest houses in Germany.
The late Chief was an Englishman, also of good
family. Well, about a year ago, when you first
bemoaned the fact ?in the newspapers?that the
days of adventure were past, I saw the lady in
Paris, and she laughed at me. She shared the
same idea that you had, and evidently wished to
bring some romance into existence on this planet
She said in effect ; ?We are sailing away to-


228 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
morrow, I don?t know where ; I don?t care for
any man, but the first who finds us out and can
overtake us, allowing that he is one to whom I
have given permission to try, I will be favourably
disposed towards.? Your ship sailed off, and after
a week?s start we followed. The Chief, at that
time, of the Cosmopolites ?I was his lieutenant
then ?did not know that we were rivals, nor am I
aware that he knows it yet, if he is alive ; but
after hunting round the globe for six months he
apparently suspected me of double dealing,
wrongly I may say ; and under the pretext that
the Cosmopolites had degenerated into ocean para-
sites, or were shaping that way, tried to disband
the society. He was fairly correct in his suspicions
as to the desires of the men, for they had tasted
of the fruits forbidden to others, but free to them
because of our vessel?s speed and many other dis-
coveries which they had as a body made, which
rendered them safe from the reach of any Govern-
ment. At any rate, he was deposed ; and, know-
ing that my best chance of finding you lay in my
retaining command of this ship, I became the Chief.
Since then we have done many things for which
several Governments would call us to account if
they knew ; but now I intend leaving the Cos-
mopolites, and, after removing some treasure from
our island, will do my best to lead the life of a
scientifically-inclined American gentleman.?
? That is a most remarkable story you have told
me, and I am all-fired to know the finish,? said
Mr. Collins, when Hassenrahn concluded ; ? but
what happened to the other fellow?the man you
deposed for not being bad enough, and for being
silly enough to think of playing a game square? ?


The German winced. Mr. Collins had a frank
way of putting things that was decidedly not plea-
sant. ? Oh, he escaped, as I mentioned before.?
? And you heard no more of him? ?
? Nothing for about six months, until just a week
or so ago, when we found that he had almost got
a vessel built to run us off the sea. You see, when
he escaped he took with him a most wonderful
engineer, who had invented a method of accelerat-
ing our ship?s speed. He took his secret with
him, and as there was thus the possibility of their
gathering new men around them, and making
things unpleasant for us, we had to take steps to
save ourselves. We did so, and now have the
system of increasing the speed working again. I
do not expect he will trouble us further.
?That?s a lie, young man, and you know it.
I saw your face change as you spoke. You are
living in dread of him now. Hallo ! what?s the
rumpus about outside?
? Confound those people 1 ?? exclaimed Hassen-
rahn angrily, as a wild tumult of arguing voices
rose outside his cabin door. What can be the
matter now? ? He threw the door open and con-
fronted the men. ?Well, what is it?? he de-
manded ; ? can I not have even an hour free from
your disputes? You are more like a crowd of
madmen than men of intellect.?
? That ees all right,? cried one, ? but there ees
somedinks more than intellect has got nodink to
do with which. Signor Antonio ees lying more
than three halfs dead in the alleyway, an? he say
it was you who kill him.?
?What! You are dreaming. Signor Antonio
lying in the alleyway? Who did it? ?


He say you,? shouted several men ; ? we come
to see what you mean by it.?
Men, there is something in this that needs
looking after,? cried Hassenrahn ; ? I have not
been out of this cabin since I left the meeting an
hour ago. Search the ship at once. Some one is
doing this. Is Perry locked up securely? ?
? It was not Perry,? answered one man, ? him I
lock up mineself. We say it vas you.?
A sullen roar greeted this statement. The men
were of the same opinion, for already two of their
number had told the same story of having been
suddenly attacked by Hassenrahn.
? I guess you can go your bottom dollar on
the fact that it was not this gentleman who did
any monkey tricks, if they were done inside the
last hour,? put in Mr. Collins ; ? I can clear him
of that. He has been trying to get a hundred
thousand for you out of me.?
But he was seen ! ? chorused several men,
coming into the room aggressively ; ? Pedro and
Ivan saw him run away.?
? You certainly did not see me, men,? spoke
Hassenrahn coldly. ? But come and let us look
into the matter. This sort of thing cannot be
allowed to go on. Mr. Collins, kindly refrain
from joining this party. You will find your
daughter and her friend in cabin number twenty ?
?that suite is reserved for them?or you can smoke
here until my return.?
He went away with the men, and, stiff and sore,
the youth cramped up in the tube who had heard
every word began to wriggle backwards towards
his own cabin. He gained it, and after closing
the manhole door and removing the chain that


fastened down the spy-trap, he rubbed his limbs
until circulation had been restored. He was think-
ing all the time, and some ideas were forming
themselves in his brain. ? I think I will postpone
wrecking those engines in the meantime,? he re-
marked ; ? there seem to be other agents working
on board this ship, who, if not friendly to me,
are certainly antagonistic to the Cosmopolites.
But all the same, I saw Hassenrahn enter his cabin
and go out again before he came back with Mr.
Collins. Anyhow, I am going to bore a hole into
cabin twenty as soon as possible. I want a talk
with its occupants.?
While Robertson was still working out the
details of a plan he had conceived the spy-trap
opened, and Hassenrahn?s voice said ; ? Boy, did
you hear any one passing your cabin lately? ?
? Only those men you have put on sentry,?
answered the boy. ? Why? ?
? I want a talk with you. Open your cabin door
and I?ll come down. I do not care to carry on a
conversation through a hole.?
? All right, sir,? Robertson replied, ? I am glad
you?ve grown tired of doing that.? The trap closed,
and Robertson hurriedly put everything in order so
that no suspicions might be aroused. Then he
started violently. The thought had just occurred
that perhaps Hassenrahn had gone mad and was
now coming to treat him as he had already done
the two other men. ?If he does, I am done for,?
he muttered, ? for I haven?t a weapon of any
kind.? He threw open the door, nevertheless, and
next minute Hassenrahn, who had to descend by
means of the companion-way and walk through the
saloon before reaching the door, entered. His face


was pale, and he seemed tired. He sat down upon
the edge of the berth and looked round the room.
? When did you see Perry last? ? he said sud-
denly, watching the boy?s face closely.
? I think it was yesterday, but I have lost all
account of time, and can?t feel sure. You ought
to know yourself, sir, for you heard all our con-
versation.?
? You haven?t seen him since, then? ? The
speaker seemed incredulous.
??No. That door has not opened since then
until just now, unless to admit Wun Lung.?
Hassenrahn rose and walked up to the boiler-
shaped mixing chambers. Robertson?s heart
ceased beating for the moment, but quickly he
recovered himself.
? I see you have full pressure on the gauges,?
Hassenrahn remarked, examining the dials of the
gas gauges. ? You are very foolish, boy, in not
telling me your secret.?
? I might get thrown into the sea if I did that,?
laughed Robertson. ? I would be of no further use
to the Cosmopolites,?
? I have already given you my word as to what
I should do. Remember, if we do find it out for
ourselves, we?ll not consider you then.?
? I don?t expect you to, but I am fairly confident
you cannot find out.?
? Supposing we opened this chamber? ?
?You have done so several times already, sir,
and only filled the ship with evil-smelling gas as
the result Besides, if you don?t leave me to attend
to my self-imposed duties as I please I?ll simply
not supply any more power.?
? Boy, you should not try to anger me. I have


too much worry for any one man to carry as it is,
and my temper will get beyond my control some
day.?
? I have no desire to try your patience, sir, I am
merely determined to keep my secret. You have
the use of it while I am with you, although I know
from the revolutions of the engines you are not
utilising it just now,?
? No, we are going easy to allow the yacht to
catch up on us. Very likely it will bring me the
knowledge of your secret power, for the men en-
trusted with the matter of seeing your young
friends have wonderful means of extracting infor-
mation.?
Hassenrahn said this in a tone which was
intended to be significant, but Robertson pretended
not to notice. He knew his comrades were well
protected, from the various conversations he had
overheard, and although he did not choose to en-
lighten Hassenrahn on the point, he also knew that
they could not give any information because they
knew nothing about it. That they were already
following up he felt assured, for men like the Chief
and old Macpherson could not be thrown off the
scent very readily.
? I quite believe you have some very clever
people in your ranks,? Robertson said, ? but that
won?t save them when nemesis overtakes them.?
? Nemesis, boy 1 Who told you of the
Nemesis? ? Hassenrahn was again excited.
? I did not say the Nemesis, sir ; I meant that
some day your people will be called to account.
Not that I shall be instrumental in bringing it
about, for I have only one grievance to complain
of, and if you would fix that spy-hole of yours so
that it couldn?t open I wouldn?t have any.?


? I?ll not trouble you again in that direction,
my lad ; I?m tired of watching you. But remem-
ber, if you go outside this cabin you will most
assuredly suffer for it. The men are almost mad
just now, and some of them think it was you, after
seeing the way you handled Dutchy.?
?Me, sir, what have I done? What do you
mean? ??
? Oh, I forgot you couldn?t know. Some one
wonderfully good at disguising himself, and a very
skilful person as well, is going about the ship
causing disturbances. But I must go now, I am
very tired of everything.?
Robertson did not reply, and next moment the
German had gone.
Shortly after Wun Lung brought along his lunch
and volunteered the information that the ? Melican
lady ? was ? vely pletty.? In answer to further
inquiries the Oriental said : ? She be two of hull.
No know one Horn odel. Ole man give me sove-
leign an? telly me be good to his daughtel, an? he
give me mole money than I wanty,?
For a moment Robertson thought of asking Wun
Lung to take a message from him to Miss Collins,
but reflection made him see that such a course
would have been disastrous. If he gave Wun Lung
a verbal message he might bungle it, and might
also deliver it to Hassenrahn, and if he wrote a line
the chances were that Hassenrahn would also get
it. He therefore allowed the Chinaman to depart
with the utensils, and proceeded to elaborate his
plan of action. In the midst of this, however,
he remembered that he had left the hole he had
bored open to the gaze of any one in Hassenrahn?s
cabin who might have an eye for details ; so, fasten-


ing the trap above as a precaution, and seeing that
his door was secure against visitors, he once more
opened the empty mixing chamber and worked his
way along to the scene of his morning?s exploits.
Apparently no one had noticed anything wrong,
so plugging the hole with the tapered rivet he had
prepared, and which, when fitted, made the hole
extremely difficult to detect, he continued to where
the tube became vertical, so that he could turn
round for his homeward journey.
When he reached the elbow which dipped into
the engine-room he could not resist the temptation
to slide down and have a look at things. The
engineer on duty was standing where the man had
stood the night before. He seemed to be a
Spaniard from his general appearance, and he held
a cocked revolver in his hand. ? The Cosmopolites
are growing into leetle childs,? he said aloud, soon
after the watcher and listener had arrived. ?Ah !
it is good. A vuestra salad my bandelero! If you
come visit me I will shoot you first and then we
shall see who you are. I am not afraid.? He
came over and placed his weapon inside the tube
while he oiled some gearing which a touch of his
finger showed was hot. Robertson at once picked
up the revolver and climbed up to the elbow.
While he sat there a loud Spanish curse broke
out, and a man?s hand groped in the bottom of
the tube. But the noises ceased abruptly, and
climbing down again, Robertson saw the engineer
lying across the platform mounted beside the valve
gearing, with the tireless and �biquitous Hassen-
rahn going through his pockets as he had done with
the other the night before.
? Must I go over the whole ship before I find


Valli? ? the German muttered. ? I?ll have to
vanish now until night for I am taking too much
risk.?
?By Jupiter ! you are,? spoke Robertson to
himself, ?for I could drop you where you stand
just now as easily as I can wink.?
The German walked away, and, not thinking it
advisable to remain longer in the vicinity, Robert-
son pulled himself up the tube and a few minutes
later was again in his own cabin.
? I have now got a weapon of defence,? he
remarked, pleased to see that his revolver was a
first-class one in every way ; ? and when the coast
is likely to be clear to-night I shall call upon Miss
Collins by my own tube.?


CHAPTER XI
WHO SHOT HASSENRAHN?
Miss Collins and her friend, Miss Vanderbilt,
sat together in the largest of the suites of cabins
grouped under the number ? twenty.? It was
about nine o?clock at night, and a pleasant breeze
was blowing in through the open portholes. Mr.
Collins had left them a few minutes before and
the aroma of his cigar still hung about the apart-
ment. Both ladies were well endowed with
Nature?s charms, and were so like each other in
appearance that they might easily have been mis-
taken for twin sisters. Yet there was no relation-
ship between them. They were the dearest of
friends only, and Vanderbilt had accompanied
Miss Collins on the Lancelot because Mr. Collins
was the trustee of her late father?s estate, and,
like Miss Collins, she desired to see the world and
its peoples at closer quarters than could be possible
by simply touring on a great ocean liner. They
had a maid between them, but she had received
such a fright on learning that they were in the
hands of a gang of ocean outlaws that she had
not yet recovered sufficiently to be able to attend
to her mistresses.
? What strange noise is that now, Valeria? ?
337


suddenly asked Miss Vanderbilt, laying down an
album of photographs Hassenrahn had sent in for
their entertainment. ? This awful ship is full of
strange sounds.?
But noises will not harm us, Daisy,?- replied
Valeria, ? and look at the splendid adventure we?re
having. We can write a book between us when
we get back to New York which will take the
world by storm, and prove that the days of romance
are not yet past.?
? All the same I wish we were back on the
Lancelot. It?s not pleasant to think that we are
at the mercy of a gang of cut-throats, even
although it is a first-rate adventure. But, dear me !
that noise comes from under the sofa, it must be
rats. I?ll look.? Miss Vanderbilt raised some
hanging drapery and then exclaimed : ? Why,
Valeria, there is a big pipe here, and I think that
sound is coming from it.?
? Very likely. Father said this ship was driven
by gas, and that will be one of the gas-pipes.
There are often noises in gas and water pipes.?
? But surely a gas-pipe doesn?t require to be
so large as that. Why, a man could go through
that pipe.?
41 Don?t you remember our lessons in chemistry,
Daisy? Gas works at practically no pressure, and
to convey such an amount of gas as must be neces-
sary to drive a ship of this size must require a
very large pipe indeed.?
41 But the noise has stopped now ?
44 And I think we?d better get to bed, Daisy ; I
am sure none of us slept any last night.?
44 I think it is the best idea, Valeria, but tell Mr.
Collins to-morrow to use my money if he needs


it for our ransom. After all, I suppose that ques-
tion is the only thing that stands between us and
our own ship. The people whose prisoners we are
are merely glorified brigands ?
? Perhaps not, Daisy. Don?t you remember
our little joke in Paris? I think our capture
has some connection with that foolish idea of
ours. I wonder, if it is true, who it is that has
contrived it.?
? But we only spoke to two people on that
subject.?
? Yes, and what I am anxious about is which
of those two is our captor. You remember we
each dressed alike and told the same story. We
were in fun, of course, but if it is one of those
gentlemen who is responsible for this, he may
want us to complete our bargain.?
? Which would be rather awkward if he were
the wrong man.? Miss Vanderbilt smiled as she
spoke ; she was thinking of something that her
companion evidently did not know.
? I would not mind if it were that handsome
Englishman. He is my ideal of a man, so brave
and kind-hearted, so strong, and yet so gentle ?
? Oh, stop, Valeria, lam going to bed. I?ll not
put out the lights until you come.? Miss Vander-
bilt ran off, and Miss Collins sat for a moment
thinking.
? Yes, I am sleepy, I?ll follow Daisy?s example,?
she spoke aloud, ? but I wonder if my hero is
really near just now. Dear me ! what was that?
I am sure I heard a voice.? She stood up and
looked round the cabin, not a little alarmed, but
she could see nothing.
? Miss Collins ! ?


Again she started. The sound seemed to come
from under the couch. She was by no means a
timid girl, and the thought that some one was
in the room who had no right to be there did
not affect her as it would most girls. She pro-
duced a tiny gold-mounted revolver from some
part of her dress, and silently walked over and
raised the drapery which hid the gas-tube from
view. But no one was there. Much mystified,
the girl next examined every corner of the cabin
which might conceal a man, but nothing came
of the search. ?It must have been my fancy,?
she said aloud ; ? there certainly is no one here.?
? I am a friend, Miss Collins, don?t scream.?
There was no doubt about the voice this time,
and Miss Collins again moved towards the couch.
? I guess I am not one of the screaming kind,
Mr. Friend,? she said. ? Come out this moment
and show yourself, or I?ll put six shots into you.
Why, where are you? ? She could see nothing
but the great gas-tube.
? I am a prisoner on this pirate ship like your-
self, Miss Collins,? came the voice from some-
where. ? I know everything about why you are
here, and I have some knowledge which I know
will be pleasing to you.?
? But who are you, and where are you? I do
not talk to people, even at the end of a revolver,
without knowing who they are.?
? Will you promise not to give me away if I
tell you? ?
? Good gracious ! Is it so deadly as all that?
Have you discovered how to make yourself in-
visible? Or are you speaking from underneath
the ship? I am eager to get that knowledge of

yours, however, so I ?ll risk giving my promise
not to tell upon you.?
?Very well. My name is James Robertson.
I was taken on board this ship against my will
by one of the men you spoke of to-night. He
and the other one are deadly enemies, and Hassen-
rahn is even now running away from the Chief.
My comrades are with him, though, and it is only a
question of time as to when this ship will be run
down. I can render this ship helpless whenever I
like ?
? Stop a minute. From the sound of your voice
I fancy you are not very old.?
?Time can remedy that fault, Miss Collins.?
? And I was going to say, the way you talk
of Chiefs and Hassenrahns and everything else,
in one mouthful, suggests that those people, you,
and I are taking leading parts in some per-
formance. But show yourself, I want to see you.?
? I am sorry that it is impossible to arrange that
just now.?
? Why, are you afraid I might afterwards re-
cognise you? ?
? Hardly ; but you see I am inside this gas-
pipe, and I can?t very well come out.?
? Horrors ! In the gas-pipe 1 What are you
doing in there? ?
? Oh, it is not so bad as you might think. It
affords a passage all over the ship, and enables
me to spy upon the gang. There is no gas in
this tube ?but please come closer. People pass-
ing your cabin door might hear.?
?No, this cabin opens into another one. You
needn t be afraid to speak, for it contains only
my friend, Miss Vanderbilt. But how can your
16


voice come through that tube? Will the people
in the other cabins through which this pipe passes
not also hear you? ?
? I don?t think so. I have bored a hole through
into your cabin, and I am speaking into that hole.
I can?t see you though, for when I put my eye
to the hole it just catches the bottom half of that
porthole. I will bore another hole if you will
wait a few minutes.?
? Say, Mr. Robertson, are you the young en-
gineer who works the gas apparatus that gives
this ship its great speed? ?
? I suppose so ; but a ship of even greater speed
is following us ?
? Then I know something about you. The
chief pirate here told my father a long story in
which a brilliant young Scotch engineer was men-
tioned several times, and my papa of course told
me. You say that this is really a pirate ship? I
suppose that means that a ransom will set us
free? ?
? A hundred thousand pounds is the price fixed
by the gang, but Hassenrahn told your father that
you were valued by him much higher than that, and
from what I heard of their conversation this morn-
ing I am inclined to think that even although your
father paid the money Hassenrahn would not let
you go,?
? Indeed ! Who is Hassenrahn? ? Miss
Collins?s eyes flashed angrily, but Robertson of
course could not see.
?The present chief of this ship. He is a
German, who, I take it, had to leave his country
for reasons best known to himself. He is also
one of the two men who are trying to provide you


with some romance by chasing you all over the
world ?
? Just you stop right there, young man. Where
and how did you get all your information? ?
? Heard it from Hassenrahn himself. I have a
hole bored into his cabin, too. I also heard you
and your friend talking to-night, and I have got
wonderfully used at putting two and two together
since I came on board this ship.?
?You mentioned some one called the Chief ;
who is he? ?
? The other man. A tall, strong, good-looking
fellow?at least that was how he looked to me,
but I have heard that he is about the best man
at altering his features and otherwise disguising
himself that any one knows. He chased this ship
to Cape Town, and I expect he is not very far
away now. I will wreck the engines when I think
the proper time comes so as to allow him to come
up.?
? Mr. Robertson, could I go through that
pipe? ? The question took the youth by surprise.
? I believe you could,? he said, ? if you could
once get in. But what good would that do? ?
? I want to see and hear all about this ship. I
want to have a look at Mr. Hassenrahn, and I
want some adventure, anyway. Besides, if we
are really likely to be followed, it would be well
if I had a place to hide when the pirate people
see that they are being overtaken.?
? But there is only one entrance into this tube,
and that is by means of the manhole door in the
gas-mixing chamber in my room. You can?t come
there, even though you wished, for the approaches
to my quarters are guarded night and day.?


? Oh, as to that, we are watched pretty
closely, too. We were told that we must not go
outside our cabins, or that if we did no one would
be responsible for what might happen. But I
thought you were a clever engineer. What is
the good of being that if you cannot devise some
simple method of allowing me to share the excite-
ment you must experience as an unseen and un-
expected watcher and listener? I am sure if I
were an engineer I could do it.?
? But ?
? Oh, yes, bring in the ? buts,? that is what my
father does, and then when I won t listen to them
he tells me I am not logical.
? Oh, I don?t expect you to be logical. No
woman can reason correctly, nor see the force of
it in others. But how on earth could you crawl
through this gas-pipe? Why, it needs a man used
to this sort of work to be able to do that.?
? And yet you took a lot of trouble to make
yourself known to me. What service have you
been to me by merely letting me know that you
exist, if you cannot help me in any other way?
Can yo u find means to get me into that pipe, or
can you not? If you can?t, never call yourself an
engineer again, for I could almost break into it
myself if I had anything more than a pair of
scissors and some needles in my possession to
work with.?
? I can cut out a hole large enough for you to
pass through, and I shall now proceed to do that ;
but it will be seen, and then any advantage we
might have is lost.?
? No, it isn?t. Cut out the hole as you say ; the
piece that comes out can be fastened on again


with a piece of silk painted to match the rest of
the pipe, and the joint will never be noticed, even
supposing that any one came into this cabin to pry
into my affairs.?
? All right, just watch that no one comes, and
I?ll bore a circle of holes into the pipe and then
file the edges away. You get something to catch
the borings when the drill breaks through.?
Miss Collins?s eyes sparkled with excitement.
Here was the promise of adventure such as her
heart loved. She ran into the next cabin and saw
that her friend was asleep, then returning, she
closed and locked the door, and spread a piece
of cloth under the couch as directed by Robert-
son. Meanwhile that gentleman had marked off
an ellipse on the metal forming the inside of the
tube, and soon he had mounted his ratchet and had
begun to bore holes along this line so as to sur-
round the oval piece of metal with a number of
holes.
? How many holes must you bore before you
will have cut out a piece large enough for me to
pass through? ? Miss Collins inquired, as the drill
pierced the metal the fifth time.
? Eighty at least,? answered the worker inside.
? I am boring out a manhole fifteen inches by
eleven, and my drill is a half-inch one. I hope
it will see me through, for I may not be able to
steal more, and I have no means of sharpen-
ing it.?
? But, dear me, it will take all night to bore all
these holes,? said the lady. ? Isn?t there any
quicker way? ?
??Yes, with a hammer and a couple of good
foal?s-foot chisels I could cut out this oval much


faster, but the pirates would hear the hammer
strokes, and that would spoil everything. But
you go away and sleep, I will keep going until
the job is finished, or morning comes, or we?re
caught
? Go away and sleep, indeed,? retorted Miss
Collins. ?It is easily seen that you don?t think
much of women. Can?t I help? ?
? No, you?ll keep me back. Women are no use
when it comes to engineering. Hallo ! that hole
didn?t take long.?-?
? But I am of use,?? persisted the lady, ? and
Ido know something about engineering. I have
been in the engine-room of the Lusitania , and I?ve
seen a motor-car turned upside down in the road-
way ?
? Here?s a file,? interrupted Robertson brus-
quely. ? Try and file away the metal between
those holes. I can?t pass you out a handle, so
protect your hands in some way. No, no, you
can?t file that way. You?re gripping it at the
wrong end ; that?s better now. I wonder what
Harry and Bob would say if they knew I had
a young lady for an apprentice.?
? They would say you were very fortunate in-
deed, if they are anything more than very young
schoolboys.?
?My ! we?re fairly doing it. There?s another
hole.? Robertson was in a mood for work. He
did not feel inclined to pay compliments ; besides,
as yet he had not seen his companion. For a
time they worked in silence, and the number of
holes rapidly increased, being connected together
in one long slot by Miss Collins almost as soon
as they were formed. The metal of the tube was


only a quarter of an inch in thickness. That
gave quite enough strength for all it had to do,
as the gas was practically without pressure until
exploded in the engine cylinder.
Suddenly Miss Collins said : ? Could you men-
tion anything characteristic about this man Has-
senrahn ?something which might help to bring
him before my mind? I don?t seem to recollect
him just now.?
? That is strange, seeing he says you told him
to follow you if he could. He is a fairly tall
man, and has a moustache like the German Em-
peror?s. There is just a trace of a foreign accent
in his voice, and he never seems to get angry ?at
least, in speaking, but I have seen him try to
choke the life out of two men all the same. I
don?t think he is really a bad sort of a fellow ; but
he?s in a state of nerves through handling so many
dirty foreigners, and I don?t think knows exactly
what he wants to do. That?s another half-dozen
holes, we?re nearly a third round now.?
? And the man called the Chief. Who is he,
and what is peculiar about him? ?
? I?ve already told you almost all I know of
him, but from what I overheard to-day I expect
to see him put in an appearance any time. Of
course I work for him because my comrades and
he and Mac have joined forces ?
? Who is Mac? ?
? The engineer who invented this system of gas
propulsion. He, apparently, is always with the
Chief ?
? Ah, yes, dear old Mac ! He looked after
Robert as if he were a child, instead ?
?Did you know Mac? And who is Robert? ?


? Yes, I knew Mr. Macpherson very well indeed.
I have met him in various parts of the world.
As for Robert, I forgot I was speaking aloud
when I allowed the name to slip from me. But
you are my friend, so it doesn?t matter if you
know. Robert is the name sometimes given by his
friends to that mysterious man called the Chief.
I could not connect things at first, but when you
mentioned Mac it struck me at once. All is clear
to me now ; this German and he imagined they
were rivals, and in a foolish moment Miss Vander-
bilt and I set them against each other ?
?No, you didn?t. The Chief never knew that
Hassenrahn was his rival. I heard Hassen-
rahn say that himself to your father. The Chief
owned this ship, and the German was one of
his lieutenants, and when you and your friend
gave them your challenge, Hassenrahn schemed
to get rid of the Chief. The men reported to
him that he had been killed in Cape Town while
we were there, but he knows better than to believe
that yarn. You?ll see the Chief, Mac, and my
two comrades, Harry Southwood and Bob Fitz-
gerald, coming up alongside some morning and
blowing this craft out of the water.
? But what will we do then? ?
? We?ll think that out. But see, we?re half way
round now and it?s only midnight. There goes
eight bells.??
And so they talked on till about four o?clock
in the morning, when Robertson bored the last
hole and pushed out the piece of metal they had
been cutting round so patiently. Then while he
dressed up the edges, Miss Collins swept up the
borings and cast them through the porthole. A


piece of cloth the same colour as the gas-pipe was
then glued over the cut-out door, and the latter
was roughly hinged in its place again so that it
could be opened out at will but would always fall
back over the hole whenever set free.
? Well, partner,? said Miss Collins, ? we?ve
done it. Come out into the cabin now and let us
see each other ; you must be cramped lying in
that hole so long.?
Robertson painfully dragged himself out, and
stood erect in the cabin. ?By Jupiter ! I m all
knots,? he laughed, ? I?ll have to untie myself.
? Why, you are only a boy,? Miss Collins cried,
gazing at him, ? and you are just the image of
Mr. Macpherson.?
? I am nearly nineteen,? answered Robertson,
looking at the beautiful girl in front of him, and
I don?t think you are any more yourself.?
? Ah ! now you have paid me a compliment
after all. I knew you would some time.?
? Oh, our work is finished now, and I see you ?
and I meant no compliment. Are you ready to
risk an exploring trip in my tube? We have just
time to make a round before the ship becomes
alive with Cosmopolites.?
? Lead on then, Mr. Robertson. Shall I take
my revolver? ?
??No, if we are discovered your little toy
wouldn?t help us. I?ve got a Smith and Wesson
with me.?
They were now inside the tube, and after giving
his companion some hints as to the best means of
locomotion, Robertson led the way towards the
engine-room, his portable electric lamp proving
quite sufficient to light up the long tunnel that


yawned ahead. Suddenly he stopped. ?I forgot
to tell you to mind those rivet-heads that stick up
here and there along your right-hand side. These
are the plugs of my spy-holes into some of the
cabins. Hassenrahn?s is just a yard or two ahead.?
? And whose is this just at my face? There?s a
light in it ; I am going to look through.?
??No, no, wait a minute. I don?t know whose
cabin that is. It is some one of importance who
stays there, for it must be next to Hassenrahn?s.?
? But I want to see what he is doing at this
hour,?
? Then wait, and don?t move or make a sound
until I go along to the engine-room elbow and
get turned. I will be back in no time, and then
I can show you how to look.?
? All right, I had forgotten that you couldn?t
see with your feet, and that you can?t turn round
inside this tube. Hurry up though, I don?t like
being left alone.
Swiftly Robertson screwed along to the elbow,
and turning round there, he soon got back to where
his companion awaited him. Their heads were
now together, and just before he withdrew the
rivet plug he said : ? Now, remember you must
not speak after this rivet is out. They can?t hear
our voices just now except at the opening in the
engine-room, and it isn?t likely any one is listen-
ing there. If you see anything that surprises you
make signs to me.? He pulled out the rivet and
Miss Collins applied her eye. Next moment she
placed her hand over the hole and looked up at
Robertson in unmistakable inquiry. He at once
looked through, and understood her glance. On
the floor, within a foot of his eye, lay a man


gagged and bound. Blood oozed from an ugly
gash in his forehead, and his eyes were wide open,
staring fixedly at some object which Robertson
could not see. Either the man was dead, or some-
thing was fascinating him. Seated on an over-
turned cabin trunk, with his back towards the spy-
hole, was another man, evidently he who was re-
sponsible for the state of the bound man. He was
examining papers he had discovered in the trunk,
and was apparently indifferent to his surroundings.
Just under the porthole was a curious-looking
contrivance from which many wires stretched in
all directions. A keyboard, not unlike that of a
typewriter, was part of the affair, and several small
graduated cards, round which magnetic needles
swung, seemingly erratically, were also within the
watcher?s zone of vision. Robertson replaced the
rivet.
? That is a radio-wave transmitter you can see
under the porthole,? he said to Miss Collins. ?It
is a wonderful invention, and can send wireless
messages to any point within nearly a thousand
miles, if there is a receiving apparatus there in tune
with this one. Never mind the gagged man, that
sort of thing is quite common on this ship. I
suppose the other fellow is Hassenrahn, and he has
some game of his own on hand.?
He once more opened the hole, and the lady
became the watcher. ?? So the code is our own old
one,? she heard the free man mutter, ? and now
I know that the Nemesis is coming up behind, I
will send off a message and then clear out, for
some fool may blunder in here at any moment, and
I don?t want to start my wholesale game just yet.?
At that moment Miss Collins uttered an ex-


clamation, and Robertson instantly pulled her back
and covered the hole. ? Quick ! ? she gasped,
before he could speak, ? there is a man standing
over the man sitting on the trunk, ready to plunge
a big knife into him.?
Quickly Robertson applied his eye to the hole.
Miss Collins was right. The man whose back was
to them had moved towards the radio-telegraph
instrument, and was spelling out some words on the
keys. Well the watcher knew that this message
would be flashed into space from a revolving tower
on the foremast, but that fact occupied his mind
but little just then, for he saw a man standing over
the operator with a gleaming knife blade raised
to strike the moment the message was completed.
At that moment the telegraphist turned his face
slightly, and the boy started violently. The face
was not Hassenrahn?s, whose he had expected to
see. It was that of the American, Perry, who was
supposed to be locked up safely. The man behind
also moved at that instant as if to strike, but seeing
that his intended victim had not become aware of
his presence, he resumed his former position and
waited, no doubt smiling grimly at the thought of
allowing the message to be finished before strik-
ing down the operator.
? That is murder ! ? gasped Miss Collins
? Can?t we warn the man? ?
? Not without being found out ourselves,?
answered Robertson. ? Still, I feel that the man
at the telegraph is our friend somehow ?
? Coward ! You would see him murdered before
your eyes for fear of your own miserable self. I
am going to hammer on the tube ?
? Stop ! ? Robertson?s voice was stern. ? I


have never been called a coward before, and I
shall now let common sense go to the winds in
order to vindicate myself.? He drew the revolver
he had taken from the engineer?s improvised press,
and pushed its muzzle through the hole. ? I can t
see to aim,? he continued, ? but I am bound to hit
some one ?
? Take time and calculate,? put in his com-
panion. ? That message is not nearly finished yet.
I can read the key-taps. Hold your hand nearer
me and lower it a trifle.?
? I have got an aim now,? said Robertson, turn-
ing over on his back and pushing his head under
his right arm. ? I can see along the barrel now,
but I?ll never be able to get out of this
position ?
? Get ready, then. He is on the last word ?
A loud reverberating roar, as of a cannon burst-
ing, interrupted her speech, and Robertson with-
drew his smoking weapon and pushed the rivet
in its place.
? Take this lamp, and work your way backwards
to your own cabin,? he whispered. ? I have shot
that man, whoever he was, and will hold this tube
against all comers until you have escaped.?
??What are you talking about, young man?
Who wants to escape? I guess I am an American
girl, and right here am I going to stay as long as
you stay. We?re partners in this deal.?
? But no good can result from your being caught
here with me ?
? Hadn?t you better open the window and let
us see the fun? ? suggested Miss Collins irrele-
vantly. ??lt should be worth seeing by this time.?
??But why give ourselves away like this? ?


? Open that shutter or I will think that
Britishers can?t do anything risky unless they are
dared to do it.?
? If it comes to that,? retorted Robertson, ? I?ll
soon prove to you that Britishers have a contempt
for personal danger. I?ll open this hole and drop
every Cosmopolite I can sight my shooter upon,
and after that I?ll wreck the engines of the ship.
Then I?ll go out among the men and fight them
single-handed until I am killed. I, at least, am
not a coward.? He again pulled out the rivet,
but this time he gave it a vicious tug, and, regard-
less of noise, flung it back with a loud rattle
against the walls of the tube. ? Look now,? he
said ; ? we can?t both see at the same time, and
there is no danger of their seeing the hole just at
once.?
? Say, partner, I?ll take back all I said,? began
the lady contritely. ?You are as full of grit as
ever any man was. I knew it all along, too, but
I did want to see you riled, you were so cool and
calculating about your movements, and no one was
ever that way wherever I was before.?
?You are giving every one in the cabin the
benefit of your conversation,? said Robertson
coldly. ? Perhaps you had better allow me to
shoot some more. They must have discovered the
hole by this time.?
? I guess they have done no such thing,? re-
torted Miss Collins, looking through. ? The cabin
is empty, there ain?t even a ghost in it.? She
yielded her position to Robertson, and he, to his
surprise, saw that she had spoken truly. The place
was empty, and only some blood where the bound
man had lain gave any sign that it had recently
been occupied.


? I think' I saw a revolver just inside that curtain
which hides this tube,? commented his companion,
when Robertson had expressed his surprise, and
further investigation showed that she was right.
? What does it all mean? ? said Robertson, be-
wildered. ?And whose weapon is that? They?ll
all have gone to my cabin to see how I got into
the tube.?
? I guess not. They?ve taken it for granted that
the fellow who was lying here somehow got his
hand free and shot the other man. He evidently
meant to do that anyway. But let us move on to
the next cabin. We?ll likely hear all about it there,
if it is Hassenrahn?s.??
? As you wish,? responded Robertson, replacing
the rivet and pressing it home tightly. ?It is
daylight now, but as we?ve gone so far we may
as well see the thing through.? He moved back-
wards to the sight-hole which opened into Hassen-
rahn?s cabin, and Miss Collins followed. Just as
Robertson looked in, the door opened and Hassen-
rahn entered, his face white and drawn as if with
intense pain. At his heels were a crowd of partly
dressed men, who had rushed from their sleeping
apartments at the sound of the revolver shot.
? Vat vas happen? ? asked a German. ?De
shot vas come from here.?- He looked at his chief
as he spoke, as did all the others. It was quite
clear that they expected to find that Hassenrahn
had been at his night work again.
? You are wrong this time at any rate,? said
Hassenrahn, with a grim smile, ? I know what
you are thinking. It all happened in the next
cabin. I caught the prisoner Perry sending off a
radiograph. He had evidently surprised Rontgen,


for he was gagged in a corner. I waited to hear
what message he was sending, but just as he
reached the last word Rontgen shot me. He
stumbled into a chair as he spoke, and the men
noticed for the first time that his lower garments
were drenched with blood, a pool of which was
rapidly forming on the floor. Robertson now gave
his companion a chance to witness the proceedings.
? Vere ees Rontgen? ? asked some one, after a
period of silence.
? Here,? came an answer ; ?we him found in
passage-way to ze engines. He say the chief shot
him with no noise pistol from behind, and him
up tie.?
?How can the man lie like that? ? spoke Has-
senrahn faintly. ?He shot me ; I never touched
him ?
? I haf not one pistol had in my hands all my
life,? cried Rontgen. ? I vas vorking at my radio-
transmitter ven some one come in, and next I
know ees somedink strike me, and down I lie.
I am then tied, and my mouth shut, I no see any-
body, but I know it Hassenrahn. Afterwards, I
hear one shot, an? he pick me up, carry me to where
he drop me, but first he take off the ties which
are on my hand. Then the boys they come an
find me ?
? Fellow, you lie ! ? roared Hassenrahn. ? How
could I pick you up and carry you when I am shot
through the right leg and can?t carry myself? You
shot me ! ?
? Vhich is not true. I never shoot in my life.?
?It is very funny,? commented a Japanese,
and we had better see into the matter. The last
two nights our fellows have been getting a bad

time from some one, and they all say our chief.
Now it seems Rontgen has got even with him, or
at least given him lead for club. Here is a re-
volver I picked up just now in the next cabin, and
one chamber is empty, and the barrel looks as if
it had just been fired ?
? Will none of you search the ship for Perry? ?
exclaimed Hassenrahn irritably. ?He is not a
liar, whatever else he may be, and doubtless will
be able to throw some light on this business.?
? De Americanos ees sleepa in de locka up,?
spoke a man of swarthy countenance, just entering.
? I haf just come up from dere. All de locks are
righta, an? no door has opened been. He has been
asleepa all de time.?
? I can see there is some conspiracy on foot
among you fellows against me,? growled Hassen-
rahn. ? I saw Perry myself, and he sent a
message which, if picked up by a faster sailing
craft than we have, will soon make every mother?s
son of you rather sad Cosmopolites. Go away and
leave me. Send the best doctor among you here.
I?ll go and see Perry myself.?


CHAPTER XII
VALLI?S NEW DISCOVERY
Robertson sat in his cabin thinking. He had
left Miss Collins in her own room, and was now
awaiting Wun Lung?s arrival with his breakfast.
He was greatly puzzled to account for the pro-
ceedings Miss Collins and he had just witnessed.
He knew he had fired a shot which, unless some-
thing of the nature of a miracle had happened, must
have struck the man. But this man had proved
to be Hassenrahn, and there was clear evidence
that he had been shot by the Austrian, for, of
course, no one could believe that the wounded
man had actually carried the other man away and
freed one hand solely to throw suspicion on him.
If he had been able to do this he would surely
have followed Perry instead. But Perry was safe
within the prison?a cabin built of iron just above
the propeller, from which it was impossible to
escape, unless, perhaps, by wrenching free the iron
grating outside the porthole and plunging into
the sea. And the American had not done this.
He had been found just as he had been left, with
all the locks and bars intact, and the bare iron
walls of the cell as secure as they had ever been.
But he had seen Perry himself. Yet he had also


been a witness of several of Hassenrahn?s ex-
ploits, and in all these the German had point blank
denied having been in any way concerned. His
musings were cut short by Wun Lung?s arrival
at the door of his cabin.
Wa fo you keepy dool locky? ? the Chinaman
cried. It bad fol ail, an? no one wanty hult
you.?
But it prevents inquisitive people from watch-
ing me, Wun Lung,? answered Robertson, open-
ing the door. ??How long have you been standing
there? ?
?Me only just come. Me listen to heal if you
upy ol still sleep. Me no watch you, an? no cale
wha you do ? He was working up his indig-
nation, but as Robertson knew that to allow him
to do so would assuredly mean a gradual curtail-
ment of his meals, he proceeded to mollify the
Celestial.
? I didn?t mean you, Wun Lung,? he said ; ??l
look upon you as my friend. I thought I might
have been sleeping and had not heard you ; that
is why I asked how long you had been waiting.?
Tha ally light den. You taky good blekfast
an no be ?flaid to-day. Hassenlahn shot by
Amelican ghost last night an? no able getv out
of bed.?
??Who did you say shot Hassenrahn? ? asked
Robertson.
? Oh, me think ?Melican?s ghost, but othel
fellows no? know. They gety muchy ?flaid now.?
When Wun Lung went away Robertson saw
that there was still sufficient accelerating fluid to
keep the ship running another day, even if full
speed were suddenly put on, and then, desirous of


being fresh and able for whatever adventures lay
in store, lay down in his clothes to snatch some
sleep. But he was young and healthy and slept a
long time, being only awakened by a strange sound
which he could not understand, which seemed to
come from the region of the disused gas-mixing
chamber. He listened intently, trying to arrive
at the cause of the sound, but could get no solu-
tion. Suddenly a thought flashed across his brain
and he sprang up. ?That is the Morse tele-
graphic code some one is hammering out,? he
exclaimed, noting that the sounds stopped at in-
tervals and then went on again. There were two
distinct varieties of taps, a light one and a heavy
one. He waited until the interval came and then
prepared to spell out the sounds, for he had long
ago acquired a knowledge of the Morse alphabet.
The light sounds he knew meant the dots, and
the heavy ones the dashes. Suddenly the taps
began again, and this is what came :? . . (R)
- . . . (B) .(E) . - . (R) - (T)
. . . (S) (O) (N).?
? Why, that is some one calling on me, and the
whole ship will hear it,? he cried. ? Who can it
be? ? He seized a wrench and tapped back on the
outside of the mixing chamber : ? . (W)
. . . . (H) (O) - . - . (C) . - (A)
. . . (L) . . . (L) . . . (S)? ? and to his
astonishment came back the message : ? Valeria.
Fallen down tube. Can?t get back.?
Before the message was completed Robertson
was unscrewing the manhole door of the mixing
chamber. When he got it off he looked through
the aperture and saw Miss Collins smiling at him.
? What on earth do you mean? ? he cried.


? The whole ship will have got your message and
all our work is lost ?
? Well, I guess you are the most provoking
young man I know,? said Valeria. ? You don?t
seem half glad to see me after all the trouble I
have taken to call on you.?
? But every one whose cabin the tube passes
through would hear your signals ?
? But they didn?t. Every man on the ship
except my father and you is assembled in the
saloon. They are going to search the ship to
see if any explanation of some mysteries can be
found. I heard the order given while spying on
the gentleman who calls himself Hassenrahn, and
thinking it would be a fine opportunity for us to
bore some more holes into the other cabins I came
to tell you and fell down into this funny place.
Is this where you stay? Why, it looks more like
a laboratory than a cabin.?
?It is a laboratory, Miss Collins. I make all
the accelerating power which gives the ship its
speed here. It is also my prison, for I dare not
go outside.?
?But you can engineer a way out if you like,
Mr. Robertson, and I do want to have a walk on
deck to-night. Please invent some means of
taking me there without any one knowing.?
Before Robertson could make any reply a loud
knock sounded on the door, and a voice cried :
?Are you there, mon ami? Open your door that
I may see ?
? Quick ! ? whispered Robertson, ? I?ll screw
you up again. Don?t make a sound.? He had
the manhole door in its place in a few seconds,
then, in answer to further cries from without, he


yawned aloud and asked sleepily : ? Who is
there? ?
? Nevaire mind. Open ze door or I vill break
it.?
? What do you want? Can I not get a sleep
in peace? I?ve been working all night, and I
don?t want to be disturbed by you people ?
A howl of dismay broke in upon his words, and
he continued : ? You ought to know by this time
that you cannot enter this room without my
permission.?
? Take off ze electreecity or I vill kill you,?
roared the man outside, dancing on the contacts
helplessly.
Robertson switched off the current and threw
open the door. ? Well, what is it? ?he inquired.
?Is the ship sinking? Or have you come to pay
me a friendly call? ?
The Frenchman sat down on the edge of the
berth to recover. ? You are clevaire, Mistaire
Robarson,? he said with a shrug ; ? you make
me tie up in a heap. Old Mac the same trick
too play often.?
? I didn?t want to do it,? said the youth, ? but
you didn?t give me time to disconnect the wires.
I have been sleeping all morning and you took
me by surprise.?
?Ma foi I You gave me one bigger surprise.
I am come to see if no one is in this cabin but
you.?
? Well, you can see for yourself. Why should
there be any one here? ?
? Some one is hiding somewhere, and we are
having ze call-roll in ze salon just now. We
are all there, so Hassenrahn he say to me : *Go


and see who is in ze prison and in young Robar-
son?s room? ? I go ; Perry, my camarade, ees
in ze cachot and you are here alone. It is veil.
There ees no one on ze ship unless ?he looked
round the room ?unless he is in ze gas-meter.?
? Perhaps you had better satisfy yourself on
that point,? said Robertson, seizing his wrench
and going up to the active chamber.
?Ma foi ! no. If any one in there he can
stay. Mordienne ! I ver 1 near dead last week
when clean out gas tank next door. Au revoir,
mon ami ?
? Are you going already? Can?t you sit down
and talk for a little? ?
? Ah no, dere is one meeting in ze salon I must
attend. I go ; keep your door locked.?
Next minute Robertson was again alone, and,
hastily turning the current on to the door so as
to ensure against surprise, he once more took off
the manhole. He was just in time, for Miss
Collins had almost fainted, there being no circu-
lation of air at the bottom of the long tube when
the door was in its place. She soon revived,
however, and after partaking of a glass of water
which Robertson handed to her, she announced
that she was ready for a hole-boring expedition.
? Then you must come out into my cabin to
allow me to get inside first. I shall then climb up
to the horizontally-running tube and pull you up
after me with this rope. You must also see that
the door is as nearly closed as possible, so that it
has a chance of not being noticed should any one
find another place from which they can examine
this cabin.?
It was a simple matter for Robertson to pull


the girl up to the elbow ; he was as strong as
any fully-developed man. ? What about your
friend? ? he asked, as they crawled along.
? Won?t she miss you? ?
? Oh, no, she is writing up her diary just now,
and she will take till bedtime to put her present
experiences on record. I wonder how long she
would require had she to write mine?
? And what about your father? Can we tell
him? ?
? I guess not. He would stop my fun straight
away. But he?s all right. He?s got some Cape
Town papers, and he?ll do nothing for the next
few days but smoke cigars and work out what
money he has made or lost through the fluctua-
tions in copper. But, I say, suppose we bore a
hole into every cabin right along? We?ll never
have a better chance, and I do want to write a
book afterwards called ? What the Spy-Hole Dis-
closed ; or, A Girl?s Experiences in a Twopenny
?no, I mean Gas ?Tube.? ?
? It strikes me that those experiences will be
cut short if you begin wandering about yourself,?
said Robertson, erecting his brace after some
calculation as to his position.
? Oh, I won?t do any more of that ; you can
fit up a telephone between us and I?ll call you
when I want to go exploring.?
??You seem to have unbounded faith in my
ability to do anything, Miss Collins.?
? Rather ! You see, I cannot help connecting
you with Mr. Macpherson, and he was a wizard.?
? I hope to meet that gentleman some day. I
have heard a lot about him. He must be a person
just as my own father was.?
? You say was. Is he dead? ?


YALLIS NEW DISCOVERY 265
? I don?t know. He was a great inventor, but
he disappeared suddenly, and I never heard from
him again.?
?Then I guess Mr. Macpherson is your father.
You are as like him as could be.?
? But my name is Robertson ?
? That?s a pity. You didn?t change your name,
I suppose? ?
? Certainly not. Why should I? ?
? I don?t know, but in that case he must have
changed his. But that hole is just going through
now ; the drill is sticking.?
Robertson drew the drill out and carefully
finished the hole with a round file. ?There is
no one in this cabin,? he said, blowing away the
filings that had fallen outside with his mouth.
? I wish we could get a chart showing who owned
the various cabins.?
? I?ll find out from Wun Lung. He is in love
with me already,? laughed Miss Collins. ? Mean-
while let us plug that hole and pass on to the
next.?
And so they proceeded until a hole had been
bored into the line of cabins through which the
tube passed. In all cases the cabins were empty,
but most of them showed signs of having only
recently been vacated.
? I think we have now attended to all the lead-
ing lights of the Cosmopolites,? remarked Robert-
son, as they came to the elbow leading to the
engine-room. ? But I would like to see them at
work, if I could only figure out the position of
their workshop underneath.?
? I know ; in my cabin I can hear the whirr of
machinery underneath, but forward a little, nearly


under Hassenrahn?s cabin, I should think,? said
Miss Collins.
? You are right, I remember now, it is on the
deck below us, but inside the row of cabins. Pro-
bably Hassenrahn has a spy-hole from his own
room to it.? Robertson carefully measured off
the tube with his length of flexible lamp wires,
and started boring another hole vertically into
the tube, all the other holes having pierced it on
the right-hand side at right angles. When the
drill point broke through Robertson removed it,
and while he quietly and skilfully finished it with
a file, so as not to attract attention should any
one be in the apartment they were boring into,
Miss Collins erected the brace and bored another
hole close beside the first one.
When Robertson looked to see what sort of
place they had now brought under their notice he
found that he was gazing into the workshop where
the Dutchman and he had had their dispute, as he
had calculated on doing, and this knowledge
proved to him that the tube was built in between
the two decks, the actual division being some-
where about the lower part of the tube. There
were no people in the place when he first examined
it, hut the second hole was barely completed when
about a score of men entered, laughing and talking
together, and Miss Collins and he took up their
positions to learn what they could.
? So dere is no mystery after all, boys,? spoke
a burly German to the others as he started an
electric motor which operated some machinery.
? Ve vill not be troubled more vith night prowlers
until Hassenrahn is bedder. Rontgen vas von too
many for him.?


? But Rongen says he no? do it,? put in a man
who looked like a Spaniard, also setting some
peculiar-looking machine in motion. <
? Ha, ha I But that is because he is afraid,? 1
laughed the Frenchman who had visited Robert-
son?s cabin. ? Our Chief must be off his head
going too ; his story of Perry being at ze instru-
ment vas vat you call too thin.?
? Ah, well, boys,? added a Russian, we need
Hassenrahn or we would send him after the old
Chief. No one but he and Marquis Ikato knows
the passage into our hiding-place, and the Marquis
would take us alongside the biggest cruiser he
could find if he had a free hand.?
? What is to happen after this trip, does any one
know? ? asked a Japanese. ? Surely we are not
going to hide now that we are the fastest thing
floating? ?
? We are to land our prisoners,? answered the
German who had first spoken, ? unt den sail away
for Mexico. After we change our silver dollars
dere, ve vill sail for some port in de United States,
unt den cross over to Liverpool unt change all
our British money. Coming home ve vill come
up behind von Atlantic racer, the Mauretania
maybe, unt put a hole in her shust above her
screws. Our own boys vill be on poard unt make
dings lively, unt shust ven dey dink dey are
sinking de Lancelot vill come up unt save de pas-
sengers. After dat ve vill come along unt tow de
big poat into our own port, unt fit her up with
our gas engines unt den be able to sail round de
world at forty miles an hour.?
? All vair good, Chermany, but vat about de boy
on board just now? He may not tell to us of his


patent, and vat can we do it not have? ? The
last speaker was the Frenchman, and as he spoke
a shower of silver coins began to fall from a
machine he was working.
? Ach ! de poy vill pe made into gas in de
furnace. Ve vill have de secret soon now from
his gompanions, unt ve vill not den vant him. He
knows too much for his health.?
Robertson, as he heard this, felt very much in-
clined to try a shot at the German, but he decided
that he couM do that later, and so refrained.
** That?s a bit rough on you,? whispered Miss
Collins. ?I am sure they can?t get much gas by
burning you.?
? But ve have more people on de ship now.
Vat about dem? Will dey pay der ransom? ?
spoke some one, drawing a lever and causing
another shower of silver coins to fall.
? Ach, yes, old Money-bags vill pay,? grunted
the German ; ? but ve cannot let dem go free undil
ve have made dings so dat dey dare not tell. Ve
must keep von eye on Hassenrahn, too, for I dink
he means to clear out vith von of de girls veri
he gets de chance, unt we can?t allow dat.?
? It seems that your prospects are not much
better than mine,? Robertson whispered to his
companion as the German concluded. ?We are
both in the same boat in a double sense.?
? Oh> I depend on you to save me,? was the
rejoinder. ? But do you know, I quite forgot to
tell you that I know the leader of this gang, but
his name was not Hassenrahn when I knew him.
He was a great friend of the Emperor?s ?
They 11 hear you. You can tell me the story
some other time,? interrupted Robertson. Several


machines were now shedding silver coins of all
sizes, and he was greatly interested in watching
the clever action of the machines which formed
them. At length his interest in the men?s work
became greater than in their conversation, and,
turning to Miss Collins, he said : Would you,
please, listen to what they say very carefully?
I want to see how they manage to turn these plates
of silver into coins as they are doing.?
? I have been wondering about that myself,?
she answered. ?? They seem to be making money
very easily down there. I expect they take an
electro-impression of a real coin and from it make
a die which stamps out the rest.?
But Robertson was now watching all the move-
ments below, and he heard nothing further of the
conversation. He soon learned that in the main
Miss Collins?s idea was correct. He could see
plating vats in working order, and in each of
them were suspended coins slowly being coated
with some dark-looking substance which he did
not recognise. At a bench some men were pre-
paring the casts made previously by backing them
with some strange metallic compound, and at an
electric furnace two men were melting silver ingots
into bars, which, when passed through rollers,
came out the exact thickness of the coins desired.
The backing built upon the cast must have been
extremely hard, for when cold it required no
further preparation than to be placed in one of
the stamping machines. A slab of silver was
then fed in at one end and a shower of coins fell
through a slot in the other end. Periodically
the dies were/removed and thrown through a port-
hole, and those just finished by the men at the


bench substituted ; and so work went on until a
great number of heaps of coins lay around each
stamping machine. Robertson had followed the
process from the very beginning, and now was
only puzzled to know of what metal the im-
pressions of the coins taken in the vats consisted,
and the nature of the material with which the
impressions were afterwards backed, for the fact
that this was so hard as to be able to cut out so
many coins without being blunted itself was beyond
him. As if in answer to his unspoken thoughts,
one man at the furnace suddenly turned to the
others and said : ?We will some more osmium
and iridium need soon, our stock is running down
quickly.?
? Better use more iridium and less of de oder,?
suggested one of the others. ?It vill be shust
as hard as amalgam, and ve only make one huntret
stamp of each coin anyway. It is not vise to have
more of de same date.?
? But is de osmiridium so scarce dat de Cosmo-
polites gan not get more? ? inquired the first
speaker, ? I thought it vas very common.?
? Den you vas make von big mistake,? replied
the other. ?It all come from Nord Queensland
and New Guinea, and we cannot get any more
osmium ontil de prospectors bring back vat dey
have found in de ranges beyond de Owen Stanleys.
Ve vill likely steal some before den, all de same.?
So it is a compound of osmium and iridium
that they use,? commented Robertson to himself.
? 1 have heard that that compound is found in
New Guinea, but I never dreamt that its chief
value lay in its hardness.?
? Now it is you who are foolish,? admonished


Miss Collins. ? Can?t you see that something has
happened to alarm those men? We had better
get back to our cabins at once ; they may hear
us speaking, or suspect that we are here.?
What she said was true ; the men had suddenly
become alarmed. All work was stopped, and
canvas coverings were hastily thrown over the
heaps of coins. Then, without any apparent
reason, the workers all left the apartment, leaving
everything behind them.
? I would like to get a handful of those coins,?
remarked Robertson, when the place was empty.
? But as you cannot go through a drill-hole that
is impossible,? said Miss Collins. ? I am more
anxious to know the meaning of this sudden
running away.?
? I suppose a cruiser has appeared and all hands
are on deck disguising the ship. Have you a
piece of string? I could widen this hole and lower
a waxed rivet down among those coins ?
? Gracious I are you still thinking of that?
But look ! There is a funny little man coming
through that doorway from the engine-room.
What does he want, I wonder? ?
? Why, that is Valli, the Greek, one of the
cleverest men on board. He can hypnotise people
with a look, and all the Cosmopolites are afraid of
him. No one has ever been inside his cabin, and
it is on condition that he is left entirely to his own
devices that he throws in his lot with the others
on this ship. He is a mystery to every one ?
excepting, perhaps, Hassenrahn.?
?He looks a most uncanny sort of being. I
shouldn?t like to have any dealings with him. But
what is he doing? He seems to be scattering a
kind of powder over some of those machines.?


? Hallo ! Here?s Hassenrahn. He?s coming
in as quietly as if he had rubber shoes ?and, by
Jupiter ! he has. Now you?ll see fun. Every
time Hassenrahn appears there?s some one nearly
killed. He is a marvel. Every one thought he
was laid up for some days ?
? There does not appear to be anything wrong
with him,? said Miss Collins. ?For a man shot
through a limb as he was he walks very steadily.?
At that moment Valli turned and saw Hassen-
rahn. Surprise showed itself all over him, but,
quickly composing himself, he smiled sweetly and
said :
? I haf just arranged dat you shall no more be
troubled by some of de men. Dey vill have noting
to remember or forget vith, Dair memory vill
depart so soon as dey come back to vork.?
Hassenrahn?s face underwent a peculiar change.
When he had entered at first there was a look
in his eyes which suggested that a bad time was
in store for the little Greek, but as the latter was
speaking this expression changed to one of deeper
interest, as if its wearer had just been struck by
an idea that, if carried out, would yield more than
he had at first hoped to gain. He laughed, ? I
am pretty hard to kill,? he said, ? but I am glad
you have been attending to my instructions. Some
of the men were becoming a bit unruly, but we can
dispense with their services now, if your treat-
ment works as well as it did once before.?
? Valli never fails,? replied the Greek proudly ;
? and ve not any trouble have had vith de old
Chief if oders had their vork done so veil.?
??You did your part very well in any case, Valli,
but is there no danger of them ever regaining their


full powers? I shouldn?t like to stand in your
sho ; if there were any chance of that.?
Poof 1 Valli can fight vith tools they of the
use do not know,? returned the little man. ? I
haf another discovery made vhich vill yet make
the whole vorld ring vith the name of Valli.?
?You are certainly a great man, Valli, but I
must go now ; I don?t want the men to find me
here. My name is not very popular with them
just now.?
?Nor must I be here ven dey come back. Dey
no? like Valli movin? among dem, ha, ha ! Dey
think he carry a bit of de devil in his pocket. Ha,
ha ! But vhat ship is that ve are disguised for? ?
? A German torpedo-boat destroyer, I think.
There are some in Walfish Bay just now, and I
expect that is one out here, where she can be safe
from the view of the liners, going through some
secret trials.?
? Ah, yes. De Germans have secretly fitted in
de new radio-engines into some of dere boats,
but dey cannot sail fast as our ship. We are de
kings of de vater. But say, my Chief, you tell
us de Lancelot vill come up to-night vith mails
and oder dings from Cape Town. Now, ven
you get de oder dings an? know how to make de
secret power yourself, don?t tell any man on board
dis ship, an? ve togeder vill haf all de know-
ledge an can do vat ve like always after.?
I don?t intend to spread any knowledge I may
get broadcast, Valli. We shall run the business
of the Cosmopolites between us.?
? Good ! den you come along my cabin to-night
an? see vat new discovary I haf made. No man
know, an? you nevar tell.?


? All right, Valli, but where do you stay? I
don?t think I know.?
??Vat? Don?t you remember my cabin, an? vat
ve did dere last veek? ?
? I must have accidentally breathed in some of
your memory-destroying powder, Valli, laughed
the German, ?for I honestly tell you I don?t know
your cabin from Signor Antonio?s. Both of you
are mysterious scientists, you know, and neither
of you encourage visitors to your rooms.
Valli glanced sharply at his companion, but the
other met his gaze coolly, and they passed out of
the place talking.
? Our programme is going to be well filled to-
night, partner,? Miss Collins remarked. That
man Valli has murder in his eyes. He wants to
get the German into his room for other purposes
than merely to show him the result of his new
discovery.?
? I think we may safely let them fight it out,
answered Robertson. ? I wouldn?t mind betting
my next meal ?and, by Jove ! it?s time for it now
?that Hassenrahn has something marked down
for the Greek. Did you see how his face
changed? ?
? But what did they mean when they talked of
memory-destroying powder and all that, and what
was Valli?s object in going round powdering those
machines? ?
?He has discovered a wonderful substance,
which, according to what I have heard, has the
property of making people forget everything that
is past if they breathe it. He means our friends
the counterfeiters, or at least some of them, to
suffer from loss of memory to-night, for you heard
what he said to Hassenrahn? ?


? But that cannot be anything else than
nonsense,? said the lady. ? How could a powder
take away one?s memory? ?
? I don?t know, but the Marquis Ikato told me
some very strange stories about Valli?s work, and
every one on the ship believes them. But we had
better get Back to our cabins. Perhaps we?ve
been missed already, for it?s after six o?clock.?
? But you will come for me to take me on deck
to-night, won?t you? I shall make some excuse
to Miss Vanderbilt and come into the big cabin
about nine o?clock. Dear me !it is difficult moving
backwards. Why did they not make this tube
larger when they were at it? ?
? They didn?t consider us at all when they were
making it,? laughed Robertson. ? But you haven?t
far to go, and I will call for you at nine o?clock.?
A few yards more and Miss Collins had gained
the entrance to her own cabin, and then Robertson
moved swiftly to his. He heard Wun Lung at
his door before he had got clear of the mixing
chamber ; but, feigning to have just awoke, he
kept the Chinaman outside until he had put every-
thing in order, and then admitted him.
?You sleepy lot, young man,? Wun Lung said
affably, as he deposited his tray. ? Too much
sleepy no good. You grow muchy fat.?
? Well, what else can I do, Wun Lung? I am
not allowed to go outside this cabin, and I have
nothing to read.?
? Lite books. Tell how Wun Lung once big
merchant in Shanghai. Byambye vely fine steamel
comey into polt and Wun Lung likey it vely muchy.
He gety lot men leady, and one night when it lie fal
out in watel they swalm all ovel it dlessed as


Chinkie pilates flom islands. We captul the shipy
?and I lemembel no mole fo? long time, and when
I waky up I am Wun Lung the cooky.? The
Celestial paused for a full minute, then suddenly
fixing his almond eyes on Robertson, he asked :
? You lemembel all ?bout youeself? ?
? Yes, certainly. Why should I not? But is
that a true story you have told me?
? It am vely tlue, only I no? telly that I no?
lemembel it fo? long time. It am only soon back
that I know I no? common cooky on boald shipy,
but gleat melchant of Shanghai.?
? Dear me, Wun Lung. Your story is most
interesting. How did you rediscover that fact? ?
? I telly you. I vely ?quisitive, an? one day
when I looky through keyhole into little Gleek
fellow?s loom to see what he do with lot o? led
and white bellies he keep stacked up above his
head, I heal him talky talky to himself an? I
listen.?
? Yes, go on, please.? Robertson was all eager-
ness now. He knew the cabin where racks of red
and white berries were.stored. They were dried
rowans and mountain ash berries, and he wondered
if he were really on the trail of Valli?s secret, for
he remembered having read somewhere that the
spirit distilled from those fruits had the power of
destroying the memory.
? I heal him say,? went on Wun Lung, imitating
Valli?s speech to the best of his ability, ? Ha ! zoon
now I vill be Chief of the Cosmopolites. Zis
powdel, which I alone know how to make flom
dese bellies, will giv? me dat powel and whoevel
bleathes it will folget, folget.? But I no? folget,
I lemembel all at once. He was maky powdel flom


bellies when I looky thlough, an? I bleathe hald
and evelyting come back to me. That how I
know I am not ship cooky but gleat melchant in
Shanghai, and Valli only big fool.?
? That is most remarkable, Wun Lung, and I
believe you. But what did you do then? ?
? Noting. I lay low an? no? savy anyting alley
time. But I keepy eals and eyes open when mouf?
shut, an? I soon findy outy most tings an? dat I
am cooky on the ship I tried to captule. But I
must lun now ?I no? tell you all dis afole until I
savvy you plopel, and now I know evelyting is
light.?
? I certainly won?t give you away, Wun Lung,?
said Robertson ; ? but how do you know, or rather,
how did you find out, that you could safely trust
me with your story? I might go straight to Has-
senrahn with it.?
? And I sweal you bloomin? lial, and tell him
about gas tube dool bein? open often when I come
along dinnel to you and you alley same say sleepy.
Oh, Wun Lung, keep mouf shut, but he savy to
keep eals and eyes open.?
Robertson could scarcely suppress his astonish-
ment when Wun Lung practically told him he
knew the secret of the tube ; but, covering his
feelings with a non-committal laugh, he said :
? Ah, well, Wun Lung, we are friends in misfor-
tune, whatever the reasons are. I am sorry your
pirates did not succeed in beating the present
owners of this ship ; but, of course, you tackled
the toughest crowd of people, probably, in the
world, and piracy is their profession. But just
one word before you go. Do you know anything
about that affair between Perry and Hassenrahn
last night? ?


? It was Felly?s ghost, fol he is in locky up
ally time. I tell you stlaight.?
? I don?t believe in ghosts.?
? Oh, but I do ; I?ve seen them often. You
only kid yet, no? seen anyting. Plenty time
byambye.?
? I suppose so. What sort of ship is that far
over on the starboard? ?
?Dunno. Hassenrahn an odels vely muchy
flightened alle same. Shipy look like tolpedy-
boat, and all hands changin? dis shipy into odel
shipy so she no? know us. Byambye Wun Lung
expects big tings happen, an? den you?ll lemembel
me? ?
? Surely, my friend, and you?ll be a great
merchant in Shanghai again before very long, if
I can carry through my programme.?
They shook hands, and Wun Lung gathered up
his dishes and departed, leaving Robertson ponder-
ing deeply over one or two things which had just
occurred to him. As a result of his thoughts, he
opened the gas-mixing chamber again and crawled
silently along the tube to the spy-hole through
which he remembered having seen the racks of red
and white berries. He had to pass Miss Collins?s
cabin on the way, and, pausing there for a moment
to see if she were alone, he overheard Mr. Collins?s
voice in conversation with her and Miss Vanderbilt.
He did not wish to listen to what he was saying,
but the old gentleman was one of those people who,
having nothing of which they are ashamed to con-
ceal, do not object to air their views for the benefit
of every one, and this was what Robertson heard :
? Yes, Valeria, I was with Hassenrahn all day,
and he?s not half a bad fellow, and his cigars are


excellent. The poor beggar couldn?t smoke them
himself, though ; that bullet made a nasty hole in
him, and he has been tossing in his bunk all day,
suffering a good bit ?
? Not all day, father,? broke in Valeria. ?He
was ? She stopped in time, and rounded off
her sentence with ? hardly as bad as that,
was he? ?
? Yes, all day,? reiterated the old man, ? Every
second of it, too, for I guess I?m not the man to
make myself believe that fact if I hadn?t got my
two eyes on him all the time.?
Robertson passed on. He saw more complica-
tions in store, but he knew that Miss Collins would
get at the root of the matter as far as her father
was concerned, and his present business was with
Valli. Still, the thought rose uppermost in his
mind : if it were true what Mr. Collins said, who
had they seen talking to Valli and who had Valli
invited to his cabin that night if not Hassenrahn?
But he had now reached the hole which com-
manded the cabin which contained the store of
dried fruits, and, removing the plugging rivet, he
gazed inside. Valli was there, evidently having
just finished his dinner, for, as was the practice
with the heads of the Cosmopolites, he dined alone
when engaged in following out anything which
might lead to a new discovery.
? To-night, den, I vill be de great chief of
this ship and all on board,? he chuckled audibly.
?At last I haf discovared de grand secret vich
vill make all men my servants. Vat are men
to Valli? Who are dey dat should stand in his
vay? Behold how simpal it all is, and how science
conquers brute force. Here in dis leetle b'ottel I


have vat kings and emperors vould gif half dere
country to get. But dey cannot. Only I, Valli
the Greek, command its power, Valli the vaiter,
Valli the sailorman, Valli the ship tobacco seller of
Port Said, Valli the scientist ! In dis leetle bottel ?
(he held up to the light a two-ounce phial con-
taining some colourless liquid) ? lies insanity for
all mine enemies, and efery man who stands in
Valli?s vay ees his enemy. From dis bottel ven
de ether on top volatilises vill arise in one straight
line a gas vich, if but a trace of it is breathed, vill
make the man who breathes it go mad. Noding
can stop its rising ; corks nor glass stops are no
good, roofs are no good, iron bands are useless.
Through everyding it vill rise, but only straight.
Vair veil, he comes here to-night and vill sit in
dat sofa dere. Good, he vill be here at midnight,
and at midnight all de ether vill haf evaporated,
I vill place dis bottel under vair he vill sit and
den de Cosmopolites are mine?mine, body and
soul.?
The little man arose and, after another long
admiring gaze at the ? leetle bottel,? withdrew
its glass stopper and moved towards the sofa,
under which, as in all that row of cabins, the gas-
pipe passed. Robertson hastily replaced the plug,
and when he cautiously extracted it again he saw
the bottle standing innocently on the floor about
a foot away from him and on a level with his
spy-hole.
? It strikes me I?ll have to get some more tools
made if I am to play at this game much longer,?
muttered Robertson. ?My file is worn as smooth
as a burnisher, so how am I to get that bottle
through a half-inch hole? No, it means another


journey to the engine-room on the chance of being
able to steal a large round file or something else,
so here goes.? He at once started along the tube,
and dropping down the vertical part, soon found
himself looking out through the spindleless valve
into the engine-room. But he had no time just
now to spy upon the engineers in charge, so, select-
ing an inch tapered round file, which he found in
the usual place, he made his way back to Valli?s
cabin. Here he pushed the small end of the file
through the existing hole, and by means of a screw
wrench applied to its ? tang ? revolved it slowly,
feeding the larger part gently into the hole at the
same time. He used oil lavishly to prevent noise
as much as possible, for Valli still sat at a table
under the porthole lost in dreams of boundless
power. At last he passed the inch file clean
through, and, as the bottle was slightly less than
an inch in diameter, hopes of success now encour-
aged him. Snipping off a piece of his lamp wire,
and thus depriving himself of light, he formed
a loop on one end of the piece, and passing it
through the enlarged hole, tried to lasso the neck
of the bottle. After several attempts he succeeded
in doing this, and next moment he had drawn it
close to the edge of the hole. But to get the bottle
turned lengthways sufficiently to allow its neck to
enter the hole, and yet not enough to allow its
dangerous contents to spill, was quite another feat
of patient engineering. At length he managed
to pull the neck into the hole, and, pushing a
lead pencil into the bottle, he soon steered it
through.
? I think I can control this wonderful gas as
well as you, friend Valli,? the youth then re-


marked. ? I?ll put another stopper in the bottle
and seal it tightly, and then put it in an air-tight
case. It cannot very well volatilise if it has
nothing to volatilise with.?
A minute later he was in his own cabin again.


CHAPTER XIII
THE CAPTURE OF THE LANCELOT
Meanwhile circumstances were rapidly develop-
ing elsewhere which would certainly have caused
the Cosmopolites some surprise, to say the least,
had they but known of them.
When the Chief went ashore at Cape Town he
took with him only Harry Southwood, for the fact
that Signor Antonio had considered it advisable
to effect his escape in Table Bay was an indica-
tion that he expected to find friends near, and of
course his friends could only be the Chief?s
enemies. But Harry and he could do their busi-
ness without attracting any attention, and if they
should be seen by any people who had any special
interest in them, that fact would not hurt them
very much, as they personally were already known
to the heads of the gang, and their mere presence
in the streets would give no clue to the ship whence
they came, nor the strength of their following, all
of which were as yet unknown to the Cosmopolites,
or supposed to be. The Chief, however, granted
leave of absence on shore to several of the men
who asked for it, giving them instructions at the
same time that they were not to parade together,
nor to recognise him should they pass in the street.


Thus it was that Harry first saw Cape Town,
and he was greatly struck by the sight of white,
black, and yellow men mingling together in the
streets as naturally as if there never had been any
barrier between the races of East, West, and South.
But Harry was not one of those kind of travellers
with whom the world now abounds, who think that
they possess the power of grasping everything at
once, and who write original books of travel after
having gone a journey under the auspices of a cele-
brated tourist agency, and he suspected that if he
moved into a dark side street he might see the
proof of Kipling?s?
? East is East, and West is West,
And never the twain shall meet.?
Adderley Street was very fine, and the bril-
liantly lit windows of its shops reminded him of
Buchanan Street in Glasgow. They went into
the station and saw the goldfields mail train depart
with its freight of returning miners, storekeepers,
and others who had been down to the Cape for a
? blow ? or on business. Then they watched the
Rhodesian mail being made up, and Harry?s heart
thrilled as he saw the carriages fill with men whose
fresh faces denoted that they had just landed from
the Old Country and were about to seek their for-
tune in that great rich land beyond the Zambesi
Falls. Harry could not bring himself to imagine
that he was in a strange country for the first time
in his life. Everything excepting the presence of
the black and yellow men seemed so familiar.
Yet it was with a great start of surprise that he
recalled the fact that only recently he had been,


with his two comrades, a working engineer in a
Clyde shipbuilding yard, and that he had been one
of those privileged to cover the ocean between the
shores of Britain and Cape Town in a time hitherto
deemed beyond the bounds of possibility.
They left the station and wandered through the
streets, and after calling on the Chief of Police,
and transacting some business at various places,
the Chief led the way to the Mount Nelson Hotel,
so that they might get something to eat before
returning to the ship. It was while here that
Harry began to fancy that the Chief and he were
watched, and, speaking in a low voice, he said to
his leader : ?Do you know those two swarthy-
faced men standing by that bar over there, sir? 2 ?
?Not just now, Harry, although I may have
known them before my memory failed me.
Why? ?
? Because those two men stumbled against us
in the station, as if by accident, and they have
just been speaking to that other party of foreign-
looking people at that table beyond, and I know
some of them walked through the gardens close
behind us as we came here.?
? So you think we are being followed, Harry? ?
laughed the Chief. ?Well, I hope you are right.
We shall find out all the sooner what we wish to
know, unless those people happen to be ordinary
ruffians who have spotted us as fresh from an
ocean voyage. Hallo ! here?s Jones.?
? And he?s tipsy ! ? excaimed Harry, greatly
astonished.
?No, he isn?t, young man,? spoke the latter,
throwing himself into a chair opposite them. ? I
have some news, and this is the only way I can
give it without blowing the whole show.?


He paused to imitate the attempt of a drunken
man to light a cigar, and when he had at length
succeeded in so doing he spoke hurriedly and in a
low tone as follows : ? I trust, sir, you will give
me credit for acting with the best intentions for
your interests in speaking to you against your
orders, but no one will dream we have any con-
nection if when I have done you speak an angry
word or two to me and call a waiter to get me
kicked out.?
? Great Scott I Jones,? said the Chief, ? you are
not writing a sensational article for the Press just
now. Come to the point at once. What is your
news? ?
? I have seen some of the men of my yellow jack
experience, sir, and they?re following you. It is
my belief that my men and your enemies are the
same people. There is a crowd of them over at
the bar now, and I know they?ve some game on
to-night against you.?
? Have they recognised you? ?
? I don?t know, sir ; but I reeled past a couple
some minutes ago and heard them wondering how
you got here so soon, and asking each other how
it was that Mac wasn?t with you.?
? I see. They have arrived here, then, after all ;
their boat must be hidden somewhere, and our
time for action has also come. Jones, a good
hammering would not inconvenience you a great
deal? ?
? Not much, sir.?
? Well, you can have your own price for draw-
ing one on yourself to-night.?
? I haven?t caught on as yet, sir ; but I?ll take
a hammering for nothing if it?s for you.?


?It is for me. I want you to draw those men
after you, and thus give me a free hand to play a
little game of my own.?
? But they don?t want me, sir ; it?s you they?re
after.?
? And they?ll make a very natural mistake.
Now, listen carefully. I am going to get you
ejected for insulting me ?you understand? I?ll
have to do it as all our friends are watching us
just now. Very well. You will re-enter by the
side entrance, and make your way to the room I
shall book. Harry will tell you the number.
There I will join you as soon as I can find the
tonsorial artist attached to this establishment.?
The Chief?s voice rose now as if in anger. ? Now,
go this moment,? he cried, "or I shall hand you
over to the police.?
Jones rose and staggered, and at that instant
a couple of stalwart attendants answered the
Chief?s signal, and without a word ran the sup-
posed offender outside.
?Now then, Harry, run and book a room for
me, and give Jones the key when he turns up,?
said the Chief. ?I am going through this way to
the hairdresser.?
Harry faithfully carried out his instructions,
and so it happened that about ten minutes later
the trio were safely locked in one of the bedrooms.
? Now, how about that thrashing, sir,? began
Jones. ? I?m anxious to get to work for it.?
?You will get it in less than half an hour from
now, my man,? answered the Chief. ? But stand
still for a moment. Yes, you are about an inch
smaller than I am, but they?ll not notice that in
the dark.?


? But they?ll see I sport a moustache, whereas
the man they?re watching is clean shaven,? said
Jones, ? and you are bigger every way than I am,
and my face is not like yours any more than a
Chinaman?s is like a Cardiff coalheaver?s. Your
mouth is straight, mine is kinked. Your eyebrows
are black, I haven?t any. You look a man who has
been well fed all his life, while any man would bet
that I never had a square meal in my natural.?
? We?ll soon make up all these deficiencies,?
laughed the Chief. ? Strip and put on my clothes,
and Harry will put in packing where you require
it.?
? But my moustache ? ?
?Is coming off. I have the requirements
for a complete metamorphosis here. The barber
supplied me with everything, even to a safety
razor. I have no hot water, though.?
Jones grinned. ? I shall survive shaving with
cold, I have no doubt,? he said. ? I hope, sir,
that you are not going to do anything desperate
yourself? ?
? Oh, nothing I am not well accustomed to ; at
least, I seem to have done the same thing before
successfully. Why, Jones, you are quite a good-
looking fellow with your moustache off. Steady,
now, and I?ll give you a pair of magnificent eye-
brows. There, those look better even than the
real thing. Now, just a line or two here and there
about the face for the sake of artistic effect. These
are good grease paints, Jones, and will wash off
readily.?
The Chief worked swiftly as he spoke, and in
almost no time he had transformed Jones into
his double as far as his face was concerned.


? We needn?t trouble about your hair, Jones,?
he remarked, surveying his finished work ; ? the
hat will hide that.?
A few minutes later a change of clothing had
also been effected, and Harry could hardly bring
himself to believe that the handsome, clean-shaven
man of most distinguished appearance was really
Jones.
? Now for your instructions,? began the Chief
when everything was ready. ?You two will go
carelessly down through the gardens, but see that
you do not allow yourselves to be attacked there.
Of course you will be followed if these people
really have been watching me. Most likely they
will keep on following you in hopes of your leading
them to Mac, for it seems that he and I were
always together of old.?
? But you, sir? ? asked Harry ; ? what do you
intend to do? You said you would do nothing
desperate.? 6
In the first place, Harry,? said the Chief
moving silently to the door, ? I am going to inter-
view the gentleman who has been listening outside
all the time.? He flung the door open and sprung
upon a man who almost fell into the room. He
had been leaning against the door. The Chief
eftly passed some cords round his arms and legs

free, and when he is beyond pursuit, then lie down
and save yourself any way you can. You, Harry,
will take our launch and go out to the Nemesis and
tell Mac everything, adding that my orders are to
wait two clear days for me, and if I don t turn up
in that time to do what seems right to himself.
? But, sir, Mac will never forgive me for leaving
you.?
?Boy, do as you are told. There is more
courage at times in running away than staying
behind to serve no purpose. I will be all right,
I assure you. Go. I have something to say to
this gentleman here.?
? Come along, young man, come forth to the
fray,? said Jones. ? Ours not to reason why.
Ours to through the gardens fly. Ours to get
struck in the eye ?
? Oh, shut up and come along then,? inter-
rupted Harry, and the two passed out into the
passage and through the great hall into the famous
Government Avenue which connects the Mount
Nelson Hotel with Adderley Street. They soon
saw that they were followed, but no attempt was
made to come up with them while in the gardens,
and in a short time they reached the mam street
on the other side. Still their followers kept well
behind, and it was now apparent that they were
waiting to be led somewhere. The streets were
now almost deserted, for the theatres had emptied,
and the last train for the suburbs had departed,
and only an occasional car wound its way along
the somewhat tortuous lines of Cape Town.
? I have a good mind to lead them to where
they should be,? Jones said after they had walked
up and down Adderley Street, along the Strand,

and back again, and were now standing opposite
the post-office.
Where is that? ? asked Harry.
?To the prison,? grunted Jones. ?By the great
compound microbe of yellow jack, I believe they re
making up their minds to come for us now. They
see that we know their intentions. Let us turn
down here to give them some encouragement, and
whenever I sing out to you, you make tracks to
the bottom of this street like young lightning.
Never mind me.?
Jones guessed correctly. The men had suddenly
decided not to wait longer on the chances of being
led to other game, and they crossed the street and
began to close in on their victims. When sure of
them they came on with a rush from all points,
and just as half a dozen threw themselves upon
Jones he cried, ? Clear out, Harry ! ? and, with-
out being interfered with, Harry slipped through,
and raced in the shadows of the street to the har-
bour. But Jones was a born fighter. He had
fought against odds all his life, and it was a posi-
tive pleasure to him to be able to use his fists
instead of his wits for a change. And he was a
hard hitter with them. He knew how to make the
most of himself against a mob, for his experience
had been bought in Singapore, Buenos Ayres, New
York, Callao, and Cardiff. Setting his back
against the wall of a shop, he struck out scien-
tifically, but never uselessly, and every time his
blow fell the man who received it did likewise.
Of course this could not continue for any length
of time, and the attackers well knew that much,
so they settled down to tiring out their man, giving
a wide berth to his fists. No one spoke for a


time, but at length some of the men became un-
easy, and murmurs of ? Vere is Shacobs? ? began
to go round among them. Jones thought he knew,
but he did not feel any inclination to inform them,
and the strange fight went on until a sudden flash-
ing of lights, a series of whistles, and the appear-
ance of a number of policemen put a new aspect
on the affair. Then Jones promptly lay down and
the men ran away. They scattered as they ran to
avoid pursuit, and when they met again beside a
steam launch in the lower harbour they were an
angry lot of men.
? Ach I Donnerwetter ! ? spluttered one, ?we
haf lost our chance, and all through dot Shacobs
not coming up with his chloroform cloth. Vat vill
de Cosmopolites say now? Dey vill laugh at us
and call us bunglers.?
? Here ees Shacobs,? shouted another. ??He
is come quick. Vat for you no? come forward at
de right time, Shacobs? You haf made de Chief
escabe again.?
? Nien,? gasped the late comer ; ??l saw de
Chief after all you fellows left. I did mine vork
all right. He no? trouble Cape Town more.?
? Vat, Shacobs,? cried one of the men, ? did you
finish the vork yourself? ?
??Vat for should I not? ? demanded the Dutch-
man. ?De police all go avay after you fellows,
so I vait an? votch an? here I is. Mine name is
Yacob, is it not? ?
? Den let us get pack to our ship pefore any
more police come,? said the leader, and without
much further talk the men swarmed into the launch
and sailed out into the bay.
Meanwhile Harry was telling his story to Mac


on board the Nemesis , and that veteran at once
called up Mr. Bell and Captain Thomson and
held a council of war.
? WeTe richt in among the folk we?re looking
for,? he announced, after Harry had repeated his
story ; ? and I wad like to hear your opinion as to
what we should do.?
** Follow out the Chief?s instructions to the
letter, ? said Mr. Bell. ?He knows his business,
and he is our commander-in-chief, We must
obey.?
? I am inclined to that opinion too,? put in the
Captain. ?Ifwe do anything on our own account
we may be putting our feet into some little game
of his.?
? Ver a weel, gentlemen,? said Mac. ?It was
only ma anxiety that made me ask your advice,
for I ken weel he is able to look after himself!
I 11 just send a party on shore to pick up poor
Jones. He?ll likely be in the police-office, and
then we 11 wait wi? a? the patience Providence has
gifted us.?
? I?ll go with the shore party,? said Mr. Bell.
There are still some of our own men on shore,
and it is better that we should gather them all in.
Who knows what steps these foreigners will take
next? I would give something to know where
their boat is? I have gone over every boat in all
the harbours with my glasses, but I can see nothing
which could possibly be the Lucifer .?
Man, ye dinna ken,? said Mac wearily, ? I
wadna be a bit surprised mysel? to find that this
timber tub lying alongside was her. She could
change into all shapes. But you?ll be doin? me a
favour, Mr. Bell, if you?ll tak? charge o? the shore


294 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
party. The lads would want tae gang on the hunt
for the Cosmopolites if left to themselves.?
Hastily rousing a dozen men, Mr. Bell told them
what he thought necessary of the circumstances
which had arisen, and soon after set out with them
for the shore. Harry had now gone to Bob Fitz-
gerald, and together they paced the deck until
daylight appeared, talking over the fresh complica-
tions. At dawn the boat returned with Jones and
all the men, but no one had heard a word about
the Chief ; nor could Jones add any information
beyond the fact that the police had assisted him
to rise when the men ran off, and at his own
request took him to the police-station, where he
was found later by his comrades. While he was
relating his version of his experiences the Nor-
wegian tramp alongside picked up her anchor
noisily and lumbered out to sea.
? With your permission, sir,? spoke Mr. Bell,
addressing Mac, ? I would like to take a launch
and go round every vessel in Table Bay. These
people are here somewhere, and the sooner we
find out what disguise they are hiding under the
better it will be for ourselves.?
??You can start after breakfast, Mr. Bell,? said
Mac. ? I mustn?t leave this ship mysel? for a
meenit. 11 '
? Can we have the launch for half ah hour,
sir? ? asked Bob Fitzgerald. ? Harry and I would
like to have a look at this yacht beside us. I am
sure I heard a boat coming alonside her gangway
early this morning.?
? You may, laddie,? answered Mac sadly ; ??but
that is no? the Lucifer ony way. I saw genuine
black smoke come frae her funnel.?


? All the same,? spoke Captain Thomson, our
Italian friend must have gone on board either that
yacht or that timber craft just going out. He could
never swim ashore, for the sharks are pretty bad
about here, and, in any case, had he tried that
some one would certainly have seen him.
But the boys? cruise was barren of results, as
was also that of Mr. Bell and his men later in the
day. Mac and Captain Thomson paced the deck
all day, eagerly watching the movements of every
vessel in the harbour, but night fell and they still
were ignorant of the Chief?s fate. A paragrap
in an evening paper, though, was of special inte-
rest. It read : ? This afternoon a man who gives
his name as Hans Jacobs, a sailor, was found
bound and gagged in a bedroom of the Mount
Nelson Hotel. He says he was set upon by three
men and dragged into the room, but can give no
reasons for the assault. Inquiry at the office of
the hotel elicited the information that the room in
question was booked last night by a young man
who paid in advance, but who has not been seen
since. We hope Cape Town is not going to be
once more the haunt of mysterious secret societies
as it was some years ago, but if so, a policy of
no mercy to the offenders will soon stamp out all
romance among the members of any such gangs.
In another part of the paper was a garbled
version of the attack upon Jones, but evidently
the police themselves had supplied the information
to the Press, and consequently there was more
romance than fact in the paragraph.
A strict watch was kept all night, and a launch
ready manned lay at the foot of Adderley Street
continuously for the Chief?s benefit should he


296 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
appear. But he seemed to have gone and left no
trace, and as the second day drew towards evening
all on board the Nemesis began to wonder vaguely
if he had actually taken the place of the Dutchman
he had left in his room in the hotel.
?It?s left to me to act after to-day,? spoke Mac
to those assembled on the after-deck, ? so, Mr.
Bell, will you see that we have plenty of stores on
board for a long trip.?
? ash my buttons ! ? exclaimed Captain Thom-
son, here?s that yacht that went out yesterday
coming in again. She?s put back for somethin o '
or other, I suppose.?
? I?ll go my month?s salary I?ve seen that fellow
on^ its bridge before,?-? put in Jones.
He s very like one of the men we saw at the
shop in Buchanan Street,? commented Bob to
Harry.
? About that island you talk of, Jones,? said
Captain Thomson ; ? you couldn?t give us any
idea of its position, could you? Was it in the
tropics, or north or south of the line? ?
? T . am not a navigator, sir,? answered Jones,
but it was less than a week?s sail from New York,
and therefore in the Atlantic Ocean somewhere.
It must have been in the tropics, for the sun?s
rays were almost vertical. No, I have it ; it was
June when I was there, and the sun was not quite
overhead. The island must be just north of the
tropics.?
? It must have been one of the West Indies, or
if you are certain about it being just outside
Cancer, probably it was one of the Bahamas.?
I don t think so, sir. I have sailed past them
before, and this island was not like any of those


islands. It lay very low and was covered with
luxuriant vegetation of all kinds, but the water all
around it ?if it really were water ?was a solid mass
of dark brown weeds, and although I was not sup-
posed to know, I noticed that it took us a day?s
steaming, twisting about in a narrow channel all
the time, to gain the open sea, and while we
were getting out birds?if they were birds ?of a
kind I had never seen before were flying all round
us, squeaking horribly, and I could see from my
porthole animals?the kind you sometimes see in
bad dreams?running about over the dark brown
scum that lay around us.?
? Why, man,? cried Captain Thomson, ? you
are describing the Sargasso Sea, the graveyard
of the Atlantic. The chill of death hangs over
that awful zone.?
And a more beautiful little spot than that
which lies in the middle I never set eyes upon,?
said Jones. ? The people whose guest I was
couldn?t have found a better defended place in the
whole world, for no ship could possibly force an
entrance through the living weeds.?
? Do Y�u m ean to tell us, Jones, that there is
really an island in the heart of the Sargasso Sea? ?
The Captain was plainly incredulous.
? I don?t know anything about the sea you men-
sir, replied Jones, ? but I have told you
nothing but hard fact. If you are convinced that
the place I am speaking about is in that sea, then
the sooner you take the Nemesis in that direction
the sooner you will get a chance to strike a blow
at the headquarters of the people we are chasing.?
The Captain looked at Mac. ? I lost a ship
there already, he said. ? It?s a wilderness of


298 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
living death. No man can understand the cur
rents, and the weeds climb over the entangled
ship with a horrible vindictiveness. There are
monstrous rats there, too, and strange blind flying
creatures, and old rotten ships that have lain there
since Drake?s time and long before.?
?But there is a way through,? put in Jones,
?and the other people know that way.?
? And if nothing happens to-night to cause an
alteration in ma plans,? said Mac grimly, 111
ask ye, Captain, to turn the Nemesis's nose to-
wards that place. There?s a wild idea in ma brain-
box somewhere that I ken something aboot that
vera spot. But there?s that ship s launch coming
back from the shore already. They?ve been send-
ing awa? mails they forgot the last time, I expect.
?It would appear so,? said Mr. Bell, for they
are raising their anchor again and will be out to
sea with daylight yet.?
? I feel it in my bones,? said Jones, ? that that
ship could throw a bit of light on our business ?
? Stop right there, Jones,? ordered Mr. Bell.
? That is how you spoil everything. How are we
to know that all you have told us was not some-
thing you merely felt in those confounded bones
of yours. It?s fact, hard, solid fact, engineers
should deal with. Come with me now and we?ll
get stores on board.?
Then darkness fell, and the tail light of the
Lancelot swung round the point and disappeared.
An hour afterwards the fast petrol launch, used
chiefly for taking one or two to the shore, darted
up to the Nemesis's gangway, and, rushing on
board, its occupants, Harry and Bob, tumbled
downstairs into the saloon where Mac and the
Captain were deep in consultation.


?We?ve made a discovery, sir,? shouted. Bob,
handing two papers to Mac. Read them.
? Keep cool, laddies, keep cool,?? Mac said
kindly. ?Tell me first your story.?
? We shadowed two men from that yacht be-
cause we thought one of them was like the man
we saw examining Jim?s patent in Glasgow. They
went into the post-office, and there we saw them
post the letter which contained these papers. We
know, because we heard them ask if the Nemesis
had a box or any shore agents who would see to
its speedy delivery. When they went back to their
ship we called for the Nemesis's mail, but of
course there was no mail in to-day except the one
letter that they posted. It was addressed to ? The
Messrs. Southwood and Fitzgerald, care of Com-
mander S.Y. Nemesis , in port at Cape Town.
We opened the letter, and have come back as
quickly as we could. We can easily catch them
before they go far ?
?Hold hard, young man!? cried Mr. Bell.
? You?re racing away ahead ?
? No, he is not ! ? cried Harry, greatly excited.
? The whole thing is as good as finished if we
catch that steamer that has just gone out.?
? Easy there, ma lad,? said Mac. So far as
I can see, this document is a sort o? deed o? co-
partnery between my laddie an you two, an this
letter is to the effect that he now considers the
partnership dissolved. Is it in his handwriting?
I canna tell that.?
? It is,? shouted the boys.
? And that gives the whole show away,? added
Harry, ? for the paper he kept was written out by
Bob. I have the copy he wrote.?


300 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
I don t understand yet,? said Mac, looking
from one eager face to the other. ??This
letter ?
Is forged, sir, the same as this agreement of
ours. As I have just said, the copy which Jim
kept was written out by Bob, therefore this is a
clever forgery.?
And meant to put us off the scent,? cried
Fitzgerald. Probably the people who sent this
mean to try to get us to tell them the secret of
the power now. See, there is a line or two in
imitation of Jim?s handwriting, which tells us that
we 11 find our share of the money he?s got awaiting
us in Glasgow.?
I begin to see now,? spoke the Captain.
? These Cosmopolites, or whatever they call them-
selves, are beginning to feel that they are being
pushed by us. That secret power you tell me of
has evidently not yet fallen into their hands, and
this letter and forged copy of an agreement is
calculated to make you boys give up the chase,
and, as they seem to think, to take away with you
the speed of the Nemesis .?
? And we never knew the secret of Jim?s accele-
rator,? laughed Southwood hysterically. ?? Oh,
don?t let us allow that boat to get out of our
sight, and we 11 soon make the Cosmopolites sorry
they ever interfered with us.?
** only the Chief were here I ? groaned Mac.
? The Chief must be on board that boat I ? cried
the boys together. ?He would make himself up
to represent the Dutchman and take his place ?
Harry supplemented. ?It?s all as plain as can
be.?
It is, laddies,? spoke Mac suddenly. ? I can


see through the whole scheme. Here comes Mr.
Bell an? the men wi? stores, so we can leave at
once. Captain, I don?t need to tell you what to
do. Harry, run an? stand by the engines. Bob,
go and see aboot lifting the anchor. I?ll tell Mr.
Bell.?
Five minutes later ? Full speed ahead ? rang
out from the bridge, and at the same moment the
ship burst into a blaze of light. She shivered
convulsively for a brief moment, then, gathering
herself as if for a leap, shot forward into the
darkness.
All on board were now made acquainted with
the turn things had taken, and the excitement of
the chase fired their blood until they felt that they
could even eat the Cosmopolites when they caught
them. But Mac and Mr. Bell exercised a re-
straining influence, and pointed out that impetuosity
itself was of little use, as the ship they were fol-
lowing was probably manned by double their num-
ber of men, all skilled and desperate.
?? They?ll need their skill,? cried one of the
men ; ? and as for their desperate nature, we?ll
soon tame it.?
On the Nemesis rushed like a thing of life,
leaving a white wake of shimmering foam which
stretched right back to the shadows of Table
Mountain. They were on the great mail track,
but after half an hour?s running Captain Thomson
swung off to port, and about three-quarters of an
hour afterwards a light appeared on the still waters
only a few miles ahead.
? She is making about seventeen and a half
knots,? announced Mr. Bell, ? and we are touching
twenty-nine.?


? Are you sure that is the Lancelot ? ? asked
Harry, as every man went to his appointed post.
? Yes, that is the vessel which left Table Bay
an hour ahead of us. No other ship could be in
that position going in that direction unless she
passed Cape Town without calling, and we know
that nothing floating did that to-day. What are
your orders, Mr. Macpherson? ?
? Stop her, seize her, make her crew prisoners,
and let Fate determine the rest,? answered Mac
shortly. ? How near can you take us, Captain? ?
? In twenty minutes I can lay this craft so close
alongside that if we reduce our speed to hers then
we could almost bind the two ships together.?
?Very well, do so. Boys, lie doon behind ony
protection ye can find. These beggars may turn a
gun on us at ony minute. But they canna hurt us
though they dae, an? we?ll take it oot o? them
before they?re much older in sin.?
Swiftly, and like an arrow to its mark, the
Nemesis flashed down on the yacht ahead. All
lights had been put out when the yacht had been
first sighted, but not for long now could the near
presence of the avenger be hidden. Suddenly a
shout of alarm arose from the Lancelot. Some
one had seen the long black shadow rushing on
them through the gloom. At the same instant the
searchlight of the Nemesis was turned on, and
the yacht quivered and scintillated in the rainbow
waves of light as if on fire.
? Are we all ready, sir? ? asked Captain Thom-
son. ?In two minutes I?ll shave the paint off her
hull.?
? We are ready,? responded all with one voice,
and before the sound of their voices had died away


THE CAPTURE OF THE LANCELOT 303
a light grating noise filled the air. The Nemesis
had heeled over to starboard, and her forward
motion slackened somewhat. She was shouldering
the other vessel to port.
And now an indescribable clamour sprang up
on the ship so strangely treated. Men rushed on
deck to see what was wrong, and their shouts o
terror and wild curses in a score of different
languages were not pleasant to hear.
? Sheer off 1 sheer off 1 ? shouted the officer on
the bridge, with a volley of oaths ; ? you vill send
us to the bottom.?
? That is our intention 1 ? shouted Captain
Thomson in reply, ? unless you stop your engines
at once. We want to examine your papers.?
The man on the bridge recovered his coolness
at once. ? Oh, that is the game 1? he cried with
a laugh. ? Show your credentials, Cosmopolites.
Instantly a snarling, cursing mob of men rushed
to the side of the vessel, armed with revolvers
and knives.
? If one shot is fired we will sink you without
any hesitation,? warned Captain Thomson. 44 Men,
stand by that forward gun.?
? Who are you? ? shrieked the officer in com-
mand of the Lancelot , dancing with rage. 44 How
dare you attack a vessel on the high seas? This
is piracy.?
? We ken all aboot that,? cried Mac, suddenly
showing himself ; 44 but we?re no? here to discuss
things. Stop your ship and fling your popguns
into the sea, or ?
? It is old Macpherson ! ? shrieked the men.
??We have no chance now.?
? I vill take him to blazes vith me,? shouted the


commander. See, Cosmopolites, be yourselves.
Him I kill I ? He raised his arm as if to shoot,
but instead he suddenly collapsed where he stood,
shot by a bullet from Mr. Bell?s revolver.
At the same moment Mac gave a signal, and
immediately a violent shudder ran through both
ships, and the Lancelot fell away from the
Nemesis , her screws torpedoed from the sub-
merged cylindrical hull of the latter. She now
s^a && ere d about helplessly, and when the Nemesis
was laid alongside once more the men called out :
M e surrender, we surrender ! We fight men,
but not devils who can fight under water.?
Don?t believe them, lads, they?re treacherous
liars ! ? Mac shouted, leaping on board the other
craft with the men of the Nemesis 1 s fighting line.
And his warning was just in time, for a crowd of
desperate Cosmopolites who had been lying be-
hind the bulwarks suddenly rushed at the boarders,
discharging their revolvers point blank. But Mac?s
warning had served its purpose, and the men,
instead of advancing to receive their supposed
prisoners, sprang for shelter.
Then ensued a fight which was as strange as it
was fierce. Both parties were under shelter, with
a deadly zone between. Occasionally a Cosmopo-
lite would rush across that piece of deck and single
out a man from the others. The first man thus
tackled was Mr. Bell, and instead of shooting
his man as he came he waited for him coolly, and
then threw him down.
Tie him, boys,? he then said to Harry and
Bob, who had been among the first to board the
Lancelot , ??it is always one less.?
? Come on, boys, rush them to the after-deck,?


suddenly shouted Jones, perceiving some prepara-
tions Mac had been making on the Nemesis , and
in response to his call the men sprang from their
shelter and closed with the cowering Cosmopo-
lites, and with revolver, knife, and fist the fight
proceeded, sternly, relentlessly, and with the one
object in view. And the men from the Nemesis
were winning, for slowly, but none the less steadily,
they forced their opponents back until they broke
and ran for the after-deck, and prepared to hold
it against all comers.
But that was exactly what they were wanted to
do. Defiantly they stood there in a group ?now
much smaller than at first?awaiting the next on-
slaught, and while they waited a coil of rubber
tubing was shot across from the deck of the
Nemesis and fell in their midst. Of course the
other end of the coil was on the Nemesis. A
pungent odour filled the air. The Cosmopolites
looked at each other blankly. What new form
of fighting was this? Would it never end? For
they were tired.
Ach I Donnerwetter ! Dat is an asphyxiating
gas dot comes from dat tube,? cried a German ;
** drow it overboard I ? He attempted to do so
himself, but he suddenly fell prone on the deck,
and one by one the now listless Cosmopolites
followed suit. Then the men from the Nemesis
gathered them up and carried them on board the
other ship. A squad of the best engineers that
ever worked in a Clyde shipyard then swung a
platform over the Lancelot?s stern, and began to
work at her damaged screws, finally replacing
them with spare ones carried on the Nemesis , and
before morning the Lancelot had resumed her


journey under her own steam but under different
command. No signs of the Chief nor of James
Robertson had been found, but several other im-
portant facts had been brought to light, and now
the hearts of every one were glad.
Side by side the two ships sailed on.


CHAPTER XIV
THE MANNING DOWN PROCESS
When Robertson regained his own cabin with the
bottle he had taken from Valli?s, he placed it
inside a larger bottle, and then put both into an
air-pump until all air was extracted from the large
bottle. Then he sealed it hermetically, and threw
it into a corner with a laugh. ?So much for
Valli?s discovery,? he said ; ? perhaps he?ll be
the first to sample it himself.?
But he had promised to take Miss Collins on
deck that night, and he had yet to arrange a
method of doing so. He stood on the edge of his
berth and reached towards the lamp socket. It
moved to his touch, and he smiled. He had found
a way. He now sat down to wait until nine o?clock,
but had barely been waiting five minutes when a
scream of pain outside his door caused him to
spring to his feet and throw his door open. No
one had touched the door, he knew ; it was for
other reasons that some one had called out. He
saw a man lying on the floor with another bent
over him. The second man was a very powerful-
looking specimen, and unmistakably Dutch.
? What is the matter? ? demanded Robertson ;
? can you not even agree among yourselves? I
307


308 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
will complain to Mr. Hassenrahn that my guards
make night hideous with their yells.?
? Dot vas all right,? spoke the Dutchman, lifting
the other man in his arms, ? I am on guard here
now, an? I vill go to sleep unt make no more
noise. -
? Who are you? ? asked Robertson ; ?I haven?t
seen you here before.?
? Nien, dot is von fact. But every man dot
goes on guard here is found half dead in de morn-
ing, so I am put on to see vat de ghost is like.
My name is Yacobs.? He beamed pleasantly as
he spoke, and then walked away with his burden.
The boy stepped into the passage and looked after
him. He was alone. A wild thought came over
him. He would walk through the ship. Ah 1
Jacobs had left his jailor?s keys behind him. He
picked them up and sprang down the steps to
where the prison was. Soon he had opened all
the doors.
??Mr. Perry ! ? he called ; ? where are you? ?
But no answer came. The cell was empty. He
turned away and met a grinning Cosmopolite, who
had evidently been attracted by the sound of locks
turning. But his grin became set in his face, for
without warning or the slightest hesitation
Robertson had leaped upon him, and forced him
to the floor. But the man struggled to his knees
and drew a ferocious-looking knife, with which
he slashed about vigorously ; and things might
have taken a bad turn for Robertson had not just
then the man Jacobs walked in, still carrying his
old comrade, and tripped over the man on the
floor.
? Dat vos not fair,? the Dutchman remarked ;


? vat you mean by lying down that vay? I might
have broken mine pipe by falling over you.?
He threw his burden into a corner.
? Help me, Shacob,? cried the man with the
knife ; ?de poy attack me.?
? Dot poy? Vot poy? ? Jacobs glared round
the apartment, but just in time to miss seeing
Robertson, who had unceremoniously taken his de-
parture ,
? I think I will continue to explore this ship
only by my private passage,? he remarked to him-
self, as he locked his cabin door again. ??Yet I
feel almost certain that that Dutchman saw me
just now. I wonder why he pretended not to see
me. By Jupiter I What was he doing there him-
self? He seemed to be putting his comrade in
the cell. And anyhow, where was Perry ?
? Give it up, little boy, and attend to me.? The
voice came from the imperfectly-closed mixing
chamber, and, throwing it open, Robertson assisted
Miss Collins to step out into his cabin. ?? I don?t
know that it is quite proper for me to come here,?
she continued, looking round the room, ? but I
suppose the laws of etiquette are not quite so
strict on a pirate ship.?
? I don?t know,? responded Robertson, ? but at
present we are obeying the first law in nature ?
that is, self-defence. It is necessary for us to know
all we can about this ship and its people, so that
we can take steps to protect ourselves. It seems
to me we will be compelled to do something before
long, for it doesn?t need much of a prophet to see
that trouble is looming ahead between the members
of this gang themselves. I heard your father
telling you that Hassenrahn did not leave his cabin
to-day.?


? Yes, he said that, and he also tells me that
he is in a high fever now. Young man, your shot
did its work well. I wonder if we could really
capture this ship by manning the gang down from
our tube. It would be great fun.?
? I have been thinking of late that some one is
doing that now. Hassenrahn himself has reduced
the fighting power of the gang by about half a
dozen that I know of. I am sorry now I have
stopped his amusement. Between Perry and him
and us we might have accounted for quite another
dozen.?
? Well, we?ll plan that out after. Have you
invented a plan to get on deck? ?
? Yes, we are going up through a hole in the
roof of this cabin. That lamp-bracket up there
comes out, and we?ll go through the hole in which
it is fitted.?
? But how am I to get up there? I am not an
acrobat.?
??No, but I am, in an amateur sort of way,
and I?ll pull you up. From the cabin overhead a
door opens out to the aft companionway, which is
seldom used, and leads on to the poop deck just
behind a lot of portable small boats and other
gear.?
While Robertson was speaking he had pulled
a table to the middle of the floor, and had un-
coiled a piece of rope and formed a loop at one
end of it. He next climbed on to the table and
pushed the lamp cautiously out of its socket, and
then with a spring which showed that he was a
perfectly-trained athlete, he shot himself into the
hole. His hands gripped the upper edges, his body
followed, and before Miss Collins had realised that


it was all done by strength of muscle alone, he had
passed through the aperture.
? Now,? he cried, looking down, ? hand me the
free end of that rope and get up on the table.
That?s right. Put your left foot in that loop now
and grip the rope as high up as you can with your
left hand.?
? But I would rather hold on with both hands.
41 And then you would jam in this hole. Do as
I tell you at once.?
44 You are not very nice to me. Most men would
at least talk differently ?
44 But talking wouldn?t help us in the slightest,
and I look upon you as my comrade, not as a
helpless girl who requires gentle handling.?
44 Helpless girl, indeed ! ? pouted the lady, grip-
ping the rope as directed ; 44 what next, I
wonder? ?
The next was Robertson putting his strength
into the rope, and thus raising her from the table.
Then, putting his foot upon the rope where he had
it turned round a fixture, to prevent it slipping
back, he reached down and caught Miss Collins?s
hand.
44 Let go now,? he said, 44 I?ve got you. Catch
my hand this way.?
She meekly obeyed, and next moment felt her-
self being pulled through the lamp-bracket hole
as easily as if she were a little girl instead of a
very substantial young lady. She saw the reason
of Robertson?s strange grip now, and also the
meaning of using only one hand. The grip was
one that Robertson and his fellow-apprentices had
proved over and over again, and by using only the
one hand her body was reduced to the smallest


possible size by the strain. Soon she stood beside
her companion in the upper cabin. It appeared
to be an armoury, which fact gave Robertson much
pleasure, and he straightway threw down into his
own cabin a couple of revolvers, a box of cart-
ridges, and a couple of formidable knives.
? But the door is locked, and we have no key,?
spoke the lady, after a brief inspection of the place.
? How are we to get out, Mr. Inventor? ?
? By removing the lock, of course,? promptly
came the answer; ?I?ll have it off in a few
minutes.?
And he was as good as his word, though how
he had managed it Miss Collins did not know.
The door was now opened, and a flight of stairs
leading upwards lay before them.
? Til have some more of these weapons in case
we may need them,? remarked the boy, going back
into the cabin and selecting a revolver, which he
loaded, and a knife. ? Now we?re ready. Follow
me, and don?t on any account scream if I have to
tackle any one.?
Next moment they stood on deck and breathed
the free, fresh air of the ocean. The night was
sultry, and a thunderstorm was working up from
the north-east. Around them lay a heterogeneous
mass of winches, portable boats, guns, ropes, and
diving gear, and, looking forward, they saw that
the whole ship was in the same state of confusion.
? Why, what a strange ship this is I ? exclaimed
Miss Collins aloud. ?Itis a dirty old tramp. It
is well for the crew that my father is not the
owner.?
? Hush, for goodness? sake 1 ? whispered Robert-
son ; ? remember where we are. Ah I There is


some one hiding behind that coil of rope. He sees
us. I?ll have to go for him. Just stand here a
minute ?
? No, no ! ? cried Miss Collins, seizing his arm?;
? you are only a boy. He will kill you ?
? Dot vas so I ? grunted a voice from the rope.
? I vill kill any one who keeps me from mine sleep
to-night.?
? It?s Jacobs,? whispered Robertson ; ?he
doesn?t seem to have recognised us.?
A series of snores interrupted his words. Jacobs
was sleeping.
? Oh, you needn?t worry about him,? said Miss
Collins ; ? that must be the man who came to
repair something for Miss Vanderbilt yesterday.
He is a good-natured simpleton, and seemed eager
to show how friendly he was. To-day, too, he
has been pestering my father with his attentions.
He is harmless. Let us get over to the other side
and watch that steamer away under that bank of
illuminated lightning clouds.?
They picked their steps among the deck gear,
and had almost gained the shadows of the boat in
which Robertson had hidden before, when two men
came hurrying aft, bearing lanterns.
? Quick 1 ? whispered Robertson, ? those men
are on special duty of some kind back here. I
know them. They are the best signallers on board.
Creep under the boat.?
On came the men, and, if possible, louder than
ever Jacobs snored. The men laughed as they
heard him, and went over to torment him.
? Dat is Yacobs. He will waka de ship wit his
trumpet,? said one.
? Ve vill him vake,? laughed the other ; ? he no
right has to sleep. Hallo 1 ?


Jacobs had suddenly jumped to his feet, and,
with a blow which resounded all along the deck,
sent the speaker staggering among the coils of
rope which lay everywhere around.
? Yacoba ! ? shouted the Portuguese wildly, as
the aroused one then came straight to him. ?It
is I, your comrade Philippa Gracia ! ?
His comrade ? Yacoba ? had closed with him,
and after crushing his bones until the victim felt he
had been passed between steam rollers, he threw
him, limp and all but lifeless, on top of his friend.
Then the redoubtable Dutchman began whistling
cheerily an air of happy Holland, and leisurely
set about tying the fallen men to a convenient
anchor.
? Whatever can be the meaning of this? ? whis-
pered Miss Collins, as they stood in the shadows,
silent spectators of all that had happened. ? That
man must be mad. How strong he is, too, and
how unconcerned I ?
? I rather fancy he has been at a game like this
before,? Robertson answered. ? His actions re-
mind me strongly of Hassenrahn?s. I wonder if
they are in league to man down the Cosmopolites
by murderous sudden attacks.?
? Look at him now. What is he doing with the
lamps? ?
The Dutchman was swinging the two lamps in a
peculiar manner, facing the stern meanwhile.
? Why, he is signalling to something?and see I
There is an answer. There is a ship coming up
without lights close behind. It must be the
Lancelot again ; but why has she no lights? ?
Pirates do not as a rule care about advertising
their whereabouts,? said Miss Collins. ?My!


1 YACOBA ! ? SHOUTED THE PORTUGUESE WILDLY, ?IT IS I, YOUR
COMRADE




THE MANNING DOWN PROCESS 315
What an adventure we?re having. Life is worth
living now.?
? Shall I drop that Dutchman? ? asked Robert-
son irrelevantly ; ? I?ve had him covered these
last ten minutes.?
? Oh no, the man is playing our game for us.
Leave him alone. But I wonder why the decks
are deserted to-night. We could walk right along
and not see any one.?
? Which doesn?t by any means guarantee that
people wouldn?t see us,? laughed Robertson, un-
less Jacobs, or Hassenrahn, or Perry have already
been working along there. Hallo ! crush into
the side. Here comes Hassenrahn and Mr.
Collins. Jupiter ! the German can?t walk. See
how he leans on your father?s arm.
? We?ll be caught, and so will Jacobs. They?re
sure to see those two men lying over there.?
? We?ll have to chance it now. But listen ! ?
? Yes, Mr. Collins,? Hassenrahn was saying,
? there is some great mystery on this ship which
I cannot solve. The men have lost their old spirit
of happy recklessness, and here am I almost use-
less through that confounded bullet. You tell me
that it couldn?t possibly have been fired by that
revolver we found?
??You can stake your pile on that,? replied
the American. ? I guess I should know all about
lead-squirters, and I tell you that the bullet which
gave you your holiday came from a Smith and
Wesson revolver, while the one your men picked
up, and which you believe was fired by that fellow
whose head you smashed, was an ordinary Colt.
Where is that fellow now, by the way? ?
? I don?t know. But I didn?t smash his head.


Mr. Collins. How could I? It took me all my
time to get into my own room. And then the
mystery of Perry. I tell you I stood over him
while he sent off that message.?
? Funny business altogether. What was the
message, anyhow? ?
? Oh, a more or less meaningless jargon. It
read : ? Sorry ?everything?not?right. Don?t ?
expect ?any ?cargo ?after ?to-morrow.? That was
all, and it was flashed into space by our own
patent radiograph.?
? I can see, Hassenrahn, it is about time you
left the Cosmopolites to themselves,? laughed Mr.
Collins ; you are not half bad enough a man to
make a commercial success of a pirate gang. And
your nerves are out of order, too. You saw one
of your rascals experimenting on that wonderful
instrument you told me about, and your excited
fancy did the rest. Why, the message itself might
tell you that much. It was sheer nonsense. But
you said you expected the Lancelot to come up
to-night? ?
? I did, but something may have gone wrong.
Those confounded boys may have upset my plans,
or the Chief himself may have taken a hand, and
then there is that wizard old Macpherson against
us, too. I?ll see it through now, though, come
what may. Ah 1 there?s Jacobs. He has during
the last day or two developed into one of the best
men among the Cosmopolites. Any signs,
Jacobs? ?
Jacobs, during the last few minutes, had been
engaged throwing a tarpaulin cover over the
victims of his strength. He had apparently been
unconscious of the approach of his superior, but


THE MANNING DOWN PROCESS 317
at the sound of his voice he sprang to attention
and saluted. _ ? ~
? Any signs of the Lancelot , Jacobs? repeated
Hassenrahn, sitting down to rest on a barrel.
? I dink mine eyes catch von sight a flight
mit two lights apove, far away pack, sir,? an-
swered the Dutchman ; "lam vait here to vatch
all night.? . , ?
? An inverted triangle was the agreed signa ,
said Hassenrahn. ? But why are you here alone?
I thought I ordered all watches to be taken m
twos, until we had seen into some matters?
? Oh, I no? ?fraid of ghosts,?- responded the
happy Dutchman ; ??l dink mine mate he go down
below for night glasses. He vill pe pack pefore
soon.? , . ,
? Ah well, report to me in my cabin when you
make out the Lancelot. Good-night.?
? Good-night, sir.?
? And say, Dutchy,? called out Mr. Collins,
? here are some of those cigars you could hardly
resist taking from my cabin to-day. I was watch-
ing you while you repaired the electric fittings,
and by gosh 1 I believe I would have stolen the
cigars myself had I been in your position.
? Dank you, sir,? said the Dutchman, ? dey vas
von good schmokes.?
The two men went away, Mr. Collins almost
carrying Hassenrahn. The instant they had gone
off the poop the lazy movements of Jacobs changed
into motions which showed that he was by no
means so slow as he pretended to be. He jumped
down the aft companion way, and almost imme-
diately reappeared carrying the man he had left
in the cell earlier in the evening. Behind him


came another man, also bearing a human burden,
and, as he passed the watchers, they realised with
a start that they were peering into Perry?s face.
Again the Dutchman and Perry repeated their per-
formances, bringing up two more men, all bound
and gagged effectively.
? We?ve only six to-night, Perry, which makes
ten less in all,? said the Dutchman ; ? I?ll get
Dessaix on the game to-night though, and we?ll
draw bigger prizes later.?
? How about the Marquis? Couldn?t he be
made use of? He is easily a match for any one.
Then there might be some good material among
the Lancelot's old crew? ?
No, we?ll have to play it out ourselves in
the meantime,? answered the Dutchman in perfect
English ; ??if we let any more in we run the risk
of getting the whole scheme ruined.?
While they were speaking they had hoisted a
boat over the stern, and had placed their bound
prisoners in it. Then, lighting a lamp, Perry fixed
it on the bows of the small craft, and next moment
they had lowered it into the sea, and thrown the
ropes after it.
? Gracious ! ? exclaimed Miss Collins in horri-
fied amazement, ? they?re drowning these people.?
? I think they mean them to be picked up by the
mysterious ship that is following in our wake,?
said Robertson ; ??at any rate, we can?t help them,
and we should be very foolish to try.?
The Dutchman now signalled again with his
lamps, and out of the darkness astern flashed an
answer. The two men waited for some time gazing
at the little light on the drifting boat they had
launched, but after a time it disappeared, and


three flashes of light from behind seemed to assure
them that everything was right, and they went
below.
? We?ll never get behind all the mysteries on
this ship,? said Miss Collins, when they were alone.
? That man is no Dutchman, and Hassenrahn
wasn?t lame when we saw him last. Take me
back to my cabin. I?ve seen enough for one
night. We?re in the hands of a gang of mur-
derers, as well as counterfeiters and pirates.
Cautiously they emerged from their hiding-place
and made their way across the deck to the com-
panion entrance, but they saw no signs of any one.
Apparently there was no watch, or a fate, now
quite common on board, had overtaken it. From
the steering tower only gleamed a light, and in
it the Marquis Ikato sat, a chart of the central
Atlantic spread before him, and a brace of revol-
vers on the table beside him. He was taking no
risks.
Robertson replaced the lock on the door from
which he had removed it, and then assisted his
companion through the trap leading into his own
cabin. He then swung himself through and pulled
the lamp-socket into its place. A cry from Miss
Collins made him turn quickly. She was pointing
to the table on which he was standing, and upon
which also reposed a scrap of paper.
? That wasn?t there when we left,? she ex-
claimed, ? Some one has been here.?
Mechanically Robertson picked up the paper.
There were some words written on it in pencil.
? The mysteries are getting deeper than ever,?
he said with a laugh. ? This paper says : ?lf you
look out through your porthole to-night about mid-


night you may see something which will interest
you.? ?
? Dear me I Our little secret about the tube is
known then. We?ll have to say goodbye, I guess,
Mr. Robertson.?
? I don?t know; lam beginning to suspect
something. It was either Hassenrahn or the
Dutchman who left this note here. The question
is, how did they get in? ?
? Then you don?t think it was by the tube? ?
?No, because they are not here now, and they
couldn?t go away again and bolt up that manhole
from the inside, Hassenrahn, as we know, too,
could not come down the way we came just now,
and no one could enter by the door without letting
the whole ship know. It must have been that fat
Dutchman, but how he could wriggle through
that hole beats me, yet that is the only way any
one could get in here. I will take the hint, how-
ever, and keep a good look-out when midnight
comes.?
? Meanwhile take me back to my own cabin.
Popa may be wanting to come in to speak to me,
and of course my door?s locked just now.?
Robertson unscrewed the manhole door, and
they entered the tube and crawled along. Look-
ing into Hassenrahn?s cabin, they saw that gentle-
man and Mr. Collins deep in conversation, but the
former was in bed. Seeing that as yet she had
not been missed, Miss Collins thought she would
like to prolong the tour of exploration, and to
gratify her wishes Robertson led her to the engine-
room spy-hole.
? From here I have witnessed one or two fero-
cious attacks,? he told her ; ? this is a favourite
resort of Hassenrahn?s during the night.?


Look ! There he is ! ? cried Miss Collins.
?He is hiding behind that box over there.?
By Jupiter i he is,? exclaimed Robertson ;
and yet we have just left him in bed. He must
have a private way of getting here.?
?Watch ! he is going to spring out upon that
engineer when he passes his hiding-place. What
murderous brutes he and that Dutchman must be !
Ah ! Miss Collins smothered a scream, for as
she was speaking the engineer had met the fate
she had foretold. Hassenrahn, with certainly no
signs of lameness, had leaped on the unsuspecting
man, and another victim had quietly fallen before
him.
There will soon be no men left on the ship at
this rate, said Robertson ; ?I wonder what con-
nection there is between Hassenrahn and the man
Jacobs. Likely that fellow Perry is repeating
this programme somewhere else just now. Let
us get away. It is time we had a look at Valli,
the Greek. Hassenrahn is going to pay him a
visit to-night, and each means to have the life
of the other, I know,?
Look I There is that man Perry and another
coming here. Will they fight too? ?
? Listen I we?ll soon find out. That other man
is a Frenchman called Dessaix ; he is not a bad
sort.?
Veil, mon ami, I vill stand by until you tell
me it is all over,? spoke the Frenchman ; ? but
why did you not to me tell the story sooner? I
could have made one or two more passengers for
to-night.?
Oh, ve couldn?t tell you sooner,? answered
err >> as Hassenrahn, watching an opportunity,
21


slipped past them unobserved. ?You see, it was
only last night we got in touch with the other craft
and heard what had happened. Then we nearly
bungled things by not knowing the code. Of
course, the Chief knew that only every second
word counts, but then he didn?t begin to hustle
-?at least so far as I know ?until yesterday. We 11
send the second boat on to-night. There is not
a man of the watch left on deck, and we hope
to do the same trick with those who go on at
midnight.?
?It is vonderful ! Vat vill Hassenrahn do ven
he finds he has no Cosmopolites? ?
? I expect by that time he will have to take his
own gruel. But I am wanted now. When you
get my signal, stop the engines until you receive
the second one, and then let them go like blazes.
You must, of course, make a prisoner of the man
who comes to relieve you.?
The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders signifi-
cantly, and the American went away ; and, seeing
that nothing more would happen in the engine-
room for some time, the two watchers also took
their departure, a new light beginning to dawn
upon them. They stopped at Valli?s cabin and
looked in. He was sitting at a table mixing
various fluids, apparently doing this to keep him-
self awake. He did not seem to have much interest
in his work, and stopped from time to time to
listen, as if expecting a visitor.
And soon his visitor arrived. A knock sounded
at his door, and he got up, looked round the cabin
to satisfy himself that everything was in order, and
then opened the door. As the watchers had ex-
pected, Hassenrahn entered. But this time he
was limping.


Well, Valli,? he said with a laugh, sitting
down upon the couch, ? here I am, as you see.
How go matters with you? Still making fresh
discoveries, eh? ?
In a leetle way, sir. Ees your leg giving you
mooch pain? ?
?Oh no. I almost forget at times which is
the injured limb, so it can?t be very bad.? The
voice in which Hassenrahn spoke sounded some-
what strange, but Valli did not notice the fact,
and, turning to his table, said :
But the sheep not yet has come alongside.
Ees eet not time? ?
Oh, it is hanging back until the next watch.
I am in touch with it now on our new air-wave
radiator. We have succeeded wonderfully well?
at least, from my point of view.?
Zat ees good. Soon ve vill have ze men in
zere proppair place now. Only you an? Valli
vill know anyting.?
? That is so, Valli. What stuff is that you are
working with just now? ?
? Z f ees von S rea * discovery,? said Valli, hand-
ing a bottle to the other. ? Smell I ? His small
eyes glittered. ? Zat ees a strange compound.
Zee, eet ees a powder. Smell I ?
? H won?t poison me, will it? ?
?Ha! ha I you joke. Vat for would Valli
poison his Chief? I merely vish you to know vat
eet ees like. Hal you like eet? Eet ees very
great discovery for destroying ze memory. Your
memory ees all gone now.?
What ! Valli? You asked me to smell it.
id you mean to take my memory from me? ?
The German sprang to his feet, forgetting his
wounded limb in his excitement.


?Ha I ha I ? laughed the Greek. ? Sect down,
my Chief. I haf von joke with you. Zat ees ze
great powder, but I haf now a greater. But tell
me, ees all ze past still quite clear to you? Who
are you, and who am I?
Hassenrahn turned his head away, and the
watchers saw a grim smile overspread his features.
? Oh, he has been tricked by Valli, after all,?
whispered Miss Collins. ?He has inhaled that
deadly powder.?
Yes, he seemed to do that,? responded Robert-
son, ? but he has some game of his own on. He
allowed himself to be taken in too easily, and that
grin on his face was one of a man who had just
remembered some debt he had got to pay, and
which would give him pleasure to discharge, not
that of a man whose mind had just become a
blank.?
? I do feel a bit hazy about my past,? spoke
Hassenrahn, ? but explain the joke, and take away
that effect. It is too uncanny for my taste.?
? No, no, my Chief. Do not be in ze hurry so
mooch. We two are men of science, an? ve like
exact to be? Vair veil. Eet ees now von quarter
from midnight ; ven eet ees ze five minutes I
vill take away ze effect of zat powder. But hear
me now. Stay you steel, Chief ! Stay you steel
where you are.?
? What 1 you greasy little reptile I Do you
threaten me? ? roared Hassenrahn.
? Zat ees as eet may be,? returned the Greek
almost insolently, ? I now laugh in your face.
You are von beeg fool. You order Valli as eef
he vere dirt to you. Now he vill order you. You
no longer Chief of ze Cosmopolites. Valli has


taken zat from you. You have no memory, you
forget everyting, your past ees dead. You nobody.
Bah 1 I would upon you spit eef I vere not a
chentleman.?
Hassenrahn drew his hand wearily across his
eyes, but Robertson saw that they shone with the
light of restrained passion, and instinctively he
felt that Hassenrahn was not under the spell of
Valli?s memory-destroying powder. In fact, his
face now seemed as if he had suddenly recovered
something he had lost. It was now a face remark-
able for its signs of intellect, and all traces of
weariness and nerves had gone.
?It is a good joke, Valli,? he said, ? but your
time is nearly up.?
? Vat you about time know? You are dreaming.
You ?
? I think, Valli, you once told me that a second
inhalation of your drug destroyed the effects of
the first, and completely restored the memory
again? ?
? Vat you dream now? ?
? Only that my full memory had just been re-
stored. You see, I have been labouring under
the effects of your drug for some time now. You
made a big mistake, Valli, for which you are now
going to suffer. I have been living for this
moment since that night ?
?Ah I I see your eyes now. Vat haf I done?
You ?are ?not ?Hassenrahn 1 ?
?No, I am only masquerading in his name.
But as I see you now know me it is useless saying
anything further. Come with me, Valli. Time
is up.?
?Ah 1 You fool, you double fool, to think to


cheat Valli. Time ees up, an? now you are mad.
You haf been sitting above a bottel of gas which at
five minutes to twelve was set free. Eet ees my
new discovery. Eet not only destroys ze memory,
but eet destroys ze brain as well. Ha ! ha ! ha ! ?
? Again you have made a mistake, Valli. At
least, you are going into the sea whether I am sane
or not.?
He seized the Greek in his arms and clapped
one hand over his mouth, then, despite his strug-
gles, bore him from the room.
? Oh, my ! ? gasped Miss Collins. ? I?ll never
get a night?s sleep again. Is the man really
mad? ?
? I don?t think so,? said Robertson ; ? you see,
I removed Valli?s bottel. I have it in my room.
But it is just on the stroke of eight bells, and I
have a kind of an appointment to keep. You had
better not come with me. I will take you to your
cabin now.?

CHAPTER XV
THE END OF THE CHASE
Robertson?s brain was in a whirl. Who was
this man who masqueraded as Hassenrahn? And
was it he and not the real Hassenrahn whom he
had seen so often prowling about during the night?
But he had himself shot the German. Or was it
really the German he had shot? Had he ever
met the real Hassenrahn? Was there a real Has-
senrahn at all? It could not be Jacobs who was
impersonating the Chief of the Cosmopolites, for
he had that very night seen and overheard those
two men in conversation. Then who was Jacobs?
And why did he roam about at night looking for
victims? Then how had Perry come to be free
without any one knowing? And what ? He
stopped trying to think the matter out. The effort
only made his head swim. ?It is all a horrible
dream,? he muttered to himself. ? I?ll wake up
presently and find myself back in Glasgow.?
A knock sounded on his door, and he jumped up.
? It am me, Wun Lung,? spoke a voice outside.
? Want talky talky, vely impoltant.?
? All right, Wun Lung, talky talky away,?
answered Robertson, admitting the Chinaman.
?It is a bit late, though, isn?t it? ?


? Oh, dat no mattel. Me wanty tell you tings
no light on this shipy. Ally men am locky upy
in folecastle. Del am no watchy kept, an Hassen-
lahn am so ill dat he have to go to bed, an?
Amelican man say he have fevel an? no can lise fol
some time. I tink him mad.?
?Mad I What makes you think that, Wun
Lung? ? cried Robertson, the idea occurring to
him just then that perhaps after all it was Has-
senrahn who had visited Valli, and that although
he had laughed at the Greek he might have become
a victim to his first drug.
? Well, he pass me in alleyway goin? to his
cabin, an? he say to me : ?Wun Lung, if you
don?t go to bed you?ll see ghosts to-night.? Now,
I no liky ghosts, so come talky talky you, an? tell
you of a plan Wun Lung make.?
The Chinaman paused to watch his listener?s
face, but it remained unmoved, and he continued :
?My plan is'. I will killy the men?s cook an? thlow
him to the shalks. I can easily stick big knife in
him while he sleeps, an? keepy back his squeal with
handelchief tied lound his thloat. Aftel killy him
I will put a poison I know well into all de men?s
blekfas? fol to-mollow, an? they all die. You, an?
me, an? Amelican man, an? gils, den thlow ?em all
into sea, an? you sail dis shipy some polt, sell it,
an? give Wun Lung some money, an? him maky
thlacks fol Shanghai. Wun Lung no? cale fol
dead ghosts he kill himself. You cuty a man?s
thloat flom de light to left him ghost no come
aftel. Wha? you say? ?
?You have taken my breath away, Wun Lung.
Wholesale murder is an art I have never studied,
and I must say I did not know that interesting


fact you have told me about making certain against
ghosts by cutting the throats of the prospective
spirits in the way you mention. No, Wun Lung,
your plan will not do. I, too, have a plan, and
if it works you?ll be able to go back and become
an honest pirate in China before you are very
much older. Hallo ! the engines have stopped.
What can be the matter? ? He paused, then con-
tinued under his breath as the explanation occurred
to him : ?? Oh, of course. Dear me ! I forgot
I heard the Frenchman and Perry arrange to stop
the ship at a given signal. Jupiter ! And I was
to look through my porthole at midnight.?
? Have you any pins ol knives you no want? ?
broke in Wun Lung, ?Me go back an? play to
joss fol anotel plan. I have no mole pins to sticky
in him, an? he no speaky if I no maky him.?
? ft must be very convenient to have a god you
can force to your will by sticking pins and knives
into him,? said Robertson. ? Here are all the
sharp things I have. Go away and use them, and
tell me the result in the morning.?
?Me have heaps of plans den. Mole pins mole
plans. My joss I makey outy ole boxes, an? he
no heal me play to him if pins no sticky in
enough.?
Robertson did not appear to take an interest in
Wun Lung?s joss sufficient to please the Celestial,
so, gathering up the pins and nails he had been
offered, he glided away to his prayers, leaving
the indifferent one staring through his open port-
hole. And well might he stare. A ship was
alongside and quite close to him. He rubbed
his eyes and looked again. It was no dream, for
the ship was still there. It was a large yacht,


and lay shrouded in a darkness which was inten-
sified by a great searchlight which played on the
waters between it and the Lucifer. Robertson put
his head through the porthole to see better, and
then saw that the searchlight was concentrated on
a ship?s boat passing between the two vessels.
The boat was packed with helpless humanity, for
in the intense light Robertson saw that every man
was bound except the man who was rowing, and
that man was Hassenrahn or his mysterious double.
The boat soon reached the other vessel, and was
hoisted on deck at once with its freight still on
board. Then the searchlight was shut qfT, and
the rest of the proceedings were not plain to the
watcher. But voices now broke out, and he
listened.
? Oh, man, hoo were ye so reckless? I thocht
ye were lost for ever, and auld Mac would hae tae
gang roond the world like a modern Fleein? Dutch-
man,? one voice said, and Robertson felt a strange
thrill permeate his being. The voice rang familiar,
and yet he could not remember where he had heard
the kindly Scotch accent before.
? Oh, I wasn?t so reckless as all that, Mac,?
some one replied ; ?I laid my plans well. But
your boy is all right, and he is one of which you
may well feel proud. He is playing a deep game
of his own just now, and I honestly believe he
could win without our help. I keep a constant
watch over him, although he doesn?t know it.
?We believe, sir, from what we have dis-
covered, that the Lucifer is bound for the Sar-
gasso Sea,? put in another voice. ? Have you any
knowledge which bears that out or disproves it? ?
?It is quite true, Captain. There is an island


in the very heart of the watery waste, and the Cos-
mopolites have their home there. I only remem-
bered that fact to-night about half an hour ago,
but unfortunately I know nothing about the channel
leading in, so unless I can find out you will just
have to follow us. We shall now go full speed,
and should reach the spot in a week?s sail if
nothing happens. You can come on as fast as
you can, and the Nemesis can connect between
us, or possibly, if the sea keeps calm, tow you up
every night to receive your cargo.?
? But how have you managed to do all this,
sir? ? asked some one. ?It seems impossible
that one man could do so much. We have how
over two dozen of them on board, in addition to
those we captured with the ship.?
? I am not alone. There are several staunch
friends on board. But, Mac, old man, Valli is
among your latest guests, so look after him. I
am in full possession of my memory up to that
night now, but I am as hazy as can be as to what
transpired since then. Don?t you use the Greek,
therefore, until we are free, so that each of us can
make up the deficiency in the other. I mean you
can tell me first everything from that night to this,
and then I can repeat it to you after you sample
Valli?s powder.?
? All right, Chief, I ken what you mean ; but
it will be vera deeficult for me to keep ma hands
off the man. Did ye say the laddie was weel? ?
?He is, Mac, and going strong. I don?t re-
member, you know, much about him, but I kept
a diary while on board, and it has given me suf-
ficient data to enable me to connect things up.
I?ll make myself known to him some time soon.


But good-night, lads ; remember, there is good
pay for this. No, don?t cheer. There is not a
man on watch ?they are all here ; but those turned
in might wonder, and they are still much too
strong for us. Likely some of them are watching
us now, but they will not suspect anything, as they
all know you were to come alongside to-night.
Good-night.?
? Good-night, sir,? responded a number of
voices, and immediately after the searchlight was
turned on again, and a boat pushed out from the
other ship. But it carried half a dozen men be-
sides Hassenrahn, and Robertson had not noticed
their faces in the ranks of the Cosmopolites
hitherto. The boat gained the side of the Lucifer,
and some one worked an engine which hauled it
on deck. A moment later Robertson heard the ex-
plosion which heralded the restarting of the
engines, and as he looked the yacht dropped astern.
Just then her lights were switched on and her
decks became visible. Standing amidships were
a crowd of men who looked very British in appear-
ance ; they certainly had no resemblance to the
Cosmopolites on board the Lucifer, and did not
seem to be the same men whom Robertson had
seen on board the Lancelot when last she was
alongside.
? So that is Mr. Collins?s yacht back again after
her journey to Cape Town,? he spoke. ? I won-
der if Bob and Harry were misled by the letter
from me which she carried. Anyhow, events are
shaping here which promise some adventure,
an( i ? He stopped and gazed in sheer astonish-
ment at the yacht now quickly being left behind.
Standing in the bows, watching the speeding


Lucifer, in the flare of an electric arc lamp, were
his two comrades, Harry Southwood and Bob Fitz-
gerald. There could be no doubt about it. He
could not be mistaken in them. He groaned.
? Was this, then, the end of his comrades? brave
chase after him? They had been duped by the
forged letter, and somehow or other had been in-
duced to go on board the Lancelot , with the result
that they were now prisoners too. As he looked
a flash of light seemed to shoot across the ocean
from the north, aiming straight at the Lancelot,
? That must be that supposed patent German gas-
engine torpedo-boat,? Robertson said to himself.
? She has been watching us all the afternoon and
evening, and now means to have a look at the
Lancelot. Jupiter I what a terrific speed she is
making. She could sail rings round us.? The
lights of the Lancelot faded from view, and Robert-
son pulled in his head. Then he became conscious
that the Lucifer had just put on full speed herself
for the first time since leaving Cape Town, and
from the rapidity of the explosions and the vibra-
tion which ran through the whole ship, it was
evident to him that she was being forced.
? Now or never is my chance,? he spoke aloud.
I?ll blow the ends out of the cylinders, and
then ?
?? Dot would be foolish,? said a voice, and
Robertson, with a start, saw that he had neg-
lected to secure his door when Wun Lung left.
It opened, and the man Jacobs came in and sat
down upon the edge of the table, which still re-
mained in the middle of the cabin. He was a
tall man, Robertson noted, and a trifle theatrical
in appearance.


?What do you want?? demanded Robertson.
? I will shoot you the first attempt you make to
move. I know more about you and your work
than you think, and I am not the slightest bit
afraid of you.?
?Dot vas goot,? smiled the Dutchman, nodding
his head in approval. ?I do not know who I
vas mineself just now. But I come here as a
friend, and to tell you that it is in your interests
to make this ship travel all she can for the next
six days.? Unconsciously he had dropped his
Dutch accent, which fact Robertson at once per-
ceived .
? Indeed 1 Why, may I ask? It is nothing to
me if the Cosmopolites are chased by that German
destroyer back there. On the contrary, it might
mean my rescue.?
?That is not a German destroyer. It is a
twin-hulled craft built on the lines of the United
States invulnerable torpedo-boats. The power and
fighting parts are all in a separate hull under
water.?
Robertson looked at the man in amazement.
This certainly was no happy-go-lucky Dutchman.
? Who are you? ? he asked ; ? and what do you
know of the United States submergible twin-hull
ships? I thought they were only in the experi-
mental stage, and could not come so far from a
base.?
? My boy, who I am at present is a bit of a
mystery even to myself. I am a Cosmopolite, and
that should be sufficient to show you that there
are few scientific discoveries made or engineering
inventions brought out that I do not know.?
? You have come to tell me, then, I suppose,


that you now have the secret of the accelerating
power? That I do not believe, however, for
although you have got my two comrades in your
hands, they couldn?t tell you, simply because they
don?t know. Oh, I found your little note all right,
and saw all that happened to-night.?
? Then you must know that I am your friend.?
? Friend I It is a strange kind of friend who
keeps me a prisoner on a pirate ship.?
? Boy, I am, nevertheless. I need not tell you
that I am not a Dutchman. I, like you, am a
victim of circumstances which compel me to act
a part. I am your father?s friend, and therefore
yours. There are quite a number of men on this
ship now all working for your interests.?
?You used the present tense. Do you mean
that my father still lives? ?
?He does. I saw him less than an hour ago.?
? Then he is the Macpherson every one talks of
here? ?
? That is the name he was known by when he
was one of the chiefs of the Cosmopolites. He
invented that accelerating method which you now
control. But the secret he shared with me. As
a matter of fact, I was the last person who manu-
factured the stuff on board.?
? Then you know the secret? And my father is
a member of a gang of counterfeiters? ?
?Of course I know the secret. It is a picric
acid compound ; that should be enough to con-
vince you of my knowledge. The Cosmopolites
were scientifically-inclined gentlemen who were
banded together to invent means of solving some
of Nature?s problems, such as aerial flights, sub-
marine exploring, and other things, when your
father was a member.?


? But how can he be my father if his name is
Macpherson? ?
? He was the victim of an outrage which made
him forget his name for a long time. He is now
on your track, however, on a ship that can out-
sail this vessel as easily as this one can outclass
any other craft. But we wish to discover the lost
secret of our island, and that is why we have to
act cautiously just now. Once we are there you
will meet him Dot vas so, an? vat you do
mit it den? I tink you should tell de Chief. He
vill be so pleased.?
Robertson looked up at the sudden change in
the speaker?s voice, but his face had grown stolid
once more, and he was the very picture of a stage
Dutchman. But the reason was not far to seek,
for at that moment Hassenrahn, supported on the
arm of Mr. Collins, limped into the compartment.
Jacobs instantly stood at attention and saluted,
and the German sat down on the bunk.
? What are you doing here, Jacobs? ? he asked.
? I thought you were in charge to-night? ?
? Yah, sir, but de poy call me when passing to
tell me dot he vill gif up his secret.?
?Ah ! I suppose he knows that we have his
comrades now. It will be better for you to tell,
Robertson, for unless I am able to take command
of things soon the men will get beyond me, and
there is no saying what they might do.?
? Don?t you give anything away, young man,?
advised Mr. Collins. ? I haven?t had the pleasure
of meeting you before, but I believe we are both
prisoners on this ship. Collins is my name
Obadiah Z. Collins. That was my yacht that
came alongside a little ago ; but my friend?s


pirates took her from me, or, rather, me from
her.?
Please do not consider yourself a prisoner
while I am in command here, Mr. Collins,? said
Hassenrahn ; ? nor you, Robertson. Go about
the ship as you like, but remember, I am fast
losing control of the men, and it might be
wiser if you kept to your cabin as much as pos-
sible. But we?ll soon be at our island, where new
arrangements will be made. Meanwhile good-
Robertson ; we merely called because your
door was open. I am on a tour round the ship to
see if I can find any reason for some improbable
stories current among the men. Keep up a good
supply of power, for we mean to travel fast now.
Come on, Jacobs, and let the boy get to bed.?
But Jacobs had already departed, and without
further talk the other two also left the room, none
of them apparently noticing that Robertson had
not spoken a word. He was thinking, and wonder-
what the men would say in the morning when
they found a score of their comrades missing. He
had, while speaking to Jacobs, formed the notion
a second time that he and Hassenrahn were one
and the same ; but of course the presence of both
together dispelled that idea, and he was now sorely
puzzled to account for several things that had
come under his notice. Truly the mysteries on
board the Lucifer were getting more involved than
ever.
He threw himself upon the bed and slept until
Wun Lung?s arrival next morning. The Celestial
had passed the night in prayer, so he informed
Robertson, but his joss had paid but little attention
to him, probably because his pins had been too
22


338 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
short. Robertson gave him some more nails and
a hammer, and, with hope renewed, Wun Lung
went off to try his joss again. The weather was
now very hot, and it was easily evident to Robert-
son that they had crossed into the tropics. During
the day Jacobs came to his cabin and told him
that every night an attempt was to be made to
man down the Cosmopolites, explaining that this
scheme was possible because every watch for a
week would be composed of different men, as the
Cosmopolites took turn about on duty, and the
same men would not be called upon again for a
long time.
? We will tackle every watch as it comes on,
Jacobs said, ? and when we dispose of the men
we?ll take their place until the next comes to re-
lieve the first. They will go into the cell too, and
so on until the first day watch, when we?ll rest
and lie low until night again. If there is a general
revolt when they discover they are being manned
down, I shall take steps to ensure suspicion being
thrown upon Hassenrahn himself, but I believe
we?ll get to the island before they realise how
things are going. Every night we?ll dump our
prisoners overboard, and the yacht coming on
behind will pick them up.?
There was something about Jacobs that Robert-
son could not understand. He seemed at times
to be absent-minded, and he had absolutely no
recollection of having already accounted for a good
number of the Cosmopolites. He could not, or
would not, tell how he had taken up the role of
the careless Dutchman, nor did he remember much
about any of the chief events that had transpired
on board. He was now second in command, and


as Hassenrahn, for some reason or other, gave
out that he was very ill, and forced to remain
in his cabin, Jacobs practically acted as Chief.
Thus the days passed. Every night Miss Collins
and Robertson went round on a tour of inspection,
and many a strange scene they witnessed. Men
were struck down wherever they were found, yet,
strangely enough, but little comment was ever
made by their comrades in the morning. Nightly,
too, hiding on the after deck, the two watched the
lights of some vessel even swifter than the Lucifer ,
darting across the ocean like a meteoric flash.
Invariably they first saw the lights on the star-
board quarter, as if the ship had been keeping
abreast all day, just out of sight ; but regularly
at midnight she came up astern ?a dark shadow
in her wake suggesting the presence of yet another
vessel. Many silent battles, but swift and sure,
took place before their eyes, for the men of the
deck watch could not be so easily taken by surprise
as were their comrades on duty in the engine-room
and elsewhere. But the end was always the same :
one of the many patent portable boats with which
the after deck was littered was rigged up, and,
filled with the victims of that night?s work, dropped
into the sea. A signal soon after came from the
ship behind, and then it fell away out of sight
again.
Robertson had informed Miss Collins of all he
had been told by the mysterious Dutchman, and
she in turn had made him aware of some facts she
had discovered. There was one matter, however.
which was completely beyond their powers of com-
prehension. Hassenrahn, after being all day in his
cabin, or, perhaps, having taken only a turn round


the deck with Mr. Collins, for whom he seemed
to have formed a strong attachment, would often
appear at night in rubber-soled shoes and carry
on the system of warfare adopted by Jacobs and
his friends. He was, if anything, more remorse-
less than the other party in the suddenness of his
attack, and he never required to strike twice. Yet
those who remained of the fast dwindling Cos-
mopolites appeared to be sublimely indifferent as
to the fate of those who had disappeared, and
everything went on as usual.
One day the Marquis, who had hardly ever left
his own apartments on the upper deck, informed
Robertson that they had passed into the Tropic
of Cancer, and would soon be at their journey?s
end ; and that afternoon a great mass of dark
brown weeds, stretching as far as the eye could
reach, appeared, growing or floating upon the face
of the ocean. The Lucifer now began to sail in
what appeared to be a most erratic manner, but
an observer might have noticed that whatever way
she turned there was always a strong current flow-
ing with her, and that the weeds in the current
were not nearly so tenacious as those which
flourished around ; that, in fact, they were merely
detached drift-weeds, while those outside the in-
fluence of the current were so tightly massed that
they appeared to be almost solid. The observers ?
and there were at least two on the Lucifer ?would
also have noted that the current along which they
were sailing was describing a large circle, and
that it flowed between masses of weeds exactly the
same as a river between banks.
The Lucifer went ahead at half speed, leaving a
wake which the Marquis informed Robertson would


not be obliterated until a breeze of wind blew some
more detached weeds across the track. Hassen-
rahn, now recovered in health and spirits, was
continually in the steering tower with the Marquis,
for it appeared that the vagaries of the ocean
current they were following through the maze of
weeds were not known to either of them alone.
The Lucifer sailed on, and night fell, but a power-
ful searchlight showed the track even better than
did daylight. The watchers were on deck as usual
that night, but there were none of the scenes to
which they were accustomed, nor did the swift ship
of the night put in an appearance. This fact
worried Robertson, until he discovered that the
entire watch that night was formed of the men he
had seen come from the Lancelot , and whom he
had now grown to recognise as his friends.
When morning came the Lucifer was still forg-
ing ahead, but the world of weeds around had
become much different, and when the morning
sun rose over the ocean desert Robertson could
hardly realise that he was still within the bounds
of the terrestrial hemisphere. They were now
sailing between two banks of living vegetation,
over the top of which swarmed hundreds upon
hundreds of winged creatures such as he had never
dreamt existed on the planet. There were some
like bats, only their wings were much larger, and
some resembled a cross between a lizard and a
grasshopper. These latter had a parachute-like
attachment round their necks, which served to keep
them in the air when once they sprang off the
thicker stems of the vegetation until they found
a new resting-place. There were many other
forms of flying or jumping creatures, but none of
them were known to Robertson.


What struck him most, however, was the sight
of myriads of huge red-eyed rats. These creatures
lined both banks of the stream, and glared savagely
at the Lucifer. At one time it seemed as if they
were going to attack her, but some influence which
Robertson could not guess restrained them, and
they contented themselves with swimming round
inquisitively. One of the men was about to shoot
a gigantic rat, which had shown itself more
daringly than the others, but Hassenrahn saw him,
and, rushing from the tower, knocked up the man?s
arm in time to prevent him. Jacobs also ran
towards the man, but he stopped when he saw
Hassenrahn?s action, and went below.
? What do you mean? ? demanded the German
angrily, as the surprised would-be rat-shooter
turned to him. ? Don?t you remember what hap-
pened before?
?No, sir,? responded the man ; ? eet vas only
a rat, an? he have already live a thousand years.?
? And we would probably not live an hour if
you had shot it,?- roared Hassenrahn. ? That rat
is a leader among the others, and they would
simply eat us if we gave them sufficient excuse to
overcome their natural cowardice. Why, don?t
you remember the fate of the Naronic? 11
? No, sir,? again replied the man in surprise.
?I no remember nothing.?
? That failing seems to have become very
common among the Cosmopolites of late, said
Hassenrahn ; ? I hope the Count will make good
time here. I did not know he had taken so many
men with him. Why, we are almost short-
handed.?
His last remarks were addressed to Mr, Collins,


who had strolled along the deck towards him.
Robertson was standing near, leaning over the
gunwale. He had walked the deck without fear
during the last few days. He had been wondering
why things had been allowed to get so far de-
veloped without an outcry among the men, but
Hassenrahn?s words had suddenly made things
clear. The Cosmopolites were all under the influ-
ence of Valli?s powder, and the ship was entirely
in the hands of the men who had come aboard
from the Lancelot.
And now the weeds parted in front, and the
Lucifer sailed into a lagoon of clear water. A
little island rose straight ahead, its slopes covered
with luxuriant foliage, but not of the weed nature.
It was as if a new world had been entered. The
dank odour of the weeds had given place to the
scent of flowers, and birds of gay plumage flitted
among the tree-tops instead of the horrible winged
creatures of the weeds.
The Lucifer turned a bluff and entered a natural
harbour, and Robertson stared with surprise at
what he saw. The little bay was crowded with
ships of all designs and sizes. He saw a torpedo-
boat destroyer, and two other ships of war. There
were several large vessels of the cargo tramp
variety, two Atlantic liners, and some steam
yachts of most pretentious appearance. All floated
securely at anchor, safe in that well-guarded haven
which had never felt the influence of a storm.
As the Lucifer made her way to the shore, Robert-
son read the names on the bows of the larger
vessels, and shuddered. They were names that
had been only too well known to all interested
in shipping. They were names that had been


posted up at Lloyd?s as ? missing,? and missing
they would remain for ever.
? Well, boy, I guess we?ve got to end our days
in this graveyard, the same as those derelicts,?
remarked Mr, Collins, coming up to Robertson.
I wonder whether these boats came here on that
current themselves, or if they were salved by our
friends after they were caught in the weeds, or
if they were boarded on the high seas and taken
here.?
I don?t suppose we shall ever know, sir. This
truly is an impregnable spot, from which any gang
could levy toll on the Atlantic. Look at that
large house on shore, too, and see what workshops
are behind. Why, anything could be done here,
and the world would never know.?
? Well, I always reckoned that I could pay the
dollars and get out whenever I got tired of the
business, said Mr. Collins, ?but I fear we are
doomed to stay here now. It is my daughter,,
Valeria, I am sorry for. You have never seen her, I
suppose? She is a gem of the first water, sir,
and as plucky a girl as ever lived.?
? Yes, we are great friends,? said Robertson
with a smile ; ?we have known each other since
you came on board. In fact, we are playing in
this game, and I expect we shall win.?
? What do you mean, boy? My daughter has
never left her cabin, nor Miss Vanderbilt either for
that part ; and what on earth is the sense in talking
of playing a winning game? ?
?I?H tell you to-night, sir. But look I there
is Hassenrahn just come on deck.?
He never left the deck. I see him on the
bridge now.?


? And I see him just forward of the companion-
way. He seems to be looking for trouble, too.?
? And by Hocky I he?ll get it. There?s two
of him. See ! they meet. Come along, boy, we?re
in for a circus now. Let?s see the fun.?
The two Hassenrahns had advanced to meet each
other, intense surprise in the face of one and an
expression of determination in that of the other.
They met, stood still for a moment, and all on
deck gathered round. With a splash the Lucifer?s
anchor went overboard. Her voyage was ended.


CHAPTER XVI
THE NEW COSMOPOLITES
For fully a minute the two men stared at each
other, but one was smiling as if he enjoyed the
situation.
? Say, you two, are you going to stand there all
day? ? broke in Mr. Collins. ?You can?t both
be Hassenrahns, so why don?t you fight the thing
out and let the best man claim the name? I?ll
see fair play.??
? Who are you, and how dare you masquerade
as you are doing? ? demanded one of the men,
as if determined to accept Mr. Collins? suggestion
to fight the matter out. ? What does this mean? ?
?It means that the long chase is ended, and
that this ship is once more in the hands of its
rightful owner,?? spoke the other. ?It also means
that you have one chance left to save your life
that is, by taking mine.?
? Seize this impostor, men 1 ? cried the first
speaker. ? This is the man who has been prowl-
ing around the ship at night, committing deeds of
violence and making every one believe it was me.
Seize him, and we?ll hang him to our flagpole on
shore. What means this? Is it mutiny? Obey
me, men. Can?t you see that I am the Chief?
346


? Nary a bit,? laughed one. ??You have no
more claim to the title than I have. So far
as we know, there is only one Chief of the
Cosmopolites.?
? Why, you are Perry 1 I thought you were in
prison. Seize him, too, men.?
? Hassenrahn was always a great thinker, went
on the American, who had been standing behind
the others, ? but somehow his thoughts had a habit
of getting off the rails.?
? Have I no men here who will obey me? ?
cried the man, now desperate. lam in com-
mand. Ah 1 you, Dessaix, and you, Marquis,
stand by me.?
?We only take orders from our Chief, sir,?
said the Marquis coldly, and Dessaix signified that
his sentiments were similar.
? Cosmopolites, again I order you to obey me.
I shall call up the whole company, and have all
mutineers severely punished.?
?You haven?t any men to call up,? said one of
the men ; ? and we are not Cosmopolites. These
people, excepting two, have all left the ship.?
? Left the ship ! Are you mad, or am I? ? The
German stared wildly around. His double mean-
while had remained standing, silent and almost
expressionless. Finally the German turned to him
fiercely. ? Well,? he said, ?if my men refuse to
obey me, I shall have to attend to you myself.?
? That?s the ticket 1 ? cried some one ; ? we?ll
follow the best man.?
? Hold on a bit ! ? cried Mr. Collins, producing
a couple of revolvers. ? Mutiny is an ugly thing,
even among pirates, and my weight is going on
the side of the boss. Come, now, which of you
two is the real Hassenrahn? ?


I am the Chief of the Cosmopolites,? said he
who had been doing all the talking. ?You, Mr.
Collins, know it, and so must all the men. This
man is some impostor. I alone am Chief.?
? \ou lie, Hassenrahn. I never resigned.? The
speaker was the other man.
? Who are you? ? shouted Hassenrahn, noting a
change m the voice, which seemed to remind him
�, t , e P ast most vividly. He peered into the
other s face eagerly.
? / am the Chief! � With a movement of the
hand the speaker pulled off his moustache, his
mobile face assumed its natural expression, and
he stood revealed.
The men around were silent.
The German staggered back. ? Impossible ! ?
he gasped. "lam going mad. Valli must have
ncked me. Jacobs 1 where is Jacobs? Ah !
. 1 him to command. lam ill.? He reeled
mto the arms of Mr. Collins, but continued to
stare m affright at the man whose place he had
tilled so long.
?A N l�? Y? 1 . 1 * has not tricked you, Hassenrahn,?
said the Chief, ? and you are not mad. Oh, it
is I right enough. Look well at me. As for your
Jacobs, he is at present in prison at Cape Town
or was when I last heard of him. I have had the
honour of acting in his stead of late as your able
second in command.?
?What! You are Jacobs?? The German
gasped out the words.
Was, Hassenrahn. lam now the Chief. The
c ase is ended, as I said, and nothing now remains
but the reckoning between you and me. Stand up
and let us finish it man to man. Give him some
brandy, Jones.?


?No, I want no brandy. I can meet my fate as
a German and a Cosmopolite.? Hassenrahn stood
erect. He had regained his coolness. ? Chief,?
he said, ? you have won. How you have managed
I do not know, but I recognise the fact. What
has happened? Where are the Cosmopolites, and
where is old Macpherson? Tell me, and then let
the end come.?
? The whole thing is simple enough, Hassen-
rahn. You and I were rivals. I was Chief of
the band of men known as the Cosmopolites, and
you were one of my lieutenants. Seeing that the
natural tendency of the men under me was to
evil, and fearful of what the result might be if
their brains were devoted to law-breaking pur-
suits, I ordered their disbandment. You, however,
saw your chance, and led the mutiny against me,
but, along with my dear friend Mac, I escaped,
taking with me the secret of the power which gave
the Lucifer her great speed. We then set about
building a ship to chase the Lucifer, and, notwith-
standing your dastardly attempts on our lives,
through Valli and others, we succeeded. Mean-
while this young man here had been working along
the lines Macpherson had gone over previously,
and as a result re-invented the same suction-gas
accelerating process. You found this out and kid-
napped him, but you left his two comrades behind,
who, although helpless and alone, without money or
friends, became the nucleus of the organisation
which has brought about your downfall. They
joined me, and we chased you to the Cape. There
your men made another attack upon me ?at least,
they supposed it was me ?but I had already taken
the liberty of impersonating one of your chief men,


and so even took part in the assault on my deputy.
I then took up Jacobs?s place on board this ship,
and began to man down the crew, impersonating
you when I thought it worth while, and sometimes
some of the others when it suited me. I soon
found my old friend Perry, and together we made
war upon the Cosmopolites, although it was really
I whom you so nearly caught that night. Who
shot you I now know, although I was as much
puzzled as you for a long time. That shot was a
fortunate piece of work for us, as it disabled you
and gave me, as Jacobs, a free hand. Soon I got
into touch with the yacht you stole, through the
medium of that radio-wave transmitter some of
the Cosmopolites invented, and then I got some of
my own men on board the Lucifer to help in the
manning-down process. Now you alone are left,
and with you will end the Cosmopolites.?
? Kismet ! ? spoke Hassenrahn quietly. ? But
that yacht will soon be here, and it carries a large
crew of the Cosmopolites.?
? Yes, but they are in chains. I forgot to say
that that yacht?s mission was discovered by this
gentleman?s two comrades, how I do not know ;
but at all events, and to cut the story short, my
men recaptured it, and it has been following us
much closer than you ever imagined, towed by
the Nemesis, the ship we built to run you out of
the water.?
??Do you mean to say, sir, that the Lancelot is
in the hands of honest men? ? asked Mr. Collins.
?It is. It will be restored to you before many
hours have passed. These gentlemen you see
around you just now were chiefly instrumental in
bringing about her recapture.?


? No, sir. May I get the yellow jack again if
I allow that honour to go past Mr. Macpherson,
put in one of the men. ?He asphyxiated the
whole mob of the beggars, and we only went
for those who took their gruel standing up.
?Ha I they fought then? They did not give up
the ship without a fight? ? Hassenrahn s voice
was eager.
? Not by any means,? answered another man.
? They fought well, and might have captured us
but for Mr. Macpherson?s strange way of fighting.?
? I might have known that that man would
devise the means of our downfall,? said Hassen-
rahn, half-admiringly. ?This young inventor is
his son, is he not? He is just such another as
the Scot I once knew so well.?
? Yes, he is his son. Valli?s confounded drug
was responsible for his father?s adopting the name
of Macpherson,? answered the Chief ; ? but we
can?t complain since it also placed the Cosmopo-
lites themselves, an easy prey, into our hands.?
? Tell me one thing more and I am ready,?
said the German. ?Why did you not proclaim
yourself earlier, seeing that you had practically
possession of the ship? ?
? Because Valli?s drug had also influenced me
so that I did not know where this island was.
After I had interviewed that person, however, in
his cabin ?he thought I was you, by the way ?my
memory became clear, but I knew I could not take
the ship through the channel, as it was known only
to you and the Marquis. Therefore we waited
until you had brought the Lucifer to her anchor-
age ; the other vessels can easily follow in our
wake.?


I see. I have been a fool as well as some
other things. Ah, well, Chief, you have come in
strong at the finish,? said Hassenrahn with a
smile. ? I don?t wish you to think well of me,
but I half believe I am glad. I am ready. As
a Cosmopolite I have lived, and as a Cosmopolite
I will die. Proceed.?
?Very well. I will give you equal chances,
and my men know my wishes if I should go under.
You shall be taken to New York and landed
safely,?
What do you mean? Why prolong the agony
now? Go ahead with the funeral.?
? He?s giving you a chance to fight for your
life, man, don?t you see? ? cried Mr. Collins. ?If
you sail in you might win. Get up your pluck and
make a good fight.?
?? Are you really giving me a chance for my life,
Chief? ? asked Hassenrahn.
I am, equal chances. See, I have no weapons.
Throw your revolver away, and we?ll settle our
differences for ever with the means Nature gave
us.?
? I thank you for your offer. Chief, but I am too
lazy and indifferent to take the trouble to fight for
my life ; besides, it is really not worth fighting for.
Here is my revolver. Kindly blow my brains out
at once, or make some of your men do it.?
? We are n ot murderers, Hassenrahn. You must
fight with me.?
? And I refuse. Man, do you think I have not
done enough harm? Shoot me now, or throw me
to the sharks. lam tired of life. My nerves are
gone. I am crippled. My brain is failing me.
Never since that night off the Scottish coast when


I led the mutiny against you have I known what
a night?s sleep is, and I look forward to a peace-
ful oblivion where the storms of life shall not
trouble. Shoot I ?
? Hassenrahn,? said the Chief, ? you are not a
success as a bad man. You are hysterical ?
? Ah ! you mean that I am trying to play on
your sympathy?that I know you will not kill
me in cold blood? Chief, you wrong me. I
shall save you even that unpleasantness. Man is
master of his fate. I shall dare mine with my
own hand.? He raised his revolver to his head,
but quick as a flash Jones sprang upon him and
wrenched it from his grasp.
? That is not in the Chief?s programme, old
man,? he said ; ? but you have my sympathy all
the same. Many a time I felt like doing that trick
myself when the whole planet was against me.?
? Let me go, man,? cried the German ; ? you
have taken from me my only way No, I will
fight, that will be just the same. Are you ready,
Chief? I am coming.? Without another word he
flung himself upon the Chief, and the onlookers
held their breath. The suddenness of the onslaught
was not expected, and the Chief might be taken
unprepared.
But he was not. He caught the German in his
arms and lifted him off his feet. The latter did
not struggle, and the Chief rested him on the deck
again. ? No, Hassenrahn, it won?t do,? he said.
? It would just be murder if I were to kill a man
who won?t defend himself.?
?Go on,? cried the other. ? Why do you not
proceed? Take your revenge now.?
? Look here, sir,? interrupted Mr. Collins
23


addressing the Chief, ? I don?t like this cat-and-
mouse business, I am a millionaire many times
over. I will buy this man?s life if it costs me
every dollar in my possession. He?s played a
game and lost, but he?s not crying over it, and,
anyhow, he has suffered as much as you.?
?Mr. Collins,? said the Chief, ? Hassenrahn
needs no one to buy his life. He is a brave
man and worthy to be a chief of the Cosmopolites.
Right here I will call things square between us.
The world is big enough for us both, and we can
resume our quest as honourable rivals. Hassen-
rahn, we will forget what has passed since that
night, as, thanks to Valli, all the other Cosmo-
polites have done. Let a curtain drop over our
memories from then until now. As Chief of the
Cosmopolites I request you, my lieutenant, to take
these men on shore and show them our stores of
plunder. We shall afterwards take everything on
board our several ships, make a fair divide, and
sail away.?
Hassenrahn?s face underwent a great number
of changes, but suddenly it brightened. ? Your
orders shall be attended to, Chief,? he said,
saluting, and from those around arose a great
cheer.
All was now excitement, and a petrol launch
was lowered into the water, manned, and under
Hassenrahn?s guidance made for the shore. Then
the Chief turned to Robertson, who with Mr.
Collins and some others had remained on deck,
? Well, James,? he said, ? we have played leading
parts in a strange drama. How everything worked
out you will know from your father and your
two comrades. They are coming through the


channel now. Believe me, when I was acting as
Jacobs my mind was so hazy that I could not tell
you more than I did. Of course, I soon saw that
you scarcely needed help, and that if I contented
myself with manning the Cosmopolites down, you
could look after yourself. Your tube, too, served
me many a good turn, and but for the holes
which you bored into the chief cabins, it is possible
that I could not have succeeded in trapping the
leading men at an early stage. I have promised
your father that you would be restored to him,
but it means a sad blow to me all the same.
Henceforth you will be enabled to go on inventing
with every appliance at your command, and your
father, the cleverest engineer that ever lived, to
help you. But, I, the lonely Chief of the Cosmo-
polites, am still doomed to wander over the face
of the earth seeking But why should I trouble
you with my story? This ship is yours now. Run
and tell your lady friend that she no longer re-
quires to explore by gas tube. Take her on shore
and show her everything. The island belongs to
your father and myself by right of discovery ?
Do you refer to my daughter, sir, when you
talk of a young lady? ? asked Mr. Collins, much
surprised.
?Your ward, I think, sir,? answered the Chief.
? She and our young friend had a scheme of their
own in hand by which they meant to do great
things. And I believe they would have done so
had I not been successful. But come, Marquis,
Perry, Dessaix, and Jones. We have much work
before us ?
? Sir,? cried Robertson excitedly, ? you have
been working for me, for which I cannot thank


.356 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
you enough just now. But my scheme was almost
entirely in the interests of the man called the
Chief ; it has not yet reached its climax, and even
yet its results may mean much. Please give me
leave to do as I like for half an hour.
? Certainly, my lad. Do absolutely as you wish.
We are going below to take an inventory of the
ship for profit-dividing purposes. The original
Cosmopolites will be fairly dealt with
But Robertson had rushed off, and next minute
he burst into Miss Collins?s cabin. Come !
he cried ; ? the end has been reached. Get ready
and come on shore with me. I want to talk to
you on the subject we know. Bring Miss Vander-
bilt too ; her part will soon be ready.?
? We are ready, Mr. Robertson,? answered Miss
Collins. ?We saw most of what happened on deck
from the cabin above yours, and have been wait-
ing on you. We knew you would come.
Half an hour later the two ladies and Robertson
stood upon the summit of the island. They had
been talking all the time, and everything was now
clear to them. Another grand surprise was in
store for the Chief of the Cosmopolites and his
lieutenant.
They were looking over the derelict-strewn
waste on the other side of the island. Here ap-
parently was no current, and the sight was one
which conveyed more knowledge of the world?s
history, its pioneers, and their great endeavours
than volumes could have done.
Dotted here and there among the dense dark
brown vegetation were the remnants of ships of
all ages. High-castellated poops of ancient
Spanish galleons were there, their fore parts buried


straight down in the water, while long, clinging
weeds reached their tendrils all over the still float-
ing parts. Robertson did not know what dates
the various styles of ships represented, but Miss
Vanderbilt was well versed in ancient history, and
pointed out remnants of vessels which must have
drifted to this stagnant living zone long before the
Portuguese had rounded the Cape. Masts stuck
up through the weeds promiscuously, and parts of
vessels which at one time must have been sailed
by the Vikings of Norway were also gripped tightly
in folds from which they could only escape by
decomposition. Even galleys of Rome and
Carthage were there, silent but eloquent tributes
to the shipbuilders of those great empires ; and
among them lay vessels of most modern construc-
tion, almost intact, with funnels and masts stand-
ing, and in one case with men at the various posts
of duty. But they were dead men, and would not
long remain in shape, for thousands of enormous
ferocious rats roamed everywhere, fighting with
the flying creatures for the spoils which the cruel
sea had given them.
Great armies of these creatures moved over the
surface of the weeds looking for prey. Some-
times a large shark would burst through from
underneath on similar purpose bent, and then
would ensue a battle as weird as it was fierce.
This part of the sea was evidently the very heart
of the Sargasso, a living backwater, through which
no currents were in motion. The scene was one
of utter desolation, and at length the watchers
turned away their heads.
It is strange how this island lies in the very
heart of this awful place,? said Miss Vanderbilt.


? One would have thought, too, that the weeds
would have overgrown it as well as the water.?
? There must be a current originating near the
island which keeps the weeds away,? Robertson
explained. ? Probably it bursts through from
waters under the earth and encircles the island
with water charged with some element which
renders its bridging impossible to those weeds and
the creatures which have their home among them.?
? But the island itself is as fair to look upon as
any South Sea beauty spot,? said Miss Collins.
? See the foliage and fruits which abound. I
suppose those vines and orange-groves must have
been planted by the Cosmopolites? And look
down there at that pretty bungalow. Our friends
were real artists.?
? They had in their ranks the cleverest men in
the world,? said Robertson. ? And if they had
kept straight under the Chief they would have
astonished the world with their inventions.?
? I am of opinion that a certain Mr. Robertson
will see that the poor world does not come to harm
for lack of invention,? said Miss Collins. ? But
look ! There is the Lancelot coming through that
circling current, and there is a big ship behind
her.?
? Let us get down at once, then,? said Robert-
son. ?My father, whom I have not seen since I
was a boy, is on board one of these vessels, also
my two comrades, Harry Southwood and Bob
Fitzgerald.?
? And you will leave us for two boys now,?
pouted Miss Collins. ??You will have no time to
speak to us.?
? Oh, yes, I will, but you must remember you


are only girls, and men can?t always be bothered
with them. Besides, there are others who will
look after you in future as much as you want.?
The girls laughed at Robertson?s candour.
They now understood him well. They rushed
down the wooded slopes and soon reached their
launch, getting on board the Lucifer just as the
Lancelot drew up alongside.
? There they are,? shouted Robertson. ? Hallo,
Harry and Bob ! I?m here first. When did you
leave Glasgow? ?
The two ships were lashed together, and with
a bound Harry and Bob cleared the rails and
rushed to the comrade they had chased over twelve
thousand miles.
? We?ve got you at last,? they shouted, as they
flung themselves upon him in delight. ? Oh, Jim,
what a time we?ve had ! But we didn?t know
you had ladies with you.? They drew back,
colouring ; they had not noticed the girls before.
Robertson hastily effected introductions, and
then tongues wagged as if the world?s history had
to be told in five minutes.
? But how did you find out I was here? ? at
length Robertson asked. ? I was afraid that you
would give up the chase at Cape Town in disgust
when you received the forged letter and agree-
ment.?
? Why, Jim, that is what enabled us to trace
you,? answered Southwood. ?We found out what
ship brought the document and followed it, for,
don?t you remember yourself, it was Fitzgerald
who wrote out the copy of our Articles of Associa-
tion which you had. I have the copy you wrote.
We captured that ship, and the Nemesis went


360 THE SECRET OF THE SARGASSO
ahead in big sweeping curves until she picked
up the ship on which you were a prisoner. She
disguised herself, of course, but we knew all about
that dodge by this time. The Chief ?oh, you
never met the Chief ? ?
? Oh, yes, I have, at Oban first, and every day
this last week. But my father? Is it true that
he is with you? ?
? Ay, laddie, it is,? spoke a man who had come
forward unperceived. ?I am your father, but ma
story canna be telt in a few words. I am proud o
ye, laddie, an? ?
? And I am of you, father,? cried the boy,
rushing into his arms. ? I have heard all about
you, and no one knows your accelerating secret
but ourselves and the Chief.?
?Haven?t you a word to say to us, Mr. Mac-
pherson? ? put in Miss Collins. ?We used to
be great friends, but I did not know that Robertson
was your son.?
The Scot gazed at the girls in astonishment.
? What ! lassies,? he cried, ? you here? I didna
ken ?
? The Lancelot is my father?s ship,? said Miss
Collins. ?We were captured by the Cosmo-
polites.?
? Your father?s ship ! I thought?l thought
But, there, I?m mixed up, lassies. I ken ye both
brawly, but my memory is?well, no what it used
to be, an? I dinna ken which is which o? ye, but
I?m glad to see ye, an? to think that the Chief ?
? Hush, Mac, that is still a secret,? said Miss
Collins. ?The denouement is still to come.?
? Come and see the fastest ship afloat,? put in
Southwood. ?We can all explain to each other


when we?re alone, but the Nemesis is entitled to
first attention, and her men are all anxious to see
who they have been chasing.?
? Ay, gang awa,? you young folk,? said Mac.
I?ll see the Chief an? come after ye.?
? Please don?t mention us to him,? pleaded Miss
Collins, as they descended into the launch with the
boys, and Mac, wondering vaguely what mystery
lay underneath her words, promised to obey her
wishes.
The next hour was spent on the Nemesis , partly
in talking to Captain Thomson and Mr. Bell and
some of the others, and partly in exploring its
wonders.
? I don?t like this ship half as well as the
Lucifer ? said Miss Collins to Robertson, as they
stood in the engine-room. ??lt has no gas tubes
and no mixing chambers.?
? No,? said Southwood, ? its speed is derived
from another patent. No one knew the secret of
Jim?s discovery, and we had to fit the gas producers
direct to the engines. But we can sail thirty
knots and keep it up, and if there is any other
vessel in the world that can do that I?ll eat it.?
??How about the new British torpedo-boat de-
stroyers, Harry? ? asked Robertson. ? I thought
they could touch thirty-four odd knots? ?
? Yes, but they can?t keep it up. They can only
run that speed for a three hours? stretch, and then
they?ve got to slow to get up the steam pressure
again. And, anyhow, if we put your patent in this
ship, she?ll likely work up to thirty-six or more
??lt is time we were back on the Lucifer
observed Miss Vanderbilt anxiously. ? I fear
something may yet happen if we are not there.?


? Remember your promise to allow me to
manage the business,? said Robertson. ? We?ll
go back now, but you must hide in one of the
deck cabins until I give you the signal.?
? What is all this, Jim? Is there more trouble? ?
asked Fitzgerald. ?If there is we?d better take
our guns.?
? There will be no trouble, Bob,? laughed his
comrade, ? but the last scene of the play has still
to come.?
A few minutes later they were on the Lucifer's
deck once more, where most of the men had now
assembled at the command of the Chief. Hassen-
rahn was also there, silent and gloomy, yet withal
now the Chief?s faithful lieutenant. Robertson
contrived to get the girls into a deck cabin un-
noticed, and then with his comrades joined the
others. Mac was by the Chief?s side, a happy
light in his eyes, and Captain Thomson, Mr. Bell,
Jones, and the rest of the men stood near.
? Gentlemen,? the Chief was saying, ? I pro-
mised you good pay for your work, and I find that
that is a modest way of putting the matter. There
is a far larger quantity of gold and silver in the
stores of the Cosmopolites than I had imagined.
These men, whatever they are now, were once true
to their Chief, and justly earned their share in
profits. I propose to give it to them, as I wish
to deal fairly, and I expect they have now no re-
collection of their misdeeds. But to you, gentle-
men, who have so faithfully fought for my interests
I give my share as Chief?s, for I am already in
possession of more wealth than I require.?
? If I have a share, Chief, I would like to give
it to the gentlemen, too,? said Hassenrahn. ?I,


too, am wealthy, although I can never return to
Germany.?
? Oh, if it comes to giving away dollars, I guess
I?ll pay my original ransom down right now,
interposed Mr. Collins. ? I owe that much, any-
how, for the recapture of the Lancelot."
? Hallo ! ? ejaculated Jones, staring at the last-
named ship, ? the prisoners have got loose. Come
on, boys, we?re in for trouble now.?
It certainly seemed so, for the Cosmopolites
were now pouring out on the decks of the Lance-
lot, led by a man whom at first it was difficult
to recognise as Valli, the Greek. The men made
to leap on board the yacht after Jones, but the
Chief?s voice rang out ordering them to stand
still, and wonderingly they paused.
? Cosmopolites,? shouted the Chief, ? form for
parade inspection,? and instantly every man formed
into line and stood at attention.
? But they will rush us next minute,? cried
Hassenrahn ; ? allow me to speak to them, Chief,
they will obey me.?
? They will obey their Chief, Hassenrahn, be-
cause of the original ideas of that person instilled
into them, but they have forgotten all about you
and the episode of the last seven months. Valli
has drugged them all.?
? But he hasn?t drugged himself,? shouted
Robertson, ? and I know what he is after.?
Valli had leaped the rails, and before the men
on the Lucifer had realised his intention, had run
along to the after deck.
? Follow me, Cosmopolites ! ? he was shouting.
? I vill victory to you lead.?
The Chief?s revolver spoke out, and Valli


stumbled, face forward, on the deck, but he was
on his feet in a minute, and plunged down the aft
companion way. Like a flash Robertson was after
him, for the idea had come to him that Valli was
looking for the bottle containing his second dis-
covery. He was right. Valli had broken into
his cabin, which, now left unguarded, offered but
little resistance. The doubly bottled drug lay
where Robertson had first thrown it, but with the
instinct of a desperate man Valli went straight to
it and had got clear of the cabin before Robertson
arrived.
Rushing along the alley-way, and through the
engine-room, he gained the main deck access stairs,
and next moment burst out a few yards from the
astonished men, the deadly bottle raised high in
his hands.
? Eet ees now Valli?s turn,? he cried melo-
dramatically. ? I haf here ze, not only death, but
ze madness of you all. Fools ! you thought to beat
Valli, ze Greek. No man lives who can do zat.
Ha, ha ! you tremble now. Shoot if you like,
but I drow zis bottle and it make you all mad.?
All stood spellbound ; but Valli?s love of the
dramatic was fatal to him, for, just as he con-
cluded, Robertson sprang upon him from behind,
and with an effort of all his strength pitched the
Greek headlong against the vessel?s side. The
bottle broke as he fell, and the men rushed forward
to secure him. But Robertson knew what the inner
bottle contained.
? Stand back, men ! ? he cried. ? The gas in
those bottles is deadly. It rises vertically. Keep
clear ! ?
The men stopped, and Valli arose slowly.


? ? HA ! ? HE CRIED, ? I AM MAD ?MAD ! ? ?
To face page 364.]




?Ha ! ? he cried, ? I am mad ?mad ! And eet
ees vith my own discovary. But I am not afraid.
Ha, ha ! I vill go and make ze sharks mad, too.?
Before any one could move to stop him, he had
bounded over the rail into the sea. A flash of
silver-like objects appeared in the water instantly,
and then Valli and his discoveries had gone for
ever.
? It is just as well,?? said the Chief, after a
moment?s silence. ? Only that man had the power
of turning the Cosmopolites into the paths of evil
again. They will now forget for ever the parts
they played, and they will have enough money to
begin life anew in any land they choose. It is
to be hoped that they will use their brains in
making discoveries calculated for the good of man-
kind. To-morrow we?ll overhaul our ship and
take all the treasure on board, and then we?ll sail
for some port where we can put them on shore.
Mr. Collins, your ship is your own again, and your
own old crew, or most of them, are on board. They
will be set free at once. Hassenrahn, you can go
with Mr. Collins on his yacht. We are rivals still,
and I ask no promise from you, but we?ll fight
fairly ?
?My Chief, I ?l cannot answer you,? said Has-
senrahn brokenly ; ? I will give her up to you.
Who am I that I should dare to come between
you and the girl of your choice? ?
? No, no, Hassenrahn, our chances are equal.
Her friend told me ?
? Chief,? cried Robertson, ? will you allow me
to speak? My scheme has reached its climax.?
? Well, lad, what is it? ? asked the Chief kindly.
? What is the climax? ?


? Only that you two are not rivals at all. You
each met different girls, the daughter and the ward
of Mr. Collins. They agreed to play with each
other?s names for the benefit of fortune-hunters,
with the result that complications arose, and you
two made a great mistake.?
? What do you mean, laddie? ? spoke Mac. ? I
guessed something like what you are saying long
ago.?
? Here are the ladies themselves, father. It
is their story to me I have told.?
? Miss Collins ! ? cried the Chief in amazement,
? you here? Where did you come from? ?
? Ask Mr. Robertson, Sir Robert. He has been
looking after me while you were masquerading.
Allow me to introduce Sir Robert Howard, father.?
? But this is Miss Collins,? cried Hassenrahn,
staring at Miss Vanderbilt.
?Not a bit of it, Frederick. I only made you
believe that for a joke,? replied that young lady.
? But when did you come on this ship, Valeria? ?
asked the Chief, a new light in his eyes. ? I
never saw you.?
? Oh, yes, you did ; but you spent all your time
as a Mr. Jacobs, speaking to Miss Vanderbilt when
you were not knocking down Cosmopolites.?
? But you? ? cried Hassenrahn to Miss Vander-
bilt, ? I never saw you on board? ?
?No, because you always asked for Miss
Collins, and she was always indisposed or crawling
through some horrible gas-pipe. But are you two
men not going to shake hands? If not, Mr.
Robertson will take us away again. He can easily
act as cavalier to both of us.?
? Shade of George Washington I ? ejaculated


Mr. Collins, as the Chief, Hassenrahn, and the
two girls looked from one to the other in dumb,
slowly comprehending surprise. ? Are there any
more acts in this play? Where do I come in, I
would like to know? ?
? I guess, you?ll have to come in to give your
blessing, old man,? laughed Perry. ? And I am
real sorry, too, for it means the breaking up of
our band.?
? But not of our new association,? cried young
Robertson. ?We will form ourselves into a syndi-
cate on the lines of the one Harry, Bob, and I
are members of. My father will be manager,
our Chief president, and between us all we?ll bring
out inventions which will keep Britain in the fore-
front of the world?s progress.?
??And America, young man,? added Mr.
Collins. ?What harm have the stars and stripes
done? ?
? After all, Hassenrahn,? said the Chief, ? I
think we?ll make it a Cosmopolite affair. Let
the good of the world be our object. With wealth,
and men like those around us, much can be done.?
The two men advanced to each other with out-
stretched hands.
? Children of the world we shall remain, Chief,
to the end,? said Hassenrahn, and their handgrip
was one such as only true men give.
? Mac, you terrible old Scot, won?t you give
your hand? ? said the Chief.
? And yours, boy,? added Hassenrahn. ? You
are a worthy son of your father ?
? Come along, Perry, Dessaix, Marquis, and Mr.
Collins. We?ll pick up Signor Antonio and one
or two of the others of the old band later,? cried


the Chief- ? And you, Captain Thomson, Mr.
Bell, Jones, South wood, Fitzgerald, and all the rest
of you, come and sign on with a handgrip.?
A great cheer greeted his words, and then Wun
Lung?s gong summoned all to dinner on board the
Lancelot.
Thus was re-formed the band now known
throughout the world as the Cosmopolites.
