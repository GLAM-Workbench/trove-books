after Twenty years.
CHAPTER I.
?Love took Tip the harp of life, and smote on all
its chords with might;
Smote the chord of Self, which, trembling, passed
in music out of sight.?
E WERE camped within ten miles of the
Murray?my mates, of whom there were
five, and myself?on the Christmas Eve
of ?B6. live of us had originally started
from Melbourne to enjoy a three-weeks?
experience of tent-life in the bush, and on
our first night in camp we had been joined
by an old bushman known, he informed
us, as ? Ugly Tom.? We wondered why
he was thus nicknamed, for he was
anything but a homely-loeking fellow,
though he was a bushman ; but to please him we had
always addressed him by his nom de plume.
A positive rule in our camp was, that we should take it
in turn nightly to spin a yarn, and on this occasion Ugly
Tom was to perform, .
We all joined in urging him to commence, and finally
he arose, threw a log or two on the fire, and spoke in
his soft, smooth tones, as follows:
Well, mates, you often say I?m sad, and doubtless
wonder why. I?m about to tell you??tis a story of a
Christmas time just twenty years ago ; a story of the
truest heart that ever beat, and how its owner died.


? The hero of my story is an old travelling companion
named Frank Hodell. He was a native of Wales, an
Englishman by education, and a Colonial in his light and
joyous heart. Many are the scrapes in which we have
been together implicated; many the bright moments I
have spent in listening to his gay and happy chat; many
the air castles we have built in our ambitious hours. Castles
that have faded, chats that we shall have no more, and
scrapes wherein I?d give my life to be implicated now.
?Together we started on our wanderings ; together we
have faced misfortune, danger and death; and together
we at last fell in love with the fair-haired, blue-eyed
darling that proved the greatest blessing in my life, and
the cause of the ending of his.
?It was at a mutual friend?s house at St. Kilda where
we first met the object of our love, one evening in the
August of ?66. We had arrived rather late, and on enter-
ing the drawing room, the full, mellow tones of a voice,
the equal of which we had never heard before, reached
our ears, and as we listened to the music of that sweet old
song, ? In the Gloaming ? 1 experienced a sensation which
was to me entirely new. ?Twas the ? one touch of nature,?
and I felt that from that moment my soul was linked with
that of the singer?s as long as eternity should last.
? As we listened to the rendering of that song, so full of
pathos and of sadness, I thought that to be in Heaven with
the possessor of that voice, and hear its music ever, would
be a reward sufficient to repay one for the long, long years
of misery spent on earth.
? At length the song was ended and I glanced at Frank,
Though the music had ceased and the vocalist had left the
piano, he continued to gaze on her as though he were
bewitched, and ?twas only when the well-deserved applause
had ceased, and the hum of conversation again began,
that he remembered where he was. Even then he followed
her with his eyes, and I could see that he, like myself,
was impatient to be introduced to her. This little cere-
mony was shortly afterwards performed by our hostess, Mrs.
Grampion, and Frank and I became acquainted with Miss
Bertha Plant, the lady for whom we had both already
conceived symptoms of a deep and lasting regard.


? During the rest of the evening Frank was continually
by her side. He entirely monopolised her, I thought, and
for the first time in my life I was jealous of him. The
lady, too, appeared to prefer his company, and I, after a
time, retired.
?Later, when bidding him ?good-bye,? she rewarded
him for his evening?s devotion with a smile that made me
almost angry with envy.
? But he was happy then ! He had found a prize that
was indeed worth the winning, and with the whole of his
energy he had determined to carry off the trophy of her
love.
? ?Twas his first ?flutter ?round the flame of love,? and
when, later, we had separated from the company, he seemed
to have left his very soul behind him. Always light-hearted
and gay as he was, his laughter during our ride home
that night appeared to me unreal, so hysterical was it in
his joy ,
? Dear old friend ! So inexperienced in the ways of
? lovely woman.?
?Judginghim to be a gentleman, as every line and
feature in his pleasant smiling face proved him to be. Miss
Plant had, while in his company, thrown aside her usual
reserve, and treated him with a cordiality that was merely
the natural outcome of her generous nature. This he had,
with a lover?s egotism, construed as the budding reciprocity
of his passion. Perhaps he was right 1
? And I, mates ! Well?yes, I loved her too. Loved
her from the moment I heard the thrilling tones of that
sweet silvery voice, and I loved with a depth of [ assion too
strong?far too strong ?to be described by mere words.?
The narrator paused, and, gazing at the fire in a manner
that showed us his mind had leaped back over that great
gulf of Time?a leap of twenty years?he heaved a sigh,
and then went sadly on :
? Yes?Bertha Plant?my angel darling Bertha, was
our mutual love. We had hardly beheld her sunny face
when a cause for strife arose ?tween Frank and me, and
our life?s, our soul's happiness, became centred in an
object the attainment of which was possible to only one.


? Bosom friends and inseparable companions as we were,
we never met Miss Plant except when in each other?s
company, and neither of us could jealously blame her ?even
in our hearts ?for her behaviour towards the other. Yainly
did we both endeavour to win from her some secret sign of
her preference for our individual selves, and vainly did we
strive to hide the fact that she possessed our individual
hearts.
? Weeks passed on, and the cordial feeling we had en-
tertained for each other prevented the all-important
question being asked ?the one being afraid of robbing the
other of the woman he loved, and thereby depriving him
of all that yet remained of happiness and joy. We had
both arrived at the Spring-tide of our lives, Frank being
in his 25th year, while I was two years younger. He had
never been in love, and his nature was too true, his sense
of honour far toe loyal, and his great big heart too pure to
deal lightly with a woman?s sacred feelings.
? And so arrived December with its happy Christmas
tide.
? Christmas! That brought baek to both of us our first
meeting years ago when we were laughing, bright-eyed
happy boys. Christmas! That we had always spent in
company, and chosen as the day of all days for the renewal
of our sworn and lifelong friendship. Christmas ! Our
first one in "Victoria for many weary years, spent in distant,
burning, tropic climes. But now a Christmas had arrived
when we could not shake each other by the hand and know
that we were staunch friends still. No ! The love of a
woman stood between us, and for that love we would fight
to the bitter end.
? We had fathomed each other?s secret, and for weeks
past, though still companions, we were not friends, and on
this sunny Christmas morn, for the first time in our lives,
we failed to seek each other?s company The feeling in my
heart was not as it should ha\ e been at such a season, and
since I could not wish him well I resolved that I would not
wish him ill.
? And then, as I meditated, the memories of old times
began to crowd upon me. How he had always helped me
through my hardest tasks at school ; how he had always


done his best to console me in some boyish trouble ; bow
we had wandered together, year after year, and I had ever
found in him a friend so staunch and true.
? And was I now to regard him as my enemy because he
loved a being that to behold meant to love ? No ! Not
though the loss of her were to make life unworthy the
living ! Not though to lose her meant the wrenching of
this heart into a thousand shreds. Thoygh I should bury
all hope of happiness in the grave with my love, he should
have her, and we would be friends still. He should be
happy, and /?well?l would try and be happy, too?happy
in the possession of their friendship, and the knowledge
that I had proved true to him when tried.
?Yes! I would seek him out; do that which I had
resolved to do, wish him ? A Merry Christmas,? and spend
the day in his company. Then, on the morrow, I would
bid him ? good-bye,? and seek oblivion in the wilds of this
great bush.
? I immediately sought his room, but discovered that he
was absent.
? At first I thought he had gone down to the beach to
bathe, and wondered that he went alone.
? I waited an hour, and yet he returned not.
? Thinking it possible he had been sleeping when first I
knocked, I again sought his apartment.
? Receiving no reply to my summons, I turned the handle
of the door and walked in.
? But picture my astonishment when, on entering the
room, I found it almost empty. The bed had not been
slept in, his trunks had been taken away, the sketches?
works of his own ?with which the walls were generally
adorned, had all been removed, and on the table I found
the following note ;
? Dear old Chum, ??Tis Christmas Eve?almost Christmas morn-
ing, and lam writing this to bid you a long farewell. I am going
once more to the tropics to try and forget that I ever loved ? Our
Bert,? and this time I must go alone. This evening?a sad Christmas
Eve for me ?I proposed to her, and learned she loved another. Had
that other been any one but you, the world would not be large enough
for both of us. But you, old friend, to know that you are happy will
lighten this sad heart of part of its burden of sorrow. I received that


assurance from her lips, that ?twas you and none other that she loved.
Be happy, boy, and the knowledge that you are so will be one gleam
of sunshine to me through the lonely life that I shall henceforth lead.
And now, farewell! But when years hence the sunlight of bonnie
Australia casts its rays across your path some happy Christmas morn,
give one kind thought to your lonely old travelling mate, and know
that he would have given worlds to be your old chum still.?
Frank.?
? And he had gone!
? Tied away as I was about to place the golden cup of
happiness in his bands. Vanished from amongst us with-
out a word as to the land ho intended to make his home,
and without leaving one clue to guide me in the search I
had already determined to make I was grieved?yes, e?en
to the sickness of sorrow ?to think that, through me, the
one love of his life had been wrecked. He had relinquished
all hope of a future on earth, and his one consolation was
that I should be the one to profit by his loss.
? But Bertha had told him she loved another, and that
I was the fortunate possessor of her love. And so, perhaps,
?twere better for himself that he had gone?for the present,
at least, that the acute agony of his wound might to some
extent decrease, and his sufferings be mitigated by that
healer of all troubles?Old Father Time.
? And then, in the far-away future he would come back*
and we? Bertha and I?would make the old boy happy*
and we would end our lives in peace, and take a longer
journey together ?by-and-bye?than any we had taken
yet.
? ?Twas of no use seeking for him then, I thought; he
would let me know his whereabouts all in good time.
? That night I would declare my love to Bertha, and
should the news contained in Frank?s note be supported by
her answer, we would be married at once, and, if he failed
to write, we would seek him together ?Bertha and I.?


CHAPTER 11.
? The deaf and frantic fire,
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavour,
Now?now to sit, or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.?? Poe.
?Ugly Tom? paused, and indulged in a pannikin of'
tea; then, casting an envious glance at the five tobacco
furnaces in full blast around him, he gulped down his
desire for a whiff, and continued :
? The Christmas sun of ?66 had set in all its glory, and
the short semi-tropical twilight had given place to the light
of our grand Australian moon.
? I had alighted from the railway car at the St. Kilda
station about a quarter to nine, and, having jumped into a
hansom, was about to be driven to the residence of the
Plants, when I observed a commotion in the street, and
calling to the cabby asked the cause.
? ?A fire, sir, I think,? he replied, ? and a fine one, too,
judging by the glare,?
? ?ln which direction? ? I asked, feeling anxious, with-
out knowing why.
? ?lt seems away over in the direction where I was
driving you, sir ; at all events, it?s not far from there !?
??Well, drive to the spot as quickly as you can!? I
ordered, in an excited tone, and in a few moments we were
present at the fire.
? And my worst fears were confirmed.
? ?Twas Sertha?s home that was in flames, and the
spectators had already become so numerous that it was-
impossible for the vehicle to approach within a hundred
yards of the burning building, so I alighted and ran as-
quickly as a pair of nimble legs could carry me.


? But the crowd was so dense that in a few moments
my progress was checked, and for a time I was compelled
i o view the conflagration from a distance.
? It was indeed a conflagration !
? The whole of the back portion of the house was one
mass of roaring, leaping flames, and the front part was
beginning to ignite at the basement just as I arrived upon
the scene.
? The flames flew upward with a rapidity and force that
r gave little promise of succour arriving in time, though the
brigades were momentarily expected.
? A fearful fear was meanwhile tugging at my heart!
? What if Bertha were in that hell of flame?
?Look out!? roared a number of the crowd, and up
dashed the engine.
?As the crowd fell back to leave a passage for the fire-
fighters, I snatched at the opportunity, and, jumping up
behind, was taken closer to the burning building.
? And still that alarming thought disturbed my mind ;
pressed upon me with a weight that caused me to search
every corner and crevice in that hurricane of hell with the
fear of seeing the face of her I loved.
? Great God, mates! There she is! I see her even now !
I see her as she stood just twenty years ago!
? There, at one of the windows of the second storey?the
lower portion raised ?stood my darling, waving frantically
and hysterically, those alabaster arms.
? And even as I looked, the flames burst?with a long,
low, sullen roar?through the window at which she was
standing, and that lovely head, with its wavy mass of curly,
golden hair, cowered down to the very sill.
? And still I stood aghast!
? Stood as though bound down to the ground with the
iron chains of terror. v
?But I was aroused by the prompt action of a man
<with more presence of mind than I.
? A man who had seen the danger my love was in.


?He had thrown off his coat and vest, procured a
ladder, and was then about to proceed to the aid of that
angel in distress
? With one tremendous ringing cheer, the crowd showed
their appreciation of his pluck.
? A cheer that went ringing and booming from end to
end of the multitude, and was returned again and again.
? It awoke me from my lethargy, and in another second
I was at that hero?s heels.
? What deafening cheers burst round us as we made
?our way upwards to the one black spot in that mass of
angry, roaring, leaping flames.
? But picture our horror when we found that the ladder
was nine feet short of reaching the window.
? ? Come up,? roared the stranger, in a fearfully excited
voice. ? Come tip, and while I cling to the ivy, lift me
till I reach the window.?
??l did so, and with his bare hands he clutched the
?smoking branches of the creeper.
? He crawled, as it were, upon the wall until his fingers
reached the window ledge above him.
? The crowd were hushed ! But the fearful flames roared
?on in haste, and made all things distinguishable by their
lurid glare.
? Myriads and myriads of sparks flew upward, and then
went out as if with anger at being separated from the fierce
?destruction going on below.
?Not a sound was heard from that sea of souls as my
?companion in danger grasped the window-ledge.
?A silence prevailed that betokened the tremendous excite-
ment and suspense that was being felt by each one of that
vast multitude.
? With a strength that must have been born of despair,
ihe drew himself up !
? Up!
? Eight up till his feet were on the ledge, and then he
?disappeared from view.


? Frantic with fear for my Bertha. I stood on the top
rung of the ladder and waited.
? Waited for moments that in my fearful excitement
seemed like years.
? And then he appeared again.
?Oh Heavens ! What a roaring, screaming, deafening
cheer burst forth.
? A thunder-like cheer that made the crowd below appear
like a legion of madmen, so wildly did they behave.
?For there stood my mate at the window, handing
Bertha down to me.
? ? Take her ! ? he roared, in his thrilling tones, ? Again
I give her to you.?
? And as I took her, the cheers continued long and loud*
? So loud, indeed, that they seemed to have burst the
Heavens themselves in twain, and caused the clouds to lend
their aid to stay this work of sin.
? For the water began to patter around us- the first few
drops of that flood from the engine which, in a few
moments more, had drenched the spot where that hero stood,,
handing Bertha down to me.
? Grasping her with my right arm, with my left hand I
held the ladder, and began the comparatively easy descent*
?? The multitude was frantic in its joy.
? Cheer after cheer pealed forth again and again, and
for a moment lulling would burst forth a fresh in one long
tremendous roar, till it rivalled in its volume Heaven?s
grand artillery.
? And still the flames roared on !
? Burning with a greater vengeance now as if with rage-
at being disappointed of their prey.
? But with my loved one I safely reached the ground�
and left her in the care of loving friends.
? I then turned to aid her deliverer, whom I had left at
the window, nine feet from the top of the ladder, when ?
? * Crash !
? Without a moment?s warning the roof had fallen in.


? ? Good God ! He?s lost! ? I screamed in agony, as the
fact at once burst upon me that the falling of the roof had
ended every chance of the saving of his life.
? The cheering ended with an abruptness that evidenced
the thrill of horror that had pervaded each one of the
spectators.
? And as if delighted at the fearful work it had accom-
plished, the fire burst forth anew, and seemed to burn, if
possible, fiercer and fiercer still.
? Flame after flame leaped up as if each were flaunting
its own triumph to the sky, and claiming credit there !
? Thousands and thousands of sparks burst forth, and
lent their united aid to add a grander terror to the scene.
?And then another crash! and the walls had gone,
followed the roof into that abyss of destruction, and the
end was accomplished.
? ?Twas of no use then attempting to quench the flames,
and for a time they continued to wave their jeering heads
with triumph at their deed.
?But by-and-bye they burnt less fiercely, and soon all
that was left of the once handsome residence of Alfred
Plant, Esq., were the chimneys of the dwelling and a
smouldering pile of rubbish.
? ? I waited till the crowd had dispersed, which they did
slowly, and when the last one turned on his homeward way,
the ruin was complete.
? And there I stood ! Sick at heart and bowed down
with sorrow at the loss of a friend who had yielded up his
life and love to me ! His time had come in the sunny morn-
ing of his days, and he had almost voluntarily obeyed God?s
imperial summons. He had bade me ? good-bye ? without
one farewell pressure of the hand ; almost without a word to
let me know I had not robbed him of his love. That grand
and noble form was now a heap of ashes, and that brow,
which a proud father?s hands had fondled and a loving
mother?s lips had kissed, was now adorned by Heaven?s
golden crown.
? Farewell, old friend! No more we?ll roam across old
Mother Ocean, and on a good ship?s deck draw plans for


sport together by-anAbye. No more I?ll wander with you,
o?er mountain and through glen, and know that I have-
still a fiend who would yield to me his very life and love.
The ?few more years? are rolling slowly on, and I hope I
soon shall meet you ?you and Bertha, hand-in-hand ?to
welcome me to Heaven?s rest and peace.?
-X x- X- ?a- X X- X- X- X-
And with a quiver of the lip and a heart-drawn sigh,
Tom bent his head and wept; wept at tfe thought of a
friend he had los: more than twenty years ago.
With the exception of an impulsive motion? repressed,
apparently, by an effort ?on the part of one of our com-
panions, Harry Blair, a respectful silence for the old man?s
grief was kept.
After the lapse of a few moments, Blair arose, and poking
the fire with a stick, thereby creating a blaze, remarked :
? A sad story, Tom. But I knew your hero well! ?
? You did ! ? exclaimed ? Ugly Tom,? jumping up in a
perfect passion of excitement, and dashing the tears from
his wrinkled and weatherbeaten face. ? Give me your
hand. Poor Frank! If you had known him a lifetime
you could have known nothing against him.?
? That?s a matter of opinion,? icplied Blair. ?Of course
you mean Frank Hodell, the chap known by the nickname
of ? The Artist.?
?That?s him! What have you to say about him ? ?
and the old man?s hands clenched, and his face became
whiter as he approached nearer to Blair.
? Well, you?ve described him as something like an
embryo angel, and as long as I knew him there was more
bad than good in him.?
?You lie, you hound ! Eetract, or take a bullet in your
thinking-pan ! ?
Four of us rushed simultaneously towards ? Ugly Tom,?
who had drawn his revolver, fully loaded.
We reached him and knocked the barrel up ?just in
time, for their was a report, and a bullet went humming
unpleasantly close head.


? Ha, ha, ha ! ? laughed Blair, approaching Tom, at the-
same time throwing off his coat, opening his shirt, and
displaying his right shoulder, bare to the skin. ?Do
you recognise the scar left by a Fijian spear ??
? W hat !? thundered Ugly Tom. throwing the four of us
aside like so many nine-pins. ? You are Frank Hodell!?
and he dragged Blair hurriedly into the bright glow of
the fire, and looked deeply into the unflinching dark brown
eyes.
?It is! It is !? he cried, frantically shaking the other?s
hand. ? And I have camped with you so long and didn?t
guess. But why didn't you tell me before ??
? Well, old friend,? replied the newly-discovered Frank,
heartily returning the other?s hand-grip, ? the Tom Bates
of yore is hidden behind that weather-beaten phiz, and
flowing beard, and the boys all called you ? Ugly Tom,?
you know. You didn?t give us your full name, and how
could I guess that you were my old chum ??
? Well, well,? returned Tom, with a smile that lightened
up the hearty, happy old face, ? ?tis twenty years ago to-
night since last we met, and I have spent nineteen unhappy
Christmas Days. Thank God, the cloud has vanished like
a dream, and together we?ll spend a happy one at last.?
# # # # A* # a* �
?Twas even so ! The friends of childhood had met once
more after the separation of a lifetime.
From the explanations which were a'terwards made the
writer learned the following facts ; ?Six months after the
supposed death of his friend, Tom had been married to his
Bertha, who only lived to brighten her husband?s life and
lighten the burden of his sorrow for one short year, when
she was called away to take her place above.
But Frank, at the time of the falling of the roof had
been warned by the crashing of the rafters overhead, and
had, by the aid of ivy, managed to reach the ground
ere the great catastrophe occurred. Knowing that his
friends were safe, he stole away unperceived, while the
crowd imagined he had been engulfed in that sepulchre of
flame. He had since spent his life in travel, but, feeling a


strong yearning to visit home once more after an absence
of twenty years, he did so under an assumed name. He
had heard of Bertha?s death, and the knowledge of this
event had entirely changed his plans. He had intended
to remain incog , but now he determined to find his old
companion, and accordingly endeavoured to discover Tom?s
whereabouts ; but, owing to the latter?s absence from his
old haunts, he had failed to do so.
The Christmas Day of ?B6 was indeed a happy one for
those two friends, who had met once more after their long
separation, and ere the new year dawned they had left us,
and had sought again the glad scenes of their boyhood,
where, let us hope, they found in their close bond of friend-
ship that happiness so long deferred.
Tiie End.
