BY DAY THE VOICES CLASH WITH COLOURS
NOTHING YET RECALLS
THE HARSH AND BLINDING BRIGHTNESS. THE NIGHT
REVEALS ARCTUS AND TAURUS IN THE HEAVENS,
SCORPIO AND THE WATCHFUL ORION,
AND THE STARS BECOME DECORATIONS,
RIDDLES WHICH GOVERN THE FATE OF MEN,
CALCULATIONS. SO DON’T MISUNDERSTAND
MY SILENCE. I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU
BUT LIKE THE LEAF IN SPRINGTIME,
LIKE THE SKYLARK AT DAWN. I NEED TO STUDY
ANOTHER ALPHABET, TO EXPLAIN
WITH PERPENDICULAR SPEECH THE HEAPS OF PEBBLES
ON THE SHORE OF YOUR SOUL AND THE CONFINES
OF IMAGINATION, WORKED BY THE TIDES OF TIME
TO THE PERFECTION OF PATIENCE.
