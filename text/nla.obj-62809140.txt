FOR A
LECTURE
NEW SOUTH WALES
History.
New South Wales is the oldest State of the Australian Common-
wealth. At Botany Bay, a large and beautiful inlet on the eastern
coast of Australia, a few miles south of the site of Sydney, the
commercial capital of the Commonwealth, and one of the most
beautifully-situated cities of the world, Captain Cook first planted
the British flag on Australian soil in 1770. In 1769, Cook, in the
British warship ? Endeavour,? was despatched to the South Seas to
observe the transit of Venus; but he was also commissioned to ascer-
tain ? whether the unexplored part of the Southern Hemisphere be
only an immense mass of water, or contain another continent.?
Having completed the first part of his mission, he set out across
the Pacific from Tahiti in search of the eastern coast of the great
continent, and dropped anchor in Botany Bay on 28th April of
the year named. This visit did not constitute the original discovery
of Australia. The existence of a ? Great Southern Continent ? was
the subject of much speculation from very early times. Far back
in the ages there was a tradition current in India and China of a
vast island, to which birds of passage migrated, and off the coasts
of which the Malay Islanders-were accustomed to catch strange fishes
and monsters of the deep; and these tales, in course of time, found
their way to Europe, being disseminated, doubtless, in the first
instance, by Greek soldiers who had accompanied the expedition of
Alexander the Great to India. Allusions to this ? terra Australis ?
are found in Strabo (b.c. 50), Pliny (a.d. 77), and Ptolemy (a.d.
* 55050


150). Even supposing the modern theories relating to the Icelandic
or Viking discovery of America were correct, Australia was thus
known to the civilised world at an earlier date than the great west-
ern continent. The question as to who were the first white men
actually to set foot on the shores of the continent is at present
enshrouded in mystery; but it seems fairly clear that by the year
1540 both the Spaniards and the Portuguese had reached the coasts
of the mainland and New Guinea, the former from the East and
the latter from the West. It was not until eighteen years after
Captain Cook?s visit that Britain began the colonisation of
Australia.
In 1788, Captain Phillip, the first Governor of Australia, landed
and formed a settlement at Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, the site of
the City of Sydney, the present capital.
From small beginnings great things have sprung. In a little over
a century, Australia has been peopled, and has attained a leading
position among Great Britain?s colonies. In many ways Australia
is remarkable; in one respect it is unique among nations. It is
the only continent in the world occupied by a people belonging to
one race, speaking one language, fired by the same impulses, hopes,
and ambitions, and from corner to corner of the vast territory
within the girdle of the encompassing oceans indissolubly united
under a common Government ?the freest, most democratic, and
most easily conformable to the popular will known on earth.
Australia was settled from New South Wales. New South Wales
is the parent State, and it is the queen of a group of marvellously
progressive and wealthy countries. Queensland, South Australia,
and West Australia have all more extensive territories than the
parent State, but, rich as all sections of Australia are, New South
Wales leads in wealth, trade, and industrial activity. Australia is
known throughout the world, first, perhaps, on account of the
fabulous richness of its many gold and other mineral fields; and
next, because of the incomparable quality of its merino wool. The
bulk of this wool, and the finest, comes from New South Wales,
where the vast unending sheep runs stretch across the great
luxuriant western plains into the rim of the setting sun.
Area.
New South Wales lies almost entirely between the 29th and 37th
parallels of south latitude, and between the 141 st and 154 th
meridians of east longitude. On the north it is bounded by Queens-
land; on the south by Victoria; on the east by the Pacific Ocean;
and on the west by South Australia. From Point Danger on the
north to Cape Howe on the south, the length of the State is about
680 miles, and its breadth east and west along the 29th parallel


measures 760 miles. A diagonal line from the south-west corner
to Point Danger would cover 850 miles, the area of the State being
198,848,000 acres, equal to 310,700 square miles, or over two and a
half times the extent of Great Britain and Ireland.
Population.
The population is a little over a million and a half, of which
half a million is located in the capital.
Divisions.
The territory of New South Wales is divided into several fairly
well defined areas. The vast cordillera of the Great Dividing Range
extending along the coast line, northward in Queensland and south-
ward into Victoria, at a distance of from 30 to 150 miles from the
sea, and the coastal district, between the mountains and the Pacific
Ocean, comprise about 22,355,000 acres of country, watered by
many rivers. This is the home of the great dairying industry.
Beyond the mountains lie the northern, central, and southern
tableland districts; 25,831,000 acres in extent, and embracing
some of the richest agricultural land in the State. From the
plateau great slopes descend westward. The north-western slopes,
the western plains in the centre, and 'the Riverina district in the
south, aggregate approximately 70,079,000 acres, devoted chiefly
to the growing of wool and wheat. The vast sweeping plains of
the far west, which make up the western division of the State,
exceed 80,360,000 acres in extent, and are devoted chiefly to the
raising of merino sheep.
In the coastal and highland districts and on the western slopes
of the hills are some fine towns. Sydney, the capital of the State,
is acknowledged to be one of the finest cities in the world. Here
is a high state of civilisation, and all the modern comforts, re-
creations, and amusements of the Old World are to be obtained.
Sydney is the largest and most important city in Australasia, and
it attracts visitors and tourists from all other parts of the conti-
nent, while the people of the inland districts of the State fre-
quently journey to the capital on holiday. A splendid railway
system, running into over 3,500 miles of road, with a fast and
commodious service and cheap rates, makes the visit an easily
obtained and pleasureable tr.ip. Newcastle, the coal port, about
100 miles north of Sydney, is also a fine town, and is growing fast
in size and importance. Prominent North Coast towns are Graf-
ton, Lismore, and Kempsey, Maitland in the Hunter Valley,
Tamworth, Armidale, and Glen Innes on the northern highlands,
and Inverell in the far north, are all typical Australian country


towns surrounded by growing and prosperous districts. Other
towns which may be mentioned as prominent are Bathurst, at the
threshold of the Western Plains, and Orange on a range of hills
further west. Wagga is the centre of the southern wheat .fields, and
Kiama, Nowra, Moruya, Bega, and Eden are the chief centres of
population on the South Coast.
Social Conditions
The social life in New South Wales is easy going, and free from
restrictions. The people are hospitable, open-hearted, and live
much in the open air, amusements of all kinds being much in
vogue. Sport has a strong hold on the popular imagination. The
hotels in the big towns are good, and the rates are extremely
reasonable. The theatres in Sydney are first-class, and some of
the world?s best artists from time to time appear in them ?from
Bernhardt and Melba to the leading lights of the English and
American vaudeville stage. Practically the whole population of
New South Wales is descended from inhabitants of the United
Kingdom who have emigrated in the course of the last century.
The State is especially fortunate in having no coloured problem to
deal with. Of the aboriginal natives whom the first settlers found
in possession there are now fewer than 4,000, and the race is
dwindling yearly. The number of Chinese, by far the greatest
foreign element in our midst, reaches about 10,000, but the num-
bers are gradually decreasing. All adult British subjects who
have resided in the State for twelve months, women as well as
men, are entitled to vote at State elections, and every State elector
may vote at Commonwealth elections. No man has more than one
vote. In religious belief, nearly half the population are mem-
bers of the Church of England, one-quarter are Roman Catholics,
while the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches each claim one-
tenth, There is no Church establishment, but all denominations
have splendid places of worship rigb'. through the country. The
people are essentially a law-abiding class; order is well and
easily kept; the police are incorruptible, and the judiciary uphold
the best traditions of the British Bench. The law of the land is
practically the common law of England, with, in addition, a num-
ber of statutes an advanced democratic stamp, having for their
object the amelioration of the working classes. One of the most
notable of these acts is that which compels all shops within the
metropolitan area to close daily at 6 p.m., with the exception of
one day in the week, when they are required to close at 10 p.m.,
and one day at 1 p.m., giving a weekly half-holiday. Wages are
good, and the cost of living compared with that in other lands is
fairly low. Even the poorest families eat meat once or twice a


day, and there is scarcely any real poverty. No man is so poor
and so lacking of opportunity, but, if he have sufficient grit, he
may not lift himself out of the ruck of labourers into a position
of comparative ease and comfort.
Education.
New South Wales has a liberal State-controlled system of educa-
tion. It is compulsory and it is free. There is a network of
schools?more than 3,000 in number ?extending right through the
country in every direction. All children between the ages of six
and fourteen must attend a State or private school, or receive in-
struction. In the country districts centralised schools are estab-
lished, to which children are conveyed in suitable vehicles free of
charge. School children are also allowed to travel free by rail to
the school nearest their home. The teaching in the State schools
is strictly non-sectarian, general religious instruction ?as distin-
guished from dogmatic theology ?is given, but this is not con-
nected with any particular religious organisation. The secular
instruction course aims at a broad, general education, with a
special direction of the knowledge and training of the pupils
towards the class of employment they are likely to enter after
leaving school.
The cadets of the Public Schools of the State receive special mili-
tary training and instruction in the art of rifle shooting. The
training, discipline, and bearing of the cadets has been spoken of
in the highest terms by distinguished visitors from many quarters,
including H.R.H. the Prince of Wales.
Technical Education has a great hold in the State, and the
Government have devoted much attention to it. Colleges have been
established at Sydney, Albury, Bathurst, Goulburn, Newcastle,
Maitland, Broken Hill, and branch schools and classes at numerous
suburban country centres.
The Sydney University graduates rank equally with those of
British Universities. The University is also recognised by Charter
as one of the institutions in connection with the London Univer-
sity from which certificates of having pursued a due course of
instruction may be received with a view to admission to degrees.
The University contains four Faculties ?Arts, Law, Medicine, and
Science. Its degree of Bachelor of Laws is recognised, under cer-
tain conditions, as a qualification for admission to the Bar.
Numerous scholarships and bursaries are awarded annually to
deserving students to enable them to complete their secondary
education at the Superior Public Schools, Grammar, or High
Schools. Bursaries enabling students to proceed to the University
courses are also awarded.


By the means afforded through this liberal scheme of scholar-
ships, the doors of the University and of the learned professions
are thrown open to all clever boys and girls, whose parents might
not otherwise be able to help them on their road to success.
Government.
The British Parliamentary system of Government prevails in
Australia. The King is represented in New South Wales by the
Governor. The State Governor?s executive powers are exercised
on the advice of his responsible Ministers. He is empowered to
summon, prorogue, and dissolve Parliament, which is composed of
two Houses?the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly.
The Legislative Council, or Upper House, is a permanent body,
non-elective, and its members, at present 57 in number, are ap-
pointed by the Governor tor life. The Legislative Assembly, or
Lower House, is elective, and now consists of 90 members. Each
Assembly endures for three years, unless sooner dissolved. The
leader of the predominant party in the Legislative Assembly and
colleagues chosen by him, are appointed to the Executive Council
by the Governor, and control the great Departments of State.
The whole of the Australian States, each of which has two Houses
of Parliament, were federated in 1901 under ?The Commonwealth
of Australia Constitution Act.? In certain matters the powers of
the Commonwealth or Federal Parliament are exclusive. The King
in the Commonwealth is represented by the Governor-General.
For the purposes of local government the State is subdivided into
134 shires. The Shire Councils are elected by adult owners and
occupiers of ratable property, and they have wide powers. They
control all local services, including the maintenance of parks and
public places, the regulation of traffic and lighting, and the con-
struction and maintenance of streets and wharves. The Councils
also have power to levy for revenue purposes, on the basis of the
unimproved capital value.
To some extent the governing of New South Wales is like run-
ning a huge business. Several business undertakings, such as
the whole of the railway and tramway services, the Metropolitan
Water Supply and Sewerage Scheme, and other kindred matters,
are owned and controlled by the State, so that the Premier occu-
pies a position somewhat similar to that of the president of a
huge corporation. So well are these business undertakings and
the other operations of the Government being conducted that during
the last two years (1907 and 1908) the net earnings from them have
been more than sufficient to pay the interest bill on the whole public
debt borrowed to open up and develop what was absolutely a virgin
territory. Out of these profits on its business undertakings the
State may be said to obtain all its school buildings?numbering


thousands?roads, public buildings of all descriptions, and huge
unreproductive works, such as bridges over rivers, breakwaters,
gaols, and similar constructions.
Progress is the watchword of the Government, and in the season
of unexampled prosperity now being enjoyed by all the industries
of the State some great enterprises have been laid down. One
of these is a mammoth irrigation scheme, which will water an
immense territory in Riverina, and another is a railway to thread
the whole of the fertile North Coast district. A huge tract of
country in the north-west of the State is artesian-water bearing,,
and on sinking a bore almost anywhere in this area a flow varying
from half a million to 3,000,000 gallons per day may be struck.
This basin of artesian water is of inestimable value to the pas-
toralist, as it waters his stock, scours his wool, and is suitable
for irrigation, enabling sheep-owners to grow fodder for use in dry
seasons, and to make gardens in which can be produced all kinds
of flowers, vegetables, and luscious fruits belonging to the temper-
ate and sub-tropical zones.
Fauna and Flora.
The fauna and flora of New South Wales are peculiar for their
mingling of quite modern with .undoubtedly archaic forms.
Amongst animated nature, the marsupials, the platypus, the emus
and cassowaries, and the spiny ant-eater, are of immense import-
ance to the naturalist for the light they throw upon certain fossils
found in European and American secondary strata; and the same
may be said of the eucalypts, zamias, birds-nest ferns, and other
Australian botanical specimens.
A popular impression with those who do not know Australia
well is that the country is overrun with hostile blacks, and that
the venomous snakes constitute a grave danger to the settler.
Nothing could be further from the truth. In New South Wales
there are absolutely no hostile blacks, and the danger from snakes,
if ordinary care is observed, is practically non-existent. A few of
the Australian snakes are venomous, but they are extremely timid,
and if given a chance will quickly get out of the way of anyone
who disturbs them, while they may be killed by anyone who under-
stands them very easily, and without the slightest risk of being
bitten. The number of cases of snake-bite during the year is
infinitesimal.
Tourist Resorts.
New South Wales presents an unrivalled field for the tourist,
holiday-maker, and health-seeker. No country in the world offers
to the traveller such a wide range of climate, such a wonderful
variation of interesting scenery, or such a w r ealth of entrancing,


easily accessible waterside resorts as New South Wales. Complete
and rapid changes of air can be easily obtained within the borders
of the State, from the normal temperate climate to the snows of
Kosciusko and the icy waters of the Alpine streams, or to the lazy
warmth of the sub-tropical fringe touching the Queensland border.
With a death-rate of only 10?13 per thousand, it will be readily
recognised that the climate is one of the healthiest in the world, and
already several portions of New South Wales have achieved con-
siderable reputation as health resorts. There are a number of
springs and natural baths in different districts, among others the
thermal spring at Yarrangobilly Caves, and the chalybeate spring
at Mittagong, and the Moree artesian baths, with a temperature of
114 degrees, the latter being credited with the power to cure rheu-
matism, In more than one district trout-fishing equal to that of
Scotland may be obtained, and in many parts of the country there
is splendid shooting. Poets have sung the beauties of Sydney
Harbour, the magnificent estuary of Port Jackson, where the infant
Commonwealth was cradled over a century ago, and which is gener-
ally admitted by travellers to be the finest harbour in the world.
The Blue Mountains, 40 miles west of Sydney, present some extraor-
dinarily fine scenery in the shape of rugged gorges, profound depths,
immense valleys, waterfalls losing themselves in mist, and views
merging into indefinable distance. In these mountains are situated
the Jenolan Caves, said to be the finest wonder caverns in the world.
The caves exist in an extensive limestone belt, in reality an old
Silurian coral reef, in which, in the course of untold ages, under-
ground streams have hollowed out the caverns. The wealth of
stalactites, shawls, and calcite crystals in the caves call up to the
minds of tourists visions of some delightful palaces in fairyland.
There are other caves in the southern portion of the State, situated
in the same limestone belt, at Yarrangobilly, and these may be
viewed in a round trip, which includes a visit to the summit of
Mount Kosciusko, the highest peak in Australia; the snow-fields of
Kiandra, where the Norwegian sports of ski-running and toboggan-
ing and ice skating may be indulged in; and some typical Aus-
tralian coaching. Snow-clad Kosciusko presents the oldest land-
surfaces known to geologists on the globe, and is intensely interest-
ing on this account to the student, while its wild and craggy ridges
dipping steeply to almost fathomless gorges, and its extravagance
of magnificent panoramic views which extend, owing to the clear
Australian atmosphere, for scores of miles in every direction, make
the visit one of surpassing wonder to the most careless tourist. A
feature of interest on this tour is that the traveller may ascend to
the very summit of the snow-clad mountain on horseback. There
is now a magnificent hostelry?the Hotel Kosciusko?erected by
the Government on the slopes of Kosciusko, which brings this unique


resort into line with such famous places as St. Moritz, Aldenboden,
Davos, Platz, and other Alpine centres on the continent. The hotel
stands within the winter snowline, and is up to date in every detail,
and is artificially heated.
There are many of the districts of New South Wales worthy of
inspection by the tourist, among them being the beautiful Illawarra,
where sea, jungle, and mountain meet, and which contains the
world-famed Bulli Pass; the Hawkesbury, known to tourists as the
?Rhine of Australia,? which is quite close to the city of Sydney;
the New England Tableland, with its well-stocked trout streams;
the Nowra-Moss Yale district, with its magnificent gorges and
delightful mountain drives; and the wonderful North Coast, with
the ?first flush of the tropics in its blood,? and with a climate so
marvellous that sugar-cane and English fruits flourish one beside
the other.
Commerce and Shipping.
In 1908 the external trade of the State reached �46,690,000.
If the trade with the other States of the Commonwealth be added
the total swells to more than �78,600,000. The total trade per head
of the population equals nearly �49. With only a little more than
a million and a half people New South Wales has a commerce nearly
as large as Japan with 48 millions. - The imports from oversea in
1908, of which the value amounted to more than �19,800,000,
chiefly comprised wearing apparel, piece goods, machinery, and
other manufactured commodities. The exports of the State are the
raw materials which all the world must have?wool, wheat, metals,
meat, butter, and coal. The value of these exports in 1908 was
nearly �27,000,000. The biggest oversea trade is done with the
United Kingdom. During 1908 the State received from the mother
country nearly �12,000,000 worth of goods, and sent in return
goods valued at �11,600,000.
A vast amount of shipping is naturally required to transport
this great commerce. By virtue of the volume of its shipping trade
Sydney stands next in importance on the list of cities of the British
Empire to London, Liverpool, Cardiff, and Newcastle. During
1908, 6,298,784 tons of shipping entered the ports of the State.
Closer Settlement.
Under the Closer Settlement Act, which provides for the acquisi-
tion of large estates, either by voluntary purchase or compulsory
resumption, the Government are pursuing an active policy. Several
large estates have been so acquired and made available for the small
settler in reasonable areas, and on easy terms. Negotiations are
now proceeding with a view to acquiring other estates, and each
year sees areas previously used as sheep walks come into occupation


by small holders. The process of Government acquisition has in-
duced many holder of large areas to voluntarily release them, and
all over the State, in places where agricultural pursuits can be
profitably carried on, farms in private subdivisions have been and
may be purchased on easy terms.
In order to enable persons who have taken up land to improve
and develop their holdings and to build homes, the Government
makes advances to settlers of amounts ranging from �5O to �2,000.
The interest is 44 or 5 per cent., and terms of repayment easy.
Advances are made upon the security of land purchased either from
the Crown or from private owners.
Great Primary Industries.
It may be safely asserted that New South Wales can produce,
within its own borders, almost everything that is needed for the
sustenance, the comfort, and even the highest luxury of mankind.
This is due no less to its great variety of soils than to its wide range
of climate. The high and regular rainfall of the North Coast dis-
trict?so to 75 inches?operating in combination with the genial
warmth of its mean winter mildness of 58 degrees Fahr., upon the
rich alluvial soils of the Tweed, Brunswick, Richmond, Clarence,
Bellinger, and Macleay Rivers, has produced a luxuriance of vegeta-
tion which may be compared with the jungles of tropical Africa,
Asia, and South America. When this natural wilderness has been
subdued by man, it becomes the home of the sugar-cane, tea, coffee,
cotton, pineapple, mango, and most of the fruits, fibre-plants, and
other economic products of sub-tropical regions. The soils along the
river banks, being the result of the decomposition of the igneous
rocks forming a large proportion of the mountain range that bounds
their watershed, are so rich that they have yielded heavy crops of
sugar-cane, maize, and other exhausting crops, for two generations
without the aid of manures.
In 1908, the value of agricultural products raised in the State
was �7,750,000; of dairying products, �4,400,000 ; and of pastoral,
�18,400,000; and minor industries, �3,150,000; the total pro-
duction being �56,250,000, �14,252,000 being added for the in-
creased value given to raw materials by the processes of manu-
facture.
The undulating country, stretching from the coast to the foot-
hills, varies in quality, according as it is derived from basalt, trap,
granite, schists, or shales, or sandstone; but the great bulk of it
in its natural state, whether scrub or forest, gives valuable timbers
?teak, pine, bean-tree, cedar, rosewood, tallow-wood, and many
others suitable for fencing and building, for street-paving, and for
the finest cabinet work. Both scrub and brush, when cleared, are


soon covered with a pasture of native and exotic grasses so rich and
luxuriant that it has already made the North Coast, which is only
now being settled, a great rival to the South Coast, the oldest dairy-
ing district of New South Wales. This strip is devoted, to a con-
siderable extent, to dairying, although it is only in comparatively
recent years that the dairy-farmers have turned their attention to
the sub-tropical districts of the north. In the South Coast region,
or Illawarra, as the district is called, dairying has been a stable
and profitable industry for sixty years past. Kiama, a well-known
South Coast town on the sea, is the centre of rich basaltic hills,
clothed with rich rye grass and clover pastures, which rarely show
the withering touch of drought or frost. Here there are splendid
cattle, now fixed in type, and famed far and wide throughout
Australia as the Illawarra breed. Further south, towards the
border of the State, are other particularly favoured districts along
the coast. About Moruya and Bodalla, an Englishman, newly
arrived, might easily imagine himself in Devonshire or Cheshire.
The belt next to the coastal strip is the tableland, divided into
three sections?northern, central, and southern. On these high-
lands, agriculture of various forms is carried on, mixed farming,
sheep-raising, and fruit-growing being the chief avenues of in-
dustry. On the northern highlands,' in the vicinity of Armidale,
Glen Innes, and Tarnworth, splendid crops of English fruits of all
varieties are obtained, and barley and other crops suited to the
climate thrive luxuriantly. On the slopes of the highlands and
the plains just beyond are great wheat-fields, which may ultimately
prove to be one of the chief granaries of the world. New South
Wales wheat is a v�ry valuable milling product, and it is grown
more cheaply than in any other country on the earth. At present,
out of a total area of 20,000,000 acres capable in the way of natural
conditions of growing wheat well, only about 3,000,000 acres are
under cultivation; so it will be seen that the New South Wales
wheat industry, as is the case with the dairying?and, indeed, all
other of the State?s industries?is capable of vast expansion. Along
this belt of highlands the raising of fat lambs for the English
market is beginning to engage the attention of the farmers, and
this industry, in conjunction with wheat-growing or other agricul-
tural pursuit, is regarded as one of the sure roads to fortune.
Dairying also, with the almost sure profits attendant, owing to the
inexhaustible market for butter abroad, is spreading west from the
coast and has invaded the highlands at many points, while it is
further making its way to the plains beyond. Between 1898 and
1908 the annual butter output increased from 31,483,000 lb. to
60,041,000 lb., and during the latter year 25,188,000 lb,, valued at
�875,600, was exported. About 5,000,000 lb. of cheese is produced
each year.


Beyond the Western Slopes of the hills exist the vast plains upon
which the countless flocks of merino sheep, grown for their wool,
are grazed. This section of the country is sparsely populated, but
is, nevertheless, extremely valuable in point of production, carry-
ing something in the vicinity of 45,000,000 sheep, and raising for
export each year wool to the value of �15,000,000, besides a quan-
tity of other valuable products of the pastoral industry. Horses
and cattle are also bred ?cattle in limited numbers, but horses
extensively, the horse occupying country on the highlands where
the pasture is rich and the climate genial. The New South Wales
horses are greatly sought after, and largely purchased for army
purposes by India, Japan, and other countries.
New South Wales is rich in minerals. Along the coast at New-
castle and Maitland, north of the capital, and at Bulli, Clifton,
Wollongong, and Mount Kernbla in the south, are important col-
lieries. The coal extends continuously from Singleton on the north
to beyond Wollongong on the south, and from the coast-line on the
east to Lithgow on the west. These deposits constitute one of the
most valuable of the national assets, and must contribute largely
to the future prosperity of the State. At a moderate estimate,
there are 115,346,000,000 tons of coal available for mining in New
South Wales. Vast as are the coal deposits of the State, they pale
into in significance before the fabulous value of the enormous lodes
of silver in the world-famed Broken Hill mines. The total value of
the export from the silver-lead mines of New South Wales for 1908
was �2,160,195. The history of the Broken Hill lode serves to show
how easily fortunes can sometimes be made by persons who possess
no knowledge of mining. The mine was pegged out, and a mineral
lease applied for by a local resident named Charles Rasp, who was
totally without knowledge or experience of mineral deposits, and
who was induced to take it up because he imagined the outcrop to
consist of tin ore. Mr. Rasp was a boundary-rider on the Mount
Gipps pastoral holding, and when he returned to the station at
night, he informed the manager and the other employees of what
he had done, when it was decided that a syndicate should be formed
by seven of them, each person contributing the sum of �7O. There
were fourteen shares in the syndicate, and within six years of the
opening of the silver-mine the market value of each of these shares,
with dividends and bonuses added, was about �1,250,000. Up to
the end of December, 1905, the property originally acquired by
Rasp and his partners had paid over �11,900,000 sterling in divi-
dends, and the prospects of the mines were never better than they
are at present. In addition to coal and silver, there is a great
deal of gold-mining carried on in New South Wales. The search
for gold was at one time pursued by from 30,000 to 40,000 men;


now the number varies between 11,000 and 20,000, and the quan-
tity won reaches the neighbourhood of a million sterling per annum.
Many romantic stories of fortune won in a single day are recounted
of the early digging days, and the famous fields of Bendigo and
Ballarat attracted miners and hardy adventurers from all parts of
the world. The discovery of these fields taking place in the early
fifties, Australia drew from California a great number of adven-
turous Americans, who had worked out the shallow alluvial of ?49
in that State. The value of the mineral production of New South
Wales for the year 1908 was as follows:?Gold, �954,854; silver
and silver-lead, �2,160,195; coal, �3,353,093; copper, �502,812;
tin, �205,447. Other minerals produced included alunite, anti-
mony, bismuth, diamonds, lime, limestone, flux, Portland cement,
marble, molybdenite, opal, platinum, scheelite, and wolfram. Iron
is shortly to be produced from extensive deposits lying about 100
miles to the west of the capital. The total mineral production for
the year was �8,384,149, and the aggregate value of minerals won
in the State up to the end of 1908 is �191,239,821.
In timber, Australia has something which no other country has
as good, and which every other country wants. This is the famous
hardwoods, of which New South Wajes supplies, perhaps, the most
valuable. The hardwoods of New South Wales have achieved a
world-wide reputation, and it is universally admitted that for
street-paving they have no superior. A considerable export trade,
and one of which is capable of great expansion, is already done in
these timbers, although comparatively little has been effected in the
way of making their virtues known to the world. Railway sleepers
of the highest grade are also cut from New South Wales hardwoods,
while New South Wales turpentine piles for wharves or piers have
been found to be in such sound condition on being drawn after
thirty years? service in the water, that they have been used again
in new structures. The New South Wales hardwoods ?ironbark,
grey gum, tallow-wood, grey box, brush box, blackbutt, spotted
gum, red mahogany, woollybutt, blue gum, and turpentine?are
remarkable for the great size of the beams which may be obtained
from them, as well as for the strength and durability of their
wood. Nearly all the hardwoods have a greater strength than the
English oak, and grey ironbark has a resistance considerably
superior to that of teak. Ironbark girders for building have not
only the advantage of great size and strength, but they are, in
addition, almost fireproof. Their use in a building is an almost
certain assurance that no matter how fierce a fire rages, the
exterior walls will remain standing, instead of collapsing, as they
generally do when stayed by steel girders, which, when hot, expand
laterally, and force out the walls.


So far as the manufacturing industries are concerned, the great
coal-fields of New South Wales, lying close to splendid sea-ports,
make it imperative that the State will be the great manufacturing
centre of Australasia. Already the iron trade is being placed on
a thoroughly sound basis, and with iron and coal in abundance,
and a most diversified range of raw materials, natural and pro-
duced, New South Wales must become one of the greatest manu-
facturing countries of the world. In 1908 the value of raw
materials was increased locally by manufacture by �14,252,000.
