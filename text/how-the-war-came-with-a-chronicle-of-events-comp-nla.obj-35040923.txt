PUBLISHER'S NOTE.
In printing this record of the political events which preceded
the Great War, the I.WAV. Press Committee desires it to be
understood that their organisation does not necessarily agree with

publish it?that is, to spread information among the people about
the various forces which brought about the great catastrophy, and
bought press ?has prompted the Industrial Vy orkers 01 the Wbrld
to re-publish the pamphlet.
At some later date we may publish a pamphlet dealing with
the acts of diplomats, the mobilisation of armies, the slaughter

If this pamphlet removes some of the misunderstandings that j
are at present prevalent, it will have justified its publication.

Some people think that it is not only unnecessary but wrong
to discuss impartially how the war came. We do not agree because
we are convinced that unless people have some accurate mtorma-
tion on the point they Will not understand what reforms the peace
should bring with it if this is to be the last of the wars. At the
present moment every apologist for the war finds that he gets
the cheering assent of his audience if he talks about Geiman

causes: books and pamphlets are published puiporfing to give a

the war, but which are only biassed pieces of carefully-selected
information, or do not go nearly far enough back. The country
is being misled. If the hatred thus engendered and the ignorance
thus spread were to end with the war and bear no evil fruits later,
it would not matter so much, because obviously the war must be
finished now, and, whatever may be the rights and the wrongs o

In 1879 Bismarck formed an alliance with Austria. The Russo-
Turkish war had ended, and the Berlin Congress had been held.
Russia was displeased that she had got so little from the war an
blamed Germany, and the racial controversy between Slav and
Teuton was intensified. The Tsar in a letter to the German
Emperor conveyed a thinly-veiled threat of war against Germany
if Germany did not become more servile m supporting Russia s

policy in the Near East.l Bismarck replied by making a treaty
with Austria which the Emperor at once communicated to the
isar, so friendly were they and so pro-Russian was the personal
policy of the Prussian reigning House. In 1882 Italy, angry with
France for outflanking her in Tunis, and desiring to protect her-
self, came in and the Triple Alliance was formed. Made at first for
five years, it was renewed in 1887, 1891, and again in 1902, when
it was agreed to for twelve years.
The essential facts about the Triple Alliance are: the Alliance
was defensive; its origin was in .the Pan-Slav attack upon Teutons
in the Balkans ; later it became a protection against the aggressive
restiveness of France ; however, Germany did not mean to quarrel
with Russia, with which it had a secret treaty; England encouraged
Italy s remaining in because that was convenient for us, for we
then regarded France as our enemy, and when in 1887 the English
Conservative papers agreed that Germany might reasonably vo
through Belgium to attack France,2 and about the same time
secretly guaranteed Italy against an attack from the French
fleets (how quickly the wheel of Fortune turns things upside
down!) it was because we were very anxious that nothing should
happen to the Triple Alliance. We regarded it as a protection to
ourselves and a guarantee of European peace ; and again, when
the renewal of 1891 came, our Government strove to keep Italy in
it and succeeded.!
Then came the balancing Franco-Russian treaty. Our friend-
ship with Germany was the chief reason for France and Russia
foimmg an alliance. In 1890 we made the agreement with Ger-
many which readjusted colonies in Africa and ceded Heligoland.
That friendship was taken by France as hostile to herself, and
when in the same year Germany refused to renew the alliance of
the three Emperors on account of the intrigues of Russia in the
Balkans against Austria, Russia made approaches in in
1891 and the treaty was concluded. The enormous expansions in
Germany of both industry and population since 1871 compelled
her to shape her foreign policy with an eye upon the world and
not on Europe alone. She was subject to the same kind of Internal
pressure which in earlier times led to those great eruptions of
migration which have given us our present national and racial dis-
tiibutions of population. In 1898 she began to build a fleet to
protect her coasts and her commerce, and to add a sea power to
the influence of the Triple Alliance, and as this went on, her
relations with Great Britain cooled. Friction arose in Asia Minor.
Tin key was played off against Russia. Whilst the German people
sought a friendly understanding with Great Britain, the German
diplomatic and military sections came to regard British interests

and policy as hostile, and the German economic school of history
assumed that British industrial interests would bring the two
countries into collision in the -end. This was the time when dip-
lomacy had its opportunity. A blunder or an important move
would make war inevitable. The German foreign policy became
Pan-German; our own Foreign Office came under the control of
anti-German and pro-Russian influences. Both ceased to trust each
other. We allied ourselves with the Franco-Russian camp, and
war became a question of time. This drift is admirably shown in
the chapter on Germany contributed by professor Oncken to the
? ? Cambridge Modern History. '?l
Prince Bulow had since 1897 held the office of Foreign Secretary
(Staatssekretariat des Auswartigen) under the aged Chancellor,
Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe; on October 17, 1900, he succeeded to
the Chancellorship and supreme responsibility for the entire policy
of the empire, taking over the helm with a steady, expert hand. At
every turn he found himself confronted with the necessity of choos-
ing between England and the Dual Alliance, just as, in the seventies,
Bismarck had been obliged to make choice between Russia and
Austria. It seems that, in 1901, he deliberately rejected the advances
of British statesmen in order that Germany might not become ?the
sword of England upon the Continent? and have to bear the brunt
of any Russo-French onslaught. The determination to pursue an
independent course in the end created ill-feeling across the Channel.
Some mistakes there werej during the Boer War the sympathies of
the Germans as of other nations lay with the weaker side ; but at
this crisis the Emperor staked his whole influence, nay, some mea-
sure of his popularity, against the popular feeling, tempered the
bitterness. aroused, and withstood every temptation from any other
quarter. In the long run, however, apprehensions as to the commer-
cial competition and naval preparations of Germany gained the day
in England; indeed, impelled by Chauvinistic sentiment on both
sides, the English nation began to accustom itself to the idea of a
German peril, and finally to join the ranks of those opposed to Ger-
many. After the Anglo-French entente of 1904 and the Algeciras
Conference, a change in the old alliances began which introduced a
new era in international politics; for the moment it looked as if
Germany was to be exposed to the danger of isolation and to a
policy of hemming in (?Einkreisungspolitik?) on the part of her
enemies, led, as was thought, by King Edward VII.
In 1904 we came to an agreement with France which involved
us in the Franco-Russian alliance without our being formally
parties to it; the*Algeciras Conference and the Morocco bargaining
followed, when France and ourselves deliberately threw down the
gauntlet to Germany ;2 in 1907 we became parties to the Anglo-
Russian agreement regarding Persia ?an agreement which we never
enforced, in spite of Russia's disgraceful disregard of dt, owing
to our fear lest we should offend Russia and weaken the Triple
Entente .
Thus Europe became divided into two hostile camps. France

raging public law has been told by Mr. E. D. Morel in ?Morocco in

declarations.


and Russia on the one side, and Germany on the other, recognised
that war was likely and proceeded to prepare for it. We appear
to have been less, careful, except as regards our Navy, though
mainly owing to the revelations of the South African War, the
War Office, under Lord Haldane, did set its house in order and
revolutionise the training and the organisation of the Army. It
is proof of no virtue, but rather of incompetence on the part of
our Ministers when they tell us that they had no idea that war
was coming until it was actually upon them. They are the only
Ministers of any State in either the Triple Alliance or the Triple
Entente who were SO' blind. Thom 1904 onwards European policy
hatched war as a hen hatches her chickens.
If proof is required of a truth so obvious that proof is super-
fluous, we have it in the fact that at the very earliest moment
after the Entente, was made, France, as honest broker, pointed out
to us that it was advisable to discuss plans of military co-operation
in anticipation of a European war (which could only be with
Germany). Sir Edward Grey consented, and without reporting the
fact to the Cabinet, allowed the conversations and agreements to
mature through some years, saying nothing about them (except
to the then Prime Minister, Secretary for War, and Chancellor of
the Exchequer) until the Morocco affair had all but landed us in
war.l
The diplomacy which divided Europe into two camps enor-
mously strengthened the hands of the military section in Germany
and made simple the working out of its designs ; it Increased the
confidence of the same sections in Russia and assured it that when
it chose to fight for its Pan-Slav programme both France and
Great Britain would be behind it; it weakened our influence both
in Asia and Europe, since the maintenance of the Triple Entente
soon became of paramount importance to us because of the Ger-
man menace which it had made inevitable, and also because our
obligations to France compelled us to acquiesce in Russian policy;
it increased armaments and gave every country a justification for
imposing heavier military burdens on its people. In Great Britain
its evil effects were intensified and its issue in war made easier by
the Tariff Reform campaign, during which commercial rivalries were
turned into national enmity. This opens up another group of
causes of the war ?the economic-?but in this pamphlet we are
tracing the downward paths which the diplomatists and politicians
pursued.
Something more must be said about the influence of this
policy of Alliance and Entente in Germany. There, the drift
towards war stimulated in an inordinate degree the military caste.
Russia, France and ourselves prepared for the conflict mainly by
armaments and scares and prejudices on old-fashioned and tradi-

ixv., p. 1812.


tional lines. But in (Germany the preparation was more thorough
and extensive. A brutal mechanical thoroughness is a Prussian
characteristic. Russia is lethargic and corrupt, France is careless
of detail and accepts fussiness for effective action, our authorities
never understood the full danger of the game which they were
playing and which was was being played for them. Germany not
only prepared but extended the activities of militarism. Every
soldier knows that the game of war is made successful by know-
ledge of your enemy?s doings, by demoralising him and by killing
him in multitudes. Big guns and carefully worked-out plans of
campaign were therefore supplemented by elaborate intelligence
departments. Just as in civil organisation the Germans surpassed
their neighbours, so they beat them in military preparations. To-
day this is being used as a proof that Germany meant war more
than Russia or France. But that is not the just conclusion from
the facts. The militarism of all countries is cruel, immoral, un-
scrupulous; German militarism is able as well. That is the only
difference. The Zabern affair is only an extreme and absolute
expression of the military mind of every country in the world.
Every nation has its gang of spies who are mostly blackguards.
The Russian spy dances on the boards of the musci-halls and lives
in grandeur in the West Ends of European capitals. Ger-
many made no innovations tin these respects, except that she did
her work better and more thoroughly than other nations. The
whole system is diabolically criminal, offensively disgusting. But
it is militarism; it is a system. Germany has stripped it of senti-
ment, of humanity, of reticence, and has enthroned it in its appro-
priate savagery and scientific efficiency to kill and paralyse. German
thoroughness carried to a logical and irresistible conclusion the
crimes and the follies practised by every other military power in
Europe. They are all involved in the crime. No one Power can take
up a high moral attitude against any other Power. They can boast
of nothing except a less degree of blackness. 1
? It happened that of the two camps into which the agreement
of 1904 divided Europe, one was controlled by the Pan-Slav spirit
and the other by the Pan-German spirit. This is not to say that
the differentiated military classes of the two countries and their
supporters on the platform and in the Press can be described in
this way. Other distinctions have also been drawn between them.
For instance, it is said that the Entente stands for liberty and the
Alliance for military domination ; the first for sacredness of
treaties and the second for tearing up treaties according to con-
venience. Whoever has followed the events of the past ten years
knows how history has to be twisted and pruned of awkward facts
(for instance, Morocco and Persia treaties and Russian conception
of the civil liberties of her people or the national liberties of Fin-

ain, 5 ? which will shortly be issued.


kind), before the latter propositions can be supported. The former
is the characteristic and decisive feature of the camps which were
dominated by Russia and Germany respectively. The bugles
blew in them to settle the racial quarrels between the Slav and
the Teuton. After they had blown other issues arose, but these
issues?Belgium in particular and national liberty and public law
in general ?had nothing whatever to do with the making of the
war ?though, we hope, the war is to have something to do with the
settling of them.
These quarrels between Slav and Teuton came to a head in
the Balkan States.l In 1912 Russia managed to induce these
States to form a Balkan League, mainly perhaps against Turkey
(and for that purpose it was good), but, so far as Russia was
concerned, definitely against Austria. Up to a certain point
Russia and Austria had agreed to a divided influence in the
Balkans, but Russia subsequently, obedient to the Pan-Slav spirit,
began to elbow Austria out. Austria had unjustly annexed Bosnia-
Herzegovina as a move in this new policy and as a precaution
against Russian intrigue. At the same time Russia was not in a
position to reply, but set about building up a machine through
which she might avenge herself. Of all these States the most use-
ful to Russia was Servia. Both in spirit and position it was the
best for picking a quarrePwith Austria, and so at the end of the
wars Servia was aggrandised by Russia?s favour and began the
peace determined Oat another and a greater conflict should begin.
?I remember well,? writes Miss Durham,2 ?at the close of the
Balkan War, in May, 1913, a yelling pack of Montenegrins at the
parcel post office bawling, 'We, the Serb people, have beaten the
Turk. We are a Power. We shall set Europe on fire.? They claimed
that they had all got Russia supporting them, and stated repeat-
edly that they would begin in Bosnia.? This was repeated to
Miss by army officers, diplomatists and others who
knew what was going on. The Austrian Consul was maltreated at
Prizren so grossly that the secretary to General Vukotitch stated:
?The foulest insults were hurled at him and the flag.
Austria dares not tell or she would be laughed at by all Europe
and forced to declare war.? When that did not produce the
desired quarrel, the Orthodox Catholics, of whom Austria is the
guardian, were told that they would either have to abjure their
faith or suffer death. The threats were carried out. Austria
intervened, and sounded friendly States regarding an ultimatum
bo Servia. This is the ?revelation? made in the Italian Chamber
on the 7th December which has been palmed off on a public that
doss not follow foreign affairs, as something terribly sinister and
as a complete proof that Austria had meant war for some years.

was unjustifiable in its rigour and in the time it gave for an

Let us now trace the course of the negotiations which im-
mediately preceded the outbreak of the war. The murder of the
Archduke took place at Sarajevo on the 28th June, and Austria
presented her Note to Servia on the 23rd July. On that same day
Sir Edward Grey expressed a hope that Austria and Russia would
discuss any differences that might arise ?directly with each other.?

July. The JRussian Ambassador at Vienna says that
Russia will not allow Austria to humiliate Servia,3 Germany takes
tne view that, considering all the circumstances, Austria ought to
be allowed to settle her quarrel with Servia and put an end to
the Servian plots and provocations;! Servia puts herself under the
protection of Russia by a telegram sent to the Tsar by the Crown
PrinceS and also appeals to- Britain to get Austria to modify the
Note; the Russian Foreign Minister has an interview with the
representatives of the Buitish and the French Governments in
St. Petersburg,6 and he, with the French representative urges the
British representative to press his Government to fulfil the
obligations of the Triple Entente and to ?proclaim their solidarity
w?ith France and Russia.?? [This is of the greatest importance as
showing that Russia had no anxiety about negotiations, but was
looking to war, and it must be noted that at the interview the
Russian Foreign Minister said that ?Russian mobilisation would
at any rate have to be carried out,? and the French Ambassador

gave ours to understand that ''France would fulfil all the obligations
entailed by her alliance with Russia if necessity arose.'?] the
German official publication? states that the Russian] Foreign
Minister told the German Ambassador that Russia would not allow
the dispute to be settled between Austria and Servia alone. [Whilst
Sir Edward Grey was trying to localise the dispute, Russia had
made up her mind that it is not to be localised. The German
Ambassador, in Paris syiid that the quarrel must be localised.! His
words were: "The German Government desire urgently the locali-
sation of the dispute because every interfernce of another Power
would, owing to the natural play of alliances, be followed by in-
calculable consequences. "2
Thus the game opened, and no one who studies all the papers
can doubt for a moment but that Russia from the first day moved
for war.]
25 th July. Austria declined to recognise Russia?s right to
interfere in the Servian quarrel; Servia replies to the Austrian
Note in terms which everyone knows; the German Foreign Secre-
tary admits that the Austrian Note was bad, and agrees to Sir
Edward Grey?s suggestion as to the four Powers working in favor
of moderation at Vienna and St. Petersburg, should the relations
between Austria and Russia become threatening ,3, the Russian
Foreign Secretary declines to allow Austria to settle with Servia
alone, because he says Austria is striking at Russia through
Servia, he does not believe Germany w T ants war, but he renews his
appeal to let the world know that we stand in with the Triple
Entente and to take "our stand firmly with France and Russia? ;4
in Paris the German Ambassador explains that his Note of the
previous day w r as not a threat, as the Jingo elements in Paris had
made it out to be; in London Sir Edward Grey tries to get an
extension of time for Servia, and explains that the Austrian
quarrel with Servia does not concern us except in so far as it may
bring in Russia. [The German attitude was that Europe should
not interfere in the Balkan trouble, but that if Russia insisted on
playing a part then Germany would support co-operation between
the four Powers ?England, France, Germany and ItaCy?to effect
a settlement.. This was before Sir Edward Grey made his proposal.
It undoubtedly was a great embarrassment that Sir Edward Grey
would not make his position clear. His uncertainty encouraged the
in Titary sections of Germany, without discouraging Russia, who
was playing a bold and subtle game, being assured of the support
of France and knowing the sympathies of our Foreign Office.
It is of the first importance to note that this day Russian
partial mobilisation began, as it proved by the Tsar?s telegram

to the Kaiser on the 30th, in which it is stated that the military
measures now coming into operation were decided upon five days
ago.?T The evidence which Mr. Price has so patiently collected
in his book makes it perfectly clear that Russia began to mobilise
before Austria. Austria did not mobilise till the 26th.]
26 th July. Germany informs the various countries that Austria
in punishing Servia would annex no territory and appeals to
England and France to use restraining influence on St. Peters-
The Austrian Ambassador in St. Petersburg gives the
same assurance to the Russian Foreign Minister, and the outlook
brightens.3 Russia continues her mobilisation plans, however,
and France and Germany are busy with precautionary preliminaries
Sir Edward Grey makes a proposal that the Ambassadors of
Francs, Germany, and Italy should meet in London together
with him and discuss a settlement, and states ?if the war were
to break out no Power in Europe could take up a detached
attitude.?l . ,
27 th July. In Vienna the Russian and Austrian diplomatists
have a discussions and Germany is accused of haying intrigued
with Austria.6 Austria will not accept any settlement until she
has punished Servia and, with Servian provocation rankling in her
mind, accuses her of bad faith, etc. Germany expresses her opinion
that if Sir Edward Grey's proposal of yesterday is to be effective,
Russia and Austria ought to ask for the Conference. Germany
insists that the differences between Austria and Servia should be
settled by themselves. As regards the Austro-Russian that
is a different matter.7 Germany therefore influences Vienna
directly and persuades her to approach Russia direct.B The
correspondents of the Times, Manchester Guardian and Daily
Chronicle agree that Germany is working for peace. But on this
day Russia once more urges England to back her and bring out
the Entente against the Alliance. At the same time the Russian
Foreign Minister conditionally agrees with Sir Edward Grey's
four Power conference, ?if direct explanations with the Vienna
Cabinet were to prove impossible, ''9 and the Tsar sends a telegram
to the Crown Prince of Servia asking Servia to be reasonable,
but assuring him that ?under no circumstances will Russia
?remain indifferent to the fate of Servia. lb continues
to play her part subordinate to Russia, but accepts Sir Edward
Grey's proposal, whilst the Russian Ambassador in Paris tells
his Government to believe that because Germany is urging France
to restrain Russia her only motive is to break up the Triple
Entente ! The English Admiralty orders the Fleet to remain
concentrated, and Sir Edward Grey shows irritation against Ger-

humiliate Servia.l [This marks a change in British policy. It is
now admitted that Russia is acting reasonably in taking a step
which everyone knew would plunge Europe in war and bung the
Alliance and the Entente into conflict. Sir Edward Grey had
travelled far since he declared on the 3rd August, 1908, that
England would never go to war over a Balkan question. The
Entente had had its influence. We were no longer free. Subsequent
events are little more than a manouevring for position.]
30 th July- Austria, suddenly becomes owing to
German pressure, and is willing to resume conversations in St.
Petersburg.3 But Russia blocks th� way. The Kaiser appeals-to
the Tsar to stop the menace of mobilisation under th� happier
prospects,4 and King George is also asked to intervene. The
pacifists for the moment are in the ascendant. But Russia a
action defeats them. On the morning of this day she agrees to
stop all military preparations if Austria will promise not to
violate Servian sovereignty,s and this is telegraphed to Berlin.
Without waiting for a reply, Russia orders what amounts to an
?absolute and general?? mobilisation in the evening. This last
step is also taken partly against the advice of Sir Edward Grey.B
On this day France moves with Russia and the French Ambas-
sador reminds Sir Edward Grey of the military negotiations' and
the letter which the Cabinet gave him in 1912. It is important
to note that M. Gambon makes it clear that if Germany demands
France?s neutrality in the event of a war with Russia, France
could not agree. Sir Edward Grey takes further steps. He replies
to the German Chancellor?s proposals for British neutrality made
on the 29th, indignantly rejecting them; he urges Germany to
help to keep the peace and offers to effect a new European com-
bination (thus reversing his old policy) ;he practically takes up
the position that we shall protect the French Colonies.9 [The
policy of non-committal and drift was coming to an end. What
Russia had been manoeuvring for since the beginning ?viz., that
th� Entente should come into the field and oppose the Alliance
was coming about.]
31 st. July. Russia and Austria are coming apparently to a
settlement, 10 and conversations are in progress. Austria gives
assurances that she does not desire to infringe the sovereign rights
of Servia, and so accepts Russia?s conditions of peace.H Ger-

The German Chancellor refuses to respect the neutrality of Bel-
gium in the event of war.l [?The long-laid military plans had
to be worked in full if they be worked at all.? 7 That is the
curse of stupid militarism. It never sees beyond its nose, and has
no conception of the working of the finer mechanism of human
nature.] The preliminaries; to German mobilisation are taken, and
the Kaiser makes a final appeal to King George. [The criminal
folly of the German military chiefs in refusing to recast their
military plans (even though these plans had been no secret for
many years and had received the sanction of Conservative opinion
in England as far back as 1887), enabled the whole issues to be con-
fused, and immediately played into the hands of the military and
wai sections of the Entente. Ultimately it brought destruction on
an unoffending people and broke up the Peace Party in England.]
Russia defends her mobilisation to us through our Ambassador*
but the explanations are worthless when tested by published facts.
The Tsar explains to the Kaiser that ho will take no provocative
action, although the action he is taking is as near as no matter a
declaration of war. Germany regards it as such and presents an
ultimatum. Prance agrees to respect Belgian neutrality, military
circumstances making that declaration a mere matter of course.
Sir Edward Grey again declines to ask Russia to stop her mobilsia-
tion,2 though he expresses an opinion that Austria?s mobilisation
was not too great in view of the Servian army of 400,000 men [and
therefore, by implication, that Russia was not justified in using
Austria s action as a justification for her own.] If Germany would
bring forward some proposal making it clear that Austria and
herself were trying to preserve peace, 3 he informs the German
Ambassador, he is willing to tell Russia and France that they should
accept such proposal, but although the conditions seem to have
been fulfilled, nothing happens. Once more an appeal is made
(this time from Prance) to Sir Edward Grey to say definitely what
he is going to do. His uncertainty is jeopardising peace.4 Belgian

mechanical, murderous, military kind, are swept on one side. But
before the pacifists go finally they make one more effort. The
German Ambassador in London begs Sir Edward Grey to say on
what conditions England will remain neutral,! and a misunderstood
telephone message regarding French neutrality is seized upon in
Berlin as an opportunity for localising the war. [ln the House of
Commons on the 27th August, Sir Edward Grey explained, in
answer to a question by Mr. Keir Hardie, that the German
Ambassador?s proposal referred to in the White Paper 123 was not
official and was ?without authority.? That may have been so,
but the documents bear no trace of it. Its opening paragraphs
are patently official, and the statement of the proposal is in no
way differentiated from the other part of the document. If any
injustice has been done to Sir Edward Grey he alone is to blame.
At the time, the House of Commons was not in a frame of mind
to listen to any criticism. Bui- Hben Document 123 is re-discussed
later on, more explanations will be required. As it stands, with
Sir Edward Grey?s House of Commons statement added to it, it is
either a very imperfect record of the interview or is most mislead-
ing. If it records a purely personal appeal from the Ambassador
it is rather strange that it was telegaphed to Berlin in
official matter of considerable importance. As a matter of fact
the German Ambassador had telegraphed to the Imperial Chan-
cellor that he was to discuss neutrality with Sir Edward Grey, and
this did give some official authority to the conversation.2 More-
over, in Sir Edward Grey?s statement we find use made of the
fact that the German Ambassador begged him on the 3rd August
not to make Belgian neutrality a condition of England?s neutrality.
The only comment that can be made on that is that it was a
clever way of confusing the narrative. The incident of White
Paper 123 took place two days before that. The appeal of the
3rd came naturally because the suggestion of the Ist had pro-
duced no result. If the White Paper proves anything with
absolute certainty it is that Sir Edward Grey never tried to save
Belgian in the event of a war breaking out . He was hopelessly
tied up by the Entente . He could not honorably have remained
at the War Office if Great Britain had remained neutral. It is
evident that Sir Edward Grey had now made up his mind that
the Entente and its sequel, the naval arrangements with France,
bound us to take part in the war ?not for Belgium, not for liberty,
not to suppress militarism, but because our honor had been com-
mitted to France. Besides, it was at this time being freely rumoured
in the House of Commons, and found its way into the Press, that

if the Cabinet, had decided upon neutrality Sir Edward Grey
would have resigned, as he?was of opinion that his whole policy
had been consistent with neutrality.] Whilst Russia?s European
war is in progress, Vienna and St. Petersburg are settling their

adjusted.l France mobilises in the afternoon. In London the

2nd August. It is rumored in Berlin that Russian troops
have crossed the frontier, and the Kaiser, addressing a crowd, says
Germany has been attacked ; in St. Petersburg it is published
abroad that Germany has attacked Russia. Sir Edward Grey, for
the first time, has a majority of the Cabinet with him on the plea
of Belgium and notice is given of resignations. [On Monday
afternoon, the 3rd, some were withdrawn.] The Cabinet agrees-
to ba(|k France, putting in as a � oil'd ition which )was (purely
nominal in the circumstances that Parliament -would support it.]

The chapter we set out to write is finished and all that
remains is to gather together into a brief conclusion what it means.
(1) The war arose from a policy to effect a balance of power
in Europe through a Triple Alliance and a Triple Entente.
(2) It happened most fortunately (though this ought to have
(been foreseen and guarded against) that the Alliance and the
Entente were respectively dominated by bitterly opposed racial
influences, and these influences provided the circumstances from
which the conflict arose.
(3) As a matter of fact, Great Britain was as much bound by
the Entente as though she had made a definite written commit-
ment?indeed the unwritten agreement bound us more than a writ-
ten one would have done, just as a specific obligation is less dan-
gerous in business than a vague undertanding. In any event, the
Entente led to the Naval conversations which committed our hon-
ours. None of this was told to the country, which was led to
believe that it was quite free.
1 White Paper 137; Cd. 7596. There is a conflict of evidence her�
between our own papers and Russian statements (cf. White Paper 139),
but no jury would believe what the Russian Foreign Minister was then
saying without corroborative evidence. Even the Russian Orange Book
73 casts doubts upon the word of her Foreign Secretary.

the 3rd August, Hansard, Ixv.j pp. 1815-18.


(4) Throughout the negotiations) the Powers were compelled to
act with their Allies. In the first stage of the negotiations Germany
represented Austrian interests?Prance was a mere second to
Russia, and we were hampered.
(5) Either Sir Edward Grey?s proposal or the German one
would have secured peace in Europe if the Austrian quarrel with
Servia had not been extended by Russia. Indeed, this quarrel was
in a fair way to settlement when the bigger one ?purely the crea-
tion of the diplomatists and the result of the alliances?was bring-
ing war upon Europe.
(6) None of the matters which fill such an important place in
the minds of the people and their newspapers at present ?Belgium,
nationality, public law and right?appear in the negotiations
until war has become inevitable. Indeed, most of them come into
play only after the war began. With the war, the floodgates w r ere
opened; all the questions leading up to the war were submerged
and altogether new problems arose.
(7) The military frame of mind was common in varying de-
grees to every country. The Franco-Russian Alliance was meant
to be aggressive ; Russia and France both meant to use us in their
quarrels ; w� had our Bernhardis ; the German military class was
strong ; the ablest in Europe, and aggressive.
(8) The military sections and the preachers of organised force
were not strong enough in any country to make war had not the
diplomatists played into their hands. The flood of stuff poured out
about warlike historians and philosophers is but academic vanities
and pomposities, mainly used by philosophers for making profits.
Within the memory of one who has lived only a little more than
a generation, Russia and France have both been anathematised
by us as being dangers to the peace of Europe; the wheel of time
has now brought Germany into that place; and on each of these
occasions, Russia, France and Germany have believed that Great
Britain was an intolerable power which had to be taught a lesson.
(9) In every country there was a string peace party, but in
no country had that party time to make itself effective. In
Russia it was weakest; in Great Britain it was strongest. So weak
was it in Russia that it never counted; in Germany it was active
until the Russian mobilisation; in Fiance it did little but look on,
except that the Socialist parliamentarians, headed by Jaures,
held frequent conferences with the Prime Minister and urged him
to influence Russia. It is known that the interview which Jaures
had with Viyiani an hour or two before his assassination was on
this very point. In England, the German invasion of Belgium
broke up the pacifists. But the records of the negotiations show
that every country except Russia strove for peace, and that but for
the alliances and the treaty obligations war would never have
broken out at all.


But war lias broken out, and this statement of how it came
has been made because unless we can restore some balance and
accuracy to popular criticism, some knowledge of reality to supplant
absurdities about Germany and silence about Russia, the peace will
come and the triumph of the Allies will mean nothing either to the
peace or the liberty of Europe.


I. W. W. PREAMBLE.
T ;e working class rnd the employing class have
nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as
hunger and want are found among millions of working
people and the few, who make up the employing class,
have all the good things of life.
Between these two classes a struggle must go on
until the workers of the world organize as a class, take
possession of the earth and the machinery of produc-
tion. and abolish the wage System.
We find that the centreing of the management of
industries Into fewer and fewer hands mr.kes the trade
unions unable to cope with the ever-growing power of
the employing class. The trade unions foster a state
of affairs which allows on� set of workers to be pitted
against another set of workers in the same industry,
thereby helping to defeat one another in wage wars.
Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to
mislead the workers into the belief that the working
class have inercsts in common with their employers.
These conditions can he changed and the interest
of the working class upheld only by an organization
formed In such a way that all its members in any one
industry, or in all Industries, if necessary, cease work
whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department
thereof thus making an injury to one an injury to all.
instead of the conservative motto, ?A fair day?s
wages for a fair day?s work,? we must inscribe on our
banner the revolutionary watchword, ?Abolition of the
wage system. - ,
It is with the historic mission of the working class
to do away with capitalism. The army of production
must be organized s not only for the every-day struggle
with the capitalists, but also to carry on production
when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By or-
ganizing industrially we are forming the structure of
the new society within the shell of the old.
