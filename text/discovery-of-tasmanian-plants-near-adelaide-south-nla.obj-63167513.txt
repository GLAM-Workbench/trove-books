cavity. This poultice was renewed four times per diem; and in
five days the ulcer had disappeared. I have tried this form of
poultice several times since, and ever with the same result. As
this small tree occurs in very many places throughout the colony,
its properties are well worthy of being made public.
Erythr&a australis , E. Br., I have found of use as a tonic in
febrile complaints.
Petalostigma guadriloculare, E. von Muell., is a useful remedy
in fever, low or intermittent, ten-grain doses of the dried bark
three times per diem often producing a favourable result. The
ripe fruit, which is of a most intense bitterness, is a valuable
vermifuge in horses. I have used it repeatedly, and with success,
in my stud.
Andropogon citreus, R. Br., makes a useful tea in fevers. I
found it growing at the native wells?the easternmost source of
the Burdekin river?situate on the telegraph-line between Cash-
mere and Junction Creek. I know of two plants used by the
aborigines for syphilitic disease ; but I have not been enabled to
test their efficacy to my satisfaction; hence I refrain from re-
cording them. No doubt many more valuable plants exist, and
only require patience and intelligent research to test their
value. Only a few months ago the Euphorbia pilulifera, L., was
a common weed, uncared for by any one. Now it is largely used
by nearly all who suffer from asthma.
Eatura alba, Nees, a most poisonous plant, which grows on
nearly all our northern rivers, proves fatal to numbers of horses
and cattle every year. This plant is also valuable in asthma,
but leaves a sensation of nausea and headache which is very
distressing.
The aborigines use several species of Malvaceous shrubs, obtain-
ing a mucilaginous drink which proves beneficial in many cases.
Eoots are also used in this manner, being roasted, then pounded,
and the mucilage sucked out ot them. They have a rough method
of obtaining the starch from seeds, roots, and bulbs, which they
accomplish by pounding and trituration, allowing the starch-
grains to settle on the bottom ot a large u cooloomen,? or canoe-
shaped basin. The water is then poured off, leaving a thick
cake ot hard starch which is baked into cakes. It resembles
our arrowroot or corn-flour in substance, and is not at all
unpalatable.


Discovery of Tasmanian Plants near Adelaide, South Australia.
By J. G-. Otto Tepper, E.L.S.
[Read December 7, 1882.]
Ik the early part of January 1882 I received an invitation from
Prof. B. Tate to join in an excursion for the purpose of botani-
cally examining a locality that had not been before visited, a
request to which I cheerfully acceded ; and the following pages
represent our joint results.
This locality is situated some 40 miles south of Adelaide,
among the low ranges covering the county of Hindmarsh (which
forms a peninsula extending towards Kangaroo Island), and is
almost in its centre,
Starting from Willunga (30 miles S. of Adelaide), which Prof.
Tate determined to be about 400 feet above sea-level, we crossed
the Sellick?s-Hill range, consisting of blue talcose shales and
quartzites at a very high angle of elevation, and found the
summit of the pass about 950 feet, the highest parts of the ridge
rising perhaps 100-200 feet higher. The more elevated portion
was covered by stringy-bark Eucalypts (Eucalyptus ohliqua) and
shrubs &c. similar to those about the capital.
From here (2 miles E. of Willunga) the road descended
gradually to the bed of the Meadows Creek, a watercourse of
some length; but at this locality and time it did not show the
least sign of water, or that a considerable body of water ever
passed. This being undoubtedly the case higher up, as we found
subsequently by unmistakable signs, it must be inferred that the
water finds its way under ground for some distance through the
gravel and sand with which the valley is filled to an unknown
depth.
At a distance of 5-6 miles another ridge was crossed, evidently
the watershed between St. Vincent?s G-ulf and Encounter Bay
with the Murray and its lakes. The road downwards on the E,
decline followed the windings of a marshy rivulet with permanent
fresh water, and scores of tiny springs oozing out into the drain
alongside the road. The lower parts of the hillsides consisted
of sands mixed with beautifully rounded pebbles of quartzite
&c., presumably of Tertiary age. The vegetation here changed
almost immediately, and almost at every step we met with plants
rarely, or not at all, occurring nearer Adelaide. Thus JBanksia


ornata, Adenanthus sp., Drosera Rinata, Xyris operculata were
observed, the two latter in full bloom. At about 9or 10 miles
from our starting-point, we arrived at our destination, a level
marshy flat surrounded by weird-looking hills on all sides and
a square mile or two in extent. The locality is uninhabited, and
known locally by the term ? Square Waterhole.? About mile
S.E. rises a steep hill, its summit formed by bare white rocks,
from which it has received the name Mount Jagged.
After arranging our camp we began collecting, and found this
marsh to be as fine a representation of a South-Australian moor
as could well be imagined. Consisting of black mould spread
over fine white sand, as exhibited by some drains, it was densely
overgrown by Sprengelia incarnata, Leptospermum lanigerum, and
Melaleuca squamea in dense clumps, numerous Cyperaceie and
Juncacese intermixed with TJtricularia dichotoma in thousands ?
while Lycopodium laterale, Schizcea hifida, and Lindsaya linearis
overspread the less grassy spots. Calostrophus laterijiorus and
Patersonia longiscapa were very abundant in the very moi.st
spots. Patersonia glauca, on the contrary, occupied drier spots
along the margin. We were surprised to find many plants in
full bloom, while at this late date scarcely any could be found in
drier places, or had long passed it there.
Owing to the exceptionally dry season the marsh was dry
enough to allow us to cross it with care, after we had examined
part of its S.W. edge, where we found several strong springs.
Following a drain, &c., we succeeded without much ill adventure
in getting to the outlet on the N.E. side. What rather surprised
us was, that at several places all appearance of water vanished, and
some 100 yards further on the murmuring of a strong stream
among dense bushes became audible ; this occurred repeatedly,
even in the narrow bed of the gully, through which the waters
escaped towards the N.E. The lower hills surrounding the
marsh consisted of Tertiary gravels and clays, the former exhibit-
ing numerous symmetrically rounded and polished pebbles of
older rocks in all sizes, but no fossils.
Next day the hills to the south and Mount Jagged were ex-
amined ; the latter was found by Prof. Tate to be about 1405 feet
high, the edge of the Miocene about 2200 feet and that of the
flat itself about 880 feet above the sea. The summit of Mount
Jagged consists of snow-white fine-grained quartzite of pre-Silu-
rian age, the angle of dip being about or near 90ï¿½, with a strike
LINN. JOUEN. ?BOTANY, VOL. XX. Gr


nearly N.-S. It is overgrown with low Eucalypti (sp. indeter-
minable) , Casuarina distyla, and very dwarfish Banksia marginata,
scarcely one of the latter being above 2 feet high, many less.
Among the rocks at the summit we found Marianthus bignoni-
aceus, which near Adelaide is only observed in moist springy
gullies. Eucalyptus obligua forms open groups of forest on some
of the other hills adjoining Mount Jagged. On a sandy hillside
near its foot we found the curious Caustis pentandra sparingly
among open scrub. Some 93 species of plants were collected by
us during our short stay of less than two days, of which my speci-
mens were, after our return, submitted to Baron F. v. Mueller,
who determined them most courteously for me, the accompanying
list presenting the result. Those marked by an asterisk are new
to the province. Others were found N. from the Willunga road,
where a succession of fine water-holes occurs, but no flowing water,
accompanied by a much different vegetation. This locality has
never before been examined at this season.
The most important result obtained is, that among the plants
collected at the Square Waterhole were 12 species new for this
province, and hitherto only found in Tasmania. Ten of these
belong to genera already represented here; but 2 genera, viz.
Micrantbeum hexandrum and Caustis pentandra, are also new.
Meadows Creek, where I personally collected only thirteen species,
added two more Tasmanian plants, viz. Hibhertia hirsuta and
Garex inversa. Thus another point has been established eluci-
dating the distribution of Australian plants, Prof. Tate having
found several, inclusive of Micrantbeum hexandrum and Caustis
--pentandra , lately at Kangaroo Island.
The locality which was examined at Meadows Creek is a long
valley, and from about a quarter of a mile to a mile wide, perfectly
level, on the western side of which the imperfectly defined water-
course is situated, chiefly marked by a chain of larger and smaller
holes containing permanent fresh water. Large Eed-gum trees
{Eucalyptus rostrata ) accompany them, replaced higher up on the
hill-slopes by E. I 'eucoxylon and E. obligua. The flat is covered a
short distance from the bed with very dense clumps of Banksia mar-
ginata, underneath which a dense covering is noted of Calastropbus
(fastigiatus ?), Lepidosperma laterale, and, near the water, large
tussocks of Boa ccespitosa, within which Garex inversa was found
exclusively. Very close to the banks, on permanently moist
ground, occurs in small patches the Cynodon sp. (No. 100), which


I have seen rarely in flower, and then, as in the specimen sent,
only with two or three spikes; while Gynodon Dactylon exhibits
five, blooming annually and profusely along roads and dry hill-
sides. Acacia (retinodes F) grows in large globular shrubs along
the banks; and some bushes were observed with copious flowers
and ripe fruit.
Although not botanical, I may mention that while disturbing a
large Poa tussock, one of the little Kangaroo-mice leaped out and
was captured alive. It was a little creature, not more than about
2 inches in length of body, with a tail about 2| to 3 inches, and
reddish-brown colour.
On the whole, the vegetation was found almost wholly distinct
from that of Square Waterhole, and very similar to scenery
further north.
Appended is the list of the plants collected, or which could be
identified with certainty, exclusive of such as form a feature
almost everywhere.
