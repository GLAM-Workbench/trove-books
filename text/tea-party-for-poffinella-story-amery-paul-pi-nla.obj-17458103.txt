m nr S not any good at al
if S not any good at all asking me,”
Said small Poffinella Poffles Maree.
That’s what she said when we asked her to tea
Our small Poffinella Poffles Maree!
Now, Poffinella’s a long enough name,
‘More on to that, 33 you could say, “is a shame!”
But then, Poffinella’s a pig so small,
A pig-
you
could say
hardly
there
at all


Jfp she did have a name not quite so big
You’d think her a quite unimportant pig!
She wouldn't like that - why - nobody would
Tho’ nobody has a pig quite as good
As our Pofhnella Poffles Maree
That’s just the right name for her you can see!
So, ‘ Pofhnellawe said, “please explain
Just why you cant meet the handsome new swam
We’ve asked for tea in the front garden plot?
Of all you’ve seen he’s the best of the lot
Tho you search far and wide, other lands,
You’ll find no other like this one .... for
you!"
“It s no good at all, I say, asking me,
Said small Poffinclla Poffles Maree
I see I must tell you once and for all
There’s a place I know where the garden wall
Breaks down a bit ... . and quite often Im seen
There, where the mud’s really fit for a queen!


there . . . . where 'i$0

that is because my friends come to share
The mud I find and the food I eat there.
That’s why ; I tell you, for tea I cant stay
Why I
can t even.


NOTHER thing, too,
there’s this about tea
A thing plainly seen ev’ry day by me-
lt can t be enjoyed when my old clothes show
My skin coming through! It’s time you should know
Then, Poffinella, so small and so fat
Said,
"Well! Ive told you!

And
quite
time
that!”

tail, then, she stood straight up in the air
And she just walked off and she left us there!
"Why! New clothes,'’ we said, “we bought
her in June!
Now, only October, it’s much too soon
To buy her some more! She’ll certainly wed
In those she has! Or stay single, instead!”
Ey’rv word she heard .... small Poffles Maree.
J
"Oh, dear!'' she said, "What will happen to me?
And what will I do when my friends all know
That to my own wedding .... I cannot go?
I ll be dead,’’ she said, "I'm sure in a week
And tears started
rolling down
each fat cheek!


u/
fj HILE she went off thinking her heart would
break
We said, “Well, really, perhaps we should make
A wedding gown and a bonnet and shawl,
Some bright summer clothes and then that’s
not all
A fine new home we could build for her, too.
Perhaps that is what we should really do!”
It was! We decided! And turned to say,
“There! Poffinella!” But she’d walked away ....
We saw her then, weeping! Down by the fence!
'lndeed, she was saying, “they need more sense
Than to tell me my
J
old clothes still must do
When so badly I need
j
some that are new!


ELL! I’ll stay no longer—looking a fright
I’ll run right away! Yes! This very night r

that then, straight away she set out!
"And a good home 111 find,” she said,
“no doubt
Poor Poffinella! When she’d walked a mile,
"This really,” she said, “is hardly worth while!
Back home I’d go but I’m not sure
I know
The way I came! Now .... the
way I should go!
One thing I know and that’s here
on the street
These people I see .... I don’t want to meet!”

Poffinella .... her worst fear came true
She heard someone say, “You little pig, you
Are lost I am sure! Come home now, with me!”
“This just would happen!" said Poffles Maree
Then, someone was saying, “Look at this, do!
Could you believe such a pig could be true?
Could you believe he was found on
the street
This little pig? Don t you think
he is sweet?”
The small thing sighed when those words she heard said
And, “Oh dear ; ” she said, “I’d be better dead!

This is a thing that 111 never live through!”
Then, after a while .... she said, “What I say
Could be kept, I'm sure, for some
other day
Plainly I see now, they’ll never be

HE heard then, "Look! Quick! He’s ragged
and tom!”
“I wish,” said Maree, I’d never been

“Take off his clothes

“now what

-AND all this time .... in another home, too,
Fine clothes had been made! But nobody knew
Where small Poffinella Poffles Maree
Had gone! Or where
SHE
COULD


That she’d run away
came to no one’s mind
They said,
"She’s been stolen!

To find a small pig? Ob! My Goodness! Oh!
Poor small Poffles Maree! Look what they’ve done—
