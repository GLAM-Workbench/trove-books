PREFACE.
fHERE are three classes oï¿½ visitors whose requirements
must he kept in view in the preparation of a Guide like
the present one. Eirst there are those who visit the
Museum with a view to obtaining information on some definite
point, or to study some particular group of objects. Eor
these, what must be aimed at is chiefly a topographical guide or
plan to indicate where the several collections are placed and the
general scheme of their arrangement, as it would be impossible
within the necessarily limited compass of a museum handbook to
supply detailed information regarding them, which must be
sought for in special works ; various catalogues of special collec-
tions which have been issued or are in preparation will to some
extent supply this want. Secondly, there is the student of the
general subject of natural history and comparative anatomy.
Thirdly there is the much larger class whose object is general
information. Eor the benefit of these the Guide requires to be,
to some extent explanatory and descriptive.
In writing the present Guide all these classes of visitors have
been kept in view, as far as it is possible to do so in a limited
compass. The present arrangement of the collections in the
Museum is only a temporary one, pending the carrying out of
certain very necessary alterations and additions in the buildings,
and it presents certain inconveniences both to the general visitor
and the student; but it is hoped that, with the help of the little
plan, there will be no difficulty in finding the whereabouts of the
several collections. Eor the benefit of the Natural History
student the various groups illustrated by the specimens in the
Type Collection are pointed out, and a few other necessary
explanatory notes added. For the general visitor some brief
explanatory memoranda are added, having reference for the most
part to the fauna of Australia.

I-AUSTRALIAN MAMMALS.
The lower floor of the New Building (2 and 3 in plan) is
occupied in great part by the collections of the various groups of
Australian Yertebrata (or back-boned animals), the Fishes, Frogs,
Snakes, Lizards, Tortoises, and Mammals. Of these, the largest
collection is that of the Australian Mammalia at the northern
end of the building, including the Kangaroos, "Wallabies,,
Kangaroo-rats, Bandicoots, Phalangers, Native Cats, Pouched
Rats, Native Bears, Wombats, and other groups of Marsupials,
representing, together with the Aboriginal Black-fellow, the
Native Dog, and a few Bats and Rats, the entire indigenous
Mammalian Fauna of Australia.
Marsupials are not entirely restricted to the Australian Con-
tinent ; several kinds of Kangaroos, Wallabies and Phalangers
(CuscusJ are known to inhabit New Guinea, and]species of Cuscus


are found in Celebes, Amboyna, Waigiou, Timor, New Ireland,
etc., while a distinct family of Marsupialia ?the Didelphidse or
true Opossums, inhabit the American Continent; but Australia
is peculiarly the home of this order of mammals. Here they
reach their highest degree of development as regards numbers
and variety, and among them are to be found the equivalents
or analogues of a great many of the subdivisions of the
higher orders of Mammalia. Thus the Antelopes and Deer
are represented by the Kangaroos, Wallabies, and Pademelons,
the Cats and Weasels by the Dasyures and Phascogales, the
Dogs by the Thylacines, the Porcupines by the Echidna, the
Ant-Eaters by the Myrmecobius, the Moles by the Bandicoots,
the Rodents by the Wombat, the Monkeys by the Koalas and
Phalangers, the Plying Squirrels by the Petaurista and Belideus.
In other words the Mammals of Australia, though nearly all
Marsupials, have become adapted to widely different habits and
modes of life, some being herbivorous, some fruit-eating, some
insect-eating, others flesh-eating, some fleet runners, others
living habitually in trees, and so on. Tet, with all these diversities
of habits and the corresponding differences of structure, they are
all united in one group by certain common characteristics. In
the first place (leaving out of account for the present the Platypus
and Echidna, which belong to a lower group than the true
Marsupials) they nearly all possess a pouch ( marsupium , whence
the name of the Order) in which the young are carried until they
reach an age when they are capable of shifting for themselves.
Co-ordinated with the presence of the pouch is that of the so-
called marsupial hones ?a pair of bones which are attached to
the front of the pubis (see the skeleton of a kangaroo in
the right-hand corner of the first case) ; these bones are
not directly connected with the pouch or marsupium, they
are formed by the conversion into bone of a tendon or sinew,
and rudiments of similar bones or cartilages are found in
exceptional instances in some of the higher Mammals ; but, as
their presence is constant in the Marsupials, except in the
Tasmanian Thylacine, the name of marsupial bones has been
given to them. Besides the presence of marsupial bones the


skeleton of the Marsupialia is characterised nearly always by the
bending inwards of the angle of the lower jaw, by the socket in
which the lower jaw works being partly formed by the cheek-bone,
and by the sutures or lines of junction of the bones of the skull
remaining remarkably open throughout life. The brain also is
of low organisation ?the cerebrum or great brain being usually
smooth or little convoluted, and the corpus callosum or cross-band
of nerve fibres by which the halves of the great brain are united
together being of small size and scarcely distinct. A more note-
worthy and distinctive point, however, is the condition in which
the young are born. The young of many of the other groups of
mammals are born in a more or less blind and helpless condition,
but in none are they born at so early a stage of their development
as in the Marsupials. Brought forth like the young of other
animals they are placed by the mother in the pouch, where they
adhere to the teat. The milk, which they are incapable of suck-
ing, is squeezed down their throats by the action of the mother,
choking being prevented by a special formation of the throat, by
means of which a continuous passage is formed for the air from
the nostrils to the windpipe, the milk passing on either side down
to the gullet. These young kangaroos or phalangers may be
found in the pouch in so rudimentary a state that the belief is
very current among bushmen that they grow there like apples on
a tree ; but that such is not the case is evidenced, not only by
the structure of the internal organs, but by the discovery, first
by Prof. Owen, and subsequently by others, of young still more
rudimentary than those in the pouch in the uterus or womb itself.
The first three wall-cases on the left side of the North Wing
(2 and 8 in the plan) are chiefly occupied by mounted specimens
of kangaroos and wallabies comprising the family Macropodidce.
These are distinguished by the great length of the hind as compared
with the fore limbs ?the former being alone used in progression?
and the powerful tail ; the first toe of the hind foot is absent, the
second and third toes are bound together by the skin and are
very small, the fourth is very large and the fifth is smaller,
but fully formed in all except Hypsiprymnodon ; there are
three incisor or front teeth on each side in the upper jaw, and a


single pair in the lower, the latter being chisel-shaped, directed
horizontally forwards, and capable of being worked scissors-like
against one another by the movement of the two halves of the
lower jaw, which are loosely connected together. Among these
may be noted the Great Kangaroo ( Macropus major'), the Red
Wallaroo or Great Red Kangaroo (Osphranter rufus), the
Black Wallaroo ( Ospliranter rohustus) ; the Great Kangaroo
of Western Australia (Macropus ocydromus) , Parry?s Wallaby
{Halmaturus Parryi) from the Clarence River and Queensland,
the Pademelon Wallaby (Halmaturus Thetidis), the Black-
striped Wallaby, the Black Wallaby, the Red-necked Wallaby,
the Black-gloved Wallaby of Western Australia, and other
species. In the third case is a group of the Yellow-footed
Rock AY allaby ( Petrogale xanihopus) of South Australia, and
specimens of the New South Wales Rock AYallaby ( Petrogale
penicillata) . In the same case are specimens of a New
Guinea Wallaby (the JDorcopsis luctuosa), which differs from
any Australian species in the nature of its dentition; also the
Nail-tailed AYallabies ( Onchogalea lunata and O. frenata), and
the Tasmanian AY allaby ( Halmaturus Billardieri) . In the fourth
case are the Rat-kangaroos and the Bandicoots. Of the former is
to be specially noticed the common Rat-kangaroo ( Hypsiprymnus
murinus) and a singular little species from Rockingham Bay
named by Mr. E. P. Ramsay Hypsiprymnodon moschatus and
regarded by Prof. Owen as, perhaps, forming the type of a new
family. Of the latter may be mentioned Gunn?s Bandicoot
{Perameles Gunnii), the Saddle-backed Bandicoot ( Perameles
myosurus), the Banded Bandicoot {Peramelesfasciatus), the large
New Guinea Bandicoot ( Perameles Broadhentii) and the so-called
Rabbit-rat ( Perayalea lagofis). Below, in the same case, will be
found specimens of the Banded Hare-kangaroo (Lagorchestes
fasciatus) of AYestern Australia, the common Hare-kangaroo, the
Jerboa Kangaroo (Bettongia penicillata ) and other species of
Jerboa, and also the singular Chaeropus castanotis. At the left-
hand end of the first case at the bottom (room No. 2) is a group
* The skeletons of Marsupials will be found in room No. 5.


of Wombats ( Fhascolomiys ). These burrowing and root-eating
Marsupials are characterised by their thickset bodies and short
legs, each foot having five powerful digging claws ; they have
a single pair of chisel-shaped front teeth above and below,
quite like those of a rabbit or rat, no canines, and five grinding
teeth on each side above and below.
The next case is occupied by carnivorous or flesh-eating
Marsupials of the family Dasyuridae. This family is characterised
by having four incisors on each side in the upper jaw and three
in the lower, and by the possession of well-developed canines, and
by the usual number of grinding teeth being seven on each side
above and below ; there are four toes in the foot and none of them
are united by a web; the great toe or hullux is often rudimentary ;
the tail is not prehensile. Below is a group of Tasmanian carnivora,
including the Tasmanian Devil (Sarcopbilus ursinus) which differs
from the true Dasyures, among other points, in the entire absence
of the hullux or great toe, the Tasmanian Wolf ( Thylacinus
cynocepbalus ) remarkable for its dog-like proportions, and the
spotted Dasyure or ? Tiger Cat? ( Dasyurus viaculatus). Besides
these in the same case are specimens of the common variable
Dasyure or ?Native Cat? {Dasyurus viverrinus), the West
Australian Dasyure (Dasyurus Oeoffroyii) , the South Australian
Dasyure ( D. hallucatus) , and the Brush-tailed Phascogale
(Phascogale penicillata). In the next case are a series of small
rat-like or mouse-like animals which are nearly related to the pre-
ceding, and in fact require to be placed in the same family. These
are the various species of Antechinus, Antechinomys, Fodabrus,
and allied genera which in most parts of their organisation are
ï¿½ Native Cats ? in miniature. Here must be mentioned the
Banded Ant-eater {Myrmecobius fasciatus) of wdiich there are
specimens in the bottom of the case. This curious little marsupial,
which is a native of Western Australia, is likewise referred to
the family of the Dasyures or Native Cats, but has no fewer than
nine grinding teeth (three premolars and six molars) on each
side above and below ; the female has no pouch, but has eight
nipples arranged in a circle as in the Phascogale; it has a long
slender tongue for licking up the ants on which it feeds, and is


said to be in the habit of running rapidly round an ant-hill until
it has thoroughly roused the whole colony, when it proceeds to-
satisfy its appetite.
The greater part of the remainder of this case is taken up
by the Carpophaga or fruit-eating Marsupials, including the
Phascolarctidse or Koalas (Native Bears) and the Phalangistidae
or Phalangers or Australian Opossums. The familiar Koala
or Native Bear, of which there is but one species ( Phascolarctus
cinereus), found over nearly the whole of Australia south of the
tropics, is distinguished by the rudimentary tail, by having the
thumb and second finger opposable to the other fingers, and
the innermost toe of the foot opposable like a thumb ; all the toes
except the innermost toe of the hind feet have strong claws.
There are three front teeth on each side above and one below,
one canine above and none below, and five grinding teeth on
each side above and below. The term carpophagous does not
well indicate the habits of the native bear, whose ordinary food
is not fruits, but the tender shoots of the Eucalypti.
The Phalangers ( Phalangistidce ) form a tolerably large family.
They all, unlike the Koala, have a long prehensile tail, which is
scaly or naked underneath at the extremity. As in the Koala
the second and third toes are united by a web. Among these
attention may be directed to the specimens of the common
Phalanger or Opossum ( Phalangista vulpina). Cook?s Phalanger
([Phalangista Cookii), the Sooty Phalanger ( Phalangista fuli-
ginosa) of Tasmania, the Yiverrine Phalanger ( Phalangista
viverrina ), and the little banded Phalanger ( Bactylopsila trivir-
gata) from Northern Queensland, the flying Phalangers
(Petaurista taguanoides , Belideus hreviceps, and B. arid, and the
minute Acroihata pygmcca.)
In this case also are the specimens of those two very remark-
able and interesting Australian Mammals the Platypus and the
Echidna. Though placed along with the Marsupials, these
remarkable animals are really as distinct from them as the
Marsupials are from the higher orders of Mammalia. They
constitute, in fact, a lower subdivision of the Mammalia distin-


guished from the Marsupials, as from all other Mammals, by
certain points in their organisation by which they are linked
with the Birds and Reptiles. Such points are, in the skeleton,
the presence of a T-shaped bone?the interclavicle in front of
the breast-bone, the union of the coracoid bones with the
breast-bone, and the fact that the epiphyses of the vertebrae are
absent; and in the brain the absence as a distinct structure of
the corpus callosum or cross-band of fibres, by means of which
the two halves of the cerebrum or great brain are connected
together in all other Mammals. The Platypus and Echidna,
however, shew their relationship with the Mammalia in the
possession of the mammary glands by which the young are
nourished, though these are devoid of teats, there being only a
bare space of the skin, often pushed in slightly so as to foim
a shallow pit, where the ducts or canals of the gland open.
On account of their evident relationship with the Birds and
the Reptiles, it was formerly supposed that the Monotremata
(as the class funned by the Platypus and Echidna is called)
might be oviparous, but all doubts on this head (which indeed
might be resolved by a study of the structure of the female
generative organs) were removed by the discovery by Prof.
Owen of the ova of the Platypus and Echidna in utero : the
Echidna and Platypus bring forth the young alive like the
higher Mammals, but in a very rudimentary state ; and as in the
Marsupials there is no evidence of the existence of a placenta.
The Monotremata are represented by only two well-marked
species in Australia?the Duck-billed Platypus ( Ornithorhynchus
anatinm ) and the Spiny Ant-eater {Echidna hystrix). The
Tasmanian species of Echidna is regarded as distinct and is
named E. setosa, and a third species has been described from
New G-uinea. They are found in no other part of the world,
and, though analogy leads us to infer that they must have been
more abundant at some preceding period of the earth s history,
no fossil remains of them have been-found save in some post-
tertiary deposits in Australia itself.
Though united in one Order, the Platypus and Echidna differ
considerably from one another. The Platypus (of which there is


a group, at the bottom of the case with an imitation of their
natural surroundings), is essentially an aquatic animal, with
webbed feet adapted for swimming, broad leathery beak adapted
for seeking food such as grubs and worms among mud and water-
weeds, horny grinding teeth, and soft fur. The Echidna on the
other hand has the feet armed with strong claws adapted for
digging, a narrow beak with a long slender tongue, and is clothed
with a mixture of strong pointed spines and coarse hairs. In
the case of both the Platypus and the Echidna the male has the
hind feet armed with a strong pointed spur, in connection with
which is a gland, but there is no evidence that the secretion of
this gland is of a poisonous nature, or that the animal uses the
spur as a weapon of offence.
In the next case are specimens of the Australian non-Marsupial
Mammals?the rats and mice, the native dog and the bats ; also
specimens of the common Seal* and the common New South Wales
Dolphin. Of the rats the most remarkable are the water-rats
( Hydromys) and the curious little kangaroo-like Rapalotis. The
Native Dog or Dingo is apparently a wild variety of the
domestic dog, and probably made its advent in Australia along
with man, that is, at, geologically speaking, a comparatively recent
period; but the evidence on this point is not complete.
LI?AUSTRALIAN BIRDS.
The Australian Birds are contained in the room marked 8 in
plan in the upper floor.f Nearly 700 species of Australian
birds have been described ; and, though specimens of all of those
are not contained in the mounted collection, the greater number
are represented. As comparedwith other regions of the earth?s
surface Australia is characterised by the absence of certain wide-
spread families and the presence of several families not found in
any other part of the world. There are no true Einches (Frin-
* Other specimens of the Eared Seal are in the Eoom numbered 7.
f As at the time of writing this Guide the birds were soon to be re-
arranged in new wall-cases, it has not been possible to give full particulars
as to their mode of arrangement in the present edition.


gillidce ) Woodpeckers ( Picidac ), Pheasants ( Phasianidce ), or
Vultures ( Vulturidce ) in Australia; though these families are
widely distributed over the rest of the earth?s surface. On the
other hand no fewer than nine families may be regarded as
peculiar to the Australian region?including New Guinea and
the neighbouring Islands ?namely, the Birds of Paradise (Para-
diseidce), the Honey-eaters ( Meliphagidcs ), the Lyre-birds
(Menuridcs ), the Scrub-birds {At rich idee ), the Cockatoos
{Gacatuidce), a family of Parrakeets (the Platycercidce) the Brush-
tongued Parrakeets {Trichoglossidce), the Mound-birds {Mega-
podidce), and the Cassowaries ( Gasuaridas) . Among families
found in other regions the King Fishers {Alcedinidce) are more
largely represented in Australia than in any other region of the
earth, and the Pigeons are also very numerous.
The great wealth in temperate Australia of honey-bearing
flowers, of the Myrtle family particularly, and the Proteacece,
sustains an immense multitude of honey-eating birds of the
family Meliphagidce , which feed as well on the small insects about
the flowers as on the honey itself. This family comprises many
of the commonest and most familiar birds to be seen among the
Banksias, Melaleucas and Eucalypts in the ? bush ? in New South
Wales, Such is the graceful little Spine-bill {Acanthorhynchus
tenuirostris) , the common White-cheeked Honey-eater {Meliornis
sericea ), the very numerous species of Ptilotis ?such as the
familiar Yellow-tufted Honey-eater (P. auricomis), the White-
eared Honey-eater (P. leucotis), and the Yellow-faced Honey-
eater (P. chrysops), the richly attired Blood-bird {Myzomela
sanguinoJenta), the ?Old Soldier? or Garrulous Honey-eater
{Myzantha garruld), the Gill Bird or Wattle Bird {Anthochaera
carunculata ), the Friar Bird {Tropidorhynchus corniculatus) with
its curious leather-like hood, and a host of others. The family
of the Birds of Paradise ( Paradiseidce) is represented in Australia
among other forms by the Manucode and Rifle-bird, by the
Bower-birds, such as the Satin Bower-bird {Ptilonorhynchus
holosericeus), the Spotted Bower-bird {Ghlamydodera maculata ),
the Regent-bird {Sericulus melinus), and the Cat-bird {Ailuraedm
Smithii). The very peculiar family of the Lyre-birds, with their


magnificent tails, are shewn in groups in special cases?the New
South" Wales Lyre-bird ( Menura superha), and the Northern
Lyre-bird {Menura Alberti) ; the Victorian Lyre-bird {Menura
Victoria) is in its place in the general collection.
The peculiar and interesting family of the Cockatoos also
demand special attention. The best known is the common
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo {Cacatua galerita)-, and the handsomest
is Leadbeater?s Cockatoo (Cacatua Leadheateri ). Of the
Parrakeets, attention may be directed to the familiar Pennant?s
Parrakeet or the ? Blue Mountain ? as it is often termed {Platy-
cercus Pennantii), the ? Rose Hill ? or ? Rosella ? Parrakeet (P.
eximius); the j ?Moreton Bay Rose Hill? {P. pallidiceps), and
the Grass Parrakeets {Pupbema). The Brush-tongued Parrakeets
are represented by the gorgeous Blue-bellied Lorikeet {Tricho-
glossus Nov ce-Holland ice J, the Scaly-breasted Lorikeet (T. chloro-
lepidotus), the common Musk Lorikeet ( T. or Glossopsifta
australis ), the little Lorikeet {T. or G. pusilla) and others.
There are twenty-five species of Pigeons in Australia, and of
these particular attention may be called to the beautifully
coloured Pruit Pigeons, Ptilopus Swainsonii, P. Pwingii,
Lamprotreron superbus, and Megaloprepia magnijica, the White
Nutmeg Pigeon {Mgristicivora spiloi'rboa'), the Top-knot Pigeon
(Lopholaimus antarcticus ), the Wonga Wonga {Leucosarcia picata)
the common Bronze-Wing {Pbaps cbalcoptera), the Brush Bronze-
Wing ( Phaps elegans), the Crested Bronze-Wing {Ocyphaps
lopbotes) and the Peaceful Dove {Geopelia tranguilla.)
The very remarkable family of Birds, which from their habit
of depositing their eggs in mounds of decaying vegetable matter,
have been named the Mound Birds {Megapodiidce), though not
strictly confined to the Australian Continent, are very character-
istic of the Australasian region, and find their nearest, though
still not very near, allies in the Curassows of South America.
Of these one of the best known is the Brush-turkey ( Talegallus
Latliami), an inhabitant of New South Wales and Queensland,
This bird, as is well known, lays its eggs in holes in large mounds
of decaying vegetable matter, and covers them up?the hatching


of the eggs being brought about by the heat generated by the
fermentation of the mass: when they emerge from the egg the
young are already able to shift and forage for themselves. The
so-called Plain-turkey ( Leipoa ocellata) has very similar habits,
and so has the Australian Megapode {Megapodius tumulus).
Among the Wading-birds one of the most remarkable is the
Tribonyx, which is somewhat nearly related to the Is otornis
of New Zealand.
The Emu ( Dromceus Novce-Hollandiee) is another of the most
interesting and characteristic of the Australian birds. A second
kind, the Spotted Emu (D. irorratus) occurs in the western
portions of the continent. The Australian Cassowary ( Casuarius
australis ) is only found in the northern portions of Queensland.
Both the Cassowary and the Emu belong to that subdivision of
the class of birds to which the African Ostrich and the South
American Rhea also belong. These birds differ from all others
in certain points in the structure of the skeleton ?the breast-
bone, the pelvis, and the skull?in whicn they approach nearer
the reptiles than other birds. The presence of these gigantic
birds in South Africa, in South America, Australia, and formerly
in New Zealand (see the skeletons of the Moa), is regarded
by some naturalists as evidence (taken in connection with various
other similar facts) of the former existence of a land-connection
between these countries in the form of a great southern
continent.
III?AUSTRALIAN REPTILES.
The collection of Australian Eeptiles is placed in two centre
cases in the uoi?th room of the ground floor (3 in plaii). The case
placed on the left contains the Snakes. The Australian Snakes
belong chiefly to the families Pythonidse and Elapidse ; the latter
are all venomous, and these comprise about two-thirds of the
species. Among the non-venomous snakes are represented the
Typhlopidce or Blind Snakes, the Tree-Snakes ( Dendrophida ), such
as the common Green Tree-Snake (Dendrophis punctulata), the
Night Tree Snakes ( Dipsadidce ); among the Python family the
Carpet Snake ( Morelia variegata), the Diamond Snake (. Morelia


spilotes), the Black-headed Snake ( Aspidiotes melanocephalus), and
others. Of the venomous snakes (family Elapidse) may be specially
noted the Brown Snake ( Diemenia superciliosa), the deadly Black
Snake ( Pseudechis porphyriacus ), the Brown-banded Snake (Hop-
locephalus curtus ), also a very dangerous species, the Clarence
River snake (Tropidechis carinafa), the Hinged Snake ( Vermicella
annulata), and the Death Adder ( Acanthophis antarctica). The
last-named is a dangerous snake, though perhaps not so venomous
as the Brown, Black, or Brown-banded; the last scale of the tail
becomes hardened in old specimens, and has somewhat the form of
the sting of a scorpion, so that it is popularly supposed to act as
a weapon of offence: that it is not so may readily be proved by
experiment; a similar superstition is prevalent regarding certain
species of Indian Snakes. The Sea Snakes (Family Hydropthidce)
are all, as far as known, very venomous ; but we rarely hear of
accidents from their bite, as they are very timid, and will not
attack man unless driven to bay in some crevice. As examples
of this family may be noticed the Ringed Sea Snake ( Platurus
scutatus ) the Brown Sea Snake {Aipsyurus fuscus), Stoke?s Sea
Snake ( Hydrophis Sfokesii), the Eyed Sea Snake ( Hydrophis
ocellatd), and the Yellow-bellied Sea Snake ( Pelamis hicolor).
In the opposite case are contained the Lacertilia or Lizards.
The Australian Lizards are very numerous and in many instances
very peculiar. Three of the families into which they are arranged,
viz., the Pygopodidce, the Aprasiidce , and the Lialidce, and 36 of
the genera are found in no other part of the world. The greater
number of the species belong to the families of the Scinks and
the G-eckos.
Among the Scinks may be noticed the numerous species of
Hmulia, the ? Shingle Back ? ( Trachydosaurus rugosus), the
?Blue Tongue? ( Cyclodus gigas), and among the G-eckos
the Thick-tailed G-ecko ( (Edura marmomta ), and the Leaf-tailed
Geckos (Phyllurus platurus , P. Myliusii, and P. inermis).
The Pygopodidie are snake-like lizards peculiar to Australia,
with rudimentary fore limbs; e.g. Pygopus lepidopus; the
Lialidae are likewise snake-like, with no external trace of


limbs; examples in the collection are Lialis JBurtoni and Lialis
puncfulata. In the families of Lizards found in other parts of
the world, may be noticed the common variable Lace-Lizard
(Hydrosnurus vctrius ), commonly but erroneously called the
Iguana ?the true Iguanas being found only in South America
the Prilled Lizard ( Chlamydosaurus Kingii ), the Jew Lizard
Qrammatophora barbata), and the curious Horned Lizard ( Moloch
horridus), of which a monster ally has recently been described
by Prof. Owen from fossil bones found in the Darling Downs.
The Australian Turtles and Tortoises are placed in the bottom
of the same case. Among the Fresh-water Turtles attention
may be called to the Oblong Turtle ( Chelodina oblonga), and the
Toothed-backed Turtle {Elseya dentata ). The genera Chelodina,
JElseya, and Ghelemys are all peculiar to Australia.
The Australian Crocodiles are in room Ho. 7, and will be
noticed under ? Larger Aquatic Vertebrates.?
IV.?AUSTRALIAN AMPHIBIA.
The collection of Frogs, almost entirely Australian, are
arranged at present in the case containing the specimens of
Lizards and Tortoises. The Australian region is marked by the
absence of any of the tailed Amphibians, such as the efts 01
newts and salamanders ; but it is very rich in the various families
of tailless forms, especially tree-frogs. There is only one true
toad (Fam. Bufonidw) ; but nine other families are represented,
and seven genera are peculiar to Australia, viz., Pseudophrgne,
Pachyhatrachus and Ghelydobatrachus , Helioporus, Pelodryas,
Chirodryas and Notaden. Only two of these peculiar genera
(Pelodryas and Pseudophryne) are represented in the Museum
collection, so that contributions of frogs are much wanted. The
genus Litoria and the family Pelodryadce are found in South
America as well as in Australia, and present us with one among
many points of similarity between the faunae of these two
regions.


V.?AUSTRALIAN FISHES.
In the upright centre cases of the same room that contains the
Mammals (2 and 3 in plan) are cases containing specimens in
spirits and stuffed of Australian fishes, arranged according to
their orders and families. Of the present collection, among the
Perch tribe, attention may be called to the common salt-water
Perch (hates colonorum ), found in the mouths of all the eastern
rivers of New South Wales as well as in Victoria, and not un-
common in the Sydney Market; the ? Old Wife ? # (Enoplosus
armatus), the so-called ? Black Rock Cod ? ( Serranus Damelii) of
Port Jackson, the ? Wirrah ? (Plectropoma ocellatum and P. annu-
latum), the very unhappily named ? Salmon ? or ? Salmon Trout ?
of the Sydney fishermen {Arripis salnr), the ? Murray Cod,? or,
better, ? Murray Perch ? ( Oligorus ) of which there are several
species; the ? Silver Perch ? ( Therapon Richardsonii), the
?Trumpeter? ( Therapon Guvieri) ; the ?Pearl Perch? ( Glaucosoma
scapulare), a very fine fish caught on snapper-grounds, but
unfortunately rarely seen, perhaps owing to its favourite haunts
not having yet been discovered; the ?Bull?s Eye Perch?
( Friacanthus macranthus ), the ?Silver Belly? ( Gerres ovatus ).
Among the Squamipennes may be noticed the common
Chcetodon strigatus, of Port Jackson, and the ? Sweep ?
( Scorpis aeguipinnis) ; in the Mullidfe the ? Red Mullet ?
(Eupeneoides Vlamingii). Among the Sparidae some of the chief
species are the common ? Black Fish ? ( Girella tricuspidata), the
? Snapper ? ( Pagrus unicolor ), the ? Tarwhine ? ( Chrysophrys
sarba ) the ? Black Bream ? ( Chrysophrys australis ), the ? Morwong?
(Ohilodactylus macropterus ), the ?Banded Morwong? (Chilo-
dactylus vittatus), the ? Carp ? (Ohilodactylus fuscus), the
? Bastard Trumpeter? ( Latris ciliaris ) ; among the Scorpsenidae
the ?Red Rock Cod? (Scorpoena cruenta and S. cardinalis), the
* It has to be noted in connection with these English names for the
Australian fishes (and the same remark applies to other classes of natural
objects) that the same names are applied in different Colonies or even
different parts of New South Wales itself to very different species of
fishes, and some species may have as many as four or five different
English names in different parts of Australia. The English names on
the labels are those most in vogue in Sydney.


? Fortescue ? ( Pentaroge marmorata ) so much dreaded by fisher-
men on account of the painful wounds produced by its spines ;
the ? Zebra Fish ? ( Pterois volitans) ; among the Berycidse the
? Nanegai ? ( Beryx affinis) ; among the Sciaenidee the ?Jew Fish ?
(Scicena artarctica), and the ?Teraglin? (Otolithus atelodus) ;
among the Carangidse the ?Yellow Tail? ( Trachurus trachurus),
the ? King Fish ? ( Seriola Lalandii), the ? Samson Fish? of the
Sydney fishermen {Seriola hippos), the ? Tailor ? ( Temnodon
saltator ) and the ?John Horey? ( Zeus australis)-, in the
Scombridae the ?Mackerel? (Scomber anfarcticus), the ?Horse
Mackerel ? (Auxis Bamsayi), the? Pilot Fish ? (Nauc rates ductor)
and the remarkable ? Sucking Fish? ( Echeneis remora) ; in the
Trachinidae the ?Whiting? (Sillago maculata and S. bassensis) ;
in the Cottina the ?Flathead? (Platycephalus fuscus and P.
cirronasus) and the ?Flying Gurnet? (Triglapolyommata)- among
the Gobies the ? Climbing Fish ? (Periophthalmus australis) ; in
the Sphyraenidae the ?Pike? (Sphyraena obtusata) ; among the
Atherinidae the ? Hardy Head ? (Atherina pinguis) ; of the
Mugilidae the Mullet (Mugil dobula and Mugil grandis).
On the top of one of the cases will be seen a large specimen
of a Ribbon Fish (family Trachypteridae) named by Mr. E. P.
Ramsay Regalaecus jacksoniensis. Among the Labridae attention
may be directed to the ?Pig Fish? (Cossyphus unimaculatus),
the ? Blue Groper ? (Cossyphus Gouldii), and the ? Rock
Whiting ? of the Sydney fishermen (Odax semifasciatus) ; among
the Gadidae or Cod Family to the ? Beardy ? ( Lotella marginata),
Among the Pleuronectidae or Flat Fishes are represented the
?Flounder? (Pseudorhombus Bussellii), the ?Sole? (Solea),
the ? Lemon Sole ? (Plagusia unicolor), and others ; this family
has a good many representatives in Australia, but they are never
very common in the Sydney market, the trawl not being yet
employed by the Sydney fishermen. Among the Siluridae may be
noted the ?Cat Fish ? of Port Jackson (Cnidoglanis anguliformis);
in the Scopelidse the oddly named ? Sergeant Baker (Aulopus
purpurissatus) ; among the Scombresocidae the ? Long Tom ?
(Belone ferox), the ? Gar Fish? (Hemirhamphus intermedins),
and the ? River Gar Fish ? (Hemirhamphus regularis ) ; in the


family Osteoglossidae the Barramundi ( Osteoylossum Leichardti),
of the Queensland Elvers, a remarkable genus which is found
likewise in the tropical rivers of Eastern South America, and the
Indo-Malay Islands, The Galaxiadas comprising the various
species of Galaxias sometimes called ?Mountain Trout,? are
remarkable as being found only in the rivers of Australia, New
Zealand and South America.
The numerous and fine varieties of the herring family, shoals
of which visit the Australian coast at certain seasons, are not at
present well represented in the collection; but notice may be
taken of Elops saurus , Clupea novcï¿½-Jiollctndicï¿½j which is the
Australian representative of the sprat, Glupect moluccensis , various
species of anchovy, ( Enyraulis ), etc.
Among the Muramidae the most noteworthy species represented
is the Silver Eel ( Murcxnesox cinereus ), among the Lophobranchii
the Hippocampus , among the Sclerodermi the ?Leather Jackets?
(Monacantlms ) and ? File Fishes ? (. Balistes ), the ? Box Fishes ?
(Ostracion ), the ?Toad Fishes? ( Tetrodon ), and the ?Porcupine
Fish ? (Eicotylichtdiyspunctatus) *
Perhaps the most remarkable of all the Australian Fishes is
the Ceratodus, or so-called ? Burnett Salmon ? of the Queensland
Eivers, represented in the collection by stuffed specimens; it is
intermediate in some respects between the fishes and the
amphibia, and its nearest living allies are the ?Mud Fishes? of
South Africa.
Among the cartilaginous Fishes are spirit specimens of the
young of seveial species of sharks ; also stuffed specimens of the
?Angel Fish? {Elina squafina), the ?Whip-tailed Eay? of
Port Jackson ( Myliohatis ), the ? Torpedo Eay,? or ? Numb Fish ?
of the Sydney fishermen ( Ilypnos subnigrum ), the ? Saw Fish ?
(Pristiophorus cirratus ), the ?Wobbegong? (Crossorhinus bar-
latus and C. dasypoyon). The larger stuffed specimens of sharks
and rays will be found in the upper floor, (Eoom No. 7).
* Large specimens of the Sun-Fish, which also belongs to this family,
will be found in room No. 7.


VI.?LARGER AQUATIC VERTEBRATES.
In a group on the floor in the centre hall of the upper story
(7 in plan) and suspended from the gallery are stuffed specimens
of the larger aquatic vertebrata. These include representatives
of a number of different groups of animals that have their limbs
specially constructed for locomotion through the water. Among
tru ejlshes are representatives of the larger sharks and rays, sun-
fishes, etc. Among reptiles are the gigantic ? Luth ?or ? Leather-
Backed Turtle ? and the Crocodile. Among aquatic mammals
are represented the Seals (order Carnivora), the Dugong and the
Manatee (order Sirenia), and the Whale-bone Whales and
Porpoises (order Cetacea). All these animals, though belonging
to widely different classes, agree (with the exception of the
Crocodiles), in having the limbs specially modified to serve as
flippers or paddles, by whose aid progression through the water
is effected, and all, with the same exception, are more or less
helpless or awkward on land. Special attention may be directed
to the Dugong, which is one of the two, or at most three, living
species of the class Sirenia, all characterised like the Whales, by
the possession of a single pair of flippers, and by the almost total
absence of hair. The Dugong is a marine mammal from the
Queensland Coast, but ranging westwards through the Indian
Ocean to the east coast of Africa, inhabiting shallow waters
of bays and inlets and feeding on sea-weed. In its full grown
state it may be as much as 20 feet in length ; the colour of the
smooth, glossy back varies from light brown to slatey black, the
under surface being lighter. The full-grown males have a pair of
conspicuous tusks in the upper jaw ; these are wanting in the
female. The flesh is valued as food by the natives ; the oil is of
excellent quality, and has been used with good results as a sub-
stitute for cod-liver oil; but the number of the animals is limited,
and the fishery is yearly becoming less productive.
The Manatee, a member of the same order as the Dugong,
and an inhabitant mainly of the east coast of South America,
though found also on the west coast of Africa, is likewise
becoming greatly reduced in numbers, owing to the esteem_in
which its flesh, oil, and hide are held.


Skeletons of the Dugong and the Manatee will be found in
room No. 4. In the same room and in rooms 2 and 3 are
skeletons of various kinds of Whales and Porpoises. Among
these attention may be directed to those of the great Sperm
Whales (Physeter macrocephalus or Oatodon australis) one in room
2, and one room 3. ? When fully matured by age,? Mr. Walker
Scott says, ?the male of this gigantic race of beings is said to have
reached in length to eighty-four feet, with a girth at the largest
part of thirty-six feet.?
? The male cachalot of 60 feet long will have a pectoral fin of
about 3 feet, and a caudal one, the principal organ of progression,
of 19 feet across; in good condition such an animal will yield
about 100 barrels of oil and 12 barrels of spermaceti.?
? The teeth of aged males commonly weigh from 2 to 4 pounds
each ; the ivory of which they are composed is hard and capable
of taking a high polish ; but for commercial purposes it is held in
much less estimation than that obtained from the tusks of the
elephant.?
At the north end, above the case containing the Marsupials, is
a specimen of the Riller (Orca capensis) ?a Dolphin noted for its
ferocity and rapaciousness. Nearly over the entrance to the
Old Building are skeletons of Mesoplodon and Diplodon, small
Whales, remarkable for their long tapering beak, small narrow
but elevated head, small flippers, and the possession of two pairs
of teeth in the lower jaw and none in the upper.
The two stuffed specimens of very young Whale-bone Whales
in the collection in room 7, already referred to, were both quite
recently captured on the coast near Sydney, and were only newly
born. When adult the southern Whale-bone Whale reaches a
length of about 70 feet, and yields about 8 tons of oil and 7 cwt.
of whale bone. Formerly they used to visit the shores of
Tasmania in vast numbers aud yielded a rich harvest; but of late
years with the exception of occasional stragglers, they have com-
pletely deserted these shores.
The Seals in the same collection are specimens of the Australian
Hair-seal from the Seal Rocks north of Port Stephens. A


skeleton of the same species will be found in the room numbered
5 in the plan.
The Crocodiles belong to the two species found in Australia?
the large common Crocodile (Crocodilas hiporcatas), which never
ascends far up the rivers, but usually frequents the mangrove
flats and lagoons about their mouths; and the fresh-water
Crocodile (Philas Johnstonei) which is only found above the reach
of tidal influence in perfectly fresh water. The Australian
Crocodile is very commonly known as the Alligator; but the true
Alligator is a very different animal, and is found only in America.
The latter has the head relatively shorter and broader than the
former, and the first and fourth teeth of the lower jaw both bite
into pits in the upper, whereas in the Crocodile the first alone
bites into a pit, the fourth into a groove. A mounted skeleton of
the Crocodile will be found in room 5, and skulls of the G-avial
and the Crocodile in room 6.
The Sharks in this collection are, among others, the formidable
Rayner?s Shark or ?Tiger Shark? (Galeocerdo liayneri) , the
?Grey Nurse? (Odontaspis cineremj, and the ?Grey Shark?
(Carcharodon Rondeletii).
VII.?FOREIGN MAMMALS.
The wall-cases on the ground floor of the old building (G in plan)
are occupied mainly by a general collection of Foreign Mammalia.
The first two cases, however, contain anthropological specimens,
skulls and complete skeletons illustrating the modifications of
form which characterise different races of the human species.
The third case is occupied by skeletons of Apes and Monkeys.
Of the Apes which approach in structure nearest to Man (called
on that account Man-Apes or Anthropomorplia) there are skeletons
of the Gorilla, the Orang-Utan and the Chimpanzee. Of these
the Gorilla, according to Prof. Huxley, is the most man-like in
the proportions of the length of the leg to that of the body and
of the foot to the hand ; in the size of the heel, the curvature of
of the spine, the form of the haunch bones and the capacity of
the skull. The Orang most nearly resembles Man in having


twelve pairs of ribs instead of thirteen, as in the others ; but in
the piopoitions of the limbs and other points it differs more from
Man than the Grorilla or the Chimpanzee do. The latter
approaches Man most closely in the form of the skull, the teeth
and the proportional length of the arms.
A much lower grade, with greatly more remote resemblances to
the human skeleton, is exhibited by the skeletons of Baboons in
the same case.
A mounted specimen of a male Grorilla is in a special case at
present placed in room No. 2, but may be noticed here. The
ordinary height of the male Grorilla is from five feet two inches
to five feet eight inches, of the female about four feet six inches.
? The colour of the skin in the Grorilla, young as well as adult, is
intense black, so far as the face, breast and palms of the hands
are concerned. The fur of a grown but not aged specimen, is
iron-grey, and the individual hairs are ringed with alternate stripes
of black and grey. It is long on the arms and slopes downwards
from the shoulder to the elbow, and upwards from the wrist to
it. The head is covered with reddish-brown hair which is short
and reaches the short neck. The chest is bare in the adults and
thinly covered with hair in young males. In the female the
breast is bare and the hair elsewhere is black with a red tinge,
but is not ringed as in the male; moreover the reddish crown
which covers the scalp of the male is not apparent in the female
till she has almost become full grown. The head is large; there
is no forehead, the frontal region sloping rapidly backwards. The
eyes are deeply sunken, the immense overhanging long ridge
giving the face the expression of a constant savage scowl. The
mouth is wide and the lips are sharply cut, exhibiting no red on
the edges as in the human face. The jaws are of tremendous
weight and power. The huge eye-teeth or canines of the male
which are fully exhibited when, in his rage, he draws back his lips
and shows the red colour of the inside of his mouth, lend
additional ferocity to his aspect. In the female these teeth are
smaller. The almost total absence of neck, which gives the head
the appearance of being set into the shoulders, is due to the


backward position of the joints which fix the head to the spine,
and this allows the chin to hang over the top of the front of the
chest. The brain-case is low and compressed, and its lofty top
ridge causes the profile of the skull to describe an almost straight
line from the back part or occiput, to the ridge over the brow.
The immense development of the muscles which arise from this
ridge and the corresponding size of the jaw are evidences of the
great strength of the animal. * * * The eyes are wide apart;
and the ears which lie on a line with them are smaller than those
of man, but very much like his. In a front view of the face the
nose is flat but somewhat prominent ?more so than in any other
ape ; this is on account of a slightly projecting nose-bone very
unusual in Apes. The chest is of great capacity; the shoulders
being exceedingly broad. The abdomen is of immense size, very
prominent, and rounded at the sides. The front limbs have a
prodigious muscular development and are very long, extending
nearly as low as the knees. The forearm is nearly of uniform
size from the wrist to the elbow, and indeed the great length of
the arms and the shortness of the legs form one of the chief
differences between it and man. The arms are not long when
compared with the trunk, but they are so in comparison with the
legs. These are short and decrease in size from below the knee
to the ankle, having no calf. The hands, especially in the male,
are of large size, strong boned and thick ; the fingers are short
and broad, the circumference of the middle finger at the first joint
being five and a half inches in some Grorillas. The skin on the
back of the fingers near the middle is callous and very thick,
which shews that the usual mode of progression of the animal is
on all fours, and resting on the knuckles. The thumb is short
and not half so thick as the forefingers, which are covered with
short thin hairs. The palm of the hand is naked, callous and
intensely black. The nails are black and are shaped like those of
man, but are smaller in proportion and project very slightly
beyond the ends of the fingers. They are thick and strong and
always seem much worn. The hand of the G-orilla is almost as
wide as it is long and in these it approaches nearer to those of
man than any of the other Apes. The foot is proportionally


wider than in man ; the sole is callous and intensely black, and
looks somewhat like a giant hand of immense power and grasp.
The transverse wrinkles show the frequency and freedom of
movement of the two joints of the great toe-thumb, proving that
they have a power of grasp. The middle toe or third is longer
than the second and fourth, and that is unlike the foot in man.
The toes are divided into three groups, so to speak; inside the
great toe, outside the little toe, and the three others partly united
by a web.?
From the structure of its skeleton the Gorilla is not adapted
for the erect posture; its favourite attitude is semi-erect with the
weight partly resting on the knuckles of its long arms, and in
this way it swings itself along as with a pair of crutches. It has
been seen, however, to walk with its hands clasped across the
back of its head and when enraged it is said to stand erect beating
its huge chest with its hands. Many stories are told of its
strength and ferocity, a large proportion of which doubtless are
? travellers? tales ? ; but that it is capable of feats of great
muscular strength may readily be believed when we look at its
immense breadth of shoulder and width of chest.
The Orang-Utan or Wild Man of the Woods, (Simla satyrus ),
of which there are three specimens from Borneo in case 4, is
another of the man-like or anthropomorphic apes. ? The Orangs
all have long ruddy-brown hairs, the tinge being decidedly red, a
dark face, with small eyes, small nose and great projecting jaws.
The hair comes over the forehead and backwards over the neck ;
it is long on the limbs and points downwards on the upper
and upwards on the lower arm. It covers the back and seat, and
legs, standing out often, and gives a very wiry look to the fur.
What strikes one directly on looking at a well-stuffed specimen
of an old male for instance, is the great length of the fore-limbs,
which reach far towards the ankle, the length of the muzzle and
the extraordinary breadth of the face under the eyes, where the
flatness resembles a mask more than a natural growth. In the
females and young this growth of the cheek-bone and its covering
of fat and skin are not seen ; and it appears to be a mark of male


beauty, as are also two sets of ridges on the skull which greatly
resemble those of the Gorilla.?
Also belonging to the Man Apes are the two specimens of a
Gibbon or Wou-Wou (JBlylobates leuciscus ) from the Malay
Archipelago.
Among the Old-World Monkeys in the same case and the next
are several species of sacred apes (Semnopitbeci) distinguished by
their slender form, round heads, long tails, by the fore-limbs being
much shorter than the hind limbs ; the thumbs small, sometimes
almost rudimentary. Examples are the ? Chingkau (Semno-
pithecus cristatus) of Sumatra and Eastern Java, the Loutou ($.
maurus ) of Java, and S. entellus of India. Following these is
a specimen of the Patas ( Cercopitbecus or Chlorocebus ruber ) and
one of the Moustache Monkey ( Cercopitbecus cepbus) from
Western Africa, the Red Teetee ( Callitbrix ruber), and several
representatives of the Macaque family from India and the
Eastern Archipelago; specimens of the Baboon ( Cynocepbalus
babouin ) and Mandrill {Mormon onaimon or Papio mormon) from
Africa. The New-World Monkeys are represented by one of
the ? Howling Monkeys? {Mycetes seniculus), by Cebuellapygmcsa
or Jaccbus pygmoeus, the Pigmy Marmoset, and other species.
The Lemurs or Half-Apes are (case 6) represented by several
species? Lemur catta from Madagascar, Galago dimidoffi and G.
alleni from Africa. These Half-Apes habitually use all four
feet in locomotion like all the lower groups of Monkeys, but some
are able to hop about on their hind feet kangaroo-wise. They are
exceedingly agile climbers, and the great toe has a range of
motion enabling the animal to grasp firmly with its hind foot, but
the long tail is not prehensile. The fore-limbs are shorter than
the hind limbs. The form of the skull indicates a lower grade of
structure than that of the Monkeys?the case in which the brain
is lodged being small relatively to the face ; the brain itself is of
much simpler structure than in most of the Monkeys. A
remarkable peculiarity of the Lemurs is the presence of a sort of
fringe or frill situated on the floor of the mouth in front of the
tongue. The head quarters of the Lemurs is the island of


Madagascar; but members oï¿½ the family are to be found also on
the continent of Africa and in some of the islands of the East-
Indian Archipelago. Some subsist on fruits, many are insect-
eating and some prey upon small birds.
The following seven cases are taken up by the order Carnivora :
The seventh and eighth cases are occupied by skeletons of
Carnivora-Lions, Tigers, Dogs, the Eacoon, the Coati, the
Mongoose. In the seventh case there are also two specimens of
the skeleton of that remarkable animal the Hyrax (order Hyra-
coidea) one of the two species of which ( Hyrax syrincus ) seems
to have been the ? coney ? of the Old Testament.
The ninth case contains skins of the Leopard, Lion, Bengal
Tiger and the Lynx ; the tenth contains a Leopard, the Chaus,
smaller Cats, Civets, and the spotted Hyaena of Africa.
In case JNo. 11 is a specimen of the Sun-Bear or Bruang
(Helarctos malayanus) , a native of the Malay Peninsula and the
islands of Java, Sumatra and Borneo ; and one of the Polar Bear
cTJialassarctos maritimus ). In the same case are also specimens
of the European Badger ( Meles taxus ) and the American Eacoon
(Procyon lotor ). In the next case (12), is a specimen of the
common Brown Bear of Europe (found also in Siberia,
Kamtschatka, Japan, and the Arctic regions of North America).
The same case also contains two members of the Dog family?
the Black-Backed Jackal of the Cape of Good Hope (Canis
mesomelas) and the Jackal or Kolah ( Canis aureus) of Asia and
the Js orth of Africa. In case 13 are the remainder of the specimens
of the Dog family, the common Fox ( Vulpes vulgaris) the Eacoon
Dog of Japan (Nyctereutes procyonoides) the Arctic Fox ( Vulpes
lagopus ) and various varieties of the Domestic Dog.
The fourteenth case contains a specimen of the European Otter;
and the smaller carnivora such as the Genett ( Qenetta tigrina ),
the Stoat or Ermine (Putorius erminea) a native of the Northern
portions of all three Northern Continents, the Ferret ( Putorius
furo), the Pole-Cat (Putorius fcetidusj, the Weasel (Mustela or
Putorius vulgaris), the Beech Marten (Mustela foina), the


Mongoose ( Herpestesgriseus) , the Brown Mongoose or Ichneumon
(Herpestes paludosus), and the Garangau {Herpestes javanicus).
In the same case are the only representatives in the collection
of the order Insectivora?the common European Mole {Talpa
Europad) the Hedge-hog {Erinaceus europaeus ) the G-olden Mole
(Chrgsochloris capensis) of the Cape of Good Hope, and the
European Harden Shrew {Crocidura aranea) ; also the Bats and
? Flying Foxes,? comprising the order Cheiroptera.
The following six cases are devoted to the Ungulata or Hoofed
Animals ?an order which includes the Horses, Rhinoceri, lapiis,
Deer, Antelopes, Oxen, Sheep, Camels, Llamas, Pigs, Hippopotami
etc. All these have the last toe-hones invested with a horny hoof
which takes the place of the nail of most other mammals, and the
weight usually rests entirely on the tips of the toes, only one or
two of which are usually developed in each foot. The HorseSj
Rhinoceri and Tapirs have the third toe in each foot central and
symmetrical, and the toes of the hind foot odd in number, whence
the name Perissodactyla or odd-toed hoofed-animals. Of these
only specimen in the present collection is the Tapir. The
rest have the third and fourth toes of each foot forming a sym-
metrical pair, and the toes of the hind feet even in number;
hence they are called the Artiodactyla or even-toed Hoofed
Animals. The fifteenth case contains skeletons of Hoofed
Animals of the Even-Toed subdivision, Deers, Gazelles, Goats,
&c. In the sixteenth case are mounted skins of the Roe-Deer
{Capreolus caprceus), the Axis or Spotted Deer {A.xis maculata) of
India and Antelopes ; and in the seventeenth and eighteenth
various species of Indian and African Antelopes and the Chamois
{Rupicapra tragus) of the Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus and
Carpathian Mountains. In the sixteenth case are exhibited
specimens of the remarkable little Javanese Chevrotain {Tragulus
javanicus) frequently, though quite erroneously, termed the Musk
Deer ?the true Musk-Deer being a very different animal; the
Chevrotains differ from the ordinary Deer and Antelopes, among
other points, in the absence of horns in both sexes and the
possession of prominent canine teeth. In the nineteenth case


are specimens of the Llama of South America, a member of the
same group of Hoofed Animals ( Tylopoda ) to which the Camels
belong ; and in the same case are skeletons of the wild boar and
the New Guinea Pig, and skulls of the Babirussa, a wild hog of the
islands of Borneo and Celebes.
In case 20 are stuffed specimens of the Wild Boar, the Collared
Peccary and the New Guinea Pig. For a skeleton of the
Hippopotamus see room 3. In the same case are likewise
specimens of the South American and the East Indian Tapir?
the only representatives of the odd-toed Hoofed Animals at
present in the collection. The Tapirs are pig-like animals with a
long snout, four toes in the front and three in the hind feet, each
provided with a small hoof; they are nocturnal, taking refuge
in the densest parts of the forests during the day-time and
emerging at night to feed, and are very expert swimmers. Besides
the two species ( Tapirus americanus and Tapirus Malay anus)
represented (the former by a very young specimen) in the
collection, a third species ( Tapirus villosus or the Hairy Tapir) is
found in South America.
In the twenty-first case is a stuffed specimen of a young
Elephant and the skull of a Ehinoceros.
The twenty-second and twenty-third cases contain the repre-
sentatives of the order Eodentia or Gnawers?the Scjuirrels,
Marmots, Beavers, Eats and Mice, Guinea Pigs, Hares and
Eabbits?all distinguished by their prominent chisel-like front
teeth.
In the twenty-fourth case, are specimens of the order
Edentata, Sloths, Armadillos, and Ant-Eaters. The members of
this order are most abundant in South America, but one or two
are found in South Africa and in Asia. At a former geological
period South America was populated by gigantic members of this
group, a cast of the skeleton of one of which?the Megatherium
?forms a prominent object in the centre of the New Building.
The Sloths are exclusively natives of South America. They
are arboreal animals, rarely touching the ground save to pass from
one tree to another. To this mode of life their structure is


peculiarly adapted, the middle fingers and toes being provided
with long curved claws, two or three in the front, and always three
in the hind feet, which form very efficient hooks, by means of
which the sloth climbs or rests body downwards. The collection
includes specimens both of the three-toed and of the two-toed
forms.
Another group of the order Edentata is the Ant-Eaters, repre-
sented in the collection by the Tamandua, the Little Ant-Eater,
and the Scaly Ant-Eater.
Of these the Scaly Ant-Eaters or Pangolins, which are found
in Africa and in Asia, are perhaps the most remarkable, having
the body covered with overlapping horny scales, and all having
the claws of the front foot bent under so that the weight of the
body rests partly on the dorsal surface of those, but mainly on
the soles of the hind feet, which rest flat on the ground. The
specimen in the case is the G-reat Manis or Pangolin ( Pholidotus
or Manis giganteus) a native of West Africa.
The South American Ant-Eaters on the other hand have no
horny scales, but are clothed with fur, and the front foot rests on
its outer edge in walking. Eepresenting this group is a stuffed
specimen of the Little Ant-eater ( Myrmecophaga didactgla ) and
a skeleton of the Great Ant-Eater {Myrmecophaga jubata) .
The Armadilloes are another very interesting family of this
curious order, having the body covered with a bony armour
formed of movable shields or bands of bony plates which are
differently arranged in the different genera and species. The
only species represented in the collection is the Peba ( Tatusia
or Pasypus peba ) a species of wide range, occurring in Texas,
Mexico, Central America, Guiana, Brazil and Paraguay; a
skeleton of the same is shewn beside it.
In the same case is a specimen of the Crab-Eating Opossum ?
representing the American family of Marsupials, the Didelphidse,
or true Opossums. The American Opossums resemble the
Australian Opossums or Phalangers in their arboreal habits, in
the possession of long prehensile tails and in having the inner


toe oï¿½ the hind foot capable of acting thumb-like against the
others so as to enable the animal to grasp firmly ; but in their
diet, which is mainly of animal nature, their teeth, and many
other points, they differ entirely from the Phalaugers.
FOREIGN BIRDS.
In the wall-cases in the gallery of the old building (12) are
arranged the foreign birds. The Diurnal Birds of Prey ?Eagles,
Vultures, Ealcons, Kestrels, Hawks, Kites?are arranged in the
cases along the west half of the north wall. [The names of the
orders are placed over the cases]. Among those attention may be
called to the Griffon Vulture of Southern Europe {Gyps fulvus)
the Black Vulture (Vultur monarchus) of Africa, and the great
American Condor ( Sarcorliamphusgryphus ), which attains a length
of three and a half feet; to the Secretary Bird (Serpentarius
secretarius or & reptilivorus) of Africa, noted for its snake-killing
habits, the Goshawk {Astur palumbarius) of Northern Europe
and Asia, the European Sparrow-Hawk (Accipiter nisus), the

INVERTEBRATA.
The collections of shells are at present being re-arranged in
rooms Nos. 7 and 10; the principal portion is the Hargraves?
Collection, purchased by Mr. Thos. Walker of Yaralla, from
Mr. Hargraves by whom they were collected, for presentation
to the Australian Museum. The specimens which belong to this
collection will have ? Hargraves? Coll.? marked upon them. As
the arrangement of these collections is not very far advanced at
the time of writing this Guide, it will be impossible to say more
at present with regard to their disposition. A Catalogue of the
whole will be issued when the work of arrangement is completed.
The Insects are at present placed in the Old Building (No. 6)
in two long cases running along the centre of the room. The
case placed nearest the door contains the collections of foreign
Coleoptera (beetles) and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and
the general collections (Australian and foreign) of Orthoptera
(grasshoppers, locusts, etc.), Diptera (flies &c.) Neuroptera
(Dragon-flies &c.), Hemiptera (bugs, etc.), and Hymenoptera
(bees, wasps, etc). The other case contains the Australian
collections of Coleoptera (beetles), and Lepidoptera (butterflies
and moths). It is likely that the Insects will shortly be removed
to No. 7.
The Spiders and Scorpions are placed in a case in room No. 7
(upper floor of New Building) together with the Centipedes and
Millepedes.
The collection of Crustacea (Australian and foreign) will be
found in room 9. A catalogue of the Australian Crustacea has
recently been issued by the Trustees. In the same room are the
collections of Echinodermata (Sea-urchins, Star-fishes, etc.) the
Bryozoa and Zoophytes, glass models of Zoophytes, the Sponges,
and a collection of models of Eoramiuifera. The corals will be
found in room No. 7.
TYPE COLLECTION.
In the end room north in the upper floor of the New Building
(No. 9) is placed a type collection or educational collection illus-


trating zoology and comparative anatomy. At present this is
incomplete; but it will be found very useful to those making a
general study of these subjects. It is made up largely of
European specimens having been imported from Germany. The
following notes are intended for students making use of the
ordinary text-books of Zoology.
To begin with the lowest forms shewn, the class Spongida or
Sponges is represented (I) by a section of the common Turkey
sponge ( Spongia officinalis ), shewing the arrangement of the
fibrous skeleton of the sponge, (2) by a fibrous sponge ( Suberifes
domuncula ) interstices in which are occupied by a Hermit Crab,
(3) by Tethea lyncurium , another of the Fibrous Sponges, and
(4) by Spongilla fluviatilis the common English Fresh-water
Sponge.
The next class in ascending order ?the Hydrozoa, or Zoophytes
and Jelly-Fishes is illustrated by spirit specimens and glass
models of Jelly-Fishes (order Acalephae ), by Oceania pileata and
JEquorea ForsJcaliana, which are medusiform gonophores, the
first of one of the Hydroida Gymnoblastea, the second of one of
the Hydroida Calyptoblastea; by Sertularia myriophyllum and
Campanularia of the Calyptoblastic Hydroida, shewing the horny
skeleton of the polype-colony or zoarium, consisting of branching
tubes bearing a series of cups or hydrothecae in which the polypes
are contained ; by the Portuguese Man of War ( Physalia ) one
of the Siphonophora (suborder Physophora) shewing the bladder
like dilatation of the proximal end of the caenosarc (the pneumato-
phore), with its contained air-sac, the hydranths attached to the
under surface of the caenosarc and the long thread-like feelers ;
by Porpita , another of the Siphonophora (suborder Discoidea),
shewing the flat disk-like shape of the caenosarc with the
chambered disk-like float or pneumatophore on its upper surface,
the series of hydranths attached to its under surface, and the
circlet of tentacles round the margin; and by Velella, an
example of the same order as Porpita, but distinguished from it
by the possession of the delicate vertical plate arising from the
upper surface of the pneumatophore.


The class Actinozoa is represented in great part by glass
models of sea-anemones and corals. A specimen in spirits of an
Actinia and a large series of glass-models illustrate the family of
the Actinidse or Sea-Anemones, a family of the Zoantharia
Malacodermata, shewing the short fleshy cylinder without skeleton
of any kind composing the body, the circlets of tentacles sur-
rounding the mouth, and the broad sucker-like base of attach-
ment. The model of Zoanfhus Crouchii represents the sub-family
Zoanthinï¿½ of the Actininï¿½, in which the anthozooid, in place of
remaining solitary as in the case of the ordinary sea-anemones,
gives off buds which form a branching colony of anthozooids
connected by a soft coenosarc. The family Cerianthidï¿½ is repre-
sented by the models of Ilyanthus scoticus, Geriantlms Lloydii 0.
membranaceus and Edwardsia callimorpha, shewing the two circlets
of tentacles and the pointed hinder extremity without a sucker-
like base.
The models of Balanophyllia italica, Garyophyllia Smithii,
Gladocora caespitosa and Bendrophyllia ramea represent the true
hard corals, the Zoantharia sclerodermata, in which the body-wall
of the anthozooids and the connecting cï¿½nosarc (in the compound
forms) is strengthened by carbonate of lime.
All the above-mentioned specimens and models of Actinozoa
belong to the sub-division Zoantharia. The Alcyonaria, with
fringed tentacles and with the mesenteries and tentacles in
multiples of eight, are represented by models of the Eed Coral
(Corallium rubrum), the organ-pipe coral ( Tupipora ), and by
spirit specimens of Pennatula rubra , Alcyonium pahnatum and
Seripularia.

represented by Gucumaria pentactes and Holothuria tubulosa ; the
Echinoidea by Echinus saxatilis, the Asteroidea by Asteracanthion
qlacialis and Asteriscus palmipes, the Ophiuroidea by Ophiolepis
ciliata and the Crinoidea by Comatula mediterranea.

bepaticaj the liver-fluke, which is the cause of the disease known
as ? rot ? in sheep, Tristoma sturionis, a parasite of the sturgeon,
and Diplozoon paradoxum, a parasite on the gills of numerous
fresh-water fishes, remarkable as being formed of two individuals
united to form a double animal.

of stages in the development of the Frog, and by models in wax
shewing the same on an enlarged scale. Of the latter which are
placed on a glass shelf in the centre of the case No. 1:
I. Eepresents the unimpregnated egg, shewing the darker
and lighter halves, with the ? foggy mark ? in the centre of the
former.
2. ?A section of the egg before segmentation has commenced,
shewing the nucleus and the yolk-spheres.
8. ?A section of the egg shewing the penetration ofits substance
by the spermatozoon.
4. ?Section shewing the spermatozoon and the egg-nucleus or
germinal vesicle in the act of coalescing.
5. ?Section shewing the first appearance of the process of
segmentation, the germinal vesicle having become divided into
two and a cleft having made its appearance partially dividing
the substance of the egg into two halves.
6. ?The whole egg shewing the complete extension of the cleft
round the egg and the consequent division of the egg into two
halves or blastomeres.
7. ?The next stage in the process of segmentation?the egg
divided into four blastomeres by subdivision of the two primary
blastomeres.
8. ?A further stage; eight blastomeres formed, the four on the
dark side of the egg much smaller than the four on the light side.
9,10, and 11. ?Successive stages in the process of segmentation.
12. ?The morula or mulberry mass resulting from the process
of segmentation, consisting of a mass of cells of which those
situated on the light side are larger than those on the dark side
of the egg.
13. ?A vertical mesial section through the egg at a somewhat
later stage shewing the blastocoele or cleavage-cavity with the
first trace, indicated by a faint groove coloured pink, of the


invagination, or rather cleft, which subsequently forms the enteron,
beginning near the circumference of the white area.
14 and 15.?Sections shewing the further growth inwards of
the invagination.
16. ?Section to shew the encroachment of the primitive enteron
upon the blastoccele and the diminution of the latter.

altogether disappeared and the enteron has assumed a large size.
The neural groove has made its appearance on the dorsal aspect
of the egg.
18. ?Section shewing a further stage in the development of
the central portion of the nervous system; the lips of the neural
groove are growing up on either side of it. The notochord
(coloured white) is now being formed from the mesoblast below
the neural groove.
19. ?Yertical mesial section through the embryo at a somewhat
later stage. The lips of the neural groove have now united along
the middle line above so as to convert the neural groove into a
canal lined by epiblast cells (coloured pink) from which the
substance cf the brain and spinal cord has now begun to be
developed.
20. ?A similar section at a later stage. The embryo is now
much elongated. The neural canal has become widely dilated in
front, and the dilatation has begun to be divided into three
portions representing the fore-mid- and hind-brain. The mouth
is beginning to be formed, but does not yet communicate with the
cavity of the enteron.
21. ?Model of the entire embryo at a later stage, shewing the
rudimentary mouth and nostrils, gill-clefts and eyes.
22. ?Early tadpole stage with external gills.
23. ?Later tadpole stage; the external gills aborted and

the front of the face displaying some of the facial muscles, nerves
and blood vessels. The facial muscles shewn are the orbicularis
palpebrarum (?*) with its internal tendon (w) attached to the
inner angle of the orbit, the superciliaris ( s ), the pyramidalis
nasi ( pn ), the levator alse nasi ( p ) and the compressor narium(y).
Within the cavity of the orbit is represented the left half of the
eyeball with the nerves and muscles in connection with it. The

sclerotic, continuous in front with the transparent cornea and
forming a sheath for the optic nerve (Z); the choroid (c) connected
firmly in front with the iris (/) with its circular aperture ?the
pupil. On the surface of the choroid are represented the ciliary
arteries and nerves and the vasa vorticosa. Within the capsule
formed by the choroid and sclerotic are shewn the vitreous
humour with,in front of it and behind the iris, the crystalline lens;
behind the iris are represented the ciliary processes. Internal
to the choroid are represented the several layers of the retina.
ETHNOLOGY.
Owing to lack of space not many ethnological specimens are
at present on exhibition ; but examples from some collections
recently purchased will be found in rooms 7 and 10. These
consist of various articles of dress and ornament worn by the
natives of New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Admiralties,
etc., with their cooking utensils, apparatus for betel chewing,
cava-bowls, tobacco-pipes, musical instruments, canoe-paddles,
tomahawks and weapons. There are also a series of casts of
some rare New Zealand weapons, etc., and a collection of pre-


historic stone implements from Europe. It is to be hoped that
before long accommodation will be provided for the systematic
display of a more complete series of ethnological specimens, for,
though the whole of the very extensive and valuable ethnological
collections of the Museum, includiug many objects which can
never be replaced, were destroyed in the fire of the Garden
Palace, (where they were about to be exhibited for lack of proper
accommodation in the Museum itself ) a considerable number of
specimens are now being got together again and remain stored
away for the present.*
MINERALS.
The second room south in the first floor of the New Building
(11 in plan) contains the general collection of minerals and a
special collection of rocks. This collection was purchased for
the Museum some years ago by Professor Liversidge during a visit
to Europe, and contains a large number of carefully selected and
valuable specimens, some of them almost unrivalled. To examine
the collection systematically, the visitor should begin with th:
cases placed against the wall on the left-hand side of the entrance-
Eirst come the minerals formed of carbon including diamond,
graphite, coal, lignite, &c. The largest specimens of graphite or
black lead, so largely used in the manufacture of pencils, are in
special cases on the opposite side of the room. They are from
Ceylon ; but in the same case is a smaller specimen from the
celebrated graphite mine at Borrowdale in Cumberland. The
discoverer of deposits of good graphite in New South Wales
would speedily enrich himself, as the mineral is of considerable
commercial value. In the same case as one of the large specimens
of graphite are specimens of torbanite, a variety of cannel coal,
used for making mineral lamp oils &c. Eeturning again to the
left-hand (east) side of the room, among other carbon compounds
will be seen specimens of bitumen or asphalt, and ozokerit or
* It is likely that before this edition of the Guide is exhausted, the
Ethnological specimens will be arranged in the gallery of the Old Building
(12), taking the place at present occupied by the foreign birds, which will
be placed in room No. 10.


mineral wax, the former employed extensively for paving, the
latter consisting chiefly of solid paraffin and used in the manu-
facture of candles ; and specimens of amber ?a fossil resin?so
largely used in the manufacture of pipes and fancy articles,
and found in nodules of various sizes in brown-coal formations ;
one of the specimens encloses the remains of insects. Next to
these are the boron minerals. The sulphur specimens follow
the boron ; some of the finest specimens are from Gfirgenti in
Sicily, in which island the most productive sulphur mines occur;
another specimen is associated with the rather rare element
selenium. Following the sulphur are the minerals composed of
silica. These include the specimens of crystallized quartz or
rock crystal ?some of them being of the ?drusy? variety, i.e.
containing cavities filled with liquid ; also the amethyst which
is a variety of quartz coloured with binoxide of manganese;
aventurine, a form of quartz impregnated with mica, and often
imitated artificially by glass impregnated with small particles
of copper ; agates, onyxes, and opals, all of which are much
employed as ornamental stones.
The next cases contain the silicates, which are compounds of
silicic acid or silica with various bases ?soda, potash, lime,
magnesia, alumina, iron, &c. Of these attention may be directed
to a large specimen of meerschaum, which is a hydrated silicate
of magnesia. This mineral is obtained in various parts of
Europe, but most largely in Asia Minor, and its principal use ?
for the manufacture of pipes?is well known ;it occurs in veins
and nodules in serpentine rocks, and when first dug out is soft
and lathers like soap. Asbestos, which is a silicate of magnesia
and lime, is remarkable for its fibrous structure, which has enabled
it to be used for weaving fire-proof garments, for the packing
of engines, and for various other purposes in connection with the
arts; its properties were known to the ancients, by whom it
was used for the manufacture of napkins which could be cleansed
by being thrown into the fire, and for wicks for lamps in the
temples. Next to these are specimens of jade, a mineral much
used in making ornamental articles. Among the felspars the
moonstone (adularia) specimens may also be specially noticed as


an ornamental stone, reflecting the light in a peculiar manner,
producing a pearly play of colour not unlike the lustre of the
moon, which has given origin to the common name of the stone.
In the same class attention may be directed to the specimens
of labradorite, the finest of which is on a special pedestal near the
centre of the room. This is a highly ornamental stone, taking
a fine polish, the surface displaying beautiful prismatic hues.
Amazon stone, another felspar, also used for ornamental
purposes, is represented by some unusually large crystals.
Following upon those are the different varieties of garnets,
the almandine being well known as a jewel-stone, and fine prisms
of epidote. To these succeed the zeolites , hydrous silicates of
alumina, and often alkalies and alkaline earths, usually found in
interstices of igneous rocks, such as basalts, from whose decompo-
sition they are derived. Chlorite, which is a hydrous magnesian
silicate, is very often found associated with magnetic iron.
Muscovite or mica is a nearly transparent silicate of alumina and
potash, which takes the form of exceedingly thin transparent
layers, formerly used in place of window-glass or as a substitute
for horn in lanterns, now employed for lamp-reflectors and the
fronts of gas stoves, and still used in place of window-glass in
the Russian navy, being tough and not liable to fracture by the
concussion of powerful guns. To these succeed the emeralds,
aquamarines, a magnificent specimen of beryl, one of the largest
in the world, and the zircons. Then comes topaz and red
tourmaline (rubellite), both valued as gem stones ; a particularly
fine specimen of the latter in the British Museum is valued at
ï¿½IOOO. The common tourmaline is also used as a gem stone,
but is more valuable on account of its optical properties?its
power of polarizing light. Near these is a fine specimen of lapis
lazuli, also used in the manufacture of jewellery and mosaics,
and formerly used for the production of ultramarine, which is
now manufactured artificially.
Following the silicate is a case of various kinds of salts
from Stassfurth ; then comes the chloride of sodium or rock
salt, a very fine specimen of which is placed in a special case
further round to the right; the specimens of baryta, a mineral


used largely to adulterate white lead; celestine (sulphate of
strontia), so named from the blue tint which it frequently
assumes ?a mineral from which the substance used to produce
the red light in fireworks is derived. To these succeed the com-
pounds of lime, comprising choice specimens of calcite, fluor-spar,
selenite, anhydrite and apatite. A fine violet variety of fluor-spar
called ?Blue John? is much used in the manufacture of orna-
mental articles. Its principal uses in the arts are as a flux for
lead, and in the manufacture of hydrofluoric acid for etching on
glass. If we look through a crystal of fluor-spar it will appear
yellow or green ; but if we look at it in such a way that the light
is reflected it will appear blue or purple ; this phenomenon is
known as fluorescence and is exhibited by some other substances,
such as a solution of sulphate of quinine. The massive variety
of selenite is known as alabaster, and is much employed for the
manufacture of ornamental vases and the like. The finer varieties
of anhydrite are used for a similar purpose. Apatite where it
occurs in quantities sufficient to be systematically worked is a
mineral of considerable value for the manufacture of artificial
manure.
In one of the special higher cases is a group of remarkably
large crystals of Iceland-spar, and in another is one of the largest
crystals of apatite that have ever been discovered. Then come
the metallic minerals.
Among the zinc minerals are particularly fine specimens of
calamine (carbonate of zinc), and smithsonite (silicate of zinc) ;
also of zinc-blende or Black Jack, which is the chief English ore
of this metal. This ore occurs chiefly in association with galena,
in veins in the carboniferous and magnesian limestones. Zinc is
now largely imported into the United Kingdom from the United
States, where the principal ore is calamine. Next to these are
the manganese minerals, the principal being pyrolusite; man-
ganese is used in the manufacture of chlorine for bleaching
powder, in the manufacture of flint-glass, black enamel for
pottery and Bessemer steel, and in calico printing. A large
specimen of pyrolusite is shewn in a special case placed against
the west wall of the room. A specimen of rhodonite, which


is a silicate oï¿½ manganese, exhibits the beautiful pink hue
which renders it valuable for ornamental purposes. The iron
minerals come next, the first specimens being examples of meteoric
iron which is an alloy chiefly of iron and nickel. Near it are
the long silky crystals of sulphate of iron much resembling
asbestos. Specimens of magnetic iron ore, a widely distributed
mineral, come next, and are followed by haematite or sesquioxide
of iron from Cumberland, (specular iron ore), goethite, and
limonite, or brown haematite. Of the last named mineral there
are shewn various pseudomorphic specimens which have been
chemically altered from iron pyrites, though still retaining
the form of the latter mineral, and a specimen altered from
siderite and retaining its crystalline form. After these are
the specimens of iron-pyrites or sulphide of iron, which always
contains a certain proportion of gold, and sometimes a large
amount; the principal use of iron pyrites is for the manufacture
of sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol. Another ore of iron is chalybite,
also called siderite, or carbonate of iron, represented by several
good specimens. But the most important variety of siderite
extensively used in England for the manufacture of iron and steel
is the common and compact variety occuringin the coal measures,
and known as sphcerosiderite and black-band.
To the iron succeeds cobalt, of which metal there are
specimens of the ores cobaltine and smaltine. Oxide of cobalt is
extensively used as a blue pigment in the arts. The compounds
of nickel follow, such as Noumeaite, a hydrated silicate of nickel
and magnesia, from New Caledonia, originally described by Prof.
Liversidge ; pimelite another silicate ; millerite, the sulphide &c.
In the arsenides and sulphides nickel is found usually associated
with cobalt, and the two metals have to be separated bv an
elaborate process ; this is not the case, however, with the New
Caledonian nickel ores which are nearly free from cobalt, whilst
the cobalt ores of the same country are free from nickel. Next
are the compounds of tin, with specimens of different forms of
stream tin and lode tin from the Cornish mines, and specimens
shewing the different stages in the preparation of the metallic


tin from the ore. The Cornish stream tin is now nearly worked
out, and the main source of English tin is from the lodes,
but the Australian workings now produce an abundant supply.
The presence of tin in Australia was predicted by the Rev. W. B.
Clarke, the well-known geologist, as far back as 1849, and he
actually discovered the ore near the Severn River in 1853.
It is, however, only comparatively recently that the extent of
the tin deposits of Australia has been discovered, and the working
of the ore prosecuted with vigour. In 1881 8,200 tons of tin,
with a total value of ï¿½724,000, were produced in New South
Wales. The principal districts for Australian tin are in the
northern districts of New South Wales, and the southern parts
of Queensland, Mount Bischoff in Tasmania, and various districts
in Victoria. Among the titanium minerals will be observed
natural and artificial crystals of rutile, anatase and titanite or
sphene ; also iserine or titaniferous iron.
A very important ore is chrome iron ore or chromite, its most
important use is for manufacturing the yellow chromate and the
red dichromate of potash used in dyeing. It is also used in
small proportion for preparing hard qualities of steel. It is
now shipped from New Zealand and New Caledonia in large
quantities. Wolfram or tungstate of iron and manganese is often
mistaken for tinstone, which, however, gives a grey streak, while
the wolfram gives one of a reddish-brown colour. It is frequently
associated with tin ores, but is never very abundant. One of
its uses is in the manufacture of tungstate of soda, which gives
hardness to plaster of Paris, is used as a mordant for dyers, and
is also employed to make dress materials and stage scenery incom-
bustible, and for hardening steel. The metal tungsten is used in
certain alloys. Pitchblende is an ore of uranium, occurring
in veins with ores of lead and silver in Saxony, and with tin in
Cornwall. Zippeite is a sulphate of uranium.
Next to these are the compounds of arsenic. Orpiment is a
compound of arsenic and sulphur found in Hungary, the Hartz
Mountains, &c.; it is used as a yellow pigment. Realgar, which is
of similar composition, occurs in veins in crystalline rocks, and in


volcanic districts, or in the shape of stalactites in fissures and rents
of volcanos; its chief use is for fireworks ; but most of the realgar
that is used is produced artificially. Near these is a specimen
of mispickel or arsenical pyrites, generally found in Australia
associated with gold. Following this are the specimens of
antimony ore, a mineral found extensively about the Clarence
River and New England districts, and also in Victoria, and very
abundantly in Borneo.
The bismuth specimens come next, including native bismuth
and various compounds. Native bismuth is worth about 15s. a
pound ; the metal is used for the manufacture of various alloys
(fusible metal, soft solder, etc.,) but the demand for it is limited.
It has been found and worked in various parts of this Colony,
Among the lead-specimens attention may be directed to
specimens of native lead, of cerussite or carbonate of lead, and
galena or sulphide of lead, which is the principal ore of the
metal. Galena is a very common and widely distributed mineral,
found in abundance in some parts of Australia, as well as in
almost every other part of the world; it very often contains a
large proportion of silver, which may frequently be profitably
extracted from it. In 1881 the quantity of lead produced in New
South Wales was 52 tons 14 cwt., with a total value of ï¿½5,025.
Next to the galena are large crystals of anglesite, which is a
sulphate of lead; also cotunnite or chloride of lead, crocoisite
or chromate of lead, bournonite or sulphide of antimony, lead,
and copper, and boulangerite, which is a sulphide of antimony
and lead. Tfcï¿½* copper specimens come next; native copper,
which is found in immense quantities near Lake Superior, being
represented by some fine specimens ; red oxide or plush copper,
langite or hydrated sulphate, malachite or carbonate, one of the
ores of copper, and often used for ornamental articles, copper
pyrites or sulphide, and other copper minerals.
The mercury specimens are not numerous; they include an
interesting specimen of a cry.-tal of native amalgam of mercury
and silver, a specimen of cinnabar, the sulphide of mercury, the
principal ore of the metal. There is also a piece of amalgam with


a curious history, from a Chilian mine, it having been taken from
the stomach of a mule which had eaten it for the sake of the salt
mixed with it during the process of manufacture. Then follow
specimens of native silver and the various silver ores. The
specimens of native tellurium are unusually large, this metal,
which was formerly not uncommon in Transylvania and was
valued for the gold it contained, being now very rare; the largest
piece in the collection cost ï¿½2B, though it weighs only two ounces.
Other specimens of tellurium minerals are the nagyagite, a
telluride of lead and gold, and the sylvanite which is a telluride
of gold and silver?both being minerals of great rarity and value.
The gold specimens are not numerous, but include one or
two rare specimens, such as the specimen of native gold from
Hungary, consisting of a mass of wire-like crystals ; Australian
gold as a rule forms large crystals, but a variety like the
Hungarian is found in Queensland. There is also a small gold
nugget from Ballarat crystallised in an irregular octahedron, and
some crystallised specimens of gold from New Caledonia, in fern-
like dendrites and in the shape of, rods formed of elongated
octahedrons. As gold occurs rarely in calcite, a specimen from
the Lucky Hit, Tuena, where gold exhibits that mode of occur-
ence, has been added to this collection.
A rare specimen is the crystal of native platinum placed next
the gold specimens ; near it is a nugget of platinum from the
Ural Mountains. The chief value of platinum in commerce is
dependent on the difficulty with which it fuses and its insolubility
in strong acids, on account of which property it is used for
crucibles and for other purposes in chemical and physical
laboratories. It is found in Australia in minute quantities
generally associated with gold, sometimes also with iridium and
osmium.
The following two cases contain the collection of gems. In
that placed farthest from the door are arranged at the left-hand
end a collection of imitation gems. Next to these area series of
rough uncut gems. These are succeeded by specimens of the
silica gems,?rock-crystal, amethyst (a pink variety of rock-


crystal), cairngorm (a variety oï¿½ smoky quartz), citrine and opals.
Among the last are some specimens oï¿½ precious opal from this
Colony. To these succeed the garnets, the fine blood-red or
cherry-red varieties of which are highly esteemed as gems;
essonite and cinnamon stones are varieties of the same stone ;
iolite or dichroite is remarkable for the difference of colour which
it presents when viewed in different directions. Then follow the
specimens of sphene, chrysolite and zircon, turquoise, cinnamon
stone, crocidolite, spodumene, moonstone, peridote, bronzite,
hypersthene, and obsidian , and in the next division of the case
tourmaline, axinite and rubellite, phenacite, emerald, aquamarine,
beryl, topaz, spinel, sapphire, ruby, and diamond. The other
case contains specimens of agates, onyxes, rock-crystal, jasper
and carnelian cut into various ornamental forms. A number of
specimens of ornamental articles, vases, candlesticks, paper-
weights, etc., made out of fluorspar, agate, carnelian, jasper,
chalcedony, alabaster, malachite, steatite, serpentine, jade and
rhodonite, are arranged in two special cases at the entrance to
the room. Along the east wall of the room are arranged a series
of slabs of different varieties of ornamental marbles and
serpentines. On the opposite side in the table cases running
along the wall is a collection of Italian rocks and minerals.
A second collection of minerals is arranged in table cases in
the old building (No. 6); this contains some Australian as well
as foreign specimens; and beside it is a-collection of Australian
and foreign rocks, the former of which, however, have not yet
been thoroughly analysed and determined.
A catalogue of all these mineral collections is being prepared
and will shortly be published.
FOSSILS.
In the gallery of the old building (No. 12 in plan), is a large
collection of European and American fossils, which have been
arranged stratigraphically, i. e. according to the age of the strata
in which they were found. Beginning with the case labelled
? Cambrian and Silurian,? and passing round to the right the non-


scientific visitor will be enabled to realize to some extent the
nature oï¿½ the life that has prevailed on the earth during the
successive periods of geological history from the earliest begin-
nings of life to the present time. A catalogue of this collection
of fossils has been issued, with a general introduction pointing out
some of its principal features, so that it will be unnecessary to
say anything further about it here.
In room 5 is a large collection of Australian Post Tertiary
fossils, chiefly obtained from the limestone caves at Wellington,
where the remains of so many extinct animals have been discovered.
The collection consists of bones of different extinct species of
marsupials, some of them, such as the large kangaroos and
w T ombats, nearly related to existing forms ; while others, as for
instance the Diprotodon, the Nototherium and the Thylacoleo, are
very unlike any forms now living, and, in the case especially of
the Diprotodon, attained a gigantic size. In the same room are
placed the remains of the large, extinct, ostrich-like New Zealand
birds ?the Moas ?which lived in New Zealand at a comparatively
recent period.
