I CF THE P^ V '"~
Do you know the little Aborigines ?
They are such quaint wee people
with chubby black faces
I that will not come white
however much they are washed.
Their fuzzy black hair is so like a mop;
I and their dark, dark eyes Just twinkle.
They have such funny little ways too.
Just peep Inside this book and you
will see Fuzzy Head and Woolly Top, and
I learn of the queer, queer things they do.

? Here is my canoe, Woolly Top!
Do you like it?
I made it of one piece of bark,
From the trunk of a gum-tree.
-
I Get in and we shall go fishing.
I know some little fish live In this lagoon.
Now I will stand up and hold my
spear ready to catch one.
Whisper to me if you see any.
Oo, sh-h-h! I think one is here; see
the leaves moving on the water!
Look, Woolly Top! Now you shall
have some dinner.?

? Woolly Top! we have no fire to cook
our fish, what shall we do??
| ?Oh, / can make a fire, Fuzzy Head.
You put some downy bulrush in the crack
of this dry log.
There, that will do.
Now I will hit the log hard, with this
straight dry stick. Whack 11
See, the stick split right down the middle.
Now, I will saw?saw?saw with the sharp
edge on the log; Just watch ! ?
? See, Woolly Top, the down is smoking.
1 Look, it's alight! It?s alight!
can cook our fish now.?

? i am so sleepy, Woolly Top.
Mr. Sun is sleepy, too;
Very soon he will be in bed.?
? Yes, Fuzzy Head, lie will.
Before he puts out the light,
1 I will hurry and gather
some sticks, boughs and bark;
and in no time I will make
the snuggest of snug little
Mia-Mias for us.?
