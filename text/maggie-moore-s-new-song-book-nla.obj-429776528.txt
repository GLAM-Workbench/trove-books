Don’t Make Me Laugh!
Original Song, written expressly for Miss Maggie Moore, by G. W»
Hunt.
When I vos a leedle baby gal,
I’ve heard my mother say,
I vos so full of fun I was
And laughing all the day,
And now I am much bigger, yah!
I’m just as ever gay,
Yen folks say tings vot tickles me
I always have to say.
Chorus—Now d'ont, d’ont, do not make me laugh
For I feel so awfully gay I do !
So d'ont, please don’t, now don’t you make me laugh
Or I’ll laugh on all the day !
And when I used to go to school,
And learn to write and spell,
But all de gals would laugh so much
At the funny tale I tell.
And den de cross old mistress take
The cane down from the shelf,
But when she sees de face I makes
Begins to laugh herself!
Jhorus—Now d'ont, d'ont, don’t you make me laugh, &c.


And there was a nice young man who came
When Fader vos away,
He makes strong love to me so nice /
And preddy tings he’d say,
One day while he was talk to me
And sitting on der wall!
Ven somehow he upsets himself
And he come down mit a fall.
Chorus—Now d’ont, d’ont, don’t you make me laugh, Sec.

Chorus —But I veep and I vail ven de ferry-boat did

Und across by New Jersey his Fader keeps the

Und ven he was marri’d be, ve vill live just like a bee,
Und vee’l prew all day Lager beer, and drink it up
at night.
Chorus—But 1 veep and I vail, &c.

Strawberries and Cream.
Written and composed by W. H. Delehanty. As sung by Miss Maggie
Moore in “Struck Oil.”
I’m enraptured, I am captured
By a lovely lump of sweetness ;
She’s an oyster pie, she’s a chicken pie,
And she haunts my every dream ;


She's a little maid, she’s a lemonade, \
She’s the pink of perfect sweetness,
She’s a box of dates, she’s a bunch of grapes,
She’s strawberries and cream.
Oh yes ! She’s far too sweet to live ;
Is my lollypop, is my candy shop,
And her loss I know that I would grieve.
Chorus—Milk, Honey, strawberries and cream,
Like the music of a happy, happy dream ;
She’s a darling, she’s a daisy,
She’s a lovely plate of peaches,
She’s a dandy ’lasses candy.
She’s strawberries and cream.
Milk and honey, oh ? it’s funny,
And I cannot keep from dancing;
For I love a girl, she’s a pretty pearl,
And a lovely belle supreme ;
She’s all my own. my sweet ham bone,
And her voice is so entrancing
She’s my honeycomb, she’s my'sijgarplum,
She’s sugar in the cane.
Oh yes ! she’s a basket full ot fruit,
She’s my buttercups, sweet forget-me-not,
Her voice is like the music of a flute,
And she’s just sixteen.
Chorus —Milk, honey, &c.
Chorus —Milk, honey, &c.
Oh ! I met my love in a shady grove,
On a lovely bright June morning ;
She was all alone, where the flowers bloom,
Down by a running stream ;
’Twas in a shady place, where this maid of grace,
Hid away from sunbeams burning,
And her eyes did look on a purple book,
Like the spirit of a dream.
Oh ? when I saw her resting there, ;
I could not go by, only breath a sigh,
But now we’re friends as dear as ever were,
Sweet strawberries and cream.

As Sung by Miss Maggie Moore in “Struck Oil.”
You Gentlemen look ouf me,

Und dot make me feel so shame.
Chorus —But I like to walk me out,
Dressed in my putty clothes,
And all dose oder girls by me turn up dere nose,
Und the gents they look so sweet, •
So quick as dey see my feet,
Und all the time I don’t go home,
But walk me down de street.
I like me now dis dress,

Dey fit exactly right;
My moder told me some fine day,
I’ll fly up like a kite.
Chorus —But I like to valk, &c.

She's Just a Sweet Bouquet.
As Sung by Miss Maggie Moore in “ Struck
We met ’twas in the garden,
Sweet summer days were near;
I softly ask’d her pardon,
She blush’d my words to hear,
Oh; bright the roses glisten’d,
When she wander’d gaily by ;
The little birds they listen’d
Can’t you guess the reason why ?
Chorus—Oh ! her words were melody,
And her lips would tempt the bee,
Oh ! I don’t know what to call her,
So fair she is and gay ;
She’s witty and so pretty,
She’s just a sweet bouquet!
The leaves were softly sighing,
While scarce a word we said ;
Sweet Cupid there came flying,
And hover’d over head.
Beneath the bough, while straying,
With her lily hand in mine,
The hours we kept delaying,
Till the stars began to shine !
Chorus—Oh ! her words were melody, &c.
In moonlight so entrancing,
My love I fondly told ;
Her eyes were shyly glancing,
I thought I’d been too bold,
Oh ! there among the posies,
Did we vow to never part;
She’s queen of all the roses,.
And I wear her on my heart !
Chorus—Oh ! her words were melody, &c


‘‘Pntty Roses, Don’t You Tell!”
As Sung by Miss Maggie Moore in Struck Oil,
Oh, birds were sweetly singing,
And roses bloom’d so fair !
The lovely blossoms clinging
Made a garden in the air,
But in a garden here below,
That seem’d a paradise,
I saw, while strolling to and fro,
A pair of sparkling eyes !
Chorus—My heart was caught by Cupid there
Twas like a dream of love so fair !
Oh ! the lily bells were nodding
In the breeze that love them well;
And if you heard one whispered word,
Pretty roses, don’t you tell!
While ’mid that garden straying
Where garlands loved to twine ;
I could not help delaying
When a gentle smile met mine
We watched the little honey bees
That sipped from every flower,
And if a kiss stole on the breeze,
Just blame that place and hour.
And if a kiss stole on the breeze,
Just blame that place and hour.
Chorus—My heart was, &c.
The sunlight hours were falling
Before we said adieu ;
The birds to rest were calling,
s And I heard a promise true !


03i! in a dream of sweet delight
The flowers were fast asleep ;
But every star that gemmed th enight
At us began to peep !
But every star that gemmed the night
At us began to peep !
Chorus—My heart was caught, &c.
Hit Him Again, He’s Got No Friends,
Original Song written expressly for Miss Maggie Moore,
by Clay M. Green.
The ups and downs in this great world
Would fill a mighty bock,
But those in luxury pass by,
And seldom ever look
On those whom fortune has not blessed,
With friendship’s pitying eye,
But hear his story with a shrug
And coldly pass him by.
Chorus—Hit him again, he’s got no friends,
Drive him away from the door.
Hit him again, he’s got no friends,
What good’s a man when he’s poor.
A man of wealth may be a lion,
In party, club, or ball,
Courted by men of high degree,
By ladies, great and small ,
But speculation’s fickle hand, .**
May sweep his gold away,
What then do men of high degree,
What do the ladies say.
Chorus—Hit him again, he’s got no friends, &c.


But then the road is very long,
That turns not in its way,
For tides will rise, the cats will mew,
The dog will have his day.
The rich man now, may then be poor,
The poor man have his place,
And he who’s snubb’d to-day may look
Into the other’s face,
Chorus—Hit him again, he’s got no friends, &c.
“Sweet Mary Ann/’
Written and composed by Ed. Harrigan. As sung by
Miss Maggie Moore,
My Mary Ann’s a teacher in a great big public school,
She gets a thousand dollars every year,
She has charge of all the children.
You’d never find a fool.
For Mary gives them all the proper steer,
For she studied Greek and Latin and real French and
Timbuctoo,
Yes, German, Spanish, Turk, and Hindostan,
Sweet Portuguese, and Irish and Jerusalem Hebrew,
Such an education has my sweet Mary Ann.
Chorus —She’s a darling, she’s a daisy, she’s
dumpling, she’s a lamb,
You should hear her play on the piano,
Such an education has my Mary Ann.
My Mary Ann’s a lady no contemptible coquette,
When I meet her, sure my heart goes in a dream,
She’s thoroughly conversant with the art of etiquette,
And at cards she’d best old Hoyle himself a game


Oh, she’d play you Whist or Cribbage, Forty-five or Casino,
And she’d deal the cards just like a gamble man,
At Poker, or Peaknuckle, or Saky, or Pedro,
Such an education has my Mary Ann.
Chorus—She is a darling, &c.
My Mary Ann’s a dancer, in the art of terpsichore,
You should see her forward Four and alamande,
She’d break up all the lumber that you lay down on the
floor,
Such a heavy stepper is my Mary Ann,
Oh, she’d dance you the Mazurka, a Polka, a Quadrille,
A Reel and Jig, or Shuffle in the sand,
The Schottish or the German, you could not keep her
still,
Such an education, has my Mary Ann.
Chorus—She’s a darling, &c.
The Water Mill,
As Sung by Miss Maggie Moore.
Listen to the water-mill,
All the live-long day,
To the creaking of the wheel,
As it wears the hours away.
Languidly the water glides,
Tireless on and still,
Never coming back again,
To the water-mill.
And a proverb haunts my mind,
As the spell is cast,
That the mill will never grind,
With the water that has past.
For the mill will never grind
With the water that has past.


Choins—And this proverb haunts my mind,
As the spell is o’er me cast,
That the mill will never grind,
With the water that has past,
That the mill will never grind,
With the water that has past.
Oh the wasted hours of life,
That have floated by,
Oh the good w r e might have done,
That’s lost without a sigh ;
Love that we might once have had,
Only for a word.
Thoughts conceived but never penn’d,
Perishing unheard,
Take the lesson to yourself,
Take it, hold it fast,
That the mill will never grind,
With the water that has past,
For the mill will never grind
With the water that has past.
Chorus—And this proverb, &c.
Take the lesson to yourself,
Honest hearts and true,
Golden years are passing by,
And youth is passing too;
Try to make the most of life,
Lose no honest way,
All that we can call our own,
Lies in this to-day.
Power, intellect, and strength,
May not, cannot last,
For the mill will never grind,
With the water that has past,
For the mill will never grind,
With the water that has past.
Chorus—And this proverb haunts my mind


“ The Old Wooden Eocker.”
Written and composed by Florence Harper. Sung by Miss
Maggie Moore,
There it stands in the corner, with its back to the wall,
The old wooden rocker, so stately and tall!
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom,
For no one uses that back parlour room.
Oh ! how well I remember in days long gone by,
W hen we stood by that rocker, my sister and I,
And we listened to the stories that our grand-ma would tell,
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so w r ell.
Chorus—As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock,
rock
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock ;
Eighty years had she sat in that chair grim and tall
In that old wooden rocker that stands by the wal*
If this chair could but speak, oh ! the tales it could telV
How poor aged grand-pa in fierce battle fell;
’Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true,
He cherished his freedom, the red, white, and blue !
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside,
Of the day when dear grand-ma stood forth as a bride,
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall,
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall.
Chorus —As she sat by the fire, &c.
But poor grand-ma is gone and her stories are done,
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one,
They have all gone to meet her “ in the sweet
And all that is left is dear sister and I,
Never more will we hide her gold spec’s, or her cap ;
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap ;
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall,
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall:
Chorus —As she sat by the fire, &c,


" Grandfather’s Clock.” v
As sung by Miss Maggie Moore, in “The Fool of the Family.
My grandfather’s clock was too large for the shelf,
So it stood ninety years on the floor ;
It was taller by half than the old man himself,
Tho’ it weighed not a pennyweight more.
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride ;
But it stopped short—never to go again—
When the old man died.
Chorus—Ninety years, without slumbering (tick, tick
tick, tick,)
His life seconds numbering (tick, tick, tick, tick,)
It stopped short—never to go again—
When the old man died.
In watching its pendulum swing to and fro,
Many hours had he spent while a boy ;
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to
know,
And to share both his grief and joy,
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door,
With a blooming and beautiful bride ;
But it stopped short—never to go again—
When the old man died
Chorus—Ninety years, &c.
My grandfather said that of those he could hire,
Not a servant so faithful he found j 1
For it wasted no time, and had but one desire,
At the close of each week to be wound,
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face,
And its hand never hung by its side ;
Butjt stopp’d short—never to go again—•
When the old man died.
Chorus—Ninety years, &c,


It rang an alarm in the dead of the night,
An alarm that for years had been dumb ;
And he knew that his spirit was pluming for flight,
That his hour of departure had come,
Still the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled
chime,
As we silently stood by its side ;
Cut stopp’d short—never to go again—
When the old man died.
Chorus—Ninety years, &c.
When the Stars begin to Peep.
Original Song and Dance, written expressly for Miss Maggie Moore, by
Charles Schultz.
When the stars begin to peep
And the roses are asleep
And the mellow moon is rising o’er the vale,
When the sun is in the west
And the world is gone to rest
I love to meet my darling in the dale.
Chorus—For my heart’s so light, and my love so true,
And the stars so bright, and the sky so blue,
Away with care and sorrow
Be the burden of my lay ;
Let trouble come to-morrow,
We will marry to-day.
Oh, that summer passed away
And that lovely autumn day
And I never saw my darling once again,
But to me I know she’s true,
For she said “ that I love you.”
And I long to meet my darling once a»
Qhorus —For my heart’s so light, &c,


Ridin' in a Railroad Keer,
Sung by Miss Maggie Moore in the “ Fool of the Family.”
Suke Satinet was a comely gal,
And lov’d her parents dear,
Till she met Slim Jim,‘the miller’s son,
A ridin’ in a railroad Keer.
Slim Jim, dad’s house was top of the hill,
Suke Satinet she liv’d near;
’Twas going to the mill she met Slim Jim,
A ridin’ in a Railroad Keer.
Chorus —Ridin’ in a Railroad Keer;
’Twas going to the mill she met Slim Jim,
A ridin’ in a Railroad Keer.
He winked at Sal, and she looked sly,
Then call’d her his duck and dear!
Says Jim will you have me ? Says Suke I will!
A ridin’ in a Railroad Keer.
But as they neared the old man’s house,
Jim began to shake with fear,
And he lost all the courage he had before,
A ridin’ in a Railroad Keer.
Ridin’ &c.
When they got to the house,
He took off his cap,
Then bow’d and scraped so queer,
Says he your daughter promised to be mine,
A ridin’ in a Railroad Keer,
The old man took the gun from the shelf,
Says he Slim Jim just clear,
Or I’ll blow you so high, you’ll never come down
A ridin’ in a Railroad Keer.
Ridin’, Sec,

Down Where the Pansies Grew.
SONG AND DANCE.
Composed by Bobby Newcomb. Sung by Miss Maggie Moore.
As I strolled out by chance one day,
’Twas in the summer time,
I first beheld a fairy form,
And since I’ve called her mine
Some flowers she was bending o’er—
I begged of her a few ;
The glance exchanged was one of love,
Down where the pansies grew.


Chorus—And we whispered and we laughed so free,
And of course we were happy as could be,
Oh, her smiles they are as bright as the rays
Of the sun that loves the dew;
Two hearts were moulded into one.
Down where the pansies grew.
The favor asked was but a bud
A rose that she possessed;
The little flower, love implied,
And that I’d half confessed;
Her cheeks were blushing like the leaf,
In all its rosy hue ;
That evening I exchanged a kiss,
Down where the pansies grew.
Chorus—And he whispered, &c.
The flowers faded, but her love
Remains as bright and green ;
And since the day I’ve called her mine,
How happy we have been !
So now the story I have told,
In all its joys to you.
How I strolled into happiness,
Down where the pansies grew.
Chorus—And he whispered, &c.
I Fope I Don’t Intrude.
SONG AND DANCE.
Written and composed by W. H. Delehanty, Sung by Miss Maggie
Moore.
I’m as happy as the day is long,
My mind is never easy,
No matter whether right or wrong,
You must not think me rude,
For love it is the burden of ray song ;


With Joy I’m almost crazy,
And if perchance, I sing or dance,
You must not think me rude,
And if perchance I sing or dance,
I hope I don’t intrude.
Chorus—Oh ! dear, don’t you wish that you were me ?
1 feel just as happy as a big bumble bee.
I was walking by her door,
When I heard the music sweet;
My heart with joy filled over,
And I could not keep my feet,
So keep the music ringing ;
And it makes me feel so good,
And if I make a little break you must not think me rude
And if I make a little break I hope I don’t intrude.
At a fancy ball the other night,
Myself and little Daisy
We kept it up till broad daylight,
We felt so awfully good.
And Daisy looked so fair and bright,
She set the men all crazy,
And when they’d ask her for to dance,
She’d say “ I wish I could,”
Then I would say in a careless way,
I hope I don’t intrude,
Chorus —Oh ! dear, don’t you wish that you were me, &c.
Blythe and happy be the summer day,
When I shall wed with Daisy,
Then the merry birds will sing their lay,
And wild flowers scent the wood,
Then the cares of life I cast away,
My mind shall then be easy,
And one and all, if you will call,
We will not treat you rude,
And if you come to see our home,
We’ll say you don’t intrude.
Chorus—Oh ! dear, don’t you wish that you were me?


Chinese Song and Dance.
Esau waya tuta unga
Samsi wonga tahi tonga,
Oolung souchung hinga wanga,
Pinga linga ching ching chow chow chung.
Chorus —Esau waya tuta longa,
Somsi wonga tahi tonga,
Ooolong souchong hinga wonga.
Pinga linga ching ching chow chow chung,
Pinga linga ching ching chow chow chung.
Foochow, Henkong yungchow yungting,
Yangtse kiang chinchew quang chang,
Youting kintong ningpo whing,
Pinga linga ching ching chow chow chung.
Chorus —Esau waya tutu lunga, &c.
