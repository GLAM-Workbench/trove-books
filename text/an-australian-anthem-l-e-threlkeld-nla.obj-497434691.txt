AN AUSTRALIAN ANTHEM.
Tune—“ Rule Britannia.”
When Britain first cast off her band
Of outcasts on a foreign shore,
Sad were their sighs, their father-land,
Their bold hearts sunk to hope no more.
Wo ! Australia, Australia, wo to thee !
Doomed is thy land to infamy!
Deep was the groan, her crimsoned cheek
Blushed for her sons, her daughters fair,
Solemn and sad, in accent meek,
To heaven arose Australia’s prayer,
Lo! Australia, Australia bent her knee,
Breathed out her plaint:—o ! set me free !
Up rose her cry before the throne,
Bright angels ceased their harps of gold,
The Eternal spake : —“ I list the moan,
From heaven to earth my will unfold :
Rise ! Australia, Australia, rise thou free !
For I the Lord thy God will be !”
Burst were her bonds, her children free,
Triumphant rose Australia’s fame,
Like morning cloud, her misery,
Passed with the scene of guilt and shame;
Blest! Australia, Australia blest and free,
Whilst thou the Lord thy God shall be.
From heaven celestial gifts descend,
From earth choice store of riches flow,
From seas abundance on thee tend,
Nor hell shall haste thy overthrow.
Hail! Australia, Australia ever free,
Whilst thou the Lord thy God shall be.
L. E. THRELKELD.
