TASMANIA.
INFORMATION FOR INTENDING EMIGRANTS.
DESCRIPTION.
Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the
Australian Continent, between 40° and 44° South Latitude,
and 144° and 149° East Longitude. It is divided from the
Colony of Victoria by Bass’s Straits, 120 miles wide. Its
length from north to south is about 170 miles, and from
east to west about 160 miles. The surface is diversified by
ranges of hills and valleys, with occasionally large plains;
and it is probably the most healthy of all the British
Colonies, for it is never too hot in summer nor too cold in
winter for out-door occupations to be carried on.
The rain-fall, on an average, is a little more than 22
inches; but there are not more than 40 days on which
out-door work cannot be done. Snow seldom falls, or
remains on the ground more than a few hours, except in
the elevated portions of the Island.
“ Few islands in the world can compare with Tasmania
for salubrity. The temperature is so genial, and the air
so pure, that the diseases which in England add so much
to the general death-rate have here a minimum of in-
tensity.
“No part of the world is perhaps more lavourable to
infant life than Tasmania. About nine out of every ten
children survive the first year of life, and the mortality
from that age up to about fourteen years old decreases at a


wonderful rate. The deaths in 1,000 children between 3
and 14 years old only average about five per thousand
annually.”— Dr. E. S. Hall , F. of Statist, and Epid. Society.
Nearly all our native trees and shrubs are evergreen, and
the smaller shrubs are mostly aromatic, and bear beautiful
and variously-coloured flowers. “The English-looking
cottages, snug farm-houses, large mansions surrounded
by cultivated fields, the neat villages, and prominently
placed churches, make the scenery very English, and alto-
gether point to Tasmania as the Britain of the South.” —Sir
Paul de Strzelecki, K. C.M. G.
AREA.
Tasmania contains 16f million acres of land, of which
the islands connected with it contain 1 i million; over
4 million acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the
Crown; leaving the Crown land property at about 12f
million acres, of which about 1,464,000 acres are leased by
settlers for sheep-runs or other purposes.
POPULATION.
The population of Tasmania is 105,280, of whom 55,502
are males, and 49,773 females. The death-rate of 1874 was
16 per 1,000 of the population. The black aboriginal popu-
lation is extinct, tiie last individual, a woman about 70
years of age, having died in 1876. The number of houses
at the date of the last Census in February, 1870, was
20,364.
By the same census it appears that three hundred and
sixteen churches and chapels have been erected in various
parts of the Colony; and the religious wants of the popula-
tion are provided for by a large body of earnest ministers of
all denominations.
CHIEF TOWNS.
Hobart Town is the capital city and seat of Govern-
ment. It is situated on the navigable River Derwent on
the south-east side of the Island, and has a population of
20,236.
. Th e , next t°wn of importance is Launceston, on the north
side of the Island, on the River Tamar, having a population
of 11,307. There are many country townships, or
villages, and seaports of minor importance. Those on


the north coast have frequent communication with the
Colony of Victoria.
MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.
Telegraphic communication has been established between
Hobart Town and Launceston, and connecting all the
principal towns and villages in the Island.
There is also an electric cable between and
Victoria—from whence land-lines extend to New South
Wales, Queensland, and South Australia; and a line from
Adelaide (in South Australia) extending across to Port
Darwin, connects the Colony with England.
There is a four-weekly mail service with Great Britain
via Galle; and mails for the Australasian colonies are
despatched by every steamer leaving Hobart Town and
Launceston,
Regular postal communication exists throughout the
Colony, the postage on town letters being Id. ; on country
letters, 2d. ; to the other colonies, 3d. ; and to Great
Britain, 3d. .
There is no postage whatever on _ newspapers either m
the Colony or to any of the Australian colonies or Gieat
Britain.
The post-office money-order system is in force.
A powerful passenger steamer plies twice a-month be-
tween Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales, and
Hobart Town; and one twice a-month between Mel-
bourne, the capital city of Victoria, and Hobart Town; and
two eight times a-month between Launceston and Mel-
bourne. Steamers between Melbourne and New Zealand
also call at Hobart Town once a fortnight. There are also
steamers from Launceston to the Tasmanian ports on Basss
Strait.
There is a railway, 133 miles long, connecting Hobart
Town with Launceston; and another, 45 miles in length,
from Launceston, through a rich agricultural district, to
Deloraine.
The roads are, with one exception, under the control of
locally-elected trustees, and are maintained partly by tolls
and partly by a rate on the annual value of properties, not
exceeding one shilling in the pound.


PARLIAMENT.
The Parliament of Tasmania consists of two Chambers’
both elective—the Legislative Council, of 16 members’
elected by owners of property; and the House of As-
sembly, of 32 members, elected by owners and occupiers.
IMMIGRATION LAWS.
By the Acts of Parliament, 31 Viet., No. 26, and 38 Viet.,
No. 16, the Board of Immigration in Tasmania are em-
powered to appoint agents in England for the purpose of
selecting emigrants, and arranging for their conveyance to
Tasmania. These agents have also power to issue warrants
for land on the following terms: —
The agents shall issue to each approved emigrant who
has not previously resided in the Colony, and who pays the
full cost of his family’s passage out, a warrant, which will
entitle the holder to receive from the Immigration Agent in
Tasmania a Land Order to the value of £lB for each mem-
ber of the family above 15 years of age, and £9 for each
member above 12 months and under 15 years old; —and
these Land Orders will be received by the Government as
payment for any Crown lands that the emigrant may buy
after his arrival.
The Acts also empower the Immigration Board to permit
any person who has paid his own and family’s passage-
money as cabin or intermediate passengers to demand,
within a year after his arrival in the Colony, a Land Certifi-
cate entitling him to select 30 acres of land for himself,
20 for his wife, if he has one, and 10 for each child.
And for these lands a grant will issue after five years’
residence; but the order will not be forfeited by the death
of the emigrant, or his absence, if his family or any of them
remain in the Colony.
The Board of Immigration issue bounty tickets to
persons residing in the Colony desirous of introducing their
relations or friends. The prices of the tickets being, for a
“ family ticket,” to introduce a man and his wife, and all
their children under 12 years of age, £ls; for a single
man, £10; and for a single female, £5.
Each single person over 12 years of age at the time of
embarkation must have a separate ticket.
Vessels are constantly leaving London and Liverpool for
Melbourne, the agents for which accept these tickets and
provide a free passage for the holders, the balance of the


passage money being paid by the Board, and the emigrants
are landed at Hobart Town or Launceston free of expense
to themselves.
The agents in London are “ The Emigrant and Colonists’
Aid Corporation” (Limited), 25, Queen Anne’s Gate, West-
minister.

LAND LAWS.
The lowest upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture
is fixed by Act of Parliament at £1 an acre ; and the lowest
upset price of pastoral lands at a sum equal to 12 years’
rental, but not less than ss. an acre.
Any person may select for purchase, by private contract
with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not ex-
ceeding 320 acres, at £1 an acre, on the following terms, as
exemplified to the extent of 100 acres :

Section 45 of “The Waste Lands Act” allows selectors
to pay up at any time within the 14 years, and a rebate is
made on the amount added for credit at the rate of 5 per
cent, per annum for the unexpired period of credit.
Credit is allowed on all purchases above £ls.
When 500 acres shall have been sold in not less than 10
lots adjoining or close to each other, the Governor-in-
Councii is empowered to raise a sum not exceeding half of
such purchase-money for the purpose of constructing a road
or roads in the vicinity of the lots.
After paying the expenses of the Lands and Works
Department, one-fourth of the Land Revenue and Licence


F ees is set apart for the construction of roads and bridges
by the various Road Trustees.
Licences for pastoral lands are issued at rates having
regard to the class of the land and the number of sheep and
cattle which can be fed thereon, the rent being calculated
on the carrying capacity of the land, at the rate of from
4 d. to Bd. per annum for each sheep, or 2s. to 4s. a-head for
cattle.
Licences are granted to cut timber on Crown lands.
Licences to dig in search of gold are also issued.
Mineral Leases are issued for working lodes and deposits
of coal, iron, tin, &c. Of the latter metals considerable
shipments of pig iron and ingots of tin have been made to
Victoria and the United Kingdom.
. The prospects of successfully working the iron and tin
mines, and also the extensive coal-fields known to exist in
various parts of the Colony, are very encouraging.
Gold mining has received a fresh impetus from the
results of crushings at Nine-mile Springs on ground for-
merly abandoned. One company crushed 6,692 tons of
quartz, yielding 9797 ounces of retorted gold, of the value
of £39,674, being an average of 1 oz. 9dwts. to the
ton.
PUBLIC EDUCATION.
The system of education is under the control of a Council
and a Board of Education, nominated by the Governor.
The Council hold examinations and confer the Degree of
“Associate of Arts/’ and award Scholarships. The Board
have the management of the Public Schools, appointing
teachers, framing regulations, &c.
Besides four principal Grammar Schools and numerous
private establishments, there are 156 Government Schools
under the Board of Education, having over 12,000 scholars
on the rolls. Several Scholarships are maintained by the
Colony, the best being two annual Tasmanian Scholarships
of the value of £2OO per annum each, provided by the
Government, and tenable at a British University for four
years.
There are in addition a Gilchrist Scholarship, tenable at
Edinburgh or London; and several local Scholarships.
Twelve Exhibitions from the Public Schools under the
Board of Education, and two under the Council, are also
awarded annually, and are tenable for four years at Superior
Schools.


Everv child between the ages ol 7 and 14, resident within
two miles from any Public School, must be sent to . school.
The teaching is entirely unsectarian, but opportunities are
given for religious instruction where desired.
NEWSPAPERS.
Two daily morning papers are published m Hobart
Town, and two tri-weekly morning papers (on alternate
days) in Launceston, besides numerous weekly and periodi-
cal publications.

PRACTICAL HINTS TO EMIGRANTS.
Tasmania is a colony wherein the small capitalist can
find ready and remunerative return for his investments,
and the steady farm labourer and the industrious domestic
servant can get comfortable places with good wages.
To these three classes the information herein contained
is alone intended to apply.
First, then, the Small Capitalist is reckoned to be a
man having three or four hundred pounds in hand, after
paying his family’s passage-money to Tasmania, and who
wishes to become a farmer on his own account. The most
secure and expeditious way of bringing out money is by
an order on one of the banks here, which can be readily
obtained at the head offices in London. (See Appendix.)
The persons should first of all call upon the Agents for
Tasmania in London, who will give him information as to
how he should act, and furnish him with a “Land Order
Warrant ” entitling him to select a certain area of land
free of all charges except the cost of survey. These Agents
are The Emigrant and Colonists’ Aid Corporation (Limited),
25, Queen Anne’s Gate, Westminster.
On landing in Tasmania, and taking lodgings according
to his means, the emigrant should at once call on the
Immigration Agent at Hobart Town, who will give him
advice, and refer him to the Surveyor-General for infor-
mation as to the land regulations—the extent and locality
of available land—the prices and regulations of sale —
and the name and residence of the surveyor of the dis-
trict in which the emigrant may decide to settle. He is
advised to place a certain sum in one of the Savings Banks
as a stand-by, for which he will receive 4 per cent, interest.
He will thus have time to consider also whether to select
Crown land to settle upon, or invest in the purchase of a
farm already cleared.
Emigrants are advised not to cumber themselves before
sailing with large agricultural implements. These can be
obtained in the Colony better adapted to the rough lands
on which they are -to be used. Seeds of all sorts are
cheaper than in England, and more likely to be pure and
genuine than those sent out to the Colony, which are almost
always damaged or adulterated.
A great deal of the richest Crown land is heavily
timbered and covered with a dense undergrowth of shrubs.
Lightly timbered land is generally of a less productive


nature. From forty shillings to five pounds will be required
to clear an acre, according to the nature of the timber, if
done by contract —the large trees being killed, but left
standing. The underwood is usually cut down or grubbed
out in the beginning of summer, and allowed to lie a month
or so till it gets dry, when it is burnt off, and a crop
(generally grass) is “ chipped in ” with the hoe. The logs
and sticks not consumed by the fire can then be gathered
into heaps, and the clearing will be ready for the plough
the second season. Much, however, depends upon the
nature of the underwood, and a settler can always rely upon
getting the benefit of the experience of his neighbours as
to the best mode of clearing the virgin forest. A sufficient
cottage of timber can be erected in the bush for about £5O
—Dutch barn and other necessary outbuildings in pro-
portion. Of course, all have to work; and that settler is
best off who has a large family whose help is available, as
the price of labour is high.
The richest settlers in Tasmania, who have made their
thousands, have not been idlers. Many a rich settler
knows how to drive and hold a plough, and has done it
for years; many a rich settler’s wife knows how to cook
a dinner for the farming men, and has. done it for years;
and such knowledge, once acquired, is always ready for
occasion.
The average crop from rich newly cultivated land is
25 bushels of wheat, 30 of barley, 35 of oats, potatoes 3
to 10 tons. These, however, have been very largely
exceeded in good seasons and good situations, viz.,
50 bushels wheat GO bushels barley, 100 bushels oats,
15 tons potatoes, 37 tons carrots, 70 tons of mangels.
Upon the head of tillage, it is a man’s own fault
(assuming, of course, that he possesses a knowledge of
farming) if, in an average of seasons, he be not abundantly
repaid for whatever he does in cultivating the earth.
For all sorts of grain that are usual in Great Britain—such
as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and for various kinds of pulse—
both the soil and climate are wonderfully well adapted;
and, where proper tillage has been attended to, the returns
have always proved satisfactory. Where the land has
been properly worked and rotation of crops attended to —
the ground cleared of stumps and other obstructions—the
growing crop preserved by a fence; where, in fact, industry
and care have been manifested, the returns may be safely
set down as equal to those derived per acre from the fair


average land of the Mother Country. Not, however, in
quantity only, but in quality, is the grain of Tasmania all
that a farmer need desire. Few samples of wheat yield
less than from sixty-two to sixty-four pounds per. bushel—-
the average standard of sixty pounds, at which it is
purchased by the public, being invariably found in favour
of the grower; and when it comes to the meal tub it is
found to be rather above the best wheat of English growth
in the comparative quantity of bread produced from the
same quantity of flour.
Certain soils in this Colony are peculiarly favourable to
the culture of the potato, and this esculent occupies a
considerable amount of attention at the hands of some
agriculturalists.
Mangel wurzel and turnips are cultivated in nearly
every part of the Colony, and are found to answer
extremely well.
The high price of labour, low price of wheat, and other
circumstances, have lately led to a better system of farm-
ing, in which fallowing and rotation of crops occupy a
prominent place; and the breeding of pure stock—sheep,
cattle, horses, pigs, &c. —for which the climate, is peculiarly
adapted, and which are always in demand in the other
Colonies, forms one of the most profitable branches of
agricultural and pastoral farming. Merino rams have been
sold recently for export at prices ranging from £lO to £SO
and £6O, and even up to £2OO each..
The climate of Tasmania is peculiarly adapted for fruit
and there is a very large export trade in green
fruits, apples especially, amounting in the twelve months
ending 31st December, 1876, to 113,834 bushels. Among
the fruits grown in the innumerable orchards and gardens,
the produce of which forms the main support of many
industrious families, may be mentioned apples, pears, plums,
peaches, apricots, strawberries, raspberries, walnuts, goose-
berries, currants, cherries, &c., &c.
The small fruits are extensively converted into jams and
jellies, of which last season’s export exceeded 1,505 tons, of
the value of £90,271.
All kinds of vegetables are grown with success, and find
a ready sale in the towns.
The next class to which advice is tendered is that of the
Agricultural or Farm Labourer.
A steady man can obtain from 10s. to 15s. a-week wages,
with quarters or a cottage, firing, water, and the following


weekly rations of food, which vary on different farms, but
are fully as follows 7 to 12 lbs. of meat, 10 to 14 lbs. of
flour, 2 lbs. of sugar, \ lb. tea, and he is generally allowed
a bit of good ground for his vegetable garden. He has
only to show an interest in his master’s service, and be
sober and honest, and his labours will be duly appreciated.
He has visiting clergymen, if not close to a church; he
has public schools in every district, open to his children
at about Qd. per week; and medical men piactising
throughout the Colony—these, latter, however, do not
flourish in the healthy interior. His hours of labour are not
more than 60 a-week at the furthest; and during shearing
time or harvest there is always remunerative employment
for his children down to 9 or 10 years of age, especially in
the Hop-growing Districts and during the Hop-pickmg
season. There is also a good demand for boys of 12 to 14,
who have gained a slight knowledge of farming and milking.
The third and last class is the Household Servant, whose
labours are the same here as in England, but whose wages
and advantages are much greater. A respectable female
servant can get from £2O to £3O a-year according to her
abilities, and good cooks and laundresses are much wanted;
wages are usually paid monthly; the alternate Sunday
afternoon out is commonly allowed, with occasional
holidays; and, if well behaved and proper in her conduct,
she enjoys almost a certainty of getting a respectable man
for a husband. .
A good sober man servant in a household receives high
wages, if he is inclined to make himself generally useful. _
But one thing is necessary to all emigrants on their
arrival in Tasmania, and that is, to avoid loitering about
the public-houses with their attractions.. The colonial ale
is excellent in its quality and reasonable in piicc.
The classes of the population more especially required
in Tasmania at present are :
1. Men with capital to invest.
2. Agricultural labourers, or persons accustomed to field
labour or dairy farming, and miners.
3. Domestic servants, either male or female.
There are plenty of clerks, book-keepers, dressmakers,
and needle-women, shopmen and shopwomen.
Life and property are as secure as in Great Britain.
The best descriptive account of the settled portions _ of
Tasmania lately published is “ Walch’s Tasmanian Guide
Book,” printed in 1871.
