MICHAEL HOWE, who the principal part in th*
&ranfa£Hom about t© be narrated, was born at Pontefraft in
Yorkfhire in the year 1787, and was bound apprentice to a
merchant veffel at Hull; but he ferved only two years when
fee ran away and entered on board a man-of-war.
In the year 1811 he was apprehended for robbing a miller
on the highway, and tried at the York a/lfoes following , butj
from an informality in the indi&ment, the capital part of the
charge was abandoned, and he received fentence of feven years
tranfportation : he arrived at this Settlement in the fhip Inde-
fatigable, Captain Crofs, in the month of O&ober 181£,
During his pafTage from England his habits were rather in
duftrious, and, though always mifchievoufly inclined, he exhib-
ited, no fymptoms of that daring and wanton conduct which
mantfefled itfelf in his future life, unlefs we may coniider as
fuch his leaping overboard, whilft the veflel was in port, and
primming a confiderable daftance before he was taken.


As si leader of a bandofdefperadoes, Howe may not unaptly
be compared to Three-fingered Jack, who was fo long the ter-
ror of the peaceable fettlers in the plantations of Jamaica 5
and who, notwithftanding every exertion to take him, long
ranged the woods of that Ifland, committing the moft cruel
and daring a&s of murder and robbery, until, from the large
rewards offered by Government, he was arretted by the hands
of juttice.
..V « . .
Howe was only a few days at Government public labor be-
fore he was affigned, as a crown fervant, to Mr. Ingle, a mer-
chant and grazier ; from whofe fervice he eloped into the
woods, and joined twenty-eight felons at that time at large
committing depredations.
With a view of inducing thofe deluded people to return to
their duty to Government, His Excellency Governor Mac-
quarie, on the 14th of May 1814, was pleafed to extend to
them the Royal Clemency for all offences committed during
their unlawful abfence (the crime of wilful murder
provided they fhould return to their lawful occupations by the
ift day of December following; denouncing all who fhould
negle& to do fo as out-laws.
This banditti, now confittingof twenty-nine perfons, amongft
whom were Michael Howe and John Whitehead, an equally
defperate offender, availed themfelves of the proffered clemen-
cy, and furrendered to Government,*


Although Howe and his companion* muft at this period
have been fenfibie that their lives would have been forfeit to
the Laws but for the mercy extended to them, this reflexion
did not operate to amend their future conduct; for wc foon
after find Howe and Whitehead again in the woods with a
new fet of defperadocs, adding murder to robbery.
After fome minor depredations, this band, headed by White-
head, ftripped nearly the whole of the fettlers at New Norfolk
of their portable property, together with all arms and ammuni-
tion ; and from thence proceeded to Pitt Water and robbed
Mr. Fisk, a new fettler at that place.
In the night of March 10th, they fet fire to the wheat-flacks-,
barns, &c. of A. W. H. Humphrey, Efq. Police Magiftrate,
and of Bartholomew Reardon, diftri# conftable, at Pitt Water p
within a few minutes of each other j deftroying the produce
of one hundred acres recently got in. A paper was found near
the burnt ftacks of Mr, Humphrey, upon which were words,
of threatening Import, and the reprefentation of a gun firing a
ball at the head of a man.
It afterwards came out that Whitehead and Garland were
the principal incendiaries in this wanton deftru&ion.
On the 25th of April 1815, the band, confiding of John
Whitehead, the leader, Richard M'Guire, Hugh Burne,
Richard Collier, Peter Septon, John Jones, James Geary,
a deferter from the 73d regiment, and Howe, accompanied by
a black native girl named Mary, with whom Howe cohabited,
again appeared at New Norfolk, and robbed the houfe of Mr,


C&rllfle, a fettler there, who immediately communicated the
circumfcance to his neighbour Mr„ M'Carty, • | IHI
The latter being apprehenfive for the fafety of his fchooner
die Geordy, lying near in the Derwent with valuable proper-
ty, determined to meet the robbers ; and, accompanied by
Several perfons on the fpot, who immediately volunteered,
commenced a purfuit.
Mr. M'Carty's party, confifting of himfelf, Mr. Jemott,
Mr. James O'Birne, mafter of the Geordy, Keith Hacking,
mate, Meffrs. Carlifle, Murphy, James Triffit, John Brown,
and ■ Tooms, armed with fowling-pieces and piftols,
foon came up with the robbers and commanded them to fur-
render their arras; the gang inftantly commenced firing
under cover of, and through a large hollow tree, and wounded
five of the party, who had the difadvantage of being fully
expofed to the fire of the former on every attempt to get a fhot
at them. Carlifle received a ball in the groin and three flugs
in the breaft, of which wounds he died within an hour y Mr.
' ' 1
Jemott was badly wounded by a ball paffing through the thick
part of the thigh, in which part Triffit was alfo wounded, and
Murphy in the abdomen. O'Birne received a ball in the
cheek, which perforaiedthetongue and lodged in the neck, cauf-
ing his death in a few days. The banditti, availing themfelves
•- * - •-
of the difabled ftate of Mr. M'Carty's party, in turn demanded
him to lay down his arms, which was refufed, and a flight
firing continued until the wounded were removed, with the
exception of Murphy, whofe ftate obliged him to remain at
the mercy of the gang 5 and they wcJre about to add corporal


punifoment to their vi&ory, but were prevented by their
leader Whitehead.
I? . • : /
In confequence of thefe murders, military parties were fent
in various dire&ions in fearch of the banditti. A party of the
73d regiment in a few days came fo clofe up wiih them as to
find the remains of their fires, and the fkin of a fheep recently
killed. A party of the 4fith was alfo in purfuit, and a number
of the inhabitants of HobartTown, well armed, went in fearch
of the murderers of Carliflc and O'Birne.
Lieutenant Governor Davey adopted meafures for their
apprehenfion.
A Proclamation had previoufly to this been publifoed, offer-
ing a reward of fifty guineas to any perfon, free or bond, who
would apprehend a bufh-ranger, and lodge him in fafe cuftody 5
holding out encouraging profpe&s to fuch of the offenders
themfelves (not perfonally implicated in any a& of felony) as
fhould procure the apprehenfion of any of their affociates ; and
it having been reprefented that the bufo-rangers derived (ap-
plies from fettlers and other fixed inhabitants, a further reward
of fifty guineas was offered to any perfon giving information
of fuch abettors ;\ for without fecret aflifiance thefe depreda
iions could not long have continued.
On the 10th of May, the band of robbers vifited the houfe
of Mr. Humphrey at Pitt Water for the fecond time. About
leven o'clock in the evening. Whitehead, Septon, and Collier,
all armed, burft open the door of the fervent*' hut and rufhed


in. Whitehead arid Septon immediately prefented their muf-
kets cocked to the fervants prefent, and flood over them, whilfl
Collier made them take off their neck-cloths, with which he
tied their hands acrofs behind their backs; Whitehead and
Septon threatening to flioot them if they refifted or flirred.
Howe then came in, and taking a lamp from the hut went,
with others who had remained oucfide, to the dwelling-houfe
occupied by Mr. Humphrey, which they broke open and
plundered, while Whitehead, Septon, and Collier flood guard
over the fervants.
After packing up every thing they found ufeful to themfelyei,
and breaking and deftroying what they could not take away
(which Jaft they faid they fhould have fpared had they not
perceived two pair of irons in the houfe), they departed, threat-
-1 ~V-s3fiC % : \ - ' f . . . > m.-
ening if any one flirred out of the hut that he fhould be
ihot by fentries which they would place to look out, whiift
the others might get a fufficient diftance.
The banditti fhortly afterv/ards re-vifited New Norfolk
Knowing Mr. M'Carty was abfer.t, and meditating revenge for
the oppofltion met with in their late encounter, they repaired
to his premifes by night, and wantonly fired a volley in at the
window. It happily did no other injury than flightly wound-
ing one foldier. On this occafion they met with an unex-
pefted reception ; for a party of the 46th regiment, who had
been ftationed in the houfe, immediately commenced a brifk
fire, which killed their leader Whitehead.


The pafty then rufhed from the houfe to cut off the retreat
of the banditti, but from the datknefs of the night were una&le
to do Co,
When Whitehead received the fatal flhot he ran a few yards
towards Howe, crying "take my watch, take my watch/ f
and then dropped. Howe immediately took off his head jas
well perhaps to prevent the body being recognized by their
iI" -i: * -• t .■* I ' " * ■" - - " " " - "'*> •
purfuers as in performance of an engagement which they had
i
made to each other, that, upon any one of them being killed,
afurvivor (hould do this, to prevent, as they fa id, any per fan
from benefiting by rewards for taking in their heads.
The head of Whitehead was a confiderable time afterwards
found in the woods: the body was brought to Hobart Town*
and gibbeted on Hunter's Bland.
From this period Ho we was confidered the leader of the
band.
In the early part of this year Lieutenant Governor
eftablifhed Martial Law in the Colony ; which was kept in
force till repealed by order of Governor Macquarie; foon
after which, a party in queft of the banditti, in the neighbour-
hood of Tea-tree Brufh, defcried their place of retreat from a
fmoke which they had made. Near the hut from which it pro-
ceeded, were M'Gui e and Burne reft beingabfent), who
immediately darted into a thicket and difappeared, eluding all
fearch.


In the hut was found a number of articles belonging to wa-
ll© US individuals whom they had, at different periods, plunder-
«d; befides ammunition, mufket balls, fire-arms, and fcveral
kangaroo dogs.
This difcovery caufed the reparation of M'Guire and Burne
from the reft of the banditti, and their fpeedier fall; for after
| • ? f' • ; f * , * .
wandering fcveral days in the woods theyapplied to a fettler, near
Kangaroo Point, to procure them a boat for the purpofe of pro-
ceeding to Bafs's Straits; for which fervicc they promifed the
reward of a watch. The fettler pretended to come into their
views, and left them with the affurance of going in fearch of the
boat j but he privately repaired to Hobart Town, and informed
the Lieutenant Governor of their intentions. A party of the
46th regiment was immediately difpatched, who furrounded
the place of their concealment, and captured both. Burne was
the moft aged of the gang, and was feverely wounded in en»
deavouring to efcape from the party. They were brought
before a General Court Martial, charged with being two of
the banditti who murdered the unfortunate Cariifle, were
conviaed, and received fentence of death. They were ac-
cordingly executed and their bodies gibbeted on Hunter's
I Hand, near to that pf Whitehead, their leader when that
murder was committed;


The banditti were now reduced to Howe, Septon, Jones,

Geary, and Collier.
From the information of one of the gang, who had been
taken in the woods and afterwards admitted an evidence for the
crown, a difcovery took place of fome of the abettors of the
bufh-rangers in the robbery of Mr. Filk; in confequence of
which, William Steveus, a crown priforier, and two youths born
of European parents at Norfolk Ifland (who were ftock-keepers
near to the place where the robbery was committed, and m
whofe pofleflion fome of the ftolen property was found), were
all apprehended as being concerned with the bufti-rangers in
that robbery ; of which they were afterwards conviaed by a
General Court Martial, and fentenced to death, Stevens was
executed, and the two youths relpited under the gallows, which
W as fixed near to the gibbets on Hunter's lAand; and the body
of Stevens was buried within a few yards of the fame place.

Thefe awful examples had no tendency tocorrea the vicious
eourfe df the remaining hardened offenders. Thev committed
many aflsof plunder in the September following ;~they rob-
bed the houfe of Mr. Stanfield, at Green Point, of every move-
ablethey alio rufhed into the houie of Styncs and Troy,
< .fettiers at the :PloinS;#f the Coal Fiver, and with horrid
menaces commanded; ievery perfon. to remain quiet in the
jfcwtfllthg,while; dhey rifted it of every portable article » and a
f3fadefnta»i who at wofk on the premifei, and who fome


time before Had been of the party in purfuit of them, narrowly
efcaped being (hot.
After this month thev retired again to the woods, and were
not heard of till the 7th of November; when they a(Taiie < the
refidence of David Rofe, E/q„ at Port Dahymplc. Their
conduit while plundering here was aggravated, as on other
occafions, by every wanton atrocity.
Upon this, the Commandant repaired to the woods in perfon,
accompanied by a firong party of the 46th regiment, and the
chief conftable; they fearched the interior of the country
feveral days, but were unable to come up with any of ihe gang.
Thefe mifcreants were next vifible at the farm of Mr. T.
Hayes, at Bagdad, within eleven days, and at the diftance of
100 miles from the (bene of their laft outrage. Mr. William
T. Stocker, a perfon in the habit of trading between the Set*
tlements, had halted at Hayes's for the night with a cart load
of property of great value ; the whole of which the banditti
forcibly carried off. It is to be fupnofed that they had pre-
vioufly been informed of Mr. Stocker's journey.
The property taken from individuals bv this Uwlefs gang
muft by this time have been immenfe; and it is not to be con-
ceived how it was appropriated bur by their having confederates
in fociety, though unfufpeHed, who not only purchafed their
booty, but were channels of information as to the palling
events in which they were intereftcd: and, indeed, we may
t . .
fafely afcribe the long period in which they eluded every
exertion made to capture them to this (ecret fupport.


Soon titer this, the banditti, increafing in hardihood zn pro-
portion with the number of atrocities as yet committed with
impunity, aflumed a lofty tone, and addrefled a letter to
Lieutenant Governor Davey, replete with ignorant and info*
0 m y r* _ _
lent threats. They, however, complained of being much
ha r rafled by the purfuing parties from the Settlements, and the
perseverance ufed to take them. In addition to the old gang,
Che letter was figned by. fix felons, who had lately abfeonded,
himed Chapman, Coine, Parker, Keegan, Brown, and Currie,

continued in all diteftions by parties of military from Hobart

indefatigable purfuit, night and day. All efforts, however,

41 John Yorke being duly fworn ftates, about 5 o'clock in
the evening of November 27th, I fell in with a party of bufh-
rangers, about 14 men and 2 women ; Michael Howe and
Geary were the only two of the gang 1 knew perfonaJly. I
met them on Scantling's Plains— l was on hprfeback ; they
defired me to ftop, which I accordingly did on the high road^

(aid they could fet the whole country in a fire with one Hick.
I was detained about three quarters of an hour, during which
time they charged me to be ftridt in making known what they
laid to me, and what I had feen. On my returning from Port
Dalrymple I called at a hut occupied by Jofeph Wright, at

Scantling's Plains :—William Williams and a youth were
there, who told me the bufh-rangers had been there a few days
before, and forced them to a place called Murderer's Plains
(which the bufh-rangers called the Tallow Chandler's Shop),
where they made them remain three days, for the purpofe of
rendering down a large quantity of beef fat, which Williams
undecftood was taken from cattle belonging to Stynes and

On the 25th of February following, the Commandant of
Port Dalrymple fent out Enfign Mahon and a party of the
46th regiment, in purfuit of bufh-rangers; and after feverai
Weeks in the woods they fell in with Chapman, Parker and
Elliott, lying in ambufcade at York Plains. On being called
upon to (urrender, Chapman fnapped his mulket at the guide,
and with the reft ran off. Three of the foldiers then fired 5
Chapman was (hot through the back, and foon after expired 5
Parker was {lightly wounded, but fled into a thicket and
cdj Elliott was {hot by Enfign Mahon, and died inftantly
The heads of Chapman and Elliott were taken off and fent into
Launcefton, and the bodies interred on the fpot. Parker was
afterwards apprehended near the fame place in a wretched
flate.
In the early part of March it appears that fome jealoufy of
Howe began to manifeft itfelf in the old gang ; —they conceiv-
ed, from the circumftance of his being abfent at intervals
without their knowledge, or afligning any reafon, that he me-
ditated betraying the reft. Howe was aware of their fufpicionn,
and, feeling no longer fecure among them, fuddenly eloped,
taking with him the native girl before mentioned,


In April 18I7» Lieutenant Governor Sorell arrived, and
aftumed the government of the Settlements on Van Diemen's
Land; and about this period Howe and the native girl were
purfued in the neighbourhood of Jericho, by a fmall party of
the 46th regiment.
His wantonly cruel difpofltion was ftrongly manifeiled on
this occaflon; for being hard preffed, in order to facilitate his
own efcape, he fired at this poor female companion, who from
fatigue was unable to keep pace with him. She received, how-
ever, little injury, and together with his blunderbufs, knap-
fack, and dogs, fell into the hands of the purfuers.
This native girl afterwards became particularly valuable as
a guide to the military parties, from the quicknefs and fagacity
peculiar to the black natives in tracing foot-fteps where
Europeans would not fufpe& them. She led the party fir ft to
fome of the places of the banditti's refort at the River Shan-
non. While employed in burning their huts in this quarter,
Jones, Septon, and Geary were feen at the other fide of the
river: the appearance of the military party, however, gave
them no alarm, as they knew the river could not be immedi-
ately crofted ; the banditti had therefore another opportunity
of efcape.
Continuing their fearch, the foldiers next met with 50 fheep
in a remote place, ftolen from Mr. Stanfield, and concealed
by the bufh-rangers for future fupply


After the lofsof his knapfack and dogs, his confirmed breach
with the reitof the banditti, and his late narrow efcape, Howe,
now entirely alone, appears to have determined upon carrying
into execution a defign which, according to the report of the
native girl, he had for fome time contemplated, viz. that of
chancing an extenfion of mercy upon furrender.
He accordingly found means to convey to Lieutenant Go
vernor Sorell a letter offering to give himfelf up to an Officer,
as well as to furnifh important information of the friends and
fupporters of the old gang, and become the means of their
final capture, upon Hi* Honor's afiiirance of prefent perfonal
fafety, and a favorable reprefentation to His Excellency the
Governor in Chief with a requeft for pardon. The Lieutenant
Governor immediately difpatched Captain Nairn, of the 46th
regiment, to a place named, with an affurance to that effe& ;
and this Officer on the figth of April conveyed Howe to
HobartTown, and lodged him in the county gaol. He now
underwent various examinations by the Magiflrates.
In the meantime the military parties remained in purfuit
of the robbers ftill at large.
On the 10th of May, the party commanded by Serjeant
M'Carthy arrived in Hobart Town, after an arduous and per-
fevering purfuit under circumftances of peculiar hardship and
privation: they had procured information of, and tracked the
a
banditti for fevcral days, until the lofs of their fiour in ford-
# <r
ing a river, and a total want of provifions, which reduced them


io eat the fkinmocaflons* from their feet, compelled them to
give up the purfuit for a time.
On the 19th of the fame month, the party ftationed at Pitt
Water, commanded by Lieutenant Nunn, received intelligence
that the banditti were robbing the premifes of Edward Lord,
Efq. at Orielton Park. They haftened to the fpot; and on
*
their appearance the banditti fired feveral (hots, and flightly
wounded Lieutenant Nunn. Some foldiers, ftationed at another
part of the Settlement were now feen by the bufh-rangers ap-
proaching ; upon which the latter fled, leaving behind them
fbme Hour which they had ftolen from Mr. Lord.
About the latter end of June, the Government long boat,
employed on the Port Dalrymple river in carrying provifions
between George Town and Launcefton, was carried away by
the bufh-rangers, with five more men and feveral ftand of
arms j but in confequence of bad weather their defign of efcap-
ing to the Iflands was fruftra»ed ; and they were compelled to
return. After burning the boat and other articles they were
driven again to refume their former habits in the woods.
The old gang might now be confidered to have received
confiderable acceffion ; the number at large having amounted
to twenty, in the abfence, at this period, of the Lieutenant
Governor at the other Settlement.

On J he 5th July, a meeting of the principal inhabitants of
Hobart Town was held, under the fanflion of His Honor, in
order to facilitate the views of Government, by raifing a fum
of money to be applied in rewards for apprehending the bandit"
ti then at large; when five hundred and twenty guineas
were immediately fubferibed.
Upon the refultof this meeting, and the recent intelligence
of the plunder and excefles at George Town, the Lieutenant
Governor iflued a Proclamation,, holding out tbe
rewards for the apprehenfion of the old gang :
For Geary * . . . . One hundred guineas:
Septon
Jones > Eighty guineas each ;
Collier . y
Browne . ; .. . )
r* Fifty guineas each ;
Coine .... . y
And at the fame time was offered, a reward of 80 guineas
for George Watts, an old and mifchievous bufh-robber under
colonial Sentence to Hunter's River, but who had only affociated
with Garland (alfo an offender in the woods, and who was
engaged with Whitehead in burning the flacks at Pitt Water),
fuppofed to be drowned in an attempt to crofs the Derwent.
* * " * > f « • f - . : > y * •• ti s
Two days after this Proclamation, the banditti appeared at
the Black Brufh, and on the following day were traced by
♦ *
Serjeant McCarthy's party to a fettler s houfe at the Tea-tree


Brufh, where they had dined. On perceiving the military,
they ran out of the houfe and pofted themfelves behind trees,
where the timber on the ground was very thick. An attack
commenced on both fides, and though the banditti had certainly
the advantage of pofition, Geary, their leader, by a well-
directed fire, was wounded, and fell : he died the fame night*
Smith and Tiill, runaways from Port Dalrymple, who had
joined the gang only a few days, were alio wounded and
taken.
This fuccefs would doubtlefs have been followed up by
greater, in the military party, but from its laboring under the
difad vantage of great fatigue, from inceflant purfuit, and that
of a heavy rain which prevented their mufkets from going off.
The whole of the knapfacks and dogs of the banditti, however,
fell into their hands; and it ought to be noted that this little
party were at the moment totally unacquainted with the re-
cent Proclamation and offered rewards from the latter of
which they were, however, not allowed to remain long with*
out benefiting.
In the mean time Howe continued at the gaol of Hobart
Town; but His Excellency the Governor in Chief having
received favorably the requeflmadeby the Lieutenant Governor,
in purfuance of the terms of Howe's furrender, he could not
altogether be confidered a prifoner for clofe confinement; upon
which account, and his health being reported to be much im-
paired, he was occafionaUy permitted to walk out in charge of
a con liable.


His examinations by the Magiftrates were frequent, and his
depofitions voluminous and tedious ; but notwithftanding his
promiieof a full difclofure of the fupportcrs of the bufh-rangers,
little information of worth or utility could be gained from
him.
It might have been expe&ed that Howe would, at this
period, have placed fome value on his improved fituation g
being in fa& confidered a pardoned offender, to whom was
afforded a laffc chance of atoning in fome degree for his paft
crimes by an amended life; and having the profped of fptedi-
ly returning to fociety : but a life of crime obtained with

fome means eluding the vigilance of the conftable, to whofe
care he was entrufted, he again efcaped Co the woods. /

He now felt himfelf too much a traitor and a villain for the
fafe admiflion of a companion or confederate, and never after
joined his old aflbciates. He had, indeed, before him a well-
founded apprehenfion of the confequences of his treachery,
even from thofe damped with fimilar crimes, fhould he be
found once more in their power.
Thus we find the crimes of this man lead him on, Sep by
dep, till he is reduced to prefer the defperate fituation of land-
ing oppofed to all mankind ; compelled unceafingly to watch
for his life; certain of feeing an enemy tn every human
face; certain that to fufFer himfelf for a moment to fieep
might terminate his miferable exiftence; certain, too, that in
that deep his enormities would at leaft vrfit him with horrid


j-ttrofpe&ive vi lions, anticipations of torture, defpair, and I
death ; and certain that reality promifed no other end :—prefer-
ring all thefe, to the opportunity given him of a life of pent- I 3
tence, and a death at all events not haftened by the hands of
jufticc. I
Let us now turn to his old affociates in guilt, whom juftice
ieemed to be quickly overtaking ; for there remained at
large, befides Howe, of the original gang who ran from the j
Derwent, only Septon, Jones, and Collier.- Coine and |
Browne, who were implicated in their recent robberies, were I 1
runaways from Fort Dalrymple. [

On the 3d of Auguft, the little force of Serjeant McCarthy, j
which had been unremittingly fcouring the woods in all di-
re£tions, obferved the print of feet on the beach, and traced and
difcovered the banditti at Swan Port, on the eaftern fhore.

As foon as they perceived the foldiers, they fled with precip-
itancy. One of the parly fired, and fhot Jones, their chief,
through the head; who inftanily died. His body was buried
on the beach, after being decapitated, and his head fent to Ho- j
ibart Town. j
Whilft the party proceeded to intercept the retreat of the re-
mainder, the fire of the banditti wounded Holmes (a runaway
who had lately joined them), and he was taken; but from the
intricacy of the woods, and his wounded ftate, he was with
difficulty brought to Hobart Town. j


We next find difcontent and treachery among themfelves
fiaften the deftruftion of the remainder of the banditti i for on
the 25th of Auguft, a horrible tranfa&ion occurred at a hut
behind Gordon's Plains, near Launcefton;
They had on that day effe&ed a robbery at the farm of Mr*
Brumby, in which it appears Wright and Hillier, runaways
.from George Town, had joined them. On that evening
Wright left the reft, and gave himfelf up at Launcefton ; but
Hillier conceived the horrible project of murdpfing his com-
panions, Septon and Collier, while afleep at this hut (it ap-
pears Cotne and Browne were abfent at this moment) ; imagin-
ing, as he afterwards laid, that he fhould receive the rewards
offered by Government, and fcreen himfelf from the punifh-
mentofhisown crimes, which he apprehended would fpeedily
overtake him.
In the middle of the night, this nionftcr, watching his
opportunity, with a razor cut the throat of Septon from ear to
ear, caufing his immediate death ; he then turned to perpetrate
the fame ad on Collier, who, it feems, had been flightly diftur-
bed; he effcdled only a trifling wound on the neck of the latter,
who made his efcape out of the hut; Hillier, however, having
previoufiy fecured poflefllon of the arms, feized Sep ton's rifle
gun, and fired at Collier, fhattering his hand feverely.
A more treacherous afiaffinauon has feldom been heard of.
Hillier was (oon after taken ; as was alfo Collier, in an
wnfeebled and helplefs ftate. The former was fent to Sydney
to take his trial for the murder of Septon, in the (hip Pilot


With Collier, who was ient to the fame tribunal, charged as
one of the eight, engaged in the murders at New Norfolk,
when Carlifle and O'Birne were killed ; and he was the only
one referved to make a public expiation,
Upon intelligence of this laft dreadful affair, the Lieutenant
Governor iffued a further Proclamation, and offered the follow*
ing rewards for the only three bufh-rangers at large on the
Ift day of September j viz.—
For Howe , . ... One hundred guineas;
Watts Eighty guineas;
Browne ..... Fifty guineas ;
All of whom were known to have no connexion or commu-
nication with each other.
In this month Browne furrendered to Government; Coine
and Kcegan had done fo lome tine previoully ; and though
capital punilhmeni might have been infli&ed on thefe laft
three, yet a3 they had no connexion with the heinous murders
committed by others of the banditti, Government forbore to
bring them before a Criminal Court. Thefe men were chief-
ly companions of Parker, who was taken as before noticed,
and with him were convi&ed by a Bench of Magiftrates of va-
rious robberies, and fentenced—

We have now only Howe and Watts at large j and it feemed
ordained that the greater (hould be referved for punishment of
the leffcr villain, before called upon to receive the juft reward
of his great and manifold crimes*
On the 10th of O&ober, Howe again appears on thefcene,
adding to the catalogue of murders already recorded one of the
mod ravage chafer, which will long be in the recollection
of the inhabitants of the Colony.
A perfon named William Drewe, alias Skmbow, had charge
of fome (heep in the vicinity of New Norfolk, for his mafcer p
Mr. Williams of Hobart Town. Drewe had occafionally cor-
refponded with Howe, and had agreed along with his maftec
to take him on the firft opportunity.
Howe had lately been at Williams's hut with a letter for trie
lieutenant Governor ; and foon after Watts, who it {hould
feem had fomedefign upon Howe, called to inquire of Drewe
if he had feen him. Drewe informed Watts that he had fecn
Howe, and was to meet him at fun-rife the following Triday,
when, he faid, if Watts would come, he would take him
On theThurfday Watts took away a boat from New Norfolk s
in which he croffed the Derwent, and concealed himfelf near
the path where Drewe had appointed, till the next morning.
At fun-rife Drewe arrived, and told Watts that he was to
meet Howe at a place called Long Bottom. They proceeded
thither, and Watts requefted Dre we to conceal his gun, as pro-
bably Howe would not come up to them if he perceived jfe.


Upon arriving at the fpot, Drewe called feveral times, and
was anfwered by Howe from the oppofite fide of the creek.
When Watt* came within 90 yards of Howe, he delired him
to knock out the priming of his gun, promiling to do the fame ;
this was accordingly done by both, and after proceeding 30 or
40 yards, they made a fire. Soon after which, Watts caught
hold of Howe, and threw him down ; Drewe tied his hands,
and took from his pockets two knives. Watts and Drewe
next prepared breakfaft, but of which Howe refufed to par-
take. Before they proceeded to Hobart Town, Drewe pro-
pofed to take his mafter's gun and dog to the hut ; which was
agreed to by Watts, who defired him not to mention the occur-
rence of the morning to Williams j the latter had arrived the
evening before at the hut to (hear hisfheep. Drewe met his
mafter, who becoming, by the abfence of his man, alarmed
for hisfafety, had proceeded in fearch of him ; upon Drewe's
running towards him with his gun and dog, Williams in.,
quired the caufe ; Drewe replied that George Watts was
ft op ping with Howe, whom they had taken, whilft he came
to acquaint his mafter, and deliver his mufket, as he had got
Michael Howe's, and Watts had his own; healfofhewed
Williams the two knives he had taken, but declined the of-
fered affiftance of the latter, as Howe was fecured. Upon
Drewe's return to Watts and Howe, they all proceeded to-
wards HobartTown; Watts with his gun loaded, walking before
Howe, and Drewe behind. After walking about 8 miles, Howe
found means to difengage his hands, and in an inftant ftabbed
Watts, with a knife which he had remaining fecreted about
perfon. Watts fell and dropped his gun, which Howe feized
at the moment, and with it (hot Drewe dead. Watts now


dreaded a fimilar fate; for on afking Howe if he had killed
Slambow, he replied "yes, and I'll ferve you the fame as foon as
1 can load the piece." Waits then ran about 200 yards, and lay
down amongft fome brufh, being faint and cold from lofs of
blood. As foon as he was able to walk, he contrived to reach
a fettler's houfe not far diftant, and, after being put to bed, told
the owner that he had been (tabbed by Howe, requefting the
diftri£t conftable might be fent for, to take him to town. Up-
on the arrival of the latter, Watts could only utter his own
name j but the next morning he told the conftable that Drev/e
was killed. The body was found about half a mile from the
houfe where Watts lay, and was conveyed to Hobart Town
for a Coroner's Inqueft, whofe verdift was " That the deceafed
William Drewe was murdered by Michael Howe."
Watts was conveyed to gaol in a weakly ttate : he was a
runaway from Newc&ftle, and was fent to Sydney in the Pilot,
but under no criminal charge, where he died in the General
Hofpital, of the wounds received from Howe, in three days
t :'4
after his arrival.
As foon as the melancholy circumftance of the murder of
Drewe was communicated to the Lieutenant Governor, he
iffued another Proclamation, promifing, in addition to the
former reward of 100 guineas, for the apprehenfion of Howe,
a ftrong recommendation for a free pardon and pafTage to Eng-
land, to any crown prifoner who would be the means of appre-
hending that great murderer, He was, however, not again
feen for fome time.


On the 25th of October, Collier was tried before the
Criminal Court at Sydney, and conri&ed on the cleareft evi-
dence of being one of the murderers of Carlifle and O'Birne :
he received fentence of death, to be executed at Hobart Town,
and his body to be diffe&ed. In December he was fent back
to this Settlement j and fuffered the fentence of the Law on
the £6th of January, 1818. From the moment of this man's
being taken, he profefTed to entertain no hope of mercy, but to
prefer death, to the life he had lately led : he died penitent.
The once formidable gang, and the fyitem of bufh-ranging
as an armed banditti, producing in ita progrefs great terror and
mifchief to the community, checking the views and paralyzing
the efforts of the fettlers of this infant Colony, might now be
confidered annihilated; for, though Howe, the moft hardened
and fanguinary of the whole, (till remained to be taken, yet he
was cutoff from affociation with man.
After the murder of Drewe, he was fuppofed to have buried
himfelf in unknown and inacceflible parts of the woods : the
neceffity of procuring ammunition and fupplies to prolong his
wretched exiflence, compelled, however, his occadonalappear-
ance ; and thefe fupplies he obtained by robbing diftant ftock*
keepers' huts; when he generally bore away with him as
much as he could carry, threatening inftant deftru&ion to any
perfon who would attempt to follow him, or trace his fteps.
But his race was nearly run; and, though after the murder
of Drewe and Watts, few would choofe to rifk a perfonal en-
counter with him, yet the confidence was pretty general that
he could not long exift under his prefent ciicumftanceg.


One or two fruitlefs attempts were made to take him by
f>ratagem. In the month of September, however, James
M'Gill, who was the previous year emancipated for fervices
a train ft the buflj-rangers with the 46th regiment, and who at
different periods continued an afliduou3 purfuit after him, came
fo clofely upon him that, in his hurry to efcape, Howe left
behind him his arms, ammunition, dogs, and knapfack, which
fell into the hands of M'Gill, and were brought to Hobart
Town.
The lofs of his piftols on this occafion was a ferious and irre-
parable one to Howe.
. '
In his knapfack was found a fort of journal of dreams j
which fliewftrongly the diftreffed ftate of his mind, and fome
tincture of fuperftition,
From this little book of kangaroo Ikin, written in kangaroo
blood, it appears that he frequently dreamt of being murdered
by natives, of feeing his old companions, Whitehead, Jones,
Geary, and Collier, of being nearly taken by a fpldier ; and, in
one inftance, humanity afferts itfelf even in the breaft .of
Michael Howe, for we find him recording that he dreamt of
his fifter.
It alfo appears from this memorandum book, that he had
always an idea of fettling in the woods; for it contains long,
lifts of fuch feeds as he wilhed to have. of vegetables, fruits
and even flowers!


After this period, but one or two trifling robbeiies are heard
of, in one of which he furnifhed himfelt with a gunj
and anxioufly inquired for piftols, before we come to the eioflng
Icene of the career of this defperado.
✓
In the month of O&ober, a perfon named Warburton, in the
habir of hunting kangaroo for fkins, who had occaflonal oppor-
tunities of feeing Howe, communicated to a crown prifoner,
named Thomas Worrall, ftock-keeper to Edward Lord, Efq.
a fcheme for taking him. Worrall agreed to the trial, and
with private William Pugh, of the 48lh regiment, a man of
known courage, and recommended by Major Bell for this fer-
vice, determined to lay in wait at a hut on the Shannon River,
likely to be vifited by Howe for fupplies. Warburton was to
look out for the approach of Howe, and to induce him to come
to the hut, under a promife of ammunition ; at the fame time
to fignify his approach by a whiftle.—This plan proved fuccefi-
ful. On the 2lftof October, Howe met Warburton near the
place already mentioned ; he, however, exhibited much diftruft
of the intention of the latter, and great hefitation in advancing
near the hut,—-often disappearing to fee if any one were watch-
ing him. At length, after three hours indeterminate confider-
ation, allured by promifes of ammunition, which Warburton
faid was in the hut, be ventured to enter the door, his mufket
cocked and levelled ; when Pugh inftantly fired, but miffed
him# Howe fimply exclaimed *' Is that your game/' and pre-
cipitately retreated, but at the fame lime fired and miffed alfo;
;* ' *
Pugh and Worrall immediately ruflied out to run him down,
and the latter fired, but none of the {hot a took effedt. Pugh
and Worrall gained upon Howe; and now he muft for once


fjaite fcit appalled of his piftols fhortly before, no
St me allowed for a feeond charge, and hi* purfuers gaming
ground, nothing but a miracle could effea his deliverance.—
iPugh and Worrall had now come up with him; A fevere en-
counter enfued; and finally, from well-dire&ed blows on his
head with their mufkets, fell and expired without fpeakwg the
Ja&of? lawlefs, murderous banditti '.-—exhibiting in his career
and end the ftrongeft proof of flow but certain retributive juf*
lice; which, though it was baffled for a feafon, in the end
overwhelmed this wretched violator of its moft facred Laws
with more ftriking vengeance ; after making him diredUy or
indireaiy the inflrument of deftruaion to thofe conneaed with
him in his dreadful outrages, he himfelf clofed the fcene ! an
awful example which Cannot be too firongly impreffed upon the
minds of all thofe who are inclined to prefer to the wholeforne
and mild Laws of civilized fcciety, a licentious life of unre-
ftraint j which can only be maintained by robbery and violence,
and which will furely end in murder and ignominious death!
Howe was of athletic make: he wore at the time of his
death a drefs made of kangaroo fkins ; had an extraordinary
Jong beard, and prefented altogether a terrific appearance.
face, perhaps in fome degree from affociating with it the recoi-
led ion of his crimes, exhibited ftrong marks of a murderer.
During his long career of guilt, he was never known toper-
form one humane a&: His body was interred on the fpot
where he fell i his head was brought to Hobart Town, and
fuffered to be feen by the people, to whom the end of tic
monfter afforded an inconceivable degree of fafiffa&iqn.


The reward due to the zeal and bravery of the perfons en-
gaged in ridding the world of this murderer was univerfallv
acknowledged to be well merited. His Honor Lieutenant
Governor Sorell iflued a Government and General Order, in
V/hich he ftrongly commended the a&ivity, intelligence, and
fpirit of private William Pugh, whom His Honor recommends
to His Excellency the Governor in Chief for the grcateft favor
he can receive. The deferving conduct of Thomas Worrali
His Honor alfo brings under the notice of His Excellency,
accompanied by a ftrong recommendation for a free pardon
and paflage to England, in purfuance of the terms of the
Proclamation.
The reward for Howe's apprehenfiort r was adjudged to be
divided in the following mannerTo Pugh £SO ; to Worrali
£4O , and to Warburton (who was not perfonally engaged)
£ls.
T H E following account of the unhappy end of Edward
Edwards and John Bowles, and the fudden disappearance of
Thomas Davenport, all crov/n fervanti, as conne&ed with
Howe's crimes, and adding to the number of thofe who fell by
his murderous hand, proceed from the fame authority :
After the banditti, in an early ffage, had taken a Govern-
ment boat from Port Dalrymple, they robbed Captain Town-


fort of a cafk of pork, and went to King's Ifland, where they
hid a box of tools in the fand : they next went to Cape Barren,
where they difagrecd and feperated A further difpute arofc,
when Howe, it is ftated, deliberately (hot Edwards, in the
prefence of Jones and Whitehead.
On a fubfcqucnt occafion, at a creek on Salt-pan Plains,
Bowles having fportively difcharged a piftol over Howe s
head, the latter in a wanton and cruel manner tied Bowles,
hand and feet, and then coolly (hot him dead.
Thomas Davenport, who was an aligned fcrvant to Mr, D,
Stanfield, obtained his matter's permiflion to hunt kangaroo in
she interior of the country; taking with him a mufket, dogs,
and other neceflaries. He had not been abfent more than three
days, when his dogs returned without him.—This circum-
ftancc created much anxiety, which was Increafed by Daven

port not being heard of, and all inquiry alter him proving
unavailing, for fome time. At length Warburton (mentioned
in the foregoing narrative), in a convention with Howe, was
told by him that Davenport was killed by the natives. The
general belief, however, is that Howe had met Davenport,
and in fome way been the caufe of his death j—perhaps facri*
ficedhim on a refufal to join in his enormities.


The public have thus a brief narrative of the chief events of
Ihe laft fix years of Howe's life; comprifing a feries of crimes
committed with the cooleft indifference. Many committed
previoufly to the furrender of the gang, and others of lefs enor-
mity, have been omitted; and moft of the information given
by himfelf disregarded as proceeding from Such a man.
The buSh-rangers had no fixed place of general rendezvous,
or any regular fyftem ;—they were, of neceflity, constantly
moving about the woods; frequently without the common Sup-
port and necefiaries of life, and expofed to muchhardfhip. They
