INTRODUCTION.
THL STATE OF VICTORIA is situated at tFie South-
Eastern extremity of tFie mainland of tFie Commonwealth
of Australia. Its length and breadth are 420 miles and
250 miles respectively, making an area 87,884 square
miles (56,245,760 acres), which is about equal in size to
Great Britain.
THL VICTORIAN CLIMATL is bright and genial,
and resembles that of California and Southern Europe.
The rainfall varies in different parts, the general average
for 47 years being 26.42 inches per annum. The mean
temperatures are 49.2 degrees in Winter and 65.3 degrees
in Summer (Fahrenheit). Seasons pass from one to the
other with little perceptible change, and open-air work can
be carried on all the year round without inconvenience.
Thousands of people residing in Victoria have never
seen snow. Horses, cattle and sheep thrive in the open
fields at all seasons and are fattened on the natural
pastures alone.
VICTORIA was created a self-governing colony in
1851. Almost simultaneously gold was discovered at
Clunes, Ballarat and Bendigo, and this proved most
opportune and important to the establishment of the new
colony, as it caused thousands of people to stream into
the country in search of the precious metal. The six
years following saw the population rise from 77,000 to
5
Victoria for the Settler.


Victoria.
The value of the Dairying and Pastoral products of Victoria for 1910 was
£12.643,279 ( 860,687,740).
463,000 people, and a notable period in the annals of
Victoria was the year 1857. The fever of the gold rushes
was dying out, railway systems commenced to spread
over the country, good water-supply facilities were estab-
lished, and it is from this year the beginning of Victoria’s
steady growth in agriculture, manufacture and commerce,
might be dated.
RURAL INDUSTRIES have steadily developed ever
since, and year by year have increased with astonishing
rapidity. As the shallow alluvial diggings became worked
out the population began to settle on the land, and it
was soon found that every agricultural product which
could be grown in England, France, Spain or Italy, could
also be successfully grown in Victoria. Millions of acres,
which at one time only carried sheep and gave employ-
ment to a few station hands, are now prosperous farming
communities. During the past few years thousands of
acres have been brought under irrigation, and results have
been achieved by the advanced methods of cultivation
now being carried on that Victoria may be said to be one
of the foremost agricultural countries of the world.
THE RAILWAY SYSTEMS OF VICTORIA are owned
and controlled by the State Government. Their ramifica-
tions are so extensive and systematic that only a small
portion of the cultivated areas of the State are outside
a limit of fifteen miles from a railway. The length of lines
completed to date (Ist January, 1912) is 3,528 miles, and 860
stations are provided for the convenience of passengers
and for freight purposes. Cool storage sheds and
refrigerating cars for the care and carriage of perishable
products are available. The most modern types of

locomotives, passenger and freight cars are constructed at
the Government railway workshops at Newport. Taken
on the whole, the Victorian Railways system, costing
£43,091,478 ($206,839,095), forms one of the most
advanced systems of railway transport in the world.
ALTHOUGH VICTORIA 15 THE MOST THICKLY
SETTLED of all the Australian States, it has only a popu-
lation of 1,315 000 people, or about 14 persons to the
square mile, and consequently a much larger population
may be expected. It is purely a white man’s country, the
aboriginal and Chinese population totalling only 9,300
souls. The Immigration Restriction Act is rigidly enforced
by the Commonwealth Government, but there is no
restriction on European, Canadian or American people of
the white race. They are readily assimilated with the
general population, and find themselves, as it were, “at
home,” and experience no difficulty in adapting themselves
to Victorian conditions. All new arrivals are accorded the
same treatment and granted the same concessions as are
available to native-born Victorians.
MELBOURNE, the capital of Victoria, has steadily de-
veloped, and a few remarks on its phenomenal growth
may here prove interesting. In 1836, the population
numbered 142 males and 35 females, and 13 buildings
were in existence. In 1837, Melbourne was surveyed
and sold in half acre allotments. At the first sale the
allotments realised an average price of £35 each and at
the second sale £42 each. In this year the population
increased to 800 souls. Matters progressed steadily in
the new settlement until 1851 when the number reached
a total of 77,000 souls.

MELBOURNE TO-DAY is the eighth city in the British
Empire, and has a population of 588,000. The streets of
the city proper aggregate over 100 miles in length ; they
run at right angles, are 99 feet wide, and are paved with
wooden blocks. Electricity is generally used for lighting
and power purposes. The public and private buildings are
palatial in character, and compare favourably in architecture
with those in any other city of the world. At the present
time Melbourne is the seat of Government for the
Commonwealth of Australia as well as for the State of
Victoria. It is also the leading manufacturing and dis-
tributing centre of the Commonwealth its geographical
position naturally adapting it for these purposes, as it is
the midway point between the various other states.
OTHER CITIES are established at various centres,
and thriving towns are located throughout the State, each
having schoolhouses, churches, post-offices, banking and
trade conveniences, shops, markets, &c. Pioneering stages
and difficulties are therefore overcome and further settle-
ment has the advantages of established facilities. The
most modern farming appliances, and every kind of seed
and plant are to be purchased locally at reasonable prices.
MARKETS FOR ALL PRODUCE are available, es-
pecially for wheat wool, fruit, butter and cheese. Apart
from the extensive local requirements there is an ever-
increasing oversea trade. Large quantities of all classes
of produce are also sent to the other States. Wool, wheat,
frozen meats, wine, butter and fruit, etc. are being exported
in enormous quantities.
CO-OPERATIVE BUTTER FACTORIES, creameries,
stock markets, are established in almost every district.

Viticulture! Products to the value of £207,795 ($997,416) were raised in
Victoria in 1910.
Dairying, fruit-growing, and general farming are sure
methods of securing safe and comfortable livelihoods.
Cereal and root crops give good yields, which compare
favorably with those of other countries. Fruits of all kinds,
up to the subtropical varieties grow in profusion. Lucerne
(alfalfa) will give up to six cuttings, and, in favorable circum-
stances, seven and sometimes eight cuttings per annum.
EDUCATION 15 FREE, secular and compulsory, and
the existing state schools number 2,035. Scholarships
are available to every scholar, even in the most remote
localities, and these enable successful students to advance
continuously by certain stages right up to the University.
Agricultural Colleges and Technical Schools are established
in various centres of the State.

State, either as orchardists, dairy farmers, or in some other
form of irrigated agriculture, with sure signs of success.
THE CAPITAL NECESSARY for a settler to
possess on starting operations should not be less than £3OO
(SI,500), and with that amount, if he be an experienced
man there is a broad field open to him.
ALL STEAMSHIPS ARRIVING at Melbourne are met
in Hobson’s Bay by Officers of the Intelligence Bureau,
who have been specially selected to give advice and
assistance to new-comers. Their duties are to assist new
arrivals in any necessity which may arise.

THE IRRIGATION AREAS.
THL IRRIGATION AREAS are situated in the Northern
and North-Western districts of the State. The largest of
the irrigation systems is that known as the Goulburn
Scheme, and this controls a large area which is now being
settled as irrigable farms. The land is situated about 130
miles north of Melbourne, and connected with it by three
separate lines of railways.
SEVERAL LARGE, TOWNS are situated within this
area: —Kyabram, Shepparlon, Rochester, Bendigo, Kerang,
Swan Hill, Echuca, &c., where all products, agricultural
machinery, &c. may be obtained ; they are also market
towns, where banking and trade facilities of all kinds are
available. Throughout the whole of the districts, postal,
school, church and other facilities are available, and as
settlement proceeds more will be provided.
AGRICULTURE AND DAIRYING. Owing to the
extreme mildness of the Winter, a very wide range of
products may be grown on land in the irrigated districts.
Fruits of the temperate and semi-tropical varieties may be
most successfully grown. Two cultivated crops per annum
may be raised, and five, six or even more cuttings of
alfalfa (lucerne) hay. For the latter product there is a
fine market, although the g eater proportion grown will be
fed on the farms rather than sold as hay. The reason for
21


Victoria.
5,386,247 acres of land are under Cultivation in Victoria.
this is that the dairying industry, owing to its high develop-
ment, and secure profits, offers the best inducements to
settlers on the land. Throughout the irrigation areas,
creameries and butter factories are already established, and,
in the near future, canneries for fruit and vegetables will
follow. In dairying, the rule is for the farmers to sell their
cream to the butter factories, keeping the skim milk to feed
the pigs. The price for butter fat averages from 1 Od. to 11 d.
(20 to 22 cents) per lb. A settler on a4oto 50 acre block,
with 20 acres under alfalfa (lucerne) can feed a milking
herd of 30 cows, and the returns for cream and from the
skim milk should bring in a revenue of from £lO ( Sso'oo )
to £l5 (575‘00) per cow per annum.
DISTRIBUTION AND COST OF WATLR.—Settlers
in the Victorian irrigation districts need have no fear of
water-right controversies. The State, which owns all
water-supply systems, does not desire to make any profits,
and intends to charge irrigators only enough to meet
interest and maintenance expenses, and to provide a
liquidation fund of 2 per cent. As this fund reduces the
liabilities, the price of water will be correspondingly reduced.
THE. PRODUCE. RAISE.D under irrigation is most
diversified in character. Sultanas average not less than
one ton of dried fruits to the acre, which will return to
the grower (at present rates) £27 (S130‘00) per acre, after
deducting all expenses. Crops of sultanas have yielded
as much as two tons to the acre. Currants, as a rule, yield
more than sultanas, reaching (in some cases) as high as
3 tons to the acre. Oranges and lemons have returned

THE GOULBURN IRRIGATION
SYSTEM.
The Goulburn System (the largest of the Victorian
Irrigation Systems) draws its supplies from the Goulburn
River, which rises in the heart of the Australian Alps,
where the rainfall exceeds sixty inches per annum. This
supply, coupled with the melting of the Winter snows,
provides a permanent supply of water. In addition, as
the parent stream flows onwards, it is supplemented by
numerous perennial streams until it reaches Alexandra,
where it is a fine broad river, clear as crystal, and teem-
ing with fish. Hence, constantly being added to by other
streams, it flows on to Wahring, the site of the Goulburn
Weir.
At this point the Goulburn River has the largest and
most uniform flow of any river in Victoria, its average
annual discharge over a period of twenty years exceed-
ing 2,000,000 acre feet.
The system is now nearing completion. Reservoirs
have already been constructed with a capacity of 220,000
acre feet, and surveys have been made which will
increase this storage to 1,400,000 acre feet. This stored
water, together with the supplies which can always be
drawn from the river, will provide ample provision in the
dryest seasons for those who grow crops of a high
acreage value, and is sufficient to supply at least two
acre feet of water over the whole of the 750,000 acres
of land which is commanded by the system.

The Goulburn Weir is constructed of granite, and
rises fifty feet from the bed of the stream. Its width from
bank to bank is 400 feet. Above the granite substructure
are a series of flood gates extending right across the river.
These gates are operated by turbines, and when raised
provide a storage in the basin above the weir equal to
20,661 acre feet of water. ( The statute acre of fLngland
and the United States contains 4,840 square yards, or
43,560 square feet. An acre foot represents one foot
depth of water over this area, or 43,560 cubic feet).
On either side of the Weir is an irrigation channel.
The eastern one is 38 feet wide at the bottom and 56 feet
at the top, with a carrying depth of 6 feet. The western,
or main channel, is much larger, being 1 10 feet wide at
the bottom and 131 feet at the top, with a carrying
depth of 7 feet. The latter channel supplies the water
for the longala, Koyuga, Rochester and Bamawm irriga.
tion districts, and it can be seen how adequate the supply
is for the land now being opened up
After leaving the Weir the main channel conveys the
water a distance of twenty-four miles to the Waranga
Basin. This artificial lake has a storage capacity of
196,000 acre feet; and this can be increased, by raising
the level 10 feet, to a total storage of 326,000 acre feet.
I he basin was created by building an earthen wall 4J miles
long and 31 feet high. It has two outlets, one supplying
the Rodney channels having a capacity of 300 cubic feet
per second, and the other supplying the Waranga-Mallee
channels with a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet per second.
These works are now nearly completed, and will convey

the water 63 miles westward from the Waranga Basin to
the Picaninny Creek, into which surplus water will be
discharged. From this channel smaller channels run in
a northerly direction ail along its course. These in
their turn fill subsidiary channels, from which settlers
obtain their supplies of water.
Ihe configuration of the country is such that
the whole of the main, subsidiary and distributing
channels are operated by means of gravitation only.
Water can, therefore, be conveyed from the head waters
to the settlers’ land at a minimum of cost; and it can be
confidently stated that the charge made for water from
this system may be classed as one of the lowest in the
world.
The areas commanded by this system have an ideal
climate for the practice of irrigation. The varieties of
crops which may be grown are practically unlimited. Not
only are markets available locally for all kinds of produce,
but growing markets are being established for fresh, dried
and canned fruits of all kinds, pickles, and canned
vegetables, in Asia and South Africa; to say nothing of
those already existing in Europe and North America,
where markets are assured owing to the reversal of the
seasons.
The areas now available, and those to be made
available in the immediate future in these irrigation
districts will not only provide ample land for settlement,
but also lucrative employment for thousands of men,
women, and youths of both sexes, in one of the best
countries and climates in the world.

OiHLR IRRIGATION SYSTELMS.
Practically all the rivers flowing northward from the
main Dividing Range of Victoria have weirs constructed
across them for the purpose of conserving water for
domestic and stock supplies, and in many cases also for
irrigation purposes
At Swan Hill, Cohuna, Nyah, Mildura and White Cliffs,
powerful pumping plants have been erected which raise
the water to a sufficient height to enable it to gravitate
over the country back from tlie river. In each of these
districts irrigation has proved a marked success, although
the water is supplied at a slightly increased cost to that
of the Goulburn System.
THE DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE.
The Department of Agriculture maintains a staff of
experts in every branch of agricultural industry. These
officers, if requested, will advise and instruct settlers free
of charge whilst they are getting their allotments into
working order. They will also advise them when pur-
chasing stock, &c.
The Department also issues pamphlets and books
on every branch of farming. The Journal of the Depart-
ment. which deals with all phases of up-to-date agriculture,
is issued monthly, the subscription for which is 3/- ( so‘72)
per annum, including postage. Other works are published,
which deal with special subjects, lists of which will be
supplied on application to the Department.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR
SETTLEMENT.
THE CLOSER SETTLEMENT ACTS OF VICTORIA.
For the purpose of more closely settling the lands of
the State, a “ Lands Purchase and Management Board ”
has been established by the Government. This body is
entrusted with the important duty of resuming by pur-
chase large privately-owned estates, subdividing them into
farms, and making them available to persons in quest of
land. Care is taken to acquire areas that are thoroughly
adapted to irrigation, dairying, mixed, or other particular
classes of farming; convenient to railways, markets, &c.;
and with reasonable facilities to reach the Metropolis and
the seaboard.
When a large estate has been acquired and sub-
divided, it is disposed of either as farm allotments or as
agricultural labourers’ allotments.
FARM ALLOTMENTS.
FARM ALLOTMENTS are available up to a maxi-
mum value of £2.500 ($12,500), or. in the case of an
occasional homestead, up to £4,000 ($20,000) in value,
on the following conditions: —
DEPOSIT: —3 per cent, of the Value of the land, plus
£1 ($4 80) fee for preparation of lease and ss. (SL2O)
registration fee.
HALF-YEARLY INSTALMENTS. —3 per cent, (equal
to 6 per cent, per annum) of the balance remaining after
deducting the amount of deposit.

TERM OF LEASE. —3l \ years, when, unless the
purchase is completed sooner, the land becomes the
property of the lessee.
INTEREST CFIARGED. per cent, per annum,
which is included in the half-yearly instalment of 3 per
cent.
SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS of instalments, equal
to a maximum amount of 60 per cent, of the value of the
improvements effected by the lessee, may be obtained,
and such deferred instalments may be paid over a period
agreed upon between the lessee and the Board, interest
being charged at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum.
AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS’
ALLOTMENTS.
AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS’ ALLOTMENTS are
available up to a maximum value of £2OO (81,000), and
these allotments are made available in large estates with
the object not only of providing workmen for the farmer,
but also of providing for the agricultural labourer an
allotment he may work in his spare time, or with the
assistance of his family. The terms of purchase are the
same as for farm allotments.
IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY.
FOR A FARM ALLOTMENT. —To the value of two
instalments of purchase money by the end of the first
year, 10 per cent, of the value of the land by the end of
the third year, and to a total value of 20 per cent, of the
value of the land by the end of the sixth year.

FOR AN AGRICULTURAL LABOURER’S ALLOT-
MENT. A substantial dwelling house to the value of at
least £5O must be erected the first year, and the allotment
enclosed by a fence by the end of the second year.
HOUSES FOR SETTLERS may be built by the State,
and payment for the same spread over fifteen years. This
forms a most valuable aid to the settlers, and it not only
lessens the drain on their capital, but enables them to
immediately prepare their land for planting crops. In
addition, the State may grade land in the irrigation
districts in anticipation of the arrival of new-comers; and
thus enable them to start seeding operations much earlier
than if they commenced the work on arrival. The work of
grading is charged for at cost price only.
RAILWAY CONCESSIONS TO LAND
SETTLERS IN VICTORIA.
A bona fide land seeker in Victoria may obtain a railway
ticket at half ordinary rates to enable him to inspect the
land available in whatever portion of the State land is
ready for settlement.
When travelling to take possession of the allotment he
has selected, a settler obtains railway tickets at half-rates for
himself, wife and family ; and his goods, chattels and effects
are carried at specially reduced rates. In the case of
Irrigation Lands free railway tickets are issued to go into
possession, and the amount paid for railway fare when
inspecting land is refunded.

SUGAR BEET.
THE. SUGAR BE.LT INDUSTRY.—In order to test
the suitability of Victorian soil and climate for the growing of
sugar beets, a beet sugar factory has been erected at
Maffra, in the South-eastern part of the State, which has
a capacity of 350 tons of beet daily.
This factory was operated last season with satisfactory
results. The average yield of beets for the district was
13'4 tons to the acre, and in normal seasons the average
per cent, of sugar in the beets should be from 14 to 18
per cent, of pure sugar.
The factory at Maffra is situated within 200 yards of
the railway station, and is connected with it by two lines
of railway. The building is of a bold design and built in
such a manner that it may be greatly enlarged.
The sugar extracted realised in the Melbourne
Markets from £22 (5105’60) to £24 (SI 15'20) per ton,
proving that the quality was all that could be desired, in
fact, equal to the very highest quality of refined sugar.
It is confidently expected that as the farmers become
more conversant with the cultural details of the crop,
and realise the profits which can be derived therefrom,
the area devoted to the industry will be increased so
that the factory will be worked to its fullest capacity.
It is calculated that the profit from beet-growing,
after paying all expenses, is at least 8/- (Sl'92) per ton,
and when the farmer provides the labour himself it should

£269,450 ($1,293,360)
work out at from £8 ($38*40) to £l2 ($57'60) per acre.
The natural conditions of the district are peculiarly favor-
able to the growth of beet, and there is no doubt that
the Industry will become successfully established.
COMPARISON OF VICTORIAN AND AMERICAN
ESTIMATES FOR GROWING AN ACRE

In order to ascertain the relative costs charged for
the same operations by the Victorian beet grower and
his American cousin, the following estimate from The

most recent publication on the beet industry is given:—
The Government owns a considerable area of land
in the vicinity of the sugar factory, which is offered to

fettlers under the same conditions as the State lands in
the irrigation areas. The price usually paid for beets is
at the rate of 20/- per ton.
PREPARATION OF LAND
FOR IRRIGATION.
The State renders the following assistance to settlers
in the grading of land; —
1. It rents settlers grading tools at the nominal
charge of 2/6 a day, thus saving the settler a
large expenditure on these implements.
2. It furnishes at a nominal cost contour plans
showing the direction of the slopes, thus en-
abling the settler to tell how his land should
be graded.
3. It grades from 5 to 20 acres on about one-
third of the blocks in advance of settlement,
and adds the cost of this to the price of the
land.
The settler, therefore, has the option of either doing
his own work or of taking a block where a part of the
work has already been done. During the past year the
State has in this way graded about 3,000 acres of land
for settlers, the cost varying from £2 to £4 per acre,
or approximately SlO to S2O.
