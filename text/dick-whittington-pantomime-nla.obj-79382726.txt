REPORT ON ANALYSIS OF
Scandinavian
Condensed CDilk
PARIS GOLD MEDAL BRAND.
I HAVE analysed this milk, purchasing it myself in
the shops of Melbourne, and found it to be per-
fectly sweet, agreeable to the taste, and free from the
least trace of change. The analysis proved that it is
manufactured in accordance with the best modem
scientific method, from pure, fresh milk. This prepara-
tion is indeed unusually well-made, uniform in character,
smooth, and readily mixes with water, and it is then
eminently suitable for infants, invalids, and all dietetic
purposes.
C. R. BLACKETT.

A Dialogue Overheard in Bourke Street.
Mrs. Suburbs : ?Mj dear Mrs. Roundtown, how are you ? I haven?t seen
you since you were nearly distracted over that troublesome servant you had.
You are looking so much better since then ; I should think you had got to the
end of your troubles, which is not the case with me, I can assure you.?
Mbs. Roundtown : ? You may well congratulate me, dear Mrs. Suburbs,
for in place of the lazy, untidy, wasteful girl who used to help Helen, I have got
another servant, a good, reliable one too, and at the cost of only twenty-four
shillings a year.?
Mrs. Suburbs : ? Surely, Mrs. Roundtown, you must be jesting, for it is
impossible (as I very well know) to obtain even a girl in or around Melbourne
for ten times that sum, and now they have a union of their own they are more
saucy and independent than ever. I declare the worry mine causes me is putting
me into my grave.?
Mrs, Roundtown : ?Why, then, don?t you go at once and engage one like
mine, for there are numbers of them to be obtained at the sam e place, and they
are guaranteed not to be saucy or to join any unions whatever/?
Mbs. Suburbs ; ?Are you really in earnest ? For I should be only too glad
if I knew of any Registry Office where a good servant such as you speak of could
had for love or money. Do tell me, dear Mrs. Roundtown, all about it at once.?
Mbs. Roundtown : ?Well, not to keep you in suspense any longer, you
know how I used to keep two girls until I had to get rid of the one you spoke of.
Helen, as you know, is a good servant, whom I have had for years, but the
younger girl who did the sweeping, dusting, coal carrying, &c., and hel ed in the
kitchen, gave me so much trouble that I determined to do without her.?p
Mbs. Suburbs : ?So you advertised for another ??
Mbs. Roundtown : ? Not by any means. I thought I would try a new lan,
so I paid a visit to the METROPOLITAN GAS COMPANY?S SHPOW
ROOM in Flinders Lane (behind the Cathedral, you know), hired a GAS
COOKING STOVE, got Mr. Roundtown to buy me a GAS FIRE and a
BATH HEATER (it was then winter time), and now with a little occasional
assistance from me, Helen manages splendidly, and I have no complaints as I
had before.?
Mbs. Suburbs ; ? And can you really manage with only one servant, and
with your large family, too ??*
Mrs. Roundtown : ? Yes. For we have now no smoke or soot from the
fire, no carrying of coals up and down stairs, less dust on the furniture and
carpets, and best of all, day or night, at short notice, we can have a warm room,
hot water, or a meal at a trifling cost. During the dreadful f La Grippe 5 time
I assure you these conveniences were priceless, and now the summer is coming
on the COOKING STOVE will spare us the annoyance of waiting till the fire
burns up on the one hand, or being roasted to death by the fire being kept in
when not in use on the other. You give my plan a trial, my dear Mrs. Suburbs,
and I am sure you will not regret it.?
Mrs. Suburbs : ?I will go there this very day.?

Alter my unlucky course,
By a sure dead bird for the Cup ;
So I plunged on a horse.
I was told that he could not lose;
Counted my chicks as hatched ;
He caught a cold a month before,
And so that horse was scratched,
With the melancholy result that
I?m selling up the happy home, &c.
Backing horses is a mug?s game, so I?m going
to give it best, &c.

? Bubbles .?
I look just like a picture?well, that is what I
claim;
I?ve only just this moment stepped to see you
from my frame.
The artist hand that painted me with magic
power was rife,
And when the evening shadows fall I am endowed
with life.
I wander here and there at will, and some
curious sights I see ;
And life itself is very like the bubbles blown by
The rich and poor, the high and low, their
bubbles blow in turn ,
It?s only when they melt the air their hollow-
ness is shown.
Chobus.
Bubbles reflecting the tints of the sun are
broke upwards, or are broken and done ;
Bubbles of hope, love, joy, gladness, despair,?
These, too, are bubbles which melt into air.
I stood at Epsom on the downs, it was the
Derby day,
I saw the myriad faces like a white sea turned
one way.
I heard the mighty tumult as the horses dashed
along,
And I marked a pale-faced stripling amidst that
sporting throng.
I saw him gaze with horror! Oh, God, what
have I done P
My governor?s money gone, and the horse I
backed not won !
How can I face my mother; a flash, a puff of
smoke,
A stifled cry, a heavy fall, his Bubble?s blown
