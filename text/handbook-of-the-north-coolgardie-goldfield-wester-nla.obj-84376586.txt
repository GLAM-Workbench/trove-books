Do rl t) Go© err die Gold icld.
fyy'HE North Coolgardie Goldfield comprises an area of
gjlG) 112,221 sq. miles—a tra<’k of country larger than Scotland
and little less than Ireland. Three hundred miles from the
nearest coast, with a uniform altitude of about 1,400 feet above
sea level, sparcely covered, for the most part, with stunted
scrub, in which mulga. bulloak, and other neutral tinted
bushes predominate; with chains of lakes in which it is the
exception to find water, and the rule to contain nothing more
substantial than mirage. A country that the aboriginal
shunned, except at certain seasons of the year when the gna-
mma holes contained a little water and there was a possibility
of finding an emu, turkey, or kangaroo, that had strayed
from a more hospitable region. In such a dreary, barren
waste the wonder is not that its mineral wealth remained so
long undiscovered, though almost within hail of the hardiest
pioneers in the world, but that men should have been found
venturesome enough to brave its dangers, which were certain,
in search of gold, 'he existence of which was, to say the least,
problematical. But the gold hunter knows no fear, and the
satirist who said that if it were known there was gold at the
north pole, not only would the pole itself be reached, but a
settlement would be established there within ttie year, knew
something of the miners’ character.
If the climate be unsuitable for vegetation, at least it is
pleasant to live in. The heat of summer is great, but it is
dry. and the nights as a rule are cool. The only really trying
weather throughout the year is when thunder clouds hang
round for a week or so at a time, threatening rain, and only
a sprinkle falling.
The official reading of the thermometer for the last two
years was Highest shade I BT2, lowest 33*0; mean maximum
78’0, and mean minimum 53*0 Fahrenheit. That at one time
the rainfall was greater than now is evidenced by the exis-
tence of a few goodly sized gums, and the remains of wide,
and in some cases, deep watercourses. Proofs of the existence
of a burrowing marsupial, commonly called a “ boodie,” are
also manifest, showing that, for a time at least, grass, or other
succulent herbage, grew. But now there is little or no


animal life in the bash, except for a short time in the year,
when pools of water attract a few migratory birds, 'the
oppressive silence, the fearful sense of complete isolation, and
the knowledge of the total absence of anything solid, or fluid
with which to sustain life, drives mad the unfortunate “doing
a perish ” in a very few hours.
But in spring,after suitable rains,the display of wild flowers
is enchanting ; every bush blossoms, and the brilliance of the
varied blooms is in strong contrast to the sombre hue of the
foliage. Under foot,the ground is carpeted with flowers,all the
colors of the rainbow, many of them immortelles, with a filling
in of green, to prove the soil is there, and that if it had
sufficient moisture, would yield plentifully.
The writer of the early days of a place—when that place is
only some six years old—has a difficulty to contend with that
the modern compiler of ancient history wot not of. The peo-
ple he wrote of were all comfortably dead some centuries
before, and therefore not in a position to argue the point with
him. But to state definitely who was the first prospector or
party of prospectors of the North Coolgardie Field, is to issue a
challenge to a number of live men—men very much alive to
the honor attributable to the earth st pioneer.
Under such circumstances, the 'safest course to pursue is
to prove from the government records who took up and regi-
stered the first leases in the various districts.
North Coolgardie’s official birth as a mining field took
place on the sth of June, 1893, when Messrs. Ottowand party
applied at the Coolgardie Registrars Office f. r a lease at
Goongarrie, or, as it was then called the 90-mile.
Numerous applications foi leases followed, and, as the pro-
spects of the district looked encouraging, the first registrar’s
office on the field was opened there in October, 1894.
It may be of interest to mention that subsequently pegs
branded 1890 were found at Ularring, enclosing what was
evidently intended for a mining lease; but the department
contains no record of its having been applied for. It is sup-
posed that a member of an explorer’s party marked it
off, and took no further Interest in it.
The North Coolgardie Field has been sub-divided into four
districts, as follows: —
Menzies - - comprising 3,203 square miles.
Niagara - - „ 771
Ycrilla - - ~ 15,747
Ularring - - „ 12.500 „
In these districts nine townships have been gazetted,
viz :


467 miles from Perth.

Tampa - - 12 ~ North of Niagara.
Menzies, Goongarrie, Niagara, and Tampa have a daily-
mail from Perth. Yerilla, Pendinuie, and Mount Ida, weekly
(on Fridays), and Mulline and Callion. weekly, on (Sundays)
from Menzies.
Menzies, Niagara, Goongarrie, Yerilla, and 1 endinme are
telegraph stations.
The Parliamentary representatives for the Legislative
Council are Hon. Alec. P. Matheson, M.L.C.; Hon, H. G.
Parsons, M.L.C., and Hon. A. <C Jenkins, M.L.C.
The present, and first, member of the Legislative Assembly
for the field is Henry Gregory, Esq., M.L.A.
Warden and Resident Magistrate W. Lambden Owen, as
administrator for the local Government, has been in office
since May, 1896.
Two newspapers, a daily and a weekly, called respectively.
“The North Coolgardie Herald,” and “The Menzies Minei,
are published, at the office of the proprietor, Henry Gregory,
Esq.. M.L.A., in Menzies.
Both papers have a wide circulation, throughout the
district, and are conducted in an up-to-date manner; local
matters receiving due prominence, while the cable scivice
is the same as that supplied to the Perth press.
The population (including adults and children) is officially
estimated at 4,696 souls—4o7o males and 626 females.
During 1897, the number of births was 37; deaths, 81; and
marriages, 16. For 1898. births. 40; deaths, 23; and maiiiages.
22. The death rate was reduced from 14’55 in 1897. to 489
per thousand in 1898.
The only state school is located in Menzies. with a teach-
ing staff of head-master and two female assistants. Ihe
attendance for 1898 was 82 boys and 48 girls, in all 130 child-
ren—an increase of 56 over the previous year’s total.
The want of Schools in other parts is greatly felt, ami
Government has been approached by both Goongarrie anil
Niagara, ft was found by departmental inquiry that neither
possessed the requisite, number of children required by the Act,
consequently facilities of education have been denied them.


The average number of miners employed on the various
leases during last year was 1,223, distributed in the various
districts as follows : —Meuzies, 038; Ularring. 196; Niagara,
240; and Yerilla. 149.
Table A shows ruling rates of wages.
ALLUVIAL.
Alluvial discoveries have been made in various parts of the
field, notably at the 90 mile (Goongarrie), 4-Mile (Woolgar)
Tampa, Niagara. Lake Barlee, Mulline, and Pendinnie; where
rich deposits were found within a foot of the surface.
During the last twelve months the following five new finds
at depths ranging from 10 to 75 feet have been reported to the
department : —On the Pioneer lease, Imiles south of Meuzies;
at Yilgangie Soak, about 30 miles S.E. of Yerilla; on the
Glady’s June ion and Belle Maie leases, 2 miles south of
Mulline;on the Friday Flat, 1| miles west of Menzies, and
at a point about 3 miles S.W. of the township of Goongarrie.
Although, so far. no very sensational developments can be
reported of atiy of them, many still attract numbers of
prospectors, who, from time to time, have the luck to strike
rich patches, and pick up nurgets of exceptional size.
There is no doubt, however, that with a plentiful supply
of cheap water, the yield of gold from all of them would be
fairly large.
WATER.
The water question is perhaps the most important problem
that is exercising the minds of all who are interested in the
present and future of the field. The time has come when
an abundant supply of fresh water is an absolute necessity
to carry on the work of the mines, to say nothing of domestic
requirements.
During the past summer, most, if not all, the batteries were
either partially or completely stopped on account of an in-
adequate supply of salt water—the density of which prevents
the saving of much fine gold. Its price—about £1 per 1000
gallons—makes the cost of crushing so great, that only high
grade ore can be treated with a chance of a profit.
There are, on many leases, hundreds of tons of ore. ready
to hand, sufficiently rich to pay well if cru-hing expanses
could be reduced from 30s. or 355. per ton, the present price
charged by batteries crushing for the public, to about half
that sum.
Were this possible, claims now abandoned would be fully
manned, the output of gold largely increased, and a fresh
impetus given to the prosperity of the district.


As will be seen from table B, the average rainfall is about
41 inches per annum, and that June, and August, have,
so far, proved to be the rainy months. The showers are. as a
rule, heavy, falling sometimes at the rate of 2in. |er hour:
hence if proper catchments were prepared, large quantities of
water could be conserved, which at present run to waste, the
main difficulty 10 contend with is the porosity of the soil, which
prevents ordinary dams from holding water when caught
The government have, at considerable expense.constructed
two reservoirs—one an excavation lined with concrete—about
half a mile from Menzies with a holding capacity of 3.000.0(10
gallons, About £16,000 has been expended on it, but. so tar,
it has been a failure.
The last June rains about two-thirds filled it, but the weight
of wa'er cracked the concrete sides, which were not nearly
thick enough to support the weight of water, with the result
that all the water leake 1 out again, at the rate of 6m. per
diem. It has been repaired, but no rain of any consequence
having fallen since, it is still empty.
The other —a natural valley with an embankment built
across the lower end —has proved a decided success. It com-
prises an area of between 300 and 400 acres, and has a holding
capacity of 40,000,000 gallons. It is situated three miles
from Niagara, and the cost of construction amounted to about
£60,000. • „ , .
In January of this year, nearly 17,000,000 gallons of water
were caught from a rainfall of about 2in. in a few hours.
This being the first rain of any consequence that has fallen
since its completion, and therefore its first filling, it is sa .i-
--factory to know that Mr. C. Jobson, C. R.. inspected it m
March last, and expressed himself thoroughly satisfied with
the stability of the work.
As the people of Niagara do not want this water and the
people of Menzies do, the logical sequence is. that Govern-
ment should send the water where it is required, and where
the people are prepared to purchase it at the rate oi £1 l K “'
1000 gallons. ; . . .
Sir John Forrest, when on a tour through the district in
March, expressed himself in favor of the scheme, and
stated that he had instructed the Kngineer-m-Chief to piepare
an estimate of the cost to bring the water by pipe to
Menzies. ,
From Table C will be seen the localities where water lias
been found by sinking, the depths sunk, and the quality ot
water found.
GENERAL.
2124 leases, containing an area of 38,(>11 acres have, since
the opening of the first registrar’s office on the field, been


applied for; from winch the government has derived in
revenue the sum of £58,792 17s. 7d.
The number of leases in existence December, 1898 was 401
representing an area of 6,015 acres. (Table D). of course as
happens on every field, position blocks were taken up, held for
a time and then abandoned, but many leases are now lying idle
because the reefs exposed are 2nd < r 3rd grade ore, and can-
not at present be worked at a profit. Small parties at work
on others, pick stone for the batteries, leaving the balance to
be treated under more favorable circumstances.
The large quantity of machinery at work (Table E.). the
number of men employed, and the yield of gold 162,341 ounces
ualue £608,778 15s. (Table if.), clearly demonstrate the
mineral wealth of the field, and the miner’s confidence in its
permanency. Tho returns of sinking and driving totals to
1898, supplied to the department—sinking, 22,790 ft.; driving.
32.988 ft will give a fair idea of the amount of development
work done.
MENZIES DISTRICT.
L. R. Menzie, after whom the district is named, and J.
McDonald (representatives of a Perth syndicate) applied on
Ist October, 1894. for the first lease in, what is now known as
the Menzies district.
They were not, however, the first prospectors. A well-
equipped party came from the 90-mile in August of
that year, consisting of J. Brown, C. Kirby, and C. Jackman,
and bad, to a certain extent, developed a show about
2 miles south of the lease Menzie and McDonald applied for.
It did not turn out as expected, and the lease was not at that
time applied for, though afterwards it was taken up and called
the “Pioneer.”
Ihe lease, however, which Menzie obtained, was the
world-famed “LadyShjsntok” the leading mine in the district.
It Was floated into a company and registered in W.A., in
January, 1895, with a capital of £160,000, in £1 shares, and
comprises 2 leases, containing 36 acres. Four shafts have been
sunk to depths varying from 70 ft. to 290 ft. Total sinking,
480 ft.; driving 3374 ft.
The width of the reef varies irom 2 ft. to 20 ft. The total
amount of ore crushed—l3,9l9 tons, has yielded 44,806 ozs. of
gold, equal to about three and one-fifth ounces per ton.
Eight dividends of Is. per share have been paid, as follows ;
In 1896, one; in 1897, three; and in 1898, four.

MENZIES MUNICIPALITY.
Government established a Registrar’s office in Menzies on
Ist July, 1895, and the first Warden’s Court was held on the
24th of the same month.
A land sale of town blocks, on 9th October, at which 76
quarter acre blocks were sold, realised £25,555; 20 lots at
Goongarrie sold at the same time, fetched £2,444, making a
total of £27,999 for 24 acres of land, which, a few years before,
would have been dear at any price.
The post office was opened in November —Mr. C. Fisher,
Postmaster—and the Telegraph line from Coolgardie com-
pleted and in working order, on the Ist of December.
Menzies was declared a municipality Jduring the same


month, and the first Council elected in January, 18%; Henry
Gregory, Esq., being" appointed Mayor.
The present mayor is Dr.Corlis;and town clerk,Mr.P.Stuart.
So keen was the ex itement, and so great the anxiety to
be first in the rush, that the population of Men/.ies was almost
as large then as to-day. Businesses of every description were
established, from the -hop with the window showing ihe lone
bottle of soft stuff, or packet of cigarettes, to the emporium
where every requisite, and many luxuries could be obtained —
at a pi ice.
Curing the late depi ssion, which has been so general on
the fields and in the other Colonies, Menzies has held its own,
and has always been looked on as one of the most solvent
townships in the colony.
Being, at present, the terminus of the railway, it is the
great distributing centre for the district. The extension of
the line to Cue. which is only a question of time, wdll largely
benefit the field, and will tend rather to increase than de-
crease the volume of business done in Menzies.
The Municipal valuation of the capital value of property
for this year is £192,372, and the annual rateable value.
£32,008. The revenue for last year was £4.700, and the ex-
penditure, £4,554. The general rate is Is., and the health
rate fid in the £.
15 miles of roads and streets have been surveyed, 4£ miles
cleared, and 2| miles macadamised.
'i he number of shops, hotels and dwellings, some of which
are substantial stone and brick structures, is close on 500,
and the population about 3000— 2 500 males and 500 females.
Sanitary conditions are carefully looked after—double
sealed pan system being enforced —and, -taking into con-
sideration the scarcity of "-ater. are good. The Banks re-
presented are the Australasian, Western Australia, and Union.
Churches —Homan ( atholic, Church of England, Wesleyan
and salvation Army.
The following postal and telegraphic from dates
of opening to Feb., 1899, will serve to show the large
quantity of business transacted by this department. It will
also throw some light on the amount of money in circulation,
as the sums lodged in the savings bank, and transmitted through
the money order office, may be taken as representing so much
surplus cash over ordinary expenses.
Letters, outward. 738,900; inward, 870,220. Wires
transmitted, 111,250 (costing £10,516); received, 106,900.
The Money Order Office opened on the 4th March. 1896.
has issued orders to the value of £121,700; and the savings
bank, started on Ist October, 1896, has received in deposits
£74,000. If to these amounts the sums remitted through and


lodged in the various banks, particulars of which are not
available, were added, the totals would be largely increased
Were the necessaries of life cheaper a good deal of this
money transmitted would be kept in the Colony: the bread-
winner would be joined by those dependent on him, with the
result that the money earned in the place would be spent
there. Social conditions of life would in consequence be
greatly improved; inhabitants, who are at present passengers,
would become settlers, and a home feeling established, would
have the effect of creating an interest in the welfare of the
colony, which at present does not, to any great extent
at least, exist.
But the current prohibitive prices for these necessaries pre-
vent this. While the 21b loaf costs Bd.; butchers’ meat, lOd
to Is. per lb; groceries are about 50 per cent dearer than in
Melbourne, Sydney, or Adelaide; and condensed water is 15s.
per 100 gallons, and scarce at that, it is cheaper to keep tin;
family on the other side. High though these prices undoubted-
ly are, they compare favorably with those charged in 1895-9(5.
Here are a few of them :—Flour, 9d.; tea. 2s. (Id.; and horse-
feed, (chaff or oats) fid. per lb.; water, 7d. a gallon; tinned
meats or fruits, Is. (id. per Ib. tin; and general groceries, 100
per cent, higher than at present.
Like most centres on the goldfields, Menzies has its Hos-
pita’, containing 45 beds, and replete with every comfort.
From October, 1895 to March, 1899. about 750 patients have
been treated, at a cost of £6,600. The government provides,
approximately. £2,000, and the public £I,OOO per annum
towards its maintenance. Its death rate for the last year was
the lowest on the fields.
ULARKING DISTRICT
Morgan and party, on Ist October, 1894, registered the
first lease in the Ullaring district.
The total number of leases applied for is 394.
M U LLINE SUB-DISTRICT.
The ‘‘Off Chance” (24 acres) reef, averages 2.] ft., assay
