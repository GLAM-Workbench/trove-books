THE BENT BANQUET.
S'kursday, Siiag TOth, JBSS.
weeks since there was an attack of a most scandalous
character made upon the Hon. Thos. Bent, M.P., in the columns
?of the Daily Age, which seemed to call for notice at the hands of
Mr. Bent?s numerous friends. There were many who urged the honor-
able member for Brighton to commence suit for libel, and he was quite
?disposed to take that course ; but when the matter had been carefully
considered, in view of the law?s delays and traditional
it was determined that no action should be commenced against the
offending paper, unless it could be induced to make an unequivocal
charge against Mr. Bent from which there could be no retreat behind the
subterfuge that the meaning of the journal had been misapprehended.
There were numerous challenges offered to the Age by the more influ-
ential and independent journals published on the goldfields, in the
country districts and elsewhere, but the assailant never attempted to
reply to the arguments and appeals of its country contemporaries, nor
did it dare to put in unmistakable language what had been insinuated
with so much gusto. Under the circumstances, a few of the friends of
Mr. Bent suggested that the public should be invited to express an
opinion upon the merits of the question, by tendering to the well-known
member for Brighton a banquet in one of the most commodious hall*


in the City of Melbourne, by way of testifying their regard and
esteem. To that movement, which was originated without consulting
with Mr. Bent, the Age characteristically replied by an insinuation that
the gentleman whom the newspaper had slandered was about to furnish
a ?cheap feed? to his supporters by way of securing an audience which
would applaud his explanations. It may, perhaps, be worthy of note
at this point that no person has ever heard of the proprietor of the
Age giving a feed, of any kind?cheap or dear?to any of his supporters
but that is a matter well known to all observers. Still it does
seem curious that an Age writer should sneer at the virtue of geneio-
sity, which none of the craft have ever seen exemplified on their paper.
Of course the assertion was an untruth. That goes without saying. The
Age was on. its accustomed beat, and the only consequence of its
malevolent insinuation was a stillmore earnest demand for tickets of admis
sion to the Banquet. The Supper Room of the Town Hall was not large
enough to accommodate the numbers that indicated their intention to
be present, and the removal to the Masonic Hall was made the occasion
for a new departure in slander, by the assertion that the Masonic
- Hall was resorted to because the Town Hall Supper Room was too
large for the small gathering likely to assemble on the 10th of May.
But in spite of the influence of the Melbourne press by its conspiracy
of silence, supplemented by persistent misrepresentations, the Banquet
proved itself one of the most genuine successes ever seen in the City
of Melbourne. The audience was one of the most completely represen-
tative that has ever come together on such an occasion, and with the
exception of those who attended in their professional capacity, such as
the representatives of the press, there was not a man present who had not
paid 255. for his card of admission, or undertaken to do so. The report
which is now submitted was procured from persons whose duty it is to
note the pressure of each word, who have ?nothing extenuatednor set down
aught in malice,? and it will be remembered by all who were present on the
occasion that Mr. Bent never spoke with greater freedom or with better
effect It is due to Mr. Skinner, the well-known Caterer, to say that the
dinner was excellent and the arrangements perfect, such as any assemblage
of hospitable men must needs be proud of. Nearly all the speakers were
called upon on the spur of the moment, but the occasion was full of
generous impulses, and every speech was good. The tone and temper
of the company was all that could be desired, and while, point by point,


the whole of the Age slander was being refuted by successive speakers,
there was unbounded enthusiasm among the hundreds who were gath-
ered in the hall, to express their sympathy with, and to declare their
?confidence in, Mr. Bent. When Mr. Bent rose to respond to the toast
of the evening?his health?several minutes were spent in cheering and
waving of kerchiefs by the whole body of his friends upstanding, before
his voice could be heard; and after he had spoken a similar scene was
witnessed. In spite of the combination of Age and Argus to maintain
the present Ministry in power, the fact begins to be comprehended
that the end is coming, and that Mr. Bent is recognised by a large
?section of the public as an important, reliable, and worthy factor in the
government of this colony. When this pamphlet shall have been for-
gotten by the Age, its slanders will be repeated, although it has not
dared to accept the challenge of Mr. Bent; and for that reason you are
specially requested to carefully preserve this document. The Age dares
not respond with an outspoken statement of its charges for well known
reasons; but it ? hints a fault and hesitates-dislike,? hoping to make it
appear that mere drivelling about trifles, is brave Hectoring in the
?quarrel, where it has already been worsted, if not demolished.

BANQUET
Jkmorcibfe Thomas
A complimentary banquet was tendered at the Masonic Hall,
on. Thursday, 10th May, to the Hon. Thomas Bent, M.L.A., in recog-
nition of his personal merits and public services. The Worshipful the
Mayor of Melbourne, ( Alderman Benjamin ) occupied the chair, and
nearly 200 gentlemen sat down to the tables. Amongst these were the
Hons. C. J. Ham, Dr. Beaney, Dr. Le Fevre, J. H. Connor, C. H. James,
Henry and T. F. Gumming, M.L.C.s ] Sir Bryan 0 Loghlen, Bait. , Dr.
Quick, Messrs. C. Young, C. E. Jones, John Mclntyre, J. Woods, B. J.
Fink, C. Andrews, R. Baker, A. S. Bailes, Edward Murphy, John
Donaghy, R. T. Yale, Jas. Toohey, A. Young, Thos. Langdon, J. W.
Peirce. D. Gaunson, J. H. Graves, John Keys, Dr. L. L. Smith and
Dr. Rose, M.L.A.?s; many leading representatives of the mercantile
and financial communities, and members of the Brighton, Moorabbin
and other suburban councils, as well as visitors from all parts of Vic-
toria and from the neighboring colonies. The repast, which was of
the highest excellence, was served by Mr. H. Skinner.
The toasts of ? The Queen? and ? His Excellency the Governor?
were drunk with enthusiasm.
The Mayor announced that he had received telegrams and let-
ters from a large number of influential gentlemen expressing their re-
gret at not being able to be present, but he would not weary them by


reading the communications in detail. They were anxious to hear the
several speakers and he would therefore call upon Mr. Taylor to
propose the next toast.
Councillor G. W. Taylor (Prahran) proposed the toast of ? The
Parliament of Victoria.? On the present occasion he was there to do
honour to one who was well worthy of their admiration and confidence.
He (Mr. Taylor) knew something of Mr. Bent?s many virtues and
manly acts, and at all times he had found him a real man. (Hear,
hear ) Their guest was a distinguished member of the Legislative As-
sembly, and in the troublous times which followed the doings of 1877
no man did more to restore peace and prosperity. (Cheers.) While
they had such representative Australians as Mr. Bent they had
no reason to fear for the future of this continent. It was Mr. Bent
who, with Sir Bryan O?Loghlen, first hoisted the banner of ? Peace,
Progress, and Prosperity,? which had wrought such great things for this
colony. (Cheers.) Parliament had in the past done a great deal to
develope the country, and it was to be hoped that in the future it would
march with the times. He hoped that the next Parliament would be
more fruitful of practical legislation than the past, and that some steps
would be taken to place the colony in a proper position before the Lon-
don public. Somehow New South Wales got the credit in England
of the exceptional prosperity in Victoria, and something should be done
to alter that. ( Hear, hear.) At present the agent-general?s office was
more like a rabbit warren than the department of a great country like
Victoria. Both Government and Opposition would have a great deal
to do during the coming session; but there was already a good deal of
dissatisfaction abroad, which might lead to great changes. ( ? Hear,
hear,? and cheers.)
The Hon. C. J. Ham responded on behalf of the Council. He
was sure that all classes of the community would be pleased to look back
on the past, and notice how, since the Reform Bill was passed, the two
Houses had worked harmoniously together. ( Cheers.) A comparison
with the systems prevailing in other colonies proved that the basis on
which our Upper House was now formed was the most satisfactory
that could be devised. It was to be hoped not only that important
measures like the Electoral Bill, the Local Government Bill and the
Amending Health Bill, would be dealt with during the coming session.


but also that they would reach the Council in time to be thoroughly
considered before being dealt with. ( Hear, hear.)
Mr. J. Mclntyre replied for the Legislative Assembly, and
?contended that it was the best Assembly in the Australian Colonies.
It had done its work well?(hear, hear)?and, anyhow, it was only
what the people made it. The Parliament of this colony was as yet
very young, and had some faults no doubt; but it would be much bet-
ter if they did not allow the press to thrash them so much. ( ? Hear,
hear,? and laughter.) He had an objection to some of the things
which Parliament did?as, for instance, to fine a man �lO for selling a
tin of sardines after 10 o?clock at night. ( Laughter.) He was glad
to be present there that evening to do honor to his friend Mr.
Pent. (Loud applause.) There were few men who could be called
a better friend than Thomas Bent, and very few men indeed held a more
honourable position than he did. ( Loud and continued applause.)
Sir Bryan O?Loghlen, whose rising was greeted with prolonged
cheers, said ?ln rising to propose the toast of ? Our Guest,? I feel that
I have an easy and pleasant task to perform. I see men of all shades of
political opinion around these tables, who have come to join in showing
their unswerving confidence in the honour and integrity, both as a pri-
vate and public man, of Mr. Thomas Bent. ( Loud and continued ap-
plause.) This gathering has in it nothing of political significance. It
is purely personal, and it is personal for reasons that are known to
?every man present. We all know that slander, most vile and most
barefaced, has been flung abroad on the fair name of our guest. ( ?Hear,
hear? and ?No.?) lam myself cognisant that that slander is utterly
unfounded. (Loud applause.) No man in this world is better ac-
quainted with the identical facts of the case, which occuri?ed more than
five years ago. It occurred when Mr. Bent was Minister of Railways,
in the Government of which I was then acting head. Air. Bent has
been accused?publicly accused?of corruption in his office as Minister
of Railways. I know that that mean charge is utterly unfounded.
( Loud and continued applause.) I can state that within my own
knowledge?my personal knowledge?it is absolutely and entirely
without foundation. (Renewed cheers.) What were the facts of the
case 1 A gentleman who for over thirty years had kept in his possession
certain land, adjacent to two main railway lines, and who had ex-


pressed his intention not to part with it, eventually changed his mind,
and his agent placed it under offer to the Eailway Department. The
desirability from a public standpoint of making that purchase was
pressed upon me in Cabinet by Mr. Bent, backed up by the representa-
tions of the officers of his Department. I declined to purchase it. If
anyone is to blame for not purchasing the land, I, and not Mr. Bent,
am to blame. (Cheers.) I explained that Parliament not being then sit-
ting, the Treasurer had no means at his command, no matter how
desirable in a public point of view the proposed purchase might be. It
was then attempted to purchase a portion of the land, and it was also
attempted to purchase it subject to the ratification of Parliament, but
the offer was only to be met in one way, and that was by purchasing it
altogether, or leaving it alone. I pointed out that the Government
were not land speculators, and that without the ratification of Parlia-
ment we had no power to make such a purchase. A committee of the
Cabinet was appointed, and some of its members are present here to-
night, who inspected the land and brought back a report that it was of the
utmost desirability that it should be purchased for the public. I my-
self afterwards inspected it, and came to precisely the same conclusion,
but when I finally considered the matter, and the purchase was again
pressed upon me by Mr. Bent, I pointed out that I could not purchase
it?that there were no means by which it could be done. Subsequently
a Syndicate purchased the land, and for public objects we purchased a
certain amount of the material. That purchase was made for four dis-
tinct public objects?first, to obtain cheap filling material for the rail-
way ; secondly, to provide cheap filling material to raise by six or
eight feet some 60 acres of Government land lying adjacent to Ken-
sington Hill; thirdly, to provide immediate work for 800 men who
were out of employment, who were taken on at once, and that work
was of a remunerative character, for up to that time that 60 acres was
a useless swamp and a hotbed of typhoid and disease. By that work
the value of the land was increasd by �I,OOO an acre, and the material
for filling up was was got in the only place where it could be obtained,
and at a cheap rate. The fourth reason was that just at that spot
there were two lines of railway converging to a point, and we wished
to remove the whole of the hill, which intercepted the view of both
lines. The hill formed a triangle of some 30 or 40 acres, and as these
two lines were main lines, there was daily increasing danger of a disas-


trous collision there. These were the four public objects which we had?
in view in instantly closing,, and buying a large amount of material,,
which we were enabled to do out of moneys lying in our hands in the-
Railway Department, and by the Lands Department?s agreeing to take
some of the material to raise the land, and recoup the Railway Depart-
ment That was in our power, and so the matter passed away. That
was more than five years ago. With what has happened since that time
you and I have nothing to do. (Hear, hear.) A man?s private transactions
in buying or selling land two or three years after leaving the Gov-
ernment has nothing to do with this question. (Cheers.) And I cam
only say for myself that in that transaction Mr. Bent acted with the
greatest desire to benefit the public, in the most disinterested way,
and acted with the greatest energy. ( Prolonged cheers.) So far from,
his being guilty of corruption in his office as Minister, he did his level
best to carry out what he is blamed for not having done, and for
which, if anyone is to blame, lam to blame. ( Cheers.) It must also
be remembered that at the time the land was offered to the Govern-
ment what was considered the very highest current price was put upon
it ? and though it is true that since that time the land has more than
quadrupled in value, that was not a matter that could be foreseen at
the time, except by the greatest foresight. Gentlemen, I shall say no
more, but simply ask you to join with me in drinking heartily the
health of the guest of the evening, the Honorable Thomas Bent. ( Loud
and prolonged applause.)
The toast was drunk with great enthusiasm, and with musical-
honours, the whole company rising to their feet.
The Mayor called upon the Hon. C. H. James to address
the company before Mr. Bent replied.
Mr. James, who had a cordial reception, said he presumed he
had been called upon to make some remarks, because he knew something
of what Mr. Bent had done in the way of purchasing land as Minister
of Railways. One transaction in particular which Mr. Bent had -om
pleted had proved very beneficial to the Railway Department, and that
was the purchase, much against the wishes of the then Premier ( Sir
Bryan o?Loghlen), of certain land at Northcote. It was a proof of
Mr. Bent?s foresight that this land had since risen in value to such am
extent that the profit would pay for the construction of the Heidelberg;


and Alphington railway from end to end. ( Cheers.) In regard to
the Kensington Hill matter, he knew that Mr. Bent had acted in a
straightforward, honorable manner. (Cheers.) Ko doubt Mr. Bent
subsequently made a large profit out of his share in that land, but no
more than he could have made out of any other land around Melbourne.
It was eighteen years since he first met Mr. Bent, and since then he had
had large business transactions with him, and a more honorable gentle-
man he never met. (Cheers.) He would take his word for anything.
(Cheers.) He was proud to claim Mr. Bent as a friend. (Cheers.)
Mr. Bent ( whose rising was the signal for an outburst of ap-
plause which continued for several minutes) said he had to thank Sir
Bryan o?Loghlen for the chivalrous manner in which the toast of his
health had been proposed, and the way it had been received. In fact,
he could not find words to express what he had intended to say regar-
ding Parliamentary matters. They had all been exceedingly kind to
him, and he was deeply grateful to them all. He had not intended to
refer to the matter which Sir Bryan o?Loghlen had mentioned, but as
that gentleman had spoken of it, he might be allowed to say that al-
though he (Sir Bryan) had taken the whole blame of the Kensington
Hill affair on his own shoulders, from a Constitutional point of view
he was not to blame, and this was proved by the fact that the present
Government had to pass a law taking power to purchase lands and
buildings without reference to Parliament. He was pleased, also, to
find that every one of his old colleagues in the o?Loghlen Government
who were able to be present were there that evening to pay respect to
him, and he also saw near him a face which reminded him of the fact
that one of their number, when he went before his constituents lost his
seat, but, although only a poor man, he immediately resigned his seat
in the Cabinet, and gave up the free railway pass which he held for life
as an Executive Councillor. He referred to Mr. David Gaunson. (Loud
and long continued applause.) But really, the whole demonstration that
evening was a surprise to him,'and he was amazed at what he saw
around him. ~ There were his brother councillors of the Borough of
Brighton and of the Shire of Moorabbin, and he saw also in large num-
bers the market gardeners of Brighton?the men who had worked with
him when he stood for Parliament seventeen years ago, and had stood
by him through evil report and good report ever since. Mr. Bent
referred to his labours on behalf of the market gardeners, and explained


how he had obtained redress for their grievances through Parliament.
But he was not there to tell them what he had done in the past. There
were men there who knew it, and who knew that whatever errors he
? had committed were errors of the head and not of the heart. ( Applause.)
The history of Parliamentary events since he entered public life had
?been a stirring one. Perhaps the greatest event was the terrible Black
Wednesday with all its sinful acts, that had caused sorrow and distress
throughout the land. It was an unconstitutional proceeding, and it
was the hope of every honest man that such scenes would never occur
again. ( Loud cheers.) In politics now, all they wanted was a fair
field and no favor, and with that in this country nothing would beat
us. (Cheers.) Then came the next act. He was at Droraana with
his wife and family, and met Mr. Service and Mr. Kerferd, who were
lamenting that the colony was going to perdition. They had asked
him to start some organisation for a different state of things, and he
returned to town at once, and took up the position as secretary of the
'Opposition, and they fought the elections with the result that Mr. Ser-
vice went into power. Now that time was passed, he could say that
ihe had never received fee or reward, and for all his services he had
never had one cent., except what he had received as a member of Par-
liament or as a Minister of the Crown. The next thing was that over-
tures were made to Sir Bryan o?Loghlen, who carried a motion dis-
placing the Government, and although some people wanted to
throw him over, yet he, with Sir Bryan, formed a party, and with
that motto, ?Peace, Progress and Prosperity to fair Victoria,?
they went on for twenty months, assailed though they were,
and the seeds then sown had grown into a fruitful tree.
(Cheers.) He need not go into the history of the great struggle
that took place, but he could say that whilst the proposals were made
for reforming the Legislative Council by means of the Norwegian
?system or a nominee House, the whole difficulty was settled by one
man, who was present that evening. (Name, name.) He referred to
a gentleman who did not expect to be mentioned, and whose name
would not be given without his consent, He had been ousted from
Parliament, but he hoped the day was not far distant when the
.country would recognise what he had done and would do something
handsome for him. (Loud applause.) Sir Bryan O?Loghlen had for a
tune been ousted from Parliament, more on account of his religious


faith than for political reasons; but he was proud that he had been once
more returned, thanks to Belfast. (Great cheering.) It was needless
for him to refer to the acts of the O?Loghlen Government, but he could
say that it had carried out its policy of bringing peace, progress and
prosperity to the country. ( Cheers.) It wiped off a revenue deficit of
<�600,000, and initiated a Railway Bill, which was characterised
as ?An Octopus ? and one that would ruin the colony, but
which had to be taken up by the next Government. The
present Government claimed credit for a great many things
which were first started by the O?Loghlen Ministry, For in-
stance, they were the first to provide for the new Swan-street cross-
ing at the Richmond station, the new Falls Bridge, the duplication of
the North-eastern line to Seymour, the suburban lines, and the St.
Kilda line; but the present Government took credit for them all. Mr
Deakin did not initiate the irrigation scheme. It was Mr. C. Young
when Minister of Public Works. With regard to his action as Minil
tei Railways, he could say without fear of successful contradiction
that the land he had purchased for the Railway Department would
if sold now realise a profit of �IOO,OOO. (Cheers. ) It was the O?Loghlen
Government who had the honour and credit of appointing Mr. Murray
Smith as agent-general, and that gentleman performed the duties of that
high office with honor to himself and satisfaction to the whole colony.
(Applause) He (Mr. Bent) helped Mr. Service, as Treasurer of the
Coalition Ministry, at his request, to raise Mr. Murray Smith?s salary,
little knowing that the increase was actually to go to Sir Graham Berry.
f ( Groans.) He was told that at the very moment Mr, Service asked his
support for the increase he had Mr. Musray Smith?s resignation in his
pocket. ( Oh. ) Besides all this, the O?Loghlen Government started
various industries, in addition to wiping off the deficiency of that day,
the fact was, notwithstanding all the talk that had been made, the
present Government was merely the tollkeeper who collected the money
as it flowed in. ( Hear, hear, and laughter.) Could anyone say that
the present Government had initiated any new legislation or removed
any taxation to bring about the present prosperity ? (?No.?) Coming
to personal matters, he could honestly say that he had never benefited
to the extent of a single penny in any private transactions whilst
Minister of Railways. (Cheers.) To give them an idea how Govern-
ment land buying was done, and how he had shaped when approaching


the Government in such matters, he would narrate one incident. He
had bought a certain corner in Exhibition Street, and had reason to
expect a good profit. It came to his knowledge that the Government
ought to have that piece of land, and he immediately offered it to the
Cabinet for �13,000, a very moderate price indeed. ( Applause. ) The
offer was declined, and in consequence the land was sold at auction
immediately afterwards, at a gain of several thousand pounds to him-
self over the amount at which he had submitted it to the Govern-
ment. (Great cheering.) As a sample of the manner in which
he acted as Railway Commissioner he might mention that when the Rail-
way Bill of the O?Loghlen Government was framed he held only one
piece of land which could be affected by the new lines, and that was
one half share of 150 acres at Heidelberg. He had been offered �45
an acre for his interest, and the day before it was known to the public
that the Heidelberg line was to be included in the bill, he went to his
partners and offered to sell out at �42 10s. an acre. They knew he
had been previously offered �45, and they could not understand why
he wished to sell. ? Never mind why,? he said; ?will you buy??
Well, they bought him out at �42 10s.; the Railway Bill came out,
and in a few days, as he had fully foreseen, that land was worth �2OO
an acre. That was what he sacrificed because he was Minister of Rail-
ways. (Cheers.) With regard to the article in the Age headed ? The
Kensington Hill Job: A Sequel,? it was written simply to cover the
Chaffey Bros.? business. (Laughter.) They all remembered a conver-
sation he had in a St. Kilda train with the agent for the Chaffey Bros.,
Mr.' Cureton, now a partner and one of the directors of the company,
who said that he did not care for the opposition, because he would make
it all right in the end. The Chaffeys were right. They did not care for
the opposition. They had the Government and the Melbourne press
supporting them. What was the result? The Chaffey Bros, were
getting �250,000 for the company they had floated to work the Mil-
dura run and the irrigation colony. The Ministry stated that the land
was only worth ss. an acre or less, and now, 12 months after the
land was taken up by the Chaffey Bros., and when only a
few pumps had been made by or for them and fixed on the land, they
were to receive �250,000 ?a quarter of a million sterling?
for their concession ! They did not yet know who were the men behind the
Chaffey?s; but it would be known. ( Cheers.) Tue Age knew it had no jus-


tification for having supported the Chaffey Bros.? scheme, and so it had
written the sequel to the Kensington Hill. What could they think of the
position held by the Age, or what value could they place upon its
opinion, when they knew that Deakin, Dow and Pearson may still write
for that journal, and sometimes penned leading articles against hon.
members whilst sitting at the table in the Assembly ? ( Hear, hear.)
In America the slangwhanging of the press had caused a great many
honest and good men to leave Congress, whilst others had declined to
undergo the disgusting ordeal, and therefore would not enter public life.
The Age, on just such lines, made it appear that he was one of the
biggest rogues in creation. ( Ho, no.) The Age made it its boast that
it had tluee writers?Deakin, Dow and Pearson?who could sail as
close as possible to libel., and that if they made a mistake and brought
the paper within the pale of the law, they had three of the leading
barristers of Melbourne?Purves, Madden and Hodges, assisted by
their solicitors, Gillott, Snowden, Croker and Co, ?who could pull them
through any action. ( Laughter.) That was the way the Age worked
it. As soon as he read the article he laughed at it. He was in Balla-
rat at the time, and when he came to town some of his friends said to
him, ? Why don?t you answer this attack V He replied that he had
said what he had to say in Parliament, and that otherwise
his mouth was closed as to the action lie took. It was only now,
when Sir Bryan O?Loghlen had so nobly opened the subject, that he
was able to speak freely. As Sir Bryan had told them, he did all he
could to persuade the Ministry to secure the land, but they would not.
He went to the office of the Railway Department, and he was told
that the curves on the main line converging at the bottom of Kensing-
ton Hill were exceedingly dangerous, and that the Horth Melbourne
swamp was a disease producing fever bed. He knew that by cutting
the top of the hill off and putting the material on the flat they would
have a nicer contour. The Cabinet could not see their way clear to buy
the land, but said that they could buy the material and haveitremoved for
filling purposes. All the business in connection with the affair was done
through the Crown Solicitor and the proper officers of the Government.
As for the Age and its slanderous attack, all he could say to it was
that if it would write an article stripped of all technicalities, saying?
? You, Thomas Bent, in your position as Commissioner of Railways,
refused to buy that land for the Government when you could hav&


done so, but purchased it two years after from a friend, because you
and your relatives and a certain company had a corrupt un ers an ing
in the matter,? he would start a criminal or other prosecution agams e
proprietors of the paper. (Prolonged cheering.) He wou go ur ler
and say that he believed the article was written by a member of the
present Government, and if the Age would give him the name of tha
writer, he would charge him with it straight, and prosecute him.
(Cheers.) He would go into the witness box and face the es awyer
the Age had in its pay. He did not want their money, because he cou
make more money in other directions. Mr.Purves, in speaking theprevious
?H,t at Prahran about anonymous writers in the press, said that he
thoueht it wiser to ignore the attacks of scribblers who were ashamed
to put their names to their letters. (Cheers.) He (Mr. Bent) said the
some. Let the Age give him the name of the writer of that article, and
ho would go at him, no matter who he was. (Cheers.) Three years
after the land was offered to the Government, the so-called syndicate,
that is. the North Melbourne Land Company, was formed. They were
selling the Kensington Hill land by auction, but were not doing with it
what he thought they should have done. He always had a hobby to
fill up the North Melbourne flat to Macaulay-road, and he made an offer
to fill up the land with material obtained from cutting down the lull.
He said in Parliament, in the presence of Mr. Service, that the syndi-
cate was prepared to sell to the Government if it would give the price
paid tor it. with 2J per cent, commission added. That offer was no
accepted. It was true that three years afterwards he, in conjunction
with others, bought the land for �34,000. As soon as he got it he
went to Mr. Speight and said, ? I am told you want this land, and I
will let you have it at a small profit.? Mr. Speight said the land was
necessary and he told Mr. Service so, but the latter refused to buy it.
They held three sales and sold some of the land at �5 per foot, and now
it was worth �25. A short time ago he offered a portion of the land,
amounting to 14 acres, to Mr. Speight, and arranged that Messrs 0. J.
and T. Ham should assess the value. They fixed the price at �24,000,
and although the Railway Commissioners were in favor of purchasing
the land, Mr: Gillies would not submit that offer to Parliament. That
was the whole story of the Kensington Hill job. He never did a
stroke for himself whilst Minister for Railways; therefore it was most
.unfair when a man had really used his best energies, had been true to


his colleagues, and had worked in the interests of the country, that a
journal of the standing of the Age should try and throw dust in the
eyes of the people. (Hear, hear.) It was a shame that they had a press
so wicked and slanderous as to do things so exceedingly detrimental to
men who had only done their public duty. (Load applause.) While in
Opposition he had given the warmest support to Government measures,
which he had thought deserving of assistance, and Ministers
had thanked him for the help so given; yet when Parliament
rose the Ministry accused the Opposition of obstruction. The
Government had been the chief obstruction to business by
bringing forward a number of measures which they had no intention
of proceeding with, as, for instance, the Public Service and Education
Bills. The Licensing Bill which they had passed was a disgrace to the
British name. (Cheers.) Not long ago he was staying one Sunday
in a leading hotel in Ballan with his family, and his daughter being
taken suddenly ill, it was necessary to procure a small quantity of
brandy as a medicine; but the proprietor, who was most kind and
considerate, assured him that he dared not open his bar even for such
a purpose on a Sunday. That fact illustrated the law. There must
be an amendment. Publicans and their supporters were in part
to blame, and it would behove them to think less of procuring rent from
the use of Committee Rooms; but in the public interest it was neces-
sary that the law should be directed to securing good licensed houses
and good liquor for the people who wanted such accommodation.
(Great cheering.) He would do what he could to bring about that
result. (Applause.) Coming now to the Chinese question, he did not
wish to see the Chinese come here in large numbers, but while China had a
friendly treaty with the mother country, and while they had laws to
observe, the administrators of the law and not the Cabinet should take
the matter in hand. The Government ought long since to have taken
legal authority to keep out the Chinese, who came here by thousands,
bringing neither wives nor sisters with them; but they had deferred
action, until a period of popular excitement supplied them with a motive
for going outside the law. (Great cheers.) That was a very dangerous
course for a government to originate. (Hear, hear.) They had treated
the Chinamen almost as badly as they treated Mr. Harper?s sheep,
except that they had not cut their throats. (Cheers.) Certainly he
was for keeping out the Chinamen who competed with our own men


most unfairly and disastrously; but he would keep them out by force
of law, not by such unconstitutional procedure as they had recently
seen. (Great cheering.) They had a glorious country which they wanted
for their own people. Certainly they had good times, but their duties were
twards their own race and people. ( Cheers) The colony at the present
time was passing through a period of unexampled prosperity, and many
people were asking, will it last 1 He was convinced it would last, and
that it must last as long as we had an energetic people, and as long as
confidence in the Legislature was maintained, and all classes of the
community were able to progress together in peace and prosperity. He
had little more to say, though there were many other topics to which lie
might address himself. He could only thank them once more for the
extremely kind way in whiph he had been treated that night. It was
gratifying indeed to have such striking proof that though his name and
fame had been blackened and his actions misrepresented, he had not
lost the confidence and esteem of those who knew him best, and who
were best able to judge of the motives which had actuated him through-
out his career?whether public or private. ( Loud applause.) He
could do no more now than assure them of his heartfelt appreciation
of their kindness, and thank them for the way in which the toast of
his health hdd been honoured, ( Loud and prolonged cheering.)
The toast of ? The Ladies ? was proposed in a humouristic and
effective speech by Mr. D. Gaunson, who took occasion to compli-
mont Mr. Bent upon the manner in which his friends had rallied
round him, when slander had been spattered over him by the Aye. Mr.
Gaunson was proceeding with his remarks when a friend suggested that
the last train would be lost unless speeches were shortened, when that
gentleman, with a merry quip, brought his observations to an end
a'uid much applause. The toast was duly honoured and the Quartette
discoursed appropriate music.
Mr. C. E. Jones proposed the toast of ? The Press.? He was
a living proof that the press was not invincible. (Applause.) It
was possible to fight the press with the press itself. He
asked them to drink ?The Press as it should be; not as it is.?
( Cheers. ) The toast having been duly honoured amid much laughter;
Mr. Jones gave the concluding toast ?The Chairman, His Worship the
Mayor,? who had met their wishes and taken part in the demonstra-


tion in the friendliest possible spirit, and heartily deserve d their thanks.
( Cheers.) The toast was drunk with enthusiasm, and His Worship
the Mayor in acknowledging the honour which had been done him said
that it afforded him a great deal of pleasure to be present on that
occasion to do honour to their esteemed and respected friend Mr. Bent,
whose word any of his fellow-citizens would gladly take in any business
transactions whatsoever.
