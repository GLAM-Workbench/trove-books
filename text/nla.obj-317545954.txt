ANOTHER ISTHMUS IN HISTORY.
E QUINCEY has spoken of the time of the Caesars as
|=| “the isthmus of time, upon which Civil Law and
IsV Christianity were ripened into potent establishments.”
Probably, he merely meant that the period was brief
within which these two remarkable factors in our civilization
were brought into play. But the phrase is suggestive of the
obvious truth that there is no break in continuity, but a
gradual passage from the characteristics of one great era to
the characteristics of another; and if we compare civilization
to the firm land, and barbarism to the surrounding sea, ever
ready and urgent to encroach and overwhelm, we are reminded
how nearly barbarism closed in on and insulated the Medi-
terranean civilization. It was on this isthmus of time, at
this epoch which appeared so unpromising to thoughtful
observers, that Christianity and the Civil Law acquired their
far reaching influence. The death of Christ took place in the
reign of Tiberius Caesar; the great jurists flourished between
1 17 to 235 a.d.; the Roman citizenship, and with it the
Roman law, was extended over the whole Empire in 217 a.d.;
Constantine established Christianity in the year 3 2 4 > an d
Justinian’s Code, Pandects and Institutes were published
about 530. Side by side, the two great systems took shape;
to the one the natives of Europe became indebted for
systematic teaching as to the rights of our neighbour: to the
other, they became indebted for the diffusion of the great
moral idea of love for our neighbour—for teaching as to our
duties to our neighbour even when he has no corresponding
rights. Probably no systems have been so conducive to order
and harmony in human relations, or have done so much in
aid of the solidarity of mankind as these; but who fore-
saw such a result at the time of the Caesars ? Who foresaw, at
least for the first two or three centuries after Christ, the
marvellous developments which were to come from the novel
Jewish heresy? To all thinking minds, there was apparent a


decadence in social life, in government, in art, in morals, in
literature. It was significant of nothing but decay when
Constantine himself, in order to construct his triumphal arch,
had to rob the arch of Trajan; when the Praetorian Guards
put up the Imperial dignity to auction, for the highest bidder;
when for the first time in their history the Romans consented
to narrow their boundaries, in the treaty of the Emperor
Jovian with the Persian King. The religious system under
which Rome had risen to greatness was falling into contempt;
new and abominable forms of worship were imported from
Egypt and the East; the good-humoured, half-sceptical
toleration and concord of the Pagan world were rudely
shattered by the fierce, earnest and aggressive sect of Chris-
tians. The richer classes were sinking deeper in self-indul-
gence and degrading vice; the poorer classes were losing
all self-respect, and in the great cities cried for donations of
bread and for free circus games; the Government grew more
and more feeble and corrupt, the Barbarians, ever hovering
on the frontiers of the Empire, steadily encroached, and the
Emperors had to buy them off; and good men, hopeless and
horrified, held themselves aloof from public affairs, or hid
themselves in the caves and the deserts. Emperors as wise and
far-seeing as the great Trajan, were wholly unconscious of
the greatness of the dead Galilean. Christianity was treated
by them as merely one of a number of religions which were
springing up in the various parts of the Empire, unsettling
the minds of the people; and it was particularly obnoxious,
because (as in the case of the silversmiths at Ephesus) it
disturbed tradesmen in their legitimate callings, and intro-
duced new notions as to the rights and duties of the individual
conscience. This Emperor Trajan gave advice to his pro-
consul Pliny such as would commend itself to a sensible man
of the present day in dealing with such a sect as the Mormons.
Pliny was recommended not to officiously interfere with the
Christians; of course to punish if the crime were proved, but
to readily pardon if an undertaking were given to reform.
Trajan concerned himself far more with what the warlike
Cantabrian was meditating, and the Scythian, and with the
next list for the appointment of aediles and quaestors. As for
Tacitus, he evidently believed the bad stories told of the
Christians. He speaks of them as hated for their infamous
ways; and he deprecates the fiendish persecution of Nero,
merely because the sufferings of the Christians attracted the
sympathy and consideration of the vulgar crowd. Such are
the limitations of human wisdom and foresight, that the great
men had not, nor had the Antonines or the philosophers, any
conception whatever of the forces latent in Christianity, or of


the rich results of the wordy contests of the Sabimans and
the Proculians in the civil law; and they never dreamt of the
character which the succeeding centuries were to take.
It cannot be said that we of this present day are as
unconscious of the critical nature of the epoch through which
we are passing. The idea has been conceived of a science of
historyand lamed men philosophize about the progress
of civilization, and seek to apply to history the principles of
evolution and the known phenomena of organ lo develop-
ment. The ingenious attempt of a distinguished teacher o
Ihis University, the late Dr. Hearn, to explain the growth
of the English Constitution by treating it as an instance of
evolution, las deservedly attracted attention, not only in
Australia, but in Europe and in America. Dr. Hearn did
not I think, attempt to prophesy; but it is interesting to no
by ’ the way, that a successor to Dr. Hearn in his chair,
predicts the euthanasia of the cabinet system, at least in
Victoria, and the growth of local government at the expense
of ?he central government. But looking away from ourselves,
taking the world as a whole, it is remarkable how every
thinker appears to be confident that we are on an isthmus
S ' period of transition. The clever Dr. Max Nordau
opens his curious book called “Degeneration, by oracularly
announcing, “One epoch of history is unmistakeably in its
decline and another is announcing its approach. Mr. He
jamin Kidd, in his “ Social Evolution,” is more definite as to
the nature of the change. He says (p.p. 228-9), The penod
through which we are passing is perceived tc be one o
transition. A definite, long-drawn-out and altogether remark-
able era in the history of our civilization is coming to a close
amongst the more advanced peoples. We are entering on
a new^era. The political enfranchisement of the masses is
well-nigh accomplished; the process which will occupy the
next penod will be that of their Social enfranchisement. The
neople have been at last admitted to equal political right ,
Fn the next stage they must apparently be admitted to equal
social opportunities. When the nature of the transition is
perceived! it becomes clear also that the questions around
whTchThe conflict of social forces must centre in the imme-
diate future, are just those questions the Socmhst movement
has brought into prominence, namely, those a fleeting me
existing rights of capital and the present distribution of
wealth!” Some of the French literateurs and artists have
even deliberately adopted a style which they' ca ‘
nf decadence- because they say art is arrived at that extreme
point of maturity which is produced by those civilizations
which are growing old. These gentlemen seem to think that


the decay of an era of civilization involves a decay in indi-
vidual nervous organizations, and seek to stimulate sated
palates by extravagant and inartistic devices. Of course, a
great deal of the talk about humanity having said its final word
in sculpture with Phidias, in colour with Raphael, in music
with Beethoven, in the drama with Shakespeare, may be
simply owing to our dulness of conception, and our self-
conceit. Pope and Addison thought that their age had made
an advance in poetry beyond all the preceding ages, that
theirs was the golden age of poetry for England, and they
were wrong. This conceit about our own times has even
been treated as a distinct mental malady, and has been neatly
classified and labelled, like any new insect, by a German
professor—you know how readily professors can discover a
new entity and give it a fine name—under the high-sounding
title of “ Akrochronism.” But this malady, if it is a malady,
has recently become so fashionable that it is rather bad form
to be without it. Since I conceived the idea of this essay, I
have found that a thinker so accurate and scrupulous as the
late Sir Fitzjames Stephen regarded us as standing at the
beginning of another stage in the history of the world—a
stage more momentous even than the stage dealt with by
Gibbon in his history; and it comes to me as a confirmation
of my fancy that he sees a strong analogy between our time
and the time when the Roman empire was consolidated.
“The process,” he says, “which has been carried on at a
rapidly progressive rate since the French revolution, of
throwing the whole civilized world into one vast community,
animated by much the same spirit in search of the
same or similar objects, and recognising on the whole
the same moral standard, is much like the process which
moulded all the nations round the Mediterranean into a
single great body, of which Rome was the heart.”
Our time resembles that of the Cassars in particular in
the disintegration of what has long been regarded as the
foundations of Society. “ There is not,” says Matthew Arnold,
“a creed which is not shaken: not an accredited dogma
which is not shown to be questionable; not a received
tradition which does not threaten to dissolve.” This is a
formidable assertion, but it is only too true. Nothing like
the present position of beliefs has been known since the time
which I have referred to as the time of the Casars. Of
course, it by no means follows that the creeds, and dogmas,
and traditions which have been so fiercely attacked, will all
succumb; it does not follow that the sceptical and destructive
spirit will win all along the line. It may well be that the
winnowing fan of criticism will merely remove all husks, and


leave to the world that which there is of true utility and
beauty to answer human needs. But the resemblance
between the two periods in this destructive tendency will be
apparent at a glance. Patriotic and virtuous Romans beheld
with dismay the waning of the old beliefs, the contempt for
the old divinities, the hopeless disorder into which Society,
abandoning and abandoned of the old gods, was falling:
“ Sunt nobis nulla prefecto
Numina : cum coeco rapiantur soecula cursu
Mentimur regnare Jovem ; ”
They shook their heads as they watched the easy and frequent
divorces, the rebellion against the institution of marriage, the
disorganization of family ties, the decline of agriculture, the
depopulation of the country districts, and the unmanageable
aggregation of people in the cities. Do we not hear similar
forebodings in our day; do we not find many of our thinkers
bewailing similar phenomena ? It is no answer to point to
the recently renewed interest in ghost stories, in magic, in
astrology, to the obscurantists and mystics, and the wild
theories as to hypnotism, to spiritualism, to the neo-catholi-
cism of literary and artistic cliques. They had, in the time
of the Cffisars also their neo-Platonists, who cemented an
alliance with the idolaters against the Christians, and regret-
fully saw that
“The f id gods by Christ and mass are killed
“Or driven away.”
They had a Libanius to rejoice in the grateful prospect, under
Julian, of once again seeing altars flaming, victims bleeding,
incense filling the temples, and solemn processions of priests
moving without fear and without danger; they had a Julian
to rehabilitate the discredited mysteries of Eleusis, and to
countenance the black arts of magic. These facts were,
these facts are—it is said—but passing fashions; were sputters
of a dying candle; they do not in any way render doubtful
the main drift of the time. Nor are there wanting signs now
-of intense pressure for facilities of divorce, such as existed at
Rome until Christianity brought in its spiritual sanction to
marriage; and there are signs of rebellion against the whole
institution of marriage. I need hardly remind you that the
flow of population into the cities, with all its attendant
mischiefs, is also as widely deplored now as then, and that
art and literature show signs of decay rather than of healthy
expansion. ,
To pursue the comparison of the epochs further, the
true analogue to the unrest and pressure of the barbarians
is to be found in the movement of the nations in their race
for trade. This is not a merely fanciful comparison. In this


matter of trade, every nation newly developing is a nation
of barbarians to the other nations. Each is pressed onward
in the race for trade by the spectre of the social difficulty at
home, as the barbarians were forced onward into the Roman
empire by other barbarians pressing behind them. What is
the meaning, the object, of the huge armaments of the
European nations ? What is the meaning of the jealousies
about Africa, and of the European settlements on that long-
neglected continent ? What is the meaning of the advance of
Russia in Asia and on the Black Sea, but the desire, the
necessity of its growth and very existence, to get to the sea,
and to find outlets for its products? Why does France
labour for the control of Cochin China and the Peninsula of
Further India, but to tap the trade of the countless millions
of China ? Why does England concern itself with Egypt,
but to protect her trade with India and Australia and the
East ? Why do the nations watch one another like tigers in
the matter of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama, but in
the interests of their trade? What is the cause of the
Venezuelan difficulty, what of the Cuban, but the eagerness
for the trade of the mines and of the great tobacco plantations ?
It is not for vain glory that the nations are all astrain. They
must get money; and to get money they must sell; and to
produce cheaply they must produce on the large sale ; and to
produce on the large scale they must have large markets.
The marvellous increase in production rendered possible by
the labour-saving inventions of the last 100 years is of no use
unless you can sell your products; and you cannot keep your
factories going, with their huge and costly machinery, unless
you have plenty of purchasers. It is found that whenever a
nation obtains an ascendency in any form of industry, there
the level of the workman’s wages will be the highest.' The
pressure of the social question is behind the struggle for
trade, is behind the armaments. All the nations are beino-
- perforce into this fierce competition. Japan,
li.dia must produce and sell—or their people must perish
They are all coming into what Mr Kidd calls “ the rivalry of
life, and, it is asked, what is to become of Eancashire when
I ersia and Japan and India can beat it in the production of
cottons ? The cotton grows near at hand, labour is plentiful
the labourers work for all hours ; relays of labourers can be
easily procured. Hopeful men say that the labourers of
these countries will acquire at the same time the wants of the
European labourers as well as the powers—that there will be
in the East a rise in the standard of comfort, and men will
demand a reasonable life, reasonable food, reasonable
reasonable rest. If each of the nations is like a race of


barbarians, to the other nations, this is especially so with the
empire of our Queen. Until recently, the Queen’s subjects,
had almost a monopoly of the world s trade in manufactured
articles; but now each of the other great nations is contesting
the monopoly. They are encroaching, steadily lessening the
distance between them and their rival, which still leads.
The coast of China, Japan, and Further India seem to be
passing into their hands. T. he Levant has long gone tO‘
Germany. They are strong even in Australia, German
cutlery is being imported into England itself, and is threaten-
ing to deprive Sheffield even of the home trade. Australia is
to fight Denmark for the butter trade with England, and has
to fight the Argentine for the wool trade, and the United
States and Canada for the trade in cereals and other products.
The truth is, a nation must choose between stagnation and
decay on the one side, and competition and development of
its markets on the other.
These circumstances, as well as the increasing facilities
for transport and communication, are tending to assimilate
the people of the world, to reduce them to common ideals,,
common pursuits, common dress, common manners, common
character. Notably, Japan is absorbing all the western ways,
and even (sad to say/discarding its own quaint and artistic
dress and habits. The British people copy the Americans in
buggies, in railway appliances, in steam ploughs, steam
laundries. We find the French Legislature insisting on
seventh day of rest for the workmen in the great exhibition
of 1900 ; and, at the same time, we find the House of Com-
mons passing a resolution in favor of opening the museums
and libraries on Sundays. It is, as Sir Fitzjames Stephen
said “ verv like the process which moulded all the Nations,
round the Mediterranean into one great body, of which Rome
was the heart.” But the moulding now operates over the-
whole world, and tends to make of the nations one great
community having the same standard of life. Assimilation
may be said to be the keynote of the multitudinous sounds of
movement of the times. Every event seems to aid in this
marvellous process. The unexpected and decisive victory of
Japan over China has upset the usual calculations, and is
forcing China to abandon her ancient policy and to come
into line with the rest of the world. The isolation and self-
sufficiency which has marked China for thousands of years
has become impossible. I fancy that Professor Pearson—a
name which this University and this community ought to
regard with grateful remembrance —had he lived till now,
would re-write that part of his interesting book which pre-
dicts the probable conquest of the white races by the yellow.


Then think of the Boers—a community which has been
happily described as a fragment of the 17th century civilisa-
tion which has survived to the igth—what does all the recent
•disturbance in Africa indicate but that this strange people are,
against their will, to break down their ring fence, and to
admit the modern man and the modern spirit ? To me it is
.amazing how frequently we find the same questions discussed
at the same time in widely different and distant nations. In
Switzerland, for instance, they are now discussing a proposal
for a State bank and a proposal for the ownership of Railways
bytheState._ Nor is this process of assimilation confined to
nations. It is operating strongly as between the classes of
•society, and even as between the sexes. Women are pressing
forward into the “ rivalry of life.” They are, step by step,
faking up all the pursuits of men. If it is hard for men to
; get remunerative employment in their callings, it would seem
that it must be harder when women come into the compe-
tition. Women must have votes, must have their wishes
•consulted in legislation and in government. They must have
physical culture on the same lines as men. They must prac-
tice the sports, and even don the clothes of men.
There is one of the foundations, or supposed foundations, of
•society on whicn innovating and disintegrating hands are at
the present time being laid, but which, during the time of the
Caesars, seems to have been accepted without any suggestion
•of change, except indeed, from the side of the Christians
who were often socialistic in their theory and ifi their practice.
I refer to the institution of property, private property. To
.say the least, a very determined attack is being made, in the
most advanced nations, on property in the instruments of
production-property in land (including mines), machinery,
capital, credit, railways, the means of distribution and ex-
change. The people in the time of the Caesars had no
machinery worthy of the name. The instruments of produc-
tion, the means of distribution and exchange, were primitive
and meagre. As for land, the agrarian struggles of Italy
seem to have been over at the time of which I speak. The
repeated stt uggles which took place in the time of the republic
struggles with the view of restricting men of wealth in their
monopoly of such lands as were still nominally public property
of planting yeoman farmers on the soil, of restoring agricul-
tural pursuits, of preventing tillage lands from being Turned
into pasture-land worked by a few slaves—these struggles had
been ended, and the patriotic aims of the Gracchi had been
•suppressed in blood. These agrarian measures do not appear
at any time to have been argued on what we should call
■strictly economical as distinguished from political grounds.


There was no conception of such a science as political
economy; the conception, probably, could not arise except
with the development of a commercial era and the spread of
systematic law. The present attack, indeed, on the institu-
tion of property should, I think, be treated as the application
of the same critical spirit to law as is being applied with such
intensity and persistency to Christianity, the other of the
“ two potent establishments,” as De Quincey calls them.
There are not, indeed, wanting indications, in the time of the
Cajsars, of the commercial era which was approaching. We
find, at all events, a foretaste of some of the bad effects of
such an era. For not only was the imperial dignity treated
as a fit subject for auction, as I have mentioned, but in the
year 376 the firm of Lupicinus and Maximus did a smart bit
of business with the hungry Goths on the banks of the Danube.
They sold to the Goths the vilest food for the highest price,
and produced disease and death to an extent which would
inspire with envy the contractors for the supply of the troops
in the Crimean War, and ought to satisfy the fiendish soul of
Mr. Stead’s Dr. Glogoul. And—if the story is to be believed
George of Cappadocia—whom the great commercial nation
of England afterwards accepted as its patron saint—made a
“big steal” (as the Americans call it) in his contracts to
supply bacon to the Government forces. The original genius
of these men “ heralded the dawn ” (I think that is the
expression) of a new era. But, speaking broadly, I think it
is correct to say that although Lucretius and his teachers
may have anticipated modern men of science in the atomic
theory, there was no Greek or Roman writer who concerned
himself with the theory of rent, or of wages, or of exchanges,
or of foreign trade. Statesmen did not vex themselves with
the problem of finding work and wages for the unemployed.
If the harvest of the country was good, or if the foreign
supplies came in plentifully —and if the barbarians did not
come into the country to eat the corn—there was plenty for
the people of that country to eat: otherwise, there was not.
The ambitious, seeking popularity, would scatter doles of
bread and give gladiatorial sports to the city crowds ; but
there were few, if any, efforts to find remunerative work for
the masses. There was no commercial question, no social
question, in our sense —no difficulty in the relations of labour
and capital. Of this difficulty I shall speak later on.
It is, perhaps, but to present another aspect of the facts
which produce, or indicate, the assimilation of the various
modern peoples, to point out the growing interdependence of
the nations. In connection with this growth of interdepen-
dence, it is significant that the most advanced philosophy is


discarding what used to be regarded as the fundamental dis-
tinction between the ego and the non ego. The “ I,” it is
said, has no fixed limits—it blends with all the other con-
stituents of the universe ; and learned philosophers teach us
that consciousness merely perceives the more closely con-
nected parts. The remarkable utterance of St. Paul, “we
are members one of another,” tends to become almost
literally true. It may be too much to say with certain evolu-
tionists that Society is an organism ; but it certainly seems to
be last becoming an organism. Now, more than ever, we
cannot afford to look with unconcern at what our neighbours
are doing. The fall of stocks in one of the Australian
colonies will affect materially the stocks of the others ; and
an exhibition of financial incapacity on the part of one of the
Governments would have lamentable consequences for all
the group. A shipment of badly frozen meat from Brisbane
would disastrously affect the graziers of Victoria ; and the
various Governments have been driven to combine and make
common regulations on the subject. But looking away from
Australia, what interest have we in South America, or control
over its Governments ? And yet the failure of the people in
the Argentine to pay their loans may involve the withdrawal
or money from Australia, a financial panic, the collapse of
great banks, the ruin of shareholders, and stagnation in
enterprise. The condition of our great staple of wool is
materially affected by the result of the presidential elections
m the United States, and by the duty which Congress sees
fit to impose. The United States again find their financial
position profoundly effected by the attitude which Great
ntam takes in the exercise of its undoubted sovereign rights
in relation to the gold standard in money. When the 'fund
for the relief of the dock labourers in London was started
here, no doubt many subscribed from mere benevolence, and
■especially benevolence towards our kin beyond the seas.
But there was more than that. There was a consciousness
ci -n 6 j sollc i lant y the interests of labourers everywhere,
bkilled workmen, too, have now learnt how their wages and
social condition are affected by the wages and social condition
of workmen everywhere, and especially by the fact that there
are masses of unskilled workers throughout the world always
iving on the verge of starvation. Nor are there wanting
opeml indications of a growing feeling of common interest
on the part of the antagonistic forces of employers and
employed; a tendency, by means of co-operation and other-
wise, to fuse the two classes into one. I may refer in par-
ticular to the highly suggestive Russian system of Artyels—
■combinations of artisans who unite to contract for work and


divide the proceeds; and to the Austrian system of compul-
sory trade guilds, comprising all employers and employed in
each trade, with courts of arbitration and insurance funds.
The ominous feature of this complex interdependence of
interests is that the ill success of one nation is too often a
source of positive advantage to another nation, temporary, if
not permanent. Voltaire is responsible for the saying “un
pays ne pent gagner sans qu'un autre perd; ” and the nations
are acting only too literally in accordance with this theory.
The failure of the wheat harvests elsewhere may be a godsend
to our farmers ; the stoppage of the coal mines at Newcastle
may cause an increased output and vitality in our Victorian
mines: the distrust of African investments may lead to the
development of our gold mines. It is in accordance with this
theory of Voltaire’s that the advanced nations increase their
vast armaments, to back up the polite representations of their
diplomatists, and multiply their maxim guns and torpedoes,
to be used as arguments when all other arguments fail. Such
is the interdependence of the nations, that each country is
deterred by dread of foreign competition from making arrange-
ments for the benefit of its wage-earners. Social reforms in
any community are seriously retarded by the exigencies of
foreign trade and by foreign competition. It was to meet this
difficulty that the Swiss Federal Council proposed the inter-
national regulation of labour, and that a congress was held
on the subject in 1890 at the invitation of the Emperor
William. The Congress had not much practical result, but
it brought into clear relief the fact that any action to be taken
for labour reforms ought to be taken simultaneously through-
out civilised communities.
Here, I may refer to the exceedingly complex nature of
modern problems as compared with the problems of the time
of the Caesars. To a Roman, there was but one sovereign
power within the bounds of civilization. He looked for the
consolidation of the great Roman dominions, if not the
extension —for Augustus in his will had strongly advised his
successor not to attempt to extend the empire beyond the
desert of Africa, the Rhine and Danube, the Spanish Penin-
sula, and the Euphrates. The Roman statesman aimed at
checking and conquering the barbarians, and busied himself
with the rivalry of pretenders for the Imperial dignity and
claimants for the great offices. We have to take into our
calculations several powerful empires, many independent
states, and a much larger world. We are distracted, as well
as aided, by sciences of which the Roman never conceived.
“ Regions Caesar never knew ” feel, in a few hours, every
beat of the pulse of the world. Here in Australia we have


served up to us every morning an account, more or less vera-
cious, of the movements of every nation under the sun. Nothing
is more apparent than the lack of lucidity, the want of grasp
and breadth on the part of public men and Parliamentary
leaders everywhere ; but what else is to be expected when there
are so many events, so many forces, so many factors to take into
account ? What a tremendous task a ruling man has to face
now-a-days, whether he be a British premier, an American
president, or a German monarch—that is to say, if he is to
tide over the passing year with reasonable success ! It is
quite in accordance with the spirit of the times to find a
leader of the House of Commons write a treatise on the
foundations of belief; to find a Gladstone beguiling his leisure
hours with the claims of the papacy or with the parable
of the swine; to find a cardinal of the Roman Catholic
Church throwing himself into the labour movement; to find
President Cleveland making a study of bimetallism like a
University professor. Even in our Australian politics, it is
amazing what industry is necessary for a premier who is to
guide the public affairs and Parliament with even tolerable
success. He has to make up his mind, in one way or another,
on most difficult theories, and to do something for every
emergency of State. He has to try to take with him houses
of Parliament which contain most discordant elements, and
men of all stages of thought and training, on a hundred
different subjects. Even to be a well-informed man in these
times involves continuous watchfulness and application. One
has to know the last and best thing said on scores of subjects.
Except in the case of those who rigidly confine themselves to
some special science, this is not an age of specialists, or of
original and surpassing excellence in attainments in any
particular line of human energy. I cannot help thinking, in
this connexion, of the words put by Browning into the mouth
of his remarkable creation Cleon—the Greek man who has
mastered all the arts, but who is not so great in any one art
as his predecessors :
“ We of these latter days, with greater minds
Than our fore-runners, since more composite,
Look not so great beside their simple way,
To a judge who only sees one way at once,
One mind-point, and no other at a time —
Compares the small part of a man of us
With some whole man of the heroic age,
Great in his way, not ours, nor meant for ours;
And ours is greater, had we skill to know.
Now mark me ! these divine men of old time,
Have reached, thou sayest well, each at one point,


The outside verge that rounds our faculty :
And where they reached, who can do more than reach ?
I have not chanted verse like Homer, no— '
Nor swept string like Terpander, no—nor carved
And painted men like Phidias and his friend.
I am not great as they are, point by point,
But I have entered into sympathy
With these (our, running these into one soul,
Who, separate ignored each other’s art,
Say, is it nothing that I know them all ?”
Probably, if Cleon had a London or Melbourne daily news-
paper served up to him every morning with his light refection,,
well —he would not even have been Cleon. He would have
felt, as many in these days feel, his helplessness, his inability
to fulfil all the duties which crowd upon him, the painful'
necessity of making up his mind promptly and firmly on
numerous questions which, to appreciate thoroughly, would
require a life of labour and investigation. He would, from
the depths of his artistic soul, have cried out, “Take this
thing from me—take from me these superficial views of the
immense and increasing activities of a toilsome and feverishly
restless world —take from me the incessant strain which this
sheet of printing puts upon all my faculties, all my emotions
take from me these accounts of crime and markets, of
missionary meetings and wars, ot trade, and theatres, and
divorce and sport —take away these last tortures of matri-
monial advertisements and memorial rhymes —and leave me
at peace among my
“ Sprinkled isles,
Lily on lily that o'erlace the sea.
And laugh their pride when the light wave lisps Greece !”
The complexity of problems to which I have referred not
only add enormously to the difficulties of statesmanship, but
(what is probably more important) to the difficulties of plain
people in trying to lead a sane, healthy, useful existence.
How many are found to be suffering from
“This strange disease of modern life,
With its sick hurry, its divided aims,
Its head o’er taxed, its palsied heart.”
There are indications that mankind has not yet nearly
digested and assimilated the marvellous discoveries and
inventions of recent times. These have come crowding so-
rapidly that humanity is dazed and bewildered, is prepared
to listen to anything novel, startling and ridiculous. Like a
sudden accession of a large quantity of new furniture to a
house, these discoveries have not yet found their proper and
orderly places in the true utilities of life. It may be true, as
we are taught, that there is no valid ground for concluding


that the world as it is to be will be better than the world
which has been. But science has added such new resources,
new new knowledge, to mankind, that it seems
reasonable to suppose that mankind will turn these gifts
ultimately to its true advantage. Is there not some true
human use to be gained from the facilities for locomotion
beyond commercial gain or idle change? Are the facilities
for communication, the post, the telegraph, the telephone,
the phonograph, are the wonderful inventions of Edison and
Rontgen and others not eventually to bring in their train
greater riches in ideas, greater nobility in character? Are
the discoveries in electricity, for instance, not to work an
amelioration in the lot of the masses ? It is said that elec-
tricity may supersede the necessity for coal, and the factory
system which coal involves, and the aggregation of huge
populations in cities with crowded terraces and diminutive
rooms ? We are, at least, free to hope on these subjects.
This privilege of hope is that which the fates, in their
unkindest mood, have never taken from mankind.
As a young and vigorous plant springs from and is
nourished by the decay of an older plant, so did Christianity
and the civil law take shape in the decay of the Mediter-
ranean civilization. What is to be the character of the most
striking development in the coming era ? Inventions, they
say, come when they are most wanted, because, the want
being more keenly felt, many minds are busy devising how to
meet that want. We have no justification for expecting a
new incarnation, a new Avatar; mankind will have to do the
best that it can with the materials that it has, with the
powers and resources that it possesses. Now, looking closely
at the whirling vortex of problems, listening for the pre-
dominant note in the present babel of cries, what is the chief
problem ? I mean, the problem which attracts most people,
and in all civilized countries, and without any cessation.
Beyond all question, the problem of problems is the social
problem. Ido not mean the socialist problem, the problem of
socialism—socialism being a name which covers a great variety
of expedients, conflicting in detail, though similar in general
character, for the solution of the social problem. Until the
astounding anomaly is removed of a state of society in which
the primary wants of all men, the sick and infirm as well as
the able-bodied, the want of food, shelter, clothing, and a
reasonable existence, can be supplied over and over again
with less labour than ever before, and nevertheless millions
and millions of people, able and willing to work, find it
impossible, or at least very difficult, without intense strain,
to supply those wants, there never will be peace or anything


like peace. People who talk of the wage fund, of the nature
of the struggle for existence, and the survival of the fittest,
and the inexorable law of demand and supply, do not touch
more than the fringe of the subject. Let us for a moment
put out of our minds that there is any such thing as money,
being merely a means to an end. Take the indisputable fact
that at present —whatever may be the case should the human
race become too numerous—the land and the machinery of
the world can produce ten, twenty, a hundred times as much
of the requisites for food and clothing and shelter as mankind
could find necessary ; remember that commodities can, with
the modern systems of locomotion, be rapidly moved over
great distances ; remember, as one of the glories of mankind,
that those able and willing to work are quite willing to pro-
vide for the sick and infirm as well as for themselves. Men
are different in this respect from the brute forces of nature,
different even from other animals. Other animals are com-
monly cruel to the weak of their species : savage races often
abandon the aged or sick of their tribes. But the more
civilized a race is, the more it wards off the cruelty of nature
towards the weakly members. As Matthew Arnold says
“ Know, man hath all that nature hath, but more,
And in that more lie all his hopes of good :
Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood ;
Nature is stubborn, man would fain adore.”
Why, under such circumstances, need there be starvation or
abject want at all ? Why should there be millions shivering
in rags, under the “ sad changes of the imperfect year,” or
housed in filthy tenement rooms, who are able and willing to
work ? People do not now, as in the other isthmus of history
to which I have referred, cry for panem et circenses as a gift.
They cry for work, and for a fair share of the good things of
life as a reward of reasonable work. You will note that lam
not putting out any theory, or making any suggestion. I
merely wish to state the problem to be faced as it presents
itself to my mind. I think it is Heine who said that this
contest for a fair share of what the earth gives is the outcome
of a sense on the part of humanity of the failure of its ideals.
Others say that the growth of scepticism as to a future state
inclines men to this contest for a satisfaction of primary
wants in the present state. But the matter which concerns
me this evening is the fact of the urgency of this problem,
not the causes of the urgency. What a sign of the times it is
to find the most earnest religious teachers devoting their best
energies to this problem as if they could not get away from
it ? Apparently, the reasoning is that there is no use in
putting a higher life before men until they can live. There


can be no spiritual existence unless physical existence is
supported. Before you can make human beings good, they
must be—human beings. You know of the efforts of the
leader of the Salvation Army, Mr Booth, and you know of his
book “In Darkest England.” It has touched me as irresis-
tibly comical, as well as pathetic and interesting, to read the
other day the words of a letter of a Protestant missionary
sent to the so-called heathens of Japan. He writes as fol-
lows : —“ The people deny the existence of a God of goodness
because they are away on the starvation line. I thank the
Lord that even now in Nankin there are single taxers to
teach the missionaries and the Chinese the folly of letting the
landlords stand between God and his gracious gifts to his
children, and levy toll.” How different this language is from
that which was used by such missionaries as Carey and his
companions in India, satirized by Sydney Smith ! You find
this problem in sermons—in novels - in learned treatises -in
reviews and newspapers, everywhere. Some ministers of
religion would treat social usefulness as the test of religious
usefulness ; and it would seem as if extreme individualism in
religion were losing in public favour at the same time as
extreme individualism in economics and philosophy. Ben
Tillett, one of the labour leaders in England, draws Christ
into his social politics, calls the men on strike to give three
cheers for the Man of Nazareth ; and the cheers are given.
But perhaps there is nothing in recent history so striking or
significant as the Pope’s encyclical of 1891. If a lofty silence
could have been expected of any man on such a subject, most
of all could it have been expected of the Pope, in his seclu-
sion at the Vatican, The world to which he would direct
men’s eyes is a future world ; poverty and suffering here are
of small account, and may work for the sufferer joy and glory
hereafter. But in place of telling the masses that whatever
they suffer is of God’s will, and that they should submit
patiently, he enters into an elaborate discussion of the social
question, and the means of dealing with it. He warns against
the spirit of revolutionary change which has passed into
economics.
“ The elements (he says) of a conflict are unmistakeable;
the growth of industry and the surprising discoveries of
science; the changed relations of master and workmen, the
enormous fortunes of individuals and the poverty of the
masses; the increased self-reliance and the closer mutual
combination of the working population; and finally a general
moral deterioration. The momentous seriousness of the
present state of things just now fills every mind with painful
apprehension; wise men discuss it; practical men propose


schemes ; popular meetings, legislatures, and sovereign
princes—all are occupied with it; and there is nothing which has
a deeper hold on public attention There can be no
question whatever that some remedy must be found, and quickly found r
for the misery and wretchedness which press so heavily on the large
majority of the very poor.” His Holiness then argues on the
lines of many economists—that any confiscation of private
property would injure the wage earners, depriving them of
the hope of bettering their condition in life. He points out
that it is man’s grand distinction over animals to need and
to have things “in stable and permanent possession,” and
this is the justification for ownership of land. Except by the
ownership of private property, he says, it is impossible for
a father to do his duty of providing for his children. No
practical solution can be attained without the aid of the
Church, We must accept inequality of fortune as necessary.
It is ordained by nature “ that rich and poor should live in
harmony.” The employer should give fair wages for fair
day’s work; the rich should (after providing for his own
wants) employ his riches for the benefit of others; and the
poor are advised to practise the virtue of resignation. To
cure Society, which (as he says) is perishing, it is necessary
to go back to the Christian life and Christian institutions.
The Church strives to better the earthly condition of the
poor; but it is the duty of rulers to “ make sure that the laws and
institutions .... shall be such as to produce of themselves
public well-being and private prosperity.” Those who provide for
the comfort and the welfare of the working classes should
see that they are housed, clothed, and enabled to support life.
He points out the limits of state interference; wage earners
should be specially cared for; and lawful owners should be
safely guarded from spoilation. Its laws should remove the
causes of strikes. Workmen should have sufficient leisure
and reasonable hours of labor. There should be freedom in
agreements between employers and employed, but the re-
muneration must be sufficient “ to support the wage-earner
in reasonable and frugal comfort.” The policy should be to
increase the number of owners of property. No tax should be
excessive. Trade Unions should multiply and become more
effective. “At this moment,” he says, “ the condition of the
working classes is the question of the hour.” Passing by in
this encyclical what men of affairs would call the platitudes
natural to a cloistered mind, which is more in contact with
books than with concrete verities of life and the complexities
of the position which responsible statesmen have to face.
I desire to draw your attention (i) to the assumption which
underlies this encyclical, that a State can, if it adopt the


right means, and without the distribution of doles, alter the
economic condition of the poor; and (2) to the difference
between the tone of ths exhortation and the tone of Christian
teaching in that other isthmus of time to which I have re-
ferred. Is this homage of the Pope to the State to be taken
as the topsy-turvy modern version of the visit to Canossa ?
I do not say that the teaching in the two periods is in-
consistent : I say that the teaching of the one period is not
on the same plane as the teaching of the other period: they
cannot meet, and do not collide. St. Clement of Rome said,
“ Let the rich minister unto the poor; and let the poor give
thanks to God, because He has given him one through whom
his wants may be supplied.” But one can hardly conceive
of St. Clement saying that some remedy must be found—that
is, I suppose, found by the State—and quickly found for the
wretchedness which presses so heavily on the very poor; or
going into an economic argument as to the justification for
private property; or laying it down that laws and institutions
should be such as to produce of themselves public well-being
or private prosperity; or dwelling on the limits of State
interference. His Holiness speaks with no uncertain sound
in favor of private property. This is man’s grand distinction
from other animals. Of course, there is another view to which
St. Ambrose lends some countenance when he says, “ Nature
has made all things common for the use of all
Nature made common right, usurpation made private right.”
This view has been put so suggestively and eloquently by
Coleridge in his version of Schiller's Wallenstein, that I may
be pardoned for quoting it here:
“ All that the powers divine
Send from above, are universal blessings :
Their light rejoices us, their air refreshes,
Ru’’ never yet was man enriched by them :
In their eternal realm no property
Is to be struggled for —all things are general:
The jewel, the all-valued gold we win
From the deceiving Powers, depraved in nature,
That dwell beneath the day and blessed sunlight,
Not without sacrifices are they rendered
Propitious, and there lives no soul on earth
That e'er retired unsullied from their service.”
It is, by the way, remarkable that in such an address the
Pope in no way refers to the mode in which rich men so
commonly make use of their money, by lending it and taking
interest; and yet, as Bossuet says, it has been the unvarying
tradition of church councils, of the Popes, of the fathers, to
interpret the phrase “ mutuum date nihil inie spevantes" as pro


hibiting the taking of interest; and I understand that the
prohibition is to be found in the corpus juris canonici.
But I should be particularly curious to know whether
Pope Leo XIII. would join with St. Chrysostom in con-
demning the whole class of middlemen, of distributors m
trade ? St. Chrysostom says, “He who procures an article to
make profit by disposing of it entire and unaltered is ejected
from the temple of God.” Now, I want to refer to the peculiar
phenomena which the great class of distributors at
this time. I shall not speak of the efforts of co-operative
societies consciously attacking the class of distributors. I
want to call your attention to a revolution which is taking
place under our very eyes, not by pre-arrangement or of set
purpose, but by the pressure of circumstances—a revolution,
not by bloodshed, although it is being accomplished with
much pain to the persons engaged in the function of distribu-
tion—a revolution which does not attract half as much notice
as a thousand other changes of infinitely less importance, and
which yet will involve a recasting of the theories of the
political economists. In no other department of industry is
the strain of competition so intense, and yet the competition
is working its own destruction ; it is falling by its own weight.
Statistics show that in civilized countries the proportion of
persons engaged in the work of distribution is steadily
increasing. There are more shopkeepers, shop assistants,
commercial travellers, than ever before. Distributors are the
principal advertisers, the principal agents in the competitive
warfare. Nothing like such aggressive advertising has been
known in any age. Our eyes are allowed no rest. Adver-
tisements are thrust into our hands, under our doors, fill the
newspapers, and turn up in seductive paragraphs of apparent
news. We look beside us on the walls, and see the arts ot
the advertiser ; we look down on the footpath, and there they
are again : we rush to the rocky landscape, and find a sermon
in stones teaching us that we ought to buy this man’s soap or
that man’s whisky. Even if we turn for relief to the blue
sky, and the unappropriated grandeur of the clouds, we find
at least I have seen in American cities—our vision inter-
cepted by great wire-framed advertisements placed above
the streets. But the distributing trades go to the strongest.
They are becoming more and more centralized in a few hands.
You see it in the growth of huge emporiums such as
Whiteley’s, such as the Bon Marche, such as institutions
nearer home which 1 shall not name lest you should treat this
essay as an elaborate advertisement also. A week or two ago
you found the grocers complaining that they were being
forced out of the trade, in Melbourne suburbs, by two or


three firms which have establishments everywhere. It is an
established fact that the greater proportion of retail dealers
fail to meet their engagements. You see in the system of
“ tied houses ” how retail dealers in beer and spirits are
becoming mere servants of the brewers and distillers. The
drapery establishments are practically shops where great
wholesale houses sell their goods retail by their dependents.
The dependents may think, the public may think, that the
business belongs to the man whose name is over the door.
It is nothing of the kind. He is merely permitted to have
the barren honour of calling the business his, so long as
some big house, or houses, choose to let him. He takes the
responsibilities, and makes the contracts ; big houses take
the cash. You see the same process in the “rings ” for the
control of particular commodities, in the “ corners ” by which
great operators produce fluctuations in price. You see it in
the great sheep and cattle stations of Australia ; for these are
really owned and worked by great financial institutions,
whose existence depends on their success. I understand that
no small bookseller can stand without the consent of the big
bookseller ; but I had better stop, lest I should fail in accuracy
of statement as to some particular fact, and thereby seem to
weaken the case which lam putting before you. This pro-
cess, which has been carried so far in the case of retail
traders, is also being applied, though not to the same extent,
to wholesale traders. And as for producers, it is evident that
their independence is being gradually sapped. They have to
lean more and more on the State, or some central authority,
for the development of new markets and for the keeping of
existing markets. No industry, no foresight, no economy, is
now sufficient to prevent disaster. Producers have no con-
trol over the principal causes of disaster, such as financial
crises, the change of fashion, new inventions, fluctuations of
demand. Fluctuations of demand are deliberately produced
by great operators, for their personal profit ; and there is
nothing so productive of harm to trade and nothing which
tends so much to throw men out of employment. It has to
be borne in mind that the talk about supply and demand
regulating prices involves a good deal of cant in these days,
when men have discovered the knack of consciously creating
or restricting the demand—when, as I may say, the conscious
element has entered into values. It is not the mere “ higgling
of the market” which the prudent man has to look to; he has
to take into account, if he can find out, what the rings and
trusts and big operators are doing. The artificial character
of market prices is obvious in the case of shares ; but it is to
be discovered easily in the case of nearly all commodities.

Another Isthmus in History.


Many a calamitous strike or lock-out is to be traced to the
operations of great speculators, sometimes to their manoeuvres'
consciously directed to that end.
But I have said enough to indicate the nature of the
change which is taking place, and which is to take place, in
our industrial condition. No doubt, you could supply other
facts tending in the same direction. I have no intention of
attempting the role of prophet, still less the role of pro-
pounding a new system which will put an end to industrial
troubles, I am neither in an imperative mood nor in the
future tense. I do not think that this is the time and the
place for inflicting on you either prophecy or advice, even if I
thought that I could do so to any purpose. But it is well
known that the tendency of all industries to centralization, and
to monopoly, and the way in which competition is worked to
abolish competition, and the necessity of such frequent
interference on the part of the State to aid its subjects in
their industries, as well as the terrible pain and waste of
human life and energy under the established system, have led
many to apply their minds to schemes for making the State,
or some central authority, the monopolist. The State, it is
said, when it is controlled by the people, can successfully
direct and employ the people in their industries, and meet
the general demand for a reasonable existence, for a life freed
at least from a sordid care for the essential of physical
existence, freed from irregularity in work and insufficient
wages, and capable of the pursuit of noble ideals. It was not
a modern socialist, but the great Montesquien, who said— 150
years ago—in his Esprit des lois;
“ Whatever alms may be given to a man who is naked in
the streets, this will not fulfil the obligations of the State,
which owes to all its citizens an assured subsistence, food,
and proper clothing, and a mode of life which is not contrary
to health,” and he insisted that the State ought to give work
to those who are capable of it, and teach those who need to
be taught how to work. But even men who are most deeply
impressed with the cruelty and waste of the present system
not unnaturally look askance at proposals to make all the
people public servants, and to throw upon a fallible
sovereign, or a fallible group of ministers—here to-day and
away to-morrow —the novel task of conducting or supervising
all the industries of a country. Yet even a writer so
reactionary as Mr Lecky—in a late book which echoes the
incoherent grumbling of idlers at a West End club, rather
than represents any statesmanlike breadth, or philosophical
crasp, such as one would have expected from the historian
of the 18th century—even this Mr. Lecky admits, that the


supply of gas and water by municipalities has been a success
—has been managed with honesty, efficiency and economy.
He also approves of a State post and State telegraph system,
and (in some places) of State railways. As regards other
industries, there is apparent a growing need for, to say the
least, a vigilant watch and a strong controlling hand in the
interests of the community; but great care has to be taken
not to hinder the free play and flexibility of the forces which
have tended so much hitherto to progress and improvement,
under the system of unrestrained competition.
All these things point to a condition of most unstable
equilibrium, a condition which cannot last. We are
obviously entering upon a most difficult and critical period,
a period in which elements of disorder and discontent
threaten to overwhelm what is good as well as what is evil
in our civilization, a period in which, to revert to the simile
with which I started, the firm land seems to narrow and
dwindle away, but in which—as in that other isthmus of
history to which I have referred—there may be evolved for
humanity, probably after much pain and strife, a system
adapted to its growing requirements. The two factors which
in that other period came into play, settled law as to in-
dividual rights, and that kind consideration for our neighbour,
which is so intimately associated with Christianity, have
never yet been satisfactorily fused and amalgamated. It is
difficult to reconcile the legitimate wants of the many with
the legitimate rights of the few. As I have already said, we
have no right to look for any new avatar, or any new re-
velation. We must do the best that we can with the re-
sources which are at our hand. To me it seems certain that
the social question can never be solved by any one nation,
without regard to the others; and it seems probable that it
will not be solved on the lines of any one definite, pre-con-
•ceived, cut and dried theory. If it is to be solved at all, it will
be solved by the inexorable logic of circumstances, by gradual
approximation; just as the changes in the distributing and
other trades are being effected without any pre-determined
policy. The part which conscious, directed effort plays is
very small as compared with the part which is played by the
mere pressure of facts unconsciously applied.
“ Seeing this vale, this earth, whereon we dream,
Is on all sides o’er shadowed by the high
Uno’erleaped mountains of necessity,
Sparing us narrower margins than we deem.
It is not in human power to stop the main current of the
flood; but it may be in human power to deflect and guide
the course of the torrent, and to conduct the waters in
fertilizing channels, instead of allowing them to sweep in reck


less devastation. So far as conscious efforts of men are con-
cerned, whether in legislation or otherwise, there is much of
the pang of transition to be avoided by courage, by the frank
facing of facts, by careful attention to details and to the
lessons of experience. Man has gained, man will gain, by his
experience; and most of all by his mistakes. The most
dangerous attitude—the attitude which will be productive of
the most pain and disorder—is that which is too common
among the well-to-do classes—the attitude of “ we don’t want
to be bothered.” It is too natural for these classes to object
to change, to leave well alone —what is well for themselves.
In this class—amongst those who do not trouble themselves
about the difficulties of the times —the most densely ignorant
are to be found. But they cannot afford to close their eyes
to the altered conditions around them, or deny their active
sympathy to the strenuous efforts which are being made to
remove the hideous sores of our civilization. It is only too
true that ignorant opposition to change is quite as much to
be dreaded as ignorant agitation for change: morosa morum
retentio res turbulenta est ceque ac novitas. Much can yet be
done by liberalising institutions, by giving a fair hearing to
all theories, by applying wholesome criticism, by getting
theorists to face the responsibility of actual legislation and
government, by gaining a clear apprehension of, and holding
with a tenacious grip, that which our civilization has of solid
good, by bringing severed classes together and making them
appreciate one another’s difficulties. In the general dis-
location of industries, in the conflicts of employers and
employed, in the bitter rivalry of nations, in the difficulties of
obtaining remunerative work, in the complicated interplay of
interests, much distress can be avoided by the exercise of the
modest virtues of patience and caution, combined with a
sympathetic regard for, and attention to, the reasonable wants
of others. In that other isthmus, humanity acquired a new
ideal, which sufficed it for many generations. Perhaps, with
the aid of science, humanity is to reach a new plane of
•certitude, is to gain a new fixity of ideal, under which human
society shall attain a higher level than has hitherto been
known. If humanity is, in the main, at heart healthy, it will
cast aside from it eventually, like any healthy organism,
all such conventions and systems as have become useless or
hurtful; and those with words of goodwill will be read with
the illumination of a new light, those words which I fancy
Cromwell’s great secretary, Milton, may have had a hand in
framing:—“ And what are all our histories and other
traditions of nations in former times, but God manifesting
himself that he hath shaken and tumbled down, and trampled
upon everything that He hath not planted.”
