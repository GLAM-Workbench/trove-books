CHAPTER I.
A traveller in the Indian Archipelago soon perceives that there
is an essential difference in the structure of the various islands. Some
are only moderately elevated, with the land sloping gently towards
the shore, and regular soundings far out to sea; others again rise
abruptly from an unfathomable depth, and contain lofty mountains,
some of which are active volcanoes; while a third class, comprising
some of the larger islands, as Sumatra and Borneo, are of a mixed
character, partaking in part of the peculiarities of both the others,
the limits, however, of the two formations being very distinctly defined.
The object of this paper is to point out an arrangement which will
present at one view the character of the different islands. This
arrangement has suggested itself to me during a personal acquaintance
with the Indian Archipelago extending over a period of several years;
and I feel that, had it previously existed, it would have very materially
assisted me in pursuing the inquiries I have lately had occasion to
make in that part of the world.
The contrast which the volcanic islands of the Archipelago afford,
when compared with the continent of Australia, is very strikingly
presented to the view of a voyager from Port Essington, crossing for the
b 2


first time the sea that separates the continents of Asia and Australia.
Even before he has lost soundings on the great bank which extends
from the northern shores of the latter continent, the lofty mountains
of Timor rise up before him. As he nears the land, the colour of the
water suddenly changes from green to a deep blue; he has now
passed the steep edge of the bank, and is floating on the unfathom-
able seas which bound the volcanic islands of the Archipelago. On
closer examination, he finds that the laud of Timor rises abruptly
from the depths of the ocean ; so much so, that from many of the
precipices which overhang the sea, a line of great length will not
reach the bottom, while the very few spots on which anchorage is to be
found are so close to the shore as to be available only when the wind
blows from the land; and, to complete the contrast, if the weather is
clear, he perceives that one of the mountains near the east end of
Timor is an active volcano.* The chain of islands which extends
from Java to Timor is of the same character: lofty volcanic peaks,
some m a state of activity; while the islands are separated from each
other by narrow channels of unfathomable depth, through which the
current fiom the Pacific, caused by the prevalence of easterly winds,
rushes with great force; but on passing these, the voyager again
perceives a change in the colour of the sea from deep blue to green,
and on sounding, he finds a bottom of stiff clayey mud, resembling
exactly that of the bank which fronts the northern coasts of Australia.
He is now on the great bank which extends from the south-eastern
extremity of Asia far into the seas of the Indian Archipelago. The
islands now lose their volcanic character; and on arriving at Singa-
pore, near the extremity of the Malay Peninsula, the general resem-
blance of the country to that in the neighbourhood of Port Essington
is sufficient to strike the most careless observer. The land low and
undulating; the shore with red cliffs alternating with sandy beaches;
even the rocks of the red iron-stone, known to Indian geologists by
the name of laterite, are perfectly in character with the country of
the Coburg Peninsula, and even on closer examination little differ-
ence can be discovered except in the vegetation.
These banks of soundings which extend from the continents of
Asia and Australia, form very remarkable features in the geography
of this part of the world, and, as such, are deserving of more attention
than has hitherto been bestowed upon them, since it will be found
that all the countries lying upon these banks partake of the cha-
racter of the continents to which they are attached; while those
* Vide post, p. 30.


which are situated on the deep sea that separates them are all of
comparatively recent volcanic formation, with the exception of a few
small coral islands, which, in all probability, are constructed upon the
summits of submerged volcanoes.* The depth of water on these
banks averages about thirty fathoms, deepening rapidly as the edge
is approached, and shoaling gradually towards the land. It will be
seen that the one I have termed the Great Asiatic Bank extends into
the Archipelago from the south-eastern extreme of Asia to a distance
of nearly one thousand miles, in fact, to within fifty miles of Celebes,
and I strongly suspect that it will be found to extend to the south-
western extremity of that island also; but as there is a space of
nearly thirty miles across which no soundings have been carried,
I have preferred reducing the bank to the limits for which we have
actual data.
Countries lying on the Great Asiatic Bank. ?The similarity that exists
in the direction of the mountain ranges in the south-eastern part of
Asia has often been the subject of remark. These invariably run in a
direction nearly north-north-west and south-south-east, and are all of
the primary formation. The chain which extends along the Malay
Peninsula is the most conspicuous of these ranges, and is continued
at intervals to Banca and Billiton, and perhaps may be traced as far
as the north coast of Java. It is this range that most abounds in
metals, or, at all events, in which mining operations are pursued with
greatest success, probably from the strata, owing to its central posi-
tion, having been little disturbed by the convulsions which have
shaken the countries on either hand. The productiveness of the
gold mines of the Malay Peninsula, and of the tin mines of Banca, is
well known. This range may be considered as the back-bone of the
Great Asiatic Bank. Sumatra, which lies on its western verge, has
been subjected to volcanic action, but not to so great an extent as to
disturb the direction of its mountain range, which runs parallel to
that of the Malay Peninsula. The third and last range that can be
traced into the Indian Archipelago is the one that traverses Laos and
Camboja, at the southern extremity of which it disappears for a time,
showing itself only at Pulo Condor and the Natunas, until it emerges
near the north-west extreme of Borneo, and is continued along the
entire west coast of that island. Here it again disappears, and only
shows itself again on the north coast of Java, where it ceases entirely:
* Since the above was written, I have seen Mr. Darwin?s essay on the
? Structure and Distribution of Coral-reefs,? in which it is satisfactorily shown
that ? Atolls,? or annular reefs, were originally fringing reefs, constructed
around islands that have since subsided.


the remaining portion of this island/with the exception, perhaps, of
a part of the north-west extremity, being either of volcanic formation
or of alluvial deposit. It is rather singular that the celebrated teak-
tree, which abounds on the Cambojan part of this range, but is not
found in Borneo, is again met with here; the projecting part of the
north side of Java, between Samarang and Surabaya, being a vast
teak forest, from the timber of which the greater portion of the
shipping employed in the Archipelago is constructed. Java is the
only island in the Kastern seas in which the teak-tree is indigenous,
nor will it thrive in the volcanic parts of the island, where its cultiva-
tion has been attempted. This, which we may call the Cambojan
Range, is also rich in minerals, especially the Bornean part of it,
where large quantities of gold and many diamonds are obtained by
the miners. The volcanic islands of the Archipelago also contain
metals, gold-dust being found at the bottoms of many of the moun-
tain streams; but it does not exist in veins, as in the Malayan
Peninsula and on the west coast of Borneo, these having apparently
been broken up by the violent convulsions to which these islands have
been subjected. The metal is therefore only obtained from the bot-
toms of the mountain streams, where it has been deposited when the
earth in which it had been contained was washed away.
Volcanic Islands of the Indian Archipelago. ?The lines of volcanic
action to which these islands have been subjected can be traced with
tolerable distinctness. One of these extends along the west coast of
Sumatra and the south coast of Java, whence it is continued by a
chain of islands, separated by narrow but deep channels, to New
Guinea, and can be traced through that island to the Louisiade Archi-
pelago, and is probably continued by New Caledonia and Norfolk
Island to New Zealand, thus forming a curved line resembling the
letter S. The other line commences in Kamtschatka, and extends
through the Kurile Islands, Japan, and Loo-choo, to the Philippines,
where it separates into two branches, one traversing Palawan and the
north-west part of Borneo, where it terminates near the limits of the
Great Asiatic Bank; and the other continuing in a southerly direction
until it comes in contact with the Sumatran line. It is near this
point of contact that the volcanic action has been strongest, throwing
the islands into fantastic forms, of which Celebes and Gillolo furnish
striking examples. These islands all rise abruptly from an unfathom-
able sea, a circumstance unfavourable to their productiveness, since a
arge portion of the rich soil created by the decomposition of the
volcanic rock is washed away into the ocean. Java, however, is
m a great measure exempt from this disadvantage, owing to the


Great Asiatic Bank extending to its northern coast, which prevents
this soil from being lost, in lieu of which it is deposited in vast
plains lying between the mountain range and the sea. These plains
are so surpassingly rich, that they not only yield a sufficiency of grain
for the consumption of a large portion of the population of the Archi-
pelago, but at the same time afford such abundance of sugar and other
tropical produce as to furnish cargoes for many thousand tons of
shipping.
The Great Australian Bank . ?The remark that has been made
with regard to the ranges in the south-eastern part of Asia, is equally
applicable to Australia, since one of the most marked features in the
geography of this continent is the uniformity that exists in the direc-
tion followed by all the continuous mountain ranges that have yet
been discovered. The Darling Range on the west coast of Australia,
the great chain that extends along the north-east coast, with the range
that traverses a portion of South Australia, and in which metallic
ores have lately been found in such abundance, pursue a direction
nearly north-north-west and south-south-east; and although the ranges
on the east coast of New South Wales vary somewhat upon this point,
it is still to so slight a degree as not to require any particular remark.
That this rule is also applicable to the lesser ranges is proved, at
least as far as the shores are concerned, by all the deep inlets on the
coasts of Australia preserving the same general direction; that is,
running parallel to the mountain ranges; indeed, so generally is this
the case, that there is scarcely even a deep bay throughout the entire
coast that does not conform to the general rule. The same occurs in
Van Diemen?s Land; indeed, this island must be considered as being
a portion of Australia, for, although really insular, being surrounded
by water, it is still joined to the continent by a bank of soundings, on
which there is a depth of from thirty-five to forty fathoms.
The great bank which fronts the north and north-west coasts of
Australia commences near the North-west Cape, and extends in a north-
east direction to New Guinea, where it terminates at the base of the
high but narrow mountain range that unites the eastern and western
parts of that island, and separates the Banda Sea from the Great
Pacific. It is at this point that the edge of the bank is most remote
from Australia, the distance to the nearest point of the north coast
being 400 miles. It appears again on the south coast of New Guinea,
near Torres Straits, and extends along the north-east coast of Australia,
the Great Barrier Reefs being on its outer edge.
The Arm islands and New Guinea are thus united to the continent
of Australia; and it is rather a singular coincidence that the kangaroo,


an animal which was long supposed to be peculiar to Australia, is
found both on the Arru islands and on the southern part of New
Guinea; and as no specimens have been met with on the northern
coasts of the latter island by Forrest and the French navigators who
have been there, it seems to exist only on the portion included by the
Great Australian Bank.
New Guinea. ?The northern part of this island, that is to say, the
portion lying to the north and north-west of the range of mountains
already alluded to, partakes of the rugged and broken character of the
volcanic islands of the Indian Archipelago, but the south-western
part is low and undulating, and we may conclude that it bears a
considerable resemblance to the northern coasts of Australia, since the
several Dutch navigators who explored the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
who were in the habit of coasting this part of New Guinea on their
way to Australia, considered them as being portions of the same
continent, and they were thus delineated in our maps until Cook
passed through Torres Strait and decided the question as to their
insularity. A very interesting account of the south-west coast of New
Guinea is given in Modern's ?Narrative of the Voyage of the Dutch
Corvette ? Triton' in the year 1828," when this coast was explored
with a view to forming a settlement; and as it contains information
which bears upon this point, I would willingly make some extracts,
weie they not of too great length to be inserted in a paper of so
general a nature as this must necessarily be.
The Arru Islands. ?This group of islands is situated on the
northern verge of the Great Australian Bank, and extends from north
to south about 100 miles j but as the eastern side of the group has not
been explored, its limits in that direction are uncertain. Some of the
southern islands are of considerable extent, but those to the north,
close to the edge of the bank, are rarely more than five or six miles
in circumference. The land is low, being only a few feet above the
level of the sea, except in spots where patches of rock rise to the
height of about 20 feet, but the lofty trees which cover the face of
the country give it the appearance of being much more elevated.
Coral reefs extend from the shores of all the islands, and in the
eastern parts of the group these are often of great extent. The
islands are divided from each other by narrow channels, some of
which are of great depth, and in one of these there is said to be a
whirlpool of so formidable a description that the natives will not
venture to approach it even in their larger vessels. 1 regret that
during my recent visit to these islands my time was so much occupied
by inquiries connected with the expedition to which I was attached.


that I could not ascertain this fact from personal observation. Upon
the whole, it is evident that this group has not been left quite
untouched by the convulsion which has shaken its neighbours, a
circumstance that might naturally be expected from its position on
the very edge of the bank, and in the close vicinity of the volcanic
chain, the Great Ki Island being only 60 miles distant.
When it is taken into consideration that the primary mountain
ranges both in South-eastern Asia and in Australia pursue a precisely
similar direction, and that the westernmost Asiatic range, if continued,
would strike about the North-west Cape where the western Australian
range commences, while banks extending from both these continents
actually approach to within 450 miles of each other, the question
naturally arises as to whether these continents were ever united. This
inquiry, however, would lead to details of too extensive a nature to be
admissible in a paper of this description, and which would belong
rather to geology than geography, but it is well deserving of being
followed up, since it possesses an interest beyond that which attaches
to geographical matters generally; for if it is found that the mountain
ranges of Australia are a continuation of those of eastern Asia, we
may expect that they will also afford the mineral wealth for which the
latter are so celebrated. Our colonies in Australia are now in a
condition which would render the discovery of valuable minerals of
the very highest importance. The amount of agricultural produce
raised in these colonies is considerably above that required for the
consumption of the inhabitants, who are now anxiously looking about
the world for a market for their surplus produce, and such a market
would be afforded by a population employed in mining operations.
We may reasonably expect that mineral wealth is not confined to the
district of South Australia. The great range extending the entire
length of the north-east coast is of a very promising description, as is also
the range which abuts on the north coast near the new settlement at
Port Essington, and which, if it preserves the same direction which is
observed in the other Australian ranges, may be connected with that
of South Australia. The Liverpool, Adelaide, and Alligator rivers,
the largest yet discovered in Australia, appear to have their sources in
this range.
In conclusion, I will venture to suggest that the great banks
alluded to in this paper might be introduced into our maps of the
Indian Archipelago with very good effect, and if delineated by means
of the dotted lines, as in the accompanying outline map, would rather
improve their appearance than otherwise, while at the same time they
would tend to illustrate, to a certain degree, the geological character


of these countries. We have ample data from which to define their
limits, except at the single point to which I have alluded in this
paper, with regard to the south-west extremity of Celebes. ?[Read
before the Royal Geographical Society of London, June 9th, 1845.)
The above is reprinted from the ? Transactions of the Royal
Geographical Society? of London for the year 1845 (Yol. XV, p.
358). The paper was submitted to the Society by the writer soon
after his return to England from this part of the world, in April,
1845, and was intended as the first of a series of essays, suggesting
points of geographical inquiry necessary to complete a system that
would classify the productive character of the principal islands of the
Indian Archipelago; but circumstances rendered it advisable that the
series should be discontinued. Up to that period the narratives of
travellers in the Indian Archipelago, although replete with valuable
information, were generally deficient in those details necessary to
support a geographical system that would meet the requirements of
the day; ?indeed, the extent and direction of the volcanic band
which traverses the Archipelago, although studded with European
settlements, was still undetermined; the active volcanoes supposed to
exist near the north-west extreme of Borneo, and on Cap Island in Torres
Strait, not having yet been erased from the maps by authority. But
during the seven years that have since elapsed, geographical research
has progressed with such rapidity in this part of the world, that the
general outline of its physical structure has been completed, although
much remains to be done in the way of filling up the details. The
surveying expeditions directed by the English government to those
points where researches could be prosecuted without exciting the
jealousy of other nations, have determined the character of Palawan,
north-western Borneo, the eastern part of New Guinea and of the
Louisiade group; while the scientific inquiries set on foot by the
Netherlands Government with the view of developing the resources of
its Eastern possessions, have greatly enlarged our knowledge of the
southern portion of the Archipelago. And, lastly, the Journal for
which this essay is intended has been the means of bringing together
a mass of practical information illustrating the geography of south-
eastern Asia and the Indian Archipelago, as creditable to the collector
as to the community which has supported his undertaking. In
Australia, also, the progress of discovery has been so rapid and
effectual, as to excite a feeling allied to astonishment in those who
have been accustomed to trace the slow but steady advance of the


early explorers. This new impulse, which will soon leave nothing
more to be done in the way of Australian inland discovery, was com-
menced by a traveller who possessed, m an eminent degree, that
combination of courage and caution necessary to conduct a small
party through regions occupied by wild tribes together with a sound
practical knowledge of all those branches of science to which
attention of travellers in unexplored countries should be directed.
Alas I that I should have to speak in the past tense of a traveller
whose career had scarcely been commenced, and whose generous
devotion to the cause led him to undertake a journey calculated to
decide at once all the remaining points necessary to complete a system
of Australian n-eo-raphy. But the most sanguine have ceased to hope
that even Leichhardt's dauntless spirit can have withstood the privations
entailed by a protracted wandering in the wilderness.
But before entering again on the subject of physical geography,
find it necessary to state explicitly that the possibility of a connection
having once existed between Asia and Australia, which I had advanced
as the great incentive to further inquiry, was disputed at the
meeting of the Geographical Society, before which it was read by one
of the leading members, whose high reputation as a proficient m e
science of geology entitled his opinion to great weight* This oppo-

Windsor Earl. ? On the Physical Structure and Disposition of the Islands of the
EasternArcMpelago.? ? These islands/ says Mr. Earl. ? differ in structure and
elevation; some have gently sloping shores with soundings far put at sea,
others rise abruptly from unfathomable depths, contain lofty mountains, and, in
some cases, active volcanoes, while a third class, comprising some of the larger
islands, as Sumatra and Borneo, are of a mixed character. From the south-
eastern extremity of Asia extends an immense bank of soundings reaching to
the eastern extremity of Java, and near to the western coastt of?Celebes. A
similar bank extends along the whole of the northern coast of Australia and
the south coast of New Guinea. These banks have an average depth of from
thirty to forty fathoms. The distance between the Australian and Asiatic banks
? about 450 miles, and presents an unfathomable channel The nature of he
land in the Malayan Peninsula, the eastern side of Sumatra, the western side
of Borneo, and the northern side of Java, is identical with that of Australia and
the southern portion of New Guinea. The direction of the mountain ranges of
the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra is also identical with the ranges of Australia.
From these facts Mr. Earl argues the former connection of Australia with Asia.
A connection disrupted by volcanic action, as evinced by the fact that a volcanic
belt now intervenes between the two. This belt, beginning at the north-western
extremity of Sumatra, runs along the western side of that island, then along the


sition was founded on the conclusions arrived at by the celebrated
comparative anatomist, Professor Owen, from an examination of
remains of extinct Australian mammals, and which had been developed
at the meeting of the British Association of the previous year. These
conclusions had been adopted by some of the leading geologists, as
will be seen by the following extract from the Presidential Address
delivered at the Anniversary Meeting of the Royal Geographical
Society which took place about the time;
? I cannot make this allusion to the British Association without inviting geo-
graphers not only to repair to the ensuing meeting at Cambridge, but to
endeavour there to propound for discussion, in the Subsection of that great
national institution, which is specially allotted to them, more suggestions than
they have been accustomed to make in former years. Even those geographers
who have no such communications to offer, may rest assured that they will reap
much instruction from the assembled geologists, zoologists, botanists, and
ethnologists. I might indeed simply refer you to the last volume of the Trans-
actions of the British Association, containing the admirable report of Professor
Owen on the extinct mammals of Australia, and the beautiful generalizations
with which it is terminated; and you will instantly see, from evidence offered
by his own science, that this great comparative anatomist takes the broadest
and soundest views of the connection between the ancient and modern distribu-
tion of masses of land. Showing us that, as a whole, the extinct quadrupeds
of our islands are closely analogous to those of the continents of Europe and
Asia, and that these quarters of the globe are separated by no natural boun-
daries which could have caused great variation in the distribution of animal
life. Professor Owen infers that England must have been a portion of the
Continent, when it was tenanted with the same species of now extinct elephants,
rhinoceroses, hippopotami, bisons, hyaenas, tigers, bears, &c., inhabitants of
the common Continent. Even Africa is, on one of its flanks, so slightly
divided from the rest of the Old World of the geographer, that its existing
races of mammals in some sort intermingle; though certain quadrupeds, as
southern side of Java, thence forms the group of islands running west and
east as far as Timor, after which it is continued through the northern portion
of New Guinea, the Louisiade to New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, and New
Zealand; being in form like the letter S. This volcanic belt is joined at
Flores and Timor by another coming from Karastchatka through the Philip-
pines, the north of Borneo, Gillolo, Celebes, Ceram, &c. The existence of the
teak-tree in Java as well as on the Asiatic Continent, and the discovery of the
kangaroo in New Guinea, are adduced by Mr. Earl in further proof of the
former connection of these now dissevered lands : and the similarity in the
direction and character of the Asiatic and Australian mountain ranges renders
it probable that the latter may be found as rich in mineral wealth as the former
are known to be. The paper being concluded, Mr. Murchison, the late
President, took a decidedly opposite view of the matter, and maintained that
nothing short of the discovery of similar ancient fossils in Australia and in
Asia could be admitted as proof of the former connection of the two countries.?


the giraffe and hippopotamus, which have become extinct in Europe and Asia,
still exist in Africa. But when we look to Australia on the one hand, or to
South America on the other, then is the fauna as entirely dissimilar in each, as
we should expect to find it in countries partitioned- off by such wide seas and
great natural barriers, From observing the fact, that the fossil mammalian
remains of these two continents are as unlike those of Europe, Asia and Africa,
as their present quadrupeds, Professor Owen rightly concludes * that the same
forms were restricted to the same provinces at a former geological period, as
they are at the present day;? and thus he sustains the views of modern
geologists, that in those periods immediately anterior to our own, the great
geographical features of the earth must have been the same as those which now
prevail.? ?Address to the Anniversary Meeting of the Royal Geographical Society,

p. 75.
An examination of specimens of Australian fossil Flora brought to
England by Count Strzelecki in 1844, and which had been submitted
to Mr. J. Morris for comparison, presented very different results, as
appeared in the following extract from his report:
? In instituting a comparison between the species collected from the Aus-
tralian deposits, and those described from the Burdwan coal-field by Professor
Royle, we observe both the remarkable analogy of form of some species, and
the actual identity of others ; from which we may probably be led to infer that
the deposition of the strata containing them was not only contemporaneous, but
that the conditions of the flora of some portions of the Indian and Australian
continents, at that epoch, were not very dissimilar.?? Streelecki's Physical
Description of New South Wales, p. 253.
This fact could have been brought forward at the time, as Count
Strzelecki?s work was then published; but as the writer?s object was
merely to promote inquiry, he naturally hesitated in continuing a
controversy which could have answered no useful purpose, and from
which it is by no means probable that he would have come off with
advantage. The recent discovery of fossils of well-known ? Silurian?
species in the mountain ranges of New South Wales,* has further
established the fact that Australia is not an outcast from the family
of continents, notwithstanding Blumenbach?s famous theory. It is
true that the fossil remains of mammals discovered in the limestone
caverns of the Wellington range and the Kanobolus are all of the
marsupial character, hut this merely proves that if mammals of the
forms now existing in Europe and Asia ever inhabited Australia
previous to their introduction by man (which is by no means probable),
they deposited their bones elsewhere.
* See Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for May, 1852, p. 135.


But to return to the subject under review. The great desideratum
of 1845, was a more perfect knowledge respecting the arrangement
and distribution of those tracts of land which showed distinct proof
of disturbance by volcanic action, yet retained in some degree the
characteristics of primary formations. I had an opportunity of
inspecting the eastern extremity of one of these tracts in 1833, when
on the south coast of Java. It is thus described in Dr. Horsfield's
? Mineralogical Sketch of the Island of Java,? which is inserted in
the general map of that island by Sir Stamford Baffles, in his
? History of Java.? ? Extensive district of secondary volcanoes

wackem breccia in the beds of rivers; also porphyry, jasper, cornelian,
agate, obsidian. In some places quartz appearing in rock-crystals,

1838 that I had an opportunity of inspecting one of the larger and
less dependant areas of this formation, on the occasion of a journey
across Moa, one of the islands lying immediately to the east of Timor,
which appeared to consist of a mass of land, upheaved to its present
elevation without any further disturbance of the strata, than was just
sufficient to show that the remains of marine animals of forms corre-
sponding with those still existing in the neighbouring waters, which
are scattered pretty plentifully over the island, owed their presence
rather to the upheaval of the land, than to the retreat of the waters
which must once have covered a portion of its surface. But it is on
the neighbouring island of Timor, where the line of subterranean
action has crossed primary ranges, that the evidence of this simple
upheaval is most striking and distinct. There masses of land of
purely primary formation, with the animal and vegetable kingdoms
closely corresponding with those of the neighbouring continent of
Australia, are found lying on tracts sprinkled with corals and marine
shells, some hundreds (indeed, I may safely say, thousands) of feet
above the present level of the ocean. That these tracts owe their
elevation to upheaval, may be inferred from the circumstance of the
process being still active, a fact that can be ascertained without much
investigation at the principal European ports, Dilli and Copang; in
the former by comparing the present elevation of the reef of coral
which forms the harbour, with the accounts given in the old
and in the latter by inspecting the madreporic cliff on the brow of
which part of the town is erected.
These ? Areas of Upheaval? as I have been induced to name them,
include at least as large a portion of territory in the Indian Archipelago


as that occupied by the active volcanic bands, in which nearly all
traces of former character is lost in the chaos that has been produced
by the intensity of the volcanic heat. The leading characteristics of
the ? Areas of Upheaval? consist in the general distribution of lime-
stone formations, often in the form of the ? mountain limestone? of
England;?in the presence of protruded minerals in those spots where
the line of upheaval has crossed primary ranges, and the subterranean
heat has been sufficiently great to project the metals; ?and in the
prevalence of upraised coal-beds where the subterranean force has
been so slight as to be exhibited only in upheaval, without great
disturbance of the strata.

With a view to simplicity of arrangement, I include under this
term all formations antecedent to the recent volcanic epoch, adopting
as a test the presence of primitive granite in situ. During the last
few years, much additional information has been obtained respecting
the ranges of south-eastern Asia. The Malayan range, the limits
of which are pretty accurately defined by the coast lines of the
Peninsula, remains as before with regard to direction; but many
important and interesting details concerning its geographical struc-
ture will be found in the pages of this Journal. The intercourse
recently opened from this port* with Cambodia, has produced some
valuable information respecting the range which runs along the
western coast of the Indo-Chinese Peninsula, dividing the ancient
kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos from that of Siam.f This range
ceases as a continued chain at Kampot, in lat. 11� S., but is con-
tinued by isolated hills and ranges to the south extreme of the Penin-
sula. No addition has been made to our knowledge of the Anam
or Cochin-Chinese Range, beyond a confirmation of the fact, that
it runs parallel to the east coast of the Peninsula throughout its
length.
In my Essay of 1845, I have continued the Cambodian Range
from the north-west extreme of Borneo to Gunong Ratos, near

Banjar Massin, an error into which I was led from it being the
only primary range on the south coast of Borneo with whose exist-
ence 1 was then acquainted.* More recent data show that this
range, after traversing the western part of Borneo, terminates on the
south coast, a little to the eastward of Kota-ringin. The Gunong
Ratos would, therefore, appear to have been formerly connected with
the primary range which shows at Bintulu, on the north-west coast
of Borneo, and which will be a continuation of one of the Indo-
Chinese Ranges. The Anam, or Cochin-Chinese Range, is that which
can be traced most distinctly across the Archipelago to Australia, at
the present day. The interval between Cochin-China and Borneo will
appear great, unless we consider the reefs and shoals which extend
across this part of the China Sea to be submerged links of the
chain. When once across this submerged area, the primary ranges
of Cape Kaneungan, and the southern limbs of Celebes, continue
with little interruption to a point only 240 miles distant from the
outer verge of the Australian Bank of Soundings; and no great
stretch of the imagination is required to carry it on to the upheaved
remains of primary formations in Timor, and thence to the Arnhem
Peninsula in Australia.
The Sumatran chain must be dismissed from the list of primary
ranges; for although it evidently has been of this formation, and was
probably connected with the continent of Asia by a line passing
through the Nicobars and Andamans, yet the strata have been so
disturbed by the volcanic band which extends along the western coast,
that no portion of the old formation has been detected in situ. An
* I must have fallen into this error from information received during my
visit to Borneo in 1834, as I find these-ranges thus alluded to in a paper on
the Geography of Borneo which I drew up at the request of the late Sir
Alexander Johnston in 1837, and which is published in the Transactions of
the Royal Asiatic Society for that year:
? One of the Eastern Asiatic ranges, after extending along the south-west coast
of Sumatra, terminates at its south-east point. Another runs along the Malay
Peninsula, is lost for a time, but appears again in the high peak of Lingin, and
terminates in Banca and Billiton; and a branch from this separates at Pulo
Tioman, on the east coast of the peninsula, and ends at Carimata, in the strait
between Billiton and Borneo. Two ranges traverse Cambodia and Cochin-
China in the same direction, and these will be found to extend to, and, perhaps,
to traverse Borneo. Between the Cambodian Range and the mountains at
Sarawak, on the north-west extremity of Borneo, the Natunas Islands and Pulo
Condor form the connecting link ; and as the Sarawak hills run to the south-east,
the range is probably continued, either by a connected line, or by isolated
mountains, until it terminates in the Gunong Ratos, near Cape Selatan. All
these ranges abound in metals, which is not the case in Java, where the moun-
tains take another direction.? (Page 186.)


area of upheaval seems to extend along the centre of the island from
one extremity to the other; but the great breadth of the alluvial
plains which form the eastern coast, from Diamond Point to the
Strait of Sunda, has hitherto prevented a close inspection, except in
two or three spots. If the laws which regulate the deposition of the
substances from which coal is formed, and the upheaval of the beds
into positions available for the use of man, are the same here as in
Australia ; the inland parts of Sumatra, opposite this settlement, are
likely to contain coal-beds at least as extensive as those of New South
Wales; but the width of the alluvial plains lying at the base of the
area of upheaval will render them more difficult to discover, as the
cliffs in which the coal crops out on the east coast of Australia rise
abruptly from the sea-shore, and the beds can be detected from boats
passing close along the land.
In the Philippine Islands, Mindanao, the Gilolo Group, and in
the western peninsula of New Guinea, distinct traces of the former
existence of primary formations are shown by the presence of those
descriptions of minerals which are less liable to destruction by intense
volcanic heat; but, as far as my experience goes, no particle of this
formation in its primitive state has been detected throughout the
groups which form the eastern barrier of the Archipelago.
In Australia, the most important modern discovery connected with
physical geography was made by Dr. Leichhardt, during his memor-
able overland journey from Moreton Bay to Port Essington, in 1845;
during which he established the connection between the Monobar
Range which abuts on the north coast near the Cobourg Peninsula,
and the great eastern coast range, from which it appears to branch
off about the parallel of the tropic. Leichhardt only traced the
range across the Arnhem Peninsula, and along the south-western side
of the Gulf of Carpentaria, a distance of about six hundred miles;
but its continuation in the same direction can scarcely be considered
problematical, as at the furthest point reached by Sir Thomas Mitchell
in the following year (about lat. 24�, long. 145�) the country dipped
to the southward towards the stony desert discovered by Captain Sturt
during the previous year (1845), near the northern boundary of the
South Australian colony. In my former Essay, I anticipated that
the Monobar Range would be continued to the neighbourhood of
Spencer Gulf; but if a branch had extended in this direction. Cap-
tain Sturt must have met with it during his late perilous journey in
the interior. The direction taken by the South Australian Ranges
is still undetermined, although it can scarcely be considered doubtful.
This, the only remaining point necessary to complete our acquaintance
with the general physical structure of Australia, would have been


decided had Dr. Leichhardt survived to complete his last journey.
At present, the honour of being the first to trace the course of this
central range appears likely to fall upon the enterprising colonists of
South Australia, who have already pushed their explorations from the
west side of Spencer Gulf along the range to the north-west, and the
result is calculated to encourage them in the further prosecution of
their enterprise.
The Primary ranges rarely attain a very great elevation, about six
thousand feet being the highest point. In this particular they are far
inferior to the Volcanic and Upheaved ranges, but this deficiency is
amply compensated by their excessive width; indeed, each range
seems to consist of a number of small parallel ranges overlying pri-
mary bases, sometimes as much as three hundred miles, and rarely less
than one hundred miles, in breadth. The higher points are generally
massive and rounded,* although peaked mounts are not uncommon,
especially in the neighbourhood of the volcanic bands. The only
known table-lands of large extent are those of Laos or Upper Cam-
bodia, and the plains discovered by Sir Thomas Mitchell, in 1846,
near the northern boundary of New South Wales. The latter are
two thousand feet above the level of the sea.
Productive Character. ?The primary ranges in South-eastern Asia
and the Indian Archipelago are all more or less metalliferous, but the
labour of working under-ground, and extracting the metals from the
matrix, is so unsuited to the habits of the natives, that mining
operations are only carried on in those countries which are subjected
to despotic governments. Lead mines are worked in that part of the
Malayan Range which traverses the kingdom of Ava;f and copper
mines have been opened in the An'am or Cochin-Chinese Range, the
produce of which is equal in quality to South American copper, but
inferior to that of Japan. The produce of these mines has been
imported into Singapore, that of Anam in considerable quantities;
but the cessation of commercial intercourse has put a stop to the
* The sketch of Lumpo Batang in Vol. V, of this Journal, p. 617, affords a
fair specimen of the primary elevations.
f It is deserving of remark that lead is found only in those parts of the
primary ranges of South-eastern Asia which have been undisturbed by volcanic
action, while, on the other hand, tin is found only where the primary ranges
have been penetrated by volcanic currents of sufficient force to project the
metal in a liquid state into the detritus formed by the decomposition of the
primary rock. This peculiarity in the metalliferous character of different parts
of the same mountain range is well deserving of attention. Can thetin of the
Malayan Peninsula originally have been lead, transmuted by the action of
volcanic currents ? {July, 1853.)


importation. Iron is also smelted from the native ores on the
western side of the Anam Range, and it is said that silver mines are
also worked, but I cannot vouch for the correctness of the report.
Elsewhere in this region, mining operations are confined to the
collection of metals that have been projected from the original site
by subterranean heat, which can be traced distinctly to compara-
tively recent volcanic action. The tin of the Malay Peninsula, Banka,
and Billiton, and the gold of the Peninsula, Borneo, and Celebes, are
all collected from the detritus in which the projected metal has been
deposited. Lead and antimony ore are found in the Cambodian
Range to the north of Kampot, but no mines have been opened.
In Australia, the southern portions only of the primary ranges
have been attentively examined; but as far as the search has been
extended, it would go to prove that the primary formations of this
continent are equally metalliferous with those of South-eastern
Asia. Copper ores have been found at Port Curtis, near the southern
extremity of the range which extends along the north-east coast, and
as long ago as 1802, Flinders met with indications of copper at
Good?s Island in Torres Strait; but his suggestion does not seem to
have been followed up by subsequent explorers.
?The stone is granitic and brittle; but there is also porphyry, and
in one place I found streaks of verdegrease, as if the cliffs above had
contained copper ore.?? Flinders 3 Voyage to Terra Australia, vol. n.
p. 120.
Lead and copper mines have been worked in South Australia for
some years past, and others have been opened recently in the western
coast range, a little to the north of Swan River. The massive range
which extends from Cape Leeuwin to Cape Naturalist does not appear
to have yet been explored, but from a cursory examination of its
southern extremity, during a residence in the neighbourhood in 1831,
I was led to expect that this south-western peninsula might some
day become the Cornwall of Australia. Hematitic and specular iron
ore, and copper pyrites, have been found on the north-west coast,
near Admiralty Gulf; which may be considered sufficient to establish
the metalliferous character of the northern part of the Central Aus-
tralian Ranges.
The productive character of the surface soil of this formation,
which consists chiefly of decomposed sandstone and crystalline rock,
is inferior to that of both the other areas; indeed, it is only in the
great river basins, which are favourably situated for irrigation, that
agricultural produce is raised in sufficient quantities to allow a surplus
for exportation. But, on the other hand, the superior quality of the


forest timber which overspreads this area is daily becoming more
appreciated, and probably many valuable gums and guttas still
remain to be discovered. In Australia, .the prevailing vegetation
differs materially in its character from that of South-eastern Asia,
the forms now existing throughout the interior of Australia being
identical with those discovered in the coal-beds of New South Wales,
and, it would seem, in those of Upper India also. The process by
which the existing forms of Indian vegetation have been introduced,
may be traced in the following extract from a little work describing
the Cobourg Peninsula and Port Essington, which was published by
the writer when last in England:
? Throughout the Cobourg Peninsula, generally near the sea-shore, are found
patches of land varying in extent from two or three acres to fifty acres and
upwards, on which the vegetation is perfectly in character with that of the
islands of the Indian Archipelago. These spots are covered with a thick
jungle, difficult to penetrate, and the trees are often of an enormous size.
Among these I have recognized the waringin, or banyan-tree of the Indian
Islands ; the kanari, (a tree producing a nut which yields a kind of sweet-oil,
and under the shade of which the nutmeg-trees are planted at Banda), together
with many others common to the Spice Islands. The shrubs, and even the
birds that inhabit these patches, are also in character with those of the Indian
Islands; the kangaroo, which seeks shelter here from its enemy, the native
dog, being almost the only peculiarly Australian animal that is found in them,
and these obtain their food in the open grounds.
?The plants obtained from the countries of the Archipelago that are of the
primary formation, invariably flourished better than those from the volcanic
islands; the productions of Singapore and of the Malayan Peninsula adapting
themselves at once to their new quarters. This is accounted for by the circum-
stance of the soil, and even the rocks and stones of the northern coasts of
Australia being precisely similar in their character to those of the countries in
the south-eastern parts of Asia. Even the general direction taken by the hill-
ranges is the same in both countries, and were it not that they are separated by
a narrow, but unfathomable gorge, studded with volcanic islands, they might
be considered as forming portions of the same region. The indigenous pro-
ductions of the soil certainly differ considerably in their character, but a process is
at present going on in Australia which, in the course of time, if left untouched,
would produce a similarity upon this point. Innumerable patches of oriental
vegetation, many of them thousands of acres in extent, are spreading inland
from the northern and eastern coasts, even in spots far beyond the tropic,
eating up, as it were, the Australian vegetation, which disappears before them
as the marsupials disappear before the animals of Europe. Every inch of
ground gained is made good. The dense foliage, impervious to the sun?s rays,
spreads out above, sheltering the mass of dank vegetation that accumulates on
the surface of the ground, which is thus left to rot and form new soil.?*?En-
terprise in Tropical Australia, pp. 76 and 106. ( London , 1845.)
* Vegetation of the above character prevails throughout the coasts of the


The leading feature of an Australian landscape consists in the open
nature of the forest, which proves highly favourable to pastoral pur-
suits. Owing to the comparative poverty of the soil, the growth of
the forest trees is slow, producing that durability in the timber for
which the English oak is so esteemed, but in a much greater degree,
the wood of several of the prevailing forms of the Eucalyptus being
apparently indestructible except by fire, and then it burns with slow-
ness, throwing out a heat scarcely inferior to that produced from
coal ; indeed, the common gum-wood, burning in the galley range of
a frigate, when the flame ceases, can scarcely be distinguished from
a glowing sea-coal fire. Stumps of trees cut down in the neighbour-
hood of Sydney in 1788, were still standing in 1847, without any
other appearance of decay than the destruction of the bark, and will
probably, if undisturbed, continue in the same state for a century to
come. But the chief value of this timber consists in several varieties
being obnoxious to the teredo or worm which perforates and destroys
submerged timber, and proves so destructive to ships" bottoms and
wooden piles, especially in these tropical regions. The piles that
were driven in 1838 to form the jetty at Port Essington, were per-
fectly sound when the settlement was abandoned ten years after-
wards, while foreign timber that was allowed to remain in the water
alongside the pier only for a few days, was invariably attacked by the
teredo.
Up to a very recent period, the submerged banks which extend
from Asia and Australia (coloured green in the map), furnished the
principal articles of commerce supplied by the primary region. Agar-
agar, a marine lichen extensively used in China?trepang or sea-slug,
and mother-o"-pearl shell, are common to both banks ; but the Aus-
tralian bank is by far the most productive, probably from its not
having yet been so extensively worked as the Asiatic bank.
Indian Islands, and has overspread the primary ranges of the Malay Peninsula
and Western Borneo, but I have never been able to discover an instance of its
having penetrated to the more elevated parts of areas of upheaval. The
Waringin, or banyan- tree of the further East (Ficus Indica? F. Benjamina?
F. Metrocarpa ?) is often found on the hill-tops of the latter area; but accord-
ing to the traditions of the natives, by whom they are regarded and preserved
as sacred, they were planted there by their ancestors. In the interior of
Sumatra, Celebes, Borneo (south-east part), Sumba, and Timor, the country is
so open, that the deer are chased on horseback, and captured with the lasso;
and, as a general rule, all those islands in which horses are bred, have open
forest country in the interior.? {July, 1853.)


CHAPTER 111.
VOLCANIC BANDS.
Limits and direction of the Volcanic Bands?Necessity for a combined series of
observations on volcanic activity-intensity of subterranean heat in the vol-
canic areas ?Corresponding subsidence of the adjacent surface-Productive
character : Paucity of valuable natural productions?Agricultural produce ot
the Philippines, Moluccas, Sunda Chain, and Sumatra.
The limits of the Volcanic band which crosses the Archipelago are
so distinctly defined by the active volcanoes with which it is studded,
that no difficulty is now experienced in tracing its course, ihe ew
facts that our limited knowledge of the laws which regulate volcanic
currents have enabled me to collect, lead to the inference that the
volcanic stream originally commenced in the neighbourhood of
Kamtschatka, from which it takes a south-west direction through
the Kurile Islands, Japan, and Loo Choo, skirting the coast of Asia
to Formosa, where it abruptly turns to the south and south-east
through the Philippines and Mindanao to the Moluccas; embracing the
eastern extreme of Celebes and the western peninsula of New Guinea,
and then curves to the westward along the Trans-Javan Cham to e
Strait of Sunda, when it assumes a north-westerly direction throng
Sumatra and the Andamans to Cheduba Island, in the northern part
of the Ray of Bengal. It is not without a certain degree of hesitation
that I have continued the band from the western extreme of New
Guinea along the north coast of that island to New Britain, although
its volcanic character has been decided by recent French navigators,
for there remains a tract including thirteen degrees of longitude in
which no active volcano has yet been seen. Indeed, it is by no means
improbable that the band which takes a southerly direction from
* D?Entrecasteaux, Duperrey, and Dumont D?Urville.


Japan through Fatzima, the Bonin, and Mariana Islands, may prove
to be continued to New Ireland; in which case the chain of active
volcanoes which extends through the Solomon Islands and the New
Hebrides to New Zealand, and perhaps farther to the south, may
indicate the course of an independent stream.
It is to be regretted that no series of observations has as yet been
made on the periods of volcanic activity in different parts of the
bands, as a mere daily record kept at the European settlements
which are scattered along them, from Kamtschatka to New Zealand
and from the Moluccas to Bengal, during only a single year, would
furnish data from which important points could be decided that can
now be only matters of conjecture. Indeed, there can be no objec-
tion to such a simple and inexpensive series of observations being
carried out throughout the world. The lines of volcanic action
which have all but separated Europe and Asia from Africa, and the
northern from the southern continent of America, have evidently
been ruled by the same law with that which has effected the separa-
tion of Eastern Asia from Australia; and the question must soon be
boldly entertained whether the circulation of volcanic electricity is not
as necessary to maintain the productive character of the globe, as
that of the blood to preserve vital existence in the human body. But
it is in the Indian Archipelago, where the process by which volcanic
regions have been formed is still actively progressing, and where the
smooth seas afford easy access to all the chief points of interest, that
the greatest facilities are afforded for prosecuting the researches
necessary to establish the basis of a system.*
Since the previous publication of this Essay (May, 1852) the entire surface
of the globe seems to have been affected by earthquake shocks more or less
violent. A physical geographer, with time at his disposal for pursuing the
inquiry, would furnish a highly valuable contribution to science by collecting
the dates at which each of these phenomena occurred, as the result would
probably be sufficient to show whether any connection existed between the
volcanic bands of different regions. The convulsion of nature which lately
desolated the islands of the Banda group, commenced on the 26th of November
1852. and continued with very little intermission until the 22nd of the follow-
ing month. The first shock was felt on the same day, and almost at the same
fuT*.? 'f ra ?? A mboyna and Ternate, a fact which would seem to indicate
that the breadth of the volcanic current in this neighbourhood was at least
three hundred miles. The undulations in all these places were from the north-
east hrom this point the current seems to have extended along both branches
ot the band, reaching Shanghae, on the east coast of China, on the 16th of
December, where the undulations were from the south-west. Its progress
along the western branch of the band appears to have been much less rapid, ar


In these regions, so great has been the intensity of the subter-
ranean heat, that where the volcanic bands have crossed or passed
along ranges of the primary formation, scarcely a vestige of their
former character remains, the primitive rocks being metamorphosed,
and even the metals they contained melted up and dissipated, with
the single exception of one of the most indestructible of all metallic
substances?gold, the presence of which in minute grains, deposited
in the beds of mountain streams, being, as far as I have been able
to discover, the only evidence that now remains to point out the
former existence of primary ranges.*
The process by which the volcanic formations have been thrown up,
and by which large tracts of land in which the subterranean action
has not broken through the surface have been raised to their present
level, seems invariably to have been attended by a corresponding
subsidence of the surface in their immediate neighbourhood; indeed,
the facts brought forward by Mr. Darwin, in his Essay on the
? Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs,? go to prove that this
subsidence still continues in those parts which are not affected by
active subterranean force. The banks of soundings which extend
from Asia and Australia present features which must class them as
? Areas of Subsidence,? with the exception of certain spots which have
been penetrated by lines of upheaval, and where the fringing reefs
the shock was not felt at Batavia, near the west end of Java, until the 20th of
December, and, as might be expected, its force was much diminished. As the
great meridional band of Eastern Asia is apparently connected with that of the
American continents by the Aleutian Islands, it would be interesting to know
whether the shocks recently felt on the eastern shores of the Pacific were con-
nected with the convulsion at Banda. {July, 1853.)
* The extensive distribution of minute particles of gold in the islands lying
between Asia and Australia leads me to infer that this metal is very generally
diffused throughout the granite rock of the primary ranges, but in a state
unavailable for the use of man until the metal has been collected and expelled
by the chemical action of volcanic currents. The process by which the liquid
metal seems to have been projected into the detritus at the base or on the
slopes of the ranges, may be illustrated by rolling up a slip of writing-paper,
and dipping the end in oil or tallow and then lighting it by the flame of a
candle, when it will be seen that the melted tallow runs along the roll of paper
before the advancing flame. In like manner the fused granite, which is always
found in the form of eruptive rock in the immediate neighbourhood of gold
deposits, may have been the medium by which the melted metal has been
expelled. It is certain that the richest gold deposits of Borneo, Celebes, and
New South Wales, are found near the extreme ends of extinct volcanic areas.
{July, 1853.)


distinctly point out the character of the rocks and islets. Beyond
the limits of these ? Banks of Soundings? the sea is everywhere
unfathomable a mile or two from the shore; indeed, in many spots
no soundings can be obtained with an ordinary deep-sea lead line
from the brow of the limestone cliffs which often bound the shores
of areas of upheaval. Even where the banks of soundings have been
penetrated by areas of upheaval, the depth of water is greater than
elsewhere; and the shores, instead of sloping gradually into the sea,
fall at once to depths corresponding with those of the bank generally.
This is particularly apparent on the north-west coast of Borneo; in
the neighbourhood of Bawian and Salombo ; and on the western side
of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Productions. ?The productive character of the Volcanic areas is
totally distinct from that of the primary formations. With the
exception of gold, which is found scattered in minute particles in the
beds of the mountain streams, no single production of the primary
areas repays the labour of collection. This deficiency is amply com-
pensated by the surpassing richness of the soil produced from the
volcanic rock, which decomposes rapidly before the influence to the
atmosphere. The natural productions of the vegetable kingdom
are unimportant, the nutmeg, which is scattered over that portion
of the band which approaches the continent of Australia, being
almost the sole exception. But the docility of the native inha-
bitants proved to be such that they were easily coerced to labour,
and the curved volcanic band which traverses the Archipelago
became studded with European settlements throughout its length
and breadth, which now yield the great bulk of the produce
exported from the Indian Archipelago. In the northern part
of the Philippines, the famed Manilla tobacco is the chief pro-
duction; sugar-plantations, which supply the Australian colonies,
occupy the centre; and the musa textilis, which yields the Manilla
hemp, is the chief product of the south. Spices are almost the sole
production of the Dutch settlements of the Moluccas, inferior articles
being neglected, as is the case in countries which produce gold.
Some of the islands east of Java are still independent of European
control, and these yield productions suited to the wants of the natives
to such an extent as to give rise to an export trade with all parts of
the Archipelago. In Java, coffee, sugar, rice, and tobacco, are the
most important articles, the two first being exported to Holland in
immense quantities. Coffee and pepper are the chief products of
Sumatra, where the soil is less fertile than in some of the other


islands of the band. The volcanic agency here becomes comparatively
weak, and is confined to the outer coast of the island, where, being
backed by an area of upheaval, the greater portion of the alluvium
descends into the sea and is lost. I have not sufficient data to enable
me to define the area of upheaval which intervenes between the
volcanic band and the north-eastern coast from the neighbourhood of
Palembang northward, but its existence is distinctly shown in the
detritus brought down by the rivers. It is probably owing to this
circumstance that the alluvial plains of Sumatra, which abut on the
Great Asiatic Bank, are less fertile than those of Java, where the
alluvium almost exclusively consists of decomposed volcanic rock.

Under this head are included all those masses of land which
furnish evidence of having been raised to their present level by
subterranean action, but in which the volcanic heat has either never
found vent in the surface, or has subsided at periods anterior to the
present epoch. These areas may be subdivided into two classes?
the first consisting of spurs extending from the western side of the
volcanic band which bounds the Archipelago to the eastward; the
other, consisting of masses of upheaved land, lying parallel and
adjacent to the volcanic band. The first subdivision displays crystal-
line, igneous and aqueous rocks, upraised occasionally to immense
elevations, with every degree of disturbance, from mere dislocation of
the strata, to a state of chaos scarcely inferior to that of the volcanic
areas. In fact, these spurs furnish intrinsic evidence of having once
been traversed by volcanic streams whose activity has ceased, probably
at the period in which the stream finally succeeded in breaking across
the primary ranges at a point where they offered least resistance. The
prevalence of limestone formations, often exhibiting fossil remains of
still existing species of marine animals, is the leading feature both of
the larger and smaller areas?indeed, the latter only differ from the
others in being immediately dependent on an active Volcanic band.


Commencing to the north, the first area of Upheaval can he traced
from the neighbourhood of Manilla in the Philippines through
Mindoro, Palawan, and along the north-western part of Borneo,
where the subterranean force has penetrated and piled up the Primary
ranges, but appears to have been stopped by the westernmost range,
which, although disturbed, has not been broken through. The absence
of any other visible cause, leads me to attribute the extraordinary
projection of metal into the surface soil at the western base of the
range, to the agency of this once active volcanic stream, but it is only
recently that I have been able thus to account for the phenomena I
met with when inspecting the gold mines of Montradok in 1834.*
This rule will be found equally applicable to the gold deposits of the
Malayan Peninsula, Sumatra, Celebes, Timor, and New South Wales,
the deposits being only found on the side of the range opposite to that
against which the volcanic force has been directed.
A second area extends from Mindanao through the Sulu chain to
the north-east extreme of Borneo, but its farther progress cannot be
traced until we are better acquainted with the geography of the
interior of that island. A third line extends from the north-east
extreme of Celebes, where the Klobat Mountain is still an active
volcano, through the northern peninsula of that island; and small
areas of upheaval, with a corresponding subsidence of the adjacent
surface, can be traced through the Little Paternosters, Pulo Laut,
and Salorabo, to Bawian. The subterranean force which has elevated
Madura, and the chain of islands extending from it to the eastward,
may have come from the north; but as the volcanic band passes in
the immediate neighbourhood, it w T ill not be safe to include these
islands in an independent area of upheaval, until geological investi-
gations shall have shown their character to correspond with that of
other parts of the area.
The eastern peninsula of Celebes, the Xulla Isles, Buru, Ceram
and Mysol, all belong to this system, and I should be inclined to
trace the line of upheaval from the neighbourhood of New Guinea,
hut some confusion exists hereabouts which cannot be cleared up
without farther inquiries. In all the recent physical maps that I have
had access to, an active volcano is laid down as existing in the north-
west part of Amboyna. As no mention is made by Valentyn or other
old writers of an active volcano in this neighbourhood, I was not very
minute in my inquiries when there in 1843, being satisfied that the
southern peninsula possessed, in an eminent degree, all the charac-
?The Eastern Seas, &c.,? p. 281, et seq.


teristics of upheaval without great disturbance of the surface?the
limestone formations, especially being apparently in the same relative
position as when first formed. But as this volcano must have been
placed there on authority, I am not inclined to pronounce against its
existence, especially as the range in the eastern part of Ceram is
deflected to the south, or at right angles to the course of simple
upheaval in that vicinity. In this case, a volcanic band must be
introduced as passing south from Gillolo through Ceram and Am-
boyrta to the isolated volcano distant 180 miles to the south-south-
west of the latter island. Should this prove to be the fact, a volcanic
band will either have crossed an area of Upheaval, or must have
thrown out lines of upheaval simultaneously to the right and left,
phenomena which do not appear in other parts of the Archipelago.
The fourth area of Upheaval extends from the southern part of the
western peninsula of New Guinea through the Keh Islands, Timor
Laut, the Serwatty Islands, and Timor, to Sumba, or Sandalwood
Island. A recent volcanic band skirts the north-western part of this
area rather closely, Serua, Nila, and Damma having been active
volcanoes since the arrival of Europeans in the Archipelago, but they
are now either extinct, or very rarely in a state of activity. In my
Essay of 1845 I have pronounced the peaked mountain at the north-
east extremity of Timor to be in a state of activity, having been
induced to do so by the reports of natives of the adjacent island,
Kissa, and from my having on two several occasions seen the summit
of the mountain in a state of ignition, but I have since been informed
by gentlemen connected with the Portuguese settlements in Timor,*
that there are no active volcanoes in the eastern part of the Island. I
must therefore have been deceived by the burnings of the jungle which
the natives make towards the close of the year, for the purpose of
clearing new lands for cultivation.
The eastern islands of the Arm Group have been upheaved to the
height of from 80 to 150 feet, a fact I was not made acquainted with
until recently, although I had detected evidences of disturbance when
visiting the half-drowned western islands of the group. As the animal
and vegetable kingdoms still correspond very closely with those of
Australia, these islands afford a clue to the former condition of the
area now occupied by the Great Australian Bank. So long ago as
1837 the writer endeavoured to draw attention to the Arru Group in
a paper detailing the few important facts that were known concerning
it, which was read at a meeting of the Geographical Society; but
with the exception of a flying visit to the western part by Commodore
* Colonel Cabrera, late Governor of Dilli, and several others.


d?Urville in 1839, when on his way from Port Essington to Torres
Strait, and an equally hasty exploration we made in H.M.S. ? Bntomart?
in 1843, nothing has been done towards extending our geographical
knowledge of this group. The Dutch scientific expedition of 1837,
which has contributed so much towards dissipating the cloud of
mystery that hangs over these eastern islands, passed near the group
on more than one occasion without calling; but it is to be hoped that
the spirit of inquiry which is now predominant in Netherlands India,
will not allow this small but interesting portion of its territory to
remain a terra incognita.
The area next in rotation is that which extends along the centre of
the great or eastern Peninsula of New Guinea, at least I have been
induced to class this great mountain range as an area of upheaval.
The western part of the range, which terminates at Cape Bum on the
south-west coast, has been known for nearly three centuries, and is
named in the old Dutch charts ? Sneeuw Bergen? or the Snowy
Mountains, owing to the upper portion of the range, as seen from the
coast, appearing from its dazzling whiteness, especially when the sun
is near the horizon, to be covered with perpetual snow. The altitude
of this part of the range, as estimated by the officers of the Dutch
corvette ? Triton? in 1838, is only exceeded in this part of the world
by that of the Himalaya. The eastern part of the range has lately
been seen by Captains Blackwood and Stanley, and was found to
consist of very high land, but scarcely attaining half the elevation
assigned to the western portion. Captain Stanley did not survive to
reach England, or he would probably have furnished some interesting
details respecting the physical geography of this region. Prom the
published narrative of his voyage, it would appear that the south-
east extreme of New Guinea, beyond the parallel of 9� south, is of
primary formation. The central mass of mountain land has evidently
been the result of upheaval, but whether the volcanic force is still
active, can only be decided when the range comes to be closely exa-
mined. I have therefore coloured this part yellow, as indicating
simple upheaval. ?
Traces of upheaval are shown on the western coast of the Gult ot
Carpentaria, by the notes of Captain Flinders in his ? Voyage to
Terra Australis,? and by the description of the specimens given by
Dr. Fitton in his Essay on the Geology of Australia which is appended
to Captain King?s narrative; and evidence of the same nature was
detected by Dr. Leichhardt in the interior of the Arnhem Peninsula,
when crossing the line of action indicated by the direction of the
ranges in the north-western horn of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Moun-


tain limestone is alone wanting to complete the resemblance of this
area to that which extends from the south part of the western
peninsula of New Guinea, named above the ? Timorian Area.? The
Essay of Dr. Eitton above alluded to, was read before the Geological
Society of London in 1825. It is entitled ?An Account of some
Geological Specimens, &c.but it is, in fact, a collection of all the
geological data connected with Australia then extant, arranged and
commented upon in a manner so eminently suggestive of points of
inquiry, that the name of the author must be recorded as ? Father?
of the science of Physical Geography in Australia. Dr. Fitton?s
attention was particularly directed to the striking uniformity of
arrangement that had been observed by Captain Flinders in the
hill-ranges and chains of islands forming the north-west horn of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, and their pai?allelism to the great range of Timor
is distinctly noticed. Nor did he fail to call attention to the singular
flat-topped hills which present so striking a feature on the northern
coasts of Australia, and which had not yet been examined about the
upper parts. Two of the most remarkable of these hills are situated
on the Cobourg Peninsula, and were repeatedly examined by parties
attached to the garrison of Port Essington. Dr. Fitton?s anticipation
of their importance as illustrative of physical geography, proved to be
well founded; but as a description is not necessary to elucidate the
particular subject now under review, I prefer making the ? Flat-
topped Hills? the subject of a separate Essay.
The sixth and last area of the first class is found in the south-
eastern part of Australia and in the eastern part of Van Diemen?s
Land. This area has been examined by one of the most practised
observers of the day, the Count P. de Strzelecki, during a course of
exploration extending over a period of five years, commencing in
1839; and the leading features of these important districts will be
found fully described in his ?Physical Description of New South
Wales and Van Diemen?s Land.?*
* From a report of the proceedings of the Geological Society in the Lon-
don Athenaeum of February the 21st of this year (1852), I perceive that two
distinguished Geologists have brought their rival claims to the honour of
having anticipated the discovery of Gold in Australia, before that Society. A
mere cursory perusal of Count Strzelecki?s publication will be sufficient to show,
that by proving the physical features of the Sydney mountain range to be iden-
tical with those of the Russian Ural, the great gold-field of the day, he pro-
nounced in language that could not be mistaken by the merest smatterer in
Geology, the auriferous nature of its deposits. That he did not distinctly say
search and you will find? will be sufficiently understood and appreciated
by those who are aware that such an announcement was calculated to


The areas of the second class invariably extend in a direction
corresponding with that of the part of the volcanic band on which
they depend. Commencing to the north, the chain of islands which
runs along the coast of Tenasserim, from Martaban to the neighbour-
hood of Penang, is an area of upheaval; and the contiguous coast
affords evidence of having been subjected to the same influence.
The southernmost point in which upheaved limestone has been
detected is at Palo Bidan, a few miles to the north of Penangj but
it would appear from the projection of the metals in a liquid state,
that the whole of the Malayan Range, including Linga and Banka,
has been affected by volcanic action. The chain of islands which
extends along the west coast of Sumatra is of a similar character
to the Tenasserim Chain. These islands have been geologically
described by Dr. Jack, who inspected the group at the instance
of Sir Stamford Baffles, when Governor of Bencoolen (? Geological
Transactions/? 2nd series, vol. I.) The two areas of Upheaval in
Java are distinctly defined in Dr. Horsfield?s geological map. Their
connection with the volcanic band cannot be doubted. The south-
eastern extreme of Java, the south point of Bali, and Banditti Island
in the Straits of Lombok, are all upheaved table-lands, bounded by
precipitous limestone cliffs, several hundred feet in elevation. Areas
of simple upheaval are found on the north side of the volcanic band
at Flat Island, Rusa Radji, and Lingit, and at the Iron Cape of
Flores.
render valueless the pastoral property of -those hospitable settlers who had
received him with open arms throughout the southern colonies. Indeed the
precious metal had already been discovered by an old shepherd of the Welling-
ton district (named MacGregor, if I remember right), who had long been m
the habit of carrying with him specimens of gold embedded in quartz, on his
annual visits to Sydney with his flock of fat wethers. He did not disclose the
locality in which he found them, but it was evident that he must have picked
them up somewhere on his sheep-walk. In fact the Count must have re-
peatedly been made aware of the anxiety of the stock-holders, who feared that
MacGregor?s discovery might lead the shepherds to neglect the flocks while
searching for the precious metal. MacGregor was as assuredly the discoverer
of Australian gold in the ? matrix,? as was Mr. Hargreaves of the metalliferous
deposits ; but by far the greater merit is due to the latter, as his discovery was
not the result of accident, but of deductions drawn from comparison with the
geological features of the auriferous regions in California.?-[The above note
was inserted in theoriginal issue of this Essay in May, 1852. The writer thinks
it necessary to mention the fact, as an attempt has been made, through the
medium of a literary periodical of some standing, to include him among the
bevy of ? claimants.? The ? Et tu quoque? style of argument is not adapted for
determining points of geographical inquiry.]
D


Productive Character. ?The excessive fertility of soil which cha-
racterizes the narrow band in which the volcanic stream is still
active, does not extend to the areas in which the circulation has
ceased; nevertheless, the fertilizing qualities of decomposed lime-
stone have aided in forming a soil better adapted for the growth
of produce necessary for the sustenance of man than the rich, fat
soils of the volcanic bands. Maize, upland rice, yams, and other
esculent roots, here attain perfection, and the nourishing qualities of
the produce are apparent in the superior vigour of inhabitants of
areas of upheaval. The wheat grown in the uplands of Timor is
remarkably rich in gluten, although the small size of the grain gives
it an unfavourable appearance in European eyes. The cultivation of
produce adapted for commerce is still in its infancy, owing to the
lands of this formation having hitherto been neglected in favour of
volcanic tracts, but its prospects are by no means disheartening.
The coffee, cotton, cocoa, and hemp (musa textilis), grown on the
upheaved areas, are the best produced in the Archipelago ,? although
the soil is not calculated to produce sugar or spice equal to that of the
volcanic band. The mineral wealth of these areas is, however, more cal-
culated to attract European enterprise. Coal has been found, whenever
it has been sought for with diligence, in spots favourable for its deposit;
iron ore of excellent quality is abundant where the line of upheaval has
crossed primary ranges; and limestone, so necessary as a flux in
smelting the metal, is found everywhere; so that the larger areas
possess those elements that have mainly contributed to the prosperity
of Great Britain. Eortunately, the gold deposits in the western parts
of the Archipelago are now pretty well exhausted ; and in the more
remote regions, Timor, and possibly Sumba, are the only spots in
which the steady course of industry is likely to be interrupted by
the search for precious metals. The native chiefs of the former
island, terrified by the rapacity of the early European navigators,
are said to have combined in establishing a law which made searching
for gold a capital crime, except on occasions in which it was thought
proper to propitiate the deities by the dedication of a Bulan Mas, or
golden moon, when a human being was sacrificed to the spirit of the
mines before the gold could be collected. This ceremony is probably
alluded to in the ? Account of Timor,? published in Mr. Moor?s
? Notices of the Indian Archipelago.? Appendix, p. 6.*
* The name of the author is not given, and after diligent inquiry, I have
been unable to trace his identity; but from the tenor of his remarks I suspect
that he must have resided some time at Coupang, and collected his information
concerning the more remote islands from parties employed in the commerce of


The Edible Nest, which is constructed by the Hirundo Esculenta
in the caverns of the limestone cliffs, is found throughout the areas
of simple upheaval, but not elsewhere; so that this singular produc-
tion, which from its value is well known to those engaged in the
commerce of the Archipelago, furnishes one of the best tests for
deciding the character of the region in which it is found.
its dependencies;?otherwise he could not have described Sumba as a low
island, not much higher than Madura. Nevertheless I can affirm the general
correctness of his observations, as I had Mr. Moor?s book with me when I first
visited Timor in 1839; and repeated visits during the five following years
enabled me to make inquiries upon nearly every point he has brought forward.
Mr. Hazaart, who appears to have been the Resident of Coupang at the period
of his sojourn, was so strongly impressed with a belief in the metalliferous
wealth of the southern part of the island, that he would scarcely converse on
any other subject, and his incessant appeals to the government led to a com-
mission of inquiry, headed by M. Macklot, an eminent mineralogist, being sent
to Timor. An overland journey was made with a large party to Filarang,
where abundance of copper was found, but the strata had been so broken up,
that mining operations could not have been prosecuted with advantage (See
Journal I. A. IV, p. 495). The reputed gold deposits, which lie on the south
side of the island, were not examined. Quicksilver in a pure state is sometimes
brought to Coupang by natives from the interior, and as the collection from
the hollows of the rocks in which it is deposited does not entail heavy labour, it
might become an article of commerce were its value known.


CHAPTER y.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.
Marsupial Character of Fossil Remains of Mammals in Australia?Distribution
of existing Forms throughout the Archipelago?Asiatic Forms in Java,
Borneo and Sumatra?Distribution of Marsupials in New Guinea, Ceram,
Timor and Celebes?Extent of Asiatic and Australian Groups?Test of the
comparative antiquity of Areas of Upheaval?Volcanic Bands?Epoch of
disconnection.
In venturing to draw conclusions from the facts presented by a
study of the Physical Geography of the Eastern Islands, I do not
presume to trench upon that prescriptive right to generalize on the
notes of travellers, which has for some years past been conceded to
leaders of Geological Science, hut rather to note those suggestions
which naturally arise from extensive voyaging through a region
whose physical character is yet undetermined. Until the general
outlines, at least, have been ascertained, science must still be indebted
to those travellers who have had opportunities of acquiring practical
information, for that preliminary arrangement which philosophers
may extend to a system. That a connection once existed between Asia
and Australia is, I think, established by the simple facts brought for-
ward by Mr. Morris, in Count Strzelecki?s work; indeed, those who
asserted contrary opinions in 1845 were (innocently, I am sure) sup-
porting the famous spontaneous-development theory of the ? Vestiges of
Creation/? which was exciting the indignation of the scientific world at
the time. The opposition my suggestions then met with is not likely to
be renewed, for the leading Geologist of the day will scarcely repudiate
a region that he has admitted into his own ? Silurian? beds ; and
the Professor of comparative anatomy will probably reconsider the
conclusions he ventured to draw from the facts presented by one of
the minor branches of a science yet in its infancy.
Nevertheless, the facts established by Professor Owen, in his Essay


on the Fossil Mammals of Australia, will prove of eminent import-
ance in deciding the epoch at which the separation of the continents
took place; for although the Professor?s zeal leads him sometimes to
give too much prominence to the science which he has made his own,
no one can doubt the correctness of the practical results he has arrived
at. The fact, that no remains of mammals of more perfect forms
than the marsupials were found among the numerous fossil specimens
from Australia that were submitted to his examination, shows that
disconnection must have taken place during an epoch in which the
marsupial was the only existing form of mammals in Australia, and
probably in Southern Asia also.
An inquiry into the distribution of the existing forms of mammals
throughout the Indian Archipelago, will throw some light on this
interesting point. Commencing with the species common in Asia
at the present day, and excluding those which may have been in-
troduced in a domesticated state, such as the horse, dog, kine,
and deer, the common brown monkey has penetrated farthest from
the continent of Asia, as it extends through Sumatra and the Trans-
Javan chain to the eastern extremity of Timor; but the thirty miles
of strait which separates this island from Letti seem to have stopped
its farther progress, for it is not found in a wild state in the Serw atty
Group. To the north, it extends through Borneo and Celebes, and
is found in a single island of the Moluccan seas ?Batchian. This
animal, from its habit of frequenting the hanks of rivers, is very
liable to be carried out to sea in the masses of drift which are some-
times detached from the banks by the - current, and its extensive dis-
tribution may be attributed to this cause; but such accidents are not
likely to happen to the more bulky pachyderms, nor are the frail
vessels of the natives calculated to transport them from island to
island; so that an inquiry into the distribution of these monster
mammals will best answer our purpose.
In Borneo, the elephant co-exists with the black bear (Ursus ma-
layanus), the Felis macroscelis, or Sumatran gigantic tiger-cat, and
so many varieties of the quadrumanes, that their introduction can
scarcely have been accidental. In Java, the rhinoceros, the royal
tiger, the wild ox of the Malayan Peninsula, and several varieties of
the smaller quadrumanes, still exist in the jungles. Sumatra and
the Peninsula contain every form of mammal found in Java and
Borneo, wuth the addition of the Tapir. These facts w r ould go to
prove that Java, Borneo, and Sumatra, continued attached to the
continent of Asia at a comparatively recent epoch. The common
brown monkey is the only member of the family of quadrumanes that


has reached Celebes and Bali, although the strait which separates the
latter island from Java is only two miles wide.
We will now trace the range of the Marsupialia from Australia
towards the continent of Asia. A variety of the kangaroo [Macropus),
two varieties of the opossum (. Didetphis ), one of which closely re-
sembles the ring-tailed opossum of New South Wales [Phalangista
Cookii ), one variety of the Dasyurus, the native cat of the colonists
of New South Wales and Port Essington; and one variety of the
small flying opossum have been found in the south-west part of New
Guinea ; and, singularly enough, the kangaroo has adapted himself
to the half-drowned nature of the country by inhabiting the trees.
A variety of the kangaroo still exists on the Arru Islands, which
seems to be identical with the small grey or ? brush? kangaroo,
found in the thickets throughout Australia. This is the ? Pilander?
of Valentyn. The name by which it is known in the Moluccas is
?pilandok.? In Ceram, the ring-tailed opossum, the native cat, the
flying opossum, and the little flying squirrel, all marsupials, and iden-
tical in appearance and habits with those which extend throughout
Australia, hold undisputed possession of the forest trees. The ring-
tailed opossum, which is the most numerous, as in New South Wales,
is a common pet throughout the Moluccas.* The Malayan name is
* The opossum, more especially the ring-tailed variety which inhabits trees,
is the most hardy of the Marsupials, that is to say its geographical range is
farther extended than that of any other pouched animal. The tree-opossum
and the native cat (Dasyurus macrourus ?) are the only varieties of this ancient
form of mammals that have not retreated before the European quadrupeds that
have been introduced into the southern districts of Australia; the mere pre-
sence of a flock of sheep, without their usual attendant, the dog, being suf-
cient to drive the kangaroos from the ? runs.? The tree-opossums are not
liable to be disturbed by any animal less agile than the monkey, as they are
never seen on the ground except when thrown out of the trees while fighting,
and then they scramble up again as fast as they can. The consequence is that
the tree-opossums now abound in the settled districts of Australia to an extent
that could not have happened previous to the arrival of Europeans, when the
aborigines kept down their numbers by dragging them out of their nests in the
hollows of trees to serve as food. Even the presence of the monkey is not fatal
to the tree opossum, as is evident from their co-existing in Timor and in parts
of South America. The musang or mungoose of the western parts of the Ar-
chipelago will prove fatal both to the tree-opossum and to the native cat
whenever he comes to be introduced to Australia, as he can enter the hollows
of trees and destroy them in their nests. The tree-opossums of Australia feed
on the leaves and tender shoots of the Eucalyptus. In the Moluccas, where
the Eucalyptus is rare, if found at all, the tree-opossum feeds on the leaves of
the Waringin and Lingoa trees, and on the outer bark of the Kanari. As the
two first exist in the Malay Peninsula, the latter under the name of Angsannah,


� kusu,? which has been latinized by the old Dutch naturalists into
Cuscus ; and I am sorry to see that this barbarism has been adopted
by modern zoologists. In Timor, the ring-tailed opossum is common
in the southern parts of the island. The only marsupial that has yet
been traced in Celebes is the flying opossum, but the zoology of this
island still remains to be explored. The zoological connection of
Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, with the continent of Asia, is as distinct
as that of Timor, Ceram, and New Guinea, with the continent of
Australia. Probably Celebes will be added to the Australian group ;
but until its zoological character is more fully ascertained, it will be
safer to allow it to remain neutral ground. The inferences to be
drawn from these facts must be self-evident.
Those who are acquainted with the process which is still going on
in the volanic bands of our immediate neighbourhood, will be un-
willing to entertain the opinion that the subterranean action which
has influenced tracts so remote from each other, can have been
exerted simultaneously. The only test that I have been able to
discover which is likely to prove applicable to the determination
of the comparative antiquity of the epochs of upheaval, is that which
must be familiar to those who have had ? transactions? in gold-dust
in this part of the world. Proficients in the art of ascertaining the
? touch? of specimens of native gold, by the colour that it leaves
when rubbed upon a smooth black pebble, assert that the com-
parative value of gold is determined by its age , which, I suppose,
means the comparative antiquity of. the period in which it has been
deposited in the alluvium. This test appears rather fanciful, but it
is certain that experienced ? touch-adars? can detect in a moment
the difference between Pahang and Bornean gold.
But this is a point of no immediate interest to physical geography,
although, if followed up by an assayist, it might be productive of
useful results in determining the course and progress of former
volcanic currents. It is by no means improbable that recent researches
the absence of the tree-opossum from this part of the Archipelago cannot be at-
tributed to want of suitable food. An examination of the limestone caverns in
the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, with a view to the discovery of fossil
remains of Mammals, might be attended with very interesting results, for although
the rock has been of sub-aqueous formation, as evidenced by the existence of
fossil marine shells, still the remains of Mammals may be found there, as well
as in the caverns of the same formation in Australia. Such an examination is
not necessary to show that Marsupials once existed on the continent of Asia,
that point having been decided by their appearance in the secondary beds of
Europe; still it would be a'matter of great interest to science were their
remains discovered in the southern parts of Asia.


in electricity, which have been pursued with such vigour for some
years past, may have developed laws which regulate the volcanic
currents, although the fact is yet unknown in these remote regions.
It is evident that the volcanic band has shown a determined obstinacy
in breaking across the primary ranges, and a tendency to run along
the outermost range when it had succeeded. I have already alluded
to a volcanic band which extends south from Japan through the
Bonin and Mariana or Ladrone Islands. In the absence of any
evidence to the contrary, I have long inclined to the opinion, that
this band, prolonged through the Carolines to New Ireland and the
New Hebrides, was the first line of attack; and that spurs extending
from the Solomon Group to the neighbourhood of Moreton Bay, and
from the New Hebrides through Norfolk and Howe?s Islands to the
coast near Sydney, produced the upheaval of the south-eastern part
of that continent, and broke through Bass?s Strait: that a branch from
this line precipitated itself directly on the coast of New Guinea, the
minor currents which extend to the north-west extreme of the Gulf
of Carpentaria, and along the Timorean area, being continuations:
and that a second branch broke off from the Ladrones through Egoi,
Yap, and the Pellew Islands to Celebes; but an examination of the
islands lying between the Ladrones and New Guinea, with the
express object of tracing the course of the volcanic band, will be
necessary before conclusions can be arrived at. From this point,
however, I can proceed with a tangible foundation. The distinct
character of mammalian forms existing in the countries lying on the
Great Asiatic Bank, show that Borneo, Java, and Sumatra, were
attached to the continent of Asia by unsubmerged ranges at a period
long subsequent to the separation of Australia, which would imply
that the curved band that passes from Formosa through the Philip-
pines, the Moluccas, Java, and Sumatra, is the most recent line of
volcanic action.

OF EUROPEAN COLONIZATION.

Java and the Moluccas?The English on the west coast of Sumatra?The
national character unadapted for cultivating tropical plantations with forced
labour ?Cultivation of spices in the Straits Settlements by means of im-

?Dr. Little?s theory of coral reefs as a cause of fever?Extension of Dutch
settlement on the Volcanic Bands.
The highly productive? character of the volcanic regions of the
Archipelago is strikingly illustrated by the fact, that during the
three first centuries of European occupation, the agricultural settle-
ments were formed exclusively on islands traversed by the volcanic
band; the small establishments kept up at Malacca, Macassar, and on
Timor, having been maintained solely for the purpose of coercing the
maritime trade. The early enterprizes of the Portuguese were not of
a nature calculated to result in permanent occupation. The first
successful ? plantation? was established in 1565 by the Spaniards in
the Philippines, where a happy mixture of force and priestly influence
brought the natives into a condition which rendered their labour
available, and the plantations have gradually extended through the
volcanic islands of the group to Mindanao, where they are progressing
as rapidly as the intolerant spirit of Islamism will permit in its
eastern stronghold. The Dutch commenced the same career about
half a century later in Java and the Moluccas, but force only was
employed in training the natives, except at Amboyna, where as
orderly, well-conducted, and perhaps as well-informed a community


as will be found in the more secluded parts of Europe, shows how
great a blessing the Dutch rule might have proved had native im-
provement met with equal encouragement elsewhere. As it is, were
the influence of the Netherlands power in the East to cease at this
moment, scarcely a trace of their stewardship would be discernible at
the commencement of the next century, except in Amboyna and the
neighbouring groups, where the conversion of entire communities
not only to the precepts, but also to the practices of Christianity, will
leave indelible traces of some better principle having been introduced
than that of sordid gain.
The English East India Company entered the field rather late in
the day, on the west coast of Sumatra. Their success was never very
brilliant, and when the course of European policy led to the transfer
of their Sumatran settlements to the Netherlands Government, they
were resigned without a sigh. Indeed our nation is not well calculated
either to form or maintain tropical agricultural settlements, at least
on the principles that have hitherto obtained. The spirit that leads
our countrymen to attack a Canadian or Australian forest, axe in
hand, revolts at the system vulgarly called ? nigger driving,? which
has been found necessary to successful agriculture among the Poly-
nesians of Java and the Philippines, as well as with the negroes of
Brazil and the southern states of North America. The eminent
success that has attended British colonial enterprize in those regions
where Anglo-Saxon perseverance can be brought to bear directly on
the clearing and cultivation of new lands, and the want of success
that ever met our attempts to carry on the cultivation of those tropical
plantations in the east and west whicli were obtained by conquest,
(for England has rarely attempted, and never succeeded, in initiating
a purely agricultural settlement within the tropics) are equally
attributable to that spirit which prompts the emigrant to prefer
winning his way by the strength of his own right hand, to urging
weaker races to labour that he may reap the fruit.
A sort of compromise has been effected in this settlement (Singapore)
by employing self-imported free labour in cultivating the soil; and
those enterprising planters who have been actively employed for years
past in converting the jungle of our island into spice gardens, pro-
bably never contemplated that they were initiating a system which is
calculated sooner or later to produce an entire change in the face of
nature throughout the ? Further East.? It must be familiar know-
ledge that the Indian Archipelago is now much more appreciated in
Europe than was the case twenty, or even ten years ago, when it was
almost a terra incognita, except to those whose commercial trans-


actions led them to take an interest in its affairs. The fact of a few
of its thousand islands affording the, principal means of support to
two European monarchies, is alone calculated to draw attention to
those territories which are still unoccupied. That the British will
take the lead in the advance that must happen some time or other,
may be inferred from the circumstance of their being the only nation
possessing territory in this part of the world capable of managing the
people of China, whose countless myriads present the most available
sources of labour.
I will close this Essay with a few remarks on ? Climatology,? a
branch of the science of Physical Geography intimately connected
with the subject of colonization, whether European or Asiatic. The
superior salubrity of countries of the primary formation is evidenced
by the absence of endemic disease throughout those regions of South-
eastern Asia and Australia, which partake exclusively of the primary
character ?a fact which those who have long resided in the Straits
Settlements, as well as those who have sought and found health
during a temporary sojourn, will have no difficulty in affirming, as far
as this neighbourhood is concerned. This peculiarity, for such it is
in countries situated under the Equator, is in a great degree attri-
butable to the nature of the soil, which rapidly absorbs the moisture,
and is free from those deleterious particles which render the smell of
the newly turned up ground in volcanic regions sickening, and almost
nauseous. Here, however, the fragrance that accompanies the breaking
up of new lands, is scarcely inferior to that which invigorates the
husbandman in Europe, and renders cultivation the most healthful
occupation that can be pursued.
The influence which this comparative salubrity exerts on the
character of European enterprise in this settlement, is sufficiently
apparent. We see little of that anxiety to snatch a hasty harvest,
which is so prominently displayed in those tropical regions where the
nature of the climate renders a protracted residence irksome, and even
dangerous to Europeans. That the comparative advantage we enjoy
in this important particular, coupled with the favourable nature of
our geographical position, will sooner or later make Singapore the
Constantinople of the Ear East, can scarcely be doubted. As a
general rule, the inland parts of primary regions, as far as known,
possess a healthful climate?in fact, the mode of life adopted by the
Jakuns of the Malay Peninsula, and by the native tribes of Australia,
could not be pursued with impunity in countries subject to febrile
influences. Mr. Gray, who crossed the peninsula from Malacca to
Pahang, and Mr. J. R. Logan, who has more recently explored the


uplands of Johore, suffered only from fatigue while traversing the
jungles; and Dr. Leichhardt crossed the Australian continent from
south to north without being detained for a single day by the illness
of a member of his party, except on one occasion, in which some of
his companions had been desperately wounded by the natives. It
was not until he reached Port Essington that he discovered for the
first time that malaria existed in Australia, and he expresses no small
amount of surprise thereat in the Lectures he delivered soon after his
return to Sydney :
? I will here mention that the sea-breeze at Victoria is extremely weak, and I
think that Captain Macarthur is right in attributing partly to this fact, the
fever, from which the garrison has several times severely suffered. It is ex-
tremely difficult to assign any other reason for the want of salubrity. The
country is undulating and hilly; the soil is sandy, and absorbs rapidly the
heaviest showers; the forest is open, and the mangrove thickets which cover
the mouths of the creeks, scarcely deserve the name of swamps, as they are
washed by the tide, and form no accumulation of vegetable matter which might
produce the miasma or malaria which generally renders tropical countries so
dangerous. After rain the air is fresh and pure, the ground dry, and a walk
most agreeable. Those localities which are freely exposed to the sea-breeze, as
for instance, Croker?s Island, are, according to Captain Macarthur, very
healthy.?? Lectures delivered by Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt, at the Sydney School of
Arts, the 18 th and 25 th days of August, 1846, p, 13,
The facts alluded to by Dr. Leichhardt caused much anxiety to
those interested in the settlement, and the writer was at one time
rather actively employed in searching out the cause of an insalubrity
which is not known elsewhere in Australia, by examining those spots
in the neighbouring seas which were remarkable for their unhealthiness.
The result will be found in the following extract. I must apologise
for so often quoting from my own literary productions, but the peculiar
nature of the inquiry, which was not calculated to prove attractive to
travellers who happened not to be personally interested, affords me no
other source of reference.
Land-locked Harbours. ?? There are certainly not many such ports in
the Indian Archipelago, but this very circumstance renders them the more
valuable, and the European powers which possess territory in this part of the
world, have repeatedly attempted to avail themselves of the advantages which
they present for the formation of naval arsenals. The inner harbour of Am-
boyna, the capital of the Moluccas, is, in every respect a perfect port, as far as
security and convenience for shipping is concerned, while the anchorage abreast
of the town, which is situated on the shores of the outer harbour, is exceedingly
unsafe ; indeed it is only near the fort, where a rocky bank extends a little
more than a cable?s length from the shore, that anchorage can be met with.
This has induced repeated attempts on the part of the Dutch, during the


last two centuries, to form arsenals on the shores of the inner harbour, but
they were on each occasion obliged to desist, owing to the excessive mortality
from fever that took place among the people employed. Strangers who visit
the Indian Archipelago are often surprised to find that the land-locked harbours
are neglected by the natives in favour of spots which present no palpable
advantages. The chief commercial settlement on the Island of Lombok, which
is resorted to by hundreds of ships, is situated upon an open roadstead, not
only exposed to the westerly gales, but subject at all times to a rolling swell,
which causes so dangerous a surf upon the beach, that communication is cut
off for days together. Yet there is a land-locked harbour within the distance
of a few miles, which affords perfectly secure anchorage, and is accessible to
ships of the largest size ; but here again the climate is so unhealthy that its
shores cannot be inhabited. The same rule applies to every spot similarly
situated thoughout the Indian Archipelago.
? What may be the causes of the insalubrity of these land-locked harbours
can only be judged by inference, for malaria does not admit of analysis. That
it is engendered by mangrove-swamps and by mud-banks exposed at low-water,
I have not the least doubt, but at the same time the action of strong tides must
tend to remove the impurities which create it, otherwise both Singapore and
Sourabaya would be unhealthy. I have reason to believe also, that the effluvia
produced by the action of a powerful sun on stagnant salt-water is highly
unfavourable to the constitution.
? In taking under review the circumstances of the various settlements in
these seas, it would appear that the most salubrious spots are those situated
upon narrow straits. The banks of navigable rivers above the reach of the salt-
water, hold the next rank. Open bays are by no means to be recommended ;
but land-locked harbours appear to be perfect repositories for all that can be
injurious to the constitution.
? The repeated failures that have attended the efforts of Europeans to form
settlements in this part of the world afford support to the above view of the
case. A secure harbour has always been a point of the first consideration, and
although this can often be obtained in a strait, which at the same time would
prove most convenient for merchant-shipping, still the superior facilities for
defence presented by a harbour with a single entrance have proved too attractive
to be overlooked. The English East India Company have twice attempted to
establish themselves upon the Andaman Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, at Port
Cornwallis, and at Port Chatham ; but the. settlements were in both cases
abandoned in consequence of the unhealthiness of the climate. More recently,
the Dutch made a similar effort with the like result at Triton Bay, on the south-
west coast of New Guinea, another land-locked harbour. It is singular that in
the last instance the settlement was about to be formed on a narrow strait,
near a spot which had been selected by the natives as the site of their principal
village; but the intention was abandoned, chiefly on account of the strength of
the tides. Indeed the natives of these countries appear to form the best se-
lections of spots adapted for occupation, although, as far as I could discover,
even the more intelligent of the Indian islanders had established no fixed rules,
but were rather guided in their choice by instinct than from conclusions drawn
from a course of reasoning. All the principal European settlements in the
Archipelago were originally native towns, with the exception of Batavia, the
capital of Java. This spot was selected on account of its being a favourable


position for a fortress, and at a convenient distance from the native capital,
which was situated some miles inland.?? Enterprise in Tropical Australia, p. 93,
et seq. * * ?
The removal of the settlement to the outer part of the harbour of
Port Essington was more than once contemplated, and would have
been carried out, had not the authorities been in constant expectation
of the receipt of orders to break up the establishment, from the first
year of its existence?in fact, the interest in the settlement had sub-
sided with the retirement of the minister under whose auspices it had
been founded. Had the slightest encouragement or even approval
been afforded by the cotton manufacturers of Manchester and Glasgow,
they would not now have been solely dependent on foreigners for
their supplies of the raw material ; at least the results of the experi-
ments in tropical agriculture carried on at Port Essington authorise
this conclusion. A little agitation in the manufacturing districts
would probably have been responded to, but support to colonial enter-
prise should be spontaneous, otherwise it may fail when most needed.
I have entered into this subject rather more fully than I had intended,
as Port Essington was the first European settlement founded on
primary formations within the tropics for purely agricultural purposes,
and it will probably be the last?at least, until the Anglo-Australians
have had time to spread to the north coast, when the textile produce,
whether wool or cotton, will probably be required for their own
manufactories in the south.
If we may judge from the robust appearance of the mountaineers
of Timor, Ceram, and Celebes, the climate of the higher regions of
areas of upheaval is equal to that of the primary ranges. Indeed, I
should be inclined to give the preference to the uplands of Timor,
where the character of the country and its vegetation is so open and
Australian as to induce a belief that one is breathing the mountain
air of one of the Southern ranges. The coasts of upheaved tracts
possess, however, a very doubtful character, those of Timor, especially,
being notoriously insalubrious. An interesting essay on ?Coral
Reefs as a Cause of Fever,?* appeared in earlier numbers of this
Journal, and met with a considerable amount of opposition in various
quarters. It is less difficult to demolish than to construct a theory,
and such is the perversity of human nature, that the destroyers some-
times obtain the greater credit. If the author will consent to review

his theory, making it applicable only to Fringing Reefs, in which the
process of upheaval is constantly presenting fresh surfaces of living
coral to be destroyed by the atmosphere, and discarding A.toll or
Barrier Reefs, which are the characteristics of areas of subsidence,
he will furnish a highly valuable contribution to medical topography,
without incurring the liability of being pestered by opposition, at
least on the part of those who have had the advantage of practical
experience.
It will scarcely be necessary to enter into particulars concerning
the climatology of the volcanic region. The Netherlands Government,
by the recent acquisition of the Portuguese settlements on Solor and
Plores, and by the establishment of what is intended to be a permanent
settlement on the north side of the Great Eastern Peninsula of New
Guinea, have now exclusive possession of all the countries of the
Archipelago, south of the equator, which are traversed by volcanic
bands. Some sixteen years ago I recorded expressions of regret that
England had relinquished possession of the settlements in the Archi-
pelago that had been captured during the last war. Subsequent
experience, more especially a closer acquaintance with the character
of the British emigrant as displayed in the southern colonies, has led
me to qualify this opinion very materially. Each nation that has
established itself in this part of the world is evidently pursuing the
career for which it is best adapted. An Englishman would be as much
out of his element in directing the forced labour of Java or the Philip-
pines, as a Spanish Corregidor or a Dutch Opziener would be, if set
to drive-in a herd of wild cattle from the ? bush,? or to fell an iron-
barked Eucalyptus with a broad axe.
[The coloured map which accompanies this Essay, is intended chiefly to
illustrate the productive character of the countries noticed; and although the
scale is small, it has been found sufficient to admit of the several formations
being generally defined. There are certain spots, however, where the primary
ranges have been tilted, and where granite in its native state overlies areas of
upheaval, which can only be coloured into maps on a larger scale. For example,
the south-eastern extremities of the Anara and central Bornean ranges, and also
the southern extremes of the primary ranges of Celebes, have been upheaved
very considerably. These facts are important, as in the three latter instances
the upheaval has exposed coal-beds, so that the south-eastern extremity of
the Indo-Chinese Peninsula may prove to be similarly productive. The primary
formations intermingle with, or overlie the upheaved areas in Borneo, Timor,
and Celebes, but the granite is more commonly met with in the transmuted
form of eruptive rock. I purpose embodying the materials I have collected
daring the last twenty-four years in a physical map on a large scale, as soon as
a favourable opportunity occurs for publishing ; but travellers who have
