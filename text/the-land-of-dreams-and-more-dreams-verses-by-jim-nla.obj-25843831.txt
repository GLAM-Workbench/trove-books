When the sun rose early,
snowdrop slumbers sound
In a dell of flowers.
Watch him sleep the whole day

He wHI sleep the clock around
Through sunshine and showers.
Till their leaves grow curly,
ies dance on roses white,
Pink and purple flowers,
While he sleeps from morn till night
Through the sunlit hours.

Sire, s
3Jh& Hand of tDxecum
QN Cap and Bells the gentle king
Turned his blue eyes mild,
"Jester, tell me how to sing
A song to please a child."
"Sire, can you see beneath the moon,
A shimmering fairy ring,
Where wee feet twinkle to the tune
That chirping crickets sing?
Whose jewelled lantern gleams,
Sailed by children who wish to float
"Where puppies play on violins?
Pussies sing, 'Three Blind Mice.'
With honey cakes in bright blue tins
"Sire, have you seen the lady fair
And lovely as the day,
Who takes the hands of children there
To gather nuts and may,
With merry smile and golden hair
And queen of all the fay?"
To the jester turned the king
His careworn face and smiled;
"O let me listen, while you sing
Beside this little child."

emerald pool,
Where swift shining silent bream glide;
The pixies run out from the green bull-
frogs' school
On amber weed saddles to still surface
cool
On those silvery breams' backs they
ride.
Ripples widen and run to the smooth
shining sands;
Like bubbles on them pixies leap,
And land on the shore where their tiny
white hands
Cling to the willow trees slender green
strands
Of hair as she swings them to sleep.
Her graceful head bends to the mirror-
like stream
And closes each twinkling eye
With songs softly sung from the night
winds. They dream
Of rose-coloured castles, and sands pink
and cream,
Reflections from sunset and sky.
Reflections dim slowly when twilight
descends
And gnats lightly dance in the breeze;
On stream and pool, paling, dark
shadow extends
And winds softly whisper, where willow
tree bends,

Leaping to the floor past the open door
Rushed that cheese chewing choo.
" 'Don't chuckle, you choo. You'll cry, 'B
And go down upon your knees;
When I catch you. You'll certainly rue
The night you nibbled the cheese.'
’Y’HE pouring rain smacks the window pane
And I don't know what to do.
"Mummy, please do tell me of the choo
Who ran through Woolloomooloo."
"On the kitchen shelf a tiny elf
Ran lightly round a cheese.
He said, 'You choo, when I find you
I'll give you such a squeeze.'
"When that choo caught sight of the elfin sprite
It's bubbly eyes turned blue;
" 'Don't chuckle, you choo. You'll cry, 'Boo
And go down upon your knees;
hoo,'


Woolloomooloo that choo ran through " .

And the moon man grinned with
delight. ■ I
"The long hair white of the elfin mite
Floated in the wild wet breeze. '
He chased the choo through Woolloo-
Till the choo began to sneeze.

"He sneezed away as the light of day
Appeared faintly on the breeze.
"Cold was the night when the elfin
sprite
Chased the chuckling choo.
And vanished quite from the wild
sprite's sight
On nimble feet through the dusky
street
And no more nibbled the cheese."
Flew the two through Woolloomoo-
loo.
The window pane clears after rain,
So I'll go where the cold cows moo;
"He chased the choo with goggle eyes "Thanks, Mummy dear, for the story
blue queer
In the man in the moon's pale light; Qf the nibbling cheese choo choo."

J'M not speaking to Molly Flynn. "O, never mind," says Molly Flynn,
When both ropes hit my feet, "I couldn't watch my feet
She said I should not have stayed in, When that pup with an inane grin
And that I was a cheat,
Came back along the street,
When "Floppy Creature" sneaked the And the canary round did spin
And called the object, 'Sweet'."
And ran across the street.
It is not like a dog at all
I forgave her when those words I heard;
She's my best friend again.
But a black rug with feet
I'm seeking a more charming word
For my own than 'inane';

Till dew drops winlc likt yes,
-m the beetle droi
From misty twilight
slender beams of airy gold On shining back and buzzing wings
They leap and fly away
The sunlit children glide,
To where the raindrops icy cold To where the chirping cricket sings
On swaying petals ride. And dance till dawn of day.
And weaving strands of slender beams To fairy rings where moonbeams lie,
Into a cloth of light; And elves dance in the dew,
They draw it through the rippling On the beetle's back I'd like to fly

And take you with me, too.
Till wave tips sparkle white;
Then lay it on the meadow brown
And charm the beetle droning down,

Lilies opened, broad leaves stirred;
The fairy of the lake
Said, "Spirit," and the Spirit heard,
"Punish this presumptious bird
Who dared my fish to take."
The bush bunyip a hot breath blew
And red gold flames leaped high
From the fish and, racing through
The tail trees, scorched those birds of
blue
And left the sea bed dry.
IN a shallow inland sea, When crackling leaves were no more
Across the sandy floor, heard
Small fish, skimming speedily, And Y ellow la Y the P la!n '
Were caught and swallowed greedily Each bird said ' ’ ,You are absurd!
I never saw so brown a bird,"
And laughed and laughed again.
blue birds from the shore.
To a lily covered lake
One kingfisher came,
Saw the edge of one leaf shake,
Dived and carried from the lake
A fish like golden flame.
