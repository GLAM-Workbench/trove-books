ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING.
A STATUE TO BE ERECTED.
THE Public Meeting held in the Town-hall, on Friday
evening, the 29th of May, under the presidency of His
Excellency the Governor, to promote the movement for the
erection of a Statue in Melbourne of the late General Gordon
was, from every point of view, a perfect success. The attend-
ance was immense. The sitting accommodation in the body
of the hall was not sufficient, very many persons having to
stand, and the galleries were filled, chiefly by ladies. About
4,000 persons must have been present. It was also a unani-
mous, sympathetic, and enthusiastic audience. The oratory
was all that could have been desired by the audience, and the
audience was such a one as the orators must have felt privileged
to address. His Excellency arrived in the hall shortly before
8 o?clock, by which time nearly every seat was occupied. He,
of course, went on to the platform. Lady Loch entered the
gallery almost simultaneously, with a party of ladies comprising
Lady Clarke, Lady Lymington, Lady Nicolson, Mrs. Moor-
house, the Mayoress, and Mrs. E. G. Fitzgibbon. It was
noticed that Lady Loch and her party wore mourning for
Gordon, as did also nearly every lady in the galleries. In the
body of the hall also, where there were several ladies, black
was decidedly the prevailing colour in their costumes. A
trophy of flags was arranged in front of the great organ, crossed
in chevron by a broad band of crape. A small minority of the
ladies in the galleries were in evening dress. Amongst the
gentlemen on the platform were noticed?Lord Lymington,
M.P.; Lord Castlerosse, A.D.C.; the Bishop of Melbourne ;
Mr. Berry, Chief Secretary; Sir William Clarke, M.L.C.;
Sir Arthur Nicolson, Sir George Verdon, SirChas. MacMahon,
M.L.A.; Messrs. Officer and Derham, M.L.A.?s ; Mr. W. A.
Brahe, German consul; M. Dillon, French- consul; Major-
General Downes, R.A.; Colonel Templeton, Majors Bull and
Goldstein ; Surgeon-majors Ryan, Gray, Embling, and Crook;.


Lieutenant Rashleigh, the Mayors of Melbourne, Brunswick,
and Ballarat; Councillors Bowen, Leonard, Wilks, levers and
Garton, of Melbourne; the Rev. Canons Handfield and Chase;
the Rev. J. C. Symons and J. H. O?Connor; Messrs. J. L.
Purves, E. Langton, G. H. Jenkins, James M'Kean, E. G.
Pitzgibbon, F. Wilkinson, E. S. Parkes, J. S. Butters, D. Blair,
B. Douglass, R. S. Bradley, J. J. Kelley, J. M, Bruce; Pro-
fessors Halford, Andrew, Morris, and Elkington; Dr. R.
Robertson, Dr. Thomas Black, Dr. Cutts, Dr. Moloney,
Superintendent Sadlier, W. K. Thompson, S. J. Payne, J.
Whiting, R. G. Benson, W. levers, sen., N. S. Marks, W.
Smithers Gadd, F. R. Godfrey, Howard Willoughby (hon.
secretary), and Mr. J. Lake (assistant secretary.) Mr. David
Lee (the city organist) presided at the organ and played a
selection of national and patriotic airs before the proceedings
commenced. The hall was decorated with flags, and a military
aspect was given to the meeting by a large number of
officers and privates in the defence force, who, in their
uniforms, were seated on the platform and in the orchestra.
When the Governor appeared on the platform, he had a
hearty reception. The first speaker was the Mayor of
Melbourne, who mentioned that the meeting was called to
consider the desirableness of erecting a statue to the late
General Gordon. All references to the proposed statue made
by the Mayor or by subsequent speakers were applauded.
Mr. Carter was followed by Mr. J. Lake, Assistant Secretary
of the Memorial Committee, who mentioned that they had
�630 in hand, irrespective of promised subscriptions not
actually received, and that from �"2,500 to �3,000 would be
required to erect a statue worthy of the hero and the city.
His Excellency the Governor then spoke, and was warmly
received. His panegyric of his old comrade and friend,
Gordon, greatly interested and pleased the audience. When
speaking of the hero?s departure for Khartoum, his Excellency
was visibly agitated. The Mayor proposed the first
resolution, which deplored the death of Gordon, and expressed
admiration of his noble life. He regretted the absence,
through illness, of the Premier, who was to have proposed
this motion, and went on to state how delighted he was
to see so many ladies present, and what an inspiriting effect
their presence had on the sterner sex. Mr. Carter, in fact,
made one of the most poetical addresses of the evening.
Lord Lymington, M.P., seconded the resolution, and speedily
got on the best possible terms with his audience. He was,
he said, greatly impressed by the spectacle of this high-
spirited people mourning for a national hero. There was
great cheering here, and it became still more energetic when


he spoke of ? the greatest empire in the world.? When his
lordship spoke of ?the shame of Gordon?s death,? the
audience unmistakeably expressed its approval of the phrase.
The resolution was also spoken to by Major-General Downes,
an old schoolfellow of Gordon?s, whose speech also gave great
pleasure to the meeting. He related a few new anecdotes of
the deceased hero, and these were listened to with greedy
attention. After the resolution had been carried, Mr. David
Lee played the ?Dead March in Saul? on the organ, the
audience all standing. The effect of this solemn, grand, and
mournful air, played under such circumstances before a vast
audience, which expressed in its apparel, and otherwise in its
aspect, its sense of a great loss sustained, was very
impressive.
The next resolution was proposed by the Bishop of Melbourne,
and declared that a statue of Gordon ought to be erected. Dr.
Moorhouse, of course, was enthusiastically received, and his
?eloquent speech, delivered in his well-known, clear, ringing
voice, was the chief feature of the meeting. It may be here
stated that, owing to the hall being well filled, it was, from an
acoustic point of view, perfection. The bishop?s eulogy of
Gordon was powerful and stirring. Gordon, he thinks, is a
modern Bayard, and his comparison of the hero with other
?characters of ancient and modern times was intensely inter-
esting. This resolution was seconded by Mr. Berry, whose
voice was not in such good order as usual. Referring to the
preceding speeches, Mr. Berry stated that all present would
recollect this meeting to their dying day. M. Dillon (French
consul) supported the resolution, and was well received. He
mentioned that he had met Gordon in 1870. The resolution
having been passed, the next was proposed by Mr. J. L. Purves.
It declared that the subscription to the Gordon Memorial
ought to be of a national character. Mr. Purves stated that
he had been asked to propose the resolution because he was
an Australian native. Mr. B. Douglass, who seconded the
motion, was applauded when he said that he would exert his
influence to get subscriptions to the fund from working men.
The resolution was passed, as was also a vote of thanks to
the Governor, pioposed by Sir W. Clarke. In acknowledging
the vote His Excellency said that several letters of apology
from persons unable to be present had been received.
When His Excellency took the chair at 8 o?clock,
The Mayor, who was received with applause, said, ?May it
please your Excellency and Ladies and Gentlemen, ?I have
convened this meeting at the request of Sir William Clarke


and other citizens who are desirous of seeing a statue erected
in this city to the memory of General Charles George Gordon,
(Cheers.) My-pleasure in doing so has been greatly enhanced
by the fact that His Excellency the Governor has been good
enough to consent to take my place, and preside on this
occasion?(cheers)- ?and being a personal friend of the late
General Gordon, it is, I think, most appropriate that he should
do so. (Cheers.) I merely wish further to say that although
this meeting has been convened to give an opportunity to
persons who desire to see a statue erected to the memory of
the hero we so much admire, it will give me equal pleasure to
convene another meeting to enable you to promote any other
memorial you may please in this city. (Cheers.) I have been
requested by the committee to ask the secretary to read a
short progress account of their actions from the time ,they
commenced their operations.
Mr. J. Lake, the assistant-secretary to the committee, then
read the following report:?
? On the receipt of the intelligence of the death of General
Gordon a general desire was expressed in Melbourne that the
great services of that noble and heroic leader should be worthily
commemorated in this colony.
? Subscriptions towards a statue or picture were voluntarily
sent in. When they began to cease, the subscribers met
together to consider the position, and finding that the field had
been left to them, they resolved to organise and to make a wide
appeal to the public for further aid and support.
? A committee was formed, with power to add to its number.
It now has over �630 in hand, irrespective of further large
promises. The sum of �2,500 to �3,000 is required to erect a
statue in the city of Melbourne worthy of the hero and of the
city and colony.
? Since its commencement three weeks ago, the committee
has applied itself diligently to its task. It has obtained the
co-operation of leading citizens, representing both sides of
politics and all races and creeds. During the past week it has
issued 3,000 copies of the statement of its cause, which is
to-night in your hands, together with 3,000 subscription lists.
These have been posted to every State school head teacher
in the colony, to every mayor, every town clerk, every shire
president, and every shire secretary in the colony.
? The committee has also initiated arrangements for a
systematic canvass of the whole city and suburbs, and for an
appeal to all classes of the community.


? But, as a preliminary, it now asks the citizens of Melbourne
to endorse the cause at this mass meeting in their own Town
Hall, and the hope is confidently entertained that to-night?s
great demonstration will encourage the promoters to proceed
on their way.?
His Excellency, who, on rising, was received with great
applause, said :?Mr. Mayor, Ladies, and Gentlemen, ?I have
never attended a public meeting with the objects of which
I have felt a deeper sympathy, or in which I take a greater
interest, than the one which brings us here together to-night.
(Cheers.) I look upon this great representative gathering as
meaning that all who are here present to-night desire to record
their sense of the great services performed by General Gordon.
(Cheers.) There are, as you are aware, many publications
issued which have given detailed accounts of his history and
past career, and it therefore would be wasting your time if
I entered into any details with respect to them. But as an old
comrade and friend of General Gordon ?(cheers) ?l cannot pass
on without a brief glance backward at some portions of his
glorious life. (Cheers.) I first knew General Gordon a great
number of years ago in China. He was then but a subaltern
of Engineers, and it was before his name had become a
household word throughout that country and throughout
England as the Commander of the Ever-victorious Army.
(Cheers.) But from that date up to the time of his going to
Khartoum we were ever fast friends. (Cheers.) There was
a charm that it was impossible to describe about his manner
and in his conversation, but upon looking back to it since his
death to endeavour to arrive at some conclusion as to the
cause of that charm, I feel it is due to the peculiar modesty of
his character, and to the purity of his thoughts. (Loud
applause.) As illustrative of the peculiar modesty of his
character, perhaps I may be permitted to recite an account
that was given to me by the late Sir Frederick Bruce, who
was our first Ambassador at Pekin, and the story he then told
me was afterwards confirmed by Gordon himself to me. It
was after the successful suppression of the Taiping rebellion,
which was due, as you are all aware, to General Gordon?s
great skill and ability, that the Chinese Government were
exceedingly desirous to mark their sense of his great services
by bestowing upon him a very large pecuniary reward. He
had been created a Mandarin of the highest class of the
empire, so as to give him the requisite influence in the
command of the army, but he persistently declined to receive


any payment beyond the ordinary payment that was allowed
to an Engineer officer of that class. (Cheers.) When the
Chinese Government wished to give him this large sum of
money, he declined to accept it, but they, feeling how deeply
indebted they were to him for his services, applied to Sir
Frederick Bruce, the Ambassador, to use his influence with
Gordon to induce him, if possible, to accept it, but in the
event of his declining it, to, at all events, induce him to go to
Pekin to confer with the Government with respect to the
affairs of China. With regard to the last proposal he
consented, and he was on the point of starting from Shanghai
when the mail from the North arrived with the news that
a reception was being prepared for him that had never been
accorded to anyone but an Emperor himself. As soon as
Gordon heard of it, he called a boat alongside the steamer, had
his portmanteau put into it, and went off to the shore, sending a
message to the Government that, hearing that this reception
was being prepared for him, it was far greater than anything
he deserved, and he would not go to Pekin. The result,
however, was that a gold medal was presented to him, with an
inscription upon it from the Empress Regent and the
Government, expressing their great sense of the services he
performed to the empire. He placed some store by this
medal, as it was a record of his life in China, but he put
it away with his other medals and orders. Some years
afterwards his sister, who took greater interest in his medals
and orders than he did himself, missing this medal, asked him
what had become of it. He replied that he wished to send
some money to the poor people of Lancashire, that he had sent
all the money he had, and wishing to send more, he had sent
this gold medal to be melted down. (Loud cheers.) And
he added, that ? It served a much more useful purpose than if
I had worn it.? (Loud cheers.) There are numerous similar
traits that might be recited, both of his generosity and his
modesty, many of which, doubtless, you are well acquainted
with. You are all aware of the great services he has
performed in the council chamber, in the battle-field, by the
sick men?s beds, in his own room, surrounded by the waifs
and strays collected from the streets, speaking to them,
teaching them, raising and endeavouring to raise their
intelligence and their minds to higher aims, sympathising
with them in their efforts to live an honest life, and showing
them how to live so as to respect themselves and strive
for something higher and better. (Cheers.) Besides the
services he performed to China, you are aware of his services
to suffering humanity while he was Governor-General of
the Soudan, in his efforts to put down slavery. You are


also aware of the great danger he ran in the mission which
he undertook after he was Governor-General of the Soudan,
when he went to Abyssinia to endeavour to settle the difficulty
between Egypt and that country. You are acquainted with
his life at Gravesend; you are aware that he went to India,
and from thence again to China, where he again did signal
service to that country by preventing them going to war with
Russia. These services were followed by what we all know
of?his mission to Khartoum, when he undertook to save the
garrison of that city, and to save the garrisons of Sennaar and
Kassala and other places; but alas !we all know the end.
It is extraordinary to think how Gordon, in those weeks
of great anxiety which he must have undergone, in hourly
danger of his life, hourly in anticipation of treachery, could
have sat down quietly and have written those last lines
of farewell, and those long diaries. I rejoice to think that the
whole of those voluminous and interesting diaries have arrived
safely in England, and I trust it may not be long before they
are published. (Cheers.) Gordon?s life is a unique life in the
history of mankind. (Hear, hear.) We find him one of the
highest Mandarins in the exclusive empire of China, exercising
great influence over the governing and, indeed, all classes
in that country ; we find him greatly esteemed by the
Mohammedans, and I believe it was perfectly true that
he was prayed for at Mecca, and that he had the
right of entering the holy places of the Holy Land
without the firman usually necessary to be obtained from the
Sultan. We know how Gordon was esteemed throughout the
world, and it is to do honour to the memory of this great man
that this vast gathering has assembled here to night.
(Cheers.) It will shortly be proposed that a statue shall be
erected to his memory, and I sincerely trust it will be such a
statue as will reflect to the fullest extent our feelings of
admiration for the noble character of Gordon. (Cheers.)
Round the pedestal of the statue we shall have well-executed
bas-reliefs descriptive of the most important actions of his life
?(cheers) ?-and among these none will deserve higher
prominence or greater consideration than that which will show
him in his room at Gravesend, tending and caring for the
poor boys of that town. (Cheers.) I should like to see on
the statue an inscription describing his work amongst them,
and I trust that, if not immediately, at no distant period we
shall see another inscription placed below that, to say that
this bright example?this citizen of the world, who had none
of this world?s wealth, and yet gave his whole to the last mite
to alleviate sickness and distress?that his example has not
been lost upon this great colony, but that in this city of


Melbourne a building will be erected where we may carry no
similar work to that which Gordon had so much at heart.
(Loud cheers.) Thus, the statue, with its bas-reliefs, and this
building to which I have referred, will unitedly represent the
memory of a character which combined infinite modesty,
unsurpassed moral strength, undaunted courage, with a
self-denying compassion, and the loving tenderness of a
woman. (Loud and prolonged applause.)
The Mayor was called upon to propose the first resolution.
He said, ?I am exceedingly sorry that the illness of the
Premier has prevented him from attending this meeting and
submitting this resolution. (Hear, hear.) I regret it for Mr.
Service?s sake, because I am sure it would have given him
great pleasure to be here to-night to assist us in our endeavours
to do honour to the memory of a truly great and good man.
(Cheers.) Before addressing myself to the resolution, allow
me to express to the committee I think I may say your thanks
as well as my own, for the pleasing innovation they have
made on our usual custom by reserving the balconies for the
ladies. (Cheers.) When we remember how in all ages man
has been prompted and inspired to burning thoughts and
chivalrous action by woman, it seems to me that on an
occasion like this, when we of the sterner sex have met to do
honour to ourselves by honouring the illustrious dead, the
approving presence of the mothers and daughters of the city
is ?as perfect music set to noble words.? (Loud cheers.)
The resolution which has been placed in my hands reads as
follows:
?That this meeting deplores the death of the late General
Gordon at the termination of his heroic defence of
Khartoum ; that it records its admiration of his noble
life, and its consciousness of the great services
rendered by him both to the British Empire and the
cause of humanity.?
It is impossible, in the few moments which I shall occupy,
to do justice to the life of this heroic man during 30 years?
from the time when he first fought in the trenches in the
Crimea to his glorious death at the fall of Khartoum. (Hear,
hear.) Where is the man or woman who does not admire the
noble hero of Khartoum ? (Hear, hear.) If unselfish heroism
is deserving of admiration, then we cannot withhold our
admiration from the gallant Gordon. (Cheers.) You all
know that he rendered great services to the British Empire,
and it will be needless for me to go into any details with


regard to them. If you wish to know one of the services
which he specially rendered, you will find it in the words of
a British Minister, who wrote home of him from China?? His
disinterestedness has elevated our national character in the
eyes of the Chinese.? (Loud cheers.) I take it that no man
renders a greater service to his country than he who elevates
its character in the opinions of surrounding nations. (Cheers.)
There is something more to admire in Gordon than his intrepid
bravery. (Hear, hear.) In this prosaic, utilitarian age, when
most of us are looking after what we call the main chance?
(laughter)?are seeking how to get richer and how to get more
honours, it is refreshing to find a man in the world such as
Gordon, and it causes us to thank God for sending him as an
example to us to remember that there is something besides
mere material acquisitions. (Hear, hear.) Gordon?s life in
the present materialistic age is just as a bright star seen
through a rift in the sombre clouds on a dark night, all the
more brilliant because of the surrounding darkness, telling us
that there is light behind the darkness. I say, then, that even
thus the presence of a man like Gordon in a darkened world?
for we are a mercenary world at the present time, if we ever
were?(cheers) ?the presence of a man who despised wealth,
who contemned honours, and merely endeavoured to do one
thing, and that thing his duty?l say that he was the ? little
star in the rift? indeed. (Cheers.) Then His Excellency has
alluded to Gordon?s life at Gravesend. Shall we go there
for a moment ? Shall we see that almshouse, hospital, and
school all combined in one ? Shall we see him going out
into the streets and bringing in the little ragged boys from the
gutters, teaching them, attending to them, clothing them, and
calling them his ?kings?? I say that if that does not excite our
admiration we are incapable of the feeling. (Cheers.) It was
his wondrous sympathy, his boundless love, that enabled him to
rule not only savages, but caused little children to love him as
their father. I now come to the last point in my text ?that
we are to deplore his death. Now Gordon himself wrote a
very remarkable sentiment, which I will read :?? I, for one,
do not care about being lamented after death.? He did not
even wish to receive honours after he was dead. At all events,
as he said, he did not care about it. However, happily for us,
he cannot now debar us from the privilege of expressing our
grief at his loss. (Cheers.) When the the news came, is it
not a fact, that the eyes of our women were dimmed with tears,
and that the blood of our men coursed more rapidly through
their veins and longed for vengeance ? Is that not a fact ?
Do we not all feel it here ? (Cheers.) And now that he has
gone, as the Psalmist sings, ? to the land where all things are


forgotten,? is it not right that he should be remembered here?
Will not the silent marble eloquently speak to thousands yet
unborn, and tell, or rather lead to the telling, of the life of him
to whom I think we may appropriately apply those lines which
were penned by Tennyson with reference to the late Prince
Consort, where he says ;
? Indeed, he seems to me
Scarce other than my king?s ideal knight,
Who reverenced his conscience as his king,
Whose glory was redressing human wrong.?
(Cheers.) And would not the words which Gordon wrote
when he left Cairo for his journey to Khartoum be an
appropriate inscription for the monument about to be raised
to his memory ? He said?? I go up alone with the infinite
Almighty God to direct and guide me, and it is my glory to
so trust Him as to fear nothing, and to feel sure of success.?
(Cheers.) I have great pleasure in moving the resolution
I have read. (Cheers.)
His Excellency then called upon Lord Lymington to
second the resolution.
Lord Lymington said he could scarcely find words wherein
to adequately express the feelings with which he was inspired
by the great assembly which confronted him. It gave him a
real pleasure to subscribe to this memorial, and thereby
associate himself with the great and, he could certainly say,
very popular movement in Australia. (Cheers.) He knew of no
spectacle more touching or more impressive than the spectacle
of a high spirited people mourning for a national hero. (Cheers.)
He was glad that in this country at least the motives which
actuated this assembly sought no support and appealed for no
stimulus to the embittered language of English party politics.
(Cheers.) They were collected there that evening as fellow-
countrymen of a great empire?he might venture to say of the
greatest empire in the world ?(loud cheers) ?and in order to
commemorate the services of one of her noblest and most
distinguished soldiers. They were there to discuss means of
erecting some monument which would hand down to posterity
the life of a man who had shown that the golden qualities of
English chivalry were not a mere pasan and recollection of the
past, but whose career in China and in Egypt had dignified
the character of the English name, and had maintained the
honour of the English reputation. (Cheers.) While he felt
all this most keenly, he could not help feeling that this meeting


appealed to him with a certain present political significance-
At a time when various schemes were being devised to knit
more closely the mother country and her colonial empire,
nothing could prove more eloquently than did that meeting
how strong and yet how tender was the bond that united the
subjects of the Queen. (Loud applause.) They shared with
the people of England in their admiration and pride in the life
and career of General Gordon, and they sympathised with them
in the sorrow, and, he might say, in the shame of his death.
(Loud and continued applause.) It had been said by a great
Australian author, and he felt it keenly on this occasion,
that?
? ? Australia is the land of the dawning ;
Robed in the mists of the morning,
Her future looms vague and gigantic.?
If their forefathers had handed down to them the traditions of
the great men and great careers of the past, England was
looking to her Australian sons, and he did not think she would
look in vain, to see that those traditions were maintained and
kept alive, so that the development of this great empire might
mean the development of freedom and of liberty?(cheers)?
and that while she grew ancient she might never cease to
remain vigorous. His Excellency had touched with rare
ability upon various incidents in the unique life of the departed
hero, but a few words might well be said in connexion with
his private life. Amid all the halo of romance, of wonder, and
of admiration that clustered round his military career, and his
disregard of all the motives and purposes which actuated most
men, they were apt to forget the wondrously noble life he led
at Gravesend. Between the years 1865 and 1871, General
Gordon devoted himself to the cause of the poor. He did not
say that that in itself was remarkable. There were many
men who were charitable, and many who were kind-hearted;
but Gordon devoted himself not to the patronage of the poor,
for the poor had many patrons ?but to the assistance and the
friendship of the poor. (Cheers.) He had given to posterity
an example not only of a great and distinguished soldier, but
of a high Christian gentleman. (Cheers.) He was a proof
that not only might an Englishman serve his Queen and his
country with determination and regard, but?and he was
speaking now to those who took a pride and glory in being
democratic, and as one who himself believed in the future of
democracy?he had shown at the same time that he could
retain in the tenderest degree the higher character of a Chris-
tian, in its widest and its noblest sense, which, after all,
embodied the highest and the purest form of democracy that
had ever yet been vouchsafed to man. (Cheers.)


Major-General Downes said when he was asked to take
part in the meeting his first impulse was to refuse, as he
had a dislike to public speaking, but suddenly the thought
flashed across his mind?what would Gordon, whom he con-
sidered to be one of the most unselfish men that ever breathed,
have done ? There was but one answer, and he had an
additional reason for appearing, in the fact that General
Gordon and himself were old schoolfellows. (Cheers.) His
acquaintance with General Gordon began in 1848 at the
Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, as cadets. Not only
were they schoolfellows, but he was proud to say that their
friendship was great, as they were schoolboy chums together,
and as long as they had met they had always kept up a firm
friendship. (Loud cheers.) He not only had the sincerest
respect and admiration for General Gordon, but he had also
feelings of the deepest affection for his lamented friend,
Charlie Gordon. (Loud cheers.) He would relate two
anecdotes, which were illustrative of Gordon?s character, but
which were not to be found in print. When serving in
the Crimea, after Sebastopol had fallen as regards the south
side, General Gordon, then Lieutenant in the Engineers, with
two brother officers, was quartered in a house on the south
side, superintending the mining operations by which the docks
of Sebastopol were to be utterly destroyed. The house was
shelled by the enemy one evening, and a shell burst into the
room in which Gordon and his fellow officers were sleeping.
The two officers rushed out of the house after the shell
had burst, and on going back, expecting to find Gordon killed,
saw that he was still in bed. When questioned as to why he
had not moved, he asked, ? What was the good ; the shell has
burst; why should I move ?? (Cheers and laughter.) This
illustrated Gordon?s fearlessness under danger, and another
anecdote showed his fixed determination to acquire knowledge.
In 1857 Gordon was employed as Private Secretary to Sir
Harry Jones, who was then Governor of the Sandhurst
Military College, and when he travelled to London, used to
travel in the second or third class carriage. He asked
General Gordon what his object was, and Gordon replied in
the following words:?
? There is no man living who does not in some respect
know more than I do, and I go into these carriages, and,
meeting these men, I soon find out what is the point upon
which their knowledge is superior to mine, and then I set to
work to pick their brains.?


(Cheers.) He felt the greatest satisfaction as a comparative
stranger in the colony to assist in forging another link of that
chain of sympathy which he trusted would ever unite Victoria
to old England. (Cheers.) In the light of recent events
he seemed to see that some of Gordon?s spirit had spread
itself throughout the whole of Australia, and had actuated the
thousands of men who had offered their services to defend
their homes, and, if necessary, like Gordon, die in the path of
duty. (Cheers.)
The motion was carried amidst loud cheers.
Perhaps the most impressive part of the proceedings was
that which followed at this stage, namely the performance on the
great organ of the ? Dead March in Saul." At the wailing
of the first strain the military rose and stood to attention,
an example which was immediately followed by all present.
Never, probably, in Melbourne has Handel?s immortal tribute
to the mighty dead been performed under more solemn or
pathetic circumstances. With bent heads and reverent mien
the great assemblage listened till the last note had died away,
and the effect was as of an act of solemn worship in the still
deep calm of some vast cathedral.
Bishop Moorhouse, who was next called on, was received
with loud and prolonged applause. He said, ?Your Excellency,
Ladies and Gentlemen, ?I have been told by some persons
that this meeting has been too long deferred, that the enthusiasm
for General Gordon has cooled, and that we ought to have
struck while the iron was hot. Well, ladies and gentlemen, if
that were true, if General Gordon were a person only capable
of exciting a hot and passing glow of enthusiasm, then we
ought not to build to him a statue, and we ought not to have
struck at all. (Loud cheers.) If our love and admiration of
General Gordon be only founded upon the glamour of one
heroic action, then it was well that we paused, that we might
not afterwards be shamed; but if the fact be otherwise, as I
believe it to be, then it was especially well that we paused?
paused until the fierce light of criticism had beaten upon his
character and searched it through, until we had asked ourselves
the questions, why do we admire General Gordon? why do we
desire to perpetuate his memory? why do we wish to set his
heroic form before the eyes of our children and of our children's
children? (Loud cheers.) Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is
said the instinct of the people?that is, of the whole people?
is rarely misled; and that is so. At the same time reason has
its claims, and it demands from us that we shall not only


admire, but shall distinctly state the comprehensible grounds
of our admiration. That also is well; because, unless we
understand the meaning of a great life, we shall never profitably
learn its lesson. (Cheers.) Now, I think that any person
pondering the elements of General Gordon?s character in the
light of his actions will have no difficulty in answering that
demand of the understanding. General Gordon was not a
mere general like Gonsalvo, Turenne, or Moltke; he was not
a statesman general like Caesar or Napoleon. He was less
than that, and he was more than that. (Cheers.) On the
other hand, he was not a mere teacher like Plato or Gautama,
nor was he merely a hero teacher like Socrates or Savonarola;
he was less than that and he was more than that. (Cheers.)
What was he then ? In a word, he was the sworn servant of
the ideal, but he belonged to a particular class of its servants,
those who fight for it with a naked sword on the battle-field of
man?s active life. General Gordon was a soldier with the
influence of the ideal glory about his head; he was a Garibaldi
fighting for his ideal; he was as Sir Galahad, ?whose strength
was as the strength of ten, because his heart was pure.? (Cheers.)
That, ladies and gentlemen, was the secret of the wondrous
fascination of his personal influence. He was so tender that
women trusted him and embraced his feet, and said they were
told that he was the father and saviour of the Soudan. He
was so keen-sighted, so true, so valiant, so unselfish, that
strong men followed him without asking why; they felt that
the words from his lips were like the commandments from the
Unseen. (Cheers.) The simple fact was, ladies and gentlemen,
that the ideal shone through him, and men felt that he was the
embodiment of something greater than himself. General
Gordon was a man of strong understanding, but I suppose he
was not as supreme in what we call talent as in what we call
genius. One has only to read that book of his upon his life in
Palestine to see that upon some subjects, at least, his judgment
needed breadth and sobriety. In short, it seems to me that
his excellencies of all kind sprang mainly from his almost
incomparable character. He had so firm a grasp of what it
was necessary to do in practical emergencies, because he was
never blinded by self-interest or self-conceit. (Cheers.) His
glance was bent upon the thing itself, upon its rational and
moral aspects, and because he was so ?I will say?sublimely
unselfish, he could see shams and sophistries by intuition.
He was great and vigorous in action, mainly because of his
whole-souled attention to duty; he would go anywhere, he
would do and suffer anything, if only a sense of moral obligation
pointed the way. (Loud cheers.) It is impossible for any
man to believe that Gordon would have done anything that


he did not believe to be right, or again, that believing anything
to be right he would have ceased striving to do it while he
drew breath. He went to Khartoum, as the Governor has told
you in his eloquent and masterly speech, for the purpose of
delivering the European and Egyptian garrisons, and every
man knew that he would either achieve his purpose or die.
The Government might vacillate, but Gordon would never do
so. (Loud Cheers.) Pashas might be treacherous, but every
poor fellah and every helpless woman knew well that Gordon
would never leave them unless he left them in safety or left
them in death. (Cheers.) He seems to me, ladies and gentle-
men to be a modem Bayard?a perfect knight ?sans peur,
sans reproche ?(loud cheers) ?a man, who was devoted, pious,
just, and stainless?nay, it seems to me that the resemblance
between him and Bayard is far closer than most people think.
Did you ever read the three rules which the mother of the
great Bayard gave him, and which he tried to obey all through
his heroic life. They are these :?First, to commit himself to
God night and morning, and to serve him without offence.
Secondly, to be courteous to all men, casting away pride, to
be truthful and temperate and loyal. Third, to be charitable
and to divide all that God gave him with God?s poor. (Loud
cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, if, instead of making to
you a short speech, I were going to give you a lecture on the life
of Gordon ?(cheers) ?l would take these three rules of Bayard
as my text, and I would try to show you, as I could in full
detail, how first it was Gordon?s sense that he was the ser-
vant, the instrument, the slave of God that stayed him up and
inspired him in all his actions. Secondly, that he was so
courteous, so gentle, so humble, so tender, that not merely
his comrades of Khartoum, but even men who were his
chance fellow passengers, seemed to love him with all their
hearts. (Cheers.) And thirdly, that he was so charitable, so
profusely generous, melting down, as the Governor has told
us, his war medal that he might give the gold to the destitute,
that he died as nobly poor as he was nobly good. (Loud
cheers.) And, strange to say, his end was like the end of
Bayard, for at last Bayard was on the losing side, and the
star of his heroism shone out the more splendidly because,
as the Mayor told us, of the clouds of calamity in which it set.
(Hear, hear.) So it was with Gordon. We mourned his
death, we grieved passionately because of the miscarriage of
the efforts of our noble soldiers to release him. (Cheers.)
But if you could have separated Gordon from the helpless
beings he defended, do you think he would have mourned the
manner of his end ? I trow not. (Hear, hear.) But we at
least can say of him, what he never would have said of him-


self, in the Laureate?s words about his latest hero, that he
was ? mail?d in the perfect panoply of faith, first of the
foremost of their files who die for God, and glory so to die.?
(Cheers.) It is said that people used to say of Dante as they
saw him in the street ?? There goes a man who has been in
hell.? (Laughter.) I think we can say with equal truth of
Gordon?? There goes a man who has been in Heaven.?
(Cheers.) But though he drew his inspiration and his
principles from on High, it was in the common life of men
that he proved their temper and their origin. He was no
mere Sir Galahad, riding away on an idle quest that was
to end in seclusion ; he was the Arthur, rather, who,
feeling himself a son of God, used his utmost energy to fence
the right and smite the wrong, striving as long as he had
strength to do this, and passing when his work was done, ? to
where, beyond these voices, there is peace.? (Loud cheers.)
Ay, and he shall come again, as they thought Arthur would
come, in sons of ours whose spirits he has kindled. For his
greatness was wholly that of character, the greatness that
influences most mightily the hearts of men, which is most
easily understood, and, thank God, most easily imitated by
the multitudes of the world. (Cheers.) A man cannot
choose to be a genius, he cannot choose to be a general,
a statesman, or a poet, but by the help of Christ, the humblest
man in this hall can be greater than any of them?great with
the greatness of the heroic Gordon. (Cheers.) And that
is the very reason why we must have a statue of him in the
midst of us. (Cheers.) We want to show him to the eyes of
our children, that when in ordinary life they are tempted either
to do mean things, or praise mean men, or oppress the weak,
or abuse and deceive women, or be foul or impure, the
lineaments of that pure and perfect face may shine into
their souls, and shame them. (Cheers.) And in national
emergencies, when the state is tempted to do something
unjust, to be craven to the great, to bow at the dictate of
some despotic autocrat, to jeopardise the national honour or
the national freedom, the high and noble form of Gordon may
suggest to them what he would have done, what he did, in
similar emergencies. (Cheers.) Did you ever read the words
of the harper of Roderick Dhu, as he sang to his chieftain in
prison of the incidents of the battle that broke his clan ?
??Ah, where was Roderick then?
One blast upon his bugle horn were worth a thousand men.?
? Oh, for an hour of Napoleon,? the poor French are said
to have cried in their agony in 1870. ? Oh, for an hour of


Gordon ; oh, for an hour of thought about him,? Victoria
might cry in some moment of supremest peril. (Cheers.)
And shall we deny them the sight of that noble face and form ?
No; we will build, I trust, a colossal statue of him in the
midst of this empire city, to stand for all time, that it may say
to our children night and day, ?Be pious, be truthful, be
valiant, be good, and nothing can harm you, for what can slay
truth, or what can conquer piety and justice?? (Cheers.)
I sincerely hope that we shall have many institutions, or at
least one great institution, in this city connected with the
name of Gordon. (Cheers.) But I am for a statue first of
all. (Loud cheers.) And I will tell you why. A statue
speaks of nothing but the man. (Hear, hear.) An institution
speaks of the work that is done there, and of the men in that
institution who have done the work, and I know that many a
noble name attached to institutions has almost faded into
forgetfulness. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, I say, because a
statue commemorates the wisdom, the piety, the valour, or
the devotion of the man whom it represents, let us have
a statue of Gordon to commemorate all these virtues in the
one great hero. (Cheers.) Gordon was supremely worthy of
this commemoration, for he ? being dead yet speaketh ? to us
and to our children, in peace as well as in peril, in the common
course of our daily and national life as in the supremept
moments of our national destiny?(cheers)?and therefore it
is that I have great pleasure in now moving the resolution
to which my name has been attached :
? That, in the opinion of this meeting, a statue of General
Gordon should be erected in the city of Melbourne,
with a view both of doing honour to his memory and
of placing a great example prominently before the
present and succeeding generations.?
The Bishop then resumed his seat, amid loud and
enthusiastic cheering.
Mr. Graham Berry was called upon to second the resolution,
and met with a cordial reception. He said :?I am quite sure
there is not a man or woman in this large assemblage but will
remember it to their dying day. (Cheers.) I have attended
many meetings, and I have heard eloquent speeches, but I have
never listened to a series of addresses that have interested me
more than those I have listened to to-night. (Cheers.) We
have had a mental picture of the British hero, whose noble
character we are met to honour?a picture that will never fade


from our memories while memory lasts. (Cheers.) We have
had a grand address from His Excellency the Governor?a more
eloquent one I never heard?in which he detailed in simple but
appropriate language a brief but comprehensive history of
Gordon?s life. (Hear, hear.) We have had a speech from
Lord Lymington, a member of the British House of Commons,
and a visitor to this colony, who has given us from that stand-
point his opinions with regard to the events which led up to
the lamented death of the great hero. (Hear, hear.) We have
heard the heartfelt words of his schoolfellow, Major-General
Downes, and last, but not least, the very eloquent address with
which the Bishop has thrilled this great audience. (Cheers.)
But it has all been about the life of Gordon, and I think we
have scarcely realised fully as yet all that has come to mankind
.by his glorious death. (Cheers.) His life was a combination
of noble qualities not usually found in one man, but only in
several of the best, the bravest, and the greatest of the human
race. (Cheers.) That was the distinctive feature of Gordon?s
character. Other men have been great generals, other men
have been great philanthropists, other men have been self-
denying Christians, devoting their lives to charity and the
amelioration of the lot of mankind, but the crowning glory of
Gordon?s life was that he combined all these in one man.
(Cheers.) His death was a glorious death, though he died
surrounded by many circumstances that all must deplore.
(Hear, hear.) We all deplore the non-success of any mission
in which England is engaged, but the records of the heroism
and endurance of our troops in the Soudan, and above all the
glorious death of the brave and gallant defender of helpless
women and children in Khartoum, will be among the brightest
pages of the military annals of old England. (Loud cheers.)
They prove that, no matter where or under what circum-
stances they were placed, British soldiers will do as their
forefathers did before them?uphold the honour and glory of
the Empire. Our interest in this part of the world is further
marked by the fact that, for the first time in history, troops
from Australia have stood side by side with the gallant defenders
of old England. (Cheers.) The lesson of Gordon?s life is
stereotyped by his death, which has brought more prominently
before the mind?s eye of his fellow countrymen all those qualities
which have made him the darling of the British people. And
what can Gordon want more that that his life?s work should be
stereotyped for all succeeding generations ? Therefore, I say
with the Bishop, let us have the statue first, whatever may
come after. (Cheers.) We want an outward and visible sign


of the man himself. We want to utilise his life to the very
utmost; we want it to be a grand example for all time. That
statue will tell to future generations the story of Gordon?s
glorious life and heroic death. But there is something even
more than that. We hear a good deal at the present time of
some means by which all parts of the British Empire may be
combined as one, by bonds that shall be strong, and yet shall
in no way tend to threaten the independence of any of the
separate communities. (Hear, hear.) All kinds of plans are
being devised for what is spoken of as Imperial Federation.
Let them go on, and if they succeed, well and good; but no
bond is so lasting, none so strong, as the bond which exists in
our minds when we say that this grand Englishman was also
one of our own countrymen, giving us the same right to speak
of him as they can speak of him in London or in Manchester.
(Cheers.) We are united in one common language, in one
common object, and in one common hero. We were just as
proud of his achievements, and just as ready to strengthen him
in his life-time when we were able to do it; and the only regret
in Australia is that the thought did not occur earlier to give
to Gordon that material aid which came at last too late.
(Cheers.) For these reasons, then, I believe that this meeting
is right. You have responded nobly to the appeal of the
Committee, and the words we have heard from the platform
have been worthy the occasion. There is only one thing now
to be done, and that is to see that what has been said shall
sink deep into our minds, and that knowing all about Gordon,
and the way in which he lived, we should aspire to imitate
him, and acknowledge and estimate his proper worth. This
will be done in allowing a very short time to elapse before the
committee are placed in a position to carry out the memorial
of his life. (Cheers.) Such a statue as that proposed will
show to our sons and grandsons what the man it commemorates
has done. It has been truly said by previous speakers that he
was a slave to duty. He did a thing because it was right; not
because it brought honour or wealth, but because he believed
he was doing his duty, and endeavouring to the best of his
ability to elevate his country and the whole human race.
(Cheers.) I say, if we feel that fact, let us help the Committee
to put it into a tangible and practical shape. Let it not be
long before a monument is erected in our midst, giving the
prominent features and characteristics of that great life. Let
that be done as a part of our duty, but don?t let us rest in our
duty till that further hint of His Excellency is acted upon, and
we have some practical institution in the direction in which
Gordon?s thoughts and wishes tended at work in our midst.
(Cheers.) Then we shall be able not only to point to the statue


as illustrative of his life and the main incidents of his career,
but also to an institution established to carry on the work for
which we all honour this great hero. (Cheers.)
His Excellency said he had received an apology from
Dr. Madden, who was unable to be present. He would
therefore call upon M. Dillon, the French consul, to support
the motion, which he was the more capable of doing, as he
had been the intimate friend of Gordon.
M. Dillon said he had met General Gordon nearly five
years ago, in a place which had been the scene of a very sad
event. He referred toTien-tsing and the massacre which took
place there in 1870, when large numbers of women and
children were brutally murdered by an infuriated mob, and
their houses wrapped in flames. When he related to Gordon
the details of that horrible event, the General became
melancholy and thoughtful, but suddenly he said, ?No more
dreadful death can be imagined than to be torn in pieces by
an excited mob; still I would like to die some death of the
kind if it were in the fulfilment of some noble duty.?
(Loud applause.) In his intercourse with Gordon he had
opportunities of admiring his elevation of mind, his attention
to duty, the diffidence of his character, and the liberality of
his views. He was proud to be able to support the resolution,
and at the same time to testify to hip own private acquaintance
and friendship with General Gordon. (Cheers.)
Councillor levers supported the resolution, and added his
concurrence in the proposal to erect a statue as a memorial of
the late General Gordon. The young would be taught by
such a monument that there was something better in life than
the mere amassing of wealth. They wanted their young to be
inspired, and there was no better means of inspiring them
than by placing such a monument before them in the centre of
the city. (Cheers.)
The resolution having been put, and carried with acclama-
tion, the City Organist played Chopin?s ? Funeral March.?
Mr. J. L. Purves proposed the third resolution as follows:
? That it is advisable that the subscription to the Gordon
Memorial should be of a national character; that it
be an instruction to the Committee to invite the
co-operation of all classes of the community; and that
this Meeting pledges itself to do its utmost to promote
the raising of the Fund.?


An Australian by birth, he had a general knowledge of the
feelings of the section of the community to which he belonged,
and he was sure that when Gordon went forth on his glorious
mission to Khartoum, every man and woman in the colony
followed each step he took with palpitating heart, and prayed
that he might be successful. That he would have proved
successful if he had not been betrayed, they all believed ; but
he had died to leave behind him a record which might fairly
stir every man and woman up to better effort.
Mr. B. Douglass seconded the motion, stating that the
industrial classes of the community owed a debt of deep
gratitude to General Gordon for the services he had rendered
to them, and they would all be willing to contribute their mite.
He would use all his influence to raise the modest sum of
� 2,000 or �3,000 asked for by the Committee. A much larger
sum could be raised for the perpetuation in other ways of the
memory of one of the most glorious men who had appeared in
history.
The motion was carried amidst applause.
Sir W. J. Clarke proposed a vote of thanks to His Excel-
lency the Governor for presiding, and for the admirable speech
he had delivered. The thanks of the meeting were also due
to Lady Loch for her attendance. (Loud cheers.) He hoped
the statue to be erected would be completed as soon as possible,
and that His Excellency would have an opportunity of unveiling
it. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. R. G. Benson (vice-president of the committee) seconded
the motion, which was carried with acclamation.
His Excellency said, ?I am deeply grateful for the
reception you have given to the resolution. I must make
good an omission, by informing the meeting that a great
number of letters have been received from members of the
Ministry, from members of Parliament, and from the Judges,
expressing their deep regret at their inability to attend this
meeting. I rejoice to think that one result ?and the
important result?of this meeting is, that there is every
prospect of a statue being erected which will preserve the
bright example of the hero?s life, and keep it ever prominent
before the people of this colony; and by knowing and learning
his life I trust the youth of this town and of this colony may


learn to attempt to follow in his footsteps. (Loud cheers.)
I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, it has afforded me the
very greatest pleasure to have had the opportunity of
presiding on this occasion, and of taking my share in doing
honour to a man who, with the spirit of a martyr in his faith,
has met with a hero?s death.
The National Anthem was played, and the meeting
dispersed.

Dear Sir,
Gordon Memorial Fund.
A Fund is being raised in Victoria, to erect a Statue in Melbourne to the memory
of General Gordon, of which the Prospectus as issued in the Colony is appended.
An enthusiastic Demonstration was made in its favour at a Public Meeting at the
Town Hall, about six weeks ago, presided over by His Excellency the Governor. A full
account of this meeting is sent to you in Pamphlet form by the same mail with this. The
Committee hope you may find time to peruse it, and especially to read the speeches of the
Governor, the Mayor, the Bishop, and Lord Lymington.
Since the Public Meeting, subscriptions, large and small, have been coming steadily
in from all classes of the community; but it is found that about �5OOO will be required, and
it is thought that in so national a movement, all Victorians who are absent from the Colony,
and many others who take interest in the Colony, would be glad to join. Your subscription
is therefore invited. It may be paid to the account of the Fund at the Bank of Victoria
in Clements? Lane, Lombard Street, London. The Branch will forward all subscriptions
to the Colony free of exchange.
Faithfully yours,
W. J. CLARKE, President.
J. LAKE, Secretary.

GORDON MEMORIAL FUND.
Offices :?No. 9 Committee Room,
Town Hall, Melbourne,
19 th J-uue, 1885.
Subscriptions are solicited for the Gordon Memorial Fund. The object in view is to perpetuate the
icmory of the late General Charles George Gordon, who, after a pure and noble life, was slain on the
6th of January, 1885, at Khartoum, which place he had for twelve months heroically defended.
The full history of General Gordon's unequalled career is now known to his fellow-countrymen. He
accepted by people of all classes and creeds as the type of those qualities that make the men of Britain
reat. He first served his country at Sebastopol. His military genius and his self-contained power were
onspicuously displayed in the suppression of the Taiping rebellion in China. He refused the honours and
le money granted to him as leader of the ? Ever Victorious Army,?? because he disapproved of certain
xecutions after surrender, and he returned to the English service. In England his spare hours were devoted
5 unobtrusive labours amongst the poor. The outcasts of both sexes, and the fever-stricken patients in
aunts which others shrank from, were the objects of his solicitude. It has -been ascertained that his valuable
icdals, the records of his service, were sacrificed by him in anonymous charity during the cotton famine,
'or six years he gallantly faced unparalleled difficulties and dangers in the Soudan, in order to suppress the
lave trade. With no friends, and surrounded by slave-dealing pashas, he was sustained because he ?lived
ver in the Great Taskmaster?s eye.? His private letters?now published?relating how he was upheld by
lith in his Maker, are gems in Christian literature. He was asked by the British Government to withdraw
le Egyptian garrisons from the Soudan in the face of a fierce desert enemy, and, in a gallant, loyal spirit,
e undertook that hopeless mission. The eyes of the world were turned upon the lonely, undaunted hero
ho stood at bay and grandly died at Khartoum.
It is proposed to erect a Statue to General Gordon. The statue is the mode by which nations in all
ges have indicated their ideals, and have done honour to their wisest and best. Pitt and Peel, Wellington
nd Nelson, Scott and Burns, and within the last few years Eeaconsfield and Carlyle, have been thus set
efore their fellow men. Gordon wanted no statue. He did not serve for earthly fame. But those who
ppreciate Gordon feel that the community would be better for such a memento of his noble life and glorious
eath. The monument, conspicuous to the eye, would ever be doing its silent work of reminding young and
Id of the great example set by the most heroic of modern Englishmen. The young would be instructed by
lis visible tribute to Gordon?s greatness. It would be a guide to parents in their aspirations?
?And where is he
Who dares foreshadow for an only son
A lovelier life, a more unstained, than his? 1
