collusion between himself and Mrs. Deale as to the disposi

between the burning buildings and the southern portion of th
Arcade. About the same time the branch of another eugin

it prudent to cut off the communication with the main build

The gamekeepers of Lord Egremont were on the watch or
the night in question, and heard the snap of a percussion
lock ; they immediately saw a bird fly out of a tree ; they
went up and saw the prisoner and another man armed with
gnus and sticks.
Some doubt arising as to the identity of Pearson, the jury
acquitted him; but found Baxter guilty, and he was sen-
tenced to one month?s imprisonment and liard labour.
Peter and Henry Langley, James Marks, Simon Tywell,
William Gastor, and William Caplin were indicted for a
similar offence in the preserves of Westbrook Richardson,
Esq., at Weston, on the night of the 28th of December last.
It appeared that the prisoners used great violence, and frac-
tured the skull of one of the keepers, some of the bones o:
which were produced in Court. No doubt existing as to the

they were sentenced to transportation for 14 years.

driver had previously struck the horse. After attempting to
stop him he (witness) opened the door of the phaeton and got
out, in doing which he fell. Upon recovering himself, he
saw the phaeton upset about 100 yards from him. The plain-
tiff was sitting on the bank; his arm was tied un, and
bleeding very much. On being removed to a public-house
close by, it was discovered that there was a compound fracture,
and the hones protruded from the skin. Three surgeons
stated that tile plaintiff would never be able to use his arm
again for any business purpose.
George Mitton stated that he was a stable-keeper at Chi-
chester, and had been in the habitof driving the horse ; it was
a M'-l'yr, and constantly ran away ; it was not safe to put him
into single harness unless he had been hard worked the pre-
vious day.
Other witnesses spoke to the bad character of the horse.
Air. Serjeant Spankie (with whom was Air. Hollist) ad-
dressed the jury for the defendant, and attributed the acci-
dent to Mr. Armstrong, in having offered a bet to the driver
to induce him to go at a quicker rate than was compatible
with safety. The learned setjeant then called witnesses, who
deposed to the absence of vice in the horse, and his aptitude
for the wot k to which he was put.
His lordship then proceeded to sum up, but the jury stated
that they had come to a conclusion, and found for the plain-
tiff?damages 3001.

Henry Gurney and John Cooke were capitallv indicted for

Sir AY. Follett appeared for the plaintiff in this case, which
came before the Court on further directions. The bill was
filed for the administration of the estate and effects of the
late Sir Gilbert Hyde East, who died in 1828, leaving a very
long and somewhat obscure testamentary disposition of his
property contained in the pages of a book, to which there
was appended a card by way of index, and on which tiie va-
rious persons designated by the letters ? K., L , AI., N.,?
&c., in the body of the will, were explained to be Lady East,
his wife, and the sons of Sir AY. Clayton, and his brothers,
tvho were his nephews. Much of the will was written in pen-
cil, the use of which for such a purpose the testator declared
he did not know was prohibited by law. Alany legacies were
bequeathed to his relations, and 7s. a-weelc ordered to he paid

bounty ; and that, in fact, all the evidence on the other side
had failed to prove either the insanity of the testator, or the
fraud of the defendant. He laid great stress upon the fact of
a trial at law having taken place with referei.ee to the will of
the testator, and of the result of that trial having been the
establishment of the validity of the will; that, after such
the fire in the Arcade, several of the sufferers have been lulled
into afceiing of security, and have abstained from effecting
insurances on their property. We are happy to say that no
portion of either Burlington-house or any of the offices at-
tached is damaged. It ; s to be hoped that the Grand Junc-
tion Water Company, which is the only company by which

establishment of the will in a court of justice, it was idle to
Stilling- nt the Royal Hotel, Great Stanmore, to inquire
.
for the support of each of Ins horses and dogs, to he fed on bis-
cuit and other nutriment fitting to their condition, with a strict
injunction that on the approach of old age or helplessness no
one should presume to kill them from a mistaken sense of
humanity. The parrots living at the time of his death were
also provided with a certain annual stipend, and directions
were given with respect to their being led and maintained.
These and similar bequests, as well as the disposition of the
real property of the testator, were not disputed, the question
being as to the disposal of the personalty, which amounted to
a very large sum. Lady East, who has since married Mr.
AYestenra, and who was designated by the letter K, was, ac-
cording to the will, to take a part of the personalty for her
life, and after her death the estate was to be purchased, which
?state was ? to go to L., if not to AI.? Certain Austrian, Prus-
sian, and Neapolitan bonds, producing an income of above
600/. a-year, were to he applied to the maintenance of certain
almshouses on the testator?s estate. The Master had found
endeavour to show that the testator did not know what he
was doing in executing a conveyance of an estate. He de-
fended Calley from all knowledge of the contents of Smith?s
will until after his death, and held that the evidence proved,
that instead of ever having exercised undue influence over his
mind, he had ever treated him with the greatest respect and
attention. The learned counsel concluded by contending
that, from the depositions of a mass of witnesses, which were
read, there was no proof of Mr. Smith?s insanity ; and that,
although, like many other persons, he might sometimes have
laboured under momentary delusions, the time of the execu-
tion of the conveyance in question was not one of the
number.
It being at this stage of the case past four o?clock, his
lordship rose ; and on Monday Messrs. Boteler and Chand-
less will proceed with the arguments for the defendant Van
ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS.
It would appear that tiie alarm of fire was first given by
some ladies in Mr. Absolon?s house running from the back
part of the premises calling ? fire,? and that a candle had
dropped on some speedily ignitable furniture, which soon set
tiie room in flames. The whole house was shortly in one
body of fire, and it spread with amazing rapidity to the ad-
joining house, Air. Gilbert?s, and from thence to the Western
Exchange. This splendid establishment was also soon in-
cluded in the general destruction, and in consequence of tiie
iron door in the passage not being closed in the confusion that
prevailed, the flames reached the rear of Airs. Blackman?s,
the confectioner, in the Arcade, and the wind being strong
in that direction, the shops opposite fell a prey to tiie flames!
which continued their career to the extent of about 11 houses
on either side. The water in about an hour became abund-
touching the discovery ot the immense treasure in foreign gold
coin found in a field, on the side of a ditch, on tiie 24th and
26th ot January last, and which field is a portion of tiie
glebe -land in the possession of the respected rector, the Rev.
Dr. Arthur Robinson Chauvell. There was no owner of the
property, and as the King by an ancient law is claimant of
all treasure found hidden, the inquiry took place in conse-
quence of a prescript from Air. Maule, Treasury Solicitor.
From the extraordinary novelty of the inquiry, a very great
excitement prevailed ever since tiie order was known to have
arrived, and several of the inhabitants left the place in conse-
quence of having been partakers of the spoil, fearful that a
summary process would be issued against them to refund the
money, and, therefore, not being willing to undergo an ex-
amination before the coroner, they left the village. Alany.
went to London with their share, to? have it converted into the
sterling money of tins country.
The inquiry originated not from any direct interference on

BIRTH.
March 13, at North Church Rectory, Herts the ladr nf tRa
Rev. Sir J. Hobart Seymour, Bart, of a son ?
Mr. Andrews and Air. Byles prosecuted the prisoners, whom
Air. Prendergast defended.
The prosecutor is head gamekeeper to the Duke of Norfolk,
who has some extensive game preserves at Fornham, near this
town. 11 appeared tiiat a little after s.x o?clock in the evening
of the 26th of December last, the prosecutor was on duty in a
wood belonging to his Grace, called ? The Hvde,? in which
there is a private green walk, called ?The Ladies? Walk.?
Barkham was in that walk when he heard some pheasants
?whirr? past him, and almost immediately afterwards
he heard footsteps approaching from the centre of the
wood. He then hid himself behind a stub, from whence he
could see two persons coming up the Ladies? Walk, one of
whom had a gun on his shoulder. The moon was then
shining brightly, and the prosecutor swore with great posi-
tiveness that tlie two persons were the prisoners, and that it
was Gurney who had the gun. The prosecutor lay still be-
hind Ids stub till the men came within arrus?-length of him
when he sprang up and stood before them. H� said to them!
? So you are the men that have been disturbing the w�od, are
ant, and the firemen brought the pipes into play with great
effect, the soldiers and others working at the engines
with scarcely any intermission. By the exertions of the
firemen, military, and police, the fire was stopped in its pro-
gress beyond the extent we have mentioned. Among the
shops destroyed we have been enabled to ascertain the follow-
ing, but the confusion was so great that it was impossible to
ascertain the real extent of the calamity : From Air. Black-
man?s the flames extended to Mr. Hasser?s child bed-linen
warehouse, Air. Perry, hair-dresser, Mr. Alorell, Mr. Wheeler,
Mr. Chard, printseller, Mr. Compact, hosier, &c. The gal-
lery of pictures belonging to Air. Yates, at the Exchange, is
totally consumed, and the loss is said to amount to between
30,000/. and 40,000/. The rears of several houses in Bond-
street are either totally reduced or greatly damaged, and the
aiarriages.
that there were no almhouses, and that the charitable bequest
was in that respect void, and he had also found that it was not
certain to whom the testator intended to leave the estate by the
nse of the expressions ?to L., if not to M.? The parties now,
therefore, came for the opinion of the Court with respect to
these points, and the determination of the question of who
was entitled as residuary legatee.
Air. AA r igram and Air. Girdlcstone argued on the same side
with Sir AY. Follett, that the bequest over to L., if not to M.,
was void on the ground of uncertainty, and that Lady East
took the whole property absolutely as residuary legatee, that
appellation being dearly given to her in more than one part
of the will. r
Air. Treslove contended that the representative of Lady
Clayton, Sir Gilbert?s sister and heiress-at-law, must be con-
sidered as the residuary legatee.
Mr. Knight argued that there was no uncertainty in the
bill, as the person to be preferred under the designation of L.
was the son of Mr. East Clayton East.
POLICE.
Bow-street.?Tiie Unstamped Press A man,
who gave his name George Hind, was brought up in custody
of Goddard and Fletcher, officers of the establishment, charged
with possessing 34 quires of unstamped newspapers.
The officers deposed that they saw the defendant, at h little
before six, in Lincoln?s Inn-fields, driving the hackney cab No.
8267, and on their observing that there was a bundle in the cab,
they stopped him, and demanded what he had got. He replied
that he did not know, but stated that he had been called from
the stand in Charles-street, Covent-garden, to take up at the
corner of Vere-street, and on arriving there the bundle was
placed in his cab with directions to him to convey it to the
Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane. The officers on this took
the part ot the King, but in consequence of memorials havin'*
been forwarded to the Treasury to ascertain the right of par-
ties to claim, on account of a dispute arising as to the right.
The money, it appears, was first found bv two men, named
Jeffkins, coachman, and Reeves, gardener," to the rector; it
consisted of 365 pieces of foreign gold coin, among which were
Louis d?or of the reign of Louis XVIII., Napoleons, Pao-odas
Spanish doubloons, &c., the estimated value being 382/. 15s. 6d!
The men divided tiie money equally between them, and it was
found on Saturday, the 24tli Jan. The coachman did not
mention a word to his wife about tiie matter, but Reeves did
and the next day, fiom some motive, he brought his share to
Jeffkins to take care of) and which lie put along with his own
in some concealed place. In the course of that day, however

(918 impressions) of unstamped newspapers.
The defendant repeated the statement he had made alreadv
to the officers, and
Mr. Halls directed that the papers should be detained, bat
discharged the defendant.
Union-hall.?Mr. James, the barrister, on the part ofa
Mr. Fleming, made application for warrants against two in-
dividuals under the following circumstances:?
It appeared from Mr. James?s statement that, during the
pending of a commission of lunacy to inquire into the state
of mind of Colonel Norris, residing in Lambeth, an attempt
was made by some parties to make a forcible entry into the
Colonel?s house, for the purpose of taking possession of the
property. One of the parties against whom the learned
counsel applied called at the house on the preceding night,
and, having knocked at the street door, when it was opened
shoved his stick in, with a view of preventing it from being
c losed. The servant, however, snatched the stick away, and
succeeded in shutting the person out, and by this means pre-
vented a forcible entrance into the house.
As, however, it did not appear that any threats of personal
violence were uttered towards the individual for whom Mr.
James attended, or any other acts which would have justified
them in granting warrants, the application was refused, the
nagistrates remarking that if Mr. Fleming remained at Col.
Norris?s house as his protector, he would be justified in calling
n the assistance of other friends to aid him.
Marlborough-street Oliver Lodge was charged
with having stolen a parcel containing silk goods, &c., the
iroperty of Messrs. Tidmarsh and Co., linen-drapers, Regent- '
street, and Thomas Crow was also accused with having felo* \
destruction of property by the fire and the hastv removal is
at present beyond calculation. At two o?clock tiie fire was so
completely subdued as to quiet the fears of those resident in
the vicinity.

Reeves?s wife found an opportunity to communicate'with Jeft-
kins?s wife,and related to her that her husband was in possession
of a large quantity of gold, upon ascertaining which, she com-
pelled her husband to delight her eyes with the sight of it.

fears were entertained that the fire would break out afresh, in
consequence of the gas-pipes attached to the various buildings
destroyed in the Arcade burning with great fury, but appli-
their good fortune, which she promised to do; but on seeing
her mistress, she informed her of the discovery, when Mrs.
Chauvell expressed a desire to see the coin. The next day
unknown to her husband, Jeffkins?s wife laid the whole of
the money on the table before Mrs. Chauvell, who told her
servant to leave it there, as it belonged to the rector, in rioht
of his possession of the glebeland. Between that day and the
time when the King?s mandate was issued, the Treasury had
been memorialized by tiie rev. gentleman, by Jeffkins and
Reeves, and by other parties, in consequence of which the
Lords of the Treasury came to the determination of applying
for tiie present investigation.
Who the owner of this property was, remains a mystery.
It is recollected by many of the inhabitants, that about Ili
years ago, a foreigner visited the village. He used to walk
about the fields, and was often met in lonely places in deep
abstraction. After having been there some weeks he sud-
denly left, and was never seen on heard of after. In less than
(wo years after a person came, and for some days was seen
wandering about the field in which the money was placed.
He at length communicated with a woman, and inquired if
here was any one in the village who had lately become eu-
?iched by the possession of a large sum of money, and men-
ioned that there were some thousands of pounds in gold coin
ieposited in a field. He mentioned about a foreigner
laving lived there some months before, and s?lid,

levelled it at the head of the prosecutor, and fired. The parties
at this time were within four or five yards of each other, and
the prosecutor received the charge in his face and head. The
piisoners then ran away, one of them dropping the cap
from his head, which lie did not stop to pick up. The
wounded man made the best of ins way home, was put to
bed, and the doctor sent for. It was found that he had seve-
ral shots in his tongue, and about 150 in his head and face;
his right eye was entirely destroyed, and his throat very se-
verely injured. He was confined to his house for two months,
and is not yet entirely well. On the day following this out-
rage the cap dropped by one of the persons in the wood was
found, and several witnesses swore that they believed it was
similar to one that the prisoner Gurney was in the habit of
wearing. He and the other prisoner were immediately appre-
hended and taken to the bed-side of the prosecutor, who on
seeing them declared that Gurney was the man by whom lie
was shot, and that the other prisoner was the man who called
put to him in the wood to shoot. The prisoners, however, ,
strenuously denied the statement, and declared that they
were not near the spot by three miles, giving the name of the
public-house at which they were drinking at the time of the
occurrence.
The prisoners in their defence asserted their innocence, and (
requested that their witnesses might bo called. Several per-
sons were then produced, who, if their testimnnv were hue.
VICE CHANCELLOR?S COURT,| AIarch 24.
FINNIMORE V. THE GREENWICH RAILWAY COMPANY.
All. Knight moved ex parte for a special injunction to re-
train the defendants Irom pulling down the plaintiff?s home
n Artillery-lane, or selling the materials, which it was al-
eged they were actually engaged in doing-, without any au-
hority under their act of parliament, and even without having
the plaintiff any previous notice of their intention to
ieal so summarily with his property. This was a course of
noceeding not to be tolerattd, not withstanding the present
fnania for railways.
His Honour granted the injunction, and observed there was
10 doubt that, this being a railway company, they would
nove with great rapidity to dissolve it.
ROLLS? COURT, March 26.
STEED V. CALLEY.
In this case, which was opened yesterday, the bill was filed
or the purpose of setting aside a transaction in the lifetime
)f a testator, on the ground of fraud and imbecility.
Mr. Pemberton, with Mr. Hetherington, appeared for the
lamtiff Steed, and Mr. Heathfield for an infant heir-at-law ;
VIr. Tinney, with Messrs. G. Turner and Williams, for the
cation having been made to the Old Chartered Gas Company.
Inspector Sewell was sent with a party of men to cut off the
pipes.
The whole of the buildings in the Arcade arc, we under-
stand, insured in the Westminster Fire-office.
Great fears were at one time entertained that the fire would
extend to the extensive premises of Mr. Keith, chemist and
iruggist, A. o. 54, Piccadilly, whose back premises, which are
built of wood, extend to the Western Exchange; but, by the
U'eat exertions of the police, we are happy to say they are hut
slightly damaged.

We have great pleasure in communicating generally ]
the following very interesting paper, now in circu-
lation, but which, we believe, has not yetfound its
way into any public journal. Such a testimony
cannot fail to be highly gratifying to the feelings of
those excellent men who have, under so much
obloquy, conscientiously discharged their duty to
the Church of England : ?
