TO MY FRIENDS IN THE NORTH.
?A Real Topsey? in Hobart Town .
You Launceston people may stare,
On reading what I shall relate,
Not once in ten years a real Topsey appears,
But we have no longer to wait.
We have no longer to wait.
On Wednesday there was a decision
Which show?d some ill nature, I'm sure,
For, of fathers confess?d, there were seven at least,
And ttvo or three more at the door.
Two or thr.e more at the door,
But what seems a puzzler to me,
Our J.P.?s a mother won?t find,
Refusing to hear the one who was there
Proves Justice is more deaf than blind.
Justice is more deaf than blind
No parents as yet are allow?d,
No friend or relation to love,
This poor little child?looks deucedly wild,
And every one gives it a shove.
Every one gives it a shove.
It?s made up to order I ween,
Its compound is?(sawdust and gas ;)
By chemical power from the essence of flour,
Its lungs are as?(Routy as brass).
Lungs are as?(Routy as brass).
So drowsy the South has become,
That everything looks like a dream ;
Here Topsies may grow, their pace being slow,
While Bullock Drays represent steam.
Bullock Drays represent steam.
Your go ahead style I admire,
Though schemers have work?d on your purse,
Good fortune will follow, while sleepy hollow
Dies blighted by apathy?s curse.
Blighted by apathy?s curse.
