A doctor is a useful man,
Who does us all the good he can.
But DR. WAUGH now takes the cake,
With housewives who can cook and bake.
Would you know the reason why
DR. WAUGH is voted best ?
Then just his BAKING. POWDER buy,
And put it to the test.
With it a girl can make a cake.
As light as any feather ;
But if she some other take,
’Twill turn out just like leather,
So let us all unite &

A Sydney Lady Cured of Hydatids by

Call and have a Talk with Mrs. Davies.
FRESH PROOFS DAILY.
377 Oxford Street Paddington,
Sydney, Ist. December, 1899.
Mr. S. A. PALMER, Agent for Vitadatio.
Dear Sir, —I write to let you know of the great benefit I have
derived since taking Webber’s Vitadatio. About ten years ago my
health broke down ; I suffered from bilious attacks, headache, con-
stipation and flatulence. I consulted doctors (the best in Melbourne)
and they said that my liver and kidneys were out of order, and that
was the cause of all my trouble They treated me for that com-
plaint, but I only derived temporary benefit. I soon became worse
and life was a burden to me. I tried a great many of the adver-
tised medicines for liver and kidney diseases, but got no better. I
had read so much about Vitadatio that I thought I would give it a
trial, and to my surprise, after taking six large bottles, my trouble
turned out to be “hydatids.” I continued with the medicine, and
am now quite cured. I have the hydatids preserved in spirits. I
am so thankful to get rid of such a terrible disease, and am so
well now, that I give you this testimonial, so that anyone suffering
similarly to what I did might try “Vitadatio.” I will be glad to
tell anyone about my case, and show them the hydatids, if they
will call, or will write fuller particulars to anyone wishing to know
more of my case, if they will enclose a stamped addressed envelope
for reply.—Yours very gratefully,
A Martyr to Indigestion and Bilious-
ness by Vitadatio.
Read it and Act at Once. Cannot speak too
highly of it.
144 Drummond Street, Ballarat,
18th August, 1199.
Mr. S. A. PALMER, Agent-General for YITADATIU.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in sending this testimony for
the great benefit I have received from using Webber’s Vitadatio.
I was a sufferer for nine years with indigestion and biliousness, also
dry retching ; in fact, so ill that 1 was given up by the doctors. For
three years I was hardly out of bed. 1 became so weak that I could
not attend to my household. I have been a martyr to pains in
my head, and words fail to express how intense my sufferings were.
I have tried doctors’ and patent medicines, but found no relief.
Finally I was persuaded to try Webber’s Vitadatio The first
bottle made me feel so ill that I was doubtful if the medicine would
do me any good. However, I deciied to give Vitadatio a fair trial
so I purchased a second bottle. I felt hopeful, for I began to feel
stronger every day. I took four bottles altogether, andean truth-
fully say I keel like a new woman, and was never better in my
life than at the present time. I can now attend to my household
duties without feeling them a burden. lam thankful to God
and grateful to Vitadatio for the renewed health and strength
which I enjoy. I cannot speak too highly in its praise, and
will be only too happy to give information to anyone who may be
suffering, if they will kindly call at the above address.

November 30, 1899.
Mr, B. A. PALMER,
184 Pitt Street, Sydney.
Dear Sir, —I am glad to testify to the invaluable qualities of
Yitadatio. Some thirteen months ago I had to consult a Melbourne
doctor re a severe attack of Rheumatism. The doctor prescribed
for me but the medicine gave me no permanent relief. I suffered
acute pain for some months, and was unable to get sleep for more
than an hour or two during the night. Knowing several of your
clients who had been cured by Yitadatio, I resolved to give it a trial
and am happy so say that for the last three months I have been
perfectly free from pain, and have no hesitation in attributing my
restored health to Yitadatio. I shall be very glad to give personal
corroboration of the above, if necessary.
Yours faithfully,
