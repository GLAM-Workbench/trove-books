CUSA
NEW SOUTH WALES
The Catholic United Services Auxiliary is
sponsored by the Catholic Church in the
State of New South Wales and administered
by the Diocesan Secretariate for Special
Works in the Archdiocese of Sydney.
The Auxiliary is under Permit of the Lord
Mayor’s Patriotic and War Fund of New
South Wales and is affiliated with the
Women’s Australian National Services
(W.A.N.S.) and is concerned with the
spiritual and temporal welfare of the men
of the armed forces.
Although sponsored by the Catholic Church,
and intended primarily for the spiritual and
temporal welfare of Catholic Soldiers, Sailors
and Airmen, Cusa has opened its doors to all
service men, irrespective of religion, and in
its Welfare Huts and Canteens is doing a
national service.

ADMINISTRATION.
The administration of Cusa, New South
Wales, is vested in the Diocesan Secretariate
for Special Works in the Archdiocese of
Sydney. The honorary Administrator will be
assisted in Sydney by a State Council and
in each Diocese by a Diocesan Council con-
sisting of a President, two Vice-Presidents, a
Secretary and a Treasurer nominated by the
Bishop of the Diocese.
The Catholic United Services Auxiliary
New South Wales is a “pool” for mutual
benefit. Cusa Headquarters, which will ad-
minister the whole fund, has the right to call
up excess credit in any diocesan account for
more urgent work elsewhere and at the same
time has the obligation of providing cash
where there may be a shortage. It is, how-
ever, understood that no purchases are to be
made beyond the capacity of the diocesan
account unless permission is first obtained
from Headquarters because there is no pro-
vision whatsoever for an overdraft. Whatever
money at credit in the diocesan account may
always be spent by the Diocesan Council
without any reference to Headquarters.


To conform to the Lord Mayor’s Patriotic
and War Fund requirements, a quarterly
report of all transactions, receipts and pay-
ments is to be submitted to Cusa Head-
quarters Sydney, supported by the Bank Pass
Sheet. This quarterly report should be
posted on the first day of each quarter.
The Diocesan Council may arrange enter-
tainments, with, of course, local ecclesiastical
approval and subject to the same ecclesiasti-
cal approval is in full control of all Cusa
activity within the diocese.

THE SEVEN DEPARTMENTS
OF SERVICE.
1. Spiritual Welfare and Social Service
Department:
The primary object of the Catholic United
Services Auxiliary is the spiritual welfare of
the armed forces and linked with religious
activity is social service in regard to the
welfare of the soldiers’ dependants.
Members are exhorted to keep in mind
their own personal sanctification and to pray
frequently for victory and peace. Quarterly
general communion on the fifth Sunday of
each quarter is obligatory for all Cusa mem-
bers, who will attend their own parish
churches on that day wearing uniform. A
general communion of members throughout
the State will be held on the Sunday before
Christmas each year. This annual communion
may be followed by communion breakfasts.
2. Voluntary Aid Detachment:
The training of a Voluntary Aid Detach-
ment under the direction of Catholic Doctors,
with practical experience work in Catholic
Hospitals, is considered a clear necessity in
the national emergency.


3. Handicrafts Department:
The Handicrafts Department is concerned
with spinning, weaving, knitting and sewing
for the comfort of men of all services and
the distribution is effected through the official
channel of the Lord Mayor’s Patriotic and
War Fund of New South Wales.
4. Canteen Department:
The organisation of recreation rooms and
canteens in the cities and towns of New
South Wales is undertaken by this depart-
ment.
5. Clerical and Statistical Department:
This department is concerned with volun-
tary clerical assistance in the administration
of the Auxiliary and with the statistics
relating to the Catholic war effort, particularly
in the matter of dependants’ welfare.
6. Finance Department:
The Finance Department is organised for
the provision of funds to maintain existing
Cusa activities and commence new works.
7. Special Services Department:
This department concerns general training
for national emergency and participates in all
sections of the Women’s Australian National
Services training scheme.


SPECIAL WORKS.
Every Camp Welfare Hut, Recreation
Room, Canteen, Depot and activity consti-
tutes a Cusa special work, controlled by a
Commandant.
ENLISTMENT.
Recruits may enlist in the Catholic United
Services Auxiliary at the State Headquarters,
133 Harrington Street, Sydney, or at each
Diocesan Headquarters in the episcopal cities
of New South Wales. A special recruiting
officer directs membership campaign.
IDENTIFICATION.
Every member of Cusa on duty must carry
membership card on which is recorded
registration number.
MEMBERS’ PARADE.
Every officially recognised unit of Cusa will
be expected to participate in regular parades
as invited by Headquarters.
CATHOLIC SOLDIERS’ CORPS.
Catholic ex-Service Men, soldiers of pre-
vious wars, have been organised in a Catholic
Soldiers’ Corps, as an arm of the Catholic
United Services Auxiliary, for those duties
outside the scope of the women’s organisation.
The Corps is responsible for the vigilance
and patrol work at the Canteens and in the
entertainment halls on the occasion of Cusa
functions.


UNIFORMS.
Dress Uniform: Bottle green gabardine
serge two-piece military suit, with serviceable
matching accessories.
Summer Uniform: Bottle green silklin
frock, made on military lines, with service-
able matching accessories.
V.A.D. Uniform: Green Cesarine frock
with white collar and cuffs. Two-tone green
hat to match.
The Cusa Uniform is very attractive. It
represents an organisation that has earned
not only the respect but the admiration of
the citizens of New South Wales. See that
you who are privileged to wear that uniform
respect it.
