OW. this part about me shows I'm not to blame
For being a dog really too hard to name!
Of course, all this happened when I was quite small
And what happened then, I'm not sure of at all . . .
But somebody said when they saw me that day-
Just about my frst day in the world I'd say-
“ Whatever is that? Over there!' Meaning me!
“What kind of a dog." it was said, "would that be.'
Of course no one knew! Soon, they all walked away.
But Id heard them 1 I did! Evry word that day
And I've not forgotten! But knowing it's true
I'm all wrong in some way .... what good does that do. ;

I came to be living where I’m living, now!
A very fine home it is-high on a hill-
But I’m sure that I shouldn’t say
that \ until
I go back a bit to my first home .... I see
I’m not telling this well this tale -
about me!
Well, my first home, I know, was
so poor - indeed -
Very often I said to
myself, I need
THINK now. I’ll tell you it’s time I must say
Just what happened next! And by starting that way
Soon, you’ll see, 111 be telling the best part .... how
A good deal more food and
a fine warm bed, too,
A Ujxol

And, nothing about it I’d say can I do
But om day a stranger, I saw, walking by
stranger, I saw, walking by
And I, looking hard at him, saw in his eye
That he rather liked me —my tail or my head


/ftw
I
I i
nd he saw I knew it! And, just then,
he said
Id do very well as his dog if I’d go
Off that very day! I could just let him know
If I wanted to - somehow - then he would see
That a very fine home would be maae for me
I certainly told him I'd go, heard him say,
My price wasn't high, “Ten and sixpence!
Good-day!’
Yes, I heard him say that and then went along
To be happy with him - I thought -
but how wrong
I was - I found that out -
J that very same day . . . .
In the home that he had |,
that very same day . . . .

ND that brings me up to the part just before
I came to the home I'll not leave any more
I almost got lost from it one day - but - still
That part is not ready for telling until
Ive told about this part. Again, I must say
Fm really not telling this tale well to-day!
Now this is the place where I wished I
could die!
Ev'ry day I would say to myself. "Oh 1 Why
Must I go about starving? Be beaten, too?"
That, just as Ive told you - did happen -
its true!
Then, one day I saw a small gate opened
wide
There it stood - as tho’ saying "Please
come inside'
And I did that, too’ I walked in and
soon knew
I had found a fine home and some good
food\ too!


There were other dogs there and horses were kept
In that place, hne and warm, where each night I slept
The horses I liked very much and each day
Id watch them go out and come back
and Id say
Which one I liked best!
No one minded at all.
“You little dog, you— they
would say, “you’re too small
To be here! Why, almost,
you re under our feet!"
And oh they would go-out
of sight-down the street!




then and I said. “I know
And that's just what
happened. The stranger
soon said,
/W P&j /
And he laughed
chats where I lived till it happened one day,
I heard someone talking and then someone say,
That small mixed up dog .... will you give her to me ?
I said - I'm to leave here - that I can see!
I should live with you! I'll go non ; when you go ... .
He laughed again then and said, “Marguerite! Meg!
Both those names would suit you but Fll call you Pep!”
And that's how it happened I'm Peg to this day,
Shes a queer one. that Peggy!’ Thats what they say,
But that's not important - like telling you how
I like living here in this home thats mine ; now!

Yes, I came here that day as I thought I would
And I wouldn’t leave now, if they said I could!
The furniture’s fine here and even the floor
Seems better than any I've walked on before.
The rooms are so many I sometimes can t see
Just how I'm to get to the one that’s for me . .
Of course, other people live here
with me, too.
A house just with me in it
- that - wouldnt do!
But when I do find it
my bedroom is fine
Tho the bed that I sleep on
that isn’t mine!
The man here who owns me
I make his bed do
And, “Peg ....’’ hell say often
‘Tm glad five got youT
Then he says. "Maybe - sometime
I'll get you wed . .
But when I don't hear him,
no more then, is said 1
And just what he means
I don't bother to think
I really just stay there!
Not sleeping a wink!

HERE S a little girl here - about ten or so -
•he rakes me our, saying. “Come on, now! Let's go
A motor car then takes me round and about -
Some dogs would be
frightened of that
Eve no doubt!
Then, the lady who
lives here she speaks
to me
Saymg, Mischief you re up to! Something, I see!
And what does she do then, but look up and down
Pretending quite hard to look fierce
But seeing me sitting just quietly there
“Well, in mischief you have been, she :
and to frown
says, “somen’here! "


•
Now. by this time Ive learnt to beg and to try
Very hard not to steal things tho really why
I shouldn't steal something - quite small - I cant see 1
Just why must I wait for whars given to me?
Of course. I dont think that
they mind a small mouse
I sometimes might find and
o
eat up in the house!

Often, visitors come, bringing strange dogs. too.
And some of them say to me, ‘Just look at you'
You're really not wanted here! Why do yousstay'y y '
They'll live here, they think 1 That's if I run away!
Yes, its plain they dont like me. but / can see
The dog really wanted in this house
I could say that I
bark -
I'm a watchdog too.
I could! But youd say soon enough its not true.
Although, if you re thinking now, Id run away -
If they left me here minding the house one day
Well, mavbe, I would! But. again, then, I might
Try barking my hardest till / died of fright.

That’s, of course, if I wanted someone to know
A thief was here stealing - and just wouldn't go!
Now, there s this I must tell you a good thing - too!
With all that has happened and all Ive been through
I’ve not been run over and / think that's fine.
Broken legs I have seen but not one that’s mine!
Of course. I have heard them sav - sometimes - I'm sick
J
If I should get a chill
then - I wear my
coat
And, The cold they say
now won t bother
your throat ...”
Ive heard them all say,
"To the hospital, quick!”
Then, it happens I'm there before.
one - two - three
You could say - that's the way
they look after me!

I’ve learnt to be quiet, say nothing at all
I stay in a corner or close by a wall
When sometimes there's trouble, sharp
words spoken, too,
In this house where I live! But Im sure
that you
Would never think that was my life!
You would say,
“Now. just your life. Peggy, please tell us today!
And. of course it means nothing
never for long
never for long /
Does anything really - in this house - stay wrong .... 'q.
They care for each other and all care for me
No wonder Im happy as a dog can be!
There s only one thing • • • • when crockery
_a° will break
■V _
In the house and the maid says, "For
goodness sake
That little dog lately gets under
my feet . . .
Id certainly like to say. “Please dont repeat
m\u Such words - even think them-
vAm the truth is that I
I I Was not in your way! I was just
passing by ”
Now, a
while ago I had just begun
And here you can see . .
Mv storv is done’


UT, is it really? I could say
Before I put this tale -away . .
I would like to chase a rabbit
Just to see what it would do.
And pussy-cats - my word I
I would like to chase them, tc
I haven t had much fun - nc
know
too!
- not yet
Because I'm still quite small.
But later on there won t be
I haven't done at all ... .
much
There! Non you may say it
should go on a shelf -
This story all told by a
small dog herself
But, seeing its finished - why / think that you
Will say. "Tell us, Peggy, some more now' Please do!
So. when Peggy's older and there's more to j ay ....
You 11 hear a new story - told truly this way!


Peggy told me this story but she could hardly
write it down, could she? That's all / did.
