MR JIGSAW
Mr Jigsaw was quite an unusual person.
When his wife scolded him, which was
very often, he promptly fell to pieces and
she had to put him together again. Now,
this annoyed Mrs Jigsaw exceedingly, as
sometimes her husband was so broken up
that it took her three hours to fit the pieces
together.
Once in the midst
of baking scones, he
dropped a bowl and
broke it; then his
wife was angry and
said: “Ambrose, you
are very tiresome;
you shan’t have any
scones now, and you
shall buy a new bowl
out of your pocket-
money.” As Mr Jig-
saw had only a far-
thing a month allow-
ed him, he was upset,


and with a shiver he collapsed into scraps
on the kitchen floor.
“Tch! Tch!” muttered Mrs Jigsaw.
“Why did I marry that man?”
The scones burnt, and the stove went
cold, and the butcher came in the midst
of it all. He was a
red-headed man with
a blue-coloured nose
and pink socks, and
this made Mrs Jig-
saw crosser than
ever.
“Why don’t you
leave him in bits
and lock him in a
box?” suggested the
coloured butcher-
man. “Then he
couldn’t fall to
pieces any more.”
“Go away,” she
cried. “I have quite
enough to do with
these pieces of my
husband. He is very
troublesome.”


'''^ === ]
When the butcher had gone, Mrs Jig-
saw thought this out. Then she sighed,
and slowly started fitting a head to a neck,
and a foot to an ankle; for, as she asked
herself, if she had not Mr Jigsaw, who
would chop the wood? She was a ver}^
devoted wife.
One day things be-
came very bad, for
Mr Jigsaw upset a
pie, a tart, and
eleven cookies, on to
the floor. Mrs Jig-
saw, who was a fussy
old lady, said quietly
so as not to alarm
him too much: “You
must go away, Am-
brose. You are too
troublesome alto-
gether. I can hire Mr
Flubbdub to do my
wood-chopping.”
Ambrose Jigsaw wept bitter tears,
staining the linoleum terribly; then he
said dismally: “I will find it very hard to
travel on a farthing a month.”

“I shall give you threepence,” an-
nounced his wife generously. “And a new
toothbrush, Ambrose, so please go immedi-
ately before I weep also. I cannot weep
to-day, as Mrs Fitzwoggie is coming to
55
tea.
So Ambrose departed, with his new
toothbrush, and a threepenny bit wrapped
up in a clean handkerchief. On his way
to the front gate he saw his fishing-rod,
so he put it over his shoulder and wan-
dered out.
It was a sunny
day, and birds
were calling, so
he cheered up,
and thought
what a nice time
he would have
fishing for as
long as he liked,
with never one
scolding because
of muddy feet.
So he whistled
all the way to
the river.

While he was fishing, along
came a boy, such a queer boy, for
his feet were back to front. He r
walked backwards, almost into the
water, but stopped dead and
turned right round
k/\ ttt r» a I « I A
when he saw the little
man with the strange 7^,^,
body, fishing in the ||p

stranger?’ ' y U
Mr Jigsaw look- i 1 J p|
ed up. “I hope to H
catch fish, but so
far I seem to have V \^^TV
caught only a cold
•. • • oh dear .... a-tishoooooo a-
TISH-OOOOO.”
“Very nasty,” said the boy. ‘‘By the
way, stranger, have you noticed that my
feet are back to front?’
“Why, no, not yet. Dearieodearieme.


Front.”
So they are. How very annoying. How
very odd. But then, I am odd too.”
“You do look rather . . . curious,” agreed
the Boy With His Feet Back To Front.
“What is MOST odd about you apart
from your face and figure?”
Mr Jigsaw sighed. “I fall to pieces so
easily,” he said sorrowfully. “Then I
must be put together again. My wife grew
tired of this, and sent me away. I am
Homeless, Boy With Your Feet Back To
“So am I,” an-
swered the Boy
cheerfully. “I
ran away. But
when I started I
meant to go
West, and here I
am East —all be-
cause of my toes
pointing in the
wrong direction,
of course. You
see, it takes a
brainy person to
think West, and


Go East, or think East, and Go West.
Then I have to go backwards all the time,
which prevents me from seeing much until
I am upon it. Last week I walked into a
well, and was fished out with great diffi-
culty. The week
before I stumbled
into a lion’s cage at
the Zoo.”
“What happen-
ed*?” inquired Mr
Jigsaw eagerly.
“Nothing; the
lion was not at
home.”
“Oh.”
“Now, what we
must do is to form
a company, of you,
and me, and go
forth adventuring.
What YOL T want to do is to find some
way of sticking together no matter what
happens, and what I must do is to dis-
cover some means of walking in the
direction in which I want to go. So, let us


go on, and see what we can find in the
world.”
They moved off, the Boy With His
Feet Back To Front walking backwards,
his head twisting over his shoulder every
now and again, to see the way. Once
Mr Jigsaw walked on ahead a little way,
and called: “Boy, come here.”
So the boy started towards Ambrose,
but his feet took him farther away every
moment.
“We’ll have to
do something about
this,” Ambrose said
in anger. “It is too
annoying. It hurts
me. It grieves me.
It upsets me. I feel
broken up about it.
. , . Oh, dearieo-
dearieme.”
With a shiver
that ran right over
him, poor Mr Jig-
saw collapsed into
a hundred pieces at


'
jwS^y 4 W
the Boy’s heels. Not at his toes,
for his toes were behind him,
which was rather sad when you
come to think of it.
The Boy blew
out his cheeks and
sighed. Then of
course he started
to run for help,
for what did he
know about jigsaw
puzzles which were
really living crea-
tures.
Of course the
Boy ran the wrong
way. Then he turned and tried again,
but he backed into a bush, and upon
bursting into tears and trying once
more, finally found himself where he
had started.
“The only thing to do,” he said at last,
eyeing the pieces on the ground, “is to try
myself to fit him together.”
So The Boy With His Feet Back To
Front set to work, fitting, frowning, mur-


muring, and piecing the scraps of Mr
Jigsaw. In an hour he had his body right.
In two hours his legs were fixed. In three
hours his head was on, but alas, when he
stood up it was the wrong way about.
“Now you have
your head back to
front, and I my feet,”
said the boy. “If
we walk arm in arm,
surely we will be
able to travel bet-
T*' -v ter.” So they tried,
<=? $/. \> Alas! Something
terrible happened,
> for Mr Jigsaw’s feet
went AWAY from
his nose, which
pointed East, and
the Boy’s nose went AWAY from his
feet, which pointed West. J here was a
great deal of commotion as they sorted
themselves and each other out from the
dust on the ground. With a bumped nose


the Boy said dismally: “It doesn’t seem
to work.”
“Oh, dearieodearieme . . .” and before
the Boy could move, Mr Jigsaw had
shivered, and a strange expression stole
over his face. Then .. . woe of woes
Mr Jigsaw
was nothing
but a puzzle
again, in pieces
on the grass.
It was sunset
when he was
himself once
more, but this
time his head
was on the
right way
round. “It
feels much more comfortable,’' Ambrose
Jigsaw said with a slow smile. “It felt
very queer to see the back of my jacket
instead of the front.”


‘That’s how I am always,” stated the
Boy. “At least, nearly the same. We
MUST try and alter it, Mr Jigsaw.” Mr
Jigsaw looked very hopeless as they
walked on. Now,” said the Boy again,
“if you were ordinary, your wife would
have you back, which is much better than
wandering round
the country-side.
What do you
think about it?”
“I don’t like
chopping wood,”
admitted Mr
Jigsaw. “But I
do like a nice
little house and
my meals cooked
for me.”
“Well, come
on, and see what
we can do to-
wards it.”


For seven days
they travelled, and
for seven nights
they slept under
haystacks and fences
and hedges. By this
time they were be-
coming rather rum-
pled, and the three-
pence had gone long
ago.
One day they came to a tall building
with smoke coming out of a high chimney.
There were sounds of saws buzzing, and
a great smell of fresh timber.
‘Let us go in,” suggested the Boy With
His Feet Back To Front.
So there being nobody about, they
walked in, and saw rows of Tin Soldiers,
French Dolls, Dutch Dolls, and dolls
which had no name at all. They saw
wooden stools, wooden lambs, and wooden
men, and numbers of lead horses, soldiers,
and tents.

“We seem to be in a toy-factory,” said
Ambrose. “It was in a toy-factory where
I first became what I am. Before that I
was ordinary, and even when the landlord
came for the rent, I remained whole.
When in the toy-
factory long ago, I fell
by mistake into a big
machine which was
cutting sheets of wood
into coloured jigsaw
. puzzles, and alas, it
cut me into a jigsaw
puzzle too. I came out
of the other end of the
machine in a hundred
oddly shaped pieces,
and the toy-workers
spent the whole day
fitting me together. I
went home, and then went forth on an
adventure, for a jigsaw man is not a
comfortable person to have in a house
with five brothers and ten sisters. I was


I 11 j
jBl* TpyiL /Wm It-

afraid of being broken again, very soon.
Alas, Boy With Your Feet Back To
Front! I fear this place has not very
happy memories for me."
“Never mind, come on
through the building,”
replied the Boy. “We
might find something
interesting and helpful
there.”
“We might,” replied
Ambrose doubtfully.
The Boy looked alarmed.
“You won’t fall to bits
again just yet, will you?”
he asked.
“Oh, no. I am sure I
shall not.”
So they went into the
biggest part of the building, where a
number ot men and boys were making
toys of many odd shapes and hue. They
walked past rows ot dolls and fish and
elephants and tigers, and crocodiles and
camels and dromedaries and other beasts


all made from wood. Then they came to
a big machine which was being fed with
wooden sheets, painted with scenes.
“THAT," said Mr Jigsaw with a
shudder which made the Boy very alarmed,
“was where I fell in, and THAT, where
I came out.’'
The men took no
notice of them as they
strolled through.
They were so used to
strange creatures,
you see.
Suddenly the Boy
paused. A tall man
with a pink beard
was sticking together
some large pieces of
an animal which, as
he w r as arranged, they
saw was Felix the
Cat. Felix was so
firmly stuck that
even when he fell


with a squelch to the floor,
he did not come apart.
The Boy did a peculiar
thing.
He ran at Mr Jigsaw
with Felix the Cat, and
made a loud boo-ing noise
which startled that gentle-
man terribly. “Oh,” moan-
ed Mr Jigsaw. “Oh . . .
m l
T==T
dearieodearieme . . .” and
fell all over the floor into
the shapes that the Boy had
learned to dread.
But this time the Boy did
not mind. “Quick,” he
called to the man with the
glue-pot. “Quick, stick the
bits together, hard, every time I hold one
out.”
Right, sir, said the man, and holding
his brush ready he stood at attention.
One by one the Boy With His Feet


Back To Front held up scraps of Mr Jig-
saw, the man with the glue dabbing each
piece carefully, until Ambrose stood whole
again in front of the toy-man and the Boy.
“How very tight
my bones feel to-
day,” murmured
Mr Jigsaw. “It is
rather a pleasant
sensation.”
The Boy said no-
thing of the glue
and the toy-man,
or what had hap-
pened, until they
reached the corner
of the room,
where the jigsaw
machine was work-
ing softly.
The Boy then pretended to push Mr
Jigsaw in, which was a test to see what
happened.
Mr Jigsaw shivered, then he said


plaintively; “0h... 0h...-dearie-o dear-
ieodearieme....”
To his astonishment, he did not collapse.
He shivered and shook, until there was
nothing to do but stop. Ambrose stopped,
and looked down at
himself. He was not
in pieces. He was
whole. He had been
badly frightened and
upset, yet he had not
broken up. A glad look
came over his face as
the Boy explained.
“Now,” said Mr Jig-
saw, “I can go home to
my wife. But. . . what
about you and your
feet that turn the
wrong way?”
I don’t know,” said the boy, sighing
“I really don’t know.”
As they walked through on the way out,
Mr Jigsaw had an idea. He pounced on
a woolly lamb on wheels, and wrenched


the lamb from its stand. All that was left
was a trolley, with a thick cord attached,
the wheels firm and strong.
“Stand on this,” cried Ambrose, “and
I will pull you. You can come home with
me, and Mrs Jigsaw will help look after
you as a reward for your noble behaviour
to-day.”
So the two went homewards again, the
Boy With His
Feet Back To
Front being pulled
along by Mr Jig-
saw, who as each
mile went by,
found himself
more of a man.
“I am a fine per-
sonage,” he shout-
ed when within a
hundred yards
from home. “Now
I am like other
people I shall not


take any more scolding
from my wife. I shall /
not wash dishes any xQi
\ i
\ /1 <
more. I shall not. And, '* ■’ ‘A, /
I shall not chop any ■ a
more wood. No, no
more wood. I refuse to
chop wood, after my
adventures, and all
upon a threepenny bit.
Do you hear me, Boy.
No more wood shall be
chopped by Ambrose
Jigsaw/’
Is that so‘?” asked the Boy meekly.
I his new Mr Jigsaw was a valiant fellow.
“It IS so,” came the reply.
At the gate Ambrose called loudly, and
pulling the Boy, went up the path. Mrs
Jigsaw met them in the lobby, her face
not at all pleased upon seeing her husband
home again, with a strange boy.
But when he told what had happened,


she smiled, and said that the Boy was very
welcome, and could help with the garden
to pay for his keep. They had tea, and
Mr Jigsaw asked loudly for a blue cup
and saucer and a
cushion at his back.
The Boy rose
and got them,
walking backwards
with his head
turned over his
shoulder. Mrs
Jigsaw’s face was
very prim, and she
said nothing at
all.
Suddenly, when
they had finished
their meal, the
good lady looked
into the grating of the oven. “Ambrose,”
she called firmly, “I am out of wood. Go
and chop some at once.”


And Ambrose Jigsaw sighed, looked at
the Boy, then looked at his wife, and said
Guess what he said?
He said: “Yes, my dear . . . how much?"
