Blue Montains
ISSUED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS.
PRICE 1/-


The new Walk across the Blue Mountains.
In issuing this booklet, descriptive of the enchanting ‘Hew IDalk across the ‘Blue (Dountains, the ‘Railway
Commissioners invite special attention to the fast and frequent train services available to Gourists for visits to these world-famous
mountain resorts. Ghese train services are fully set out in the ‘Railway ‘Public Gime-table, a handy work of reference
indispensable to train travellers.
It will be seen that the ‘Tlew IDalk can be traversed readily, even in one day, by a selection of convenient trains,
any one of which will set down Gourists at any chosen station, from which they may visit any one or all of the beauty spots
of the fflew tOalk, via the roadways shown on the key diagram presented herewith.
It will be noticed, for instance, that by leaving Sydney on lOeek-days or Saturdays by the Caves Express at
10.35 a.m., arriving at Eawson at 12.6 p.m., sufficient time should be available for Gourists to walk the new route as far,
say, as Section “P,” where a splendid camping site is available at the bottom of the valley, and either camp at this spot
for the night, or return, if desired, via Plaxland Road, to IDentworth Palls Station, where the Caves Express, leaving at
7.34 p.m., would be available to enable Gourists to return to Sydney on the same day, arriving at 9.15 p.m.
In this train, and certain others, refreshments are obtainable, and seats may be booked free of charge. Other
combinations of travel can be devised conveniently, and the whole journey will be greatly appreciated by those who love the
open spaces and delightful surroundings.

THE NEW WALK.
LAWSON TO
MOUNT VICTORIA.
In connection with the bulk supply of electricity by the
Railway Commissioners of New South Wales to the Blue
Mountains Shire Council, a high-tension transmission
line erected between the Commissioners’ power station
at Lithgow and substation at Lawson, a distance of
28 miles, was officially placed in service on Ist July, 1931.
The line has been erected along, or in close proximity
to, the Great Western railway between Lithgow and Black-
heath, and across rugged virgin country, almost in a
direct line, between Blackheath and Lawson. The dis-
tance along the latter section (12 miles) is 4 miles less
than the distance by rail.
All timber within 50 feet of the line has been cleared
as a protection from bush fires, and access along the line
has been made easy for the Chief Electrical Engineer’s
maintenance staff by the construction of graded tracks
and the erection of bridges over creeks.
The line passes many natural beauty spots for which
the Blue Mountains are famed, and, incidentally, a unique
tourist walk has been established simultaneously with the
completion of an important engineering undertaking. The
idea was recently conceived of increasing the popularity
of the Blue Mountains as a tourist resort, by giving
publicity to the walk as a new scenic attraction. To assist
in achieving this object, it has been decided to publish this
guide, in which endeavour lias been made, with the aid of
pictured representations, to describe in some measure the
region traversed between Blackheath and Lawson, desig-
nated “ Bruce’s Walk.” This name has been applied as
a tribute to the departmental surveyor who selected the
route for the transmission line, and carried out all the
necessary survey work in connection therewith. At the
instance of the Blue Mountains Shire Council, the names
of some of its councillors, residents of the shire, adminis-
trative staff, and certain officers of the Railway Depart-
ment immediately connected with the work of construction,
have been associated with several outstanding beauty
spots.
The walk should make a special appeal to “ hikers.” It
is easily reached along ?nade roads or trafficable bush
tracks from Lawson, Bullaburra, Wentworth Falls, Leura,
Katoomba, Medlow Bath, and Blackheath. It leads through
a succession of mountain brooks, fern gullies, and pro-
minent peaks commanding extensive panoramic views.
Over the whole region is a dense growth of native flower-
ing shrubs which, in season, present a wealth of colouring
and fill the air with that fragrant charm which is peculiar
to the Australian bush.
Animal and bird life indigenous to the Blue Mountains
are present in greater numbers in this undisturbed region
than in the more frequented tourist resorts.
The most charming spots along the walk will be found
in the gullies, but bush lovers will observe interesting
features on every hand.
THE FEATURE OF THE WALK IS THE OVER-
HEAD TRANSMISSION LINE, ALWAYS TO BE
SEEN, AND WHICH IS A SURE GUIDE TO
TOURISTS.
LAWSON.
Commencing at Lawson, the first attraction is WILSON
PARK, situated directly opposite the Commissioners’ sub-
station. This is a delightful spot, embracing an area of
20 acres of bush land, improved by the Blue Mountains
iShire Council by the construction of paths, the planting
of ornamental trees, shrubs, and grasses, the erection of
shelter-sheds, tables and seats, and the provision of a
domestic water supply. Nestling in a natural depression
in the centre of the park, and distant approximately 300
yards from the railway station, is a fine SWIMMING
POOL 100 yards in length, 70 yards in width, and 6 to
12 feet in depth. All necessary conveniences are provided
for bathers, e.g., club-house, dressing-sheds, showers, spring-
boards, sunbaking platform, live-saving apparatus, large
enclosed safety area for children, and a measured racing
track 50 yards in length. There is also a refreshment
kiosk from which, also, bathers’ requisites are obtainable,
and a large area has been set aside for the parking of
motor-cars. The park is named after Councillor Percy
Wilson, the President of the Shire, at whose instance both
the above work and many others in the shire were initiated
and developed.
BULLABURRA.
Passing Wilson Park the transmission line follows along
Hay-street to pole No. 305 in Wallis-street, where a track
turning sharply left follows a gentle descent into
WALKER’S GLEN, which is distant three-quarters of a
mile from Bullaburra Railway Station along Bullaburra-
road, and a short length of bush track. Open spaces, shady
trees, and good drinking water make this a natural picnic
and camping ground within fifteen minutes’ walk from
the station. Forty yards north along the creek is a small
cave suitable for temporary shelter in an emergency.
From Walker’s Glen the track ascends a hill to pole 300.
A bush road, trafficable by car, leads to Bullaburra from
this point, the distance being three-quarters of a mile.
Descending the hill onward from pole 300 (section “A”),
CLAIRE GLEN, named after the wife of the Shire
President, a picturesque spot at the junction of two creeks,
is approached. Here the track winds among overhang-
ing rocks, tall blue gums and giant tree ferns. A feature
of this and other gullies crossed is the bird life, which is
not apparent along the ridges. Good drinking water and
camping sites are available in the glen.
The track then zigzags up the hill through a mass of
ferns and undergrowth to pole 299, from which point
striking echoes are obtained facing eastward.
From pole 298 the track leads into PODGER’S GLEN
(section “B”), a secluded narrow glen walled in by pre-
cipitous mountain sides clad with a luxuriant growth of
a native flora. A bridge is crossed just below the junc-
tion of two crystal brooks, bordered with a mass of beauti-
ful ferns and tall coachwood and sassafras trees, whose
overhanging foliage interlaced with vines provide sheds
and shelter to the ferns and mosses below. The water
here is good for drinking, and there is sufficient shelter
for a small party under an overhanging rock nearby
(western side, about 50 feet north of bridge).
WENTWORTH FALLS.
Ascending the western side of Podger’s Glen (past
WILSON’S PEST, which overlooks the glen from a pro-
minent point halfway up the mountain side), the high-
lands are again reached at pole 297. From this point a
car road leads to Wentworth Falls Station, distant 2 miles.
■.Continuing along the walk the grade is fairly level to
pole 295. Here the track hears to the right into BUR-
GESS GLEN (section “C”). From the glen it turns
back to the left and follows upward for some distance
along the foot of a line of cliffs to a bridge crossing a
rapid stream, swishing over water-worn holes and boulders.
On each side of the creek are precipitous cliffs. The walk
through the glen is a pleasant one, and good views are
obtained from all points along the track. After crossing
the bridge the track curves round a number of huge
boulders up a fairly steep gradient to MILLER’S LOOK-
OUT near pole 294. A permanent supply of good drink-
ing water is available in Burgess Glen, and several caves
adjacent to the track on the eastern side of the glen would,
if required, afford temporary shelter.
From Miller’s Lookout onward along SKARRATT’S
TRACK to LEE’S VIEW (pole 289) the gradient is
easier. From Lee’s View a fine panoramic vista is obtain-
able, extending away as far as the heights north of Syd-
ney and the sandhills at Botany Bay. In the foreground
the lowlands beyond Penrith are seen, and on a clear day
the Sydney Harbour Bridge can be discerned with the
naked eye.
Onward from this point the transmission line has been
erected along Lawson View road and Lurline-street, Went-
worth Falls, to pole 279. Thence it crosses .ASHCROFT
CANYON and FRANKI’S GLEN (between poles 277 and
276). From pole 276, FORREST LOOKOUT, a pano-
ramic view similar to that from Lee’s Lookout is obtained,


whilst on the left Mount Hay and Mount Tomah are to
be seen shrouded in a light-blue haze. Tourists are
advised to take the road turning to the left at pole 282
and thence along Blaxland-road to Forrest Lookout, as
no track has been made across Ashcroft Canyon and
Franki’s Glen.
From Forrest Lookout to Medcalf’s Lookout (pole 2G5)
the route is mainly along Blaxland-road.
MEDCALF’S LOOKOUT overlooks Heffernan’s Valley,
and from here a comprehensive view of the transmission
line is obtained as it sweeps across the valley in long
symmetrical spans to Gloria Lookout. Tourists intending
to proceed onward from this point are recommended to
retrace their steps back to Blaxland-road, turning to the
right and at a point one-quarter of a mile towards Leura
following the track leading to the right off Blaxland-
road. This will provide easy walking to pole 262. From
here the track bears to the right and curves around a
steep, rocky spur which slopes into a clear mountain
stream flowing through HEFFERHAH’S VALLEY (sec-
tion “D”), This stream comprises excellent drinking
water, and higher up the slopes of the valley suitable
camping sites will be found. Boy Scouts or other parties
requiring extensive camping space should specially note
this. Those fond of rambling will delight in exploring
the stream down among beautiful pools, miniature cas-
cades, moss-covered rocks and clumps of ferns nestling in
shady nooks. Overhead the towering blue gums add to
the surrounding beauty and provide shelter to the ferns
below. About 200 yards down the stream from the bridge
is a RATURAL SWIMMIRG POOL containing crystal
clear water and a sandy bottom. Opposite the bridge just
above the creek bed on the western side is a good shelter
cave.
Leaving the creek the track continues on to Gloria
Lookout at pole 259. The gradient to this point is fairly
steep, but if the tourist proceeds quietly over this region
he may hear or see the Lyre Bird, noted for its beautiful
tail and extraordinary powers of mimicry, this valley being
one of its most favoured haunts.
LEURA.
GLORIA LOOKOUT, named after the daughter of the
Shire President, is one of the highest points of observa-
tion. Looking eastward an expansive view across the
Dividing Range is obtained, Eastwood to Botany Bay
being visible along the horizon. From this point a traffic-
able bush road (Mount Hay road) connects with the Great
Western road at the Leura Public School, distant about
2| miles.
Proceeding onward from Gloria Lookout past
MAIDER’S VIEW (looking west from pole 258) and
ROSS DELL (looking north from pole 252) a tract of
very barren country is crossed, the soil being too poor in
places to support timber growth.
Good water and shelter are available near pole 255, and
there is a large area in this locality suitable for camping.
From pole 252 a good bush road on the left connects with
the Mount Hay road leading to Leura.
GRACE’S GLEH lies between poles 252 and 251. It
comprises a broad, exposed gully, the lower part of which
is either timberless or sparsely timbered with stunted gum.
A permanent supply of good drinking water is available
in Govett’s Leap Creek, which flows through the glen.
Some clear pools and small cascades are to be seen along
the creek.
KATOOMBA.
From pole 248 on the eastern side of DELAHEY’S
VALLEY (section “ E ”) onward to Green’s Lookout is
one of the most delightful sections. A winding path leads
into a deep walled gorge through which flows Katoomba
Creek. Along the creek are many beautiful pools, fan-
tastically shaped rocks and numerous varieties of ferns.
Beyond the ferns are stately blue gums and stringy-bark
trees intermingled with a thick undergrowth of wattle and
other flowering shrubs. In the background is a precipitous
line of cliffs forming an almost impassable barrier.
THE WATER IR KATOOMBA CREEK IS ROT
SUITABLE FOR DRIRKIRG, but if the creek is fol-
lowed upward along the eastern side a small stream of
good drinking water will be found about 150 yards from
the bridge. On the opposite side of the creek, and 50
yards from the bridge, there is a good shelter cave.
MEDLOW BATH.
After crossing Katoomba Creek the climb is steep in
places until GREER’S LOOKOUT is reached, about
70 yards to the left of pole 247. From this point a fine
view across the valley is obtained, and the head of
Katoomba Creek is seen glistening in the sunlight as it
flows over a stretch of bare rocks. Lower down its course
is broken by the famous Minne-lla-Ha Falls, which can
be clearly seen from this point. To the left of the falls
is a long line of those perpendicular cliffs for which the
district is famous, forming a crescent-shaped bay in the
mountain side.
From Green’s Lookout the track gently ascends, bears
to the right near pole 244, meeting- the transmission line
again near pole 240. Here a more fertile tract of country
is encountered, and a multifold variety of wild flowers
and a wealth of beautiful foliage are its outstanding fea-
tures. The visitor may be fortunate enough to catch a
glimpse of a few kangaroos, now practically exterminated
in the more frequented tourist resorts.
BLACKHEATH.
If the tourist desires to return from this point the road
straight ahead leads to Medlow Bath Station. It is traffic-
able by car, the distance being 2J miles. If it is intended
to continue along the walk, turn sharply to the right along
the bush track, distant about half a mile from pole 240
towards Medlow Bath. This track, which is trafficable by
car, meets the transmission line again at pole 231, the dis-
tance thereto being about half a mile from the turn-off.
Alternatively, the transmission line may be followed from
pole 240. There is no made track along this route, but
the walking is fairly good, being along a gentle slope
downwards to the GRATED CARYOR (section “F”).
At the bottom of the canyon a track will be seen crossing
the transmission line and following along the creek. The
tourist has the choice of two tracks leading to Blackheath
from this point. Turning sharply to the left and following
up the creek, the walk is a delightful one, passing the
famous Wall’s Cave, where the creek flows underground.
A shorter route is along the transmission line track. This
turns to the right along the creek for a short distance,
then crosses the creek and zigzags up the hill to Evans’
Lookout road. If it is desired to see more of the Grand
Canyon and Reate’s Glen, the tourist should continue
along the track following the creek downwards.
At Evans’ Lookout road turn to the left for Blackheath,
which is distant about 2J miles along a made road.
From Evans’ Lookout road onward nothing of special
interest is to be seen. The transmission line continues
onward to Cleopatra-street, thence through the town of
Blackheath, joining the Great Western road about 1 mile
beyond Blackheath Railway Station. From here onward
it has been erected in close proximity to the railway line,
terminating at the Power Station, Lithgow.
In connection with this introduction to Bruce’s Walk
it might be mentioned that no comparison is made of its
merits as a scenic attraction with those grand, majestic,
and world-famous lookouts to be seen elsewhere on the
Blue Mountains. The new route, however, possesses a
charm of its own and offers 12 miles of delightful walking
over a little known region, which will be greatly appre-
ciated by walking enthusiasts and picnickers, especially
when the wild flowers are blooming. The roadways lead-
ing to the route of the transmission line, shown on the
key map in the folder, are all available for motor-cars,
providing easy access for picnickers to the pathways of
the valleys shown on the coloured diagrams.
To those who are unable, or are disinclined, to walk the
full length of the route, it is suggested that a selection
of one or two of the valleys be made for picnicking. The
tourist can, of course, make a short circuitous walk,
starting from any of the railway centres shown on the
key map, passing along the roadway to the transmission
line, thence via the valley or valleys desired, and returning
to an adjoining railway station. The road distances are
shown on the key map, and fingerposts liberally installed
at various points throughout the route and at branches off
the Main "Western road.
