Scene from “King Henry V’ — (Shakespeare.)
This scene comes after Burgundy’s great speech on the uselessness of war
and of the dire need for the blessings of peace. The French and English
lords are going to discuss the peace treaty, and the Princess Katharine is
following, when the scene opens with Henry asking the French King to
leave her with him. That she shall be his wife is one of the chief conditions
of the treaty.
