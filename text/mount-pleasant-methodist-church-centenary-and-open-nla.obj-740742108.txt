and OPENING of the NEW CHURCH


Foreword
The Evangelical Revival of the 18th Century had deep
roots in the lives of the people in Cornwall. A century later,
many of their descendants migrated to the Ballarat goldfield.
Some settled in the canvas-town at Mount Pleasant where they
erected their tent Bethel on the site of the present Church.
Their sincere piety, evangelical fervour, and moral force
made a deep impression upon the community. Others as well
as their descendants entered this spiritual inheritance. Conse-
quently, the century of this Church is marked by periodic
revivals, decisive victories in the battle with the liquor traffic;
generous support to charitable institutions; and unstinted giving
to meet Church building costs.
Many of these saints have gone on before. We gladly
and proudly honour their memory.
“Great the heritage they left us,
Great the conquests to be won.”
What of the future? We possess the message which alone
can save men and women today, and bring true and lasting peace
in our time.
Let us be worthy followers of our predecessors and our
Master Jesus Christ, and carry into the new Church the same
love, loyalty and devotion. Only so can we make a vital
impact upon the community in which we live.
In the preparations for the centenary celebrations our
Church organisations have enthusiastically co-operated with
the Trustees. A warm welcome awaits all who are able to
join us on this great occasion.
Albert Briggs, Minister.

SINGING CORNISHMEN FOUNDED
MOUNT
PLEASANT
CHURCH
The singing miners from Cornwall, good
Wesleyans all of them, in April 1855 uprooted
the slab walls, folded the canvas roof of their
chapel on Clayton’s Hill, Ballarat, and strode
off to Mount Pleasant.
They did this for two rea-
, Isons. The first!, because the
Gravel Pits diggings located
where the Girls’ School now
stands—were attracting min-
ers from the Clayton’s Hill
area. The second, their desire
to join a Cornish community
settled in the tent s at Mount
Pleasant.
The Cornish Wesleyans at
Mount Pleasant were worship-
ping in a tent brought from
Pennyweight some months be-
fore. The Rev. Theophilus
Taylor, the Ballarat circuit
minister, a great organiser busy
shepherding his flocks into
more cohesive groups, is said
to be responsible for convinc-
ing the men of Clayton’s Hill
they would be better off spirit-
ually (and financially) at
Mount Pleasant.
At any rate, one thing is
certain, the new arrivals, per-
haps 60 in number, were an
inspiration to the Wesleyans
with the canvas chapel.
Everyone went to work. Be-
fore the Clayton’s Hill men
pitched their own tent dwell-
ing places, the slab walls were
built around the canvas
church’s site and the big
spread of canvas was pegged
to the slabs.
Fijced seats replaced the
rough benches of hand sawn
planks; and, in less than 48
hours from the moment work
began, the remarkable Theo-
philus had preached his first
sermon in the church to a con-
gregation of one hundred
souls.
AT MIDNIGHT
Typically this was at 10.30
p.m. Hie people were still
singing hymns at midnight.
Not only on Sunday, but
every day in the week, they
came to worship in the slab-
sided chapel with the canvas
roof in a pleasant setting over-
looking verdant hills and the
Yarrow ee.
They came to prayer meet-
ings, society classes, Bethel,
and choir practice, dressed, in
their favorite red shirts, mole-
skin trousers and Wellington
boots; and around their mus-
cular middles they sported wide
red silk sashes. And alas, they
say their women were drab!
They came to worship in
song; for if the parson, or the
preacher, was overlong with hi.'
sermon, a basso voice would
softly begin the refrain of a
hymn and then the whole con-
gregation would join in to con-
found the nuisance.
Singing Tradition
Always the old records;
newspaper files and minute
books, souvenir brochures and
tales handed down through
the years, tell of the wonder-
ful singing at Mount Pleas-
ant, of the choirs and their
masters, of the songs and
their singers. This is a tradi-
tion that still stands to-day
as an inheritance from the
harmonious miners from
Cornwall.
The first of Mount Pleas-
ant’s famous choir conductors
vas Mr Jonathan Shaw, ‘‘his
ihoir consisting altogether of
male voices, having the assist-
ance of a number of wind in-
struments.”
Mr W. J. Sampson, com-
poser of the anthems, so well
’oved, so often sung to-day,
‘The Strain Upraise” and
‘Across the Bar” was at one
time the church organist.
A baritone soloist who ach-
!eved fame in London, Mr J.
Prout, was once a choir mem-
ber.
Associated with the choir for
forty years, and leader for 17
years, Mr T. V. Vawdrey, is
"•est remembered by the older
church members, to-day.
During the church’s jubilee
■■elebrations, 40 years ago, the
wonderful soprano voice of
Florence Roberts, so impressed
a "Courier” reporter that he
made himself a music critic,
stealing space from the Rev.
°ercy Watsford’s sermon which
hould have been reported ver-
batim.
The same Florence Roberts
will lead the Mount Pleasant
hoir at Easter for the centen-
ry celebrations. Now Mrs
■*ryor, she has in the past,
been successful at South Street
This is the fifth church built for Mount Pleaant Me[?]odists coun[?]ng the first

on Morton st directly in front of the 90 ycar old Italian style building The first

md still sings with splendr
mice.
Outgrown
Before the end of 1855 the
rude chapel became too small
and unworthy. Willing’ vol-
untary hands added a tran-
sept of slabs with a canvas
roof.
Then, in 1856, up went a
tradesmen-built church. It
’/as of timber and had a shin-
le roof.
About this time the locality
vas infested with grog shan-
ies. The characters, men ana
vomen, who went there did
lot suit the temperate Corn-
shmen. Encouraged by the
iling but militant Rev. Theo-
ihilus, the men from the Mt.
Peasant Church, equipped with
•righteousness and brawny
irm,” trampled down the shan-
ies, cracked a few skulls, and
mjoyed numerous minor bat-
les, “which battles resulted in
i decisive victory for temper-
nce and righteousness.”
Since when the "drink traf-
fic” has never flourished in
VTount Pleasant. No hotel or
icensed place has yet been es-
ablished there.
Kindly People
The Wesleyans of Mount
Pleasant were kindly and
charitable people. A Dorcas
Society was formed from
the beginning. Old people
were cared for, clothed and
fed and sheltered. A meet-
ing of the society brought
about the founding of the
Benevolent Asylum, now the
Queen Elizabeth Benevolent
Home.
Until 1938 the Sunday School,
which last year celebrated its
centenary, had three superin-
tendents in 70 years. Three
'ovable characters were Dan
Berriman, C. W. Growcott and
Arthur Coates.
John Brittain, PRAS, long-
time health inspector and ob-
servatory keeper, will be re-
membered as a vigorous and
erudite lay preacher, and as a
'•ontributor of articles on as-
tronomy to "The Courier” for
nany years.
, On Tuesday, March 21, 1865,
he Rev. James Waugh, sup-
rintendent of the Ballarat cir-
cuit, president of the Wesleyan
Conference, laid the founda-
icn-stone for a new church.
According to the report ap-
pearing in “The Ballarat Star,’’
he following day, “the names
f Messrs Champion, Skewes,
Frathan, Opie, Berriman.
Slight, J. s. Trethowan, C. C
Growcott, and Cant. Morton
nay be mentioned with honor
w active men connected with
he building.”
The descendants of some oi
hese men are still at Mount
Pleasant, and actively connect-
ed with the building of the
church to replace the one of
10 years ago.
Mr George Morton, town
lerk for many years, is a
grandson of the Capt. Morton
isted in the report.
Great Occasion
The ceremony must have
been a great occasion for old
Mount Pleasant. This was
to be a substantial church of
bluestone in the Italian style,
with seating room for 800.
The famous Joseph A. Doane
was the architect.
Messrs Buley and Scott were
he builders. Their tender was
for £550, exclusive of interior
fittings. The new church just
ouiit will cost about 15 times
as much.
That great day for the pion-
eers, still battling for a liveli-
hood in a strange land still
writing nostalgic letters to their
folk in Truro and Bodmin, Lis-
keard and Tregony, now put-
ting down permanent roots of
community worship, was hot
and sunny. And the heat had
everyone bothered even the
reporters, who wrote:—
“But there was no provision
made for the maintenance of
order . . . the gentlemen offi-
ciating were rushed, and only
a dozen or two of the specta-
tors could see what was goin r
on, while some of the people
both male and female, were s
rude as to engage In such lour !
talking under the very nose o’
the Speakers, that cn one oc-
casion the minister celebrant
had to call them to order.
“The circumstances we have
nentloned, and the fact that

was provided for the reporters
nust be accepted as an explan-
ation of any omissions in oui
report of the proceedings.”

The resident Church Minis-
ter, Rev, A. Briggs, recognises
that the inspiration of Mount
Pleasant’s pioneers can do
nuch to revive Methodism in
-he district.
“Their sincere piety, evan-
gelical fervour, spiritual gaiety,
jubilant singing and moral
force made an impact upon the
community,” says Mr Briggs.
‘The big congregations we ex-
pect will come back to Mount
Pleasant at Easter will remem-

and we hope will wear the
mantle of their spiritual vital-
ity.”


CHURCH DIAMOND JUBILEE.
CELEBRATED AT MT PLEASANT.
RECORD OF SIXTY YEARS.
I Sixty years ago, when Ballarat was
the most part bush, and very little per-
manent settlement had taken place, some
wanderers from the Old Land pitched,
their tenst at Mount Pleasant, and began
in a modest, but none the less sincere,
way to establish the Methodist Church,
which has gradually developed and ex-
tended its inuflence until it now holds an
honored place in Methodism in this cen-
tre. The golden jubilee of the church
was celebrated yesterday, and eonld those
of the early days who took the most pro-
minent part in establishing it have seen
the transformation that has taken place
they would have marvelled at it. Only
one of the early worshippers, as far as is
known, is alive to-day, and be—Mr Peter
Blight—has resided at Mount Pleasant
continuously, and is still able to' attend
the church. The first place of worship
was a large tent, which was followed b.y
a structure of slab walls, with firmly
fixed seats. The district gradually be-
came better populated, and as the ad-
herents of the church increased m num-
ber more and better accommodation be-
came necessary, and a wooden church
iwas erected. The congregation and the
church continued to prosper, and 50 years
ago the construction of the present sub-
| stantial stone church was entered upon,
j and it was in the church that yesterday's
[services were held. Such, briefly, is an
outline of the evolution of the Mou.it
Pleasant church, and it is interesting to
note that the name —Mount Pleasant —by
which the district is known was said to
have been suggested in the first place by
Messrs Roach, Thomas, Caddy, and Moyle
During the 60 years the church has been
in existence its activities have been
many. It is claimed that the Ballarat
Benevolent Asylum originated at a rpeet-
ing of a Dorcas Society formed at Mount
Pleasant, and in many other directions
the present-day adherents are worthily
carrying out the best traditions that ani-
mated the founders. Throughout its ca-
reer it has had faithful ministers and
workers, but few of the original band
are left. Amongst those who may be
mentioned in addition to Mr Blight, and
who are taking part in the cel eh rat ions,
are Mrs Caddy, who was the first lady
married in the present church; Mrs Eus-
tace, who attended the first anniversary
(held in a tent); and Mrs Opie, who is the
only one now living ot the five who laid
foundation-stones of the handsome brick
school erected in 1807. Other well-known
and honored names amongst the pioneers
were represented by their descendants,
also active workers, such as the Tre-
thowans, Dunstans, Growcotts, and many
others; whilst every generation of wor-
shippers was represented by the gather
ings yesterday, as many old Mount Plea
sant residents. now r in other parts, made
an effort to be present. The present
minister, the Rev. A. P. Watsforcl, is de-
servedly popular. He is a forceful and
sincere preacher of the evangelical type.
IHe has been at Mount Pleasant for two
years, and although he lias been sought
after by other circuits he has accepted an
invitation to stay at Mount Pleasant an-
other year, which means that he has
two more years to run. Reference to the
history of the church would be incom-
plete without mention of and
the faithful service it has rendered under
its conductor, Mr T. V. Vaw-drey, who
never spares himself, and who lias done
splendid work.
The jubilee services commenced on Fri-
day with a Methodist love feast, which
was somewhat of a novelty to most people,
hut which was a very successful function.
Ye-sterdav three services were held, and
the church was crowded. The decora
tions, which were ca.rried out under the
supervision of Miss Dunstan, were verv

who were entering upon a new era in
their church life wanted to realise the
consolation, hopefulness, and power
manifested in the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.
The afternoon preacher was the Rev.
G. A. Judkins; whilst the Rev. A. P.
Watsford conducted the service in the
evening. The subject of his address was

taken from John .iii., 16— “ For God so
loved the world that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish, but have ever-
lasting life.” They began the celebra-
tions, he said, with a love feast, and
the whole record of the past 60 years had
been a manifestation of God's love to
them. A preacher might select some
texts to show his cleverness. He hronght
God the heathen failed to realise. They'
had idols for almost everything; but it
had been said that amid all the myriads
of idols, there was not a living God.
Christ came to sweep away all loveless
idols, and to proclaim One God, “Whose
name is Love.” The author of the
book, “Christ and Christian Ex-
periences, showed how intimately
the verse of the text was associated with
the verse in Ephesians referring to the
breadth, depth, length, and height ot
God’s love. How wide was it, and how
many would it embrace? They knew
something of the narrowness of human
affections. The Jews failed to realise
God’s love. They limited salvation to
one race. The early Christians failed
to realise it, and it needed a thrice-re-
peated revelation to convince St. Peter

artistic, and flags of the Allied nations
were prominent The Mayor of the
Town (Cr X. Pearce), an old member of
the church), and the councillors; and the
Mayor of the City (Cr R. Pearse), also an
old Mount Pleasant worshipper, were pro
sent in the morning, and the super in ten
dent of the circuit (the Rev. It. Bayles/,
who conducted the service, extended to
them a cordial welcome on behalf of the
people.
The sermon was based upon Philippians,
iii., 10: “That I may know Him, and
the power of His Resurrection.” The Eas
ter message was, he said, specially appro
priate in connection with tlie jubilee ser-
vices, because the fact of Easter had full
significance for the Christian Church
There would have been no church with-
out it. If Christ had died on the Fri-
day and had not risen, the Christian
Church would have been impossible.
Jesus Himself would have been almost
forgotten except by a few followers. Paul
praved that ho might know tho power of
the” Resurrection. There wens some
truths that were held, but did not assert
themselves in an emphatic way.
Bunyan referred to some truths
as “bedridden truths. Wesley wou.d
repudiate ' emphatically inat any oc
lesiastieal movement he instituted had
anything to do with a new theology.
He tried to re-emphasise, reinforce, and
reinvigorate old truths. Paul desired
not that the Philippians should really
know the fact of the resurrection, but
that they should know the power of the
fact, and that it should be real, vital,
and fruitful in life and experience. If
a man knew tbe power of the resurrec-
tion he was likely to know something of
the consolation it afforded. The Church
had failed in its ministry if men had not
found consolation. If they knew the
power of the resurrection they wookl
also know something of the inspiration
of hope. The message of Easter was the
message of, hopefulness. It was the final
triumph over suffering, and the triumph
of right. They were learning that at
the present time. Why were the young
men of the churches and the community
hurling themselves into the fray? Was
it not because of the right. Finally,
just R> know the resurrection was to
know the assurance of its power. They
material to the words he had chosen, and
the sermon might eclipse the text; but
there were passages of Scripture that
stood absolutely alone. There was no
need to bring material to them. They
contained far more than the most pro-
found and eloquent preacher would ever
be able to get out of them. That was so
with the text he had chosen. It was the
sum of the Gospel, the essence of the
New Testament, the greatest revelation
the Bible knew, and God’s love was con-
tained in it. It was a fact concerning
REV. A. PERCY WATSFORD.
that God’s love was for the Gentiles as
well as for the Jews. Because the early
Church failed to realise the breadth of
God’s love, missions languished, and
mvriads died who never knew that God
was love. It was a fact doubted to-day.
Thev could not doubt God’s wisdom and
power, but they did doubt His love. Why
did they fail to surrender themselves to
Him? Wherever sin was, love was, and
sin was world-wide. Into the darkest
lands where men might go, the love of
God had gone before. Love was the
greatest thing in the world. It was a
never-ceasing stream. To what length
would the love of God go? Was it mere-
lv a general sentiment of goodwill, some-
thing which caused God to give easily
without cost? God’s love called forth
the supreme act of self-sacrifice. He gave
His Own Son. Who died a most shameful
and humiliating death upon the Cross.
His love could go no further. How deep
could God’s love go? Thy had known
something of human love that seemed to
reach the lowest depths, but the love of
God went beyond that. It went down
to those who were in the horrible pit and
the miry clay. What was the height to
which God’s love lifted one? Lave was
"of various kinds. There was the love
that ennobled and cast a radiance over
life, and there was the love that dragged
the lover down to hell. The love of God
lifted and ennobled. Love demanded
love. Nothing else could be given in ex-
change for it, and because of God’s won-
drous love for them, their love was de-
manded in return.
During the day the choir, which num-
bered nearly 40 voices, sang the anthems,
“Now is Christ Bisen” (West), “Praise
the Lord, O Jesusalem” (Hall), soloist
Miss R. Sublet; “They Have Taken Away
My Lord” (Stainer), “I Will Call” (Mo-
zart); “Pilgrim’s of the Night” (Nicholl),
soloist Miss Roberts: and “Worthy is the
Lamb (Handel). The singing was excel-
lent. Miss Tuxen presided at the organ.
The collection and proceeds through-
out the Jubilee will be divided between
the Belgian Fund and the church.
To-night thei’e r#ll be a devotional
meeting at 7.30 o’clock, and to-morrow
night a high tea will be held, followed
by a reunion.




A Brief Historical Survey
A number of Cornishmen, transferring from Clayton Hill to
the tent-town of Mount Pleasant, had their Church brought across
and re-erected on the site of the present Mount Pleasant Church.
The first services at Mount Pleasant were held in a structure of
slab sides and canvas roof in Apiil, 1855. Miners attended services
in red shirts, moleskin pants, red silk sashes and Wellington boots—
a loud contrast to the milder colours worn by their women folk.
Two years later, this edifice was replaced by a wooden building
with a shingle roof; it had seating accommodation for 200.
The Rev. J. S. Waugh laid the foundation stone of the bluestone
Church on 21st March, 1865; it was built to accommodate 300. Of
this ceremony “ The Ballarat Star,” March 22nd, 1865, reported that
“Some of the people, both male and female, were so rude as to engage
in such loud talking under the very nose of the speakers, that on one
occasion the minister celebrant had to stop and call them to order.”
(Talkative friends please note.)
During 1914-18, the last of the big gold mines in the district
closed down. Consequently, many families moved from Ballarat.
In 1949 the Trustees decided to start a New Church Building-
Fund and Rev. R. W. Uren, resident Minister at the time, subscribed
the first £l.
On 28th February, 1954, the foundation stone of the new Church
was laid by the Rev. A. D. Lelean who had worked wholeheartedly
and effectively to swell the Building Fund.
SUNDAY SCHOOL
The first school rolls date from January, 1855, and the school
was held in the tent Church and later in the wooden Church. The
first Sunday School building was erected in 1876 and replaced by the
present one in 1907. The Sunday School centenary was celebrated
on 12th December, 1954.
Few Sunday Schools have had so few Superintendents in a
century’s history. The terms of three occupants of that position cover
a period of 70 years—Mr. D. Berriman, 25 years; Mr. C. C. Growcott,
20 years; and Mr. A. Coates, 25 years.
CHOIR SINGING
The first conductor was Mr. Jonathan Shaw, whose choir
consisted of male voices. This Church has always been noted for
its singing, and for vigorous singing no choir has excelled Mount
Pleasant.

MT. PLEASANT CENTENARY:
From Canvas Church
To Brick Veneer
Mount Pleasant Methodist Church is
celebrating its centenary during the Easter
week-end.
In the history of a church
100 years Is no great span, be-
cause In Christendom the
church Is ageless. Generations
enter and leave through the
broad doorway and each gener-
ation in its time plays many
parts. But, as George Herbert
said, ‘•‘Nothing lasts but the
Church.”
Mount Pleasant’s history is
old for Ballarat. It covers the
day of the tent and the slab-
sided chapel and the bluestone
“Italian style temple,” and to-
day brick veneer.
Saturday’s celebrations, bring-
ing 300 people “back” not
counting more than 100 Sun-
day School children who en-
joyed a party in the church
grounds were a time for re-
union and reminiscence.
Mrs George Powell, aged 86
once Florence Caddy, rolled
back the years. Her father and
mother were, the first couple
married in the 90 years’ old
bluestone church now crumb-
ling. John Caddy her grand-
father was one of the founders
of the church. His sons built
the first two roomed home in
Ballarat near Tress street, for
the comfort of their parents.
Teaching in the Sunday
School in 1885 Mrs Powell re-
members the Rev. Martin Hos-
king preaching in the church one
night. "Happy” Pascoe, a local
character, was too busy with h'a
“hallelujahs,” and thus a nui-
sance to the preacher.
“Happy, if you cease to in-
terrupt me with your praises
I’ll buy you cl new pair of
breeches to-morrow morning,
said Martin Hosking.
Hallelujah!
The sermon progressed for
a time; but the preacher
was in fine form. Happy
Pascoe was moved to
.shout again, “Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord!” And then,
right on top of that, he stood
in tire pew and shouted,
“Trousers or no trousers, par-
son, I’ll still praise the
Lord."
One of the illustrious names
of old Mount Pleasant Is Grow-
cott. Mrs Mellor of Barkly
street is 85, and she was Martha
Growcott. Her father was C. C.
Growcott, a mining manager,
who came to Ballarat before
Eureka and was present when
the first service at Mount Pleas-
ant was held In a tent on the
present church site.
Mrs Mellor’s memory Is of be-
ins carried into church on her
father’s shoulders. Her sisters,
Emily and Alice, were carried
one to each hand at the same
time.
Former town clerk of Balla-
rat, Mr George Morton, remem-
bers his grandfather, a ship’s
captain, who arrived at Mount
Pleasant in 1857. Captain Mor-
ton’s name appears often in the
old records. He was church
treasurer for many years. The
street in which the church now
stands was named for him.
This sailor away from the
sea could have risen to be har-
bor master of Melbourne port,
but he chose to leave his ship
and go off to the diggings. He
and his son opened a produce
stoce in Main road, and he
built a fine home on a five acre
block in Barkly street not far
from the church.
Young John Ford of Tress
street is the fifth generation of ,
a family continuously active for
more than a hundred years as-
sociation with the church. His
great-great grandfather was
Elisha Hicks who came from the
Burra Burra copper mines in
South Australia to a tent at
Temple Gully and with his -wife,
Ann, worshipped in the first
tent church. For a long time
Elisha Hicks was the Sunday
School superintendent.
At Saturday’s reunion there
were two centenary cakes. Mrs
Mellor, the oldest resident
member of the church cut one
and Mrs Powell, the oldest liv-
ing identity, the other.
Many tales were told, faded
photographs were inspected,
flattered pages of minute and
record books were turned again;
the old songs were sung, the old
places explored; but always
the fine new church was there
to prove that Mount Pleasant
folk were not content to live
and worship in the past.
And when it was said by
an active minded “old boy”
of 80 that the food provided
by Che women of the church
for the welcome home tea was
better than any he could re-
member at the tea meetings of
long ago, there was conclusive
proof of Mount Pleasant’s
progress.
After the opening of the
new' Church in the evening by
the Rev. A. W. Pederick, pre-
sident of the Methodist Con-
ference. Mr R. T. Ritchie, a
past superintendent of the
Sunday School entertained the
children and their parents with
a programme of films in the
old church.


Well Met
In Burma
Dr. A. E. Coates, of Mel-
bourne and Mr Keitb Brown,
of Laurie street, Mount Pleas-
ant, met in Burma on Septem-
ber 13, 1943.
They came together at the
55 kilometer camp on the Bur-*
ma railway. They were both pri«
soners of war.
Mr Brown’s leg had been
eaten into by tropical ulcers
and gangrene had set in, so
Dr. Coates decided to amputate.
With a knife and a butcher’*
saw the doctor went to work.
He then stitched up, the flaps
with catgut prepared in the
camp.
Mr Brown got on well aftear
that. He was fitted with a bam-
boo leg, worked through to
Thailand, and was liberated in
1945.
Yesterday, Dr. Coates was at
the Brown home for lunch-
Dr. Coates is an old Mount
Pleasant boy and for the cen-
tenary celebrations he was
chairman of Sunday’s P.S.A.
His brother, Mr W. G. Coates,
8.A., LL.B., was the speaker.
Mr Brown lives across the road
from the church.
Seven Coates,’ all brothers
and sisters, came back to
Mount Pleasant. Their father
was Sunday School superin-
tendent for many years.
Dr. Coates and the “ampu-
tees” have an exclusive society
of their own which meets once
a year in Melbourne. Last
meeting 20 men attended.
While he was a prisoner of
war, Dr. Coates performed about
1200 amputations.


New Church Dedicated At
Mt. Pleasant
On Saturday night a new Methodist
Church at Mount Pleasant was opened and
dedicated to the glory of God and the ser-
vice of mankind by the Rev A. W. Pederick,
the president of the Methodist Conference.
A crowd of 300 gathered out-
side the church as shortly be-
fore 7 pm, Mr Pederick, the
Rev F. E. Haynes, circuit super-
intendent, and the Rev Albert
Briggs, resident minister, con-
ducted a brief servide of praise
and thanksgiving.
Then Mr Pederick opened the
doors to the congregation for
the first time saying, “For the
furtherance of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ, I open the doors
of this church.”
About 250 were able to find
seats in the church before the
dedication service began. Peo-
ple remaining outside and seat-
ed in the old church were able
to listen to the service as it
was relayed on a public ad-
dress system. Very young
children and their parents
chose to sit in the old church.
In his address Mr Pederick
said: “You have arrived at the
100 mile post after a wonder-
ful journey through history;
and now you have marked the
centenary by building this
lovely church.
“I did not know what to ex-
pect as I came through those
new doors. I was amazed. You
have built a very beautiful
piace of worship.
“In this church you will wor-
ship, and you will kneel week
by week and pray to be given
grace and wisdom to enable
you to go out into everyday
life leading lives of integrity;
strong in the faith, and in
Christian character.
Human Foundations
“In your hearts you are
thinking of the oid biuestone
church and you feel that you
are building on the founda-
tion of others; not the huge
blocks of stone, one on the
other, for they are not the
church. The people who lab-
ored for God and wor-
shipped, they were the
church.”
The church was founded
and built a hundred years ago,
the Rev Pederick said. Some
of their ancestors were the
foundations when they came to
know a personal Saviour. Life’s
real purpose and the church
had been handed on by them.
“You have done a great thing
here. In difficult times you
have given yourselves hard
work; but by your vision and
courage you have built this and
it is beautiful,” Mr Pederick
continued.
“But it isn’t the church. It’s
only a shelter symbolising the
things we believe. You are the
church, and not the bricks and
mortar.
“You have heard your call
to build your church. What
a great thing if the congrega-
tion was always this size! Bal-
larat would say, ‘There’s a
force to be reckoned with. The
gates of hell cannot stand
against that.’ You have done a
great thing.
The Call
“This may be a great his-
toric occasion. It must be
more than that, for to-night
there comes a call. These are
days fraught with great
dangers for the Christian
world. Ideas are in the melt-
ing pot, but if we can only
show forth Christ, a sceptical
and cynical world would turn
again.”
Mr Pederick spoke of the
Revs. Andrew and Norman
Pearce, who had grown up in
the Mount Pleasant church.
He said that the people were
proud of them and that they
were godly men with a depth
to their devotion that came
through fellowship and prayer.
“We need the fellowship, the
prayer and the communion be-
cause that is the recipe for
building a church this
church,” he added.
The congregation with re-
sponses took part in the dedi-
cation of the church which
was conducted by Mr Pederick,
assisted by Mr Briggs. Two
former ministers of the church,
the Revs. A. D. Lelean and R.
W. U’Ren, and Mr Haynes, as-
sisted in the seWice.
The anthem, “O God of
Abraham Praise,” was sung by
a special centenary choir un-
der the leadership of Mrs
Florence Pryor. The organist
was Mrs A. Black.


P.S.A. Speaker Says
Best Is Yet To Be
*‘The past has been splendid. If we are true to its
traditions, the best is yet to be,” said Mr W. G. Coates
speaking at the new Mount Pleasant church yesterday
afternoon.
Mr Coates, a Melbourne soli-
citor, and once an English
master at the Ballarat School
of Mines, said that with the
magic of memory we telescop-
ed the years and saw Mount
Pleasant a district fringed with
mines and the continual hum
of batteries.
"We think of the romance of
their names,” said Mr Coates.
Star of the East, Band and
Albion, Koh-in-noor, Woah
Hoap, and South Star and this
church the centre of immense
activity, with music everywhere.
Everyone sang. Cornish carols
at Christmas time attracted
people from far and wide.
“There was a centre com-
plete in itseif, y«t with cour-
ageous leaders who developed a
strong body of feeling against
social evils. This particular
community was pioneered by
adventurous spirits, weary of
frustrations in an England
stiffening from unemployment,
and lured by gold.
“And if they did not strike
it rich,” said Mr Coates, “they
found satisfactions in other
things. The local school be-
came the leading matriculation
centre in Ballarat. The
church flourished, its councils
leavened by rich Cornish wit.”
Mr Coates described how
with the closing the mines the
area of Mount Pleasant was
depopulated and the church
became a lonely outpost on the
fringes of the city. Yet, con-
tinued, Mr Coates, in the early
years of the century £ new
Sunday School could still be
built. This proved that vir-
ility was not lacking and now
a church, comely and modern,
marked the hundredth anniv-
ersary, j
“Our heritage fits us to at-
tack great problems,” said Mr
Coates. “Again the district
faces a vastly expanding popu-
lation arising from conditions
outside Australia."
Mr Coates said that within
the next hundred years it was
probable that the preponder-
ance of British bom citizens
would give way to at least an
equal number not of British
origin. All these
be made welcome. a , si g : u
“The particular ,-v,
this church to face^^^^.
people of widely differing tra-
ditions and tiie safeguarding of
Christian standards in.society,”
he said.
‘‘Thi3 new building is no
longer on a fringe of popula-
tion, and it will soon be in the
heart of a growing area. It
is no wild guess to estimate
that within the next ten years
Ballarat wiil have ten thousand
more inhabitants.
‘ Business houses in Europe
already have extensive blue-
prints for probable plants util-
ising the water and rail facil-
ities of Ballarat and district.
“Can we, as the living
church, take up the mantle of
those who gave their best for
the establishment of God’s
kingdom an earth,” he asked.
“Gan we, with our better op-
portunities, make our portion
of the new century of this
church resoundingly Chris-
tian?” added Mr Coates.
The chairman for the PSA
was Dr A. B. Coates, brother of
the speaker, and famous for
the attentions he gave to his
fellow prisoners of war on the
Burma railway.
Soloists for the afternoon
were Miss Beverley Oates and
Mr Les Robertson.
