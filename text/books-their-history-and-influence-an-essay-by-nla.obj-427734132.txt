PREFACE.
THIS publication is our first attempt in authorship, and its origin
may be explained in a few words. During 1867, while a
member of the Fitzroy Wesleyan Association, we read an essay on
the subject, the late Dr. Dare being then President of the Society.
Afterwards, it was read before the St. Andrew’s Young Men’s
Association, Carlton, 1875. This, however, was very insignificant,
embracing but a small portion of what is now published. It has long
been our desire to see something of the kind in print, and we thought
this would be undertaken by someone of greater influence and supe-
rior scholarship ; certainly the task was worthy of a more powerful
pen than ours. As, however, no librarian—either dead or living—in
Melbourne or its suburbs has attempted this, we were persuaded to
try our hand in an humble way upon the essay now published. It
first appeared in the “ Fitzroy City Press,” July 22nd, 1882, and
continued in twenty-eight weekly issues of that newspaper up to
February 3rd, 1883, when the whole was concluded. As much in-
terest was excited during the appearance of the various articles, and
many readers expressed a desire to have the work re-published in
book form, we consented to this. We hope that critics will be merci-
ful considering that, as stat6d, it is our first appearance, and we
therefore need encouragement to show that our labor is appreciated.
The work was hard, extending over nearly seven months, re-con-
structing and arranging what had been written or collected many
years since, besides exploring through numerous works for additional
facts and illustrations regarding books and authors. All this has
been done in spite of many obstacles, having an arduous business re-
quiring our attention during every day that it was written, and
sometimes almost breaking down under the pressure. Devotion and
enthusiasm alone sustained us. The work is neither so complete nor
so perfect as we could have wished, much of it being written in haste
without the necessary revision required. Such as the essay is, how-
ever, on its merits alone, it must stand or fall according to the deci-
sion of those competent to judge. It is to be hoped, however, that
now the example has been set, the various professional men having
charge of libraries in Melbourne and suburbs will come forward and
show the world in a practical way the result of their experience and
scholarship, either by writing upon this subject from their own point
of view, or giving a racy sketch of some author whom they may ad-
mire. Thus our knowledge might be extended. Our gratitude is
due to the following works which have been consulted in the compo-
sition and compilation of this essay. Any reader is referred to^thefiilT

THEIR
HISTORY AND INFLUENCE.
I) OOKS are the treasuries of knowledge and experience; they
) contain whatever genius has invented, labor discovered, learn-
ing collected and judgment arranged. Numerous praises have been
bestowed upon books. Thus, “they are represented as the refuge of
truth, which is banished out of conversation; as standing counsellors
or preachers—always at hand, and always disinterested, having this
advantage over all other instructors that they are ready to repeat
their lesson as often as we please.” The most famous men of every
age have acknowledged their obligations to books, without which
could not have attained success or distinction.
‘ ‘ The place that does contain
My books, the best companions, is to me
A glorious court where hourly I converse
With the old sages and philosophers,
And sometimes for variety I confer
With Kings and Emperors, and weigh their counsels,
Calling their victories, if unjustly got,
Unto a strict account, and in my fancy
Deface their ill-plac-d Statutes,”
We shall glance for a little at the General History and Advance-
ment of Books from the earliest times up to the present, with
statistics.
The orign of books, or writings of any kind, is veiled in great
obscurity, as they belong to a very remote period of antiquity.
What we call books in their present form, were unknown to the
ancients. Records, opinions, and histories were engraved on stone,
brick, metal, (as lead, copper and brass), wood, cloth, and skins, and
at a later period on parchment.
The earliest method of preserving narratives or inscriptions was by
engraving them on a rock. The patriarch dob is supposed to refer
to this custom when he says, “Oh that my words were now written !
Oh that they were printed in a book ! That they were graven with
an iron pen—and lead in the rock for ever.”
Josephus, the Jewish historical!, mentions that “ Seth, the son of
Adam, engraved on pillars his astronomical discoveries.”
The Ten Commandments delivered to Moses from God were
written upon stone.
Sir Robert Ker Porter, a celebrated English artist and traveller,


during this century copied some picture writing from a rock in
Media, which described the captivity of the Israelites in Babylon.
The ancient Egyptians were long famous for writing hieroglyphics on
their various temples and pyramids, all of which exhibited in a
spirited manner their arts, trades, religious ceremonies and social
usages. The bondage of the ancient Israelites is illustrated by this
means, as they are represented making bricks and doing hard labor.
For a long period there were no means of deciphering these in-
scriptions. But the mystery was at length cleared up early in this
century by the accidental disinterment of a block of black basalt at
Rosetta in Egypt. This has accordingly been named the Rosetta
Stone. It contains three inscriptions, one is in hieroglyphics, the
second in demotic or picture writing, and the third in Greek. The
last has been translated, and shows that all three are the same.
This interesting relic of antiquity is deposited in the British
Museum.
The works of Solon were carved on wooden boards. Pliny states
that lead was used for writing, and rolled up like a cylinder. “Mont-
faucon notices a very ancient book of eight leaden leaves, which on
the back had rings fastened by a small leaden rod to keep them to-
gether. The laws of the Cretans were on bronze tables; the Romans
etched their public records on brass. The treaties between the
Romans, Spartans and Jews were written on brass, and estates —for
better security—were made over on this enduring metal. The dis-
charges of Roman soldiers were written on copper plates. The speech
of Claudius engraved on plates of bronze is yet preserved in the
Town hall of Lyons in France. Several bronze tables with Etruscan
characters have been dug up in Tuscany. The Icelanders for want
of books are said to have written on walls. And Olof, according to
one of the Sagas or Scandinavian Histories, built a large house, on
the walls and spars of which he had engraved the history of his own
and most ancient times, while another Northern hero appears to have
had nothing better than a chair and bed to perpetuate his own heroic
acts upon. The ancient Arabs, it is recorded, used the shoulder bones
of sheep, on which they carved remarkable events with a knife, and
after tying them together wi!h a string they hung these chronicles
up in their cabinets.”
The Ancient Greeks and Romans made use of tables or tablets of
wood with a slight coating of wax on the surface, and employed
what was termed a stylus, like a small dagger for writing on them.
These were popularly called table books, a familiar term yet applied
to certain school books even in our day. Leaves and the bark of
trees were also used, and were often prepared with much skill. Thus
of old, men spoke literally when they talked of the leaves of a book,
a term we still apply figuratively to the component parts of our
modern volumes. Another material for book making was the inner
bark of trees, found between the bark and the wood. This bark or
rind is called in Greek Biblos (a term also given to papyrus) which
in course of time came to signify a book, and has been so kindly
naturalised in our language, as to represent the Look of books, the


Bible. The Latin word liber denoted originally the same material
for writing, in use among the Romans, and from this source we have
library and librarian in English.
The papyrus used by the ancient Egyptians for literary purposes,
was produced from the bulrush, a plant growing in abundance on the
River Nile. The fact that the papyrus was used for food when pre-
pared in one way, and for writing when prepared in another, explains
those passages of Scripture in which the eating of books and rolls is
mentioned. Our modern word ‘ paper ’is derived from this source.
Herodotus thus attests the use of the papyrus for food : “ The biblos
(or papyrus) is of annual growth, and after it is plucked up out of
the marshes, the top is cut off and turned to a different use from the
other portions. The part of the stalk that is left, about a foot and a
half in length, is sold as an edible article.”
One authority states that there are many papyrus books still in
perfect preservation, which are as old as the departure of the children
of Israel from Egypt. In the museum at Turin, Italy, there is one
said to have been written two hundred years before the birth of
Moses, and at Marseilles, in France, during 1850, an antiquarian
resident had in his possession a number of Egyptian manuscripts,
among them two papyrus rolls containing the wars of Sesostris,
written during that prince’s lifetime.
The skins of beasts were early and extensively used in bookmaking.
Homer’s Illiad and Odyssey were written on serpent skins. Parch-
ment, or prepared sheepskins, was first manufactured at Pergamos,
a city of Mygia in Asia Minor, about two hundred years before
Christy - It is largely in use, as a material for writing, even at the
present time, particularly by gentlemen of law. But although
parchment originated as stated, yet, the art of preparing and colour-
ing skins was known in the age of Moses, and in all likelihood the
Pentateuch was at first written on this soft and flexible material.
These were prepared in the form of long rolls twelve to fourteen
inches wide and fastened at each end to sticks (like the rollers to
which maps are attached), and which were rolled till they met mid-
way. From this mode of shutting such books by rolling them to-
gether, and of opening them by a process of unrolling, is derived our
word volume, a term from the Latin which signifies something to be
rolled. Sometimes these leaves were connected in the form of
modern books, and opened in the same way. The sides of such a
book were protected by wooden boards, and so we now apply the
same designation to the outer covering of our books, whatever may
be the material of which it is made.
But an extraordinary revolution was at hand in connection with
books. Paper, the great material for printing upon in modern times,
was first invented by the Arabians, and made from cotton early in
the Bth century, but it was several centuries before the art spread to
the other parts of Europe. Thus during the 12th century the
Spaniards were the first European nation to whom the invention was
communicated, who in turn gave it afterwards to the Italians,
French, and Germans. It was a long time after this, however, before


the art was introduced into England. English manuscripts on paper,
made from linen, have been discovered, bearing date 1340, but this
was of foreign manufacture. The first paper mill in England was
erected by John Tate, jun., at Stevenage, Hertford, 1495, and from
then we find no record of another till 1588, when Speilman, a Ger-
man jeweller, erected one at Hartford, in Kent, and received much
encouragement from Queen Elizabeth, the reigning monarch. But it
was not till 1713 that one Thomas Watkins, a stationer, brought the
art of paper-making to any perfection, and was the means of causing
paper mills to be established over England. Tn 1770, the celebrated
.1. Whatman established fine paper-making at Maidstone, Kent, being
another development of the manufacture. The art of paper-making
has since arrived at a high degree of excellence, the English paper
being the finest in the world, both for writing and printing upon.
At one time it was feared that the supply of linen and cotton rags
would fail to meet the demand for paper, but numerous substances
have since been discovered as substitutes. Thus, in the British
Museum, and the Society for the Encouragement of Arts in London,
may be seen books containing upwards of sixty specimens of paper
made from different materials. Some of these substances are as fol-
lows : the bark of the willow, beech, aspen, hawthorn, thyme and
mulberry, the stalks of nettle, the common thistle, cabbage stalks,
moss, wood shavings and sawdust, potatoes, straw, rice, and Indian
corn. Even so far back as the year 1850 it was estimated that Eng-
land imported linen and cotton rags from Italy, Sicily, and Hungary
to the extent of 5,000 tons annually, at a cost of <£22 per ton, and
since that time the consumption has largely increased with the spread
of population.
It is to paper that we are indebted now for the ready multiplica-
tion of books, but until the discovery of the noble art of printing in
the 15th century this advantage was not so clearly seen, and scarcely
any advancement made. The first book printed from movable types
was a Latin Bible, printed during 1450 and 1455 by Guttenberg, at
Mayence. in Germany. The first book in our language was “ The
History of Troy,” printed by William Caxton, at Cologne, 1471, and
in 1474 he issued the first book ever printed in England, which was
“The Game and Play of Chess,” translated from the French into
English. The first English book illustrated with wood-cuts was a
second edition of the same work. Caxton is said to have printed and
published 65 literary works, from the time be began the art till
death. His last work was “ The Art and Craft to Know How to
Hie,” and he was engaged upon this until the last day of his life.
Caxton, in the course of his labors, not only printed but translated,
though far advanced in years, to the extent of fully 5,000 pages
closely printed. He died at London in 1491, aged 80 years.
I lefore the invention of printing it was rather a serious matter to
make up a book, and consequently they were much more valuable
than those we have at the present time. Thus Guido de Jars, an
Italian ecclesiastic, commenced to write and illuminate the Holy
Scriptures, in the year 1244, and though he labored diligently and


patiently, it was not completed till 1294, he being then 90 years old.
Who can estimate the value of such a book 1 It is still preserved in
one of the greatest libraries, and fearful anathemas have been pro-
nounced by the ecclesiastics against all who would dare to steal or
destroy the smallest portion.
In 1270 a Latin Bible was sold for <£3o, and at that time money
was so valuable that two arches of London Bridge were built for a
less sum, the wages of a good laborer being then only 3d. per day.
At that period a book was the most valuable deposit which could be
given for the loan of money or any other obligation. “ For the pos-
session of a manuscript book some would transfer an estate, or leave
as security for its Joan hundreds of pounds, and the sale or loan of
a book was considered of such importance as to have been solemnly
registered by public acts.” It is recorded that one of the early kings
of England gave 1,200 acres of land for one book, “The History of
the World,” also that the Countess of Anjou (France), gave 200
sheep, besides a large quantity of grain for a volume of homilies or
sermons. “ A student of Pavia, who was reduced to poverty by his
foolish excesses, raised a new fortune by leaving in pawn a manu-
script book of law ; and a grammarian who was ruined by fire re-
built his house by means of two small volumns of Cicero.” What a
contrast to the value of literary works now !
Some curious facts are mentioned regarding different manuscript
books. The works of Quintillian were found under a heap of rub-
bish at the tower of an 1 talian monastery. “ The most valuable copy
of Tacitus (of which much is wanting), was discovered hid in a mon-
astery at Westphalia. It is a curious circumstance in literary his-
tory that we should owe what we have of Tacitus to this single copy,
for the 1 Roman libraries in which the works of Tacitus were pre-
served were all destroyed, and nothing of them remains. It some-
times happened that books were found in the last agonies of existence.
Thus the works of Agobart were found in the house of a bookbinder,
who was in the act of using the leaves (parchment) to line the covers
of his books. A page of the Second Decade of Livy, it is said, was
found by a man of letters in the parchment of his battledore while
amusing himself in the country. He hastened to the maker of the
battledore, but arrived too late, the man had finished the last page of
Livy about a week before.”
“Sir Robert Cotton one day at his tailor’s discovered that his man
was holding in his hand, ready to cut up for measures, an original
Magna Charta document, with all its seals and signatures. He
bought the singular curiosity for a trifle, and recovered in this man-
ner what had long been given up for lost.” Thus to accidental
discoveries like these we owe many literary works of antiquity.
St. Paul’s churchyard was once the most celebrated mart for books.
The London booksellers of olden times had their shops at all the
principal entrances to the old cathedral, while some of them were to
be found within the building itself.
In the early part of the 16th century, books and paper were sold
only at stalls or sheds, and thus the dealers in these articles were


designated “stationers,” to distinguish them from those who travelled
about. Little Britain (so-called from the Duke of Bretagne having-
lived there), was another great bookselling place, Mackay, in his
tour through England in 1724, thus describes it: “ The booksellers
of ancient books in all languages are in Little Britain and Paternos-
ter Row; those for divinity and classics in the north side of St.
Paul’s Cathedral; law, history, and plays, about Temple Bar ; and
the French booksellers in the Strand.”
Paternoster Row was so called because of the text-writers who re-
sider there, and also the turners or paternoster-makers who made
and sold rosaries during preceding centuries. This afterwards suc-
ceeded in becoming the great book market instead of Little Britain.
The famous bookselling and publishing firm of Longman and Co.,
began business at Paternoster Row about 1729, and many other
booksellers of eminence held their sway there, some of whom have
their representatives even in the present day. In the early part of
this century it was estimated that 800 books and pamphlets were
regularly published every year in London, the greater part being
issued from Paternoster Row. The annual returns from the printing
and selling of these books were not far short of a million, and those
trades furnished employment to nearly 2000 persons.
Previous to the invention of printing, there was not such a rapid
increase or diffusion of literature as we find in modern times. It is
estimated that 50,000 books or distinct works were published in the
17th century in Europe, the principal portion of which was religious
publications or translations from the classics. During the 18th cen-
tury 80,000 works were published, being and increase of 30,000 over
that of the 17th century. The works issued during the 18th century
were of a more mixed character than those of the previous one, con-
sisting, as they did, of voyages and travels, science and art, besides
works of fiction, all of which were comparatively unknown before
that period. It is impossible to state with accuracy how many books
have been published in the world since the invention of printing, but
the number must be something overwhelming. During 1860 it was
estimated that between four and five thousand different publications
were issued in Great Britain, and that upwards of 50,000 different
books were published in all parts of the world every year, thus giving
no less than 1,000,000 dintinct works every 20 years. One authority
writing in 1850, says, “A century ago the amount expended on
books and periodicals in Great Britain did not exceed £IOO,OOO,
whereas the sum now expended annually is estimated at £2,100,000.”
How immensely must the business of bookmaking have multiplied
since then, when we find that in 1871 there were 5157 different
works published in Great Britain, and 4991 in 1873, the chief part
of these being issued from London alone.
In the early days of printing, even the best authors received but
comparatively little for their works, and probably the first books
printed in England brought their authors nothing beyond an increase
of reputation, This arose partly from the small number of intelli-
gent readers who could afford to purchase books, and partly from


the want of any law affording protection to copyrights. If anything
printed became popular, it was sure to be pirated by others, especially
in case of small books, a large folio presenting difficulties which
frightened the printers and deterred them, from the task. It may be,
therefore, that the prevalence of folios for so long a period was in no
slight degree due the tricks of unscrupulous printers.
After so much has been said about printing, we take the liberty of
including the following effusion, cut from a newspaper many years
since, the author being anonymous.
THE SONG OF THE PRINTER.
“Pick and click goes the type in the stick,
As the printer stands at his case ;
His eyes glance quick, and his fingers pick
The type at a rapid pace ;
And one by one as the letters go,
Words are piled up steady and slow—
Steady and slow,
But still they grow,
And words of fire they soon will glow ;
Wonderful words, that without a sound
Traverse the earth to its utmost bound ;
Words that shall make
The tryant quake,
And the fetters of the oppressed shall break ;
Words that can crumble an army’s might,
Or treble its strength in a righteous fight.
Yet the type they look but leaden and dumb.
As he puts them in place with finger and thumb ;
But the printer smiles,
- And his work beguiles
By chanting a song as the letters he piles.
With pick and click,
Like the world’s chronometer, tick ! tick ! tick !
O, where is the man with such simple tools
Can govern the world like I ?
With a printing press, an iron stick,
And a little leaden die,
With paper of white, and ink of black,
I support the Right and the Wrong attack.
Say, where is he, or who may he be,
That can rival the printer’s power
To no monarchs that live, the wall doth he give ;
Their sway lasts only an hour ;
While the printer still grows, and God only knows
When his might shall cease to tower !”
In the history of books much interest, and even amusement, is
connected with Bibliomania, or the passion for collecting enormous
heaps of books, without any intention of reading or studying intelli-
gently. Rare editions of books, issued by old printers, are in some
cases looked upon as worth their weight in gold.
Sir Walter Scott has drawn the following printed portrait of a
bibliomaniac to perfection, in his novel The Antiquary. “ The codec-


tion was indeed a curious one and might well be envied by an amateur,
yet is was not collected at the enormous prices of modern times.
Mr. Oldfield took a pleasure in the personal labor of forming his
library, at the expense of his time and toil. He was no encourager
of that ingenious race of middle-men, who, trafficking between the
obscure keeper of a stall and the eager amateur, make their profit at
once by the ignorance of the former and the dear bought skill of the
latter. When such were mentioned in his hearing he would tell the
stories of “ Snuffy Davy ” and “ Caxton’s Game of Chess.” “Davy
Wilson,” he said, commonly called Snuffy Davy, from his inveterate
devotion to Black Rappee, was the very prince of scouts for search-
ing blind alleys, cellars, and stalls for rare volumes. He had the
scent of a slow-hound and the snap of a bull-dog, he would detect
you an old black letter ballad among the leaves of a law paper, and
find an editio princeps under the mask of a school Corderius. Snuffy
Davy bought the “ Game of Chess,” dated 1474, the first book ever
printed in England, from a stall in Holland for about two groschen,
or twopence in our money ; he sold it to Osborne for twenty pounds,
and Osborne sold this inimitable windfall to Dr. Askew for sixty
guineas. At Dr. Askew’s sale, continued the old gentleman, kindling
as he spoke, this inestimable treasure biased forth in its full value,
and was purchased by Royalty itself for one hundred and seventy
pounds. Could a copy now occur, Ido not know how great would
be its ransom, and yet it was originally secured by skill and research
for the easy equivalent of twopence sterling. Happy, thrice happy,
Snuffy Davy, and blessed were the times when thy industry could be
so rewarded. (This anecdote is a real fact, and Snuffy Davy was a
well-known person.) See this bundle of ballads, not one of them
later than 1700, and some a hundred years older, I wheedled an old
woman out of them for some tobacco and snuff. For that mutilated
copy of the “ Complaynt of Scotland,” I sat out the drinking of two
dozen bottles of strong ale with the late learned proprietor, who in
gratitude bequeathed it to me by his last will. These little Elzevirs
arc the trophies of many a walk through the Cowgate and Cannon-
gate, amongst the miscellaneous vendors of things rare and curious.
While the old gentleman continued in this manner, the visitor had a
good view of the collection. Here were editions esteemed as being
the first, and there stood the scarcely less regarded as being the last
and best, here was a book valued because it had the author’s final
improvements ; one was precious because it was a folio, another be-
cause it was a duodecimo, some because they were tall, others because
they were short; the merit of this one lay in the title page, of that
in the arrangement of the letters in the word ‘ Finis.’ There was, it
seemed, no peculiar distinction, however trifling or minute, which
might not give value to a volume, provided the indespensable quality
of scarcity or rare occurrence was attached to it.”
Amongst those books which have a special value in the opinion of
literary men, may be mentioned the beautiful and portable editions
of the Greek and Latin classics, issued by the celebrated printers of
Amsterdam and Leyden (Holland), during the 17th century, the fine


Greek Testaments of Jansen, another printer of Amsterdam, during
the 16th century, and the numerous classics printed by Aldus Manu-
tius at Venice towards the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th
century, and any books issued by Caxton, the first English printer.
Prominent among curiosities of this kind are the following, preserved
at the British Museum, London : The first Bible with a date, printed
in Vellum at Mayence, Germany, 1474 ; Grammar of the Greek Lan-
guage, date 1476, the first book printed in Greek characters ; JEsop’s
Fables, printed at Milan, about 1480, first Greek classic printed;
Cicero’s Offices, by Faust and Schoeffer, 1465 ; Euclid’s Elements of
Geometry, (in Latin), Venice, 1482; The Works of Virgil, Venice,
1501, the first book printed in italic type. One of the earliest books
of travels, and the first illustrated with folding plates, Mayence, 1486.
The earliest book in which engravings are found is a copy of “Dante, - ’
printed at Florence, 1481. These, with the others before-named, are
in the British Museum. The late Duke of Roxburgh purchased the
editio Princeps of Boccaccio, printed at Venice, 1474, for £IOO.
This book was so rare that its existence was doubted ; at the sale of
the Duke’s library in 1812, the Marquis of Blandford, and the Earl
Spencer, contested for the purchase, the bidding rising finally to
£2,260, at which price it was sold to the Marquis of Blandford, who
put it into his pocket and walked away in triumph. Among the
books'sold was a copy of the “ History of Troy,” being the first work
printed by William Caxton in English, for which £1,060 10s. was
paid. At the same sale, two other volumes printed by Caxton were
bought by Earl Spencer for £245. Napoleon I. sent an agent to this
sale to purchase rare works.
Besides these celebrated book collectors, there was Richard Heber,
famous wherever books are known, he had immense libraries at
Paris, Antwerp, Ghent, Brussels, Oxford, York-street, London,
Pimlico, London, (where he lived), besides other places, all crammed
with curious and rare books. To obtain books for his libraries he
would set out on a journey of several hundred miles, any day, in
search of a book not in his collection. Probably the greatest book
sale in the world was that of Heber’s, at London, in 1864, the num-
ber amounting, as reported, to 146,827 volumes, and the catalogue
itself filling 5 thick volumes. The sale occupied 216 days, and the
amount realised was £55,000. The collection cost the original owner
£IBO,OOO from first to last.
In one author we find the following information. “ A bibliognoste
(from the Greek) is one knowing in title pages, colophons, and
editions, the place and year when printed, the presses when issued,
and all the minutse of a book. A bibliographe is a describer of
books and their literary arrangements. A bibliomane is an indis-
crimate accumulator who blunders faster than he buys, cock-brained
and purse-heavy. A bibliophile, the lover of books, is the only one
of the class who appears to read them for his own pleasure. A
bibliotaphc buries his books by keeping them under lock and key, or
framing them in glass cases.”
Some books have a special value attached to them from the fact of


their having been in the possession of great authors or famous men
who have left their autograph on the title pages, or literary notes on
the margin of the leaves. Southey, the late poet laureate of England,
was passionately addicted to this practice, as also Coleridge and
Wordsworth, and numerous volumes are in the possession of literary
men and book collectors which contain many effusions, both in prose
and verse, including opinions, written on the margin of their books.
In 1864 all the books belonging to the late W. M. Thackeray, the
great English author, were sold by auction at London. One of the
nooks was a copy of Ainsworth’s Latin Dictionary, which he used
when a schoolboy, containing the autograph “ W. M. Thackeray,
Charterhouse School, July, 1827,” this volume, which might have
been worth Is. Gd. on any ordinary bookstall, real Led <£4 155., and
was carried off with great glee by the purchaser. A course of
mathematics (by Hutton), with Thackeray’s autograph, realised
£3 10s. A “Christmas Carol,” presentation copy from Charles
Dickens, inscribed “ W. M. Thackeray, from Charles Dickens, whom
he had made very happy, etc.” For this little book, an ordinary copy
of Mr. Dickens’ story, there was a most exciting competition, and it
was at length sold for £25 10s., Queen Victoria being the purchaser.
We shall conclude this part of the subject with the following curious
lines written by a literary lady of the 18th century.
A BOOK.
“ I’m a strange contradiction, I’m new and I’m old,
I am often in tatters, and oft decked with gold ;
Though I never could read, yet lettered I’m found,
Though blind I enlighten, though loose I am bound ;
I am always in black, and I’m always in white,
I am grave and I’m gay, I am heavy and light.
In form too I differ, I’m thick and I’m thin,
I’ve no flesh and no bone, yet I’am covered with skin ;
I’ve more points than the compass, more stops than the flute,
I sing without voice, without speaking confute ;
I’m English, I’m German, I’m French, and I’m Dutch,
Some love me too fondly, some slight me too much ;
I often ilie young, though I sometimes live ages,
And no monarch alive has so many pages.”
A singular feature in the history of books is that of literary for-
geries or impositions, which have been been palmed off upon the
world. It was long believed that the first English newspaper was
printed in 1588, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a copy being
deposited in the British Museum, but the researches of antiquaries
towards the middle of this century proved it to be an unquestionable
forgery printed about 1766, although no clue could be obtained as to
the object which those who wrote it had in view.
George Psalrnanazar, believed to have been a Frenchman by birth,
created quite a sensation in the literary world during the last century,
by bringing forward a descriptive account of the Island of Formosa
and its inhabitants, their religion, manners, and customs. He also
invented a new alphabet qnd language, a grammar, and division of


the year into twenty months. When a version of the English cate-
chism was made into the pretended Formosan language, it was pro-
nounced hy some of the first scholars to be grammatical and a real
language, from the simple circumstance that it resembled no other.
On his book of travels being issued, it became famous far and wide,
the first edition sold at once, but shortly afterwards doubts were
expressed as to its truth, some inconsistences having been detected in
the work. A lively controversy was kept up for years, but, even-
tually, the author repented of his imposition, and made a full confes-
sion, to be printed after his death. Psalmanazar was a favourite in
literary circles, being a brilliant speaker and genial companion; even
the great Dr. Johnson esteemed him highly, and spoke of Psalmanazar
with respect. He died in 1763.
Thomas Chatterton, a native of Bristol, born 1752, brought before
the world a collection of manuscript poetry and histories said to have
been written by Thomas Rowley, a monk of the 15th century, and
his friend, Mr. Canynge, a Bristol merchant of the same period.
These compositions exhibited genius of a very high order, but, it
being doubted whether the writings were so ancient as stated, some
literary men, after an examination, pronounced them to be forgeries.
Chatterton afterwards endeavoured to obtain subsistence by his pen
in London, but failed miserably, and after neglecting to take food for
two or three days, put an end to his sufferings by taking poison. He
died 1770, when little more than 17 years old.
“ Chatterton, the marvellous boy,
The sleepless soul that perished in his pride.”
The poems of Ossian, assumed to have been translated from the
Celtic language by James Macpherson, a poet and literary character
of the 18th century, are now generally admitted to have been for-
geries, Macpherson being the attributed author himself.
Another notable case was the Shakespeare forgeries. Towards the
latter end of the 18th century literary antiquaries were startled by
the pretended discovery of a mortgage deed drawn up and signed by
Shakespeare. The moving spirit in this affair was a young man
named Ireland, son of a publisher in London, whose father had an
intense enthusiasm, almost amounting to idolatry, for anything
written by Shakespeare. The mortgage deed was merely written by
the young man for a freak, but it did not end thus, for his father
and friends insisted that, as he had found this, he must be aware of
other Shakespearian relics. At length they became so exacting, that,
to save himself from importunity, and perhaps exposure, he produced
“ Shakespeare’s Profession of Faith,” and some letters, all of which
passed muster, and in many instances, documents produced as being
200 years old had scarcely been in existence two hours. The next
production was “ Yortigern and Rowena,” said to be an original play
by Shakespeare, and which was actually brought forward at Drury
Lane Theatre, London. In the meantime, theatrical critics and
authors were busy, and, the trick being discovered, it was resolved to
crush the play on its first appearance; this was done, the exposure


being a most complete one. Mr. Ireland, junior, afterwards con-
fessed himself author of all the writings in question.
Mother Shipton was a real character who lived nearly 400 years
ago in England during the reign of King Henry YII. Her prophe-
cies are still believed in by many, especially among the uneducated
or half educated classes in the old country. “ This prophetess is
supposed to have been born at Knaresborough, and tradition says
that she sold her soul to the Devil for the power of foretelling future
events. During her lifetime she was looked upon as a witch, yet she
escaped a witch’s doom, and died peacefully in her bed, at an extreme
old age, near Clifton in Yorkshire.” The following epitaph was
written on her tombstone.
“ Here lies she who never lied,
Whose skill often has been tried ;
Her prophecies shall still survive,
And ever keep her name alive.”
The prophecies of Mother Shipton were generally a vague unmean-
ing jumble of seeming predictions, applicable to no special event, and
without point or interest. In 1641, a pamphlet of her verses were
printed in London, and in 1677, there was issued “Mother Shipton’s
Life and Curious Prophecies.” In 1862 Mr. Charles Hindley, of
Brighton, England, published, what was said to be, an exact re-print
of a chap-book version of Mother Shipton’s prophecies from the
edition of 1648. In this, for the first time, there was special appli-
cation, modern discoveries being plainly described, and one prophecy
which began “ Carriages without horses shall go,” setting forth the
railroads, telegraphs, steamers, and other inventions of the 19th
century, concluded thus
‘ ‘ The world to an end shall come,
In eighteen hundred and eighty-one.”
This was somewhat startling to those who read the book, for of
course numbers were sold, but literary critics doubted, and upon com-
paring the new version with the different editions in the British
Museum, it was discovered that a fraud had been committed and
fresh matter added which could not be found in the original text.
The result was that, under great pressure, Mr. Hindley wrote a let-
ter to the newspapers confessing that he had fabricated the prophecy
quoted, and ten others in order to render his little book saleable.
Eighteen hundred and eighty-one has come and gone, yet the world
exists still, and will last, if the astronomers are to be believed, for
myriads of ages in the future. And so ends this foolish attempt to
fix the end of the world.
The trials and misfortunes of authors' form an interesting chapter
in the history of literature. One distracted genius has left on record,
“ Let no man be trained to literature alone, for it will not bring bread
to him. Fallacious hopes, bitter disappointments, uncertain rewards,
vile impositions, and censure and slander from their oppressors are
their lot, as sure as they put pen to paper. With a fortune to sus-


tain or a profession to stand by, it may be bad enough, but without
one or the other it is foolish as alchemy and desperate as suicide.”
Simon Ockley, author of “A History of the Saracens,” said ho
was writing the lives of others, but could not afford to live himself.
Cervantes, author of “ Don Quixote,” and the chief genius of
Spain, lived in great poverty, and often wanted bread.
Camoens, a Portuguese poet, and author of “ The Lusiad,” living
in the 16th century, was shipwrecked and lost all his property except
the MSS. of his poem, which he held in his left hand while he swam
to the shore with his right. He afterwards died of starvation in an
hospital at Lisbon.
Tasso, the great Italian poet, was reduced so much at one time that
ho had to borrow a crown from a friend to provide food during the
week. He had also the misfortune to be imprisoned for a long period
in consequence of writing love sonnets, and while in prison wrote his
great work “ Jerusalem Delivered.”
Spencer, the child of fancy, and author of the “ Fairie Queene,”
languished out his life in poverty and misery. His house was sacked
and burnt, during a rebellion in Ireland, while living at Cork, and he
was deprived of his estates by the rebels, 1595. He died in 1599.
Sir Walter Raleigh wrote his famous “ History of the World”
while imprisoned in the Tower of London for 11 years.
John Bunyan wrote his celebrated book “The Pilgrim’s Progress,”
during an imprisonment of 12 years in Bedford Gaol.
John Milton, born 1608, died 1674, was imprisoned for some
months in connection with political troubles, and after being libe-
rated lived poor and forgotten. His immortal poem “Paradise Lost”
was composed after this, when he became blind, a favorite daughter
writing it at his dictation. The work was sold afterwards for £lO.
While he lived it was coldly received, but about twenty years after
his death the poem began to be famous, and continues still in the
front rank of English critics.
Anthony Urceus, a great scholar of the 15th century, had the
whole of his MSS. burnt in his study ; he went mad immediately after.
Ben Johnson’s unpublished work “The Execration of Vulcan,”
together with the fruits of 20 years study were destroyed in an hour.
Several literary men have risen from their death beds to destroy
their MSS. Collardeau, a poet, did this, and Mrs. Inchbald caused
her biography to be destroyed in her last moments.
Sir Isaac Newton, the famous philosopher, on entering his study
one evening, found that his little dog Diamond had leaped upon the
table and overturned a candlestick with a lighted candle, which
ignited a number of manuscript papers and calculations, so that the
labor of 20 years was destroyed in a few minutes.
Corneille, the great French dramatic writer, had a present sent
from Louis XIV., and was found at the time of the money arriving-
dying in his house for want of nourishment.-
Rushworth, author of “ Historical Recollections,” was imprisoned
and spent the last years of his life in gaol.
Dr. Edmund Castell spent a great part of his life in compiling his


“ Lexicon Heptaglotton,” on which he bestowed incredible labor, and
expended on it no less than £12,000, broke his constitution, and ex-
pended his fortune; at length it was published but the copies
remained on his hands unsold.
Racine, the celebrated writer of French plays, died broken-hearted,
caused by reading an adverse criticism on one of his works.
Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the great Irish orator and dramatist,
was almost always in difficulties, caused by his dissipated habits, and
had the baliffs about his dying chamber, who would have carried him
off in his blankets to the debtor’s prison had not death stepped in
and closed the scene. In fact, he died so deeply in debt that even
his body, being arrested, was not allowed to be buried till the obliga-
tions were paid by friends or others.
Collins, author of the sublime “ Ode to the Passions ” and other
poems, having no friends, was for some years reduced to the lowest
state of destitution and want, and suffered such agony of body and
mind that permanent insanity was the result, and although assistance
came and money was provided for his life, it came too late, as the
poor distracted soul had not the reason left to enjoy it. lie died at
the early age of 36.
Richard Savage, one of the minor English poets, was reduced to
such a state of destitution that he often wanted food, and was com-
pelled to write his poetry in the streets on stray bits of paper picked
up, and had to borrow pen and ink to write with. Savage led a very
irregular and miserable life, ending his days in prison.
Dryden, the great English poet and translator of Virgil, was in
needy circumstances for a period.
Charles Lamb had a sister, who in a fit of frenzy stabbed and
killed her mother, being for a time confined in a mad-house. After-
wards, the brother had the sister released, taking charge of her at 22
years of age, and for her sake abandoned all thoughts of love and
matrimony, devoting his life and energies to keeping her comfortable.
Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great English essayist and writer of the
Dictionary, had to suffer many trials for a considerable time, and
sometimes had to Avant a dinner being Avithout the money to buy it.
His famous English Dictionary appeared in 1755, and five years
aftenvards, Avhen Johnson was 52 years old, his literary patrons,
determined that he should not die in poverty after having served his
country so well, obtained for him a pension of £3OO per year. On
this sum, combined with other small returns from his writings, John-
son sheltered and supported five other friends, who Avithout such help
would have sunk to ruin and starved.
Oliver Goldsmith, author of “The Vicar of Wakefield” and “The
Deserted Village,” Avas a most unfortunate man, being frequently in
debt, and sometimes, like Johnson, having to do Avithout a meal. It
is recorded that after writing “ The Vicar of Wakefield ” Goldsmith
was on the point of being arrested and imprisoned for debt by his
landlady, but, Dr. Johnson appearing just in time, went to a book-
seller and obtained GO guineas for the book, which was so little
thought of at the time that it Avas kept for two years before being


published. Afterwards, on becoming better known, Goldsmith re-
ceived £2OO for his selections of English poetry. It has been observed
with great probability that he wrote the famous nursery tale of
“Goody Two Shoes,” published originally in 1765, at which time
Goldsmith was engaged composing all sorts of little boi ks for his living.
After Thomas Hood, humorist and poet, was told that his heart
was affected, and that all literary occupations would only aggravate
the consumption with which he was troubled, such were his necessi-
ties that he still wrote on; some of his most humorous pieces being
the work of a fast declining invalid propped up with pillows in his bed.
Cowper was sometimes seized with tits of insanity, and on one
occasion attempted to drown himself.
During the last century some of the best works went begging from
publisher to publisher. Thus Prideaux’s Connection of the Old and
New Testaments was tossed about from hand to hand between five
or six booksellers for two years before it found a purchaser, and the
author was gravely told by one publisher that the work was too dry,
and should be enlivened with a little humor to make it popular.
The late Thomas Carlyle when writing his celebrated work the
“ French Revolution,” unfortunately lent the entire MSS. of Yol. 1, to
a literary friend, whose servant mistook it for waste paper, using the
sheets each day for mending fires until it was all consumed. Carlyle is
stated to have felt like a madman on receiving intelligence of the loss,
and his remedy was to abandon all severe thought and read Captain
Marryat’s novels for three months, until his mind recovered from the
shock. He then set to work and wrote the volume over again.
What was at first a pleasure and enjoyment, became a vexatious and
agonizing task, as the book had to be re-composed a second time with
little possibility of its being the same as originally written.
But the most curious case of literary misfortune recorded, was that
of a Church of England clergyman named Davy, living during the
18th century, having a stipend of £-10 per year. This gentleman
published 6 volumes of his sermons by subscription, but adverse
circumstances operating, instead of being remunerated he remained
indebted to his printer above a hundred pounds. Not being dis-
couraged by this, he pursued his literary researches and completed a
larger work, but could get no bookseller to publish it as the cost of
printing would have been £2,000. Determined not to be defrauded
of the honors of authorship, Mr. Davy resolved to print the work
himself. He constructed his own press, purchased some worn and
cast off types, and acting as his own compositor and pressman, print-
ing only one page at a time; after 13 years of unremitting labor
he had the gratification of bringing his extraordinary undertaking to
a conclusion. The book, when finished, extended to no fewer than 26
volumes octavo of nearly 500 pages each. He next bound all the
copies with his own hands, after which he proceeded to London and
deposited one in each of the principal libraries there. This curious
book may be seen in the British Museum.
We shall give one more example concerning the trials and mis-
fortunes of authors, which is rather conflicting in its character, illu§-


trating both goo<l and bad fortune in one, but as a striking moral may
be drawn from this, we include it for general information. Thomas
Paine, a notorious deistical and political writer of the last century,
was born at Thetford, in Norfolk, England, 1737, his father being a
Quaker, who followed the staymaking business. Eor a time Paine
was apprenticed to the same trade and pursued it after his father’s
death. Subsequently he became an exciseman, but was dismissed
from this for keeping a tobacco shop whilst being a government
officer. In 1755 Paine emigrated to America, where he became editor
of a magazine, in which capacity he wrote “ Common Sense,” a pro-
duction which became so popular that 100,000 copies are said to
have been sold, and in recognition of this, the Legislature of Pennsyl-
vania voted him £SOO, besides which he received the degree of M.A.
from the University of that province. He was afterwards elected
member of the American Philosophical Society, and in 1777 received
the appointment of clerk to the Committee for Foreign Affairs, but
was discharged from this for imprudent conduct in 1779. Still he
continued to be recognised by the American government, being sent
to France in 1788 for the purpose of negociating a loan, which was
successful. Afterwards he proceeded to England and engaged in a
foolish scheme for building an iron bridge, which failed, and involved
him in debt. Paine, while in England, wrote a work entitled “ The
Eights of Man” the popularity of which was so great that 1,500,000
copies are stated to have been sold in England alone, besides which it
was translated into the French language, and large numbers sold in
that country. This book was written as a reply to “ Burke’s French
Revolution,” but being of an abusive and violent character,
Paine was proceeded against by the English government for libel in
writing and publishing, not only libellous, but seditious works.
Being found guilty, and terrified at the prospect of punishment,
he fled from England secretly, and went again to France, but
was afterwards imprisoned by Robespierre, at Paris, for some offence
against that government. The Ist part of the “Age of Reason” was
published at London and Paris, 1794, the 2nd part (composed in
prison) was published in Paris and London, 1795, and a 3rd part was
also published ; a new and enlarged edition of the whole being after-
wards issued. “ Paine’s first wife died a year after marriage,
his second wife parted from him after three years experience of
wedded life, and afterwards, on visiting America, he took with him as
mistress Madame Bonneville, wife of a French bookseller, and her
two sons. Intemperate, tyrannical, licentious and profane, a torment
to himself and a terror to his household, he left the world without
repentance, and exchanged the horrors of a death-bed devoid of hope
for the infamy of a dishonored grave.”
To show the wickedtiess, injustice, and ignorance of Paine when
writing the “Age of Reason,” we give the following extract from that
work : “ I had, besides, neither Bible nor Testament to' refer to, though
I was writing against both, nor could I procure any (in Paris), not-
withstanding which, I have produced a book that no Bible believer,
though writing at his ease, with a library of Church books about him,


can refute.” From preface to second part. “ I have now gone
through the Bible as a man would go through a wood with an axe on
his shoulder to fell trees. Here they lie, and the priests if they can,
may replant them. They may perhaps stick in the ground, hut they
will never make them grow.” The manuscript of the hrst part was
submitted to Dr. Franklin, and from his reply we quote a brief ex-
tract. “ I would advise you, therefore, not to attempt unchaining the
tiger, but to burn this piece before it is seen by any other person,
whereby you may save yourself a great deal of mortification from the
enemies it may raise you, and perhaps a great deal of regret and re-
pentance. If men are so wicked with religion what would they be
without if?—Benjamin Franklin.” These words proved indeed pro-
phetic. The regret and repentance were thus expressed to an infidel
friend who was complimenting Paine on the publication of the work
after his return from America in 1802. “I am sorry that this work
ever went to press. I wrote it more for my own amusement, and to
see what I could do, than with any design of benefitting the world.
I would give worlds, had I them at my command, if the “ Age of
Reason” had never been published. No sir, I regret the publication
of that book exceedingly, it can never do the world any good, and its
sarcastic style will, doubtless, lead thousands to esteem lightly the
only Book of correct morals that has ever blessed the world. I would
advise you (said Paine to his visitor) not to read that work.” Paine’s
folly and impiety is thus proved by this confutation from his own
mouth, “ I wrote it more for my own amusement, and to see what I
could do, than with any design of benefitting the world.” “If anything
can exceed the mischievous intention of this attack on revealed re-
ligion, and which certainly produced very alarming effects on the
minds of many of the lower classes, among whom the book was liber-
ally circulated, it was the ignorance, of which his answerers have
convinced him, of every species of knowledge necessary for a discus-
sion of the kind.” Paine died 1809, a victim of intemperance. Let
us thank God that, for the great mass of population now, this book
has been relegated to the obscurity which it deserves, and that no
respectable bookseller calling himself Christian, will permit it to be
placed on his shelves, nor sell it for gain.
It has been considered by those competent to judge the matter, that
literature is the most precarious of all professions, precarious at best,
even to men endued with prolific talent. “ Southey, the poet’s ex-
perience, is alone enough to show those who think to pursue their
favorite studies as a means of livelihood, that all experience, and all
pecuniary calculation is against them, and that those literary resources
and flights of imagination, which afford the purest enjoyment to men
who have made a fortune, serve but as an ‘ ignis fatuus ’ to lead men
from one, so often has authorship led this world’s pilgrims away from
the paths of useful industry into the deepest ruts of difficulty, and
involved them in the very slough of despond.” What are the facts
in many cases 'I Books are continually being published which never
defray the cost of printing and advertising, and which only continue
to be advertised from time to time for the purpose of getting off’ the


stock on hand, which would else he but waste paper. Not only is the
remuneration of literature reduced by its abundance, but it is still
further diminished by the risk attending every publication by an un-
known author. Many works, even novels, go the whole round of
the London book trade, and are either rejected altogether, or sold for
nothing or next to nothing, and in some cases publishers have received
money from authors who have paid for the pleasure of seeing them-
selves in print, or perhaps for the chance of obtaining a literary
footing.
The difference of age at which men attain maturity of intellect and
even of imagination, is very striking.
Robert Burns, the great Scottish poet, was only 37 years of age
when he died, while Lord Byron, the celebrated author of “ Ohilde
Harold,” died at the early age of 36. It is probable that had they
lived longer, the world would have had the benefit of many other
poetical compositions.
Chatterton wrote all his wonderful things and exhausted every hope
of life, as before stated, when barely 18 years old. At 11 years
of age he composed the following beautiful hymn—
“ Almighty Framer of the skies,
0 let our pure devotion rise
Like incense in Thy sight !
Wrapt in impenetrable shade,
The texture of our souls was made,
Till Thy command gave light.
The sun of glory gleamed, the ray
Refined the darkness into day,
And bade the vapours fly ;
Impelled by His eternal love,
He left His palaces above,
To cheer our gloomy sky.
How shall we celebrate the day,
When God appeared in mortal day,
The mark of worldly scorn ;
When the archangel’s Heavenly lays,
Attempted the Redeemer’s praise,
And hailed Salvation’s morn ?
A humble form the Godhead wore,
The pains of poverty He bore,
To gaudy pomp unknown ;
Though in a human walk He trod,
Still was the man Almighty God,
In glory all His own.
Despised, oppressed, the Godhead bears
The torments of this vale of tears,
Nor bids His vengeance rise ;
He saw the creatures He had made
Revile His power, His peace invade ;
He saw with mercy’s eyes.”
No English poet ever equalled Chatterton at the same age. Milton
was upwards of 50 when he wrote his great work “Paradise Lost.”
Gowper knew not his might till he was beyond 30, and “ The Task”
was not written till about his 50th year.
Sir Walter Scott was upwards of 30 before ho wrote the


“ Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,” and all his greatness was yet
to come.
Edgar Allan Poe, the celebrated American author and poet, died at
the early age of 38 ; reckless intemperance caused his death. Poe
wrote “ Tales of Mystery,” with other narratives full of wild and
absorbing interest. lie was also author of “ The Raven ” and “The
Bells,” both of which the late lamented Walter Montgomery recited
with much effect when giving readings at Melbourne in 1868.
Marcus Clarke died in 1881 at the early age of 34, his death having
been caused, so it is said, by disappointed hopes for not attaining a
higher position in life than that which he occupied. Clarke for
several years previous to his decease was sub-librarian of the Mel-
bourne Public Library. The principal works written by him were
“Long Odds” and “His Natural Life.” the latter of which has had
a very large circulation • and great popularity. Although a work of
genius, it teems, however, with scenes of murder, violence, and pas-
sion, and would be more injurious than beneficial for the general run
of readers. Clarke, besides this, was a frequent contributor of
miscellaneous articles to the Melbourne and Australian newspapers
and magazines.
Two other Australian authors, both poets of great promise, may be
noticed. Gordon, writer of “ Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes,”
etc. ; also Henry Kendall, who produced Leaves from Australian
Forests.”
Gordon was a native of Gloucestershire, England, born 1838,
related to a wealthy family, educated at the Universities of
Cambridge and Glasgow. He was an elegant scholar and a man of
refined tastes, a famous character for riding and hunting, but being
shortsighted he met with some severe falls, which it is thought
affected his brain and caused temporary insanity. Gordon shot him-
self with his own rifle at Brighton Beach, 24th .June, 1870, being
then just 42 years old. The jury returned a verdict that he had com-
mitted suicide while in an unsound state of mind.
Henry Kendall, born at Ulladulla, about 159 miles south of Syd-
ney, New South Wales, 1842, educated at home by his father. He
began writing contributions to the “ Sydney Empire,” 1860, when but
18 years old, and continued doing so to it and the “ Sydney Morning
Herald” up to 1869. For several years previous to death he held
a situation under the government of New South Wales. Kendall
died of consumption on Ist August, 1882, aged 40 years. Both of
these poets have thus gone in the prime of their manhood.
There are some curious facts with regard to rapidity and slowness
of composition. William Becklord wrote his “ Yathek,” an Arabian
tale, in the French language at one sitting of three days and two
nights, hard labor. He says, “I never took off my clothes the whole
time, and the severe application made me very ill.” Beckford was
born at Fonthill, Wiltshire, England, 1759, his father being twice
Lord Mayor of London, and one of the richest men in the country.
Sad to say, the father died when the son was but 10 years of age.
From that time young Beckford’s training was superintended by his


mother and various tutors, with whom he travelled through several
foreign countries, returning to his native land in 1781 at 21 years old,
“the wealthiest commoner in England, the sole possessor of Fonthill,
(the mansion his father had built at a cost, is is said, of £240,000,)
of <£loo,ooo a year and a million in ready money. Great were the
rejoicings on the occasion; music, dancing, and feasting were con-
tinued for a week, 300 guests were assembled at the dinner table, and
1200 of Mr. Beckford’s tenants, with the people of the neighbour-
hood, dined on the lawn; the surrounding hills were illuminated by
bonfires, and the park by 30,000 lamps.” It was in 1786 that
“ Yathek” first appeared translated into English, and a French edition
at Lausanne, 1787. The French version was so admirable for style
and idiom, that it was considered by many as the work of a French-
man. Byron greatly praised “Yathek” for correctness of costume,
beauty of description, and power of imagination. As an Eastern
tale, he said, “ even Basselas must bow before it, his Happy Yalley
will not bear a comparison with the Hall of Ebbs.”
As a specimen of the author’s style we give a short extract.—
“ The caliph and Nouronihar beheld each other with amazement at
finding themselves in a place which, though roofed with a vaulted
ceiling, was so spacious and lofty, that at first they took it for an im-
measurable plain. But their eyes at length growing familiar to the
surrounding objects, they extended their view to those at a distance,
and discovered rows of columns and arcades, which gradually dimin-
ished till they terminated in a point radiant as the sun when he darts
his last beams athwart the ocean. The pavement, strewed over with
gold dust and saffron, exhaled so subtle an odour as almost over-
powered them. They, however, went on and observed an infinity of
censers, in which ambergris and the wood of aloes were continually
burning. Between the several columns were placed tables, each spread
with a profusion of viands and wines of every species, sparkling in
vases of crystal. A throng of genii and other fantastic spirits of
either sex danced at the sound of music which issued from beneath.
In the midst of this immense hall a multitude was incessantly passing,
who severally kept their right hand upon their hearts, without once
regarding anything round them; they had all the livid paleness of
death. Their eyes, deep sunk in their sockets, resembled those phos-
phoric meteors that glimmer by night in places of interment. Some
stalked slowly on, absorbed in profound reverie; some shrieking with
agony, ran furiously about like tigers wounded with poisoned arrows;
whilst others, grinding their teeth with rage, foamed along more fran-
tic than the wildest maniac. They all avoided each other, and though
surrounded by a multitude that no one could number, each wandered
at random unheedful of the rest, as if alone on a desert where no foot
had trodden. Yathek and Nouronihar, frozen with terror at a sight
so baleful, demanded of the Giaour what these appearances might
mean, and why these ambulating spectres never withdrew their hands
from their hearts 1 ‘Perplex not yourselves with so much at once,’ re-
plied he bluntly, ‘ you will soon be acquainted with all, let us haste,
and present you to Eblis.’ They continued their way through the


multitude, but, notwithstanding their confidence at first, they were
not sufficiently composed to examine with attention the various pers-
pective of halls and galleries that opened on the right hand and
left, which were all illuminated by torches and braziers whose flames
rose in pyramids to the centre of the vault. At length they came to
a place where long curtains, brocaded with crimson and gold, fell from
all parts in solemn confusion. Here the choirs and dances were heard
no longer. The light which glimmered came from afar. After some
time Yathek and Nouronihar perceived a gleam brightening through
the drapery, and entered a vast tabernacle hung round with the skins
of leopards. An infinity of elders with streaming beards and Afrits
in complete armour had prostrated themselves before the ascent of a
lofty eminence, on the top of which, upon a globe of fire, sat the for-
midable Eblis. His person was that of a young man whose noble and
regular features seemed to have been tarnished with malignant va-
pours! In his large eyes appeared both pride and despair ; his flowing
hair retained some resemblance to that of an angel of light. In his
hand —which thunder had blasted—he swayed the iron sceptre that
causes the monster Ouranbad, the Afrits, and all the powers of the
abyss to tremble. At his presence the heart of the caliph sunk
within him and he fell prostrate on his face.” This book fills 128
pages Fcap. Bvo, printed in long primer type.
Besides Yathek, Beckford was author of “ Italy, Spain, and Por-
tugal, with an Excursion to the Monasteries of Alcobaca and
Batalha.” “ The monastery of Alcobaca was the grandest ecclesias-
tical edifice in Portugal, with paintings, antique tombs and fountains,
the noblest architecture in the finest situation, and inhabited by
monks who lived like princes. The whole of the pictures are interest-
ing and present a gorgeous picture of ecclesiastical pomp and wealth.”
We give the following description of the kitchen in the monastery
of Alcobaca ; “ Through the centre of the immense and nobly groined
hall, not less than GO feet in diameter, ran a brisk rivulet of the
clearest water, containing every sort and size of the finest river fish.
On one side loads of game and venison were heaped up, on the other
vegetables and fruits in endless variety. Beyond a long line of stoves,
extended a row of ovens, and close to them hillocks of wheaten flour
whiter than snow, rocks of sugar, jars of the purest oil, and pastry in
abundance, which a numerous tribe of lay brothers and their attend-
ants were rolling out, and puffing up into a hundred different shapes,
singing all the while as blithely as larks in a corn field.”
The excursion was made in 1794, and this magnificent monastery
was afterwards plundered and given to the flames by the French
troops under Massena in 1811, by order of Napoleon Buonaparte.
Beckford died in 1844, aged 84 years.
Yirgil’s .ZEneid required 11 years to complete.
The Quintus Curtius of Yaugelas (a translation) occupied 30 years
in writing.
Poole’s Synopsis, a large theological work in 4 folio volumes, occupied
the author 16 years in compiling, and during her husband’s absence
one day, his wife in a fit of bad temper destroyed the manuscript.


Poole, on returning, at once re-commenced his labor, never relaxing
it until the task was finished a-second time.
Fenelon’s Telemachus was written in three months.
Dr. Johnson wrote “ Rasselas, an Eastern tale” in a week, to en-
able him to pay the expenses of his mother’s funeral. He could
compose enough matter in one night to fill nearly 30 printed octavo
pages, and his sentences, so high-sounding, were composed with
scarcely any effort.
Dryden usually wrote in haste to provide for the wants of
the day.
Pope published nothing until it had been a year or two before him,
and even then his proofs were full of corrections, so much so that on
one occasion his publisher thought it better to have the whole re-com-
posed by the printer than for the latter to make the necessary cor-
rections. Pope received comparatively little for his minor poems,
but he was paid a very large sum for his translations of Homer’s
Odyssey and Illiad, viz. : ,£4,244. There is a curious fact regarding
this affair. Pope instead of translating the whole himself, gave
large portions of it to a number of poor scholars and versifiers who
had to do the work for a low sum, while Pope kept the lion’s share
of the money, besides getting credit for the entire translation. A
modern writer describes this proceeding as the most unprincipled
transaction to be met with in our literary records, Pope' having
been pledged in honor to complete the task himself without assis-
tance, a duty, however, which he failed to fulfil.
Gibbon occupied fully 12 years in writing his “Decline and fall of
the Roman Empire,” the first volume being issued in 177 C, the year
which witnessed the declaration of American Independence, and the
last in 1788, being the year previous to the great French Revolution.
The work was originally published in 6 volumes quarto, for which
Gibbon received £6,000 on its completion.
A great author of this century had in his possession a very
fine stanza of Ariosto, which the poet had altered one hundred
times.
Robertson wrote the sentences of his histories (Scotland and
America) on small slij)s of paper, and after polishing them to his
mind, entered them in a manuscript book, which afterwards had to
undergo considerable revision.
Burke, Thomson, and Akenside were most indefatigable and
elaborate correctors.
Thomas Gray occupied 7 years writing his “ Elegy written in a
Country Church-yard,” a poem of 32 verses, or 128 lines, which
was commenced in 1742, revised from time to time, and completed
in 1749. The popularity of this work was both immediate and great.
To no other poem in our language has so much honor been paid. It
has been translated into Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Italian, Portugese,
French and German. The original manuscript was sold by auction
in London during the present century for £IOO. It was closely
written on two small half sheets of paper, torn and mutilated, and
these contained the first drafts of the poem. The MSS. or perfect


copy of the “ Elegy” was sold in 1854 to a resident of Birmingham
for £l3l.
Goldsmith spent seven years over his poem of “The Deserted
Tillage. ”
John Foster, the great English essayist, was very slow in compos-
ing his works, and thus records his experience. “I am much disposed
to murmur that what I do in the intellectual way should be such a
slow, irksome, and even painful operation. It is the literal truth
that I never take the pen for a paragraph or letter but as an act of
force on myself. When I have a thing of this kind to do, I linger
hours and hours before I can set about it, and days and weeks if it is
some task more than ordinary.” Yet this was the man who for 13
years was chief contributor to the “ Eclectic Review,” and became
famous afterwards all over the world as one of the greatest English
essayists. The Essays on Decision of Character, etc., first published
1805, went through 21 editions up to 1850, and many others have
been published since. Another favorite work was his Essays on
Popular Ignorance, etc., which also had a large circulation, the 17th
thousand being published in 1853. Foster was born 1770, and died
1843, Robert Hall thus alludes to Foster’s writings.—“ The author
places the idea which he wishes to present in such a flood of light
that it is not merely visible itself, but seems to illuminate all around
it. He paints metaphysics, and has the happy art of arranging what
in other hands would appear cold and comfortless abstractions, in the
warmest colors of fancy.”
Sir W 7 alter Scott composed very rapidly when writing his “Life of
Napoleon.” It was his custom to write fully four sheets every fore-
noon, or equal to 24 printed pages, and in one case, a volume of
WAodstock, one of his novels, was written in about a fortnight.
Rev. Thomas Binney transcribed his work “Is it possible to make
the best of both Worlds,” nine times, (adding to it each time) before
publishing the work. He was a very slow and deliberate author.
“ Lord Macaulay never wrote in haste, but revised everything with
the greatest nicety. His first rough draft was absolutely illegible
from erasures and corrections. It was written on official foolscap,
with the lines fully an inch apart. This, however, formed but the
rough outline. When the start had thus been made, Macaulay began
the work of amplification and revision, and when that was complete
there was not space to stick a pin’s point.” Prescott saw two or
three of these MSS. pages in connection with the History of England.
He says “ you have not the slightest conception of the amount of
labor that one of these sheets of foolscap represents.” But this was
not sent to the printer. The entire MSS. was again copied out 1 y
Macaulay in clear and large handwriting.
J. A. Froude, M.A.L.L.D., born 1818, one of the most famous ai d
elaborate English writers living, is a remarkable example of patient
and persevering labor in connection with composition. His principal
and most popular work is “ The History of England from the fall of
Wolsey to the defeat of the Spanish Armada,” or 1529 to 1588, a
period of 59 years, yet this fills 12 fair-sized volumes, but it is written


in such an interesting and attractive style that Froude’s History of
England stands side hy side with Grote, Gibbon, and Macaulay, in
the great libraries of the world, as well as being on the shelves of
every scholar. The historical accuracy of this work was questioned
and criticised most unfairly by some scholars about 10 years since, and
Froude replied in the following striking language, which gives an in-
teresting and instructive description of how a historian works, and
the magnitude of his labors.
“ My History of England has been composed from perhaps 200,000
documents, nine-tenths of them in difficult MSS. and in half a dozen
languages. I have been unable to trust printed copies, for the MSS.
often tell stories which the printed versions leave concealed. I have
been unable to trust copyists. I have read everything myself. I
have made extracts from papers which I might never see a second
time. I have had to condense pages into sentences, to translate, to
analyse, and have to depend entirely on my own transcription.
Under such conditions, it is impossible for me to answer that no re-
ference has been misplaced, and no inverted comma fallen to the
wrong words. I have done my best to be exact, and no writer can
undertake more. In passing from my notes to my written composi-
tions, from my compositions to print, from one condition to another,
the utmost care will not prevent mistakes. Of course I don’t com-
plain of faults being pointed out, but what I do complain of, is that
when I am doing my utmost to tell the truth, I am so hastily charged
with fraud !”
In a previous portion of this essay, we have referred to the trials and
misfortunes of authors, but as there is a bright as well as dark side
to the picture we shall give some of the most striking examples
of successful authors, with the circulation of their books and re-
muneration, where possible.
William Shakespeare, born22rd April, 1564, at Stratford on Avon,
said to be the most illustrious of English authors. His father, John
Shakespeare, has been represented as a glover and wool merchant, and
occupied a good position in society, as we find he sat on the bench as
High Bailiff or Mayor of the town, while the mother belonged to a
wealthy family, and possessed a considerable fortune. The tide turned,
his father suffered from depression of circumstances, and in 1586
William Shakespeare, at the age of 22, left Stratford for London in
order to better his fortunes. He had then been a married man for
four years. From that time for a period of 26 years he became asso-
ciated with the drama, being not only play actor but also author and
manager. Shakespeare soon became prosperous, and even wealthy,
being a part proprietor in two theatres, his yearly income at one time
being estimated at fully £1,500 of our money. Shakespeare died in
1616, aged 52, and it was seven years afterwards, or 1623, when the
collected edition or first folio of his works was published. This con-
tained 36 plays. Another edition was afterwards issued to which
seven more plays were added, but only one of those has been recog-
nised as genuine, the other six being regarded as spurious productions.
It is noAv agreed upon by the best critics, that the total number of


Shakespeare’s plays are 37, being classed as tragedies, comedies, and
histories. Shakespeare’s works were pirated by whoever choose to
speculate in the venture, and sometimes by illiterate men, whose sole
object was the gain it brought them. Most extraordinary prices have
been paid for the first folio edition published as stated, 1623, ranging
from £lO up to £175 17s. But one of the finest copies known “The
Daniel Moore copy,” Russia binding, was sold by auction in London,
1864, for £716 25., Miss Burdett-Ooutts being the purchaser. This
was the highest price ever paid ! In 1865, a copy of the same edition
was sold by auction for £450 to the Earl of Charlemont, and in 1867
another was disposed of for £4lO. Quaritch, the famous bookseller,
in his general catalogue for 1868, offered a slightly imperfect copy for
£345, and in 1869, also the Duke of Roxburgh’s copy, quite perfect,
for £165. How many editions of Shakespeare’s works have been
published from 1623 till now it is impossible for us to compute, but it
must be something tremendous, for they have been translated into a
great variety of languages. Up to 1870 it was estimated that the
number of distinct works written by different authors on Shakespeare,
amounted to a total of 954. The list of these authors and works
alone would fill a duodecimo volume of 238 pages long primer type.
Cervantes, a very famous Spanish writer, born in 1547, at Alcala,
of a noble family, received a good education, afterwards engaged in
war and lost his left hand in battle. Returning from Italy by Spain,
he was taken by Corsairs and carried to Algiers, being kept in prison
for five years, after which he was liberated by purchase, and settled
in Madrid, devoting himself afterwards to literature, His most
famous work was “Don Quixote.” We have previously referred to
this author as living in poverty and wanting bread, but certainly when
“Don Quixote” appeared it was a success from the first, being eagerly
read by the Spaniards, quickly known in other countries, and spread
by translations all over Europe. The popularity of this book is uni-
versal and world wide.
John Bunyan, born at Elstow, England, 1628, was the son of a
tinker, or tinsmith, as we say in these modern days. By his father’s
care, who taught him his own trade, he was placed at school where be
obtained the first rudiments of an English education. While a boy
he enlisted in the army, and saw some service during the great civil
war in England. On one occasion he narrowly escaped being shot as
a sentinel, and had two escapes from drowning. He married at 19 a
young woman of his own rank in life, and they had neither dish nor
spoon between them. It was after this that he became a Baptist
minister, and was imprisoned for preaching the gospel to his congre-
gation, the Government arresting him as a holder of conventicles,
which were then declared unlawful. Bunyan wrote many works, 60
being the stated number, but his “ Pilgrim’s Progress ” was the most
famous, and it alone would make his name immortal. Southey thus
wrote regarding the book.—“ It is not known in what year the
Pilgrim’s Progress was first published, no copy of the Ist edition
having as yet been discovered. The 2nd edition is in the British
Museum, it is with additions, and its date is 1678. But as the work


was known to have been written during Bunyan’s imprisonment,
which terminated in 1672, it was probably published before his re-
lease, or, at latest, immediately after it. The “Pilgrim’s Progress” had
reached its 10th edition in 1685. Bunyan in his preface to the
second part, published in 1684, complains that—
“ Some have of late to counterfeit
My Pilgrim, to their own my title set,
Yea others half my name and title too
Have stitched to their books to make them do,
If not thoroughly poetical this is sufficiently significant. The third
part, denied to be Bunyan’s, appeared in 1693. Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s
Pr •ogress has been translated into almost every European tongue, and
is perhaps the most popular religious work ever written. The num-
ber of different editions or copies published, it is impossible to state,
as no record of this has been preserved, but it must be truly enormous,
considering the popularity of the book.”
Daniel Defoe, born at St. Giles, London, 1661. His father was a
butcher named .lames Foe. Daniel added the prefix De to the name
by his own choice. Educated among the Dissenters he was intended
for a Presbyterian minister, but this was afterwards abandoned and
we find him first a political writer in 1683 when he was 22 years cf
age, then a soldier under the Duke of Monmouth, and subsequently
a hosier, a tilemaker, and a woolen merchant in succession, but be-
coming bankrupt, took to authorship for a living. It was in 1702
that he wrote “ The Shortest Way with the Dissenters,” which was
declared by the Government to be libellous, and he was threatened
with punishment. Defoe disappeared, and a reward was offered
for his apprehension. The following descriptive advertisement ap-
peared in the “ London Gazette,” 10th .January, 1703.—“ Whereas
Daniel Defoe, alias De Fooe, is charged with writing a scandalous
and seditious pamphlet entitled “The Shortest Way with the Dis-
senters.” He is a middle-sized spare man, about 40 years old, of a
brown complexion, and dark brown colored hair, but wears a wig, a
hooked nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a mole near his mouth.
AVhoever will discover the said De Foe, so that he may be appre-
hended, shall have the reward of £SO, which Her Majesty (Queen
Anne) has ordered to be paid upon such discovery.” De Foe was dis-
covered, brought to trial, and sentenced to be pilloried during three
days, to be fined 200 marks (equal to £166 13s. 4d. of our money
now, the mark being an ancient gold coin value 13s. 4d.) and to be
imprisoned for two years, all of which was carried into effect. The
pillory was a wooden frame erected on posts, made to receive the head
and hands of the criminal, in order to expose him to public view, and
render him on account of his offence infamous. It is said to have
originated in England during the 13th century, but has now become
obsolete. As regards the punishment of De Foe it was a failure,
such a pillory exhibition had seldom been seen in England ; exulting
thousands accompanied him each day from Newgate to the Pillory,
to protect him from hurt or insult, and greeted him with shouts of


triumph on his return there. The very pillory itself was decorated
with garlands, it being summer, when there was abundance of flowers,
and not only this, but refreshments were provided for him. De Foe
had certainly a strange and marvellous experience. He says, “ I have
gone through a life of wonders, and am the subject of a vast variety
of providences. L have summed up the scenes of my life in
these lines—
“No man has tasted different fortunes more,
And thirteen times I have been rich and poor.”
In the school of affliction I have learned more philosophy than at
the academy, and more divinity than from the pulpit. I have seen
the rough side of the world as well as the smooth, and have in less
than half a year tasted the difference between the closet of a king
and the dungeon of Newgate ” De Foe is stated to have written
210 different works, but of these the best known and most popular
now is “Robinson Crusoe.” The author experienced some difficulty in
getting a publisher, as many declined to undertake the venture, until
one at last was found enterprising enough, and the book published.
From the first it became highly popular and had a great circulation.
Indeed, it is stated that the lucky fellow who published it, gained a
£I,OOO in a short period by the transaction, from the large sale of
copies. “ Robinson Crusoe ” first appeared in a periodical publication
entitled “ The Original London Post or Ileathcote’s Intelligence,”
Nos. 125 to 289 inclusive, in 1719. The popularity of it was such
that four editions were published, three in two volumes Bvo, and an
abridgment in one volume 12m0., during the same year. Since
that period the editions published and copies printed have been almost
innumerable, as it has been produced in many languages, and is
the favorite book with boys and men all the world over. Dr. Johnson
well says, “ Was there ever anything written by mere man, that the
reader wished longer, except ‘ Robinson Crusoe,’ ‘ Don Quixote,’ and
the ‘ Pilgrim’s Progress.’” De Foe died in 1731, aged 70.
Henry Fielding, born 1707, a native of Somersetshire, England,
his father a general in the army, and his mother the daughter of a
judge. His father was a man of very extravagant habits, and the
son followed in the same steps, devoting the chief part of his life to
pleasure combined with intemperance. About 1735 he married a
lady named Cradock with a small fortune of <£1,500. . This, with an
estate worth £2OO per annum, left him by his mother, was scattered
to the winds in two years, almost every guinea being spent. He
afterwards studied for the law and became a barrister, in addition to
which he was successful as a political writer. Put it is as a novelist
that Fielding was chiefly famous. “Joseph Andrews” appeared in
1742, and was very popular. “Tom Jones” was published in 1749,
and for this he received £7OO from Andrew Miller, the publisher.
For “Amelia,” published in 1751, Fielding had £IOOO. This is said
to have been the only work published in England that a second edition
was called for during the evening of the same day on which the first
was issued. The pages of “Tom Jones” frequently abound with


scones of coarseness and indelicacy, which make it most unfit to place
in the hands of young people, and there is not much profit to be
derived from its perusal by those who are older. Yet, spite of this, it
is his most popular work, and has passed through a great number of
editions. “ The life described in Fielding’s books was, let us be
thankful for the change, totally unlike the life we now live. Much
of the fun was of the roughest possible kind, practical jokes that
would now-a-days fill our courts with actions for assaults and battery,
and violent altercations in road-side inns, which generally ended in a
row, involving everybody present, to the serious detriment of eyes
and limbs. The assembly of fishwives, cabbage-mongers, and police-
men, which enlivens every second or third scene of the comic business
in our Christinas pantomimes, affords us a specimen of the same
boisterous humor. Everything is pelted about, and everybody beats
everybody else, until the noisy crowd is hustled off’ the stage, and the
scene or chapter ends.” Fielding never could shake off the habits of
dissipation contracted in his early life, and such bore their necessary
fruit. Dropsy, jaundice, and asthma combined, seized him, and after
a struggle for health in England, to try the effect of a warmer climate,
he travelled to Lisbon in 1754, at which place he died during the
same year, aged 47.
Tobias Smollett, born at Cardross, in Dumbartonshire, Scotland,
1721. Educated in the Grammar School, Dumbarton, and the Uni-
versity of Glasgow. Afterwards apprentice to an apothecary or
chemist in the same city. Travelling to London he tried authorship
by writing a play, but this was unsuccessful, and he obtained a situa-
tion as surgeon’s mate in the English navy, which led ultimately to
his appointment as commander of an eighty gun ship. In this position
Smollett gained a wonderful knowledge of sailors and sailor life, as his
ship formed one of the fleet despatched against Carthagena during
the war with Spain in 1741, when he had many opportunities of wit-
nessing and feeling the horrors of naval warfare. It was after this
that he settled in the West Indies, marrying a young lady whom he
loved, in 1747. After vainly trying his fortune as a physician, he
commenced that literary life, which, with more or less application,
and despite pecuniary embarrassments, he followed until his death,
which took place at Leghorn, Italy, 1771, being 50 years old. Smol-
lett’s most popular works were “ Roderick Random ” and “ Peregrine
Pickle,” the former being first published in 1748, in 2 volumes 12mo.
In 1778, or within 30 years, 10 different editions were published, and
in 1790, a German edition at Berlin, besides being printed in other
languages, since which many other editions have been issued. “ Pere-
grine Pickle” was first published 1751 in 4 volumes 12m0., second
edition during the same year, up to 1784, when 5 editions had been
issued. Since that time it has been published in a great variety of
editions in different parts of the world. Smollett also received £2,000
for a “History of England” published in 17G3. Of this, a sixpenny
reprint, so called by being published in sixpenny numbers, was issued,
20,000 copies being sold, it it stated in less than a month. This
enormous circulation was produced by the proposals for the history


being distributed in the pews of the parish churches throughout Eng-
land. Smollett’s novels, although romantic and interesting, are never-
theless disfigured by scenes of grossness, indelicacy, and immorality,
being even coarser in this respect than the productions of Fielding,
and making it injurious if not improper to place them in the liands
of young people, whether male or female.
James Boswell, born 1740, at Edinburgh, Scotland, his father
being a judge who had a large estate, and was in comfortable circum-
stances. Boswell studied law at Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Utrecht,
afterwards becoming an advocate at the Scotch bar. It was in 1763
that he became acquainted with Dr. Johnson, and was afterwards
famous as his friend and biographer. Besides the great work by which
he is chiefly known, he published several legal and literary Essays,
his “ Journal of a Tour through Corsica,” being received with much
favor, and translated into four different languages. Dr. Johnson died
in 1784, aged 75, and Boswell’s book was published in two volumes
quarto, 1791. There is no other author, ancient or modern, whose life
has been described so graphically as his, or who is better known, and
perhaps it is scarcely to be wondered at when we remember that the
friendship continued for 21 years, fully three-fourths of that time
being spent daily in the Doctor’s society, whose every look, act, and
word were treasured like jewels. Each night, on going home,
notes were made of the day’s transactions and conversations,
until they afterwards grew into the famous “ Life of Johnson.”
“To this man we owe a book which is held to be the best biography
in the English language. Of other men we possess pictures, of John-
son we have a photograph, accurate, in every line, and showing the
minutest details of his person and habits.” The sale, from 1791 to
1805, reached about 4000 copies, and since then many editions have
been published. Macaulay thus speaks of it. “ Boswell’s Life
of Johnson is one of the best books in the world; it is assuredly a
very great work. Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic
poets, Shakespeare is not more the first of dramatists, Demosthenes
is not more decidedly the first of orators than Boswell is the first of
biographers. We are not sure, that there is in the whole history of
the human intellect, so singular a phenomenon as this book. Many of
the greatest men that ever lived have written biography. Boswell
was one of the smallest men that ever lived, and he has beaten them
all.” Dibdin, in his “ Library Companion,” says,—“ This fascinating,
and I may add, truly original composition, is a work for all times. In
reading it, we see the man, we even hear his voice, and observe his
gesticulations. The growl of discontent, and the shout of triumph
equally pervades our ears. Walking, sitting, reading, writing, talk-
ing, all is Johnsonian. We place “Boswell’s Johnson” in our
libraries, to be gazed at again, and again, to feed upon and to devour.”
Boswell died in 1795, aged 55 years.
Hannah More, the daughter of a schoolmaster, born in Gloucester-
shire, England, 1745. A collective edition of her works was pub-
lished in 1830, 11 vols. post Bvo, £5. New editions of several of
her productions have appeared at different periods since then. Many


of her works have had a great circulation. Thus the “ Shepherd of
Salisbury Plain ” sold to the extent of 150,000 copies when first issued,
and one publication called the “ Cheap Repository Series,” to which
she contributed a number of sketches and narratives, sold to the
extent of 2,000,000 copies the first year, most of this being due to
her influence and popularity. Hannah More lived and died an old
maid, although in the natural order of things this should have been
otherwise. She was actually engaged to a gentleman who tantalized
her by putting off the match until she declined it altogether. Not-
withstanding the separation, and in spite of all her objections, he
settled an annuity upon Hannah More as a mark of his esteem and
respect. The sale of her works was so large as to yield a fortune of
£30,000, and being of a very benevolent character, she rendered great
assistance to the poor and unfortunate around her, and at death left
charitable endowments amounting to £IO,OOO. She died in 1833,
aged 88 years.
Sir Walter Scott, born at Edinburgh, Scotland, 15th August, 1771,
which was famous as being the birthday of the great French Emperor
Napoleon. Scott was educated in the High School, and afterwards
attended Greek and Latin and logic classes at Edinburgh University.
His father was what is called a writer to the signet, or in plain
English, a solicitor and conveyancer, and when about 15 years old
the son was placed in his office with a view of following the same
profession. This continued for a few years, during which he actually
came forward as a barrister, and pleaded cases in the courts of law.
But he was evidently not intended for this line of business, and while
others flourished by scheming and swindling, making large fortunes,
Scott was, so to speak, a briefless barrister, and could just make
enough for his bare existence. It is stated that when, in 1792, he
became a Scotch advocate his income was under £2OO per annum.
In 1797 he married a lady who, fortunately for him, brought an
annuity with her of £2OO, and in 1799, through some powerful
friends, he obtained a light Government appointment at £3OO per
year, which involved neither responsibility nor labor. It was in 1802
that he first appeared as an author, when “ The Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border” was issued. This work brought him at once a
distinguished reputation. The remuneration at first was small, being
£B7 10s., or one-half the profits, but he sold the copyright after-
wards for £SOO. From that time his pen was never idle. For
the “Lay of the Last Minstrel” he received £769 65., while for
“ Marmion ” an Edinburgh bookseller offered one thousand guineas,
soon after the poem was begun, and without having seen a line
of it, and the price was paid before the work was published. It
was first printed in 1808, in quarto, price one guinea and a half.
In less than a month, 2000 copies were sold, another edition also of
3000 copies Bvo, being published and disposed of. Up to 1825, it was
estimated that fully 31,000 copies of “Marmion” had been sold.
For the “Lady of the Lake,” published 1810, Scott received two
thousand guineas, and by 1836, 50,000 copies had been sold.
Constable gave fifteen hundred guineas for one-half the copyright of


the “ Lord of the Isles.” Of “ Rokeby,” more than 3000 copies
were sold at two guineas by the second day of publication. For his
edition of “Dryden’s Works” he was paid £756, and £1,500 for an
edition of “Swift.” For the articles on “Chivalry,” “The Drama*,”
and “ Romance,” in the “ Encyclopadia Britannica,” he received
£IOO each. But it was as a novelist that Sir Walter Scott shone,
and a mine of wealth was discovered when he thought of embodying
the men and manners of the olden time in works of fiction. In 1805,
when writing “ Marmion,” he began an historical tale which was
designed to give a picture of old Scottish life and character ; this
was not completed, and the unfinished MSS. was put away in a bar-
rel with some odds and ends where it remained for, fully eight years
up to 1813, when one day Scott, searching for some fishing tackle,
came upon the almost forgotten sheets. The book was resumed, con-
cluded, and published in 1814, under the title of “ Waverley, or ’tis
sixty years since.” This was first published anonymously, at one
guinea, but in five weeks 1000 copies were sold, and another 4000
copies were printed and sold before the end of a year. The total
profits divided between author and publisher for the first year of
“ Waverley,” amounted to £1,052 each. The same sum was divided
before the work appeared in a series. For the four novels “ Ivanhoe,”
“ The Abbott,” “ The Monastery,” and “ Kenilworth,” published
between December, 1819, and January, 1821, Scott received five
thousand guineas, being the fruits of a year’s labor, and he cleared
£IO,OOO before the bargain was completed. The first demand of
“ Ivanhoe” sold 12,000 copies, and this continues to be still one of
his most popular novels. Of “ Guy Mannering,” 2000 copies at one
guinea each were sold on the day of publication; within twelve
weeks 5000 copies were printed, and before many years had passed,
50,000 copies had been sold. Of “ Tales of my Landlord,” published
originally in four volumes, 6000 copies were printed within six weeks
from the day of publication. Of “Rob Roy,” 10,000 copies were
first printed, and another edition of 3000 copies called for within
a fortnight afterwards. In 1812 the existing copyrights of Sir
Walter Scott’s works were purchased from him by Constable and Co.,
for £12,000. At this period Scott’s income from his novels alone,
amounted to not less than £IO,OOO per annum. Unfortunately for
Sir Walter Scott, lie became associated in business with Ballantyne
and Co., printers and publishers at Edinburgh. This connection was
continued from 1805 up to 1825, a year famous for money panics and
the collapse of companies in England and Scotland. In January
1826, Ballantyne and Co. failed, and the obligations of Sir Walter
Scott as partner in the firm were found to reach the enormous amount
of £120,000. Two noblemen offered to advance £30,000 each, and
the creditors agreed among themselves to accept a composition, but
all this Scott declined, and said, “ Is o gentlemen, time and I against
any two, allow me time and I will endeavour to pay all.” From that
time, his life work was devoted to this task. “ Woodstock,” pub-
lished in 1826, realised £8,228, and for the “Life of Napoleon,”pub-
lished in 1827, £IB,OOO was paid. Within a year and a half from


the time of failure Scott had reduced the debt by £28,000, and by the
republication of his novels with other works the additional sum after-
wards realised was £54,000. His life was also insured to the extent
of £22,000 for the benefit of his creditors. But the end came at
last. The pressure of responsibility was too great, and borne down
by trials and uicables paralysis attacked him, and he died in 1832,
aged 62 years. The last works written by him were “ Count Robert
of Paris’ and “Castle Dangerous,” published 1831, and completing
the series of 29 tales now known all over the world as “The Waver-
ley Novels.” Shortly before his death, the copyright of his novels
was bought by Mr. Robert Cadell, the publisher, for £8,400, the in-
tention being to re-issue the whole series in a cheap edition with notes
by the author. The creditors were to have half the profits in return
for Sir Walter’s work. The project was a successful one. About
1000 persons were engaged in the work, and the sale soon reached an
average of 23,000 copies. In 1833, Mr. Cadell advanced the balance
of £30,000 on security of the copyrights, and in 1847, he gave a dis-
charge in full of all claims, so that the burden of £120,000 Avas ab-
solutely cleared away 15 years after the great novelist’s death. It
has been calculated that by the sale of Scott’s complete works, Mr.
Cadell must have turned over more than a million sterling, and that
his profits amounted to at least £300,050. In 1852, it was
announced that not less than 125,000 copies or sets of Scott’s com-
plete works had been sold up to that time in Great Britain, and at
least as many in the United States. By “Great Facts,” published
1858, it was estimated that up to the same year more than 3,500
tons weight of paper was consumed in producing the various editions
of Sir Walter Scott’s writings and life, and the duty paid on the
paper alone amounted to no less than £51,450. The paper duty of
1 £d. per lb. then prevailed in Great Britain.
Thomas Moore, born at Dublin, Ireland, 1779, the son of a grocer,
and wine and spirit merchant. While but a child he was noted for
his elocutionary talents and musical abilities, it being a common
custom with his parents to set him on a table when he would enter-
tain the company by singing songs and reciting poetry. His educa-
tion and after success was due to the kindness of a good mother, who
sent him to Trinity College, Dublin, and afterwards to London,
where he was entered at the Middle Temple as a law student. In
1813-14 Moore’s “ Irish Melodies” were first published, and regard-
ing this there is some curious information. It seems that “James
Power, a music seller in London, employed Moore from 1806 to
1836, (when Rower died) to write the “Irish Melodies” and other
songs for him. For the melodies alone, he paid the author £SOO per
year during thote 30 years. There are 124 melodies, and as the
whole amount received by Moore was £15,000 he must have been
paid £l2l for each of these songs, their average length was 20 lines,
which would make the payment over £6 per line.” His other most
famous work “ Lalla Rookh ” (Tulip Cheek), was published in 1817,
by Longman and Co., London, who paid the author three thousand
guineas for the publication. It is a long poem, which takes the form


of an Eastern romance, being of a brilliant and gorgeous description.
Moore’s publications have all been very popular, especially among
his countrymen, in different parts of the world. In 1835, the Eng-
lish Government gave the poet a pension of £3OO per annum, which
he enjoyed till 1852, when he died at the age of 73. The pension
was a great assistance to Moore while living, as, although he received
£20,000 from his various copyrights, he was a most improvident
man, spending as fast as he received, and living a brilliant fashion-
able life to the last. His wife was allowed a pension of £IOO on the
death of her husband.
Washington Irving, born at New York, America, in 1783. One
of the most distinguished among modern writers. His father was a
native of Scotland, while his mother was an Englishwoman. Irving
is credited with being the author of 16 different works, the most
popular of which were the “ Sketch Book,” “ Bracebridge Hall,” and
“Tales of a Traveller.” The “Sketch Book” was first published at
London, 1820, by John Murray, who paid £2OO and an additional
£4OO, as the book sold well. “ Bracebridge Hall” appeared in 1822,
and for this, Irving received 1000 guineas from Murray before lie
saw the MSS. The “Tales of a Traveller” was sold to the same
publisher for 1500 guineas. The “ Conquest of Granada ”
realized £2OOO, while for the “ Life and Voyages of Columbus” 3000
guineas were paid. “In 1830, Washington Irving and Henry
Hallam were honoured by the gift of the two fifty guinea gold medals,
ordered by George the Fourth, to be presented to the two authors,
who should be adjudged to have attained the greatest excellence in
historical composition. This was a tribute to the merits of his book,
the “History of the Life and Voyages of Columbus.” In 1831, the
degree of L.L.D. was conferred upon him by the University of Ox-
ford. In 1848-50, a new edition of Washington Irving’s works was
issued at New York, and the sale up to 1857 was 250,000 volumes,
which, added to as many more of the old editions sold, gives a total
sale in America alone, of half a million volumes of the works by this
popular author. In Great Britain also, and amongst English speak-
ing communities, the works of Washington Irving were favorably
received from ,the first, and still retain their popularity. He died in
1859, of disease of the heart, aged 76. It is stated as a curious fact,
that in 1799 when a lad of 16, Irving entered a lawyer’s office at
New York, when the population was only 50,000, aud at his death
in 1859, it had multiplied (including Brooklyn) to fully 1,000,000,
or more. Irving never married, but lived and died a bachelor.
J. E. Worcester, L.L.D., born at Bedford, New Hampshire,
America, 1784. This author is credited with having written and
compiled 16 different works, mostly dictionaries. The following
shows the circulation of some of his works. “Elements of History,
with Atlas,” first published 1826. The number of copies printed and
sold from 1851 to 1863, 60,000. The “Comprehensive English
Dictionary,” first published 1830, and numerous editions issued up
to 1856, From 1856 to 1863, 57,000 copies were published. “ John-
son’s English Dictionary Improved, combined with Walker,” royal


octavo, first published 1828, sale from then up to 1858, 12,000 copies
per annum. “ The Pronouncing, Explanatory, and Synonymous
Dictionary of the English Language,” first published 1855 ; up to
1865, 13,500 copies were published. “Dictionary of the English
Language, royal 4to, with 1000 illustrations, first published 1860,
there were 27,000 copies printed up to 1863. The number of dif-
ferent words in this dictionary amounts to 104,000, for which autho-
rities are given in every case.- In an old edition of “ Blair’s Pre-
ceptor,” published 1812, it is stated that the number of words in the
English language then amounted to about 40,000. How immense
must have been the increase since that time, when we can obtain a
dictionary like that of Dr. Worcester’s with no less than 104,000,
and even this is increasing every year, by the creation of new wants,
and the invention of new words. It may possibly interest our readers
to know l hat the 'English language, strictly speaking, is not one
only, but many, being derived as it is from the Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
French. Saxon, Celtic,-German, Italian, Spanish, Danish, and several
other languages. Dr. Worcester died in 1865, aged 81.
Mary Somerville, daughter of Admiral Fairfax of the British
navy. She was born at Burntisland, Scotland, 1780, married a Mr.
Greig, who died," and afterwards married Mr. Somerville. The
“'Connection of the Physical Sciences” was first published 1834, and
up to 1850 nine editions had been issued and sold. It is stated to
be an astonishing production, conveying in simple language a great
mass of profound knowledge. “ Physical Geography” first published
1848, the fifth English edition being issued in 1862, besides which
four editions were published in America, from 1848 to 1856. The
“Connection of the Physical Sciences” was first published at 10s.
6d., and. the'Physical Geography at 125., which makes the popu-
larity of such books more remarkable. In 1834, Mrs. Somerville
was elected a member of the Learned and Scientific Society of
Geneva, in 1835 made a member of the Royal Astronomical Society,
arid the Savrie year received a pension of £3OO per year from the
British Government. In 1869 she was presented with the Patron
or Victoria medal, by the Royal Geographical Society, and at a dinner
of the same Society, the President, Sir R. I. Murchison, in his speech
referred to this eminent and venerable lady, then in her 89th year,
who had been singularly distinguished throughout her long life by
the highest attainments, and was even at that time occupied in solv-
ing abstruse, mathematical problems. Her remarkable activity of
mind and body continued almost to the last. During her 92nd year
she drove about to see the grand eruption of Mount Vesuvius in
1872, of which she left a graphic account. During the same year
she wrote, “ I am npw in my 92nd year still able to drive out for seve-
ral hours, I am extremely deaf, and my memory of ordinary events
and especially of the names of people is failing, but not for matin'
niatical and scientific subjects. lam still able to read books on the
higher algebra for four or five hours in the morning, and even to
solve the problems. I also enjoy reading about all the new dis-
coveries and theories in the scientific world, and on all branches of


science.” Mrs. Somerville died in November 1872, passing away
while sleeping.
S. G. Goodrich, better known as Peter Parley, born 1793 at Ridge-
field, Connecticut, America. Shortly after attaining his majority,
he began business as a publisher in Hartford, and continued this for
several years. In 1823-24 he visited England, France, and Holland,
and soon after commenced the publication of the “Token,” an original
annual which he edited for 14 years. Mr. Goodrich was highly popu-
lar, as a writer especially of juvenile works, such books as Parley’s
Magazine, Merry’s Museum and Parley’s Cabinet library assisting
and encouraging parents, besides delighting and instructing children
all over the civilised world. He was such a prolific author that
his volumes were stated to be numberless, but this is somewhat ex-
travagant, for in consequence of other writers assuming the naitie of
Peter Parley he was obliged to number his own books in self defence.
In a book entitled “ Recollections of a life time, or men and things I
have seen” published at New York 1858, Mr. Goodrich observes, “ My
experience as an author, has been not a little singular in one respect.
While on the other side of the Atlantic my name has been largely
used as a passport to the public for books I never wrote, attempts
have been male in this country to deprive me of the authorship of
at least 100 volumes which I did write. It requires some patience
to reflect upon this, to see myself falsely saddled with the produc-
tion of things which were either stupid, vulgar, or immoral, and
then to be deprived also by falsehood, of the means of throwing
them off by appealing to genuine works, which have obtained
general favor, through a suspicion cast upon the public mind, that I
am a mere pretender, and that the authorship of these works be-
longs to another person. This, however, has been my position with
some portion of the public. I have thought it necessary to print a
catalogue of my genuine works, and also a list of the false ones is-
sued under my name, to set the whole matter clearly before my
readers.” Then follows a long list of school books, tales under the
name of Peter Parley, Parley’s historical compendium, Parley’s mis-
cellanies, published from 1828 up to 1857. At the end of this, Mr.
Goodrich remarks, “ L thus stand before the public as the author
and feditor of about 170 volumes, 116 of which bear the name
“Peter Parley.” Of all these, about 7 millions of volumes have
been sold, and about 300,000 volumes are now disposed of annually.”
It seems that no less than 48 spurious Parley books were published
both in England and America, representing a total of 72 volumes.
Amongst the English counterfeits stands Peter Parley’s Annual,
begun in 1841, and published every year since. Peter Parley’s books
do not belong to that class termed dead stock, which load the shelves
for years, and rouse the periodical indignation of booksellers; on the
contrary, they are the most active kind of live stock, being always
on the move. This celebrated man died in 1860, aged 67.
George Grote, born 1794, a native of Kent, England, educated at
Charterhouse School, London, His father had a large banking es-
tablishment in the city, and the future historian was placed here at


the age of 16, where he continued up till 1830, when his father died,
and the son became head of the bank. He was both philosopher
and historian, for, while but a lad, he studied with energy in leisure
hours, and was up at six in the morning to read philosophy for
three hours before breakfast. The book by which he became uni-
versally famous was “ The History of Greece from the earliest
period to the death of Alexander the Great.” As early as 1823, he
formed the design of writing this, and began to collect materials for
it. The first 2 volumes were published in 1846, and the last or 12th
volume in 1856, being a period of 10 years. This work ranks with
the greatest of modern histories. It is a masterpiece, having been
admitted to be unapproachable in its style and composition by any
other author, ancient or modern. On the death of Lord Brougham
in 1868, George Grote succeeded him as President of University
College, and Vice-Chancellor of the University of London, occupy-
ing these positions until he died in 1871, aged 77.
VY. H. Prescott, bom 1796, at Salem, Massachusetts, America,
son of Judge Prescott. Educated at Boston, and during 1811 began
a course of study at Hayward College, when he gained distinguished
honors, and would have devoted himself to his father’s profession,
that of a lawyer, but for a sad accident the result of a practical
joke. At a college dinner a fellow student, in play, threw a hand-
piece of bread which struck one of Prescott’s eyes so severely as to
cause inflammation and ultimate loss of sight. The other eye after-
afterwards became sympathetically affected, so that he could not see
to either read nor write. Before writing his historical works, he was
compelled to have a person employed to read any work required for
reference, and Mr. Prescott wrote his composition by means of an
apparatus traversed by as many brass wires as lines are wanted on
the page, and with a sheet of carbonated paper, such as is used for
making duplicate copies. With an ivory stylus the writing was
traced between the wires on the carbonated sheets, making a copy on
the page below. In this manner Prescott wrote all his celebrated
histories during a period of 40 years. “ Mr. Prescott was an accom-
plished scholar, a man of cheerful humor, and affectionate character,
methodical in his habits and persevering in his pursuits. He walked
■five miles regularly every day, composing as he walked, besides which
he devoted five hours each week day to literary labor, and two hours
to novel reading, by way of recreation.” Prescott wrote six different
works, five of which were histories, the other being biographical and
critical. “The History of Ferdinand and Isabella,” occupied 10
years of hard labor, but it met with immediate success. The first
edition was published in 1838, and from that time up to 1860, 17,731
copies were printed and sold in London and the United States. It
was also translated into French, Spanish, German and Italian. The
“ History of the Conquest of Mexico” occupied six years in composi-
tion, but its success was even greater than the former works. The
first edition was published in 1843, nearly 7000 copies being sold
the first year, and up to January 1860, 20,616 copies had been sold.
This work is founded upon 8000 folio pages of unpublished docu-


ments, and numerous other authorities, including printed works.
The “ Conquest of Peru ” occupied Prescott four years in writing,
first edition published 1847. Prom that time up to 1860, 16,965
copies were sold in England and the United States. “ History of
Reign of Phillip II.,” volumes 1 and 2 first published 1855, up to
1860, 13,000 copies sold; volume 3 of same work published 1858,
and up to 1860, 8000 copies sold. “Life of Charles V.,” first pub-
lished 1856, up to 1860, 6,900 copies were sold. “ Biographical and
Critical Miscellanies,” first published 1845, up to 1860, more than
13,000 copies were sold in England and America. It was estimated
that Mr. Prescott received an income of between £4OOO and £SOOO
from his writings, and of this, one-tenth was regularly given away in
charity. He died in 1859. Since Prescott’s death, his works have
been published in numerous editions, both in England and America,
large numbers being sold. They are amongst the most fascinating
and interesting historical works ever written, and no library would
be complete without them.
T. B. Macaulay, born 1800, at Rothley Temple, Leicestershire.
Educated at Trinity College, Cambridge commencing 1818, during
1822 he graduated B. A., was elected a Fellow of Trinity, and in
1825 became an M.A. In 1849, he was elected Lord Rector of
Glasgow University. His father was in comfortable circumstances
for many years, being successively, overseer of an estate in Jamaica,
then secretary to a company at Sierra Leone, with a salary of £SOO
per year, and afterwards partner of a large business in Africa. But
the tide turned, and reverses came. When Macaulay went to col-
lege his father had made a fortune in the African trade. Before he
left college his father had lost this fortune. It appears that latterly,
Macaulay senior, in his excessive enthusiasm as a philanthropist and
social reformer, neglected business, and brought poverty on his chil-
dren. Young Macaulay afterwards became the mainstay and sup-
port of the whole family. By the influence of his father and some
rich friends the son was very successful, and in 1828 when but 28
years of age, he was estimated to have an income of 900 per annum,
from an official position given him, and his writings combined. In
1833, we find him appointed Secretary to the Board of Control for
the East India Company, at a salary of 10,000 per year. In 1852,
he became member of Parliament for Edinburgh, and in 1857 ac-
cepted the offer of a peerage, his title now being Baron Macaulay of
Rothley. Macaulay wrote a series of essays for the “ Edinburgh
Review,” extending over nearly 20 years, from 1825 to 1844. A
collected edition of these was published in one volume octavo, and in
five volumes 12mo. at Philadelphia without any permission of the
author. This work was extremely popular, as we find, that within
five years from the time of publication, the sale of these represented
a total of 60,000 volumes. As many of them came to England, and
in order to protect himself, Macaulay issued an English edition
during 1843 in 3 vols. octavo 365., and 3 vols. foolscap octavo 20s.
The demand for this was so great, that up to 1867 eight editions had
been published and sold. “ Regarding his “ Lays of Ancient Rome,”


the first edition was published in 1842, and from then up to 1875,
upwards of 100,000 copies were sold. But it was as a historian that
he became eminently popular and successful. “ Never perhaps was a
work more passionately, more impatiently expected by the public than
Macaulay’s “ History of England” from the first announcement of
its intended preparation. to the day, December 17th, 1855, which
witnessed the publication of the third and fourth volumes. At
length, in 1849, appeared the first and second volumes. Within six
months it ran through five editions, involving an issue of 18,000
copies, (and this be it remembered, when the volumes were published
at 16s. each.) The Bth edition was published in 1852, and by Janu-
ary, 1856, the sale of Yols. 1 and 2 had reached nearly 40,000 copies.
In the United States the sale of Yols. 1 and 2, in five years, amounted
to 125,000 copies. December 17th, 1855, will long be remembered
in the annals of Paternoster Row. Messrs. Longman and Co. had
promised the 3rd and 4th volumes on that day, and as the Ist edition
consisted of 5000 copies only, it was presumed that 25,000 copies
would be amply sufficient to meet the demand. But this enormous
pile of books, weighing no less than 56 tons ! was exhausted the first
day, and 11,000 disappointed applicants remained unsatisfied, to envy
the happy possessors, and to insist upon a new edition being imme-
diately printed. The delighted publishers apologised for the disap-
pointment, and requested another month’s time to execute the
unsupplied orders. But this demand, extraordinary as it seems, was
greatly surpassed in America. One publishing house in New York
sold 73,000 volumes in 10 days, (three different styles and prices)
and 25,000 copies more were immediately issued. In Philadelphia,
10,000 copies were stereotyped, printed, and in the hands of the
publisher within 50 working hours, more than 100 compositors being
engaged on the enterprise. Other editions were also published at
Boston.” It has been estimated that the aggregate sale of volumes
3 and 4 within the first four weeks from publication amounted to
fully 150,000 copies in England and America. During 1856, editions
of this work were published in the Dutch and ’Hungarian languages,
for the benefit of Continental readers. In 1856, Messrs. Longman
and Co. paid Lord Macaulay £20,000 as his share in the profits on
the History of England up to that year. He died in 1859, at the age
of 59. In 1861 a fifth volume of the History of England was
published, edited by his sister and this has since been added to all
succeeding editions. Macaulay was ambitious of writing a History
of England down to the period of men living in his time, but in
this he was doomed to be disappointed, for after all, the work is
but a grand fragment. The first volume contains a rapid but
masterly glance of early English history, becoming more detailed
as that period begins of which Oliver Cromwell is the leading
figure during the reign of Charles L, England under Charles 11.,
the state of that country during 1685, and the accession of James 11.,
in the same year. From 1685, down to the death of William 111.
in 1702, we have only 17 years of detailed history. But it
must be remembered that this period of 17 years was one of the


most striking to be found in English annals, embracing as it did the
reign of James 11., the English Revolution of 1688, defeat and flight
of James 11., with the reign of William 111. Amongst other im-
portant events which took place are the following : The civil war in
Ireland, including the Siege of Londonderry, 1689, the Battle of the
Boyne, with the Siege of Limerick, 1690, and that of Athlone, 1691,
Rebellion in Scotland, with the Battle of Killiecrankie, 1689, and
the Massacre of Glencoe, 1692, the victory of the English and Dutch
fleets over the French at the Battle of La Hogue, 1692, the establish-
ment of the Bank of England, 1694, and the beginning of the English
national debt. This is said to have commenced in 1689, when it
amounted to <£664,263, but by 1695 had increased to £5,000,000.
The great cause of this debt from first to last has been war, and it
has continued increasing annually, until in 1876 we find it to have
reached the enormous amount of £725,059,317. Since then, the
English nation has been engaged in several wars, which we have no
doubt has increased the debt to a large extent above the sum just
stated. The interest upon this debt and its management alone is
something stupendous, as in 1872 it reached no less than £26,839,601.
As a curious historical fact, but not included in Macaulay’s work,
during the reign of William 111., potatoes, although introduced into
the country about a century previously, could only be met with at
the tables of the great, and were considered a delicacy, being both
scarce and expensive, as they were not then generally cultivated in
England. Indeed, it was not till 1728, that regular potato crops
were cultivated first in Scotland, England following the example
afterwards in 1745. Macaulay had a charming and attractive style,
which exercised a most powerful influence over his readers, without
requiring them to think profoundly on what was written. In this
respect he resembled authors of fiction, by whom we are carried down
a stream of imagination without any effort of thought being neces-
sary. He was a prodigious reader, and, besides having a superhuman
memory, had a very brilliant fancy, all of which, being brought into
active play, combined to make his history so popular as it is with the
multitude, who were led captive as by the spell of a magician.
Unfortunately, he often sacrificed and misread facts regarding dif-
ferent events, and numerous complaints have been made against him
in this respect. Thus we find, that, in 1861, an English author
named Paget, collected five of the most conspicious errors of Macau-
lay’s History info a little book entitled “ The New Examen,” to
which our readers are referred for further information on this point.
Notwithstanding these defects, however, the work is a masterpiece of
genius, and we do not remember enjoying a richer intellectual treat
than when reading Macaulay’s History of England.
William and Robert Chambers, both born in Peebles, Scotland,
William in 1800 and Robert in 1802. These great men were almost
inseparably connected from first to last as publishers and authors, in
all of which they were afterwards very successful, and made them-
selves a world wide reputation. Both brothers were born with six
fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. In the case of


William the extra members were removed without injury, but with
Robert the operation produced a slight permanent lameness, which
prevented him from engaging in the active sports of boyhood. Their
paternal grandfather was a woollen and linen manufacturer, and their
grandmother was a woman noted for her piety and great force of
character. The father of the two boys was a man of easy yielding
disposition, possessing considerable knowledge and having a great
partiality for scientific studies. He possessed a copy of the Encyclo-
paedia Britannica, (an early edition) which, more than anything else,
gave the two young lads a taste for reading and literature. To
Robert, who found the volumes stuffed inside a chest in the garret,
it opened a new world. He says “ I felt a profound thankfulness
that such a convenient collection of human knowledge existed, and
that here it was spread out like a well covered table before me.
What the gift of a whole toyshop would have been to most children,
this book was to me. I plunged into it. I roamed through it like a
bee. I hardly could be patient enough to read any one article while
so many remained to be looked into. What a year that was to me,
not only in intellectual enjoyment, but in mental formation. I believe
it was my eleventh, for before I was twelve years old, misfortune had
taken the book from us to help in satisfying our father’s creditors.”
Besides the Encyclopaedia Britannica, both lads read every book in
the shop of Alexander Elder, the village bookseller, without any idea
of systematic study. It seems to have produced fruit however, as
William Chambers says much of his success in life afterwards was
due to the random reading’indulged in then.
In 1813, as the father had been unfortunate in business, the family
removed to Edinburgh, and at 14 years old, William was apprenticed
to a bookseller for five years at a wage of 4s. per week. His father
then removed to Joppa-pans, about four miles from Edinburgh, so
that the boy was thrown on his own resources, and had to make the
weekly four shillings provide for all wants. He obtained lodgings
from a woman in the top story of a house in the West Port, where he
had a bed, what attendance and cooking he required, and was allowed
to sit by the fireside, all for eighteenpence per week. His weekly
food cost him Is. 9d., and as his daily fare with the amount it costare
curiosities in their way, we give it for the benefit of our readers. —•

writes, “ I had ninepence per week over for miscellaneous demands,
chiefly in the department of shoes, which constituted an awkwardly
heavy item. On no occasion did I look to my father for the slightest
pecuniary assistance.” His brother Robert, in consequence of
domestic troubles, was taken from school when 15 years old, and
came up to Edinburgh, living in the same room with William. The
stock of the elder brother consisted of a few articles of clothing, and
two or three books, including a pocket Bible, the whole contained in
a small blue painted box which he carried on his shoulder along the
Grassmarket. This box has since been deposited in the Chambers’
Institute, Peebles. The brothers were both hard students, rising in


summer at 5 o’clock in the morning to read. They studied the French
language, besides reading “ Locke, on the Human Understanding,”
and “Smith’s Wealth of Nations,” taking notes as they proceeded.
In the Winter time, however, their limited means prevented them
from getting either fire or candle, and such studies as we have
enumerated had to be abandoned for the time. William by chance
was introduced to a baker who was intensely fond of reading, but
whose business prevented him from indulging in the passion. The
baker arranged that William Chambers was to come at 5 o’clock each
morning and read various books to himself and his two sons while
they labored making bread. The reward for this was to be a penny
roll, hot from the oven. The only light was a penny candle stuck in
a bottle, and so seated upon a sack in the cellar, our future publisher
gave reading entertainments for two hours and a half each morning
to the baker and his sons, receiving the penny roll which was his only
breakfast for many a day. In this way William Chambers read the
novels of Fielding and Smollett, also “ Gil Bias,” all of which pleased
his audience immensely.
In 1819, when William Chambers had finished his term of appren-
ticeship, he set up a secondhand book shop in Leith Walk. The
stock-in-trade consisted of a few old books belonging to his father,
and <£lo worth had on credit from a book agent. This filled three
rows of shelves, put up by his own hands in front of the little shop
which he rented at £6 per annum. During the first day the business
consisted of three sales, the first being a copy of Robertson’s History
of Charles V., in five volumes 12mo. ; second, a copy of Hervey’s
Meditations; third, a sixpenny song book. William Chambers thus
writes—“ Altogether I cleared a profit of 9s. 3d. the first day, not-
withstanding some exhaustion of stomach, for I had been too anxious
to think about my regular dinner, and contented myself with a little
bread and milk. By studying to sell cheaply, my profits in the aggre-
gate were not great, but, along with Robert, I lived frugally. Our
united daily expenses in housekeeping did not exceed a shilling. For
years after beginning business the cost of my own living was limited
to sixpence a day, and all that was over I laid out in adding to my
stock.” Afterwards, William Chambers obtained bookbinding ap-
pliances, also an old printing press and some worn type, with which, not-
withstanding that neither trade had been taught him, he was able to
both print and bind books, which were sold when completed. The
first book printed by him was “ The Songs of Burns.” As his appli-
ances were somewhat imperfect, and being a first attempt, the process
was slow, some months being consumed in the operation, but a net
profit of £9 resulted, and with this he was content.
In 1821 the two brothers started their first periodical,, “The
Kaliedoscope, or Edinburgh Literary Amusement,” published every
fortnight. Robert was the editor and principal writer. Occupied
with business, the composing frame and the press, also with some
literary composition, William Chambers records that at this time he
worked sixteen hours a day, with no more than a quarter of an hour
for meals, and never gave over the labor till after midnight. He


does not justify this excessive application to business, but condemns
it as opposed to the laws of health. Enthusiasm alone kept him up,
combined with an intense desire to gain independence in the end
He acknowledged that if it had not been for the weekly repose and
fresh air of Sunday, he would probably have broken down. The
“ Kaliedoscope ” ceased publication in 1822. It was in 1882 that the
two brothers first established their magazine known as “ (diambers’
Journal,” the circulation for which up to the second weekly number
being 50,000 copies, but on the appearance of No. 3 the sale rose up
to 80,000 copies, at which it long remained, and has since then
largely increased with the spread of population. In 1842 “Chambers’
Information for the Public ” was first published. Of this it has been
estimated nearly 200,000 copies were sold in Europe and America up
to 1870. In 1844, Robert Chambers, assisted by Dr. Oarruthers, of
Inverness, wrote and published “ The Cyclopaedia of English Litera-
ture,” which now embraces 832 different authors, with specimens
of their writing in many cases. This work has been highly popular,
as, within a few years after its appearance, 130,000 copies were sold
in England, besides a large sale from a reprint in America. In 1859
“ Chambers’ Encyclopaedia, or Dictionary of Universal Knowledge,”
was commenced, and completed in ten yearly volumes by 1868. This
was said to be their crowning effort in cheap literature; it is the most
useful of all their publications, the circulation being very large,
and it has become a standard work throughout all parts of
the civilized world. Chambers’ Encyclopaedia contains 27,000 dis-
tinct articles written by those who were practically acquainted with
the subjects, 3400 wood engravings, and 39 colored maps, the ten
volumes comprising 8320 pages large royal octavo, printed in brevier
type. Business prospered amazingly with the brothers, and their
publishing premises in High-street was one of the sights of Edinburgh.
In this establishment nearly 200 hands were employed. In 1849,
William bought an estate in Peebleshire, and in 1859 presented to
his native town of Peebles, a building known as the Chambers’
Institute, containing a library, a reading room, a lecture hall, a
museum, and a gallery of art. The library contained 10,000 volumes,
William wrote several popular works, but Robert was the most volu-
minous in authorship, all his books having a great circulation. His
second last work was “ The Book of Days,” beginning in 1860, and
completed in 1867. This is a miscellany of popular antiquities in
connection with the calendar, including anecdotes, biographies, curio-
sities of literature, and oddities of human life and character. The
work was a success, but the labor and study involved in it was so
great that he overtaxed his strength, and spoke of it afterwards as
his death blow. While engaged in the work also, he lost his wife and
daughter. After this he retired to his country house in a very preca-
rious state of health. Robert Chambers only lived to write one more
book. “ The Life of Smollett.” In 1868 the honorary degree of
L.L.D. was conferred upon him by the University of St. Andrew’s,
and in 1871 he died at the age of 69. William Chambers still lives,
and has received great honor from his fellow men; thus, in 1865 and


1869, he was elected Lord Provost of Edinburgh, which ranks similar
in position to Lord Mayor of London, and in 1872, the Edinburgh
University conferred upon him its honorary degree of L.L.D, During
1882 he issued a small memorial volume, giving a history of his long
and useful life, embracing within twenty years of a century. The
occasion of this was the jubilee of “Chambers’ Edinburgh Journal,”
which had been in existence for 50 years on the 4th of Febru-
ary, 1882,
Alexander Dumas, born 1803, in the north of France, His father
was a Republican General, and his grandmother a Negress, thus
making him partly of African origin although a Frenchman by birth.
His father died when Dumas was quite a child, and he thus obtained
a very imperfect education. At the age of 20, he came to Paris for
the purpose of seeking his fortune. He was a very prolific author,
having written 80 dramas and 40 novels, and besides this he employed
a number of poor authors and literary hacks, whose circumstances or
position prevented them from demanding a legitimate price for their
labor. To these persons, Dumas would give a brief outline of a novel
or drama, and on its composition pay them a wretched pittance for
the work, which then appeared as the production of his marvellous
pen. Thus it happened that Dumas issued more books in a year from
his novel manufactory than it was possible for any man to write in
the same period of time; many of these represent a low state of
morals, rather repulsive to English ideas, and are not to be recoin--
mended for general reading. Dumas received extravagant prices for
his works, having been known to charge as much as a franc (lOd.)
per line, many of the lines consisting of a single word, such as Yes !
No ! Ah ! Oh ! This author’s work had an immense circulation, both
in France and England, the most popular being “ The Count of
Monte Cristo,” and “ The Three Musketeers,” and it was estimated
that up to 1868 he had received over ,£750,000 from the beginning
of his literary career till then. Nothing of this immense sum, how-
ever, remained, because of the reckless expenditure of the man, who
squandered the money as fast as he received it in dissipation, pleasure
and vanity. He died in 1870, aged 67.
Alfred Tennyson, popularly believed to be the greatest poet living,
born 1809, at Somerby, Lincolnshire, son of the late Rev. George
Clayton Tennyson, L.L.D. His father was a very energetic man,
besides being noted for great stature and physical strength. From
him, our poet received the first portion of his education, and after-
wards entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where his education was
completed. Here, when an under-graduate, he received the gold
medal given by the Chancellor of the University in 1829, for the best
English poem, the subject being “ Timbuctoo.” It is stated, that in
1830 and 1833, he issued two small volumes of poetical efi'usions, but
they did not succeed with the English public, and were coldly re-
ceived by critics. We have no information regarding the circulation
of these. Nine years passed, and then, in 1842, the poems referred
to, were published with many others of remarkable beauty in 2 vol-
umes, when the victory was won and he became famous. The circu-


lation was large, the 17th edition being issued in 1865. In 1847
“The Princess” was first published, the 13th edition being printed
in 1865. “In Memoriarn,” Ist edition 1850, 17th edition 1865.
“Idylls of the King,” first published at London, July Ist, 1859.
Sale in six weeks about 10,000 copies. At Boston also, this was
published during the same year, and the 11th thousand within a
month. The “ Holy Grail,” first published December, 1869, 40,000
copies being ordered in advance, and other editions issued since.
An edition of Tennyson’s Poems was published at Paris 1867, in
five volumes, at 10 francs (or Bs. 4d. English money) and sold at the
rate of 6000 volumes, or 1,200 copies, per month. Besides the poems
named, Tennyson wrote several others, and in 1869 a concordance of
his complete works up to that time was issued. In 1846, the Eng-
lish Government, in recognition of Tennyson’s merits, conferred a
pension upon him, and in 1850, when Wordsworth died, he succeeded
him as Poet Laureate, a position he has held ever since. Early in
1869, Messrs. Strachan & Co., the London publishers, purchased the
copyrights of Tennyson’s works from the author, the terms being
,£4OOO per year for twenty years, this firm also to publish any new book
produced by the poet during that time. All tins shows Tennyson to
have been a very successful author, taking into consideration the fact
that he has written nothing but poetry, which is generally reckoned
to be a very dull class of literature, and on an average, amongst
the poorest paid of any in the world, as we find it now.
W. M. Thackeray, born at Calcutta, 1811. His father was de-
scended from a Yorkshire family, and held an important position
under the East India Company. This gentleman died in 1816, aged
30, when his little son was but 5 years old. In 1817, Thackeray was
sent home to England, and during the voyage the ship visited St.
Helena, where the great French Emperor, Napoleon, was kept in
exile, after the battle of Waterloo, and his defeat by the British.
In one of Thackeray’s later works, he thus refers to this incident—
“ Our ship touched at an island on its way home, where my black
servant took me a walk over rocks and hills till we passed a garden,
where we saw a man walking. ‘ That is Bonaparte,’ said the black,
‘ he eats three sheep day and all the children he can lay his
hands on.’ ” We can imagine the terror produced upon the youthful
mind of the boy by such a statement, before he could reason upon its
credibility, and feel sure that he would not be at ease till the ocean
was placed between him and such a monster. This black servant,
however, was no worse than many guardians of children now, who
frighten them into submission by telling tales about giants, dragons,
and other dreadful creatures. Thackeray, on reaching England, was
educated at Charterhouse School, and afterwards studied at Trinity
College, Cambridge, up to 1830. In 1832, on attaining his majority,
he came into possession of £20,000 left by his father, but this was
soon dissipated by playing at cards with friends and others, who
fleeced him, and engaging in some foolish newspaper enterprise which
resulted in loss to all concerned. Thackeray, in truth, was too good
hearted and simple to be trusted with much money at one time, and


he thus became the prey of many a clever rogue, who found him a
willing victim to their designs. His friends originally intended him
to become a lawyer, but he showed an aversion to this by prefering
drawing and painting, which he cultivated for some years at the Fine
Arts Galleries of Weimar, Rome and Paris. Finding, however, that
he succeeded better as a writer, Thackeray afterwards devoted himself
to that as a profession. In 1832, when aged 21, he wrote a short sketch
entitled “ Elizabeth Brownrigge,” for Fraser’s Magazine ; but it was
not till 1837 that we find him coming more prominently forward,
when the “History of Samuel Titmarsh,” and “The Great Hoggarty
Diamond ” appeared in the same periodical. Thackeray’s literary
career may be practically said to have commenced at this period, as
he was a constant writer and contributor to Fraser’s Magazine,
London Punch, (first established in 1842), and the Cornhill
Magazine, (originally published in 1860) of which he was ap-
pointed editor, and occupied that position till April, 1862. The
success of the Cornhill Magazine was secured from the beginning, as
when No, 1 was published, the large number of 110,000 copies were
sold, and on No. 2, fully 100,000 copies; a circulation which was
steadily kept up, and since then it has continued to be one of the
most popular magazines published. Thackeray received an enormous
compensation while connected with the Cornhill Magazine ; indeed,
it is stated that when writing two tales in each number during 16
months he was paid £365 for every month of the time. His prin-
cipal novels are “ Yanity Fair,” first published 1848, “ Pendennis,”
in 1850, “ The Newcomes,” in 1853, “Esmond,” in 1854, and “The
Virginians,” in 1859. These from the first were extremely popular
and have been since published in a great variety of editions. He
also delivered lectures on “ The English Humorists,” and “ The
Four Georges,” which were received with great favor when published
in book form. The English Humorists are divided into six lectures,
dealing with Swift, Congreve, Addison, Steele, Prior, Gay, Hogarth,
Smollett, Fielding, Sterne, and Goldsmith. As a merciless exposer
of vanity and shams and an acute observer of men and women as
they are, Thackeray has never been surpassed. To give an idea of
his style we here include two selections from his lectures on the
“Four Georges”
The last years and end of George 111. : —“ All the world knows
the story of his malady; all history presents no sadder figure than
that of the old man, blind and deprived of reason, wandering through
the rooms of his palace, addressing imaginary parliaments, reviewing
fancied troops, and holding ghostly courts. I have seen his picture
as it was taken at the time. The poor old father is represented in a
purple gown, the star of his famous order still idly shining on it.
He was not only sightless ; he became utterly deaf. All light, all
reason, all sound of human voices, all the pleasures of this world
were taken from him. Some slight lucid moments he had, in one of
which, the Queen, desiring to see him, entered the room, and found
him singing a hymn, and accompanying himself on the harpischord.
When he had finished he knelt down and prayed aloud for her, and


then for his family, and then for the nation, concluding with a prayer
for himself that it might please God to avert his heavy calamity from
him, but if not, to give resignation to submit. He then burst into
tears and his reason again fled. What preacher need moralize on this
story ; what words, save the simplest are requisite to tell it 1 It is
too terrible for tears. The thought of such a misery smites me
down in submission before the ruler of kings and men, the mon-
arch supreme over empires and republics, the inscrutable dispenser
of life, death, happiness, victory. Low he lies to whom the proudest
used to kneel once, and who was cast lower than the poorest, dead,
for whom millions prayed in vain. Driven off his throne, buffeted
by rude hands; with his children in revolt, the darling of his age
killed before him ultimely; our Lear hangs over her breathless
lips and cries—
“ Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little !
Vex not his ghost; Oh let him pass ;he hates him
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer !”
Hush ! strife and quarrel over the solemn grave ! Sound trumpets
a mournful march. Fall dark curtain upon his pagent, his pride, his
grief, his awful tragedy.”
Sketch of George IY.—“ To take a portrait of him at first seemed
a matter of small difficulty ; there is his coat, his star, his wig, his
countenance simpering under it; and yet, after reading of him in
scores of volumes, hunting him through old magazines and news-
papers, having him here at a ball and there at a public dinner or
a race, you find you have nothing but a coat with a wig and a
mask smiling below it. I look through all his life and recognise
nothing but a bow and a grin. I take him to pieces and find silk
stockings, padding, stays, a coat with rich frogs and a fur collar, a
star and a blue ribbon, a pocket-handkerchief prodigiously scented, a
nut brown wig scented with oil, a set of teeth and a huge black stock,
under waistcoats moving under waistcoats, and then nothing.
Lovers of long sums have added up the millions and millions
which in the course of his brilliant existence, this single prince
consumed. Besides his income of <£50,000, £70,000, £IOO,OOO and
£120,000 a year, we read of three applications to Parliament to
clear off debts to the tune of £160,000 and £650,000, besides
mysterious foreign loans, whereof he pocketed the proceeds ! What
did he do for all this money 1 Why was he to have it 1 If he
had been a manufacturing town or an army of five thousand men,
he would not have cost more. He,- one solitary, stout man, who
did not toil, nor spin, nor fight; what had he done that he should
be pampered sol In 1784, when he was twenty-one years of age,
Carlton Place was given to him, and furnished by the nation with
as much luxury as could be devised. His pockets were filled with
money ; he said it was not enough ; he flung it out of the window
and actually spent £IO,OOO a year for the coats he wore; the
nation gave him money, and more, and more. The sum is past


counting.” When George IV. died, in 1830, his relatives found
£IO,OOO in his boxes, besides other money scattered about everywhere,
of which a great deal was gold. There were also about 500 pocket
books, each containing money of different amounts in guineas and bank
notes. Besides all this, there was a great quantity of trinkets and
trash discovered, much of which was destroyed as unworthy of being
retained —See “ Greville Memoirs.” This Prince’s life was made up
of drink, dress, gambling, pleasure, and licentiousness. “ The lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life.”
Thackeray died suddenly in his bedroom at London on Christmas
Eve, 1863. The “London Times” of next day (25th December) thiis
speaks of the event—
“ One of our greatest literary men has departed. Never more
shall the fine head of Mr. Thackeray, with its mass of silvery hair,
be seen towering among us. It was but two days ago that he might
be seen at his club radiant and buoyant with glee, yesterday he was
found dead in his bed. His madical attendants attribute his death
to effusion on the brain. They add that he had a very large brain,
weighing no less than 58J ounces.”
This represents 3 lb. 104 oz., which must be remarkable, consider-
ing that the average weight of a man’s brain, according to physio-
logists, ranges from 2 lb. 12 oz. to 2 lb. oz. As an additional
fact, we find that Lord Byron’s brain weighed 4| lb., and that of
Cuvier, the great naturalist, 4 lb. 134 oz., stated to be the heaviest
on record.
Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, born in 1812, at Litchfield, Connec-
ticut, America, daughter of Lyman Beecher, D.D., and sister to ReY.
Henry Ward Beecher, the famous preacher of Brooklyn. In 1836
she married Rev. Calvin E. Stowe, D.D. Besides attending to the
numerous wants of a family she had a taste for literature, and con-
tributed several tales and sketches to different magazines. But it
was not until “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” appeared that she can be said to
have attained a popularity, which has increased as years have rolled
on. The work was first issued in a weekly newspaper called the
“Washington National Era,” during 1851, and completed early in
1852, when Mrs. Stowe experienced some difficulty in getting a pub-
lisher to take the risk of having the book printed. After persever-
ing for some time she persuaded an enterprising young bookseller at
Boston to publish it during the same year. The success of the book
was immediate and great. In the United States, within eight weeks,
100,000 copies were sold, 200,000 copies within a year, and 313,000
by April, 1856. At London, 30 different editions were published in
six months. The “Edinburgh Review,” April, 1855, thus speaks
of it—“ The first London edition was published May, 1852, and was
not large, for the European popularity of Negro life was doubted.
But in the following September, the London publishers furnished fo
one house 10,000 copies per day for about four weeks, and had fo
employ 1000 persons in preparing copies to supply the demand. We
cannot follow it beyond 1852, but at that time more than a million
of copies had been sold in England, probably ten times as many as


has been sold of any other work except the Bible and Prayer Book.
Before the end of 1852 it had been translated into nine different
languages, besides being dramatised in twenty different forms, and
acted in every capital of Europe as well as America. From that
time till now the popularity of “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ” has continued
unabated. How many copies have been published and sold since then
it is impossible to say, but the number must represent several mil-
lions at the lowest estimate, and it has been issued in every variety
of form and price. Thus a penny edition of the book was published
in 1881. Up to 1862 “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” had been translated
and published in the following languages :—French, 3 or 4 versions;
Dutch, 2 ; German, 13 or 14; Danish, 1 ; Swedish,! ; Portuguese, 1 ;
Spanish, 1 ; Italian, 1 ; Welsh, 2 ; Russian, 2 ; Polish, 1 ; Magyar
1 ; Wendish, 1 ; Wallachian, 2; Armenian, 1 ; Arabic, 1 ; Romaic, 1.
It is also said that a Chinese and Japanese version were pub-
lished. Is it not remarkable that such a book as this should have
been written by Mrs. Stowe from week to week, while a family of
little ones were moving to and fro round her claiming their mother’s
care; and interrupting her with their cries, their tears and laughter,
pulling at her gown, or asking for bread and butter; yet this was a
fact, for, although an authoress, she was a kind and attentive parent
to her children. Up to 1875 Mrs. Stowe had written nearly thirty
different works, besides contributing to several magazines. We give
the following information regarding three of the most popular works:
“ Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” first issued at Boston, 1853, within a
month 90,000 copies were published in the United States. “ Dred, a
tale of the Great Dismal Swamp,” first published at London and
Boston during 1856, by the end of which year over 100,000 copies
were sold, and up to August, 1857, 150,000 copies in the United
States. In London, the number sold during 1856 was 125,000 copies.
“ The Minister’s Wooing,” first published at New York, Boston and
London, 1859. Up to 1860 30,000 copies were sold in the United
States, and 50,000 copies in England by 1869. These, with others of
her works, have since been published in a great variety of editions.
Charles Dickens, born 1812, at Landport, Portsmouth, England,
son of John Dickens, a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, and who,
when the French war terminated in 1815, retired on a small pen-
sion and afterwards became a reporter of parliamentary debates at
London. The early days of Charles Dickens may be described in a
few words. He was kept at home by his parents till seven years
old, before being sent to any school. Forster thus speaks of him :
“He was a very little and a very sickly boy. He was subject to
attacks of violent spasm which disabled him for any active exertion.
He was never a good little cricket player, or never was a first-rate
hand at marbles, or peg-top, or prisoner’s base ; but he had a great
pleasure in watching the other boys at these games, reading while
they played, and he had always the belief that this early sickness
had brought to himself one inestimable advantage in the circumstance
of his weak health having strongly inclined him to reading.” His
favorite books then were “ Robinson Crusoe,” “ Arabian Nights,”


“ Don Quixote,” and “ Fielding’s Works.” He was placed at school
for the first time in a small private academy at Chatham, where he
remained two years, but this was abruptly terminated by the family
removing to London, and at ten years old little Charles Dickens was
put into his first situation at a blacking manufactory kept by a rela-
tive of his mother, the wage being 6s. per week. So powerful was
the impression produced upon the mind of Dickens by his ex-
periences during this period, that many years afterwards when writ-
ing “ David Copperfield,” which may be styled his biographical
novel, he thus speaks of his life then: “It is wonderful to me how I
could have been so easily cast away at such an age. It is wonderful
to me that, even after my descent into the poor little drudge I had
been since we came to London, no one had compassion on me, to
suggest that something might have been spared, as certainly it might
have been, to place me at any common school. My father and
mother were quite satisfied. They could hardly have been more so
if I had been 20 years of age, distinguished at a grammar school,
and going to Cambridge.”
“ The blacking warehouse was the last house on the left hand side of
the way, at Old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old
house, abutting of course on the river, and literally over run with
rats. Its wainscotted rooms and its rotten floors and staircase, the
old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their
squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt
and decay of the place rise up visibly before me as if I were there
again. The counting house was on the first floor, looking over the
coal barges and the river. There was a recess in it in which I was to
sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste blacking, first
with a piece of oil paper, and then with a piece of blue paper, to tie
them round with a string, and then to clip the paper close and neat
all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an
apothecary’s shop. When a certain number of pots had attained this
pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then
go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at
similar duty downstairs at similar wages. One of them came up in
a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to
show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name
was Bob Fagin, and I took the liberty of using his name long after-
wards in “ Oliver Twist.” Bob Fagin was an orphan, and lived with
his brother-in-law, a waterman. It was not long before he and I,
with another boy, named Paul Green, worked side by side. Green’s
father had the additional distinction of being a fireman, and was em-
ployed at Drury Lane Theatre. No words can describe the secret
agony of my soul as I sunk into this companionship, compared these
every-day associates with those of my happier childhood, and felt my
early hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man,
crushed in my breast. The deep remembrance of the sense I had of
being utterly neglected and hopeless, of the shame I felt in my
position, and of the misery it was to my young heart, cannot be
written.” In this situation Charles Dickens remained about two


years, but his father —having quarrelled with the blacking manufac-
his son away when he was 12 years old, and from 1824
to 1826, we find that he was placed in two different private schools
to.finish, his education.
~ Regarding the parents of Charles Dickens, we give the following
curious information from one who knew them well.—“ Mr. John
Dickens was a kind-hearted man, but fearfully irascible. His fits of
temper, lasted, however, but a very short time, but whilst they did
they were terrible. On one occasion, some private theatricals were
given at St. James’s Theatre in which Charles Dickens took the prin-
cipal character, and old Mr. Dickens was appointed bill distributor
for the evening. Charles had given strict orders that no one should
be admitted behind the scenes. The elder Dickens returning to the
green-room, was surprised to see a man, as he thought, standing at the
other end of the appartment. His blood boiled in an instant, and he
flew :at him. His anger increased at seeing the figure advance
towards him, and he rushed up to it and struck out with all his
might, hitting a looking glass with such violence that he had sore
knuckles for some days afterwards. The resemblance between old
Mr. Dickens and Mr. Micawber consisted in one or two peculiar
traits exaggerated in the description and the use of a pet phrase to
the effect “something was sure to turn up.” Mrs. Dickens was a
little woman, who had been very nice looking in her youth,. She
had very bright hazel eyes, and was as thoroughly good-natured easy-
going companionable a body as one could wish to meet with. She
possessed an extraordinary sense of the ludicrous, and her power of
imitation was something quite astonishing. On entering a room,
she almost unconsciously took an inventory of its contents, and if
anything happened to strike her as out of place or ridiculous, she
would afterwards describe it in the quaintest possible manner. She
had also a fine, vein of pathos, and could bring tears to the eyes of
her listeners when narrating some sad event. It is highly probable
that. a. great deal of Dickon’s genius was inherited from his mother.
Ife possessed from her a keen appreciation of the droll and the
pathetic, as also considerable dramatic talent. Mrs. Dickens often
sent friends into uncontrollable fits of laughter by her funny sayings
and inimitable mimicry. Charles was decidedly fond of her, and
always treated her respectfully and kindly. In the hour of her be-
reavement when the father died,(lßsl) his conduct was noble. He
took her in his arms, and they both wept bitterly together. He
told her that she must rely upon him for the future. He imme-
piately paid whatever his father owed, and thus relieved his mother
on that score. The little Dickens’s were all fond of private theatri-
cals, and even as children they constructed a small playhouse in
which the drama was represented by puppets. t Charles was the
reader, and his brothers moved the marionettes. Poor old Mrs.
Dickens died in 1863.”
In 1826, after finishing his education, Chas. Dickens was placed
Iy, his father in a solicitor’s office with the intention of making him
a lawyer. This had soon to be abandoned however, as he showed a


decided aversion to the profession, and his father having now become
a reporter for the newspapers, the son followed in the same direction.
By the influence of the elder Dickens, Charles commenced his first
engagement as a reporter for an office in Doctor’s Commons when
between 17 and 18 years old. In 1831 he became a reporter for the
“True Sun,” a London newspaper, and in 1834 joined the “Morning
Chronicle.” It is at this point that the literary career of Charles
Dickens began, which afterwards made him famous, for in the even-
ing edition of the same newspaper he issued the series of articles
which were afterwards published under the title of “ Sketches by
Boz.” The first series of this was sold by Dickens to a London pub-
lisher named Macrone for £l5O. In the meanwhile Dickens had
commenced to write “ Pickwick Papers,” issued monthly by Messrs.
Chapman and Hall, for which they were to pay him 15 guineas per
number, each of which filled 32 pages demy octavo. For the first
five months “ Pickwick” threatened to be a failure, though great exer-
tions were made to circulate the work, and it was very nearly being
abandoned by the publishers until “Sam. Weller” made his appearance,
which produced quite a revolution among English readers, and
everybody went mad about Pickwick. The book is said to have
reached an unheard of popularity at that period, as on its completion
in 24 shilling numbers, the circulation had reached 40,000 copies.
Chapman and Hall paid Dickens £2,500 from first to last for the
book. Its enormous success justified them in departing from the
original agreement, besides which they gave him the 15 guineas per
number as then arranged. These gentlemen are said to have
made a clear profit of nearly £20,000 by the sale of the “ Pickwick
Papers ” after paying the sums just named. Macrone, the publisher
who bought the first series of “Sketches by Boz,” seeing the success
of “Pickwick” threatened to issue the “Sketches” in similar numbers,
and to prevent this, Chapman and Hall had to pay him £2OOO for
the copyright of the book by instructions from Charles Dickens,
The work was afterwards completed by the publication of the 2nd
and 3rd series, and has been immensely popular, being published in
innumerable editions. It almost makes our mouth water to remember
the pleasure derived from reading the following sketches for the first
time many years since. “The Boarding House,” “The Tuggs at
Ramsgate,” “ Horatio Spark ins,” “ The Steam Excursion,” “ Mr.
Watkins Tottle,” and “ The Bloomsbury Christening,” besides others
in the same book. Dickens wrote a large number of other novels and
separate publications. From these we now make a selection of the
most striking, with facts regarding their circulation and popularity.
In 1837 “Nicholas Nickleby” began to be issued in shilling numbers
from 1 to 20, being published complete in 1839. For this Dickens
was paid £l5O per number by Chapman and Hall, making £3OOO
for the entire work of 20 numbers. The circulation of “ Nicholas
Nickleby” was 50,000 copies for the first number published, which
we have no doubt was much increased as the work progressed.
During the same period “Oliver Twist” was published in Bentley’s
Miscellany and issued complete by the same publisher, 1839. This


was written to expose the numerous abuses then prevalent in English
workhouses, and being powerfully illustrated by George Cruikshank,
became one of the most popular among Dickens’ productions. It was
in 1840 that “The Old Curiosity Shop” first appeared in weekly
numbers at 3d., the circulation being 70,000 copies. For this the
author received £SO per number, and by arrangement he was after-
wards to receive half the profits realised, the other half going to the
publisher. This is one of the most pathetic and touching among
Dickens’ works, containing as it does “ The Death of Little Nell,”
so famous at reading entertainments, upon which a beautiful song
has since been written, set to music, and sung at many concerts
in different parts of the world. The “ Old Curiosity Shop ” was
followed by “ Barnaby Rudge ” in 1841, which gives a graphic and
stirring description of the Lord George Gordon riots in London dur-
ing 1780, The circulation of this was fully equal to the proceed-
ing work.
In January, 1842, by way of change, Dickens determined upon
making a voyage to America, and afterwards published the results of
his experience in a book titled “American Notes, for general circu-
lation.” During the same year four large editions were sold. It must
be remembered that steamship architecture at this time was, compara-
tively speaking, but in its infancy, the first steamer that crossed the
Atlantic being the Great Western, which sailed from England to
America in 1838, within four years previous to that of Dickens’ visit.
Such magnificent vessels as the Austral and the Orient, with the
Rome, the Carthage and others of a similar class, were then unknown,
the largest being but little bigger than our modern tug-boats, with
very few of our modern appliances for comfort or convenience. Our
author left England just at the end of the winter season, when
boisterous weather and all the agonies of sea sickness were to be ex-
pected by any one venturing upon the briny ocean. Dickens seems
quite at home in the narrative, however much he may have been
abroad whilst upon the turbulent bosom of the deep blue sea. The
scenes described are an extraordinary mixture of the ridiculous and
sublime, which taken altogether, make it the best description we have
yet seen of a steamboat in a storm.
“It is the third morning. I am awakened out of my sleep by a
dismal shriek from my wife, who demands to know whether there is
any danger, I rouse myself and look out of bed. The water jug is
plunging and leaping like a lively dolphin; all the smaller articles
are afloat, except my shoes, which are stranded on a carpet-bag high
and dry like a couple of coal barges. Suddenly I see them spring
into the air, and behold the looking-glass which is nailed to the wall
sticking fast upon the ceiling. At the same time the door entirely
disappears, and a new one is opened in the floor. Before it is possible
to make any arrangement at all harmonious with this novel state of
things the ship rights. Before one can say “ Thank Heaven ! ” she
wrongs again. Before one can cry she is wrong, she has started for-
ward, and seems to be a creature running of its own accord, with
broken knees and failing legs, through every species of hole and pit-


fall, and stumbling constantly. Before one can so much as wonder,
she takes a high leap into the air. Before she has well done that she
takes a deep dive into the water. The instant she is on her legs
she rushes backwards. And so she goes on, staggering, heaving,
wrestling, leaping, diving, jumping, pitching, throbbing, rolling and
rocking, and going through all those movements, sometimes by turns,
and sometimes altogether, until one feels disposed to roar for mercy.
A steward passes. “Steward!” “ Well sir.” “ What is the mat-
ter, what do you call this 1 ” “ Rather a heavy sea on, sir, and a
head-wind —a head-wind ! ” Imagine a human face upon the vessel’s
prow, and fifteen thousand Sampsons in one, bent upon driving her
back, and hitting her exactly between the eyes whenever she attempts
to advance one inch. Imagine the vessel herself, with every pulse
and artery of her huge body swollen and bursting under this bad
treatment, sworn to go on or die. Imagine the wind howling, the
sea roaring, the rain beating all in furious array against her. Picture
the sky both dark and wild, and the clouds in fearful sympathy with
the waves making another ocean in the air. Add to all this the clat-
tering on deck and down below, the tread of hurried feet, the loud
hoarse shout of seamen, the gurgling in and out of water through
the scuppers, with every now and then the striking of a heavy sea
on the planks above, with the deep dead sound of thunder heard
within a vault, and there is the head-wind of that morning. While
such was the state of matters out of doors, the occurrences within
were equally conflicting and confusing, but they can only be glanced
at, such as the breaking of glass and crockery-ware, the tumbling
down of stewards, the gambols of loose casks and truant dozens of
porter, and the remarkable sounds raised from within their state rooms
(cribs little bigger than coffins) by the 70 odd passengers who were
too ill from sea-sickness to get up to breakfast. To vary the delights
of the voyage, one evening about sunset, when above ten days out,
a storm came on in fearfully increasing fury, except during a lull
a little before midnight. There was something in the suspense of
that hour and in the after gathering of the storm so inconceivably
awful and tremendous, that its bursting afterwards into full vio-
lence was almost a relief. The labouring of the ship on that
night I will never forget. Will it ever be worse than this? was
a question I had often heard asked, when everything was sliding
and bumping about, and when it certainly did seem impossible
for anything afloat to be so much agitated without toppling over
and going down. But what the agitation of a steam-vessel is on
a bad winter’s night on the wild Atlantic, it is impossible for the
most vivid imagination to conceive. To say that she is flung down
on her side in the waves, with her masts dripping into them,
and that, springing up again, she rolls over on the other side,
until a heavy sea strikes with the noise of a hundred great guns,
and hurls her back; that she stops and staggers, and shivers as
though stunned, and then with a violent throbbing at her heart,
darts onward like a monster goaded into madness, to be beaten down,
and battered, and crushed, and leaped on by the angry sea; that


thunder, lightning, hail and rain are all in fierce contention for
the mastery; that every plank has its groan, every nail its shriek,
and every drop of water in the great ocean its howling voice—is
nothing. To say that all is grand, and appalling, and horrible
in the last degree is nothing. Words cannot express it; thoughts
cannot convey it. Only a dream can call it up again in all its
fury, rage, and passion.”
In 1843, “ Martin Chuzzlewit,” another book dealing with Ameri-
can life, was issued in monthly numbers, the circulation being
23.000 copies, and during the same year Messrs. Chapman and Hall
published “ A Christmas Carol,” Dickens receiving as his share £726
for the sale of 15,000 copies. Towards the end of 1843 Dickens on
receipt of £2,800 from Bradbury and Evans, the London publishers,
made an agreement assigning them a fourth share in whatever he
might write for eight years after that time. This firm published ten
different works by Dickens from 1845 up to 1857. During 1848
Dombey and Son ” appeared in a complete form after being pub-
lished in monthly numbers, and for this Dickens received £2,820
within the first six months from the publishers as his profits on the
transaction. “ David Copperfield,” after appearing in monthly num-
bers, was issued complete in 1850. Its sale in parts averaged
25.000 copies. This has been estimated to be the finest and most
popular of Dickens’ works, and is specially interesting from the
fact that many of the scenes described originated from his own
life and the experience of men around him. From 1855 to 1857,
“ Little Dorrit ” was published in monthly numbers, the average cir-
culation being over 35,000 copies. “Our Mutual Friend,” said to
have been Dickens’ last complete novel, was issued in twenty
monthly numbers, from May, 1864, to November, 1865. In 1869,
Charles Dickens began a new novel titled “ The Mystery of Edwin
Drood,” to be published in twelve monthly numbers. How vain
are the hopes and determinations of man ! He was not permitted
to complete this. The work was published up to the sixth num-
ber, the rest being unwritten. We give the last few words of this
book, as written by the author in June, 1870.
“ Come Poker,” said I, “ let me hear more about you. Tell
me—where are you going to. Poker, and where do you come from.
“Ah, Mr. Sapsea,” exclaimed the young man, “disguise from me
is impossible. You know already that I come from somewhere and
am going somewhere else. If I was to deny it, what would it
avail me •?”
“ Then don’t deny it,” was my remark.
“Or,” pursued Poker, in a kind of despondent rapture, “or if I
was to deny that I came to this town to see and heat you, sir,
what would it avail me 1 Or if I was to deny ”
This was the last scene sketched by Charles Dickens. The end
came most unexpectedly and suddenly. “He was out with his dogs
for the last time on Monday, the 6th of June, when he walked with
his letters into Rochester. On Tuesday, the 7th—after his daughter
Mary had left on visit to her sister Kate—not finding himself equal


to much fatigue, he drove to Cobham Wood with his sister-in-law,
there dismissed the carriage and walked round the park and back.
On the Bth June, he passed the whole day writing a portion of
“ Edwin Drood,” besides several letters. At dinner his sister noticed
with alarm, a singular expression of trouble and pain in his face, he
talked incoherently about trivial matters, then rose and fell where he
stood. “On the ground,” were the last words he spoke. Medical
aid was called in but the case was hopeless, and after lingering in
silence for 24 hours, he died on the 9th June, 1870, aged 58 years
and 4 months. The cause of death was effusion of blood on the
brain (or apoplexy) brought on by overwork. As the mystery of
“ Edwin Drood ” was left a fragment, the Spiritists of America con-
ceived the extraordinary idea of obtaining an imaginary continuation
and conclusion of the book. A Medium was accordingly employed
to communicate (so the story runs) with the spirit of Charles Dickens,
and by 1873, the book was completed and published, written by his
spirit pen. There can hardly be the slightest doubt however, that
the continuation and conclusion referred to, emanated simply from
the medium’s own brain, and those who have compared publications
of this kind which have been written as imitations of other great
authors, confess that they are very poor specimens indeed, when
placed beside the originals. W e give the fact, however, for what it
is worth, but not with any idea of recommending this class of litera-
ture to our readers. There is a proverbial saying “ Fools rush in
where angels fear to tread,” which we think is strikingly confirmed
by the example before us.
Dickens, besides being a novelist, was actively connected for some
time with the newspaper press. Thus, during 1845, he began opera-
tions for establishing the “ Daily News,” some of the best writers
assisting, while Dickens acted as editor. The first number was pub-
lished on January Ist, 1846, and this still continues one of the lead-
ing liberal newspapers up to the present day. For this journal,
Dickens wrote “ Pictures from Italy,” which was afterwards pub-
lished as a book during the same year. It is stated that the editor-
ship of a newspaper was not congenial to Dickens, for during 1846,
he withdrew from the position and transferred it to Mr. John Forster,
his friend and biographer. In 1850, Charles Dickens established
“Household Words,” a very popular magazine, the circulation of
which from the commencement was 90,000 per week. This continued
up till 1859, when, in consequence of commercial difficulties, it “ceased
publication, but only to appear in a new form under the title of
“ All the Year Round.” The effect of this change was to double the
circulation of the magazine above that of its predecessor. This still
continues one of our most popular periodicals. In “ Household
Words” and “ All the Year Round,” Dickens wrote a number of
novels and sketches which were afterwards re-printed. Besides the
books we have previously enumerated, he composed several other
works, but these were the most popular, being published in the
greatest variety of editions. The sale for the extra Christmas num-
bers of “ AH the Year Round,” while continued, was enormous, .run-


ning as high as 300,000 \ copies each issue. Since the death of
Dickens, his entire works—both novels and re-print articles—have
been published in a complete form from the large library edition
down to the smallest handy volume or pocket one. Indeed, such is
their popularity, that from 1870 up to 1882, 4,239,000 volumes of
Dickens’ works have been sold in England alone.
Charles Dickens was also very famous as a public reader and
entertainer for many years. His first attempt in this line was at
the little city of Peterborough, England, during December, 1853.
Dickens’ Readings from then up to the year of his death became quite
an institution throughout the land. His paid readings were given
during 1858-59, 1861-63, 1866-67, and 1868-70. The first series
comprised 125 readings. Beginning at London he visited the princi-
pal cities in England, Ireland, and Scotland, being treated every-
where with the greatest respect and affection. “At Liverpool, while
on his way to Dublin, he had an audience of 2300 people. Besides
the tickets sold, =£2oo in money was taken at the door, and hundreds
were turned away.” This reading of “ Christmas Carol,” and
“ Pickwick,” had to be thrice repeated. In Dublin he was enthusi-
astically received, and at Belfast he remarks, “ Enormous audiences,
we turn away half the town.” The net profit to himself for a time
was £3OO per week. In Scotland it was much over this, being about
£SOO. The subjects during his first reading tour was restricted to
“ The Carol,” “ The Chimes,” the trial in “ Pickwick,” “ Paul
Dombey,” “Boots at the Holly Tree Inn,” “The Poor Traveller,”
and “ Mrs. Gamp.”
The second series of readings was equally successful with the first.
Writing from Glasgow on the 3rd December, 1861, he thus describes
the scene—“ Such a pouring of hundreds into a place already full to
the throat; such indescribable confusion; such a rending and tear-
ing of dresses; and yet such a sense of good humor on the whole, I
never saw the faintest approach to. I read with the platform
crammed with people. I got them to lie down upon it, and it was
like some impossible tableaux or gigantic picnic—one pretty girl in
full dress lying on her side all night, holding on to one of the legs of
my table ! It was a most extraordinary sight. And yet, from the
moment I began to the moment of my leaving off, they never missed
a point, and they ended with a burst of cheers.” It was during 1861
that a speculative gentleman in London offered Dickens £IO,OOO to
give eight months readings in Australia. This offer being increased
to a larger sum, he was nearly persuaded to consent, but family
reasons caused the scheme to be abandoned, and the offer was declined.
So far as we can conjecture, if anyone remembers the late Walter
Montgomery when in Melbourne giving “ The Bloomsbury Christen-
ing,” at St. George’s Hall, 1868, and the Rev. Charles Clark in his
lecture on Dickens, with illustrations, at Melbourne Town Hall, 1873,
a slight idea will be gained as to the style of our author when giving
readings from his works in public.
- In 1866, Dickens began his third series of readings, closing with
an offer from Messrs. Chappell, of London, who engaged to pay him


£so per night for 30 nights. By this contract he engaged to read in
England, Ireland, Scotland, or Paris, and the fatigue he underwent
in travelling about so rapidly from place to place was immense. The
sum taken amounted to £4,720. During the same year Messrs.
Chappell arranged to pay Dickens £2,500 for another course of read-
ings, representing 42 nights. During 1867-68, Dickens gave reading
entertainments in the great cities of America, and to judge by the
enormous amount gained, this outstripped all his previous achieve-
ments, as, after paying all expenses, his profits were nearly £20,000.
This amount combined with his English receipts previously, made a
total of £33,000 gained in two years.
Dickens gave his last reading at St. James’ Hall, London, on 15th
March, 1870. The building was crowded in every part, thousands
being turned away. After saying that for 15 years previously he
had been engaged in this enterprise, Dickens thus concluded —
“ Ladies and gentlemen, in but two short weeks from this time I
hope that you may enter in your own homes on a new series of read-
ings at which my assistance will be indispensable ; but from these
garish lights I vanish now for evermore with a heartfelt, grateful,
respectful, and affectionate farewell.” The personal estate of Charles
Dickens, at death, amounted to £93,000. His remains were interred
in Westminster Abbey, side by side, with historians, poets, and
philosophers, a worthy companion of them all.
Norman Macleod, D.D., born in 1812, at Campbelltown, Argyle-
shire, Scotland. He came from a family of ministers, his paternal
grandfather occupying that position at Morven, in the same country,
while his father had charge of a church at Campbelltown for about
12 years after the subject of our sketch was born. This place is a
seaport town with a bay which formed a secure harbour for fishing
smacks and other vessels. It has long been a famous place for the
distillation and manufacture of whisky, and during the boyhood of
Norman Macleod a great deal of smuggling was carried on in connec-
tion with this, which kept a number of excise officers and men contin-
ually on the alert in watching and hunting down offenders. Norman
was first sent for education to the burgh or common school, where
the rich and poor sat side by side. Along with his school friends he
made himself familiar with every part of the vessel at the pier, and
became quite a leading spirit in boyish games and expeditions. His
father sent him for a time to Morven, to be educated by a school-
master, who was in addition to teach him Gaelic. Every week from
Friday till Monday was spent at his grandfather’s manse. This
period of his life is thus referred to in “ Keminiscences of a Highland
Parish.” “ Oh, sunshine of youth, let it shine on ! Let love flow
out fresh and full, unchecked by any rule but what love creates, and
pour it down without stint into the young heart. Make the days of
boyhood happy, for other days of labour and sorrow must come, when
the blessing of those dear eyes and clasping hands will save the man
from losing faith in the human heart, will help to deliver him from
the curse of selfishness, and be an Eden in the memory when he is
driven forth into the wilderness of life.” His experiences at this time


combined with what he had seen at his native place, created in him
a great enthusiam for the sea, and interest in sailors and ships which
bore fruit afterwards, both in sermons and books. In 1825 his father
left Campbelltown, and became minister of a church at Campsie, in
Stirlingshire, and Norman spent his last year at school in this place,
being afterwards sent to the University of Glasgow, where he took
his curriculum of arts, obtaining academical honors in logic, besides
giving great attention to the study of general literature and natural
science. In 1831 he became a student at Edinburgh University, for
the purpose of pursuing a course of theology, and during three years
as tutor to the son of a Yorkshire squire with whom he travelled
about, part of the time being spent on the continent. At this time
Norman Macleod was the presiding genius among his relations and
friends. “He quoted poetry, and told a good story, besides which
he is stated to have been passionately fond of music, sang well to the
guitar, sketched cleverly, and was a good dancer. He enjoyed
pleasant society, but through it all showed himself a thorough good-
hearted Christian gentleman to the end.
His first appointment was in 1838, when he became minister of a
church in Ayrshire. Here he remained till the Disruption in 1843,
when he removed to Dalkeith, continuing as minister of that place
up to July, 1851, when he was transferred to the Barony Church,
High-street, Glasgow, remaining there till death. During August,
or about a month after taking the last appointment, he married
Catherine Ann Mackintosh, sister to one of his fellow students.
Macleod at this time was just 39 years old, being in the very
prime of manhood and vigour. His parish had a population of more
than 100,000 persons when he began in 1851, which was increased
to fully double that number in 1872, his last year on earth. “He
loved Glasgow, and rejoiced in the practical sense, the enterprise and
generosity which characterized its kindly citizens. The very noise
of its busy streets was pleasant to his ears. It was his habit to rise
very early, and after giving the first hours to devotion, he wrote and
studied till breakfast time. The forenoon was chiefly employed
receiving persons calling on business of every conceivable descrip-
tion, and the afternoon was occupied with parochial visitations and
other public duties. When it was possible he reserved an hour dur-
ing the evening for the enjoyment of music, or for reading aloud.
He established district meeting with his people, day schools, Sab-
bath schools, a congregational savings bank, and a refreshment room.
Social festivals were occasionally held, at which reports of the work
done in connection with the church were read. Personally he had
always two and sometimes three services to conduct every Sabbath.”
“ Certainly,” says Dr. W. 0. Smith, “ never since Thomas Chalmers
was there such a prevading moral power in that city as Norman
Macleod.” Thus he refers to his work at this time when writing a
letter to a friend—“ Here am I with an Indian mission to conduct,
addressing congregations, Presbyteries, and Synods, a committee to
manage, papers to write, correspondence to carry on, missionaries to
send out and to buy their outfit, to finger shirts and examine dwell-


ings, to visit my people two days a week, preach thrice, teach a class
every Sunday, collect money to build schools and churches at the rate
of £IOOO for 14 years, to hear every man and woman who call on
me about everything down to a sore finger, besides having to rear a
family and keep my liver right.”
In the training of his children he always took a lively interest, as
the following description by his brother will show.—“ He was so
much in sympathy with them that he seemed to grow with their
growth from their earliest years. When worn out with study his re-
sort was the nursery, where he would invent all sorts of games, turn
chairs upside down to represent ships, rig up newspapers as mimic
sails, and give the baby an imaginary voyage round the room. Or,
he would in the evenings lie on the sofa or floor, with all the little
ones nestled about him listening to music or telling them the wonder-
ful adventures of “ Little Mrs. Brown” and “ Abel Fergus.” These
stories went on like the “ Arabian Nights,” with new incidents in-
vented for each fresh occasion. They were all told dramatically, and
often the fun was so great that he would laugh as heartily as the
children. But he had a higher object in view than mere amusement
when composing his nursery tales, they were never without a under-
current of moral teaching, and never failed to impress lessons of
kindness, generosity, bravery, and truth. He never left home for
any length of time without bringing some little memento to each
child and to each servant as well.”
For many years previous to his death, Norman Macleod was ap-
pointed one of Her Majesty’s chaplains for Scotland, and frequently
preached before the Queen. In 1860, “Good Words” was first es-
tablished by Mr. Strahan, of Edinburgh, and Norman Macleod
became editor, retaining this position as long as he lived. “ Good
Words” soon gained a circulation of 70,000 copies for each monthly
issue, and wherever the English language is spoken it is known. To
this magazine he contributed several works, which were afterwards
re-published. The names of these were “ The Gold Thread,”
“ Reminiscences of a Highland Parish,” “Wee Davie,” “ The Old
Lieutenant and his Son,” “ The Starling,” and a variety of sermons.
He was author also of several other works written before and after
his connection with “ Good Words.” In 1869 he was elected
Moderator of the General Assembly for Scotland. As an evidence
of his busy life at this time we give selections from a letter to his
publisher.

We have previously referred to his “ Reminiscences of a Highland
Parish,” and to judge by general opinion, this is the finest and most
popular book written by Norman Macleod, describing as it does the
home surroundings of his early childhood, with his experience among
the Highland people from whence he sprang. As a happy illustration
of his style, we give the following selection from the book, describing
life in a Highland Bothy about 1824.
“ When I was young I was sent to live among the peasantry in
the West Highlands, so as to acquire a knowledge of the language,
and living, as I did, very much like themselves, it was my delight to
spend the long evenings in their huts hearing their tales and songs.
These huts were'of the most primitive description. They were built
of loose stones or clay, the walls were thick, and the door low, the
rooms numbered one only, or in more aristocratic cases, two.. The
floor was clay, the peat fire was built in the middle of the floor, and
the smoke escaped through a hole in the roof. The window was like
a port-hole, part of it filled with glass and part with peat. One bed,
or sometimes two, with clean home-made sheets, blankets and counter-
pane, a dresser with bowls and plates, a large chest, and a corner full
of peat filled up the space beyond. Upon the rafters above—black
as ebony from peet-reek—a row of hens and chickens with a stately
cock, roosted in a paradise of heat Let me describe one of these
evenings. Round the fire are seated, some on stools, some on stones,
some on the floor—a happy group. Two or three girls, fine healthy
blue-eyed lasses, with their hair tied up with ribbon snood, are knit-
ting stockings. Hugh, the son of Sandy, is busking hooks, big Archy
is peeling willow wands, or fashioning them into baskets ; the shep-
herd Donald, the son of Black John, is playing on the Jew ! s harp,
while beyond the circle one or two herd boys in kilts, reclining on the
floor, all eyes and ears for the stories. The performances of Donald
begin the evening, and form interludes to its songs, tales and recita-
tions. But Donald, the son of Black John, is done, and he looks to
bonny Mary Cameron, while in virtue of his performance he demands
a song from her. Now Mary has dozens of songs, so lias Kirsty, so


has Flory—love songs, shearing songs, washing songs, Prince Charley
songs, songs composed by this or that poet‘in the parish—and there-
fore Mary asks “ What song 1 ” So until she can make up her mind
and have a little playful flirtation with Donald, she requests Hugh,
the son of Sandy, to tell a story. Although Hugh has abundance of
this material, he protests that he has none. But having betrayed this
modesty he starts off with one notwithstanding. When the story is
done, improvisiation is often tried, and amidst roars of laughter the
aptest verses, the truest and most authentic specimens of tale, are
made. Then follow riddles and puzzles, and Mary gives her song,
and Kirsty and Flora theirs, all join in the chorus, and who cares for
the wind outside or the peat-reek inside. There was never a more
innocent or happy group. This fondness for music, for song singing,
for improvisiation, was universal, and imparted a marvellous buoyancy
and intelligence to the people. These peasants were moreover singu-
larly inquisitive and greedy for information. It was a great thing if
the schoolmaster or anyone else was present who could tell them
about other persons and other places. I remember an old shepherd
who questioned me closely how the hills and rocks were formed,
and other questions were often odd enough. A woman, for
example, whose husband was anxious to go to Australia, stoutly
opposed the step, until she could get her doubts solved on some
geographical point that greatly disturbed her. She consulted the
minister, and the tremendous question which chiefly weighed on
her mind was whether it was true that the feet of the people
there were opposite to the feet of the people at home. And if so,
what then 1 ”
With the increase of his responsibilities and duties came an in-
crease of labor, and in 1871 he began to experience a failing of
bodily vigor until the end came. It was on Sabbath forenoon,
16th June, 1872, that the spirit of Norman Macleod passed away
from the world in which he had lived for 60 years, one of the
grandest and most devoted men of this century and of the land
which gave him birth. He left a widow with eight children to mourn
his loss. The following in memoriam lines referring to him ap-
peared in “ Good Words,” August, 1872:
“Large-fashioned, and large hearted—life and love,
Found in him room for action. Men to move
Onward and upward to a higher goal
Was the enduring passion of his soul,
Unresting and untiring. On the road
That leads through man’s humanities to God
He stood, he taught, yet ever onward went :
Not of his Sovereign only Friend and Guide,
But of ten thousand thousands to his side
Drawn by the attraction of his high intent.
“Good Words he spake : and left to cheer and teach,
When he should' be no longer within reach.
His Good Works follow ; by that friend best known
For Whom and in Whom they were done alone.”
Anthony Trollope, born in 1815, son of Mrs. Trollope, the cele-
brated authoress of the “ Widow Barnaby,” “ Domestic Manners of


the Americans,” and several other popular books. We cannot state
his birthplace with accuracy, but it must have been somewhere in the
vicinity of Winchester, a city in Hampshire, England, as here he re-
ceived the chief portion of his education, and completed it at
Harrow. He was a most fortunate man, as for many years he held
an important position in connection with the London Post Office.
This kept him in comfortable circumstances, and having inherited
the literary faculty from his mother, he was seized with a passion
for novel writing, so that, ultimately, he retired from the Govern-
ment service in 1867, and devoted himself to literature as a pro-
fession. His first publication was “The Macdermotts of Ballycloran,”
issued in 1847, and from that time up to 1880, he had written 38
different novels, all of which gained great popularity and were
widely read. Besides this, Trollope wrote several volumes of travels
describing his experiences in the West Indies, North America,
Australia, and New Zealand. During 1871 he visited Melbourne
and gave a lecture in its Town Hall, to aid the Caxton Commemora-
tion Fund. The subject was one after Trollope’s own heart, being
modern fiction, and to this he did ample justice, the lecture being
highly practical and instructive. Trollope is stated to have been the
most prolific writer among his contemporaries and is thus referred to
by one of our best authorities : “He is emphatically a man of the
time, a realist, a painter of men and manners of the present day, his
pictures look like photographs Mr. Trollope is eminently practical
and public minded, for his characters refer frequently to great public
questions, and suggest political changes.” That he was really a ready
writer will be apparent from the following conversation which took
place between him and a gentleman friend on the subject. “ Don’t
you ever find a difficulty in beginning 1 ” To which Trollope replied
“*Not at all. Why should I. I sit down to write and wh'at difficulty
is there 1 Ido just 400 words in a quarter of an hour.” Nothing
seemed to interfere with the activity of Mr. Trollope’s pen. “ When
sailing to Australia round the Cape, he had a cabin fitted with a
desk, and wrote novels at sea just as usual for a certain time, and a
certain number of pages, every morning.” Trollope may be truly
classed as a successful author, when it is stated that on retiring from
the Post Office in 1867, his previous literary productions yielded him
a handsome competency, and made him an independent man. He
died 6th December, 1882, aged 67 years.
Mrs. Henry Wood, born 1820, in Worcestershire, England. She
first appeared as a writer by contributing to the “New Monthly
Magazine,” and “ Bentley’s Miscellany,” but it was not till 1860 that
her first complete work was published. This was “ Danesbury
House,” published by the Scottish Temperance League, and for
which the authoress received a prize of £IOO. “ East Lynne” was
first published in 1861, and has attained great popularity, 120,000
copies having been sold up to 1882, and this at 6s. per copy, as it
was fully 20 years since. From 1861 till now, she has»written 26
popular novels at 6s. each, some of which are in their sth, 6th, and
Bth editions, and the cry is “ still they come! ” for she seems to be in

full vigour yet. We subjoin a list of her most popular works next to
the one before referred to. “The Channings,” first edition 1862,
21st edition 1881. “Mrs. Halliburton’s Troubles,” first edition
1862, 20th edition 1882. “The Shadow of Ashlydat,” first edition
1863, 10th edition 1882. “ Elster’s Folly,” first edition 1866, 10th
edition 1879. “Roland Yorke,” first edition 1869, 10th edition 1880.
“ East Lynne ” produced so much excitement from the beginning that
it has been brought forward on the stage as a sensational drama,
which attracted great crowds wherever played, and produced large
sums to the actors and actresses who took the leading parts. The
morality or tone of the book, however, seems to us very unhealthy
and doubtful, more calculated to injure than benefit the reader. It
is a quest! n, indeed, if it were not for the villainy and adultery re-
corded in this book, whether the work would have attained even one
quarter of the circulation which we have given, as most assuredly
these elements have chiefly produced its great popularity among men
and women since the first appearance of the work. Apart from this,
we must do Mrs. Wood the justice to say that she is a most attractive
writer, and has written some really profitable as well as interesting
books, among which may be classed “Danesbury House,” “The Chan-
nings,” and “ Mrs. Halliburton’s Troubles,” already referred to.
Canon Farrar, D.D., born in 1831, at Bombay, India, son of the
Rev. C. R. Farrar, rector of Sidcup, Kent. Up to 1874 he had
written 17 different works, the i:*sb popular being the “Life of
Christ,” first published in 2 voiumes, 1874, which reached its 12th
edition in a single year, and in the course of two years 23 editions
had been issued. Since that time a cheap edition of this work has
been published, causing a very large increase in its circulation. Dr.
Farrar is a finished classical scholar, having been educated in three
different Universities, his popularity is very wide-spread, and great
importance is attached to his utterances whether on the platform or
in the pulpit.
Miss Braddon, born in London, England, 1837, daughter of Mr.
Henry Braddon, solicitor. She began authorship at an early age,
and up to 1880 thirty-five different novels written by her were pub-
lished. The works of Miss Braddon are, generally speaking, of a
very exciting and sensational character, their nature also being
rather morbid and unhealthy. She is extremely popular, however,
as an author, and as a proof of this we need but state that when
“ Lady Audley’s Secret,” one of her early works, was first
published, six editions were sold in as many weeks after its first
appearance.
S. L. Clemens (Mark Twain), born in 1835, at Florida, Missouri,
America. He has had a strange aud varied experience. When 13
years old our author was apprenticed to a printer, and labored as
such for seven years in four of the largest American cities. During
1855, Clemens by way of change travelled down the Mississippi to
New Orleans, and took so much interest in steam navigation that he
afterwards became a river pilot, and made many voyages. The his-
tory of his assumed name is curious; while acting as a pilot he was


frequently ordered to mark twain, signifying that there were two
fathoms of water under the steamer. From this circumstance
originated the singular title by which he has ever since been known.
Getting tired at last of river life he beeame editor of a newspaper at
Buffalo, New York, where he married a lady possessed of a large for-
tune, stated to be the daughter of an American millionaire. vlark,
at the time of marriage, was worth about £5OOO, but since then it is
reported that by his writings, lectures, and interest in insurance com-
panies, he has made about £20,000 beyond this amount. The works
of Mark Twain are very popular, and have had an immense circular
tion, caused by their sensational and humorous character. The best
and most interesting of this author’s books in our opinion are “ The
Innocents Abroad,’’ and “ The Innocents at Home,” which contain
many scenes and sketches of real and genuine merit. Up to 1880,
Mark Twain, from the commencement of his literary career, had
written and published 13 different works.
Amongst other successful modern authors who are dead, we can
but refer by name to Dr. Thomas Guthrie, author of “ The Gospel in
Ezekiel ” ; John Wilson, the famous “ Christopher North,” identified
with “ Blackwood’s Magazine” for so many years from its foundation
in 1817, who wrote “Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life”;
Captain Frederick Marryat, author of “ Jacob Faithful,” and
“ Japhet in search of a Father” ; Dr. Dionysius Lardner, celebrated
for “The Museum of Science and Art”; Thomas Carlyle, author of
“ The French Revolution,” “ Lectures on Heroes,” &c. ; De Quincey,
author of “The Opium Eater” ; Albert Barnes, the great commen-
tator on the Old and New Testaments; Longfellow, the American
professor and poet; Miss Evans (George Eliot), author of “ Adam
Bede,” and “ Scenes from Clerical Life ” ; Charles Lever, author of
“ Charles O’Malley,” and “ Harry Lorrequer ” ; Sir E. B. Lytton,
author of “ Eugene Aram,” “ Last Days of Pompeii,” and many
other productions.
We can give but a few names of popular living writers, thus
Samuel Smiles, celebrated for writing fully 12 popular works, such
as “Self Help,” and “ Lives of the Engineers”; Wilkie Collins, a
voluminous writer, whose works have been translated into six lan-
guages, his most famous book being “The Woman in White”;
George Macdonald, author of “ David Elginbrod,” “ Robert
Falconer,” with other interesting works describing Scottish life and
character; Miss Muloch, authoress of “John Halifax, Gentleman,”
“A Life for a Life,” Am. ; and last but not least, Jules Yerne, the
popular French Writer, so famous for his scientific romances, who,
up to 1880, had written and published 25 different works, most of
which have had a very large circulation.
There are numerous other successful authors, both dead and living,
who could be dealt with, but space forbids our including them. We
hope, therefore, that no reader will be offended wiA us for having
omitted any favourite author or authoress, as nothing short of an
entire library would suffice for the task.
As an addendum to successful authors and specially with reference


to William Chambers, the great publisher, we have to state that after
being created a Baronet on 13th May, 1883, he died on the 21st of
the same month, aged 83 years, (born 16th April, 1800). The intel-
ligence only reached us after that portion of the Essay describing
him had been already printed off.
We must not forget at this point to give a few remarks concerning
newspapers, which may be styled the great every-day book of the
world. It is a curious question, what would the civilised globe, and
especially the British race, be without newspapers? They have be-
come a positive necessity of the present age, and we have but to be
deprived of them for a few hours by any accident to feel how neces
sary they are to our comfort and happiness. The majority of intel-
ligent persons in Melbourne, Sydney, or London it may be, would
find their equilibrium of mind seriously disturbed, if, when taking
each morning meal, they had not the newspaper at their elbow to tell
them of births, marriages, deaths, battles, accidents, robberies,
failures, frauds, inventions, and discoveries, with the thousand and
one things which go to make up this real and living existence of
ours. According to the best authorities, newspapers may be said to
have had their beginning in the Acta Diurna or Acta Publica of
ancient Rome, which were issued daily by order of the Government,
during the last years of the Republic and the Empire after it. The
contents of these comprised births and deaths, government receipts,
supply of corn, public affairs, foreign wars, news as to public build-
ings, games, fires, &c. It must be borne in mind by our readers, that
printing as well as paper making were then unknown, every publica-
tion or book had therefore to be written with the pen on parchment
or similar material. Such was the case with the “ Acta ” or Roman
newspapers, they were written in Latin, the popular language, by
clerks or notaries, and then posted up in some public position, where
any person might stand and read them as they passed. But the
Roman Government was a very despotic one ; our modern terms of
“ Conservative ” and “ Liberal ” were not then recognised. There
seems to have been only one predominant class, that of the aristocracy
or patricians, democracy had not been heard of, and the great mass
of the people were plebians, or slaves. It is difficult for us in these
modern days to understand all this, surrounded as we are with news-
papers, some representing the Conservatives, and others so strongly
identified with Liberalism ; freedom of the press was not then even
dreamt of, everything being controlled by the ruling power, without
the people having either voice or authority in the matter.
We must now leave the ancient Romans and turn to. more modern
times. The first English newspapers, otherwise styled news-letters,
were published during the reign of James I. These- were small
quarto pamphlets appearing at irregular periods, the earliest so far as
can be discovered being “ The News out of Holland,” published at
London in 1619. In 1622 these were superseded by the first regular
English newspaper, titled “ The Certaine Newes of the Present
Week,” edited by Nathaniel Butler. Previous to Queen Anne’s
reign, few of the English newspapers were published oftener than


once a week, but the tremendous excitement produced by the great
battles and victories of the Duke of Marlborough on the continent
‘created a desire for more frequent intelligence, and thus we find that
in 1709 the first daily newspaper, titled “The Daily Courant,” was
(published in London. For some yeai's previous to this there were
17 newspape s issued in that city three times a week only. During
l the ‘feign of George 111. there were frequent prosecutions against
'newspapers and their editors, because they attempted to express free-
'dom of opinion concerning various abuses or grievances which wanted
reforming. The result of all this was to spread these opinions
throughout the length and breadth of the land, and ultimately destroy
the tyranny which the English Government exercised over the news-
papers at that time. For example, the first attempt of reporting the
parliamentary debates at London in 1771 was resented by the House
of Commons as a breach of privilege, but the foolish resolutions and
imprisonments of that period only paved the way to the publicity and
freedom of discussion which has since become so universally recog-
nised wherever the English language is known.
But besides direct Government opposition, newspapers suffered
from various taxes or restrictions imposed upon them by the autho-
rities. These were the stamp duty, the paper duty, and the adver-
tisement duty.
In 1712 the English Government, in order, as they thought,
to prevent the publication of seditious newspapers, introduced
the stamp duty. This was originally fixed at Id. per sheet and |d. for
every half sheet, but it gradually increased in amount until 1815,
when 4d. was charged for every newspaper occupying a sheet in
bulk. The effect of this was to cause a great decline in the circula-
tion of newspapers, as the prices had to be increased, and it prevented
the publication of many others, which would have been established
but for the oppressive and crushing tax. After much agitation
throughout the country and in Parliament, the stamp duty was
reduced from 4d. to Id. in 1836, yielding a duty of £553,000 per
year, out of which England alone paid £473,910, in 1855 it was
finally swept away by being repealed. This tax had been in existence
from first to last for 143 years.
The paper duty was first introduced during 1694, and, so far as we
can ascertain, 3d. per pound was charged for certain quantities, and
l|d. per pound for others. This continued until 1836, when a
uniform rate of per pound was imposed upon every class of
paper, no matter what the quality might be. To show the oppressive
character of this tax, we give the following synopsis of the Excise
Regulations, which every paper manufacturer in Great Britain had to
observe and obey during its continuance:
“ He must enter his premises in the Excise books before he begins
to prepare any materials for his manufacture, or pay £200; he must
number every ream, and every machine, vat, or press in his premises,
or pay £200; he must admit the Exciseman into his mill at anytime
of the day or night, or pay £200; he must wrap separately every
ream or half ream, and mark all particulars upon the label, or


pay £lO ; he must keep separate for six hours all paper once weighed,
unless it be sooner re-weighed, or forfeit £SO; he must keep
sufficient scales and weights and allow the officers of Excise to use
them, or forfeit £SO; he must help the Exciseman to do his work,
or forfeit £200; he must abstain from sending out any paper not
tied up in wrapping perfectly labelled, or forfeit £2O; he must give
notice before he moves hi« paper from one place to another, or pay
£2O ; he must abstain from opening a stationer’s shop within a mile
of his mill, or pay £200.”
The paper duty was an oppression to the manufacturer, the news-
paper proprietor, and the book publisher. Thus we find that the
famous Charles Knight, during 20 years of his publishing experience,
expended about £BO,OOO upon authors, and paid the English Govern-
ment £50,000 for paper duty upon the books published by him within
the same period of time. Charles Knight was almost ruined by the
paper duty in connection with the publication of the “ Penny Cyclo-
paedia.” Speaking of this he says —“ I paid £40,000 for the copy-
right of the “ Penny Cyclopaedia,” when the book was finished I had
paid to the Excise £16,500 upon the paper used for that work. But
the actual duty paid was about doubled by the necessary increase of
the manufacturer’s price, produced by the duty and by the increase
of stock. That great national work would only have paid its
expenses had there been no paper duty at all.” Robert Chambers, of
W. and R. Chambers, in 1849, thus referred to the “ Miscellany of
Useful and Entertaining Tracts,” which was issued weekly at Id. per
number during nearly four years previously : “ ‘ The Miscellany of
Tracts’ published by our firm was closed as non-remunerative with a
steady sale of 80,000 copies, while it was calculated that the work, up
to the end of last year (1848), had paid £6220 of duty. Now, had
not this money been taken by the Government, we might have been
advised to continue the work. Thus was a business, which distributed
£IB,OOO per year in the employment of labor, and the profits of retail
trade, thus was an organ of intelligence and morality for the people
of this country closed by the Government as effectually as if they
had sent the police to break the presses.” During 20 years previous
to the repeal of this tax, Messrs. W. and R. Chambers paid £160,000
to the English Government for paper duty in connection with their
various publications, and in 1858, £7OOO was paid for the same tax
upon “Cassell's illustrated family paper,” issued by John Cassell and
Co. At this time the same firm paid more than £IO,OOO per year,
for paper duty, upon thirty million copies of cheap literature issued
by them. This tax restricted the consumption of paper to a consider-
able extent, thus in England the annual quantity consumed was 4|
pounds per head, while in America, where no paper duty prevailed,
the consumption was pounds. After the change in the duty
during 1836 from 3d. to the annual circulation of newspapers
published in Great Britain increased from 39,000,000 to 95,000,000
between that time and 1851. As a curious fact, in 1860 it was
stated that the paper duty seriously affected no less than 69 different
trades throughout the United Kingdom, who were injured by its


operations. In 1859 the amount received by the English Government
for paper duty was estimated at <£1,119,000. In April, 1850, the
English Parliament first considered the question of repealing the
paper duty, and this was continued several times during eleven years,
until it was finally abolished October Ist, 1861, after an existence
of 167 years.
Perhaps our readers will be surprised, but there is yet another tax
to which we must refer as affecting newspapers, and that was the
advertisement duty. This was first introduced in 1712, Is. being
charged by the Government for every advertisement printed in a
newspaper. From Is. it afterwards increased, like the stamp duty, up
to 1789, when 3s. 6d. was imposed for every advertisement in English
newspapers, and 2s. 6d. for those published in Ireland. During 1832
there was considerable discussion in the English Parliament about the
reduction of this tax, the result of which was that early in 1833 the
duty was reduced to Is. 6d. each advertisement for England, and Is.
each for Ireland. In 1850 the repeal of this duty was first brought
forward in the House of Commons, and during the three succeeding
years until August 4th, 1853, when it was also abolished after a
career of 141 years. The sum realized from the advertisement duty
just previous to its repeal was only about £160,000 per year, the poor
being taxed equally with the rich to procure this amount, and
immense injury inflicted on the community while it continued. To
show its injustice, if a duke or a lord wanted to sell an estate worth
£50,000, he required to pay no more duty than the poor servant man
or servant maid who wanted a situation ; while for an advertisement
of a line or two the Government exacted the same amount as they
did for a column in length.
Thus so many taxes on truth, intelligence, and liberty were annihi-
lated, freedom of the Press has now become a living reality, and
cheap books the order of the day.
As it may be interesting to compare the number of newspapers
published in Great Britain before and after these taxes were repealed,
we give the following statistics from “ Mitchell’s Press Directory,”
1881. “In 1849 there were in London 113 papers, in England 223,
in Wales 11, in Scotland 85, in Ireland 101, in the British Islands
14 ; total 547. In 1881 there were in London 378 newspapers, in
England 1087, in Wales 66, in Scotland 181, in Ireland 154, in the
British Isles 20 ; total 1886.” Hubbard’s Newspaper Directory of
the World, 1882, supplies the following information: “There are
published throughout the world more than 34,000 newspapers, includ-
ing under that name periodical issues of all sorts, from the daily to
the quarterly, and semi-annual. Fully one-half of these are printed
in the English language. Of this number the United States furnishes
9500, of which 525 are published in New York and Brooklyn Great
Britain and Ireland issue 4082 newspapers, Germany comes next
after the United States with nearly 5000, and France with about
2500, of which 1200 are published in Paris alone.” Of course the
reader must understand that Mr. Hubbard has included magazines
and other journals of that kind with the newspapers, as if they were


one and the same, which is not so, for they belong to a totally dif-
ferent class of literature in many cases. This is apt to create confu-
sion, and does not give a fair idea as to the number of what are
newspapers, properly speaking. It is to be hoped, however, that Mr.
Hubbard in future editions of his really useful book will keep the
newspapers entirely separate from the magazines and periodicals, so
that each country may be properly represented and understood in this
respect. The importance of this will be seen by the following
example out of many others : “Mitchell’s Newspaper Press Direc-
tory for 1881 ” gives a total, as stated, of 1886 newspapers for the
Uuited Kingdom, while Hubbard’s book for the same year makes
the number 3000. This latter number must therefore include ma<ra-
zines as well as newspapers.
Respecting daily newspapers the following are the numbers as
published in the cities named : London, (population over 4,000,000),
35, Liverpool, (population 552,425), 9 ; Manchester, (population
393,676), 5 ; Edinburgh, (population 228,190), 5 ; Glasgow, (popula-
tion 556,000), 6; Dublin, (population 273,064), 9.
Amongst newspapers, the one which seems to have the pre-
eminence above all others is that king of English journals, “ The
Times.” This famous newspaper was first established on the 13th
January, 1785, under the title of the “London Daily Universal
Register,” the original proprietor being Mr. John Walter. As the
name “ Register ” was found inconvenient and confusing, it was
altered to that of the “Times,” dating from January Ist, 1788. Mr.
Walter was a most enterprising man ; he established a better system
for transmitting news than any previously in existence, notwithstand-
ing opposition from the English Government, and in 1814 the
“Times” was printed by steam power, being the first case of this
kind on record. Previous to 1814 all printing machines were worked
by hand, and the largest number of copies which could be struck off
by this means did not exceed 250 per hour. The first “Times”
steam printing machine was set up by the inventor, a native of
Saxony, named Konig, who came to London about 1804, as he re-
ceived no encouragement from Continental printers. By application
and perseverance for several years, he at last succeeded in completing
a printing machine to be worked by steam. When the plans were
submitted to John Walter of the “Times,” he at once determined
to have his newspaper printed in future by this means. Such a
marvellous transformation was, however, accompanied with danger,
and the greatest caution and secrecy had to be observed, as the press-
men, who depended upon hand labor, would have killed the inventor
and destroyed his machine had they known what was taking place a
short distance away. “ When all was ready, the pressmen were told
to wait for news expected from the continent, and at six o’clock on a
dark winter morning, 28th November, 1814, Mr. Walter came in
among them with the damp sheets in his hand, to tell them that the
“Times” was already printed off by steam, that if they meant
violence he was ready for them, but that if they kept quiet their
wages should be continued until they got work elsewhere, Taken


completely aback they looked in amazement at the paper which he
distributed among them, and without a struggle yielded to the power
of this friendly foe.” The “ Times” of that date contained the follow-
ing notice; “ The reader now holds in his hands one of the many
thousand impressions of the “ Times ” newspaper, which were taken
last night by a mechanical apparatus. That the magnitude of the
invention may be justly appreciated by its effects, we shall inform
the public that after the letters are placed by the compositors, and
enclosed in what is called a “ form,” little more remains for man to
do than to attend and watch this unconscious agent in its operations.
The machine is then merely supplied with paper, itself places the
form, inks it, adjusts the paper to the form newly inked, stamps the
sheet, and gives it forth to the hands of the attendant, at the same
time withdrawing the form for a fresh coat of ink, which itself again
distributes to meet the ensuing sheet now advancing for impression,
and the whole of these complicated acts are performed with a velocity
and simultaneousness of movement, that no less than 1100 sheets are
impressed in one hour.”
This has been far surpassed by successive improvements since that
time in machinery and all other details connected with its publica-
tion. Thus in 1876, by an ingenious system of stereotyping 6or 8
duplicates, and working on as many machines, 60,000 copies per
hour were thrown off completely printed and ready for issue.
The following curious facts are mentioned regarding this news-
paper by a writer during the year 1867: “The paper consumed
weekly by the “Times” amounts to 70 tons, the ink 2 tons.
There are employed in the office ten stereotypers, sixteen firemen
and engineers, ninety machine men, six men who prepare the paper
for printing, and seven who transfer the paper to the news agents.
The new Walter press prints from a roll of paper three-quarters of a
mile long, cuts the sheets and piles them without help. For every
daily copy it is computed that the compositors mass together not less
than 2,500,000 separate types. The number of persons engaged in
daily working for the “Times” is nearly 350.”
Each daily copy of the “Times” occupies at least 16 pages large
news folio, (about same dimensions as Melbourne “ Argus ”) some-
times this is increased to 20 and 24 pages, printed in small type, viz.,
brevier, minion, and nonpareil, all of which is solid with the excep-
tion of leading articles, special telegraphic despatches, and foreign
'letters, which alone are leaded. By “ Sampson’s History of Adver-
tising,” published 1875, the number of advertisements in the “Times”
was estimated at an average of 2500 for each daily issue, the receipts
for which represent £IOOO per day, and if Sundays and two holidays
are excepted, this leaves 311 working days, thus making the income
of the “Times” reach the immense sum of £311,000 per year from
advertisements alone. During 1874 the circulation of the “Times”
was estimated at nearly 70,000 copies per day, and larger than that
on special occasions. Now, 1883, the circulation is stated to be
nearly 100,000 copies per day. Mr.. Hatton, in his work “.Journa-
listic London,” 1882, calculates the income of the “Times” from


advertisements and sale of copies at the almost fabulous amount of
£1,036,000 per year, but we question if this can be depended upon
as reliable. Thus, the amount just named as received for advertise-
ments is £311,000; if to that is added the receipts for sale of copies,
100,000 per day for 311 days, the result is £388,750, making a total
of £699,750 per annum. Allowing for all contingencies, we do not
think that the income of the “Times” is beyond £750,000 per year.
The expenses of a newspaper like the “ Times ” must be enormous,
yet it is reckoned to clear a profit of £IOO,OOO to £120,000 per year
after all is said and done, the income being such a large one.
We have lately seen a facsimile of the “Times,” October 3rd,
1798, which presents a very strange contrast to the same paper of
the present time. It is a small folio sheet of four pages, each 20
inches long by 12J inches wide, four columns to the page, and con-
tains 64 advertisements, the price being 6d. The small number of
advertisements may be partly accounted for by the existence of the
advertisement duty, 3s. 6d. each being then charged by the Govern-
ment. Anything of this kind, therefore, had to be very special and
important before being inserted, as it was rather a costly privilege.
Highway robberies were then frequent, there being three cases re-
corded in this paper besides the following advertisement regarding
a fourth :
“ Two hundred pounds reward. General Post Office, Tuesday,
October 3, 1798. The post boy carrying the mail from Bromley to
Sevenoaks was stopped about two miles from Farnborough, between
the hours of ten and eleven o’clock, by a single horseman, who pre-
sented a horse pistol and demanded the mail, which the boy
gave him. He offered the robber half-a-guinea, but he declined
taking it.”
Here is a list of some sports at which King George 111. was pre-
sent. “ A cheese to be rolled down the hill, prize, whoever stops it ;
a pound of tobacco to be grinned for; a Michaelmas goose to be dived
for; a good hat to be cudgelled fur ; a handsome hat for the boy
most expert in catching a roll dipped in treacle and suspended by a
string; a pig, prize, whoever catches him by the tail.”
In one portion of the paper a report appears regarding the great
rebellion in Ireland, then at its height, while another paragraph re-
cords the famous battle of the Nile, and Nelson’s victory over the
French fleet. One thing especially, we fail to find in this old news-
paper—which is quite an everyday matter with us of the present
time—and that is the numerous telegraphic despatches relating to
important events which are now sent from one side of the world to
the other, almost as soon as they take place, verifying the saying
of Shakespeare—
I’ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes.”
The electric telegraph and our modern steamboats, as well as rail-
ways, were not in existence then, this was all left for the nineteenth
century to consummate.
In 1876 the “ Times ” paid £3OOO per year for the use of a special
telegraph wire for six hours every night to Paris, where it had aa


office, in which a summary of historical news for the whole of Europe
during each day was made up, and despatched to appear in next
day’s issue. At the same period, the “Times ”by contract for three
years, had the exclusive use of a wire from London to India every
Sunday night, so that nothing might escape its observing eye.
Among other London newspapers may be mentioned the following,
with the circulation and income of each during 1880 :
“Daily Telegraph,” 250,000 copies per day; profits £120,000 per
annum.
“ Standard,” morning and evening included, 180,000 copies; profits
£60,000 per year. The “ Standard prints 160 miles of paper
per day.
“ Daily News,” 170,000 copies per day ; profits £30,000 per year.
(We can only give the circulation of the three next).
“Lloyd’s Weekly,” a London penny paper, average circulation
600,000 copies.
The “ Illustrated London News,” first established 1842, average
circulation over 100,000 copies.
The “ Graphic,” established 1869, average circulation about
100,000 copies.
The Christmas numbers of these illustrated papers have a very
large circulation beyond the average quantity, and alluding to this,
a late authority, 1882, says regarding the “Graphic,” “that over
£l4 000 were expended on the production of one of these special
season numbers,” adding, “it is doubtful whether any proprietorate
in any country has expended so vast a sum on the publication of one
single issue. Regarding one number of the “ Graphic,” published
previous to the one mentioned, over 520,000 copies were issued, and
the number was out of print in a few days. More than 160 tons of
paper were consumed printing this, and the total cost of production
was £17,000. The whole of the impressions being printed in many
colours, and each sheet having to pass through the press separately
for each of these, represents a total of 15,000,000 impressions for
that issue.” As, however, these extra numbers are published at Is.
each, the profit upon this transaction would be fully £6750, even at
wholesale price.
Before concluding this portion, we might say a few words respect-
ing Melbourne journalism.
The first newspaper on record for our Victorian capital was the
“Melbourne Advertiser, No. 1,” being issued January Ist, 1838,
published weekly by John Pascoe Fawkner. This was written in
manuscript, and 12 copies sufficed for the wants of the limited popula-
tion then, the price being Is. per copy. A portion of this was printed
in Bonwick’s “ Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip,” to which
our readers are referred. As a curiosity, a facsimile of No. 2 (pub-
lished January Bth, 1838), was issued at 6d. many years since. This
is a small folio sheet of four pages, each 13 inches long by 9 inches
wide, and containing two columns lithographically printed. The
contents of this newspaper are comprehended in fifteen advertise-
ments, four short items of news, and a notice from Mr, J, P, Fawkner


requesting subscribers to his circulating library to pay up their
arrears. The “ Melbourne Advertiser,” we have been informed,
continued up to its 9th number, M.S.S., and Mr. Fawkner having
obtained a small printing press and some secondhand type, tried to
continue it in a printed form, but as no license had been taken
for this, the paper was stopped by the Government soon after its
publication.
The first legalized newspaper in Melbourne was the “ Port Phillip
Gazette,” published by George Arden and Thomas Strode, October
27th, 1838. For a time this was under the management of the late
Thomas McCombie, who purchased the copyright. The “ Port Phillip
Gazette” continued to be published up to 1851, when it ceased to
exist. The “Melbourne Daily Telegraph,” 1874, thus speaks of it:
“ The first three volumes of the first newspaper published in Mel-
bourne (the “ Port Phillip Gazette ”) have been shipped on board the
Bangalore, consigned to the British Museum, for which institution
they have, been purchased at a cost of <£so from Mr. Strode, who was
the original proprietor and publisher of the paper. The volumes
were ottered to Sir Redmond Barry for the Melbourne Public
Library, for the same sum, but the proposal was declined, and Mr.
Strode then wrote to the authorities of the British Museum, who ac-
cepted the proposal at once. The dates of the papers contained in
these volumes are from October 27th, 1838, to December, 1841. It
is a pity that they are lost to the colony.”
Mr. .1. P. Fawkner established the “Port Phillip Patriot,” Febru-
ary 16th, 1839, of which he was proprietor up to 1845. As editor
he obtained the services of William Kerr, so long famous afterwards
as the second town clerk of Melbourne. Mr. Kerr carried it on very
successfully until the year 1845, when he retired from this, and
started another paper called the “ Melbourne Courier,” which only
continued up to the early part of 1846. Mr. Kerr’s next achieve-
ment in this line was the establishment of the “ Melbourne Argus,”
which we shall refer to hereafter. The Melbourne Public Library
has the “Port Phillip Patriot” in a number of volumes, but the
earliest of these begins with Vol. 4, the first number being 169,
January 4th, 1841. It was then published twice a week, at 6d. per
copy, being a demy folio of four pages only, each about same size as
those of the “Australasian.” The “ Patriot ” was not issued as a
daily till 1845, being thus, so far as we find, the first daily newspaper
published in Melbourne. It continued under that title till 1848,
when it became merged in a newspaper called the “ Melbourne Daily
News,” and there we will have to leave it, as this paper did not exist
very long afterwards. A volume of the “ Courier ” may also be seen
in the Melbourne Public Library.
There are other early Melbourne newspapers that might be named,
which had a butterfly existence, but as this would not tend to profit,
we hope our readers will be satisfied with what has been written.
We shall now give a short retrospect of the “ Herald,” “ Argus,”
and “ Age.”
“ Melbourne Herald.”—First number published Friday, January


3rd, 1840, it was issued twice a week, Tuesday and Friday, and con-
sisted of four pages only, demy folio, each about same size as those
of the “ Melbourne Leader ” now, the price being 6d. per copy.
The “ Herald” was not published as a daily paper till January Ist,
1849. The price continued at 6d. up to 1851, when it was reduced
to 3d., remaining at this till 1853, being increased to 6d., continuing
at that till 1860, when it was changed again to 3d., until 1863, being
then brought down to Id., at which it remained to the last as a
daily newspaper, Saturday, January 2nd, 1869. The “Herald” was
first published as an evening paper Monday January 4th, 1869, the
price of Id. being retained from that time till now.
The “Melbourne Argus.”—First number published Tuesday, June
2nd, 1846. It is a folio sheet of four pages only, less in size than
the present Argus. This was issued twice a week up to June 18th,
1849, when it was first published as a daily newspaper. The popula-
tion of Melbourne and suburbs then, according to the Argus of that
date, was only 20,000 persons. Our readers will remember the well
known motto of the Argus, “I am in the place where I am demanded
of conscience to speak the truth, and therefore, the truth I speak,
impugn it whoso list.” This is taken from a speech of the famous
John Knox. The same motto was previously used by the “Port
Phillip Patriot,” from 1841, up to 1845, and afterwards by the
“ Melbourne Courier ” (already referred to), during its existence up
to 1846. The Argus adopted this as its representative motto from
the commencement and still retains it. This newspaper was titled
“ The Melbourne Argus,” up to 1848, when the name was changed
to “ The Argus,” and during the same year, in consequence of its
getting into legal difficulties, the Argus was sold by William Kerr to
Messrs. Edward Wilson and J. S. Johnston. Mr. Johnston after-
wards withdrew from this, and his place was filled by Mr. Lauchlan
Mackinnon. Mr. Wilson died January 1878, but the Argus is still
conducted by his relatives and Mr. Mackinnon, who now possess, by
all accounts, the most wealthy newspaper business in Melbourne.
The Argus was 6d. per copy from 1846 to 1850, when it changed to 3d.,
continuing at this up to 1854, when the price was increased to
6d., remaining at this till 1860, when it changed to 3d., and has so
continued till now.
We give the following curious statistics regarding the “ Argus,”
selected from that paper, by date October 3rd, 1854. (Population of
Melbourne and suburbs then, 100,000 persons). Average circulation
of the Argus at that time assumed to be 15,000 copies for each issue.
(There were only two daily papers in Melbourne at that time, the
“ Argus ” and “ Herald,” as the “Age ” did not come into existence
till a fortnight after the date given). Composition at 2s. 6d, per
1000, about £27,000 per year. (When the Argus changed its price
to 3d., in 1850, the cost of composition was 9d. per 1000, and the
increase to 2s. Gd. was due to the gold fever then prevailing).
Engineers and machinery nearly £12,000 per year; delivery of Argus
in Melbourne and suburbs nearly £SOOO per year; reporting expenses
nearly £2500 per year; rent upwards of £3OOO per year; paper


consumed, value nearly £30,000 per year; capital required for keep-
ing up the necessary supply of paper, between £30,000 and £40,000
per year ; collection of general news and editorial work, between
£9OOO and £IO,OOO per year. By these and other charges not enu-
merated, aud including a moderate interest for capital invested, the
expenditure of the Argus was estimated at nearly £IOO,OOO per
year. The prices of labor and material at Melbourne then were
much in excess of what they are now; thus, each copy of the Argus
in 1854 was estimated to cost the proprietors sd. in its production,
and this was the chief reason why it was raised to Gd. during that
year. As a striking contrast in connection with the expenditure of
the Argus, the same issue states that while in 1850 the rent was £BO
per year, in 1854 it rose to over £3OOO (as stated), and whilst their
entire expenditure in 1850 did not exceed £6O or £BO per week, in
1854 it was nearly £3OO per day ! These facts will give some idea
as to the capital required for running a paper in Melbourne during
that period of our history.
As the year 1854 was a somewhat remarkable one, we give the
following statistics showing the average retail prices prevailing in Mel-
bourne at that time for the following provisions and articles of pro-
duce, which may interest some of our readers. Potatoes, sd. to 9d.
per lb. , cabbages and cauliflowers, Gd. to 2s. each ; onions, Is. to
3s. Gd. per lb. ; grapes, Is. Gd. to ss. per lb.; apples, 2s. per lb. :
oranges, 3s. to 6s. per doz. ; eggs, 4s. to Bs. per doz, ; butter,
3s. 9d. to ss. Gd. per lb. ; milk, Is. Gd. to 2s. Gd. per quart; flour,
sd. to 6|d. per lb. ; bread, Is. Gd. to Is. 9d. the 41b. loaf.
“ Melbourne Age.”—The first number was published Tuesday, 17th
October, 1854, the day appointed for opening the first Exhibition at
Melbourne, and the Age of that date contained a programme of the
opening ceremonies. The Age was Gd. from 1854 up to 1860, when
it changed to 3d., and so continued until 18G7, when it was reduced
to 2d., remaining at that till 1868, when it was finally reduced to Id,
per copy as we have it now. The Age has been a daily newspaper
from the beginning.
During 1869 the “Daily Telegraph” was started at Id., thus
making three daily newspapers, besides two evening ones (“ World”
and “ Herald,”) published in Melbourne, which speaks well for a
population of under 300,000 persons. (By the Census of 1881,
Melbourns and suburbs had a population of 280,836).
In Bradshaw’s Guide fqr January, 1882, we find the num-
ber of newspapers—daily, weekly, and monthly—to be 48 for
Melbourne with its suburbs. It must be confessed, however, that
out of these, the “Argus” and “ Age” take the lead both for circu-
lation and the number of advertisements included. The “ Argus ”
represents the Free Trade and aristocratic class in the community ;
its circulation during 1882 averaged nearly 15,000 copies, while it
contained an average of about 1200 advertisements for each daily
issue. The “ Age ” again, stands boldly forward as the champion of
democracy and Protection; this is the great working man’s favorite
and representative of liberalism ; during 1882 the average number


of advertisements was 1500 per day, and the circulation at the pre-
sent time is fully 50,000 copies for each daily issue of the paper. As
a curious fact, when the “Age” reduced its price to Id. in 1868,
the circulation averaged 13,000 copies per day only. This is a striking
contrast to the large number of copies sold now.
Dr. Talmage, in one of his recent sermons, thus speaks of news-
papers : “ I tell you, my friends, that a good newspaper is the
grandest temporal blessing that God has given to the people of this
century. The theory is abroad than anybody can make a newspaper
with the aid of a capitalist. The fact is, that fortunes are swallowed
up every year in the vain effort to establish newspapers. The large
papers swallow up the smaller ones. We have 7000 dailies and
weeklies in the United States and Canada, and only 36 are half a
century old. The average life of a newspaper is five years. Most
of them die young. It is high time that it was understood that the
most successful way to sink a fortune and keep it sunk is to start a
newspaper. A man with an idea starts the “ Universal Gazette,” or
the “ Millenium Advocate,” finally the money is all spent and the
subscribers wonder why their papers do not come. Let me tell you
that if you have an idea either moral, social, political, or religious,
you had better charge on the world through the columns already
established.”
In the history of books there is nothing so interesting as the rise
and progress of libraries, on which a volume could be written alone.
Our limits as to time and space forbid anything beyond a brief des-
cription, but in this we shall endeavour to be comprehensive as well
as interesting. We are informed that during 1882 a gentleman
named Rassam was despatched by the British Museum authorities
to the East for the purpose of obtaining antiquities, and that, in the
course of his rambles he discovered a collection of 10,000 clay tablets
left by Noah the Antediluvian, containing an account of his life,
and a narrative of the flood. This is said to have been the first
library in existence. During this century also, by the researches of
Layard and Smith with others in various parts of Asia, many
monuments and historical records have been revealed. Layard has
given us Nineveh and its remains, while Smith has supplied informa-
tion about Assyria and Babylonia, by which many lost secrets of
history have been made plain, and fresh material added to the world’s
stock of information. Before printing or paper making were known,
men everywhere seem to have felt the necessity of preserving in some
permanent form a record of their lives and actions with the principal
events which transpired while each nation existed. Thus the history
of Egypt, with accounts of famous men, were written by the priests
on their pyramids, palaces, tombs, and dwellings, in characters en-
graved on brass, lead, stone and wood, as referred to in the first
part of this essay, and later still, the ancient Mexicans in America
painted their records and histories on sheets of cotton cloth, some of
which are preserved to this day. All these were first attempts at
making libraries or collections of books, but they were very limited
and unsatisfactory. Strictly speaking the first real library was

established by Osyraandyas, one of the ancient Egyptian kings, about
600 years after the Deluge. This is stated to have probably con-
tained works of antiquity, besides the sacred books of the Egyptians,
but all the collection perished when Cambyses, the Persian conqueror,
invaded Egypt, and his troops ravaged that country. After this there
is a great gap, and again Egypt comes to the front as the patron of
learning and intelligence.
The Alexandrian library was founded at the city of that name by
an Egyptian prince named Ptolemy Sotor, about 290 years before
Christ. This was largely increased by the labor of other monarchs
until it reached the large number of 700,000 volumes. This splen-
did collection of literature was at length totally destroyed by the
Saracens under the command of the Caliph Omar when they ac-
quired possession of Alexandra, a.d. 642, thus having been in
existence over 900 years. The General of the Saracen army expressed
a wish to preserve this valuable library, but the Caliph was deter-
mined upon its destruction. “ If, said he, these writings agree
with the Koran they are useless, and need not be preserved, if
they do not, they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed."
“ This fanatical order was executed with blind obedience. The
volumes of parchment or papyrus were distributed as fuel among the
5000 baths of the city, but such was their number that it took
six months to consume them.” Of course it must be understood
that although the books in this library were called volumes, yet they
were simply large rolls something similar on a more extensive scale
to our modern maps, written on one side only, and even the number
given, large as it appears, would after all be very insignificant stand-
ing beside some of our largest libraries now.
As it may interest our readers, we give the dates when the earliest
European libraries were established up to the 15th century. Perugia,
Bologna, 1320 ; Cracow University, Poland, 1343 ; Royal or National
Library, Paris, France, 1350; Prague University, Bohemia, 1366 ;
St. Andrew’s, Scotland, 1411; Nuremberg, Town, Bavaria, 1445;
Glasgow University, Scotland, 1475 ; Cambridge University, Engr
land, 1475; Lincoln’s Inn, London, 1497.
In 1849, the following estimates were made as to the number of
libraries in the countries represented, giving also the quantity of
books, taking into account only those collections containing more
than 10,000 volumes.
No. of Libraries. No. of Volumes.
At the same time in America, there were 81 libraries of 5000


volumes and upwards, 49 of which were connected with Universities
and public schools. These institutions contained a total of 980,413
volumes.
For convenience sake, we shall take a brief glance at three
great libraries, beginning with the Royal or National Library
at Paris, one of the earliest in Europe. This was commenced by
King John of France, in 1350, the collection containing only 10
volumes at that time, presented by the King. The succeeding mon-
arch, Charles Y, in 1364 increased the library by a gift of 900
volumes. In the course of centuries, by donations and additions, the
number multiplied amazingly, until in 1790, there were 200,000
volumes, and in 1876, 1,7000,000 volumes and 84,000 manuscripts.
This library is said to be not only magnificent but matchless in its
character, the collection being rich in every class of books, unique
in some, and unrivalled as a whole.
The Vatican at Rome was founded by Pope Nicholas Y., 1447, and
since that time, numerous Popes and Princes have added to its
treasures, until in 1868 we find it contained 150,000 volumes, and
40,000 manuscripts, many of which are very rare and valuable.
The British Museum Library was established at London in 1753,
by a presentation of 50,000 volumes from Sir Thomas Sloane, but it
was not fairly opened to the public till 1759. The institution of
which this library forms a part has been supported from first to last
by liberal grants of money from the English Government, besides
large bequests, both of money and books, from private individuals.
Thus, for 12 years previous to 1835, George IY., as a slight return
for the immense sums expended upon him by the nation, made a
present of his father’s library, consisting of 65,250 volumes, besides
a large number of pamphlets. This library was collected by George
111. during his long reign of 60 years, and was estimated to have
cost him nearly ,£200,000. It is kept in a large hall by itself, apart
from the general collection. In 1847, the Right Hon. Thomas
Grenville presented his entire library of 20,240 volumes, valued at
£50,000. In 1849 the annual receipts of the British Museum from
parliamentary grants and the interest of private legacies was stated
to be about 50,000. Large amounts of money are spent yearly in
purchasing scarce or valuable works, besides which, by Copyright
Act, a copy of every book, pamphlet, sheet of letterpress, news-
paper, sheet of music, chart, map, or plan published in the British
Dominions, must be delivered free of charge, and within a given
time, to the British Museum. There are only four other libraries
in Great Britain entitled to this privilege, viz. :—The Bodleian
Library, Oxford ; Cambridge Public or University Library, Oxfbrd ;
Advocates Library, Edinburgh; and Trinity College, Dublin The
British Museum thus not only accumulates by purchases and be-
quets, but by the actual right to every book that is printed on
English ground, besides the innumerable newspapers and other pub-
lications. This is much on the increase, for during 1881, there were
published 4110 new books and 1296 new editions in Great Britain,
making a total of 5406 separate works, to all of which' the British


Museum would be entitled for that year. As a singular fact, it is re-
corded that in July, 1759, when the library was first opened there were
but five readers, the accommodation being limited then, the collection
small, and the demand for reading much less than it is now. But,
when the new great reading room was opened in 1857, no less than
300 could be provided for, and during that year the number attend-
ing was 53,209, or an average of 181 readers per day. This has
been largely exceeded since, as, during the year 1864, the at-
tendance was 106,050 readers, being an average of 360 per
day. This new reading room cost £150,000; height of dome,
106 feet; diameter, 140 feet, and contains about 80,000 volumes
of books, surrounding the readers in a circle. In 1857 it was
estimated that the British Museum contained three miles of
book cases, each eight feet high, which, assuming them to be
divided into shelves for octavo volumes, would give 25 miles
of shelves. This must have been largely increased since, for
while in 1858 there were only 560,000 volumes, in 1880 this
had multiplied to 1,300,000 volumes, besides 50,000 volumes
of manuscripts, with 45,000 charters and rolls. The catalogues
alone would make a library of themselves. During 1813-19 a
catalogue of the books was issued in seven octavo volumes, from then
up to 1846 it had increased to 82 folio volumes, and in 1874 this was
superseded by one general manuscript catalogue in upwards of 1600
folio volumes. The rules for admission to the British Museum
Library are, however, very restrictive, as no person under the age of
21 is admitted unless by special permission of the trustees, and those
of the required age have to bring a written recommendation from
some well known citizen before they are allowed to enter.
The following statistics show the contents of some of the principal
libraries in the world, including the three just mentioned :
Royal or National Library, Paris, 1,700,000 volumes, and 84,000
manuscripts, 1876.
British Museum, London, 1,300,000 volumes, besides 50,000
manuscripts, and 45,000 charters or rolls, 1880.
Imperial Library, St. Petersburg, Russia, 800,000 volumes, and
about 20,000 volumes manuscripts, 1874 ; (principally the spoils of
Poland.)
Royal Library, Munich, 800,000 volumes, 1874.
Royal Library, Berlin, 700,000 volumes, 1874.
Royal Library, Copenhagen, nearly 550,000 volumes, 1874.
Library of University at Gottingen, upwards of 500,000
volumes, 1874.
Royal Library, Dresden, 400,000 volumes, 1874.
Imperial Library, Vienna, 400,000 volumes, 15,000 of which were
printed before the year 1500.
Bodleian College, Oxford, 400,000 volumes, 1878.
Cambridge Public or University Library, 250,000 volumes, and
3163 volumes of manuscripts, 1872.
Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh, 230,000 volumes, 1874.
Trinity College, Dublin, 170,000 volumes, 1874.


The Vatican at Rome, 150,000 volumes, and 40,000 volumes
manuscripts, 1868.
Melbourne Public Library, opened 11th February, 1856, with
3846 volumes, which had increased to more than 120,000 volumes
by the end of 1882.
We have just been considering the growth of large libraries and
the accumulation of books in these collections, but let us think for a
moment how few of the books which appear from time to time are
destined to be famous or immortal. Thus one eloquent author
writes:
“ Remarkable, however, as is the increase of modern books, still
more extraordinary is the question of their decay. The very names
of vast numbers have perished, at all events have died out of familiar
remembrance. Paradoxical as it may seem, the chief cause of the
oblivion of books is no longer their extinction, but the fond care
with which they are preserved, and their immensely rapid multiplica-
tion. It is but too evident that wonderful treasures of thought,
beautiful poetry, vivacious wit, and ingenious argument which men
would not suffer to die if they could help it, must perish too, for the
truth is that the creations of the human mind transcend its capacity
to collect and preserve them. Like the seeds of life in the vegetable
world, the intellectual powers of man are so prolific that they run to
waste. The Press is more than a match for the moth and the worm
or the mouldering hand of Time; yet the great destroyer equally
fulfils his commission by burying books beneath the pyramid which
is formed by their accumulation. It is a striking example of the
impotence with which man struggles against the destiny which
awaits him and his works, that the very means he takes to ensure
immorality destroys it, that the very activity of the Press—the in-
strument by which he seems to have taken pledges against time and
fortune—is that which will make him the spoil of both. In many
cases the books are only made mummies of, the works of the great
mass of extant authors are deposited in libraries and museums, like
the bodies of Egyptian kings, retaining only a grim semblance of life,
amidst neglect, darkness, and decay.”
A modern writer gives the following statistics : “It is estimated that
of 1000 books published annually in Great Britain, 660 are forgotten
within the year, another 150 within three years, not more than 50
survive seven years, and scarcely 10 are thought of after twenty
years. Of the 50,000 books published in the 17th century, not more
than 50 are now in estimation, and of the 80,000 published in the
l‘Bth century, not more than 300 are considered worth re-printing,
and not more than 500 are in high repute. Since the earliest periods,
not more than 500 authors throughout the world have survived the
outrages of time, and ungratefulness of man.”
But although there were in existence so many stores of literature
as we have recorded, yet they were very exclusive and restrictive in
their character. It was only the wealthy or learned who had excess
to the majority of these, and in the few cases where the outside pub-
lic gained admission, it was by special permission only. One thing


was yet wanting, the people at large were excluded from the privi-
leges and benefits of these institutions, and for many years the ques-
tion of free libraries agitated the public mind. One hundred years
ago no free public library existed in Great Britain, nor yet in the
world so far as we can ascertain, and it is only within the last 40
years that they were introduced into England. To Scotland is due
the honor of making a beginning in this direction, and this was done
by a private individual. In 1791, Mr. Walter Stirling, a merchant
in Glasgow, founded what has since been known as Stirling’s Public
Library, endowing it with ample means from his fortune, vested in
trustees and directors selected from the most respectable and influen-
tial classes in the community, who are appointed periodically as re-
quired. This library is a large building in Miller-street, the hours
are from 10 till 4, and 7 till 9 each day, except Saturday, when it
closes at 12 o’clock noon. In 1867 Stirling’s Library contained about
30.000 volumes. Connected with this also, there is a lending branch,
the life subscription being <£s ss. ; annual subscription : first year,
155., and 10s. 6d. per annum afterwards. We can remember (as a
native of Glasgow) but once only, when a boy, being taken by a friend
to Stirling’s Library. It was a spacious hall, about 80 feet square,
with a counter running from end to end, similar to the long room
at the Melbourne Custom House. Behind this counter all the
books were arranged on shelves, and the librarians handed them
over to the readers as required, who returned them- in the same man-
ner when done. Thus no reader had direct access to the books, which
were all arranged in their proper places, and confusion avoided.
Catalogues were placed on the counter for reference, while good ac-
commodation was provided in the way of chairs and tables, fronting
it throughout the entire length ; in 1867 this was stated to be the only
free library in Glasgow.
Up to 1850, no other free library except this existed in Great
Britain, but in that year the English Parliament passed an act for
their establishment. At first it applied to corporate towns of over
10.000 inhabitants, and its adoption could only be obtained by a two-
thirds majority of the burgesses who voted on the question. At that
time also, the rate was but in the pound, which could only be ap-
plied to the working expenses of the library, not to the purchase of
books, and it only referred to England. Manchester was first to
adopt this system by opening its free library, 2nd September, 1852.
Liverpool following next with its one, which was opened 18th Octo-
ber of same year. Free libraries were afterwards established in other
English towns. But it soon became evident that the miserable rate
of |d. in the pound could not sustain or maintain these institutions,
and several new acts were passed for their improvement, until 1866,
when important alterations were made in the law. The act is now
applicable to any burgh or parish, whatever the population, and the
rate levied must not exceed Id. in the pound. Up to 1872 about 40
free libraries had been established in various parts of Great Britain,
including Scotland.
As showing what personal effort may achieve, it is recorded that


previous to the Manchester Free Library being started, the Mayor of
that city raised by subscription £12,823, out of which a building was
purchased and £4156 spent on books, the number being 18,028
volumes, besides which 3292 volumes were presented as donations to
the library. In 1857, £4OOO per year was derived from the Id. rate
at Manchester for the free library, but this was from a population of
more than 300,000 persons. In 1872 Manchester possessed six free
libraries, including the original one referred to, and during that year
there were 2,264,688 readers who visited these institutions. Another
great English city, that of Birmingham, in 1872 had six free libraries,
the population being about 300,000. London, however, has been
rather backward in this matter; thus, we find that in 1855, when it
was proposed to open a free library in the city, this was negatived,
and afterwards when one was actually opened at Marylebone it was
closed in 1857 for want of support- In 1872, however, a grand free
library was opened at Guildhall, which has been in full operation
since. This collection in 1880 contained over 50,000 volumes, and
many MSS., with coins, medals, &c. The hours are from 10 till 5
each day, being closed at night.
It will be found, however, that only where there is a large popula-
tion, will the penny rate, so called, be of any service in providing for
a free library of any description, when the cost of premises, attend-
ance, stock of books, and additions are all considered, and these can-
not be obtained from the empty air. The difficulty of gaining
anything like a decent sum from the penny rate among a limited
population will be understood when we say that out of a revenue of
£50,000 the result would only be £2OB 6s. Bd. per annum, while
smaller revenues would yield an amount proportionately less. As a
steam engine will not work without fuel and water, so the expenses
of these institutions cannot be met without money. In small com-
munities therefore, other means would have to be adopted, and while
the public have the right to read in those libraries free, yet a lending
system might be established at a small yearly subscription, which
would provide funds for repairing the books and adding new ones
from time to time. This would meet the case, and any district of
sufficient importance could start a free library on its own respon-
sibility with a lending branch attached, just as Stirling’s Library has
existed at Glasgow for nearly 100 years, depending on its own funds
alone, and the sums received from lending the books.
The people of Melbourne have reason to be thankful for free
libraries, of which there are at least six in the city and suburbs, in-
cluding the magnificient Melbourne Public Library, and it would be
well for the rising generation if they patronized these institutions
more, and devoted themselves to gaining useful knowledge instead of
dissipating their time in pleasure and vanity. To our mind, free
public libraries seem like so many finishing schools, where the educa-
tion already gained in academies maybe perfected, and imperceptibly
increased from day to day, by any youth or man who wishes to keep
pace with the progress of the world. It is a pity therefore, that they
are not better encouraged and supported than we find at the present


time in this community of ours, with its wealth, intelligence, and
energy.
As a branch of the subject, we must not forget that curious phe-
nomenon of modern times, the circulating library, by means of which
for a moderate sum, the works of the best authors, past and present,
are brought within the reach of those who are positively unable to
have a library of their own. It appears that stationers lent books
on hire during the middle ages in England, but the first circulating
library, properly speaking, was established at Dunfermline, Scotland,
1711. Of this, however, we have no information beyond the simple
statement.
Allan Ramsay, who is described as first a wigmaker and then a
bookseller, opened a circulating library at Edinburgh in 1725.
Ramsay was a poet also, for he wrote “ The Gentle Shepherd,” with
other effusions, which are now all but forgotten. It is recorded that
when commencing to start business he had a terrible struggle for
existence, and was so poor that he could not pay his first half-year’s
rent. On its becoming due he saw the landlord and expressed regret
at not being able to meet his obligations. The landlord however, it
seems, was a jolly, good-hearted man, and sympathized with Ramsay,
saying that as he was a lad of some genius, he would give him the
opportunity of cancelling his debt without paying one shilling. ‘‘lf,
said the creditor, you’ll give me a rhyming answer to four questions
in as many minutes I’ll quit you the rent altogether.” Allan said he
would try. The questions were, “ What does God love 1 W hat
does the devil love 1 What does the world love ? \\ hat do I lovel ”
Ramsay wrote within the time prescribed—
“God loves man when he refrains from sin,
The devil loves man when he persists therein ;
The world loves man when riches on him flow,
And you’d love me could I pay you what I owe.”
“ The rent is paid,” said the landlord, giving his ingenious tenant
a hearty slap on the shoulder. Ramsay’s bookshop became a favorite
resort of literary characters, and his circulating library was popular
for a number of years.
The first circulating library in England was opened at Salisbury in
1740 by a minister "named Samuel Fancourt. This unfortunately
failed, but those established afterwards at Bath and in London suc-
ceeded, while the system was adopted in different parts of Great
Britain. The circulating libraries of the last century, however, were
limited in their character compared with those of the present time.
Books were so expensive then, that in numerous cases where no cir-
culating library existed, many persons, on payment of a small sub-
scription, were allowed to read at the counter of the bookseller s
shops, and would come day after day until a book was finished.
This oftentimes crowded those establishments with readers who
had no other opportunity of gratifying their taste for either amuse-
ment or instruction. The London Circulating Library, established
in 1840, continues to flourish, and has been a great convenience


to literary men and others. But the greatest circulating library in
Great Britain, if not in the world, is that of Mudie’s, established at
London in 1842. We select the following remarks regarding this
institution from an interesting article which appeared in “ Once a
Week,” 1861.
“ At the present moment the establishment owns 800,000 volumes.
If all these were to come to roost at once, it would require a library
almost as big as the British Museum to hold them. In one part lies
a hugh pile of the 2000 copies of the famous Essays and Reviews
originally issued to subscribers. Formerly it was thought a great
thing to get a supply of a dozen books at a time from a library, but
Mr. Mudie sends whole libraries to some, subscribers. He has sub-
scribers all over Great Britain, and even in France and Germany.
Macaulay had the honor of first bringing before the public the system
of Mr. Mudie. In December, 1855, when Yols. 3 and 4of his
“ History of England ” were published, it was announced that
2500 copies were at once supplied to this library. This number has
been far surpassed since. Of “ Livingstone’s Travels,” 3250 copies
were in circulation at one time, and at the lowest calculation 30,000
readers were introduced to the work through the medium of this es-
tablishment alone. One thousand copies of “ Tennyson’s ’ldylls of
the King ” were necessary to supply the demand, while of “ M‘Lin-
tock’s Voyage in Search of Franklin,” 3000 copies were at one time
reading. One lady for her guinea subscription read a number of
volumes, which, if purchased, would have cost <£2oo. Town sub-
scribers generally exchange their own books over the counter, and
the bustle of the scene may be imagined when we say, that on the
average, 1000 exchanges are effected during each day, representing
not less than 3000 volumes. Taken altogether, not less than 10,000
volumes are circulating daily throughout this establishment. Its
value to authors cannot be lightly estimated, as it enables a bountiful
supply of their works to be distributed to the remotest parts of the
kingdom, thereby increasing their reputation in an ever widening
circle. What a gulf of time seems to separate us from that age,
when the only means by which the master minds of our country
possessed of making themselves known, was that of cringing
to some noble debauchee, or eulogising a gouty earl in servile
dedication.”
We shall now conclude this Essay with a few remarks on the in-
fluence of books for good or evil. The printed book has long been
acknowledged to be one of the mightiest agents in connection with
the history of civilized man. Other authors have already written
about this, and it would be difficult to improve upon their opinions.
We cannot do better than begin with the admirable remarks ex-
pressed by that distinguished philosopher, the late Sir J. F. W.
Herschell, at the opening of the Windsor and Eton Library,
1833.
“ If I were to pray for a taste which should stand by me under
every variety of circumstances, and be a source of happiness to me
through life, and a shield against its ills, it would be a taste for


reading. Give a man this taste, and the means of gratifying it, and
you can hardly fail of making a happy man, unless, indeed, you put
into his hands a most perverse selection of books. You place him in
contact with the wisest, the wittiest, the tenderest, the bravest, and
the purest characters that have adorned humanity. You make him
a denizen of all nations, a contemporary of all ages. The world has
been created for him. It is hardly possible but the character should
take a higher and better tone from the constant habit of associating
in thought with a class of thinkers, to say the least of it, above the
average of humanity. It is morally impossible but that the manners
should take a tinge of good breeding and civilization from having
constantly before one’s eyes the way in which the best bred, and the
best informed men have talked and conducted themselves in their
intercourse with each other. There is a gentle but perfectly irresis-
tible coercion in a habit of reading well directed, over the whole
tenor of a man’s character and conduct, which is not the least effect-
ual because it works insensibly, and because it is really the last thing
he dreams of. It civilizes the conduct of men, and suffers them not
to remain barbarous.”
That is what a model man said about model reading, but how sel-
dom do we find his ideas carried into practice by the men and women
around us every day. In the great majority of cases, the novel or
romance forms the chief attraction of the multitude. This has been
very strikingly proved by the number of novels issued annually, as
well as the reports of public and circulating libraries. Thus in 1873
the total number of different works published in Great Britain was
4901, out of which 831 were novels, tales and works of fiction, being
an average of one in every six books published, represented by fully
14 branches or classes. By the report of the Melbourne Mechanics’
Institute for 1870, out of 14,000 volumes circulated during that year,
11,000 were novels or books of amusement. Sandhurst, our principal
mining centre, with a population of more than 28,000, has a fine
Mechanics’ Institute, containing over 11,000 volumes. By the last
annual report of this, ending June, 1882, we find that 34,325 volumes
were issued to subscribers, out of which novels, tales, and sketches
alone amount to 28,594 volumes. This makes an average of nearly
5 volumes out of every 6 for novels, from a library embracing 10
classes of books. At the Melbourne Athemeum also, and Mullen’s
library now, it will be found that novels are in demand far beyond
any other class of books. Anthony Trollope, when delivering a
lecture at Melbourne, 1871, stated that the whole of the other read-
ing of the public put together, did not make so much as their novel
reading. He also expressed the opinion that no weekly or monthly
periodical of the day, whether newspaper or magazine, would ever
pay without a novel or something equivalent being attached to it.
From our own experience during several years, we can say that the
presence of novels or works of fiction in religious magazines and
newspapers has largely increased their circulation, and when these
have not been present the circulation has invariably declined. This
is a fact clear to every reader. What is the principal thing which


helps to keep up the circulation of the “ Sunday at Home,” “ Leisure
Hour,” “ Boy’s Own Paper,” “ Girl’s Own Paper,” and “ The
Welcome,” not to speak of others, but the continuous tale or novel
published with each number 1 These, however, are carefully selected,
and have a good moral as well as instructive tendency, which we are
sorry to say is not the case with many other publications. But while
speaking thus, we must not be thought to condemn novel reading in
the mass. Our argument is that care should be exercised regarding
what novels to read, and what to avoid. Thus, some are pure, and
true, and good, while others are foul, false, and wicked. We should
choose our books as we would choose our friends among men and
women; by all means when doing this, take the best you can
find, and whatever is calculated to benefit as well as improve
mankind.
As types of the best authors in modern fiction, we might mention
in passing, the names of Sir Walter Scott, Capt. Marryat, Miss
Muloch, Charlotte Bronte, W. M. Thackeray, Charles Dickens,
J. P. Cooper. Jules Yerne, Anthony Trollope, Charles Kingsley,
Miss Evans, and Bulwer Lytton for adults, to which might be added
R. M. Ballantyne and W. H. G. Kingston for juveniles. There are
others, but this will be sufficient for our guidance.
Unfortunately a large number of our population crave for sensa-
tional novels or books of that class, containing tales of love, court-
ship and marriage, all admitted to be very important in this world
of ours, but which in the great majority of cases, are sadly mis-
represented and abused in these books. Reading bad books in many
cases leads to guilty actions, and we have no doubt but that the
romantic novels of the present day are responsible for the ruin of
millions physically, mentally, and socially throughout the world.
The habitual reading of sensation novels is most injurious, it can
produce no salutary effect, but will in all probability prove detri-
mental to both the mind and morals of the readers. They lead
the mind to wish for far more exciting and thrilling scenes than
are found in the ordinary course of human nature, such being the
case, the reader of these becomes dissatisfied with life as it really
is, everything is so monotonous and quiet, the affairs of one day
are so like another, without any variation or adventure ; “ if he
could only see such splendid heroes, such beautiful, faultless women,
such angels in human forms as are described in these books, there
would be some object to live for, but stepping from them into real
life he finds the world to be a very tame prosy one, and is accord-
ingly discontented with it.”
In France it has been stated that numerous novels are published
in the newspapers written by the most sensational authors who can
be found, the ra >st successful being filled with scenes of immorality,
wickedness, and dishonor French novels have long been a by-word
for all this. These publications form the chief attraction for the
millions of men and women who can read ; in them they may be said
to live, move, and have their being. “In this 1 class of literature,
marriage has been protested against, outrageous love stories told, tfi§


poor and working classes have been excited against the rich and
noble, the most startling pictures of depravity have been drawn, and
the bitterest abuse and mockery thrown upon i-eligion.” The popu-
lation of an empire is thus brought under the influence of this per-
nicious literature which has a tendency to make them discontented
with all government or authority whatsoever, and ready for any des-
perate act. Who can wonder then, that in France, we find during
the past hundred years so much of revolutions, communism, and
wickedness, the one is but the outcome of the other. Even
among English communities, sensational and immoral publica-
tions have a wonderful popularity. Thus in the case of a
notorious publication “ Reynolds’ Mysteries of the Court of Lon-
don,” issued in penny weekly numbers, each consisting of eight octavo
pages only, when the excitement for this work was at its height, one
London bookseller was known to dispose of 10,000 copies every
Saturday night and Sunday morning. There were numerous other
booksellers and agents in London and throughout the United King-
dom, who also sold large quantities of this work, besides many others
by the same author. The writings of Reynolds are mostly of an im-
moral or questionable character. Numbers of juveniles criminals,
whose deeds have at last brought them to prison or the gallows, have
traced the first cause of their ruin to “ Jack Sheppard,” or similar
works, in which housebreakers, robbers, and murderers are exhibited
as high minded and gentlemanly heroes. This has aroused a spirit
of emulation and a love of adventure which would not be satisfied
with less than deeds of violence and crime, all this leading to ruin in
the end. Children are ready imitators, and unfortunately, prefer the
bad to the good in the great majority of cases if not properly con-
trolled, great care therefore should be exercised in regard to their
reading. In several cheap periodicals published at London from
week to week, there is a continuous supply of novel literature bear-
ing a highly sensational character. “ Such publications must possess
a very powerful influence over the minds of the readers. Girls learn
from these books to think boldly about lovers and marrying, their
early modesty is effaced by the craving for admiration, their warm
affections are silenced by the desire for selfish triumph. They lose
the fresh and honest feelings of youth while they are yet scarcely
developed. It cannot but be injurious to the human mind never to
be called into effort. The habit of receiving pleasure without any
exertion of thought by the mere excitement of curiosity and
sensibility may be justly ranked among the worst effects of habitual
novel reading.”
The “London Spectator” of 1863 had an admirable paper on
penny novels, or fiction published in the penny magazines every week,
and as it conveys our meaning in the clearest language, we here give
selections from the article.
“ The plot must be exciting. Some of the principal characters
should be persons in high life, and there must always be a poor young
man or girl in the story, to step in between an unscrupulous loxd
and his schemes, and to utterly baffle and confound him at every


turn. Servants, lady’s maids especially, must be on terms of famili-
arity with their mistresses, the depositories of their most dangerous
secrets, and the chief sharers of their confidence. It is no unusual
thing to find the lady of title consulting her maid as to her future
husband. The poor man must always get the better of the rich, and
if the hero of the story is very poor, and falls in love with a rich
peeress, and marries her in defiance of natural obstacles, the tale is
sure of a good run. No doubt these representations of high life are
to the last degree absurd and ridiculous, but suppose the readers are
satisfied with the false, and would not be satisfied with the true ?
If a man prefers a brass chain, it would be difficult to insist upon
his wearing a gold one. In the love scenes there is great room for
the imaginative powers. The dialogues must end with the lady in an
ecstasy of tears, and the gentleman in a paroxysm of emotion, calling
Heaven and earth to witness that he will be true to death. If they
part it must be with speeches so moving as to bring to the tender
reader the luxury of crying. If the lady can conveniently be left re-
clining in the arms of her maid in a fit, and the gentleman wiping
the heavy drops of agony from his manly and destracted brow, so
much the better will be the effect. The ancient form of proposing on
one’s knees is still strictly adhered to, and the lover never forgets to
bedew the lady’s hand with briny tears, and afterwards to cover it
with burning kisses. Tears are always briny and kisses always burn-
ing in these fictions, the one pleasantly counteracting the other. The
art of concluding each number with a special sensation, is perhaps
the most difficult but the most necessary feature in writing popular
fictions. There have been many burlesques of these stories, but none
are half so amusing as the originals. In the following, taken from
“The Poor Girl,” the wife is speaking to her husband :
“ My lord, you have your secrets.”
He was almost suffocated in the attempt to ejaculate. He tried to
appear calm and cold, and waved his hand as though he considered
her trifling with him.
“ Well! ” he exclaimed.
“And you have one in this house,” she continued, with a very
peculiar and pointed emphasis.
He gazed at her searchingly, wonderingly, mechanically, and
ejaculated.
“ Well madam ! ”
“We stand then my lord for the present on the same ground,”
she rejoined, in a voice which thrilled him. “ I have my secrets. I
too have one in this house.”
As she uttered those words with a shrillness which seemed to
pierce his brain as though each word was a heated barb, she glided
from the room, leaving him transfixed with bewildering, torturing
amazement.
The physical effect upon the nerves of a sudden shock is usually
very astounding. Thus, above we have the Marquis almost suffo-
cated, and with a feeling as of a heated barb in his brain, which,
though hard to imagine, must doubtless be a very terrible sensation.


Immediately before, however, we are told that his blood almost froze
in his veins, so that the heated barb might have worked nothing
more than an agreeable change of temperature. Afterwards, we be-
hold him tossing on the ground with all the wildness and frenzy of a
maniac. Then again we find him thus.
At length maddened by the thoughts which whirled successively
through his brain, scorching and blistering it with the images they
conveyed, he turned and advanced upon her with glaring eyes and
foaming at the mouth like a tiger.
“ Woman,” he said, as the white froth bubbled on his lips,
“ when I first saw you I believed that your—that your—past
history ”
She turned upon him like lightning, and with her finger pointed
menacingly at him, she exclaimed in a clear, firm, determined
voice—”
To be continued in our next.
Here is a good ending to a number : “ But they had not done with
him yet. There was a flash, a loud report, a cry of pain, and then
again all was silent as the grave.”
To be continued.
Thus the reader is left for a whole week to conjecture which of the
characters is disposed of. Take another example.
Human nature could bear these taunting words no longer.
“ Perish then ! ” cried George Roberts, as he drew a pistol from
his belt and fired at the hag. “ Perish witch, and ill-omened witch
that you are, never more shall your screech-owl voice vex mor-
tal ear! ”
With a scream that mingled with the report of the pistol, she
fell backward from the rock.
To be continued.
The chief thing to satisfy the readers of novels in these cheap pub-
lications is the unnatural craving of the half-educated or ignorant
for exaggerated representations of “high life” and their almost
barbaric taste for tragical incidents. They like to be taken amid
scenes which are wholly different from those which they encounter
in their own daily experience.”
That was a critic’s opinion of novels published in the penny
periodicals, such as “Reynold’s Miscellany,” and “London dournal ”
of 1863, and the same with equal justice may be said of the novels
published in “Bow Bells,” “ London Journal,” and “Family Reader”
of 1883. Without sensation they could not live. “ ’Tis true, ’tis
true ; ’tis pity, and pity ’tis, ’tis true.” Thus much about novels.
Hear what Thomas Carlyle says about reading. “I do not know
whether it has been sufficiently brought home to you that there are
two kinds of books. When a man is reading on any kind of subject
in most departments of books, in all books if you take it in a wide
sense, you will find that there is a division of good books and bad
books, there is a good kind of a book, and a bad kind of a book. I
am not to assume that you are all very ill acquainted with this, but
I may remind you that it is a very important consideration. It


casts aside altogether the idea that people have, that if they are
reading any book, that if an ignorant man is reading any book, he is
doing rather better than nothing at all. I entirely call that in
question ; I even venture to deny it. It would be much safer and
better would he have no concern with books at all than with some
of them. There are a number—an increasing number of books that
are decidedly to him not useful. In short, as I have written it down
somewhere, I conceive that books are like men’s souls divided into
sheep and goats. Some of them are calculated to be of very great
advantage in teaching—in forwarding the teaching of all generations.
Others are going down, down, doing more and more, wilder and
wilder mischief.”
There is a strange confusion in some minds respecting the well
known words knowledge and wisdom, which are popularly supposed
to be identical when the reverse of this is the case. By many it is
believed that if any man has read a number of books on different
subjects he must therefore be noted for wisdom. But this is often-
times a delusion, for mere desultory reading without aim, end, or
special study, has but the effect of distracting and enfeebling the
mind, which cannot retain information so received. To gain know-
ledge we must read, to acquire wisdom we must not only read, but
reflect and apply the information received, intelligently. Cowper
well expresses this—
“ Knowledge and wisdom far from being one,
Have oft-times no connection. Knowledge dwells
In heads replete with thoughts of other men,
Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.
Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,
The mere materials with which wisdom builds,
Till smoothed and squared and fitted in its place,
Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich.
Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much,
Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.”
Lord Bacon, the famous essayist, and author of “ Novum Organum,”
gives the following valuable advice, which is worth re-producing.
“ Bead not to contradict and confute ; nor to believe and take for
granted ; but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted,
others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested )
that is, some books are to be read only in parts ; others to be read
but not curiously \ and some few to be read wholly and with diligence
and attention.”
How fortunate it is for us in these modern days that the facilities
for reading are much greater than they were in the past, the price of
literature in many cases being but a fraction of what it formerly was,
free education being now an accomplished fact, while our inhabitants
are instructed and entertained for nothing at the various free libraries
scattered over the lank In books we have the productions of the
greatest thinkers in the world. Poetry has supplied us with pictures
of pleasure and beauty, cheering the heart, and lifting it above the
cares of life. Oratory brings before the mind those* princes of


imagination and thought, who could carry multitudes captive at will
by their force of intellect and grandeur of description. To philoso-
phy we are indebted for systems which have laid the foundations of
our modern knowledge. History supplies us with the rise, progress
and decline of nations from the creation up to the present time, giv-
ing details of remarkable events which have occurred in each country
before we entered the world. Biography exhibits to us the lives of
great and good men who lived during different periods, describing by
what means they attained success in their various enterprises.
Biography has been represented as history teaching by example, and
this is true, for certainly history depends chiefly on the actions or
opinions of the individual men who compose a nation. Science re-
veals the marvels which have been discovered by its agency, explain-
ing the composition of the world as well as the structure of the
universe. Fiction rightly used, and of a proper class, serves to re-
create the mind when overwrought, imparting not only pleasure but
instruction also. Religion tells about our origin as immortal crea-
tures, our duty to God and our fellow man, and the eternal future to
which we are approaching nearer every day. From whatever point
we view it, the influence of books is great and universal. It is but
fitting that before bidding our readers farewell, we should conclude
this essay with a quotation which should be inscribed on the doors or
walls of every library.
“ In a corner of my house I have books, the miracle of my pos-
sessions, more wonderful than the wishing-cap of the Arabian tales,
for they transport me instantly not only to all places, but to all
times. By my books I can conjure up before me into vivid existence
all the great and good men of antiquity; and fur my own individual
satisfaction I can make them act over again the most renowned of
their exploits ; the orators declaim for me, the historians recite,
the poets sing; in a word, from the equator to the pole, and
from the beginning of time until now, by my books I can be
where 1 please.”
