The Island of Van Diemen’s Land is a British Colony, situate between 40° 20 m and 43° 40 m south latitude, and
144° 30 m and 148° 30 m east longitude ; its extent from north to south is about 200 miles, and from east to west
about 160 miles, containing an area about equal to that of Ireland, namely 15,000,000 superficial square acres.
The general character of Van Diemen’s Land is hilly and mountainous, with many large tracts of open country, and
with others heavily timbered; the soil is in general good and productive, and the climate salubrious, not beiim
subject to the extremes of heat and cold; the spring commences in September, the summer in December, the
autumn in March, and the winter in June.
The productions are sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, and poultry. Wool, corn, and bark are the chief articles of
export; a considerable source of profit is also derived from the whale fisheries on the coasts and neinhbourino-
o C?
islands. The colony is under a Lieutenant-Governor and Legislative Council; the taxes are triflin «■, and there are
no tithes. The principal rivers are the Derwent in the south, on which the capital, Hobart Town, is situate, and
the Tamar in the north, on which Launceston, the second town in population and importance, is built; besides these
there are other rivers and streams which intersect the island in every direction.
