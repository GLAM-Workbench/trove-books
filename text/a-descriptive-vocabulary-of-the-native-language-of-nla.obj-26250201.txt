A DESCRIPTIVE VOCABULARY
OF THE
NATIVE LANGUAGE
OF W. AUSTRALIA
THE VERY REV. J. BRADY V. G.
ROME
PRINTED AT THE PRESS OF THE S. 0.
DE PROPAGANDA FIDE.




RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED
HIS EMINENCE
CARDINAL FRANSONI
PREFECT OF THE S. C. DE PROPAGANDA FIDE
HIS MOST DEVOTED AND OBEDIENT SERVANT
J. BRADY
V. G. W. Australia.




PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.
The words contained in this Vocabu-
lary are those in most common use in
the vicinity of Perth and the adjacent di-
stricts. The peculiarity of the dialect of
King George’s sound , is to shorten the
words by cutting off the final syllable,
especially when it ends with a vowel, as
katiox:katta, the head ortopofamy thing;
kal for kalla, fire, which gives the words
a short abrupt sound. Nothing is said
here about the grammar of the language,
because it is not sufficiently known. A
sentence of the West - Australian dia-
lect would run much in this way : « I to
» day-at sun rise in forest walking male
kangaroo far-off saw. I creep near
near , male kangaroo eats head down
low : I spear, heart strike male kan-
» garoo dead, dead falls , good yes, I
» good throw, yes very. » The gram-
matical construction appears to be inar-


tificial and elementary as might naturally
be expected.
I°. The letters used in this Vocabu-
lary are :
A. b. c. d. e.g. h. i. j. k. 1. m. n.
o. p. q. r. t. u. v. w. y. The sound of
ng is by many ears very difficult to catch;
hut it may be easily attained by bearing
in mind the termination of the English
participles ending in ing.
2°. I have not found any difference
between the nominative and the other
cases , except that the vocative is distin-
guished some times by the affix kau,
as youngar kau, oh People , or oh ye
People.
3°. In the degrees of adjectives the
comparative is formed by a repetition of
the word , and the superlative is formed
by the addition of the intensitive jil, as
gw abba (good) gw abb a gw abb a (better)
and gwabbajil (best).
4°. The greatest care is required in
the use of the personal pronouns.


SC.5 C . Possessive pronouns are formed
from the personal pronouns by the affix
uk, as bal, he, she ,or it; baluk , his,
hers , or its.
G°. In forming the principal tenses of
the verbs but few difficulties present
themselves. The present tense rarely dif-
fers from the infinitive mode. The pre-
terite is generally formed by the addi-
tion of ga to the present, whilst the par-
ticiple present is formed by adding een.
Example: Yu-gow to stand , yu-goga,
yu gow-een.
No change takes place in the singular
or plural number of the tenses. The cha-
racteristic pronoun forms the number
with regard to the arrangement of words;
in a sentence the substantive precedes
the adjective ; the nominative and accu-
sative both precede the verb, the nomi-
native coming first.
The usual form of negation in a sen-
tence is by affixing the particle hurt or
broo , both of which signify « not »


as nganya Katfidje hurt (I understand
not.)
A question is always put by termina-
ting the sentence with the interrogative
interjection Kana ; as nginee watto-mur-
rigo Kana ?
It Mill be found that I have given only
a few of the compound words : to have
done otherwise would have swelled the
size of this volume inconveniently. The
word most commonly used in compounds
is rnidde (an agent).
One remarkable point, to which I
should wish to call the attention of per-
sons studying the language, is that when-
ever verbs express a similarity of action,
this fact would appear to be denoted by
a common termination being given to
the infinitive of such verbs , thus a va-
riety of verbs express the action of car-
rying. For instance : Barrang, to carry
off or bring; Wundang , to wear, or
to carry on the back ; Golang , to carry
in a bag. Similarly the verbs : Taan, to


pierce or make an opening; Bok-kan, to
bite or tear with the teeth ; Tak-kan, to
break or rend.
In an unwritten tongue and amongst
an ignorant and scattered population it
will not be thought extraordinary that in
a wide range of country I sometimes
found many variations in the expression
of the same word, which could not per-
haps be fairly considered as amounting
to a difference of dialect. Examples of
this will be seen abundantly in the Vo-
cabulary,
Table shewing how the possessive pro-
nouns are formed from the personals.

process is performed by drawing away
the Boyl-ya, who is in the patient,
from the diseased part to some of the

feels his purpose by squeezing the af-
flicted part with his hands, gradual-
ly drawing them towards the extre-
mities ; he is however very careful
after each squeeze to shake his hands
and blow well upon them., to save
himself from being afflicted by the
Boyl-ya. If any person has a great
reputation for performing the ope-
ration, the natives will in the event

sembles the process of animal magne-
tism.
