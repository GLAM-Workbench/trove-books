Fatal
Deadlock


The Deadlock
• The population chart of Australia reveals an
extraordinary state of affairs. Practically all our
citizens are crowded in one comer.
WHY ?
BECAUSE
1. Most say :
f Wait, and let the Other Fellow worry !
2. The Rest say ;
‘ Wait till the Government provides railways,
schools, hospitals, telephones, comforts; thus mak-
ing civilised life possible/'
3. The Government says :
f Wait till settlement justifies such expenditure.
Thus, for once, we have a unanimous chorus
“ Wait, Wait, Wait 1 ” V
❖ * *
But it is a Chorus of Death.
There is a fate awaiting those who wait, a reward
that is sure. It will be shared with those whose luck
was always out—-they found the days too hot in Sum-
mer, and in Winter the light-time was too short !


The Remedy
Create a new element in our national " Morale.” Inspire the old
hunger to do what has not been done before ; the grand ambition to make
new roads instead of merely using the old ways provided by our fathers’ toil.
This is the real task. But, when some are found ready to “ make
new roads,” it is obvious they should be kept assured that they are the valued
Shock Troops of our. Peace Army.
HOW ?
First : The work of our pioneers must be idealised by ample publicity
in the centres of population. Thus will be born among many a desire to go
and do likewise. Among those who cannot go there will emerge a conscious-
ness of what they owe to frontier toilers, associated with a longing to give
some definite expression of their new appreciation.
SeeOßd l Organisation is needed, reaching from those who remember
to the furthest objects of their sentiment. By our deeds of gratitude the
soldier, in every line of life, is couraged-up. Apart from material, there is a
spiritual value in true gifts ; such will make the recipients feel that, even
in the loneliest and remotest places to which they may penetrate, the eyes
of our nation are on them still. Then their best will be a better best !
To provide among its own members publicity and organisation needed
to make possible our share in above, the Presbyterian Church has created
the Australian Inland Mission. Many outside “ The Kirk ” have sought to
express through this new agency their gratitude to our Nation-Builders,
and such colleagues are very welcome, for their presence enhances the national
character of our effort.
What is the work ? Study the maps (over) comparing our field with
the population chart, rain chart, railway map, and what is left of the continent!
Then write for details to :
The General Secretary,
Australian Inland Mission,
Box 100 G.P.0., Sydney.
It will be noted that our organisation, which seeks to serve the loneliest
areas of Australia, has its headquarters in our densest city—to which all
roads lead.

Government is strong— -and there is also good old Private Enterprise.

pioneers which would result from the establishment of seven aerodromes, with flying doctors at each, and wireless telephones
everywhere so that bush folk could call in the hour of need 1

One query in passing; If the pioneers mist wait in their isolation for railways and telephone wires, why not meantime give them aeroplanes
and wireless telephones ?
