SUNDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1930
Third Jubilee of Robert aikes
PIONEER OF SUNDAY SCHOOLS :: 1780-1930
“This is the spot on which I stood when I saw the destitution of the children
and the desecration of the Sabbath by the inhabitants of this city. As I asked, ‘Can
nothing be done ?’ a voice answered, ‘Try!’ I did try. And see what God hath
wrought! I can never pass this spot where the word ‘Try’ came so powerfully into
my mind without lifting up my hands and heart to Heaven in gratitude to God for
having put such a thought into my heart.”
Robert Raikes to Joseph Lancaster, 1807.

3. HYMN —“Far Round the World Thy Children Sing.” (Tune Trisagion;
Eventide)
1. Far round the world Thy children sing their song
From east and west their voices sweetly blend;
Praising the Lord, in Whom young lives are strong,
Jesus, our Guide, our Hero, and our Friend.
2. Guide of the pilgrim clambering to the height.
Hero on Whom our fearful hearts depend.
Friend of the wanderer yearning for the light,
Jesus, our Guide, our Hero, and our Friend.
3. Where Thy wide ocean, wave on rolling wave,
Beats through the ages on each island shore.
They praise their Lord, Whose hand alone can save.
Whose sea of love surrounds them evermore.
4. Thy sun-kissed children on earth’s spreading plain.
Where Asia’s rivers water all the land.
Sing, as they watch Thy fields of glowing grain.
Praise to the Lord Who feeds them with His hand.
5. Still there are lands where none have seen Thy face.
Children whose hearts have never shared Thy joy.
Yet Thou wouldst pour on these Thy radiant grace ;
Give Thy glad strength to every girl and boy.
6. Smile on our work, our laughter, and our play ;
Lift us at eve to slumber on Thy breast;
Shine on the praise and worship of Thy day ;
Breathe on our sleep the sweetest of Thy rest.

Suffer me to leave Thee never.
Seal Thine image on my heart.
Amen.

1. Tell me the stories of Jesus
I love to hear ;
Things I would ask Him to tell me
If He were here;
■Scenes by the wayside,
Tales of the sea.
Stories of Jesus,
Tell them to me.
4. Tell me, in accents of wonder.
How rolled the sea.
Tossing the boat in a tempest
On Galilee !
And how the Master,
Ready and kind.
Chided the billows
And hushed the wind.
2. First let me hear how the children
Stood round His knee;
And I shall fancy His blessing
Resting on me ;
Words full of kindness.
Deeds full of grace.
All in the lovelight
Of Jesu’s face.
5. Tell how the sparrow that twitters
On yonder tree.
And the sweet meadow-side lily
May speak to me—
Give me their message.
For I would hear
How Jesus taught us
Our Father’s care.
3. Into the city I’d follow
The children’s band.
Waving a branch of the palm-tree
High in my hand;
One of His heralds.
Yes, I would sing
Loudest Hosannas !
6. Show me that scene in the garden,
Of bitter pain ;
And of the cross where my Saviour
For me was slain—
Sad ones or bright ones.
So that they be
Stories of Jesus,
Tell them to me.
Jesus is King!
Amen.

Sweet flowers and fruits Thy love declare,

5. HYMN —“God is with us.” (Tune,
1. “God is with us, God is with us,”
So our brave forefathers sang,
Far across the field of battle.
Loud their holy war-cry rang;
Never once they feared nor faltered.
Never once they ceased to sing—
“ God is with us, God is with us,
Christ our Lord shall reign as King !”
2. Great the heritage they left us.
Great the conquests to be won.
Armed hosts to meet and scatter.
Larger duties to be done.
Raise the song they nobly taught us.
Round the wide world let it ring.
“God is with us, God is with us,
Christ our Lord shall reign as King'.”
6. PRAYER.
7. Hymn—“o Jesus, I Have Promised.”
1. O Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end ;
Be Thou for ever near me.
My Master and my Friend ;
I shall not fear the battle
If Thou art by my side.
Nor wander from the pathway
If Thou wilt be my Guide.
2. O let me feel Thee near me.
The world is ever near ;
I see the sights that dazzle.
The tempting sounds I hear
My foes are ever near me.
Around me and within ;
But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer.
And shield my soul from sin.
8. NOTICES, OFFERINGS, ANTHEM,
Earth and Sea.” (Tune, Alms-giving).
4 Thou didst not spare Thine only Son,
But gav’st Him for a world undone.
And freely with that blessed One,
Thou givest all.
5, Thou giv’st the Spirit’s blessed dower.
Spirit of life and love and power,
And dost His sevenfold graces shower
Upon us all.
6. For souls redeemed, for sins forgiven.
For means of grace and hopes of heaven.
Father, all praise to Thee be given.
Who givest all.
Amen
Hyfrydol; Austria).
3. Speed the Cross through all the nations.
Speed the victories of love,
Preach the gospel of redemption.
Wheresoever men may move ;
Make the future in the present.
Strong of heart, toil on and sing,
“God is with us, God is with us,
Christ our Lord shall reign as King.”
4. Soon the struggle will be over,
Soon the flags of strife be furled.
Downward from his place defeated,
Shall the enemy be hurled ;
Onward, then, with ranks unbroken,
Sure of triumph, shout and sing,
“God is with us, God is with us,
Christ our Lord shall reign as King.”
Amen
(Tune, Wolvercote; Day of Rest).
3. O let me hear Thee speaking
In accents clear and still.
Above the storms of passion.
The murmurs of self-will;
O speak to reassure me.
To hasten or control ;
O speak, and make me listen.
Thou Guardian of my soul.
4. O Jesus, Thou hast promised.
To all who follow Thee,
That where Thou art in glory.
There shall Thy servant be;
And Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
O give me grace to follow,
My Master and my Friend.

10. HYMN—“Lord in the Fulness of my Might.” (Tune, Unversity; C.M.).
1. Lord, in the fulness of my might, 3. I would not with swift-winged soul
I would for Thee be strong ; On the world’s errands go.
While runneth o’er each dear delight. And labour up the heavenly hill
To Thee should soar my song. With weary feet and slow.
2. I would not give the world my heart, 4. O not for Thee my weak desires.
And then profess Thy love ; My poorer, baser part!
I would not feel my strength depart, O not for Thee my fading fires.
And then Thy service prove. The ashes of my heart!
5. O choose me in my golden time.
In my dear joys have part;
For Thee the glory of my prime.
The fulness of my heart!
Amen
