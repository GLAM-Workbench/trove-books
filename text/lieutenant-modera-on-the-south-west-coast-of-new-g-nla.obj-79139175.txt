Narrative of a Voyage along the S.W. Coast of New Gumea,
in 1828, and communicated by G. Windsor Earl, Esq.,
M.R.A.S.
In the dearth of information respecting the vast island of New
Guinea, extending from the Equator to 10� S. lat., and reaching
in a N W. and S.E. direction not less than 1200 geographical
miles, or double the length of the British Islands, we are glad to
avail ourselves of the account of a voyage undertaken by order of
the Netherlands Government, to establish a settlement on some
convenient spot on the W. coast of the island, and during which
voyage the greater portion of the S.W. coast was surveyed, the
general trending only of which had been previously ascertained.
A brief sketch of the progress of discovery on these shores may
furnish a suitable introduction to this voyage. The Portuguese
claim the discovery of New Guinea for Abreu and Senano,
who were despatched from Malacca to the Spice Islands, by
Albuquerque, in 1511. Abreu, however, proceeded no farther
than Amboyna, and Serrano was wrecked on one of the neigh-
bouring islands ; so that it is not likely that either of them could
have discovered New Guinea, although they might have heard ot
its existence from the natives of Amboyna. The discovery may,
with more justice, be attributed to Alvaro de Saavedra, who was
sent from the Moluccas on a voyage of discovery to the eastward
in 1527. Many of the bays and headlands on the north coast
were named by the Portuguese, and these were retained in a
Dutch chart published at Amsterdam as late as 1753. In 1037,
the north coast was visited by Grijalva and Alvarado, two Spa-
niards, who had been sent on discovery from Mexico by Cortez;
and again, in 1567, by Mendaha, who, in 1595, attempted to
colonize the island of Santa Cruz, 18� to the eastward oi New
Guinea, but the settlement was broken up at Ins death.
The above-mentioned voyages were confined to the north coast.
In 1606, ten years after their arrival in the Indian Archipelago,
the Dutch despatched a vessel, called the Duyfhen, from Ban-
tam to New Guinea. She passed along the south-west coast, and
stretched across to Australia, which was considered to be merely
a continuation of the coast of New Guinea. In the same year,
Torres, after having separated from Quiros, near Vera Cruz,
passed between New Guinea and Australia; thus discovering the
strait which bears his name. In 1616, the north coast was traccc
bySchouten and LeMaire, and several Dutch navigators followed


t )G Du y fhen ; Carstens in 1623, Gerard Pool in
and Tasman (second voyage) in 1644. Carstens and Pool
\vere both lulled by the natives of New Guinea, and as two
rivers on the north-west coast are named in the old charts Dood-
slayer s, or ? Murderers?? Rivers, they probably met their death
m the vicinity. The positions assigned to these rivers agree pretty
well with the Utanata and False Utanata rivers visited by the
1 nton. All these last-named navigators fell into the same error
as the people of the Duyfhen in supposing that New Guinea
uas united to Australia ; and these countries were thus repre-
sented in all charts published previous to the year 1762, when an
original letter of Torres, describing his proceedings after parting
with jQuiros, was found by the British at the taking of Ma-
It does not appear that any voyager of note comes between
iasman and Dampier, although the west coast was probably
sometimes visited by the Dutch. In 1700, Dampier, in the
Roebuck, touched at Sabuda Island, near the west coast of New
vjuinea; and, passing through the strait between Wayiiu and
Battanta, sailed round New Britain, and discovered the strait
which divides it from New Guinea. He then passed to the
westward, along the north coast of the latter island. Roggeveen
Carteret, and Bougainville, subsequently pursued nearly the same
track along the north coast. Cook touched on the south-west
coast m 1770, but he remained a very short time, and had no
Inendly communication with the natives.
In 1774, Captain Forest, E.1.C.5., performed a voyage from
Balambangan to New Guinea, visiting Dori Harbour at the
north-west end; and, from Ins being able to converse with the
natives through Ins knowledge of the Malay language, his narra-
live, although little more than a single chapter is devoted to the
mainland of New Guinea, contains more correct information, par-
ticularly concerning the manners and customs of the natives, than
any work pubhshed previous to the voyage of the Triton.f l n
1/91, Lieutenant M'Cluer, of the Indian navy, surveyed the
north-west and part of the western coasts, and discovered the deep
inlet which nearly divides the north-west end of the island. His
charts only have been published. Several French navigators
among whom are D?Entrecasteaux, Duperrey,and D?Urville have
also visited the eastern and northern coasts.
It now remains to mention the parts of New Guinea which
have been well surveyed, and those which are yet to be examined.

The north-west and western coasts, from the Cape of Good
Hope to the south point of M/Cluer?s Inlet, have been surveyed
by Lieutenant M'Cluer. From this point, southward, to the Fort
Du Bus, in lat. 3� 41' S., an extent of about 170 miles, the shore
is much broken, and has only been indistinctly seen. The south-
ern coast, from Fort Du Bus to Dourga Strait, has been surveyed
by the Triton; and, in 1835, Lieutenant Kool, of the Dutch
navy, passed through the above-named strait, and thus determined
what had only been suspected by the people of the Triton, that
the land about Cape Valsche (False Cape) is an island. Be-
tween the south entrance of the strait, or what has hitherto been
termed the Bartholomew River, and the eastern boundary of the
territory taken possession of by the Dutch (in long. 141� E.), an
extent of 140 miles, the land has not even been seen. Of the
remainder of the south coast little is known ; and it cannot be
determined whether the detached pieces of land seen by the
Hormuzeer and other ships, when passing Torres Straits, are
actually portions of the mainland, or merely islands lying near it,
a point of immense importance, when the great danger attend-
ing the navigation of Torres Straits is taken into consideration.
We are indebted to French navigators ?to D?Entrecasteaux,
and especially to Duperrey, in 1825, and Dumont D'Urville, in
1827, for the chief part of the knowledge we possess of the north-
east coast. The positions of many headlands have been determined ;
but 400 miles of the north-eastern coast-line, between Port
Geelvink on the north, and Cape Rodney to the south-east,
remain to be thoroughly examined. Geelvink?s, or the Great Bay,
has been surveyed by the Dutch, and a chart of their discoveries,
from which we have our knowledge of the bay, was published by
Dalrymple.
April 21, 1828, the corvette Triton, and the Colonial schooner
Iris, left the Bay of Amboyna, and shaped their course for Banda,
where they were to obtain interpreters, and on the 29th, their wants
being supplied, they continued their voyage. The following day,
being driven to the south-west of Banda, they saw Bird Island;*
the position of which they found to differ considerably from that
assigned to it in the charts of Norie and Arrowsmith, which
they had on board, together with one constructed by M. Kolff, in
J825. On the 4th of May, they passed through the group of
islands which stretch from the Keys to Ceram, and which, until
then, formed the eastern boundary of the Dutch Oriental posses-
sions. The people of these islands carry on a trade with the south-
west coast of New Guinea. May 7, they entered the channel be-

tween the Key and Arru islands; and, on the 20th, made the
coast of New Guinea, in lat. 7� Js? S. The following day the
vessels entered the Dourga Strait,* the north-west entrance of
which had been discovered by M. KolfF in 1825, and anchored
off the mouth of a creek on the north shore. As the stock of
fresh water began to run short, a boat was despatched to the
creek; but as it was high water when they entered it, the water
was brackish. The banks were low and morassy, the water
standing upon it to the depth of two or three feet. The whole of
the coast, indeed, that they had hitherto seen, was but little
raised above the level of high-water mark ; the trees with
which the land was overgrown presented a level appearance,
and not a single hill or piece of elevated land was visible.
The following day several natives were seen near the mouth of
the creek, and a boat was sent to them from the corvette; and
after having friendly communication for some time a quarrel
occurred, in which three of the natives were killed, and some of
the boat?s crew wounded. These people were of the middle
size, and not very stout. Their skins were black, with a bluish
gloss, and some were afflicted with ulcers, and a disease which
gave a scaly appearance to their skin. They had thick lips, flat
noses, black frizzled hair like that of negroes, beards and whis-
kers, Some had marks drawn with red pigment across the face
and round the mouth. The lobes of their ears were pierced, and
in them they wore rings of rattan. The men were entirely naked,
with the exception of a broad band of rushes round their waists,
the ends hanging down behind. Their weapons were bows,
arrows, and spears, made of different kinds of cane, with points
of wood hardened by fire. The two women whom they saw
wore small triangular pieces of bark hanging down before them.
They did not approach sufficiently near to be well observed, but
their appearance was by no means prepossessing.
The vessels now proceeded about twenty-five miles further up
the strait, the shores still being extremely low, and no high land
could be seen even from the mast-head. Parties landed in vari-
ous spots, where they met with no inhabitants. On digging pits
they found the upper stratum of black vegetable earth to be only
one foot thick : under this was a layer of grey clay from three to
five feet in thickness, which rested on brown coral sand. Pieces
of quartz, ironstone, and pumice-stone were found scattered
about on the beach. No place adapted for the settlement having
been met with, the vessels left the strait, and proceeded alon*
shore to the N.W.
May 28. They saw a village in latitude 6� 17' S., the same

that was seen by Cook during his first voyage. On the 29th a
shoal was met with,, in latitude 6� S., and on the following day the
Providential Bank was seen.
June 2. After having traced the coast for 230 miles to the
north-west of Dourga Strait, the vessels anchored off the mouth
of False Utanata river, in latitude 4� 48' S. A bar of sand, on
which there was a heavy surf, ran across the mouth of the river.
N umbers of natives were seen on the beach, waving white flags,
and several canoes were launched by them; but although the
vessels remained on and off several days, they did not communi-
cate with the natives, owing to a want of confidence on both sides.
Men were occasionally seen on the beach, waiving short pieces of
wood in the air, from which issued something resembling smoke,
instruments which puzzled Cook?s people so much, and made
them suppose that the natives possessed fire-arms.* These they
afterwards found to be short pieces of bamboo, which contained a
mixture of lime, sand, and ashes, and which was ejected by
swinging the instruments in the air. They were apparently used
for the purpose of making signals to their friends at a distance.
June 8. They pursued their voyage to the north-west, and on
the following day a number of people belonging to a river some
distance to the westward came off to the vessels in canoes. They
readily bartered their weapons and ornaments for pieces of cloth,
old clothes, knife blades, beads, and empty bottles; but the two
former articles were most in demand. The chiefs were dressed
somewhat in the Malay fashion, which proved that they had had
communication with the Ceramese. On the 11th the vessels
arrived at the river to which these people belonged. It was
called the Utanata river, and bore much resemblance to the
False Utanata. They remained here until the 22nd in uninter-
rupted harmony with the natives, who assisted them in cutting
wood and filling up water. The natives here differed little from the
people of Dourga Strait, except in being of superior make and
stature (the majority were above the middle size), and somewhat
further advanced in civilization. Each of the natives appeared to
wish to ornament himself in a manner different from his neigh-
bour. They wore rings of rattan and strings of hogs?-teeth on
their necks, arms, and legs, and many had the cartilages of their
noses bored, wearing pieces of stick or bone in the aperture.
Their teeth were generally sharpened to points. The men had
wales across their breasts and bellies, and on their arms. These
had been made by cutting the flesh with stones, and afterwards
burning it, so that when the wounds healed, wales were raised to

weapons, as they were supposed to be.

the thickness of the finger.* The greater portion of them resided
in one long house, 100 feet in length, 5 feet high, and G broad,
situated on the shore, within the mouth of the river. It contained
nineteen doors, one for each family. The frame was constructed
of bamboo, and the walls and roof were covered with thatch.
Their canoes were from thirty to sixty feet long, and the men
stood up to row. Their weapons consisted of bows, arrows,
spears, and clubs, which last, together with their paddles, were
handsomely carved. Their domestic animals consisted of hogs
and dogs, but their food was chiefly sago, fish, and turtles? eggs.
They possessed also plantains, cocoa-nuts, papayas, nutmegs,
breadfruit, and large lemons, which they readily gave in exchange
for cloth. To judge from the report of one of the chiefs, who
named no less than thirty-five villages in his neighbourhood, the
population must be considerable. The natives, on hearing that
the Dutch were about to settle on the coast, were anxious that
they should fix themselves here: but as the river, although clear
and capacious inside the heads, had a bar across the entrance,
which rendered it difficult of access to ships of burden, their
offer was declined. The coast hitherto had been extremely low;
but here a range of high mountains, generally enveloped in clouds,
and on which some thought they could distinguish snow, ap-
peared far in the interior, running nearly east and west, one end
of the range terminating in Cape Bouro, a bluff promontory about
eighty miles to the W.N.W. of the Utanata river.
June 22. The vessels left the river, and pursued their voyage.
On the 27th they saw a number of high islands, close to the
coast, and entered a strait between one of them and the main-
land, where they were boarded by the chief of the island Aiduma,
who conducted them to a small cove on the north part of it, on
the shores of which his village was situated. At the head of the
cove a beautiful and fertile valley, bounded on each side by steep
hills, stretched towards the interior. In it was a Malay house,
which several years previously had been occupied by a Ceramese
priest, who had converted the natives to Mohammedanism. The
Dutch had some thought of making their settlement here, but
they found that the fort would be overlooked from the hills on
each side of the valley, and would therefore be insecure. Several
beautiful valleys, both on the mainland and on the adjacent
islands, were examined and disapproved of for the same reason.
At length, an extensive piece of marshy ground, at the bottom of
a large land-locked bay on the mainland, was fixed on for the site
of the fort, and a party from each vessel, together with the in-
tended garrison, commenced clearing away the thick forest, and
* In this and in many other of their customs, and also in their general appear-
ance, they bear a striking resemblance to the natives of Australia.


erecting the buildings, the natives bringing them abundance of
bamboos and thatch. Two officers were sent to survey the
neighbouring coasts, and towards the end of August the fort,
which was merely a square enclosure of stakes, surrounding a few
huts, was completed ; but by this time the greater portion of the
crew were laid up with the jungle fever, which was caused by the
extreme insalubrity of the position. The marshy ground on which
the fort was built, and which, owing to the denseness of the forest,
(previous to its being cleared,) had never been reached by
the sun, engendered miasma, not readily dissipated by the wind,
as the bay, from being perfectly land-locked, was sheltered from
the sea breeze.
Immediately behind the fort rose a wooded mountain to a
height of 2462 English feet. The soil in the vicinity was very
rich, and many of the vegetable productions were of a valuable
description. Among these were the Massoy trees, the bark of
which is much valued by the people of the Archipelago, and is
often used medicinally. Iron wood and ebony were found in
great abundance, some of the trees being five feet in diameter:
sago and cocoa-nut trees, with other palms were also numerous;
together with plantains, lemons, papayas, nutmegs, jamboes,
pumpkins, and yams. Several species of the kangaroo were met
with, together with birds of paradise, crown pigeons, kingfishers,
and other birds. It was ascertained that cassowaries also existed
on the island. Ehe sea abounded with fish, and alligators occa-
sionally made their appearance in the bay.
1 he high islands near this part of the coast appeared to have
been separated from the mainland by a convulsion of nature.
Two shocks of an earthquake were felt while the vessels were
leaving the harbour to return.*
Two different races of people inhabited this part of the island,
the Papuas, or negroes, who occupied the coast, and the Arafuras,
or inhabitants of the interior, the latter being under a sort of sub-
jection to the former. The inhabitants of the coast and the
adjacent islands were inferior in stature and personal appearance
to the people of Utanata, who were the finest race of men met
with on the coast. In other respects there was little difference
between them, except that the people near the settlement, from
having had more communication with the Ceramese, had aban-
doned many of their own customs, and adopted those of their
visitors. Their chiefs dressed in the Malay fashion, but the
poorer classes wore no other dress than a piece of cloth, some-
times made of the husk of the cocoa-nut, wrapped round the
waist, one end being brought between the legs, and fastened be-

hind. Many wore bracelets of beads and strings of hogs -teeth,
but none had their noses bored. Their woolly hair was frizzed
out by means of a bamboo comb. The women were very seldom
seen.
No data are given from which we can learn the exact amount
of population; but to judge from the number of villages men-
tioned, it must be greater than one would be led to expect, when
the state of society is taken into consideration. Slavery, the
curse of their race, works as great evils here as on the coast of
Africa, the various tribes frequently making war upon each other
to obtain captives to dispose of to the Ceramese and Macas-
sars. A short time before the arrival of the vessels, a warlike
people, inhabiting the coast to the N.W., surprised a village on
the shores of the bay in which the Dutch settlement was made.
Most of the men were killed, but the women and children were
taken into captivity, and the village was burned. The friends of
the sufferers generally in their turn make reprisals on their
weaker neighbours.
The chiefs of LUanata informed the voyagers of the number of
rivers and villages in their neighbourhood, with their respective
names. To the eastward of Utanata, in the district of Timakawa,
or Timoraka, were four rivers and seven villages, and in the dis-
trict of Koyway, which extended from the Utanata river to the
island of Lakahia, were three rivers and twenty-eight villages.
To judge from the village at the mouth of the LUanata, which was
inhabited by about twenty families, these villages should each have
a population of at least eighty individuals ; indeed, their numbers
could scarcely be less when it is taken into consideration that they
were liable to attacks from enemies. T. hus we may suppose that
the coast from Utanata to Lakahia Island, an extent of rather less
than 100 miles, contained 2240 inhabitants. It was stated by the
chiefs that the Arafura tribes in the interior were more numerous
than the Papuas on the coast.
The king of Tidor claimed the sovereignty of several districts
on the west coast of New Guinea, and nearly all the rajahs, or
head chiefs, had their titles confirmed by him.
Punishment of death, which once obtained, has been abolished.
Offenders forfeit the whole or part of their property; and a por-
tion of the confiscated goods falls to the lot of the chief, or elder,
who has passed sentence on the criminal.
The Mohammedan religion is professed by the entire popula-
tion of the coast in the neighbourhood of the fort; and the mar-
riage and funeral ceremonies are similar to those of the Cera-
mese. On some occasions, after the expiration of a year from the
time of the funeral, the bones are disinterred, when a feast is held
over them, and they are again consigned to the grave. This


is probably a relict of their old customs. Their pralius are from
fifteen to thirty feet long: some are roofed over, and the families
of the owners reside in them. The Papuas carry on a brisk trade
with the Ceramese, who arrive on the coast at the commencement
of the north-west monsoon, and remain six months. The articles
obtained here are massoy bark, rosamala and belishary?(odori-
ferous woods, which, as well as massoy, are used medicinally)?
pearls, nutmegs, trepang, birds of paradise, and edible birds?
nests; in exchange for which they receive bar iron, parangs or
chopping-knives, knife blades, brass wire, and flowered calicoes.
Owing to this communication the natives have acquired some
knowledge of the Ceramese language (a dialect of the Malay),
through the medium of which they conversed with the interpreters
who accompanied the expedition.
It does not distinctly appear whether the Dutch had any per-
sonal communication with the Arafuras; neither is it mentioned
whether the people have straight hair and brown complexions, like
the Arafuras in the interior of Magindano, Ceram, and Gilolo, or
woolly hair, like the Papuas. Probably the latter are averse to
strangers having communication with these Arafuras; for Forest,
during his visit to the north coast of New Guinea, met with none
of them; but he was informed by an intelligent Malay, who
had seen them, that some have straight and others woolly hair.
A short account of the Arafuras in the vicinity of Fort du
Bus, is given by M. Modera, on the authority of one of the
Papua chiefs. Their stature is greater than that of the Papuas,
and they are also more numerous. Their marriage ceremonies
are of a very primitive description. When a young couple form
any attachment, they fly into the forest, and remain concealed
until an arrangement is made between their respective parents.
Should not this take place the parties separate on their return to
their homes, and each is at liberty to form a new connexion.
On the death of an individual the body is washed and enve-
loped in cloth, made from the bark of a tree, or the husk of the
cocoa-nut. After which the relatives assemble, and make known
the affection they bore the deceased by howls and lamentations.
A scaffold of bamboos is then erected, on which the body is laid,
and a fire is lighted under it, and carefully kept up until the
moisture of the body is entirely evaporated. It is then laid in a sort
of loft, close under the roof of their dwelling, where it is watched
by the children belonging to the family, while the relatives feast
in the house for seven days. After the feast is concluded the
body is buried in a hole, and covered up with leaves. The pro-
perty of the deceased is retained by the widow until her death,
when it is divided among the children, the greater portion falling
to the share of the males. Should the deceased be unmarried his
property is divided among his relatives.


August 20.?The Iris, which had been sent to Amboyna
for provisions, returned, having also on board some guns for
the fort. The commander reported that the French corvette
I?Astrolabe had arrived at Amboyna from the South Seas, many of
her people being sick.
On the 24th the fort was opened with much ceremony, and
possession was taken, in the name of the King of the Nether-
lands, of the entire west coast, and part of the north and south
coasts of the island, from the meridian of 141� E., on the south
coast, to the Cape of Good Hope on the north. Many of the
native chiefs were present, who swore allegiance to the Nether-
lands? government.
Sept. I. ?The vessels left the coast of New Guinea, and the
corvette arrived at Amboyna on the sth, when sixty-two men were
sent ashore to the hospital, several of whom died; making the
total loss of European seamen, by sickness during the voyage,
amount to twenty-one. From Amboyna the corvette was de-
spatched to the island of Timor, where the naturalists were left
to make researches in the interior for silver and copper mines*
During their stay on the coast of New Guinea much rain was
experienced, and for nearly the entire month of July the weather
was cold, damp, and foggy. This led them to conclude that, as
in the Moluccas, the south-east monsoon is the rainy season, and
the north-west monsoon, which prevails from October to May, is
the fine season. This opinion was confirmed by the statements
of the natives.
Three small low islands, belonging to the chain which stretches
from Cerama to the Key islands, and not laid down in Arrow-
smith?s chart, were met with in the passage from New Guinea to
Amboyna. The northernmost of these islands is situated six
miles to the southward of the Matabella Islands; and there is a
clear channel between them, through which the corvette passed.
They may easily be distinguished from the Matabella Islands, as
the latter are high, and the southernmost has a small table hill
on the south point. The positions of these islands are given
below.

V.? Heise nach deni Ural, dem Altai und dem Kaspischen Meere.
Von Gustav Rose. Vol. I. Berlin, 1837.
Journey to the Ural and Altai Mountains, and to the Caspian
Sea. Communicated by W. Wittich, Esq.
About twelve years since Baron Alexander von Humboldt re-
solved to visit the Uralian Mountains, because he conceived that
there existed a similarity in the geological constitution of that
range with the Andes of New Granada, and he wished to decide
the point. Immediately on the court of St. Petersburg becoming
acquainted with that resolution, it proposed to him to make the
journey at the expense of the government of the country, autho-
rising him at the same time to choose as companions some per-
sons to assist him in his researches. He selected Professor
Ehrenberg and Professor G, Rose, the author of the volume
before us. Leaving Berlin in the spring of 1829, they went to
St. Petersburg and thence through Moscow and Nowgorod to
Kasan, whence they passed through Perm and over the Ural
Mountains to Yekaterinburg, from which place they travelled
along the eastern declivity of the Llral range as far northward as
Bogoslowsk, in 60� N. lat., examining the geological constitution
of the mountains and several of the numerous mines, which are
met with on that side of the LYal. Having returned to Yekaterin-
burg they advanced to Tobolsk, and thence through the steppe
of Barabinska to Bernaul, for the purpose of examining the
Altai Mountains. Having traversed the steppe of Platowsk,
they arrived at the Schlangenberg, and advanced afterwards to
the other mines situated on the western declivity of the range.
Whilst they were examining the mountains about Syranowsk, the


most southern of these mines, they visited Baty or Khonimailakha,
in lat. 49� 10' N., long. 84� 20' E., a military post of the Chinese
on the river Irtysh. From the banks of the Irtysh they began to
return, passing through the steppe of Ishun to the southern range
of the Ural, and to Astrakhan and the Caspian Sea. In return-
ing hence to St. Petersburg they visited the great salt lake of
Elton. Up to the present year no account of this journey has
been published, except a few observations inserted in Baron Hum-
boldt?s ? Fraqmem Asiatiques
Professor Rose?s work partly supplies this deficiency. It gives
principally an account of the geological constitution of the coun-
tries through which they passed, and of its minerals, but contains
also some interesting geographical observations.
In passing from St. Petersburg to Moscow they tried to ascer-
tain the elevations of the hills of Waldai by barometrical observa-
tions. They found that the northern part of the table land was
724 feet above the Baltic at St. Petersburg, and the Popowa
Gora, the highest part of the hills, did not attain more than 846
leet. Professor Rose, however, thinks that these determinations
are only to be considered as approximations, on account of the
considerable oscillations of the barometer.
It would however seem that the high ground which forms the
watershed in the interior of Russia, between the rivers running
south and north, increases in advancing eastward; for they found
that the country situated between the Wialka and Kama consti-
tuted a table land, which rises to 870 feet above the sea, so that
at the watershed itself the elevation must considerably exceed
1000 feet.
They crossed the Ural by the same road as Mr. Erman * The
greatest height of the pass between Klenowskaia and Kirgis-
shanskaia does not exceed 1344 feet, which seems to be "the
average elevation of the range between 56� and 58� N. lat.,
though some rocky masses rise perhaps a thousand feet higher!
Fliis elevation is doubtless very moderate, when we consider that
the base on which the range rests, at an average, is 900 feet above
the sea. The Ural, which here consists of three parallel ranges,
occupies a width of about twenty miles. Professor Rose 'ob-
serves, that in several places the range does not constitute the
watershed between the rivers of Europe and Asia, but that some
of them rise on the eastern declivity of the mountains, and after
skirting it for some distance break through the range and mingle
their waters with those of the tributaries"to the Kama. This,lie
observes, is the case with the Tshussowaja, a river rising about
fifty miles south of Yekaterinburg, which skirts the eastern decli-
