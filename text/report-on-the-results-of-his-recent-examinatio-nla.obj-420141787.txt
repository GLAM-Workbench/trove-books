Department of Mines, Sydney, 21 January, 1885
To the Honorable J. P. Abbott, M.P., Minister for Mines.
Deport By Dr. B. yon Lendenfeld on the results of bis recent examination of the
central part of the Australian Alps.


these mountains on three different occasions, and once made an ascent of this peak, which was named by
the local men after him. Professor Neumayer calculated the height at 7,176 feet. Our three measure-
ments are accordingly within 6 feet of one another.
This peak was drawn correctly on Townsend’s map, whose traverse goes over the summit. It is
marked Mount Kosciusco, with the altitude at 7,260 feet on the map of the County of Wallace. On
Townsend’s map the peak has no name. The cairn on its summit was built by the Victorians, who
measured this point trigonometrically from four points, and make its altitude 7,266 feet. It is
surprising that there should be such a disparity in the different calculations. I have received
information from Mr. Black, after which there can be no doubt that our measurements refer to the
same spot, Mueller’s Peak, as this is the only one with a cairn. The Victorians term this peak “ Rams-
head,” which greatly enhances the confusion in the nomenclature. The peak has been termed Mount
Kosciusco by Strzelecki, and is described with that name in the county map of Wallace.
I take the local term “ Ramsheads” in the local sense as applying to the southern portion of the
Kosciusco group, and choosing a new name for the highest point, which is not called “ Pamshead” in the
locality.
Mount Kosciusco is a term applied to the whole mountain, and different parts of the plateau are
also called Mount Kosciusco by the inhabitants of the valleys of the Murray and the Snowy Rivers. This
term, moreover, does not exactly apply to the rocky peak which the Snowy Valley people call Mueller’s
Peak (as Mr. Spencer informs me). This peak is the one which is always ascended by tourists who go on
an excursion to Mount Kosciusco.
In its northern course the height of the main range rapidly decreases till a deep saddle is reached
about 3 miles to the north, beyond which it rises again.
The Eastern Secondary Ranges.
In the Kosciusco group we find several ridges descending from the main range in an easterly direc-
tion, one of which appears of greater geographical importance. This is the Ramshead Range. As men-
tioned above, this ridge extends in an east and west direction, forming the watershed between the Snowy
and Crackenback Rivers, and is continued to the westward of the main range for over 6 miles in the same
direction. The eastern portion of this ridge I term “ Ramshead Range,” derived from the local name
“ Ramsheads,” which applies to a large area, and has hitherto not been defined.
A mile or a mile and a quarter to the east of Mount Townsend, the Ramshead range, which in its
western portion has an average height of 7,000 feet, is depressed to a broad and flat range only about 5,300
feet high. This part of it keeps the same direction as the other, and extends without change in appearance
until it forms the eastern margin of the Kosciusco Plateau, It appears as a gentle rise in the plateau,
mostly covered with grass, and only here and there studded with masses of disintegrating granite.
The range parallel to the Crackenback River, which is a continuation of the Ramshead Range, and
which I designate as the eastern boundary range, is higher than the eastern portion of the Ramshead Range.
The lowest point of the latter, a wide flat in the place of a pass, lies about 3 miles east of Mount Townsend.
The eastern boundary range is nearly straight, and extends in a north-easterly direction, hardly
changing its altitude, and without pronounced peaks or passes for about 10 miles to “Pretty Point,” the
north-eastern corner of the Kosciusco Plateau, 5,778 feet high, where it appears abruptly broken off.
Decreasing in altitude, rapidly at first and then gently, it extends from here to “West Point,” at the
junction of the Snowy and the Crackenback. This eastern boundary range lies so close to the Crackenback
River that there is no room for the formation of branch ridges on the south-eastern side. •
From the western side of it, however, several extensive ridges branch off. Half a mile to the north
of the junction with the Ramshead Range a ridge branches off, which extends for a distance of several miles,
and bends round from an original westerly to a north-westerly direction.
This is a high ridge, from which several formidable peaks protrude. In it, about half-way between
commencement and termination, a gap named Charlotte’s Pass, and measured by me at 5,845 feet, is situated.
The next western branch ridge is inconspicuous; on its northern face a very good camping place is situated,
where people who ascend the mountain generally camp. This place is termed Betts’s Camp, and I determined
its altitude at 5,672 feet.
To the north of Betts’s Camp another and very important ridge branches off, parallel to the former
one, which sinks down to a low saddle north-west of Betts’s Camp, and then curves round to the N.N.E.
At the bend this ridge rises up to a greater elevation; the hill is termed the “Perisher.”
North


North of the Ramshead Range another short and rounded ridge branches off from the main range,
and extends in an easterly direction; it is highest about a quarter of a mile to the east of the main range,
from which it is divided by a wide saddle, of which I determined the altitude to be 6,517 feet.
The range is only 2 miles long, and terminates at the Snowy River, at a height of 4,905 feet.
I have named the pass and the range mentioned above Townsend Pass and Range,
At Mount Clarke, the rocky peak where the main range runs abruptly to the westward, a secondary
range descends in a north-easterly direction. It forms a curve to the north-east, and is terminally forked.
I have named this range the “ Mueller Range.”
Part of the southern flank of this range is very steep, and in fact the largest gradients I have seen on
the mountains are met with here. There are steep grassy slopes and nearly vertical rocks descending to a
little lake lying at the head of the valley below.
Western Secondary Ranges.
Prom Mount Townsend a range extends in a westerly direction, which firstly has a south-westerly,
and further on a north-westerly direction. This ridge divides the northern and the southern sources of the
Murray, and extends for about 6 miles.
The part nearest the main range is high, and crowned here and there with rocky protuberances ;
further on the range sinks abruptly at the western margin of the plateau, and continues thence as a low
range, about 4,000 feet high.
To the north of Wilkinson Yalley another secondary westerly range is situated, which branches off
from the main range at Mueller’s Peak. This is an important, high, rocky ridge. It descends from Mueller’s
Peak to a pass about 250 feet below the peak, and then rises again to a fine dome-shaped rocky peak about
7,100 feet high, which I have named “Abbott Peak.” From thence it extends for about half a mile, at
the great height of 6,900-7,000 feet to the margin of the plateau; then sinking rapidly down into the valley
of the Murray. A long spur extends from this Abbott range south-easterly into Wilkinson Yalley.
Northward there are two small western branches south of the Murray source, springing from the
main range. Here it appears that the plateau westward of the main range narrows out to a strip only a
quarter of a mile wide.
e Yalleys and Rivers.
By far the greatest part of the Kosciusco plateau is drained by the Snowy River*. Its numerous
branches extend up all the valleys between the main range and the Ramshead Range with its north-
eastern extension.
To the north of the Townsend Range a pretty lake (Lake Albina) is situated, from which one of the
sources of the Snowy River rises.
The abundance of water in these streams is something altogether unprecedented in Australia. When
one crosses the Snowy River at West Point one is struck by the volume of water as clear as crystal coming
down. I crossed at about the driest part of the year after a season of drought. Even then the water was
flowing at the rate of 6 miles an hour, and at the place the river was about 30 feet wide, and, on average,
1 foot 6 inches deep ; in other words, 23,760 cubic feet of water passed there per minute, which is about
2,640 tons. This locality I calculated to be at a height of 2,952 feet. But this magnificent body of water
is small as compared with that of the river when in flood; for it then fills the valley from side to side, and
reaches a width of nearly 2 chains, and an average depth of 7 feet. The waters thunder down at a rate of
40 miles per hour, so that even Mr. Spencer, who has lived at the place for twenty-one years, sometimes did
not dare to face the stream on his gallant steed. The volume of water passing the locality per minute would
then be about 1,000,000 cubic feet.
The idea of utilizing the abundant water of the Snowy River*, for the purpose of irrigating some dry
districts in the vicinity, is an old one. In the case of the Snowy River it will be much easier to attain this
end than in the case of most other Australian rivers, as there will not only not be any loss of water by
evaporation in a great part of the canal, but the water will even increase in quantity for some time as it
flows along. This can easily be understood if we consider that the Snowy River carries snow-water, which
is very cold as such. The river must therefore act as a condenser, and instead of there being any evapora-
tion to decrease the amount of Avater in it, there will be condensation increasing it. The water is much
colder than the air above, which is consequently rapidly cooled down as it comes in contact with the water,
and the capacity for carrying vapour is consequently locally reduced. A little fog is produced, consisting
of small particles of water which fall into the river. This process will go on until the water in the
river


river is so much heated that it will no longer condense the aqueous vapour in the air. For some distance
there will be neither condensation or evaporation. As the temperature of the water as it flows along
becomes still higher, evaporation will commence, increasing with the temperature.
I have frequently observed the formation of fogs 2 or 3 feet thick on rivers filled with snow-water,
in different parts of the world, and also on one occasion on the Snowy River.
The tributaries to this river, which come from the trough in the Kosciusco plateau, all contain
beautiful clear water, flowing briskly over the granite boulders which the spring floods bring down the
mountain flanks, or wending their way through black bogs, and moving slowly along, cutting deep into the
black spongy soil.
The tributaries to the other rivers likewise contain very clear water. The fall is pretty great. On
the plateau, in the bogs, the fall may at places be not more than 8 inches to the mile. On the steeps which
intervene between the boggy flats in the wide valleys, the fall is very great, from linsotol in 8. I
calculated the height of a tributary to the Snowy River at the foot of Townsend range at 4,905 feet. At
West Point the height of the river is 2,952 feet. The distance run by this stream is about 30 miles, which
would make an average fall of lin 81, On the plateau, and also down below in the valley of the main
stream, the average fall is very much less, but at the margin of the plateau—where this tributary flows into
the main stream—we have a fall of perhaps from lin2otol in 10 for several hundred feet. The average
fall, however, shows that it would be easy to bring a road up to the very heart of the mountains—or even
a railway.
Three tributaries to the Snowy rise at the foot of the highest peaks in Australia. The largest of
these is situated between the main range north of Mueller’s Peak, the portion connecting this peak with the
eastern part of the main range at Mount Clarke and that eastern secondary range which appears as the
northern continuation of the latter.
South of this range another river is situated. It originates apparently in a beautiful blue lake at
the head of a deep flat valley, and flows in an easterly direction. I name this lake, as stated above, “ Lake
Albina.” Divided from this stream by the Townsend range another large valley is situated, watered by a
stream which rises at the foot of Mount Townsend. This stream joins another coming from the east; both
combined form a large stream draining the extensive flats and valleys to the north of the Ramshead range.
I name the valley at the foot of Mount Townsend (eastward) “ Townsend Valley,” and the river which
drains it and the flats to the eastward, “ Townsend River.”
Numerous streams are met with on the western slopes of the eastern boundary range, all flowing into
a large rivulet, which extends in a northerly direction, and which appears as one of the main tributaries of
the Snowy River.
All the valleys of the extensive eastern Kosciusco plateau are alike—long, broad, and flat, with
bogs at the bottom, and here and there a steep step of varying height intervening between two adjacent
bogs. To the west of the main range the valleys are different. Wide and flat in the upper part, they
become steep and narrow at the margin of the plateau, where, as Townsend says on his map, they form
“stupendous ravines.”
The most important of these western valleys, all of which contain tributaries to the Murray, is the
“ Wilkinson Valley.” This valley is of particular interest, as the finest glacier-polished rocks have been
found in it. It is enclosed by the Abbott range to the north-west, Mueller’s peak to the north, Mount
Clarke and the main range to the east, and the Wilkinson range to the south-east. The upper part of the
valley which forms part of the Kosciusco plateau is wide and flat, and its bottom about 6,000 feet above the
sea. The valley extends from north-east to south-west; it is however narrowed by spurs approaching from
either side at the place where it appears abruptly broken off at the margin of the plateau. From the
Abbott range a spur extends in a south-westerly direction far into this flat basin, forcing the rivulet which
drains it to the other side of the valley. In the glacial period this valley was filled by a glacier which
having to round the spur described, ground down and polished the rocks on that spur very extensively.
The valleys are very different on the plateau and down below. Roughly speaking, one might say that
on the plateau the valleys were broad and the ridges narrow, whilst down below the ridges are broad and
rounded, whilst the valleys are narrow. The difference will be clearly discerned in the figure section
through the Kosciusko plateau. I have noticed this difference also elsewhere, and shall return to it in
that part of this Report which dwells on the geology of our group of mountains.
Characteristic of the Kosciusco plateaux are the peat bogs, which are said to be very treacherous. I
did not find them so dangerous as others have done because I was there in an exceptionally dry season ;
none of us was ever bogged. In the flats in the valleys or in flats on spurs, in flats on passes and even on
the inclined sides of the hills, places which may be 1 in 15 steep, and do not lie in a hollow, we meet


with, these bogs. They are formed in consequence of the great amount of water which falls in these parts,
the slow process of evaporation, the impermeable nature of the underlying granite rock, and the plants,
chiefly a kind of heather, which retain the moisture like a sponge.
Casting a glance at the general topographical features of these mountains, they appear as a large
plateau dipping eastward and northward, and fringed south-east and west by mountain ranges.
Nomenclature.
In the published maps only one mountain and the main rivers in our group are named : these are
Mt. Kosciusco and the Murray, Snowy, and Crackenback Rivers. The representation of the mountains in
the N.S.W. county maps is perfectly correct, only there are no details, and in fact nothing is drawn except
the main range. The name Mt. Kosciusco on the map is not the one by which the peak is generally known
amongst the settlers at the foot of the mountain, who have their cattle on it, and who know it well..
The following Alphabetic List will give references to all the names alluded to in this Report.
Abbott Peak. —Rocky, Peak south-west of Mueller’s Peak, about 7,080 feet high; named by myself in
honor of the Minister for Mines, whose liberality and protection of scientific research demands the
esteem and gratitude of every scientific man.
Abbott Range. —Range extending from Abbott Peak in a south-westerly direction, named by myself after
Abbott Peak.
Adams's Pass. —A pass in the main range between Mount Townsend and Mueller’s Peak, 6,169 feet above

this eastern portion is connected with the eastern boundary range; it leads from one of the main
sources of the Snowy River into the valley of Betts’s River; this pass is often crossed by visitors and
also by stock ; named by myself after Betts’s Camp.

Crackenback River. —River to the south-east of the Kosciusko plateau ; official name on the county map
of Wallace.
Eastern Boundary Range. —The range which divides the lower part of the Crackenback River from the,
river system of the Snowy, it fringes the south-eastern margin of the Kosciusko plateau; named by
myself, according to its position.
Kosciusco Plateau.— The plateau extending around the highest peaks, particularly in a north-easterly
direction ; named by myself after Mount Kosciusco.
Lake Albina. —The lake at the head of the valley between Townsend Range and Mueller’s Range; named
by myself ; nomen proprium.
Mount Clarke. —The rocky peak about half a mile east of Mueller’s Peak, at the point of the range where
it turns abruptly to the west; named by myself in honor of the late Rev. W. B. Clarke, M.A., F.R.S.,
who ascended Mount Kosciusco in the year 1852. [See “ Remarks on Sedimentary Formations,” p. 5.]
Mount Kosciusco.- —-The whole mass of mountains now bears that name ; it was originally given by Count
Strzelecki, the first white man there, in honor of his famous and ill-fated countryman, either to the
whole of the mountains or to the peak now termed “Mueller’s Peak.” I adopt the word in the local
sense as applying to the group, and not to a definite point. On the county maps of Selwyn and
Wallace, Mueller’s Peak is termed Mount Kosciusco,
MounL


Mount Townsend. —The highest mountain in Australia, 2| miles south B|° east of Mueller’s Peak, 7,256
feet high, according to my barometrical measurement. Accepting the Victorian geodetical survey of
Mueller’s Peak as correct, this mountain would be about 95 feet higher, that is 7,351 feet. In
Townsend’s original map this peak is termed “ Ramshead” ; named by myself in honor of Mr, Townsend,
Government Surveyor, who made a traverse survey of the main range, and on that occasion ascended
this peak, in the years 1846 and 1847.
Mueller’s Peak. —The rocky peak at the point where the main range forms a right angle open to the north-
east ; it is marked with a large beehive-shaped, artistically built stone cairn; a local name which was
established probably some twenty-five years ago by Mr. Spencer, who was Baron Perdinand von
Mueller’s guide on the occasion of his ascending this peak, in honor of this illustrious scientist. Iden-
tical with the “Mount Kosciusco” of the county maps of Selwyn, and Wallace 7,171 feet high, and
identical with the “ Pamshead” of the Victorian geodetical survey, calculated by them at 7,266 feet high.
Mueller’s Range. —Range extending northward from the point where the main range forms an angle open
to the south-west; named by myself after Mueller’s Peak.
Murray River. —Official name ; the numerous little streams which altogether are the soui’ces of this river
have as yet no separate names.
Perisher. —A mountain named so in consequence of cold and want of food on the summit, experienced by
Mr. Pyrie, who made the first ascent with Mr, Spencer; situated in a range joining the eastern
boundary range.
Pretty Point.— The north-eastern corner of the Kosciusco plateau on the eastern boundary range; a local
name: altitude, 5,778 feet.
Prussian Flat. —A little grassy flat on the eastern boundary range ; west 22° north of Mount To tvnsend ;
local name. The picture on title-page was photographed from here. Altitude, 6,017 feet.

myself after the “ Ramsheads”; altitude, 7,052 feet.
Ramshead Range.— Range extending from Mount Townsend in an easterly direction, dividing the Cracken-
back from the Snowy River, and joining the eastern boundary range with the main range; named by
myself after the “Ramsheads.”
Ramsheads. —The whole southern portion of our group of mountains is locally termed “the Ramsheads,” in
consequence of the heads of granite protruding here and there over the rounded ridges; old local name ;
in Townsend’s original map a peak, probably identical with Mount Townsend, is termed “ Ramshead” ;
Mueller’s peak is termed “ Ramshead” by the Victorian geodetical surveyors.
Snowy River. —Old name on the official map of the county of Wallace, This river drains the greater part
of the Kosciusco plateau ; the small tributaries have no names, with the exception of those I have
given above.
Strzelecki’s Pass. —A pass at the eastern foot of Mueller’s peak, with little lagoon in it, on the main range;
named by myself after the first man who ascended Mueller’s peak ; about 7,000 feet high.
Tom’s Flat. —A little flat on the eastern boundary range, a little to the south (1 mile), of Pretty Point;
glacier-polished rocks here; local name.
Townsend’s Pass. —Pass dividing the Townsend Range from the main range; named by myself after
Townsend Valley; altitude, 6,517 feet.
Townsend’s Range —Range springing from the main range between Mount Townsend, and Mount Clarke,
and extending in an easterly direction ; named by myself after the Townsend Valley; about 2 | miles
long and 6,800 feet high.
Townsend’s River. —The southernmost tributary to the Upper Snowy River, draining the Townsend Valley,
and named by myself after it. Where this river rounds the foot of Townsend range it lies 4,905 feet
above the sea.
Townsend’s Valley. —The valley and flats extending from Mount Townsend to the eastern boundary range
along the northern flank of the Ramshead Range ; named by myself after Mr. Townsend, who
surveyed and traversed the main range of the Australian Alps in these parts, in the years 1846-7.

in a south-westerly direction. Named by myself after Mr. 0. S. Wilkinson, Government Geologist, as
a token of public esteem and private gratitude.
2. CALCULATION OP HEIGHTS.
The heights were calculated with an aneroid by Parker & Son, which has accompanied me in the
New Zealand Alps, and which I know to be very accurate.
As shown in the plate of barometrical curves, I took the readings of all Meteorological Stations in
the vicinity, viz.:—Moruya, Eden, Albury, Cooma*, and also Melbourne, and Sydney, and constructed the
barometrical curves for each place. Then a mean curve was drawn, which was partly constructed as a mean
of the above, and partly from six observations taken by myself at our highest camp, extending over three
days. This mean curve is the one with which I compared my readings, and in this way a more accurate
and reliable result could be obtained than by simply comparing with one or the other of the lower readings.
The likely error is 80 feet, and may in all probability not exceed more than 15 feet. In this way the
heights have been calculated.
Table op Heights.
Mount Townsend (two obs.) 7,256
Mueller’s Peak (two obs.) 7,171

One point has previously been measured, and that is Mueller’s Peak. The measurments of it are—
Strzelecki (boil-water test) 6,500
Mueller (boil- water test) over 7,000
Clarke (Aneroid) 7,176
Neumayer (Aneroid) 7,175
Geodetical Survey of Victoria (Triangulation) 7,266
Myself (Aneroid) 7,171
If we accept the triangulation of the Victorians, my heights of other points must be altered
accordingly : then Mt. Townsend wouldhave aheight of 7,351 feet, and the other observations taken on the same
day will have to be raised 95 feet each. I have mentioned above that the greatest possible error in my
observations was 80 feet, and I think that we will therefore have to await further evidence before accepting
the height of Mueller’s Peak at 7,266 feet. To show that mistakes can be made even by a trigonometrical
survey, I beg to refer to the measurements of Mount Cook made by the Geodetical Survey at 12,375 feet,
which height was afterwards corrected by subsequent surveys made by the same Department to 12,349 feet.
The former was a mean of (I think) seven, the latter a mean of twenty-two observations.
3. GEOLOGY.
The greater part of the whole mountain consists of granite. This granite is lighter and contains
more quartz on Mount Townsead than on Muellpr’s Peak further north.
The Ramshead and Townsend Ranges are traversed by a zone of brown stratified quartzite [T), in a
width of about 20 chains, and extending due north and south.
This may possibly be a continuation in a southerly direction of that strip of Silurian which has been
observed to the north-west of Mount Kosciusco. The
* I must express my gratitude to the gentlemen in charge of the Meteorological Stations at Cooma and Albury, for
taking several readings daily in addition to the usual ones during my stay on the mountains.
10—B


The following geological specimens have been collected :
No. I.—Granite with hornblende, a little east of west point, Mr, Spencer’s former station. Main joints
clearly defined, giving to the whole mass a stratified appearance. Strike, south 7 5 west; dip
northerly at 17 '5.
No. 2.—Granite from summit of Mueller’s Peak, rather dark-coloured and apparently easily disintegrated.
No, 3.—Granite from summit of Mount Townsend, hard and light-coloured. Parallel joints extending in
the same direction for several chains. Strike W. SN, ; dip northerly at 72.
No. 4.—Brown quartzite from Ramshead Range. A zone of this rock extends parallel to the main range in
a width of about 20 chains at least over the Ramshead and Townsend Ranges, probably much further
in both directions. Clearly stratified ; surface rocks all broken ; measurements very uncertain • strike
N. 32° W. dip at nearly 90°.
No. s.—Another specimen of the same rock with dark-brown small veins.
No. 6.—Lignite and shale from the vicinity of Cooma. Exact locality and particulars unknown.
The granite shows the ordinary influence of the air and water, and is decomposed in the lower
regions, so that only the “ nuclei”—the hardest parts —remain, which are rounded off and worn so as to
form large round boulders. Such granite is met with up to about 5,500 feet. Above that the decomposition
acts in quite a different manner. There the mechanical splitting effect by expansion of freezing water exceeds
that of the chemical action of C0 2 and H 2 O, and consequently the shapes of the weathered granite masses
are different. At first we find the granite split along the joints and then weathered at the corners (compare
foreground in title-page); Higher up the freezing effect increases still more, in proportion as the chemical
forces decrease, and there we find the granite split up into sharp-edged rocks, crowning the heights, such
rock forms the summits of Mueller’s Peak. (See photograph of summit of Mount Kosciusco and others.)
On the heights the effect of flowing water down the mountain sides is greater than that of the flowing
streams in the valleys, so that more material is brought down the mountain sides than can be carried away
by the mountain stream. The mountains become sharp and pointed, the ridges narrow, and the flanks
steep, whilst the valleys represent extended flats.
Down below, where the streams are larger, where many mountain rivulets have joined to form a
single stream, the eroding action of this far exceeds that of the water coming down the flanks of the hills ;
the rivers eat into the ground and so the valleys are deepened, whilst their flanks are scarcely eroded, and
so the valleys become narrow, whilst the ranges appear broad and rounded.
The Traces of Glacial Action,
I have found no moraines in the district which might indicate that once glaciers existed there, but I
have found rocks polished by glacial action in many places. The ice moving slowly down the valley exerts
an immense pressure against the bottom. If any hard stones are frozen into the ice, then they will scratch
the rocks at the bottom of the valley, particularly in exposed places, as on spurs which protrude into a
valley filled with a moving ice stream. Rocks polished in this way were found in the following places :
(1.) An extensive polished surface, measuring about 500 square feet, in Tom’s Flat, on the eastern
boundary range ; altitude, 5,800 feet. (See photograph, plate V.)
(2.) On the eastern slopes of the range extending in a northerly direction, and branching from
that which connects the “ Perisher ” with the eastern boundary range, about 5,900 feet
altitude. A very large one on the face of an insignificant spur, and a few on the mountain
side of the spur.
(3.) In Wilkinson Valley, below Abbot Peak, at a height of 6,163 feet, there are three very well
preserved polished rocks. (See photographs.)
(4.) The most numerous rocks polished by glacial action are to be found on the face of that spur
which descends from the Abbott Range into Wilkinson Valley. The lower part of this, up to
a height of 500 feet above the bottom of the valley, is covered with these “ roches moutonnees,”
and shows that the glacier which filled this valley was at least 500 feet thick.
As I did not find any glacier traces below 5,800 feet, I consider myself justified in doubting the
correctness of conclusions drawn from other observations, that prehistoric glacier traces are to be found on
the Blue Mountains, in South Australia, and Gippsland.
If the glaciers fed by the snowfields of the greatest elevation in Australia did not even come down
below 5,000 feet or so, it cannot be expected that glacier traces will be found at a lower level in any other
part of Australia. At


At the time of the glacial period, when there was plenty of rain at lower levels and snow and ice
on these ranges, there was food for the gigantic marsupials we now find in a fossil state scattered over the
country.
The extent of the glaciers may have been as great as that of the plateau, namely, 150 square miles.
It appears that at the glacial period an extensive mass of ice covered the Kosciusko plateau down to
5,800 feet. This glacier was pretty continuous in the upper part of the Snowy tributaries, intersected by a
few high ranges as that of the “ Perisher.” The A r alleys were filled with ice; the ice streams in these
A 7 alleys probably joined to form a large glacier in the Snowy Valley, which may have extended some
distance downward. It is highly probable that a trace of a terminal moraine will be found in the Snowy
Valley. At the head of the Crackenback Valley there was room for a small glacier, which probably covered
the south-eastern flank of Mount Townsend.
The western valleys are only short. That part of them which is situated on the plateau was glaciated
all along the western slope of the main range.
The Wilkinson Valley was filled by a glacier about 500 feet thick.
If we compare these observations and conclusions with those made by other authors, we shall find that
the observations published here are the first true record of a glacial period in Australia. The Rev. Teni-
son-Woods (Proceedings of the Linnean Society, vol. Yii, p. 382) does not believe that the evidence of a
glacial period hitherto brought forAvard is reliable, and doubts whether such a period ever existed in Australia,
He never visited the highest elevation in Australia—-Mount Kosciusco. Mr. Howitt also can find no traces
of a glacial period in the vicinity of Lake Omeo, (Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol. xxxv,
page 35.) He also did not visit Mount Kosciusco. Mr. Griffiths (Proceedings of the Royal Society of
Victoria) is inclined to consider extensive clay and gravel formations in Gippsland as being of glacial origin.
Professor Tate (Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia, anniversary address, 1878-79)
found traces of glacial action, scratched rocks on the beach, near Adelaide. Ido not doubt that these are
erratics brought by icebergs from Wilke’s Land.
Although these gentlemen differ in opinion in many respects, none of them ever went to the place
where glacial traces might be expected to be found. One must go to the highest mountains to decide any
question of prehistoric glaciation. If no traces of a glaciation are found down below, that is no reason why
the mountains should not have been covered with ice. If glacial traces are found below, how much more
evident and extensive will the glacier traces be on the hills.
The Present Snowfields
Although there are no glaciers on the mountains now, still there are patches of snow Avhich never
vanish, —a common occurence on hills of a little greater height, eight to nine thousand feet, in the European
Alps.
These snowfields are met Avith along the main range, clinging in patches and strips to the eastern
face of the mountain, about 30 feet below the ridge. They are on an average 50 feet wide, and are the
remnants of the snow blown over the ridge by westerly gales, as seen in the figure.

The upper limit of the groAvth of trees is at about 5,900 feet. The eucalypti grow with quite unusual
luxuriance in a zone betAveen 4,000 feet and 4,500 feet, where their stems attain a greater diameter and
grow straighter and higher than either below or above. At the upper limit of ti’ee growth the timber is
small and stunted, the trees attaining a height of 12 feet only.


The upper regions up to 7,100 feet are covered with rich verdure ; beautiful soft grass growing a
foot high, enough for five sheep per acre, during the summer. Numerous sweet alpine herbs grow among
the grass. The whole is a most beautiful pasture-land.
In the bogs tussock-grass and heather predominate.
Of animals there are but few in the higher regions. Snakes, particularly the black water-snake,
are very abundant. The scrub on the south-eastern slope of the eastern boundary-range is full of lyre-
birds. The only four-footed animals are native dogs, which at present kill many sheep, and wild horses,
which are to be found in great abundance on the plateau.
Kangaroos, opossums, &c., are not met with.
Flies have been found in abundance even on the very top of Mueller’s Peak, Another dipterous
insect—the “ March fly”—stings badly, and very troublesome to horses, is frequent at a height of 6,000 feet.
In a lagoon close on the summit of Mount Kosciusco numerous aquatic insects were found enjoying
one day’s sunshine for many days of frost and darkness. This lagoon is frozen by far the greater part of
the year, and only 2 feet deep.
A list of nineteen plants collected during my excursion is appended

5. METEOROLOGY.
The rivers flowing from this group of mountains show that there must be an amount of aqueous
precipitation there which far exceeds the rainfall and dew in any other part of Australia. The observations
at Kiandra, the nearest place where they are taken, and which place lies on a similar plateau as the
Kosciusco plateau, show a rainfall there exceeding every year that at any other station in New South Wales.
I think that there may be as much as 100 inches per annum on the Kosciusco plateau. All this water
does by no means come down in the shape of rain or snow : the greater part is dew. The whole of the
plateau acts as a vast condenser.
Exposed, in consequence of the great elevation and the thin layer of air above it, to an exceptional
irradiation, it cools down over night so much that even on days so hot as those- during which we camped
there the ground was frozen hard every morning.
The warm and damp air coming along horizontally from the sea is forced up the sides of the mountain,
and there it comes in contact with the cold ground—below freezing-point; a quantity of the moisture is neces-
sarily condensed, and heavy dew falls. I have had a very extensive Alpine experience, but nowhere have I
met with such dew as on Mount Kosciusco. I estimate the amount of dew per night at Aof an inch. This
dew often freezes, and our tent was as hard as a weatherboard house in consequence every morning.


The great amount of snow, which lies above 6,000 feet for from six to eight months in the year, of
course also greatly adds to the fertility of the soil in summer. In Central Europe the snow makes the
ground so rich that more can be grown there in the six months in summer than in any other part of the
world in the whole year.
I have mentioned above that the patches of eternal snow described above are found on Mount
Kosciusco in a latitude of 37° S., about 1,500 feet lower than in the European Alps in a latitude of 47° N.
To find a place in Europe where everlasting snow comes down to 6,000 feet we should have to go up to
latitude 52°, Here in Australia the snow comes as far down in 37° as in Europe in 52°. In Hew Zealand
the snow and ice are also very much more extensive than in Europe at a similar latitude. This is another
proof of the old statement that the southern hemisphere is colder and damper than the northern.
6. PRACTICAL RESULTS.
In the vicinity of Cooma lignite is found, a specimen of which was forwarded to the Government
Geologist.
The whole plateau of Mount Kosciusco extending for about 160 square miles, is most valuable
country, which is at present hardly utilized at all.
In the lower regions there are beautiful forests of useful timber, and above there is a well watered
treeless pasture ground which can only be excelled by the pastures in the European Alps. This is clear of
snow for eight to three months in the year, according to the altitude.
There is no difficulty in making roads up to any part of the plateau, and I would myself guarantee
to drive a buggy from Sydney up to the very summit of Mount Townsend any day.
The Alpine districts of Europe in Tyrol and Switzerland have a separate legislation, and so the
pastures can be utilized. It seems that our land laws would not apply well to this Alpine district ; and as
it is such valuable pasture ground, it is a great pity and a loss to the country that it is not utilized.
I would recommend that an inquiry should be made regarding the desiderata of the squatters in the
vicinity of the mountain.
The whole ground is good for cattle, but sheep must be kept from the bogs, for fear of fluke.
Another drawback to the breeding of sheep is the native dogs, which find a shelter in the extensive
uninhabited country along the main range, and always molest the squatters around. As soon as shepherds
will be there in greater numbers it will be an easy matter to exterminate them, as £1 is paid per head for
them.
I would like to draw attention to the suitability of the rivers for irrigation, to which I alluded
above.
The water power in the Snowy and Crackenback might be well utilized for cutting up the timber,
which grows in a zone between 4,000 and 4,500 feet, where I observed a most luxuriant forest of very
valuable timber.
7. DESCRIPTION OE MY JOURNEY.
I and Charles Cullen, Collector to the Geological Survey, started from Cooma with provisions and
instruments, the latter of which were kindly supplied me by the Surveyor General and the Government
Geologist, on the morning of January the 7th, 1885, in the District Surveyor’s wagonette, with Mr. Betts
himself in it, to whose energy and chivalrous courtesy any success which I may have had must be ascribed.
We spent the night at the hospitable station of Mr. Hepburn, and proceeded uphill the next
morning. A lake swarming with black swans is passed, it is warm and sultry ; the same day there was a
heavy thunderstorm in Sydney, The roads are excellent, and although the drought has turned the paddocks
around threadbare and yellow, still it has made the natural road as hard as stone and as smooth as a
waxed floor. Man with all his skill cannot make a road artificially to equal one like this. We reached
Mr. Spencer’s station before noon. Mr. Spencer has lived in these parts for twenty-five years ; he is the
king of the mountain, and certainly was the first white man who went up the mountain from the eastern
side.
He accompanied us from here as guide, and I owe him many thanks for his kindness and information,
Mr. Betts had to return to Cooma. The packing of the instruments and provisions took a long time, but
finally at 3 p.m. we three made a start on horseback, each man leading a packhorse.
We rode down into the Snowy Yalley, crossed the river of the same name, and began to ascend the
hill facing us, on a good track through a fine forest.


The Snowy Valley, at this place termed “ West Point,” the former residence of Mr. Spencer, is very
pretty, the green banks come down to the water’s edge and the clear stream flows over the boulders, telling
of better things above. The first incline is soon surmounted, and we continue our ride along the summit of
the eastern boundary range on which we now are. The forest attains greater beauty the higher up we get ;
here and there a little fiat destitute of trees, like a lawn in a park, is passed. The grass here is already
much fresher than below, and nearly green. We enter the sub-alpine forest which, although consisting of
eucalyptus trees, still has the same character as the renowned sub-alpine forests of Abies sylvestris in Europe.
Strength to resist the winter’s load of snow is the leading feature in both. A quartz reef passes over the track
here ;it is marked by numerous bits of white quartz lying on the ground. Some picturesque large granite
rocks, half split up by frost, half worn by chemical disintegration, stand up between the gigantic gum-
trees. The stems of the dead trees have fallen and lean on these rocks—there they could not decay. From
the ground young trees, pine, box, and gum are growing up in abundance. Alpine flowers peep out here
and there ; the whole is pervaded by the cool, moist, and fresh mountain air—my poor friends in Sydney
now !
We follow a creek for some distance, a stream as clear as crystal and strong enough to turn a mill
flows along it; we turn off to the right and soon find a camping place in a locality termed “Boggy Plains.”
It froze during the night, and as we made a start in the morning of the 10th the horses’ hoofs jingled
against the broken ice of the small pools on the way. We passed a few of the bogs described above, and
crossed a few places covered with timber, slowly rising all the time until we reached the foot of “ Pretty
Point,” the raised north-eastern angle of the Kosciusco plateau. A good track leads up to the summit.
The view extends over an angle of about 120 degrees. It was a clear day, and I had an opportunity of
sketching the view. The scenery is very tame, neither in colour nor in shape is there anything grand in it,
but it is nevertheless very lovely. I must say for myself, however, that I found the sub-alpine gum-tree
forest much more worth seeing than anything else on the way.
We continued our ride for some time, and came, at a place called “Tom’s Flat,” to the first glacial
marks. We descended from thence in a westerly direction, and reached one of the tributaries of the Snowy
Fiver, which we followed up to its very source. I saw a few more glacier marks on the way. This ride
through the bogs is very dreary and uninteresting. Bad enough on a fine day, it must be a desolate
business riding there through mist and storm.
A little pass was crossed, and we descended into another flat valley, equally boggy and uninteresting}
and finally reached the camping place on the opposite slope, termed “Betts’s Camp,” We might easily have
proceeded a little further up towards our mountain, and I know, from old Alpine experience, that it is the
most important thing to get as near the peak you want to ascend as possible the day before. The others,
however, would not go on, and said, “ Here the others have camped, and we must camp here likewise.”
We camped there accordingly. The morning of Sunday the 11th saw us early astir, packing, and cooking
breakfast. High clouds consisting of ice crystals di’ew up from the south-east and looked threatening
enough. Old Spencer assured me there would be a change before the evening, and I had the same
apprehension; but to keep up the men’s courage, I affirmed that it would be fine—and fine it was for the
next three days.
At 5-50 a.m. we got off. It was cold, and I was very glad of my mittens. The range, on the
northern slope of which Betts’s Camp is situated, was traversed, and we followed a boggy flat without trees
to the foot of the hill to the westward, and ascended the slope to a pass named “Charlotte’s Pass.”
Descending on the other side, the river, one of the main sources of the Snowy, which I have termed
Townsend River, was reached at 7‘25 a.m.; we crossed, and commenced to ascend by the Townsend range.
Here there are no bogs, and the vegetation is like a soft velvet carpet. A few rocks were passed, and we
proceeded rapidly and in good spirits along the crest of the range. We were rising steadily, and after some
time we saw the mountains before us. lat once perceived that there was a large stone cairn on one of the
hills, and found out, on asking Spencer, that this was “Mount Kosciusco,” or Mueller’s Peak. We were
soon on the summit of the Townsend range, which is divided from the main range by a deep saddle. The
opposite incline of the main range seemed very steep, and the snow ribbon on our side of the ridge greatly
increased the difficulty of getting a horse up there.
Spencer was inclined to stop here in the saddle, and seemed displeased at my pushing on without
consideration for man or beast. The main range was surmounted, and I saw my way pretty well before me.
I led my horse through the rocks on it following a northerly course, and after some difficulty reached the
upper end of the Wilkinson Valley, rode up to the saddle, which I name “ Strzelecki’s Pass,” between
Mueller’s Peak and Mount Clarke, on the main range, left my horse there, and happy once again to have
snow and rocks below my feet, ran up to the summit in a few minutes. I reached it at 8'45 a.m., 2h.55 m.
from Betts’s Camp. The others were slowly coming after me, and reached the top at 9T5, half an hour later.


I commenced taking bearings as soon as I got there, and then started photographing the panorama
as soon as the others came up with the apparatus. The changing of plates is a highly inconvenient and
unpleasant process, and I was heartily glad when I had finished the photographing of a dozen views by 12T5
p.m. Already, when I first looked about, I thought a peak to the south was higher than that on which I
stood, and my conviction was confirmed when I used the spirit level.
The peak on which I stood is termed Mueller’s Peak by the people on the Snowy Piver side.
Besides the stone cairn there were many other signs of previous visits, names and dates fixed there in
various ways. The panorama is pretty, but there is no remarkable feature about it. We had a very clear
day, and could see mountains about 100 miles off. The sea is not visible from this mountain. One station,
Gijy, in the Murray valley, is the only visible sign of the existence of mankind below. The valleys appear
very desolate, without stock or huts. On the tops of a few near ridges there are rocks; the distant hills are
nearly all rounded. On Mount Hotham there was a good deal of snow, more, I think, than on our own hill ;
otherwise there was no snow visible in the distance. Because our hill lies in a south-westerly angle of the
main range, only the western slopes of the main range are visible to us, and they are destitute of snow.
Similar views to that from Mueller’s Peak can be got from any of the ordinary “ Sunday excursion
hills” in the eastern Alps of Europe. It cannot be compared to the scenery in New Zealand, let alone the
unparallelled grandeur of some of the scenery in the central part of the European Alps or Himalayas.
Mount Kosciusco itself would be high enough, but the hills one sees therefrom are too low.
As soon as I had found out that we were not on the highest point I determined to reach it. W e
left the summit at 2 p.m., and I carried the camera down in my arms to photograph the summit from any
suitable point. I wanted to make a glissade down one of the snowfields, one of the best amusements in
the European Alps; but I forgot my spurs, the result—the reader may depict for himself.
I photographed the summit from the saddle at the foot. We packed and rode down the Wilkinson
Valley. In this saddle there was a little lagoon, with remarkably warm water and swarming with insects,
worms, &c. It is surprising to find such an abundance of life in a lagoon frozen the greater part of the
year, and only 2 feet deep.
The Wilkinson Valley is wide and flat, and extends between the Abbott and Wilkinson Banges up to
the main range at Mueller’s Peak and Mount Clarke. We traversed the flat bottom of this valley in a
southerly direction. There I came upon some very fine glacier-polished rocks, which I photographed. We
continued our course until we were below Adams’ Pass, ascended the main range there, and rode up the
gentle incline towards the highest mountain. I rode a little in front of the others, nearly up to the very
top, left my horse there, walked up to the summit, and convinced myself with the aneroid and level that
we were higher than Mueller’s Peak, and higher than any other peak in sight likewise. I took some
sketches, whilst Cullen erected a stone cairn. Spencer, who had accompanied both Baron Mueller and
Townsend, said that they had not been on that particular peak, and as there were no traces of any previous
ascent to be found in the shape of a cairn, we assumed that we had made the first ascent of the highest
mountain in Australia. When the cairn was finished, and also our Burgundy, I put a note concerning our
first ascent in the empty bottle, and fixed it reversed in the top of the cairn. I thought it as well to leave
a record of our ascent, for fear of anybody annexing the mountain hereafter.
We had reached the summit at 3.45, and left at 4.45. The view is similar to that from Mueller’s
Peak, but prettier, because one sees the rocky pyramid of the latter hill from here just opposite the
Wilkinson Valley, and it looks very well. Between the summit and Adams’ Pass there is on the eastern
slope a remarkable S-shaped snow field by which the highest peak, which I have named Mount Townsend,
can easily be recognized.
We rode down towards Adams’ Pass for a short time, then turned to the right, and traversed the
northern slopes to Ramshead Pass, followed the Ramshead Range and reached, happy and contented, Betts’s
Camp at 7.15 p.m.
The next day we returned to Spencer’s Station. We did not follow the same route as on Saturday, but
kept out of the bogs on the eastern boundary range. I photographed a glimpse of Mount Kosciusco from
a place called by Spencer “ Prussian Elat.” The scrub which had to be passed through afforded in two
places a slight obstacle to the packhorses, but otherwise this route is much to be preferred to the other
through the bogs in the valley.
At Tom’s Elat the old track was reached, readings taken at Pretty Point and Boggy Plains, and
at 3.30 p.m. we arrived at Spencer’s Station. The next day Mr. Spencer took us to Cooma. We were
caught on the way by a terrific thunderstorm, and nearly swept away by a waterspout. As the hail dashed
against our hats, and the increasing sound of thunder rebounded from the hill sides around, I felt perfectly
happy. The pleasant feelings which a thunderstorm always awakens within me were much increased by
the thought of what our snug camp on Kosciusco would be like now. List

EXPLANATION OF PLATES.
Plate I —Title-page.—View to the west-south-west, about 36° wide, from a point on the range dividing the
Kosciusco plateau from the Crackenback, locally termed “Prussian Flat,” reproduced from a photograph
taken by the author. The point lies 6,017 feet above sea-level. A part of the Kosciusco plateau is
visible. The principal peaks of the group appear against the horizon. Mueller’s Peak, the rocky point
with stone cairn generally ascended by visitors, to the right looking over part of the main range. Mount
Townsend, the culminating point of Australia, the “ Ramshead” in Townsend’s map, to the left; a
round inconspicuous rise in the ground with a very characteristic serpent-shaped snowfield to the right.
The photograph was taken on January 12th, 1885, and will convey an idea of the amount of
snow on the mountains at that date. Scale : radius, 194 inches.
Plate ll. —Panorama of Mount Kosciusco. The rocky peak usually visited, with stone cairn, locally
termed “Mueller’s Peak,” 7,171 feet above sea-level.
This panorama has been compiled from thirty-six prismatic compass bearings, twelve photographs
taken by the author, and several sketches. Some parts of it are, as far as the drawing is concerned,
not so correct as others, as the distant view was not defined on some of the plates. Scale: radius,
6'4 inches.
Plate lll.—Sketch Map of the Kosciusco Group. Scale, given on the plate. The main range is copied
from Townsend’s oi’iginal map. A few slight alterations are made in the part I visited. The rivers
and tributary ranges close under the main range have been partly sketched in by me. This part of the
map is original, as the few details put down by Townsend are incorrect.
The Crackenback River has been copied from the county map of W allace, but had to be placed
(the middle part) about 1 mile to the eastward, so as to correspond with Townsend’s traverse and my
own observations. The names adopted are partly local and partly new. The only mountain name
which appears in the previously published Government county maps is Mount Kosciusco, applied to a
peak, which is not the highest, and is locally called Mueller’s Peak. The name Mount Kosciusco
means the whole group, and not a definite point, and has been used by me in this sense.
Plate IV.—Map of Mount Kosciusco. Scale, 2 inches to a mile. The positions of Mueller’s Peak and
Mount Townsend are identical with those on Townsend’s original map. The Clarke River and the
northernmost source of the Snowy have been copied from Townsend’s map. The names are explained
above. The configuration of the country was obtained by the combined use of a prismatic compass,
photographs, and sketches ; consequently the map cannot pretend to a very high degree of accuracy ; it
will suffice however for the purpose of identifying the peaks and of illustrating the description.
Plate V. —A glacier-polished gi’anite rock at Tom’s Flat, 5,800 feet above the sea, on the easterxx
boxxndary range, about a mile east of Pretty Poixxt. On the ordixxary route up Mount Kosciusko from
J "West Poixxt this rock is the first roche moutonnee which is passed. Reproduced mechanically from
a photograph taken by the author. The trees are stunted gums.
Plate Vl. —The camping place kxxowxx as Betts’s Camp, showixxg a remarkable mitre-shaped granite rock,
split up along the joixxts by frost, axxd rouxxded off at the edges afterwards by chemical erosion.
