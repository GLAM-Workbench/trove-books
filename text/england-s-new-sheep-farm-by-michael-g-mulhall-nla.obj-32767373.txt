ENGLAND'S NEW SHEEP-FARM.
The energy and success of the New Zealand
colonists could not be more strikingly displayed
than in the fact that they have sent the first cargo
of frozen sheep to (Treat Britain, a cargo of 5000
animals in such admirable condition as to make
the Leadenhall butchers open their eyes in astonish-
ment. How opportune is this new source of
supply appears from the quotation last week of
Is. Id. per lb. wholesale for Scotch meat, a price
unprecedented except in times of famine. Indeed,
we have been gradually approaching a state of
things, as regards meat, similar to the bread-crisis
when Cobden began his anti-Corn-law agitation.
Our own meat-crop at present hardly feeds our
population for months in the year; and as we
draw from the United States nearly 2000 tons
daily, we are in great measure dependent on a
country whose population is increasing with a
rapidity to warrant the anticipation that by the
close of the nineteenth century she will require her
own flocks and herds to feed her people. Even


at present the United States have fewer sheep to
population than in the United Kingdom.
There are, happily, many other countries now
entering the lists as meat-producers on a large
scale, all of which will find ready markets not
only here but also on the Continent, since France,
Germany, and Belgium have to import 420,000
tons of meat per annum. None of the new
countries of the southern hemisphere can produce
meat to equal that which has just arrived from
New Zealand, the cost of which delivered in
London is little over s d. per lb. Thanks to the
march of science, the squatters of Otago and of
Canterbury Plains can send their sheep to the
London market with greater ease than could the
farmers of the Tweed 100 years ago, when meat
was selling at a penny a pound in Scotland and
tenpence in London.
Under these circumstances, let us proceed to
consider —Ist, the meat question in Great Britain ;
2ndly, the prospects of New Zealand in this regard.
I.—Our Population and Meat-Supply.
The normal increase of population in the United
Kingdom, in spite of emigration, is about 1000
souls daily ; but there is no increase in the live
stock that is to give our crop of meat. Thus it has
come to pass that an interval of fourteen years, since
1868, has added five millions to our population,
while the number of food cattle of all kinds has


fallen seven millions. The following table explains
the position as regards inhabitants and cattle : —

There is no reason to suppose that the next four
teen years will not prove equally prosperous
British manufactures and commerce, in which case
the increase of population and the consumption of
meat will go on as in the interval since 1868.
Hence we may expect in 1896 to have a population
of 42 or 43 millions, and to produce only as much
meat as will feed our inhabitants for five months
in the year. Our importation will then exceed a
million tons of meat yearly, the bulk of which must
necessarily come from the Australian colonies.
Some people, who believe in the delusive theory
of prices, argue that the consumption of meat per
inhabitant must decline in this country as the
price advances. It is sufficient to observe that the
price has never been higher than at present, nor
the consumption greater. The increase of wealth
in Great Britain in the last ten or'fifteen years has
been prodigious, and this has much more influence
than price on the consumption. It is by no means
unlikely that ten years hence we shall have to pay
to


tne average consumption in the United Kingdom
per inhabitant.

Thus during more than forty years the rise in
price has
gone hand-in-hand with an increase of
18d. per pound for beef or mutton, and that the con-
sumption per inhabitant will be even higher than
to-day. Let us pause for a moment to compare the
prices in past years (at Leadenhall Market) with
the average consumption in the United Kingdom
per inhabitant.
Thus during more than forty years the rise in
pi ice has gone hand-in-hand with an increase of
consumption, these two items acting and re-acting
on each other as cause and effect. It is manifest
that if our population were to consume to-day no
more per head than it did forty years ago, the
price would be lower. So far, therefore, from
high price denoting a decreased consumption, we
may be sure that it will be the reverse. This may
be some comfort to the British farmer, who will
always command the highest prices for beef and
mutton in the London market.
It is just 200 years since Vauban, the great
military engineer, observed that nations consume
meat in proportion to their wealth; and the
income-tax returns of the United Kingdom in the


last thirty years bear out this statement (the income
of Ireland being estimated at 18 millions for 1850),
viz.: —
Meat per Inhabitant.

Here we see that the relative consumption has
kept pace with the increase of wealth, the rise
being about 60 per cent, in each. And if we
extend our view to other countries we shall find
the same rule to be very general in its application,
France and Germany consuming more meat per
inhabitant than the poorer countries of Southern or
Eastern Europe. It is unnecessary to give long
tables of statistics on the consumption in the
various countries; those of most importance will
be found in the Appendix.
Before concluding this section, I may be per-
mitted to show the growth of home and foreign
supply in forty years.

There is indeed a slia
rht increase of Enadi
sh meat
Ihere is indeed a slight increase of English meat
in the last twenty years, consequent on the decline
of grain-farms, but we have no reason to expect that
the United Kingdom can ever produce more than
1,100,000 tons. It is said already by the Leaden-
hall butchers that the farmers are encroaching on
the procreative power of their flocks, by killing too
many animals before maturity, and thus weakening
the stamina of so valuable an industry. “If you
want to eat four-year-old mutton,” said one, “you
must not expect to find it in our market, but only
on the tables of the Duke of Richmond or other
great landed proprietors.”
At such a time the frozen sheep from New
Zealand come most opportunely, not to injure the
British farmer, but to relieve the great pressure
that would otherwise kill off a large portion of our
sheep before maturity. It is quite possible, as the
Duke of St. Albans fears, that New Zealand mutton

will be sold in our markets for English, nor could
there be higher testimony of the superior quality
and condition of the meat now imported from the
Antipodes. What a strange result of the industry
and enterprise of a handful of Scotch and English
settlers, that the country which a few years ago
was noted for cannibalism, and where so many
missionaries and shipwrecked sailors were devoured,
should now be in a position to send us at least
a million frozen sheep yearly to feed our ever-
increasing population!
II. —Sheep-farming in New Zealand.
Twenty years ago New Zealand had fewer sheep
than Lincolnshire, and twenty years hence she will
have more than Great Britain, if the flocks increase
even slowly. The rapidity of growth at the
outset was marvellous, as shown in the official
returns: —
Not only have the flocks multiplied ninefold in
twenty-one years, but the weight of fleece has
doubled, and the export of wool'now averages ss.
per sheep. This is 2d. over the general average
for Australian fleeces ; but the great superiority of
New Zealand sheep is in weight of carcass, some of

The above shows very clearly that New Zealand
the “ frozen flock ” landed last week ranging from
140 to 165 lbs.
If we compare the yield of wool and meat of
New Zealand sheep with those of other sheep-
growing countries, we find the result as
follows:
The above shows very clearly that New Zealand
possesses great advantages over all her competi-
tors, which explains in a measure the importance
that the squatters in that colony have attained in a
few years, some of them possessing fortunes equal
to those of Brazilian coffee-planters. The Campbell
sheep-farm at Otago was sold, in 1881, for the
enormous sum of 480,000/., after it had given for
some years a net profit of 53,000/. per annum.
Such is in fact the flourishing condition of the
colony, that the increment of wealth in twelve years
(represented by railways, sheep, houses, lands)
between 1868 and 1880 amounted to 26 millions
sterling, the public debt likewise increasing
18 millions in the interval. Although the total
population is less than that of Somersetshire, their

banking business exceeds 50 millions per annum,
and the deposits in bank average 8 millions.
If the business of sending home “ frozen sheep,”
now so auspiciously begun, be followed up with
like success, the colonists can, without reducing
their stock or infringing on its procreative power,
send us about 100,000 sheep monthly—say 30,000
tons of meat per annum, or 5 per cent, of the
deficit that Great Britain must cover by importa-
tion from abroad. The capacity of New Zealand
for sheep-raising is apparently eight times greater
than the actual amount of its flocks, or area
occupied.
There are but four districts (out of the nine
which compose the colony) in which sheep-farming
is carried on to any great extent, viz. :
In the above districts about two million acres are
held in fee, and the squatters’-runs cover an area of
14 million acres, rented at 2 d. per acre. The
revenue which the Government derives from lands
has for some years averaged 350,000/., of which
one-third from squatters, the rest- from the sale of
lands to settlers. In many parts the farmers have
sown English grasses, the result surpassing all ex-


pectation, as the climate is peculiarly suited. The
hay crop averages 50 cwt. per acre, being nearer
to the Prussian than the English average, the latter
not exceeding 47 cwt. The colony has, besides
sheep, no fewer than 580,000 cows and 140,000
horses. Public lands not yet sold or let to squatters
amount to 52 million acres, which is almost equal
to the extent of the island of Great Britain; but
this includes 22 million acres that are of little or
no value. There is still available for sheep-farming,
or agriculture, and undisposed of, an area about the
size of Ireland. What the colony most invites is
that class of English farmers with some capital who
have been in late years emigrating to Texas and
Virginia, and perhaps meeting with less success
than if they had tried their fortunes in the Britain
of the southern hemisphere.
