VIENNA UNIVERSAL EXHIBITION !
FIRST PRIZE,
THE GRAND MEDAL OE PEOGEESS
Has been awarded to
The SINGER COMPANY
For the unqualified excellence of the
Singer Sewing Machines,
AND THE GRAND MEDAL OE MERIT
FOR THE BEST SPECIMENS OF SEWING DONE:
In addition to these, the Company have also received THREE MEDALS for
their Employees for the superior workmanship and perfection of tne Com-
pany’s Manufactures.
The above important additions to the already unprecedented LIST OF
AWARDS to the SINGER MACHINES have been still further augmented
within the past month, by the Awards of the FIRST PRIZE in each of the
following contests —
24th July—At the Blackburn Agricultural Soc iety’s Show at Black-
burn —The Silver Medal.
Ist August—At the Preston Agricultural Society’s Show at Preston—
The Silver Cup, value 20 guineas, and The Silver Medal.
sth August—At the Hereford Agricultural Society’s Show at Hereford
—The Silver Cup, and
6th August —At the Ormskirk Agricultural Society’s Show at
Ormskirk—The Gold Medal.
At Preston the contest wa» most severe and created much excitement On that
occasion the SPECIAL PRIZE the SILVER CUP VALUE 20 GUINEAS, was
presented by the ladies of Preston “to the Maker of the best Family Sewing
Machine,” and a Hecond Prize, the SILVER MEDAL, “ for the best Machine for
heavy work.” To get a wider and more general opinion, a Committee of ladies
wa3 appointed to assist the Judges, and the s imples of work were submitted to
this Committee without anything to indicate by which Machine they were done.
After a most eareful examination of these samples and the Mach nes, both the
Committee of Ladies and the Judges unhesitatingly awarded the TWO PRIZES,
as above, to the SINGER MACHINES. It is worthy of note that the ladies acting
upon the Committee use machines of other makers.
Thus in open competition with all the world and under the
severest tests, THE SINGER MACHINES have won Trophies un-
equalled in value and number, and the Singer Company maintain their
high position as manufacturers of the best in the world.

Baler King Winter. They all bow.
King W Cease sycophantic fools, I’m sick of antic,
And your loud bawling drives me nearly frantic.
Snow Your Majesty, your Snowdrops meant no barm.
King W No, but showbawling always makes me warm,
The cold I love, but in the sunshine’s beams,
Ice melts, I shrieks, I shudders, and ice creams !
And soon like fortune by a rake run through,
Melt and resolve myself into a Jew (dew).
Hurr ’Tis far too warm already. This December!
King W Ah, but, we’re in Victoria remember.
That undecided country where I’m told
The very winds sometimes blow hot and cold,
And little stars, instead of darkly sinking,
Keep peeping out and ogling one like winking.
Snow Winking ! when they should patterns be of coldness.
King. W I am astonished at their precious boldness.
Let us concoct my cold yet trusty court
A winter of the real old English sort,
That every kind of vegetation checks.

Rad Diana! Queen of Night!
Diana There’s nothing mars
Your welcome kind, for which I thank my stars.
Of trouble, though, your Queen must be a hmter ;
From information I’ve received, King Winter
Accuses us of winicing !
Twin Well lie might!
’Twould be no wonder, Queen ; for every night,
Upon this wicked world we see, I think,
So much at which we are compelled to wink.
Diana He threatens to enveil us with his clouds,
That we no more may light the wand’ring crowds,
So Sirius shall be our starry watch-dog.
Twin He’s a slcy tarrier, though scarce a Scotch dog!
You may rely on him, we’re always finding
His low is perfect, and his ivow is binding.
Diana To earth he courses —
Not in winter’s fog days !
Diana Oh, yes, these coursing times are truly dog days
Each dog his day, so Sirius, beware,
This trip you’ll find a Sirius affair.

But if you love, the boon can’t be recanted,
And so farewell, beware avenging Nemesis !
You, Radianta, see her off the premises.

Free Baths the flowing Yarra make more sweet,
And still more churches rise in Collms-street!

While broken busses strewed the Richmond Eoad.
Our Bowen’s mansion leaps from Mueller s lawns
And Bagot’s cowshed Flemington adorns ;
On all sides buildings upon buildings rise
E’en Hosie builds a palace upon pies.
Ten thousand nameless places start to fame
But that big barn in Bourke-street still the same.
Parliament Houses! There, alas, ’tis true
’Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,

For here’s my faithful Radianta coming.
Enter Radianta.
So here I leave you for an earthly far land.

Hame Come, stop that noise! Alas, my poor old shoe!
I put my foot in it one day *tis true.
Made by my family of sons and daughters,
To cut my stick into still larger quarters.
The shoe was much too small by several inches—
Ah, folks soon find out now where the shoe pinches.
Fled are the days when sweets I used to cram,
And find some pumpkins in colonial jam.
Now everything is such an awful price,
Nice things are dear, and, what ain’t dear, ain’t nice.
Of every kind of meat we’ve had a cut on,
Wether , ewe liked, or no Australian mutton;
Ritchie’s preserves we tried. Be rich he ought,
For his stuff’s dearer than the other sort.
The frozen meat of Harrison—well there,
That turned out a most harrassing affair.
We’ve tried Glu-ene, Pepsine, Colonial porter,
We’ve bust our buttons off with Daylesford water,
The Fragrant Floriline is flagrant folly,
And Glollah’s Indian remedy—Oh, golly!
We’ve eaten everything! old coir rope,
Cod liver oil, sardines, carbolic soap,
Kruse’s Insecticide, old hoots, old hats,
Pickles, boiled billy goats, and native cats—
Tried everything to cheapen food, but, 10,
The more we eat, the higher prices go.

Tom Is that the welcome that you give your Tommy ?
Dame Where have you been ? did you not hear me call ?
Tom Been singing for my supper at th’ Apollo Hall,
Wobbling at eve, like gallant gay Susini,
And Coyly playing with my Tamburini.
The dandy Dondi, from his eagle’s erie,
Stooped to mine ear, in fact, ’twas quite Tournerie :
When he sings for his supper, each one dotes
On what he can do with his supper notes.
Here, share it little ones. [ Children crowd up.
Dame Don’t make no noise—
I thought I’d have to starve them girls and boys.
They would have died, my Tom, had I not met-ee.
They’ve been, and raised the price of beef!
(Gives them food.)
Tom That’s Petty !
Enjoy yourselves, for these are children's jolly days.
This holly makes it look like Christmas Aoh-days.
Dick It’s Christmas Eve!
Tom The fact my memory lost—
Well, hang your stockings up dears, for Jack Frost.
Dame Jack Frost, indeed! pray let’s have no such flummery—
The process of Australian tvintex's summary.
Tom Yet, why from wintry climes should not this chap land ?
Our fairy tales were told us first in lap-land !
Dame Oh, rubbish! don’t put nonsense in their heads—
They’ve had their suppers, let them to their beds.
Tom Meanwhile, to gaze upon the stars I’ll go,
My pretty evening star I’ll see. You know!
I madly .own, my guiding star.
Last night when gazing on her from afar,
Her shadow kissed me, but ere I could speak—
Dame Kissed by a shudder, sh'ad a deal of cheek.
Tom Ere I could try the mystery to unravel
She disappeared—

That up to skyland I would wing my course.
Jack {Laughs) Excuse my laughing, ’tis no breach of suavity.
Tom True, my remark upsets the laws of gravity.
Jack I promise you my aid, where was she lost ?
Tom I really cannot tell you, Mr. Frost ;
For everywhere I’ve searched, at Balls and Baces,
At Picnics, Fetes, and fifty other places,
Done Collins-street until my poor brain whirls,
Bewildered by the lovely Melbourne girls.

Nor wander o’er the sea,
I’m quite intent to stop at home —
Australia’s girls for me.
(Both) Beautiful girls, young Melbourne girls.
Saucy, teazing, pouting girls,
I love one and all, both short and tall,
Beautiful Collins-street girls!
Jack At balls, at races, meets and fetes
The litttle darlings shine,
But in the crowd in vain you’d look
For her whom I call mine.

Will do the usual Parliamentary soap—
Snow About oir many virtues mildly crowin ,
King W I’ll try to be as courteous as Bowen.
My friends! the Session’s over as you know,
And gives me opportunity to How.
’Tis now some twelve months since—at Hoey huffy,
The conscientious Erancis turned out Duffy ;
And ere we meet again I fear the chance is,
Some other virtuous man will turn out Erancis.
And then with Duffy, Francis joined will be,
United both to turn out Number Three,
Who, having governed us six months or more,
Will in his turn give place to Number Four.
So that each man, by constant permutation,
May learn the art of governing the nation.
This is, my friend, forgive me if I say it,
The game of Legislation as we play it.
■All Hear ! hear !
King W A backward glance now let us cast,
And see how much we’ve gained in Session past.

And, the Police Act having then amended,
Drew salary and thought the Session ended.
And so the Council proved it without doubt,
For all that one threw in, the rest threw out.

The Upper House the measure quick rejected.
The Savings Banks Reserves came Langton pat upon
The Council instantly the measure sat upon.
Then came a question all their wrath to rouse
Pray how can we reform this Upper Souse ?
They didn’t answer, but some folks doubt whether
Next year shan’t reform it altogether.

When with such tops their trousers they do rend,
Their tops ain’t what I whip you may depend,
A weary way I’ve wandered from my home,
Compelled each week a marketing to roam,
For each commodity grows scarcer still,
As works this beautiful Permissive Bill,
They’ve cut off brandy, whisky, ale and porter,
They’ve done their hardest to cut off the water,
And from all stimulants but sun and rain,
We soon shall have to totally abstain.
Song, Dame—Air, “ I’m on the Teetotal .”
[Hopwood and Crew, London.]
Now all good people, ’tend I pray, attention most intense,
In me you see a shining light of Total Abstinence ;
I’ve lead a very wicked life, for nights and days been ill
But now I am reformed by that bless’d Permissive Bill.
SpoJcen —Oh, the Permissive Bill! Blessings on
Casey’s head for it. It has ruined all the licensed
victuallers in the colony, and you can’t get a glass
of brandy and water to save your precious soul!
Thank goodness I’m a G-ood Templar, and can always
get a drop on the quiet. (Produces bottle and drinks )
Teetotal Cordial! Only ninety per cent, of proof
spirit.
I’m on the teetotal, &c.
In early childhood I began, aud with my A. B. C.
I drank Colonial beer and took to brandy in my tea,
With whisky hot my brains I fogged, and that is why I
think
I’ve grown a brainless enemy to every kind of drink.
Spoken —lt is not sufficient for me, as a supporter of
the Permissive Bill, to be a teetotaller myself. Oh
no, I must make everybody else teetotallers whether
they like it or not. That’s the principle. I'm such
a brainless booby that I can’t take a glass of grog
without getting drunk, and therefore I shan’t allow
you to drink anything stronger than water. Oh its
a most free and liberal measure, so come
Let’s all go on the teetotal.
Your worst rogue makes your holiest saint, aud that’s
the reason clear
I’m down upon the moderate man whom I catch sipping
beer,
I call him names and if I can’t convince by argument,
I liberally stop his grog by Act of Parliament.

Spoken —When I got sober first the delicious trembles
came on a hundred times worse and I shook like a dish
of jelly with the palsy. “Ease it off gently,” says
Casey. “ Don’t be rash. Take your whack like me
A gallon and half of Colonial wine in the morning,
and your Irish hot at lunch, and your bottle
of port at dinner, and your boiled brandy and cayenne
at bed time. Only be moderate.” Oh, he has a
great intellect has Casey. Here’s luck to him ( drinks )
For I’m on the teetotal.

Diana The winter palace now is melted quite,
Razed with the earth by Phoebus rays so bright;
And all my stars triumphant once again

I wonder what’s become of Twinkle, Twinkle,
Of that sweet belie I have not beard a tinkle.
Oh, Twinkle Twinkle, naughty little star,
I really sadly wonder where you are!
Enter Radianta.
Rad The Emperor is on our Twinkle’s track.
Diana What, ho! my stars !

Air, from “ Princess of 7 rebizonde.”
[Published by Boosey & Co., London.]
O’er this maid, once so cold hearted,
One fine morn a change there came,
Through our Twinkle’s bosom darted
Cupid’s dart, with fatal aim.
Eor in her highness
Slave of shyness,
A mortal boy
Has raised love’s joy.
But also to her,
Came to woo her,

Twin. It makes a handsome girdle
Tom Gird along !
I needs but this to fill our cup of bliss (kiss).
Twin Good gracious! What’s that?
Tom. That my dear’s a kiss!
Twin The stars can’t do so.
Tom Can’t they? Well, then, aren’t it
Astonishing to find how soon you larnt it ?
It’s very easy though.
Twin So I was guessing
Tom Suppose I give you just another lesson ?
Duet — Air —‘‘ The Kiss behind the Door.”

Tom There is a little joy that I would oft be missing,
Eor it is one that rich and poor will equally entice,
And here upon the earth it is known by name of kissing.

kissing nice ?
Tom It’s a jolly sort of telegraph, that goes from heart to heart j
Its electric bliss all concentrated in a pressure smart;
It’s a pleasant salutation when you meet or when you part.
Oh, isn’t kissing nice!
Both It’s a jolly sort of telegraph, &c.
Tom It’s very easy now, when you’ve once made a beginning,

Never play more —upon this festive stage.

Tom Oh, short lived happiness my darling’s fled,
But where is the place to which the Monarch said
He’d have her brought ? I’ll follow on his track
To find my little star and bring her back,
Shine out fair moon and guide my wandering way,
You are a friend to lovers all folks say,
I know myself that for a quiet talk
Naught’s half so jolly as a moonlight walk.
Song—Tom.—“ The Moonlight Walk."
One night alone I took a stroll,
To view the lovely scenes,
And read the stars as some folks say,
Altho’ I scarce know what that means.
But down the lane and through the wood,
I’d not gone very far,
When twinkling on my moonlit walk
I saw my little star.
Oh, there’s nothing half so jolly as a moonlight walk, &e.

Dame Refer your quarrel, Tom, to' arbitration.
Tom No, thank you, that might prove my ruination.
Dame Or, the entanglement, to make more mazy,
Suppose we each refer the case to Casey.
Emp And for the cleverness displayed by he,
Perhaps they’ll make our Casey K.C.B.
Dame Let them go home with me ?
Emp Oh, no, you don’t;
I’ll see them further first, and then I won’t.
Come on! my castle’s near.
Twin Then we are lost!
Tom Oh, if we could would see my friend Jack Frost.
Enter Jack.
Jack I’m just in time as usual.
Tom Yes, good Jack
Like some French songs you go being of’en back.
Emp Young sir, your manner is intensely freezing,
His breath is always cool about this seasing.
Twin Our sorrows turned to feeling of delight,
Emp Where is King Winter ? He’ll soon put you right.
Enter King Winteb.
King W I’m here!
J a °k What, dad ?
King W What means this conduct, boy P


Jack I only meant to give two lovers joy.
King W Give me the spear ! You, Emperor, claim your bride,
And come with me—l’ll never be defied !
Enter Diana.
Diana Nor yet will I !
Emp Oh, full’s my bitter cup!
I’ll settle down.
om You’d better settle up !
Diana Now to my fairy bowers, I you invite
Emp I know to play the clown there all the night.
Twin Oh, good Diana —I am still befriended
By you at all events!
j)i ana Your troubles ended ;
A faithful lover waits to claim your hand ;
And happiness is yours, by our command.
Tom One other boon my happiness secures,
I’ve won her hand and I would now win yours.
Ring W Let me advise —
j)j ana Of him don’t be a heeder,
But let me act the part of special pleader.
Jack I’m glad that I his little game oft cross’t,
If I’ve won favour, then do please Jack Frost.
Twin For Tom I ask your smiles, and he’ll reflect them
Into my eyes —so mind you, I expect them.
Diana It rests with you. If you say we’re done right
Our little star mlVjwinkle ev’ry night!
Finale.
Aii —“ Valentine .”
Diana Midst winter’s cold severity,
To Tom wish all prosperity.
T om For she I love this day is mine
ip w i n And thus we end our Pantomime.
Chorus— Diana, Jack, Tom, Twinkle.
Our Pantomime ! our Pantomime!
Our Royal—our Chr stmas Pantomime !
Chorus ommes Oh, sing we now right cheerily,
And dance we now right merrily,
For now is merry Christmas time,
So come and see our Pantomime!
