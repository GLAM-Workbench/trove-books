My father was born in November, 1752, I believe at
Great Bentley, Essex. He was the youngest son
of Joseph Dawson ; he had one brother and two sisters.
My grandfather was also the son of a Joseph Dawson ; he
had four brothers and, I think, three sisters. His father
(my grandfather’s father) died without a will; he might
have inherited all the property —he did not —he divided it
among his brothers and sisters. My grandfather’s grand-
father was the first Dawson that came to Bentley. He
came from Suffolk, and his wife was a Miss Burton, from
Cheshire, and I believe the Suffolk Dawsons came origin-
ally from Yorkshire. My father had one brother and two
sisters. My uncle was the eldest; his name was Joseph;
he had bright sparkling black eyes and curly hair and a
handsome face, and very stout—the only fat member of
the family -he was a dreadful teaze. He was married ;
he had four daughters, Mrs. Samuda was the eldest. The
two sons were married and died without children. My
father’s eldest sister married Mr. John Kiddell. and the
De Montmorencies are their grandchildren. My father
was of middle height, a handsome man, and strikingly like
the Duke of Wellington. We had a good portrait of the
Duke; the likeness is very apparent. His friends, when
they met him in London after an absence of some months,
would say: “ Why, you grow more like the Duke every
time I see you.’’ Soldiers used to salute him sometimes.


My father was married about 1810 or 1811. My
mother’s name was Taylor. You have an account of her
family. They lived at Bentley Lodge, Great Bentley,
until the year 1821, when he left Essex and went to
Berkshire to manage Lord Barrington’s Estate. Becket
was the name of the place and Shrivenham the name of
the railage. We lived in the old mansion, in which there
were rooms sixteen feet high and large in proportion.
There were beautiful shrubberies, a long water walk, two
islands in the broad part of the water, and beautiful swans
that used to follow us when we were in the boat, and
sometimes they would have a brood of cygnets following
them. P’aringdon was our post town, and a boy on a
donkey used to come every morning with the post bag,
which was locked, and return with it in the afternoon. It
was about four miles to Faringdon. From the lawn there
was a lovely view of the White Horse. Oh ! it was a
charming place.
On the White Horse hills there was a Roman and a
Danish encampment, and also not far from them was
Wayland Smith’s Cave; you will read about that in
Kenilworth. In the summer holidays we used to have
delightful picnics at these places. When peace was
declared it ruined the farmers, so my father had to give
up farming like many others, and left Essex and came to
lovely Becket. He remained at Becket until 1825, when
he left to go to Australia, as he was appointed chief agent
to the Australian Agricultural Company. He sailed on


June 24th, 1825, in tbs York , having under his charge 40
individuals (men, women and children), whom he had
selected for various duties ; also three hundred and twenty
three sheep, nine head of horned cattle, and a choice
collection of British and other plants selected for cultiva-
tion. My cousin, John Dawson, was appointed my
father’s assistant. He sailed in the Brothers, and had
also forty individuals in his charge, between three and
four hundred sheep, three head of horned cattle and seven
horses. They reached Sydney on the 24th November,
1825, after a favourable voyage of twenty-three weeks.
John Dawson was a young man for such a charge;
he was only eighteen, but he was clever and reliable.
Fourteen days spent at Rio were included in the twenty-
three weeks. The losses in both ships during the voyage
amounted to no more than eighteen sheep, and the
remainder were landed in better condition than when
they were put on board at Cowes.
My father was the first chief agent for the Company.
He would have now been called manager, I suppose. He
was badly treated by this Company, who listened to evil
reports made by members of a Committee who were not
upright. It caused my father’s return to England, where
he hoped to obtain redress, but failed in so doing. This
embittered the remainder of his life, for he could not
recover from the injustice of the proceedings. He was
succeeded in the management by Sir Edward Parry, the
Arctic explorer. Unfortunately, when my father came out


here he had no agreement with the Company, so his
services could he dispensed with at any moment. He
consulted his friends about it. They told him they were
sure he did not need one, he had to deal with an honorable
set of men, some of them Members of Parliament; but
this was bad advice, as it proved to be. My father had
an interview with Sir Edward told him his experience,
and recommended him to have an agreement. He said
he certainly should. He engaged for five years, and, I
believe, a pension. I believe I am quite correct in stating
this, so he was safe; If you read his book again, I think
you will see what an amount of business he had to
transact.
After returning to England he obtained the manage-
ment of F.ord Dartmouth’s Estates, in Warwickshire,
Buckinghamshire, and also some London property. He
remained there for about seven years, and then came out
to this country again. He brought stock out with him,
but it was not a successful venture, many of them died.
My mother died in 1835, and before my father left
England he married again. He sailed from England on
September 22nd, 1838, and landed here on January 25th,
1839. This marriage was not a very happy one. When
he was about 80 years of age—in 1862 I think—he returned
to England, where he remained till he died in 1866, and
where he ended his chequered life in comfort.
His early days were passed in stirring times. Within
a few miles of Bentley, Wheeley Barracks were erected for


10,000 men; this was at the time when Napoleon’s
invasion was expected. My father was Captain of a
Militia Corps, and the village tailor was the Lieutenant,
and a very good one too. I have heard my father say on
one occasion, when his regiment was reviewed he was
complimented by the Commander-in-Chief for the
efficiency of his Corps. Two of his best friends were
officers in the army, and both were at the battle of
Waterloo Dr. Beattie and Captain Christie, both Scotch-
men. When he went to live at Becket, in Berkshire,
these two friends took a cottage in the village and lived
there too as long as he was there. He had so many
amusing anecdotes about his younger days, and the people
of all ranks that he had known, and the habits of the
times. He was an abstemious man. When he was young
it was the custom at dinner parties for every one to
become intoxicated and to find themselves under the
table. He was dining on one occasion among many
others, he had on Wellington boots, I expect they were
the very high ones that came over the knees. However,
he determined not to take more wine, so he quietly
poured it into his boots. This happened once or twice ;
at last some one noticed it, and drew attention to it, and
he was told it was against the rules, that he must drink or
leave the room. He got up and said he would leave, he
could not drink to make a .... of himself. They would
not let him leave and said he should do as he liked
always.


My father was a man of ability and of general
information. His favourite study was geology, and
through this taste he was the means of enriching the Earl
of Dartmouth to a very great extent. The Earl had large
coal mines on his estate, and my father became
persuaded that there were still greater riches for him under
the earth if he would seek for them under the new red
sandstone. Coal had never been found there. Why?
Because the new •. 1 sandstone in a convulsion of nature
had been thrown upon the old red sandstone, under which
was the coal. From what he observed, my father felt sure
that coal was under this formation and other slighter
formations which lay upon the old red sandstone, under
which was the coal. The sinking, of course, would he
much deeper, because you must first get through the new
red sandstone. After some difficulty and much persuasion,
my father induced the Earl to sink a shaft. The sinking
went on well and quietly, but at last the geologists —
among them Sir Roger Murchison heard of this new
idea, and came to Sandwell, Lord Dartmouth’s residence
near Birmingham, and upon which property his then coal
mines were. They inspected the works being carried on,
and discouraged the whole business, and expressed their
disbelief about finding of coal under that formation. My
father, of course, saw them, and conversed with them,
and kept his own opinion. This was an unpleasant
audience for him to be confronted in opposition with this
great geologist, and feeling that Lord Dartmouth’s


confidence would he shaken. If so, lie did not show it;
he behaved manfully. Fortunately he was a rich man
and could stand the expense. Much to my father’s
gratification, he avowed his intention of continuing
the sinking to the necessary point. At last coal was found,
and good coal. I believe the sinking was the deepest in
England at the time— 900 feet. I think my father had
plans made of the pits, and presented a set to the Sydney
Museum. I have seen them there, but the last time I was
there they were not to be seen ; they had been removed.
This was many years ago. While the shafts were being
sunk you may imagine how intense his anxiety and
interest must have been, and when the first piece of coal
was presented to him what a relief it must have been to
see the fulfilment of his conviction. He never boasted
about this successful termination of his firm opinion.
Many a man would have done so, but he was a modest
man, and a kind hearted man, always ready to help when
help was wanted, and that it was in his power to render it.
Lord Dartmouth was not a liberal though a good
man. Through these new coal mines his riches were
wonderfully increased, and it was not unbecoming under
these circumstances to suppose that he would have made
the originator of this wealth a handsome present. He did
pot do so, but some years afterwards a sum of £3OO was
sent out to him in recognition of his work in that direction.
With that sum he bought Redhead, near Newcastle, and
could he have kept it, it would have been a valuable


property. He was very musical. He sang well and bad
a good voice ; he played the violin and the flute well.
When he was young he told his father that he wished very
much to learn the violin. He said no, he would have no
such noise about the house. However, he was bent upon
learning, so he went to Colchester, some miles off, to take
lessons, and when his father found he could really play,
he was delighted.
His first family consisted of four children that lived
beyond infancy, two sons and two daughters. His eldest
daughter died in 1827 ; she was fourteen years of age.
The letters that gave him this sad intelligence reached him
just when he had received the cruel blow from the A.A.
Company. He grieved painfully over this great loss. My
cousin, John Dawson, found him frequently in tears with
her likeness beside him. He thought it better to take it
from him, which he did and brought it to England.
My father left Australia early in 1828, I think. He
had a long passage. He touched at Moreton Bay, as it
was called then, and collected a few native curiosities.
They went through ' Torres Straits ; the captain anchored
every night, it was not deemed safe to navigate during the
night. He went to the Isle of France, where he remained
three weeks waiting for a ship bound to England. After
reaching England he wrote his book on Australia. He
tried to obtain redress from members and influential
persons belonging to the A. A. Company, but it was not to


be had. The Company wanted to prevent his acquiring a
grant of land which he had applied for before leaving
Australia. About that time, just after his application was
sent in, the Government ceased giving grants. My hither
took his grievance to the House of Commons and obtained
the grant, afterwards called Goorangoola. In 1830,
through Lord Barrington’s influence, he obtained the
management of Lord Dartmouth’s Estates (who was his
brother-in-law), where he remained until 1838, I think,
and returned to Australia, which he had always wished to
do; he liked the sun. He sailed on September 22nd,
1838, in the Unshrmy. He had with him his second wife
and child, and his daughter, and two or three relations,
and some stock, sheep and horses. He was not, however,
successful with them as he was on the former occasion,
nor did his affairs prosper, and disappointment and loss
prevailed.
After some years of trial he determined to return to
England. Before doing so he sold Redhead, and invested
the proceeds so well that it enabled him to live comfort-
ably in England for the remainder of his life. He left
Australia in 1861. He was eighty years of age. In one of
his letters he told me that he and Sir Alfred Stephen, who was
on board, used to play together on deck, Sir Alfred the
flute and my father the violin. He lived at or near Green-
wich, near some nephews and nieces and an aged sister
who lived to be over ninety. He was not quite eighty-four
when he died in November, 1866. He was not ill long,


and did nut suffer much. It was an immense relief to me
to know that his latter days were passed in comfort, free
from rare, able to amuse himself with his books, and have
some one to read to him when he wished. It was a calm
peaceful ending to one who had gone through much
trouble, but with untiring energy strove to make things
better. He was buried at Greenwich. Members of his
family were for several generations buried in the Chancel
of Great Bentley Church.
I have a circumstance to relate which occurred to my
father in his younger days, and which was of deep concern
to him. We read of such events, or something like them
in novels. It is to be hoped that this evil spirit seldom
disturbs the tenor of daily life. My father in early life
was engaged to a young lady. Everything went on happily
for a time and with the approval of friends on both sides,
when one day when paying a visit at the lady’s house, she
went with him to the greenhouse and told him with tears
that she must break off the engagement. He asked why.
She said she could not tell him. He said he must know',
but she only said it was impossible, she could not. She
gave him his likeness and letter, and clung to him weeping
sadly. They parted and did not meet again. More than
twenty years afterwards one of my aunts was at Bentley,
and she was told by a friend that this young lady had
married, and that a short time ago she was on her death-
bed, and told this friend why she had been obliged to
break off her engagement with Mr. Dawson. Her sister


was in love with him, and declared that unless she broke
off the engagement she would kill her ! I had a song
bound up with other music which has written on it, “ With
Miss Soand-So’s kind regards.” I have not mentioned
names. It is better not; there may be members of the
family still living. I feel sure there arc.
My father was a sportsman He rode well and was
a good shot, and would follow the hounds when he had a
chance. On one occasion his horse was staked; he
changed horses with my brother, who took it home ;he
was only a boy. Later on, when he had reached home,
he was very angry to find that the village blacksmith had
been doctoring the poor horse, in his antiquated fashion,
by stuffing rag into the wound, and thus increasing the
poor thing’s sufferings.
I forgot to mention that when my father left Essex
and went to Berkshire to take the management of Lord
Barrington’s Estate, he entered into a speculation, I
suppose it might be called, in old South Wales. He
rented land from the Government in Glamorganshire, and
I think in Brecknockshire. I was very young then, between
five and seven, and of course did not know- much about
it. I know he had sheep in numbers, in fact, he was a
squatter ! The sheep used to be sent to market, and the
ponies too. His brother had the management of the
concern. He had a nice stone house with good sized
rooms to live in. I stayed there for five or six months on
one occasion. It was called Abercrave. Part of the run


was mountainous and rough. 'here was a sheep station
called Cnwr (Canure was t! pronunciation), it did not
answer. Of course, when my father left for Australia the
concern was given up, and my uncle succeeded him in the
management of Becket.
I think that I have written all that I can remember
of the long life of one who did not live in vain. Writing
this history has given nre much pleasure, and I hope the
perusal of it will afford some interest to his grand-children
and great-grand-children.

There is another circumstance which I think I may
mention, as it is a somewhat historical fact. My father
named many places around Port Stephens when he was
in authority there. I cannot remember more than two or
three, but should I be able to call them to remembrance,
they may be added to the list I now give.
