CARRIAGE
On lots exceeding 40/- net, Carriage is Paid either
to London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Hull, or Southampton,
of all goods subject to a discount.
BUT IN THE CASE OF
Goods Sold by Weight, the Carriage is added to the
price per cwt. at Works.
PACKING.
To avoid the possibility of the use of damp straw
in packing, T. & C. Clark & Co. have constructed a
straw loft heated with hot water pipes, and have so
arranged it that the packers cannot get at that straw
last arrived till they have used that which has been dried
on the pipes, and to avoid another source of dampness
they have covered the yard in which they keep their
casks, which in a wet climate like England, will, if
exposed to the rain, soon get saturated. The carriers
have also instructions to cover all T. & C. Clark & Co.’s
goods with tarpaulin in the truck, if not loaded in
covered trucks.
T. & C. Clark & Co. frequently pack, in place of
straw, with Cotton Waste, when desired, for which they
charge od. per lb., —Cotton Waste is an article which is
always used for cleaning and stuffing purposes—and some
times, to utilize waste room, they pack with their
goods Twine, M ine Bottle Corks, Horsehair, Mops, and
Grain, charging cost of packing, and carriage to port,
with 5 per cent, commission on the prices, at which
purchases are made, after adding an equivalent to the
settlement cash allowances.


TO RE-SELL BY THE CASK.
An Importer who sells the goods as invoiced, and
has no reason or desire to alter gross prices, simply
takes off the difference between the per centage the
incidental charges bear to the gross amounts, and the
trade discount which, in a case of 25 per cent, discount
with £lO incidental charges, would he 15 per cent.,
making 10 per cent, the discount at which he would
sell the goods.
NOTICE.
To cheapen cost of Enamelled Cast-iron Round Pots
and Saucepans, if Clark’s Patented Double-edged Bright
Block Tin Covers be ordered in place of Burnished
Block Tin Covers, always sent if not otherwise ordered,
to Enamelled Round Pots and Saucepans, it will make
the complete article about 5 per cent, on the net cheaper
than if sent with Burnished Covers.
ENAMELLED CAST-IRON BATHS.
To economise shipping space, Baths, which usually
go with wooden covers, should he filled either with
twine or corks; hardware would damage the enamel

BY THE SCALE BELOW, NET PRICES ARE EASILY
CONVERTED INTO GROSS PRICES.
By the above scale, the net selling prices of goods may
be easily fixed to produce any given profit on returns. If
the percentage on the second line be added, it will show a
profit equal to the percentage immediately above it—for in-
stance, 25 per cent, being added shows a profit of 20 per cent,
profit on returns, and to get 10 per cent, on returns 11£ per
cent, must be added.


T. & C. CLARK & CO.’S
PATENTED
VITRIFIED PORCELAIN ENAMELLED HOLLOW-WARE.
Messrs. T. & C. Clark & Co, have succeeded, after a long series of
expensive scientific experiments, in discovering and greatly improving
the process by which some years ago an eminent Continental Manu-
facturer produced Culinary Utensils so greatly surpassing those of any
other kind, as to have led the principal Hollow-ware Manufacturers
of England to expend a vast amount of capital and labour in fruitless
efforts to discover the art. The peculiarity of the Enamelled Hollow-
ware consists in substituting for the usual process of tinning the inner
surface of saucepans, stew-pans, kettles, boilers, etc., a smooth, hard,
durable white Enamel, closely resembling the whitest porcelain.
The advantages of this invention are those of the cleanliness and
wholesomeness of glass or china, combined with the durability and
cheapness of cast-iron. Cooking vessels have hitherto been made
only of tinned iron or tinned copper; the former of which is at all
times difficult to clean, and rusts as the tin wears off, whilst the latter
too often proves poisonous.
Messrs. T. & C, Clark & Co. always guarantee their Hollow-ware,
both their “ Patent Enamelled" and “ Tinned" inside, as being free from
Lead, Arsenic, Antimony, or any other Deleterious Materials. This
caution is necessary from the poisonous and dangerous character of
some Culinary Vessels now in the market.
The Enamel in the Culinary Vessels of onf, firm they have proved
by analysis to contain no less than thirty-three per cent, of Lead , whilst it
is notorious that the extreme whiteness and smoothness of the Conti-
nental Enamels is mainly owing to the large quantities of Arsenic
and Antimony present.
The result of adulteration of tin with lead used in lining wrought-
iron vessels is referred to in the “ Chemical News” for January, 1869,
where it is stated that a whole family were made seriously ill, one
member nearly fatally, by the presence of eighteen per cent, of Lead in
the tin used for tinning the saucepans.
It is very gratifying to T. & C. Clark & Co. to be able to state
that their determination never under any circumstance to endeavour
to improve the appearance of their wares by the use of deleterious
materials has proved entirely successful; as the Continental Enamelled
Wares have been almost entirely replaced by theirs in Foreign Markets,
whilst they have greatly increased their Horae Trade; and they have
the satisfaction of knowing that the health of their work-people em-
ployed in enamelling is in no way injured, which is far from being the
case where the deleterious substances they have mentioned are used.


T. & C. CLARK & Co.’s
NEW PATTERN HOLLOW-WARE.
All their Enamelled and Tinned Hollow-ware patterns
have, since 1875, been made on a new principle, which has
greatly increased the cost of pattern making, but it ensures
greater regularity of castings, and far lighter than can be
cast from the old pattern. The new shapes are uniform,
and each size holds imperial measure. The method of fixing
the pot handles they patented, and that of fixing the sauce-
pan handles they registered.
Owing also to the improved proportions, they are now
enabled to nest their ware for packing much more perfectly
than was the case with the old shapes, and in consequence
they can now pack in a 43 inch hogshead as much hollow-
ware as formerly required a 45 inch, thus reducing cost of
package 2/- or nearly 12.$ per cent., and likewise reducing
the shipping measurement by about the same per centage.
These advantages are so self-evident to the purchaser for
abroad, that they cannot help but be appreciated.
At Sydney Exhibition the Judges clearly noticed the
great improvement in T. & C. Clark & Co.’s Ware, for
they awarded them a First Special Prize for cooking vessels
which may be considered for the shapes—in addition to
a 1 irst Special which had been awarded them for the
superiority of the Enamelled and Tinned Cast and Wrought-
iron Wares exhibited by them.


THE ADVANTAGES OF T. & C. CLARK & Co.’s
PATENTED
DOUBLED EDGE BRIGHT BLOCK-TIN COVERS,
Now sent with their Tinned Hollow-ware,
Over the old style of Rivetted Rim Japanned Covers, or
those Covers made of one piece of metal.
Fig. E 30.
Firstly. —The rim has no rivet like the old japanned covers,
being stamped out of a disc of iron.
Secondly. —lt has no sharp scratching edges like the above
mentioned covers.
Thirdly. —lts handle is fixed on doubly secure, through
being tinned with the top, after it is rivetted on.
Fourthly. —lts flange is sufficiently wide to well cover the
edge of the saucepan —a great eye-sore and fault of all
those made in one piece of metal.
Fifthly.—lt fits better than the covers made out of one
piece of metal, which always fits loosely, by reason of
the diameter of the rim being less close to the flange of
the fop than it is at the edge.
Sixthly. —From its construction it is without a doubt the
strongest cover yet introduced. Added to its doubled
edge, and its corrugated top, it is made on the principle
well understood by engineers and builders, who to in-
sure greater strength in a given quantity of timber,
always split beams and reverse one half, where great
weights are to be supported. This is the secret of the
extra strength of T. and C. Clark and Co.’s patented
doubled edge Cover, the body of which is made in two
pieces of metal, with the grain of the metal crossing,
whereas those made out of one piece of metal have the
grain all running one way, and the edges are not
doubled.
T. & C. Clark k Co. make their Best Burnished Tin, Brass,
and Copper Covers on the same principle.


A Case for the Interference of the English Government.
Copied from THE IRONMONGER, May 29th, 1880.
“DEATH IN THE FRYING PAN.”
T O THE EDITOR OF ” THE IRONMONGER ”
“ Sir, —I bought in a West-end shop in London last month,
at my cook’s desire, a tinned wrought-iron oval fishpan with
basket of a particular shape much used in London for frying
fish. On its arrival home, not liking the look of the tin,
and objecting strongly to add to the usual risk of life that of
being slowly poisoned, I proposed to take it to town with the
object of having the inside coating removed, and the vessel
retinned with pure tin, but before doing so thought I would
like to know the composition of the lining. I accordingly
submitted it to Mr. E. W. T. Jones, public analyst for the
county of Stafford, who reported on may 14 as follows :
“ I have analysed the scrapings from the interior of the fish stew-
pan received on the 3rd inst., and get the following per-centages :
Lead 63'81
Tin ... 30 05
Iron 5-28
, Copper / a trace
Total 99‘14
“ There have been a number of letters of late on the sub-
ject of ‘ Death in the Frying Pan,’ from the reading of which
the public would imagine that the villanous stuff these goods
are lined with is used only by the cheaper makers (lead being
about one-fifth the price of tin), but the above analysis of a
cooking vessel costing 15/- at one of the first West-end shops
proves that this is unfortunately not the case. It seems to
me that public analysts should have the same power to test
the lining of the vessels in which food is cooked as they now
possess for testing the food itself, with power to inflict fines
upon the retailer, he in his turn recovering the penalty from
the manufacturers. So long as the Government allows the
unwaiy public to purchase this poisonous stuff, so long will
the retail ironmonger continue to purchase from the manu-
facturer. In case the above analysis may be doubted, the
pan shall remain as it is for the inspection of any competent
analytical chemist.

LEADER ON “DEATH IN A FRYING RAN.”
The Ironmonger, May 29th
‘ * A few weeks ago we had occasion to publish some re-
marks under the above head with regard to certain proceedings
which had taken place in Dublin. In that instance the evil
complained of existed in an undoubted form, hut in connec-
tion with very cheap classes of goods which were being given
away by sundry enterprising grocers of the Irish capital as an
inducement to members of the public to purchase their tea.
We have now a much more serious case placed before us—
not the worse because it has arisen in London instead of in
Dublin, but because the articles in question are sold at a good
price in a respectable shop, instead of being the mere ‘sprats’
thrown out to catch the tea-dealer’s mackerel. See ‘ Weak
Stomach’s ’ letter, a correspondent for whose bona fides and
responsible social position we can vouch. We have no desire
whatever to assume the role of alarmists, nor do we for a
moment wish to involve the good and bad alike in one con-
demnation, but we are certainly of opinion that a result such
as this is calculated to upset the equanimity of even the
calmest persons. By common consent, lead is a slow but
deadly poison, and its known use in connection with cooking-
utensils is universally and properly tabooed. Here, however,
we have an article purpoting to be tinned which in reality
contains over 60 per cent, of lead, so that the unsuspecting
consumer is not only cheated by having an article worth
about one-fifth of that which he pays for palmed off upon
him, but is subjected to the imminent risk of having himself
and family poisoned into the bargain ! Such a state of things
wholly beggars comment, but it none the less demands
prompt and severe attention. The ironmonger who retails
the goods is deceived equally with the public, his customers.
Both deserve and should have protection. Those who
manufacture such adulterated goods come within the cog-
nisance of the law, and they should be made to pay the
penalty of their turpitude. We have inspectors to test our
food : surely we ought to be equally protected as regards the
utensils in which that food is cooked. We beg to call the
attention of the Board of Trade to the matter, and we do so
with the greater confidence now that the influential depart-
ment is presided over by a gentleman so intimately acquainted
with the hardware trade as the Rt. Hon. Joseph Chamberlain.
If, as we trust, the department will take the matter up, any


assistance we may be able to render shall be most cheerfully
afforded. It is important that the trade, as well as the
general public, should be defended against the evil con-
sequences of those who do wrong in order that they may
reap the greater profit thereby. ”
A Case for the interference of the French Government.
Copied from the “Daily News” Paris Correspondent’s
Letter, September 25th, 1874, on the
DANGEROUS EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING IN FRANCE.
(from our own correspondent.)
PARIS, Wednesday Night.
At the present writing the great need of France is a band
of honest tinkers. Her itameurs are fast sapping the vitals
of the population. They are worse than the phylloxera, and
the best allies of Chancellor von Bismark. How is this ?
By the practice which has grown up in the hardware trade
of using lead in the tinning of all kinds of cooking utensils.
Lead is considerably cheaper than tin. An amalgam of one
part of the latter metal and three of the former is beautifully
bright when freshly applied to the surface of a copper or
sheet iron vessel, and wearing out fast serves better than the
real thing the interests ol the trade, and of the cook who
gets a per centage on the utensils given to the tinker or the
hardware merchant round the corner to be furbished up.
You constantly hear people wonder what’s the matter with
them. Their legs tingle and suffer from a sense of weight;
their heads ache ; the fits of arrant stupidity, which are
long and frequent, are not to be accounted for by migraine
or neuralgia ; the blood is hot, yet it seems to flow sluggishly;
the appetite is bad, the throat uneasy, the teeth have an un-
easy sensation of looseness, the lumbar region is affected with
a dull pain, and the memory becomes slippery.
To find the reason for this they have only to go into their
kitchens and examine the cooking utensils. There they
would find slow death, or idiotcy, or insanity lurking in
most of the tinned vessels used by the cook in preparing the


food and beverages of the household. A short time ago a
visitor to the south of France saw, at a watering place there,
the mistress of an inn at Chateu Renard, who was suffering
from softening of the spinal marrow. She came to take the
mineral waters, which have the reputation of being very
tonic. The head doctor at first thought the disease arose
from anxiety and over exertion ; but he noticed in the young
people of her family analagous symptoms, modified by the
difference of age and temperament. He inquired about the
hereditary antecedents of his patients. Had there ever been,
so far as the innkeeper knew, epilepsy, madness, paralysis,
or blindness in her family ? No, Her parents and grand-
parents, and most of her aunts and uncles, had lived long
and healthy lives. One day, by accident, he heard her
boast of the brilliancy of her stewpans, and the care she took
to keep them brightly tinned. In all the South of France
there was not an inn whose kitchen walls presented such a
brilliant appearance as her’s at Chateau Renard. “ I’ve got
at the secret,” thought the doctor. “ She has a mania for
getting her cooking utensils constantly tinned, and those
scoundrelly itameurs have poisoned her with their leaded
amalgam.” He said nothing, but drove across the country
to Chateu Renard, and examined the pots and stewpans.
They were bright as francs fresh from the coiner’s mould.
But when well rubbed with a white cloth they left on it a
mark, black and beautifully metallic, as if a 8.8.8. pencil
had been rubbed over it. Shortly after this incident was re-
lated to me, my cook, asked for 20f. to pay the hardware
man for some kitchen utensils which she had just had tinned.
Before paying I sent for a saucepan to be brought, and
rubbed it with a pocket handkerchief. One would have
said that a black-lead brush had been passed over it. The
hardware man’s apprentice, who was waiting, was called.
He said the blackness was due to the smoke of the furnace,
and denied strenuously that there was lead in the tin which
he had applied. Soap or soda in boiling water would take
away the blackening substance. Some of the vessels were
most carefully washed, as directed, but to no purpose.
When rubbed with a white cloth they gave out the leaden
hue, as dark and metallic as ever. A saucepan that had not
been cleansed in the lye was dipped then in fresh water, and
allowed to stand in a damp place. In a few days it was
covered with the soft white efflorescence of oxydised lead.
Another was set on the fire to boil, and a spoonful of vinegar
thrown into the water it contained. When the water was at


boiling point, a white rag was thrown in, which in a short
time came out quite black. I then thought of ascertaining
what the usage of the trade is. In walking along the Rue
Abhatucci, I saw a large and to all appearance highly respect-
able hardware shop. The person directing it appeared to me
a pleasant and intelligent looking artisan of the old-fashioned
school. Frenchmen of his type are communicative. Hut as
he might have an interest in not telling the truth, I resolved
to feel my way before saying what brought me to talk to
him. So I examined some coppers on view at the door, to
which I applied the test of the South of France doctor.
Seeing me thus engaged the shopkeeper asked if he could
serve me. I held up in answer the blackened pocket hand-
kerchief, and shook my head at his merchandise. “ You
are,” he said, laughing, “one of the knowing ones. There
is not one person in five —nay, in ten —thousand in Paris
who would think of examining the tinning of a new copper
saucepan. Why the administration of the hospitals does
not think of doing so. It is lucky for the patients that
their bouillon is made in untinned coppers, for it would not
occur to the doctors that lead might have found its way
into the soup. You are eccentric in your precautions, but I
admit you are right. ”
The hardware man who lives nearly opposite the Rue
de Rome, then asked me to walk in. I went in and told
him the story of my saucepans, asking him where I could
obtain an expertise. In the course of the conversation which
thus sprung up, he told me that he belonged by apprentice-
ship to the hardware trade. Since the siege he had sold on
commission for some leading houses. Nothing could bo
franker or more lucid than his statements about the 6Uimaqe
or tinning of culinary utensils as now carried on almost in
every part of France. The police had forbidden tinkers,
some years ago, to lead their tin. Hut they got tired of
watching them, and it never occurred to them to interfere
with manufacturers or respectable hardware dealers. There
was not a tinned object in the shop where I was that did not
give out the sure and insidious lead poison. It was not his
fault that it was so. He took the wares as they were fur-
nished to the trade, and sold them without deceiving any-
one, seeing that nobody questioned. Routine is so bound up
in the French brain, that even were purchasers warned,
they would have pooh poohed, and gone on buying. The
proportion of lead in tinned cooking utensils varies. It is
more often than not relatively to the tin, as three to one.


When thus compounded, the amalgam for lining copper and
sheet iron vessels is called “ la cluire ” in the manufacturing
jargon, because of its looking.-glass brilliancy. Pure tin is
much dimmer and paler. Cooks dislike it because it is
more durable and less ornamental. The hardware dealer
giving me this information further said : “ You may have
noticed that in France men who have lived well are speedily
used up. Apart from the affections of the stomach too
copious repasts give rise to, they absorb more lead than those
who are obliged to fare meagrely on bread, cheese, fried
potatoes, broth, soup, and so on.” My informant knew the
tinman who worked for M. de Persigny’s cook, and he
assured me that the saucepans in the ducal kitchen were
tinned with “la claire.” “How are you so hale and
healthy,” I asked, “in spite of your cooking range!”
“ Because leaded tin was not in general use until within the
last eight or nine years, and I now have my food exclusively
prepared in things I tin myself, or in iron and earthen vessels.
And before using pipkins you should boil them for several
days. There is also lead in the varnish of coarse earthen-
ware, which heat and moisture extract in the course of a
week or so.”
The foregoing dissertation on the lead poison lurking in
the stewpan will, I hope, justify the assertion I made on
setting out, that nothing is more needed in France than a
band of honest tinkers. Light utensils, such as coffee pots,
and fine strainers, can be obtained free from the poisonous
amalgam. But if given to be tinned they can no longer be
used without danger. Copper is less dangerous than “la
claire.” Servants believe that verdigris is rank poison.
But if spoken to about the deleterious nature of oxide of
lead or tin, or the still more dangerous scoriae, which covers
the bottoms of saucepans tinned with the amalgam in
question, when browning flour or onions for stews, they ob-
stinately shake their heads, and say it is “an idea.” When
your cook tells you the death which lurks in the pot under
the brilliant surface of “la claire” is only “an idea,” she
thinks she has said everything upon the subject. She will
go on using the condemned utensil unless you give it to her
to sell, or employ the concierge to throw it into the dust-cart.

T & C. Clark & Co. have made the following
improvements in their Lnamelled Saucepans.
The Enamel is now so much whiter, smoother, and
thinner. The Mouths being larger, the boiling over at
first complained of is in a great measure avoided. From
Saucepans with the old shaped lips it was impossible to pour
out slowly without the contents running down the sides of
the saucepan, this with the new lips is no longer the
case The Bridged Lip will enable a cook to pour out clear
broth from under the objectionable floating fat too often
served with soup.

T. & C. Clark & Co. have made the following
improvements in their Enamelled Tea Kettles.
The Handles are so shaped on the underside that
it is impossible for the kettle to slip on a hook, which
too often happens with the old kind of handle, causing
many scalds.
These Kettles can either be made with well bottoms
or rings round the outside, so that they can be placed
into the holes over a cooking range fire.

The Bail Handle has a stop on one side, so with the assist-
ance of side handle they are easily emptied. The Bright
Cover is a great improvement on the old Japanned, and to
the Storekeeper being able to mark them with his name with
a punch, without damaging them, must be an advantage.

gives the handle more strength to keep the wrought part
straight. The Enamel is much whiter, smoother, and
thinner than it used to be. The corners rounder, so that a
spoon is got more readily into it when stirring to prevent

NOTICE.
T. & C. Clark & Co. have made many improvements
in Enamel Maslin Kettles the last few years. They were
the first to think of the advantage of a stop handle, in con-
junction with a side handle, which they registered, and it has
since been taken up in America, and considered the greatest
improvement to that favourite American cooking vessel.
The corner at bottom of this Pan is made now much
rounder than formerly, so that a Wooden Spoon used in
preserving fruit can be got more easily into it.

the liability to boil over is less.

purposes they are liked, as they are so easily cleaned. To
the Manufacturing Chemist they are invaluable.
The oblong Furnace is convenient for washing, as if
placed in a corner, the fire hole can be fixed at end, out of
the road of those working at the boiler.

NOTICE.
T. & C. Clark & Co have of late greatly improved
the appearance of their Enamel, which is now much whiter.
Their Porcelain Enamel is, without a doubt, the cleanest
and most durable lining yet produced for baths. It assimi-
lates to the heat of the water quicker than the clay or slate
of which baths are made, and through the non-conducting
nature of enamel their baths retain the heat longer
than if made of copper or zinc, the painted surfaces of which
baths soon give way to the action of soap. In some of their
Baths the grate at bottom is cast in and enamelled.

They are well Tinned inside and Annealed, conse-
quently are not liable to crack like a common cast
one. Those seen in France—Electro Tinned—are very

T. & C. Clark & Co. have made the following im-
provement in Tinned Maslin Kettles of late.
The tin with which they line their cooking vessels is
free from lead, and as it requires so much more heat to melt
than when lead is present, there is not the liability to run
into small lumps as there is with that poisonous com-
pound often used to line Wrought Hollow-ware, comprised
of | lead to £ of tin.

NOTICE.
T. & C. Clakk & Co. are making most of their Box
Mills to regulate by means of a screw on the outside, work-
ing on a Cam patented by Bruorton ; the advantage of that
principle is that a Box Mill can be regulated after being
screwed down to a dresser. If the bottom screw regulator
be preferred, T. & C, Clark & Co. make now a hole at
bottom large enough for the hand to pass through, that the
finger may turn the fly nut screw without the necessity of
turn screw.

T. & C. Clark & Co. have obtained their name for

are never hardened at all, the consequence is, when screwed

and price low, a great number have been sold. The advan-
tage it has over the box is that you can hang it up to the
ceiling out of the way, and by threading the string in and out
through the bars of the Patent Brake at bottom, the friction
prevents the string running too rapidly, which is always
the case with a string reel.

gets his “lead mouse, ” they have substituted a solid flange
at top, which guides the mouse round the sheave. The Brass

Added to the ends broader, to give the frame a
better bearing, they have put a head all round the back,
which has the effect of preventing the possibility of the frame
rocking on the rivetted end of the Axle. The Pin of their new

improve the looks and strength of the Pulley.

T. & C. Clauk & Co.’s Enamelled Wrought-iron
Meat Dishes are much used in cook shops for keeping meat
warm on the top of metal hot water stands, being thin they
assimilate to the heat of the stand quicker than earthenware
do. They are also used in ovens as baking dishes.

NOTICE.
T. & C. Clark & Co. have now thoroughly established
the great advantage of their Enamel for Wrought-iron
Cooking Vessels, which, like that on their Cast-iron, is
warranted free from lead. Those lead glazes hitherto put
upon Wrought-iron are highly dangerous for pie dishes, as
not only does the acid of fruit dissolve such glazes, but they
are also attacked by the acids produced in meat pies kept
sometime after being cooked.

NOTICE.
T. & C. Clark & Co.’s Enamel standing fire so well
is most suitable for American Stove Baking Dishes. The
above is a shape used in cooking shops to keep meat hot on
gas stands. They are also used by cooks as dripping and
lard pans. For cooking fish in oil, enamelled pans are far
superior to tinned iron, as the degrees of heat at which
some greases boil will melt the tin off the iron.

NOTICE.
T. & C. Clark & Co.’s improved thin White Enamel
for Wrought-iron is most suitable for stewpans. Its free-
dom from lead is not one of its least recommendations. For
making delicate sauces cooks sometime place them inside
cast-iron stewpans containing hot water.

EXTRACT FROM THE “IRONMONGER”
TO TEST ENAMELLED IKON WARE
FOR LEAD.
“Ebermayer takes ordinary vinegar, which he dilutes
with four times its weight of water, and to which he
adds 5 per cent, of table salt. The solution is poured
into the vessel, and left in it for 12 hours at ordinary
temperature. After this time the liquid is examined
for lead by means of sulphide of ammonium. If the
liquid acquires a black or dark brown colour, the
enamel is dangerous ; if the colour is only light yellow
or light brown, the vessels may be used.”
For frying fish or meat in fat or oil, Enamelled has a
great advantage over Tinned Iron or Copper, as it will
stand the heat of boiled oil—which in a fish pan may
be heated to a higher degree than the melting point
of tin—a fact well-known and taken advantage of by
manufacturers.
Should the Tin be mixed with Lead (see notice on
this subject at the commencement of this book) its
melting point is lower still than tin—many cooks do
not object to this as the retinning of Copper or
Wrought-iron has to be done more frequently, and
consequently their Christmas boxes calculate on the
amount of their master’s bill with the unprincipled
ironmonger or manufacturer increased.

T. & C. Clark & Co.’s Enamelled Wrought-iron
Basins are much liked for washing in, being so light to
empty, and as the enamel will resist any time the action of
soap, if carefully used there is no end to the wear of them.

Above are made either with a small ring rivetted on the
side to attach a chain, to be used as a fountain drinking
cup, or with Handle at 3d. each extra.
NOTICE.
T. & C. Clark & Co. strongly recommend their half
pint Tumbler, in conjunction with their deep broad flange
Saucer, for the use of stations, coffee houses, and hospitals,
as with this new shaped Saucer it is almost impossible to
upset the cup, and the broad flange dispenses with the use
of a plate.

NOTICE,
T. & C. Clark & Co. can recommend their Enamel
as most suitable for Omelette Pans, as it stands heat well,
and will transmit it quickly. Being very light there is a
great saving in carriage, in fact, it is from 10 to 20 per cent,
lighter than the Wrought-iron Enamel made under Paris
Patent, and has the great advantage over it of being free
from Oxide of Lead.

NOTICE.
T. & C. Clark & Co.’s Enamelled Wrought-iron is
most suitable for baking mince or fruit pies in, as it does
not heat so rapidly as tin, which cause the bottom crust to
be burnt, but it is much quicker in assimilating itself to the
heat of the oven than earthenware, and at the same time it
retains the heat nearly as long.

T. & C. Clark & Co. sell the above engraved article
for a variety of purposes, besides drinking cups. Its stand-
ing heat makes it most useful at a hospital to keep things
warm on a stove. With a Tinned Cover, which can be
supplied, it makes a very useful Saucepan for warming
milk on a Trivet, for Nursery or Bed-room use

pint tumbler, and an extra broad flange on which to place
bread and butter.

NOTICE.
T. & C. Clark & Co.’s Enamelled Wrought-iron
plates arc much liked, from their lightness and their power
to resist the action of the fire. For Hot Water Plates they
have an advantage over china or earthenware, being thinner
they assimilate more quickly to the heat of the water.
These Plates sell well abroad, being 15 per cent, lighter
than those usually made, although the iron is equally as
strong.
