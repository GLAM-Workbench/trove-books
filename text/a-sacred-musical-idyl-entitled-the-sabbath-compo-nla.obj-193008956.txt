THE SABBATH.
DAYBREAK.
Recitative—Miss Armstrong.
The lonely night is past, and dawn creeps o’er the dis-
tant hills. The flowers lift up their drooping heads,
while dewdrops tremble on the leaves. The sun leaps
forth, and fills the world with glory. It is the Sabbath
morn.
Hymn
Jesus, Sun of Righteousness,
Brightest beam of love divine,
With the early morning rays
Do Thou on our darkness shine,
And dispel with purest light
All our night.
As on drooping herb and flower
Falls the soft refreshing dew,
Let Thy Spirit’s grace and power
All our weary souls renew;
Showers of blessing over all
Softly fall.
Recitative—Miss Law.
Anon the church bells, ringing loud and clear,
Proclaim to every heart that God is near.
Semi-Chorus— With solos and duet by Misses Hillier,
Ferguson and Loftus, and Mr. Paterson.
Sweetly the Sabbath bells are pealing,
Sweetly bidding life’s tumults cease,
Sweetly calling earth’s tired children
Home to a haven of rest and peace


They tell how the dear Lord Christ came down
From His far-off land of light,
To share all our sorrows and joys upon earth,
Our morning and our night.
They tell how he came to the sad of heart,
Each broken and sorrowing one ;
Tell how He died that we might live
And His Father’s will be done.
Ring on, sweet Sabbath bells,
Ring on your wond’rous story,
Till all God’s people own His sway,
His honour, power and glory.
THE MORNING CHURCH SERVICE
Anthem—
Be with us, Gracious Lord, to-day,
This house we dedicate to Thee,
O hear Thy servants as they pray.
And let Thine ear attentive be.
Within these walls let holy peace,
Let love and truth be always found ;
May burdened hearts find sure relief,
And souls with richest grace be crowned.
May here be heard the suppliant’s sigh,
The weary enter into rest;
Here may the contrite to Thee cry,
And waiting souls be richly blest.
Here, when the gospel sound is heard,
And here proclaimed the Saving Name,
May hearts be quickened, moved and stirred.
And souls be quickened into flame.
Here may the dead be made to live,
The dumb to sing, the deaf to hear ;
And do Thou to the humble give
Pardon and peace instead of fear.
Make this, O Lord, Thine own abode,
Thy presence in these courts be given,
Be this indeed the House of God,
And this in truth the Gate of Heaven,


Contralto Solo —Miss Notman.
I heard the voice of Jesus say—
“ Come unto me and rest,
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon my breast.”
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary and worn and sad,
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.
I heard the voice of Jesus say —
“Behold I freely give
The living water, thirsty one,
Stoop down and drink and live.”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream ;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him,
I heard the voice of Jesus say—
“l am this dark world’s light,
Come unto me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy days be bright.”
I came to Jesus, and I found
In Him my star, my sun,
And in that light of life I’ll walk
Till travelling days are done.
Duet (Soprano and Contralto)— Misses Hillier
Loftus.
What are these in bright array,
This innumerable throng,
Round the altar night and day,
Hymning one triumphant song :
Worthy is the Lamb, once slain,
Blessing, honour, glory power,
Wisdom, riches to obtain,
New dominion every hour.
These through fiery trials trod,
These from great affliction came,
Now before the throne of God,
Sealed with His Almighty Name.
Clad in raiment pure and white,
Victor palm in every hand,
Through their dear Redeemer’s might
More than conquerors they stand.


Hunger, thirst, disease unknown,
On immortal fruit they feed,
And the Lamb amidst the throne
Shall to living fountains lead.
Joy and gladness banish sighs,
Perfect love dispels all fears,
And for ever from their eyes
God shall wipe away the tears.
8. Hymn
Lord dismiss us with Thy blessing,
Fill our hearts with joy and peace,
Let us each, Thy love possessing,
Triumph in Redeeming Grace;
O refresh us
Travelling through this wilderness.
Thanks we give and adoration
For the Gospel’s joyful sound,
May the fruits of Thy salvation
In our hearts and lives abound ;
May Thy presence
With us evermore be found.
So, when’er the signal’s given
Us from earth to call away,
Borne on angel’s wings to Heaven,
Glad the summons to obey,
May we ever
Reign with Christ in endless day.
THE AFTERNOON
9. Recitative —Miss Law.
Between the hours of noon and eventide, in many a home
Sweet sounds of praise are heard ascending up to God.
10. Anthem (Solos by Miss Armstrong and Mr. Nixon)--
I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
and am no more worthy to be called thy son.


Contralto Solo —Miss Loftus.
There is a blessed home
Beyond this land of woe,
Where trials never come,
Nor tears of sorrow flow;
Where faith is lost in sight,
And patient hope is crowned,
And everlasting light
Its glory throws around.
There is a land of peace —
Good angels know it well—
Glad songs that never cease,
Within its portals swell.
Around its glorious throne
Ten thousand saints adore ;
Christ with the Father, One,
And Spirit evermore.
Anthem (Solos by Miss Hillier and Mr. Paterson)
(In this number use is made of the tune “Palestrina.")
Teach me, O Lord, the perfect way
Of thy precepts divine,
And to observe it to the end
I shall my heart incline.
Give understanding unto me,
So keep thy law shall I;
Yea, even with my whole heart I shall
Observe it carefully.
Turn Thou away my sight and eyes
From viewing vanity,
And in thy good and holy way
Be pleased to quicken me.
Turn Thou away my fear’d reproach.
For good thy judgments be;
Lo, for thy precepts I have longed,
In Thy truth quicken me.
Let thy sweet mercies also come
And visit me, O Lord,
E’vn thy benign salvation,
According to thy word.
Soprano Solo —Miss Hillier.
The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want,
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green, He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.


My soul tte doth restore again,
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E’vn for His own name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale
Yet will I fear no ill,
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.
Semi-Chorus (With solos, duet and quartette by
Misses Ferguson and Loftus, and Messrs. Paterson
and Thomson.)
Winter reigneth o’er the land,
Freezing with its icy breath;
Dead and bare the tall trees stand —
All is chill and drear as death.
Yet it seemeth but a day
Since the summer flowers were here;
Since they stacked the balmy hay,
Since they reaped the golden ear.
Sunny days are passed and gone,
So the years go speeding fast;
Onward ever, each new one
Swifter speeding than the last.
Life is waning, life is brief,
Death, like winter, standeth nigh,
Each one, like the falling leaf,
Soon shall fade and fall, and die.
But the sleeping earth shall wake,
And the flowers shall burst in bloom
And all nature rising, break
Glorious from the wintry tomb.
So, Lord, after slumber blest
Comes a bright awaking,
And our flesh in hope shall rest
Of never-fading spring.
Recitative— Miss Notman.
Shadows of evening fall on all around,
And once again God’s people bend their steps
His holy house.
towards
COLLECTION.


THE EVENING CHURCH SERVICE.
Anthem —(Solo by Miss Ferguson).
Hark the glad sound, the Saviour comes.
The Saviour promised long,
Let every heart prepare a throne,
And every voice a song.
He comes the prisoners to release,
In Satan’s bondage held,
The gates of brass before Him burst,
The iron fetters yield.
He comes the broken heart to bind,
The bleeding soul to cure,
And with the treasures of His grace
T’enrich the humble poor.
Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
Thy welcome shall proclaim,
And Heaven’s eternal arches ring
With Thy beloved Name.
Duet (Contralto and Tenor) — Miss Notman and Mr.
G. H. Sutton.
Holy Father, cheer our way
With Thy love’s perpetual ray,
Grant us every closing day
Light at evening time.
Holy Saviour, calm our fears
When earth’s brightness disappears,
Grant us in our later years
Light at evening time.
Holy Spirit, be Thou nigh
When in mortal pain we lie,
Grant us when we come to die
Light at evening time.
Holy, Blessed Trinity,
Darkness is not dark to Thee,
Those Thou keepest always see
Light at evening time.
Anthem—(Solos by Miss Armstrong and Mr. Thomson)
O sing unto the Lord a new song, for He hath done
marvellous things; with His own right hand and
with His holy arm hath He gotten Himself the
victory. The Lord declared His salvation; His


righteousness hath He openly shown in the sight
of the heathen. He hath remembered His mere} 7
towards the house of Israel; and all the ends of the
world have seen the salvation of our God. Show
yourselves joyful unto the Lord all ye lands; sing,
rejoice, and give thanks. Praise the Lord upon the
harp; sing to the harp with a song of thanksgiving,
with trumpets also and shawms. O show yourselves
joyful before the Lord, the King. Let the sea make
a noise, and all that therein is, the round world
and they that dwell therein. Let the floods clap
their hands, and let the hills be joyful together
before the Lord; for He cometh to judge the earth ;
with righteousness shall Pie judge the world, and
the people with equity.
Quartette (Unaccompanied)--MissES Hillier and
Loftus, and Messrs. Paterson and Thomson.
Through the day Thy love hath spared us,
Now we lay us down to rest;
Through the silent watches guard us,
Let no foe our peace molest.
Jesus Thou our guardian be,
Sweet it is to trust in Thee.
Pilgrims here on earth, and strangers,
Dwelling in the midst of foes.
Us and ours preserve from danger,
In Thine arms may we repose,
And when life’s short day is past
Rest with Thee in Heaven at last.
20. Recitative—Mr. Nixon
Homeward through the quiet night the worshippers depart;
“ Holy calm in every dwelling, holy peace in every heart ”
21. Chorus —
I will lay me down in peace and take my rest, for it
is Thou Lord only that makest me to dwell in
safety. Amen.
