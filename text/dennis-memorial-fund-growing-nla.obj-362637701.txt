Dennis Memorial
Fund Growing
“An’ I am blest, becos me feet ’ave trod
A land whose fields reflect the smile o’
God. . .
C. J. Dennis trod such a land. It in-
spired him to write those lines. Through
all his works an undercurrent of pride
can be felt for his land and a warm
human feeling for all its people.
His friends dwelt in city and country,
but included anyone who had with him
a fellow feeling for the furry folk of
bushland.
The influence exerted on the cultural
life of Australia by his discerning critic-
isms will live long. To keep his memory
longer in the minds of Australians a
public subscription has been launched for
a memorial.
Any contribution will be acknowledged
by The Herald.
CLUB’S CHALLENGE
Forwarding £5 from the Bread and
Cheese Club, the hon. secretary (Mr E.
J. Turner) says it is the club’s first in-
stalment and writes:
“Let us, in no arrogant spirit, challenge
any club, literary or otherwise, to exceed
our eventual total. We are only a small
aggregation of about 30 and, flushed with
the pleasure of the newly-born, but we
give way to none in our desire to forward
Australian literature. Are there any
takers?”
