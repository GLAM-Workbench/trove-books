GOLDSBROUGH?S WOOL WAREHOUSES,
Melbourne, 22nd September , 1880,
WOOL.?We intended to have held our opening
sale of the season on Wednesday, the 29th inst.,
but, owing to the wet weather having retarded
shearing operations, we have decided to wait a
week longer, and commence selling on Wednesday,
the 6th of October. Wool is arriving freely, and
we anticipate firm prices, the advices from England
continuing satisfactory.
Sheepskins. ?We have sold a full supply
during the past week, and secured full prices
for all disposed of. Our sales dragged somewhat,
as some of the fellmongers, owing to damage
done by the recent floods, have not yet resumed
active operations. We quote late rates, viz.:?
Butchers? Green Skins, of superior quality, from
?s. to 7s. 3d. each ; do. do., of average quality,
from 4s. to 6s. each ; Butchers? Dry Skins, from
3s. to ss. 6d. each; Dry Skins, at per lb., 3d. to
7d. Pelts are now making their appearance.
Hides.? The market was fully supplied, and
late rates were maintained. There is no change
to report, and all offering find buyers at quota-
tions. Country lots should now be carefully
salted, and kept as clean as possible ; offal, such
as faces, legs, &c., should be removed. There is a
good demand for New Zealand heavy weights
at from 3|d. to 4sd. per lb. We quote

sought after at present, the market having recently
been glutted. Prime lots are saleable at from 12d.
to 15d. per dozen ; others in proportion.

tone of the market is steady. We quote : ?Crop,

10s. to 20s. per dozen.
Tallow. ?We offered a large catalogue yester-
day, but disposed of very few lots at auction, both
shippers and local manufacturers operating to a
very limited extent only, and the sales effected
were too few to serve as a sure guide to the tone of
the market; late rates, however, were maintained,
viz.:?Best Mutton, f.0.b., up to �29 per ton ; do.
Beef, do., up to �27 10s. per ton ; average Mutton,

coming in freely, and there will be a large quan-
tity in store ready to offer. Prices will, no doubt,

plied, and we secured full prices for all disposed

buyers. Offal, such as face pieces, legs, &c., should
be removed from country lots; also the Hides should

per lb.
Opossum Skins, &c.? The demand is not so
good, and we notice a decline in value of from
Is. to 2s. per dozen. Several buyers have some-
what restricted their operations, and the season
may be expected to close soon. There is, however,
a fair demand at present, and sales can be readily
effected at quotations, viz.:?Superior lots, from
cold districts, from 6s. to 7s. per dozen ; average
Skins, from 3s. to 6s. per dozen ; inferior, from

Melbourne, 13th October, 1880,
YTOOL. ?We held our second sale to-day, and
catalogued 2423 bales. There was a very numerous
attendance of buyers, our auction rooms being
crowded, and competition was very spirited. We
sold greasy clips as follows : ?North Brighton,
234 bales at ll|d. to 12d.; LMB, 406 bales at ll|d.,
and had the following high prices offered ; ?For
Zara, 288 bales, 13d.; Murray Downs, 140 bales,
12� d.; G-AH, 57 bales, ll|d.; and others in propor-
tion ; in fact, buyers bid up extremely well, and if
owners will accept reasonable rates, very large
sales will be made. Scoured also sold at excellent
prices, ranging up to 21Jd., the latter price
being obtained for a good average lot from Avoca,
In all, we sold 1170 bales, and probably the lots
bought in will also be disposed of.
Sheepskins. ?Our sales held during the past
week have been well supplied, and full rates were
readily secured. Pelts are offering in large quan-
tities, and, indeed, comprise the chief item. We
report a steady market at quotations?viz..
Butchers? Green Skins, at from 4s. to 6s. 6d. each,
according to size and quality ; Butchers? Dry
Skins, from 3s. to ss. 6d. each ; Dry Skins, at per
lb., 3d. to 7Jd. Pelts of all classes have met
with ready sale, at prices ranging up to Is. 6d.
each.
Hides. ?The tone of the market is firm at late
rates, and we cleared a full supply. Offal should
be removed from the Hides by vendors before
sending forward, as buyers object to Hides with
offal left on, and lower prices have to be accepted
to meet the labour incurred in removal by the
buyers ; also Hides should be well salted, and kept
clean. We quote :?Green Ox (average sizes), from
17s. to 28s. each (several lots of heavy-weights,
in good condition, have fetchedvery high prices);
Green Cow (average sizes), from 12s. to 17s. each ;

quote Skins of superior quality up to 6s. 6d. per
dozen ; do. average do., from 3s. to 6s. do.; do.
inferior do., from Is. to 3s. do. Rabbit Skins are

of the London market has had a depressing effect
here. Late rates, however, were maintained?

Wheat. ?We catalogued 2155 bags Grain for
our sale to-day, and disposed of every lot; the
total sold, privately and by public auction, being
2498 bags for the week. At the sale to-day there
was an exceedingly large attendance of buyers,
both for export and local consumption. The latest
news received by cablegram, reporting a further
advance of Is. 6d. per quarter for prime Wheat, has
evidently caused the English and foreign buyers
to watch this market carefully, and should the
present prices continue in the home markets, ship-
pers will be able to resume operations. We report
a further advance of Id. per bushel in our own
market, and quote prime Milling Wheat at
4s. 5d.; medium to good, 4s. to 4s. 4Jd.; inferior
to medium, 3s. 3d. to 3s. per bushel.
Flour. ?All good country brands find ready
purchasers at from �9 to �9 2s. 6d., and town-
milled �9 10s. sterling per ton.

WOOL.?We catalogued 3933 bales for our sale to-
day, and had a full attendance of buyers and
spirited competition, late rates being firmly
sustained. The top price for Greasy (13-|-d.) was
obtained for 229 bales from the Gobbagumbalin
Station, near Wagga Wagga; and other lots also
sold at excellent prices, including Greasy clips, as
follows:?OE, 109 bales, at 12|d.; Kaarimba,

Sheepskins. ?Our sales held during the past
week were well attended by the local fellmongers,
and we report active competition at an advance on
late rates. Pelts are offering in large quantities.
We quote Butchers? Green Skins at prices ranging
from 3s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. each, according to size and
quality ; Butchers? Dry Skins, from 3s. to ss. 6d.

7�d.
Hides, ?Late rates were well maintained, and
we sold a large supply of local produce at quota-
tions. Vendors are requested to remove offal, such
as face-pieces, legs, &c., as its presence has a pre-
judicial effect on sales, buyers having to remove
it at their own expense afterwards. We shall
offer a very choice lot of New Zealand heavy-
weights to-morrow, and as the market has been
somewhat bare of this class of Hides for some time
past we anticipate a satisfactory sale. Our quota-
tions are : ?Green Ox (average sizes), from 17s. to
28s. each ; Green Cow (average sizes), from 12s. to
17s. each ; Victorian-salted (superior), up to 4�d.
per lb.; average, f�om 3�d. to id. per lb.;
inferior, from 2�d. to 3�d. per lb.; Kips from
2�d. to 3�d. per lb.; Calfskins, from 3d. to sd.
per lb.; New Zealand heavies, from 3fd. to 4|d.
per lb.
Kangaroo Skins, &c. ?The market is firm at
late rates, and good sound Skins find a steady
demand at quotations?viz., Kangaroo Skins, from
7d. to 14d. per lb.; Wallaby do., from sd. to 9d.
per lb.
Opossum Skins, &c.? There is a good demand
at quotations, and although the supply offering is
heavy, ready sales have been secured. The season
will close in the course of a few weeks, but at pre-
sent well-furred Skins meet with a fair demand.
Superior lots realised up to 6s. 6d. per dozen ;
average do., from 3s. to 6s. do. ; inferior do.,
from Is. to 3s. do. Rabbit Skins find a market at
prices ranging up to Is. 3d. per dozen, but the
demand is not brisk, and only prime lots meet
with attention.
Leather. ?We report a fair demand at late
rates?viz., Crop, 9d. to lid. per lb.; Kip, Is. to Is.
6d. per lb.; Calf, 2s. to 2s. lOd. per lb.; Wallaby,
2s. to 3s. per lb.; Harness, lid. to 14Jd. per lb.;
Basils, 10s. to 20s. per dozen.
Tallow. ?We offered a large catalogue at auc-
tion yesterday, the bulk of which was sold to the
local manufacturers at quotations. The tone of
the market was flat, and we found difficulty in
securing late rates. Business on shipping account
was restricted. We quote : ?Best Mutton (f.0.b.),
up to �2B 10s. per ton ; best Beef (f.0.b.), �27 per
ton ; average Mutton, from �25 10s. to �27 10s.
per ton ; do. Beef, �24 10s. to �26 10s. per ton ;
Mixed, �2l to �25 10s. per ton.

WHEA.T. ?At our sale to-day we catalogued
2323 bags, and have sold since last report, by
auction and privately, 1546 bags. Although the
attendance was large, the lower rates ruling in Eng-
land (as per recent telegrams) evidently inspired
shippers with caution. The local demand was,
however, brisk, and satisfactory prices were ob-
tained from the trade for every line sold,
considering the heavy arrivals during the last
few days from all the country districts and
the quality of the grain offered. We quote :
?Prime Milling Wheat, 4s. 3|d.; medium to
good, 3s. lid. to 4s. 2d.; inferior to medium, 3s.
to 3s. lOd. per bushel.
Flour. ?Good country brands find purchasers
at from �9 7s. 6d. to �9 10s.; town-milled,
from �9 10s. to �9 15s. per ton ; but the demand
for shipment is somewhat weaker.
, Oats. ?We catalogued 695 bags, and sold 659
hags ; the market is bare of good milling and best
feeding samples, but inferior and medium qualities
are easier, owing to the heavy supply. We quote
prime Milling up to 2s. 4d,; Best Feed, 2s. 2d.;
medium to good, Is. lOd. to 2s. Id.; inferior to
medium, Is. 6d. to Is. lOd.
Barley. ?We sold at the following rates: ?
Prime Malting, up to 4s. 3d.; medium to good,
Ss. 4d. to 45.; Cape and Oregon, 2s. Id. to 2s. 3d.
per bushel. Parcels of Prime Malting are in
request. For Bran we obtained lOd. per bushel.

WOOL.?We catalogued 3648 bales for our sale
to-day, and had an excellent attendance of buyers
and brisk competition, late rates being well main-
tained. Greasy ranged from 6|d. to 13d., the
latter price for the Burryjaa clip. Others sold in
proportion, H M realising 12fd.; Cornelia Creek,
12d.; half-circle over I, 12d.; Colbinabbin, llfd.;
Toorangabby, Maywood, G and W over
Burrongong, ll|d., &c. Inferior to good average
Washed and Scoured realised 12fd. to 23|d. per
lb. The total sold was 2131 bales, and offers for
the four large clips not disposed of are so close
that they will probably be placed by private con-
tract.
Sheepskins. ?Our sales held during the past
week w r ere well attended by the local fell-
mongers, and all offering were readily cleared
out at quotations. The holidays will necessarily
interfere with the routine of the present week?s
sales, but we confidently expect to secure late
rates for the supply coming forward. We quote
as follows :?Butchers? Green Skins, from 4s. to
6s. 6d. each ; do. do. Pelts, from Is. to Is. XOd.
each; do. Dry Skins, from 3s. 6d. to 6s. each ; do.

Dry Skins, at per pound, 3d. to 7^d.
Hides. ?We have no change to report, and we
readily effect sales at quotations. The tone of the
market is not quite so firm, but prices have not
given way, and heavy weights, in good condition,
attract attention. Offal should be removed, as its
presence has a prejudicial effect on sales ; also,
Hides should be kept as clean as possible, and
well salted. Green Ox (average sizes) realised
from 17s. 6d. to 28s. each ; Green Cow (average
sizes), from 14s. to 17s. 6d. each ; Victorian-salted
(superior), from 4d. to 4Jd. per lb.; average, from

3fd. to 4|d. per lb. Kips realised from 3d. to
3�d.; Calfskins, from to sd. per lb.
Kangaroo Skins, &c.? The demand is good, and
large, sound Skins have met with ready sale
at from lOd. to 13d. per lb.; Wallaby Skins,
at from fid. to per lb. The season being far
advanced, buyers operate vigorously only in choice
lots.
Opossum Skins, &c. ?Late rates were with
difficulty maintained, and as most of the Skins now
offering are poorly furred, business is not brisk;
the season will soon close. We quote :?Superior

from 3s. to 4s. 6d. do.; inferior do., from Is. to

being ? Cup Day,? and will offer a large catalogue
at our next sale. Recent telegrams from Europe
show an advance in value in the London market

look for improved rates here. At present we are
unable to form an opinion of how quotations will

Wheat.? -We catalogued 2615 bags of Grain
for our sale to-day, and have sold since our last
report, by public auction and privately, 1458 bags.
There was a large attendance of buyers, the de-
mand being principally for local consumption,
the English and foreign buyers evidently purchas-
ing with great caution, owing, no doubt, to the
late unfavourable news received by cablegram,
quoting Wheat at Bs. 6d. per quarter. We quote ?
Prime Milling Wheat, 4s. Id. to 4s. l|d.; medium to
good, 3s. Bd. to 45.; and inferior to medium, 3s. 2d.

Flour. ?All good country brands find ready
purchasers at �9 sterling, and town-milled,
�9 15s. sterling per ton.
OATS. ?Since our last report we cannot note any
improvement in prices, owing, no doubt, to the very
heavy supplies coming forward from the inland
districts, prices having receded fully lid. per
bushel: and we quote: ?Prime Milling Oats, 2s. 6d.;
prime Feed, 2s. 3d,; medium to good, Is. lid. to
2s. 2d.; and inferior to medium, Is. 6�d. to Is. 10d.

Barley.? We have been well supplied during
the past week, but owing to the inferior sorts
now coming forward prices appear low for all
inferior and off samples, whilst prime Malting
realises full rates. We quote :?Prime Malting,
4s. 2d.; medium to good, 3s. sd. to 45.; inferior

WEEKLY REPORT,
GOLDSBROUGH?S WOOL WAREHOUSES,
Melbourne, B th November, 1880.
WOOL.?We held our usual sale of small clips
to-day, and had an excellent attendance of buyers
and brisk competition. The catalogue included
571 bales, of which 502 bales were sold, inferior
to average Greasy realising 6d. to lljd. per lb.,
and inferior to ordinary Washed, 13d. to 16|d.
per lb.
Melbourne, \oth November, 1880.
WOOL.?We catalogued 6128 bales for our sale
to-day, and had an excellent attendance of buyers
and brisk competition, late rates being well main-
tained. Greasy ranged from 7|d. to 14|d., the
latter high price being obtained for 125 bales from
the Narrow Plains Station, Riverina ?Messrs. Ross
and James Ramsay?s ; other Greasy clips sold well
?WHG (from Tasmania), 13� d.; A over Hope,
13� d.; Carroonboon, 12fd.; Piney Range, 12|d.;
Walbundrie, 12Jd.; B. W. Pitts (from South
Australia), 13d.; AK and A, Mount
Koroit, and others in proportion. Washed
Wools also commanded excellent competition,
prices ranging from 13d. to 2s. the latter
price being obtained for 56 bales Scoured from
the Bundyalumblah Station. The Gerogery clip,
186 bales, realised 22d. Altogether the sale was
very successful, 4179 bales being sold ; and the
whole would, no doubt, have been disposed of
had it not been for the high reserves on some of
the lots.
Sheepskins, ?We have disposed of a full
supply during the past week, and secured satis-
factory prices. The holidays necessarily inter-
fered with our regular routine of sales ; but the
attendance of buyers at our sales was large, and
we found no difficulty in placing the bulk offering
at quotations, viz.;?Butchers? Green Skins, from
4s. to 6s. 6d. each ; do. do. Pelts, at prices rang-
ing up to Is. lOd. each.; Butchers? Dry Skins, from
Bs. 6d. to 6s. each ; do. do. Pelts, up to Is. Bd.
each.; Dry Skins, at per pound, 3d. to 7�d.
Hides. ?Late rates were maintained, and a
large supply fell before the hammer at quotations.
The local tanners operated with spirit, and all
classes of Hides met with fair attention. Offal
should be removed from Hides, as its presence has
a prejudicial effect on sales. Hides should also
be well salted, and kept as clean as possible. We
quote : ?Green Ox-hides (average sizes), from
18s. to 28s. each ; do. Cow, do., from 14s. to 17s.
6d. each ; Yictorian-salted (superior), from 4d. to
4fd. per lb.; average, from 3Jd. to 4d. per lb.;
inferior, from 2�d. to per lb. New Zealand
heavy weights (in good condition) meet with
good inquiry at from 3|d. to 4|d. per lb.; Kips
realised from 3d. to 3Jd. per lb.; Calfskins, from
3�d. to sd. per lb.
Kangaroo Skins, &c. ?Large, sound, fresh
Skins have found a steady market at from lOd.
to 13d. per lb.; inferior and medium Skins are
somewhat neglected at from 3d. to lOd. per lb.;
W r allaby Skins find a market at from sd. to B|d.
per lb., if in good condition. Tails should be re-
moved from both classes of Skins.

Opossum Skins, &c.? The season is rapidly
drawing to a close, and the bulk of the Skins
offering now are poorly furred. Buyers are curtail-
ing operations, and can hardly be induced to take
any but choice lots. We quote ;?Superior Skins,
from 4s. 3d. to 4s. 9d. per dozen ; average do., from
3s. to 4s. 3d. per dozen ; inferior do., from Is. to 3s.
per dozen. Rabbit Skins are not much sought
after, and only choice lots find a sure market; our
quotations range from Bd. to 15d. per dozen.
Leather. ?We have not held a sale since our
last report, but find a good inquiry at late rates.
Our next sale will be held to-morrow, at half-past
two, and we anticipate active competition. We
quote : ?Crop, from 9d.to lid. per lb.; Kip, from Is.
to Is. 6d. per lb.; Calf, 2s. to 2s. lOd. per lb.;
Wallaby, 2s. to 2s. 3d. per lb.; Harness, lid. to
14|d. per lb.; Basils, 10s. to 20s. per dozen.
Tallow. ?We held a sale on Monday last, and
disposed of a large catalogue at late rates. The
tone of the market is firm, but no advance on late
rates was secured, buyers operating with caution,
owing to the uncertain tone of the London market
and the difficulty of securing freight. We quote :
Best Mutton, f.0.b., up to �2B 10s. per ton ; best
Beef, f.0.b., up to �27 10s. per ton ; average Mutton,
from �26 to �2B per ton ; average Beef, from �25

ton ; inferior, from �lB to �22 per ton.

Melbourne, 10 th November , 1880.
Wheat.? We catalogued 2835 bags Grain for
cur sale to-day, and have sold, privately and by
public auction, since our last report 1576 bags.
At our sale to-day there was a large attendance
of buyers, both for export and local consumption,
and prices advanced fully 2d. per bushel on our
last week?s rates, the news received by cable-
gram of the failure of the Russian crops having,
no doubt, caused higher rates to rule. We quote ;
?Prime Milling Wheat, 4s. 3d. to 4s. 4d.; medium
to good, 3s. lid. to 4s. 2�d.; and inferior to
medium, 3s. 4d. to 3s. lOd. per bushel.
Flour. ?All good country brands are saleable
at �9 2s. 6d., and town-milled, �9 10s. sterling per
ton.
Oats. ?We report a better tone in this market,
and note an advance of one penny per bushel on
last week?s rates, the bulk of our catalogue sub-
mitted yesterday being readily quitted at quota-
tions, viz.:?Prime Milling, 2s. 7d.; prime Feed,
2s. 3d.; medium to good, Is. lid. to 2s. 2d.;
inferior to medium, Is. Bd. to Is. 10|d. per bushel,
Barley. ?We offered a full catalogue at auction
to-day, but did not secure many sales, owing, no
doubt, to the inferior condition in which the
farmers send in their produce ; and we would
recommend our friends to see that their grain is
properly cleaned before forwarding. We quote ;
Prime Milling, 45.; medium to good, 3s. 3s. to
3s. 9d.; inferior to medium, 2s. 9d. to 3s. 2d.; Cape
and Oregon, Is. lOd. to Is. lid. per bushel.
Peas, at the present, are dull of sale.

bales, of which 669 bales were sold, inferior to
good average Greasy realising 7d. to llfd. per lb.
The large sample rooms in our new warehouse
enable us to show each bale and bag in a clip ;
consequently the buyers can see each lot complete,
and thus be enabled to arrive at exact valuations.
Melbourne, \lth November t 1880.
WOOL.?We catalogued 3703 bales for our sale
to-day, and sold, by public auction and private
contract, 3106 bales*. There was a full attendance
r T % of buyers, and for all good to superior lots com-
petition was very spirited, and high rates were
obtained. Inferior to ordinary descriptions and
small clips were scarcely so firm, and must be
quoted a shade lower. We sold Greasy at from
fiid.to 13gd., the latter price being obtained for
69 bales from the Retreat Estate, also for 51
bales from the Benambra Station, near Albury.
We also sold J.H. over Eagle?s Nest, 22 bales,
at 13d.; T.K., 46, at 12fd.; J.R., 25, at 13d.; Per-
ricoota, 77, at 12|d,; Burryjaa, 20, at 12|-d.; G.T.8.,
134, at 12� d.; W. over Tulla, 48, at 12|d.; Mur-
rabit, 287, at lid.; Yalgogrin, 138, at lid., &c.
Prices for inferior to good average Washed Fleece
and Scoured ranged from 13d. to 21|d., latter
price for 79 bales from Moorara Station, River
Darling. Brung Brungle, 28 bales, sold at 21 Jd.;
Emu Plains, 20|d.; R.R. in diamond, 20d.; A. Tobin
over Wingadee, 21d.; and others in proportion.
Sheepskins? Our sales held during the past
week were fully supplied, and we cleared out full
catalogues to the local trade at quotations. Dry
Skins have not found a keen inquiry, but late
rates were maintained. We quote : ?Butchers?
Green Pelts, up to 2s. 3d. each,; do. Green Skins,
from 4s. to 6s. 6d. each ; do. Dry Pelts, up to 2s.
each ; do. Dry Skins, from Bs. to 6s. each ; Dry
Skins, at per lb., 3d. to 7�d.
Hides. ?We cleared full catalogues at about
late rates. The tone of the market has been
rather flat, and business was active only in choice
lots. We are glad to note that offal is in most
cases removed by vendors now; and this has had
a marked effect on sales, which are more readily
secured, and superior Hides have been quitted with
little difficulty. Face-pieces, legs, &c., should in
every case be removed by vendors, and Hides
should be well salted and kept as clean as possible.
Shipments from other colonies have been scarce,
but a good inquiry exists for heavy weights in
good condition. We quote: ?Green Ox-hides,
from 18s. to 235. each ; do. Cow, from 14s. to 17s.
each ; Victorian-salted (superior), from 4d. to
per lb.; average, from 3Jd. to 4d. per lb.; in-
ferior, from 2�d. to 3�d. per lb.; Kips, from 3d.
to per lb.; Calfskins, from to sd. per lb.;
New Zealand heavy weights, 4d. to 4|d. per lb.
Kangaroo Skins, &c. ?There is a good
?demand for large, sound, fresh Skins, at from lOd,
to 13d. per lb. The supply, however, now consists
of Skins of inferior and average quality, and as the
season is far advanced, the demand is not good,
and few buyers are in the market. Skins of
inferior to average quality rule from 3|d. to lOd.
per lb.; Wallaby are in fair request, if good, at
from sd. to B�d. per lb.
Opossum Skins, &c. ?The supply offering is
limited, and few Skins are well furred. The
season is drawing to a close, most regular
buyers having ceased operations for the season.
We are selling superior from 4s. to 4s. 6d. per
dozen ; average, from 3s. to 4s. per dozen ; inferior,
Trom Is. to 3s. per dozen. Rabbit Skins do not
meet with much inquiry ; superior lots are sale-
able at from lOd. to 15d. per dozen ; inferior and
average Skins are neglected at from 4d. to lOd,

Leather. ?We have sold a full supply at satis-
factory prices, and report a steady demand at

Tallow. ?Our latest advices from the London
market show a steady market at late quotations;
but a corresponding forward movement has not
taken place here, shippers being unable to find
freight. The tone of the market, however, is firm,
and at our sale held yesterday we placed a large
?catalogue without difficulty, the local manufac-
turers operating vigorously at quotations, viz.;?

WOOL.? We held our usual sale of small clips to-
day, and catalogued 755 bales and 290 sacks,
divided into 446 lots. There was an excellent
attendance of buyers, and all good lots, both
Merino and Crossbred, were firm, but inferior to
ordinary descriptions ruled a shade lower, buyers
having evidently reduced their limits for these
sorts. Each bale and bag commanded full com-
petition. Prices ranged from 7Jd. to 12d. per lb.,

Sheepskins.?We sold a full supply, and report
a steady market at quotations. There is, however,
not such keen inquiry for Dry Skins, felimongers,
as is usual at this season of the year, devoting
most of their attention to Wool. Prices for this
class of Skins have therefore suffered a slight de-
cline. We quote Butchers? Green Pelts, at
prices ranging up to 2s. 6d. each; do. Green Skins,
from 4s. to 6s. 6d. each ; do. Dry Pelts, at prices
ranging up to 2s. each ; do. Dry Skins, from 3s.

Hides. ?The tone of the market is steady, and
late rates have been firmly maintained. The supply
consists chiefly of local produce, but a few ship-
ments of Queensland and South Australian heavies
have been placed at from 4d. to 4|d. per lb. New
Zealand Hides have not been offering, the current
value being too low, apparently, to induce business.
Face-pieces, pates, legs, &c., should be removed
by vendors, as the presence of offal has a pre-
judicial effect on sales. We quote :?Green Ox-
hides (average sizes), from 18s. to 28s. 6d. each ;
do. Cow (do.), from 14s. to 17s. 6d. each ; Vic-
torian-salted (superior), from 4d. to 4Jd. per lb.;
average, from 3�d. to 4d. per lb.; inferior, from
2�d. to 3�d. per lb.; Kips, from 3d. to per
lb.; and Calfskins, from 3�d. to sd. per lb.
Kangaroo Skins, &c.?There is a fair
demand for large, sound, fresh Skins, at from lOd.
to 13d. per lb.; inferior and average Skins are
somewhat neglected, as most of the buyers have
ceased active operations for the season. Wallaby
Skins, if in good condition, are saleable at from
6d. to per lb.
Opossum Skins, &c. ?There is little business
doing, as the season has almost closed, and most
Skins now offering are poorly furred. Superior
lots have had some attention at from 4s. to 4s. 9d.
per dozen ; inferior and average are moved with
difficulty at from Is. to 4s. per dozen. Rabbit Skins,
if well saved, find a market at from lOd. to 15d,
per dozen ; but few consignments are offering,
and the demand is by no means brisk.
Leather.? Our sale was well attended, and we
sold a full supply at about late rates. The tone of
the market is slightly weaker, inferior parcels
being more difficult to realise, but superior lots
found a steady inquiry at quotations, namely :
Crop, 9d.to lid. per lb.; Kip, Is, to Is. 6d. per lb.;
Calf, 2s. to 2s. lOd. per lb.; Wallaby, 2s. to 2s. 3d.
per lb.; Waxed Kangaroo, 2s. to 2s. 6d. per lb.;
Brown Kangaroo, Is, lOd. to 2s. 3d. per lb,; Har-
ness, lid. to 14d. per lb.; Basils, 10s. to 20s. per
dozen.
Tallow.? Our sale held yesterday lapsed in
consequence of the holiday, the attendance of
buyers being very sparse; but late rates are current,
and the demand on local account is steady. Our
latest advices from London show a decline in
values ; but our market will not be affected
thereby, as shippers are inactive, in consequence
of the high rate of freight ruling ; the fluctuations
in the London market have also induced caution,
and until more favourable conditions offer busi-
ness for shipment must necessarily be limited.
We quote : ?Average Mutton, from �26 ss. to �2B
per ton ; do. Beef, �25 se. to �26 10s. per ton;
Mixed, �22 to �26 per ton; inferior, �lB to �22
per ton. Shipping parcels are nominally worth :
Mutton, to �2B 10s. per ton ; Beef, to �27 per ton

Melbourne, 2Wi November , 1880.
Wheat.? We catalogued 3742 bags of Grain
for our sale to-day, and have sold, privately and
by public auction, 3355 bags since our last report.
At the sale to-day there was an exceedingly large
attendance of buyers, both for export and local
consumption, the demand being principally for
export, local manufacturers bring at present fairly
supplied ; and should to-day?s prices continue to
rule, no doubt English and foreign buyers will
operate witb caution. We quote:?Prime Milling
Wheat, 4s. 3�d.; medium to good, 4s. to 4s. 3d.;
and inferior to medium, 3s. Bd. to 3s. llld. per
bushel.
Flour. ?All good country brands find ready
purchasers at from �9 7s. 6d. to �9 10s., and
town-milled, �9 15s. sterling ton.
Oats. ?We report a much better tone in this
market, and good sound parcels find ready pur-
chasers at an advance of fully Id. per bushel on
last week?s rates. We now quote : ?Prime Milling,
2s. 7d. to 2s. Bd.; prime Feed, 2s. 6d.; medium to
good, 2s. 3d. to 2s, s|d.; and inferior to medium,
Is. lid. to 2s. 2d. per bushel.
Barley.? We offered a large catalogue at
auction to-day, and report a rather weak market,
maltsters being fairly supplied, many of them
having already ceased operation for the season.
We quote ; ?Prime Malting, 35.; medium to good,
2s. Bd. to 2s. lid.; inferior to medium, 2s. to
2s. 7d.; Cape and Oregon, Is. lid. to 2s. o�d. per
bushel.
Maize.?We disposed of several parcels at
from 3s. id. to 3s. l|d. per bushel.
Bran.?We obtained 9�d. per bushel for a fair
sample ; and Pollard is worth Bd. per bushel.
Peas.?For a very ordinary sample we obtained
2s. 3|d., whilst prime are worth from 2s, 6d. to
2s. 7d. per bushel.

GOLDSBROUGH?S WOOL WAREHOUSES,
M elbourne, 29 th November, 1880.
WOOL.?We held our usual sale of small clips to-
Uay, and catalogued 808 bales and 291. sacks,
?divided into 490 lots. There was a full attendance
of the trade, and good competition, inferior to good
average Greasy realising 7d. to 12d., and ordinary
Fleece up to 17Jd. per lb., the prices obtained
being about equal to last week?s rates for good
clips ? but inferior were scarcely so firm, and must
again be quoted a shade easier. In all, 707 bales
and 291 sacks were sold.
Melbourne, Isf December, 1880.
WOOL,?We catalogued 5741 bales for our sale
to-day, but offered only the Greasy and Scoured,
the Washed Fleece, consisting of 1042 bales, being
reserved for auction to-morrow. There was a
large attendance of buyers, but a decidedly easier
feeling was manifest, owing to the less favourable
telegrams from England and the Continent which
are daily being received, and which are having a
depressing effect. Good clips sold at within a
shade of late rates, but inferior to average descrip-
tions were a half-penny to three farthings lower,
and we took in a number of clips rather than sell
at this reduction before we had communicated
with owners. In all, we sold 3257 bales at auction
and by private contract during the week, Greasy
realising 7d. to 13jd., the latter price being
obtained for 174 bales from the Geraldra Station.
Wc sold : ?WHB, 36 bales,at 13d.; AlAoverYarra
Yarra, 212 bales, realised 12d.; Morven, 45 bales,
12Jd.; EG over Walbundrie, 37, at 12Jd.; BS, 57,
at lid.: Buckingbong, 459, at and others
in proportion. Scoured ranged from 13d. to
2s. l�d., the latter price being obtained for 50
bales branded Como.
Sheepskins.?Our sales have been well sup-
plied, but the general tone of the market was
easier, and late rates have given way. Fell-
mongers are operating chiefly in Wool at present,
hence the weak tone of our sales ; there is, however,
a fair business doing at quotations, and Skins of
average to good quality find a steady market.
Butchers? Green Pelts realised up to 2s. 7d,
each; do. Dry do., 2s. 2d. each ; Dry Skins, at
per lb., from 3d. to 7d. Full-woolled Skins are
offering in limited quantities, and are saleable at
prices ranging from 3s. to 6s. 3d. each.
Hides.?Our sales have been fully supplied
with local produce, and full rates were readily
obtainable, prime lots finding buyers at ad-
vanced rates. Shipments from other colonies
have been scarce ; but the demand is good for
heavies in good condition, and an advance of
about Jd. per lb. has taken place, good parcels
being sought after at from 4Jd. to 4|d. per lb.
Face-pieces, pates, legs, &0., should be removed
by vendors ; Hides should also be well salted and
kept clean, lots in good condition attracting
most attention. Green Ox-hides (average sizes),
realised from 18s. to 28s. 6d. each ; do. Cow (do.),
from 14s. 6d. to 18s. each ; Victorian-salted
{superior), from 4d. to 4Jd. per lb.; average,
from 3Jd. to 4d. per lb.; inferior, from 2Jd. to
3-pd. per lb.; Kips, from 3d. to 3|d. per lb.; Calf-
skins, from 3Jd. to sd. per lb.
Kangaroo Skins, Ac,?Large, sound, fresh
Skins, in good condition, find a good demand at
from lOd. to 13d. per lb. Very few superior lots
are offering now, and the season is almost ended.
Wallaby Skins have sold at from Ed to 8)d.

20s. per dozen.
Tallow.?The demand is limited, and is chiefly
on local account, shippers being inactive in con-
sequence of high rate of freight and scarcity ;
vendors, also, of best brands are unwilling to
accept current rates. At our sale held yesterday
we offered a large catalogue, and found great
difficulty in securing satisfactory sales, the local
manufacturers taking all disposed of at quota-
tions, viz.:?Average Mutton, from �26 to �2B
per ton ; do. Beef, �25 to �26 ss. per ton ; Mixed,
�22 to �25 15s. per ton ; inferior, �lB to �22 per
ton. Nominal quotations for shipping parcels
are:?Mutton, to �2B 10s. per ton ; Beef, to �27

Melbourne, 2 nd December, 1880.
WOOL. ?We catalogued 1042 bales of Washed
Fleece to-day, which had been held over from
yesterday, and had an excellent attendance of
buyers and good competition, prices ruling close
up to last week?s rates. We sold at from 14d. to
2s. 6d. per lb., the latter price being obtained for
a choice bale from Melville Forest, intended
for exhibition. Amongst the prices realised
were C and S over ROSEBROOK, 61 bales,
at 2s. OJd. ; Y in heart, 6 bales, at 21d, ;
BRUNG BRUNGLE. 48, at 20Jd.; MORRIGE,
39, at 19Jd.; KYEAMBA, 111, at 19Jd.; ROSS
over YALLOCK, 16, at 18d., &c. We have also
sold; 474 bales bought in from our sale of
yesterday, including A ROSS, 98 greasy, at lljd.;
JH over TOOYAL, 173, at lljd.; CODTTS
BROS over POWLETT, 82 at lid., &c., thus
making a total of 5247 bales sold by us this week.

Wheat.?We catalogued 2372 bags of Grain
for our sale to-day, and have sold, privately and
by public auction, 2604 bags since our last report.
At the sale to-day there was a very large attend-
ance of buyers, both for export and local con-
sumption. The tone of the market was firm at
our last week?s rates, notwithstanding the con-
tinued heavy arrivals from the inland districts.
This, no doubt, is owing to several large orders
which have been received to purchase Wheat for

Flour.?The price of Wheat being fully main-

for this staple, and quote well-known country
brands at from �9 7s. 6d. to �9 10s., and town-
milled, �9 15s. sterling per ton.
Oats. ?There is a good demand for all classes
of Oats, with an upward tendency, and tor superior

Barley.?Our sales have been well supplied
during the past week. The new Barley is fast
arriving into store, but the quality so far is not
good, and the bulk will have to be sold for feed
purposes. We quote ;?Prime Malting, 35.;

GOLDSBROUGH?S WOOL WAREHOUSES,
Melbourne, 6th December, 1880.
WOOL.?We held our usual sale of small clips
to-day, and had a full attendance of buyers. The
catalogue included 492 bales and 185 sacks,
divided into 313 lots; and 442 bales and 182
sacks were sold, inferior to good average Greasy
ranging from 7|d. to llfd., and inferior to
ordinary washed 13d. to 15fd. per lb. Fair con-
ditioned lots were about same as last week, but
inferior were a shade easier.
Melbourne, Bth December, 1880.
WOOL.?We catalogued 5547 bales for our sale
to-day, and offered 3699 bales of Greasy and
Scoured, the Washed fleece, consisting of 1848
bales, being reserved for auction to-morrow.
There was a full attendance of buyers, and brisk
competition, prices being firm at about last
week?s rates. In all, we sold 3052 bales at
auction and by private contract, Greasy ranging
from 7Jd. to 13fd? the latter price being ob-
tained for 15 bales from the Albury dis-
trict, branded T MAGUIRE. Other lots also
sold well, including JR,4O bales, at 13|d.; QUORN
over ED in block, 53 bales (from Tasmania), 13d.;
LE in diamond over WALL4NDOOL, 198, atl2id.;
KING, 91, at 12|d.; CATHKIN, 24, at 12id.; RE
over bar, 151, at 12d.; OSB over COLOMBO, 73, at
ll|d.; KULNINE, 195, at 10) d., &c. Scoured
ranged to 22Jd., including B over NARROW
PLAINS, 41, at 21d. to 22Jd.; OSB over MOMA-
LONG, 35 scoured pieces, at 19d.; RR, 25 broken,
at 19Jd.
Sheepskins.?We have found difficulty in
placing the supply offering during the past week
at quotations, as the rather flat tone of the Wool
market has somewhat affected the value of Skins.
Fellmongers also are giving most of their attention
to Wool; consequently our sales dragged through,
and late rates were with difficulty maintained.
There is, however, a fair demand for Skins of
average to superior quality. We quote Butchers?
Green Pelts at prices ranging up to 2s. 7d. each ;
do. Dry do., at prices ranging up to 2s. 4d. each;
Dry Skins, at per lb., from 3Jd. to 7d. Full-
woolled Skins are now scarce, and are readily sale-
able at prices ranging from 3s. to 6s. 3d. each.
Hides.?The tone of the market has been
steady throughout the week, and a brisk business
has been done at quotations. All classes of Hides
have met with attention, and a good inquiry exists
for New Zealand heavies in good condition. Ven-
dors are requested to remove offal?comprising
face-pieces, legs, &c.?from Hides, as its presence
has a prejudicial effect on the sales. Hides should
also be kept clean, and should be well salted, con-
signments in saleable condition attracting most
attention. Our quotations are :?Green Ox (aver-
age sizes), from 18s. to 28s. 6d. each; do. Cow, do.
from 15s. to 19s. each; Victorian-salted (superior),
4d. to 4gd. per lb.; average, 3Jd. to 4d. per lb.;
inferior, 2�d. to 3Jd. per lb.; Kips, 3d. to 3|d.
per lb.; Calfskins, 3Jd. to sd. per lb.
Kangaroo Skins.?Large, sound, fresh Skins,
In good condition, find a good demand at from
lOd. to 13d. per lb.; inferior Skins are neglected.
The season has waned, and business will not revive
before next winter.
Opossum Skins, &c.?Late rates have been
maintained, and superior lots have met with a
fair inquiry at quotations; the season has almost
-closed, and none but superior Skins find a sure
market. Very few Skins are well furred at
present, and summer Skins are not much sought
after. Superior lots are saleable at from 4s. to
4s. 9d. per dozen; average, from 2s. to 4s. per
dozen.
Leather.?We have sold a full supply at about
late rates ; the tone of the market is rather flat,
but choice parcels have found a moderate inquiry.
Our sales have been supplied chiefly with Crop,
Kip, and Basils, and quotations are : ?Crop, 9d. to
lid, per lb.; Kip, Is. to Is, 6d. per lb.; Calf, 2s. to
;2s. lOd. per lb.; Wallaby, 2s. to 2s. 3d. per lb.;
Waxed Kangaroo, 2s. to 2s. 6d. per lb.; Brown
Kangaroo, Is. lOd. to 2s. 3d. per lb.; Harness, lid.
to 14d. per lb.; Basils, 10s. to 20s. per dozen.
Tallow.?The demand is chiefly on local ac-
count, shippers being precluded from operating,
except to a limited extent, in consequence of the
high rate of freight ruling, and the few vessels on
the berth. The local manufacturers are not opera-
ting vigorously, apparently being fully supplied,
but the bulk of the supply offering can be placed
at quotations without difficulty. Few of the
best brands are offering, vendors being un-
willing to accept current rates. We quote :
Average Mutton, from �26 to �2B per ton ; do.
Beef, from �25 to �26 ss. per ton ; Mixed, �22 to
.�25 10s. per ton ; inferior, �lB to �22 per ton.
Shipping parcels can find buyers at?Mutton, to
�2B 7s. 6d. per ton ; Beef, �26 15s. per ton.
Melbourne, 9 th December, 1880.
WOOL.?To-day we offered 1848 bales Washed
Fleece Wool, and had a full attendance and
spirited competition, last week?s rates being well
sustained. Prices ranged from 13d. to 24|d., the
latter price being realised for DG over OOLIBAN
PARK, 63 bales. We also sold, amongst others,
C&S overGLBNISLA, 210 bales, at 24|d.; S&W
over J over SANDFORD, 17, at 23Jd.; NYHAN,
23, at 20d.; ECP over WAGGA, 124, at I9jd.; MO,

Wheat. ?We catalogued 2963 bags of Grain
for our sale to-day, and have sold, privately and by
public auction. 2271 bags since our last report.
At the sale to-day there was a very large attend-
ance of buyers, both for export and local consump-
tion ; but a decidedly easier feeling was manifest,
owing to the unfavourable news received by
cablegram from England quoting Wheat Is. per
quarter lower. We quote : ?Prime Wheat, 4s. 2d.

chasers at from �9 7s. 6d. to �9 10s.; and town-

demand for all sorts. We quote :?Prime Milling,

Barley.?Our sales have been fairly supplied

forward freely, but the bulk of it is very uneven,
and will have to be sold for feed purposes. We

Wheat. ?We catalogued 2963 bags of Grain
for our sale to-day, and have sold, privately and by
public auction, 2271 bags since our last report.
At the sale to-day there was a very large attend-
ance of buyers, both for export and local consump-
tion ; but a decidedly easier feeling was manifest,
owing to the unfavourable news received by
cablegram from England quoting Wheat Is. per
?quarter lower. We quote : ?-Prime Wheat, 4s. 2d.

chasers at from �9 7s. 6d. to �9 10s.; and town-
milled, �lO sterling per ton.
Oats. ?Late quotations are current, with a good
demand for all sorts. We quote Prime Milling,

3d. to 2s. 6d.; and inferior to medium, Is. 9d. to

Barley.?Our sales have been fairly supplied
during the week. The new Barley is now coming
forward freely, but the bulk of it is very uneven,
and will have to be sold for feed purposes. We
quote:?Prime Malting, 3s. 2d.; medium to good,

WOOL.? e held our usual sale of small lots to-
day, and ad a full attendance of buyers and
brisk competition for each lot. The catalogue
included 431 bales and 272 sacks, of which 387
bales and 269 sacks were sold, inferior to fair
average Greasy realising 7d. to ll|d., and in-
ferior fleece to per lb. Prices ruled about
same as last week, except as regards strong Cross-
breds, which are a shade easier, on account of the
English telegrams.
elbouhnb, 1577/ December, 1880.
WOOL.?We catalogued 3267 bales for our sale
to-day, and had an excellent attendance of buyers
and good competition for each lot offered. The
list included several clips of crossbred, which sold
very fairly, considering the English advices?
Greasy ranging from 7d. to llfd., the latter price
for 63 bales from Doogallook Station, and Washed
13d. to J7�d., latter price for 36 bales from Cheviot
Hills. Merino ranged from 7d. to 12|d., the
latter for 76 bales from Cudgewa Station, and
fleece, 13d. to 24d., the latter being obtained
for Glenisla, also for a portion of Mr. Jackson?s,
from Sandford. Scoured Fleece ranged from 17d.
to 22d,, the latter price for 18 bales from the
Gelam Station. Amongst other lots sold were
J & TH over CHEVIOT HILLS, 45 Greasy, at
12d.; MUNTHAM, 74, at lljd.; NANGEELA,
21 do., at 10|d.; WAover CG, 22 do., at 10Jd., &o.
In Fleece, Sx B over TEN MILE GREEK sold at
20id.; S & W over J, 23d.; DO, 20d.; CMK (con-
joined) over WOREOUGH, at 18d., &c. In all,
2288 bales were sold at auction and by private
contract.
Sheepskins.?We have disposed of a moderate
supply at about late rates. The tone of the market
is weak, and late rates were with difficulty main-
tained ; only choice lots being readily saleable.
The attendance of buyers at our sales has been
limited, the Wool sales attracting most attention
at this season of the year. We quote Butchers?
Green Pelts at prices ranging up to 2s. each ; do.
Dry Pelts, at prices ranging up to Is. 9d. each;
Dry Skins, at per lb., from 3d. to 6Jd. Full-
woolled Skins are very scarce now, and find ready
buyers at prices ranging from 2s. 6d. to 6s. 9d.
each.
Hides. ?Late rates were current throughout
the past week, and we have sold a heavy supply
at quotations. The tone of the market is steady
at late rates, and all classes of Hides meet with
good inquiry'; best qualities, as usual, however,
meet with most favour. Heavy weights from
other colonies, if in good condition, attract atten-
tion, and are readily saleable at from 4d. to 4fd.
per lb. Shipments of light Hides are not in re-
quest, and uneven parcels in bad condition (short
salted, &c.) meet with no favour in this market.
Vendors are reminded to remove offal?such as
face-pieces, legs, &o.; also to keep Hides as clean as
possible, and to salt them sufficiently. We quote :
?Green Ox (average sizes), from 18s. 6d. to 28s. 6d.
each; do. Cow, do.,from 15s. to 19s. each;Victorian-
salted (superior), 4d. to 4gd. per lb,; average,
SJd. to 4d. per lb.; inferior, 2Jd. to 3Jd. per
lb.; Kips, 3d. to 3|d. per lb.; Calfskins, 3Jd. to
sd. per lb.
Kangaroo Skins.?Large, sound, fresh Skins,
in good condition, find a good inquiry at from
lOd. to 13d. per lb.; inferior and average Skins are
somewhat neglected, as there are few buyers
operating at present. Wallaby Skins, if in good
condition, are saleable at from 5Jd. to BJd. per lb.
Opossum Skins, &c. ?Well-furred Skins con-
tinue to find a steady market at quotations, but
business is limited, as few well-furred Skins are
obtainable at this season of 'the year, and most of
the regular buyers have ceased operations for some
months to come. Superior lots are selling ao from
4s. to 4s. 9d. per dozen. Rabbit Skins, if of good
size and quality, are saleable at from lOd. to Isd.
per dozen, but the demand is not good, few Skins
at this season being well-furred.
Leather.?Late rates are current, and there is
a fair demand at quotations, viz,: ?Crop, 9d, to
lid, per lb.; Kip, is. to Is. 6d. per lb.; Calf, 2a. to
2s. lOd. per lb.; Wallaby, 2s. to 2s. 6d. per lb.;
Waxed Kangaroo, 2s. to 2s. 6d. per lb.; Brown
Kangaroo, Is. lOd. to 2s. 3d. per lb.; Harness, lid,
to 14d. per lb.; Basils, 10s. to 20s. per dozen.
Tallow.?A full supply has been offering, the
bulk of which has been placed on local account at
late rates. The demand for shipment is limited,
in consequence of the high freights ruling, and
vendors of best brands are with difficulty induced
to accept the low prices offering. The following
quotations are current:?Average Mutton, from
�26 to �27 12s. 6d. per ton ; do. Beef, from �25
to �26 per ton ; Mixed, �22 to �25 10s. per ton ;
inferior, �lB to �22 per ton. Shipping parcels
find moderate inquiry at Mutton, to �2B per
ton ; Beef, �26 15s. per ton.

Wheat, ?We catalogued 3011 bags of Grain
for our sale to-day, and have sold, privately and by
public auction; 2441 bags since our last report.
At the sale to-day there was an exceedingly large
attendance of buyers, both for export and local
consumption; but a decidedly easier feeling was
manifest, owing to the less favourable telegrams
received from England. Good samples sold at
within a shade of late rates, but inferior to
average descriptions were fully 2d. per bushel
lower. We quote : ?Prime Milling Wheat, 4s. 2d. J
medium to good, 3s. lOd. to 4s. Id. ; and inferior
to medium, 3s. 6d. to 3s. 9|d. per bushel.
Flour.?All good country brands are saleable
at [�9 55.; and town-milled, �9 10s. sterling per

Oats.?The tone of the market has been steady
-throughout the week, and a brisk business has
been done at quotations. All classes of Oats
have met with attention, and a good demand
exists. We quote:?Prime Milling, 2s. lid.;
prime Feed, 2s. Bd.; medium to good, 2s. 6d. to
2s. 7d.; and inferior to medium, 2s. to 2s. 4d. per
bushel.
Barley.?We have sold a full supply, at
slightly advanced rates. The new Barley is now
coming forward freely, and owing to prime
parcels for malting being scarce, prices hardened
about 2d. per bushel. We quote:?Prime Malting,
3s. 9Jd.; medium to good, 3s. 3d. to 3s. 6d.; in-
ferior to medium, 2s. sd. to 3s. 2d.; Cape and
Oregon, Is. 1 id. to 2s. Id. per bushel.

WOOL.?We catalogued 3894 bales for our sale
to-day, and had an excellent attendance of buyers
and brisk competition up to fully late rates.
?Greasy ranged from 7d. to 12fd., the latter price
beingobtained for 25 bales from Tasmania, branded
ED in square; 45 bales crossbred, same brand,
sold at llfd. Amongst those sold were WHW
over LITTLE BILLABONG, 42, at llgd.; JR

lOd.; JD over ARDNO. 54, at 9|d., &c. Scoured
ranged from 12d. to 21d., the latter price being
obtained for TMY, 56 bales, from the Darling.
WINGADEE pieces, 24 bales, sold at 17fd.;
TINAPAGE pieces, 150, at 13|d.; OSB over
MOMALONG, 30 bellies, at 14|d.; 29 Locks, at
12fd,, &c. Inferior to average Washed Fleece
ranged from 13d. to 18|d. per pound. In all, 2560
bales were sold.
Sheepskins. ?Our sales have chiefly comprised
Green Pelts, and little business has been done,
both vendors and buyers having apparently sus-
pended active operations during the holidays.
The tone of the market has been flat, and the bulk
of our sales have not exceeded Is. lOd. per Pelt.
Full-woolled Skins are scarce. We quote ;
Butchers? Green Pelts, from 9d. to 2s. each ; But-
chers? Dry Pelts, from 6d. to Is, 7d. each ; Dry
Skins, at per pound, 3d. to 6fd.; full-woolled
Skins, from 3s. to ss. 9d. each.
Hides. ?Quotations have ruled lower during
the holidays, chiefly in consequence of the sparse
attendance of buyers, and supplies have almost
been confined to green produce. No doubt a
better tone will prevail when business has been
actively resumed. Vendors are reminded to
remove offal, comprising face pieces, legs, &c.; also
to use sufficient salt, and keep Hides as clean as
possible. Parcels in good saleable condition attract
most attention. We quote : ?Green Ox, average
sizes, from 18s. to 275. 6d. each ; Green Cow,
average sizes, from 13s. to 17s. each.; Victorian-
salted, superior, 3|d. to 4fd.perlb.; average, 3fd.
to 3fd. per lb.; inferior, 2fd. to per lb.; Kips,
2fd. to 3d. per lb.; Calfskins, 3|d. to sd. per lb.
New Zealand parcels, in good condition, have been
placed at from 3|d. to 4fd. per lb.; but consign-
ments coming to this market are few.
Kangaroo, Wallaby, Opossum Skins, &c.?
Large, fresh, sound Kangaroo Skins meet with a
fair demand at from 9d. to 12d. per lb.; Wallaby
Skins, sd. to Bd. per lb.; well-furred Opossum
Skins, 3s.to 4s. 6d. per dozen ; Rabbit Skins, 6d. to
12d. per dozen. All classes of furred Skins are
neglected at this season of the year, only prime
lots finding a moderate inquiry at remunerative
prices. Active operations will not be resumed
before next winter.
Leather.? The market is steady at quotations,
viz:?Crop, 9d. to lid. per lb.; Kip, Is. to Is. 6d.
per lb.; Calf, 2s. to 2s. 9d. per lb.; Wallaby, 2s. to
2s. 6d. per lb.; Waxed Kangaroo, 2s. to 2s. 6d. per
lb.; Brown Kangaroo, Is. lOd. to 2s. 3d. per lb.;
Harness, lid. to 13d. per lb.; Basils, 10s. to 20s.
per dozen.
Tallow. ?No business has been done in the
open market during the holidays, but we have
effected a few sales by private contract at satisfac-
tory prices. Our auction sale held yesterday
lapsed in consequence of the limited attendance,
and our quotations as below can be accepted as
nominal value only. The inquiry still continues
on local account, but business has not yet recovered
from the effect of the holidays. Quotations of
actual sales are Average Mutton, from �26 to
�27 per ton ; do. Beef, �25 to �25 10s. do.; Mixed,
�22 to �25 do.; best Mutton, f.0.b., to �27 10s. do.;

WEEKLY REPORT.
GOLDSBROUGH?S WOOL WAREHOUSES,
Melbourne, 2nd February, 1881.
WOOL.?We did not hold an auction sale this
week, as the quantity coming forward is limited-
Prices are well maintained, and we shall bring
forward a full catalogue at our sale next week.
Sheepskins, ?We disposed of a full supply
during the past week at satisfactory prices. The
tone of the market is steady, and a good demand
exists for all classes of Skins. Our catalogues
have chiefly comprised Pelts, supplied by town
and country butchers, very few Dry Skins in
bales and bundles having reached us lately. The
following quotations are current�utchers?
Green Pelts, from Is. to 2s. 3d. each; Butchers?*
Dry Pelts, 6d. to Is. 9d. each ; Dry Skins, at
per lb., 3d. to 6fd. Full-woolled Skins when
offering find a steady market at from 3s. to ss. 9d,
each.
Hides. ?This market is slightly easier, and
difficulty has been experienced in placing supplies
offering at late rates. At present there is a
steady demand at quotations, which probably will
continue, the depression being chiefly in faulty
lots. Hides in good saleable condition?viz. , free
from offal, clean, and well-salted?find a sleady
demand at quotations; and New Zealand heavy
weights are sought after, but are not offering freely.
We quote : ?Green Ox, average sizes, from 17s. to
265, each ; Green Cow, average sizes, from IBs,
to 15s. 6d. each.; Victorian salted, superior, 3|d*.
to d. per lb.; average, 3R to 3fd. per lb.;
inferior, 2R to 3�d. per lb.; New Zealand salted,
3|d. to 4|d. per lb. Kips and Calfskins, if in
good condition, have maintained late rates?viz..
Kips, 2fd. to 3R per lb.; Calfskins, 3Jd. to sd.
per lb.
Kangaroo, Wallaby, Opossum Skins, &c.
This maiket continues dormant, and only' a few
sales have taken place. No activity can be
expected until next winter, as there are few buyers
operating at present, and the quality of the Skins
obtainable at this season of the year is inferior.
The following quotations are current: ?Kangaroo
Skins, large, sound, and fresh, Bd. to lid. per lb.;
Wallaby do., do., sd. to Bd. per lb.; Opossum
Skins, well furred, 3s. to 4s. 6d. per dozen ;
Babbit Skins, do,, 6d. to 12d. per dozen.
Leather. ? The tone of the market is flat, and
business has been transacted with difficulty at
late rates, the slight depression in the London
market having affected ours to a certain extent.
We quote:?Crop, 9d. to lid. per lb.; Kip, Is. to
Is. 6d. per lb.; Calf, 2s. to 2s. 9d. per lb.; Wallaby,
2s. to 2s. 6d. per lb.; Waxed Kangaroo, 2s. to 2s.
6d. per lb.; Brown Kangaroo, Is. lOd. to 2s. 2d.
per lb.; Harness, lid. to 13d. per lb.; Basils, 10s.
to 20s. per dozen.
Tallow. ?We have sold a very heavy
supply during the past week, chiefly for shipment
to London, and report improved values. We sub-
mitted a limited catalogue at auction yesterday,
comprising average to good brands, the bulk of
which was taken up by the local trade. Most of
the sales effected during the week were by private
contract, and shipping parcels almost absorbed
the attention of buyers. We note a steady tone in
the London market, the recent advance having
evidently been maintained, and generally we
report a much better feeling than has prevailed
for some time past. Supplies continue heavy,
and we quote Average Mutton, from �25 10s-
to �27 15s. per ton; do. Beef, �24 10s. to �26 10s,
do.; Mixed, �22 10s. to �26 do.; inferior, �lB to
�22 10s. do. Shipping parcels?Mutton, to �2&
7s. 6d. per ton ; Beef, to �26 17s. 6d. do.

Melbourne, 2nd February, 1881.
Wheat. ?We catalogued 5181 bags of Grain
for our sale to-day, and have sold since our last
report, privately and by public auction, 6009 bags,.
We had an excellent attendance of buyers, and
brisk competition, every lot of Wheat offered
being disposed of at full rates, notwithstanding
the late news received by cablegram from England,
reporting a further decline in values. We quote :
Prime shipping parcels, 4s. Id.; prime Seed,
4s. 2d.; prime Milling, 4s. OR; medium to good,
3s. Bd. to 45.; and inferior to medium, 3s. Id. to
3s. 7d. per bushel.
Flour,?We have sold several parcels of
country brands at �8 17s. 6d. per ton, and quote
town-milled �9 ss. per ton.
Oats.? Late rates were well maintained, and
we sold a large supply at the following quota-
tions : ?Prime Milling, 35.; prime Feed, 2s. 7d.;
medium to good, 2s. 4R to 2s. 6d.; and inferior
to medium, 2s. 2d. to 2s. 4d. per bushel.
Maize. ?Owing to the heavy arrivals of Feeding
Grain, prices have receded fully 4d. per bushel.
We quote Seed Maize at 4s. OR, and good
Crushing 3s. Bd. per bushel.
Barley. ?We have been well supplied during
past week, and have sold several large parcels at
full rates. We quote :?Prime Malting, 3s. 7R;
medium to good, 3s. 3d. to 3s. 6d.; inferior to
medium, 2s. 4d. to 3s. 2d.; Cape and Oregon,

GOLDSBROUGH?S WOOL WAREHOUSES,
Melbourne, 9 th February , 1881.
WOOL. ?-We catalogued 1175 bales and 185 sack�
for our sales to-day, and had a full attendance of
buyers and brisk competition, the prices obtained
being quite up to late rates. The lets, as is usual
at the close of the season, were generally in.
inferior to ordinary condition, and a considerable
proportion were odd bales. One clip of Greasy
(120 bales), from New Zealand, realised 9|d,,
and a choice bale of Exhibition Wool, branded
CARAMUT, realised 2s. sd. per lb. Inferior to
average Greasy realised from 6d. to 10d.; and
Washed Fleece and Scoured, 12d. to 20d. per lb,
In all, 956 bales were sold.
Sheepskins. ?This market was well supplied
during the week, and late rates were readily
obtainable. The supplies now coming forward
consist almost entirely of Pelts in various stages
of growth. We quote:?Butchers? Green Pelts,
from Is. to 2s. 3d. each ; Butchers' Dry Pelts, 6d,
to Is. 9d. each ; Dry Skins, at per lb., 3d. to 6fd.
Hides,? Late rates were current, and we dis-
posed of a full supply at quotations. Hides in
good condition?viz., free from offal, well-salted,
and clean?find a steady inquiry,and New Zealand
heavy-weights are also in request. The tone of the
market is steady. We quote Green Ox, average
sizes, from 17s. to 265. 6d. each ; Green Cow,
average sizes, from 13s. to 15s. 6d. each ; Vic-
torian salted (superioi), 3Jd. to per lb.;,
average, Hid. to 3|d. per lb.; inferior, 2�d. to
3id. per lb.; New Zealand heavy weights, Hfd. to
4fd. per lb,; Kips, 2|d. to 3Jd. per lb.; Calfskins,
3Jd. to sd. per lb.
Kangaroo Skins, &c. ?The market for all
classes of furred Skins is very quiet, and no active
business may be expected for some months to
come. There is, however, a moderate demand
for choice parcels at quotations ; but there is very
little business doing, and few superior lots are
obtainable at this season of the year. The fol-
lowing prices are current for prime Skins, but
inferior lots are almost unsaleable: ?Kangaroo
Skins, large, sound, and fresh, Bd. to lid. per lb.;
Wallaby do., do., sd. to Bd. per lb.; Opossum
Skins, well furred, 3s. to 4s. 6d. per dozen;
Rabbit Skins, do., 6d. to 12d. per dozen.
Leather.? We have no change to report, and
can obtain the following quotations for all offering,
viz.;? Crop, 9d. to lid. per lb,; Kip, Is. to Is. 6d.
per lb.; Calf, 2s. to 2s. 9d. per lb.; Wallaby, 2s. to

per lb.; Brown Kangaroo, Is. lOd. to 2s. 2d. per
lb,; Harness, lid. to 13d. per lb.; Basils, 10s. to
20s. per dozen.
Tallow. ?The tone of the market continues
firm, and we have sold a large supply, both by
auction and private contract, at quotations.
Freights continue high and scarce, so that opera-
tions are somewhat restricted for shipment. The
local trade are operating with more vigour, and a
healthy inquiry exists. We quote;?-Average
Mutton, from �25 10s. to �27 15s. per ton; do.

GOLDSBROUGH?S WOOL WAREHOUSES,
Melbourne, 20 th April, 1881.
WOOL. ?We have no transactions to report in
this market owing to the Easter holidays, but we
intend holding a small sale next week, when we
expect that late rates will be maintained, as there
is a good demand for all descriptions.
Sheepskins.?Full catalogues, consisting chiefly
of Green Skins, have been submitted to public
competition, and have been readily cleared out,
notwithstanding the interruptions of the holidays.
We report a firm tone at late rates, and find no
difficulty in realising all offering. Ruling quota-
tions are�utchers? Green Skins (good to
superior), 2s. lOd. to Bs. lid. each ; do. do. (aver-
age to good), Is, 9d. to 3s. each ; do. Dry do.

Skins, at per lb., 3d. to 6Jd.
Hides. ?Late rates are current, and a good
demand exists for all classes of Hides, and a large
number of Green Hides have been passed under
the hammer. Salted heavy weights, in good sale-
able condition? i.e., free from offal, clean, and
well-salted?are in special favour, and command
ready sale. A firm tone prevails, and we find a

garoo, 2s, to 2s. fid, per lb.; Harness, lid, to
13id. per lb.; Basils, 10s. to 20s, per dozen.
Tallow. ?In consequence of the holidays no
auction sale has been held, but we report a
moderate inquiry for lots in shipping order at late
rates. Freights continue high and scarce, hence
operations are necessarily limited, but good brands
have maintained their value. The local manu-
facturers haveoperated to a limited extent, and lots
not in shipping order have been taken by them
at low rates. Particular attention should be given
by vendors to coopering at present, as the local
market is somewhat overstocked, hence low prices
are ruling. We quote -.?Average Mutton, �25 to
�27 per ton ; do. Beef, �24 to �25 10s. do,; Mixed,
�2l to �25 do.; inferior, �l7 to �2l do. Shipping

Wheat.?ln consequence of the Easter holidays
we have postponed our sale until Wednesday next,
the 27th inst., when we will submit a large cata-
logue. There are still some large shipping orders
unsupplied, and this, together with the limited
stock held by our local millers, will no doubt
cause higher rates to rule. We quote '.?Prime
Seed Wheat, 4s. 9d. to ss. fid.; prime Shipping,
4s. fid.; prime Milling, 4s. 5d,; medium to good,
4s. Id. to 4s. 4d.; and inferior to medium, 3s. 4d.
to 4s. per bushel.
Flour. ?We quote good country brands at �9
7s. fid., and town-milled �9 15s. sterling per ton.
Oats.? This market is extremely firm, all
coming forward finding ready purchasers at
advanced rates. We quote :?Prime Seed, 3s. fid.
to 45.; prime Milling, 3s. 4d.; prime Feed, 2s. lid.;
medium to good, 2s. 7d, to 2s. 10d.; and inferior
to medium, 2s, 3d. to 2s. fid. per bushel.
Barley.?The demand for all classes of Barley
is limited, and we have no improvement to
report. Inquiry exists only for superior Malting
parcels, which appear to be scarce, and off
samples are difficult to quit. We quote: ?
Prime Seed, ss. to 65.; prime Malting, 3s. 3d.;

GOLDSBROUGH?S WOOL WAREHOUSES,
Melbourne, 27th April, 1881.
WOOL.?We resumed our auction sales to-day,
and sold 334 bales at about similar rates to those
lately ruling. The catalogue consisted principally
of town and country scoured and balances of clips
delayed in transit, in ordinary to ayerage con-
dition, There was keen competition for the dif-
ferent lots submitted, the local manufacturers
and scourers being the principal purchasers.
Greasy realised from 6|d. to 9Jd. per lb.; Scoured,
in ordinary condition, up to 14|d. per lb.
Sheepskins.?Our regular sales have passed off
satisfactorily, and late rates were steadily main-
tained. We passed through a heavy supply of
Green Skins, the value of which is advancing in
proportion to the growth of wool. Both Merinos
and crossbreds find equal favour at present, and
we note a firm tone. Current quotations are :
Butchers? Green Skins (superior), 3s. to 4s. 2d.
each; do. do. (average), 2s. to 3s. each ; do.
Dry do. (average and superior), Is. 6d, to 3s. 3d.
each ; Dry Skins, at per lb., 3d. to 6|d.
Hides.?We have cleared out a large number
of Green Hides, and secured late rates for all
disposed of. Competition has not been so brisk,
and values for average salted have ruled lower-;
prime lots, however, have met with fair inquiry,
and have maintained late rates. Shipments from
other colonies, if large, clean, well-salted, and in
good condition, command full prices. We
quote Green Ox, from 18s. to 275. 6d. each ; do.
Cow, from 14s. 6d. to 18s. 3d. each ; Victorian
salted (superior), 4d. to 4Jd. per lb.; average, 3Jd.
to 4d. per lb.; inferior, 2�d. to 3Jd. per lb.;

Kangaroo Skins, &o.?Superior qualities are
in good demand, and a better feeling exists. We
find no difficulty at present in finding purchasers
for Skins of superior quality at quotations. Wee-
vils, however, being prevalent at this season of the
year, cause buyers to operate with caution, as most
Skins now coming forward are more or less
damaged. Current quotations are ;?Kangaroo

Tallow. ?We report a good inquiry for lots
suitable �or export. Rates of freight continue
high, but freight has been offering more freely,
and shippers have operated to a larger extent.
The local market continues overstocked with lots
of inferior quality, unsuitable for shipment, which
can only be placed at very low prices ; lots well-
coopered find a better market for shipment, hence
vendors should pay particular attention to cooper-
ing. - There is a good demand generally, and late
rates are current, viz.Ave'rage Mutton, �25 to
�27 per ton; dot Beef, �24 to �25 10s. do.; Mixed,
