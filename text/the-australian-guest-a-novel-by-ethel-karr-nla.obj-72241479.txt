THE AUSTRALIAN GUEST
CHAPTER I.
JANE BERTRAM?S STORY.
It was two years after father?s death, and I had
just begun to give over thinking it was his step
I heard, as Ralph came home from the fields of
an evening, when Kitty came to live with us.
George, my younger brother, who had gone out
to Australia when only nineteen, had died a
matter of six years ago, leaving enough money
for his wife and child to live on without burden-
ing any one. We had none of us been sorry
that his wife should continue to live over there,
for we had never seen her, and maybe we were
best apart. However, poor thing, she only lived
to see Kitty eight years old, and her money all
spent. We never came exactly to the rights
of it, but her relations seem to have been a


careless, extravagant lot, and she but a feckless
sort of body.
About six months after we had heard of the
mother?s death, came a letter to say that Kitty
had been sent home to England, as they could not
afford to keep her out there any longer. There
was no help for it, as the child had already been
sent off; but I shall never forget poor mother?s face,
when I told her the news.
? My dear Jane, she will bring half-a-dozen aunts
and cousins with her, and what shall we do ??
? Why, send them back again,? I replied sharply.
Ralph took the news quietly enough.
? I don?t suppose one child will make much differ-
ence in our expenses ; and, besides, we are better off
now than we were a year back.?
? Yes, and very likely we are to keep so, if we
have to keep finding clothes and food for new
relations. I daresay we shall have a cousin or two
over next year.?
Ralph went out laughing and saying,?
? Well I hope it will be a male specimen next
time. I could make some use of him; we want
a cow-boy.?
? Ralph always takes things so easily,? said mother
in a vexed tone; ?just like his poor father.?
? Well, mother, you and I worry enough for the


whole family, and I don?t know after all that we
get on much better for it. The child must come,
?O
and we must make the best of it. If she is at
all like her father, we shall be very fond of her;
and if she isn?t, why?we must be very fond
-of her all the same.?
In spite of these sensible remarks, it was with
mo very light heart that I watched Ralph drive
off to the station, a mile distant, to fetch home
our Niece. How strange it sounded! We had
written to a friend in London to receive her
there for a day or two, and put her safely in
the train for Cragford, our home, and for the
future her?s.
I stood at the little white gate looking after
O
Ralph and the gig, as they lessened to view down
the hot, dusty road, smiling, despite myself, at
his last words as he drove off
? Don?t be surprised to see me return with
a cousin or two hanging on to the back of the
gig-?
As I turned and walked slowly up the little
straight path, with its yew hedge on either side,
I looked at the comfortable white house, with
the Virginia creeper and white roses climbing
over it, its pretty porch and the orchard at the
side, and I thought to myself,?


? Well, a child must be hard to please who
does not find a happy home here.?
Thinking thus o� my own and Ralph?s merry
childhood, ?our romps in the hay-fields, our tree-
climbing in the orchard, and general fun and
O 7 o
frolics all the year round, ?my heart warmed to
my youthful niece in a way it had not hitherto
done.
Ah ! dear old home ! What would I not give
to find mvself once more in the orchard gather-
�/ o
ing up the stray apples, half hidden by the long-
grass ; the wind blowing my hair about so, that
mother would come out calling, ? Jane, Jane, why
will you go out without putting your hat on i
you look like a wild girl out of the woods.?
* O
It was tea-time before we heard the quick short
trot of old Maggie?s feet, and I put my head in
at the parlour door to say to mother, ? Here they
are ! ? adding encouragingly,?
? Now, don?t worry if she does look a little
rough, we shall soon?? I broke off.
Phoebe who had run to the side-door for a
came in with the startling announcement, ?
O 7
?Oh 1 Miss Jane, there?s a young lady and a
little girl in the gig.?
o o o
I felt my heart give one great jump, and then
I said gently enough,?


? Nonsense, Phoebe 1 You must have made a
mistake.?
Mother ran to the window quicker than I
had ever thought she could run, and cried
out, ?
?Oh! Jane, Jane! I told you so, it is one of
those dreadful Australian cousins. Oh, the bold-
faced thing, to come here without telling us a
word about it.?
I went to the front door and down the path.
A little dark-haired girl came running along,
5 o o 7
clutched me round in a violent embrace, with an
?Oh, Aunt Jane, I?m so glad to see you!? and
then rushed on to where poor mother stood on
the steps. I had hardly a thought to bestow on
my enthusiastic niece, for my whole attention was
fixed on ? the young lady ? who was being so
politely helped down from the gig by Ralph.
I stood quite silent at the gate till she was
down, and then Ralph turned to me with a queer
expression of mingled amusement and apprehen-
sion as he said, ?
? This young lady, Jane, is a cousin of our niece
Kitty.?
? And so a sort of relation, am I not ? ? and
before I knew where I was, I received an affec-
tionate embrace. I drew myself away as soon


as possible, and, looking from one to theootherr r
I said, ?
? But I don?t understand.?
Ralph, shifting himself uneasily from one foot
to the other, took it into his head to explain ~
which I had meant her to do.
? Why, you see, Jane, Kitty?s aunt didn?t like
to send her all the way from Australia by herself,
and so this young lady, Miss Bolder�, her daughter,,
was kind enough to come with Kitty and bring
her on here.?
I don?t think I ever was, or ever have been, so-
angry with anyone as I was at that moment with
Ralph. Instead of helping me out with some
decently civil speech, such as, ? I am sure we
are very pleased to see you, but it is quite im-
possible that we can find room for you to sleep
here. If you will stay to tea, we shall be very
glad,??he left me to do it all, and walked oft' to
the stables without another word.
Miss Bolder� marched up the path looking-
about her.
?So this is the place poor Uncle George was
always talking about; I believe he thought there
was no spot in the world like it. It has quite
a homelike look to me after hearing so much
about it.?


I was still silent as I walked behind her, feeling
that mother (as mistress) was the most proper
person to deal with this young lady, and gave her a
proper setting down. Still I longed to give her a
bit of my own mind all the while. Mother was
standing on the steps with Kitty?s face between her
two hands and the tears running down her cheeks.
? Oh, Jane 1 Jane ! George?s self is looking out at
me through this child?s eyes.?
Sure enough, as I looked at the child, those
lifteen lon� years seemed to roll away, and we
were all standing at the front door to say good-
bye to George, and I heard his voice once more
choked with sobs, ? Mother! mother! I?ll come
back sometime. I wish I wasn?t going now, but
I?ll come back and settle down in the old place,,
please God.? It had not pleased God; but oh,
George, you looked back at us through your
child?s eyes that day, and we answered that look,
and took her to our hearts and loved her from
that hour.
If it had not been for Miss Boldero, I should
have broken down too, but I could not cry before
her.
? Mother,? I said at last, ? this is Miss Boldero, a
cousin of Kitty?s. We must try and find room for
her here for the night.?


? Surely,? said my mother, her tears still falling,
? anyone who has been good to my George?s child
v o o
is very welcome.?
This would never do. I saw mother was quite
unnerved and unlike herself, so I said briskly,?
? Well, we had better come in now and have tea,
and let Kitty see the inside of her new home.?
I conducted Miss Bolder� up into Kitty?s bed-
room, which she would have to share with her, and
rushed into my own for a few minutes? thought.
That the girl must stay the night was unavoidable,
but I was determined that she should stay no
longer. I felt quite sure that mother would agree
with me when her first emotion at the sight of
Kitty had subsided; and, of course, Ealph would
see it in the same light. As it was to be only
for one night, I must make the best of it and
put up with the girl. I went downstairs and
found Kitty on the sofa by the side of mother,
Miss Bolder� discoursing on George, and mother
and Ralph listening with all their ears. I began
to think Miss Bolder� a more artful girl than I
had ever imagined, for this was just the way to
get round mother. Tea created a diversion, but
did not stop Miss Boldero?s tongue. She began
telling us about life in Australia, mixed up with
all sorts of ridiculous stories; I don?t believe one-


half of them were true, but she said they were,
and called on Kitty to support her. Kitty, poor
child, not knowing any better, looked upon her
cousin as a miracle of wit and cleverness, and
favoured us with several anecdotes of ? Cousin
Lottie?s ? exploits, which ought to have made
that young lady blush, to my thinking, but of
which she seemed to be rather proud.
She kept Ralph and mother in fits of laughter
with her absurd tales, and though it was no more
than one might have expected from him, I must
say I was surprised at mother?s being so foolish.
Even she had enough of it at last, when, in re-
sponse to Kitty?s earnest ? Oh, Lottie, do show
them how old Billy dances the double shuffle,?
Miss Boldero proceeded to give us a specimen of
rheumatic old Billy?s performance, Ralph roaring
with laughter the while.
? I don?t think its quite pretty, my dear, for a
young girl to mimic men,? she said; ? and I would
rather Kitty did not learn such things.?
Miss Boldero was not at all offended.
? Oh, all right, but Kitty?s got no turn that way,
though she?s sharp enough in other things.?
? And a good thing too,? I said shortly.
At nine o?clock our visitor took it into her head
that she was tired (which was no wonder, seeing


how her tongue had been going), and went off with
Kitty to bed. They had no sooner gone than Ralph
said hastily,?
? Well, I?ll be off to smoke a pipe in the garden
before turning in.?
? Perhaps, before you go, you will tell us what
Miss Boldero?s plans are, and where she is going
to-morrow ? She has not told mother or me any-
thing.?
? Bless me! how on earth should I know ? I
suppose she?s got friends somewhere. I never
asked her.?
? Because, you know, if she thinks she is going
to stop here, we must let her know at once that
we can?t and won?t have her.?
Ralph muttered something about ? inhospitality,?
and ? a few days.?
? She is a horrid girl, I can see,? I wentoorn r
warming to the subject, ? and will do Kitty no
good. As for having her staying here when she?s
no sort of proper relation of ours at all, why, it?s
ridiculous.?
? You?re a charitable sort of person, I must say,?
replied Ralph. ? I don?t see any harm in her, ex-
cept fun. And a wonderfully plucky girl she is
too. Why, she told me she used to help her father
break in his horses sometimes.?


? Anri more shame to her father for letting her
do it,? broke in mother. ? I quite agree with Jane
that she is not the sort of girl to do Kitty any
good, though I don?t quite agree with her in think-
ing her a horrid girl, for she has been very kind to
Kitty, or the child wouldn?t be so fond of her. But
kindness is one thing and breaking in horses an-
other, and?and ?Ralph, you?re the master of the
house; you must tell her to-morrow that we have
been very pleased to see her, and that we are very
grateful to her for her kindness in bringing Kitty
over, and that she really must go.?
? I?ll be hanged if Ido anything of the sort. If
you want to insult the girl, get Jane to do it for
you ; she?s all ready and willing.?
This was just like a man. They?ll always give
you an unpleasant thing to do, and then make
out you like doing it. I told Ralph so, upon
which he growled out that he only wanted us
to do our own dirty work ourselves and not put
it on his shoulders.
I never pay any attention to Ralph when he is
in one of his unreasonable humours, so I only re-
plied, ? That as of course his shoulders, being a man,
were much weaker than mine, being a woman, I
would take this unpleasant duty upon them, as I
had often taken others before.?


After this I had the satisfaction of seeing Ralph
Ring his pipe under the grate and march off to bed.
Then ha vino; mother all to mvself, we soon settled
O ?/
matters comfortably. I undertook to tell Miss
Boldero that we could not accommodate her any
longer, and mother promised to back me up with
her authority.
The next morning; I was down at my usual hour,
O �?'
half-past five, when, who should I meet but Miss
Boldero in a clean print dress, out in the yard,
feeding the fowls, with Kitty perched on the farm-
gate watching her.
Bv-the-bve, I don?t think I have described Miss
%} '
Boldero?s person yet. She was what some people
would call pretty; I never thought her so myself.
Rather tall, very slim, with dark brown hair, not
kept nice and smooth as I like to see it, but
tumbling about all over head, and looking this
morning in the wind like a mop. She was very
pale, not an atom of colour in her cheeks, except
when she got excited (which seemed pretty often),
and had large grey eyes. That?s all, I think,
except that she had what I thought a very silly
way of opening her eyes whenever anyone said
anything that surprised her. However, someone
told me afterwards, that the way Miss Boldero
had of opening those lovely eyes of hers was one


of her greatest attractions! So you see tastes,
differ.
I felt to dislike her still more this morning,
because she had been the cause of a quarrel
between Ralph and I, who always got on so well
together. I said, Good morning,? in my coldest-
manner, despite the affectionate kiss I received.
?You see, Miss Jane, Kitty and I are always up
at four of a morning, so I thought we might as
well be useful and do some of your work. We?ve
been everywhere this morning, haven?t we Kitty ?
up into the loft, round the orchard, and then Mi"
Ralph came and took us all across the fields to a
pond, where we got such lovely water-lilies.?
?Yes, and Uncle Ralph gave me a ride on one
of the cow?s backs,? added Kitty.
? Little girls in England never ride on the backs
of cows,? I said severely, for these proceedings were
not at all to my liking.
? Oh, dear ! ? said Kitty, springing off the gate;
? then I?m sure they want little girls to come over
from Australia to teach them.?
?Not sharing this opinion, I marched the young
lady indoors.
Breakfast that morning was a very silent meal.
Ralph was moody and out of temper; Miss Boldero
was not so talkative as she had been last night; while


mother and I were neither of us at all coniforahle
in our minds. Ralph soon shoved down his food
and marched off; Kitty ran after him to ask for
another ride, and I was left with a clear field
before me.
?Well, Miss Boldero,? I began, ?we should be
glad to hear something about your plans for the
day, so that we can arrange accordingly. By what
train do you wish to leave here ? We should be
pleased if you can stay till the afternoon.'?
Miss Boldero?s eyes grew so ridiculously large
that ?though in no merry mood?l felt an hysteri-
cal inclination to laugh.
? But,? she said, looking from mother to me, ? I
don?t understand. I am not going anywhere that
I know of.?
? Oh, indeed ! ? and I felt all my courage come back
at the bold-facedness of the girl; ?so you thought
perhaps to establish yourself here altogether. But
it is better to speak plainly at once, Miss Boldero,
and so I must tell you that your stopping here
is out of the question; we never asked you to
come, and??
She sprang up from the table, her colour rising
till her pale cheeks were scarlet.
?Don?t trouble yourself to say another word.
I did not know ?I had no idea ?I was not wel-


come; as welcome as you would have been if you
had come at any time to us at home. There we
don?t stop to think about asking?we should laugh
at the idea of such a thing; if one comes we are
glad, if two come we are still more pleased, if
five or six come we only say, ?the more the
merrier,? and Tom sleeps in the wood-shed, and
Jack on the kitchen-floor, and we give them what
we have, and should be ashamed, yes, ashamed, to
?even think it a trouble.?
We were so taken aback, both mother and I,
at this view of the matter, that I could think
of nothing to say, and mother sat looking quite
guilty.
?And I did not know that people in England were
different. How should I ? When Uncle Georsre
was always saying how every one was made wel-
eome at the old farm at home, and how glad his
people would be to see any of us at any time.?
This settled mother completely.
? Jane, it was all your fault. I never should
have thought of sending anyone away who knew
George if it hadn?t been for you.?
This was utterly untrue, of course, and I was
so angry with mother for turning round like this,
that I made up my mind to have nothing more to
do with the business. When mother went up to


Miss Boldero, and laying her hand on her shoulder,
told her she should be very welcome i� she would
stay ; I never said a word, good or bad. We both
expected her to jump at it, but instead she flung-
awav from mother s hand, and out of the loom,
�/
only stopping at the door to say defiantly,
? I have only got ten shillings in the world, but
I shall beg my way back to Australia somehow,
sooner than stay another night in your house :
Then she rushed upstairs, and we heard her bed-
room door slam to.
Mother and I were left looking at each other.
? Oh, Jane, how could you be so obstinate;
Whatever shall we do? Mhatever will Ralph
say?
? She?ll soon change her mind,? I said scornfully ;
? s he?s not a baby, and knows when she?s well off.
She is only trying to frighten us into persuading-
her more to stay.?
Great thumpings overhead, Miss Boldero evi
dently cording her great box.
?You had better go up mother and ask her
to stop. Its absurd for her to go on like this ;
of course she can?t go if she hasn?t got any money.?
Mother went up but soon came down again.
�Ifs not a bit of use. She?s packing her box
and crying, but she won t stop for anj one.


Now, here was I actually obliged to go up and
humbly beg Miss Bolder� to stay. ? The little goose,
why couldn?t she stop quietly without all this fuss ! ?
I marched straight into the room. Miss Boldero
was tying on her hat, her eyes were red, and her
hands shook as she fastened the ribbon.
? Now you know this is perfectly ridiculous,?
I began; ? you can?t go back to Australia if you
haven?t got the money for your passage; and even
if you had, you couldn?t go back by yourself; so
you must be content to wait here till you can hear
from your father, and??
?It is not the least use you?re talking,? she
answered without ever turning round. ? I shall go.
o o
I shall leave my box here till I can send for it,
and?? taking out a very shabby little purse?
?there?s five shillings for my board and lodgings
since I came.?
As I of course refused to take the money, she
laid it down on the dressing-table and walked
downstairs. I followed her, feeling really alarmed.
To let a girl like that go off, no one knew where,
by herself, was impossible; but how to stop
her!
Suddenly in walked Ralph. He was immedi-
ately assailed by mother and I with a confused
account of what mother called ?the little mis-


understanding,? Miss Bolder� standing by scorn-
ful and defiant. I should like to have given her
a good shaking; standing there glowering at us
with those great eyes of hers, when we were
doing everything we could to be kind to her.
Of course I can make allowances for Kalph,
through his not getting a perfectly clear idea of
the matter under these circumstances, and also
on account of his naturally stupid way of rush-
ing to a conclusion, hut even then I do think
he behaved very badly.
? Mother, I think you and Jane must both
have gone mad together. Turn a girl out of the
house and tell her to go back to Australia, when
she has come all this way to bring George?s
child over here safely ! ?
? But, my dear Ralph,? interrupted mother, half
crvinsr ? I didn?t mean to be unkind, indeed I
didn?t, and I?ve begged and begged Miss Boldero
to stop.?
? Well, mother, you have between you managed
to behave abominably. No doubt you did it all
in kindness, but Jane ought to be ashamed of
herself. And now, Miss Boldero, can you for-
give us and make us all happy by staying
amongst us ? ?
? Make us happy indeed ! ? I was so angry


that I walked out of the room, and left them to
settle it amongst themselves. Straight down
the little garden path (the back garden path I
mean) I went, till I reached my bee-hives stand-
ing all in a yellow row in the sunshine. I had
got into a queer habit of always going to this
spot when anything had happened to vex or
worry me. Somehow the humming of the bees,
with the stillness all round, and the scent of
the thyme and sweet herbs growing near, al-
ways seemed to quiet me. It seemed such a
?cheerful, busy sort of little world, with every-
thing going on just the same, day after day,
whether we who looked on were feeling glad
or sorry. It took me out of myself and my
worries, and did for me what I have heard
people say a story book does for them.
I stood watching the bees for some time, and
then, smiling at myself for being so silly, I
said, half-aloud, ?
? I wonder what you would do if you had
a strange bee come among you suddenly ? ?
A voice at my elbow, which made me start
said very softly,?
? Sting it to death, my dear young lady, sting
it to death.?


CHAPTER 11.
JANE BERTRAM?S STORY.
I HATE to be thought nervous, because whatever
O *
faults I may have nervousness is not one of them r
and so I felt very angry with myself for the
slight start I had given, and still more angry
with Mr Basset who had occasioned it. I never
did like ? old Basset,? as he was generally
very much. Respect to ones elders is a great
thing no doubt, and I always impress it very
strongly on Kitty, hut as for feeling much respect
for Mr Basset, dear me, I don?t think I could if
I tried ever so. Just now I should have liked
to have boxed his ears as he stood gently swaving
o %/ ?/ o
himself backwards and forwards on his stick.
? Anybody dead ? ? he said, after a quiet chuckle
at my start. Stupid old man 1 he was always
saying odd things like this to make one ask
him what he meant. I always made a point
of disappointing him if I could, and being used
to his ways could often manage to guess what
J O o
he was driving at. But now, after hastily looking


up at the windows to see if the blinds were down
.and finding them all up, I was quite at a loss.
He waved his stick towards the hives. I stared
.at him, and then at the hives, without feeling any
the wiser.
? Never heard of telling the bees ? ? he said
at last, looking at me with his head on one side.
Of course I knew then that he was referring: to
the old country superstition about telling the
bees when anyone in the house dies; and not
aeeing anything very clever in the remark, as
he seemed to do, I asked him to come indoors and
see mother. Mother thought him a very clever
and amusing old gentleman, and he liked talking
to mother, because she always laughed at his
jokes, and let him work up to them in his own
slow fashion. Ralph, I am sorry to say, gener-
ally spoke of him as ? that old fool.?
He was a short, fat little man, and took a
long time waddling down to the house. As we
went along I told him we had a young lady
visitor staying with us. He took this piece of
news so quietly, and asked so few questions, that
I was quite surprised, for he was a very inquisitive
old gentleman, and generally wanted to know
-everything about everyone.
I had intended slipping him into the drawing-


room, as I was not anxious for him to make Miss
Boldero?s acquaintance, and find out that she was
a connection of ours. However, no sooner did he
hear voices in the parlour, than he turned down
the passage and went at such a pace that there
was no stopping him, straight in amongst the
whole party. Of course it was very awkward,
There was mother looking tearful and unhappy,.
Ralph flushed and eager, Miss Boldero herself
flushed and eager and unhappy and tearful all
together. Into the middle of all this marched Mr
Basset quite unconcerned and comfortable.
? How d?ye do, ma?am ? how d?ye do Mr Ralph ?
How d?ye do, young lady ? Don?t know your name
more?s the pity.?
?This is Miss Boldero,? I said, coming forward,
? she is staying with us for a little while.?
Mr Basset, who had seated himself on the sofa
with his hands folded on the top of his stick,
nodded his head thoughtfully at Miss Boldero
several times, then turning to mother?
? Pleased ? ? he said questioningly.
? Oh, yes, of course I am very pleased to have
her,? said mother quite glad to have such a
question to answer.
? Soon ? ? asked Mr Basset.
Mother looked bewildered?but supposing the


question to refer to the departure of Miss Boldero,
said, ?
? Oh, no, not just yet, I hope.?
?Ah!? said Mr Basset, wagging his head slowly to
and fro, ? quite right, quite right. Plenty of time,
plenty of time.? Then suddenly, ? But we can?t
make the young people think so, can we, Mr
Ralph ? ?
Ralph, not seeing much sense in this remark, I
suppose, got rather red, and said nothing. I be-
gan to feel uncomfortable. Mother was so used
to being bewildered by Mr Basset?s remarks that
she was not much disturbed. There was a dead
silence, while I racked my brains for something
to say.
? Well, well,? said Mr Basset at last, to mother
? you?ll still have Miss Jane left, you know. She
won?t have anything to say to any of the young
men; sends ?em all oft? with broken hearts, she
does. Ah! she?s a cruel girl, a cruel girl.?
I hate to be made a fool of, and nothing ever
made me so angry with Mr Basset as when he
began to talk in this way. I suppose he thought
it pleased me to be joked with on my imaginary
conquests, whereas, knowing myself to be plain
and unattractive, it made me furious. In my
annoyance at the last part of his speech, I for-


got to notice the oddness of the first, but mother
opened her eyes in mild surprise.
? I don?t know what you mean, Mr Basset.
Ralph is not thinking of leaving me.?
? Ah, going to live all together still, are you ?
Well, you know best of course, and I daresay
the young lady don?t know much about the duties
of a farmer?s wife.?
?I think there must be some mistake, Mr Basset,?
said mother, fully roused at last; ?my son is not
thinking of such a thing as being married, if that
is y?hat you mean.?
? Bless my soul! ? exclaimed Mr Basset; ? why,
I?m sure Miss Jane told me he was going to be
o o
married to this young lady here.?
No one can even imagine the state of confusion
into which this statement threw the whole party.
I felt sure all the time that it was not a genuine
mistake on the horrid old man?s part, and yet what
mischief it might do; what foolish hopes it might
put into Miss Boldero?s mind, which, of course, could
never be realised; she might even think that I had
hinted at the mad idea, not knowing Mr Basset as
well as I did. Ralph looked furious, as well he
might. Miss Boldero, indeed ! I didn?t wonder at
his being angry, or at the ? meddling old fool ? mut-
tered under his breath. A slight rustle and the


click of the parlour door were all I heard or saw of
Miss Bolder�.
?She don?t seem to like the idea,? said Mr Basset,
looking blandly round him. ? S?pose she thinks
Mr Ralph ain?t good enough for her. Young gals
always expect too much. She?ll learn better by-
and-bye.?
?Not good enough, indeed!? cried mother, with
O O'
hot cheeks. ? I don?t know what you are thinking
of, Mr Basset. My Ralph doesn?t need to look far
for a wife, I can tell you, with good looks and a
nice bit of money in the bargain?? +
? For Heaven?s sake, hold your tongue, mother ! ?
said Ralph, putting his hand heavily on her shoulder,
as if to keep back the words by main force ; ? you
are making me look like a perfect fool. Jane, don?t
stand staring there, but go, for goodness? sake, and
explain things to Miss Boldero. She must think
we have all gone mad together.?
I was sorry for Ralph. Mother certainly had
an aggravating way of thinking that every girl
in the parish (and for several miles out of it) was
more or less in love with him, and of letting other
people see she thought so. Of course, it was very
ridiculous, but still I must say that Ralph some-
times bore it very patiently, and, indeed, hardly
seemed to mind it. However, there was no doubt


about his minding it to-day, and even mother
O '
refrained from holding forth on her favourite
O
subject, and tried instead to make Mr Basset un-
derstand Miss Boldero?s position and connection
with ourselves, I left her explaining, and went
upstairs feeling very strongly what a lot of bother
and worry this girl had brought with her into a
quiet household. Here had I been spending the
best part of my morning over her affairs, instead
of getting on with the day?s work, and a great
deal of gratitude I should get, no doubt.
I didn?t knock at the bedroom door, for I thought
it very likely she wouldn?t let me in if I did, so
I turned the handle sharply and walked in.
I am a very reasonable sort of person; even
people who don?t like me always allow that I
have a great deal of common sense, so I suppose
that when I come across a really silly unreason-
able man or woman, it is a greater trial to me
than it would be to some others I know. At
anyrate, when I saw Miss Boldero lying on the
bed, with her head buried in the pillows, sobbing as
if her heart would break, I felt?well?very much
put out. I was so sick of the whole thing. All
one?s work and regular occupations put on one side
for a girl who had first thrust herself where she
was not wanted, and then when she had got her


way, and was allowed to stay, wouldn?t even be
content and grateful.
? What?s the matter now ? ? I asked, as kindly
as I could bring myself to speak to her.
Miss Bolder� raised her hot cheeks and swollen
eyes (and, goodness me, there was not much beauty
to boast of now I), looking, as she did so, so ex-
tremely out of temper, that I felt quite angry.
?My brother wished me to come and explain
about Mr Basset?s stupid mistake. Of course it
has annoyed him very much, and I daresay you
didn?t altogether like it ? ?
? All! ? said Miss Boldero, burying her head
deeper in the pillows, ? if it could only have been
true! ?
? Good Gracious 1 ? I thought, ? she has fallen head
O O *
over ears in love with him in this little time.
? What shall we do ? ?
? Come, come,? I began, ? don?t be foolish??
there I stopped short, for I was interrupted by a
burst of hysterical laughter.
Then Miss Boldero got up, and pushing back her
hair from her wet face, said, ?
? There, I feel better. There?s nothing like a
good laugh to set me straight, and I didn?t think
I had one left in me till you began to talk. As
for your brother, I?m sure I?m as sorry as any-


one that he should be annoyed by having his
name connected with mine. I feel for him ex-
tremely, and it is to be hoped that very eccentric
old gentleman downstairs won?t spread such a
terrible report. My annoyance was caused, as of
course you guessed, by the utter impossibility of
such a report even proving true.?
The way in which these last words were spoken
made me begin to think that Miss Bolder� was
laughing at me, so I said sharply,?
? I am afraid I didn?t give you credit for so
much common sense.?
??Now I know you didn?t; you see that comes
of judging by appearances. Just to show you
what an amount of common sense I have got in
me, I will tell you what lam going to do. I am
going to try and make the best of a very bad
business, namely, my coming over here at all. It
can?t be helped, so I suppose I must bear it, and
I shall do my best to earn my board and lodging
while lam here. I shouldn?t dare to say that if
I was in Australia; people would be so dreadfully
offended they would never forgive me. But here
things are very different, and you will quite un-
derstand and appreciate my thoughtfulness. Oh,
I shall soon get into all the good old English ways
and customs.?


? Australia, indeed ! Everyone knows that the
English are the most hospitable people in the
world.?
? Oh! ? said Miss Bolder�, opening those idiotic
eyes of hers, ?but you don?t approve of it. You
rise above such a weakness as hospitality. Ah,,
well, we are not all equal to that, unfortunately.
There is Kitty rattling at the door; send her
away, if she sees I have been crying she will never
be quiet till she has found out what is the matter,
and then she might take it into her head that she
was not wanted either.?
? Run away, Kitty,? I called out; ? your cousin
is busy, and doesn?t want you.?
? But I want her ,? shouted Kitty, drumming
away at the door. ? Lottie, come down and look
at all the eggs I?ve found in the hen-house.?
? Not just now, dear,? replied Miss Bolder�,
vigorously splashing her face with cold water.
? Kitty, there?s such a nice old gentleman in the
parlour, won?t you go down and see him ? Miss
Jane will take you if you?re afraid to go alone.?
Of course this was a strong hint for me to go,
and as it was little enough pleasure to stay and
talk to a girl who did not seem to be capable of
seeing anything in a sensible light, I went. As
far as Kitty?s feelings were concerned, my pres-


ence was not at all wanted, for shyness was not
the least in her line. I had hoped to find Mr
Basset gone, hut he was still in the parlour talk-
ing to mother. Ralph, of course, had gone off to
the fields.
Kitty was immediately greeted by Mr Basset
as ? Little 80-peep who had lost her sheep,? I
suppose, because she had come from Australia
and a sheep-farm. While he was talking to her
mother drew me aside.
? Have you made it all right with Miss Boldero,
Jane ? ?
? Oh, yes, of course.?
? Because,? continued mother, ?Mr Basset says
that the Fontaines are coming to call this after-
noon. If they do come, we must have everything
comfortable and straightforward ?and, Jane, I do
hope Miss Boldero won?t go telling them some
of those queer stories of hers, of what they do in
Australia, it would make me feel so uncomfort-
able.?
? I?m sure I can?t answer for what she may do
or say. Whatever possessed the Fontaines to call
to-day of all days in the year ? ?
? Well, after all, they must have met her some-
time or other, as she is not likely to leave yet
awhile.?


I groaned.
? So she agreed to stop after all ? ?
? Well, she couldn?t very well do anything else.
She was dreadfully obstinate at first, and de-
clared nothing should keep her here; but Ralph
can be very masterful when he likes, though he
seems so easy-going. Do you remember about
that gipsy fellow, Jane??
? Yes, yes, mother; I want to know what he
said to Miss Bolder�.?
? Why, he told her that wherever she went, he
would follow and fetch her back again. I don?t
think she believed he meant it at first, but when
she saw he was in earnest, she just gloomed at
him out of those eyes of hers and gave it up.?
? Well, let me go, mother. It?s no use worrying,
here she is, and we can?t help it. I suppose if the
Fontaines are coming, I must make some cakes
for tea.?
? Oh, certainly, and mind you get out all the
best tea things. You see, they?ll never guess that
Mr Basset has been here and told us of their
coming, so they?ll think they?re what we gener-
ally use.?
Mother went off quite comforted by this idea;
and I went into the kitchen to find Phoebe gossip-
ing at the back door with old Jacob the pedlar,


and all the breakfast things lying unwashed on
the table.
?All Miss Boldero?s doing,? I thought to my-
self, as I sent them both oft? in double-quick time.
As for the Fontaines, well, it was a bother their
coming to-day, but still, of course, it was gratifying
to have them drop in in this friendly sort of way,
and it was worth a little trouble. Mr Fontaine
was a cousin of mothers, and when they fiist
came to live at Cragford, as they were in lathei a
different position to ours, we had quite made up our
minds that most likely we should see nothing of
them. But it had turned out differently. Mrs-
Fontaine had two boys about fourteen and sixteen
years old, and they had managed to strike up an
acquaintance with Ralph one day over a grand
ratting expedition. Ralph had allowed them and
their dogs a free run over his barns, with the
assistance of our little terrier, Puss, "who I expect
did most of the business. After this they were
always coming. I suppose a farm is generally a
sort of boy?s paradise; at anyrate, these two
seemed to think it so, and through constantly
hearing our names mentioned, Mrs Fontaine came
at last to fancy that mother must really be the
cousin she had lost sight of for so long. Very
much to our surprise, one afternoon, she and her


daughter called. Of course we were pleased,
mother and I; we should not have thought of
going to see them, but as they chose to claim the
relationship, it made things very pleasant. When
Ralph came home, and we told him the Fontaines
had been, he asked if they gave ? themselves airs ? ?
? Oh, dear no,? said mother eagerly. ? Mrs Fon-
taine seems a very quiet, unassuming sort of person.
Rather meanly dressed?didn?t you think so, Jane?
-but quite the lady.?
? And the girl ? ? asked Ralph.
? Sweetly pretty,? said mother, and then I know
how pleased she must be feeling at Mrs Fontaine?s
visit, for mother hardly ever thought a girl pretty,
or at least hardly ever said she thought so. ? And
such nice manners; made herself quite at home,
as if she had known us all her life. I thought
that little velvet bonnet of hers very pretty, Jane ;
you must try and get one like it.?
? I should look rather different to Miss Fontaine
in it.?
? Well, mother,? said Ralph, ?you seem to have
fallen violently in love with both of them. Then,
as mother was called out of the room, he said,
turning to me, ? The mother isn?t often so quickly
taken with new people; whatever was there about
them to take her fancy so ? ?


? I think it was partly through talking over old
times with Mrs Fontaine; hut I am surprised at
her liking the girl so much. I shouldn?t have
o o
thought she was mother?s style at all.?
? Why not ? ?
? Oh, I don?t know. She struck me as being
rather silly in some ways; still, I liked her very
much on the whole, and she certainly didn?t give
herself airs.?
? Pretty ? ?
? Oh, decidedly; and Ralph,? I called out as he
was going, ? you ought to be very much flattered,
for mother showed her all your photographs since
you were six years old, with a history of each, and
she really seemed interested.?
? Hang it all, Jane, you might have stopped her
from doing that. How fearfully bored the girl
must have been.?
? Not at all,? I said, observing a rather gratified
smile on Ralph?s face, ? she seemed especially
pleased with the one where you are holding your
wooden horse.?
? What! that little brute in petticoats, with the
curl on the top of his head ? You don?t mean to
say mother showed her that ? Why, I thought I
had burnt it up ever so long ago.?
? Oh, no, it was there all right enough, and Miss


Fontaine seemed more amused over that than over
any of them. I saw her mouth twitching as she
handed it to her mother.?
Poor Ralph, he was very much put out, but
really mother did make such an absurd fuss over
him, that unless I had given him a little snub
now and then, he would have been quite spoilt. As
far as that goes, I myself thought him much the
handsomest young man in the parish, but then I
didn?t let him see that I thought so. Now mother
did.
Well, that was how we came to know the Fon-
taines. We had got now to calling each other by
our Christian names, but beyond that, we didn?t
seem to get much further. I suppose it was partly
her being so much younger than me, but certainly
she did sometimes seem very silly. Mother didn?t
think so, but then Mary never talked so freely to
her as she did to me. For instance, mother never
heard how the curate had passed three times up
and down in front of their house, gazing in at the
parlour window, where of course, oddly enough,
Mary happened to be standing each time. It did
occur to me to suggest that, as Mr Weston was on
friendly terms with Mrs Fontaine, and as he was
so anxious to get a glimpse of Mary, he might as
well have walked into the house, instead of up and


down outside it. However, Mary did not seem to
see it in that light at all, and certainly her
numerous lovers did always seem to go to work
in the most roundabout way they could think of.
There was Dr Parkyn?s assistant, who must have
had an easier time of it than young assistants
generally do, seeing that, according to Mary?s
account, he spent most of his days looking over the
surgery blind, in hopes of seeing her walk down
the High Street. This seemed to me, like the-
other, a rather tame way of conducting a court-
ship, but I never was romantic, and, besides, know
little enough of love affairs. The only lover I ever
had was a farmer, much older than myself, who
never even proposed to me at all, but said one day
to mother when they were alone, ?
?Look here, Mrs Bertram, if your Jane 11 have
me, I?m quite agreeable to have your Jane.?
I didn?t have him, and we are very good friends
to this day; but still I was careful to remember,,
when Mary?s stories got rather tiresome and diffi-
cult to believe in, that people of that sort had a
different way of conducting these matters to what
we did, and that, therefore, I was no judge.


CHAPTER 111
? AND LOVERS ARE ROUND HER SIGHING.?
To everyday commonplace people the parlour of
the Fontaines appeared a very ordinary sitting-
room, containing the usual amount of furniture,
?a sideboard, a bookcase, several chairs, and a
round table in the middle; but to one, at least,
?of its daily occupants, it formed the stage, back-
ground, and scenery to a series of the most bril-
liant and wonderful tableaux. It is not every-
one, I say, who can at will sit down and, like
Maud Muller, see?
?Her narrow kitchen walls
Stretch away into stately halls.
The weary wheel to a spinnet turn,
And the tallow candle an astral burn.?
Mary Fontaine was one of that happy number.


There she sits in the arm-chair, her hands lying-
idly on her work, and her eyes fixed vacantly on the
sideboard. She is not even conscious of the existence
of such mundane things as chairs and tables, for
she is standing in a brilliantly-lighted ballroom.
There is music sounding in the air, and floatings
dresses and flashing jewellery all around. But
there is one among the throng more lovely, more
exquisitely attired, more graceful than them all,,
and this is the reigning beauty of the evening,
the Lady Mary Fontaine. Over her bends the
noble form of Sir Guy de Vavasour, whose features
bear a curious resemblance to the curate?s, but
very likely to-morrow they will look like Ralph
Bertram?s, or some one else?s. He is murmuring
words of passionate devotion, to which she lends-
a careless ear.
? Mary, why will you treat me so coldly T
What have I done to make you seem so-
strange ? ?
?Nothing, Sir Guy, nothing; only I have changed
my mind. Ido not love you as I once thought I
did.?
A look of wild agony passes across the hand-
some countenance of Sir Guy, then a glow of fury
kindles in his dark blue eyes as he cries, grasping
her soft white arm,?


? Mary ! Mary ! I?ve got the joiliest little beggar
of a ferret you ever saw in your life. Ralph
Bertram has just given it me ; look at it.?
Mary turns calmly round in her chair. She is
quite accustomed to these sudden changes of scene.
In an instant ballroom, gay dresses, music and Sir
Guy have all vanished, and she is back in her own
sitting-room with her brother Dick in front of her
holding up a small cage, and its long-bodied vixen-
ish-looking inmate for his inspection. Sir Guy de
Vavasour has vanished, but he is only packed
away for a time, to emerge at the most favourable
opportunity, unless, indeed, Mary is tired of him,
which is not improbable, when the curate may
be, perhaps, promoted in his own personality to
Sir Guy?s place, only under new and dramatic
circumstances.
So Mary turned not without interest to the
subject before her. To the ingenious mind even
the gift of a ferret to a younger brother may
prove great things.
? Ralph seems to be very fond of you, Dick,? she
said, after having duly admired the ferret, and even
ventured a finger between the bars to stroke him
when his back was turned. ?He gave you some-
thing only the other day.?
? What do you mean ? ?


? Why, you brought home a little box last week
with something in it you said Ralph had given
you.?
? Oh, yes, that was a lot of gentles for my
fishing.?
? I hope you didn?t tell him I went fishing with
you sometimes ? ?
? Oh, lor? no 1 as if we hadn?t got something
better than you to talk about. Look here, Mary,
I?m going to fix this little chap up somewhere
in my bedroom. You needn?t say anything to
the mater about it, because she didn?t quite like
my keeping all those efts in the bath, and she
would never have known anything about it if
that idiot of a servant girl hadn?t gone and told
her.?
What the eye does not see the heart does not
grieve after. Mrs Fontaine had no idea of the
vast amount of animal life that existed not very
comfortably in Dick?s bedroom, and so long as
things were not brought directly before her notice,
she was content to ignore them. She was a very
easy-going sort of woman, who detested worry or
responsibility in any form. Occasionally she was
seized with a short fit of querelous annoyance
when anything had gone very palpably wrong, and
in the case of the efts Dick had had to pack


? And Lovers are round Her sighing 41
up those interesting reptiles at a moment?s notice,
and convey them back to their native pond. But
in most cases Mrs Fontaine contented herself with
a remonstrance, and then let matters take their
course, with a sigh to the memory of her late
husband, who, if he had lived, ? would have kept
them all in such excellent order.?
On the whole, she was a most affectionate mother,
and a very kind-hearted friend. Her good-natured
amiability of disposition had been evinced by her
taking the trouble to call on her distant relatives
at the farm, whom she might easily have ignored,
but, as she said, ? Mary, my dear, we really
must call. I have always been on such good
terms with all my relations, and I couldn?t bear
to live in the same place with a cousin and not
know her.?
Mary made no objection. She had been agree-
ably impressed at church on Sunday with the tall
handsome young farmer who had brought round
the bag, and bestowed such an earnest prolonged
gaze upon her as she fumbled for the threepenny
piece, which had, after the manner of that modest
little coin, secluded itself in the furthermost recesses
of her glove.
O
As to Jane Bertram, I don?t suppose there was
anyone whose manner of life appeared to Mary


so utterly dull and insipid. If Jane had told her
of the pleasure she found in ordering the ways of
the household, in having everything managed and
done in the best way possible, and in the keeping,
as she would have styled it, ? a tight hand over
everything,? it would have been incomprehensible
to Mary. A life not enlivened by a constant series
of small love affairs, was to her like a stagnant
' O
pool without a breath of air to ruffle its terrible
tranquillity.
Having said so much, I need scarcely add, that
there was nothing at all heroic about Mary. Jane
Bertram, so prosaic and uninteresting in Mary?s
eyes, was capable of rising to heights of self-
sacrifice to which Mary could never hope to attain,
so long as her views of life were bounded in by
so narrow a horizon. Perhaps, beneath the blast
of some fiery trouble, before which all her petty
vanities and frivolities shall shrivel up and dis-
appear, Mary will one day arise, scathed and
stricken, and well-nigh dead, but with a faint
perception of the grand truth, that
?Not enjoyment and not sorrow
Is our destined end or way ;
But to act, that each to-morrow
Find us farther than to-day.?
To return to her now, as Dick, having departed


upstairs, she also departs to the land of waking-
dreams. Once more Sir Guy stands before her,
with flashing eyes and a bitter sneer upon his lips,
when, rat-a-tat-tat, Mrs Fontaine had come home.
Mary rose with a slight sigh, and went to let her
mother in.
?My dear Mary, still indoors ? Why, I thought
you would have gone for a walk. You must have
had a dull time of it all alone so long.?
O
You see Mrs Fontaine was quite unconscious of
the delightful society her daughter had been en-
joying ; it would have been a penalty to her to
spend a morning alone, which shows the great
disadvantage of having no resources in one?s self.
Mary?s mind was certainly to her a kingdom and
a very agreeable and easily-governed kingdom.
? Take my cloak, Mary; I?m sure I wish I had
never put it on, it was so heavy, and I have been
such a long way all round by the Common. I
feel regularly fagged, and we have got to go to
the farm this afternoon. Oh, by-the-bye, I met
that old Mr Basset; what an absurd old creature
he is. He really gave me quite a fright, asked me
if Dick had not got the scarlet fever. It didn?t
strike me at first that of course he meant to refer
to Dick?s going over to the review, and being so
pleased with it.?


? Dick has come in, mamma, so we had better
have lunch.?
? Yes, ring the bell. Dear me, how we seem to
miss Lewis at lunch time ! ?
Mrs Fontaine meant no sarcasm by this speech ;
the luncheon hour was the only hour in the day
upon which you could safely calculate on the
young Fontaines? appearance, consequently it was
the hour when their absence was most remarked.
Geoff, the elder son, was now away, staying for
a week at a friend?s house. His absence was not
the subject of so much regret to his sister as it was
to his mother, for though Dick and Mary got on
excellently together, Geoff and she had an occasional
passage of arms. Dick was unobservant and good-
natured, Geoff was particularly acute and inclined
to be satirical. Now, a satirical brother, especially
when he happens to be younger than yourself,
must always be more or less of a trial.
It was quite four o?clock before Mrs Fontaine
and Mary reached the farm.
? I think we may as well go in by the side-door,
Mary, and save the servant the trouble of coming
to let us in. I am sure there must be a great deal
for a servant to do here, though of course Jane is
a wonderful person, and does an immense amount
herself.?


So Mrs Fontaine, in the innocence of her heart,
walked up the side path to the door which opened
at the side of the house on to a square bricked
space, partly enclosed by white iron railings. It
was here that the chickens came to be fed, and the
dogs, when they got the chance. At the present
moment there was only one in the place, and he
was dancing up and down outside his kennel like
an excited orator, making the yard echo with his
voice. Coming up to the side of the house in this
way, one had a glimpse of the kitchen through
the back-door standing opposite half open, and on
the left was the farm-yard, with its outbuildings
and stacks of hay, the entrance to it being through
a long low white gate.
If Mrs Fontaine had only known the careful
arrangements that had been made for her reception
at the front-door, how the steps, always of a
dazzling whiteness, had received an additional
scouring, and how Phoebe, in her best cap and
apron, was waiting to answer their double-knock,
I am sure she would, even now, have turned and
retraced her steps. But alas! Mrs Fontaine was
so indifferent to the state of her own doorsteps or
housemaid when visitors came, that it would never
have entered her head to think that other people
troubled themselves about such trifles. Therefore,


after giving a gentle knock with her umbrella,
O o O
which met with no response, Mrs Fontaine, fol-
lowed by her daughter, stepped quietly over the
large sandy cat, sunning himself on the doorstep ;
and entered the passage, the parlour door being
partly open, they went in.
Mrs Bertram was in that happy condition invari-
ably produced by her having ?just put up her feet
for a few minutes.? I don?t mean to imply that
she was asleep, because she had a book in front
of her ?on her lap ?and we all know that a person
can?t go to sleep when he or she is reading a book,
?but she was in that pleasing condition only to be
described in the words of the song, as ? betwixt
waking and sleeping.? The truth is, she had
allowed herself to fall into this state, relying
upon the knock at the front door and the sub-
sequent journey down the long passage to rouse
her. If her visitors had only acted in the manner
expected of them, they would have found her ? all
alive,? as she herself would have said, and ready
to receive them. As it was, Mary and her mother
stood in the room for some minutes without Mrs
Bertram?s being aware of their presence. Sud-
denly a door on the opposite side of the passage
opened, and from out of the little back-room ad-
joining the kitchen came a slim, dark girl, who


e\ stghingr 47
iX.?Sh^gazed
?And Lovers are round Hdr'sighing 47
was quite unknown to either of
at the visitors for a moment with an airS^L/niri
feet nonchalance, then putting out her hand, she
said, ?
? I?m Lottie Bolder�. I think you must be Mrs
and Miss Fontaine. Miss Jane told me you were
coming.?
Miss Bolder� would have done herself another
injury, in Jane?s opinion, if this speech had been
overheard by her, for it would have quite destroyed
her pleasure in the festive glitter of the best tea-
things.
The sound of voices roused Mrs Bertram to the
sense of her visitors unexpected appearance. Even
now it did not occur to Mrs Fontaine that there
was anything peculiarly distressing in anyone?s
being caught reposing on the sofa, and Mrs
Beitiam s e\ ident confusion and profuse apologies
only surprised her.
? And Jane?Lottie do you know where Jane is ?
Really, Mrs Fontaine, I am so sorry, but you see
you came in so unexpected??
Miss Jane is fixing up some window-blinds.
111 go and call her,? said the obliging Lottie.
? Oh, no, let me go to her,? said Mary. ? I want
very badly to have a talk with her.?
Mis Bertram remonstrated, but Mary insisting,


was allowed to have her own way, and going up-
stairs found Jane in her own room employed in
the manner mentioned.
? Dear me, Mary, I think you might have waited
till I came down. How long have you been here ?
I never heard you knock.?
? Ho, mamma and I came in at the side-door,
said Mary, seating herself in a comfortable, and
yet at the same time picturesque position on a
low box; ? and, Jane, go on and finish your blind.
I?ve got such a lot to tell you, and its such an
age since we had one of our nice long talks; now
isn?t it ? ?
Mary?s nice long talks were generally very one-
sided affairs; she doing all the talking, and Jane
all the listening.
? Well,? replied the latter, in a resigned tone of
voice, ? what have you got to tell me ? ?
?Oh, all sorts of things. Jane, do you know
who lives in that queer old house down Friar?s
Lane? the house all shut in by trees. It has a
farm belonging to it, I think.?
? Why, young Mr Hilton lives there. Didn?t
you know that before ? ?
?No. You see I have only seen him once or
twice, because he has been abroad. He has come
back now, and I daresay I shall see more of him.?


11 And Lovers are round Her sighing 49
This was said with a little conscious smile, which
invited further inquiry; but Jane, warned by pre-
vious experiences, took no notice and went on
steadily pleating up her muslin blind.
?Do you know, Jane, I had quite an adventure
the other day, but you mustn?t say anything about
it, ?promise me you won?t ? ?
? Oh, yes, I promise.?
the common, when who should I see coming along
but Mr "VS eston, the curate. Well, I didn?t want
to meet him, because he has been getting rather
silly lately, always walking up and down in front
of the house, and all that sort of nonsense; so I
wanted to avoid him.?
? Which wasn?t very easy, I should think, see-
ing its a straight lane with a high hedge on
each side of it.?
?No, you see there was the awkwardness of
it. I didn?t know what to do. I thought, shall
I turn back ? but then I was afraid he would
o\eitake me, and I should have him walking
with me all the way back to the village.?
ell, X have walked with him as far as
that before now, and found him a very amus-
ing companion.?
Ah, yes, but then he wasn?t?


? Wasn?t in love with me, to be sure, that
makes a difference.?
? Well, at last I thought I would give him a
very cold bow, and then perhaps I could pass
him. But would you believe it, the man had
the impudence to stop and shake hands with
me, and ask after mamma?s cold, which of
course was all an excuse. Well, I got rid of
him at last, and the next person I saw was Mr
Blake, Dr Parkyns? assistant, coming galloping
along the common behind me. I had got Dick?s
o o
horrid little dog with me, and the first thing the
O 7 o
little wretch did was to run at the horse?s heels
and bark. Of course the horse reared, and Mr
Blake was nearly thrown off; it was most won-
derful to see how he kept his seat.?
? I hope he kept his temper.?
?Oh dear, yes. He was so nice and kind
about it. He got oft? his horse, and picked up
poor little Frisk: I forgot to tell you, the horse
had kicked the dog, and he was lying in the
road yelping, and asked if he should put it
out of its misery. I was afraid to say yes,
because Dick would have been so angry, so I
said, would he mind carrying Frisk home for
me ? He said nothing would have given him
o o
greater pleasure, but he had a poor old woman


on the other side of the common, who was
waiting for him to come and take her leg oft?;
still, if he could he of any service to me, of
course the old woman could wait a little longfer.
I thought it would be unfeeling to detain him
after hearing that, especially as Mr Blake said
he thought Frisk was more frightened than
hurt. We put him down in the road, poor
little fellow, and Mr Blake giving him a touch
with his riding-whip, Frisk got up and ran
off home without ever stopping. But since then,
Jane, Mr Blake is always meeting me wherever
I go. I really think he must watch the house.?
? Well, Mary, I am afraid you will have to
answer for it if Dr Parkyns gets another assistant.
He can?t get much work out of this one, I should
say.?
?It isn?t my fault. I can?t help it if people will
be so silly.?
? I am very sorry to hear this about Mr Blake,?
added Jane, giving a final touch to her window-
blind, ? because I heard only yesterday that he
was going to be married to one of the Miss Fosters,
and I m sure they wouldn?t like it if they knew he
was going on like this.?
Poor Mary; but it was not the first unpleasant
shock of this kind she had experienced, and the


effect generally soon passed away. The integu-
ment of Mary?s self-esteem was of as tough a
character of the hide as a rhinoceros, and pro-
tected her as effectually from all serious injury.
On this occasion she ventured to cast doubts on
the truth of the report, ? the Miss Fosters were all
so plain.?
? But they?ve got money,? said Jane grimly y
and Mary sighed for the depravity of human
nature.
? Who is that girl downstairs ? ? she asked, after
a long pause.
? Miss Bolder�.?
? Yes, I know that?s her name ; hut who is she ? ? r
? Well, she?s a niece of my brother George?s-
wife. George went to Australia, you know, when
he was about eighteen, and died there some years-
ago. Miss Bolder� brought his little girl over
to us.?
? Is she nice ? ?
? No, not particularly. I don?t suppose she will
be here long. But you must come downstairs now
and have some tea.?
? Does your brother like her ? ? said Mary, as
they went down the narrow steep staircase.
? I?m sure I don?t know,? replied Jane sharply ;
? you had better ask him yourself.?


After this, Mary held her tongue, feeling that
the subject was not an agreeable one. She her-
self sympathised thoroughly with Jane in her
apparent want of liking for the new-comer.
There was certainly something about the appear-
ance of Miss Bolder� which was not nice. Perhaps
if her features had been less regular, or her
complexion less clear, she might have created a
more favourable impression.
At tea Miss Boldero seemed to have quite re-
covered from her troubles, and was in full feather.
It was quite impossible for either Mrs Bertram
or Jane to suppress her, however much they tried,
and really they need not have taken the trouble,
for Mrs Fontaine was charmed.
? Quite the prettiest and most amusing girl I
have met with for a long time,? she said to Mrs
Bertram as she took leave; ? she must keep you
all quite lively. I?m sure I wish Mary had a
little more fun in her, she is so very quiet at
home.?
Very true, Mrs Fontaine, but then you cannot
expect a young lady, who is enjoying the society
and conversation of a Sir Guy, to have much
attention to spare for less gifted mortals. Of
course this favourable remark on Miss Boldero
was not made in her hearing. Jane, Miss Boldero


and Mary were all standing in a group talking
at the gate, while Ralph and his mother were
escorting Mrs Fontaine down the garden
path.
? Yes, she is very amusing sometimes,? replied
Mrs Bertram doubtfully; ? but you must not be-
lieve all she says; she talks very wildly some-
times.?
? Oh, I think she is charming,? repeated Mrs
Fontaine, not paying much attention to this last
remark. ? You must find her a delightful com-
panion, Ralph ? ?
Mrs Fontaine was not blessed with great
powers of discernment, or she might have seen
enough that afternoon to prevent her making
such an observation. She thought Miss Boldero
charming, and she expected everyone else to
think so too. Mrs Bertram spoke quickly.
? Oh, Ralph does not see much of her. He is
out all day.?
? Yes, still there are the evenings.
? Of course, I like her very much,? said Ralph
reddening slightly; ?no one could help liking
her, I should think.?
?Ah!? said Mrs Fontaine, with her low pleas-
ant laugh, ? I daresay Miss Boldero won?t go
back to Australia after all.?


? And Lovers are round Her sighing 55
Could these last indiscreet words have reached
Lottie Boldero?s ears as she stood leaning care-
lessly back against the gate-post. She gave
no sign, but a slight flush rose up in her pale
cheeks, and her clear voice paused for a moment.
Kitty, who was hanging on her arm, said coax-
ingbr >
? Do go on, Lottie.?
? Well, Miss Bolder�, I should think you were
glad to get away from Australia,? said Mary,
?if you had all those horrid things to do there.
But perhaps you like that sort of rough life ?
It seems dreadful to an English girl.?
O O
This was said so spitefully that it was a sar-
casm spoilt. Miss Boldero laughed lightly.
? Oh, yes,? she said. ? I have heard of Eng-
lish girls? lives. They sit at home all day and
do crochet and think of lovers.?
Mrs Bertram was scandalised.
? Lottie, what can you mean ? I?m sure when
I was a girl I never thought of such a thing as
a lover, at least??
? All, Mrs Bertram, you may as well confess
at once,? said Mrs Fontaine, laughing. ? I see
guilt in your face. But, my dear,? turning to
Lottie, ? are all the Australian young ladies so
indifferent to such a subject ? ?


? Well, we think of a great many other things
besides,? she said rather defiantly, as she met
Ralph?s amused gaze fixed upon her.
She was a pretty enough picture to look at
as she stood then, her hair lightly stirred on
her white forehead by the breeze, and her face
all aglow with life and eagerness. A slim deli-
cate-looking girl, but with as much energy and
power in her small frame as would have sup-
plied two or three Marys. It was curious how
in this little scene Mary had fallen, as it were
into the background and been almost unnoticed;
yet she was really in most respects the prettiest
girl of the two. She was what people term ? a
fine girl,? with an almost dazzling pink and
white complexion, and bright chesnut - coloured
hair. It is very absurd, as Mary used often to
say, for people to make such a fuss about ex-
pression, if the features are good and the com-
plexion clear, what more can you want ? And
yet somehow or other expression often carries
the day.
? Well, good-bye,? said Mrs Fontaine. ? It?s a
long time since you last honoured me with a
visit, Jane. Ah, so busy, always the same;
what a useful person you are, and what a use-
less one I am. But you really must make time


to come and see me, and bring Miss Boldero
with you. Good-bye.?
They were off at last, and Ralph stood watch-
ing them down the road in the sweet summer
twilight, saying over and over to himself under
his breath, ? I wonder if she heard?l wonder if
she minded.?


CHAPTER I Y
jane Bertram?s story.
I SUPPOSE some people get accustomed to changes
much sooner than others. Miss Boldero came to
us on a Tuesday, by Saturday night mother
never spoke to her but as ? Lottie,? and it
was ? Lottie ? here and ? Lottie ? there, till any
stranger coming into the house would have
thought the girl was one of the family. And
it wasn?t a bit of use my talking?mother
would listen, and agree, and then go off and
forget all about it. Presently I would hear all
up the stairs?
? Lottie, Lottie, where are you ? I want you
to come and put my knitting straight. It?s all
in a boggle.?
OO
Down would come Miss Boldero, and then, over
?pearl two, and knit three, and slip one,? they
would get quite friendly. It was very trying.


Then Miss Boldero insisted on carrying out her
first intention of doing what she could to earn
her board and lodging. This was all very well
in moderation, but when it came to her want-
ing to take half my work out of my hands, I
didn?t like it at all, and I told her so.?
One morning Ralph came into the larder to
speak to me, with such a serious face that I felt
quite frightened.
? Whatever is the matter, Ralph ? Oh dear! I
hope you haven?t had a quarrel with the hay-
makers, or has the mare fallen lame ? ?
We had got just now a very wild lot of Irishmen
getting in the hay, and Ralph had already come to
words with them several times.
? Oh no ! its nothing much : but Jane, as I came
o ?
through the yard, I saw Miss Boldero in the dairy
scouring out the milk pans. Now you know that
sort of thing is not at all the proper work for her,
and I do wish you would take care and see that
she doesn?t do anything of the kind.?
? Bless me, Ralph,? I said, so surprised, that I
hardly knew what to say, ? why, I?ve done those
milk pans scores of times, and you never minded.?
? I?m sure I never noticed you doing them.?
? No, I daresay not.?
? At any rate, if you choose to do them, that?s


no reason that other people should. And Miss
Boldero is our visitor.?
? A self-invited one, and if she likes to make her-
self useful, I?m sure I shall be the last person to
interfere.?
?Very well then, I shall speak to my mother.?
He was gone, and I stood staring after him, then
I sat suddenly down on an empty beer barrel and
gasped.
It was a very hot morning, and as I sat there,
with the scent of Dutch cheese, suet, and cold
mutton all round me, I felt quite sick and dizzy.
The smell of a Dutch cheese always makes me
think of that morning to this day.
Could it be ? Could Ralph ever be such a fool
as to fall in love with that girl! that girl! I think
I must have been a little off my head for a minute
or two, for I got this question mixed up with
whether I should make a hash of the cold mutton,
or a mince, and I kept going over the two things
in my mind together.
Of course, if Ralph had fallen in love with her,
and if there was too much fat for a hash, why,
there was nothing to prevent his marrying her,
so perhaps I had better cut off as much of the lean
as I could get, and?l woke up with a start, to
think what a fool I was making of myself, and


what nonsense it all was. What could have put
such an idea into my head ? but I w T ould w T atch?
I would notice. Why, I used to think Ralph
rather smitten with Mary Fontaine, and so, per-
haps he was all the time. A very good thing too,
anything better than Miss Boldero. Mary was
rather silly, but she was an English girl, used to
English ways, and no doubt would be sensible
enough if she married Ralph. Mary should come
in to tea next w T eek. I would go and ask her to-
day?l would go and stay the evening, and get
Ralph to fetch me home. Mother could have Miss
Boldero to keep her company while we were gone.
I determined above all things not to give mother
the least hint of my suspicions, which after all were
very likely wide of the mark??most likely/ I
added to myself; for was not Ralph, so slow about
most things, the last person to fall in love in
such a rapid manner. The more I thought about
it, the more absurd the idea became, till I almost
laughed at myself for being so silly; and w~hen
mother came in, fussing about Ralph?s having been
vexed at Miss Boldero?s doing the dairy work, I
was able to answer amiably that for the future
I would keep it in my own hands.
I made my arrangements for my afternoon visit,
and asked Ralph when we were alone if he would


come and fetch me. Having got a ready ? Yes.? I
?was turning away when he added, ?
? I suppose Miss Bolder� goes with you ?
? Oh dear, no ! ? I said, carelessly, ? mother will
he glad to have her to keep her company while we
are away.?
He said nothing, much to my relief, and I started
for my walk in very good spirits. There were
two ways of getting to the Fontaines? house from
the farm. You could go from the front garden into
O O
the lane, and so up the High Street; or you could
take the quieter path across the fields (our own
fields), and enter the Fontaines? back garden
through a little gate. This was the way mother
generally went when she paid a visit. I shouldn?t
have cared myself about having people, even rela-
tions, come in, in that unexpected fashion, through
one?s back premises, but Mi?s Fontaine seemed to
like it. To-day I chose the fields, for it was a hot
sunny afternoon, and the road nearly ankle-deep in
dust. There was a nice breeze blowing, however,
and the long green grass, with a flash of red sorrel
here and there, looked very cool and refreshing.
%j o
In the second field they were making hay, and I
could see Ralph in the distance riding about on the
old mare, looking after the men. They wanted
well looking after, for, as Ralph said, they were


the laziest set of men he had ever had, and the
thirstiest.
But then he generally said that every year, and
so used father before him. Mother and I were
always glad and thankful when hay-making and
harvesting were safely over, for Ralph was young,
and hadn?t the same patience father had, to put
up with the men?s aggravating ways?always trying
to shirk some of the work, and get more than their
fair share of beer and wages. Then being young,
Ralph always thought he was going to be put
upon, and when an older man would have yielded
a point, as I have often seen father do, to keep the
men in a good temper, Ralph stood out for his own
way in everything.
He saw me when I was half-way across the field,
and waved his hand to me, but was too busy to
leave his work. I was going along, after having
O O O ' o
returned the wave of Ralph?s hand, in rather a
brown study, with my eyes fixed on the path,
when, as I got near the stile, some one came vault-
ing over it so suddenly that I was nearly knocked
down.
?Oh ! Miss Bei'tram, a thousand pardons. I hope
I didn?t frighten you much ? Can you tell me where
your brother is ? ?
It was young Mr Hinton, and very hot and ex-


cited he looked. For the matter o� that he never
looked very cool, with his red hair and high com-
plexion ; but to-day he looked more fiery than ever.
He was what would be called, I suppose, a gentle-
man farmer, seeing that he was not dependent on
the farm for his living, though I fancy it was a
more important addition to his income than some
people thought. If this was so, it was a bad look-
out for him, such a boy as he always was in his
ways, and with no more notion of management
than a baby. Ralph was really only four years
older, Mr Hinton being twenty-two ; but you might
have thought there was ten years? difference be-
tween them. Still, he was a nice, pleasant young
man, quite a gentleman, and Ralph liked him very
much. It w-as a good thing he did, seeing that
half the days of the week he had Mr Hinton over
askincf his advice about different farm matters.
o
Since his return from abroad, Mr Hinton had
settled down, determined to make his farm a great
success, and Ralph, laughing at him a good deal,
had gone in for helping him.
Evidently there was something seriously wrong-
this afternoon, and I pointed out Ralph to him
without losing any time. However, he seemed
so glad to have found Ralph, that he leaned back
on the stile, and fanning himself with the huge


flapping hat that he was fond of wearing, began
to talk.
? Miss Bertram, I?m in a regular hole this time.
How on earth does your brother manage to get
on with his men ? ?
? I don?t think he does get on very well with
them. I know he has done nothing but grumble
O O
at them lately.?
? Well, I?m in a regular fix, and I want Bertram
to come and give my fellows a talking to. Can?t
get ?em to do anything; never saw such a set.
And the glass going down every day. I can
tell you I nearly ran a-muck amongst them this
morning. Talk! I?ve talked till I was nearly
black in the face, and I only wonder I didn?t
have a sun-stroke standing in the blazing sun
o o
saying the same thing over and over again.
Should have had if it hadn?t been for this
fellow,? clapping on the large flapping thing he
called a hat.
? What?s the matter with them ? ?
? I?m sure I don?t know. Something about my
having agreed to have a machine in to do some
of the work. Quite positive I never said anything
of the sort; or if I did, as I told ?em, I suppose
I?ve a right to change my mind if I like. They
all laughed then. I never had such a cheeky lot


of fellows before. So there they are humbugging
about the field, doing as good as nothing, and
unless Bertram can do something with them, I
must send off the whole lot, and? M ho?s this
pretty girl coming along the path ? ?
It was Mary Fontaine evidently coming to pay us
a visit at the farm. She certainly did look very
pretty this afternoon as she came forward in the
bright sunshine, her cool lilac print dress showing-
off her dazzling complexion and?l thought of
Ralph, what a handsome couple they would make.
If only Mary would not look as if she thought
every bramble and blade of grass had eyes to
admire her as she passed along, it would have
pleased me better. Of coui?se in this instance
there were Mr Hinton?s eyes, large brown ones,
in the matter, but it would have been just the
same if he had not been there. Mary always
looked self-conscious.
She came up to the stile, and I expected Mr
Hinton to take himself off to Ralph; but no, he
stood glowing, hotter and hotter, under his queer
head covering, and I had to introduce him to Mary
over the stile. An attempt on Mr Hinton?s part
to take off his hat resulted in such a queer failure,
that I laughed outright, and he, being the most
good-natured young fellow in the world, joined


in the laugh. Mary?s whispered ?Jane, how can
you be so rude ? ? only made me laugh the more.
?Never mind, Mr Hinton,? I said, ? it?s a capital
hat for haymaking, see if you can make Ralph get
one. I?m sure he will have a sunstroke some day.
Mary, I was just coming to see your mother, so if
you don?t mind we will walk back together ? ?
v o
After this Mr Hinton had no excuse for stopping
any longer, and so, after helping me over the stile
(for which I was not at all grateful, as I am quite
aware, thanks to Ralph, that I climb a stile like
a father-long-legs), he took his departure, and
Mary walked on. Mary was very silent and very
cross. I could see she felt injured at my having
carried her off so abruptly. She hardly brightened
j. ?/ */ O
when I gaye her my imitation to take tea at
the farm, a thing which generally pleased her
very much.
?/
When we got indoors she seated herself in the
recess of the parlour window, and left her mother
and I to do all the talking. Mrs Fontaine
aggravated me by constantly talking about Lottie
Bolder�, and wanting to know why I had not
brought her with me, till I was quite glad to
see Lewis and Dick come in and get a chano-e in
o o
the conversation ; though, how their mother could
bear to see their dusty boots on her nice carpet


without saying a word, passed my comprehension
altogether.
? How?s Bertram getting on with the hay-
making ? ? was Lewis? hrst remark, in a rather
O 7
patronising tone.
I didn?t like Lewis so well as I did Dick. I used
to think he wanted taking down a peg or two. His
mother thought a great deal too much of his
O O
opinion to be good for him.
? Oh, he?s getting on pretty well,? I said shortly.
? I expect he wants some of Lewis? advice ?
added Dick, with a giggle.
I laughed, and Mrs Fontaine looked vexed,
O 1
Dick went on, ?
? And that idiot of a young Hinton goes
bothering Ralph for advice about his farm, when
he might get much better if he came here to
O O
Lewis.?
? Hold your tongue, Dick,? said Mrs Fontaine;
and, ? Dick, you?re growing that satirical there?ll
be no bearing you,? said Lewis, elevating his dusty
boots on to the couch in a way that gave me a
cold shiver down my back, hot as it was.
?Young Hinton,? began Mrs Fontaine, ?isn?t
O 7 O
that the young man who lives at the gable
%/ O *??'
farm??
?Yes,? broke in Dick; ?sandy fellow, freckled


face, good-natured chap, gave me a young snake
the other day.?
? My dear boy, how everyone seems to know you.?
? Universally beloved and esteemed,? said Lewis
languidly, from the sofa.
? Do you know anything of this Mr Hinton ? ?
udded Mrs Fontaine, turning to me. ?He seems
a pleasant, gentlemanly sort of young fellow. I
met him at Dr Parkyns? house the other evening
and took quite a fancy to him. Has he any
mother or sister living with him ? ?
? Oh, no; he lives quite alone. His father
and mother are both dead, and he hasn?t any
sister. I believe he has a brother somewhere
abroad.?
? What a pity! I should like to have called if
there had been a lady in the house. And so he
manages the farm for himself; he is rather young
for that.?
?He is twenty-two,? I said, ? though he looks
such a boy.?
? I don?t think he looks at all like a boy,? said
Mary suddenly, and then blushed scarlet.
?I didn?t know you knew him, my dear,? said
Mrs Fontaine.
? I know him by sight, and Jane introduced him
to me this afternoon.?


Mary got redder and redder as she spoke. I
was rather surprised, as I had never seen her
blush like that before ; but it was too bad of
Lewis to twist his cushions round, and lie there
gazing at her steadily. Dick, the unobservant,
rattled on, ?
? I wish you would call on him, mother, and
then he migdit ask me over there sometimes.?
O
? My dear boy, you must know that I can?t call
on a gentleman living by himself.?
? Oh, lor?, what a bore ! Jane, do you think
Ralph would like me to come to-morrow after
school and help in the hay-field ? ?
? I daresay he would,? I replied, laughing.
Mary?s colour was very slowly subsiding, and she
got up impatiently and moved her chair so as to get
out of the reach of Lewis? eyes.
The evening passed away, as most of such even-
ings do. I generally get very tired before my
visits from home are over; it seems such dread-
ful waste of time to sit for two or three hours-
doing nothing but talk and laugh. If I could
have had my knitting I should have felt better,
but Mrs Fontaine always said, directly I brought
it out, ?Now, Jane, do be idle for once. You do
quite enough at home, I?m sure. When you come
here you must have a rest; I insist upon it.?


She never seemed to do any needlework herself,
and I often wondered how the boys? clothes ever
got mended, for I?m sure Mary wouldn?t be much
use in that way; in fact her mother told me
once that Mary was very idle, and would sit
with her hands before her doing nothing for an
O o
hour together. As I said at the time, it was
enough to send her into a lunatic asylum. Not
but what no doubt meditation is a very good
thing in its right place. We were always brought
up, since we were quite small, to meditate, but
then we had our regular proper time for it?
Sunday afternoons?and never mixed it up with
week days.
I remember it was old Mr Gregory, our vicar,
O ' '
first put it into mother?s head as a good thing
for young children, and every Sunday afternoon
we used to be called in for our meditation, and
shut up each in their bedroom for an hour. At
first, as Ralph and George shared the same room,
they were shut up together, but they used to
make such a noise, getting up pillow fights and
all sorts of mischief, that they had to be separ-
ated and shut up apart from each other. I re-
member George used to hate his meditation, and
so I think we all did, but no doubt it did us a
great deal of good, and it kept the house quiet


while father and mother had their meditation in
the parlour below. How angry poor mother was
one afternoon, when George got out of his bed-
room window and down by the water-pipe into
the garden, he went and peeped in at the parlour
window, and then came and told us that father
and mother were each of them sound asleep,
the one in the arm-chair and the other on the
sofa. George had a two horn's? meditation next
Sunday.
I am afraid we have rather got out of our
good ways in this respect since we have grown
up. Ralph generally spends his Sunday after-
noons strolling about the farm with his pipe in
his mouth and his dogs at his heels. Sometimes
I go with him, but very often mother says,?
?Jane, we mustn?t forget what good old Mr
Gregory used to tell us about meditation. Xow
sit down and we will both think over the
sermon we heard this morning.?
O
So mother lies down on the sofa with her
hands folded in front of her and her eyes very
wide open. Presently I hear a little sigh and
mother?s eyes droop, then she gives a start and
draws herself together, and I say,?
?Do shut your eyes, mother dear, for a
minute or two; you will be able to meditate


great deal better when you have had a little
?Do you think so, Jane? Well, perhaps it
would be as well. I shall wake up all alive in
five minutes.?
So mother goes off to sleep, and the house is
quite still, except for the ticking of the old
clock in the hall, and the occasional clucking of
a fowl outside. I think of the sermon, and then
I think of old Mr Gregory?s sermons long ao-o,
c * O u ?
and how George used to gape before they were
done and try to frighten the Sunday school
children by pretending he had got his jaws fixed
open, which only made them giggle; how we
used to walk home through the clover fields of
a summer?s evening after church, Ralph with
mother, George and I on each side of father,
and how there would be a pause and a chat
with one neighbour or another, when the ser-
mon was always spoken of as ? a fine discourse,?
and the weather for the next day discussed;
how father sometimes forgot himself so much,
as to begin to talk about the morrow?s work,
when mother always gave a slight cough to
bring him to himself and make him remember
what day it was. So one thing leads on to
another, and thinking of old times makes one


think of old friends, the grass is growing over
many of them now, till I hear Phoebe clinking*
the tea-things in the kitchen and softly sing-
Time, like an ever-rolling stream
Bears all its sons away ;
They fly forgotten as a dream
Dies at the opening day.?
Then I hear Ralph?s cheerful step as he comes
along whistling?
? Jerusalem the golden
With milk and honey blest,?
and mother wakes up ready for her tea.
I am afraid I make a very bad story-teller,
because I never can stick to my subject, but
go wandering: off to something: else. Now all
O O O
this arose from my hearing about Mary?s sitting
doing nothing for an hour together, a thing I
O O o' O
cannot understand anyone doing, except of a
Sunday afternoon.
Ralph came to fetch me at eight, and though
I was quite ready to go, I was vexed at his
seeming so anxious to get me off home again.
Mrs Fontaine and the boys made a great fuss
with him, and even Mary brightened up and
made herself agreeable, but I had never seen
O '


Ralph so dull and stupid before. He seemed
to have nothing to say to them, or to care
about anything they said to him, till I really
began to feel afraid that the hot sun had made
him feel unwell.
After several brotherly hints, I got up, put on
my hat, and said good-bye. Mary, with the two
boys, came with us part of the way, through the
first field, there they left us; and I only wonder
they took the trouble to come as far as they did
with two such dull companions. For I was
bothering myself about what could be the matter
with Ralph; and he scarcely said a "word, he
who was generally so full of fun and jokes with
those boys.
When they had left us, we two walked on in
perfect silence. It was a most lovely evening
after the heat of the day, so cool, and with the
dew hanging heavy on the grass. The bats, or
flitter-mice, as we country-people call them, were
flying about quite close to our heads, and a stag
beetle came plump up against Ralph?s cheek,
only I was too anxious to laugh, seeing how
solemnly he brushed it away. So we went on
for some time, Ralph lashing the long wet grass
with his stick, I doing my best to keep my
Sunday dress out of the damp, for the path was


so narrow we could only walk one behind the
other. I was really getting so nervous that in
another minute I should have said something,
when Ralph spoke.
?Jane, I wish you would be kind to that poor
child at home. She is having a rough time of it
o o
just now.?
? Kitty! ? I exclaimed, almost speechless with
amazement. ? Why, I love the child dearly, and
I?m quite sure I have never been unkind to her
since she came into the house.?
? I don?t mean Kitty, I mean Miss Boldero.?
I only wonder I didn?t fall down straight into
the wet grass, I turned so giddy, and he was in
front of me walking and talking as steadily as
if we were speaking of every-day matters about
the farm. The next moment I thought I must
have misunderstood him, it is not easy to catch
every word a person says, when he is walking in
front of you with his head turned away, but he
went on, ?
? She puts a brave face on it, I know, and so
you might be deceived into thinking she was
happy; but I found her this evening crying as
if her heart would break, all alone in the parlour! ?
I had just enough breath left in me to say, ?
? Where was mother ? ?


? Gone to bed early with a headache. Of course
Kitty had gone too ?and she, poor child, had
been left in the twilight to think over all her
troubles.?
I was in no danger this time of making a
o o
mistake as to who the ? poor child ? referred to.
Now or never! I must give Ralph a warning,
only, somehow, I felt a little afraid. It was
very absurd, but I found myself go rather cold
and shaky as I said, ?
? You had better take care, Ralph, you know
what pity leads to sometimes.?
? It isn?t likely to lead to much in this instance,?
and his voice sounded so odd, I could hardly be-
lieve it was Ralph speaking; ? she wouldn?t have
me if I asked her.?
? Ralph, how can you be so ridiculous! ? I
exclaimed, out of all patience with him; ? any-
one can see she would be only too glad to get
the chance.?
We had reached the stile, and he stopped
with one hand on it, as he turned round and
said bitterly,?
??Then, Jane, the sooner you disabuse your
mind of that idea the better, because I have
asked her this evening and she refused me, not
very gently either.?


I was thankful to have the stile to lean upon,
for the field seemed going round and round in the
grey twilight. At last I gasped out, ?
? Whatever made you do it ? ?
? Whatever made me do it ? ? he repeated im-
patiently ; ? whatever makes anyone make a fool
of themselves ? There ; I don?t want to talk about
it,? and he was over the stile and lifting me
over before I knew where I was. By the time
we had come in sight of the farm, I had so far
recovered myself as to he extremely angry at the
idea of Ralph?s having been refused, almost as
angry as I should have been if she had accepted
him.
? Well,? I said, ? I can?t believe it. She couldn?t
have understood you, Ralph, or you couldn?t have
understood her.?
? I think I made my meaning pretty plain, and
I?m cpiite sure she did. Now, look here, Jane,
remember this is never to he mentioned to any-
one, above all not to Miss Bolder� herself. Do
you understand ? ?
?Very well, hut whatever makes you want me
to he kind to her passes my comprehension.?
? She was quite right, and I was a fool. See
if you can make things a little smoother for her,
as she won?t let me do it.?


? Really, Ralph, if I do, it will be for your sake.
I have no patience with her.?
? Well, then, for my sake, if you can?t do it for
any other reason, though I should have thought
it would have been easy enough.?
?And it was just like your kind heart, Ralph,
to think of doing such a thing when you could
not really have cared for her.?
?Do you think I would have insulted her by
asking her to marry me if I had cared for
her ? ?
He spoke so savagely that I went indoors, and
?stumbled up the steep dark staircase, with my
head in a whirl, feeling as if it must have been
a week ago since I came down that same stair-
case to pay a visit to the Fontaines.


CHAPTER Y.
lag. ?By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
Orl. ?He is drowned in the brook ; look but in and you shall
see him. ?As You Like It.
It was about a week after Jane Bertram had
paid that visit of hers to the Fontaines, that
one bright morning Dick and Mary started for
a day?s fishing. Lewis was not of the party,
owing to his having unfortunately offended
both of them in different ways. I will not
give the cause of offence in Mary?s case, as it
was a private matter of her own, with which
the public can have nothing to do ; but as all the
world has had the opportunity of hearing Dick?s
grievance for the last three days, I need not
be so reticent in the matter.
For several weeks Dick had been the happy
possessor of a lively young hedgehog, of whose
existence of course Mrs Fontaine was quite un-
aware, owing to its being, as Dick declared, ? such


a convenient beast.? When the rest of the
family were safe in their beds, Dick would descend
from his bedroom with the hedo-ehoof, which
o o ?
he deposited on the kitchen floor, there to regale
itself with black beetles all the nio-ht. In the
O
morning this ?convenient beast? was always to
be found quietly rolled up in a ball in some
corner or other, when the servants (previously
instructed) left him ?to be called for ? by Dick
in the course of the dav. This had been the
?/
manner of life of this useful and harmless animal
for some time, until one unlucky night when
Lewis waking up suddenly, thought he heard
robbers below. Up he got, and armed with a
poker descended the stairs and paraded the lower
part of the house. Soon after the whole house
rang with the most piercing yells. Out rushed
all the different members of the family from
their respective chambers in various hastily
assumed costumes. Mrs Fontaine, expecting no-
thing less than that her dear son was in the
grasp of some powerful burglar, sprang a rattle
out of her window and then flew down with
Dick to the rescue. When they reached the
kitchen they found Lewis hopping round the
room in an agony with one foot supported by
his hand, bleeding profusely.


?My dear boy ! ? shrieked his mother, ? what
is the matter ? ?
?Oh : oh ! ? howled poor Lewis, ? there?s some
awful venomous snake in the place; I put my
foot on him, and I shall be a dead man in a
few minutes."
? You awful muff,? cried Dick, choking with
laughter, ? you?ve only gone and trodden on my
hedgehog. Look, here he is.?
O O
It was all very well for Dick to laugh, but it
is no joke to put one?s bare foot on a rolled-up
hedgehog in the dark, and I cannot altogether
sympathise with Dick in his rage when, the
next morning, his favourite was drowned by Mrs
O '
Fontaine?s orders.
This was one of the reasons which led Dick
and Mary to get up early this Saturday morning
and set off for the river before Lewis had come
down to breakfast.
? And after all, Dick,? said Mary, as they
trudged along, ?it will be most horribly wet
O O 7
by the river so early, and mamma is sure to tell
Lewis where we are, and he will come after
_ 99
US.
? Not he,? said the sapient Dick; ? he?ll be
so offended at our going off like this, without
even asking him to come too, that his dignity


will keep him at home. Won?t he feel mad all
?day though ? ?
The grass certainly was dreadfully wet, and Mary
had to wait about for an hour before she could
seat herself comfortably on the bank, with her
rod in both hands, and her embroidery close by
in case of emergencies. For quiet as this part
of the river was, there were occasional passers-by,
and on the appearance of any of these, various
hasty manoeuvres had to be gone through. The
approach of any one was generally signalled to
Mary by a shrill whistle from Dick, on hearing;
which, she hastily drew in her line, laid the rod
down amongst the long grass, and by the time
the person, whoever it was, came up, Mary was
innocently occupied with her embroidery. Some-
times, of course, she was caught, when she had to
make the best of it with a very red face. If you
think it strange that a young lady of Mary?s age
should be permitted by her mother to amuse
herself in this manner, I can only repeat what
I once before stated, that Mrs Fontaine generally
allowed her children to do pretty much as they
liked. Personally, I think Mary was all the
better for these excursions with her brothers,
and that alone with them, sharing all their
pursuits and pleasures, she certainly showed


more of her real natural self, than she did
at any other time. However, I am aware
that these opinions are heterodox, and that most
people would think her better employed with
her book or her work at home, or ? doing a little
shopping ? with her mother in the village.
At anyrate, it was certainly very pleasant to-
sit by the river this morning, and though it
was rather warm every now and then, a white
�/ '
cloud swept across the sun, and a light breeze-
rippled the water, and swayed the long grass
to and fro. Dick was some little way off, higher
up the river, so it was perfectly still and quiet r
Mary sat and watched her float and dreamed,
%J
There is a boat coming along propelled by two
powerful arms, and in it sits Sir Guy de Vavasour,
Yes, Sir Guy it is, though a curious and remarkable
change has taken place in his appearance since
we last saw him. His hyacinthine locks, which
formerly rivalled the raven?s wing in their glossy
blackness, have assumed a tint of auburn so
strongly marked, as to almost claim the title of
red: and his flashing eyes have changed from
o J O
blue to brown. Still he is, as of yore, every
inch a hero, and as devotedly in love as ever.
Mary was in the middle of an exciting little
quarrel with him, for, poor fellow, she took good


care that the course of his true love should not
run too smoothly, when Dick came flying along-
laughing most uproariously, and waving some-
thing- flat and large over his head.
O O
?Oh ! I say Mary, here?s a joke! I was just
thinking how awfully hot I was, when I came
upon this queer article lying amongst the grass.
I?m going to wear it, it?s a most lovely invention.?
Dick, as he spoke, placed a huge, flapping, soft
felt hat on his head, which, falling all round like a
pent house, almost hid his merry red face from view.
? ?Ain?t it becoming ? It?s the best sort of tile
I?ve seen for a long time.?
Mary was very angry with him, but for the life
?of her she could not help laughing, as Dick twisted
himself round for her benefit.
? Beautiful, whichever way you look at it, behind
or before; it just protects the back of one?s neck,
too. Good-bye; I?m going to wear it for the rest
of the morning.
? Dick, Dick, come back ; take it off directly. Do
you know it belongs to Mr Hinton, I saw him in
it the other day. He must be somewhere about.?
?Not a sign of him anywhere. It almost looks
ns if he had found a watery grave in the river, and
left this on the bank as a token.?
?Well, you mustn?t wear it, Dick; just fancy


how awkward it would he if he came by, and I
do believe I can see him in the distance.?
Mr Hinton it was, and down went Mary?s fishing-
rod, and out came the embroidery.
? Now Dick, you must pretend you have brought
two rods with you this morning.?
? Oh, bother! what does it matter ; he isn?t old
Miss Jones or the Misses Snarler. Just fancy,,
coming across that field without any hat on, I
wonder he doesn?t have a sunstroke.?
Certainly Mr Hinton did not look particularly
cool as he came up. Dick advanced to meet him,,
hat in hand.
? I didn?t know it was yours, Mr Hinton, till my
sister told me. I found it lying in the grass. ?
?Oh, never mind. I left it here this morning-
when I came down early for a bath. I remembered
something important I had forgotten to tell the
men, and I ran oft? without it. Miss Fontaine, how
do you do ? It?s delightful by the river this morn-
ing, isn?t it ? ?
Mary assented, and there was an awkward pause.
? I wish I had got my rod with me,? said Mr
Hinton at last with an effort; he found it so
difficult to think of anything to say, and yet he
didn?t seem anxious to go.
? You can have Mary?s rod if you like ? ? said Dick


with his usual thoughtfulness; ? here it is. She?s
no good at fishing; when she gets a bite, she just
catches hold of the rod with both hands, and jerks
the line out as hard as she can go.?
? Oh, but I couldn?t think of depriving your
sister of her rod,? replied Mr Hinton, politely.
Mary could have boxed Dick?s ears with the
greatest pleasure in the world, but she had to
restrain her feelings, and assure Mr Hinton, ? that
she had her work to do, which she very much pre-
ferred to fishing at any time.?
Whether Mr Hinton believed this or not I can-
not say, but at anyrate it did away with his
scruples, and he seated himself with great alacrity
by Mary?s side, taking possession of her rod.
? Oh, I say,? said Dick, ? you?re not going to sit
down, are you ? You?ll never catch anything at
that rate.?
?My dear fellow,? said Mr Hinton rather im-
patiently, ? if you had been on your legs looking
after a set of impudent, lazy haymakers since
six o?clock this morning, you would be glad to sit
down, I can tell you.?
Dick having nothing to say to this view of the
O O
matter marched oft' to his fishing, and left his
sister and Mr Hinton to entertain each other.
Mary?s heart fluttered. Really this was almost as


exciting as some of her encounters with Sir Guy;
blue sky above, blue waters below, a young man
and a maiden, what more could the most romantic
desire ? But things that are very pleasant to
imagine, are not always so delightful when they
really happen. Nowhere was Mary, who, as the Lady
Mary, was quite equal to much more trying emer-
gencies, feeling hot and foolish, because she could
o 7 o
think of nothing to say; and Sir Guy, instead of
making half-a-dozen pretty speeches, one after
another, sat quite silent, with his eyes seemingly
glued to his float.
However, this lamentable state of things did not
last long, both soon found their voices, and a very
agreeable half-hour ensued. Mary took the oppor-
tunity of Dick?s absence, to assure Mr Hinton that
she only fished occasionally to please her brother
Dick, ? who always seems to want to have me
with him wherever he goes,? a feeling which Mr
Hinton thought he could fully enter into. Then
Mr Hinton spoke of his troubles with his farm,
with which Mary sympathised, and told him how
much Ralph Bertram was sometimes worried;
and Mr Hinton said, ?Yes, but not half so much?
as he himself was. Ralph had got a mother and
sister to help him, and feel for him, whereas he,
poor Tom Hinton, had no one.


This view of the case was certainly a very
touching one, and, aided by an expressive glance
from the brown eyes, made Mary?s heart go pit-
a-pat in a most delightful manner. Mr Hinton
went on talking.
?Do you remember, Miss Fontaine, that after-
noon when there was such a tremendous thunder-
storm, and I overtook you in Friar?s Lane ? ?
? Yes,? said Mary, blushing; ? I had no umbrella
and you lent me yours, and saw me home. I teas
frightened that day.?
? It certainly was a fearful storm, but I enjoyed
that walk awfully. Somehow the rain coming
down so fast made it so jolly, and?and?l don?t
know when I enjoyed a walk so much. But of
course it was horrid for you ? ?
? I was very wet when I got home,? replied
Marv, cautiously.
? Were you ? I?m so sorry. I was half a mind
to call the next day and ask after you, only some-
how or other I didn?t quite like to. And then I
didn?t know your name either.?
? Didn?t you, really,? said Mary much surprised.
?No, I only found it out the other day when
I met you in the fields with Miss Bertram. I
think Fontaine is a wonderfully pretty name.?
? Young man, do you know who said fishing


was a worm at one end and a fool at the
other ? ?
Mary and Mr Hinton both started violently
at hearing a voice suddenly utter these words,
close behind them. Turning round they saw
old Mr Basset smiling blandly upon them, and
looking rather entertained at the spectacle of two
flaming faces presented to him.
In her fright Mary had dropped her work,
and as she stooped to pick it up her com-
panion greeted the new-comer in no very cordial
tones.
? You?ve a wonderfully light tread for a man
�/ o
of your age and size, Mr Basset.?
?So I have,? replied Mr Basset cheerfully;
?so I have. Nice day for fishing. How de do.
Miss Mary. Very warm this morning, isn?t it ? ?
Mary assented, trying to believe that the re-
mark had not been occasioned by the colour of
her cheeks, and returned the salutation with as
much self-possession as she could summon to her
aid.
? A lovely morning,? continued Mr Basset, seat-
ing himself on the other side of Mary, and
contemplating his little fat legs spread out before
him. ? How?s your mamma, my dear ? ?
Mr Basset had an amiable habit of ?my dear-


ing? all the young ladies of Cragford. Some of
o �/ o o
them thought it a great liberty, and, on this
occasion, Mary felt inclined to give the stout
little figure by the side of her a gentle push into
the river.
?Mr Hinton will think him one of my most
intimate friends,? she thought indignantly.
Mr Hinton, however, had other things to occupy
his mind just then, and hardly noticed the obser-
vation.
On being informed that Mrs Fontaine was in
o
good health, Mr Basset expressed himself as being
much pleased to hear it, adding, that she ought
to have followed her daughter?s example this fine
day, and come out to enjoy the fresh air.
? Only you must take care of your complexion
my dear, with a sun like this. Look at Mr
Hinton, what care he takes of his. I?m sure
he?s quite an example to all the young ladies in
the place ; quite an example.?
Mr Hinton?s only notice of this remark took
the form of a vindictive glare, which did not
affect Mr Basset in the very least. No one could
have less occasion to take care of his complexion
than the unfortunate Tom Hinton, seeing that it
would have been a case of shutting the barn
door when the steed was stolen. The sun had


already freckled him to the utmost extent of its
power.
?How are the haymakers getting on,Mr Hinton??
? Oh, splendidly; we?re getting in the hay like
a house on fire.?
? Glad to hear it,? said Mr Basset spitefully;
? hope it?ll last. The glass is going down.?
? Oh, it?s been doing that for the last week or
so. I don?t think anything of that.?
? S?pose you?ve been working pretty hard your-
self ? ?
? I should think I have. I can assure you, Mr
�/ 7
Basset, this is the first rest I have had for the
last two weeks.?
? Ah, nothing like hard work for young people,
keeps ?em out of mischief. There?s Miss Mary
never raised her eyes from her work since I sat
down; quite a pattern young lady.?
Poor Mr Hinton and Mary felt as if a buzzing
gnat was hovering about them, every now and
then giving a sting at the one, then at the other,
and the worst of it was, they could neither of
them do anything but sit still and endure it. I
don?t know which of them felt most relieved when
Dick appeared upon the scene.
? Caught anything, Dick ? ? they said, both
together.


? Only a few miserable little dace,? said Dick,
in a disgusted tone. ? I believe it?s too hot for
the creatures to care to come up to the surface
at all. I say, Mary, isn?t that the mater walking
along right over there in the lane, can you see ? ?
Mi- Basset scrambled to his feet with wonderful
agility.
?So it is! ? he exclaimed, making a telescope of
his two hands. ? Miss Mary, my dear, it really
is your mamma.?
? I daresay,? said Mary calmly, ? she often comes
this way.?
? All, but you didn?t expect her this morning,
did you ? I really must go and see if I can catch
her up. Shall I ask her to come on here ? ?
? Yes, do,? said Mary, looking him full in the
face, ? and mind you tell her that Mr Hinton is
here fishing, and that we will manage to find her
a seat in the shade, if she will only come.?
Mr Basset looked as spiteful as such an amiable
old gentleman could look, and trotted off with a
very baffled expression of countenance.
Mr Hinton cast an admiring glance at Mary,
which for once was wasted upon her, as her eyes
were fixed on her work.
? Doesn?t he look like an old woman in the
distance, Miss Fontaine ??


And Mary, looking up at the retreating figure
of Mr Basset shuffling along, was fain to join
in the laugh.
Mr Hinton sat on some time longer, long enough
to allow of Mrs Fontaine?s putting in an appear-
ance, if she had wished to do so, and then re-
luctantly he arose.
? I expect my men have just done nothing this
morning, but it can?t be helped. As some old
fellow, yEsop, I believe, says, the bow can?t be
always on the stretch. Miss Fontaine, I haven?t
caught you a single fish, I?m sorry to say.?
? Never mind, I daresay they are more comfort-
able where they are.?
? I should think so, on a day like this. Dick
old fellow, you?ll give me a look in at the Gable
Farm some day ? ?
? I?ll come,? said Dick promptly.
? Yes, do, and mind you come soon, I?m awfully
dull there of an evening all by myself.?
He took off his remarkable hat to Mary, gave
one last look, and was gone.
The river flowed on, the sun shone as brightly
as ever ; Dick?s voice was heard in one continual
stream of talk, and down the river in his boat
floated Sir Guy de Vavasour, floated away out of
Mary?s life for ever and ever.


CHAPTER VI.
Love can transpose to form and dignity ;
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind.
Midsummer Night's Dream.
Yes, Sir Guy de Vavasour was dethroned, and
Tom Hinton reigned in his stead. It seemed rather
a ? come down ? from the lofty to the prosaic ; but
so it was, and I cannot explain it except by draw-
ing attention to the fact that most people prefer
substance to shadow when they can get it.
After Mary reached home that Saturday, she
told her mother how they had encountered Mr
Hinton, and how he had stayed with them fishing
for some time. Mrs Fontaine received the intelli-
gence calmly, and when she was alone had a
little quiet laugh to herself.
? That stupid old man, with all his hints and
mysteries. I am glad I never asked him a
single question. I knew Mary would tell me
all there was to hear.?


Of course Dick made his way over to the Gable
Farm once or twice the next week. Equally was
it a matter of course that on one of these occasions,
Mr Hinton should walk home with him, and be
invited to enter the house.
Mrs Fontaine received him with the usual gentle
friendliness she extended to most people (Mr
Basset excepted), and ended by declaring him to
be ? a most agreeable young man ; in fact one of
the nicest young men she had met for a long
time.?
As it was Mrs Fontaines happy lot to be alvajs
coming across some one who was either ? the nicest
man? or ?the nicest woman? she had ever met,
this piece of praise was not of such an overwhelm-
ing character as at first sight it appeared. Still
there was no doubt that, in a very little v hile,
Mr Hinton managed to establish himself as a
universal favourite in the house, and this position
he continued to retain, when the state of his
feelings began to be apparent to even the most
careless observer.
Nature, despite her other good gifts, had
neglected to bestow upon Tom Hinton the very
smallest power of concealing his thoughts and
feelings from a heartless world, so that Tom in
love became immediately an object of derision


yane Bertram s Story. gy
or sympathy, as the hearts of the onlookers dic-
tated. Even Mrs Fontaine could scarcely avoid
becoming aware that Mr Hinton spent five even-
ings out of the seven at her house; that his
devotion to herself and to her wishes could no
longer, bj the utmost stretch of benevolence, be
attributed to ?his kind, thoughtful disposition,?
and that there could be only one conclusion to be
drawn from the fact, that he was one day in the
wildest spirits, and the next in the depths of
despondency.
Of comse His Fontaine kept her conclusions
to herself; but one unlucky day Dick was visited
hy a fit of inspiration, and the great idea dawned
upon him. I do not believe that such a thing
would ever have happened if Dick had been
m his usual health; but he had had a head-
ache, and so was condemned to lie on the sofa
for an horn- or two. Not feeling sleepy, there
vas nothing he could do to occupy his mind
but think, and so, what I have stated, came to
pass.
They were all?Mrs Fontaine, Mary and Lewis
?sitting very quiet, so as not to disturb Dick,
who was supposed to be napping. The two
ladies were at their work, Lewis with his
hands up to his ears at his lessons, when


suddenly Dick sprang up from his sofa with a
shout, and then fell back, striking his hand
upon his heart with a most dramatic air, and
laughing immoderately.
o o t/
? What is the matter with you, Dick ? ? cried
his mother.
? Dick, are you going out of your mind ? ?
exclaimed Mary, rather crossly, for he had
interrupted an interesting train of thought,
? Oh! ? cried Dick in an ecstasy of joy, ? I
never thought of it before, but I?m positive of
it now. Tom Hinton is in love with Mary.
Yes, you may stare all of you, but it?s true, as
true as that I?m sitting here. Oh, Mary, Mary,
all contrary, who ever would have thought it ?
Never mind, he?s a jolly good fellow, though
he has got red hair and freckles."?
The three different members of the family
received this startling announcement in three
different ways. Mrs Fontaine said severely,?
? Hush, hush, Dick! mind your own busi-
ness and don?t go fancying all manner of non-
sense.?
Lewis looked up from his books for a moment
with an expression of great contempt, saying,?
?Is that all ? As if anyone with eyes in his
head couldn?t have seen that long ago.?


And Mary?poor Mary?with flaming cheeks,
could only say,?
? Mamma, Dick ought to be shut up in a mad-
house. It?s the only place he?s fit for.?
Mrs Fontaine passed over this violent speech,
thinking the provocation considerable. And yet
Mary was not so very angry after all. If Dick
had been further inspired to inform the company
that, in his opinion, Mary was also in love with
Mr Hinton, he might have really succeeded in
making himself thoroughly detestable; but hap-
pily Dick?s intuitions did not carry him so far.
The subject once so thoroughly ventilated, could
never be shut up and ignored as it had hitherto
been ; in fact, the only wonder was that it had
remained 'perdu so long, seeing that Tom Hinton?s
devotion was of the most open character to be
imagined. I am afraid Dick rather profited by
this state of things; he made hay while the sun
shone, for who could resist taking things from
Mi Hinton when he seemed so dreadfully anxious
to get rid of them ; and why should Dick decline
to accept a fishing-rod or a cricket bat, when the
only result would be that these desirable articles
would immediately be offered to Lewis. Not that
Lewis, as a rule, came in for so many of these good
things, partly because Mr Hinton had the discern-


ment to see which was the favourite brother, and
partly because Lewis himself was not so accessible
to a bribe as the more amiable Dick. Lewis was-
apt, in the words of Mr Hinton himself, to turn
nasty on occasions, and to make himself unpleas-
ant to both Mary and her lover. He rather prided
himself upon having plenty of good, sound, practi-
cal sense, and felt it his duty to look at the matter
from a practical point of view. After Dick?s-
revelation, he took it upon himself, as the elder
son, to have a consultation with his mother on
the subject.
? What do you think of this affair, mother, be-
tween Mary and Tom Hinton ? ? he asked with
a fine air of impartiality.
Mrs Fontaine, who hated a discussion, and
much preferred to let things look after them-
selves, attempted a weak-minded evasion of the
question.
? I think, my dear, it is better not to talk
about these things before the time, they so
often come to nothing, and we have only Dick?s
idea to go upon.?
? Dick?s ideas wouldn?t weigh much with me,?
replied Lewis scornfully ; ? but mother, if you can
see Tom Hinton mooning about here half the
days of the week, and then think there?s no-


thing in it?why?? Lewis shrugged his shoulders
impatiently, as unable to express his sense of
his mother?s denseness in any other way.
?Of course,? said Mrs Fontaine, anxious to
retrieve her character for discernment, ? I have
noticed that there have been great attentions:
O 7
but then when you have lived as loner as I have,
Lewis, you will find those very often mean no-
thing. I remember a gentleman paying a great
many attentions to a sister of mine; we all
thought he would propose to her, but, dear me,
nothing came of it after all.?
O
? Anyone had better not go trying those tricks
with my sister,? said Lewis fiercely.
? Really, Lewis, I can?t understand you. I
thought you didn?t much care about him for
Mary.?
? I don?t like the fellow particularly, but I?m
not going to have him making fools of us all.
But that s all nonsense,? Lewis added, coolinor
down; ? he?s not at all that sort.?
?No, I don?t think he is,? acquiesced Mrs
Fontaine. ?He is a very nice fellow and a
thorough gentleman, so I think that?s all we
need say about the matter.?
Mrs Fontaine got up as she spoke, and tried
to make her escape.


? Then you don?t think Mary could do better,
%/ *
I do. After all, what is he but a farmer, and
not much of a one either. You should hear Ber-
tram laugh at his farming ; he?ll never make it
o o -
pay-?
?He has private property,? mildly suggested
Mrs Fontaine.
? Yes, of course; it would be a bad lookout
for him if he hadn?t.?
? And after all, my dear, we must allow for
' 1/
people?s feelings. If Mary cares for him, she
will be happier with him than she would be
with a richer man she did not love.?
? Oh, well,? said Lewis, with a short laugh,
? I don?t know much about hearts and feelings
and all that sort of thing. I daresay it?s all
right.?
?Oh yes, it?s sure to be all right. These
things are always better left to manage them-
selves,? answered Mrs Fontaine, much relieved;
and so the consultation ended, leaving Mary?s
prospects much as it found them.
Certainly Mrs Fontaine?s suggestion, that Mr
Hinton might mean nothing by his attentions,
was a most unfounded one. If ever there was
a poor mortal hopelessly, helplessly over head
and ears in love, Tom Hinton was that mortal.


Not even in the person of Sir Guy had Mary
possessed a more devoted lover, and it came
upon her rather with the shock of a surprise.
It is true she was always fancying people were
in love with her, and she had a quite unwar-
ranted belief in her own beauty and general at-
tractions ; but underneath all this there had
always lain a doubt, a latent fear, that after all
she was nothing so very remarkable; that after
all she was only a pretty girl among many other
pretty girls, and not the dazzling, fascinating
beauty she would fain believe in. Down, down
in the very depths of Mary?s heart there lin-
gered a faint acknowledgment of the fact, that
she had once or twice in her life been mis-
taken as to the extent and power of her
charms.
Dr Parkyns? assistant had been one of many,
and had unconsciously lent his aid to bring
about this desirable result. But now Tom
Hinton arose, a devout worshipper at the
shrine, and Mary felt such a sense of gratitude
to him for placing her once more securely on
her pedestal, that there was a fair chance of
its becoming a still warmer feeling. But all
the same she -was surprised. For it did not
seem so much for her beauty (though un-


doubtedly that had been the attraction in the
first instance) that Tom Hinton loved her, but
just for himself, because she was Mary, and
therefore in his eves everything that was good
V o O
and true and worthy to be loved. The dis-
covery of this fact produced a curious feeling
of humility in Mary. If he had been ever so
extravagantly in love with her beauty, she
would have thought it perfectly natural, and
only her right; but when he showed her
plainly that he thought her not only the
loveliest, but the best, truest, sweetest girl he
' * o
had ever known, she felt a sudden pang at her
heart; was he not in love with a shadow ?
Ay, was she not to him ten times more of
a shadow than ever Sir Guy de Vavasour had
been to her.
It was just when matters were in this critical
and exciting condition that Mary received a
most inopportune invitation to pay a fortnight?s
visit to an aunt living thirty miles off. Con-
siderably to Mrs Fontaine?s astonishment, this
invitation was immediately accepted. Acting up
to her usual principles, Mrs Fontaine said no-
thing, beyond a quiet remark as Mary was fold-
ing up her note of acceptance,?
? What will poor Tom say, I wonder ? ?


Mary gave a little conscious laugh of vis-
ible enjoyment, and went off to post her
letter, apparently quite unmoved by this sug-
gestion.
As fate would have it, Tom Hinton never
came near the house for the next two or three
days, so that it seemed probable that Mary
would have to depart without even saying good-
bye to him, ?a circumstance upon which she had
not at all reckoned. The boys, too, seemed to
have suddenly adopted Mr Longfellow?s idea, that
? to stay at home is best,? and never went near
the Gable Farm. It was very trying, for Mary
could have trusted to Mr Hinton?s obtaining
the information of her approaching departure
from Dick?s voluble tongue. But no, evening
O 7 O
after evening Mary expected to hear one or
other of the boys spring up and say, ? Well, I?m
off to the Gable Farm;? or, ?Mother, I?m just
going to run round to Tom Hinton?s place,?
but in vain she hoped and expected ; they never
went. IS either did it seem to occur to anyone,
except herself, to even notice that Tom Hinton
had not put in his appearance as usual. If he
didn t come to-day he would come to-morrow.
M hat did it matter ? They were each of them
busy and interested with their own concerns


and could get on very well for a time without
him.
? What selfish creatures hoys are,? thought
Mary bitterly, the evening before her departure,
as she heard the merry voices and laughter of
Geoff and Dick in the garden below, while she
was packing in her own room. ? They never
care about anyone but themselves and their
own pleasure. ? Out of sight out of mind ? with
them. And mamma too, she might know??
Mary went on furiously packing her port-
manteau, feeling all the while that dainty frills
and even pretty dresses were vanity when they
had to be worn thirty miles away from the
Gable Farm.
Suddenly there came up from the garden the
sound of a cheerful voice laughing and talking*
with the boys. Though there had been no ring
at the front door bell, Tom Hinton had arrived.
He must have come through the fields from the
Bertrams? farm, thought Mary, as her heart
fluttered, and she jumped up from the floor,
feeling, now he had come, as if she could not
go down to see him. She was still linger-
ing, when her mother?s voice calling her gave
her the necessary excuse for descending the
stairs.


? You can finish your packing by-and-by,?
said Mrs Fontaine. ? You must say good-bye to
Mr Hinton, as you go to-morrow.?
Mary went out with her mother into the
garden, where the shadows were lengthening
o 1 00
across the lawn as the sun sank down in the
crimson west. It was a pretty garden, with
its smooth well-kept turf and winding shady
paths, and to poor Tom Hinton it appeared at
at this moment a kind of Eden.
Somehow or other, though they all kept
talking, no one mentioned the fact of
Mary?s departure on the ensuing morning,
and Tom Hinton, in blissful unconscious-
ness of coming evil, was in his gayest
spirits.
Mrs Fontaine and Mary were sitting on a
J O
garden seat, Tom Hinton either sitting or stand-
ing, as the mood took him, ?he was always a
restless mortal, ?and the boys were stretched
on the grass at their feet. There had been
a great deal of talking and laughing, till at
last there came a slight pause, and Mrs Fontaine
said, ?
? How did you get in, Tom ? ? ?she had fallen
into the habit of sometimes calling him by his
Christian name. ? I never heard any sound till


you walked into the drawing-room from the
garden.?
?Oh, I came through the fields from Bertram?s
farm. It was rather cheek of me to come in in
that abrupt way, but I thought perhaps you
wouldn?t mind. I had to call in at the farm on
my way.?
? I dare say,? said Dick, maliciously, ? you often
have to call in there, don?t you ? Did you see
the charmer ? ?
?Oh ! Miss Bolder�, you mean, I suppose. Yes,
I saw her; she certainly is a wonderfully pretty
girl.?
For the first time a pang of jealousy and alarm
shot through Mary?s heart. Did he often go to
the Bex'ti'ams? ? Had he been thex'e the last few
evenings ? What did Dick mean by laugh-
ino- ? And she was going- away for a fortnight;
O O O �/
and oh! how she wished she had never px?omised
to go.
Outwardly, she sat pex-fectly quiet and calm,
but within her bosoxxx thex'e raged a pex-fect
tumult of conflicting emotions. She fox-got all
Toxxx Hinton?s disadvantages, upon which she had
been apt to dwell sometimes, ?his want of personal
beauty, his lack of worldly goods, his amazing
simplicity, which sometimes annoyed her above


all other things,?and she only remembered with
painful distinctness his merry, cheerful voice; his
unfailing good temper (except when she had tried
him beyond all bearing), and above all, his absolute
unswerving devotion to herself. How could she
exist now without that devotion ? For one moment
she pictured her life without Tom in it and felt
she should never be happy again.
Meanwhile, Tom Hinton was in profound ignor-
ance of what was passing in Mary?s mind. The
idea of anyone, least of all Mary, thinking it
possible that he could care for any girl beside
herself, never entered his head. So he pondered
over Mary?s sudden silence with a doubtful mind.
Mrs Fontaine spoke again.
?Yes, Lottie Boldero is the prettiest girl I have
seen for a long while, and the nicest.?
Tom was so busy pursuing his own painful
train of reflection, that he allowed this remark
to pass by without any opposition,?a circum-
stance which confirmed Mary?s suspicions. She
rose up with her heart as heavy as lead, saying,?
? Well, mamma, I think I had better go and finish
my packing. It seems very dreary out here in
the garden, now the sun has gone down.?
Poor Tom! here were two stabs for him. She
had found it dreary out here when he had been


in the seventh heaven; and packing?the very
sound of the word made him feel ill.
? Are?are you going away ? ? he asked, with
such a lugubrious expression of countenance, that
Dick was obliged to roll over on the grass to hide
O &
his amusement.
? Yes, only for a fortnight though,? replied Mary,
contriving to convey, by her tone, the depth of
her grief that it was not for a longer period.
? I suppose you are looking forward to it very
much ? ? said Tom, in the deepest abyss of despair.
A whole fortnight, she might as well have said a
year at once.
?Oh yes! I am sure to have a delightful visit.
o
My aunt knows so many people, and it is always
lively there.?
This was such a very highly-coloured picture
of Aunt Hester?s mode of life, that Mrs Fontaine
opened her eyes in mild surprise. Mary had been
known to style her aunt?s house ? the dullest place
under the sun.?
? I?m sure I hope you will enjoy yourself,? said
Tom, heroically.
? Thank you. Good-bye. I sha?n?t come down
again, because I have such a number of things
o 7 o
to do.?
She shook hands, and she was gone. Gone, and


they would not see each other again for a whole
v O
fortnight, and she did not care or seem to mind
in the very least. Well, he had been a fool?one of
the blindest of fools, ?but at anyrate he saw clearly
now. He would never go near the house again;
he would sell his farm, be off to Australia, and
never set foot in England more. So he raged as
o o
he walked rapidly home that evening, more savage
with himself than with anyone else, though he
did feel that he had been badly treated.
?For she did give me some sort of encourage-
o o
ment at times, or else I fancied so. Once I could
almost have sworn she cared for me a little. What
a fool what a perfect fool I must have
been.?
But calling one?s self a fool does not generally
afford one any very great consolation, and so,
when Tom got home, and had to get through the
rest of his evening as best he could, he felt
supremely miserable, and not only miserable, but
wounded to the quick.
He paced up and down the darkening parlour,
till his old housekeeper came to ask him if he
wanted anything, as a gentle hint that he dis-
turbed her in the kitchen below. It seemed as
if the evening would never pass, and when he
looked forward to fourteen more such evenino-g


to be got through, somehow his heart sank within
him.
? And at the end o� those fourteen days, in
what respect shall I be the better ? ? he said to
himself, as he lighted his candle at ten o?clock,
? She won?t be any the more likely to care about
me when she comes back than she does now. Very
likely she?ll meet some fellow where she is going*
to stay; no one could help falling in love with
her. Well, she won?t ever find anyone who will
love her more than I do. But I shan?t trouble
her any more, I shall keep away altogether.?
Nevertheless, his last thought, as he fell asleep,
was, ? She will be sure to write to Dick, and Dick
will be sure to show me her letters.?
Mary went off the next morning in a pourincr
rain. Up to the last moment she had a faint hope
that Tom Hinton would appear at the railway
station, but he never came. The last person she
saw through the dim, blurred glass of the railway
carriage was old Mr Basset, standing on the plat-
form waving his hand to her, and wishing her a
very pleasant visit.?
Mary was alone in the carriage, the wind camo
whistling through the cracks in the window frame,
and the rain dashed in fitful gusts against the glass.


There was nothing to be seen of the country but
a washed-out looking landscape under an inky sky,
and Mary leant her head against the side of the
carriage and cried till she could cry no longer.
W hen she began to get near her destination,
she made vigorous efforts to efface all signs of
tears, for Aunt Hester was a very sharp-eyed
old lady, and she was sure to be at the station
to meet her niece,?stormy or fine. Aunt Hester
was a sister of the late Mr Fontaine, and did
what she could, as she herself said, ?to look
after poor John?s children, who, between you
and I, are terribly spoilt?terribly spoilt. Their
mother, poor thing, a very weak-minded sort
of person?amiable you know?but weak, very
weak.?
It was fortunate for Mary that, what with look-
ing after her niece?s luggage, getting it safely
strapped behind the little pony carriage, and man-
agmg f� drive the pony through the wind and rain.
Aunt Hester had no attention to spare for Mary
herself. Aunt Hester was comfortably off, but
she would have thought it a sinful piece of
extravagance to hire a close fly for the con-
a eyance of herself and niece, when she had her
own pony chaise, and a good manly mackintosh
to protect her from the rain. So they struggled


along gallantly, or rather the pony struggled,
and Aunt Hester flicked him at intervals with
the whip, or gave him a little reassuring jerk at
the reins, just to let him know she was behind
him, so he had better put his best leg foremost,
or dreadful things might happen to him. Mary,
meanwhile, did her best to hold up the huge
gig umbrella over her aunt and self. She was
so miserable, that she extracted a certain amount
of morbid enjoyment from this accumulation of
discomforts, as a person with violent toothache
feels for the moment a slight sense of relief when
he knocks his head against the wall.
? Here we are all safe and sound,? said Aunt
Hester at last. A congratulatory speech which
fell heavily on Mary?s ear, who for the last few
minutes had been wishing the chaise would turn
over, and she could get slightly injured, so that
she could get sent back home to Cragford.
Aunt Hester?s house and garden were of
moderate size, and on a bright day with the
sun shining on them looked very pretty. But
this morning, with the evergreens all dripping
with wet, and the flowers with their heads lying
prone on the beds, the place was not such as to
inspire a despondent person with cheerfulness.
To Mary it appeared the very acme of dismal-


ness, and she got out of the chaise and followed
her aunt up the path, longing to be quiet in
her own room, to have another good cry. Oh,
home, home, sweet, sweet home, how could she
ever have been so silly as to leave it.


CHAPTER VII.
But I am constant as the Northern Star,
Of whose true fixed and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.
Julius Ccesar.
Mary was not at any time a very great favourite
of her Aunt Hester?s ; she was not active or lively
enough to suit her aunt?s taste, and in this-
visit she did not seem destined to create a more
favourable impression. For how unutterably dull
Mary found it, how fearfully slow the days-
seemed to pass away; and yet she was, in Aunt
Hester?s opinion, having a remarkable lively time
of it. Had she not been out to tea three nights
running; had not the Miss Phillips (their
ages varied from forty-five to sixty) been to tea
with her; had she not been taken to see the
Ruins, which she had only seen three or four
times before; and?crowning excitement of all
had she not the prospect of going to the Flower


Show. What more could any girl in her senses
have left to wish for ? What more indeed ? And
I am bound to admit that any girl of simple tastes,
with a fair amount of penetration, and some sense
?of humour, might have extracted a considerable
amount of amusement from these materials. But
Mary possessed neither of these two latter
qualifications. She had never taken the trouble
to observe other people, except as they concerned
herself ; what they thought of her, and whether
they admired her, and was therefore quite in-
capable of being interested or even amused by
the actual persons themselves.
She was quite insensible to the oddities and
affectations of the three Miss Phillips, as insensible
as she was to their genuine goodness and kind-
heartedness ; she sat and talked to them, but
they produced no more impression on her mind
than so many shadows. Perhaps some people
will say she was all the better for not wanting
to laugh at her neighbours. I cannot agree with
them. Do I love my neighbour the less because
I laugh at him sometimes? Not at all. Heaven
defend me from the people whom no one can
laugh at; the people who always do the right
thing in precisely the right way, and who never
made a mistake in their lives.


However, to Mary Fontaine the Miss Phillips
were the three Miss Phillips, not the sort of people
to he much impressed either by her beauty or
manners, and therefore uninteresting to the last
degree, and not worth the trouble of trying to-
please. The Miss Phillips, on their side, said
Mary was ? a pretty girl, but rather silly; don?t
seem to have much in her. Curious thing that a
clever woman like Miss Fontaine should have such
an uninteresting girl for her niece.?
o o
Mary?s dulness of spirits, lack of conversation,
and general indifference to everything around her,
drew down upon her head several sharp speeches
from Aunt Hester herself, such as, ?
? Ah, girls were very different in my young*
days. They didn?t turn up their noses at being-
invited out to tea, I can tell you. Why, when
I was your age I should have been nearly wild
with delight at being asked to drink tea with
O C>
three such sensible, well-informed women as the
Miss Phillips.?
Or else it was, ?
? Mary, do you know you have sat there
without speaking a word for the last half-hour ?
Anyone would think you had got no brains,
child. Do, for goodness? sake, try and be more
lively.?


Poor Mary fervently wished herself at home,
where she could speak or be silent as she liked,
without exciting remark. Ah! what would Tom
Hinton say if he were to hear these unkind
speeches addressed to her ; a consolatory thought,
which was speedily followed by the bitter re-
flection that very likely he would not care in the
least; very likely he was quite happy spending
his evenings at the Bertrams? farm, and talking
O 7 O
to Miss Boldero; very likely he never thought
of Mary at all now. How dreadfully slow did
the days seem to drag away, not even thinking
of the coming joys and glories of the flower show,
about which Aunt Hester talked so incessantly,
could make the time pass quickly. If she could
have been left to herself and her troubles, she
thought she could have found it more endurable,
but Aunt Hester hardly ever failed to accompany
her in her walks, and, of course, indoors it was
impossible to be alone.
The morning began with breakfast at half-past
seven. Mary alwaj's wondered at this, as making
the day still more unnecessarily long, but Aunt
Hester was very particular about it, as being the
only way in which she could accomplish the work
before her. After breakfast, Aunt Hester went
otf to give her orders to the cook, and for


about half-an-hour Mary had the parlour to her-
self, to be miserable in to her heart?s content.
Then she went with her aunt into the p-arden
O J
where they raked, and hoed, and weeded for an
hour. After this, Aunt Hester decreed that
exhausted nature should be recruited by a rest
in the arbour, and a refection of currant cake.
This astonished Mary as much as the early break-
fast, for how could anyone want to eat currant
cake so soon after breakfast ? Moreover, thouoh
Aunt Hester provided thus against hunger on
the part of her guest, it never seemed to occur
to her that, after working in the hot sun, she
might also feel thirst. Mary once ventured to
put the matter in this light before her aunt,
upon which she was informed that there was
nothing more dangerous than to drink anything
when you were hot. In fact, Aunt Hester had
known a young lady who had died from it, and
she certainly should not allow her niece, for whose
well-being she considered herself responsible, to
endanger her existence in this manner. So Mary
sat and eat her cake, which, being rather stale,
was difficult to swallow, and she generally ended
by half-choking herself, much to her aunt?s dis-
gust. Then, half-an-hour having been spent in
this agreeable manner, they went indoors, put on


their thino-s, and went out for a walk. Some-
times it was down the village shopping, more
often it was through the lanes or woods, where,
as Mary often said to herself, ? you never met
a creature.? By the time they got home again
the early dinner was ready, and after that, Aunt
Hester had her afternoon nap, while Mary was
once more left to her own devices. This was
the pleasantest part of the day; she took her
book and work, went into the garden and read a
little, worked a little, and dreamed a great deal
more than she read or worked. Sometimes she
was able to spend the whole afternoon like this,
but more often Aunt Hester woke up early, and
came out to keep her company.
In the evening, if no one came to tea, she played
and sang to her aunt, and had to bear a good
deal of severe criticism as to the way she held
her head or her hands while performing. Aunt
Hester was not enough of a musician to be able
to detect a wrong note, if Mary had committed
such an error, so she criticised what she could,
and left the rest to Fate. At nine o?clock, the
sedate elderly servant brought in the modest
supper, then came prayers, then bed, and ? there?s
another day gone,? sighed Mary, with a sense of
relief.


One morning, when Mary got up and pulled
aside her blind, she made the terrible discovery
that it was raining. Not a gentle, diffident
shower, but a steady, hopeless downpour.
? Whatever shall I do with myself all day??
she thought, as she let the blind drop with the
most dismal forebodings. When she got down-
stairs she found Aunt Hester in not the most
amiable of tempers, for though Mary had forgotten
the fact, this was the day for that most stupen-
dous event, the flower show, to take place. To
go to a flower show in a pouring rain was what
even Aunt Hester hardly felt capable of, so she was
cross accordingly.
O �/
The morning passed in lamentations and constant
appeals to the weather-glass, which persistently
refused to go up. It certainly was a most hope-
less sort of day.
M ell, said Aunt Hester, as they sat at dinner,
? there?s only one thing that comforts me. That
is, that I didn?t buy tickets beforehand, but waited
to pay at the gate. Susan Phillips tried hard to
persuade me to take tickets, but ?no, no,? I said,
?I ve been bitten that way once before, and once
is enough.? I took tickets for a concert that was
to take place in the public hall, and what do
you think happened ? Why, the hall was burnt


down to the ground just the day before, and
there was my money gone and nothing to show
for it. It was all very well for the vicar to
say that the charity ?it was for a hospital ?
got the money just the same; but I didn?t
give my money for a hospital, I gave it for a
concert.?
? Perhaps it will clear up after dinner,? sug-
gested Mary.
She had made this remark about six times in
the course of the morning, for the sake of saying
something;, and Aunt Hester must be excused a
O J
little irritation at the seventh repetition.
? Clear up, child, how can you talk such rubbish 1
Does that sound like clearing up ?? as the rain
came beating against the window-pane. ?No, it?s
just such another day as the one you came in,
do you remember ? ?
Mary did remember very distinctly.
? No,? continued Aunt Hester with gloomy
decision, ?we must get our books and our
work, and make the best of it indoors. You
shall read me some of Hallam?s History, and
we will try to make it a profitable afternoon,
at anyrate.?
As Aunt Hester was disappointed, she intended
to make the disappointment as great as possible,


V inflicting on herself and niece as much of
as they could both stand, more
especially as in her heart she rather doubted the
sincerity of Mary s regret. But, to a certain extent,
Mary vas really sorry; she "would much rather have
been at the flower show than have been shut up
in the parlour reading Hallam?s History to Aunt
Hester, who very soon went off to sleep.
At last Mary got up and went to the window;
it was still raining, though not so heavily, and
there was a break here and there in the clouds.
A sudden longing seized her to get out into the
fresh air, if only for a little while.
?Aunt Hester,? she said softly, ?can I o-o out
for a little while into the village ? I want some
silks for my work, and it isn?t so wet as it was.?
?Go out!? nonsense, child,? replied Aunt Hester,
half roused up from her nap; ? you will only catch
your death of cold.?
?Oh no, I shan?t,? pleaded Mary; ?my head
aches so with being indoors, and if I go out I
shall get rid of it.?
?Well, to be sure, there?s that note I want left
at Miss Phillips? house; you might leave that on
your way, and you can take my mackintosh, then
you can?t come to much harm.?
Mary almost repented her resolution. To walk


down the village in Aunt Hester?s mackintosh,
which was ever so much too long for her, was
rather an ordeal; hut then what did she care, ?
there was nobody here she minded seeing her.
Besides, it was too late to change her mind now.
She went slowly upstairs, put on her hat, and
then proceeded to array herself in the mackintosh.
It certainly was dreadfully long, and unless she
held it up all round her it would inevitably trail
in the mud.
? What a bother,? thought Mary ; ? I almost wish
I hadn?t asked her to let me go out, only it is so
fearfully dull indoors to-day. Well, it can?t be
helped.?
Aunt Hester called to her from the parlour as
she passed through the hall.
? Mary, you must take my goloshes; they?re in
the umbrella stand.?
? Oh, Aunt Hester,? cried Mary, piteously, feel-
ing this was the last straw on the camel?s back.
?indeed, indeed, I can?t wear them. They are
ever so much too large, and I shall be sure to
lose them.?
? Oh, well,? said Aunt Hester, hesitating, ? I
don?t want to lose them, as they?re just a new
pair, so perhaps you had better leave them at
home. That mackintosh covers you up nicely.?


Mary groaned inwardly. She had scarcely got
i/O %> o
half-way down the path when she heard the
parlour window open violently, and her aunt?s
voice screaming out, ?
? For goodness? sake, child, lift it out of the
mud, that cloak will be spoilt before you get
home.?
Mary gathered it up round her till she was
safely out of Aunt Hester?s sight, and then she
left it recklessly to take its chance; indeed, it
was as much as she could do to hold up her
umbrella against the wind and rain.
She called at the Miss Phillips? house, where
they insisted upon her coming in, and treated
her to more lamentations on the unluckiness of
its having turned out such a terrible day for
O %j
the flower show. A poignancy was added to
their sorrow in the fact that they had each got
?/ O
tickets, which were now so much waste paper.
Mary assented, and condoled with them all round,
and started ofl' again for the High Street, which
o O'
this afternoon looked almost deserted. She took
as long a time as she could over her business
at the fancy shop, and had a little chat with
the shopwoman on that universal subject, the
flower show, but still she found time had
passed very slowly when she started for home.


Finally, she decided to go back a rather Idsg^LTS^
way round, so as not to get in at anyrate till
tea-time. She sighed to think of the longr even-
incr to follow.
O
She had passed all the shops, and was trudg-
ing along a rather solitary road, the only other
person visible beside herself being a young man
in a long white mackintosh striding throuo-h
o O
the puddles.
?What a perfect guy I must be looking,?
thought Mary, and there certainly was an ex-
cuse for feeling self-conscious on this occasion.
? I do hope, whoever he is, he will keep on
holding his head down.?
Mary kept her own head well under the
shelter of the umbrella, because, as she said to
herself, ? then if he laughs I shan?t see it.?
She heard the tramp of his feet coming nearer
and nearer, and then she heard a sudden pause.
She looked up from under the umbrella, and
there before her, in that out-of-the-way road,
in the pouring rain, stood Tom Hinton.
. he cried, as he seized both her hands
in his, and the umbrella fell down on the road.
And Mary was so taken by surprise at his
sudden appearance, and so thrown off her bal-
ance by the rush of wild happiness at her heart,


that she could only say, with a half sob looking
up into his ugly, honest face, ?
? Oh, Tom, Tom, I am so glad to see you! ?
On hearing this, Tom stooped down and kissed
her then and there in the road, and Mary woke
up to the fact that she had been dreadfully un-
dignified, and that she was standing in a pelt-
ing shower without any umbrella.
? Oh, Tom, how could you ? ? she said, as Tom
picked up the umbrella with one hand and drew
her arm within his with the other.
? How could I ? ? repeated Tom, looking down
at her with such a radiance illumining his
homely features, that Mary wondered she had
ever thought him plain. ? How could I ? Why,
I could easily do it again.? Which he did.
? But, Tom, however did you get here ? ? asked
Mary, when presently they were walking quietly
along.
?By rail. I was so awfully miserable and
wretched at home, that I was driven at last
to come and see if I could get a glimpse of you
at the window, or somehow.?
? And if it had been fine, I should have been
at the flower show,? said Mary, with a sudden
qualm at the recollection.
? Seems as if we were always to be together


in the rain, Mary, doesn?t it ? Almost like an
allegory,?life, you know, going through storms
together.?
Under an umbrella,? said Mary, laughing
? Oh, Tom, I hope not, I don?t like storms, I
like sunshine.?
? But you wouldn?t mind if we were in them
together ? ? said Tom persuasively, and Mary
blushingly admitted that it might make a
difference.
All, Mary! but if it should be so, that in
the most awful tempest you will ever quail
under, you should ffnd yourself alone. No
voice near you to whisper encouragement, no
strong arm to lean upon, no brave heart to trust
in?will you then, beaten down to the ground,
at last raise your eyes to a Help not of this
earth but from above ?
? And you did really care about me a little
all the time Mary ? I don?t seem as if I could
believe it; you see I?m such an ugly, stupid sort
of fellow, not half good enough for a girl like
you. And then you didn?t seem to care when
you went away.?
Mary would have died sooner than have con-
fessed her jealousy of Miss Boldero. How stupid
she had been. It wasn?t likely Tom would fall


in love with Lottie Boldero, after havincr known
' O
her.
?Never mind, Tom, you ought to be satisfied
now.'? Then, as Tom began a rapturous exclama-
tion, she added, ?? But it was very unfair of vou
to come upon me so suddenly.?
?Was it? I?m very glad I did, or I might
have got a different reception. I didn?t even
know it was you till I was close up, you looked
so different somehow.?
? I should think so,? said Mary, with a sudden
recollection of her attire ; she had never foro-ot-
y O
ten herself for so long a time before. ? Why,
Tom, I have got on Aunt Hester?s mackintosh ! ?
? Have you ? Well, I really wasn?t quite sure
in the distance if it was a man comino- alono- or
O C 5
not, till I caught a glimpse of your sweet face
under the umbrella. Oh, my darling, you don?t
know, you can?t know, how happy you have
made me.?
It was very pleasant to walk along listening
to such speeches as these, especially sweet after
the rather humbling experiences of the last few
days. It seems curious to think that two people
could regard anyone from such different points
of view as Aunt Hester and Tom Hinton did;
hut we do meet with such curious things in life.


Tom and Mary walked' on in a blissful dream
through the muddy lanes, till they neared Aunt
Hester?s abode, then Mary stopped.
? Tom, you mustn?t come any farther. I don?t
know what Aunt Hester would say if she saw you.?
? What sort of a person is she ? I suppose she
is very fond of you ? ?
?No, Tom, it?s very odd, isn?t it; but I don?t
really think she is very fond of me, or else she
takes great pains to conceal her affection.?
? Then why do you stay with her, dear ? Look
here, can t you take me in and introduce me ?
Say Im an old friend, ?so I am, ?and that you
met me in the lane.?
?Tom, I couldn?t do it. I shouldn?t dare. No,
you must say good-bye, please, and next week I
shall be home asfain.?
O
?Next week,? said Tom dejectedly; ?you don?t
suppose I?m going to wait all that time before
I see you again ? ?
? I?m afraid you must, Tom.?
? I say Mary, dear, you know I shall go
sti aight to \ our mother and tell her all about
this (I hope she won?t mind), and then couldn?t
I get her to write to your aunt and say she
wants you back home? Come, isn?t that a
happy idea ? ?


Mary tried to look as if she did not think so 7
and not succeeding very brilliantly, said, ?
?You must do as you please, Tom; hut at any-
rate I must go now. I expect Aunt Hester is-
waiting tea for me as it is.
? Well then, my darling, good-bye. I suppose I
mustn?t take another kiss, because there?s an old
brute in a smock frock coming along. Hang
him ! why couldn?t he have kept out of the way
for a minute or two ? But Mary, he?s too far
off to hear what we say; won?t you just tell
me that you do really care for me, before we-
part ? ?
? That?s absurd, Tom,? said Mary, flushing
under the earnest gaze of his brown eyes.
? Just to please me, dearest ? ?
?Very well, then.?
Mary rushed through the words, and snatching-
her hands away from Tom?s, was gone before he=
of the smock frock had time to rub his eyes and
say to himself, ?
? Thowt as there was two folks in the road, but
can?t see but one.?
The ? one ? turned and walked slowly back tn
the station, his heart full of happiness, and his
face wearing a look of such radiant beaming good-
will to all mankind, that no less than five beggars


accosted him before he got home, and they all re-
ceived a handsome donation.
The rain had passed off by the time he came
in sight of the Gable Farm, and the sun shone
O '
out brightly on its red roofs and white gables.
?Ah ! ? said Tom exultantly, ? you will soon
have a mistress, old home ; ? then he added quietly,
taking off his hat, ? God willing.?

CHAPTER VIII.
Not a wink of sleep did I get all that night
after Ralph had told me about himself and Miss
Boldero. After two or three hours? hard think-
ing, I made up my mind to put the whole thing
out of my head and go to sleep. But there, it
wasn?t a bit of use; try as I might, I couldn?t
get the thing out of my thoughts. I turned it
over and over in my mind, and could neither
make head nor tail of it. What could Miss
Boldero mean by refusing Ralph ? Perhaps she
reckoned positively on his asking her again; and
really I felt so little confidence now in him, that
I thought it very likely she might be right.
Why?why had I not spoken more strongly, and
given him a bit of my mind on the subject ? I
tossed about in bed and got quite angry with
myself for having been such a silly. Why, I


had hardly said anything that I ought to have
said, such as ?Ralph, I hope at anyrate we shall
hear no more of this foolishness. Because you
have done a stupid thing once, that is no reason
you should do it again.? Or else, ?Ralph, I hope
you will be careful for the future. Depend
upon it that girl will try to get you to ask her
to marry you again. Don?t you be taken in a
second time.?
Oh, yes, I could think of lots of sensible
advice to give him now, but why had I not
thought of it all then ? And yet had not
several of these sort of speeches come into my
head as we walked along, and yet I had said
nothing. How was it ? Afraid of Ralph I
W hat an absurd idea. Easy - going, good - tem-
pered Ralph, what could there possibly be in
him to make anyone afraid ? I least of all.
And yet I knew in my heart that I had been
afraid of him. Well, I suppose there are times
in every man?s life, however easy-going he may
be, when one feels it as well to be careful what
one says to him, and when one seems to know
by instinct that he ought to be marked ?danger-
ous.? And then I was very sorry for him, poor
old Ralph! Vexed and angry as I felt about
the whole thing, I couldn?t forget the look of


dull despondency on his face. I could only
think of it as a misfortune that had fallen
upon him?l mean his having fallen in love,
not his having been refused; that was the
best thing that could have happened to him
if he could only have been brought to see
it. Well, perhaps he would see it some day.
Oh! that girl. What had we done that we
should have such a trial sent into our quiet
home ?
Breakfast the next morning was a most un-
comfortable sort of meal. If I felt awkward,
what must the other two, Ralph and Miss
Bolder�, have felt? Ralph got out of it pretty
well by getting up and going out on pretence
of farm business, and Miss Bolder� carried it
off with a high hand. There was a sort of
hard scornfulness about her which made me
feel unchristian-like. No, Ralph, I would do a
good deal for you, but be kind to Miss Bolder�,
impossible! For the matter of that I?m sure
no one could require kindness less than she
did, ?hard-hearted, selfish creature. Of course
she never guessed that I knew what had taken
place last night, so I could watch her without
her having any idea of my doing so. In the
morning she went through her work just as


usual. In the afternoon she went off for a
long ramble with Kitty, and did not get back
till past tea - time, which made mother very
cross with her. Of course I didn?t join in
the scolding mother gave her, because of my
promise to Ralph. If I couldn?t speak kindly
to her, I could avoid speaking angrily. As it
was, it was almost too much for Ralph, and he
got up hastily and went out; nor did he come
back till supper-time.
Miss Boldero took her scolding quietly enough.
She never fired up at mother?s cross speeches;
indeed, anyone who hadn?t seen her in one
of her furies, might have thought her a very
good-tempered girl. Kitty fired up for her instead.
?It wasn?t Cousin Lottie?s fault at all, grand-
mamma. There was a poor little boy in one of
the lanes who fell down in a fit. Oh! he did
look so dreadful, and I was so frightened, and
Cousin Lottie held a bit of wood between his
teeth to prevent his biting his tongue. Then,
when he got better we took him home.
? Well, really Lottie,? said mother, still too cross
to be quite reasonable, ?it was very kind of you,
of course, but I do wish you wouldn?t take Kitty
into the way of seeing such shocking sights ?
You don?t know what harm it might do her. I


have heard of children catching those sort of
things from seeing others have them.?
?I?m sorry Kitty was there? was all Miss
Boldero?s reply, and she sat down looking pale
and tired.
? M ell, we won?t say any more about it,? said
mother rather molified, ? only do be more careful
for the future.?
She certainly was a queer girl, that Lottie
Bolder�; such a mixture of what in anyone else
one would have called tender-heartedness, with
so much utter want of feeling. She used to go
every day to see that boy, and sit with him,
for he was ill for several weeks after this, and
he grew so fond of her, that he thought there
was no one like her?at least so his mother told
me. Somehow or another Ralph found out all
about it (I didn?t tell him, you may be sure), and of
course it ended in the boy?s being taken on to
the farm when he got better. Such nonsense it
was, for he scarcely did any work, and every now
and then gave us all a fright, by going and having
a fit in the kitchen or somewhere. It made me
f��: that I always lost my presence of
mind at these times, and used to have to call
to that slip of a girl to come in and look after
him. As I said to Ralph, it was worth while


paying him a few shillings a week to stop at
home, for the wear and tear to one?s nerves was
nothing like made up for, by the few knives and
boots he cleaned.
? I thought you always said you hadn?t got any
nerves, and didn?t know what such things were,?
was the only answer I got from Ralph. He
certainly was very trying at times.
At one time I had hoped that young Mr Hinton
might take a fancy to Miss Boldero, which would
have settled matters comfortably for everyone,
but though he came so constantly to the farm he
showed no signs of falling in love with Lottie.
O C 5
In fact, I had a sort of idea that he rather liked
Mary Fontaine, only she was so quiet about it,
hardly ever mentioning his name, that I concluded
v O
I must be mistaken. lam not very sharp at
those sort of matters, having too many other things
to think of, and the notion would never have
entered my head, but for Dick?s telling me once,
that Mr Hinton was always coming to their
O
house now. Oh, dear me, why couldn?t Ralph,
if he must fall in love, have managed to do it
1 O
with Mary Fontaine; I?m sure she was a far
prettier girl. What could he see to like or admire
in Lottie Boldero ? She didn?t ever treat him
with scarcely common civility, except sometimes


when she was excited, or interested about some-
thing, and seemed to forget to be rude ; then she
would soon draw herself up, and either go away
or say something so disagreeable, that even Ralph
would almost fly into a passion. I have seen her
try her utmost to aggravate him till she succeeded
in driving him nearly wild. It was enough for
her to know, that Ralph did not like to see her
doing certain things, for her to go at once and
do them; it was enough for her to know, that
there were certain things he did like to see her
doing, to make her at once leave off. For
instance, Ralph particularly disliked seeing her
do rough work of any kind, so she made a point
of undertaking everything of that sort she could
put her hands to. Then Ralph was very fond
of music, and when she first came Miss Bolder�
used to like to sit down to our old cottage piano
and play off little simple tunes, and sometimes
she would sing such songs as?? Ye Banks and
Braes,? ?Jock o? Hazeldean,? and many of those
old Scotch airs. She certainly had a sweet voice
with a sort of a pathetic ring in it, and she had once
made me cry over ? Robin Adair,? though I was
angry with myself for being so silly. Nothing
pleased Ralph so much as to sit and hear Lottie
Bolder� play and sing in the evening when the


day?s work was done, but now he had to do,
without this pleasure, for she never opened the
piano; and Ralph, I suppose, was too proud to
to ask her to sing to him. Of course, if mother
had had any idea of how much he missed it,
she would have had Lottie down at the
piano in a minute, she couldn?t very well
have refused mother; but it never occurred
to mother, who couldn?t bear music herself,
except hymn tunes, to think that Ralph
really cared about it. But Lottie seemed to
know by instinct what he liked and what he
disliked, and wonderfully clever she was at
plaguing him. Sometimes I really did hope
she would cure him of ever carino- for her
O
any more, and sometimes I almost thought he
was cured ; only then, just as I was congratu-
lating myself on it, I generally found him doing
or planning something for her pleasure, and
which, perhaps, if she didn?t find out he had
had a hand in it,, did please her. All this
time mother never suspected anything,?and I
don?t wonder either, ?for Ralph was not much like
a lover; very often he hardly spoke to Lottie
all day, and it was only I who noticed the
many little things he did so quietly to save
her trouble or annoyance.


It was just about this time that, one after-
noon, Mrs Fontaine came down to the farm,
looking rather disturbed, out of her usual sere-
nity, so that I wondered if anything was the
matter. We were sitting?mother, Lottie and
I (I have fallen into the way of writing about
her as Lottie, but I never spoke to her save
as Miss Boldero) ?under the trees in the or-
chard, for it was a hot afternoon, and we were
glad to get out of the house, when we saw Mrs
Fontaine coming towards us across the grass.
o o
? Pray, don?t disturb yourselves,? she called
out, as mother got up to go and meet her, ? you
look so refreshingly cool there, I shall be thank-
O
ful to sit down with vou for a little while.?
I sent off Kitty, who was lying on the grass
* ' */ o o
at our feet, into the house for a chair, and we
made Mrs Fontaine comfortable between us.
She kept on talking about the beauty of the
weather, and the lovely colour of the trees in
our orchard, but all the while I felt sure she
had got something important to tell us, if only
she would come out with it.
I asked after the boys.
? Oh, they are quite well, thank you. They
always have such excellent health, it is a great
blessing.?


I asked after Mary.
? She is very well too, I am happy to say.
You know she is away from home just now,
at her Aunt Hester?s.?
? Yes, I know she is,? I said, ? she never came
to say good-bye to us before she went.?
Didn?t she?? replied Mrs Fontaine absently.
And then I knew there was something' wrong,
O o 7
for Mrs Fontaine was always so very polite,
that, as a rule, she was certain to apologise for
Mary, whenever she did anything her mother
thought not quite considerate.
? Have you heard from her lately ? ? asked
mother.
Lottie and Kitty, who were never much in-
terested in Mary, had gone off for a game at
hide-and-seek in the garden. They were just
like a couple of children together, I often used
to think, and how any girl at Lottie?s age
eould care to go off and rush about in the
hot sun on a day like this, was more than I
could understand. But she never seemed to
mind how hot it was, I suppose it came of her
having lived in Australia.
? Yes,? said Mrs Fontaine, thoughtfully, in
answer to mother?s question; ? yes, I heard from
her about three days ago. I think she finds


it rather dull work being at her aunt?s, poor
child! ?
I never can pretend to give sympathy when I
don?t feel any. So I said bluntly,?
? What did she go for, then ? It was her own
choice, wasn?t it ? ?
? Oh, yes, it was quite her own choice. Mrs
Bertram and Jane, I have come to ask your
advice about something in connection with Mary.?
Here it was at last. A lover, of course, I
thought; it was the only thing in connection
with Mary one could think of. Mother, much
flattered by Mrs Fontaine?s wanting our advice,
promised eagerly that she should have the benefit
of both our opinions.
? And Jane can give very sensible advice some-
times,? she added.
? I know she can,? said Mrs Fontaine, with
one of her pleasant smiles, while I tried to
look modest; ?that is why I came here. I
knew, too, that you would both be interested
in anything that concerned Mary.?
?Of course we should be,? we both said, and
waited, anxious to hear more.
? I daresay,? continued Mrs Fontaine, with
the most aggravating slowness, ? that you can
almost guess what it is I have to tell you ? ?


I saw mother suddenly assume a look of
great wisdom, together with an air of perfect
conviction and satisfaction, and I trembled, for
I knew what she was going to say as well as
if I had heard the words fall from her lips.
? I suppose, Mrs Fontaine, she has fallen in
love with my Ralph ? ?
That was what mother ivould have said, if I
had not rushed to the rescue.
? No, Mrs Fontaine, we don?t know at all
what it is you have to tell us, but we should
like to know immensely. Pray, don?t keep us
in suspense any longer.?
? M ell, Mary has had a proposal,? I saw
mother?s face fall, ?? now I wonder if you can
guess who from ? ?
?Mr Weston ? ? said mother, who had always
prophesied an engagement between him and
Mary ever since he came into the parish. I?m
sure I don?t know why.
?Mr Hinton ? ? I guessed, feeling sure I was
right.
Mrs Fontaine nodded.
? Dear me,? said mother, who had hardly
got over her disappointment about Ralph, ? well,
I am surprised. And has Mary accepted him,
Mrs Fontaine ? ?


? Yes, everything seems to have been settled
O
very quickly. It happened while she was away,
but Mr Hinton came to me directly afterwards
to ask mv consent. Just what I should have
expected of him, he is such a straightforward
sort of young man. But I thought as you
knew a good deal of him, I would come and
ask your advice.?
It did strike me, I must say, that if Mrs
Fontaine had come and asked us our opinion
a little earlier in the day, it would have been
wiser; however, of course, we must just give
her the best advice we could on the matter,
and, after having received such a flourishing-
description of my powers, I felt bound to act
up to it. So, instead of saying what first came
into my head, I tried to look at the thing from
every point of view, and my heart inclining
me strongly in Mr Hinton?s favour, I felt it
O '
my duty to come down upon him and his
prospects rather severely, so as to be quite
impartial. Mother, who was still cross at the
idea of Mary?s having found it possible to fall
in love with someone else, while Ralph was in
the field, was still more severe.
After we had argued, and discussed, and con-
sulted for about half-an-hour, I began gradually


to see that we were wasting time and breath
for nothing. I began to see that Mrs Fontaine
had quite made up her mind that Mary should
have Mr Hinton, and that the asking our advice
was only a sort of pretence, just to make her
feel she had not given her consent too easily.
I could see also that she had quite reckoned
on our favouring his suit, and that she was
annoyed at our not having more to say for
1 ? w
him. I must say I felt angry when I found
this out, as I suppose most people do when
they find out how little their advice is really
wanted; and I felt very much inclined to say
out straight what had been my first thought
on hearing the news.
?He is a great deal too good for Mary.?
However, I kept this in, and when Mrs Fon-
taine said, rather plaintively,?
?So you both think with Lewis, that Mary
might have done better ? ? I only replied,
?Mell, Mrs Fontaine, I think, as far as this
world?s goods are concerned, she might; but
you might look a long way before you would
come across so honest, open-hearted, generous-
minded a young man as Mr Hinton. Ralph likes
him extremely.?
And after all, added mother, ?we mustn?t be


too particular. I daresay it will be a comfort to
you to have Mary settled.?
?/ **
I don?t think Mrs Fontaine was very pleased
at this speech, but she was so gdad to hear that
Ralph liked Mr Hinton that she forgot to be
vexed.
? And here comes Ralph! ? cried mother, ?he
will be able to tell you more about Mr Hinton
than we can.?
?Now, Ralph,? said Mrs Fontaine, after sho
had shaken hands with him, ? I want to know
what you think of young Mr Hinton.?
? That depends on which way you want me
to look at him,? replied Ralph, rather amused
at this sudden demand; ?if you mean as a
farmer, I can only say that I don t think
much of him. At anyrate not at present.?
? Oh, no, I don?t mean that at all. But is he
the sort of young man you would feel you could
allow your ?? here Mrs Fontaine got rather con-
fused, but made the best of it, ?your sister, for
instance, to marry ? ?
?No, indeed!? exclaimed Ralph with a burst
of laughter; ?he is the very last young man
I should ever think of allowing my sister
to marry. Why, Jane, the poor fellow would
hardly call his soul his own in a month?s time.?


I couldn?t help laughing too, it was such an
absurd idea, but I was rather angry with Ralph
all the same, and I suppose he saw it, for he
came, and putting his arm round my waist,
looked laughingly into mv face, saving,?
O O V J ' J o'
?Come now, Jane, don?t you think yourself
that you require someone more masterful than
Tom Hinton for your husband ? ?
Ralph could always get round me when he
liked, and now I could only laugh and say, ?
? I should hope so, and someone a trifle older
too.?
? Of course, my dear Jane,? said Mrs Fontaine,
? and a valuable wife you would make to anyone,
I?m sure. But, Ralph, you must know what I
mean; what sort of husband should you think
Tom Hinton would make ? ?
Ralph was still so possessed by the comicality
of the idea of Tom Hinton as mv husband, that
he had great difficulty in answering with proper
seriousness.
? Really, Mrs Fontaine, you ask very difficult
questions, but from what I know of Tom Hinton,
I should think he would make an excellent one
allowing for his being rather youthful. Who is
the young lady who is thinking of taking him
? for better, for worse ? ? ?


I thought Ralph dreadfully stupid not to have
guessed who it was before now, and I think
Mrs Fontaine was vexed with him for not speak-
ing more seriously. At anyrate she took the
best way to punish him whether she was aware
of it or not.
? Didn?t you know he was very much in
love with Miss Boldero ? and don?t you think
it would be a very good match ? ? she asked
with a suddeness which left Ralph no time te
think.
I felt Ralph?s arm, which was still round
my waist, tremble violently, and I heard him
say something under his breath which it
was well Mrs Fontaine did not hear; then I
cried out, ?
? What nonsense, Mrs Fontaine, to try and
deceive him; of course he knows well enough it
is Mary who is engaged to Mr Hinton.?
Ralph managed to stammer out some congratu-
lations, which Mrs Fontaine accepted graciously r
with a little smile curling the corners of her
mouth.
?Well, now, Ralph, perhaps you will give me
your real opinion ? You see it is a matter of
importance to me.?
? I think him one of the nicest, truest-hearted


fellows I ever met with,? said Ralph, really in
earnest at last, ?simple-minded, if you like, but
with plenty of good common-sense about him,
all the same. Mary is sure to be happy with
him; no girl could fail to be, I should think.?
? Well, that?s very encouraging,? said Mrs
Fontaine, getting up to go. ? Thank you very
much, Ralph; and thank you Mrs Bertram,
and Jane, for your advice. I expect Mary will
be home again soon. Tom persuaded me to write
and ask to have her back again. I suppose I
shall get into sad trouble with Hester for doing
it, but we can?t please everyone in this world,
and, of course, I want to see the dear child after
this.?
Mi's Fontaine went off quite satisfied, and I
said to myself, ? I wonder if Mary really cares
for him. Everybody keeps asking if Tom Hinton
is good enough for Mary, but I should like to ask
if Mary is good enough for Tom ? ?


CHAPTER IX.
0 how this spring of love resembleth
The uncertain glory of an April day ;
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun.
And by-and-by a cloud takes all away !
Two Gentlemen of Verona.
It did not take Mary Fontaine very long to
come to the conclusion, that she had been a
great deal too precipitate in accepting Tom
Hinton, and becoming engaged to him. I do
? o o o
not mean to say that she discovered that she
did not care for him, but she began to feel
very strongly that she had allowed him far
too easy a victory, and it was very annoying
that this should have been the very first pro-
posal she had ever received. There was no
doubt about it, she ought to have refused Tom,
but then, suppose he had never asked her
again.
She also felt that she had descended several


decrees still lower in her Aunt Hester?s estima-
tion, and though not generally disposed to at-
tach much importance to her aunt?s sentiments
on this occasion as they agreed with her own,
she did allow them to weigh considerably with
her. When Aunt Hester told how, in the
course of her eventful career, she had had no
less than six gentlemen each, at different times,
hopelessly in love with her, and how she firmly
and decidedly refused to give anyone of them
the least encouragement, Mary felt that she was
indeed a degenerate specimen of womankind.
Then the congratulations at the farm were
not all she could have desired. Jane Bertram
seemed to be chiefly impressed by a sense of
Mary?s extreme good fortune in having secured
such a lover as Tom Hinton, and she was quite
impervious to such little remarks as ?
? You see, Jane, poor Tom was so dreadfully in
love with me, and so miserable when I went
away, that that was how it all came about.?
Or else it was?
? I often wish I was harder-hearted, but I
am so silly, that I can?t help feeling sorry for
people when they seem so unhappy.?
Now Mrs Bertram?s congratulations were of
quite a different character from her daughter?s.


? Well, Mary, my dear, so you are engaged
to be married to Mr Hinton ? I?m sure I'm
very glad, for though of course Mr Hinton is
not very handsome, or very rich, still he is a
very excellent, steady young man, no doubt.
As I said to your mamma the other day, it
doesn?t do to he too particular. I?m very glad,
my dear, to see that you have so much good
sense; some girls are veiy different. I knew
a young lady who refused a young gentleman,
because she didn?t think him good enough for
her, and that young lady never had another
offer all her life. So you see it doesn?t do for
young people to be too particular, as I was saying.?
It would be difficult to say which of these
two views of her engagement annoyed Mary
O O %/
the most. Jane?s idea that Tom Hinton was
a treasure which Mary was fortunate to have
secured, or Mrs Bertram?s conviction that Tom
Hinton was nothing particular, but the best
that Mary could hope for.
Ralph?s congratulations were more satisfactory,
and Mary persuaded herself that there was a
tinge of hopeless melancholy about him which
spoke of blighted hopes and an aching heart.
Lewis and Dick each tendered their own
opinions in their own style, Lewis remarking,?


That, of course, he wasn?t surprised, he al-
ways knew Mary would have Tom Hinton;
girls were always wanting to get engaged. As
far as he knew there was no objection, but he
thought she might have done better if she hadn?t
o o
been in such a hurry.
Dick was delighted and facetious, taking so much
benevolent interest in the young couple of lovers,
that they would gladly have dispensed with his
society for a time. However, this excessive in-
terest soon subsided. Dick came to the philoso-
phical conclusion that lovers were a stupid lot,
and awfully selfish. Why, Tom didn?t give him
half so many things as he used to do, and
never cared to come out fishing with him unless
Mary came too.
Mrs Fontaine made no difficulties or objec-
tions of any sort, to give a spice of excitement
and romance to the affair, and the whole thing
settled down into a common-place every-day
engagement. Then did the shade of Sir Guy
de Vavasour arise and reproach his faithless
lady love. What untiring devotion, what cease-
less admiration, had he never failed to yield, and
with what a magnificent scorn, and careless in-
difference, had they often been received by the
object of his affections. Yes, it was indeed


humiliating to reflect how haughty and dignified
she had been in theory, and how lamentably
lacking in these two qualities in practice.
? Why,? said Mary to herself, blushing at
the thought, ? Tom never even proposed pro-
perly at all. Whatever would Aunt Hester
say if she knew that. All her six lovers,
she told me, went down on their knees when
they proposed to her, and quite right too. I?m
sure it?s the proper attitude for a man to
approach a woman. But still, of course, as
things were, Tom couldn?t very well have
gone down on his knees. All the same, its
dreadful to think he didn?t make a regular
declaration. If I had only known how things
really were, I should have refused him; at least,
dear me, it?s no use thinking about it now.?
The result of these reflections was, that the
next afternoon, as Mary and her mother sat
at work in the garden, the latter was somewhat
startled by an abrupt question from her daughter.
? Mamma, what did papa say when he proposed
to you ? ?
Mrs Fontaine had some difficulty in collect-
ing together her scattered ideas, but at last
she said, ?
? Well, really Mary, I can hardly tell you.


for I was so confused and frightened at the
time, that I had scarcely any idea of what was
said to me. You see I had never expected
anything of the kind. Your dear father was
such a clever, intellectual man, and I was a
very shy, foolish sort of girl, so it seemed so
extremely unlikely. Then your Aunt Hester
was very much opposed to it. There was a
youno - lady, an old schoolfellow of hers, whom
jO J *
she wanted her brother to marry, and you
know your aunt has great firmness of char-
acter (I have even heard people say it almost
amounted to obstinacy), and when she set her
mind on a thing she generally got it done.
However, your dear father was also very firm,
and somehow or other he never seemed to care
for Miss Benson, (that was the name of the
young lady), though she was a remarkably
sensible, well-informed girl, and so one day
he asked me to marry him.?
? And what did you say, mamma ? ? asked
Mary, much interested.
? Well, my dear, I didn?t say anything, I cried.?
This seemed to Mary such an extraordinarily
undignified way of receiving a proposal, that
she took heart once more at her own conduct.
? I daresay it was very silly,? continued Mrs


Fontaine, ? and I am sure it annoyed your dear
father a great deal, though he was very kind.?
? Then did you refuse him at first, mamma ? ?
? Oh, dear no. How could I ? I should never
have dared to say ?no? to your dear father.?
? Then you accepted him at once ? ?
?Oh, dear no. I was too afraid of what
your Aunt Hester would say to dare to say
1 yes. I have no doubt it was very trying for
your dear father, as he was such a very decided
sort of person himself, but I really couldn?t help
it. It always seems to me so difficult to know
what to do for the best, and I had always
had someone or other to decide things for me
before this came. Of course, after my marri-
age, my dear husband settled everything for me.?
? But, mamma, if you didn?t say either ? yes ?
or ? no,? how did you ever come to be married ? ?
? ell, Mary, as I said before, your dear
father was very firm. When he saw that
I really could not give him a decided answer,
he took out his watch and said he would
give me five minutes to make up my mind.
If by the end of that five minutes I had not
said ? no, he should consider me as eno-aced
o O
to him. Well, Mary, I don?t think I ever
passed such a dreadful five minutes in my


life. I think I should have had a fit of hysterics
before the end of it, if I hadn?t known how
much your father disliked that sort of thing.
I tried to arrange my ideas, to see both sides
of the question, and think which of the two
things I ought to do, but, dear me, the sight
of your father sitting opposite with the watch
in his hand, sent all my ideas flying, and my
head got into such a dreadful whirl that I was
quite thankful just to sit still and let things
drift. At the end of the five minutes your
father came over and kissed me, and said I
should never regret it, and I never did. But lam
afraid he had a sad scene with your Aunt Hester
.about it, though she never said a word to me.?
Mary sat silent for some time after this cogi-
tating. At last she said, ?
? Mamma, supposing papa had said that you were
to say ? yes ? before the five minutes were over,
if you wanted to marry him, instead of saying
nothing, I wonder what would have happened ? ?
? Dear me, Mary, what is the use of thinking
of such things now ? I daresay, if it had been
as you say, I should never have been married
at all. It certainly was providential that your
dear father put things in the way he did.?
This ended the conversation for the time, and


Mary went on thoughtfully with her work, till a
ring at the front door bell announced visitors.
It proved to he only Miss Boldero with some
message from Jane Bertram, and Mrs Fontaine
insisted on her staying and keeping them com-
pany for a little while.
? For we so seldom see you, my dear. I sup-
pose you are generally busy ? ?
? Yes, there is always plenty to do,? replied
Lottie, seating herself on the grass; ? but I like
to come and see you, Mrs Fontaine, you are al-
ways so kind.?
�/
The <drl uttered the last words with a sort of
plaintive weariness that made Mrs Fontaine glance
at her in slight surprise, for however despondent
Lottie might really feel, she generally contrived
to show a bold front to the outside world.
? Anything the matter, Lottie ? ?
? Oh, no, nothing in particular; only one gets
sometimes to think life rather a dreary business
altogether. Always the same thing over and over
again.?
? And yet you have seen more of the world
than many girls, and coming over to England
must have been a great change in every way.
When I was a girl I could no more have left
my home and gone a long journey like that


than I could have flown to the moon. I should
never have had the courage.?
? I don?t think it was so much courage as the
not knowing what else to do,? said Lottie thought-
fully, pulling up blades of grass and plaiting them
together. ?You see, Mrs Fontaine, there were such
a lot of us at home, and though we got on very
well together and were very happy, still, of course,
we were very poor very poor indeed. Not
that I minded that an atom,? she added, with
spirit.
Mary had walked off and Mrs Fontaine and
Lottie were alone together.
? But I suppose the others did mind, Lottie ? ?
? Well, yes. And then you see people don?t
always think the same about things; what seems
easy enough to them may be very hard to you.?
Mrs Fontaine looked considerably confused.
?Ah, yes,? she said, vaguely; ?it is so very often,
no doubt.?
? And they thought it very wrong of me and
very selfish, and so perhaps it was. But oh! Mrs
Fontaine, I could not do it, not even for them;
and so, when Kitty had to come over I said I
would go too. It would be one less at home,
and I thought?l hoped to get something to do
over here. But things are so different. Girls


only seem to go out as governesses here, and I
am not well enough educated for that.?
? I don?t think I quite understand, my dear.
What was it your family wanted you to do ? ?
?To marry Rob Macpherson. Oh! Mrs Fon-
taine, I did dislike him so. He was a great sandy-
haired Irishman, about fifty years old. And he
knew I couldn?t bear him, and yet he tried to make
me marry him all the same. He was very well off,
because he had made a great deal of money at a
store somewhere in Melbourne, and father said I
ought to think of the young ones, and how Rob
Macpherson would help them on in the world.
And Jack, my eldest brother, who works like a
slave for us all, said it was shame that I should
not do my part to make things more easy for them.?
? And your mother, Lottie, what did she say ? ?
? Ah, that was the hardest part of all; ? and
Lottie?s slight figure quivered as she spoke.
? Mother said she would not urge me one way
or the other ?as if the sight of her tired pale
face did not drive me to it harder than all the
rest of them put together. There was only one
chance for me, to away from it all, and so I
came here. I thought, you know, when I came
that they would be glad to have me for a time, and
that I could make up to them for the expense


by doing work about the place. I am not at all
afraid of work, I would do anything,?anything
to help them at home, except that one thing they
wanted me to do, and now ?I must do that.?
There was such despair and desperation in
Lottie?s voice that Mrs Fontaine?s kind heart was
quite melted.
? But, my dear, why ? Surely the Bertrams
being in a sort of way relations, and as I have
always believed very kind people ?would not send
you back against your will. Have you explained
to them how matters stand ? ?
? No, Mrs Fontaine; I have not explained any-
thing to them,? and Lottie sprang up to her
feet in a quick blaze of wrath. ?I had scarcely
been twenty-four hours in the house when I
was shown very plainly that I was not wanted,
and that the sooner I went the better everyone
would be pleased. Why, at home we should
blush to say such a thing to the veriest loafer
who, without thinking it necessary to say for
how long, asked for board and lodging. No, I
shall not stay at the farm one hour longer than
I can help. I have written home in such a way
that they will manage to scrape enough money
together for my passage back if they have to
borrow it, but they will expect me to help them


now in the only way I can, and I dare not dis
appoint them.?
? But, my dear, lam surprised. I can hardly
believe it possible that the Bertrams should be so
unkind. To be sure they don't see the matter
in the same light as I do, not knowing all the
particulars.?
?And, Mrs Fontaine, you must never tell them,
promise me that. Stay there ! ?kept on out of pity.
No, I have not quite come down to that yet.?
?After all,? added Mrs Fontaine, trying to take
a more cheerful view of things, ? perhaps, hard as
it seems now, your going back may be the best
thing for you. I have often heard of people, who
really disliked each other at first sight, becoming
quite fond of one another. Now, with you the
dislike is only on one side, and perhaps you will
find it easier to like Mr Macpherson now you
have been away from him for some time.?
? Easier! ? exclaimed Lottie hastily ; ? it was hard
enough before, but it will be ten times harder now ; ?
then blushing scarlet, she added, ? I mean it is quite
impossible that I should ever like him, he is such a
rough, vulgar sort of man, always boasting of how
he has got on in the world. Well, it can?t be
helped, and I suppose there are some people born
to be miserable.?


?If there are such people, my dear, you may
depend upon it they make most of their misery
for themselves.?
Mrs Fontaine like many other persons could he
philosophic over her neighbour?s trouble.
?Well, Mrs Fontaine, I don?t see at all how I
could help our all being poor, or how I could help
Rob Macpherson falling in love with me.?
? Well, no, perhaps not. I suppose now you
never had any other proposal more to you taste,
or more suitable in every way.?
This was turning the tables on Lottie just as
she was on the point of gaining an advantage in
the argument, and it had the effect of sending all
her forces to flight. She looked down as she said
hurriedly,?
?You may put that out of the question. I have
never had any proposal that was suitable in any
way. No, there is nothing else to be done but
to go home. At anyrate, it will a blessing to see
all the dear home faces again. And here comes
Mr Hinton with Miss Fontaine, so I am sure I
shall be in the way. Good-bye, and thank you
ever so much for listening to some of my troubles.?
Mrs Fontaine watched Lottie?s figure out at
the gate with a pensive expression, murmuring
to herself,?


? So tiresome of Ralph, why couldn?t he have fallen
in love with her, and settled matters comfortably ? ,r
It was not very long since that Jane Ber-
O
tram had expressed precisely the same opinion.
with regard to Tom Hinton.
Mary watched Lottie Boldero depart with a
feeling of considerable disappointment, for she
was just prepared to administer a course of icy
treatment to the unfortunate Tom, and what
was the use of being either scornful or indiffer-
ent when there was no one to be impressed by
these little performances. Mrs Fontaine often
watched the lovers with a species of mild
amazement, it was such a different kind of
engagement altogether to what her own had
been. And she often said to herself, ?
? Why, dear me, poor Francis (this being the
name of the late Mr Fontaine) would no more
have put up with the sort of speeches Mary
makes to Tom Hinton, than I could ever have
brought myself to utter them. But I suppose
different people have different ways,? and with this
very evident truism she abandoned the subject.
Certainly Tom Hinton did have to put up
with a good deal sometimes, and I cannot but
confess that in the process he often lost his


temper considerably. At first, when Mary was
seized with one of these spasms of dignity, he
was anxious and unhappy. In the simplicity
of his heart he annoyed Mary by continually
asking- her if she was unwell, and invariably as
o *
these attacks recurred he was more or less
puzzled, but rarely irritated thereby. Still,
good-tempered as Tom Hinton was, he had his
vulnerable points, and his being gifted with so
little reticence made it easy for other people to
discover them. If it had been interesting to
Mary to disturb the even current of Sir Guy de
Vavasour?s courtship by a judicious arrangement
of rocks and quicksands, how much more so
was it to carry on the same performance with
Tom Hinton ? And so Tom?s existence since his
engagement, instead of flowing like a tranquil
stream, as he had fondly hoped, took the form
of a turbulent water-course, intersected by peril-
ous crag's and sudden cataracts. Through all
o O
this he still held to his opinion, that he was
the happiest of mortals, though to anyone else
his happiness might have appeared of rather a
questionable character. But Tom was modest?
modest to a degree rarely met with, and this lack
of faith in himself, together with his inordinate
belief in everything connected with the object of


his devotion, saved him from many mortifications
which a more conceited man would have writhed
under. For he still believed in Mary to an ex-
tent that drove Jane Bertram, to whom he was
wont to expatiate on this theme, nearly wild.
How anyone who saw as much of Mary as he
did could go on thinking her the angelic piece of
perfection that Tom unhesitatingly affirmed her
to be, was more than Jane could by any stretch
of imagination conceive; and what annoyed her
more was to see that this very belief of Tom?s
had been the one thing required to confirm
Mary?s already exalted opinion of herself to such
a degree, as to make her rather a trial to her
friends just at this time. For those few first
twinges of conscience had soon subsided, and
Mary believed in herself as much as and, well,
if possible, more than Tom did.
Love of admiration only increases in proportion
with the supply; it is insatiable, never ending.
If Tom Hinton had thought his lady-love would
rest satisfied with his adoration alone, he was
immensely mistaken. It took some time for
this idea to dawn fully upon him, but when it
did, there was what May called ? a scene.?
alking up and down the room with his
hands in his pockets, Tom upbraided her bitterly.


He had some cause for wrath, for Mary, at a
pic-nic the day before, had sj'stematically neglected
him, and had as systematically bestowed her smiles
upon a youth who had intensely enjoyed ? cutting
out old Tom,? as he phrased it.
Mrs Fontaine had ventured a mild remonstrance
at the time.
? Mary, you really must not keep on flirting
with that young Mr Jackson. Tom is looking- so
?/ o o
very annoyed, and I shouldn?t wonder if presently
he is quite angry. He might do Mr Jackson some
harm.?
This injudicious speech only had the effect of
making Mary smile more sweetly on Mr Jackson,
and look more coldly on Tom. She fondly
imagined that everyone was watching these
o o
manoeuvres with the greatest interest, and that
she was effectually establishing her character as
an irresistible beauty; but unfortunately each
member of the party had his or her own interests
and occupations to amuse them, and beyond the
two or three people most concerned, no one
took any particular notice of Mary or her
lovers.
But the next day Tom came over determined
to ?have it out? with Marv. There was
suppressed indignation in his rat-tat-tat at the


door, and subdued wrath in the way he flung
down his hat on the hall table. He begun
rather violently, but cooled down at the sight
of Mary?s calm demeanour.
? I?m very sorry you are vexed Tom, but really
I can?t help people admiring me.?
? No, of course not,? admitted Tom, this appear-
ing to him but reasonable.
? Or falling in love with me,? continued Mary.
?He fall in love! ? cried Tom scornfully,
referring to the absent Mr Jackson; ?he is
the greatest flirt going, he was only amusing
himself.?
Truly Tom had pointed his chance arrow with
keen effect. Mary was roused to real anger, and
�/ o '
they were in the middle of a most decided
quarrel when Mrs Fontaine walked into the room.
That lady would most gladly have walked out
again as soon as she found herself between these
two angry lovers, but she was not allowed thus
to escape. Tom immediately appealed to her.
? Mrs Fontaine, I don?t want, goodness knows,
to be unreasonable or jealous, but do you think
Mary treated me fairly yesterday ? Would any
one ever have guessed that we were engaged at
all from Mary?s behaviour ? ?
? As if I wanted to make myself ridiculous by


never speaking to anyone else all day but you,?
broke in Mary, indignantly.
? You were so very careful about not making
yourself ridiculous, that you didn?t care how
ridiculous I looked, I suppose. I was the laughing-
stock of the whole party, and though I don?t
care for that, still??
?My dear Tom,? said Mrs Fontaine, much
alarmed at so much violence of feeling on both
sides, ? I think Mary was wrong. Yes, Mary, I
daresay you feel it hard for me not to take
?/ �/
your part, but I do think you acted very wrongly.
Still, Tom, you ought to forgive her, for I am
sure she is very sorry now, and you will frighten
her so if you are so violent.?
Certainly no one could have looked less sorry
for her sins, or less frightened at their conse-
quences, than did Mary, sitting flushed and
wrathful on the sofa.
? She isn?t a bit sorry,? said Tom, not at all
mollified! ? she would do the same to-morrow
again.?
? Of course I would ! ? replied Mary defiantly.
? Really, really, my dear Mary,? said Mrs
Fontaine, becoming more and more alarmed,
? this is very wrong of you, and very wrong
of you too, Tom. I am quite disappointed in


you both. You can?t possibly either of you
care for each other to behave in this way.
If you didn?t care for Tom, Mary, why ever did
you become engaged to him ? ?
Mary was silent at this appeal, and sat twisting
her watch chain into complicated knots.
? And, Tom, if you didn?t really care for Mary,
why did you ever engage yourself to her ? ?
? I not care for Mary ? ? began Tom, but
O
stopping abruptly he added, ? there?s no occasion to
talk about that, she knows if I care for her or not.?
Mrs Fontaine stood in the middle of the room,
looking from one to the other in helpless con-
sternation. At last she said, ?
? Well, Tom, I think you had better go away
now, and perhaps in a day or two you will both
see things differently.
Tom looked irresolute, not finding the sug-
gestion particularly tempting; then he went up
to where Mary sat, and looking down at her
said gently,?
O �/ 3
?You know, Mary, it isn?t that I want you
to say that you are sorry, or anything of that
sort, but when you act as you did yesterday,
it seems as if you didn?t care for a fellow, and,
of course, if that is so?whv, there?s nothing
more to be said.?


There was a dead silence in the room; you
could only hear the ticking of Mary?s watch as
Tom waited for her to speak. The silence lasted
so long that at last Mrs Fontaine sat down on
the sofa by the side of her daughter, and, putting
her arm round her waist, whispered into her
ear, ?
? Mary, Mary, how can you be so obstinate ?
Do say something to poor Tom.? And Mary
suddenly burst into tears.
? You are all very hard on me,? she said
between her sobs, ? and it is very unkind of
you, mamma, not to take my part, and I wish
you would send Tom away, and?and?? the
rest of the speech was lost on Mrs Fontaine?s
shoulder.
Poor Tom stood, feeling intensely guilty, and
half-inclined to take the last words as a final
dismissal, if Mrs Fontaine had not cast en-
couraging glances at him over the top of Mary?s
head. Instead, therefore, of going away, he said,
taking one of Mary?s reluctant hands in his, ?
" Don t cry dear. I will go away if
you want me to; but oh, Mary, do give me one
word before I go, just to say you don?t really
not care.?
This extremely incoherent speech had the effect


of sending Mrs Fontaine quietly out of the room,
and of transferring Marv?s head, in a mysterious
o ?/ 7 %/
manner to someone else?s shoulder.
About half-an-hour afterwards two figures
might have been descried walking up and down
the most secluded path the garden afforded, and
from the attitude of those two figures, Mrs Fon-
taine, peeping at them over her bedroom blind,
drew much consolation.
? Mary is really very fond of Tom,? she observed
to herself.
Yes, Mary was really very fond of Tom;
there was only one thing she loved more?
ZD
admiration.

CHAPTER X.
JAXE BERTRAM?S STORY.
?It never rains but it pours,? they say, and I?m
sure it was true enough with us just now. Be-
cause Ralph was a good deal worried at this time
about different matters on the farm, and I wanted
to keep things smooth and comfortable for him
at home, Phoebe must needs have an aunt taken
ill and insist on going off to nurse her ; all an
excuse to get a little holiday, as I told her at the
time, but I had to let her go, and a nice time we
had of it for the next few weeks. Of course I
had a girl in from the village who did about as
o o
much work in three days as Phoebe did in one,
and if it hadn?t been for Lottie Boldero, I don?t
know how I could have got on at all. Certainly
she was a capital girl to work?quick and active,
and making no fuss about turning her hand to
anything that came in her way. But, thankful


as I was for her help just now, not a day passed
but I wished her out of the house and hack in
Australia again. Ralph would soon have for-
gotten all about her if he hadn?t seen her so often;
though, to my thinking, that ought to have
been his best cure, seeing how she treated him.
Then, as if poor Ralph hadn?t enough to attend
to on his own hands, every two or three days
over came Mr Hinton full of questions about
how this was to be done, and how that had
better be managed, and what would Bertram ad-
vise him to do ? Ralph was a great deal too
good-natured, as I often told him, to allow him-
self to be bothered in this way ; but there was
something about Mr Hinton which made Ralph
like him so much, that I believe he would have
taken the entire management of the Gable Farm
on his hands if he had been asked. And, angry
as I often felt with Mr Hinton for all the trouble
he gave Ralph, somehow I had no sooner caught
sight of his good-tempered cheerful face, or heard
his first words generally shouted out at some
distance off" as soon as he caught sight of Ralph,
?Hullo! Bertram, I?m in a regular fix this time,
and you?ll help me out like a good fellow, I know,?
than I was as anxious he should be helped out
of his difficulties as Ralph could be. For he was


such a kind-hearted young fellow himself, that
one always felt there was nothing he would not
do for us if he could. And then he was such a
boy, his farm was like a new toy to him, and he
was always expecting to do such grand things
with it, that one could not bear to see him dis-
appointed. Since his engagement to Mar\ I on-
taiue, he had gone in for working steadily, and,
with Ralph to help him, it really seemed as if
he would turn out a good farmer some day. I
couldn?t help thinking sometimes what a helpless
sort of mistress the Gable Farm would have \ hut
then, of course, it would not he necessary for
Mary to do more than look after things, and it
was to he hoped she would manage that somehow
or other.
Well, as I was saying, we seemed to have all
our worries come together. Ralph was working
with several hands short on the farm, and I was
working indoors with as good as no hands at all,
except my own and Lottie?s. Then mother was
not quite well, which always made me anxious;
and Kitty, dear as she was to us all, was some-
times very naughty, and gave extra trouble. It
was one very hot morning in August that, as
Ralph went off to his work, he said, turning
round at the door and speaking to me, ?


??Jane, if you go out for a walk to-day, don?t
go anywhere up the Durnford road. There have
been some races over at Durnford, and there will
he a queer lot of tramps and gipsies coming back ;
there always is.?
I was on the point of saying, ? Why, of course,
Ralph, I know that as well as you do. I shouldn?t
think of going up that lonely road to-day,? when
it suddenly struck me that his remark was pro-
bably really made for Miss Boldero?s benefit, who
was sitting very quietly at the table, apparently
paying no attention to what we were saying.
Kno? her as well as I did, I thought Ralph
had better have kept his warnings to himself, and
I made up my mind to keep my eye on the youncr
1/1/ �/ 0
lady all the morning. It was not a very difficult
matter, for we were both hard at work together
all the morning, and there was no thought of o - oino*
O & &
out for a walk for either of us. By dinner time I
had clean forgotten about Durnford races or gipsies
altogether.
As a rule, I make a point of getting all my
rough work done of a morning, so that I can sit
down after dinner to my needle-work, but to-day
I was so behindhand with everything, that I had
to go off to the dairy directly dinner was over
and set to work. Lottie offered to come and


help me, but I told her I didn?t want her, and
went off without thinking any more about her.
Our dairy was about as cool a place as one
could find anywhere for a hot afternoon; but
churning is not cool work at anytime, and on an
August day it is rather a trying business. I
O CD
was feeling dreadfully warm and untidy when
I became aware of an odd sort of hopping step
coming up the little flagged pathway leading to
the dairy. I knew who it was in a minute, ?
that horrid old Basset. Goodness knows, no one
can have less yanity than I, but no one likes to
be caught of an afternoon in one?s cotton dress,
with one?s hair all untidy, and one?s cheeks the
colour of beetroot. I drew aside from the win-
dow so that he should not see me, but I might
just as well have saved myself the trouble. I
heard the footsteps pause, then Mr Basset?s head
came in at the window and peered round in
search of me. Of course I felt rather foolish
standing there doing nothing, but I was deter-
O O o 7
mined not to show it, so I said briskly, going
back to my churn, ?
? Lovely afternoon, Mr Basset.?
? Lovely, but rather warm, eh ? ? suggested Mr
Basset, standing and looking at me through the
window with his head a little on one side.


?Ah,? I said, trying hard to feel quite indifferent
to my personal appearance, ? I?ve no time to think
about whether it?s hot or cold.?
? Time to feel it, though ? ? replied Mi* Basset,
settling himself comfortably with his arms resting
on the window-sill.
I was so angry with the man I could have
thrown the churn at his head; as it was, I went
on with mv work without looking at him.
?Pretty work,? said Mr Basset at last, after
watching me till I wondered he didn?t get tired
and go away.
? I?m so fond of a dairy, always so cool in a
dairy. I was just going into the house when I
caught sight of your blue apron through the
window. ? Ah, ha ! ? I said to myself, ? there?s Miss
Jane at work as usual, I?ll just go and have a bit
of chat with her.? ?
? ery kind of you, Mr Basset, I?m sure, but??
? Don?t mention it, my dear young lady, don?t
mention it. Bad news this about Mr Hinton.?
? W hat news ? ? I cried, stopping in my work,
and looking, I am sure as I felt, very much
alarmed.
Mr Basset only stood and rolled his unpleasantly'
prominent ey?es at me.
?Very sudden, too,? he said at last.


? I don?t know what you mean,? I replied, still
more alarmed.
? Always expected it, though, myself,? continued
Mr Basset.
? I don?t know a bit what you are talking about,
Mr Basset,? I said, thoroughly out of patience.
? What has happened to Mr Hinton ? ?
? Become engaged to Miss Fontaine. Bad look-
O O
out for him. No money, no cleverness at house-
keeping, like you, Miss Jane ; no anything.?
It was no use being out of temper with Mr
Basset, because it only made him ten times more
aggravating, and nothing pleased him better than
to see he had made you angry. So I held my
tongue and he went on.
? Told him I thought he had been very foolish
the other day when I met him. Never saw a
fellow in such a tantrum; a?most knocked me
down. Think he must have been drinking to be
so violent. Thought it my duty to tell Mrs Fon-
taine the next time I saw her, that I thought he
took too much sometimes. Very bad-tempered
woman Mrs Fontaine.?
? The first time I ever heard anyone say that,
Mr Basset,? I said, hoping she had given him a
good setting-down, which she could do very well
if she liked, mild as she generally was.


? True, all the same, my dear. To be hoped
Miss Mary don?t take after her mamma; hut she?s
�/
a funny one, ain?t she ? ?
? I don?t know what you mean,? I said, again
feeling more and more angry with him.
? Likes two or three strings to her bow, eh ? ?
? Well, really, Mr Basset, I don?t exactly see how
it can be any business of yours if she does.?
?To be sure,? replied Mr Basset, smiling at me
most sweetly through the window: ? but then I
O
can?t help taking an interest in young people, you
know. Always have been so fond of young people
all my life.?
? And they have always been very fond of you,
no doubt,? I said spitefully; but it was all thrown
away on Mr Basset.
? Ah, you?re right there, my dear. Many is the
young person, male and female, who has told me,
with tears in their eyes, that I have been the
making of them with my good advice. But I?m
afraid Mr Hinton is a sad young man?a sad young-
man.?
? Oh, dear no,? I said, ?he has a very cheerful
disposition, no one more so.?
Mr Basset glared at me through the window,
and I was so glad to have annoyed him that I
added quite amiably?


?And I think his engagement is a very good
thing, it makes him work harder.?
O 7
? All, yes. Good thing for Mr Ralph if he got
engaged too.?
o o
? That?s different,? I replied shortly. ? Ralph has
got a mother and sister.?
?Yes, he?s a lucky young man, he is. Still,
youno- men do sometimes marry though they have
4/0 4/0 ?/
got a mother and sisters.?
? I never said they didn?t,? I said snappish!}", for
I was thoroughly out of temper by this time.
?No more you did, ?no more you did,? replied
Mr Basset, who always got more and more good-
tempered as other people got more and more the
reverse ; ? and I?m sure, with a sister like he?s got,
he oughtn?t to want a wife.?
? Ralph will marry when he wants to, like the
rest of the world,? I said, ?but until the time
comes I don?t see the use of talking about it.?
O
? All, put off the evil day. How?s the Australian
young lady ? Met her going out for a walk as I
came in, but she didn?t seem to remember me.?
? You met her going out ? ? I cried, suddenly
remembering Ralph?s warnings.?
? Yes, why not ? ?
? Oh, nothing, onlv I didn?t know she was going
out.?


? The sort of young lady who takes her own way
pretty well, I expect ? ? remarked Mr Basset, taking
his arm from the window-sill, and showing at last
signs of moving off. I said nothing in reply to
this last remark, and after waiting a little while,
he said, ?
?Well, Miss Jane, I suppose I must be toddling.
My respects to your mother. Good-bye?good-bye.?
He trotted slowly off down the path, and pre-
sently I saw him encounter Ralph, who was strid-
ing along in a great hurry. I stood there and
laughed, for I knew Ralph was in for at least
a ten minutes? gossip. Presently Ralph?s face
appeared at the window.
? I say, Jane, I gave old Basset such a fright. I
told him I was just going to let out Rover for a
run. Didn?t he hop off in double quick time. He?s
frightened out of his life of all kinds of doo-s ?
always thinks they?re going mad, I believe.?
? Look here, Ralph,? I said, thinking it best to
get over it at once ; ? Miss Boldero has gone out for
a walk, and seeing how obstinate she is, I shouldn?t
wonder if she has gone in just the direction you
wished neither of us to gfo.?
O
Ralph looked extremely annoyed.
? I think you might have prevented this, Jane.
Why did you let her go ? ?


? Really, Ralph, I have something else to do be-
sides dancing attendance on Miss Bolder� all day.
Besides, it is ten chances to one if she would have
listened to me if I had spoken.?
? I can?t think how it is, Jane, you always seem
to manage to raise such a spirit of opposition when
you say things.?
? I don?t think that you are much more fortunate
for the matter of that, Ralph.?
? That?s different,? he said impatiently, and he
walked off. Soon after I heard the trampling of
horses? feet in the yard, and running out I saw
Ralph just mounting the old mare.
? Wherever are you off too, Ralph ? ? I exclaimed.
? I was in hopes you had come home to rest a bit.
You look so hot and tired.?
? I can return the compliment, Jane. Goodbye,
I shan?t be gone long,? and waving his hand, he
shook the reins, and old Maggie cantered off at her
usual deliberate pace.
? Now, has he gone to look after Miss Boldero,
or has he not ? ? I thought, as I turned to go into
the house. ?I feel almost positive that that is
where he has gone. Dear me, what a world it is
and how stupid people are.?
We waited tea for about half-an-hour that after-
noon, mother getting more and more fidgety, till


at last in walked Miss Boldero, full of excuses.
She ran upstairs, took off her hat, and was down
again in a minute.
O
? And now I wonder where Ralph can have got
to,? said mother; ? it?s very unlike him to he late
at his meals.?
? I suppose you didn?t see anything of him, Miss
Boldero ? ? I asked, fixing my eyes on her.
? Yes, I saw him,? said Miss Boldero carelessly ;
?he asked me to tell you not to keep tea for
him, because he had to ride over to Crofton
Mills.?
? Crofton Mills 1 ? cried mother; ? I?ve no patience
with Ralph ; he?ll end by making himself ill, tear-
ing about all over the country like this. He looked
pretty nearly dead last night when he got home;
I don?t know what he?ll look like to-night, I?m sure.
Crofton Mills, indeed, why couldn't he have gone
there to-morrow ? ?
Mother kept on complaining till the tea things
were cleared away, when she sat down to the
paper, and Miss Boldero and I went into the little
back-room to wash up the cups and saucers. We
always had to do this now Phcebe was away,
or else we should have had all our china smashed
in a week.
? And where did you go for a walk, Miss 80l-


dero ? ? I asked, when we were in the middle of our
business.
?Oh, some little way up the Durnford Road,?
she answered, not in the least taken aback by the
question.
? Didn't you hear my brother caution us not to
?/ */
go there ? ? I said severely.
? That was for you ; it had nothing to do with
me.
? You know perfectly well, Miss Bolder�, that it
was intended for you as much as for me, and I am
surprised you should have so directly disobeyed his
wishes.?
?He has no authority over me,? she cried, her
cheeks glowing and her eyes flashing.
? Well, there?s no occasion to break the cups over
it, Miss Boldero,? I replied, keeping my temper in a
way that I always feel did me great credit; ?be-
cause that won?t mend matters. I think, seeino-
-7 O
that you are staying in the house in the way you
are, you ought to give as little trouble as possible.?
? I don?t see how I have given any trouble in
this case. I only want to be left alone, and not to
trouble anyone.?
As she didn?t seem to know that Ralph had gone
ofl on purpose to look after her, of course I was
not going to tell her, so I only said, ?


? Well, I hope it won?t happen again,? and hear-
ing- mother call I went off and left her to her re-
O
flections, and I hope they did her good.
Ralph turned up a little before supper-time look-
ing very fagged, and mother gave him no peace
with her lamentations over him, till he got quite
out of patience; for there were times when he
hated having- a fuss made with him. All this
o
while I was dying with curiosity to hear what had
passed between him and Miss Boldero, hut of course
I asked no questions, hoping he would come out
with something about it by-and-by. I generally
sat up with Ralph for half-an-hour or so, after the
rest had gone to bed, while he smoked his pipe and
talked over the day?s doings. To-night, though I
felt very tired, I sat on patiently knitting, while
Ralph, seated by the open window, puffed clouds of
smoke out into the night air. I watched him every
now and then as he sat with the outline of his face
showing against the pale light, for I had put out
the candles, and the room was quite dark.
He was very quiet, and said nothing, but he kept
smiling to himself every now and then in a con-
tented sort of way that aggravated me; I can
hardly tell why. At last I could bear it no longer.
I would hear something.
? So you saw Miss Boldero this afternoon, Ralph ??


Yes.?
Up the Durnford Road ?
Yes.?
? Well, I never! What an obstinate sirl she is.
O
No answer.
? I hope she felt ashamed of herself when she
saw you ? ?
? I?m sure I can?t say.?
? I should think she was sorry to see you after
having behaved like that ? ?
? On the contrary, I think she was rather glad.?
? Oh-h-h ! ? I said, and the word meant a great
deal.
? I mean,? he added, turning his head round
from the window for a moment, ? that she was
rather frightened, and so, of course, glad to see
anyone.?
? What frightened her ? ?
? Oh, a half-tipsy fellow, with a screw loose in
his head as well, I should say. He was preaching
a sort of sermon in the lane when I came up, with
Miss Boldero for his entire congregation. And a
very frightened-looking congregation he had.?
? Why didn?t she run away ? ?
?Because he wouldn?t let her pass. So there
she stood and listened, and there he stood and
ranted.?


? What did you do, Ralph ? ?
? Kicked him into the ditch and brought her
home,? replied Ralph, tranquilly filling- his pipe.
? Well, I never,? I said again. ? After all, it
served her right.?
? Served her right! Poor child. How can vou
o �/
he so unfeeling,? exclaimed Ralph indignantly.
? Well, so it did I ? I said also indignant at being
O O
called unfeeling for nothing at all: ? and vou
know if it had been me that had done it, the first
thing vou would have said would have been, ?Well,
O ?/ 7 7
it serves you right.? ?
%j o
?I shouldn?t have said anything of the sort,?
?/ O 7
said Ralph, but his tone was not so decided as
it had been the minute before.
?Well, I gave her a good talking to when she
7 O O O
got home,? I went on, for I thought it right he
0 7 7 c* o
should know how ill-tempered she had been, ? and
1 hope she will be more obedient another time.
But she went off into one of her tantrums over
it.?
Ralph turned round once more from the window
and, taking his pipe from his mouth, said very
quietly,?
? What did you say to her ? ?
? Oh,? I replied, thinking it over, ? I told her she
had no business to disobey you, and that as she


was staving- here, she ought to give us as little
*J O 7 o O
trouble as possible.?
? Oh, indeed. Anything else ? ?
?No, I don?t think I said anything else much.?
She seemed to take what little I did say so badly,
that I thought it was no use saving any more.?
O %J O
? Now, I should like to know, Jane, what on
earth induced you to say all this ? ?
I could see now that he was very anory, thouo-h
he was still very quiet over it.
? I felt it my duty to give her a word of advice,?
I answered.
? You generally seem to feel it your duty to
make her as unhappy as you can. What did she
say, pray ? ?
? She said you had no authority over her,? I
said, feeling sure he would be angry with her for
that; but there?s no accounting for a man in
love.
?No authority over her, no; I wish to heaven I
had ; he was walking up and down the darkened
room now, and I could not see his face as he
spoke.
? Ralph, Ralph., how can you?be so demented ??
I was on the point of saying, but I stopped myself
at the first five words.
? Look here, Jane,? he said, stopping in front


of me, ? I don?t know ?I can t tell ?but I almost
thought to-day that Lottie?Miss Boldero didn t
O *
dislike me quite as much as I have always thought
she did.?
I longed to say, ? That?s very possible,? but I
managed to hold my tongue.
? And now, Jane, you are going just the way
to spoil any chance I may have of making her
care for me. And I won?t stand it.
? Well, I?m sure,? I said, ? I think you ought
to be very much obliged to me for telling her
she ought to obey you. If you are going to
marry her, I suppose thats what you will want
her to do ? ?
?We haven?t got to the obeying part yet. I
want her to like me, which its very certain she
never will do as long as you keep worrying her
as you do.?
? Well, I think you are very stupid, Ralph,? I
said crossly. This was the first time we had
ever spoken together about Miss Boldero since
that walk home through the fields, and I was
determined to show him what I thought this
time. ? What can you see to care for in that
girl, who always treats you so badly ? ?
?That?s my business,? he answered, and when
Ralph spoke in that tone, I knew it was time to be


careful. Not that I was at all afraid of him, oh
dear no! a younger brother, indeed! but one
doesn?t care to have a quarrel if one can help it
at any time.
? And then to tell her she ought to give us as
little trouble as possible. Enough to make her
think she was not wanted, and that we should be
glad to get rid of her.?
These were so exactly my feelings on the
subject, that I was silent. Ralph went on, ?
?As if she were not the very light of the
house! I can?t imagine how we ever got on
without her; and to think of going on living
here, if she should go away, almost drives me
mad.?
? Very well, Ralph,? I said, rising and gathering
my work together, with a choking in my throat
and a mist before my eyes ; ? you need not say
any more. But you always seemed very happy
living here with mother and me, and I had no
idea a stranger could come between us. I shall
get used to it in time, no doubt, but it seems
odd to think you should care more for 1 a girl
you have known a few weeks, than for the
mother and sister who have loved you all their
lives.?
I went out of the room quickly, and ran up-


stairs without saying good-night to him or
kissing him, as I had done every night ever
since I could remember. I heard his footsteps
along the passage, and then his voice calling softly,
but eagerly,?
?Jane, Jane, come down, I want to speak to
you.?
But I would not listen. I went into my room
and bolted the door, and kneeling down by the
bedside, I hid my face in my hands, and cried as
I had not done since father?s death.
Oh, Ralph, Ralph, they were bitter tears you
made me shed that night, for I felt as if I had lost
my only brother.


CHAPTER XL
JANE BERTRAM?S STORY.
Ralph and I had a sort of explanation the next
day; at least he explained and argued and proved
very thoroughly how unreasonable I was, and I
listened, and said very little. But my heart was
hitter towards him, and I suppose I showed it in
the few words I did say, for he went off hurt and
angry, and this was the beginning of a coolness
between us which lasted for many a weary day.
I don?t know much or care much about poetry,
but the other day Kitty was reading some aloud to
me, and when she came to some lines which ran, ?
? For to be wroth with one we love,
Doth work like madness in the brain.?
I said, ?
? Well, I never thought much of poets before, but
if they always wrote such true things as that, I
should like them better.?


Kitty ?wondered why I took such a fancy to
those two lines, and made her read them over and
over till I knew them by heart, for I told her I
thought the rest of the poem sad rubbish, without
a bit of meaning in it. When she reads this his-
tory some day, she will remember, and understand.
It was a dreadful time for me, thouo-h I hardened
' O
my heart and persuaded myself I did not care.
There was no sufficient outward difference for any-
one to guess there was anything amiss between us :
mother never dreamt of such a thing, but there it
was, and life grew very dreary to me.
I am not the sort of person, I hope, at any time
to make a fuss about nothing; to be always having-
little quarrels, and fancying my feelings have been
wounded, or some nonsense or other. But here I
could not get over Ralph?s own words, that he
could not endure the thought of o-oino? on livino*
o O �3
here alone with mother and I. And he had not
said it in anger to vex me : I could have forgotten it
then ; hut no, he had simply stated it as a fact. I
longed to tell mother all about it, but of course I
could not, because I had promised Ralph to tell
his secret to no one; and, besides, surely it would
nearly break her heart to hear he had ever said
such a thino*.
O
It was rather curious, I thought, that two days


after this, mother should begin talking to me about
Ralph?s marrying some day, ? When, of course, Jane,
he won?t want you or I any longer.?
? Oh, of course not,? I said bitterly; ? but how
did you come to be so clever, mother, as to guess
that ??
? Oh, it?s only natural: we?ve Scripture for it,?
said mother.
? I don?t see we?ve any Scripture that tells us to
leave off loving all our relations for the sake of
O
one person.?
?Of course not,? said mother, ? and I should
hope no one would ever want to do anything so
shocking.?
? People do shocking things sometimes,? I re-
plied, ? and I suppose the relations have to put up
with it. One good thing is, that I daresay they
don?t care much, after a bit.?
? Well, there?s no fear of Ralph not caring for
his relations, whether he is married or single,? said
mother, with a triumphant little laugh.
? Oh, mother, mother,? I thought, ? how you are
deceiving yourself.? Aloud I said, though my heart
rather misgave me, ?
O 7
? How can you tell, mother ? ?
? Oh, it?s only selfish people who do that sort of
thing,? said mother confidently; ? and if the girl he


is going to marry thinks it a great proof of how
much the man loves her, she makes a great mis-
take. A good son and a good brother makes a
O o
good husband; and Ralph is both these.?
? Yes, but then, mother, when he is a good hus-
band, he won?t think it worth the bother to be a
good son and a good brother into the bargain. It
would be expecting too much of him.?
? What nonsense you talk, Jane. Ralph couldn?t
care less for us if he wanted to ever so much.?
? I don?t know that, mother. We never know
what we can do till we try.?
? Well, I know it, his mother, who ought to know
best of all.?
? And yet you said just now he wouldn?t want
us when he was married. I?m sure you wouldn?t
like to be living away from him.?
? I shouldn?t mind, if I knew the dear boy was
happy,? said mother calmly, and she did not seem
to see, as I did, how shocking it was that he
should be happy under such circumstances. I be-
gan to doubt even if she would be so very dis-
o *
tressed if I were to tell her what Ralph had said.
It was very odd, and I couldn?t understand it at
all. It seemed rather poor-spirited to me, this not
minding seeing oneself put on one side, and I felt
glad I was different. I didn?t say any more at the


time, but I thought a good deal over what she had
said, and how she always sacrificed herself to
Ralph?s happiness, and I came to the conclusion
that such unselfishness might be very beautiful,
but it was very aggravating sometimes.
Now and then I used to look back to the days
before Miss Bolder� had come amongst us. What
a peaceful, happy time it had been, to be sure.
Mother well, mother wasn?t much different to
what she was now; but Ralph always contented
and cheerful, and I?oh, I had not half valued my
happiness as I ought to have done. I got very
little satisfaction now from thinking that Miss
Bolder� would perhaps soon go back home again:
the mischief was done, and it mattered very little
whether she went or stayed. There were no long
evening talks now, and I missed sorely not hearing
all the little bits of news about the farm matters,
and how things were going on; but it made me
glad to think that Ralph missed them as much.
For I knew there was many a time when he would
have been glad to consult me about this or that,
but I never gave him a chance. He began too to
be very short tempered, so that mother even
noticed it, and told me she thought he couldn?t be
quite well; at which I laughed. If Ralph had
expected Miss Boldero would treat him differently


after that Durnford Road business, he soon found
out his mistake, for she did not alter her conduct in
the least. No doubt, what with one thing and
another, he had a good deal to try his temper, but
then he had brought it all on himself.
So time went on till Miss Bolder� began to start
and colour when the postman knocked at the door;
but no letter ever came for her.
? It was very strange,? mother said, but I didn?t
think it strange at all. Of course, having once
got her off their hands, they would not be in
any hurry to have her back again. However,
she didn?t seem to think so, or else she pretended
she didn?t.
? I am afraid some of them must be ill,? she
said one day, after she had watched the postman
go past the gate.
? Oh, I daresay they?re busy,? I said.
She didn?t say anything in reply, but as she
turned away from the window, I saw two or
three tears rolling down her cheeks. Of course
I was sorry for her, in a way; but then, why
hadn?t she stopped with her relations, if she was
so fond of them ?
Soon after I saw her going off to Mrs Fon-
O O
taine?s. She went there very often now. Mrs
Fontaine had taken a great fancy to her, though


I don?t think Mary cared much for her. I didn?t
approve of her going there so much, for I had
my doubts as to the sort of character of us she
would give to Mrs Fontaine; but, of course, I
couldn?t prevent her.
When she got back, she looked so important
and serious, that I wondered what was up now.
She went upstairs and brought down her desk.
Then she tried about half-a-dozen pens before
she found one quite to her mind; then she went
hunting about to get two envelopes just the size
she wanted. She had to get mother to o-ive her
o o
two after all (one was a size smaller than the
other), and then at last she sat down and began
to write. I happened to be passing behind her
soon after, and without thinking about it, I
glanced over her shoulder, and there I saw the
paper headed with ?As Companion to an Aged
Lady or Invalid.? I didn?t read any more, for
I was obliged to rush out of the room to hide
my laughter. Really I couldn?t help it: the
idea was too ridiculous. Fancy any aged lady
or invalid being so demented as to take Miss
Boldero as a companion. Poor old lady! or poor
invalid! I don?t know which I should pity the
most. Fancy Miss Boldero amusing the aged
lady by dancing the double shuffle in old Billy?s


best style, or keeping the invalid lively by flying?
into one of her tantrums. Oh, dear 1 I sat and
laughed till the tears rolled down my cheeks;
and Kitty kept on saying,??Auntie, do tell me
what you are laughing at,"? for she longed to join
in the joke.
I didn?t say anything about it to anyone. It
was no business of mine, and I?m sure if anv old
lady or invalid felt inclined to give Miss Boldero
a salary or a home for driving them pretty
nearly wild, no one could be more pleased than
myself.
The letter went off that day, and by-and-by
came letters, several letters, to Miss Boldero.
Poor mother?s curiosity was so dreadfully raised
by the sight of these letters, not one of them
with an Australian stamp on it, that I was
obliged to give her a hint how the land lay.
She didn?t seem to be so much amused by the
idea as I had been, but thought with me it
would be a very good thing if Miss Boldero
could find herself a home.
?For really, Jane, I begin to think they don?t
intend to have her back again.?
O
? I didn?t ever expect they would, mother.?
? Dear me ! Well, I call it very shocking for
people to desert their relations, and shift them on


to other people; but it?s a wicked, heartless world
?and the sooner Miss Boldero gets a situation, the
better.?
I daresay Ralph was as curious as mother about
those letters, but he never asked any questions,
and no one told him anything. Miss Boldero an-
swered one or two of the letters, and got one reply,
when she announced to us that she was going oft
for a day to London, to see about a situation as
companion to an old lady living at Kensington.
How she got the money for the journey I don?t
know; she never asked us for any, so I suppose
Mrs Fontaine lent her some. Not only did she
lend her the money, but she went up with her,
which I thought very kind, but rather absurd.
I wasn?t in the room when mother told Ralph
where Miss Boldero had gone, and what she had
gone after, but I suppose Ralph made a great fuss
about it, because mother was in such low spirits
for the rest of the day, saving every now and
J 7 J O' t/
then, that she ? only wanted to act for the best,
and it couldn?t be helped now, so there was no use
worrying over it,? and then she went on worrying
over it more than ever. I have no doubt Ralph
thought I was at the bottom of it all, and that I
had suggested to Miss Boldero the idea of looking
OO o
out for a situation. Well, it didn?t matter to me


what he thought, and I wasn?t going to give my-
self the trouble of explaining things.
" And Ralph says,'? went on mother, just as I
was hoping she had forgotten all about it, ? that
he doesn?t know what Mrs Fontaine must think
of us, letting Lottie go out to a situation like this.?
?I dont suppose Mrs Fontaine expects us to
support her all our lives,? I said sharply.
? I don t believe she?d do it herself,? said mother,
plucking up a little spirit at last.
? Of course she wouldn?t,? I replied ; but I knew
all the time it was no use talking, and that one
word of Ralph?s was worth more than twenty of
mine, and that mother would be uncomfortable in
her mind till Lottie came home, and we heard the
result of her journey.
Lottie came in at about seven o?clock in the even-
ing, and I could see by the first look at her face
that she had been unsuccessful. Mother, Kitty,
and Ralph had gone out for an evening stroll
round the farm, so I was alone in the house.
?Well, Miss Boldero?? I said, as she came into
the parlour.
?It was no use; she said I wasn?t staid enouo-h
looking, whatever that means.?
? The old lady said so ? ?
?Yes. She asked me if I liked ?a quiet life? 7


and I said, ? No, but I could put up with it.? Then
she shook her head, and asked me if I liked
? fancy work ? ? and I said ? No, hut I could do it.?
Then she asked me if I liked ? reading aloud ? ? and
O
I said ?Not particularly;? so she asked me what
sort of things I did like, and I said, ? Running about
O 7 7 O
out of doors and playing with Kitty, and feeding
the animals, and having lots to do.? So she shook
her head more than ever, and told Airs Fontaine
she thought I was too much of a child to suit her,
and that she wanted someone who could teach
her some new stitches in knitting, and who could
sit still nearly all day, without wanting to go out.
I told her I could learn some patterns of knitting
from Mrs Bertram, and that she might tie me
down to the chair if she liked ; but it wasn?t a
bit of use, she was determined not to have me.?
Of course I didn?t tell her that I thought the
old lady a very sensible old lad}' indeed, but that
was my opinion all the same. Lottie seemed a
good deal disappointed about it; but really how
she could have expected anything else, puzzled me.
No more answers came from the advertisement,
and so Miss Boldero?s attempt to get a situation as
companion fell to the ground. Mother, I verily
believe, was more glad than sorry it had all ended
as it did.


It was about two or three days after this, that, as
I was walking with Kitty along one of the lanes,
Tom Hinton came hurrying past us. At least he
seemed as if he was going to pass us with a ? Good
afternoon ? and slight raising of his hat (he had
given up wearing the odd large hat he used to go
about in: I suppose Mary had made him); but he
suddenly changed his mind, and, stopping short,
turned and walked with us. As he walked along
by the side of us, without saying a word, I was
rather at a loss to know what to talk about,
especially as he looked so dreadfully miserable and
depressed. It was quite a new thing to me to
see Mr Hinton looking anything but cheerful and
full of spirits, so I didn?t know what to make
of it.
? How is Mary ? ? I said at last, thinking this
would be sure to be a pleasant subject to talk
about.
? I?m sure I don?t know,? he said, making furrows
in the dust with his stick.
? Bless my heart! ? I cried, for I was so surprised
I couldn?t help showing it. ?Run along, Kitty
dear,? I added the next moment, remembering our
little pitcher had very long ears, and was fond of
using them; ? run along, and see if you can get a
posy for grandmother.?


? Miss Bertram, I?m the most wretched being
alive. Mary has flung me over.?
?/ o
? Flung you over ! ? I repeated, in amazement;
? whatever for ? ?
?We had a?sort of disagreement,? said Tom.
? Miss Bertram, did it ever occur to you that Mary
is just a little vain ? ?
I confessed that the idea had occurred to me, and
he went on.
?Of course, it?s only natural and quite right,
seeing how lovely and attractive she is, but you
know ?it seems to me she oughtn?t to care so
much about having other people admire her, now
she?s engaged.?
o o
I told him I quite agreed with him, which seemed
to please him, and yet at the same time vex him.
I believe he would have liked it better if I had
stood up for Mary through thick and thin.
? Well, there?s a stupid sort of fellow living here
his name is Jackson ; perhaps you know him ; any-
way, I daresay you?ve heard of him. He?s the
greatest flirt going; and now he?s taken it into
his head to flirt with Mary. Of course I could
soon make him leave that off; but how can I, when
Mary encourages him in every way ? We had a
sort of quarrel about it some time back, after a pic-
nic, but that was made up again.?


? And so this will be.?
? Xo, it won?t,? said Tom despondently ; ? because,
you see, I can?t help thinking she cares for him
more than she does for me. She must, or she
wouldn?t act so.?
? Oh, that?s all nonsense,? I said cheerfully.
* ?/
? Xo, it isn?t. It?s all over, and I don?t care what
becomes of me.?
? What does Mrs Fontaine say ? ?
? Oh, she?s very kind, and very sorry, and all
that sort of thing; but what?s the good ? ?
?But, Mr Hinton, it?s ridiculous to go on like
this. You are the man, and ought to take the first
step to come forward and make it up.?
? Xo, that I never will do, and if you knew all
about it, you would agree with me. Only I should
like to give that fellow a good hiding.?
I was very sorry for him, but I could not help
wishing he would be a little less excited, and not
kick up the dust so. It took me a good hour?s
brushing when I got home, before I could make
myself fit to be seen.
I did my best to comfort him, but I don?t believe
he heard a word I said, and in the middle of
it all he turned round and walked off. It was
very rude, but I couldn?t feel angry with him, he
looked so miserable. After all, I couldn?t make


out exactly why the engagement was broken off,
but soon after I heard all about it, and very angry
I was with Mary, and a good lecture I gave her.
Whether it did her any good or not was another
matter.


CHAPTER XII.
tom?s appeal.
? I only know we loved in vain?
I only feel?Farewell; farewell.?
Yes, the news was soon all over Cragford that the
engagement between ? that pretty Miss Fontaine ?
and ? that plain young Hinton ? had been broken
off. There were people who said they were sur-
prised, and people who said they had always
expected it. Mr Basset remarked that if Miss
Mary didn?t take care, she would fall between
two stools, which, as everyone agreed, was a very
coarse way of putting it.
On the whole, Mary found that the breaking off
of her engagement attracted more attention and
!D O
interest than the making of it had done. It was
nice to feel that everyone was talking about her,
J O '
and saying how Miss Fontaine had broken off her
�/ o
engagement because Mr Hinton was so dreadfully
jealous, and how madly in love with her Mr Jackson
was. (People made a good many other remarks


not quite so benevolent to Mary, but these did not
always come to her ears.) It was nice to feel her-
self of such importance, but it was not nice when
Mr Jackson, alarmed by the discovery that every-
one was expecting him immediately to propose,
departed for a Continental tour; and, aboye all,
it was not nice, but extremely disagreeable, to be
without Tom.
On the breaking off of the engagement there
o o o
had, of course, been another ? scene,? in which
Tom, though not possessing the majesty of person
or sublimity of language of Sir Guy, had yet
figured in a fairly dramatic manner. It was a
scene, somehow, which Mary did not care to look
back upon, only she couldn?t forget it, try as she
would. She had an uneasy consciousness that she
had not distinguished herself on that occasion, and
there had been something in Tom?s last words that
had?only that was impossible?almost a touch of
scorn in it.
Mary was one of those people (there are a good
many of them in the world) who, directly they lose
a thing, value it as they never did before. So she
missed Tom terribly, and found her several flirta-
tions only a poor compensation for his absence;
but, humble herself to confess this to Tom?never!
As Mrs Fontaine said, with a sigh,?
7 CD '


? Who would have thought Mary had got so
? o �/ O
much of her poor dear father in her disposition ? ?
Hitherto Tom had always been the one to come
forward and make the first advance towards a
reconciliation, and Mary still hoped he would do
so now. But week after week passed by, and no
Tom came whistling up the path ; no Tom appeared
smilingly at the drawing-room window ; no Tom
o �/? O '
came racing over the fields; and it was very dull
without him. Soon it became more than dull, ?it
became miserable.
Of course, in a little place like Cragford it was
impossible but that Tom and Mary should come
across each other sometimes, and these encounters
soon became the most interesting events of their
lives to both parties. At first Mary was supported
by the novelty of the situation, and a sense of what
was due to herself and her dignity. The encounter
O
taking place in the High Street, she was also sup-
ported by the fact of the public eye being upon her,
and she succeeded in passing Tom with the chilliest
of bows. Poor Tom, who was supported by nothing
at all, was not so successful. He looked at her
wistfully, and felt as if his feet had suddenly
become weighted with lead, so impossible did it
seem to pass her thus. But each went on their
way, and which was the most unhappy of the


two it would be hard to tell. All this time Mary
knew that one word, almost one look, would have
brought Tom to her side, and it was a good deal
this knowledge that kept her from giving that
word or look. She could do it any time, and
meanwhile she could enjoy herself. It was curious,
though, to find how flat her flirtations seem e l now ;
half their zest had departed with Tom, and she
soon got tired of them; after all, none of these
admirers cared for her as Tom had done. They
appreciated her beauty of person, but they did not
appreciate her beauty of disposition as Tom did,
and though Mary felt a doubt about herself some-
times in this last particular, she none the less liked
to have the credit of it. Indeed, Tom?s firm faith
in her had done something: it had made her wish
several times that she could become all he believed
her to be.
Meanwhile Tom worked desperately on his farm,
and did his best to forget his troubles. But it was
hard work ; modest as Tom was, he knew that this
deep true love for Mary was worth something, and
that he had met with but a poor return for it. His
faith in Mary had been rudely shaken, but he loved
her as much as ever, and he knew that this love
for her would last as long as his life did.
? It was no use trying to get over it,? as he said


when Ralph had been offering him some well-meant
consolations, because the more he tried the more it
got over him.
Tom laughed drearily at his small witticism: it
O ?/
was seldom, indeed, that he spoke to anyone of
his troubles, and now he soon walked away with
the quiet step he had lately fallen into, so different
to the headlong pace of former days. But where
was the hurry now ? It didn?t much matter if the
farm paid or not; he had enough to live upon by
himself.
Ralph went home, and spoke violently against
Mary Fontaine ; then, as that did no good, he sug-
�/ J 7 o 7 o
gested that Jane should give her ? a-talking to,?
a suggestion which, like most of his suggestions
just now, did not meet with a very warm recep-
tion. This was the more to be excused, as Jane
had already exhausted a good deal of breath in
Tom?s cause, vainly.
As for Dick, he was furiously indignant, and
would have treated Tom pretty freely to his opinion
about Mary?s behaviour, if that individual had not
most ungratefully ordered him to hold his tongue
and mind his own business. After such a dread-
ful example of the ingratitude of the world, Dick?s
sympathy considerably declined, and some exciting-
cricket matches taking place just then, he soon for-


got all about it. Alas ! poor Tom, if you could but
have forgotten as easily.
Lewis happened to be away from home at the
time of the breaking of the engagement, but he
wrote Mary a letter, over which she actually cried,
saying, ? she always knew Lewis was not very
fond of her, but she never would have believed he
could have been so hard upon her, or said such
cruel things.?
Mrs Fontaine remarked sorrowfully, that she
did hope this sad affair would not lead to any
family quarrels. If Lewis had written a little
sharply, Mary must know he only intended it for
her good.
? But I don?t care to be lectured by a younger
brother, if he does mean it for my good,? said
Mary passionately.
Poor Mrs Fontaine was very unhappy just now.
She had grown extremely fond of Tom, and all
her sympathy was enlisted in his behalf; but she
could do nothing to help him, and Tom, though
grateful to her, was quite aware of this fact.
So time passed by, very heavily for Tom, till
the leaves began to turn red and yellow, and to
curl up at the edges, and the harvest had been
gathered in, and the blackberries were ripe, and
ready for the cottage children?s eager hands.


There were other eager hands, though, besides
the cottage children?s, one bright October morn-
ing, gathering blackberries in one of the loner orass
O O
lanes not far from Cragford. There was quite a
large party assembled there for the benefit of Mrs
Bertram s winter preserves. Round one bush were
grouped, busy at work, Jane Bertram, Mary Fon-
taine, and Kitty; further up the lane could be
seen Lottie Boldero, with Dick Fontaine as her
cavalier, picking blackberries and eating them by
turns. Lottie and Dick suited each other very
well; they had many kindred tastes; each liked
to gather blackberries which grew in the most
inaccessible places, and each exhibited the same
reckless disregard for their wearing apparel in
these attempts.
Ah ! it may be a childish amusement, but it is
no unpleasant thing on a cool, bright October
morning, to go blackberrying through the lanes
where the grass is still wet with the dew in shady
places, and the air full of the fresh life-giving
scents of autumn, before the dead leaves have
begun to rot on the around.
Lottie almost forgot her troubles as she scrambled
hither and thither with Dick, her faithful knio-ht
O?
bearing the basket behind her.
? You really will make yourself ill, Dick,? she


said seriously, ? if you keep eating blackberries as
you do.?
? Oh, I?m all right,? said Dick, cramming a hand-
ful into his mouth and making himself look as if
he had just emerged from a prize-tight.
? It?s all very well to say you?re all right,? con-
tinued Lottie, ? but I don?t see the fun of picking
blackberries for you to eat.?
? Now, isn?t that just like a girl?so unreason-
able ? ? cried Dick, much aggrieved ; ? didn?t you ask
me to hold the basket for you, instead of picking-
blackberries myself ? ?
? Yes, but I didn?t ask you to take the black-
berries out as fast as I put them in,? said Lottie,
her clear laugh ringing through the lane.
There was some one coming along on horse-
back, but the tread of his horse?s feet on the grass
was so soft that Lottie never noticed him till
Dick called out, ?
? Hullo, here?s Ralph Bertram ; what a joke!
Come along, Ralph, and help us ; it?s no end of fun.?
? Shall I ? ? said Ralph, looking up at the slim
figure on the top of the bank.
?It pricks your fingers dreadfully,? said the
figure discouragingly.
O o O %J
? Oh, I don?t mind that.?
? Very well, you must do as you like.?


This was gracious for Lottie, and Ralph de-
scended with alacrity.
? Surely I see Ralph in the distance, or is it my
fancy, Mary ? and Jane took a long- look down the
lane.
? Yes, he?s helping Miss Boldero to pick black-
berries,? replied Mary with indifference.
This blackberrying excursion was dull work, she
thought, and she wondered how Lottie and Dick
could seem to enjoy it so much. She and Jane
?were good companions for each other; both went on
picking blackberries solemnly, without talking at
all hardly. Kitty found them so unsociable that
she ran ofi at last to seek more congenial spirits,
leaving them to work on in a silence which was by
no means unfriendly.
Mary was quite intent on her work, with her
head well into the bush, when she heard Jane say
quickly, in a warning voice,?
? Mary, Mr Hinton is coming this way. He can?t
have seen you yet; if you like to stay behind the
bush, he will pass 'without knowing you are there.?
But Mary was not at all disposed to avail herself
of this unpalatable suggestion. A meeting with
Tom ; it was the one excitement and interest of her
life just now, and her heart was beating so quickly
at the mere thought of it, that she felt nearly


suffocated. However, she managed to say in as
defiant a tone as she could, ?
? Keep out of his way, indeed ! I shall not take
the trouble to do that,? at the same time coming-
out of her shelter into the open lane.
Jane cast one quick inquiring glance at her, and
then moved quietly away.
Mary never raised her eyes from the blackberry
bush, and she felt rather than saw that Tom was
standing by her side. Her heart gave one joyful bound.
? He is going to try and make it up ?to beg my
pardon, and ask to have the engagement renewed.?
Tom?s first words did not sound much like any-
thing of the kind.
? Have you nothing to say to me, Mary ? ? he
said quietly.
? What should I have to say ? ? she answered
him, looking up at last and meeting his eyes.
Suddenly, as she stood there in that grassy
autumn-tinted lane, there rose up before her the
remembrance of another lane, ?a muddy dreary
lane, with the trees on each side dripping with
moisture, and in the distance a figure in a white
mackintosh coming tramp, tramp, through the
misty atmosphere. The whole scene flashed up in
her brain for a moment as she looked into Tom?s
brown eyes, then it faded away.


? What should I have to say ? ? she repeated, as
Tom said nothing, only gazed at her till her eyelids
drooped, and she stood nervously fidgeting with
the handle of her basket.
? Mary, you know well enough what I want you
to say.?
? I suppose you want me to say, ? I am very
sorry, and will you please to forgive me ? ? ?
? I will not ask you to say that, Mary, because
you shall never have to ask for my forgiveness.
You have it without any asking.?
? But I don?t want it. I have done nothing I
am ashamed of.?
? You don?t see anything to be ashamed of in
being engaged to one man, and flirting with
another I ? exclaimed Tom, his face flushing with
anger.
Was this the submission Mary had expected ? Her
indignation was almost too great for words, but
she did not tell him to go away and leave her, as
she might easily have done.
? I could not help other people falling in love
with me any more than I could help you?re being
ridiculously jealous.?
? Look here, Mary,? said Tom very quietly, ? lam
not going to let you make me angry. I have
thought this all over, ?good heavens ! what else


have I had to think of all these weeks ? ?and I
have put every excuse I could think of on your
side, and still?l can?t help seeing you are wrong.?
? What a sensible conclusion to come to 1 replied
Mary scornfully, adding somewhat illogically, ? and
that is just what I think; I can?t help seeing you
are wrong either. Only I haven?t taken the
O *
trouble to think it over so much as you seem
to have done.?
? Perhaps that is because you don?t care so
much ? ?
? Perhaps it is.?
? Well, I have one question to ask you, Mary,
and then I have done altogether?altogether.
I will never trouble you any more. I don?t ask
you if you are sorry for what is past; I only
want you to give me one word?yes or no?as an
answer to what I say.?
He had taken both her hands in his strong
grasp, and held them firmly.
? Mary, my darling, if I never call you so
again, are you happy '( I don?t ask you to think
of me, or how happy or unhappy your answer
may make me I don?t want you to think
of me at all?l only want you to tell me the
truth, and if you made a mistake before in
thinking you cared for me, not to make it


again. Mary, are you happy, as you are now
free from our engagement ? ?
O o
Mary stood there, in the clear October sunshine,
with the keen fresh autumn breeze swaying the
ribbons of her hat; she even noticed that it had
blown her basket over, and that the blackberries
were lying half-hidden amongst the long grass.
In the distance, faint but clear, came the sound
of voices?Ralph?s deep tones, Kitty?s shrill treble,
Dick?s gruff accents. It all felt like a dream,
and the only real thing was the warm clasp of
Tom?s hands round her own.
What should she say ? Happy ? She was
unutterably desolate. But then to confess to
Tom that she could not do without him?im-
possible ; she would despise herself ever after-
wards if she did such a thing. If he had asked
her to forgive him for the angry words with
which he had last left her, it would have been
different, but now by-and-by perhaps she
would; yes, she certainly would, by that time
he would value her compliance more, but now?
it would never do.
She snatched her hands away from Tom?s and
said, ? Yes,? with the desperate decision which
comes of secret doubt.
? Then God bless you, Mary ! It was a pity


you made such a mistake, but it was like your
own sweet goodness to try and return my love.
Forgive me, dearest, all the pain I must have
caused you.?
He bent his head and kissed her gravely, then
walked slowly away. Before he had gone many
paces, he turned and gazed steadfastly at her for
a moment or two, and Mary will never forget that
last look to her dying day.


CHAPTER XIII.
JANE BERTRAM?S STORY.
? The corn is reaped, the sheaf is hound,
The gleaner?s foot is on the ground,
And pain is past?and life is done ! ?
I MOSTLY find, after taking a holiday, that I have
to work twice as hard the next day to make up
for it, so I don?t often take one. The day after
we had all gone blackberrving together, I had
O t/ o o
plenty to do all day long, and though I never
mind work, I felt thoroughly cross and out of
sorts with everyone. I felt angry with Mary
for being such an obstinate, proud peacock, for
though she never told me a word, of course I
could see easily enough that things were no
smoother between her and Mr Hintqn. I was
angry with Tom Hinton for being so stupid as
to still care for Mary. I was angry with Lottie
because she had let Ralph walk home with her.


and I was angry, bitterly angry with Ralph him-
self, only that was no new thing.
The days were drawing in now, and the
evenings getting chilly, so we had begun to have
a fire in the parlour after five o'clock. I was
standing over it making toast for tea, when Ralph
came in and announced that he was just going
to the Gable Farm, ?Tom Hinton had sent round
for him.
? Whatever can Hr Hinton want with you now ? ?
cried mother crossly; ?he lets you have no peace
of your life.?
?J
? I suppose, from what the boy says, it has some-
thing to do with that precious bit of preserve
Hinton is always making such a fuss over. I
know he has been grumbling a lot lately about
poachers, being uncommonly proud all the while
to have such a thing to grumble about. Any-
way, I shall be back in the evening. Good-bye.?
I took no notice of him, or of what he said, and
he went out shutting the parlour door sharply
behind him.
We had tea, mother, Lottie, Kitty and I, and
afterwards, as we sat at our work, and Kitty at her
lessons (for she went to a day-school now), Lottie
played and sang to us. Perhaps if Ralph had been
at home, she wouldn?t have done it, but as he was


safely out of the way, she sang song after song, as
if she could never tire. People said she sang very
well, for she had had good lessons when her father
had been well off and lived at Melbourne.
I can remember, to this day, the last song she
was singing as the clock struck eight. It was one
I had never heard before, and I think it was
called ? Away with Melancholy,? or some such
title. Any way, it seemed a wild, heathenish sort
of thing to me, with something about?
? Eor what?s the use of sighing,
When time is on the wing,
Can we prevent his flying,
Then merrily, merrily, sing fal la.?
She was just singing this, and Kitty was so
taken with the tune, that she asked to have it over
again, when I saw Phoebe?s head put in at the door
in search of me. I went out and into the back
kitchen, when Phoebe handed me a slip of paper,
which she said a boy had brought, with orders that
it was to be given to me alone. It was just a leaf
torn out of Ralph?s pocket-book, with a few lines
scribbled on it in pencil:?
? Dear Jane, ? I shall not be home till late. I
find I am wanted here to make one of a surprise
party. Hinton has had information that two or


three fellows are going to come poaching to-night,
so we hope to collar them in the act. Don?t men-
tion this to the mother: she might get nervous ;
say I shall be detained, you needn?t say what for.?
Yr. aflect ate - brother, Ralph.?
I read these few lines by the flickering, uncer-
tain light of Phoebe?s one tallow candle. Then I
folded up the paper, and a sort of shiver (what
mother calls ? somebody walking over one?s grave ?)
ran over me. Through the open parlour door
came Lottie?s clear voice, and it sounded queer and
reckless?
11 Come on, ye rosy hours,
Gay, smiling moments bring ;
We?ll strew the way with flowers,
And merrily, merrily, sing fal la,
I felt as if I couldn?t bear it any longer, and walked
quickly back into the parlour.
? Do, for goodness? sake, leave off that,? ?but my
voice was drowned in the mad chorus, which
Kitty had joined in,?
?Merrily, merrily, sing fal la.?
Then Lottie stopped abruptly, and a great silence
seemed to fall all over the room.
My own voice sounded unreal, I thought, as I
told mother Ralph would not be home till late


to-night, as Mr Hinton wanted him. I was afraid
she might guess what Ralph was wanted for, hut
she didn?t seem to think any more of what he had
said about poachers; and though she grumbled
a bit, she ate her supper contentedly, and went off
to bed at her usual time.
Every one went to bed except me. I would sit
up for Ralph, I said. Phoebe went the round of
the house, putting up bars and fastening bells on
to the old-fashioned shutters; then I heard her
go yawning up the creaking staircase to her own
room, and I was quite alone.
I stirred the fire, and put Ralph?s slippers in
front of it; wondering at the time what made me
do to-night what I had carefully neglected doing for
so many weeks. Then I took up a book, the first
one that came to hand, and began to read. But
all the letters seemed to dance up and down, and
I couldn?t fix my attention on the page. I was
sorry just then that I had never made myself like
reading better, so that I could have distracted my
thoughts from that horrible mocking chorus, ?
? Merrily, merrily, sing fal la, sing fal la,?
Even the clock seemed to take up the last three
words, and go on saying them over and over again.
? This will never do,? I said at last, getting up


and walking about the room; ? I do believe I am
O 7
really thoroughly nervous. Whatever can have
upset me so ? ?
I took out Ralph?s note. There was nothing in
it to alarm anyone except mother, and yet how
thankful I should be to hear his footstep on the path.
I went to the side-door, and carefully letting
down the bar, I opened it quietly and looked out.
It was a cloudy night, with a smell of rain in the
air. I strained my eyes to see down the path, but
there was no one in sight; I strained my ears to
catch any sound of footsteps in the distance, but I
heard nothing. Old Rover, the yard-dog, gave a
short, low growl, and I went forward and patted
him and spoke a few words softly to him, and he
lay down as quietly as before.
Just as I was going back I heard the church
clock in the distance strike twelve; it sent an-
other shiver through me?l don?t know why?and I
hurried back into the warm light parlour. Surely
Ralph ought to have been back by this time; the
very every-day look of things in the room, the
supper left on the table, Ralph?s slippers lying in
the fender, seemed to give me a worse chill than
the cold October night-air had done.
A sort of horror fell over me, and I sat in the
arm-chair with my hands tightly clasped, and


listened?listened as I had never done in my life
before?listened till the whole house seemed full
of strange sounds, and the old clock in the hall
still kept on saying-, over and over again, ? Sing
fal la, sing fal la,? till it drove me nearly wild.
Surely that was a step at last. Yes, old Rover
gave a warning growl, then a deep, low bark. It
was Ralph sure enough, and I would take good
care not to show him how anxious I had been;
indeed in the midst of my relief I felt very angry
that I had let myself be so easily frightened.
The steps came nearer and nearer, and I won-
dered that Ralph did not speak to quiet the dog,
who still kept on barking. Then there was a
slow fumbling at the door, and an uncertain knock.
My heart gave one violent bound; it was not
Ralph after all. It took me scarcely a moment to
tear down the bar and open the door. The moon
shone out for a minute from behind some ragged-
looking clouds, and I saw standing there one of the
farm-labourers.
? What is it, Dawson ? ? I managed to say.
The moon went suddenly behind the clouds again,
and I couldn?t see the man?s face?l could only hear
his voice coming hoarsely out of the darkness.
? There?s something gone wrong, Miss Jane, over
yonder,? then he came to a dead stop.


? Yes, yes, I know,? I said, and I felt then that
I had known it all that evening; ?go on.?
?Muster Bertram, he?ve been hurt terrible bad,
Miss Jane.?
? How ? ? I asked, and for the life of me I could
only get out one word at a time.
? Shot, Miss Jane; shot down he was all of a
minute, before ere a one of us could save him.?
?Go for the doctor,? I said, gathering myself
together and trying to think ; ? run for your life,
and bring him back with you.?
The man hesitated, and I stamped my foot with
impatience; then he said slowly, leaning forward
out of the darkness, ?
? The doctor was there when I come away, and
he?s helping them to bring it home.?
There was only one word I took hold of in that
sentence, but that word seemed to burn itself into
my brain.
? Dead! ? I shrieked, and there was no need for
him to say any more?l knew it already. I
suppose the man went away, for I know I was
alone, walking quickly up and down the room
and talking to myself, and saying,?
? Dead?yes, dead. Just what I expected,? with
a curious sort of wonder as to how it had all
happened. I don?t think I felt any particular


grief just then. Suddenly I heard mother?s voice
calling to me from the head of the stairs:?
? Jane, is that Ralph come in ? I heard the dog
bark.?
Almost without thinking, I called back, ?
?It?s all right, mother. Ralph is coming,? and
I heard her go back satisfied into her own room.
Then it all came across me like lightning, how
O O 7
that Ralph veas ? coming,? how the tread of men?s
feet, bearing that awful load, must be even now
drawing nearer and nearer to the door, till I could
almost fancy I heard the steady tramp, tramp of
footsteps on the road.
Dead! And still the clock went on ticking out
o
? Sing fal la, sing fal la.? Now, God help me, or
I should go mad with the thought that we had
parted in anger.
Oh, Ralph ! Ralph 1
Footsteps on the pathway?slow, heavy foot-
steps like the tread of someone who brings bad
tidings, and yet so like Ralph?s step. I rushed
to the door and out into the darkness. It was
so dark I could scarcely see my hand before my
face, but I ran on till I was stopped by some-
one.
Jane! ? said a voice I had never expected to
hear on this earth again.
O


? Ralph! ?
That was all I said, not one word more, but he
understood. Thank God !it was not a dream, and
I held him fast.
We went into the house together, and then, in
the lighted room, I saw how fearfully white his
face was, and how he drew his breath as if he
had been running in a race.
? You are sure you are not hurt, Ralph ? ?
I exclaimed, and then he sank down on a
chair, and placing his arms on the table, laid
his head on them, and burst into short, hard
sobs.
I had never seen Ralph shed a tear before, be-
cause when father died he was away from home,
and now it frightened me. Something terrible
must have happened. Men?s tears are different
to women?s, they come harder and stop sooner.
In a few minutes Ralph was quiet again, except
that he shivered as if he was cold.
? Ralph, what is it ? What dreadful thing has
happened ? ?
? Tom I ? said Ralph, raising his head. ? That
old fool who came to you made some mistake.
It was Tom, dear old Tom, who was shot down,
not me.?
I sat perfectly stupefied. Tom, Tom Hinton! It


seemed impossible to think of anythingTtragic con-
nected with Tom.
Oh, Ralph ! ? I cried, ? he isn?t dead ?
Ralph moved his head, unable to answer. Then
I began to cry, and could only hear through sobs
Ralph?s voice as he went on talking in a dull, quiet
fashion:?
?It all happened in a moment. We were
crouched down amongst the bushes, Tom and I,
and two or three of the men, till we heard a
whistle which was to be the signal for us to
advance. We started off and ran as fast as the
bushes would let, and were in the thick of it
before the fellows had time to make off Tom
had been laughing a great deal in an excited
sort of way as we ran along, saying something
about its being good fun, or something of that
sort; I couldn?t really catch what he said. I
was laying about me as well as I could in the
moonlight, and had got my man down on the
ground, when I heard the report of a gun, and
saw Tom throw up his arms and fall backwards.
I was by his side in an instant.
? ? What is it, dear old fellow ? ? I said, as I tried
to raise him. He looked rather wildly into my face.
? ? What?s the matter with me, Ralph ? I can?t get


? ? You must have had a blow,? I said, for I
couldn?t tell him what I really thought.
? ? Or a shot,? he answered quietly ; then presently,
Well, I didn?t care much about going on living-
now.
? Several of the men had come up, and I sent off
one for a doctor. I held Tom up in my arms, and
we laid our coats over him, for we dared not carry
him to the farm. He lay quite quiet, with his eyes
open looking at the sky, and God only knows what
he was thinking; of. At last he said something so
o O
low that I was obliged to put my ear down to his
mouth to catch the words :
? ? Give my love to Mary.?
??Yes,? I said; ?but, Tom, old fellow, you will
give it her yourself, please God.?
? He never said a word to that, only smiled, then
as I put my head down again, he said faintly,?
? ? Don?t keep holding me up, you?ll get so tired.?
? I couldn?t speak a word, I should have broken
down altogether. Oh, Tom, Tom I I shall never
meet with such another unselfish soul in this
world!
? He only spoke once more, and then it was just a
few words muttered, something about ? the Ever-
lasting- Arms,? and he was gone. Jane, he died
like a hero.?


? And like a Christian. Oh, Ralph, Ralph 1 what
will become of Mary ? ?
? She will feel sorry when she hears of it, and
forget it in a month.?
I thought Ralph rather hard, and yet perhaps
he was right
� We carried him to the farm,? Ralph went on ;
? many of the men crying like children. Jane,? he
added, getting up and walking to and fro ; ?1 shall
never get over this altogether. I shall alv a\ s feel
there is something gone out of my life. I shall
never care for any other fellow as I ha\ e cared
for Tom. I would have died to save him. And so
young, poor fellow ! ?
? Ralph,? I said, brushing away ray tears ; ? I
think, perhaps, it was better so. Tom Hinton was
not the one to pass through this world easily. He
would always have given more than he got in
return.?
? Well,? said Ralph, with a heavy sigh, ? I?m glad
I haven?t got Mary Fontaine?s sins on my conscience.
She spoilt what was left of his life for him.?
?Oh, hush! hush!? I cried-; ?we can none of
us tell what Mary may have to suffer yet for v hat
she has done.?
But I, who said these words, little knew how
terribly true they might be.


CHAPTER XIV.
A LIFE-LONG REPENTANCE.
? For the waves of a mighty sorrow,
Have whelmed the pearl of my life.
Gerald Massey.
The next morning rose wet and stormy, with a
wild wind and floods of rain beating against the
windows of the Fontaines? house. It was just
such another morning, Mary thought, as the one on
which she had gone to pay her visit to Aunt
Hester; that visit which had led to such import-
ant results. How miserable and unhappy she
had been that morning. Well, she was not feeling
remarkably cheerful to-day; there was no chance
of seeing Tom, because it would be impossible to
go out?unless, indeed, the rain would only leave
off falling.
Breakfast over, and Dick off to school, Mary
went up to her own room, and at a loss to devise
some means of passing the time, employed herself
diligently in clearing out a cupboard. Amongst


many odds and ends of rubbish, there tumbled
out at last a queer old-fashioned little book, a
? Walton and Cotton?s Complete Angler,? with its
quaint woodcuts and dim print. Mary picked it
up and opened it, with a distinct remembrance of
Tom?s first call, and how, with furious blushes, he
had presented her with this little volume, saying,
as she took an interest in fishing, perhaps she
might like to have it. Mary had accepted it
graciously at the time, but her interest in fishing
being of the most superficial character, had never
opened it from that day to this.?
Now she took it up and turned over the pages
thoughtfully, and saw that there had been passages,
here and there, marked for her especial benefit.
On the back of the title-page was written in faint
ink, ? Thomas Hinton, from his affectionate father.?
Mary remembered, with a smile, how savage Dick
used to make him by insisting on calling him
? Thomas,? and how on one occasion he had chased
Dick all round the garden, and Mary had had to
interfere and save her unfortunate brother from
corporeal punishment by promising that she, at
any rate, Would never call him anything but Tom, ?
how grateful he had been to her, and what a merry
evening they had had; how Dick had made them
all laugh by pretending to be afraid to come within


reach of Tom, and how Tom, half ashamed of his
momentary fit of ill-temper, had been obliged to
laugh too. Well, those had been happy days, and
Mary smiled to herself to think that the power
all rested with her to renew them. For Tom still
loved her as much as ever; oh yes, there was no
doubt of that, Tom never could hide his feelings,
poor fellow; how hopelessly miserable he had
looked the other day, when she had told him she
was quite happy without him. Well, she would
make it up to him, some day. So Mary thought
and resolved, upstairs, with the little old ? Com-
plete Angler ?in her hands. Down in the parlour
below, Mrs Fontaine was wailing out, ?
? Oh, Jane, Jane, however shall I tell her ? How
can I ever let her know ? ?
In very pity for her distress, Jane Bertram
offered herself for the painful duty. But no.
?It shall be I, her mother, who shall tell it her,
if it break my heart in the doing,? and Mrs Fon-
taine went trembling upstairs, trying to comfort
herself with the thought that Mary could not
really have cared for poor dear Tom so very
much.
Mary looked up with a smile as her mother
entered the room, and Mrs Fontaine sat down
suddenly and burst into a fresh flood of tears.


She never knew how she got out the terrible
words at last, but she did it somehow, and Mary
would not believe it.
? Oh, no, mamma,? she kept saying, stroking and
smoothing the pages of the ? Complete Angler,?
? there is some mistake. Oh, it couldn?t be; not
just now, just now.?
?What am I to do?? cried Mrs Fontaine to
Jane, below ; ? I can?t make her believe it.?
So Jane went up, and found Mary with white
cheeks and startled eyes, but quite calm.
Little by little, and as gently as she knew how,
Jane made her understand the truth, and then,
such a terrible tempest of sorrow swept over
Mary?s soul as those only can understand who
have bowed their heads beneath the same.
Only to have seen him for one hour, one minute,
?to have told him that she loved him better than
life itself. But no, he had gone down to the
grave thinking that she had never cared for him
?thinking his own love for her had been thrown
away.
How many desolate hearts have uttered that
hopeless cry,?
? Ccmld I win you for an hour
From off that starry shore,
The hunger of my soul were stilled?'


The first shock of her bereavement was terribly
overwhelming, but it was when the first sharpness
of it had subsided, when other people were begin-
ning to forget, when the little world of Cragford
went on its way as calmly as if Tom Hinton had
never lived his cheerful life or died his tragic
death in the midst of it, that Mary?s heart sank
within her at the thought of the long vista of
o o
years before her. If only he had died in the
first flush of their engagement, when she had
OO 7
made him, as he himself had told her, ? the
happiest fellow in the world ; ? or if only they
had been reconciled that day in the Cragford
lane, as she remembered, alas! too clearly they
would have been, but for her own detestable
pride and obstinacy. She had ? boasted herself of
to-morrow,? and lo! what a day had brought
forth.
The look of his face, the sound of his voice, they
were always around and about her; above all, his
last words, ? Forgive me, dearest, all the pain I
must have caused you,? echoed in her ears. No
word of reproach, no word of complaint at his own
pain; ah, loyal, faithful, heart, so little valued, so
little understood.
Only to be able to place her hands once more in
his warm clasp, and say, with tears, his own words.


? Forgive me, dearest.? In vain ;he had gone where
no human voice could reach him, no human grief
could have power to move him.
And Mary was alone in her sorrow: no one could
enter into it with her, or even seem to understand
why she should mourn so bitterly. They were all
very kind to her, and they spoke to her gently,
when she would have been thankful if they had
said hard things to her; but theA T did not com-
O ' �
prehend.
They said, ?? Poor child, it was very sad for her,
but she would get over it by-and-by; and, after all,
she had not known poor Tom Hinton more than
three or four months.?
Jane Bertram was the only one who seemed to
be at all capable of entering into her feelings or
understanding the depth of her remorse, and even
to her Mary was silent. The shot that had put an
end to poor Tom Hinton?s life was proved to have
been entirely accidental; the funeral took place, the
Gable Farm was sold, and gradually, little by little,
Tom himself, his bright face and pleasant manners,
faded away out of the recollection of most of his
acquaintance.
It was about a week after the funeral, that Jane
went one afternoon to say good-bve to Mary, who
Avas going away for a month or more with her


mother. Mrs Fontaine had got alarmed about her,
her quiet listlessness, her indifference to everything,
and had determined to take her away for a time
from all the old scenes.
? I don?t know what to make of her, Jane. She
doesn?t seem to care for anything or anybody,
except Lewis; ? then, as Jane looked surprised,?
? Yes, it?s very odd, isn?t it ? but she seems to
cling to Lewis in a way I never should have thought
possible. He can do anything with her, and he is
wonderfully tender and considerate over her. It
is a great comfort to me in all this trouble. Oh,
Jane! what would I not give to see Tom?s dear old
face at the window again.?
When Jane was left alone with Marv, she said,
* /
holding something out in the palm of her hand.
? Mary, I thought, and Ralph thought, that may-
be you would be glad to have this back again. It
was on poor Tom?s finger, you know, when he
died.?
It was a rather shabby-looking little ring that
Mary had been fond of wearing, and when she had
put on the beautiful engagement ring Tom had
given her, he had asked her to give him this one
in exchange. Mary had demurred, on account of
its shabbiness, but had at last yielded, and the ring
had been transferred from Mary?s middle finger to


Tom?s little one. When the engagement had been
broken off, Mary, with magnificent scorn, had re-
turned his ring to Tom ; but he had continued to
wear hers. Perhaps he thought it not valuable
enough to be worth returning, or perhaps he could
not persuade himself to part with it, and thus
break the last link that held them together. How-
ever, here it was, that last link was broken now,
and the ring had returned to its rightful owner.
Mary took it, placed it thoughtfully on the finger
from whence a few months ago she had taken it;
then she kissed it, and said, ?
? That shall never come off my finger again till I
die.?
So the Fontaines went away, and instead of
staying from home a month, they stayed three.
Then one cold February day, when the snow-flakes
were falling thickly on Tom Hinton?s grave, they
came home.
People said, how dreadfully that pretty Miss
Fontaine had gone off in her looks, she was scarcely
nice-looking now ; and there was truth in the re-
mark. It seemed as if all the youth and bloom of
her beauty had been swept away.
Some kind friend went and told Mary what
people had said, and Mary smiled. Then, when
her visitor had gone, she went upstairs, and


looked long and thoughtfully at herself in the
glass.
?It is quite true,? she said. ?Oh Tom?my
love?my love?it is the only mourning I can wear
for you, and I am glad to do it.?
Yes, all Mary?s vanities and follies seemed to
have been swept away by that terrible sorrow,
and for some time there was nothing left for her
O
in life but an aching, void, and a weariness of all
things. But slowly, gradually, there arose the
light of Hope for Mary. Surely there was some-
thing yet she could do for the true, tender heart
which had given so much, and had so little in
return. To be faithful to him, that was nothing:
O'
because now ?all men to her were like shadows,?
and she could never forget Tom to her life?s end.
But could she not strive to become more like
what he had always believed her to be ; more
real, more unselfish, more noble-minded. It is
hard work to begin to live for others when one
has lived for one?s self, and Mary had to
Help before she could make any
progress in her new path.
Dimly she began to see that the whole world
was full of heavy aching hearts besides her own,
and that to be happy was by no means the primary
object for which every one had been sent into


the world. Dimly she began to understand that
the very sorrow which had darkened her whole
life, and which had at first seemed to render her
the sport of a malicious fate, had all had a
meaning.
Mary did not do anything wonderful. She
neither joined a sisterhood nor went out as an
hospital nurse ; she did not talk about ? finding
a vocation,? or propound theories ? for the ele-
vation of the masses.?
No, she did, what sounds very poor and tame
after these things, but which is, perhaps, after
all, sometimes nearly as hard, she took up just
the duties she found lying close around her at
her feet.
She made Mrs Fontaine a happier mother than
she had ever been before, by her unselfish de-
votion ; she made Lewis gentle and less hard by
the sight of her bravely - fought sorrow; and
Dick more thoughtful; she found plenty of sad
hearts to comfort, and plenty of cheerless lives
to brighten ; and in comforting others she found
comfort herself.
She had once told Tom that ? she liked sun-
shine ; ? now that had all gone out of her life;
but to live in the twilight is not always such
a terrible thing, when one can see in the far


distance the dazzling gleam of those eternal
shores, ? where they need no candle, neither light
of the sun; for the Lord God ffiveth them lio-ht.?
' O o
At the Bertrams? farm Tom Hinton was missed
sorely. Often did Ralph stop himself half-way
in the sentence, ? I wonder why Hinton hasn?t
been round,? with a quick, impatient sigh, and
Jane, not much given to expend affection on any
one outside her own home circle, would echo the
sigh. They all missed him, his bright, cheery
voice, his pleasant smile ; as Ralph had said, ? It
was something gone out of their lives,? never to
return. And it was so difficult not to think of
him as being alive and likely to come amono-st
them at any moment. If he had been ill for a
long time, and then died, it would have seemed
less strange and impossible, but to have seen him
and spoken to him one day, and then to feel that
they would see him and speak to him no more on
this earth, it was hard of belief.
But what was their sorrow to Mary?s ; ?they had
other ties, other interests ; and, above all, they had
nothing to reproach themselves for with regard
to Tom.
? What a quiet, grave sort of girl Mary has be-
come,? said Mrs Bertram one day. ?I wonder what
is the reason.?


?It is onlv four months, vou know, since Mr
?/ y ?/
Hinton died,? said Jane, rather indignantly.
? You don?t mean to say vou think she is still
1/ V
fretting after him. Of course he was a very nice
young man, poor fellow, hut still he was nothing
so very wonderful. Quite plain, I used to think,
at anyrate by the side of Ralph.?
?Yes, he wasn?t nearly so good looking as Ralph,?
replied Jane quietly.
? I should think not, indeed, but then I see very
few young men so handsome as our Ralph. If it
had been Ralph now??
?You wouldn?t have been surprised at Mary?s
still grieving; for him. Mother, there are other
ZD O 7
things besides a handsome face.?
O
? I?m sure, as far as that goes, he wasn?t anything
to come up to Ralph in any respect. Not,? added
Mrs Bertram, with some compunction, ?that I wish
to say one word against poor Mr Hinton, whom I
liked extremely. But I think you are quite wrong
about Mary?s still caring about him. I shouldn?t
wonder if she had some secret attachment.?
? Oh, mother! mother ! ? cried Jane, laughing,
? do, pray, give up building that little castle in
the air. Ralph will never marry Mary, and Mary
will never marrv anyone.?
?Well, I?m sure, you?ve settled all their affairs


for them out 'of hand. They ought to be very
much obliged to you.?
?I am sure Mary would be. Pray, mother, don?t
go hinting anything about secret attachments to
her.?
?As if I hadn?t more sense than that. Really,
Jane, one might think you were talking to a
baby.?
Mrs Bertram, in her annoyance, dropped two or
three stitches in her knitting, and Jane smiled as
she went to the rescue.


CHAPTER XV.
JANE BERTRAM?S STORY.
It was about a month after Mr Hinton?s death
that one afternoon, as I was standing looking out
7 o O
of the parlour window, I saw a strange man
coming up the path. He wasn?t at all what I
should call a gentleman,?a rough-looking man,
with a short grizzled beard, and a face that
seemed to tell you directly that its owner had
been used to battling with the world and had
found it hard work. He came up the path with
a quick decided step, casting a sharp look round
him at the barns in the distance on one side, and
the orchard on the other. I seemed to know in
a minute that it was someone come to see Lottie,
and I felt frightened. Supposing he should take
it into his head to settle down here and establish
himself as one of the family. With mother so
weak-minded and guided by Ralph, and Ralph


himself so infatuated, there was no knowing*
what might happen.
? We shall have the whole family over here be-
fore we?ve done,? I said to myself.
Lottie was sitting over the fire with a hook in her
hand; she was in one of her low fits, and had been
crying before dinner, I could see. Mother was
taking her afternoon nap on the sofa.
? Miss Boldero,? I said, ? I believe there is some-
one belonging to you coming up the path.?
She started up, dropping her book on the floor,
and rushed to the window where I was standing.
Then, as she could see nothing, for the man was
hidden now by the porch, she rushed off to the
front-door, I screaming after her, ?
? Take care, take care, it may be only the man
come to call for the taxes, after all.?
I was sorry, when I saw her go tearing off so, that
I had said anything, because she would be so dread-
fully disappointed if it turned out to be someone
else ; but I needn?t have been afraid.
In a few minutes Lottie came into the parlour
all smiles and tears, and presented this rough-look-
ing man to us very proudly, as ? My father.?
? Now for it,? thought I; ? I must be very firm
at first. There is nothing like it,? and the
more I looked at him, the more I saw how


necessary it was that I should be firm, very firm
indeed.
I didn?t like the look of him any better, now I
saw him closer in the room; and mother was so
frightened by him, that she told me afterwards she
? felt sure he must be a bushranger at home, he
looked so dreadfully fierce.?
He kept looking sharply at us from under his
bushy grey eyebrows, and when I went forward
to shake hands with him (as of course was only
proper, though against my wish), he didn?t seem to
understand, and took no notice of my outstretched
hand. Of course, I supposed that he had never
seen any civilised people for so long, he had for-
gotten how to behave; so I said nothing, only I
was rather surprised to see him shake hands with
mother the minute afterwards.
? Very pleased to see you, Mr Bolder�,? said
mother, still looking very frightened ; ? Lottie has
been in a sad way at not hearing from you.?
? Has she ? ? he said, looking down at Lottie with
a smile which certainly improved his face wonder-
fully, though still it was nothing much to boast of.
? Why, my girl, did you think we had all forgotten
you ? ?
? No, father. Only I wondered you didn?t
write.?


? Never do write if I can help it. I only waited
just to set two or three things going (for I have
come in for a slice of luck at last, Lottie), and then
I started off straight to come and pay these con-
nections of ours a visit. As they were so pleased
to see you, of course I felt sure they?d be glad to
see your father.?
My heart sank at his words, but I didn?t feel as
if I could talk to this man, angry as he made me,
as I had done to Lottie. As for poor mother,
she only said ? I?m sure we?re very pleased,? two
or three times over, in a bewildered sort of way.
?No occasion to say so, ma?am. I can see it
in your faces. Lottie, how long shall you take
to pack up ? The sooner we?re both out of this
place the better.?
My head seemed in a whirl. Were they really
o-oino; ?
O O
? To-night, father ? ? asked Lottie doubtfully,
and she didn?t seem so overwhelmed with delight
as she ought to have been, after all her talk.
? Yes, my girl. We?ll spend the night in London;
I?ve taken rooms. Then we?ll do a bit of sight-
seeing for a few days; then we?ll go home. Ship
starts on Saturday, and there?s someone besides
ourselves who won?t be sorry to see you back
again.?


Lottie turned very pale, and I wondered what
her father meant.
? Oh, but, Mr Boldero, you really must stay a
day or two, or at least one night,? cried mother,
her breath almost taken away by such sudden
arrangements.
I too felt that, as he did really seem to mean
what he said, we had better be as civil to him as
we could. So I said pleasantly,?
? Oh, you mustn?t take Lottie away so suddenly
as all that, Boldero.?
He just looked at me out of his fierce eyes,
(Lottie?s eyes were something like them when she
was in one of her tempers), but said never a word
to me ; to mother he said, ?
? No, thank ye, ma?am. We know English ways
and English manners too well now, to intrude
ourselves ; don?t we, Lottie ? In England, you take
your rooms and you pay for ?em ; you eat your
victuals and you pay for ?em, and everybody loves
you. If you ?aint got the money to pay for ?em,
you?ve no business to come to England; you?d
better go back to Australia, where folks are such
fools they take in strangers and treat ?em as
their own families, or rather, better, because their
own families go short sometimes, and the strangers
O ' o
don?t.?


This all sounded to me like so much gibberish;
I couldn?t understand what he was driving at;
taking in strangers, indeed, and treating them as
one?s own family, a pretty state of things that
would be. I don?t think mother hardly noticed
what he said, she was so taken up with the idea
of Lottie?s going off like this at a moment?s notice,
for I really believe she had got quite fond of
Lottie, and of course we had all got used to her
in a way. I didn?t dislike her as much as I used
to do ; in fact, I rather liked her.
? Lottie, Lottie, you don?t mean to say you?re
going off to-day ?this evening ? ?
? This afternoon,? corrected her father. ? Run
along upstairs, Lottie, and put on your tilings.
Your box, or whatever you?ve got, can come on to
you after.?
Lottie went out of the room at the sound of
those decided words, and we three were left to-
gether, all feeling very uncomfortable; at least
0 7 O v 7
1 know mother and I felt so; I don?t think Mr
Bolder� cared at all. He wouldn?t sit down,
though mother kept asking him to, but said, by
our leave, he?d stroll round our ? little farm,? and
take a look at things.
We both felt very angry with him for calling
it a ? little farm,? when it was one of the largest


in the place ; but without waiting for us to go with
him and do the honours, he marched off.
? I do hope he will come across Ralph,? said
mother nervously; ?he might poison the fowls,
or set something on fire. He looks such a desper-
ate character.?
? Oh, he?s all right, mother,? I answered crossly ;
? he?s only a very rude, rough man,? and then I
went upstairs to Lottie?s room, and found she
and Kitty crying and sobbing in each other?s
arms.
? Oh, I want to go back with you, to Australia,?
shrieked Kitty the ungrateful little minx.
? And oh, my darling, I wish I could take you,?
replied Lottie, who ought to have known better;
? but you are very happy here, Kitty; and, oh, it
is a nice place, the dear old farm I ?
Just then she caught sight of me, and got up
suddenly and turned away to pack her box.
Now, Ralph had been in my thoughts ever since
Lottie?s father had announced that he was going to
take her away that afternoon, and I didn?t know
what to do. I didn?t even know where he was, or
when he would be home, so as to let him know
what was going on.
o o
? This is very sudden, Miss Boldero,? I said, help-
ing her to tumble her things into her box, for you


couldn?t call it packing ; the things went in just
headforemost, and goodness only knows what they
would come out like.
? Yes, very sudden,? she answered, looking up at
me, with her lips trembling.
? Well, it will be delightful for you to see your
relations again.?
? Yes,? she answered, looking down into her box
again.
? We shall quite miss you,? I added, folding up a
print dress neatly, and leaving Lottie to crumple it
all up into one corner.
She laughed rather tremulously ;
?It will be a very pleasant miss, I should think.
You never have liked me, you know.?
? Maybe I was wrong there,? 1 said. ? Anyway,
I hope we shall part friends.?
? Oh, yes,? she said earnestly, ?do let us be
friends for once.? She got up and put both her
hands into mine. ? I did try to please you, but
somehow I never managed it.?
? Well, well,? I replied, ? perhaps it would be
different if we could have things over again;
which we can?t, in this world, more?s the pity.?
? No,? she said quietly; ? never again. You will
be in England, I in Australia. I don?t suppose
we shall ever even see each other again.?


? Oh, you will come back to England some day,
and pay us another visit.?
It was a foolish thing to say, but I said it.
? Xo, I shall never do that. Perhaps some day,
?when I am a sedate, middle-aged woman, I shall
come over and look at the old scenes, and see
you and Mr Ralph, both married and happy.?
? You won?t see me married,? I said sharply;
? and it ?would be a. poor chance you?d have of
finding me happy, if you did. But Ralph, of
course, will marry some day.?
? Of course,? she repeated quietly.
? And so will you,? I added, rather as an
experiment.
? Yes, I shall marry some day, when I get
home.?
I must say I was considerably taken aback at
this speech, which I hadn?t at all expected ; for
I certainly thought she had begun to like Ralph.
It put any idea I might have had of helping
her to leave any message, out of my head, and
I felt quite indignant with her : deceitful girl!
Just then mother?s voice came in at the door.
? Lottie dear, your father is in quite a fume
to be off. He says you will both miss the
train.?
Lottie was ready dressed, and the box was


nearly full ; I promised to give the finishing
strokes.
? I shall say good-bye up here,? said Lottie
hurriedly; ? father can?t bear any fuss.?
She broke down altogether as she kissed Kitty,
who howled in a wav I told her she ought to
?/ O
be ashamed of: a girl ten years old. Then Lottie
Hung her arms round mother?s neck.
? My dear child,? said mother, crying too, ? how
' 7 t/ O 7
I shall miss you. God bless you, Lottie, wherever
you are ; my child, good-bye, good-bye.?
Lottie drew herself away, and put her hand
in mine; then we leant forward and kissed each
other. She never said a word, nor did I, but
we both knew that we had forgiven each other
for all that had been amiss in the past.
? I am so sorry,? said mother, ? that Ralph
should be out of the way. He will be vexed
when he comes back and finds you gone with-
%J o
out his having said good-bye.?
o o ?/
? It doesn?t matter,? said Lottie, hardly knowing,
I believe, what she said.
Mother drew herself up, and looked rather
offended.
? Lottie 1 Lottie! ? called out her father from
below, ? are you ever coming ? ?
* O
Lottie hurried downstairs, Kitty and I follow-


ing. As I passed the little window on the land-
ing, I saw Ralph in the far distance coming leis-
urely home over the fields, with his liver-and-white
spaniel at his heels. He would never be in time.
A few more hasty words, a promise from Lottie
to write when she had got home safely (a promise
over which Mr Boldero looked very impatient),
and they were off. We?Kitty and I?stood at
the front door and watched them down the path.
It was very cold, with a cutting wind, and a leaden
sky overhead. How different from the day when
Lottie first came ; then the trees had been all green,
the sky a dazzling blue, and the roses had scented
the air. Ah, what a many changes had taken
place since then!
Lottie turned at the gate and waved her hand
to us, her father nodded his head in his surly, off-
hand way, and they were out of sight. I had to
drag Kitty in, for she was in two minds to run
after them ; and for the next ten minutes I had to
comfort her as well as I could. In the middle of
it all, I heard a step at the side-door, and Ralph
came in whistling. Kitty rushed off down the
passage.
? Oh, Uncle Ralph ! Uncle Ralph ! ?
? Hullo! what?s the matter now ? ? said Ralph.
? You?ve been getting into mischief again, I sup-


pose. Well, it?s no use coming to me; I?d no
business to have helped you last time.?
? Oh, Uncle Ralph, Cousin Lottie?s gone away,
right away back to Australia, and perhaps I
shan?t ever see her again; oh! oh! ? and Kitty
howled afresh at the idea.
I heard Ralph?s stick go bang down behind
the door, and the next moment he was in the
parlour.
?What?s all this, Jane?? he asked, in a sharp,
hard voice.
? It?s quite true, Ralph,? I said; ? Lottie?s
father came this afternoon, and carried her
straight off before we knew where we were,
hardly. We couldn?t persuade him to stay
another hour.?
? How lone - ? ? he asked.
O
? Just about a quarter of an hour ago. They
were going to take a fly up to the station, and
catch the 4.20 train to London. I was in hopes
you would have come in in time.?
He went out of the room without a word,
and I saw him go quickly down the path, and
then set off running along the road. He was
going to try and catch them at the station
before the train went off. I glanced at the
clock; would he ever do it in time ?


Mother came down.
? Wherever has Ralph gone tearing off to, as if
he had got a mad dog at his heels ? ?
? He?s gone to the station, to see if he can catch
them before the train goes.?
O
For the life of me, I couldn?t help a little smile
crossing my face.
?Very foolish,? said mother; ?people might
notice it, and fancy things. What are you
laughing at, Jane??
? Nothing, mother,? I answered, feeling a dread
ful hypocrite.
It seemed so odd and quiet when we three
sat down to tea without Lottie, and Kitty did
nothing but shed tears into her mug of milk, and
she threw her bread and butter on to the floor,
instead of eating it, and was altogether so
naughty, that I had to take her and lock her
into her bedroom for a bit; ?that generally brought
' o �/ o
her round.
Ralph came hack. He had just got into the
station as the train was moving out, he told us.
I expected to see him look very down-hearted,
after hearing this, but he didn?t look anything
of the sort. He asked where Kitty was, and on
hearing that I had locked her up, insisted upon
letting her out, and devoted himself to amusing


her and making her forget her troubles for the
rest of the evening; though I think he was rather
o 7 o
shocked to find her in uproarious spirits before
she went to bed.
Later on, when we were alone, he told me that
he had rushed up to the carriage door, and had
just had time to get their London address.
? Did you see the father ? ? I asked.
? Yes, it was he who gave me the address.
It was all done in such a hurry, that I don?t be-
lieve he had an idea of who I was, or what I
wanted it for. If I had only been one minute
more getting there, it would have been too
late.?
Ralph breathed such a fervent sigh of relief, it
nearly put the candle out.
? Then I suppose, Ralph, you will go and see
them before they start ? ?
? I shall go to-morrow
? I don?t think he?s at all a pleasant man,
Lottie?s father,? I said, for I had taken a great
dislike to him ; ? he was so rude.?
I don?t think Ralph even heard what I said.
he was so full of his own thoughts.
O
? Did she seem glad to go ? ? he asked.
? What, Lottie ? No,? I said doubtfully, for
I couldn?t make up my mind if I should tell him


something she had said or not; ? she seemed to
feel going a good deal.?
His eyes flashed, and I added quickly,?
?But, Ralph, she talked as if she were likely to
marry when she got hack. I don?t know that she
O
meant anything particular by it, hut she certainly
said something of the sort.?
Of course Ralph was in a fine way, and I had to
repeat, word for word, what she had said; and then
we went over every word separately, to see what
they each meant; and then we talked it all over
and over, till I was so sleepy I could hardly keep
my eyes open. Ralph, sitting opposite, was look-
ing as wide-awake as if it had been twelve o?clock
in the morning, instead of at night, and was as
eager and excited over it, and as ready to start off
afresh, as if we hadn?t been talking about it, till
there seemed to me nothing else to say. The last
thing he said as we parted for the night, was, ?
? I shall go to-morrow and settle it one way or
the other.?
So the next morning, he went, and before start-
ing he told mother what he was going for. It
was a great blow and shock to her, but on the
whole I was astonished to see how well she took
it, and how she hid away her disappointment and
misgivings, and sent him oft? with cheerful words


and a smiling face. Then, after he was gone, she
sat down and lamented; but she wound up with, ?
?After all, it might have been worse. Lottie
is a good girl, and I have grown very fond of her.
But, oh, Ralph might have done better.?
? After all, mother,? I said, consolingly, ? perhaps
she won?t have him now.?
? No, no, Jane, I don?t think so badly of her as
all that. Of course, poor girl, she is very fond of
him, and it must have been a great trial to her
going off like that.?
Apparently Ralph had not thought it necessary
to tell mother of his first refusal. No doubt he
was right, for I don?t think mother could ever
have forgiven Lottie for that.
The day passed so slowly, it seemed as if it
never would come to an end. We both felt rest-
less, for how could we help knowing that on this
day depended a good deal the fate of our future
lives, ?that they must be more or less affected by
what was now passing in another place. I don?t
think mother thought of much else but Ralph, and
whether he was doing what was best for his own
happiness ; but I could not help thinking of leav-
ing the old farm and all I loved so well?the
animals, the bees, the work I knew so well how
to do, and liked so much. It was no use trying


to pretend it was not a trial, and I had to pray
for patience to bear it, and to bear it cheerfully,
without letting other people see how hard it came
on me.
Five o?clock ?six o?clock?no Ralph. Mother
began to get dreadfully nervous, and to talk about
? blighted affections,? and ? broken hearts,? and
? Thames bridges,? till I began to feel uncomfort-
able too, though I knew very well there was nothing
really to be afraid of.
At last the gate clicked. I flew to the front
door, and there stood Ralph?and Lottie Boldero!
Of course I knew then, even without looking; at
Ralph?s radiant face, or Lottie?s tearful, blushing-
one, that it was all settled.
? I have come back like the bad penny,? said
Lottie, half laughing and half crying, to mother;
and then mother took her into her arms, and
Lottie became as a daughter to her from that
moment.
I never could make out how Ralph had man-
aged it all, ?to make Lottie say ? Yes,? to make
her father give his consent, but I suppose it all
came of Ralph?s being on occasions what mother
called ? so masterful.?
Some days afterwards, in looking for something-
in one of mother?s drawers, I came across quite a


little hoard of gold sovereigns. I was so surprised,
because I knew all about mother?s money matters,
and yet I couldn?t account for these sovereigns.
When Tasked her about them, mother looked rather
uncomfortable, and said hastily,?
? Oh, when you were upstairs with Lottie, Mr
Boldero brought out those sovereigns, and insisted
o o 7
\
on my taking them for Lottie?s board and lodging.
I tried to refuse, but he really was so violent I was
obliged to give way. But don?t say anything to
Ralph about it; he would be so very angry, and
would insist on our sending them back, which would
only make mischief.?
So we agreed never to mention the matter to
Ralph, only I think he must rather have wondered
at our extravagance when, soon after, mother and
I came out in such handsome bonnets that all Crag-
ford was admiring them.


CHAPTER XVI.
JAXE BERTRAM?S STORY ? Concluded.
I thought I had written down pretty well all I
wanted to say, but Kitty, who has been reading
it over, and thinks herself old enough now to
have opinions of her own, tells me I ought to
put down where we are now, and what we are
all doing to make a sort of finish. Kitty may
be rio-ht, but I would rather have left it to the
person who has written all the other chapters
except mine, as she is a deal better at such
things than I. However, as she too says I must
do it, I suppose I must.
It is seven years now since we (mother, Kitty
and I), left the farm for good. Ralph and Lottie
were wild for us to stay and make our home with
them, but mother would not hear of it, and no
doubt it was best. We did not even stay in Crag-
ford, for just then a widowed sister of mother?s


lost her only child, and mother felt it her duty
to o'� and live with her, as she so much wished it,
O '
and was so lonely. Of course Kitty and I went
with her. It was a quiet, comfortable home for
us, but it was dreadfully dull, and sometimes I
felt as if I never could stand it?l missed the
farm and all its cheerful business so badly.
Then every summer when I came back from my
annual visit to Ralph and Lottie (who made a
capital farmer?s wife), I felt it the same trouble
over agam.
I daresay it was good for me?l have no doubt
it was?to find myself a person of no importance,
?whom no one consulted, or thought much about,
but it was a hard, a bitter trial. At home, it
had always been, from mother, ?? Go and ask Miss
Jane ; ? from Ralph,?? Go and ask my sister what
she thinks about it,? and I had always been
mistress, and gloried in it. Now, I was nothing
of the sort. Aunt Sarah was an energetic sort
of person, and when she had got over her sorrow,
she did not require my help in the management
of the house at all, and I felt all abroad with no
work and no duties, so far as I could see. Of course,
occupations and duties did come after a bit. I
took to parish work, which I had never had time
for before, and soon found plenty to interest me.


I hope I did some good ?I tried to. Still, even
then, I pined after Cragford, the little village I had
been born and brought up in?my childhood?s home.
And then, suddenly, we went back again. It
was a sad thing that sent us back ; my aunt
O J */
died, and so it was no longer necessary for us
to stay away from Cragford. Ralph had looked
us out a little house, and taken it for us, before
we had had time to think about making fresh
plans. It was a very little way from the farm,
and quite close to the Fontaines? house. A
pretty little sort of cottage house it was, with a
great quantity of ivy growing over it, and a garden
very full of trees at the back; ?this garden opened
into the farm fields, as the Fontaines? did.
Oh, what happiness it was, making all the
plans and arrangements for the move; with
mother so delighted that she looked ten years
younger, and Kitty nearly wild with joy, and
I as bad, or worse, than either of them. I was
ashamed to find myself so happy so soon after
poor aunt?s death ; but oh I to find oneself home
again amongst all the old scenes, the old faces,
I could have kissed the very stones in the roads,
I loved them so.
Then there was Ralph, coming in and out
knocking up shelves for us, and hanging up


pictures; and Lottie looking scarcely a day older
(only a little more sedate, a little less impetuous),
would run in twenty times in the day, and carry
off mother to dinner or tea; or send little Ralph,
their only child, a sturdy little fellow of six, with
a cake, or something or other of her own making,
now we were so busy.
Then Mrs Fontaine would drop in, and make
some suggestions about the placing of the fur-
niture, which, if we had followed them, would
have left us no room in the little parlour to turn
ourselves round in. Mary came too, and was a
great help, so thoughtful and clever about every-
thing; whoever would have believed she could
ever have turned out such a good manager. Mrs
Fontaine had quite given up housekeeping now,
and, I must say, the house looked a sight better
under Mary?s hands.
Lewis was out in India, but Dick often ran in
after tea, and was as merry as ever, and very
useful in the garden, where he and Kitty used
?/
to work every evening, and were great friends,
though Kitty always laughed, and declared she
did all the work.
Kitty had shot up into a dark slip of a girl,
very full of life, and much too wild, as I often
told her, but she only laughed at me. Mother


spoilt her dreadfully, and always made excuses
for her, such as, ? You can?t expect old heads on
young shoulders;? and, after all, she was a dear
affectionate child, whom it was impossible for
anyone to help loving. She was very much like
Lottie, and people told me that in a few years
she would be very pretty; but I didn?t put
much faith in what they said, and took good
care that Kitty should never hear any of these
remarks.
So we have settled down, I hope for the rest
of our lives. It seemed curious at first to take
up one?s life, after seven years, and begin to live
it again in the old spot. There had been a good
many changes, of course; many old faces had
gone, many new ones come in their place ; but,
on the whole, it was astonishing to find how few
alterations there had been.
The very first day I went out of doors (except
a run down to the farm over the fields), I saw
a short, fat little figure coming hopping along
up the street. It was actually old Mr Basset,
looking wonderfully well and hearty, and as full
of gossip as ever. He seemed very pleased to see
me, and to hear that we were going to settle
down in Cragford; and he went off at last,
chuckling and saying,?


? So I was right about the Australian young lady
O o ?/
after all, my dear.?
I went on ;it was the same everywhere. There
was the baker?s daughter, with her shiny black
curls, looking out of the shop window between her
piles of loaves and the glass bottles full of sweets.
It seemed only the other day Kitty had teased me
to go in and buy her something out of those glass
o o o
bottles.
I went on, and up Friar?s Lane. There stood the
Gable Farm, bright and cheerful in the June sun-
shine ; there was the sound of laughter and chil-
dren?s voices in and about it, and I passed quickly
on. I called in at the farm on my way back.
Ralph was out, of course, busy with his men in the
hayfield; but I stayed for an hour with Lottie,
helping her with some of her duties, till I almost
fancied I had never left the farm; then I went on
home over the fields.
I had had no idea whereabouts Ralph was, and
it came across me with quite a sudden shock, when
I saw him riding about amongst his men in the
very same field I had passed through one June
afternoon, eight years ago. It seemed like a dream,
and I fully expected to see Tom Hinton come
vaulting over the stile. Still more like a dream
did it seem to see Mary coming along in the dis-
* O o


tance. I leant on the stile and watched her; it
was a different Mary from the Mary of eight years
ao-o, and yet the same. Would she remember ?
O 7 �/
When she came closer, I saw that her eyes were
full of tears, and her lips quivering ;
? Oh, Jane. Eight years ago ! eight years ago ! ?
She leant her head on the stile, and hurst into a
passion of tears. She was always so quiet now
that I had not expected such violent grief. M ell,
there are a few hearts that can never forget: hut
oh, what a few !
We walked home together, for she did not feel
inclined to go on, and I felt, when I parted from
her, that of all the changes I had seen and noticed,
this was the most wonderful. The silly, vain girl
had become a noble, earnest woman ; and I thought
what a beautiful thing it would be when Tom and
Mary met again; and how he would understand
�/ ? '
then, if he did not now, why he had died.
It was about a year after this that I went one
day to lay some flowers on Tom Hinton?s grave.
The grass was growing green on it, and the trees
oo o o
bending their branches over it; it was as quiet and
peaceful a spot as one could wish to choose for a
last resting-place. I sat there for about an hour;
there was no one in that little churchyard to dis-
turb one, and the sight of the name, Thomas


Hinton,? carved on the head-stone, had set me
thinking of all sorts of little things about him, that
I had nearly forgotten, away from Crag-ford. I
%/ O 7 ?/ O
felt it did me good to sit there in the stillness of
that summer afternoon and think of Tom, of his
faithful loye, his short life, his sudden death, and
what they had all wrought and accomplished.
I came away at last, because the bell had begun
to ring for the Wednesday evening service, and
O O
soon people would be passing through on their way
to church.
When I got home, mother called me into the
drawing-room very mysteriously, and led me to
the French windows opening into the garden.
? Well ? ? I said, rather impatiently, for I hate
mysteries, and my mind was full of poor Tom.
? I don?t see anything. There?s only Dick and
�/ o
Kitty walking in the garden, a thing I?ve seen
O O 7 O
often enough before.?
O
? All, ' said mother, ? but don?t you see anything
else ? ?
? No. Oh, good gracious ! he?s got his arm round
Kitty?s waist.?
? Yes, Jane. He came to me first very properly
and got my consent, and then he went out to
Kitty, and, I suppose, got her consent too.?
? No doubt of that,? I muttered, with my eyes


glued to the two figures; ? it?s no use mv saving
O O' ?/ ?/ O
anvthing now, as it?s all settled out of hand, but I
O
do think they?re both too young to know their own
�/ O
minds.?
I could see mother was rather frightened at
o
having to tell me the news, and ashamed to let
O J
me see how easilv Dick had got over her.
�/ O
Clever Dick 1 he had taken care to wait till
I was out of the way.
? Dick is twenty-two, and Kitty is??
? Seventeen !? I exclaimed. ? Xonsense, mother,
you ought to have known better! ? then seeing
%J O O
she looked really distressed and unhappy, I
laughed and kissed her, and told her we must
make the best of it, and no doubt it would be
all right. Dick was a nice, good-tempered, true-
hearted fellow, and I liked him very much.
? Just what I think,? said mother, much re-
lieved ; ? and, Jane, do you know, he always re-
minds me of your favourite, Tom Hinton.?
? All ! ? I said. Her words seemed to give me
a sharp pain at my heart. While I had been
dreaming of dead hopes, and a love long gone
by, there had been fresh hopes budding, and a
new love rising up. So it will ever be, I suppose,
as long as the world lasts ; and as I watched the
O '
two figures, walking no doubt in a sort of Eden


of their own, my eyes became dim with sudden
tears, and I only saw them through a mist, as
I said softly, under my breath, ?
? God bless them, and make their love as
true and faithful as that of Mary and of
m �
lorn.
