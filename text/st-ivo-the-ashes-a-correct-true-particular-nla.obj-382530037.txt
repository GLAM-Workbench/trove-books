PREFACE.
In submitting this little brochure to the consideration of that portion
of the English and Australian public who take an interest in cricket,
we would ask for a kind reception and not a close criticism.
The sketches are the facta similia (though reduced by the kind aid of
Mr. Noone, of the Survey Department, under the photolithographic
process) of a series of pen and ink sketches made during the progress of
the matches in Australia. They excited considerable interest at the
time, and it occurred to the artist and the author—then visiting in
Melbourne, that the series, accompanied by a humorous but a correct
description, would find a favorable reception among cricketers through-
out the British Empire.
To our friends in the colonies and to such of our old comrades as
may be in any part of the Queen’s Dominions we dedicate our little
venture.

St. IVO ABD the ASHES.
SOW ARDS the close of the English Cricket Season of 1882, the
Australian Eleven, under the captaincy of Mr. W. L. Murdoch,
I put a set” on home cricketers, and created dismay in English
cricketing circles by defeating the “ Gentlemen of England, a
picked team of whom had a crushing dose of gruel administered
f to them at the Kennington Oval. With 33 runs only to get to
win, seven of the best bats in England failed to score more than
26, leaving the Australians winners by seven runs.
The London Sportsman took a gloomy (not to say funereal) view of
the affair, and in its columns, subsequently, published an In Memoriam
“to the ashes of English cricket, which found their last resting-place
on Kennington Oval.” The Sportsman’s idea evidently was that there
was no more “ cricket on the (H)earth,” as far as England was con-
cerned, and the loss of the (H)ashes put the staff into various stews.
The Australian Cricket Season saw the arrival in the antipodes of
the Hon. Ivo Bligh and his team, who have since won such golden
opinions from all classes in all the colonies they visited during their
tour.
In replying to the toast of ‘‘ The English Team, on his arrival in
Melbourne, Mr. Bligh humorously declared that he and his eleven had
come to “beard the kangaroo in his den, and try to recover those ashes. ”
How far he succeeded in the attempt the accompanying sketches will,
it is hoped, fairly and impartially show.
It is not my intention, in this little brochure, to go into the question
as to whether the English team was or was not the best that could have
been got together. Whether the inclusion of TJlyett, Lucas, Grace, and
Hornby would have been more conducive to the success of the ashes
expedition, is beside the question. The fact remains that the team, as
was fully proved, was an uncommonly good one, including first-class
exponents of every department of the game; and in spite of the absence
from their ranks of the great G., they managed to ingraciate them-
selves with all colonists with whom they came in contact.


The First and Second Contests.
The first of the three tussels with Murdoch’s Eleven resulted in an
undeniable defeat for the crusaders; the Lion was hopped round so
skilfully by the agile marsupial that the latter scored a win by nine
wickets.
St. Ivo and his knights, no doubt considering a change of air would
be beneficial, then took a tour in Tasmania, beating a Northern and
Southern Eighteen in the “ tight little island,” and returned to Victoria
like giants refreshed to once more grapple with Captain Murdoch and
his victorious followers.
Whether it was owing to the Tasmanian climate, the bright eyes of
the Insular ladies (unsurpassed in any portion of the globe), the ex-
treme soundness of the beer brewed in the locality, or all three
causes combined, deponent sayeth not ; but it is certain that on
January 19th, 20th, and 22nd the seekers after the “ashes” were all in
tip-top form full of pluck, confidence, and determination, each man to
do his level best. Add to this that the spectators were thoroughly
impartial in their applause, the lion coming in for as good a shar'e as
the whelps; and it will be seen the only other adjacent to real good
sport was the kind consideration of the “clerk of the weather.”
It must be confessed, however, that this meteorological functionary
like Mrs. Prig in discussing the contents of Mrs. Gamp’s teapot—did
not quite “ act fair.”
St. Ivo’s lucky shilling (or copper) won the toss, and the crusaders
went to bat on a grand wicket, in grand weather, encouraged by the
presence of a a grand assemblage of spectators.
Barlow, the Lancashire stonewaller, partnered by the crack Cambridge
bat, 0. T. Studd, led off j and to show there was no desire on either of
their parts to outstrip the other, each made 14, and each also
condescended to let Palmer take their wickets—not the first
record, by the way, where Crusaders have been euchred by a Palmer
Leslie and Steel, the dark blue and the light, held their ground most
stubbornly, threes coming to the former as easily as though he were a
second Euclid busily engaged in manufacturing triangles, while Steel
whose preference for would seem to show he is not a marryiim
man, would occasionally go in for double blessedness by cutting a tw(T
and drove one four which was not “in hand” of any fieldsman. The
light blue at length succumbed to M'Donnell, who held a catch which
was Gxffen off the South Australian trundler; and Leslie, after runninc.
up a score of 54, finished by running up himself to the wicket iust too
late. It IS said that “he who runs may read,” a proverb, the monotony
ot which was varied on this occasion by the Surrey crack, who clearly,
demonstrated that “he who is Read may run,” which he did most
effectually to the tune of 75, Palmer eventually palming a catch off his
own bowling Barnes, apparently, was not the representative of
noughts (Notts) on this occasion, for he insisted on compiling 32 before

his wicket was Gvffen away to hecome the property of the South Aus-
tralian. Then the game bore the appearance for a short time of being
played on the Oval, for St. Ivo and Tylecote succeeded in hatching each
a duck. The Yorkshire tyke, however, showed his objection to an
omelette diet by speedily smashing his egg, and made a will ere
his demise, on which the personalty was over the half hundred, the
scoring-board showing 55 pro Bates. (N.B. —This requires thinking
over, but it will amply repay perusal.) The initials of the younger
Studd must have signified Go Back on this occasion, as he soon retired
to the pavilion clean bowled for 1, without letting Morley get his
mawleys on the ball. The sundries amounted to 10 (got in divers
ways), and the total of the innings reached the formidable number
of 294.
Palmer and Giffen “scooped the pool” in bowling honours, the
Victorian getting five wickets, and the Adelaide man four. Blackham
Murdoch, and Giffen shared the honours of missing Read, one miss to
each being on record; and Barnes should have been run out, but he
wasn’t, but got two extra runs in instead. “ Infelix,” in the Australasian,
naively remarked that “ the worst feature about the fielding of our men
was their inability to hold the catches.” Well, this may be a Felix or
Infelix remark, but you can bet odds any day that the “inability
to hold the catches” is undoubtedly the very “ worst feature” of a
fieldsman.
Those two Sydney cracks, Massie and Bannerman, first wielded the
willow for Australia, the former retiring—bowled by Barlow—only
when 43 had been amassied to his credit. The stonewaller “ held the
fort” for a long time against all comers, till a ball from the Yorkshire-
man, Bates, downed his defence, and he followed H. H. M. to the pavilion.
Murdoch filled the gap, with Horan, the captain evidently bent on
taking up a permanent residence at the wicket. Not so the Jolimonter ;
he retired, caught by the Yorkshire tyke off his own bowling, for 3.
Giffen arrived on the scene, only to receive his quietus from the
inexorable North County trundler, while the giant Bonner—just to
vary the last comer’s luck—obligingly got caught off his first ball,
instead of bowled. Bates thereby did the “hat trick”; and the score
of the Australians began to look as blank as their faces. Barnes, not
wishing all the bowling honours to fall to Bates, kindly dismissed Black-
ham for 5 ; and the irrepressible Yorkshireman clean bowled the next
three men —Garrett (for 10), Palmer (for 7), and Spofforth, for that
article of hen manufacture which is so acceptable on a well-ordered
breakfast-table, provided it is like Osesar’s wife—above suspicion.
Murdoch, the dauntless, carried out his bat for 19, and the innings
closed for 114, Bates securing seven wickets for 28 runs. Murdoch
stopped at the wickets two hours and more for his 19, giving two very
hard chances—one to Tylecote, and one to Steel—neither of which were
accepted. During the Australian innings the “ clerk of the weather”
behaved badly, the light being very bad; and the Antipodean batsmen
got the same favor from him in their second attempt. With 180 behind,
Murdoch and Bannerman went to the wickets with the forlorn hope of
saving a one innings defeat. That horrid Yorkshireman, however, was


about again, and got the Australian captain for 17, clean bowling him
with a ‘‘ caution,” while the little stonewaller put a ball into Ivo’s
hands at point. “ I vowed I’d hold it” said the English captain, as
Alick went back to the pavilion on urgent private affairs. Blackham
scored 6, and was clean bowled by Barlow, who was evidently jealous
of the honour of Lancashire in the trundling department. Bonner hit
hard and straight, and played good cricket, retiring at length for 34,
caught by Morley off Barlow, Horan being caught by the same fieldsman
off Bates for 15. The Yorkshire crack clean bowled M‘Donnell for 13 ;
and it was pretty evident that in this match at least those “ ashes” were
not so firmly planted in Australian soil. Massie, after scoring 10, fell
a victim to Barlow, being well caught by 0. T. Studd, and joined the
melancholy prosession to the paviiion. Ivo caught Giffen off Bates for
19, and Barnes secured Garrett off the same bowler for 6. G. B. Studd
made a splendid catch off Bates’ bowling, thereby sending Palmer to
the right-about with 4, and upsetting Spofforth’s apple-cart, who retired
not out 14—three 4’s and a double. Total of innings, 153, the “ashes’
being recovered by the infliction on the Australians of a one innings
defeat, and 27 runs to spare. Australia, despondent; England, radiantly
jubilant, and great enthusiasm all round. Ivo and his comrades were
called to the front, and enthusiastically cheered. The two captains
made speeches of condolence and congratulation. Champagne flowed,
and everything was jolly and “up to the knocker.” Murdoch con-
gratulated the winners, and hoped the result would be reversed in
Sydney. If Ivo hoped so too, he did not express himself to that effect,
and the rival teams went home to dinner.
The Convincing Match.
The Lion and the agile Kangaroo were now “ one all” in the fight
for the “ashes,” the former more eager than ever to follow up his victory;
the latter on his mettle to avert a second defeat. Both sides determined
to do their level best, and both carried out their determination. It was
as far as merits went—six of one, and half-a-dozen of the other—when
lo ! that mysteriously disposed “ clerk of the weather” went over to the
Englishmen, and put his casting vote in their favour.
That lucky coin of St. Ivo’s proved its utility once more, and the
crusaders went first to the wickets, which were in splendid condition,
the weather everything that could be desired, and the light just suited
for scoring.
C. T. Studd and Barlow, as usual, showed the way, the former studying
the bowling to such good purpose that he soon compiled 21, when
Blackham caught him off Garrett. Barlow put together 28 for the
honour of Lancashire, and then obligingly hit Spoflorth into Murdoch’s
tenacious grip, and followed the Cantab crack to the pavilion. Leslie,
the tower of batting strength of the eleven, went sorrowfully in the
same direction a disappointed conchologist, with a shell —an egg shell—


in his possession, which he had failed to crack. Steel made (or stole)
17, when one of Garrett’s “ so softly o’er him stealing, relegated him to
seclusion and reverie. Barnes was sacrificed for 2, Blackham catching
him off Spofibrth, Now came the stand. Read and Tylecote got
together, and looked as though the partnership was going to be a “ lifer.”
Every bowler was tried in succession, but only with the result of a
quickly increasing score. Between them they made 132 runs, each
dying for 66. Read was caught by Massie off Bannerman, and the
English wicket-keeper was run out. The Yorkshire bowler made 19,
when he was caught by M‘Donnell off Spofibrth. G. B. Studd scored 3,
and was clean bowled by Palmer, who performed the same kind office
by the English captain, after the latter had scored 13. Morley carried
his bat out for 2, and the first innings of the crusaders closed for the
capital total of 247.
During the night “Jupiter Pluvius” made matters lively by drenching
the wickets thoroughly, and the morning of the second day dawned
bleak and dismal. The hopes of Australian sympathisers, like the
wickets, were considerably damped; and the clouds looked as black as
their chances. However, “ faint heart never dried a wet cricket ground,”
so Giffen, accompanied by little Bannerman, strode to their posts, deter-
mined to “do or die.” Little Alick felt that “Australia this day
expected every man to do his duty,” and, for once in his life, opened his
shoulders, and hit as vigorously as Bonnor himself, causing the crusaders
to expand their under lips pretty considerably. Giffen, too, played
slashing cricket, and when the latter was disposed of—by a smart piece
of stumping by Tylecote—7 6 runs had been totalled, of which the South
Australian had scored 41. Captain Murdoch now joined Bannerman,
but did not seem to like the bowling at all. Just after the century
appeared on the board, the elements combined to sluice all the players
back to the pavilion, whence they did not emerge until past five o’clock.
When the stumps were drawn for the day, Australia had lost one wicket
for 133 runs, Bannerman being not out, with 68 to his credit. This
performance, on such a sodden wicket, was a truly memorable one; and
the plucky little batsman was warmly applauded. All Saturday night,
and all Sunday the rain came down; and, by the appearance of the
weather, it seemed probable that the match would have to be played
out in canoes. Monday, however, dawned bright and fine, the wicket
being soft and spongy. Murdoch left the partnership first, being given
out leg before wicket to Steel. M‘Donnell, who succeeded, was clean
bowled by the Cantab for a “ duck’s egg,” and Horan filled the gap.
Bannerman’s time came next, he being caught by Bates off" Morley, and
retired with 94 to his credit, amidst a storm of applause, in which the
Englishmen heartily joined. Massie came—and went, caught splendidly
at point by the English captain, after scoring a single. Bonnor was
magnificently caught by G. B. Studd off' Morley, without adding to the
score, 6—0—173 ; and the Lion rustled his mane, while the Kangaroo
walked round with subdued tail. Horan next retired, caught by Steel
off Morley, for 19. Garrett came in, and, accepting a “ duck’s egg,”
retired. Palmer and Blackham then fetched the score to 210, when the
former was caught by G. B. Studd off Barnes, and vanished with 7 to


liis credit. Spofforth arrived in time to see Blackham clean bowled by
Barlow, for a well played 27 ; and the Australian innings closed for 218,
or 29 behind the crusaders.
Leslie and C. T. Studd started the second innings of the Englishmen,
the latter scoring 8, and the former 25. The ground was too sticky for
heavy scoring; the only other double figures in this innings being
Barlow 24, Read 21, and Captain Ivo (not out) 17, the total score
being 123.
On the morning of the fourth day, with 153 to get to win, a hot sun
glowing overhead, and a “ baked” wicket, Giffen and Bannerman led
the van. GifFen was bowled for 11, and the stonewaller well caught at
point for 5. Murdoch was caught for a “ duck’s egg,” and the “ ashes”
floated loosely on Australian soil. Then Horan was run out for 8, and
Massie caught for 11. Six wickets for 33 runs; and “all Lombard-
street to a China orange” that the “ ashes” were recovered. Blackham
and Bonner pulled the score up to 56, when Barlow scattered the
“ giant’s” timbers. Spofforth filled the gap, and, with the score at 72,
put one into Steel’s hands, and sought the inner recesses of the pavilion.
Barlow next bowled Blackham for 26, and Garrett for a “duck’s egg,”
Palmer carrying his bat out for 2 ; and the match was over, won by
the Englishmen by 69 runs.
The Englishmen tugged the longest, and the Lion, harnessed to a car
containing the sacred ashes, galloped gaily in the direction of his native
country.
Ivo Bligh’s Eleven v. Combined Australia.
So the battle for the “ ashes” was over, and oncie more the English-
men had regained their lost supremacy in the cricket field. Neither
Lion nor Kangaroo, however, was satisfied, apparently. The latter con-
sidered he had been unfairly dealt with by the “ clerk of the weather
and the former, in the elation of his victory, “ offered one more chance”
against a more representative Australian Eleven. Massie, M‘Donnell,
and Garrett gave place to Midwinter, Evans, and Boyle ; and the dates
fixed for the “ one more chance ” to come off were February 17th., 19th.,
and 20th., and the place the Association Ground at Sydney.
Again that lucky coin of the English captain’s turned up “trumps,
and the crusaders went first to the wickets, C. T. Studd and Barlow
being the pioneers of the team. Midwinter secured the latter’s wicket
he being caught by Murdoch at point after scoring 2. Leslie joined
Studd, and the rival University representatives both began run-getting
at a fair rate, until the Oxford man was caught in the slips by Bonner
olf Boyle, and retired for 17. Steel joined Studd, and the partnership
was not dissolved until 110 appeared on the board, when Studd was
run out for a fine innings of 48. Read arrived on the scene, and left
shortly after, being caught by Bonner off Boyle, after scoring 11.
Tylecote came, and was clean bowled by Boyle for 5 ; and Barnes quickly
retired, dismissed by a “ corker” from the “ demon,” having only added
2to the score. Bates added 9, and was magnificently caught by Bonner.

Then forth strode the captain, amid a storm of applause. He put on
19, when Palmer bowled him with a leg break. G. B. Studd took his
place; Steel all this while scoring as though batting was his own inven-
tion. Studd, after scoring 3, was run out, and the stumps drawn for
the day. On resuming on the second day, Morley was clean bowled by
Palmer without scoring, and the innings closed for 263, Steel carrying
out his bat for the grand score of 135.
Bonnor and Bannerman—the long and the short of it—led off for
the Australians. After scoring 10 the “ little un” had to go, caught
by Barlow off Morley ; and Murdoch, who took his place, was clean
bowled by the Lancashire professional for the—by no means coveted—
egg. Horan came, scored 4, and retired, caught by G. B. Studd off
Morley. Giffen, who was lame, came to the crease, having Murdoch to
run for him. After scoring 27, the Adelaide man was caught by the
übiquitous G. B. Studd. Meanwhile Bonner had been scoring rapidly,
and missed repeatedly. Steel, Barlow, and Read having each let him
off; and the board showed 4 —27—113. Midwinter was clean bowled
by Barlow, after scoring 10. Blackham joined Bonnor, and between
them the score rose to 160, when the “ giant” was at length caught by
Barlow, after scoring 87. Palmer retired for nothing, caught by Bligh
off Steel; and Evans arrived. Blackham was at length clean bowled
by Bates for 57, and Boyle and Evans carried the score up to 248,
when the stumps were drawn. Boyle was caught by G. B. Studd off
Barlow on the third day, and the Australians’ innings closed for 262 ;
Evans (not out), 22, the total being just one short of the English score.
Limited space forbids dwelling too long on the second innings of the
two teams. Bates made top score for the crusaders, with 48 (not out);
0. T. Studd, 31 ; Steel, 21; Barlow and Barnes, 20 a-piece, and Leslie,
19. The innings closed for 197, leaving the Australians 199 to get to win.
The Australians’ second innings commenced in anything but a pro-
pitious manner, their first three wickets (Murdoch, Bonnor, and Horan)
falling for 51. Giffen and Bannerman, however, got together, and
brought the score up to 107, when the latter was caught by Bligh at
point, after putting together 63 in a masterly manner. Blackham, the
indomitable, then joined Giffen, and when the latter was stumped by
Tylecote, the board showed 5—32 —162. Evans joined Blackham, but
was caught by Leslie off Steel for 0. Midwinter came to the Victorian
wicket-keeper’s assistance, the winning hit being by the latter
within a few minutes of time being called, Australia winning by four
wickets, amid tremendous cheering.
Once more the “ ashes,” like Mahomet’s coffin, were neither in one
place nor the other. The Lion, in full career, laroke his harness, and
the cart was upset. It remained for Victoria to show where their final
resting-place should be fixed
And the joy was great in the Marsupial Gamp. The father of all the
Kangaroos stood on his head, while the family turned various summersaults.
A learned graduate, who was on the ground, became inspired.
Speaking in the ancient Latin tongue, he exclaimed —
Qualia prospiciens, catulus ferit oethera risUt
Ipsaque trans lunce cornua vacca salit.


Victoria Victrix.
Contrary to general expectation the match in Sydney proved to be
the last played between the Englishmen and a representative Australian
Eleven. The general wish was to play a return match in Melbourne,
but owing to various causes it could not be brought about. Victoria,
however, was all there, and the crusaders wound out their campaign by
playing Eleven of Victoria. Six of the original Australian Eleven took
part in the play, the “ new blood” being supplied by Scott, Midwinter,
Turner, M‘Shane and Cooper. W. H. Cooper captained the team, and
handled his forces so well that I can only say this —If our volunteer
officers handled their men half as well we might perhaps see some of
that “ superior intelligence” we hear so much about.
Friday, the 9th day of March, in the year 1883, saw the start of the
match. St. Ivo and his lucky coin had evidently fallen out, for the
English captain lost the toss, and Victoria went to the wickets.
Percy M‘Donnell and swarthy Blackham led the way. The great
keeper of the Australian sticks scored a single and was run out, Bonnor
taking his place. The giant soon lost Percy, who was caught by Bates
off Barnes. Then Scott joined the “ big un,” and soon made things
lively. Scott played a capital innings for 29, when he was smartly
caught at the wickets by Tylecote off Barlow. Tommy Horan ran up
37 before he was bowled by Barnes. The “ giant” rattled up 54, and
was caught at the wickets by the übiquitous Tylecote. Midwinter
played all through the innings, and carried out his bat for 92, great
regret being expressed that he had not the chance of reaching three
figures. M'Shane justified his selection by making 27, and Turner put
18 together in an artistic manner. Palmer, Boyle and Cooper made
respectively 3, 4 and 1, and the innings closed for 284. Victorians
jubilant.
Then ensued the most astounding event of the whole of the tour.
C. T. Studd and Tylecote went to the wickets to the bowling of W. H
Cooper and Palmer. Tylecote made a pretty cut for 3, and then found
to his astonishment that Cooper had bowled him. The insinuating
Victorian captain had given his ball instructions to make a flank move-
ment, and, though apparently first wide to leg, it changed front rapidly
from the pitch, and caused panic in Tylecote’s timber yard. I—4—s
was the record; English sympathisers astounded, and Victorians as
cocky as possible. Bates, the sturdy Yorkshireman, went on only to
be clean bowled by a Yorker from Palmer, and the doughty Leslie
succumbed, leg before wicket, to the same bowler, also for a “duck.”
Steel succeeded, and soon put 11 together, when the wriggling Cooper
went round him like his namesake round the cask, and found a way to
his wicket, 4—11—25, and the best of the English wickets down —bar
one. W. W. Bead was caught by Midwinter off Cooper for 7. Studd
was shortly after bowled by Cooper for 11, and Barlow and Barnes got
together Barnes soon put 11 together, and then Barlow ran him out.
7—11—42, and the elements showed their grief by coming down so


heavily that play was stopped for the day. On the last day of the match
the wicket was bad and the weather sulky, the result being that the
whole of the English team were out for 55. They followed on, and,
playing on a horrible wicket, managed to put together 156, Steel contri-
buting 76 by slashing cricket; Barlow 27, and Bates 21 Victoria won
the match in one innings and 73 runs to spare.
The lion, slightly dejected and greatly disappointed, lay down,
“ beaten, but by no means disgraced,”
In the dead of night, in a secluded corner of the M.C,C, ground, the
lion mournfully buried the ashes, a few kangaroos looking sympa-
thisingly on. The head-stone of the tomb is shaped from a broken bat,
on which is the following inscription :
Ci Git
The Sacred Ashes,
AWAITING
FOE A TIME
The Regaining of Supremacy
English Cricket,
N.B,—None of Murdoch’s Eleven need apply.
Then the crusaders turned homewards, the lion loth to depart,
dragging at his chain as though he would fain try conclusions with the
marsupial once again. On the strand the lion regards intently a broken
bat, “ What will they say in England The asks with a sigh, and then
reluctantly embarks.
The crusade is over. The ashes are the property of aye, there’s
the rub. Who owns them ? Not Murdoch’s men They are out of it.
Equally clear the crusaders have not made out their title. If the
property of anyone, I fancy that Victoria should in equity be allowed
to hold them for the present.
Ivo Bligh, you well did try,
You’d two successful nicks ;
Now it’s done,
Victoria’s won,
Got the two odd tricks.
Hi, Ivo ! Ho, Ivo !
Speed the parting guest;
Australians tell you did right well.
Tried your level best.
Ivo Bligh, Murdoch’s eye
Is fairly out of joint ;
You ’gainst W. L,
Did really well.
And fairly scored a point.
Hi, Ivo ! Ho, Ivo ! the ashes linger still ;
Who the ui’n
Will overturn
Depends on future shill.
