and nothing but a few huts remained to remind one that a
tow n had ’ever been planned there. These great fluctua-
tions of population are a remarkable feature in the growth
of the colonies ;* they are of course most frequent in the
mining districts, where they are caused by the rush of the
people to every newly discovered goid-neld. Whenever
such rushes take place, townships arise with wonderful
rapidity, generally to disappear as rapidly, as soon as the
report of some rich find in another part of the country
causes the abandonment of the gold-field by the majority
of those interested in it.
27. The rule followed in the classification of the towns
and villages and of the rural parts, was to take the Govern-
ment boundaries whenever practicable, enumerating the
suburban population separately. But towns or villages j
although without any official defined boundaries, wore
nevertheless to be considered as being part of the urban
population of the colony; and the number of inhabitants
within their approximate limits,These having been carefully
determined, was to be returned as the population of the
town or village*.
In arriving at the # numbers # of the;, urban population;
of the colony, lowns and villages containing less than 109
_ inhabitants have been disregarded, mqfs of them being
■composed—-only in nol”quite such a scattered state—of a
\population following the same rural pursuits as in th©
surrounding country districts, ■'therefore, the fifth seri©
of t|he tables, which is devoted to “ towns and villages,”
gives information only about towns or villages containing l
ICO inhabitants or over* Separate mention is made, how-
Kvtr/m other parts of’the work, of many localities with a
•so} ulation of less than* 100 persons, aud ; all particulars re *!
lating to their’statistics’ are given; for although not now
ejasaed as towns ©r villages, they will probably rise in im-
portance, when the information hero given will be found
useful in tracing their growth.
28. The whole of the’ suburbs of Sydney comprised iff
the metropolitan, policedistrict are. included in the urban
population. Id 1861 the same course was not followed ; aj
large portion of the suburban districts was added to the
rural population, and this mode pf dividing
a fleeted re turns. In order to allow of a comparison
being drawn between the two periods, it has been necessary
to makp put fresh for 1861 on the same basis
as the one adopted on the present occasion.
Of the total population of New South Wales in 187 L
there were 234,162 persons in towns or villages, 267,417
in the rural parts, and 2402 on board the ships, boats,
barges, &c., in the ports, harbours, or other waters of the
colony. Thus, out of every 10,000 of the population,
4046 persons lived in towns, and 5306 in th© country. In
1861, for every 10,000 persons, there were living in towns
(including all the suburbs of Sydney) 4549, and in the
country 5396, the proportion of urban and rural popula-;
tion being pretty nearly the same for the two periods, with
a slight difference in favour of the towns in 1871.
Comparing the sexes, we find the disproportion naturally
greater in the rural parts, although it is gradually becom-
ing less apparent. Thus, in 1861, 80,449 or 40 53 per cent,
of the male pepulation were in the towns, aiid 116*197, or
58*54 per cent, in the country, against 79,18 L
or 51*96 per cent, of the female population in the towns,'
and 73,123 or 47*99 per cent, in the country. In 1871, the
numbers are, for the males, 117,513 or 42*64 per cent, in the
towns, 155,680 or 66 50 per-cent, in the country, and for tho
females 116,649 or 51*06 per cent, in the towns, and 111,73/
or 48-92 per cent, in the country; or, leaving out the decir
mals, the following table will show more clearly the con-j
tiast between the two periods:—

Of the 234,162 persons composing the urban population
in 1871, 134,736, or 26*73 per cent of the total population
of the colony, formed the population of Sydney and the
suburbs. 99,426, or 19*73 of the total population of the
colony, were in the country towns and villages. i
Leaving out tho metropolis, there were enumerated in
1871 166 towns and villages containing 100 inhabitants or
more, with an aggregate population of 99,426 persons. In
1861 there were 106 towns and villages so enumerated, with
a population of 65,944 persons, giving an increase for the.
dtcennial period of 61 towus and villages, with an
additional urban population of 33,482 persons. Thus, for
oveiy 10,000 of the population, there were in the country j
towns and villages 1973 persons in 1871, against 1879 in
1861. Towards the total increase of the population in the-
ae< esmial period, they contributed at the rate of 2187 in
every 10,000.
Taking the sexes separately, we have in 1871, for every-
-10.000 of the male population, 1895 in country towns and ‘
villages, against 1764 in 1861; and for every 10,000 of the
.enisle popula ion, 2066 in 1871, againpt 2029 in 1861. The
■•contribution towards the general increase of population in
i a e decennial period being for the males 2232 in ever?
10 000, and for the females 2140 in every 10,000.
Ihe progress towards the equalization of sexes since the
y ar 1861 will be still better illustrated by the following ;
rtOl : Sydney and suburbs, 10,0* o—males 4849, females;
5151; towns and villages ol 100 inhabitants and over, 10,000
males 5311, females 4689; total urban, 10,000 —males 50 40,
females 4960; total rural, 10,000—males 6138, fern ales
5862. 1871: Sydney and suburbs, 10,000 —males 4815.
females 5155; towns and villages of 100 inhabitants and
over 10,000 —males 5253, females 4747; total urban, 10,000
- males 5018, females 4982; total rural, 10,000 males
5821, females 4179.
In 1861, there were for every 10,000 males 9842 females
in the urban and 6293 in the rural parts. In 1871 tht |
numbers had increased to 9926 for the towns, &c., and 717 b i
for the country.
29. Table No. 12 shows the progress of our principal
towns, viz., those containing a population of over 1000 per-
sons. The most important after Sydney is Newcastle, with
7581 inhabitants; then Parramatta, with 6103; West!
Maitland, 5079; Bathurst, 5030 ; Goulburn, 4453; Graf-
ton, 2250. Of these, Newcastle has made by far the most
rapid strides since 1861, her population having increased
at the rate of 10*37 per cent, annually. On the!
other hand, Parramatta increased at the rate of!
0-94 per cent, per annum only; and if we were to?
leave out the asylums, orphan schools, &c., which go *
far towards swelling her population, and the number off
whose inmates increases in proportion to the total increase
of the colony, we should have an actual decrease in her *
Lumbers during the last ten years.*
The largest increase of urban population will be found to ■
have taken place in the towns of Wagga Wagga, Orange
Muswellbrook, and Tamworth, which progessed at th*
annual rates of 19*63 percent., 15 06 per cent., 13*12 pei
< ent., and 13*10 per cent, respectively ; while the numbers
for East Maitland, West Maitland, and Windsor show a very
material falling off; the decrease being at the rates of o‘B7
per cent., I*oB per cent., and 0.88 per cent, annually. This
retrograde movement is explained by the impoverished state
of the surrounding districts, caused chiefly by the floods to
which they are exposed.
30. The town of Sydney, within the corporate boun-
daries, contained in 1871 a population of 74,423 persons,
consisting of 36,149 males and 38,274 females. In 1861
the total population was 56,394, consisting of 27,285 males
29,109 females; the numerical increase in the inter-
vening period being 8864 males and 9165 females, or 18,029
persons. The rate of increase was very nearly the same
for both sexes, 3.25 per cent, annually for the males, 3*16
I; ®r cent, for the females, or an average of 3*20 per cent
for the total population.
This is a marked improvement on tbe returns for 1861,
when the rush to the Victorian mines between the years
1856-1861 had caused such a drain on our metropolitan
population that the annual rate of increase during the pre-
ceding quinquennial period was only o*7 per cent, for the
males, I*s per cent, for the females, and 1.2 per cent, for
the total population.
The proportion of sexes in the city of Sydney is pretty
evenly maintained from year to ye r, although it is of
course to some extent affected by the gradu il disappear-
ance of the disproportion of their relative numbers in the
rural districts. Thus, while in 1861 there were in the
town for every 10,000 persons 4866 males and 5134 females,
or a proportion of 10,551 females to every 10,000 males, m
1871 we have f-r every 10,000 persons males and 5039
females, or a proportion of 10,156 females to every 10,000
males.
The following table, showing the progress of the town
since the year 1828, will be found interesting

The population of the suburbs has very largely increased
since 1861, when it was in the aggregate 36,846 only, con-
sisting of' 17,768 iiiales and 19,078 females. The addi-
tion in the decennial period was therefore 63*72 ner
cent., or 64.06 per cent, to the males, and 63*42
per cent, to the females. The annual rate of increase—
-6*37 per cent. —is nearly double that of the town. And
this is only natural. The limits of the city are now far too
narrow to give abodes to all to whom she affords a living,
so that the proportion of those who reside out of town is
necessarily increasing yearly ; and the rate of increase will
be found to become greater as that of the town itself be-
comes more settled.
The highest suburban rate of increase is in the Redfern
and Botany District, 88*34 per cent, in the ten years, the
numbers having increased from 6701 in 1861 to r 12,62l iu
1871. In the Concord, St. George, and St. Leonards
Districts, which are farther from Hie City, the rates of in-
crease are the lowest, being 49 i 0 per cent., 49-42 per
cent., and 48 45 per cent, respectively, for the decennial
period.
1 Taking the town and suburbs together, the population of
Sydney in 1871 was 134,736 persons, consisting of 65,286
males and 69,460 females In 1861 the numbers were
98,686 persons, consisting of 45,425 males and 48,261
females, and the numerical increase in the decennial period
was for the males 19,861, for the females 21,189, or 41,060
for both sexes, being an addition of 43*72 per cent, for the
males, 4390 per cent, for the females, or 43*82 percent,
together.
33. Most of the population composing the Metropolitan
district has been incorporated under the Municipalities
Act. The town itself constitutes tho Municipal City of
Sydney, and in the suburbs there were in 1871 no less th m
nineteen municipalities,' containing together 49,962 persons,
out of a total population of 60,324.
There were altogether in New South Wales, at tho
Census of 1871, forty-nine municipalities, with a popula-
tion of 192,181; while in 1861 there were only twenty-four
municipalities, with a population of 102,476 : the increase
in the decennial period being represented by twenty-five
municipalities and 89,706 persons
In 1861, for every 10,000 of the population, there were
2921 persons within municipal boundaries, and 7079 in un-
incorporated localities. In 1871 the municipalities con-
tained 8813 persons in every 10,000, against 6187 in other
parts. Again, taking the total increase of population in
the decade, we find that for every 10,000 of the increase,
6858 was contributed by the municipalities, and 4142 by the
unincorpora l ed parts ot the colony.
34. The Municipality of Sydney, being identical with
the town, requires no special reference here. It will be
sufficient to indicate in the following table the population
of the several wards and their progress since 1861.

The above return shows how unevenly the population of
ihe different parts of the city has progressed since 1861
The tendency of the city to spread out towards the east is
illustrated by the large addition to the numbers of the
people in Macquarie and Cook Wards, where the increase
m the decade was 76 05 and 77*72 per cent.; while in
Bourke and Brisbane Wards, representing the older and
more thickly populated parts of the town, the increase was
comparatively very small, 2*02 and 15*31 per cent., re-
spectively.
35. The distribution of the people in this country cannot
be better shown ban by a comparison between what were
formerly the settled counties and the pastoral districts,
ihe twenty counties, forming previously to 1861 the more
-etiled portion ol the colony, and composed chiefly, as al-
ieady stand, of the agricultural and mining districts, have
since received the accession of portions of five counties—
viz., Buccleugh, Cowley, Gordon, Harden, and Lincoln,
ncluding these, there were in 1871, for what may be
termed the first-class districts, a population numbering
>76,583, or ?4 72 per cent. »f the total population of the
colony, end 1z7,398 persons, or 25‘28 per cent., for tbe pas-
toial districts.. In IbOl the numbers were, for the twenty
< ounties, 283,375,* or 80*77 per cent, of the population, and
lor the pastoral districts 67,485, or 19*23 per cent, of
ihe population The progress of the outlying dis-
tricts is here clearly marked. The addition to the popu-
lation of the counties between the years-1861 and 1871
was 83*79-per cent., or at the rate of 3*38 per cent,
annually. The population of the pastoral districts had in
ihe meantime increas* d by 8877 per cent., or at the rate of
8 88 pei cent, annually.
Taking ihe sexes separately, we find that in 1861, of the
total male population, 151,595 or 76*37 per cent, were in
•he counties, ai d 4b.893 or 23 63 per cent, in the pastoral
districts. In 1871 there were 198,813 or 72*15 per cent, of
the male population in the counties, and 76,737 or 27*85
per cent, in the pastoral districts. Of the total female
population, there were in 1861 129,870 or 85 23 per cent, in
ihe counties, and 22,602 or 14*77 per cent, in the pastoral
districts; and in 1871, 177,769 or 77*82 per cent, in the
counties, and 50,661 or 22*18 per cent, in the pastoral dis-
tricts.
Tbe rate of increase in the decennial period was, in the
counties, pretty equal for both sexes, 31*15 per cent, for
the males, and 36 88 per cent, for the females; but in the
pastoral districts the rale for the males was 70*33 per cent.,
and for the females over 125*82 per cent. This large ex-
cess in the increas-e of the female population bears out what
has already been said about steady progress in the
equalization of the sexes in the less settled district.
This is again illustrated in table No. 8, which gives the
proportion of the sexes in the counties and in the pastoral
districts, at the two periods of 1861 and 1871. In 1861
there were in the counties, for every 10,000 persons, 5386
u ales and 4614 females, and in 1871, 5279 males and 4721
females, or 8941 females for every 10,000 males in 1871,
against 8566 in 1861. In the pastoral districts the numbers
w eie, for every 10,000 persons in 1861, 6675 males and 3325
females, and in 1871, 6023 males and 3977 females. So
that in 1871 there were in the pastoral districts 6602 females
to every 10,01*0 males, against 4979 only in 1861.
The progress of some of the counties since 1861 has been
veiy marked. County Phillip, the centre of the western
mining districts, increased in the decennial period by 282*26
per cent, of its population, the addition to th© males being
341*49 per cent., and to the females 199*27 per cent. In
county Grorgiana the increase was 127*92 per cent.; 107*38
per cent, for the males and 167*34 per cent, for the females.
Oh the other hand, county Camden, whose population has
been greatly thinned lately I y the exodus of small settlers,
attracted to other parts by the greater advantages offered by
free selection, shows an actual decrease of the male popula-
tion of 3.35 per cent, for the period, and the total rate of
inert ase for both sexes was only I*6o per cent. In the
county Cumberland the increase was almost *at the same
rate ae in the City of Sydney, 34*07 per cent, for the
period, and the proportion of sexes in 1871 was 10*068
females to every 10,000 males, against 10.2*23 in 1861.
'i he comparison between the two periods is more difficult
for the pastoral districts, on account of the difference of
* Including, for the sake of compariso? c shipping, which
was loft out m tho returns for 1861.
Between the years 1836 and 1861, the intervening periods
are all quinquennial. 1861-71 is the only decennial
period.
'l'he population of the metropolis, however, does not con-
sist only oi (Lo.-e living in the town ot Sydney proper. It
includes also the numbers of those residing in the suburbs,
who, though not within the city boundaries, must be prac-
tically looked upon as forming part of her population.
111. These suburbs, with the city of-Sydney, compose the
metropolitan police district. Their aggregate population is
60.324 persons, of which 29,148 are males- and 31,176
females. They are divided into eight districts (Registry),

38. In the detailed titles having reference to the ages of
the people, the units of population will be found tabulated
for each year of age up to zl, after which they are grouped
in periods of five years up to 80, the last three columns
being devoted to persons between 80 and 100 years of age,
to centenarians, and to those whose ages were not specified.
In (ho special summary tables the grouping of "persons
under 20 has been condensed into quinquennial periods.
39. Following the plan adopted in 1861, we will first
divide the population into three distinct groups of age,
classing as children all those under 15 years,-—as adults,
representing the effective strength of the community, those
between 15 and 65 years of age,—and as non-effective
adults, those over the age of 65.
Of the 603,981 persons forming the population in 1871,
210,183, or 41-71 per cent., were children under 15,
* 283,087, or 66-17 per cent., were adults between the ages
ol 16 and 66, and 10,711, or 2-12 per cent., werq over, 65
years of age.
In 1861, 133,221, or 3?-97 per cent, of the population
were children under 15, 212,843, or 60’72 per cent., were l
adults between 15 and 65 years of age, and 4796, or 1-31
per cent., were over 65.
The increase in the decennial period was, therefore,
76,962, or 67'77 per cent, of their numbers, for children
under 16 years of age, 70,244; or 33'CO per cent., for adults
between 15 and 65, and 6915, or 128-38 per cent., for persons
over 66.
Assuming the numbers of those under 15 and over 65
years of age to represent the section of the population de-
pending upon others for support, and taking the remainder
t.s the class embracing the self-supporting and those who
support others,—we have in 1871, for every 10,000 of the
population, 5620 effective to 4380 non-effective persons,
against 6076 effective to 3930 non-effective in 1861.
In England, where the self-supporting classes are taken
to be between the ages of 20 and 60, their proportion to the
numbers depending upon others for support remains pretty
constant. In 1851 there were, for every 10,000 of the
population, 5230 persons depending upon the remaining
4770 for maintenance. In 1861 the numbers were 5240
and 4760 respectively.
Ihe proportionately large decrease in the numbers of our
effective population should, it need hardly be pointed out,
not be taken as showing a diminution of our producing
power, but simply as instancing the tendency of this ooun-
n T —yearly increasing with its growth—of approaching in
ibis respect the standard of Great Britain.
It does not folloWj because the proportion of those rely-
mg upon others for support has so largely increased since
1861, that there should be, therefore, a decrease in the
number of those capable of supporting them. The inference
to be drawn is merely that, as the colony grows older and the
sexes become more equal, causing a corresponding increase
m the number of marriages, so each adult has the care of
more who are dependent on him for support; and 1 the same
person upon w hom two others depended in 1861, would
in 1871 have to support nearly four persons.
40. Looking next at each sex separately, we have in 1871
out of a total male population of 275,551, 106,615, or 38*69
per cent, of the whole number, under 15 years of age;
161,664, or 58*67 per cent., between the ages of 15 and 65 ;
and 7282, or 2*62 per cent, over 65 years of age. In 1861
the percentage of the male population was, for children
under 15, 33*78 ; for those between the ages of 15 and 65,
64*55, and for those over 65 years of age, 1*67.
Of the total female population, numbering 228,430 in
1871,103,568, or 45*34 per cent, were under 15 ; 121,433,
or 63*16 per cent., w*ere between the ages of 16 and 65 ; and
3429, or I*6o per cent., were over 65 years of age. In 1861,
the percentage was 43*43 for children under 15, 65 60 for
those between 15 and 65, and 0'97 for those over 65 years
of age.
41. Taking the proportion of one sexto the other, w©
find that in 1871, for every 10,000 of the active class, 5710
were males and 4290 females, and for every 10,000 of the
remainder of the population, 5156 were males and 4844
females ; whilst in 1861, for every 10,000 of the active
class, there were 6019 males and 3981 females, or nearly
twice the number of males : and for every 10,000 of the
remainder, there were 5099 males and 4901 females.
Thus, while the proportion of sexes of the children and
aged does not materially differ at the two periods, the main-
taining class, which in 1861 numbered nearly two males to
every female, in 1871 only numbered five males to every
four fe males. This illustrates very clearly the theory that
the disproportion of sexes on the one hand, and the differ-
ence in the numbers of the effective and non-effective
classes on tho other, disappear on'a par.
42. A noticeable increase will be found to have taken place
since 1861 in the numbers of those over 6o years of age.
Between the ages of sixty-five and seventy there were
4850 persons in 1871, against 2189 in 1861, an addition to
the numbers of 2661 or 121-56 per cent, in the decade.
Between the ages of seventy and seventy-five, there were
3609 persons in 1871,'f gainst 1466 in 1861, giving a numer
rical increase of 2143 or 146*18 per cent, in the period.
Between seventy-five and eighty, 1275 persons were re-
turned in 1871, against 614 in 1861, the increase of 661 be-
ing at the rate of 107*65 per cent.; and over eighty, there
were 977 persons in 1871, against 527 in 1861, giving an
increas© of 250, or 85*39 per cent.
43. With regard to persons of a reputed age of 100 years
and more, the information given requires careful scrutiny.
We have little documentary evidence in this country of the
* Including, 'as in 1661, the unspecified ages.

*i It should bo mentioned, however, that as, through an
oversight in the compilation, the corresponding tables for
1861 were not classified by ages, no comparison can bo
- drawn between the two periods, except as regards the general
I results.
J 48. This is the first occasion on which, in inquiring into
j the social state of the community, the Chinese element has
not been left out. It must be admitted that the time
has arrived when the Chinese should be regarded
j as forming part of our settled population]; for
although the nomadic habits of many of them, still remain
a unchanged, the number of those who are settling in our

I obtained about them was, with the assistance of the inter-
preters, very complete,
q* The figures that are given hereafL-r must
g taken to refer to the whole of our specified population.
U 40. Comparing, first, the general results of this Census
with those of tno preceding one.
We find that, in JB7l, of the total population of 503,981,
there were* 336,770 pefsoaa, or 68'82 pe'r cent, unmarried.
160,692 or 29-90 per cent, married, and 1019 or 3'28 per
cent, widowed.
In 1861 there were 231,152 persons, or 65-88 per cent, of
the population unmarried, 109,188 or 31-12 per cout married,
and 10,620 or 3-00 per cent widowed.
The unmarried therefore increased in tho period by
105,618 or 45-69 per cent of their numbers, the married by
41,604 or 38-01 percent., and the widowed by 5999 or 57-02
per cent.
The proportion of tho unmarried to the total population
increased in the period by 0-94 per cent., that of tho
married, on the contrary, decreased by 1-22 per cent, and
that of the widowed increased, by 0-28 per cent. ’’
50. This increase in the proportion of the unmarried is
not to be attributed to a proportionate decrease iu the num-
ber of marriages. The per-centage of increase of our adult
population has already been shown to have bean smaller
the two years 1861-1871 than in the preceding period,
while that of the children was correspondingly larger.
And if we deduct from the number of unmarried the
youthful element, we shall find that tho proportion of tho
unmarried—that is, of the bachelors and spinsters—has de-
creased since 1861.
Leaving out, therefore, for the males all under 20 years
of age, and for the females all under 16, we are left with a
total unmarried population numbering 74,133 in 1831, a ai
104,486 in 1871, and with a percentage of the total popula-
tion of 21*13 in 1861 and 20*73 iu 1871, or a decrease of
o'4o per cent, in the period.
51. Of the 150,692 persons returned as married in 1871,
76,810 were males and 74,882 females, so that there were
928 husbands whose wives were not in New South Wales
when the Census was taken.
In 1861 there were 55,679 husbands and 53,509 wives,
I the excess of husbands being 2170, so that a large number
of wives whose husbands had probably preceded them in
this country to prepare a home for them and their families
had joined them since 1861, coming from the neighbouring
colonies or from Europe.
In England, on the contrary, the number of wives pre-
dominates. In 1861, for instance, there were nearly 70,000
husbands, or about 2 per cent, of their total number, absent
from the country, most of whom were seamen.
52. The addition to our married population in the period
1861-1871 was 20,131 or 34-36 per cent, to the males, aud
21,373 or 59*94 per cent, to the females.
53. Of the 16,519 widowed persons in 1871, 6730 were
males and 9789 females. In 1861 there were 4781 males
and 5739 females ; the females exceeding the males by
958 in 1861, and by 3069 in 1871.
The increase in the ten years was 1949 or 40*98 per cent,
to the number of widowers, and 4050 or 70*57 per cent, to
the number of widows.
Here then, as well as in England, the chances of re-
marrying are far greater for widowers than for widows.
54. Tho proportion of the married to the widowed was,
in 1861, 1160 husbands to 100 widowers, 930 wives to 100
widows; and in 1871, 1270 husbands to 100 widowers, and
760 wives to 100 widows. In England the proportion is
about five wives to one widow.
I regret that the incompleteness of the returns for 1861
will notallow me to extend this inquiry to the progress of the
married* widowed, and unmarried, in the last decade, at
different periods of age, which would be necessary to
render the information complete.
66. The following summarizes the proportion of sexes
of the three social classes in 1861 and 1871 :
1861 : Unmarried, 10,600 ; males, 5971 ; females, 4029.
Married, 10,000 ; males, 5099 ; females, 4901. Widowed,
10;C00 ; males, 4545 ; females, 5455.
18/1 : Unmarried, 10,000; males, 5731 ; females, 4269.
Married, 10,000; males, 5031; females, 4969. Widowed
10.000 ; males, 4074 ; females, 6926.
So that there were in 1861, of tbe unmarried, 6747
females to every 10,000 males; of the married, 9610
temales to every 10,000 males; and of the widowed, 12,004
females to every 10,000 males; while in 1871 the unmarried
were in the proportion of 7448 females to every 10,000
males; the married, in the proportion of 9878 females to
every 10,000 males; and the widowed, in the proportion of
14,545 females to every 10,000 males.
66. Passing now to the returns for 1871, and taking first
the unmarried, we find that of their total number, 210,182
are under 15, and 125,569 were aged 15 and upwards.
Of th© 210,182 persons under 15 years of age, 106,615 or
50*73 per cent, are males, and 103,667 or 49*27 per cent,
females. Of the 125,569 persons aged 15 and upwards,
85,614 or 68*18 per cent, are males, and 39,955 or 31*82 per
cent, females. Under the age of 15 there are 9714 unmar-
ried females to every 10,000 unmarried males ; above that
age, 4690 unmarried females to every 10,000 unmarried
males.
57. Deducting the males under 20 years of age and th©
females under 16, we have in the colony 64,620 bachelors
and 39,966 spinsters, or a proportion of 6183 spinsters to
every 10,000 bachelors.
The proportion of unmarried females to unmarried male©
decreases with age. Thus the proportion is—
* Including at both periods the unspecified, who, in 1861, were
chiefly Chinese, and may therefore reasonably be included amongst
the unmarried.
In tbe tables for 1871, however, the unspecified fairly repre-
sent the three classes—married, unmarried, and widowed, and
should be left out comparison is drawn with future results.

aged 16 and more, 1 only is under 15. There were 75,810
males and 74,881 females at the age of 15 and upwards.
The 1 under 15 is a female. Between the ages of 15 and
20, there are 71 married males and 1479 married females.
At the ago of 20-21 there are 145 married males and 1289
married females. Above that age, the proportion of married
females to married males goes on decreasing, as the follow-
ing will show: —
Years of ago. Wives. Hnsbands.

Pjsnch; of these, 11 are females and 1 is a male. Between
the ages of 20 and 30 there were 736 widowed, namely 157
males and 679 females.
The proportion of widows to widowers decreases with
age. Thus, between
20 and 21 the proportion is 7000 widows to 1000 widowers.

number of unmarried, married, and widowed, at different
periods of age

61. Table No. 45 gives, at three different periods of age,
the per-centagc of the unmarried, married, and widowed, in
the urban and rural parts of the colony. In the towns and
villages, the per-centage of unmarried is 64*16, of married
31 *6O, and of widowed 4*09. In the country it is 68*74 un-
married, 28*48 married, and 2*67 widowed.
Of the male population, 66*35 per cent, are unmarried,
30*78 per cent, married, and 2*61 per cent, widowed, in the
towns or villages; and 72*29 per cent, unmarried, 26*13
pci cen:. married, and 2*33 per cent, widowed in the
country.
Of the female population, 61*92 per cent, are unmarried,
32*42 per cent, married, and 6*60 per cent, widowed, in the
towns and villages; and 63*78 per cent, unmarried, 33*1 i
per cent, married, and 2*91 per cent, widowed, in the rura
parts. NATIONALITY.
62. The population of New South Wales, whose pro-
gress mainly depends upon immigration from various part«
of the world, is necessarily one of mixed nationality. It
is therefore a matter of great importance to trace th
growth of its component parts, and to ascertain the rela *
tivc importance of the native-born, and of the other
elements of which its numbers are constituted.
63. The inquiry under the head of nationality extends
into two parts, the one requiring a division of the people
into British and foreign subjects, and the other a distinc-
tion of the countries in which they were bom.
64. Taking first the subject ©f allegiance,—we find that
of the 603,981 persons enumerated on the 2nd April, 1871,
484,762 were British subjects, viz., 481,857 by birth, and
2906 by parentage or naturalization, and 17,770 were
foreign subjects.
Of the British subjects, 259,489 were males and 225,273
females. Of the foreign subjects, 16,026 were males and
2746 females.
There were, in addition to these, 983 aborigines forming
part of the settled population, of whom 709 were males ana
274 females; and 466 persons of unspecified nationality, of
whom 328 were males and 138 females.
Taking only the people whose nationality was stated, it
would appear that 96*28 per cent, of the population were
British, and 3*63 per cent, foreign subjects. Of the males,
94 28 per cent, were British, and 6*46 per cent, foreign; of
the females, 98*68 per cent were British, and I*2o per
cent, foreign.
66. The sexes of the British subjects are comparatively
equal—63s3 males and 4647 females in every 10,000 per-
sons, or 0 proportion of 8682 females to every 10,000 males;
but there is a great disparity of numbers to be noted in the
sexes ot foreign subjects, or whom there were 8455 males
and 1545 females in every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of
1827 females only to every 10,000 males.
I am not able to compare the above results with those of
the preceding Census, when no corresponding return appears
to have been framed; but a contrast between the numbers
of different birth-places, at the two epochs, will be suffi-
cient to indicate the progress of the different nationalities in
the decennial period.
66. The population of New South Wales may be classed
under three principal heads—the Australian-born*, the na-
tives of Great Britain or other parts of the British
Dominions, and those born in foreign countries, including
such as, being* naturalised, enjoy all the rights of the
British subject.
There were in New South Wales, in 1871,308,673 persons
born in the Australian colonies, of whom 294,244 were
natives of this colony; 174,167 persons born in Great
Britain or British Possessions; and 20,775 born in foreign
countries, or at sea; forming, with 466 persons of un-
specified birth-places, the total population.
67. Taking the specified only, 61*30 per cent, of the
people wore Australian-born; 34*59 per cent, were bom in
Great Britain or in British Dependencies, and 4*ll per cent,
in foreign countries or at sea.
In 1861, the per-centage of Australian-born was 47*14, of
persons born in Great Britain or in British dependencies,
46*30, and of persons bom in foreign countries or at sea, 6*56.
68. Thus, while in 1861 the Australian-born only
alightly outnumbered others of British blood, they now
stand to them in the proportion of nearly two to one.
Taking the total increase of the population in the decade,
we find that to every 10,000 of the increase the Australian-
born contributed 9359, and others of British blood only
789, whilst the foreign element showed a decrease of 148
in every 10,000.
That the proportion in which the natives stand to the
total population should augment from year to year is only
to be expected, as their numbers, if compared with the
other elements of which the population is composed, in-
crease in the same proportion as the natural increase of
the population bears to the migratory increase. Even if
the rate of immigration had been kept np in the last decade,
the proportion of the natives, swelled by the numbers of
the children bom of immigrants in the decennial period
would still have been greater than in 1861. But it would
have been far less than it actually is; and it is therefore
doubtful whether, considering the causes to which it is to
be attributed, this large preponderance of the native
clement is a matter for congratulation. That it will de-
crease again, as soon as the immigration movement is
population, for Wales; 18,222, or 6*21 per cent, of the
population, for Scotland; and 64,829, or 16*67 per cent., for
Ireland.
The addition to the numbers of the English-born in the
decennial period was very small, 3182, or only 3*78 per
cent. To the Welsh, 492 persons, or 36*70 per cent, of
their numbers, were added; to the Scotch, 1819, or 9* 98 per
cent, of their numbers; to the Irish, 8114, or 14*79
per cent.
70. The proportion in which the British-born stood to
the total population decreased between the years 1861-1871
by 6*69 per cent, for England, o*o2 per cent, for Wales,
1*23 per cent, for Scotland, and 3*17 per cent, for Ireland.
71. Of the 20,676 persons born in foreign countries. 1340
or 0*27 per cent, of the population were from the United
States, 891 or o*lB per cent, of the population from France,
and 6623 or 1*32 per cent, of the population from Ger-
many.
3n 1861 the numbers were 1067 or o*3l per cent pf the
population for the States, 690 or o*2o per cent, for France,
and 6467 or 1*66 per cent, for Germany.
The addition to the numbers in the decade was therefore
273 or 26*68 per cent, for the Americans, 20JI or 29*13 per
cent, for the French, 1166 or 21*14 per cent, for the
Germans ; and the proportion which each country stood to
our population decrease! in the same period by o*o4 for the
States, o*o2 per cent, for France, and 0*24 per cent, for
Germany.
72. The numbers of the Chinese, which in 1861 were
12.988, or 3*71 per cent, of the population, had fallen in
1871 to 7220, or 1*43 per cent. They had therefore decreased
in the intervening period by 6768, or 44*41 per cent.
73. Taking the males and females separately, we see that
the proportion of sexes of all BriUsh-bom was kept well up
in the period 1861-1871, with a slight difference in 1871 in
favour of the females. Thus, for every 10,000 persons bom
in the British Empire, there were 6346 males and 4655
females in 1871, against 6427 males and 4573 females in
1861, which gives a proportion of 8425 females to every
10,060 males in 1861, and of 8708 in 1871.
The Australian-born show a great equality of sexes at
both periods, the natives of New South Wales numbering
80,106 males and 80,192 females in 1861, and 147,877 males
and 116,367 females in 1871. For the whole of the Aus-
tralian Colonies there were 82,548 males and 82,444 females
in 1861, and 166,734 males and 162,939 females in 1871.
The proportion of sexes for the Australian-born was
therefore, in 1861, 6003 males and 4997 females in every
10.000 persons, or a proportion of 9987 females to every
10.000 males; and in 1871, 6046 males and 4996 females in
every 10,000 persons, or a proportion of 9820 females to
every 10,000 males. And for the natives of New South
Wales it was 4997 males and 6003 females, or a propor-
tion of 10,011 females to every 10,000 males in 1861, and
6026 males and 4974 females, or a proportion of 9828
females to every 10,000 males in 1871.
The English-bom show a decrease in the proportion of
females, from 6829 females to every 10,000 males in 1861,
to 6689 in 1871; the Scotch, from 6566 in 1861, to 6609 in
1871; the Irish, from 9869 in 1861, to 9716 in 1871 ; the
Welsh, on the contrary, show a slight increase, from 6109
females to every 10,000 males in 1861, to 6141 in 1871.
From foreign countries the number of females arriving in
this colony is, in proportion to that of males, very small.
From France and Germany it has considerably decreased
since 1861. Prom the United States it has slightly im-
proved. From the States there were in 1861, ♦1777, and in
1871, 2407 females to every 10,000 males. From France,
the proportion had fallen from 3346 females to every 10,000
males in 1861, to 2306 in 1871. And from Germany it was
4473 in 1871, against 5228 in 1861.
74. Tables 27 and 28 give for the year 1871 the per-cent- ;
age of the total population, and the proportion of sexes of
persons of different birth-places, in the urban and in the
rural parts of New South Wales.
76. The proportion of the native-born is larger in the
country than in the towns. Thus, 66*76 per cent, of the
urban population and 60*36 per cent, of the rural were
natives of this colony.
The centres of population naturally afford a wider field*
for enterprise and speculation, consequently offering greater,
attractions to new comers, so that there are in the country
a number of localities in which small congregations of
people are settled and find the means of earning a livelihood,
but which have not yet succeeded in drawing much of the
element supplied by immigration, depending entirely for
progress upon the natural increase of tneir numbers.
76. 19*42 per cent, of the urban, and 16*30 per cent, of
the rural population, were English-bom ; o*3o per cent, of
the urban, and 0 43 per cent, of the rural, Welsh ; 3 76 per
cent of the urban, and 4 09 per cent, of the rural, Scotch; and
13*27 per cent, of the urban, and 11*87 per cent, of the
rural Irish.
77. 2*07 per cent of the urban population, and 4*86 per
cent, of the rural, were returned as bom in foreign countries,
or at sea ; of which the Chinese contribute o*6l per cent,
in the towns, and 2*16 per cent in the country.
RELIGION.
78. It is not my intention to dwell at any length upon
this part of the returns.
A great many people here, as well as in Great Britain,
strongly object to be questioned on the subject of their
religious belief. At home, in fact, Parliament has since
1866 refused to sanction the inquiry; and although pro-*
vision is made in our Census Act for obtaining the informa-
tion, it was determined to allow the filling up of the column
devoted to “ Religion ” to be optional, the collectors being
instructed to be very careful not to press for particulars.
Therefore, notwithstanding that the majority of the
people did not hesitate to answer the inquiry, the number
of those who refused or omitted to do so amounted to
654 6 persons, or I*lB per cent, of the population, and the
information is necessarily incomplete.
For this reason I did not feel justified in classifying
the different returns, such, for instance, as the social con-
dition or the education of the people in connection with the
religious denominations ; nor did I consider it requisite to
enter into the particulars of the numerous subdivisions of
some of the religious sects, but have been content with a
careful grouping of those whose religion was stated with
respect to the denominations predominating in this colony.
79. The principal roots will be found tabulated under
two heads, called, respectively, for convenience, Pro-
testants and Catholics. The former embracing, in addition
to the Church of England, such sects as acknowledge
themselves as Protestants, as well as those who, without
further specifying the sect to which they belonged, simply
returned themselves as Protestants. The latter comprising
Roman Catholics, and those who return themselves as Catho-
lics, with no other explanation of their religious creed.
X should explain, however, that before adopting this mode
of classification, the enumerators of the different Census
districts were written to on the subject; and their answers,
gathered from the explanations of the collectors employed
by them, satisfied me that in most cases when the terms
“Protestants” and “Catholics” were used they intended
to mean “ Church of England ” and “ Roman Catholics ”
respectively.
80. Of the 603,981 persons enumerated in 1871, 339,392,
or 67*34 per cent, of the population belonged to the different
sects professing Protestantism, 147,627 or 29*29 per cent,
of Ihe population were returned as Catholics, 2395 or o*4B
per cent, as Hebrews, 1166 or 0*23 per cent, as belonging
to other persuasions, and 7455 or I*4B per cent, as Pagans.
In addition to these, 6946 persons, or I*lB per cent, of the
population, omitted or refused to supply the information.
In 1861 the Protestants numbered 233,606 or 66*58 per
cent, of the population; the Catholics, 99,193, or 28*27 per
cent.; the Hebrews, 1759 or 0.50 per cent.; other and un-
specified persuasions. 3393 or 0*97 per cent., and the
Pagans, 12.909 or 3*68 per cent, of the population.
81. The addition to the numbers in the intervening
period was 105,786 or 45*28 per cent, for the Protestants,
48,434 or 48*83 per cent, for the Catholics, 636 or 36*15 per
cent, for the Hebrews.
The Pagans, composed chiefly of the Chinese popula-
tion, decreased in the same period by 6464, or 42*25 per
cent, of their numbers.
82. In 1871 those embodied under the head of Protestants
comprised 229,243 persons or 45*49 per cent, of the popula-
tion belonging to the Church of England ; 49,122 persons
or 9*76 per cent, of the population returned as Presby-
terians ; 36,276 or 7*20 per cent, as Wesleyan Methodists ;
3291 or 0*66 per cent, as other Methodists; 9253 or I*B3 per
cent., as Congregationalists ; 4161, or o*B2 percent., as
Baptists ; 849, or o*l7 per cent., as Unitarians. In addi-
tion to the above, 4669 persons, or 0*92 per cant, of the popu-
lation, belonged to other sects coming under the general
head of Protestants, including Lutherans, who, I regret to
say, were not enumerated separately, and 2549 persons, or
o*6l per cent, of the population were returned as Pro-
testants, with no other specification.
In 1861 159,958 persons or 45*59 per cent, of the popula-
tion belonged to the Church of England ; 34,692 or 9*89
per cent, of the population were returned as Presbyterians;
the Methodists (with no subdivision) numbering 23,682,
or 6*75 per cent, of the population; the Congregationalists,
6411, or 1*64 per cent. ; and all other Protestants
enumerated together, 9863, or 2*Bl per cent, of the
population.
83. The most noticeable progress in the decade is shown
by the Congregationalists, whose numbers were increased
by 3842, or 71*00 per cent. After them come the Methodists,
with an addition in the period of 15,884, or 67*07 per cent,
of their numbers. Then the Church of England, with an
increase of 69,286, or 43*31 per cent.; and the Presby-
terians, 14,430, or 41*69 per cent.
84. Of the 147,627 persons relumed in 1871 as “ Catho
lies,” or 28*95 per cent, of the population,
Roman Catholics ; 1695, or 0*34 per cent., gave themselves
as “ Catholics,” without further explanation.
The latter were not separately enumerated in 1861
Leaving them out in 1871, we have an addition to (he num
bers of the Roman Catholics of 46,739 or 47*12 per cent, in
the decennial period.
86. Taking the principal classifications only,
