HISTORY

To His Excellency

THIS WORK

Parliament House, Adelaide


P R E FAC E.
His Excellency the Governor of South Australia, Lord Tennyson, at a meeting of the
South Australian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society held in June,
expressed regret at the “ non-existence of any proper history of South Australia.
Anticipating such a complaint the publishers had arranged at an earlier date foi issuing a
work, entitled “Adelaide and Vicinity,” which they believe will supply the want referred
to by His Excellency.
The compilation of a history involves much reading and patient research in older
that the statements made may be based upon well-attested authorities and not mere
hearsay ; and, further, the opinions expressed by the' editor must be void of personal bias
and prejudice. In both these essentials “Adelaide and \ icinity will be found un fait
accompli , and as such may be taken as an authentic record of the early endeavors, sturdy
struggles, and patient perseverance of the pioneers of the Province during its childhood,
of the agricultural achievements, commercial courage, exploring enterprise, legislatixe
labors, and pastoral progress during its youth; and of the indefatigable industry, gieat
generositv, financial failures, rapid recoveries, and enduring energy of its earh manhood.
O' 1
An apology is clue to the subscribers for the length of time that has elapsed
since their support was promised to the work ; but the delay is due to a combination of
circumstances over which the Publishers had no control. The character of the work has
not suffered, inasmuch as it has been brought up to date, and appropriately desciibes the
period of South Australian history from its birth as a British province undei King
William IV., and its gradual growth under the benign reign of Queen \ ictona, to its
entrance as a State into the Commonwealth of Australia under King Edward Vll.
An acknowledgment is due to those who so willingly afforded means for
procuring, as well as in giving, information, and for the loan of pictures and photographs
for purposes of illustration. Besides those named in the List of Illustrations on
pages xi-xv., special mention is made of the Government Statist, Mr. L. Id. Sholl, and
his officers; the Surveyor-General, Mr. W. Strawbridge, and his officers ; the Under-
Treasurer, Mr. T. Gill ; the town clerks of the city and suburban municipalities, the
board of Governors of the Public Library and Art Gallery; and the proprietors ot the
Register and Advertiser.

CHAPTER 1
THE FORERUNNERS
Navigation and colonisation —Pieter Nuyts—The “Vianen” —Dutch, French, and English—Flinders and his story —■
Sturt and his exploits—Barker and his tragic death —Whalers Aborigines
§0 M E three or four centuries ago a change came over the general
policy of European monarchs and statesmen. By the discovery
\ of America- to use the graphic generalisation of Canning —a
" new world was brought into being to restore the balance of
I the old. An impulse was given to maritime adventure, and
dazzling reports of new countries, teeming with fabulous
< wealth, fired the public imagination. There was no scruple
about the expropriation of the territories that were visited, the
conquest of the inhabitants, and the acquisition of their
treasures. A colonising era began, which has' lasted with
K ~' : - - ~~ intermissions until the present time. Spain, Holland, and
England threw themselves heartily into this enterprise, and
eventually began to fight with one another in the distant lands that were exploited. France
also entered the field, and founded new settlements. Most of these colonies were
established on military lines, which are not by any means the best for nation-building.
Every colonising nation by turns made the mistake of putting military first and colonists
second.
As this did not absorb all their energy, adventurous spirits set out to discover
other lands. As an incidental circumstance of their voyages, they fought all whom they
met : thus the Spaniards had rich colonies in the West Indies, and in South America;
and English navigators, having obtained letters of marque, and fired with an invincible
o o ' o 1
hatred of everything Spanish, took on themselves the character of freebooters or buccaneers


and robbed the enemy s ships. Nowadays these same buccaneers would stand a good
chance of being dealt with as pirates.
Ihe Dutch did less of fighting and more of exploring than the others. It was a
fixed opinion among certain learned men of those and previous days that there was a very
large continent in the southern seas ; they argued from their knowledge of the extent of
land in the Northern Hemisphere, and concluded that in order to balance the globe, there
must be a corresponding area of land in the Southern Hemisphere. The Dutch sailed
south and planted colonies in some of the East Indian Islands. They also skirted the
northern coast ot Australia, and from its extent rightly judged that they had discovered
the (jicat South Land\ which seemed to them a country scarcely worth occupying. The
boats crews that put ashore found scant fresh water, few wild beasts, and no vegetable
products of any value to replenish their ships stores ; and as the more ignorant people
consistently believed that all unknown or newly-discovered lands were inhabited by monstrous
anthropophagi, or man-eaters, no effort was made to establish colonies upon the Terra
Australis until near the close of the seventeenth century. It was then made, not by the
Dutch, but by the English.
England had utilised her American colonies as convict stations, but the War of
Independence had taken away from her this outlet for her criminal population. Another
had therefore to be found. The colonising idea in this matter was altogether subsidiary
to that of convict settlement. Viscount Sydney, a clever though indolent statesman, had a
map of world put before him, and he cast his eyes over it. He knew that the situation
at home was becoming desperate. Prisons were plentiful ; they were also run cheaply, and
were calculated to kill off all but the most able-bodied among the criminals. Still they
were inconveniently crowded, and something must be done to relieve them ; transportation
was the great desideratum. Captain Cook had lately described the beauty and fertility of
Botany Bay on the eastern coast of New Holland ; the land was a no-man’s-land ; it was
far enough away from everywhere to make it reasonably safe to conclude that the expatriated
criminals could hardly, in the bounds of human possibility, return home to commit fresh
crimes ; Botany Bay was the place.
Captain Phillip, a naval officer, a man of no great natural gifts, but of a generous
and humane disposition, was placed in charge, and founded the convict settlement in 1788.
It was his hope that the convicts might be reformed and made into settlers when their
sentences expired. After enough of them to do the strictly pioneering work had been
liberated the authorities considered that it might be possible to introduce a free population.
Captain Phillip wanted a few free immigrants introduced immediately, but he was overruled
and so it was provided that grants of land might be given to soldiers, marines, guards’
and prisoners of exemplary conduct, and that the men and women still in bond might be
assigned to them as servants. The convict settlement was proclaimed the colony of New
South Wales, and the proclamation described it as all that portion of New Holland east
of the 129 th meridian of east longitude.


Early governors had enough to do in prison work, in internal administration, and
in the exploration of the region adjacent to the principal settlement, to take up all their
time. The examination of the interior, together with the survey of the more remote
coastline, was therefore largely dependent on the enterprise of energetic settlers and
officers. In this manner a good deal of the country east of the Blue Mountains, and the
eastern and southern coastline, was examined before the eighteenth century closed.
A new impulse towards colonisation now arose. In the first quarter of the
nineteenth century English statesmen feared that France was casting hungry eyes on New
Holland. People had begun to realise that this country was fit for something more than
a receptacle for the human rubbish of the old world. Points of vantage were hastily seized
and occupied in the north, south, and west, and England formally took possession of the
entire continent.
As regards the navigation of South Australian waters, the earliest records come
from Holland. The Dutch of that day were a nation of sailors, and there were great men
among them. In January, 1627, Pieter Nuyts, in the ship Guide J ccpacrt (Golden Sea
Horse)- a rude craft that to-day would in all possibility be converted at sight into a coal
hulk- accidentally sighted land somewhere in the Great Australian Bight, and compiled an
admirable chart of the coast as far as the islands of St. Peter and St. brands in Nuyts
Archipelago. In the following year the commander of the Vianen, also by 7 accident, made
the same coast. The report of these two navigators as to what they saw did not entice them
or others to specially' return thither. In succeeding generations, Dutch, French, and English
mariners navigated their small, picturesque, and capable craft along the west, north, and east
coasts, but none evinced even a remote desire to examine anything lying inside the sea
shore. Captain George Vancouver, Rear-Admiral Bruny D Entrecasteaux, and Lieutenant
Grant each touched upon or sighted some part of the South Australian coast between 1790
and 1800, but the information they supplied was as short as the duration of their visit.
Lieutenant James Grant was the first British navigator who skirted the shores of
the continent from the Leeuwin to Cape Howe. Profiting by 7 the discoveries ot blinders,
he pursued a more northerly 7 route than his predecessors, made a landfall at a headland
which he named Cape Northumberland, gave the conical mountains in the background the
names of Mount Gambler and Mount Schank, and took his little vessel the Lady Nelson ,
of 60 tons burden—through Bass Straits to Port Jackson, along a course, the greater
part of which until then was entirely unknown.
Some time after the foundation of New South Wales, Flinders, an irrepressible
and restless y 7 oung naval officer generally m the company of Bass, a medical man of little
less energy and fortitude on his own initiative, explored parts of the east coast. He was
an enthusiastic navigator ; with him exploration was a passion. One of the men born
for discovery, he could not refuse to obey the cravings of his adventurous disposition. His
great opportunity- which indeed he may be said to have created came in ISOI, w hen the

British Government equipped the Investigator for the exploration of New Holland, and
commissioned Flinders to command her. One so adventurous, so conscientious, and so able,
except for adventitious circumstances which do not, as a rule, affect the man for the work
other than to assist him, could not but rise to the occasion. He accomplished with distinction
the objects of the expedition, and conferred the name upon the continent which it appropriately
bears. He had as companions John Franklin, afterwards the renowned Arctic explorer;
Robert Brown, the eminent botanist; and William Westall, the celebrated landscape painter.
On a summer evening, January 28, 1802, Flinders anchored in what he named
Fowler Bay after his first lieutenant. Thence he searchingly scrutinised the coast, and
gave to the principal features such names as Streaky Bay, Smoky Bay, Denial Bay,
Investigator Group, Coffin Bay, and Anxious Bay. As is usual in the southern summer,
the vision of the navigator was occasionally circumscribed by thick smoke arising from
bushfires, or by the vaporous haze which arose from the water ; hence the appellation Smoky
Bay. Streaky Bay derived its name from the singular color of the sea ; Coffin Bay from
\ ice-Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, Bart. ; and Anxious Bay from a heavy wind which caused some
apprehension to the navigators when in the neighborhood. The dense haze also tended to
give a false impression of the features of the coastline, and Flinders tells us that it made a
sandy beach look like a chalky cliff, and gave low-lying islands the appearance of steep shores.
The deep gulfs stretching far
into the interior of the continent
between which lies a peninsula
somewhat resembling the human
leg and foot greatly adorned with
excrescent growths- on the shores
of which were made the first
organised settlements in this part
of the continent, were not dis-
covered until late in February.
On Saturday, the 20th of that
month, the Investigator g-entlv
<-> O J
moved into Sleaford Bay. No set
of tide worthy of observation had
yet been noted on this coast, but
here the mariners were vastly
interested by the appearance of a
How from the north, apparently the
ebb. As no land could be seen in
the north-east, the tide might mean
that New Holland, or Australia, was
cut in two. During- the evenino-
o h>’


when the active work of examination was impossible, the officers, resting on board the ship,
passed the time in conjectures concerning the magnitude and value of this discovery. Thus
it was premised to be a large river, a deep inlet, an inland sea, or a passage into the Gulf
ot Carpentaria. Subsequent observation proved it to be no more and no less than a
far-stretching gulf, and it was named after Earl Spencer, then First Lord of the Admiralty.
Ihe pleasant anticipation ol Saturday night stood in very human contrast to the
domestic sadness of Sunday evening. A grim and disastrous incident formed the beginning
of English history in the Gulf. Next day (February 21, 1802) Flinders went over to an
island eastwards with an old and appreciated companion, Mr. Thistle, the mate of the
Investigator. The two had served together, with few breaks, since 1795, and had explored
in company many unknown parts of the earth. Late in the afternoon, Thistle, accompanied
Memory Cove, Port Lincoln
by Mr, Taylor (a midshipman) and six sailors, was sent in a cutter to the mainland to
take observations on shore. In the twilight those aboard the ship saw the cutter returning
under sail. Half an hour elapsed, but the boat did not arrive ; and as the sight of it had
been lost rather suddenly, a guiding light was shown. Presently, Lieutenant Fowler was
sent in search with a lantern. Then two hours passed, and no tidings were received. A
gun was fired, and soon Lieutenant Fowler returned. Near where the cutter was last seen
he entered a rippling of the tide so strong that his boat was almost upset, and there was
reason to believe that the cutter had capsized and thrown its occupants into the water.
After vainly hallooing and firing muskets, the ship’s company became anxiously silent, and
waited for the morning. Earnest search was then made, and the lost cutter was found,
bottom upwards, and stove in as if dashed on the rocks. Days were spent in searching
31

The Forerunners


on land for any of the wrecked men who might have got on shore, but not one was seen.
The sharks that were observed round about suggested that it was unlikely that any would be
successful in such an effort. Flinders commemorated the unfortunate party by naming
islands after each member, and the adjacent headland he named Cape Catastrophe. An
inscription was rudely carved on a copper plate, and set upon a post at the head of the
inlet, which was named Memory Cove. Flinders wrote a panegyric on Thistle, and then
sailed onwards. Scores of years afterwards, bits of the copper plate were collected, and at
present ornament the entrance hall to the Public Library and Museum of South Australia.
A J
blinders now proceeded to determine the extent of the watery expanse towards
the north-east. He penetrated the bays and inlets, and rounded the jutting headlands and
promontories. In the warmth of March and April days, and the cool of the nights, his
vessel carried him up the west coast of Spencer Gulf and down the eastern shore. After
leaving the scene of the recent calamity, he entered the lovely harbor of Port Lincoln,
which William Wes tall sketched most happily. Prominent mainland features and islands in
the Gulf were named, and the disappointment of the navigators can be imagined when they
found that the gulf, which had promised so much, terminated in a shallow creek and
forbidding mud fiats. Sailing out of Spencer Gulf, Flinders named Cape Spencer and
three islands, the Althorpes, and then stood to the south-south-west. A large island which
lay in that direction was called Kangaroo Island, from the great number of kangaroos that
were shot on shore by a landing party. The highest point on the mainland, seen to the
north-east from Kangaroo Island, was named Mount Lofty, and the sheet of water between
Kangaroo Island and the mainland, Investigator Strait, after the ship. The second large
stretch of water leading to the north was designated Gulf St Vincent, and the land
between the two gulfs Yorke Peninsula, after the Right Hon. C. P. Yorke. Flinders says
little of the Gulf St. Vincent, whereon the City of Adelaide is built. His inspection of it was
cursory, rapid, and not interesting. “The nearest part of the coast” (eastward), he writes,
“ was distant three leagues, mostly low, and composed of sand and rock, with a few small
trees scattered over it ; but a few miles inland, where the back mountains rise, the country
was well clothed with forest timber, and had a fertile appearance.”
Flinders did not linger on this part of his voyage, and, after leaving the theatre
upon the stage of which our narrative proceeds, pursued his easterly course. As though
prescient of its importance, he named the channel leading to it between the eastern end
of Kangaroo Island and the mainland. Backstairs Passage, with Antechamber Bay and the
Pages (three small islands) close at hand. Shortly after leaving the easternmost point of
Kangaroo Island astern which he named Cape Willoughby he met the French national
ship, Lc Geographe , commanded by Captain Nicholas Baudin, devoted to exploration work.
The stretch of water where they sighted each other was named by Flinders Encounter Bay
to celebrate the occasion. Ihe vessels hove to, and the commanders—representatives of
conflicting nations, then actually at war, but individually engaged in corresponding peaceful
scientific pursuits -visited each other, compared charts, and discoursed on their discoveries.


Baudin had come from Van Diemen Land, and had conferred names on prominent features
of the coast, including Rivoli Bay, Cape Bernouilli, and Guichen Bay, which Flinders
accepted with true chivalry, recognising the prior claim of the first discoverer, but the
hrenchman was not so courteous; he in his charts and journals ignored the claims of
Flinders, and instead ot adopting the nomenclature with which he was more fully acquainted,
substituted another ot his own. Thus for Kangaroo Island he put L ’ Isle Decrds; for
Gult St. Vincent, Golfe Josephine; and for Spencer Gulf, Golfe Bonaparte. This objectionable
breach of etiquette was exposed, and Flinders’ designations were finally confirmed, while
no attempt was made to alter those to which Baudin had a right. Lieutenant F reycinet,
attached to Baudin’s expedition, a few months later suggestively remarked to Flinders in the
house of Governor King, at Sydney : “ Captain, if we had not been kept so long picking
up shells and catching butterflies at Van Diemen Land, you would not have discovered
the south coast before us.”
After separating from Baudin in Encounter Bay, Flinders followed the coastline
beyond the borders of South Australia, noted geographical features, and sailed up the east
coast to Port Jackson. The east and north coasts were charted, the circumnavigation of
the continent completed for the first time, its name suggested, and then the Investigator ,
an old war vessel eaten away by parasites, and worn out with many years of severe and
useful labor, was declared to be unfit for service. Other and smaller vessels were taken
by Flinders, and, after shipwreck, he returned to Port Jackson. On a colonial cutter,
the Cumberland\ of 29 tons, he proceeded in the bold task of making his way to
England. The frail craft might be safe enough for river and light coastal work, but he
must be courageous who would seek to navigate it to the northern hemisphere. Even
this great exploit Flinders might have accomplished had the French not arrested him in
Mauritius for being without a passport. For six years he was immured in a small island
prison, and was not liberated until 1810, when Mauritius capitulated to the English. On
July 14, 1814, the great navigator died, but in Australia his memory will be perpetuated
as long as the language lasts. Such is, in part, the story of the first forerunner of South
Australian settlement, which deals with a great man and a hero who rendered inestimable
service to his country, who deserved a better fate than he received, and to whom posterity
owes a debt of gratitude it can never repay.
Next in both chronology and importance came the work of Captain Charles Sturt,
of the 39th Regiment, a man inflexible, hardy, and enthusiastic, whose career is honorable
in Australian records. Captains Dillon, Sutherland, and Jones at one time and another
vi si ted the coast near the capital, and the latter is said to have discovered 1 ort Adelaide.
But substantially from 1802 to 1830 nothing more was learnt of South Australia than was
told by the navigator, F'linders. The Governors of New South Wales during all this period
had supreme power over Australian affairs, and systematic exploration, like everything else,
was almost wholly dependent on their initiative. By a process of natural development
rather than by deliberate experiment, New South Wales was found to be eminently adapted

for the growth of wool,
and the Governors there-
fore desired more infor-
mation concerning inland
territory. In 1818, Oxley
traversed leagues upon
leagues of promising coun-
try south-west of Sydney,
and others followed him.
On November 17, 1824,
Hume and Hovell emerged
from among the woods
south of Sydney, and saw
a great waterway —at once

named the Hume at a
place now known as Albury.
Subsequent investigation
proved that this one fam-
ous river in Australia had
its source in the snowy
peaks of the Australian
Alps, and that as it trickled
down the eminences it was
joined by thousands of little
streams, making an ener-
getic and vital current,
which set out on a tortuous
Captain Flinders
journey of over 2,000 miles across a part of the continent. It was a streak of silver on a green
find \ dlow face. In its sinuous course among gumtrees, through beautiful valleys,
over hot, baked plains, and under hills and high cliffs, it enriched millions of acres of soil,
and was joined by other rivers draining thousands of miles of fertile land north and south.
Hut Hume and Hovell only sighted a few miles of this river. Captain Sturt, with Hume,
set out for the south-western territory, and explored the Murrumbidgee, the Macquarie, the
Lachlan, and the Darling. In the second expedition in 1829-30 a boat was launched on
the Murrumbidgee, the course of which the explorers followed to where it entered a nobler
river. Sturt and his men put their little craft into the centre of the new stream, and then
with lifted hats and light hearts they celebrated the occasion with enthusiastic cheering ;
and thus the English tongue sounded for the first time in this part of the continent.
It was the same river that Hume and Hovell had discovered further to the east, and
Captain Sturt named it the Murray, after Sir George Murray, then head of the Colonial
Department.
The problem to be solved was the ultimate destination of the rivers flowing

westward from the moun-
tainous country on the east.
Their volume was known to
be considerable, but no out-
let to the ocean had been
discovered, nor did their
course lie in that direction.
Did they lose themselves in
a vast marshy labyrinth ?
J J
Were they absorbed by the
hot sands of some immense
interior desert? Would
they lead to some great and
lovely inland sea ? Captain
Sturt’s expedition was de-
signed to answer these
O
questions ; and from the
moment he reached the
Murrumbidgee junction his
difficult and perilous way lay
plainly before him. It was
to trace the Murray to its
mouth. It led in and out
among thousands of gum
trees, which grew to the
river’s banks, and even from
its bed. On either side were
plains stretching for many
miles, sometimes open and
sometimes wooded. Upon
A View of the River Murray
the bends and commanding points aborigines gathered and gazed with eyes wide open with
surprise and wonder and mouths agape. With the treacherous cunning, characteristic of
the ignorant, they sought to attack the white men. or insanely threatened them in the
impotence of their weakness. A critical moment arrived when the boat struck a sandbank,
and the explorers had to land to push it into deep water again. The sandbank marked
the confluence of the Darling with the Murray. Gathered on one side were natives in
martial panoply. It seemed that a great tragedy was about to be enacted, when suddenly,
with a warning cry. a native from the other side plunged into the stream, swam across,
discoursed dramatically and earnestly to the assembled warriors, and finally moved them to
give the explorers safe passage. The action of this black peacemaker probably saved the
lives of several brave men, and was among the circumstances which culminated in the early
colonisation ot .South Australia.


Sturt pursued his intricate journey to the westwards, and presently entered the
territory now included in the Province of South Australia. Here his course was not as a
rule so interesting, nor the country so fertile. Plain and melancholy scrub, alternated with
pretty high banks and fructive reaches ; but the former outsized the latter. Occasionally
the river spread over low-lying ground, and it was difficult to find sufficient depth to float
the little boat. Ihe horizon began to get clearer to the south, and on February 9
Sturt and his men were somewhat disappointed to find that the Murray terminated in a
beautiful lake, which seemed to afford no navigable channel to the ocean. The lake
(Alexandrina) was no great distance from the shores of Encounter Pay, where Flinders
and Baudin met, and east of the Gulf St. Vincent. A picturesque panorama stretched
before the explorers. Ihe water of the lake was ruffled by a breeze which swept over it.
Some 40 miles westwards was a range which, gradually declining to the south, terminated
abruptly in the north in a high peak, which Sturt at once took to be the Mount Lofty of
blinders. Between the range and the onlookers was a lovely promontory projecting into
the lake, and beyond the promontory the water ran to the base
of the hills, and formed an extensive bay. Over low country in
the north-west distant peaks were just visible, and over a bold
headland, and through a strait which formed in the south-west,
was a glimpse of clear and open sea. East and south-east
the land was low, but the left shore of the lake was
studded with minor elevations crowned with cypress trees.
Tents were pitched upon a bank of the lake, where
the soil was rich in black vegetable deposit. Sturt and
Macleay examined the neighboring country, much of which
was lightly wooded and covered with grass. But the ex-
plorers could not remain here long ; their provisions were
running short, and they had to pull against the current
of the Murray for the whole distance homeward
Flinders Memorial, Port Lincoln
to the depot on the Murrumbidgee. On the downward journey natives had
exhibited hostility towards them, and it was apprehended that they would be
even more threatening on the return. Sturt regretted the necessity of hurrying
from Encounter Bay, and recorded that his eye never fell on country of a more
promising aspect, and that he believed that it would prove of immense value. The
tale of anxiety and suffering, strange vicissitude, and an inflexible will during the next few
weeks, is full of interest. The men, reduced to half rations, had to pull against a strong
current. One by one they almost dropped in the boat with fatigue, and one man became
insane through his intense suffering. Effort and will were unrelaxed ;on March 20 the
camp on the Murrumbidgee was reached, but not yet was their misery ended. The journey
to Sydney in physical and mental anguish was such as men are seldom able to accomplish,
and the wonder was that they lived to tell the surprising tale. Sturt was never daunted,
he overcame what would be impossible to most men, and fully merited the honor he


jnlhL ■ M A HKfcr

received. He urged the New South Wales Government to explore the country from
the eastern part of Kncounter Bay to the head of Gulf St. Vincent. And thus another
forerunner completed his work with lasting and beneficial results.
It would seem that the report of Captain Sturt induced the New South Wales
Government, in 1831, to dispatch a second and smaller expedition to explore the country
contiguous to Gulf St. Vincent. Captain Collett Barker, of the 39th Foot, was given
charge of this, and had as companions Dr. Davis, assistant surgeon of the same regiment,
and Mr. Kent, of the commissariat. Barker possessed considerable experience of Australian
affairs, and had more than once paved the way for new settlements. He was at one time
commandant of a colony at Raffles Bay, and at Albany succeeded Major Lockyer, who, in
1826, with convicts and a few soldiers, founded a settlement at King George Sound when
the French had designs on the western territory. His equitable and firm management of
the native families frequenting the Sound inaugurated the happiest relations between white
and black. He or his officers explored the picturesque scenery stretching for scores of
miles from Albany. Barker was instructed to land at Cape Jervis,
on the east coast of Gulf St. Vincent, thence to survey inland.
In April, 1831, he arrived, made his way to the hills, and
descried delightful scenery and well-grassed country. He beheld
a magnificent panorama from the top of Mount Lofty, where no
white man had ever stood, and over the rich open plain to the
north-west viewed an indentation in the coast of the Gulf, which
became the port of the City of Adelaide. He discovered and
named the .Sturt River, and after examining much fertile
land, proceeded to Encounter Bay and the Murray Mouth,
that he might correct the observations of Flinders with the
discoveries of Captain Sturt. Here he sought to carry out the
principal object of his trip, and went to where the waters of
Captain Sturt
the Murray and the Fake disembogued, to see if there were a deep channel there, and
swam across to take bearings on the eastern side. None of his companions could swim
well enough to accompany him. He stripped, reached the opposite shore, ascended the
sandy bluff long afterwards called by his name, and took several compass bearings. Then
he disappeared from view down the farther side of the knoll, and was never seen again.
His companions watched for his return with intense impatience. In the night they observed,
with feelings of terrible apprehension, a chain of fires lighted by natives, and the breeze
carried the plaintive and melancholy chants of women across the river. It is the custom
of Australian aborigines to celebrate death in this impulsive manner. The brave but
unsuspicious explorer had evidently been cruelly murdered by members of the black family
which had been specially hostile to Sturt ; and it is the more pathetic to contemplate when
his uniform kindness towards their contemporaries elsewhere is remembered. From
subsequent cross-examination, it was believed that Captain Barker, when descending the
sand dune, was confronted by three natives, that they speared him, and then cast his
37

mangled body among the breakers on the shore. Says Captain Sturt of Barker :He
was in disposition, as he was in the close of his life, in many respects similar to Captain
Cook. Mild, affable, and attentive, he had the esteem and regard of every companion,
and the respect of everyone under him. Zealous in the discharge of his public duties,
honorable and just in private life, a lover and follower of science, indefatigable and dauntless
in his pursuits, a steady friend, an entertaining companion. In him the King lost one of
his most valuable officers, and his regiment one of its most efficient members.” Friends
of this courageous victim to colonisation erected a monument and tablet to his memory in
St. James’s Church, London. By the experience of its three forerunners, South Australian
history was baptised in wreck, in physical anguish, and in blood.
Mr. Kent supplied a report of the country visited, which caused Captain Sturt to
write that the eastern shore of New Holland was rich in soil and pasture, that it was a
place where “ the colonist might venture with every prospect of success, and in whose
valleys the exile might hope to build for himself and for his family a peaceful and prosperous
home. I hus was obtained the information which, upon its publication in Great Britain,
created so much interest, and gave a powerful impetus to the movement for the formation
of a new colony in the south of Australia.
In the meantime a few adventurous spirits had for some years been exploiting the
waters of the neighboring deep. Whaling was proving a source of wealth in Tasmania,
and on the coast ol what was afterwards formed into the colony of Victoria. Whalers and
sealers sailed in their boats as far west as Kangaroo Island, formed stations, and captured
both the whales and seals which came within reach. In this dangerous and exciting
o o
occupation they found ample scope. Captain Sutherland, when he visited the island in
January, 1819. according to his own statement, travelled inland with two sealers who had been
living there for some years. George Bates arrived there in 1824, and, after staying on
the island for 71 years, removed to Adelaide, where he died on September 8. 1895.
William Walker, another whaler, is said to have landed in 1819. He assumed the title
of Governor of the Island. 1 hese and other men were wont to visit the mainland,
where they caught native women and took them away to live with them. One of these
women escaped by swimming across the straits, nine miles wide at the narrowest part,
notwithstanding powerful currents and the innumerable sharks with which Backstairs
Passage was infested.
Of those who may be entitled forerunners of colonisation, the aboriginal inhabitants
deserve some attention. They were a people of pleasure, lighthearted, songful, and laughter-
loving. I hey were lithe and supple in their movements, and possessed an easy carriage.
I hey knew no God, and held but a hazy belief m the spirit world. I hey were a mysterious
people, for no one knows whence they came. To themselves the satisfaction of animal
wants was quite sufficient ; to the anthropologist, terms only of regret must be applied,
because he has taken so little trouble to enquire seriously into their origin. Soon the


opportunity of close observation will be gone, for the Exterminator has immolated
nearly all. Contrary to the general opinion, their customs and habits offer supremely
interesting matter for study. There is much in them -circumcision, mutilation, marriage,
burial, etc.-—which resembles the customs of the ancient Jews, the rites of African negroes,
and the habits and beliefs of aboriginal races in other parts of the w r orld. Eew peoples
have secured less scientific attention, and the omission is almost a slur on the honor of
the British student.
In communication with each other the Australian natives had a system of signs
and codes as comprehensive, because more universally utilised, as the noble brotherhood
of Freemasons. By raising the hands to the ears and lips, and by other rapid, mystic
signs, messages of peculiar significance were conveyed without waste of words. These
were as aptly understood in Western Australia as in New South Wales and South
Group of South Australian Aborigines
Australia, and varied but little. They knew nothing of writing, of agriculture, or of
building houses and ships. There was not much greater difference between the languages
spoken in different parts of Australia than between the dialects of English counties and
German provinces. The roots of the words were generally the same allj over the
continent.
The sound of their chattering in their camps was pleasing. Many of their words
were exceedingly tuneful, because of the prominence given to vowels. W hen recounting
the incidents of the hunt, or any other of the episodes of their day, they seldom adhered
to the prosaic form of ordinary narrative, but gradually had recourse to poetry, and chanted
with extraordinary vigor. Battles, hunting scenes, death celebrations, long tramps— all were
rendered into song and poetry. Bretty were the vowel cadences, and sweet was the effect
of rude dirges and chants carried by the wind over hill and creek and scrub to a distant


listener. A particular couplet sometimes obtained popularity, and was sung all day long in
infinite repetition at woodland corners and on treeless plains. \ hese are to be esteemed as
the normal expression of a phase of their character.
They had no settled home, as we understand the term. Here and there they
constructed a primitive shelter, but soon the necessities of food compelled them to move
on in the district which was the peculiar property of a family. Each tribe, or, more
properly, each family, had a circumscribed territory. If any of its members went beyond
its bounds, they ran the risk of being captured and killed by the neighboring family.
The flowers of shrubs, several sorts of vegetation, the worms and grubs which burrowed
in tree and soil, the roots which lay buried in the ground, animals, birds, and fish, supplied
their diet. Everyone who has read anything at all about Australia is acquainted with
their methods of hunting the kangaroo, of securing fish, of dragging the opossum from its
hollow tree, and of their orgies at the corrobboree. At night the families gathered in their
camps, and passed the time in chanting, in chattering, in laughing, in sharpening weapons,
and in incorrigible boastings and conceits concerning impossible exploits. A native camp
without huge fires was unknown, for it was thus, they believed, that the few omnipotent
and dreaded spirits were kept at bay. Beyond the circle of light lurked stalking
demons ready to injure them, and the native did not move without a firestick to give him
light. Late at night, one by one of the family dropped off to sleep, and soon nothing
moved but a prowling dog, the restless flicker of the flames, and the quivering leaves
of trees.
In affairs of the heart they were not without romance. The ordinary routine was
certainly not elevating. Honeyed words and gentle caresses were not so frequently used
as brute force with the club. The woman, as among the Orientals, was a chattel ; she
had no rights, and she asked for none. She was the beast of burden, the hewer, and the
drawer. But she was capable of great affection, both to her own kind and to dumb
animals. In her tenderness she has been known to suckle a puppy that had lost its
mother. At great discomfort and risk she was kind to her children ; and as nurse in white
families she was faithful and affectionate with the little ones entrusted to her care. Under
native custom a female child was frequently affianced to a much older male soon after her
birth, a custom not long obsolete in Europe. She was married at the age of seven and
upwards ; the ceremony was simple and quickly ended. The bride merely proceeded to
the hut of the bridegroom, and prepared it for his reception, or she constructed a new
hut ; by that little act she was his to club or cuff, his to treat as he wished.
Sometimes she contracted a passion for another man, and woe be to her and her
lover if her perfidy were discovered. The deceived husband might end the man’s love
affair by driving a spear through his body, and might punish the woman by piercing her
legs and. arms with spears ; so that an attractive female sometimes showed many scars.
One case is attested where two young people felt for each other such intense affection
H

that they willingly bore three separate punishments so that they might live together ; each
punishment consisted in spears being projected into their limbs they stood firm and bore
the pain with stoical resignation.
When the lovers decamped they were relentlessly tracked through the bush until
they were caught. The two men stood face to face, and each ordered the woman to
follow him ; whichever she disobeyed speared her in some part of the body. The husband
was allowed to throw spears at both the man and the woman. But though some of them
showed evidence of the possession of the gentle passion, they had no word for love in
their language. When their connection was beyond the ordinary, it resembled the fidelity
and protectorship which is sometimes seen between a strong and a weak animal. In
some families a man was not allowed to marry until he had subscribed to certain customs;
law prescribed a marriageable age. Close intermarrying was prevented by law ; the
children received their names in some families from the mother, in some from the
father, and in some, as in ancient times, from any special circumstance noted at
their birth.
Their notion of a spirit-world was vague, inconclusive, and yet potent. There were
three or four presiding deities, who were gifted with limited supernatural influence; but none
prayed to them, and none praised them. According to native theory, man never succumbed
to natural causes. There was always some treacherous and infernal power at work to
encompass death. Each family was accompanied by a sorcerer, or medicine man. He it
was who could command space, and place at night a deadly malady in the body of a man
of another tribe ; and he it was who could occasionally extract the insidious destroyer from
the body of a member of his own tribe. When the native believed that the inimical
sorcerer had visited him, and the friendly sorcerer was powerless to stay the fatal effects,
no medicine could save him. He pined away and died hopeless, prayerless, resigned.
Immediately afterwards his brethren were compelled by law to avenge his unnatural death.
They first pretended to discover from which family the sorcerer had come ; after which
they set about killing, indiscriminately, one of its members. Until they did so, the spirit
of the dead man was apt to become restless and wander in the vicinity of his friends at
night, and occasion them no end of trouble and fright. This was a part of the great lex
talionis , which demanded eye for eye, tooth for tooth, death for death. For each death in
battle, in the hunt, or by means of a sorcerer, another death was necessary ; thus only were
the manes of the defunct men appeased. Upon the death of a male, his wife or wives
became the property of his nearest relative, as among the ancient Jews.
The death and burial scenes were grotesque, grim, ,and pathetic. Such weeping
and wailing were seldom observed among other races. The women gashed themselves
with the nails of their fingers and with sharp stones, and they and the men painted
themselves in woful colors, to express the intensity of their grief. Strange and whimsical
were the rites and customs at this extremity.

Unfortunately, it is largely advisable to write of the Australian natives as in the
past tense. Ihe territory settled by the whites a few decades ago knows them no more ;
the fiat has gone forth ,• the white civilises the black out of existence. The vices of the
stronger were adopted by the weak to their woful decimation, and it is certain that the
dark skin has been worsted in its contact with the Caucasian ; still only in unexplored or
unsettled territory do they roam their desert birthplaces untrammelled, free, contented ;
taking no thought lor the morrow, and living only for the day.

E'HE scene now changes to England ; and while it is being
unfolded, and many hands are helping to complete the plans
for future operations, readers should picture this land as lying
in repose. It might aptly be termed The Waiting Land. Here
were stretches of fertile soil that no one had yet troubled to
till, and pastures read) for herds of cattle and docks of sheep. It
was as silent and comparatively unused as a sterile African
desert. Woods contrasted with open plains, dreary scrub with
treeless prairies, green hillsides with baked salt lakes. Many
of the hills and valleys to the south were covered with nutritious
grasses, wholesomely green in the English summer; broken-
parched, and shrivelled in the English winter. These were
waiting to receive and assist the labor of civilised people.
The reports of Sturt and Barker were forwarded to England, and received a fair
amount of attention during the months immediately following their issue. Flinders’ journals
dealing with the same country were consulted with renewed interest, and an account
was published of a hurried visit paid by Captain John Jones to Gulf St. Vincent after
Barker’s trip. This writer, however, tended to do harm to the cause of any proposed colony,
for he supplied an exaggerated, unreliable, and too attractive description of a natural port
and river, on the east coast of the Gulf, which led readers to anticipate a very superior site
for a settlement, which Port Adelaide certainly was not.

The years 1828-40 may be regarded as an experimental period in colonisation,
when schemes and principles were debated upon with some asperity in Parliament, in
newspapers and magazines, and among a certain coterie of men who, considering their
energy, might be said to have been gifted with prescient sagacity. Early in the period
these individuals advocated colonisation with an earnestness suggesting that they were
fully imbued with the importance of a policy which did not obtain national recognition
until nearly sixty years later that of assuring the future ascendency of the British people
by founding a colonial Empire unparalleled in history. Since then a vast amount of varied
and useful experience in colonisation
has been gained by Great Britain, but,
notwithstanding several subsequent
attempts and much jingoistic bragga-
docio, it is certain that the ideal has
not yet been attained.
The moving power of the day
was Edward Gibbon W akefield, a man
of commanding personality, of un-
doubted talent and statesmanship, who
had passed a life of singular social
vicissitude. He founded a school of
political economy, which was popular
for many years, and upon whose
principles immense sums of money
were expended in forming new settle-
ments. He was influentially associated
with colonisation in Western Australia,
South Australia, New Zealand, and
Canada. His last years were spent
in New Zealand, where he was inde-
fatigable in establishing the settlements
of Otago and Canterbury. Born in
1796, he was educated for the Bar,
became a popular writer on political
subjects, and first obtained distinction
Edward Gibbon Wakefield
for pamphlets on prison management and the condition of the lower classes. His
most complete work—“A View of the Art of Colonisation”—was issued in 1849. He
died at Wellington, New Zealand, on May 16, 1862. His efforts were so appreciated by
the British Government that a white marble bust of him was placed in the vestibule of
the Colonial Office among those of famous promoters of colonisation.
W akefield energetically protested against awarding unconditionally and without


payment huge grants of lands in new countries. He contended that in all colonies an even
balance should be preserved between land, labor, and capital ; that land should be sold at
a fair price ; and that labor should be applied to land in a fair proportion.
Ihe projectors ol South Australia, in drawing up their plans, were influenced by
recent colonising experiences in Western Australia. That colony was launched in 1829, upon
land incorrectly and extravagantly described by Captain Stirling, afterwards Sir fames Stirling,
and Mr. Charles Fraser. Ihe British Government, although it considered it probable that
h ranee desired to acquire this territory, refused to incur any liability to relieve settlers in
the event of the experiment being unsuccessful. It was expressly stipulated in Colonial
Office circulars that no convicts were to be landed there, and hence that colonists must not
depend on forced labor. To found a colony at a minimum of expense, almost unlimited
areas of land were alienated, in localities to be chosen by the purchaser, upon the number
of laborers which each capitalist introduced. Thus, a man paying the passage to Swan
River ol ten servants, reckoned to cost each, received a certificate from Commissioners
entitling him to worth of land. The price of land was set down at is. 6d. per
acre, and the settler was awarded 4,000 acres. Land was also obtainable at the same rate
on the value of goods introduced by each person. Thomas Peel, a founder of the colony,
introduced laborers and goods in 1829 which entitled him to 250,000 acres. Troubles
arose with the servants, who, because they constituted in an untilled country the supreme
factor, demanded high terms. They quickly released themselves from their indentures, and,
as land was cheap, purchased on their own behalf. Being without capital, it was practically
valueless to them. The experiment was necessarily a failure, because land was alienated
on an erroneous principle ; the hopes ol colonists were not realised, and, as many of them
were unfit tor pioneer work, they met with disaster. Persons used to luxury, and possessed
of a classical education, were reduced to actual privation, and were as helpless in development
work as the native who vainly begged for bread at their doors, or speared their cattle in
the bush.
It was against this sort of colonisation that Wakefield exerted his utmost influence,
but even though his arguments might be sound, the successful application of his principles
was dependent on conditions that were not always present. Schemes embracing his views
for colonising Western Australia on a huge scale were proposed in 1835, and one was
carried into, effect with disastrous results in 1841. A company was formed, and purchased
land on the picturesque region lying on the shores of the estuary running inland from
Bunbury, Western Australia. Allotments of 100 acres were offered to the public at £\
per acre, and plans of a splendid town to be named Australind were drawn up. Mistakes
were made, and misapprehension arose concerning the fertility of the land. The settlement
was formed by a few hundred people, but was a failure, redeemed by few pleasing features.
In a country thousands of miles from any market, and possessing a population aggregating
only about 3,000, a family could not possibly earn a livelihood on 100 acres. The project
was doomed from the beginning, and it ended in individual and collective ruin and in
great bodily suffering.

In 1810 a Colonising Society was formed in England, and in 1831 proposals
were made for the establishment of a new colony in the country on the south coast
described by Flinders, Sturt, and Barker. In 1834 Wakefield published the first edition
of a work entitled “ The New British Province of South Australia, wherein he mentioned
that the projectors had consulted all the reports of the forerunners, and had taken evidence
concerning the quality of the land. It is interesting to record that, in judging of the
suitability of the country, Wakefield accepted the law of analogy as a basis. He argued
that, unlike America and other places, “ extra-tropical Australia ’ presented in distance
little difference in climate, soils, and general features, and that from works published on
New South Wales and Van Diemen Land, a judgment could be formed of the country
in South Australia.
In March, 1831, the British Government, impressed with its evils, abolished the
land-grant system, and substituted one which proclaimed that all Crown lands should be
put up for sale at a minimum price of ss. per acre. Ihe gentlemen who made the
proposals embraced with avidity the principles of Wakefield, enunciated in letters from
Sydney, published in 1829. They agreed that no free grants of land should be made ;
that a minimum of 125., and a maximum of 205., per acre should be fixed; and that the
proceeds of sales should “ form a fund for giving Iree passages to qualified laborers and
mechanics, with their wives and families.” The great object sought to be attained was to
help the industrious classes. They gained the assistance of Mr. Robert Gouger, a powerful
advocate of Wakefield’s principles, who edited the before-mentioned letters, Major Bacon,
Colonel Torrens, Mr. Graham, and Wakefield himself. Much official correspondence ensued,
but Lord Goderich, the Secretary for the Colonies, eventually discouraged the project, and
the negotiations were abandoned in 1832, even after a provisional committee had been
appointed.
A change of administration took place, and in July. 1833. Mr. \\ . Wolryche
Whitmore, M.P., submitted a modified scheme to the new Secretary for the Colonies, Mr.
E. G. Stanley. Says Mr. Edwin Hodder, in his “History of South Australia”:—“lt
contemplated the purchase of land by a joint-stock company, and by private individuals,
and with the proceeds arising from such sales to send out the pauper or unemployed
population of the United Kingdom ; the expense of establishing the colony to be borne by
the company, and a land tax levied to defray the cost of government, the company having
the right of pre-emption of one million acres of land at ss. per acre.’’
Mr. Hodder uses the term “joint-stock company,” the associations of which at
that time were objectionable, and follows the policy of magazine reviewers and othe
critics of the day who were severely castigated by Colonel R. Torrens, M.P., in a book
issued on the subject in 1835. Colonel Torrens denied that it could be named a “joint-
stock company,” and marshalled powerful arguments in favor of his view. Indeed, in a
certain circumscribed but enlightened circle, the new proposals were discussed with
considerable heat and comprehension. The Secretary for the Colonies demanded such
46
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY

conditions in the revised scheme that it was quickly dropped with a pout. J his was
the second stage.
What was termed a “ powerful and influential body ’’ revived the proposals in
1834. The South Australian Association was formed, and among the names on the provisional
committee were those of nineteen members of the House of Commons, and such as Sir
S. W. Molesworth, Bart., M.P., Colonel Torrens, M.P., H. Lytton Kulwer, M.P., William
Hutt, M.P. (prominently interested in Western Australian and New Zealand schemes), John
Wilkes, M.P., J. W. Childers, M.P., Rowland Hill, Jacob Montefiore, and Raikes Currie.
Mr. W. W. Whitmore, M.P., was chairman ; George Grote, M.P., the historian of Greece,
treasurer ; and Robert Gouger, secretary. A draft charter of incorporation was drawn up,
but there were disputations with the Secretary for the Colonies, and it, too. was abandoned.
The Association then passed a resolution undertaking that il Parliament provided an Act
constituting a Crown Colony, the Association would continue in existence “as a private
and temporary society for the purpose of promoting the success of the measure." I his
was done. Mr. Gouger furnished the rough draft of a Bill, but a short delay took place
owing to Mr. Stanley being superseded in the Colonial Office by Mr. Spring Rice,
afterwards Lord Monteagle. The latter seemed more ready to support the efforts of the
Association than his predecessor, and the Bill was introduced to Parliament by Mr.
Whitmore. Among its supporters were Lord Howick (afterwards Earl Grey), J. Shaw
Lefevre, Lord Stanley, and Spring Rice. Ihe Marquis of Normanby introduced the
measure to the House of Lords, where the Duke of Wellington was largely instrumental
in overcoming a threatening opposition. Ihe famous officer became a friend of the new
Province, and recommended that Colonel Light, a companion-in-arms, should be its first
Surveyor-General.
The Bill received Royal assent on August 15, 1834, and provided that the boundaries
of the Province should extend from the 132 nd to the 141 st degrees of east longitude, and
from the south coast, including adjacent islands, to the Tropic of Capricorn. It was
expressly stated that no convicts were to be landed in the Province; that public lands,
under the management of a Board of Commissioners, were to be sold at a minimum of
12s. per acre; and that the proceeds from such sales were to be employed in conveying
to the Province laborers, of equal number in sex, with a preference for young married
people without children. The affairs of the community were to be regulated by the
Commissioners until the population reached 50,000 persons, when a representative Assembly
would be constituted. The Act was inoperative until the Commissioners had raised ,£35,000
bv the sale of land, and until the sum of £,'20.000 was invested in bonds. The Commissioners
J
were empowered to borrow ,£200,000 on the security of the Province. The original
proposals of the Association had been greatly revised, but those referring to the price of
land and to emigration were adhered to. The best feature in the Act lay in the regulations
dealing with the settlement of population, groups of which were to be formed, and lands
for which were to be surveyed in blocks of 80 acres. “The land and emigration scheme,”


wrote Mr. John Stephens in his “Rise and Progress of South Australia” (1839), “is the
first attempt in the history of colonisation to plant a colony upon correct principles to ensure
to the laborer employment and to the capitalist an ample supply of labor.” Colonel
Torrens, Mr. Gouger, and other authorities, lauded the same policy with judicious enthusiasm.
Taking the Act as a whole, however, grave and tedious difficulties were certain
to arise before some of its stipulations could be complied with. Three or four explorers
had described portions of the new country ; and that was all that was really known of it.
Ihe romantic and adventurous might deem these stories quite sufficient, but the cold
business man would not be satisfied. It was not likely that he would invest capital in land
in a remote country without more specific information, or some assurance that his title would
be secured by the actual foundation of the Province. The Act embraced several features of
a charter of a Crown colony. The title to public lands was to come from Commissioners,
and not direct from the Crown, and no royalty or reservation was made.
A Board of Commissioners was appointed, and was composed of J. W. Childers. M.P.,
W. Clay, M.P., G. Grote, M.P., G. W. Norman, Colonel Torrens, M.P., and W. W.
Whitmore, M.P. (chairman). The historical founder of the Penny Postal System, Mr.
Rowland Hill, became secretary to the Board. The members met at intervals, and their
discussions centred on the problem of raising the money which had to be invested
in land before they could enter upon their powers. It was more than they could manage,
and when a change of Ministry took place at the end of 1834, they resigned. Lord
Glenelg became Secretary of State for the Colonies, and on May 5, 1835- his first public
act on taking office he appointed a new Board: G. F. Angas, PL Barnard, W. Hutt,
John Geo. Shaw Lefevre, W. A. Mackinnon, M.P., S. Mills, Jacob Montefiore, G. Palmer, jun.,
J. Wright, Colonel R. I orrens, F.R.S. (chairman); Rowland Hill was re-appointed secretary.
As was pointed out by Colonel Torrens, South Australia was an unexplored wilderness ;
therefore the difficulty experienced in raising the required guarantee can be perceived. The
new members entered upon their duties with courage and inflexibility not unlike that of the
explorer, confronted by desolate wastes, who determines to surmount every obstacle for the
sake of posterity. I hey proceeded on methodical lines. Offices had to be obtained, clerks
and agents employed, and the principles and prospects of the new province explained to
the public. Regulations for the sale of lands were published in June, 1835, and it was
considered advisable to fix the price at 20s. per acre rather than at the minimum, 12s.
Circulars, maps, and appeals were issued ; a loan of ,£I,OOO was raised ; agents of experience
were engaged ; but the required acreage of land was not disposed of. “It was at this
juncture, writes Mr. Hodder, “that one of the Commissioners. Mr. George Fife Angas, a
wealthy merchant, who had for some years been quietly working in the interests of the
1 1 colony, came forward as leader of the forlorn hope, brought forward and
carried into effect a scheme, without which the colonisation of South Australia under the
conditions of the Act of Parliament would have been utterly impossible.”


. *

Mr. Angas advised that a collateral association should be formed to assist the
Commissioners. He proposed that a company with capital sufficient to purchase the
necessary quantity of land and for the working of the colonial Government should be
established, and that it should take to South Australia agents, servants, and other emigrants,
and supply them with provisions while they were engaged on reproductive works. The
other Commissioners did not at once fall in with the suggestion, but finally they gave it
their unanimous support. Mr. Angas, with Messrs. Henry Kingscote and Thomas Smith,
subscribed capital enough to purchase the unsold land, which, he declared, was to be
handed over to the projected company at cost price, with interest at 5 per cent. The
concession he required was that the land was to be cleared to him and then to the company
at 12s. per acre. I his was granted, and as, under the few earlier sales, land was sold in
80-acre blocks, with one town acre added (first regulations), the Commissioners in a spirit
ot common fairness extended the reduction to these previous purchasers by increasing
their lots of land to 134 acres and one town acre. The Commissioners offered
to sell, until March 1, 1836, land at the same price to any person who could show
that he would be prepared to
improve it. The amount of

in the colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen Land, and Western Australia. The
name of “The South Australian Company” was taken. The original Directors were
George Fife Angas (chairman), Raikes Currie, Charles Hindley, M.P., James Hyde,
Henry Kingscote, Alderman John Pirie, Christopher Rawson, John Rundle, M.P., Thomas
Smith, James Rudell Todd, and Henry Waymouth.
In the plan of operations the Company proposed, when South Australia was
reached, to erect wharves, warehouses, and dwelling-houses upon their town land, and to let
them to colonists, or to otherwise dispose of them ; to improve and cultivate their country land,
and to lease or sell part of it if expedient ; to lay out farms, erect buildings upon them,
and to let them to industrious tenants with the right of purchase before the expiration of
the leases; to grow wool for European markets ; to embark in whale, seal, and other
fisheries in the waters adjacent to the Province, and to cure and salt fish for exportation ; to
salt and cure beef and pork for export or for the provisioning of ships ; and to establish a
bank or banks which should advance loans on the security of land, and undertake such
49

banking operations as the Directors might deem expedient. The Directors also took into
their consideration what trades would be required in the infant settlement, and chose and
provided tools for carpenters, brickmakers, limeburners, blacksmiths, boatbuilders, fishermen,
and others.
I hus the preliminary arrangements for settling were concluded, and all that remained
to do was to appoint officers, civil and commercial, and to charter and despatch ships. A
new system of colonisation was about to be tried, one based on logical premises, and, of
course, upon Edward Gibbon Wakefield must fall the honor of chief architect. He enunciated
the main principles adopted in the Act, and gave the projectors the weight of his influential
personal advocacy and support. Ihe colony was an experiment; so that it engaged the
watchful attention of many British thinkers, and consequently its projection was opposed
impetuously by all those who hated the word. For a year or two, owing to surveying
difficulties, \\ akefield s land system was not given a fair trial, but for many subsequent
years, until new conditions arose which demanded amendment, it worked with excellent
results. "South Australia, wrote Mr. J. P. Stow in "South Australia” (1883), “ became at
once an agricultural country. ... \\ ithin six years from the proclamation of the
colony it exported wheat to other Australian provinces, and has continued to do so ever
since. In comparison with Western Australia, which remained for half a century in
pitiful indigence, the Province was a brilliant success and it was not to the quality of
soil that the difference must be imputed. To the productions of Wakefield’s penetrating
mind many South Australians must ascribe their opulence and contentment.
I here were great historical characters among those who were earnest believers in
the economist s views, and they gave their valuable influence in favor of having the Province
of South Australia proclaimed. Wellington was the one commanding personality of the
time: while Grote, H. Lytton Bulwer, Rowland Hill, and several others already referred
to, attained a fame that will not quickly be forgotten. But of the incessant workers in
the local cause, Mr. Gouger, Colonel Torrens, and Mr. G. F. Angas are the principal.
1 o them, in all probability, the Province owes its existence. First, Gouger was persistent
and restless ; then I orrens labored strenuously as well with the pen as in Parliament
and among his friends ; and lastly, Angas, with uncommon enterprise and foresight, stepped
forth at a time when the outlook was most gloomy and disheartening, and initiated the
series of events which finally launched the enterprise. The last placed his wealth in the
balance, formulated the scheme which enabled the Commissioners to fulfil the demands of
the Act, and anxiously toiled, even after the Province was proclaimed. That his remarkable
faith and indomitable energy should bear abundant fruit was a just reward. In after years
he invested a large amount of capital in South Australia, came here to reside, and here he died.
1 he Directors of the South Australian Company and the Board of Commissioners,
when all the requirements of the Act had been obeyed, rapidly arranged for the settlement
of South Australia. A month after the formation of the Company, the Directors, with all
the vigor of a commercial house, had engaged a secretary and staff of clerks for the


London office, a manager—Mr. S. Stephens to take charge of its agricultural affairs in
the Province, and overseers for each department. A ship the John Pirie was under
weigh with goods, live stock, and 23 adult passengers. By February 24, 1836, another
vessel the Duke of York was freighted with whaling stores, was boarded by 38 passengers,
including Mr. Stephens and other officers of the Company, and was ready to sail. The
two pioneer ships at once put out. In March and April the ships Lady Mary Pelham
and Emma followed the pioneers, carrying stores and 51 passengers. As an instance of
unusual vitality in such affairs, this is singular and therefore noteworthy : the Imperial
Government was not responsible.
The Colonising Commissioners obtained from Lord Glenelg letters patent for
establishing the Province, and proceeded to appoint the civil officers. Colonel C. J. Napier,
the hero of many battles, was asked to take the position of Governor. He claimed that
he must be accompanied by a military force, and have the power to draw upon the British
Government for money when needful. His monetary request was reasonable, as after-events
proved ; and he thought that troops would be necessary in the community “to protect
what is good against that which is bad,” and largely because the supply of spirituous
liquors was so abundant in Australia. His stand was determined and independent : but he
was not appointed.
The next selection fell upon Captain Hindmarsh. R.N., who was eventually
commissioned. Captain Hindmarsh probably knew more about managing a man-of-war
than of governing a new province. At this time it was invariably the policy of the
British Government to appoint naval officers to the governorships of colonies, and it is
doubtful whether the qualities of such men fitted in with the peculiarities of colonial life.
Sternness, courage, and a cold unbending will, are not alone the characteristics best
adapted to governing a band of pioneers, who must be allowed an unusual amount of
liberty and personal freedom. Mechanical discipline is compulsory on board a man-of-war.
but it is not always the best thing in a new country. Without responsible Government
there was danger that a naval officer would be too autocratic as a governor.
Captain Hindmarsh had passed nearly the whole of his life on the sea, and his
daring and loyalty were beyond reproach he was never foolhardy, but he was always
brave. He was born in 1786, and while a mere child, in 1793, entered the navy as a

plucky Bellerophon, and for some time the only officer on deck was young Hindmarsh. who
was only twelve years old and with a wound in the eye which finally deprived him of its sight.

Dining this interval the L Orient caught fire, and to save his own ship Midshipman
Hindmarsh ordered the cable to be cut, and the spritsail to be set. The Bellerophon
moved away, and the enemy blew up and sank. It was recognised that he had saved the
ship, and on the same day Nelson publicly thanked the young hero. Hindmarsh shared
with Sir James Saumarez in 1801 in the actions off Algeciras and in the Straits of Gibraltar,
and in 1803 joined the Victory, bearing Lord Nelson’s flag. A few months later he was
piomoted as lieutenant to the Phoebe , commanding the boats of which he captured many
ot the enemy’s vessels, and performed brave feats at Toulon, fie took part in the battle
ot I rafalgar, and distinguished himself on subsequent occasions off the coast of France
as first lieutenant of the Beagle. He rendered notable service at the Isle of France, and
was present at the fall of Java in 1811. In 1814 he was promoted to the rank of
commander, and in 1830 was appointed to the Scylla. He was knighted in 1851, and
obtained the rank of rear-admiral in 1856.
Ihe salary of the first Governor of South Australia was fixed at PBOO per
annum, and a preliminary allowance was made of for outfit. The Colonising
Commissioners were to be represented in the Province by a Resident Commissioner, and
Mi. James Hurtle Pisher was appointed to this position. The Governor represented the
dignity and authority of the Crown ; the Resident Commissioner was invested with
administrative power of great importance to the Province. Mr. Robert Gouger. who had
worked so hard to have the colony established, was appointed Colonial Secretary.
It may be of interest to insert here the names of those gentlemen, their offices
and salaries, who were appointed to officially found South Australia. Besides Governor
Hindmarsh, Resident Commissioner and Registrar Fisher and Colonial Secretary
Gouger (A 400), there were :


On March 24, the Cygnet , with a division of the survey party and other passengers
on board, left England for South Australia; and on May 4 the brig Rapid , 16r tons,
sailed with Colonel Light. Captain Hindmarsh, Resident Commissioner Fisher, and 175
passengers followed on July 30 in H.M.S. Buffalo. The Africaine , with Mr. Gouger and
Mr. Brown, the Emigration Agent, also set sail. Thus the courageous men and their
families, who were to become the founders of a new province, the fathers of another
offshoot of a famous race, went forth to the country in the southern hemisphere, which
was lying as one not yet awakened from a long and tranquil sleep.

In 1834, soon after the Province was established, “The South Australian
Literary Association was founded in London, having* for its objects : —“ The cultivation
and diffusion of useful knowledge throughout the Colony.” Lieutenant-Colonel Napier
was the first president. Ihe Association formed a library of 11 7 volumes, and forwarded
it to Adelaide, together with a collection of philosophical apparatus. After their arrival a
“Mechanics Institute was started. I his was merged into “The South Australian
Subscription Library and Mechanics Institute,” afterwards becoming “ The South Australian
Institute,” and now known as “The Public Library and Museum.” The following is a
reduced reproduction of a page of the Minute Book, giving the names of the first
members :

founders of South Australia began their enterprise by invoking
the blessing of Almighty God. Eight vessels were en route for
I this country in a straggling procession at the same time, and the
N- - * first to arrive was the Duke of York, commanded by Captain
Morgan, which anchored in Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island, on
July 27, 1836, three days before Governor Hindmarsh left
yEngland. 1 here were on board Mr. Samuel Stephens, the
agricultural manager for the South Australian Company, 29
laborers, and eight passengers of independent means. A
~ : " av J ' magnificent rainbow appeared in the heavens, and was taken as
- «« * v,.„
a good omen. At 2 p.m. the passengers were landed, preceded
by Mr. Stephens, who was the first of the pioneer immigrant
party to actually set his foot on the shores of the Province they had come to establish.
Then all reverently joined in reading the Church of England service, and Captain
Morgan offered an extempore prayer of thanksgiving for the prosperous voyage. No
more beautiful beginning could be recorded.
On the same day that Captain Hindmarsh sailed, another vessel, the Lady Mary
Pelham , joined the pioneer ship in the island bay. The John Pirie did not arrive until
August 16. There lived on Kangaroo Island at this time a few sealers, whalers, and
convicts. Mr. Stephens erected, where he landed in Kingscote Harbor (named after a
director of the Company), a mud fort, mounted a battery, and hoisted the Union Jack.
The Rapid\ bearing Colonel Light (the Surveyor-General) and his officers, arrived
in Nepean Bay on August 20. On board, besides the Colonel, were Lieutenant Field,
K.N.; J. S. Pullen, afterwards Vice-Admiral; \V. Hill, Wm. Jacob, and C. Claughton,


surveyors; and Dr. Woodforde. Next to come was the Cygnet , bringing Mr. G. S.
Kingston, afterwards Sir G. S. Kingston; Mr. Ik T. Finniss, assistant-surveyor; Captain
Lipson, R.N., harbor-master; Mr. Edward Wright, surgeon; Mr. John Morphett,
afterwards Sir John Morphett; and Mr. Powys.
Colonel Light, to all intents and purposes, was the designer and founder of the
City ot Adelaide, and it is fitting that his memory should be cherished while one of its
buildings stands. In his work he met with such opposition and discouragement that his
days were few in number. I he Colonising Commissioners had given him specific
instructions. 1 hey required that he must first land on Kangaroo Island, and there lay
out two or three gardens in order to prove the soil. Next, he must examine those parts
of the South Australian coast that were central, and that seemed to possess the advantages
of a good harbor. Port Lincoln and Lake Alexandrina, in particular, must be visited, and
the coast scrutinised from Encounter Bay to the head of Gulf St. Vincent, and the inlet
and harbor in the Gulf so attractively portrayed by Captain John Jones was to be
carefully inspected. Upon the
he was instructed to determine

was to exercise the utmost caution in his dealings with the natives so as to prevent
collision. \\ ild animals were to be considered the peculiar property ot the aborigines, and
when any were needed for food they were to be purchased. Sporting in country
inhabited by natives was prohibited. I hen, “ when you have determined the site of the
first town, you . . . will make the streets of ample width, and arrange them with
reference to the convenience of the inhabitants, and the beauty and salubrity of the
town ; and you will make the necessary reserves for squares, public walks, and quays.”
This was the outline of his important duties which the Surveyor-General had to follow
now that he had arrived within the boundaries of the Province. Colonel Light was an
officer suited in many respects to the onerous task entrusted to him. Jealous in honor,
and determined in character, he was a clever linguist and a gallant and brave officer. He
was born in 1784, at Malacca, his father being the captain of a freetrader to India, and
his mother the daughter of King Queda, the sovereign of the Malacca Territory. The
mother was given as a dowry the island of Penang, or Prince of Wales Island, and young-
-3 o


Light subsequently derived a considerable income from its revenues. He received a high-
class education, and was often a guest at Carlton House. Entering the military service as
a cavalry officer, he served as lieutenant of the qth Light Dragoons in the Peninsular War.
He was employed in the Intelligence Department of the army, and, mixing with Spanish
families, obtained valuable information concerning the movements of the French. According
to Napier’s “ Peninsular War,” on one occasion he rode forward to ascertain the strength
O
of the Prench army, which was appearing in the distance. He approached to within 100
yards of the enemy’s front, was fired at. and, being well mounted, pretended to be wounded.
\\ ith body swaying about as if mortally wounded, he cantered wildly along the line from flank
to flank, counting the regiments as he passed. His strategy saved him from further attack ;
he gradually increased the distance between him and the French, and then setting spurs to
his horse, galloped back to the British lines. By timely warning he also saved a British
division from capture. Lieutenant Light returned to England after the peace, and, when
Napoleon escaped from Elba, was appointed Brigade-major to the Heavy Brigade. He
left the army shortly after the battle of Waterloo, and married a daughter of the Duke of
Richmond, Sir Charles Napier marrying the other daughter ; but his married life was not
happy, and he was separated from his wife. Captain Light, with Sir Robert Wilton,
proceeded to Spain, aided in the revolutionary war, and was made a colonel in the Spanish
forces. Next he accepted service in the navy of the Pasha of Egypt, where he made the
acquaintance of Captain Hindmarsh, who at this time was engaged in the same service.
Immediately upon his arrival at Kangaroo Island, although in ill health, Colonel
Light proceeded upon his work of inspection with the thoroughness that was consistent
with his character. He applied to his duty as pioneer the same comprehensive and
penetrating judgment that he had used in the army. He examined the locality on the
island chosen by Mr. Stephens, and quickly decided that it was unsuitable to the purposes
of the original and central settlement. He sailed over to and named Rapid Bay on the
mainland, and then examined the east coast of Gulf St. Vincent, studying its local features,
and catching occasional glimpses of promising inland country. The wild flowers were just
coming into bloom, and, conspicuous in brilliant coloring or delicacy of tint and structure,
added beauty to the landscape.
On September 24 Colonel Light arrived opposite an extensive flat, where
mangroves edged the water-line of an inlet. Lieutenant Field entered this inlet on the
following day, and on the 26th the Surveyor-General also went in. After passing the
channel, the latter observed what he called a wide river running a considerable distance
inland, which at first he took to be the harbor mentioned by Captain Jones ; but a hurried
examination led him to erroneously conjecture that he would have to look elsewhere for
that much-advertised spot. On the 28th, Mr. Pullen followed up another channel of the
same inlet, of which he gave a favorable report, and was thus the first to enter the
southern reach of the present harbor of Port Adelaide. Captain Jones had written that
there was ample fresh water in this river, and also an island in the inlet ; but as Colonel
57

The Founders


Light and his officers always dipped up salt water, they considered, although they had
found an island, that they had not yet come upon Captain Jones’s discovery. The
discrepancy between the two reports was probably due to the different seasons at which
the locality was visited. Captain Jones must have seen the Port Adelaide river during a
llood, while Colonel Light found it in its normal state.
Colonel Light now went farther north, still searching for Captain Jones’s river
and harbor. Then he turned back, and met Mr. Samuel Stephens and Mr. Morphett, with
whom he proceeded into Rapid Bay. The Cygnet had meanwhile reached Nepean Bay,
and as its passengers and stores had been landed at Kingscote Harbor, Colonel Light gave
instructions that they must be re-shipped. He had determined to use a part of the coast
a few miles south of Port Adelaide as a temporary depot until a site more promising
and offering superior advantages for a harbor might be discovered. After her passengers
and stores were re-shipped, the Cygnet moved up the coast and anchored in a roadstead,
which was named Holdfast Bav.
The survey officers on the Cygnet Mr. Kingston, Mr. Finniss, and others were
instructed to explore the beautiful plain which lay between Mount Lofty, in the east, and
Port Adelaide. 1 hey and the other passengers were landed in Holdfast Bay at Glenelg,
and became the pioneer settlers in Gulf St. Vincent. Their lot was similar to that of
those who have paved the way for new colonies in the United States and in the British
communities that are scattered over the earth like homesteads in a vallev. Thev were
J J
lodged on the edge of the continent; south lay the ocean ; east, west, and north were
hundreds of miles of waste land, inhabited only by an aboriginal race. To make themselves
comfortable, they put up their tents or constructed huts of reeds, bark, and branches of
trees. Wood was gathered in the bush ; water was conveyed to the camp by means of
sledges ; fires were lighted in the midst of the camp; and something like an extensive
picnic improvised in a primitive way.
Near the landing-place of the pioneers was a family of natives, who watched from
behind bushes and the employment of these people, whose appearance and habits
were to them so unique and strange; and their amazement and alarm can easily be
understood. The settlers unpacked 24 muskets, and set a guard to repulse an apprehended
attack ; but they might have saved themselves the trouble on this occasion, for the
aborigines were altogether too frightened to act on the offensive. Mr. W. Williams
wheedled one of them to enter the camp, and after the latter’s curiosity was satiated with
the wonders displayed there, and his appetite was cajoled with and educated to new kinds
of food, he went proudly back to his people, and enticed them to come and see the
spectacle. In this way the tw r o races met and instituted some sort of friendly communion.
The subsequent narrative is tedious and complicated. Several months elapsed
before the earliest arrivals and those who quickly joined them removed to a more permanent
settlement. Colonel Light and the surveyors had many difficulties to contend with, and


• ,Hi; • -

some that were unnecessary. Although they seemed to follow their duties with energy
and in a systematic manner, it was a weary time until the central site was determined on ;
• J
and in the meantime the tempers ot officials and private persons became unpleasantly ruffled.
During the month of October, Colonel Light again visited the arm of the sea
north of Holdfast Bay, and inspected the waterway upon which Port Adelaide is situated.
He trudged over the plain stretching from Holdfast Bay, and was delighted with the
prospect it presented. Then, leaving Mr. Kingston and others to thoroughly explore in the
neighborhood, he returned to Rapid Bay. He had already considered it probable that Port
Adelaide would be utilised as the main harbor for the Province, and that the city would
be built near by, being pleased with the anchorage and the appearance of the adjacent
country. Early in November he sighted the Africaine in Rapid Bay. Six passengers
from this vessel landed on Kangaroo Island, and made a long journey into the island.
They had no conception of the obstacles to be faced ; their provisions gave out, and the
way was rough and overgrown with bush. Once they slaked their thirst in the blood of

Gouger and Mr. Brown, Colonel Light inspected this river, and was greatly disappointed
to find it terminate at the Reedbeds without a navigable outlet to the sea. From the
richness of the soil, he had hoped to establish the capital upon it, especially as he could
find no suitable locality on the Port River.
Notwithstanding his conviction that the first settlement must be formed near the inlet
discovered in September, Colonel Light had to obey his instructions and examine Port Lincoln
and other localities. Again leaving Mr. Kingston (who next to the Surveyor-General
must be complimented for the choice of Adelaide) and several surveyors to further explore
on the plain, he sailed out of Gulf St. Vincent on November 25, called at Rapid and
Nepean Bays, and directed his course to the western coast of Spencer Gull. He
ascertained that, while Port Lincoln had a splendid harbor, the extremely limited quantity
of land suitable for occupation in its neighborhood was fatal to any claim it might possess
to be the capital of the new colony. He left Spencer Gulf, and, believing that no navigable
channel would be found connecting the River Murray with the sea, he determined to leave

the inspection of Encounter Bay for some future occasion, and returned to Holdfast Bay
a few days before Christmas anxious, because so many people were waiting, to finally fix
the central site. “ I felt convinced,” he wrote, “ I should not find anything more eligible
than the neighborhood of Holdfast Bay.” He almost immediately re-visited the River
1 orrens, and on December 29 decided that the capital should be built on its wooded
banks, though in carrying out this decision he was destined to meet with considerable
opposition.
Iwo or three hundred people had now congregated at Holdfast Bay, and the
camp comprised about 40 huts and tents scattered here and there without any regularity.
As it was reckoned that Governor Hindmarsh would reach his destination any time in
December, his arrival was just now eagerly expected. Colonel Eight despatched the
Cygnet , with Captain Lipson, the harbor-master, to Port Lincoln, there to await the
arrival of H. M. S. Buffalo. Each day the people on the beach looked out over the Bay
tor the first glimpse of the sails of the man-of-war, and an amusing incident is told of the
prevailing excitement ; —“ One Sunday morning, when Mr. Kingston was reading prayers
with Mr. Gilbert for his clerk, a whisper went round that an English vessel was in sight.
1 hose nearest the door began to quietly move out, followed by others, until at last the
officiating minister was left alone with his assistant, when the former threw down the
book, saying, 1 Come, Gilbert, it’s no use our staying here,’ and the two went forth
to join the throng.”
Meanwhile, the Buffalo was in sight of South Australian territory. She stood
for Port Lincoln, and on December 24 sighted the Cygnet in Spalding Cove. Captain
Lipson presented a letter from Colonel Light to the Governor, and after a rapid examination
of the delightful scenery so charmingly portrayed by Westall, Captain Hindmarsh set
sail for Holdfast Bay, the Cygnet acting as consort to the Buffalo.
The early risers among the people at Holdfast Bay were greatly excited on the
morning of December 28, to observe the sails of these two vessels cutting the horizon in
the Gulf. Soon all the people then in camp congregated on the beach and watched the
ships anchor in the roadstead. At 2 o’clock the following, with their families, under the
escort of a party of marines from the Buffalo , left the ship in three boats; Captain
Hindmarsh, the Governor; Mr. J. H. Fisher, Resident Commissioner; Mr. George
Stevenson, the Governor’s Private Secretary; Mr. Osmond Gilles, the Colonial Treasurer;
and the Rev. C. B. Howard, the Colonial Chaplain. When the vice-regal party reached
the beach a cordial welcome was offered them by the band of pioneers, headed by Messrs.
Gouger, Colonial Secretary ; Brown, Emigration Agent; Gilbert, Storekeeper ; Kingston,
Deputy Surveyor; John Morphett, and Robert Thomas.
The officials and principal people repaired to Mr. Gouger’s tent, followed by
nearly all the inhabitants, where certain necessary formalities were observed. The
Governor read the orders in Council constituting South Australia a British Province, and

mounted a chair, and gave the toast ot “ Ihe King, which was heartily responded to, and
was followed by the National Anthem. Next succeeded the toasts of “ His Excellency,
and “Mrs. Hindmarsh and the ladies.” The Governor again exclaimed, “May the
present unanimity continue as long as South Australia exists, and the plain rang with the
hearty responses of the pioneers. At about 5 o’clock Captain Hindmarsh retired to the
ship. It had been an exceedingly hot day, and the night was little better ;so that, instead
of dispersing, some of the company kept up a mild type of revelry until the light of the
following; day.
O J
The Province of South Australia was in this manner officially proclaimed on
December 28, 1836, amid the rejoicings of the little band of hardy men and women, who
were prepared and anxious to
enter upon the work of its
development. Each year, as
the anniversary of that date
comes round, the old gum tree
at Glenelg is the focal point
of a patriotic pilgrimage, the
birth of the Province is com-
memorated, and honor done
to the men and women who
inaugurated its career.
Colonel Light was not
present at the proclamation
celebration. He had pitched
his tent on the River Torrens,
where he proposed to lay out
the town, and each day he
went to and fro inspecting
the land. Mr. Kingston, the
Historic Gumtree at Glenelg
Deputy Surveyor-General, lived in an adjoining tent, and assisted in the work. On December
29, Governor Hindmarsh went inland and visited Colonel Eight on the Torrens, and expressed
his sense of the beauty of the locality, but considered that it was “ too far from the harbor ” for
J *
the purposes of the capital. He then inspected the harbor chosen by Colonel Eight (Port
Adelaide), and declared that there the city should be built. Colonel Eight pointed out that
the river overflowed its banks at the place indicated by the Governor, and a disagreement
arose between the two authorities, for Colonel Light persisted in adhering to his own
choice. In his instructions from the Colonising Commissioners the responsibility of deciding
was cast upon the Colonel, although he was desired to pay respect to the Governor’s opinion.
As a compromise, Governor Hindmarsh next proposed that a site two miles nearer the harbor
should be adopted, and Colonel Eight at first agreed ; but when he found evidences that
62

""'
at floodtime this place was liable to inundation, he reverted to his original choice.
Eventually the Governor reluctantly conceded the point to the Surveyor-General on the
understanding that a second town should be laid out at the harbor. The latter assented,
chose as the town site for the port a position a little distance away from the present
centre of Port Adelaide, and set his subordinates to work.
Governor Hindmarsh decided to name the plains stretching from the camp in
Holdfast Bay the Glenelg Plains, after Lord Glenelg. It had previously been determined,
in obedience to the wish of King William IV., to confer the name of Adelaide on the
capital city in honor of the royal consort. As a testimony to the assistance which the
Iron Duke rendered during the passage of the South Australian Act through the House
of Lords, Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield desired that the capital of South Australia
should be named Wellington. His wishes were not granted, but the name was subsequently
given to a

attractions and certain of the recommendations of Adelaide. In a letter written from the
Buffalo on January 5, 1837, to Mr. G. F. Angas, he says: —“Adelaide is to be on the bank of a
beautiful stream, with thousands of acres of the richest land I ever saw. Altogether, a more
beautiful spot can hardly be imagined.” With this opinion many travellers have since
agreed. Mr. Robert Gouger, in his work, “South Australia in 1837,” published in 1838,
puts the case of Colonel Light in a judicial manner : —“ In determining where to fix the
chief town, Colonel Light had to consider whether it was more desirable to place it away
from the harbor, but on a stream of fresh water, or at the harbor, but where all the
fresh water the inhabitants required would have to be brought from a distance. He
decided in favor of the first of these, and for many reasons he will be thanked for ii by
posterity.” A comparison between the Port Adelaide and the Adelaide of to-day will prove
to what extent the gallant colonel deserves our thanks.

Diverse views, however, still prevailed concerning the advisability of establishing the
city on the Torrens. Many colonists, and among them Mr. Gouger himself, were prepossessed
in favor of Port Lincoln, because ol the excellence of the harbor. Sir J. \V. Jeffcott, the judge,
backed up by another party, advocated the claims of Encounter Bay ; but, singular to say,
some time afterwards the judge lost his life in the “ league-long rollers which pour in
from the Southern Ocean on that coast. It was difficult for the people to divest themselves
of these preconceived notions. They were also naturally inconvenienced by having to wait
so long before they could have their land allotted to them. They became critical and
dissatisfied ; and already evidences of the spirit of democracy which prompts a demand for
each individual to have a personal influence over the work of officials began to put in an
appearance. At the end of January, 1837, about 1,000 men, women, and children were
waiting to take up their residence in the capital or on rural selections, and notwithstanding
Commemoration Day at Glenelg— the Jetty
the decisive responsibility placed in the hands of Colonel Light, they took sides in the
general dispute. It is to be assumed that they had a certain right to an expression of
opinion.
♦
As late as February, 1837, these discussions were being carried on. On Friday, the
10th of that month, a public meeting was convened by the Governor at the request of
several early purchasers of land, in the tent of Mr. Edward Stephens, J.P., which was presided
over by Mr. G. Stevenson, the Private Secretary. A resolution, proposed by Mr. T. B.
Strangways, J.P., and seconded by Mr. John Hallett, “ that the site selected for the chief
city was not such as the meeting was led to expect,” was amended, on the motion of Dr.
E. Wright, seconded by Mr. G. S. Kingston, to read “ that the selection was a good
one.” The voting counted 218 for the amendment, and 127 against it. After other

resolutions were carried declaring that land owners should be allowed to proceed to their
colonising work immediately, and that they were willing to have a portion of their town
acres surveyed at the harbor, Mr. John Brown moved, and Mr. John Morphett seconded,
1 hat this meeting considers that the Surveyor-General, William Light, Esq., has most
ably and judiciously discharged the responsible duty assigned to him by the Commissioners,
and is fully entitled to their confidence in every respect.” Notwithstanding the previous
dissension, this motion was carried, which showed that at least a substantial majority of
those present the most influential of the colonists—were willing to trust Colonel Light.
It might be said that, though the result of this public meeting gave offence to
some of the officials, it finally settled the question of the site of Adelaide. Governor
Hindmarsh, perhaps because he felt that a blow had been struck to the dignity of his
Commemoration Day at Glenelg—Looking South
power, could not let the question quietly drop, but added to the vexations already put in
the way of Colonel Light. He would have shown greater wisdom had he more carefully
considered the instructions to the latter, but for an officer to disagree with his superior
seemed to be an offence to autocracy. He proposed that the capital should be removed
to Encounter Bay, and appealed to the Colonising Commissioners in England to that
effect. At the same time he complained to them strongly about Colonel Light. His
answer was such as must have caused the flush of anger to rise to his cheeks. He was
quietly told that “ when he applied for the office of Governor he was distinctly informed
that the right of selecting the capital would be vested solely in the Surveyor-General ” ;
also that, in pressing the Board to cede this right, he was “ seeking for an extension of
power inconsistent with the principle of the Colony ” ; and that “ a Governor of South
65
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY

Australia must be content to receive and to hold his appointment subject to the condition
of non-interference with the officer appointed to execute the surveys and to dispose of
the public land.”
In the meantime, Colonel Light and his assistants had been surveying and staking
off the town acres. They began this work on January it, 1837, and completed it on
March 10 following. Colonel Light prepared the plans for the streets and squares and
terraces ; and none will deny that he did his work conscientiously and well. After an
extended and systematic search, he had chosen a delightful spot, slightly elevated above the
surrounding plain. A few miles to the east and south-east were the varied but ever-beautiful
range of hills, of which Mount Lofty, almost due east, was the highest eminence. Plains,
fertile and occasionally wooded, stretched north and south, and to the sea in the west.
Between the town and the harbor there was but little timber. Altogether, the site was a
magnificent location for a new town, and the gradients afforded excellent opportunity for
drainage. Except for its distance from the harbor, it possessed almost every advantage
asked for by the Commissioners in their instructions. The judgment of Colonel Light
is now looked upon as beyond reproach, and the present beautiful city is his best
monument.
Opinion is unanimous that Adelaide is one of the best-laid-out cities in the
Southern Hemisphere, and that its alignment of streets is in artistic sympathy with the
delightful panorama presented by the neighboring country. Colonel Light made the main
street to trail down a pretty slope to the river, and the cross streets to run east and
west, so as to afford for all time vistas through which the noble background of hills
o o
might be viewed. All the streets were at right angles. Near each corner of the city
area south of the river a square was reserved by Colonel Light, and another in the
centre five in all. Ihe site was so situated that suburban cities without number could
be built at every point of the compass, of dimensions such as no centre could ever
require. 1 hree hundred and forty-two acres of the original area lay on the north side
of the 1 orrens, in laying out which advantage was taken of the contour of the ground,
and 700 acres on the south. On every side parks 500 yards in width were reserved. Ten
acres were reserved as a Government domain in a beautiful position on the river banks,
and 200 acres were set apart for the purposes of a botanical garden. Reserves were
made for the sites of a hospital, public cemetery, Government stores, schools outside the
town, and of public offices close to the central square. Collectively, the general plan
provided all that was necessary for an imposing city to be built upon.
In March, 1837, Adelaide was merely a city of surveyors’ pegs, and of numerous
squares or blocks flanked by grass-clothed, tree-encumbered streets, that were not easy to
be distinguished. Each block acre was numbered, and the time was come when the
pioneers could select their town property, and on March 23 the first allotment was made.
As already mentioned, when the first lands were being sold in England, the purchaser of
a rural area obtained at the same time the right to a town acre. Up to 1836 some 437

of these preliminary land orders were issued, and the possessors of them had the first
right of selection.
In order to prevent dissatisfaction and accusations of favoritism, it was decided
that priority of choice should be determined by drawing lots. A plan of the town was
exhibited for public inspection. In the drawing, acre i was obtained by N. A. Knox ; the
names of the other holders of the first six acres with Mr. Knox were, respectively,
Charles Edmonds, W, H. Gray, M. I). Hill, Wm. Bunce, and Lord Stuart de Rothsay.
The South Australian Company obtained over one hundred lots, while Governor Hindmarsh
and other officials each obtained several acres. Some of the owners of these preliminary
land orders did not claim their town acres until 30 or 40 years after Adelaide was
established. When this distribution was completed, the remaining acres were sold by
auction. They were bought up with some avidity, and the sum of ,£3,594 4 s - was
realised, the prices ranging from £2 2s. to ,£l4 145., an average of about £j per acre.
Even though no developmental work worthy of the name was done in the Province during
1837, there was a land boom before the end of the year. In view of the forlorn condition
of all except the investors, this is remarkable. Town acres, which cost 12s. per acre, were
sold for ,£BO, and the sum of ,£IBO was offered and refused for one of them.
There was considerable disagreement among the officials concerning the naming
of the streets. Governor Hindmarsh and Resident Commissioner Fisher, with their
separate powers tending to a common end, were like a husband and wife afflicted with
incompatability of temper. Each claimed from Colonel Light the privilege of naming
several thoroughfares. After much squabbling, a sort of compromise was arranged ; on
May 23 the following gentlemen combined to settle the nomenclature His Excellency
the Governor, His Honor the Judge, the Colonial Secretary, the Resident Commissioner,
Colonel Light, (. Barton Hack, John Morphett, Edward Stephens, Thomas Bewes
Strangways, Thomas Gilbert, John Brown, and Osmond Gilles. As was appropriate, the
names of those who were associated with the early history of the Province were thus
immortalised. The main street was called after King William the IV. ; the names
conferred on other streets were Rundle, Hindley, Grenfell, Currie, Pirie, Waymouth,
Flinders, Franklin, Wakefield, Grote, Angas, Gouger, Carrington, Wright, Halifax, Sturt,
Gilles, Gilbert, Brown, Morphett, Hanson, Pulteney, and Hutt. The thoroughfares on the
outskirts of the main city area, and dividing it from the Park Lands, were named
North, South, blast, and West Terraces, and the four squares Hindmarsh, Light, Hurtle, and
Whitmore. The principal square in the centre of the city was named Victoria, after Her
Majesty the Queen, and the square in the Northern Division Wellington, after the victor
of Waterloo.

f\HEN the site of the capital was positively settled, many people
/ I moved their tents and weatherboard huts from Holdfast Bay, but
IN J a complete exodus took place after the allotment of city land
had been made. All this time several of the pioneers had
been residing on Kangaroo Island, and they, too, shifted their
quarters to Adelaide.
They made an odd picture as they labored over the
plain separating the seaboard from the Torrens. According to Mr.
John Wrathall Bull, there were only two horses in the Province
W in January, 1837, one the property of the South Australian
Company, the other of Mr. John Morphett. By absurd
management, also, there were very few oxen for transport
purposes. As there were so few conveyances the men had to roll, carry, or truck their
goods over the sand hills and across the plain. Those who had much were employed for
several days, and those poorly off were quickly out of the trouble. Some of the settlers
intended to build their homes on the town acres, while others preferred to reside on their
rural selections, so as to be near their agricultural, dairy, and pastoral employments. The
former could at once proceed to erect their houses, but the latter had to went still lonp-er
1
The first buildings in Adelaide were modest, and picturesquely situated. Permission
was given to the public on March 28, 1837, to cut down and grub up trees in the public
streets, but those within 16 feet of the frontage were excepted. During the next few


months men were to be seen toiling with the axe, while women were, perhaps, attending
to cooking operations under the shelter of umbrellas. Mr. Gouger records that large gum-
trees grew over the town area on an average of six or seven per acre. Most of the
buildings were erected at the west end of Bindley Street, and after some months the
alignment of the street could be judged by the unpretentious cottages and stores that had
been built. Trees overhung some of the buildings, and on stormy nights the wind roared
gloomily among their foliage. A few houses were put up in King William Street, Currie
Street, and Rundle Street, but for many years Bindley Street was the centre of trade, and
was expected to permanently hold that position. It was dangerous to walk over the remote
streets and allotments in the dark, owing to the deep holes made in grubbing the fallen
trees. Adelaide was now composed of scattered houses built of pise, concrete, and
weatherboard, and of calico tents, which, with wooden structures, predominated.
Government Bouse, one of the first buildings raised, was a curious affair. It was
constructed of “ wattle and daub,” covered thickly with thatch, and was otherwise
unostentatious. It contained three rooms, with some little offices at one end, and it stood
in King William Street at the head of the slope above the Torrens. The work of
erection was entrusted to marines from the Buffalo , who showed the proverbial want of
knowledge of their class in land employment : they actually forgot to build a chimney,
which had to be attached to an outhouse. The only public offices worth mentioning were
the Lands Office and the Surveyor-General’s Office. Most of the Government offices
were situated on the Park Lands opposite the upper part of North Terrace. Lower down
the building was erected for the South Australian Company’s School, which was presided
over by Mr. J. P. Shepherdson, and farther still the police office.
The pise houses were of earth or mud placed in a mould like concrete, with
straw sometimes mixed with it. This preparation quickly dried, under the heat of the
sun, and supplied an excellent harbor for insects. The roofs were of thatch, or of
shingles and palings imported from Van Diemen Land—splitters soon came over from
that island and began operations with the native wood on the Mount Lofty Ranges.
Reeds gathered from the Torrens and the Reedbeds were frequently placed on the roofs.
A ceiling was improvised out of calico, which flapped noisily on windy days, and calico,
also, was generally used in place of glass for windows. During the year stores were
opened ; they were small, and the goods they displayed were lacking in variety. A
single room partitioned off with curtains was utilised as a store and dwelling-house.
There were two or three wooden churches, and a newspaper had asserted its right to
existence— the forerunner of the present South Australian Register.
In 1838-9 the wooden and pise buildings looked ordinary in comparison with
newer structures of brick and stone. In sinking wells good building stone —generally
lime —was found ; and such an abundance of clay, that bricks could be easily manufactured.
The water supply was derived from the Torrens, and, when oxen and horses had arrived,
70
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Builders


was conveyed to the townspeople in specially-constructed vehicles, or was dragged by the
people themselves. Ihe latter adopted an ingenious device : a screw was fixed in each
end of a barrel, to which a line was attached, and the barrel was trundled up and down
the hill. Ihe water was execrable, what with tadpoles and other living creatures ; the
longer it rested the worse it became, and it was expensive as well.
After the advent of drays and wagons the streets were reduced to a dreadful
condition. In Hindley Street, in winter, these vehicles sank to the axle, and the animals
drawing them buried their legs in the mire. In the depressed bits of soil where the
water lodged huge bog holes were made. Clay stuck to the boots of foot passengers,
the footpaths were in little better order than the middle of the streets, and at flood time
the water ran into the houses. In the southern part of the town cattle roamed where they
would ; for there were few houses at this time in the neighborhood of South Terrace.
Early residents could not always divest themselves of the usages of old cities.
“On one of the first acres which were taken possession of and occupied, two brick
pillars, imposing by their ugliness, had been erected to form a gateway through which
to approach a wooden shanty of two or three rooms, and on one of the pillars was a
board giving notice that ‘ any person found trespassing on these grounds (/>.. a
bare acre) will be prosecuted with the utmost rigor of the law ’”— J. W. Bull.
Adelaide, with its rude houses and its fallen trees, resembled the outposts of civilisation
built in the forests of America in the early days. Between the houses there were mam-
bare allotments overgrown with grass, and in spring every corner and all the thoroughfares,
except parts of Hindley, King William, and Bundle Streets, presented a pretty green
coverlet. To-day a stony crust almost completely covers the original site of the city.
Besides building houses on city acres the pioneers did little in 1837 towards
developing or improving their possessions. The quarrel of Governor Hindmarsh with
Colonel Eight was only part of the discord which injured the Province. Lack of authority
and of good management promised to bring disaster to the colonising principles of
Wakefield. As already recorded, the constitution embraced some of the features of a
Crown colony and some of a chartered colony. The Governor was principally answerable
to the Crown, and the Resident Commissioner, who was really Minister of Crown Lands,
to the Colonising Commissioners. The title of Crown Lands was given by the Resident
Commissioner on behalf of the Colonising Commissioners in London. Substantially the
Government of the Province was confided to a Governor and a council of lead ins' men
but the administration of the lands was in important respects wholly vested in the
Resident Commissioner. Then the Surveyor-General had extensive powers, and in the
discharge of the respective duties, without an authoritative head to settle disputes,
collision and trouble were to be expected.
While yet on the Buffalo , during the voyage to the Province, Captain Hindmarsh
and Mr. J. H. P’isher managed to disagree, and, when South Australia was reached, their
71

relations, rather than improving, became increasingly strained. Ihe unanimity so
dramatically toasted by Governor Hindmarsh on Proclamation Day did not really exist, and
because the highest officials quarrelled the people followed suit. Parties were formed,
some upholding the cause of Governor Hindmarsh, some that of Mr. P isher, and some, in
survey matters, that of Colonel Light. Errors in the government were apparent, and in
the course of months became more and more serious in their effects. Work was left
undone, and necessary orders were not given. Such was the management, indeed, that
there was a want of stock for transport uses, insufficient food for the survey officers, and
ill-feeling concerning the rates of wages paid.
A principal cause of misfortune was the slowness with which the rural surveys
proceeded. Colonel Light did his utmost to complete them quickly, but he was pestered
by a dissatisfied Governor, hampered by interruptions from the people, and cramped by
having under his command an inefficient and a small staff of surveyors. In coldly calculating
the situation, it seems absurd that the Colonising Commissioners or the British Government
did not send surveyors to the Province months before the settlers were allowed to embark,
so that the city might have been laid (ait, and a rural area sufficient for the first demand
surveyed to receive them. A similar experience in Western Australia should have convinced
the authorities of the importance of this point, and the Commissioners themselves soon
recognised it, as their annual reports at this time show. Even a perfect constitution was
worth nothing to a new province unless proper preliminary arrangements were made for the
reception of the pioneers. As it was, over 2,000 people were landed in South Australia
before any but a limited number could get to work upon the soil. Some 5,000 sheep
were imported up to December, 1837, but their owners had to run them, by permission of
the Governor, on Crown lands near Holdfast Bay. Additional immigrants were constantly
arriving, and they had to waste their time and their substance in the city. They were
not provided with enough ready capital for such an emergency, and hence they were
compelled to sell their farming implements, their dairy utensils, and other goods to obtain
money to buy food. Auctioneers conducted a thriving business, and their premises were
filled with a motley variety of articles that should have been utilised by the people in
their several occupations. It is not surprising that drunkenness “ was carried to a lamentable
excess in the Province,” and Mr. Gouger adds that it was “an evil of the first
magnitude.” The Government was without money, for the parent State would not help it;
and on one occasion the Treasury had only is. 6d. in its coffers, which, once said the
popular Colonial Treasurer of the day (Mr. Osmond Gilles), was guarded by a drunken
marine from the Buffalo. The revenue of the Government was derived mainly from the
duty on spirits.
The large number of arrivals in South Australia delayed Colonel Light in his
surveys. He set his men to work marking out the rural areas close to the city, but the
vehicles introduced for the use ol the staff were diverted to convey the luggage of new
comers from the seaboard. The supplies of food required for the men were divided
72
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Builders


among the idle, and, owing to non-arrival of transports, the staff had to work on miserable
fate. 1 revisions were introduced at enormous cost from New South Wales, Van Diemen
Land, and the Cape of Good Hope. The Governor and Council voted ,£5,000 for the
purchase ot flour, horses, bullocks, wagons, and other necessaries, and appointed a committee
to select and obtain them, but these were necessarily a long time in arriving, and common
articles ot food brought prices above the means of many of the poorer class. Owing to
the demand for artisans, and the cost of living, the rates of wages rose considerably, and
the men attached to the survey staff complained, and eventually demanded an increase.
\\ hat with disaffection, lack of food, interruption, and dissatisfaction concerning wages, the
Surveyor-General’s difficulties increased weekly. Hardly any of the officials, and very few
ol the men employed by them, were in a good temper ; and a dissatisfied and sulky
man is never a willing- worker.
o
Colonel Light, while seeking to push on the surveys, was well aware that his
staff had just cause for complaint. Writing afterwards of his troubles at this time, he
said that though the men had signed in England for a wage of 12s. a week and rations,
they “ were sometimes many days with hardly anything but biscuit, sometimes not that.”
“ Not a single working bullock was to be had,” he continued, and the “ tents were all in use
by the immigrants as well as by the surveying parties.” He did what he could to
overcome these obstacles, but the rations had to be divided, not only among those who
were entitled to them by agreement, but also among immigrants. “ Humanity,” said he,
“required this, but the consequence was a cessation of work, and an apparent neglect of
duty on the part of the Surveyor-General, for which, of course, there were many
quite ready to abuse him.”
Even when a better supply of stores was obtained, Colonel Light’s troubles did
not end. He divided his party, and Mr. Finniss took charge of that which surveyed on
the west side of Adelaide, and the Colonel himself of that on the other side. Work was
then hindered by bad weather and -as their wages were lower than those ruling in the
city —by strikes among the men. Colonel Light wrote : —“ During this period I began to
feel a very evident change in my health, which, with anxieties of mind, wore me down
very much, and I was obliged to neglect many days’ working in consequence.” Still the
people waited for their rural grants, and some of those who came to the Province to
engage in agriculture were reluctantly compelled to become merchants. In November,
1837, the population was estimated by Mr. Gouger to be 2,500. Stagnation was general,
and dissatisfaction even more pronounced. One early writer says that the “ majority of
the settlers were without income, and had to live upon their capital and by the sale of
their town acres.” Rents were still very high, wages extravagant, and provisions scarce.
By November, some 300 houses had been built in Adelaide, and, with their increase,
rents temporarily fell, the land boom lost its intensity, and those who had invested in
buildings somewhat hurriedly regretted the circumstance. As evidence of the infinitesimal
amount of developmental work, besides the building of houses, carried on in 1837, it is
73
The Builders ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


sufficient to record that only seven and three-quarter acres of land were tilled, and these
in the city. The return was fair, and encouraged intending agriculturists as to the possibilities
of the soil.
A o-enoral and Pfenerous consideration of the circumstances at this distance ol
O O _
time will show that Colonel Light, instead of being the cause of this lamentable state of
affairs, was largely at times made the scapegoat, and that the Colonising Commissioners,
the Governor, and the people were at least equally blameworthy. Ihe Commissioners
should have had the preliminary surveys completed before allowing any emigrants to leave
England ; the Governor, instead of giving assistance to Colonel Light, says Mr. Hodder,
appears to have subjected him to much “ harassing interference and interruption ; and the
people, by their presence and by their wants, unconsciously hampered him in the pursuit
of his work. From the second day after his arrival Captain Hindmarsh had opposed the
Surveyor-General, and placed unnecessary obstacles in his way ; and upon one so sensitive
and so jealous the effects were most unfortunate. Already in ill health when he arrived
in the Province, Colonel Light did not improve when trouble
and anxiety fell upon him, and it was not until May, 1838,
that any extent of rural land was allotted.
An appeal was made to Resident Commissioner Fisher
to expedite the surveys. Colonel Light drew up a list of
his requirements, and it was determined to report on the
matter to the Commissioners in London, and to send Mr.
Kingston home to procure additional assistance and implements.
That gentleman sailed in October. 1837, taking with him samples
of oil obtained by the South Australian Company on fisheries
which its manager had established.
Colonel Light
After the Deputy Surveyor-General had explained his mission, the Colonising
Commissioners decided that the surveys should be carried out in a particular way, and
wrote Mr. Fisher instructing him to request Colonel Light to proceed on this new system.
If the latter objected, he was to be superseded by Mr. Kingston, and to occupy himself
with an examination of the country about Lake Alexandrina, until Mr. Kingston’s
survey was concluded.
When he received these new instructions Colonel Light was greatly affected, and
he indignantly resigned his office. All the surveyors, except three, who had recently been
appointed in England, followed his example. It was at first believed that Mr. Kingston
was to blame for the indignity put upon Colonel Light, but a Parliamentary Enquiry
Committee in England reported that “ Mr. Kingston had not attempted to undermine his
superior officer, but on the contrary, had acted loyally to him throughout ” -Stow. The
Commissioners said that “ he had acted towards his superior with scrupulous honor.”
Colonel Light, when separated from the survey staff, obtained the warm


commendations of the people, and many of those who had previously opposed him became
his supporters. A public meeting, held in Adelaide, carried by an overwhelming vote a
motion in favor of the plan of survey pursued by him, but nothing would induce him to
withdraw his resignation. Ihe Commissioners recorded that when he received his new
instructions "his energies were enfeebled by disease, and his mind in a state of nervous
Irritability from the harassing and vexatious opposition which he had to encounter
from the quarter whence he had a right to expect the most willing encouragement.”
No reflection was therefore cast upon his ability or his work, and even the Commissioners
were well aware that the gallant officer filled a most unpleasant and an onerous position.
His acceptance of the new instructions would have been tantamount to a confession of
weakness and inabilitv.
Colonel Light did not long survive. He was already in the incipient stages of
consumption, and his vexations, and, also, no doubt, the feeling that his public services had
not received their due reward, tended to hasten the progress of his malady to a fatal
issue. He became associated with a land agency firm under the style of Light, Finniss.
and Co., and undertook the survey of Port Adelaide, a work which he was not able to
complete. He gradually sank, and on October 5, 1839, died at the age of 54 years.
\\ hen on his deathbed he pathetically and anxiously asked to be acknowledged as the
founder of Adelaide, and requested that a copper plate, bearing an inscription to that
effect, should be laid by his side on the coffin.
I his simple and fair request was obeyed; and it
was a tardy and modest enough recognition. His
funeral was largely attended ; public sympathy being
all the greater because it was generally considered
that he came to an untimely end mainly through the
o' o' O
indignities he had endured. He was buried in Light
Square, where an obelisk to his memory was erected,
bearing the inscription :

Monument to Memory of Colonel Light

Apart from this mute public acknowledgment of his splendid services, many
historians have borne corresponding testimony. Mr. J. W. Hull, a pioneer of 1839,
75
The Bui,ders ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


writes : —“ Of Colonel Eight’s zeal and efficiency in the service there can be but one
opinion, and his bearing was always that of a most efficient officer and a gentleman.” Mr.
Gouger, Mr. Stow, Mr. H odder, besides Mr. I>. T. Einniss and other pioneers of
South Australia, who recognised the difficulties under which he labored, agree in their
laudatory remarks concerning the unfortunate Surveyor-General, the founder of the City of
Adelaide.
Before Colonel Light’s death, however, there were other changes in the
administration. The evils of divided authority were quickly apparent, even to the
Colonising Commissioners in England. Complaints were made against the Governor and the
Resident Commissioner. Those concerning Captain Hindmarsh blamed him for interfering
with the Surveyor-General, for assuming some of the powers delegated to the Resident
Commissioner, for incurring expenses without authority, and for suspending and discharging
public officers without sufficient cause. The Commissioners laid these complaints before
the Secretary for the Colonies, Lord Glenelg, and asked that Captain Hindmarsh be
recalled. Mr. hisher (who in 1837 was thought to have committed an error of judgment
in putting the town lots up for auction before a larger congregation of people had arrived),
as an enquiry made some years later proved, was undeserving of blame, but the Commissioners
dismissed him Irom office. At the same time the Board, aware of the anomaly of the
situation, advised that the duties of Resident Commissioner should henceforth be confided
to the Governor. Lord Glenelg agreed with this view, and the new Governor was
gazetted to the two offices.
I he Secretary for the Colonies wrote to the Province, recalling Captain Hindmarsh,
and the news reached Adelaide in June, 1838. After receiving a complimentary address
from a number of colonists, Captain Hindmarsh left South Australia on July 14, in H.M.S.
Alligator , and Mr. G. M. Stephen, Advocate-General, administered the affairs of the
Province during the interregnum. Although the retiring Governor’s term of office was not
satisfactory, it must not be assumed that he was entirely in error. He held a difficult
position, and one, like the others, that was extremely unpleasant. Those who permitted
decisive administrative authority to be vested in more than one person merit censure, for
he would have to be uncommonly tolerant, patient, and modest who, in a Crown colony,
could calmly fill such high offices as Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and be surrounded
by subordinates in name who were independent in fact. Captain Hindmarsh, while interested
in the prosperity of South Australia, could not brook, being a naval officer, so unusual
and anomalous a situation. \\ ith independent judgment he would have been more
successful, but he was in the wrong place. He was appointed Governor of Heligoland,
and died at the age of 78 years, or 71 years after entering the service of his country.
Mr. Fisher, after being relieved from his appointment, devoted his attention to
the law, which he had practised in England. He became leader of the local Bar, and
pursued a distinguished career in the Province until his death in 1875. In November,
1837, Mr. Gouger, the energetic projector, was suspended from office, and returned to
76
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Builders


England. George Milner Stephen, son-in-law of Captain Hindmarsh, filled the office of
Administrator of the Government from July 16 to October 17, 1838. Though the population
during that period exceeded 4,000 persons, there were no funds in the Treasury, and the
salaries of the public servants had to go unpaid. Mr. Stephen helped to arrest party
strife and Internal quarrelling, but he became entangled in a private land transaction, which
brought upon him the censure of the people and the press.
When Lord Glenelg decided to recall Captain Hindmarsh, the Colonising
Commissioners looked about for another Governor, and finally chose Lieutenant-Colonel
Gawler, who sailed for the Province in the ship Pestonjee Bomanjee. This gentleman
came of a military family. His father, Captain Gawler. of the 73rd Regiment, led one of
the storming parties at the siege of Seringapatam, and his uncle was killed at the siege
of Quebec under General Wolfe. Colonel Gawler was born in England in 1796, and
was educated at the Military College, Great Marlow. He joined the 52nd Eight Infantry
in 1811, served in the Peninsular War, took part in the battles of Vera. Vittoria, Nivelles,
Orthez, and Toulouse, besides minor engagements. He led, as an ensign, the forlorn
hope at the storming of Badajoz, and, being struck with grapeshot in the right knee, fell
from the parapet into the ditch below. There he lay until morning, when a private
saved him at the expense of his own life. Gawler was present at Waterloo, and
commanded the right company of the 52nd during the famous charge of the Imperial
Guards. At the close of hostilities he received the war medal with seven clasps, was
afterwards appointed for three years Governor of one of the North American provinces,
and subsequently followed literary pursuits.
On the evening of October 12, 1838, the Pestonjee Bomanjee reached Holdfast
Bay. The passengers remained on board through the night ; on the sandhills above the
shore was a panorama of fires lighted for beacons to incoming vessels. No preparations
were made to publicly receive Governor Hindmarsh at the seaboard or in the city. But
an unofficial band of about 20 mounted colonists rode down the track towards Glenelg.
Presently they observed a considerable dust approaching, caused by the new Governor and
an escort mounted on horseback at a hard gallop. The party dashed by the colonists at
such a speed that they said to one another;—“ This will be a fast Governor” J. W. Bull.
The prediction came true.
At the humble building known as Government House a concourse of settlers and
aborigines welcomed the new arrival. Colonel Gawler delivered a suitable address to the
white people, and then turned to the blacks. With the assistance of an interpreter he
told them that he came from the great Queen, that she loved her black people, and that
they must also love her white people. It is doubtful whether the natives understood his
meaning, but when he waved his cocked hat with its white feather, and ordered a supply
of food to be given them, one, perched upon a crooked overhanging tree, cried enthusiastically,
“ Plenty tucker. Berry good cockatoo Gubbernor.”

Colonel Gawler formally began his work on October 17. He was presented with
several addresses, all expressing the hope that he would inaugurate a new era in the life
of the colonists, that he would remove all vexatious hindrances, and establish a policy that
would lead to prosperity. Above all things, it was for him to effectually dispel the spirit
of discord. His position was a grave one, notwithstanding that the capital city had been
fixed, that numbers of people had entered upon their country selections, and that
experiences had been gained which were as milestones to judge by. Because of these
things, and as he was vested with the authority of Governor and Commissioner ol
Crown Lands, there could be no excuse if he quarrelled with his officers.
The condition of the finances was critical. The Commissioners gave him enlarged
financial powers. They declared South Australia to be In principle a self-supporting
Province, but, when the revenue fund was insufficient to pay accounts fully due, they said
he could draw upon the Emigration Fund, and when that was insufficient he could draw
bills of exchange upon the Commissioners, although no accounts so drawn were to
aggregate more than ,£2,500 per quarter, or ,£IO,OOO per year.
In a letter written to the Commissioners within a fortnight of his arrival,
Colonel Gawler referred to the state of the Province. The constant stream of
immigrants had again increased the value of city property, and the profits of capitalists
were great. Provisions, wages, and house rent were exceedingly high. Some 21,000
acres of even the preliminary land purchases were unsurveyed, and very many of the
subsequent purchases were unprovided for. Though the public officers were much beyond
the authorised number, Governor Gawler was convinced that, with the consent of the
Council, he must keep, and probably increase, them. To retain the servants of the
Government, he must increase their salaries proportionate with those of private individuals.
His instructions, he wrote, permitted him to draw on England to the amount of ,£IO,OOO
per annum, and yet upwards of ,£12,000 had already been drawn for the year 1838.
“The Treasury,” he continued, “is absolutely empty, and public debts to a considerable
amount have been incurred ; urgent demands are made for payment, and the credit of
Government is therefore injuriously low.” He was persuaded that the prospects of the
colony were most promising, and he was confident that a proportionately large revenue
might be raised. But until care and exertion reduced public expenditure, he concluded, “1
must surpass my instructions, and look to England for considerable unauthorised
pecuniary assistance.”
Further examination proved to Colonel Gawler that the situation was more
complicated than he at first supposed. In managing the public departments there had
been a lack of system ; records of public accounts and of the issue of stores had been
badly kept ; complications had arisen in the disposal of land because the surveys could not
keep pace with the demand ; the town was congested with immigrants who were leaving
the country districts ; capital was flowing to Sydney and Van Diemen Land for the
necessaries of life as rapidly as it arrived from England ; a gaol, a Government House,
78
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Builders


and new landing-places at the seaboard were absolutely required ; and, with all these, the
tide of immigration was still sufficient to tax the resources of a colony possessing the most
perfect organisation.
Several events during the period of these disputes and changes in the administration
deserve to be noted. Ihe conveniences established at the port were few in number and
modest in pretensions. Agreeable to the request of the public meeting held in February,
1 S 37 - Governor Hindmarsh and Resident Commissioner Fisher permitted holders of
preliminary land-orders to select town acres at the port. Colonel Light surveyed the
town site, and 29 acres were taken up there by preliminary holders in 1837. On May 25
of that year, Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed the harbor a legal port, and thus Port
Adelaide came into being. No landing conveniences existed either there or at Holdfast
Ray. Ihe latter place was invariably used for disembarking passengers until 1839. The
vessels anchored some distance from the shore ; passengers were conveyed in boats to the
beach, and carried through the surf pick-a-back to dry ground, being, of course, at the
mercy of the carriers, who might drop them into the water if they chose. When wagons
and drays had oxen to draw them they were driven through the surf to the boats and
loaded with passengers and goods. Upon the beach new arrivals were generally welcomed
by bands of aboriginals, who seemed to find great amusement in watching the proceedings.
Indeed, they apparently viewed this ingress of the “pale faces” more as a dramatic
entertainment provided for their pleasure than as a menace to their welfare. They were
already being educated to white ways, and pertinaciously begged for biscuits and tobacco.
The immigrants either walked over the plain to Adelaide, or were carried in bullock-
drays. I here were no fences and no clearly-defined tracks, and the vehicles could cut
across country just as their drivers wished. Numbers of pioneers had to remain on the
beach for days, protecting their luggage and goods, until they could be removed to the
city. The Government, to house the increasing number of immigrants, erected wooden
buildings on what was known as “ Immigration Square,” situated on the park lands west
of Hindley Street. There were over 20 of these buildings in the square in 1838, and
30 or 40 in 1839-40, and in them new comers had shelter until they entered upon the
particular work they were to follow in the Province. In 1838, 3,154 emigrants left
England for South Australia. Numbers of German families arrived from Hamburg under
the care of the Rev. Mr. Kavel. They were enabled to emigrate principally by the
assistance and generosity of Mr. G. F. Angas. Not a few of these successful colonists
owed their contentment and prosperity to that large-minded gentleman. Two ships, the
Zebra and the Prince George , arrived from Hamburg in November and December, 1838,
and others in 1839 and later years. The German immigrants formed settlements at
Klemzig, Hahndorf, Fobethal, Bethanien, Langmiel, and other places.
Early in the existence of old Port Adelaide, which was situated two or three
miles up stream from the present Port, the Government cut a small canal or ditch to
enable lighters to discharge on dry ground. A wharf was formed of the silt taken out,
53
Theßuilders ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


and the total cost of this work was about But this rude wharf was not altogether
satisfactory. The boats could only approach it at high tide, and then there was danger
of the goods being submerged and damaged. As the boats had to be rowed or towed
several miles, and as the tide waited for no man, delay was frequently experienced in
getting them to the wharf. Bullock-drays were used to remove the goods, and sand hills
had to be crossed. In 1838 a few wooden buildings dotted the sand here and there, one
of which was dignified with the name of Customs House. I here were a few offices for
agents, and one or two public-houses. After the site of Adelaide was fixed on the
Torrens, colonists exultantly praised its selection, because its public-houses would be
removed from the contagion of the seafaring men who frequent a seaport town, but on
this point it is to be assumed that people in England were misled. In maps circulated
there the Torrens was portrayed as an expansive sheet of water with vessels riding
majestically at anchor under Government House. When those who had seen this plan
arrived in the Province, they were disappointed to come to anchor in so ordinary a place
as Port Adelaide or Holdfast Bay, or to observe the Torrens as a very humble little
stream choked with reeds. The river was not then so pretentious as now.
Among the new arrivals were people from New South Wales and Tasmania.
Unfortunately, a few convicts were attracted, and they caused considerable annoyance to
the colonists. They stole with impunity, and were addicted to drink. Governor
Hindmarsh had a few marines from the Buffalo on shore, and used them as a body
guard. For some time they acted the part of police, but if report be true, they should
have been among the first to be locked up. They were almost as drunken as the
convicts, and one settler records the circumstance of meeting three of them at night in
the open in charge of a prisoner. The four men were so drunk that they could not keep
awake, and so they slept the night through, and in the morning the marines presented their
prisoner for trial. On one occasion, when what were known as Vandemonian (Tasmanian)
convicts openly threatened the authorities, the Riot Act was read by the Advocate-General.
This did not produce the desired effect, and Governor Hindmarsh ordered the marines to
fire upon them, and a few were wounded, arrested, and sentenced to short terms of
imprisonment. Drink was so abundant, licences were granted with so little discrimination,
and the wages obtained by these dangerous men were so high, that they could give
themselves up to long periods of debauchery. Shortly after the riot episode the
Government store was broken into, and firearms and ammunition were stolen. Three men
entered the hut of the Sheriff, Mr. S. Smart, and fired at and slightly wounded him. A
few settlers were sworn in as special constables, and two of the men, including Michael
Magee who fired the shot, were captured, while one, named Morgan, escaped to Encounter
Bay. Magee was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to be hanged, while three constables
were deputed to proceed to Encounter Bay to capture Morgan, dead or alive.
The three constables who pursued Morgan, captured him, with the aid of another
convict, near the whaling stations at Encounter Bay. Two other men, who were wanted
80
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Builders


foi crimes committed in Adelaide, were also arrested. Thus encumbered, the constables
started on the long and tedious journey overland to Adelaide. Although several colonists
had already accomplished this task, very little was known concerning the best route to be
taken. Morgan offered to guide the constables, and they, accepting, were led some distance
out of the course. When they discovered their mistake, Morgan refused to budge, and,
notwithstanding threats of shooting him or of being left there to starve, he persisted.
Ihe hardihood of this man was remarkable. The position of the constables had become
desperate, for they possessed barely a day’s rations, and had an unknown distance to
travel. After entreating and threatening him, they made Morgan fast to a young gumtree
by passing his arms around it and locking his wrists with handcuffs, and then pushed on
to Adelaide and reported themselves to Governor Hindmarsh, who expressed great horror
at the tale. He immediately called a Council, when it was decided to establish a regular
police force. A horse was purchased for Mr. Inman was appointed Superintendent
of Police, and arrangements were made to dispatch him and others back to the prisoner,
hour days after being left, Morgan was found alive by the constables. He confessed
contrition for his obstinate conduct. His sufferings had been fearful ; he had frantically
struggled to snap his shackles, but they cut deeper and deeper into his flesh. At night
he had to keep wild dogs off by kicking and tramping around the tree ; by day the flies
perched upon his raw wrists, and, when they retired, mosquitoes continued the assault.
Morgan was sentenced to transportation for life.
Some difficulty was at first experienced in obtaining men to join the regular
police force, of which Henry Alford became A No. i. When Governor Gawler arrived
he re-organised the staff, increased the number of men, and appointed Major O’Halloran
Commissioner of Police. Ihe convicts, in the capacity of bushrangers, continued to afford
trouble during subsequent years.
Besides the journeys, incidentally mentioned, to Encounter Bay, other trips or
unofficial explorations were made during 1837-8. Intending pastoralists and agriculturists
who were waiting for land to be allotted them went into the country largely to find places
that seemed most promising for their purposes. During the year 1837 the settlers visited
and named after pioneers Hurtle, Morphett, and McLaren Vales, and reached Mount
Barker in the east, Lyndoch Valley in the north-east, and examined the coast of the
gulf to a considerable distance in the south. Sheep and cattle soon browsed on the sites
of the present suburban towns, and from seven and three-quarter acres tilled in 1837, the
area rose to 8t acres in 1838.
A journey of considerable importance was made in 1838. Except Captain Sturt,
no one had travelled over the country separating settlement in New South Wales and
settlement in South Australia, but the demands of the local community quickly interested
courageous travellers. Members of a party, under Mr. Joseph Hawden, who started from
the former colony on January 26. 1838, were the first of many brave and daring bushmen
who traversed this tremendous distance. It was during these journeys through hundreds


of miles of unknown country that the most romantic and adventurous episodes in
Australian history were enacted. A way had to be forced through thick bush, dangerous
natives had to be fought, large rivers had to be forded, waterless stretches had to be
crossed, and all the time the utmost care had to be exercised to nurse the strength of the
stock. I his subject has been the theme of many Australian tales. Mr. Hawden was
accompanied by nine men, and drove before him 325 bullocks, cows, heifers, and horses,
fie proceeded to the Coulburn and the Murrumbidgee, followed the left bank of the
latter, and crossed the Murray near its junction with the Darling. He discovered two
lakes, and named one Victoria, after Her Majesty, and the other Bonney, after Mr. C.
Bonney. He reached Adelaide on April 3, 1838. Mr. E. J. Eyre and Captain Sturt
each conducted a party with cattle from New South Wales to Adelaide during the ensuing
few months. These parties supplied useful information to the Governments concerned
relative to the pastoral and agricultural capabilities of the territory passed through. In
October, 1838. there were estimated to be 22,500 sheep, 2,175 cattle, and 233 horses in
South Australia.
Of all the attempts made to develop the country, those of the South Australian
Company were probably the most earnest. Through its projector, Mr. G. E. Angas, it
had given the first impulse towards establishing the Province, and it now sought to further
enhance its value by forming the nucleus of local prosperity. Because of the delay in
land surveys it could not at first pursue all the developmental work set forth in the
prospectus. In 1837 Mr. McLaren, chief commercial manager, arrived in the Province,
and there followed him ship-builders, vine-dressers, orchardists, fishermen, schoolmasters,
mechanics, and laborers. As early as December 26, 1836 (before the proclamation of the
Province), the Company shipped from Kangaroo Island to Van Diemen Land three
barrels of salted fish, containing 1,359 mullets and 605 lbs. of skipjacks. It established
whaling stations in Encounter Bay and, later, at Thistle Island ; introduced pure merino
rams and ewes from Saxony, as well as excellent breeds of Eeicester and South Devon
sheep ; planted orchards ; and erected numbers of buildings. The Company was so
prominently associated with the Province, that everything it owned was familiarly referred
to as the “Company’s. Originally it possessed 102 town acres in Adelaide, and 13,770
country acres; and when the town lands were sold in March, 1837, it purchased 66
additional town acres.
Soon after its formation it was declared that the Company would establish a bank
in South Australia; and on January 12. 1837, the ship Coromandel arrived in Holdfast
Bay with a supply of specie and small notes, aggregating ,£IO,OOO in value, with the
entire plant of the bank, and a framed banking-house. A building was erected, and Mr.
c 2 O
Edward Stephens was appointed cashier and accountant. The bank was one of issue,
discount, deposit, and loan, and undertook the collection of small debts. It supplied the
place of a savings bank, and offered loans to settlers on the security of property ;it
assisted the Government at reasonable rates, and Governor Hindmarsh obtained ,£5,000
from it. Ihe bank at once became a medium of exchange between Great Britain and the

Province, and had agencies in various countries. Its affairs multiplied and yielded large
profits, and in 1841 the Company established it on an independent footing as the South
Australian Banking Company.
The pioneers of South Australia were, as a rule, men of strong religious
convictions, and as soon as they had become concentrated in the capital they made
preparations for the erection of places of worship. Within a few years all the principal
religious sects of Great Britain had taken root in the Province. That Adelaide should
be sometimes called a city of churches is natural. The minds of many of the projectors
in England were considerably influenced by their religious views when they advocated
the formation of a new colony ; indeed, they were influenced almost as much by religious
and philanthropic ideas as by commercial and industrial interests. This was especially so
in the case of Mr. G. F. Angas, and the religious strain among the pioneers is to be
observed in many of their journals.

meanwhile a chaplain, the Rev. C. B. Howard, had been appointed at a salary of A 250
a year, to be paid out of colonial funds. This was the only special privilege given to
the Anglican Church, but it established a connection between Church and State.
The Rev. Charles Beaumont Howard was a zealous, broad-minded, and amiable
ecclesiast. He arrived with Governor Hindmarsh in the Buffalo , and speedily set about
finding a temple for worship. Laymen had conducted service at various places before
this, and it would seem to be true of the pioneers that wherever a score or so of them
were gathered together, someone rose up to preach the Gospel. Ihe Rev. C. B.
Howard, as pioneer, had an arduous task. When the people had been in Adelaide only
a few weeks, and before they had settled on their town acres, he vainly tried to obtain
a suitable building wherein to commence his ministerial duties. Eventually he borrowed
83
The Builders ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


a large sail from the captain of a ship in port, but, in the absence of conveyances and
of laborers, he had extreme difficulty in transporting it to the city. Mr. Osmond Gilles,
the Colonial I reasurer, came to his assistance. Placing the heavy sail on a truck, the
I reasurer and the chaplain dragged the load seven miles along a dusty track in hot
weather. The Treasurer, who is described as a stout and jolly man, was the poler, while
the chaplain, at the end of a rope, was the leader. Puffing and growing weary, they
plodded along, but in descending a gully at Hlndmarsh an accident happened. The poler
vainly tried to hold the load back ; the pace increased until presently the Treasurer lay
sprawling on the ground. “As neither poler nor leader was hurt, they sat down and
had a hearty laugh while the fallen one dusted himself " —(. W. Bull. Then, with the
utmost good humor, they continued and completed their arduous journey. The sail was
rigged on North Terrace, and next day (Sunday) the chaplain conducted service in this
strange temple. A wooden church was soon afterwards erected by subscription, but, as
it was too small, the authorities determined to put up a stone structure. Mr. Pascoe St.
Leger Grenfell donated an acre at the corner of Morphett Street and North Terrace, and
upon it the foundation-stone of “the Church of the Holy Trinity’’ was laid by Governor
Hindmarsh on January 26, 1838. Mr. Gilles and Mr. Howard made themselves
responsible for ,£I,OOO of the cost of this building. Subscriptions did not come in so
rapidly as was expected, and when on his deathbed in 1843 the rev. gentleman was
served with a writ for the amount. “The Rev. Mr. Howard abounded in Christian
charity, and consequently was beloved and respected even by those of the colonists
outside our communion ” —-J. W. Bull. Trinity Church became one of the great and antique
landmarks of the city.
After the Anglican Church, adherents of the Wesleyan denomination were among
the first of other sects to conduct religious services in the Province. The work was
commenced by laymen, and early in 1837 funds were collected for the erection of a chapel
and schools. A neat brick building was opened in Hindley Street, at the rear of the
South Australian Bank, mainly by the liberality of Mr. E. Stephens and a few others.
Mr. D. McLaren, manager ol the South Australian Company, Mr. J. C. White, and other
local preachers and class leaders ministered to the people on Sundays, and occasionally
on week-nights. A regular minister was provided In an unexpected and a romantic
manner. The Rev. William Longbottom, after laboring for years in India, was compelled
to seek a more temperate clime for the benefit of his health. He removed to Tasmania,
whence, after recuperating, he was instructed to proceed to Western Australia to take
charge of a circuit there. With his wife and child he embarked in the Fanny , and on
June 9, 1838, left Van Diemen Land. When off Kangaroo Island, on the 16th, the
vessel encountered a succession ot heavy gales, increasing in fury, until great seas
broke on board on the 21 st, and the ship became a wreck on the southern coast of
the mainland, east of the mouth of the River Murray. A low, dark ridge of land
was observed from the fore-rigging, and the captain sprang into the waves with the
intention of getting a line on shore. The rope was too short, and the captain had to
58
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Builders


leave it and swim for his life. Two sailors then managed to get to the beach with a
rope, and soon the whole ship's company was landed, but not before Mrs. Longbottom was
immersed in the water. After several days of bitterly cold weather and extreme vicissitude
the forlorn party reached the whaling station in Encounter Bay, whence they were conveyed
to Adelaide by boat. The Rev. William LongTottom, his wife and child, received a warm
J o
welcome in the capital. In the disaster they had lost all their worldly possessions, but a
subscription recouped them for their losses. The Wesleyans importuned the reverend
gentleman to become their pastor, and he almost immediately began his duties in the little
church in Bindley Street. He soon concentrated and strengthened the flock, but ill health
compelled him to go to Tasmania. He returned to Adelaide, and here he died in 1849.
He was practically the founder of the Wesleyan Church in South Australia.
The Rev. Thomas Quinton Stow, the founder of the Congregational Church,
was, however, the second pastor to arrive in South Australia. His story is as useful as
the preceding in showing of what sterling material the early ministers of religion were
made. Arriving in Adelaide on October 16, 1837, he was as zealous a pioneer as the
Rev. C. B. Howard. It was a matter of surprise to early settlers that one so talented
and also so popular as a preacher should have been induced to leave England ; and the
explanation is probably to be found in the religious enthusiasm of the man, whom neither
toil nor privation could daunt. Though supported by the Colonial Missionary Society, as
well as by free-will offerings, Mr. Stow, rather than encroach on the former, was compelled
by the want of money to go out of the usual grooves. Thus Mr. J. W. Bull mentions that
for years he educated a few private pupils, and “afterwards engaged in farming until the
times of struggling and depression in the colony had passed away and the pioneer
Independent Church and congregation became self-supporting.” To get a building for
a church was no easy matter. The first structure was composed of pines and reeds, and
Mr. Stow worked “ with the laborers and the carter in cutting reeds and pines and loading
them.” Previous to that he conducted service in a large marquee, or field-officer’s tent,
which he had brought with him. Mr. Stow instilled a self-reliant spirit in his flock ; he
became a prominent colonist, and was one of the most capable opponents of the principle
of State aid to religion introduced by Governor Robe. He died in 1862, and Stow
M emorial Church in Flinders Street is a monument to his zeal.
With the German immigrants in 1838 arrived Pastor Ravel, who therefrom
became their spiritual teacher. The Rev. Mr. Ravel was the founder of the Lutheran
sect in the Province. He took up his residence at Rlemsig, where he made himself
greatly beloved, and, to the advantage of South Australia, he published and had circulated
in Germany a neat pamphlet containing statistical information relative to the country of
his adoption.
Among the first settlers were a goodly number of Roman Catholics. During
1837-9 their spiritual wants were attended to by Mr. Phillips, whose house served as an
oratory. In 1839 the Catholic inhabitants deputed Messrs. Phillips, Johnson, and Counsell


to “ make known the great need of a priest in their midst,” and through them a petition
was sent to Archbishop Folding in Sydney. As an outcome, the Very Rev. W. B.
Ullathorne, I).!)., visited the flock in June, 1840. Writes the venerable gentleman :
“ A very large room was given us by a liberal Protestant, where I erected a
temporary altar, where, surrounded by crockery, hardware, and miscellaneous articles, I
preached my first public sermon in the capital of South Australia.” After organising the
Catholics to collect the means to erect a place of worship, Dr. Ullathorne returned to
Sydney. “ The Rev. Mr. Benson was duly appointed by the Vicar Apostolic, and left
Sydney by the brig Dorset , February 14, 1841, for his mission in South Australia. lie
was a quiet, delicate gentleman, and scarcely ever left the city. He hired a wooden
building which stood near the corner of Topham and Waymouth Streets, and lived in a
small slab hut in rear of his temporary chapel. The building will be remembered by old
colonists as having previously served for a time as a police court. Father Benson’s
health completely gave way during the heat of January, 1843. He returned to Sydney
in the following April, and afterwards left for England, and died at Wolverhampton in
1868. at the ripe age of 73.” Thus Dr. Ullathorne and the Rev. Mr. Benson founded
the Roman Catholic Church.
Mr. D. McLaren, besides his assistance to the Wesleyans, was practically the
founder of the first Baptist Church. The congregations first met in the School Society’s
building in the park lands, but after the Wesleyans vacated the chapel in Hindley Street
they took charge of it. The Rev. George Stonehouse arrived in 1845 to take control.
The Rev. Ralph Drummond, described as a divine of the John Knox stamp, was
the first minister of the United Presbyterian Church. He arrived in June, 1839, and
commenced service in a small building in Angas Street. So earnest in his work was he,
that to meet scattered members of his Church he frequently walked to the Finniss, to
Strathalbyn, and Mount Barker. He died in 1872, at the age of 80 years. The first
minister of the Established Presbyterian Church of Scotland was the Rev. Robert Hainingf,
J Ci
who landed at Port Adelaide in 1841. He held his opening services in Trinity Church,
North Terrace —a happy arrangement suggestive of true Christian union. The congregations
subsequently met in Hindley Street, but in 1844 an edifice was erected in Grenfell Street.
Mr. Haining died at Glenelg in 1874.
These, in their order, were the first Churches established in South Australia. In
after years various other denominations were founded. Magnificent places of worship
have been erected in recent years. According to the census of 1891, the number of
persons (over a thousand) representing different denominations were: Church of England,
89,271: Wesleyan, 49,159: Roman Catholic, 47,179: Lutheran, 23,328 ; Presbyterian,
18,206: Baptist, 17.757; Bible Christian, 15,762; Congregational, 11,882: Primitive
Methodist. 11,654: Salvation Army, 4,356; Church of Christ, 3,367: and Confucians,
etc., 3.884.


While the white people were establishing themselves in the country and forming
a base from which they gradually stretched out their energy and occupied the whole land,
the black man looked on with indifference and even with amusement. His care for the
morrow was so slight that he probably gave this question of settlement by the Europeans
no serious thought whatever. He was interested, and he was fed by strange foods ; his
thirst was slaked by strange liquids ; and he sometimes had soft blankets put upon him.
One or two cases of murder of white people had already been chronicled, but they did
not equal the cruelty practised by whalers and sealers on native women. Crime if such
a strong term be permitted —was as yet mostly on one side.
Although in the Act constituting the Province no provision was made for the
native families, the Colonising Commissioners, the Governor, and the Directors of the
South Australian Company were careful in issuing humanitarian instructions to their
officers. Troubles with natives In Western Australia, whence grave and exaggerated
accusations of the cruelty of the white people were constantly coming, caused the authorities
to strive that South Australian settlement should not be stained by any record of inhumanity.
They wished that the foundation should be free of everything that would allow even Exeter
Hall people to point the finger of scorn at it. In the land regulations provision was made for
native reserves, but these were not yet necessary. In common with the recently-established
policy of the British Government, a Protector of Aborigines was appointed, but in practical
results his work had been small. Though there was no violent or general conflict between the
whites and blacks, the beginning had been made of what must end in the extermination of the
aborigines. Besides taking possession of their tribal grounds and frightening their
animals back into the remote country, the British had taught them some of the vices
of civilisation. We read of sailors from the Buffalo offering them not only food but
strong spirits. We hear of other people, who ought to have known better, getting
hilarious amusement from making them drunk. We read also that at first they refused
the spirits, but they very soon acquired a passion for them. Such was the beginning.
The aftermath of continual drunkenness is known ; the effects of the new foods in precarious
quantities impaired their constitutions. In 1837 Governor Hindmarsh was greatly shocked
when several white men, who had been out in the bush, were followed into Adelaide by
a party of naked blacks. He ordered the Government Storekeeper to supply them with
clothing, which, when brought forth, was put on them by Buffalo men. The blacks
disliked such impedimenta , and the clothes were thereupon exchanged for blankets. In
later years it became the policy of colonial Governments to periodically give blankets to
natives. The gift is a kind but hardly a wise one. In winter the native wears his
blanket, wet or dry ; and a wet blanket, especially to a decadent people, is as deadly as
poison. Instead of woollen materials, surely a gift of tanned animal skins would be healthier.
The natives inhabiting the territory contiguous to Adelaide were generally
peaceable. On no occasion were they so treacherous or so thieving as natives in Western
Australia and Queensland. The same white men referred to as bringing natives before

Governor Hindmarsh in Adelaide were greatly alarmed when they met the family in the bush.
They stood side by side with muskets ready to shoot and “ die like men ” as the narrator, Mr.
J. W. Bull, says. Eight warriors of the family came forward, and Mr. Allen (subsequently
the manager of the Adelaide Botanical Gardens) for some time “addressed the blacks’
leader, repeating that they (the whites) had landed to introduce Mr. Wakefield’s principles
of colonisation, and that they begged to apologise for the intrusion on their country.” As,
of course, the natives did not understand English, and knew less of colonising principles,
Mr. Allen’s speech was either a very poor joke, or was ludicrous in its silliness. The
natives approached the white men, placed their fingers on their faces to see if any pigment
came off, examined their hats and garments, and opened their waistcoats and shirt-fronts
to discover if they were white all over—“at which Mr. Allen expressed great anger, saying
he had never been treated in such a manner before ! ” Altogether, the whites about
Adelaide were undisturbed by the blacks.

HEN Governor Gawler arrived in the Province the country
area had still to be marked out before the land purchases
Colonising Commissioners. A man of keen observation
and penetration, he attacked with vigor the problem which the Province presented. The
Duke of Wellington, under whom he served for many years, had such a high opinion of
his judgment and general merits, that he declared that Gawler could not make a mistake.
Upon the retirement of Colonel Light, Mr. G. S. Kingston became Acting
Surveyor-General, but soon after Captain Sturt arrived overland from New South Wales
he was appointed to the office. The popular explorer advocated the rapid opening up of
the lands by agriculturists and horticulturists, and was a firm believer in the resources of
the inland country. Shortly after his arrival in August, 1838, he lectured before about


12 interested persons ; and, from his knowledge of other parts of Australia, expressed the
conviction that, because of droughts, the western plains of the range running near the
coast of Gulf St. Vincent were unsuitable for farms. Captain Sturts charge of the
Survey Office was of short duration, for, on October 2, 1 539, he was succeeded b) Captain
Frame, who added to the strength of the staff by bringing sappers and miners to the
Province.
Governor Gawler infused some of his own strenuous spirit into local affairs. He
had the survey of country lands pushed’ on more rapidly, and enabled the original purchasers
to take up their sections. Encouragement was immediately given to this class of colonists,
and some temporary relief was afforded to the congestion in Adelaide. \\ ithin a few
months new' purchases were made, and a boom set in, which caused the situation to
become more perplexing. Everything hitherto had been out of proportion, and Governor
Gawler found that when he infused vitality into one department he created new and
pressing complications.
The people had waited so long for land that they now excitedly went to the
extreme, and took up more than they required for developmental purposes. Since the
foundation upwards of 250,000 acres had been sold by 1839, and in that year alone
170,841 acres were disposed of. As each exploring party returned from the country,
application was made for special surveys, under which large areas in isolated districts
could be taken up. Messrs. F. H. Dutton, D. Macfarlane, and Captain Finniss, of New-
South Wales, applied in January, 1839, for the first special survey —an area of 4,000
acres. Other applications w-ere registered in quick succession, and the best of the lands
within a reasonable distance of Adelaide w-ere exploited. The plains to the north, the
country beyond the hills, and the suitable territory running south along the coast, were
occupied or merely purchased and held on the chance of a rise ; for, unfortunately, a portion
of these new- areas w-as taken up largely for speculative purposes.
The land around Adelaide being brought under cultivation, it was demonstrated
that those who doubted the value of the soil were in error, though there w-ere experienced
men among them. Where in the previous year cattle and sheep could stray, in 1840
there were promising paddocks of wheat, some of which yielded from 30 to 40 bushels
to the acre. In 1839. 443 acres were cultivated; in 1840, 2,823 acres; and in 1841, 8,168
acres. In the last year, and in 1842, land some distance from Adelaide on the Gawler
Plains and among and beyond the eastern hills w-as upturned by the plough, and the returns
w-ere so satisfactory that South Australia already gave promise of proving a wheat-producing
country.
An extensive area w-as taken up by pastoralists. Sheep stations were established
in various districts, so that, besides attracting speculators, the boom brought legitimate
investors to the Province. In that it served an excellent purpose. Several of those who
excitedly purchased land out of all proportion to their requirements, in calmer moments,
and in the re-action which is so inexorable in its arrival, bitterly regretted it; but they


had cause to be delighted in subsequent years when a healthier era set in. In such an
inadvertent way, indeed, one or two of the wealthiest landowners and wool kings of
South Australia became possessed of their properties. The legitimate investors introduced
horses, cattle, and sheep, which multiplied so that, in 1840, South Australia was almost
in a position to sell to its neighbors. One return gives the stock in the Province in
1841-2 as 250,000 sheep, 16,000 cattle, and 1,000 horses. The largest sheepowners in
1841 were the South Australian Company, Messrs. Gleeson, Lodwick (Onkaparinga),
Reynell (Hurtle Vale), breeman, Duncan Macfarlane (Mount Barker), Phillips, Gemmell
(Strathalbyn), Jones (Yankalilla), George Anstey (Para). Dutton & Bagot, Baker, John
Hughes (Gilbert River), R. L. Leake, Hopkins & Green, Horrocks (Hutt River), and
Peters. PTom this list it will be gathered that much of the most beautiful and fertile
country in South Australia was being used for sheep stations at that period. In the midst
of many ot those old sheep-walks are now busy and prosperous towns.
In 1839, and in the first month of 1840. the mania for land speculation was
alarming. Land agents carried on lucrative businesses, and increased in number. Early
writers say that auction sales were held day and night, and w'ere attended by jostling
crowds. Besides a humble theatre and the public-houses, the marts supplied the only
rendezvous for the public at night ; and were the most popular, especially the one presided
over by the witty J. Bentham Neales. At these sales “fenders and fireirons, spades and
axes, or allotments of building land, could be purchased.” Small sections were sought after
with as much eagerness as large, and cut up into building lots. The boom, like modern
episodes ol the kind, caused people to imagine that they ■would quickly become wealthy.
Some pursued their occupations half-heartedly, as if they thought that such engagements
were menial in comparison with their position as land speculators and land owners ; and
some were so optimistic that they considered it beneath them to work at all. Those
were said to be foolish who were afraid to invest, who prophesied that the boom was
like soap bubbles suspended in the air. They were happy in their excitement; and so
they watched the elusive tints of the bubble, with the usual result.
The special surveys were the delight of those who had the most capital. Exploring
parties continued to go out, and to hurry back with applications for land. Governor
Gawler was very energetic, and, when his troubles in Adelaide allowed him, travelled
extensively. On one occasion, with a visitor at Government House named Bryan, and a
member of his staff, he reached the north-west bend of the Murray, and thence some
members of the party pursued a northerly course until they were compelled to turn back
for want of water. One of the horses gave out. and Mr. Bryan was left with it while
Governor Gawler returned to the Murray for water. The Governor and his attendant
became so fatigued, that one of their remaining horses was killed in order that they might
drink its blood. Help was procured, but no sign of Mr. Bryan could be found, and it was
soon apparent that he had perished in the bush. Mount Bryan, near the locality where
he was last seen, was named after him, and years afterwards the horse was found in the
neighborhood alive, but of the rider there has never been any trace. Messrs. Strangways
F
91
The citizens ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


and Blunden in 1838 discovered the Gawler River, named after the Governor.; and
Messrs. Cock and Jamieson travelled as far as Yorke Peninsula. An association was
formed to take up land by special survey on the Peninsula, but the proposal was aban-
doned. Some of those who were interested lived to regret the circumstance, for the land
proposed to be purchased comprised the rich mineral country at Wallaroo and Kadina.
An important trip, which had a tragical outcome, was made by Edward John
Eyre. This gentleman proved himself to be one of the most famous and expert bushmen
who ever visited the unknown lands of Australia. After he completed his explorations,
he was appointed to supervise the aborigines on the Murray ; in subsequent years, as
Governor of Jamaica, he obtained great notoriety in the means he employed to suppress
native insurrection, described by fustin McCarthy as a carnival of blood. Eyre, with
Messrs. Scott, Baxter, and Coles, accompanied by two native boys, went north beyond
Gulf St. Vincent and Spencer Gulf to Lake Torrens. His object was to explore the interior,
and find a way to Western Australia, but the desolation north of Spencer Gulf forced him
back. Instead of returning to Adelaide he struck south-west to Streaky Bay, where he
formed a depot. In order to make a final and decisive effort to reach his goal, he
reduced the size of his party by sending Scott and Coles back to Adelaide, and then,
notwithstanding the request of Governor Gawler to abandon the enterprise, he set out in
January, 1841, with Baxter, as his only white companion, and three natives. The sterile
expanses flanking the head of the Great Australian Bight were crossed with difficulty, and
long stretches traversed without water. In the midst of country as desolate as any ever
pictured, the tragic episode of his expedition occurred. The border line of the colonies
had been crossed, and the five men were camped on a waste of hard rock with sickly
bushes growing from the cracks. At night Eyre watched the horses feeding on the sparse
vegetation a little distance from the camp ; clouds scudded above him ; and the wind
howled around him as it only can in such abandoned wildernesses. Presently Eyre heard
a musket shot, and then one of the natives- Wylie —rushed up, calling wildly to him.
The remaining natives had lately been grumbling, and while Eyre’s old servant Baxter
was sleeping, had shot him and decamped with most of the provisions and all the serviceable
firearms. All night long, with nothing to repulse an attack, Eyre and Wylie watched over
the dead man, expecting every moment to be shot. They were unmolested, and when day
broke they sought to bury Baxter, but the rock was so hard, that they could not dig a
grave. In that awful place they left him, and with provisions sufficient to last only for a
few days, they continued their journey. Once or twice they saw the murderers following
their trail, and then they lost sight of them altogether, and no doubt they perished
miserably in the huge natural graveyard surrounding them. With unsurpassed hardihood
and resolution, Eyre and Wylie reached Thistle Cove, on the Western Australian coast,
where they were fortunate enough to sight a whaling vessel at anchor. They procured
sustenance, and after a few days’ rest started again, and eventually reached Albany in safety.
No journey ever made in Australia, and the annals are full of stirring stories of courage
and suffering, surpasses this in sternness of purpose, endurance, and unbending fortitude.


While the boom was at its height, a rush was made for Port Lincoln. In 1839
the manager of the South Australian Company went to that neighborhood, and selected
an area of land ; but before he returned to register his selection it had been applied for
and taken. Early in that year an association was formed in Adelaide for the purpose of
im g and taking up land in that locality, and the life of the earliest settlers there
was highly adventurous. The natives were uncommonly hostile, and, having committed
several murders, their boldness increased until the white people who were courageous enough
to take up land did so at the peril of their lives. Even the exploring parties were attacked ;
but the danger did not daunt intending settlers, and they, or those who followed them,
accomplished their purpose, but at a terrible cost. Stock was sent to Port Lincoln, and a
route was eventually forced around the gulf. Sometimes the natives in the northern
areas killed the stock or a white man here and there ; at others, when these dangers
were surmounted, Nature won where aborigines failed, and the pathfinders were struck
down. Upon the route were abandoned carts, rusted and broken, and the white bones of
horses, sheep, and cattle. Not a few travellers and settlers were sacrificed as an offering
to the desert sphinx or to bloodthirsty natives ; but the British colonist is not easily dismayed.
At Port Lincoln runs were taken up in 1839, 1840, and subsequent years ; were abandoned,
re-stocked, and abandoned a second time. Then, despite failure, they were re-occupied.
Were it possible in this work, it would be interesting to tell the stories of unrecorded
deeds of bravery and persistence which have won colonial empires. As early as 1839,
trading vessels went to Port Lincoln with passengers, building materials, and stock ;
and “ for a time it seemed as if the capital would be supplanted Hodder. Whaling
ships were at work along the coast leading to Fowler Bay, and, in common with the
temper of the boom, a brilliant future was predicted for Port Lincoln. Even a newspaper,
the Port Lincoln Herald , was established ; but the district did not make any permanent
advance, and many of the people returned to Adelaide.
Thus, during these years, the energy of a part of the populace was employed.
The land boom was aided and fostered by other conditions set in motion by Governor
Gawler himself. By the Act of 1834 it was provided that the proceeds of land sales in
the Province were to be devoted by the Colonising Commissioners to sending emigrants
from England. When the large sums obtained by this over-speculation were sent to the
Commissioners, they dispatched shipload after shipload of people to South Australia,
independently of the questions of demand and supply. The speculators did not cultivate
the land, and hence what under normal conditions of investment might have been an
economic triumph became a source of intense anxiety to Governor Gawler. There
was an abundance of good land, and labor to cultivate it ; but the bulk of
the people hung about the city and production grew with exasperating slowness. The
population of Adelaide, compared with that of the Province, was altogether disproportionate,
and, instead of relieving it, each speculative purchase accentuated the trouble, because it
supplied more funds for immigration. There was a slight diminution in the proportion in 1840,
but in that year and in 1841 most of the difficulties occurred. In 1839, many thousands

of persons hurried into South Australia, and they did very little when they got there. The
population in 1838 was 5,374, of which Adelaide held the ridiculously large number of 4,000;
in 1840 it was 14,630, with 8,480 in Adelaide ;in 1841 the total was 16,000. Already had
begun the centralisation which has been such a hindrance to the Province throughout its history.
This crowding of idle people into the city gave Governor Gawler anxious concern.
I o all the infelicitous conditions confronting him when he arrived was added another,
which accentuated and precipitated them all. The Government was compelled to shelter
and feed the immigrants until they obtained work, and sometimes there were above a
thousand dependent on such assistance. The finances could not bear the previous burdens.
Ihe records were badly kept; the public service required re-organising.; the colonial finances
were in a state of “ thorough confusion and defalcation ” ; and public buildings had to be
erected. Capital was flowing out for food ; and capital was indispensable. The great
influx of immigration began a few months after Governor Gawler’s advent, and before he
had got a firm hold of affairs. He recognised more plainly than ever that the Province
was at an acute stage in its history. The resources were good, but the conditions were
decidedly bad. He summoned all his energies to overcome the difficulty, and kept before
him the emergency clause in his instructions, which, he apprehended, would protect him in
case he exceeded the financial allowance.
Ihe step which Governor Gawler took had an immense influence over the early
struggles of South Australia, and not necessarily one that was permanently bad. By his
own acknowledgment he entered upon his government hastily and without being able to
make minute calculations ; but, after careful consideration of the conditions as he found
them, he decided to take a bold course, so as to end at one stroke nearlv all the troubles
endangering the Province. He committed what might be termed the laudable fault
which has characterised the policy of various Australian Governments, of believing that
relief works solved the unemployed problem. He built a pretentious Government House,
large offices for the various public departments, a Customs house, a gaol, a hospital. “He
remodelled and extended the Survey Department; enrolled a large police force, both foot
and mounted ; formed roads, sent out exploring parties, and introduced bold and decisive
measures everywhere and in everything.” He also raised, from January 1, 1839, the
salaries of public servants, and made them more nearly uniform with the incomes of the
most successful capitalists ; of course, spending money right royally.
Ihe influence of such a policy was almost immediate ; and too many examples
of it have been witnessed in Australia to require extended description. The exciting days
of Boom had come once more ; prosperity had come ; work had come ; wealth and
comfort had come. South Australia was a delightful land ; substantially there were no
unemployed. Colonists were unintentionally induced to buy more land ; business men to
build larger warehouses and shops. As money was expended freely by the Government,
it was expended freely by the people. Wakefield’s principles were glorious-no colony
ever made such progress as this ! A few hundred people, many thousands of miles from


England, in a comparatively unknown country from which they had obtained substantially
no productions, cooped up in a town three years old, were enjoying, after established
methods at home, an immense land boom all among themselves ; and it was the second
boom within three years ! It appeared as if they had come that immense distance just to
hold booms. 1 he mounted colonists on the Glenelg road were indeed right—Colonel
Gawler was “a fast Governor.”
I he Colonising Commissioners were at first complacent. They wrote in 1839 that
so far as their information enabled them to judge, the steps taken by Governor Gawler were
wise, and that he could rely on their co-operation in all measures calculated to promote the
welfare of the Province. I hey again said that he was at liberty to deviate from the rules set
down for his guidance under peculiar circumstances and on certain conditions, one of the
most important being that all such deviations should without delay be placed before the Board.
I his was soon after the beginning of the expenditures, and it gave Governor
Gawler the more reason to expect that his actions would be upheld. He drew bills upon
the Commissioners in the first half of 1839 for ,£8,560, and in the latter half for £h0,600.
And so he proceeded to stir up the Province during 1839 and 1840. The expenditure in
the last quarter of the latter year was at the rate of ,£240,000 per annum, and the
public debt exceeded £'300,000. In 1840, the sum of £'277,000 was sent away for
provisions, and it soon became evident that the longer he pursued this policy the higher
the expenditure would rise. I he Province was like a morphia patient; a little stimulates
at first, but presently the doses must be doubled and trebled. On the susceptible pulse of
an infant settlement a little public money goes a long way.
Governor Gawler’s policy bolstered up the city of Adelaide, but most of the
public works about the capital were in advance of the times, and were apt to retard
rather than assist the development of the country. “ The effect of his policy was that
the settlers were induced to remain in Adelaide, instead of engaging in the cultivation of
the rich soil all around them ” —Stow. Laborers were occupied in the same unprofitable
way, and were not available to settlers who wished to engage in agricultural operations.
The price of food was abnormal. Pdour cost from £jß to £bo per bag; fresh meat, is.
per lb. ; bread, 4j£d. per lb. ; lb. tea, 2s. ; butter, 3s. 6d. per lb. ; soap, yd. per lb. ;
loaf sugar, is. 3d. per lb. ; and water, 4s. per load. City land rose to absurd values, and
oik; report announces that, in 1840, ££,ooo was paid for an acre at the corner of King
William and Hindley Streets. Important buildings were raised, and large stores were
opened. In January, 1839, a branch of the Bank of Australasia was established in
Adelaide by Mr. R. F. Newland.
The importance given to the capital by the increase of population led to the
establishment of a municipal institution earlier than would otherwise have been deemed
necessary. As with the prosperity, this was of mushroom growth, and soon faded away.
Hitherto the government of the Province had been wholly dependent on the Governor,
assisted by a Council, usually consisting of the Colonial Secretary, the Advocate-General,
95
The Citizens ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


and the Surveyor-General. There were no representative institutions, but its size and
wealth seemed to demand that the residents should be given control of the city.
Improvements were imperatively required, and it was to be expected that they would be
carried out more satisfactorily by representatives chosen by the people than by the
Government. A little over three years after the foundation of Adelaide its residents were
awarded a system of responsible government, and rose to the dignity of citizenship. On
August 19, 1840, while the boom was in full swing, Governor Gawler and his Executive
Council passed the first Colonial Municipal Act, 4th Vic., No. 4. The Colonising
Commissioners had recommended to the Secretary for the Colonies that towns in South
Australia with a population of 2,000 persons should be granted elective municipal
institutions ; and as the population of Adelaide was now four times that number, the
Secretary for the Colonies advised the Governor to grant the privilege. The Act provided
for the election of a Council, to consist of 19 Common Councilmen, including a Mayor
and three Aldermen, and for the levying of rates. A vote was extended to every adult
male who had resided in the Province for six months prior to enrolment, who was proprietor
or tenant of any land or building within the city valued at £2O per annum, and who lived
either within the municipal limits or within seven miles thereof. Persons were disqualified
who had received public charitable relief within six months of enrolment, or, within two
years of same, had been convicted of crime by a Supreme or superior Court. No person
could be enrolled who, before July 15, had not paid the rates due by him, except such
as had become due within one calendar month. Ratepayers could be elected as Common
Councilmen if they owned or occupied houses within the city valued at per annum,
or possessed personal property valued at £SOO ; but persons were ineligible who were in
any way interested in Corporation contracts, or who had at any time been convicted of
crime by any Supreme or superior Court, followed by imprisonment, within Her Majesty’s
dominions. A false declaration regarding such qualification was punishable by a fine of
not less than £SO nor more than Penalties were to go into the Corporation revenue.
The total number of voters on the roll was to be declared by public advertisement,
with “ the proportion required to constitute each electoral section empowered to return a
member of the Common Council, such proportion to be as nearly as numbers would permit
one-nineteenth of the whole.” Besides the ordinary system of election, it was made
competent to the electors themselves, by voluntary classification, to form into as many
electoral sections as there were members to be elected, so that each might return one
member, provided that they could agree to a unanimous vote. The Returning Officer,
after a scrutiny of the poll books in which he had entered the names of electors who
personally appeared before him, could declare returned the candidates who had been
unanimously elected by each of the quorums. A proviso “ precluded the persons thus
voting for one candidate from voting again by ordinary election, should the Common
Council not be filled up in whole or in part by the electoral quorums.”
An annual mayoral allowance of /300 was made, which, with the consent
of the Governor, could be increased to The maximum amount of the

ordinary expenditure was set down at ,£SOO for each quarter. The Common Council was
precluded from contracting loans for public works without the approval of the Governor
in Council. Work exceeding in price must be done by contract after tenders had
been called for in the Government Gazette. The Corporation was “ empowered to levy
tolls on the principal thoroughfares leading to and from the city,” and was required to so
far contribute to the cost of the prosecution of criminals, and also to the maintenance of
gaols, as arose from felonies or misdemeanors committed within the limits of the city.
It wi 11 be seen that this Act contained unusual provisions, especially in regard to
quorum voting. Mr. 1 homas Worsnop, in his “ Elistory of the City of Adelaide,” considered
that, although it was not particularly liberal, it gave promise of some improvement to the city.

On November 4, the first regular meeting of the Council was held. The inaugural
act of members was to adopt an address to the Governor, thanking him for the prompt
and liberal manner in which he had carried out “this satisfactory measure.” After assuring
him of their loyalty, the Councilmen declared “ that in the exercise of the duties devolving
upon us in our adopted country we shall exert ourselves to the utmost for the advancement
of the prosperity of this city, the maintenance of peace and good order, the preservation of

ATE
morals, and the promotion of that union which gives strength and efficiency to every effort
at political, social, and moral improvement.” With these hopeful and dutiful words the
City Council began its administrative history.
Two days later, Governor Gawler replied to the address, expressing gratification,
and promising that when the community was settled and established the privileges of
Adelaide Corporation Seal
Adopted in 1840
representative government would be awarded in the full rate.
This was impossible in the initial stages of a country’s history,
for the obvious reason that unity, energy, and decision of
Government were, under such circumstances, more necessary for
the general welfare than the much more slowly moving principle
of representative collective deliberation. Ihe Corporation set
to work to appoint a staff, and D. Spence (£l5O P er annum)
became Town Clerk ; G. S. Kingston (£400), d own Surveyor
and Collector ; John Morphett (£52 10s.), City 1 reasurer ; and
W. Mcßean (30s. per week), Messenger. As the ordinary ex-
penditure of the Corporation was limited to ,£2,000 each year, this
scale of remuneration, with the mayoral allowance of £3OO, was high, aggregating £9BO 10s., or
nearly half the total annual expenditure. However, it was a period of great expectations,
and Adelaide was an important city in the midst of land which was apparently believed
to need no working to yield a fortune. The Government advanced, as a loan, the sum
of £250 for the Council to begin its business on. The land on which to build the
Council Chambers was available, as an acre had been reserved in the original survey of
the city for the use of a prospective corporation, and an application was made to the
Governor that this should be transferred. Acre 203 was thereupon transferred for 125.,
paid on February 18, 1841. The Secretary for the
Colonies, Lord Stanley, questioned the transaction,
and declared that the proceeding was illegal and invalid,
being at too low a price ; but on the ground of public
convenience the title was allowed to stand. Designs
were invited for suitable buildings ; but, as there were
no funds, they were laid aside, and a single room was
hired in Hindley Street. A market site was opened
near to the present slaughter-house ; a cattle market
was established, and a slaughter-house was erected.
The expense entered into for these buildings amounted
to ,£853, which, with £"980 10s. for salaries, left the
finances of the Corporation in a curiously impecunious
condition before any revenue was obtained. Committees
were appointed for the regulation of finance, markets,

and for general purposes, and before the end of 1840 a city seal was adopted.
Some attention was devoted in the early part of 1841 to the question of improving

the streets. Ihe Corporation, per the report of a committee appointed on December 31,
1840, proposed a considerable outlay for the formation of streets, and obtained permission
from the Governor to take stone from a quarry which had been opened below Government
House near the river, but Colonel Gawler considered that the expenditure proposed would
be too great. Ihe citizens did not agree with him, and, on January 27, held a public
meeting, at which resolutions were passed declaring that the streets demanded immediate
attention ; that operations be begun in Hindley Street ; that the Council confine its
attention to making centre roadways ; and that the proprietors of land make good footpaths
at their own expense, according to a plan drawn up by the Town Surveyor. There was
little practical outcome to these imperative demands, for the simple reason that the
Corporation had no funds for such purposes. The owners of land were authorised to
make the footpaths at their own cost, and a private subscription was started in Hindley
Street, but the amount obtained was insufficient to properly improve that thoroughfare,
which had now got into a worse state than before. The Corporation, to obtain revenue,
ordered that carts conveying water to the residents should be licensed ; established a fish,
corn, and a vegetable market on the Corporation acre lately transferred ; and opened a
cattle market in Thebarton. An attempt was made to secure uniformity in regard to
weights and measures. The first city assessment was completed and adopted by the
Council in June, and Adelaide had made such strides during its short history that the
annual value of rateable property was set down at ,£BO,OOO. A rate of qd. in the pound
was declared, which would afford an income of £"1,333 6s. Bd., but was altogether
disproportionate to the expenditure in salaries.
Before a year had elapsed it was perceived that the Municipal Act was
unsatisfactory and unwieldy. Mayor Fisher drew up a new measure which he forwarded
to the Governor, and with him it remained. At the end of his year of office the Mayor
tendered his report, which was a clever and an appreciative document. With honest
pride he expressed his gratification at having been the first Resident Commissioner of the
Province, and, to use his own words, the “first mayor of the first corporation established
in any of the British colonial possessions.” The second municipal election was held in
October, 1841, and the new Council was composed as follows : —Mayor—James Hurtle
Fisher (re-elected); Aldermen —George Stevenson, Thomas Wilson, and William Peacock;
Councillors —Nathaniel Hailes, Isaac Nonmus, Henry Mildred, R. P', Macgeorge, J. Y.
Wakeham, John Newland, Edward Davy, John Norman, W. H. Burford, Cornelius
Birdseye, William Paxton, Andrew Birrell, Andrew Murray, Archibald MacDougall, and
W. G. Lambert. By this time the citizens were in a state of confusion—the Province
was on the verge of bankruptcy. The Corporation in January, 1842, was in debt to the
amount of ££oo ; and though there were arrears of rates to come in, there was no money
in hand. The accounts had been loosely kept, and the civic officers had been wont to pay
themselves with amusing freedom ; those of them who by their office were empowered to
receive Corporation fees deducted their own salaries from such receipts, and handed what
remained to the City Treasurer, until the new Council abolished this peculiar system.

The appearance of the city in the early part of this period had changed from
what it was two years before. The most populous streets had been cleared of trees and
stumps, and the pitfalls which had endangered passengers at night were filled up. Bridges
had been built over the Torrens, and huts had been removed Irom the park lands. Governor
Gawler had slightly utilised prison labor in Bindley Street in improving the roadway,
and proposed to do further work there and in Bundle Street : but so bad were these
streets that nothing: but systematic effort could render them satisfactory. With the increase
O J j
of population, Bindley Street became fairly full of houses, some of which were pretentious.
Bundle, King William, and Currie Streets also had a fair complement of buildings, which
gave the town a more advanced appearance.

way, and peculiarly-dressed horsemen and pedestrians gave piquancy to the scene. The shops
had small windows, and were of modest architecture. Captain Erome, with the aid of
his sappers and miners, erected “a small mud or sod fort on North Terrace, with embrasures,
and carronades mounted therein pointing to the city.” This frowned upon the passers-by,
and slowly decayed. And all about were empty allotments, whimsical old structures, and
green herbage, amid a sprinkling of venerable trees.
In December, 1839, the Government formally receipted a bill for ,£2,300 in
purchase of the park lands surrounding Adelaide, which were reserved for the public, and
of 32 acres of land reserved for a public cemetery west of South Adelaide ; but it does

not appear that the money was actually paid, although the parks have always been used
as intended. Several cottages had been built in earlier years north-west ot Hindley
Street, and the locality was named Hindmarsh, after Captain Hindmarsh. During the
boom, land in the neighborhood was bought and cut up into allotments ; and Thebarton
also entered into existence of a modest kind. Between East Adelaide and the sites of
the eastern suburbs there was a forest of wattles, with here and there a lofty
eucalyptus. In 1840, a favorite old colonist, Dr. Kent, was the only resident in
Kensington, and his cottage was a wooden structure. He laid out a garden, which a
few years later became the temptation and illicit delight of small boys. He also built a
flourmill in 1840, near the present Kent Town Brewery, and the locality derived its
name from the popular old gentleman. The South Australian Company erected a flourmill
nearer the river,

Some of the earlier purchasers selected land at Holdfast Bay, in the neighborhood
of the Proclamation Gumtree. The Bay was still used occasionally as a landing place,
and a few buildings were erected near the beach. As Governor Hindmarsh had awarded
to the locality the name of Glenelg Plains, the same denomination of Glenelg was applied
to the site of the buildings. In 1840, a company was formed in Adelaide to arrange
with the landholders for the erection of a wharf and of warehouses at Glenelg. Terms
were agreed upon, surveys were made, allotments were taken up m 1840, and thus
another centre arose.

Several new buildings were added to those already erected at Port Adelaide,
which, however, attracted a very small proportion of the inflowing population. Ihe creek,
or river, was improved. The South Australian Company, which had purchased numbers
of town allotments there, and, so it is said, at the date of foundation was largely
interested in having the capital established on its sandy and swampy reaches, constructed
a road to the Port in 1840, and erected a suitable wharf and warehouse. The occasion
of the opening of these was a notable one in the history of Port Adelaide, for it
practically heralded the birth of the present town. Mr. H. Hussey, who was a frequent
visitor to the Port, in “ Colonial Life and Christian Experience,” says that the early
residents had novel experiences. The tide rose to such extraordinary heights that it
caused sometimes distressing, and sometimes laughable, trials to them. When St. Paul’s
Church was opened, the people went to the service dry shod and unsuspicious. \\ hile
it was proceeding, the water rose higher and higher, until it burst over an embankment
which had been made for such a contingency, and by the time the service was concluded,
the church was surrounded by the tidal waters, so that the outcoming people could not
get away. They were kept waiting in a cold west wind until Captain Lipson, the
Harbormaster, sent boats to rescue them. So unsuitable was Port Adelaide as a town site
that a large part of its area had to be filled up with earth imported from beyond its
bounds. Several of the early houses stood on piles, and immense sums of money had to
be expended by the Government, the municipality (when it was established), and private
people in making the town habitable. Even the floors of houses built on piles were
subject to the tidal waters. People sometimes rowed in boats to the doors of shops to
make purchases. Mangrove bushes occupied the place of future wharfs.
On Wednesday, October 14, 1840, the Company’s wharf, warehouse, and road
were thrown open to the public by Governor Gawler. Some 5.000 people attended a
third of the whole population. Mr. H. Hussey, who was present, says that about 750
vehicles travelled down the road from Adelaide- pony-carts, wagons, bullock-drays, and
a coach (“ Young Queen,” the first in the Province) -and that horsemen and pedestrians
joined in the gay procession. It was, as yet, the greatest gala day in the history of the
Province. The people assembled on the wharf, which was christened McLaren Wharf,
a name which it still holds, in honor of the manager of the Company. A banquet was
spread in the warehouse, where there was plenty of eating and drinking and speaking,
and a primitive regatta afforded some pleasure to the sightseers. Although the day
opened brightly, ominous-looking clouds began to rise later on. and a gale of wind sprang
up. The people hurried back to the capital. “ Parasols, umbrellas, hats, and bonnets
were carried by the gusts of wind far and wide ; and as it was useless to attempt to regain
possession of them, the drivers of the vehicles proceeded on their way as though beating
a retreat from some powerful enemy.” The clouds of dust were so dense that only
occasionally could a glimpse be obtained of the vehicles. It was an inglorious ending to
an auspicious celebration.
But these booms, explorations, public works, dignities of citizenship, births of


suburbs, and gala days show only one side of the picture. The other side presented a
dull tint that was distressing to the eye. While Adelaide residents were being invested
with the decorous vesture of citizenship, the climax to the forced prosperity was coming
on. Up to a certain limit, Governor Gawler’s public works policy was advantageous, but
it was too risky to be pursued very far. To the sorrow and ruin of many colonists, he
was stopped suddenly in his career of expenditure. After their first passive concurrence
with his administrative actions, the Colonising Commissioners began to evince symptoms
of unrest and doubt. They became curious, and then nervous. To satisfy them, the
Governor appointed, in January, 1840, a Board of Audit, whose members were three
colonists separate from the Administration, to act with the Auditor-General.
The distance of the determining heads from the Province was causing delay at
a time when rapid decision was imperative, and therefore Governor Gawler was forced to
take steps which were not likely to meet with the approval of the Colonising Commissioners
or the Secretary for the Colonies. Even at this early date, South Australia was experiencing
the inconvenience of being governed by men thousands of miles away that was common
to all the colonies before they obtained representative or responsible government. The
colonists, appreciating this, memorialised the Secretary for the Colonies in April to have
the Executive or Legislative Council enlarged so as to admit of a certain number of
non-official members being nominated, as in Western Australia. There was no immediate
outcome, and, to the surprise of South Australians, news arrived in June that the Colonising
Commissioners had been disbanded, and that the Colonial Land and Emigration Board
had been substituted. The new Board consisted of three members, presided over by the
worthy Colonel Torrens, the chairman of the old Board. This alteration in the English
administrators of the Province seemed to make no immediate difference to colonists ; but
members of the new Board were merely getting a hold on their duties, and in due time
the result was seen.
At the end of 1840 the land sales had reached 299,072 acres, producing
,£277,805. Immigrants continued to pour in, but there were few capitalists among them,
and Governor Gawler had to employ the greater number. Yet wages were high, the
price of food was high, rents were high ; and speculators were busy. The Governor was
getting more entangled, but did not despair of pulling the Province out of its troubles.
He rather hoped that the day of legitimate progress would soon arrive, but the harbingers
of storm appeared first; and while he was on a visit to Cape Jervis and Kangaroo Island,
in February, 1841, information reached Adelaide that some of the bills drawn by the
Governor on the Commissioners had been returned dishonored. He hastened back to the
city and summoned his Council, which recommended, by resolution, that the practice of
drawing upon the Commissioners should be continued, with “the precautionary addition
of a reference, in case of need, to the Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury.” It was hoped
that if the new Commissioners persisted, the Imperial Government, recognising the state
of the Province, would come to the rescue. In the meantime, the position of the

Commissioners was uncomfortable. The money at their disposal was swallowed up, and
they had nothing with which to meet the bills.
In April a rumor came to hand, by way of Tasmania, that Governor Gawler had
been recalled, and his successor appointed. This, following upon the previous incident,
caused concern, and was taken as a dismal portent. Then came a despatch from the
Commissioners stating that their funds were absorbed, and informing the Governor that he
must draw no more bills. When the meaning of such an order was fully appreciated, it
was rightly apprehended that the chief means of support of the Province had been
wi thd rawn, and that the Government would have to enormously reduce its expenditure
in consequence. Hundreds of people would be thrown out of work, and hundreds ruined.
Governor Gawler again called together his Council, and informed them that he had one
of two courses to follow : he must curtail the expenditure to the bounds of the revenue
by reductions in all the departments, or he must act as authorised by the instructions of
the Colonial Office in cases of “pressing emergency,” and draw directly on the Imperial
Exchequer in order to preserve the Province from destitution and bankruptcy. He followed
the latter course, but events advanced rapidly to the climax, and within a few months of
the arrival of the first tidings, the Province was in a state of disorder and stagnation.
o o
Governor Gawler firmly believed in the resources of South Australia, and still hoped that
the issue would yet be satisfactory. His faith was warranted, but colonists had to pass
through much tribulation before the expectation was realised. On May 10, Captain Grey
arrived in the ship Lord Glenelg, bringing with him news of Governor Gawler’s recall, and
of his own appointment as administrator. The blow to the Governor was sudden and
somewhat unexpected, especially as it was the first notice he had that his policy was not
favored or upheld by the home Government— the only indication even of dissatisfaction
was received a few months earlier, when the Secretary for the Colonies refused his
application for an increase of salary, on the grounds that the finances of the Province
would not admit of it. He felt the recall very keenly, and his friends regarded it as “an
arbitrary and discourteous proceeding.” The document, which was dated Downing Street,
December 26, 1840, was couched in the language of cold formality, merely stating that he
was relieved from his office because of the bills which had been drawn on the Commissioners
in excess of his authority. In opposition to this stereotyped epistle, it has been shown
that he was instructed to exceed the prescribed expenditure in cases of emergency, and
that the Commissioners had not on any occasion objected to his public works policy with
its attendant expenditure. As was afterwards stated by a Royal Commission, the fault was
rather in the Act than in the administrators, and the plan of blending the principles of a
chartered and a Crown colony had not been successful. At home, as in the Province
under Governor Hindmarsh and Resident Commissioner Pisher, there were two heads
the Board of Commissioners and the Secretary for the Colonies and the division was
unfortunate. Not one colonist doubted the earnestness and sincerity of Governor Gawler.
He was honest, and he was unfortunate. Latterly he had applied ,£56,000, proceeds of
land sales, to useful purposes other than immigration, but such an appropriation was

unauthorised, although that policy was soon afterwards adopted by British legislation. Mr.
B. T. Finniss, in his “Constitutional History of South Australia,” wrote of Governor Gawler’s
administration that “ whether he was right or wrong, it may be asserted that the colonists
of that period, and of the present, owe him a debt of gratitude for saving the Colony
from anarchy, and for the improvements in its condition which have resulted from an
expenditure, not wastefully incurred, but spread amongst the community in the shape of
wages lor useful purposes. Governor Gawler was impelled by circumstances to act as he did.
On June 18, 1841, Colonel Gawler left South Australia. So attached had the people
become to him that he was beset with addresses and testimonials, and upon his departure
he “ left behind him a memory which was treasured by many, even of those who had
suffered most from the policy he had pursued.” In a speech addressed to a sorrowing
audience in Adelaide, on the eve of his departure, he expressed pain and regret at leaving
so many accounts unpaid, “but,” he added, “ I have the fullest confidence that not one
account will remain unpaid, because such accounts are drawn on my authorities.” Although
a Royal Commission absolved him from blame, his career was blighted. In a letter to
Mr. G. E. Angas, in 1846, he describes an economic principle which is worthy of attention.
After asserting that he “ laid, in the face of immense difficulties, the foundation of the
finest Colony, in proportion to its duration, that has appeared in modern times,” he added
that it was “one of the cheapest, if not the very cheapest, of the distant colonies that
England has had.” “ A parent State,” he continued, “ ought to pay for her colonies as
a parent does for his children, or as States do themselves for their lines of battle-ships ;
it is a beggarly spirit of penury alone which can lead them to fume and grumble as they
have done about South Australia.” Mr. E. G. Wakefield, also a misunderstood man, said :
“ I cannot imagine the possibility of founding a colony without obtaining money for its
first expenses from some other source than itself. At first it has no existence at all, and
one might as well propose to manufacture cotton goods without the outlay for the building,
machinery, and the raw materials, etc.” Had the foundation of the Province depended
on the British Exchequer, it would have fared badly. So far, at least, as South Australia is
concerned, its possession and value to England is more creditable to the enterprising
instincts of her colonising people than to the intelligence and foresight of her statesmen.
The subsequent life of Colonel Gawler was dreary. He never forgot the callous
and somewhat discreditable manner of his summary dismissal from office. He appealed
to the British Government in vain, and exercised the right of petition to Her Majesty-
a right that was merely acknowledged. He was absolutely refused some honorary title,
and so, says a writer in the Australian Mail (June 15, 1869), “the grand old soldier
had but little to wrap himself in but his martial cloak and a conscience void of offence."
He died at Southsea, England, on May 7, 1869, aged 73 years.
Captain George Grey, since better known as Sir George Grey of New Zealand,
had an arduous and unwelcome task to grapple with. He was at this time an enthusiastic

ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The citizens


young man, being only 29 years old. Grey was born in Lisbon, Portugal, on April 14,
ISI2. and was the son of Colonel Grey, killed at the taking of Badajoz. After being
educated at Sandhurst, he entered the British Army in 1829. In 1837 he was deputed
by the British Government to explore the remote parts of Western Australia, while
Captain V\ ickham, R.N., in the Beagle , examined the coastline. As an explorer, Grey
was more energetic than happy. His chief faults in this sphere were an unblamable want
ot knowledge of bushcraft and a descriptive pen ; his chief recommendations— sturdy
physique, a determined will, and an unconquerable sense of duty. He landed at Hanover
Bay, in the north-west of the sister colony, and, after discovering the Glenelg River and
other features, was nearly lost among the rocky hills farther north. He and his companions
returned to Hanover Bay in a sorry plight. In 1839, after a respite in Mauritius and
Perth, he set forth again, and quickly lost his boats by wreck in the neighborhood of
Shark Bay. With scanty provisions, and having an extensive territory to traverse, he
and his company started to walk to Perth, the nearest settlement. Grey’s terrible privations
are graphically portrayed in his book of explorations. He discovered features which have
since become notable, and reached Perth in due course, alone, and unrecognisable because
of his sufferings. His stern will, and the knowledge that other lives depended on his
effort, sustained him when he would gladly have resigned himself to death. Help was
sent to his companions, who struggled on in the rear, and all but one were saved,
undoubtedly through the determined conscientiousness of the leader. Grey spent a few
months as Government Resident at Albany, where he married, and then, after visiting
Adelaide, returned to England. In London he published the reports of his explorations
and an interesting and talented work on the Australian aborigines. Prom his clever, but
not always reliable, pen the Australian settlement in Western Australia received its first
blow in 1840, and he thereby earned —unconsciously and without malice on his part the
aversion of those who were chiefly interested in that fatal colonising scheme ; and some
months later in 1840 he was appointed Governor of South Australia.
Captain Grey was sworn in on May 15, and showed as much determination and
decision as an administrator as when he wrestled with death in the Western Australian
bush. Governor Gawler’s duty upon his arrival was to allay the spirit of discontent and
to infuse life into the community ; and Governor Grey’s was to prudently retrench and to
pilot the Province through days of torpor. One was compelled to increase expenditure ;
the other to reduce it. The dangers were as great in one case as in the other. The
latter began at once to make sure of his footing. The amount of bills drawn by Governor
Gawler on the Commissioners was stated to be ,£291,861 3s. spfd., and the total debt
due in England on May 1, 1841, and chargeable to the Province, was £"305,328 2s. ;d.
Governor Grey asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies for specific instructions as to
the course he must follow. He wished to know exactly how far the authorities would allow
him to go, so as not to be dependent on, and to trust in, doubtful emergency clauses,
as did Colonel Gawler. He was expected to retrench and to bring the expenditure as
nearly as possible within the limit of the revenue ; but this was no easy matter. The


expenditure for the first quarter of his administration was estimated at ,£32,000, and
there was only the sum of £7OO in the Treasury to meet it. In addition, the sum of
nearly ,£3,000 was due from Colonel Gawler’s last quarter, besides the large amount of
£35,000 for outstanding claims. The land sales were falling off, the general receipts
for revenue were decreasing, and many people were becoming destitute.
In getting a thorough understanding of the position, Governor Grey had grievous
trouble. Although Governor Gawler had improved upon the system of conducting public
business initiated by Governor Hindmarsh, there was still room for amendment, and to
add to the confusion, fires in Government House and the Survey Office had destroyed
valuable records containing claims against the Government. Governor Grey was imbued
with the importance of a policy of decentralisation. Labor, he held, should not be kept
in the towns, but should be scattered broadcast among the producers. He proposed to
instantly stop certain public works that were in progress, but he was greeted with excited
remonstrances from colonists. He instituted a few small retrenchments, and added to some
of the State imposts, but here, too, he met with opposition. As to the laboring classes
dependent on Government aid, he was in a quandary. He wrote to the bench of
magistrates asking for an opinion as to the remuneration that should be given to
immigrants whom, by agreement, the Government was compelled to support. Ihe
magistrates replied by deprecating the practice of keeping the laboring population in the
towns, and recommended that the Government allowance should be 7s. a week for a single
man, 10s. 6d. for a man and wife, and 2s. 6d. for every “ unemployed child in the
family up to three, inclusive.” They also suggested that Government laborers should work
in summer from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday included, and In winter from 7 to 5, and that
laborers (single) who declined to accept ,£2O (or, married, ,£3O) per annum and
rations, should be refused Government employment. Governor Grey adopted these
recommendations, but there was a general outcry, and public meetings, memorials, and
deputations followed. Before the end of the year he had to support nearly 2,000
destitute persons, and the utmost unrest prevailed.
When the news arrived that Governor Gawler was recalled, the hopes of the
people began to wane, and with his departure they got to a low state indeed. When the
first bills were dishonored, all looked Governor Gawler, and they were to some extent
satisfied with his assurance that the bills would be met by the Imperial Government, but
week after week passed, and there was no sign that such was the case. Fear that the
Province was bankrupt became widespread, for it was believed that with it the colonists
themselves would be insolvent. The burden of the refusal to meet the bills necessarily
fell on those who were personally interested in them—the unsuspecting colonists —and no
one else. Government bills were of no value, and Government claims were as waste
paper. Latterly, big contracts had been entered into between colonist and colonist, and
difficulties of settlement seemed insuperable, especially when Governor Grey announced
his determination to retrench and retrench again.
108
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The c,tizens


Ihe distress of the inhabitants at the end of the year 1841 contrasted acutely
with the apparent prosperity with which it was ushered in. It had its counterpart in the
gala day at Port Adelaide- it began with hope, and it ended in storm. The delay of the
Imperial Government in deciding what was to be done with Governor Gawler’s bills was
fatal. Mr. Bull, who experienced the bitter fruits of the calamity, writes that “ the ruin
reached every class, and most of those who had invested the whole of their capital in
legitimate pursuits, never afterwards recovered their lost position or property.” Trading
companies (several had been formed), societies, storekeepers, land agents, contractors,
speculators, agriculturists, pastoralists, mechanics, and laborers all felt the sudden set back.
Each week the situation became more critical. Captain Grey had to retrench, and, despite
threats or cajolery, he did not budge. It is said that an outbreak was narrowly averted, and
that “at one time several hundred men, in an organised body, marched to Government
House and threatened the Governor with personal violence, but his firmness and coolness
had the effect of quelling the disturbance.”
In the middle of 1841 the fear as to the future sometimes assumed the
character of a panic. First one and then several merchants and others were declared
bankrupt, and presently there was a drifting to the Insolvency Court. Fraudulent and
reckless transactions were brought to light, for the unlimited credit given by merchants in
previous years had been used as a means to effect them. The defaulters quickly left the
Province, and they were followed by numerous unscrupulous debtors. The clipper Dorset ,
which carried many ot them, was facetiously christened “ the bolters’ clipper.” Writes
Mr. H. Hussey :—“ Merchants and tradesmen failed, mechanics had to lay down their tools,
and laborers to cease their labors. A number who had sufficient capital took ship and
cleared out, mostly for New Zealand ; while others, who had determined to defraud their
creditors if possible, made a ‘bolt’ in any vessel that would take them away.” In a
short space of time, Hindley Street, the most populous centre, bore a forsaken appearance,
and few people could be seen walking about. Shops were dismantled and left empty;
works in progress were left uncompleted until better news from London gave a little relief.
In England, the persons who were interested in South Australia —and there
were many who had invested capital or had friends and relatives among the colonists
viewed with concern the preliminary action of the. Commissioners in regard to the bills.
The Directors of the South Australian Company shared in the consternation. Mr. G. F.
Angas first took up the case for the Province, and addressed a letter to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, Lord Russell. He protested that South Australia was “in a state of
advancement and completeness in the fourth year of its existence without a parallel in
the history of the Empire.” And yet, by dishonoring the drafts, “in an instant the
public credit of the Colony has been destroyed, and, if not restored by a timely interposition
of the Government, must end in anarchy, confusion, and ruin.” He confessed, because of
the splendid position of the Province, that he could not understand why the drafts should
have been refused acceptance. “ Here,” he warmly declared, “is a colony raised up within


I 15
four years without trouble or expense to the mother country, with a population of 16,000
persons, whose seaports have, during the past few years, admitted about 200 merchant
ships, and where more than .£1.000,000 of British capital has been embarked, even at a
distance of 14,000 miles. The celebrated colony of Pennsylvania, at one-third the
distance, could not in seven years number half the population or a fourth of its commerce.
Some months later the Imperial Government decided to guarantee a loan, and to
order the Commissioners to make arrangements to meet the dishonored drafts. A Select
Committee of the House of Commons was appointed on the motion of Lord John
Russell, to consider the Acts relating to the Province, and to report on the condition ol
the latter. Its members were Lord Howick, Lord Stanley, Sir George Grey, Mr. W. E.
Gladstone, Mr. G. W. Wood, Lord Mahon, Mr. J. Parker, Lord Eliot, Mr. Ward, Captain
A’Court, Mr. Vernon Smith, Mr. Raikes Currie, Mr. Sotheron. Lord Fitzalan, Mr. George
Hope, and Sir William Molesworth. This Committee made its first report in March, 1841,
and recommended that the bills should be met without delay. The British Parliament,
upon the motion of Lord John Russell, voted the sum of £155.000 for this purpose, and
authorised that South Australia must henceforth be considered and treated as a Crown
colony. Then the Committee made its second report, and declared against a system
of government for the Province by Colonising Commissioners and by the Colonial Office.
“ While one department,” it said, “was made responsible for the payment of the colonial
debt, another had the management of the fund out of which it was to be paid ; and whilst
one was responsible for conducting the public service, the money by means of which it was
to be conducted was placed under the control ot another.”

ysi N some respects Governor Grey resembled General Gordon. lie
was a religious man, who sought to blend Christian principles
jjtf. . J with political economy, but he never allowed his convictions to
prejudicially affect his judgment. He was conscientious and
sympathetic, but no personal attack from the people turned him
f from his policy, or caused him to swerve from what he felt to
i be his duty. The newspapers of the day were bitter in abuse
% and ridicule doubtful means used by them to force his haiul
anc l it must have caused his journalistic enemies mortification
when it transpired years later that Governor Grey had purposely
refrained from reading any of their criticisms. Although his
work was at first distasteful to colonists, Governor Grey was certainly earnest and unselfish
in pursuing it; he even tried to dispose of the expensive government residence erected
by his predecessor, and to take lodgings in a small establishment. Moreover, while
from a sense of duty he reduced wages, he contributed freely out of his own limited salary
to relieve the distress thereby occasioned.
At the same time, with all these admirable qualities, he laid himself open to
attack on minor points : he was irritable, and an autocrat. Opinions vary concerning
his South Australian rule ; those who suffered from his retrenchment generally condemned
his proceedings, while one or two critics consider that he was not equal to Governor
Gawler as an administrator, whom they credit with laying the foundation of South
Australian prosperity, which Governor Grey and others built upon and extended. James


Allen —“ History of Australia from 1787 to 1882’’—who evinces marked animosity to him,
says Governor Grey carried out retrenchment with “ a ruthlessness which showed that Ik,
had no 1 bowels of compassion.’ ”
South Australia had entered the second critical stage in her history. So strained
were affairs, that a little mistake was likely to endanger her progress for many years, but
the day of trial is not necessarily a day of evil, even as sickness in precipitating a crisis is
frequently beneficial to the human frame. Governor Gawler gave an undoubted impulse
to the Province, but public energy was not applied in the right direction. Inflation
became a disease, the financial crisis was the climax, and Governor Grey s retrenchment,
combined with well-directed industrial effort, the cure.
It would be difficult to give an accurate description of the state of the 1 rovince
at the beginning of 1842, without entering into tedious detail. Ihe recent news from
England had inspired a little hope; but when subsistence seems doubtful in the interval,
a distant expectation affords poor consolation. Many of those who held on in hope of
better times distrusted their own judgment when they observed others hurrying away.
City land, for which fancy prices had been paid, was sold for the cost of the title deeds ,
houses were let rent free. Ready money was so scarce that a sovereign, or even a half-
crown piece, was seldom seen -a modified system of barter w r as indulged in. Ihe
number of unemployed was increasing, and the population of the city rapidly going down.
Out of 1,915 houses in Adelaide, 642 became vacant in 1842, and 216 had fallen into
decay. Poorly clothed, and sometimes poorly fed, persons wandered about the streets
until they were forced to tramp the country districts in search of work, in the meantime
dependent for a meal on the charity of strangers. A score or more of men were
imprisoned for debt, and Governor Grey had to prepare a Pill for their relief. Some 136
writs for the recovery of debts passed through the hands of the Sheriff during the year.
The business men who were able to hold up their heads had to reduce domestic expenditure,
and, in giving long credit, live in a precarious manner. Newspapers graphically pictured
the ruin of previous hopes, and discussed the question, “ Shall we re-emigrate ? I here
was depression in every article of merchandise, and all kinds of colonial property, and,
says H odder. “ , . . Sixteen thousand persons were plunged in more or less
distress, which could be alleviated only by assistance from without ; that is to say, the
importation of capital into the Colony.” A public meeting, held February 19. informed
Governor Grey that the “ operations of agriculture are clogged almost to cessation ; that
our merchants only exist by sufferance of the banks and large companies; that the profitless
pursuits of our tradesmen are daily terminating in insolvency ; that our laborers are
seeking other shores or are sunk into a condition of pauperism ; and that hundreds of
families not referable to either of the before-mentioned classes find at length that they
have exchanged wholesome abundance in England for a bare and precarious subsistence
here
By only completing the public works which were indispensable, by reducing
112
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Husbandmen


wages, by closing public offices, and by an energetic use of the pruning knife all round,
Governor Grey considerably reduced expenditure, but not enough to balance the finances.
He attacked small branches as well as large, and left little but the trunk to the public
gaze, and it was these small retrenchments that seemed to give rise to the most virulent
abuse. He did his utmost to stay the drift, and yet there was scarcely any step taken
by him for the improvement of affairs that did not meet with the opposition of colonists. In
addition to retrenching, he imposed new taxation —horror heaped on horror’s head. Money
was absolutely required ; he passed a Customs Act, an Act for the Levying of Harbor
Dues, the Port Act, and an Act for Regulating Distillation in the Province. A meeting
in the Queen’s Theatre on July 5, declared that the new taxes and duties were “unequal,
exorbitant, and injudicious, and would deeply injure the merchant, and place imported
goods beyond the reach of the inhabitants.”
The state of the Province demanded that money must be obtained, and hence
Governor Grey persisted in his imposts. The minds of some colonists reverted to the
character of the old Saxons, and at one time forcible resistance was seriously proposed.
The suggestion was also made and discussed that the Governor should be seized, placed
on a sailing vessel, and sent out of the country. The Adelaide City Council, by
resolution, claimed “ the birthright of every British subject, but more particularly applicable
to the colonists of South Australia, viz., the power of raising and expending taxes by
their representatives in the Legislative Council . . . .” A memorial to Her Majesty
was drawn up by the Council, praying for a disallowance of the rates and taxes. A
slight reduction was afterwards made in the port charges. In August, the Governor
received instructions from England to ship to Sydney the laboring immigrants engaged on
Government works. He disobeyed the Secretary of State for the Colonies, explaining In a
despatch to Lord Stanley that by such a procedure the Province “ would have been
irretrievably ruined.” “ I should, in the first instance, have had to send away 2,427 souls,
that is one-sixth part of the whole population ; the fact of my having clone so would
have made paupers of a great many more, who must have been removed in the same
manner, and there would have been no laborers remaining in the Province to produce
food for those who were left.’’
The decision of the Imperial Parliament to honor Governor Gawler’s bills gave
his successor rather premature confidence. Besides the bills due in England, there were
several, representing large sums, due in South Australia, and imagining that he would be
upheld by the Imperial Government, and recognising that he would afford important relief,
Governor Grey met them by drawing new bills upon Her Majesty’s 1 reasury. 1 hese
were precisely similar to Governor Gawler’s bills honored by the British Government, but
late in 1842 Lord Stanley returned them chargeable with interest. Governor Grey had
drawn some of them in 1841, and some in [842. His credit was now destroyed; the
banks would not negotiate any more of his drafts, and he was compelled to fall back upon
the commissariat chest for ,£I,BOO to meet urgent current expenses. In satisfying
outstanding claims, Governor Grey had gone beyond his instructions, but Lord Stanley,


says Dutton, in his history, “gave no good reason for refusing to pay these bills. Ihe
Governor was directed to “ issue debentures in exchange for their bills, such debentures
to bear interest at five per cent, from the date at which the bills became due. A few
creditors refused the debentures. The amount of Governor Gawlers debts met by the
British Parliament, and eventually written off, was upwards of £200,000.
The loss to South Australians by the delay of the home Government in honoring
the bills is well put by Dutton : “In the first place, the colonists were kept waiting
18 months before they got any settlement at all ; then they got the Governors
bills on the Lords of the Treasury, to get which cashed they had to pay the banks live
per cent, discount. The bills were sent to England and refused acceptance ; then the
lawyers got hold of them. In addition to noting protests, there was a charge of 20 per
cent.; also charge for re-exchange. Lawyers in the Province were then ordered to call for
an early re-imbursement from the unfortunate endorsers, which they could not make except
J *
by handing over the debentures bearing five per cent, interest, whilst the bank interest
was from 10 to 12. A child might guess the consequences to nine out of ten of the
holders of these bills. Half the amount of the bills gone in expenses, and a final
settlement gained after an advertisement of the properties of A, B, or C for peremptory sale.
In the meantime, two measures had passed the British Parliament of paramount
importance to South Australia. On lune 22, 1842, an “Act for Regulating the Sale
of Waste Lands in the Australian Colonies and New Zealand was passed, under which
the policy of Colonel Gawler in applying part of the proceeds arising from the sale of
lands to purposes other than immigration was legalised. The Parliamentary Committee
had taken considerable evidence on this point. Mr. P>. G. Wakefield was called as a
witness, and when asked by Lord Howick whether he thought it expedient to apply the
whole of the proceeds of land sales to immigration, suggestively replied : “ Of what use is
it, my lord, to keep up the scaffolding to a building when the work is finished?’ Mr.
G. F. Angas is credited with making a similar remark. Ihe new Act provided that only
half of such proceeds should be devoted to introducing immigrants, while the other half was
to go towards local improvements, the aborigines, etc. The minimum price of land was
fixed at £ 1 per acre, and the power of sale and conveyance was vested in the Governor.
The other Act embraced some of the remaining recommendations of the
Parliamentary Committee, and materially altered the official status of the Province. Passed
on July 15, 1842, it was entitled “An Act for the Better Government of the Province of
South Australia.” It abolished government by Colonising Commissioners, and placed
responsibility in the hands of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, thus doing away
with divided authority at home. It also provided for the establishment of a form of
legislation which admitted by nomination a few of the people into the deliberations of the
Legislative Council, in common with the practice in other colonies.
The years 1841-2 were the crucial period of the financial stress. The colonists


stood the test, although with many cries of complaint, much suffering, and a budget of
accusations. By 1843 the worst of the trouble was over, but years of quiet development
were needed to bring general prosperity to the Province. Hundreds of people were
ruined in the interval, and never regained their former position. Latterly, under Governor
Gawler, the expenditure had been five times greater than the revenue, but at the
beginning of 1843 Governor Grey presented a more encouraging balance-sheet. His
receipts amounted to ,£81,813 I( P S - 5d., and his expenditure to £84,531 16s. lod. Of the
latter amount £18,069 IOS - sd. had been spent in the Immigration Department, chiefly in the
maintenance of destitute persons, and £26,013 had gone in paying outstanding claims.
I he position was, therefore, better than would appear by the bare statement of accounts.
Governor Grey had appointed a Board of Audit and an Immigration Board, the one to
carefully check accounts, and the other to hear and judge cases requiring relief. He
had purchased the South Australian Company’s road to Port Adelaide for 12,000 acres
of land, built a highway over the hills, made and repaired streets, established a system
of tender for the supply of the public service, and provided for mail communication with
the eastern colonies.
In the year 1843 the Governor still further cut down expenses, and in a manner
that aroused some animosity. He gave notice that the salaries of public servants were
to be reduced by £4,000 ; that the master of the signal station was to be dismissed unless
the public subscribed his salary; that tenders would be called for leasing “to the public
the Government wharf at the Port, and that the leases of premises held by the Government
for bonded stores, for the buildings used by the Supreme Court in Whitmore Square, and
for the house used for the Resident Magistrates’ Court in Currie Street, would each be
abandoned.” As a final indication of his thoroughness, it is but necessary to add that he
dispensed with the services of the letter carrier to North Adelaide.
The popular clamor was renewed a few weeks later, and as a result of
“ inflammatory articles ” in the newspapers blaming Governor Grey for all the disasters
that had fallen on the Province, a monster meeting was held in the Queen’s Theatre on
March 16. Governor Gawler, by his personal character and lavish expenditure, had made
friends of all the people, but Governor Grey was as yet unpopular, mainly because of
his incisive retrenchment. The friends of Governor Gawler also thought that Governor
Grey had been discourteous in the manner in which he relieved his predecessor of office,
especially after being an honored guest at Government House in 1840. At the meeting a
motion of want of confidence in Governor Grey’s administration was carried, and a
petition to Her Majesty was drawn up, humbly praying “ that your Majesty will be
graciously pleased to take the case into your most gracious consideration, and either recall
his Excellency the Governor, or issue directions for such an amended mode of administering
the government of the Province as shall to your Majesty seem meet.”
The Act providing for the alteration in the system of Government came into force on
February 20, and the new Council was called together on June 20. This consisted of eight


members, four official and four non-official members, nominated by the Governor. Ihe
officials were ; —Governor Grey, A. M. Mundy (Colonial Secretary), W. Smillie (Advocate-
General), Captain Sturt (Colonial Treasurer); the non-officials were : Major I. S.
O’Halloran, T. Williams, John Morphett, and G. E. Dashwood. Within a short period Mr.
Jacob Hagen succeeded Mr. Williams, and Captain C. H. Bagot succeeded Mr. Dashwood.
A building for the Council Chamber was erected on North Terrace, and the non-official
members first took part in the proceedings on October 10, when the House met for the
transaction of business. The session lasted until November 14, and in the interval 16 Bills
were passed. The privilege, though very limited, of the people to have a voice in the
government of the country came at an appropriate juncture. The monster meeting of
March, 1843, was one of the last public demonstrations of opposition to Governor Grey,
and after the opening of the new Council very little was said against him. In 1844-5
the finances had become really healthy, and there were many evidences of industrial
activity, proving that despite detraction and difficulty the new Governor had piloted the
Province into a safe channel.
Throughout these stormy years the City of Adelaide was the principal sufferer,
and residents soon recognised that their citizenship was mostly an illusion. The depression
had removed, directly or indirectly, several useless excrescences, and partly it led to the
extinction of the municipal institutions. As the citizens were subjected to privation, houses
were abandoned and city land was rendered comparatively valueless, the Council
experiencing the central blast of the storm. In January, 1842, the city was nearly £6OO
in debt. The salaries of the officials were reduced, and a rate of gd. in the pound was
declared, which was expected to produce ,£1,500. The citizens already had such heavy
calls on their purses that they did not accept this decision without opposition, but, like
Governor Grey with the public finances, the Corporation required money to pay off
liabilities, and persisted in the rate. Its legality was called Into question, but. when
applied to, the Advocate-General declined to give an opinion. To devote more attention
to his profession, Mr. bisher had resigned the mayoral office, and Alderman Wilson was
chosen to succeed him, Councillor Lambert being elected an Alderman. Some time
later the questions of whether Mr. Fisher could resign, and whether Mr. Wilson could be
elected to the vacancy, were raised, and a tedious dispute followed. The Advocate-General
took the former view, and Mr. bisher, also a lawyer, declared that he was competent to
resign. To settle the point, the latter suggested that a short Bill should be passed by
Parliament, but the authorities showed no inclination to so far consider the Corporation.
Other suggestions were made, but they too were ignored, and the doubt continued to
exist, though if the Advocate-General were correct in his opinion, all the actions of the
new mayor were invalid.
Governor Grey at no time gave much encouragement to the City Council, and
there were occasions when he evinced marked opposition to it. Early in 1842 he
employed immigrants to enclose parts of the park lands so as to raise revenue by letting
them, and formed and metalled the roadways in Hindley and Rundle Streets, from
116
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Husbandmen


Morphett Street to Gawler Place. Beyond slight attempts of this kind to improve the
city, he showed extreme indifference to its concerns. When, as already mentioned, the
Council, waiving for a time the rule for the exclusion of political discussion, claimed by
resolution the “ birthright of every British subject ” of a representative Legislative Council,
Governor Grey gave “mortal offence” in his retort. He promised to forward the
memorial to England, but added that “it may very possibly not be received as the
petition of the Mayor and Corporation of the City of Adelaide, it being the opinion of
the law advisers of the Crown that the Corporation could not have legally proceeded to
the late election of mayor.” The Corporation disrespectfully retaliated by resolution that
the reply of Governor Grey was “ in its nature undignified, and unworthy an enlightened
and liberal Government.”
The relations between the Council and the Governor were decidedly strained.
Governor Grey was evidently of opinion that the Municipal Act was not suited to the
circumstances of the city, and there was the fact that because of its loose wording
the validity of the mayoral changes was doubtful. Governor Grey had a Bill drafted
which was to empower him to “ abridge, amend, or take away ” the corporate rights
which the Act of 1840 had extended, so that the Corporation would exist on
sufferance only, and the sentiments of Councilmen towards the administrator were not
J ’
improved by his failing to send the Mayor a copy of the Bill. In acknowledging a
minute from him generally notifying the intentions of the Government, they declared that
the measure was in direct opposition to the principles upon which the Province was
founded, and in view of “the impediments which he has placed in the way of their
operations, taken in connection with his general management of affairs in this Province,
that there is little to hope of advantage to their constituents during the continuance of
His Excellency’s administration.” Six members, however, demurred by protest to the
memorial, and to this last attack. The Bill was subsequently sent to the Mayor, and,
of course, was not perused with much satisfaction. Councilmen asked that clauses should
be added providing that they should have control over the park lands, also for the
establishment of a Corporation Court, power to elect a Sheriff for the city, jurisdiction
over foot police (to be called Municipal Police), and for power to license “ tavern keepers,
storekeepers, auctioneers, carriers, water carts, and vehicles let for hire.”
The requests of the Council were not granted. Disputes arose as to the
possession of the slaughter-houses, and after correspondence and unpleasant feeling
Governor Grey allowed the Corporation to retain them without rent. The conditions of
the municipal institutions became worse as the year progressed : “ members were at almost
open war with the Governor, and their internal relations were not of the most cordial
character.” To obtain money the Finance Committee issued Corporation Scrip, limited to
to satisfy creditors for a time. There does not seem to have been any legal authority
for this proceeding, but the scrip was taken and circulated. In October, 1842, Mr. Wilson
was re-elected Mayor, and other vacancies were filled. The question of the validity of the
elections was also discussed, and four citizens refused to accept a seat in the Chamber.

The Council declared in favor of obtaining an Act to settle the point, and deputed Mayor
Wilson to wait upon Governor Grey on the subject. The latter promised the Mayor to
do what he could, but declined to commit himself to any expression of opinion. He
suggested that a petition to the Governor and Legislative Council should be drawn up ;
this was forwarded in November, but no assurance was received that the wishes of the
Corporation would be granted. Councilmen expostulated in January, 1843, and, after the
receipt of a reply from the Colonial Secretary, resolved to appeal to the Supreme Court
to test the validity of their proceedings, but, though a resolution authorising such a step
was carried, no legal proceedings appear to have been taken. Ihe functions of the
Corporation were now practically suspended. In March, 1843, a Council meeting was held,
and respectfully asked Governor Grey to amend the Municipal Act, but there was no reply.
The end of citizenship had almost arrived. Indignity followed indignity. 1 here
were no funds, and the furniture owned by the Corporation was “ seized for rent and
publicly offered for sale.” Members met again on June 1, and authorised the City
Treasurer to buy in the goods at the sale. Mayor Wilson and Alderman Peacock waited
upon the Governor, and asked what he intended to do. Governor Grey informed them
that he “was expecting despatches which would contain a disallowance ol the Municipal
Act.” A meeting of the Council was called for August 17, but there was no quorum
present. The opinions of the Advocate-General and Mr. P'isher were obtained by the
Town Clerk, and they agreed that the Council was defunct, but disagreed again as to the
validity of Mr. Fisher’s resignation. Mr. Mann, a third barrister, co-incided with the
Advocate-General concerning the illegality of the resignation, but held that the Council
could go on with its duties if Mr. Fisher would resume the chair. A further meeting was
convened on August 21, and again there was no quorum. The Corporation seemed to be
abandoned; the landlord took possession of the room used as a Council Chamber, and
the furniture and records of the Corporation were removed. On September 21, one other
meeting was held, and framed a memorial to the Governor and Legislative Council, asking
them to pass some measure to enable the citizens to proceed to the election of Common
Councilmen at the usual season of the year. There was no response, and this
memorial was the expiring cry of the City Council.
Adelaide was now in the position of a country village. Governor Grey took no
steps to revive the Municipal Act, but his successor by Act of Parliament paid off the
Corporation debts, excepting the salaries of certain municipal officials. City property
reverted to the Crown, and a rate of 6d. in the pound was declared for purposes of
improvement. In August, 1846, the City Corporation Act was repealed. In May, 1848,
a petition praying for the re-establishment of a municipal institution was refused, on the
ground that not one-third of the ratepayers had signed it. Various improvements to the
streets and bridges were effected by the Government or by public subscription, although
we read that in the winter of 1846 Adelaide streets were “like a ploughed field.” With the
return of prosperity, the general appearance of the city improved. Unsuccessful attempts
were made to build a railway to Port Adelaide, and to construct waterworks for Adelaide.

1 he; most important feature of Governor Grey’s administration remains to be
recorded. Lnder Governor Gawler the city had its chance, and it was now the turn of the
country. While all this strife was going on in Adelaide, the producers were engaged in
much moie profitable work, and Governor Grey helped them by his retrenchment and his
discouragement of all but necessary public works in the city. He had been twitted with
being too much of a theorist in political economy, but his policy had very definite issues.
As observed in the preceding chapter, he saw immediately after his arrival that the
capital was overcrowded and that the population must be sent out to the farms and
stations and gardens. Some of the reasons for his rigorous dismissal of Government
employes, and for his disinclination to provide relief works, were to be found in the
country. He was more far-sighted than most of those who railed against him
Decentralisation, and the utilisation of natural resources, were the objects he had in view ;
and a rapid growth in agriculture and in general industrial development was the result.
1 hroughout the period of depression newspapers in other Australian colonies, and some of
the; opponents of \\ akefield’s principles in England, had scathingly criticised and “ written
down South Australia, but after a year or two they changed their tone.
Ihe depression was at first felt as acutely, though not as generally, in the
country as in the town. Many Adelaide merchants were interested in agriculture and
J S')
sheep breeding, and their losses compelled them to relinquish their estates for a mere song,
even after they had erected substantial improvements by careful management. The fall in
value of real estate, and in all kinds of property, rendered a percentage of the producers
bankrupt, and men who in 1840 were comparatively opulent, in 1842 were in poverty,
and found it necessary sometimes to obtain work as farm laborers. Orchards were allowed
to run wild and improvements to fall into decay, simply because their owners, by bankruptcy,
were forced to quit, and because there were no capitalists to purchase them. The price
of wheat in 1842 was from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per bushel. Stock was sacrificed at comparatively
ridiculous quotations ; sheep that cost £2 were sold for ss. In 1843 the boiling down of
sheep and cattle was resorted to, and soap works were established. One settler at Echunga,
who in 1840 in land, garden, and stock, had an “apparent balance” to the credit of
profit and loss of had sacrificed all by 1843; and the Banks obtained the
property. Whereas, under Governor Gawler, there was not enough land surveyed for
purchasers, under Governor Grey in 1843 there were not enough purchasers for the land
surveyed. Some 300,000 acres waited for buyers, and in the meantime 36 special surveys
of 4,000 acres each had been allotted. Those who arrived in the Province with capital
during this period and purchased land and stock almost without exception acquired a
competency.
The subsequent view of the position is of a different character. In 1841 there were
8,168 acres under crop; in 1843, some 28,690 acres were cultivated. One record has
it that up till the latter year the land alienated was 325,000 acres ; the population was
17,366; the number of sheep in the Province, 331,000; of cattle, 29,000; and of horses,
1,566. The wreck of their hopes in Adelaide led many colonists to swell the number
119
The Husbandmen ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


of legitimate producers, by devoting themselves to farming or pastoral operations ; and the
seasons Pfave them encouragement. During Governor Gawler’s administration wages in
o O o
the citv were so high that farmers could not obtain labor enough to enable them to break
the soil. But all this was changed by the new policy ; and the men who were forced
by indigence to tramp into the country were important factors towards changing the
situation. At first many laborers were unaccustomed to agricultural work and disinclined
to a country life. The harvest of 1841-2 was so abundant, and labor so scarce, that
gentlemen volunteered to go out and assist the farmers ; and the Governor gave permission
for the military and civil officials to lend a helping hand ; but, even then, it is recorded
that a quantity of grain was lost. The splendid crop served a double purpose :it
encouraged the farmers to increase their tillage, and stimulated the inventive genius of
certain colonists. It was during 1842 that the most effective decentralisation work was
carried out ; and the consequence was a great increase in that year —19,641 acres- in the
area under cultivation. The Agricultural Society wisely offered for competition prizes for
the best agricultural laborers and for shepherds ; in keeping with the spirit of the times,
farmers’ clubs were established in several centres, ploughing matches were arranged, and
agricultural, sheep, and cattle shows were held. In 1843, Mr. j. Ridley, a miller at
Hindmarsh, invented a reaping machine, which speedily proved invaluable to farmers;
and Mr. Pettit manufactured a plough adapted to the peculiar conditions of the Province.
The rapid increase in cultivation fulfilled Governor Grey’s sanguine expectations.
While Adelaide presented a deserted appearance at the end of 1842, the country exhibited
a pleasing contrast. “There,” says a newspaper of the time, “everything is activity,
and farms are spreading almost like the work of enchantment over the land, raised up by
the industry of our settlers.” The harvest of 1842-3 provided South Australians with
more breadstuff than they required for their own consumption ; and in February the first
export was made. The South Australian Company shipped 260 bags of Hour to
Western Australia, and Mr. S. Stocks, jun., in conjunction with Messrs. Hamilton and
Co., forwarded a large parcel of wheat to Mauritius. New flourmills were erected, and
thenceforth South Australia consistently supplied its eastern and western neighbors with
grain and flour. Within a year or two it was the largest wheat-producer in Australia,
and agriculture, which was ushered in under such forced conditions, became, with wool,
its most reliable source of wealth. Under Governor Gawler the main portion of this
original area of land was alienated ; but under Governor Grey the first legitimate and
systematic attempts at cultivation were made. It is in this respect, and in his adjustment
of the finances, that the latter’s rule stands forth in the brightest light. While in 1840,
out of a total population in the Province of 14,630, there were 8,480 persons in Adelaide,
in 1844 there were only 6,107 °ut °f a total of 17,366.
Notwithstanding that there was a phenomenal fall in the price of stock, the wool
industry soon recovered its balance, and the pastoral interests began to flourish. Many
of the stations changed hands, but the stock in the Province increased, and the wool
export became substantial ; a considerable area of new country was settled both by
120
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Husbandmen


*&? - fwfjF *fr J gft; jilte» -, * > w*
agriculturists and pastoralists, but principally by the latter. On June 2, 1842, the
Government Gazette proclaimed the Counties of Adelaide, Hindmarsh, Flinders, Light,
Gawler, Sturt, Lyre, Stanley, and Russell (the origin of the names is obvious) and in
1846 two new counties were added Grey and Robe. Settlement- mostly pastoral-
extended into these remote districts, and by February, 1847. upwards of 12 isolated
sections were selected in Grey and Robe. In this pioneer work the pastoralists life w r as
hard and rough, with a spice ot danger in it. “In those days,” writes Harcus, “the
natives were enemies not to be despised ; and before they learnt to fear or trust the
white man they were not slow to resent his intrusion upon their hunting grounds. They
plundered his huts, killed his sheep and cattle, and sometimes attacked himself or his
shepherds. He had, therefore, to be always on the watch to protect himself and his
Kapunda
property.” In 1844 there were in the Province 450,000 sheep, 30,000 cattle, and 2,150
horses.
One unexpected condition that helped Governor Grey in establishing prosperity
was the discovery of minerals. The rewards from farming on such limited areas as those
already brought under the plough were not sufficient to immediately attract a large
population. As the principle of applying all the proceeds of land sales to immigration
had been abolished, South Australia had to principally depend on its internal attractions
for its increase of people, and rich deposits of copper formed one of these attractions.
As early as 1836, a German geologist and mineralogist, Mr. Menge, arrived at Kangaroo
Island, and eventually moved with the other settlers to the mainland. He earned for
himself the name of “The Father of Mineralogy,” for within a short period he had prospected
the ranges stretching from Cape Jervis to Barossa, and discovered indications of gold,
silver, copper, lead, iron, and precious stones. In 1838, silver-lead ore was found on the
property of Mr. Osmond Gilles, at the foot of the hills east of Adelaide. Mr. Gilles, the
121
The Husbandmen ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


first Treasurer, was an exceedingly popular and worthy official, and Glen Osmond and
Gilles Plains were named after him. In 1841, the South Australian Mining Association
was formed to work the Wheal Gawler Silver and Lead Mine near Glen Osmond, and
a sample of ore sent to England assayed at a high percentage. A copper lode was also
discovered on the Onkaparinga, a beautiful stream winding among the hills ; and other
discoveries were made on the; Mount Lofty Ranges, and were worked for some years.
The first important discovery of copper that was to bring wealth and population
to South Australia was made on a station at Kapunda in 1842. Mr. h. S. Dutton, one of
the discoverers, in his history tells the story: “The first discovery of the ore was by the
youngest son of Captain Bagot whilst gathering wild flowers on the plain. Shortly
The Burra in 1857
afterwards, not far from the same spot, 1 ascended the top of a small hill to view the
surrounding country. One of our flocks had been dispersed during a thunderstorm, and I
had been out nearly the whole of the day in drenching rain in search ot them. The spot
where I pulled up my horse was beside a protruding mass of clay slate. My first
impression was that the rock was covered with a beautiful green moss ; but on
dismounting and breaking off a piece it proved to be green carbonate of copper.”
The two places were in close proximity, and “a complete wilderness.” The
discoveries were kept secret ; sections were applied for in conformity with the regulations,
and it was ascertained that the specimens were “ undoubtedly copper ore.” Messrs.
Bagot and Dutton became the purchasers at the fixed Government price for waste lands
of £i per acre. The site lay about 45 miles from Adelaide, and there the town of
Kapunda arose. Cornish miners were procured, and “it soon became evident that the
mine was of unusual value.” The promoters at first thought that they had taken in all

the copper deposit, but, finding out their mistake, Captain Bagot was forced to pay
for the adjoining too acres in April, 1845. Before this, however, the mine had
been tested. Messrs. Bagot and Dutton worked it for some time, and obtained lucrative
returns. In 1845 Mr. Dutton sold his one-fourth interest to an English Company, and
some time later Captain Bagot parted with his share to the same buyers. The wealth of
this property attracted a considerable population : the number of arrivals over departures
in 1844 was 973, and in the first quarter of 1845, 616 ; in the month of August in the
latter year 500 persons arrived in the Province.
The immediate success of the Kapunda mine caused prospecting to be carried
on more systematically, and several new mines were opened on the hills. Shepherds
and other employes on the sheep stations began to scan the ground as they pursued
their occupations, and in 1845 a discovery, richer than that at Kapunda, was
made. This was in what
was then known as the Ear
North on the Burra Creek.
It is said that a shepherd,
named Pickett, “accidentally
stumbled” on a “lump of
copper ore, of almost in-
credible richness and purity,

Rumors were
circulated very persistently,
but such secrecy was main-
tained that “many pretended
to regard the affair as a

considering the scarcity of ready money in the Province, the difficulty lay in securing
the requisite ,£20,000 cash. The “ strivings and rivalries and exciting articles and
communications in the papers were unexampled for a few weeks.” Two associations were
formed to acquire the property, and the first that could raise the money was likely to
get the prize ; the fear was entertained that before either could obtain the necessary sum
English capitalists would arrive on the scene. War was waged between the two parties,
one of which acquired the sobriquet of the “ Nobs,” and the other of the “ Snobs."
The former was composed of capitalists, the latter principally of tradesmen. Mr. William
Giles, manager of the South Australian Companv, offered to advance ,£lO,OOO if the
O A J
“ Nobs ” would make up the remainder, but they refused. Then the tradesmen tried to come
to arrangements with Mr. Giles, and. failing, they withdrew from the bank the amount of

their united funds in specie, so as to prevent the other side from having the use of it.

Governor Grey wisely decided to postpone the time for receiving tenders, so that
the rival parties might mature their plans. Sums were realised on all sorts of property ;
eventually the “ Nobs ” and the “ Snobs ” agreed to combine to purchase the block, and
on August 18, 1845, the application was lodged. The money was forthcoming, but the
companies did not work in partnership. The land was divided into two blocks
northern and southern —and possession was decided by lot. Each obtained rich properties,
one the celebrated “Princess Royal,” the other the “Burra Burra” mine.
Miners were obtained principally from Cornwall, and within a short time a large
and flourishing population
congregated on the Burra
Burra copperfield. During
the first six years nearly
80,000 tons of copper
ore were obtained, giving
a clear profit of ,£438,552.
The export of minerals
in 1846 was valued at
£143,231. Thousands of
people came to South
Australia from the other
colonies and from Eng-
land, either at their own
expense or under the
immigration regulations,

and the population rose
from 17,366 in 1844 to
22,390 in 1846, while of
the latter number only

During the next three
or four years the increase
was abnormal, until in
1850 there were 63,700
Burra Burra Mine, 1877
persons in the Province. By the end of 1847 upwards of 30 mines had been
opened in South Australia. Copper was thus discovered at an important juncture, and
helped greatly towards establishing permanent prosperity. The mines gave employment to
a large number of people, enabled tradesmen in Adelaide to thrive, and by improving the
local market procured a ready sale for farmers’ produce, such as corn, hay, and butter.
In addition to their other operations, the last-named were enabled to make considerable
sums with their teams. Carting from Adelaide through Gawler to Kapunda and the
Burra was exceedingly profitable—and the mines stimulated the growth of each of these

centres. Indirectly, the settlement of farmers around Kapunda, Penwortham, Clare, and
in districts further south, was materially promoted.
On October 25, 1845, Governor Grey relinquished his position. P'or the first
two or three years of his administration his actions created strong opposition ; and yet,
when it became known that he was leaving South Australia, the heartiness of popular regret
was undoubted, it being generally recognised that he had done much good for the Province.
“ He had lived down incessant, flagrant, and altogether unmerited abuse and opposition,”
sums up Hodder, “ conscious that he was in the right and that his motives were pure ;
he had proceeded from first to last in a straight line of policy, with judgment, decision,
and firmness, and his reward was in the fact that he had saved the Colony from a chaotic
J
state, and placed it on a sound and solid basis, and had proved himself one of the
foremost political and financial reformers of the day.” In June he introduced to the
Legislative Council a Bill to repeal the pilotage, tonnage, wharfage, and other port and
harbor dues an d
charges, an action
that “created great
surprise,” and “gave
unqualified satisfac-
tion.” Laudatory
public meetings were
held, and Governor
Grey might have
blushed at the
compliments paid
him during the next
month or two. The
members of the
Legislative Council
were convinced that
The Burra in 1898
“ the urbanity of his manner to them, and the courteous attention he had given to their
opinions and suggestions, had conduced to that perfect freedom of discussion which was
necessary to the efficiency of the Council as a legislative body, and so essential to
its obtaining the confidence of the whole community.” Addresses hurried in upon
him, and the “ voice of the whole people was heard in lamentation for their loss, and
praise for the leader they had so little appreciated.” South Australian and English
newspapers complimented him. Sir Robert Peel and others praised him in Parliament,
and Lord John Russell declared that he had solved a problem as “difficult” in “colonial
administration as could be committed to any man.”
Captain Grey left South Australia in the ship Elphinstone on Sunday, October 26,
and proceeded to New Zealand to assume control there at an exceedingly awkward crisis.
His vigorous and judicious action in suppressing a Maori rising; his distinguished
125
The Husbandmen ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


administrations in South Africa ; his prompt assistance during the Indian Mutiny ; his
subsequent brilliant career as a statesman in New Zealand ; his pathetic end in England
on September 19, 1898 ; and his burial among the patriots in St. Paul’s Cathedral, are
so well known as to require no detailed description here.
On October 14, 1845, Major Frederick Holt Robe, of the 87th Royal Irish
Fusiliers, arrived to undertake the duties of Governor. On the 25th he took the oaths
of office, and for “ prudential reasons ” was gazetted Lieutenant-Governor, so as “to
protect Captain Grey from any proceedings that might be taken against him by the
holders of certain dishonored bills drawn upon the British Government, and for which
the parties refused to take debentures.” Governor Grey had managed affairs so excellently
that Governor Robe had very little to do. The Province continued to prosper on the
lines laid down by Governor Grey ; and had it not been for his own want of tact,
Governor Robe’s term of office might have been as comfortable as the existence of an
English squire supervising his estates. The choice of such a gentleman to succeed Governor
Grey is inexplicable, except in the light of the old practice of appointing naval and
military officers to the Governorship of colonies.
Governor Robe had been Military Secretary at Mauritius and Gibraltar and was
a competent soldier —those were his recommendations for the post. He was described
by Levey as “a military gentleman of what is called the old school ; honorable and upright,
but inclined to think that everything ought always to be as it had been." Hodder says
he “knew nothing of the art of public speaking,” and was “an undisguised advocate of
High Church principles, and took no pains whatever to conceal his abhorrence of
Nonconformity.” Stow referred to him as “a bluff old soldier, of few words, hospitable
and kindhearted, but of Tory principles and no civilian experience.”
Governor Robe was in difficulties from the first. He quickly rescinded certain
resolutions for regulating the disposal of waste lands, and was called by a newspaper
“ principal land-jobber and auctioneer-in-chief (by appointment) to Her Majesty.” He
introduced to the Legislative Council a Lands Bill, which excited strenuous opposition, and
when an amendment, moved by Mr. |. Morphett, that the Bill be read that day six
months, was negatived, the non-official members walked out of the Chamber, thus leaving
the House without a quorum. Upon the initiative of Lord Stanley (a most unpopular
administrator of colonial affairs in England), clauses were introduced imposing a royalty or
reservation on minerals raised. Colonists loudly protested against the proposal at an
influential public meeting, and in a petition to Her Majesty. When receiving the latter,
Governor Robe delivered a stern and impolitic address. A royalty was imposed by
proclamation. An action was brought against the Lieutenant-Governor for refusing to
allow Mr. Giles (South Australian Company) to exercise his right of selection of mineral
sections near the Montacute mine; and for “appearing, or permitting any officer of the
Crown to appear, in the defence of the suit,” Mr. W. E. Gladstone, the new Secretary of
State for the Colonies, strongly reprimanded the Governor.
IOO

Being unfortunate in dealing with controversial questions, Governor Robe was soon
further embroiled. Ihe divisions in the Council had on two or three occasions been
even, and the Governor always exercised his casting vote in favor of the official party.
In 1846 he introduced a measure providing for a grant in aid of religion from the public
funds. 1 his was in opposition to the principles upon which the Province was founded,
and aroused a vast amount of religious controversy. Public meetings, deputations, and
memorials were frequent, but the Bill was passed “in opposition to the will of an
overwhelming majority of the people as expressed by petitions and public meetings.” A
grant was made, and the system lasted until 1851. The action of the Governor and
Legislative Council in this matter produced a condemnatory memorial to Her Majesty,
signed by 2,530 persons ; and also originated a general desire for representative government.
Ihe finances in 1847 were so satisfactory that a large sum was available for
immigration purposes, and for public works and buildings. An Education Bill was passed
fixing the rate of payment of teachers and constituting a Board of Education. A subsidy
of ,£3,000 was agreed to in aid of mail communication with England by steam.
In 1846 Governor Robe appealed to the home Government to be relieved from
his duties, but though his request was acceded to, he was not able to leave the Province
until August, 1848. His valedictory speech to the Legislative Council concluded with the
characteristic words, “ In relinquishing the duties which have devolved upon me under
the appointment of Her Majesty, I look to my Sovereign alone for any expression of
approbation.” “ With all his official faults,” says Hodder, “he was a man of stern
inflexibility of character, and of a high sense of duty ; a master in official routine, and a
prince in hospitality.”
Only a brief reference is possible in these pages to the travels of explorers and
the social condition of the community. Overlanders, during these years, had traversed
large tracts of country previously unknown, and pastoralists and explorers were successful
in penetrating a considerable portion of the territory which is now occupied. Pastoralists,
indeed, chiefly explored the land between the tracks of explorers, but, though their
journeys were frequently interesting, few' records of them have been preserved. In
1842-3, Captain Frome, with a party including Mr. Burr, went north to explore more
thoroughly the country traversed by Eyre, as far as Lake Torrens. On the way they
observed excellent lands, but the sterility of the furthermost point of their journey discouraged
a more extended tour. The interior had ugly and deathlike borders. In April, 1844,
Governor Grey, Mr. C. Bonney (Commissioner of Crown Lands), Mr. Burr (Deputy
Surveyor-General), Mr. George French Angas (son of the founder of the Province) and
Mr. Gisborne travelled the south-east country, and discovered rich tracts between the
Rivers Murray and Glenelg. In August of the same year, Mr. Darke and Mr. Theakstone
set forth from Port Lincoln towards F'owler Bay, to explore good country which rumor
said existed in that direction. The explorers travelled about 300 miles, and found promising
areas ; on the return journey Mr. Darke was killed by the natives.

The most important exploration was that made by one ot the discoverers of the
Province Captain Sturt. He was accompanied, among others, by Mr. j. Poole and Mr.
John McDouall Stuart. It was proposed to examine a chain of mountains believed to
lie parallel with the Darling; and on August 10, 1844, the party left Adelaide, business
being suspended in honor of the occasion. Sturt, with characteristic persistency, pushed
bravely into the desert country, and encountered tremendous difficulties. Ihe journey
was made in intensely hot weather, the thermometer at one place, fixed in the shade of
a large tree, rising to 135 Eahr. at 2.30 p.m. Notwithstanding an outbreak of scurvy
and the indisposition of members of the party, Sturt proceeded farther and farther into
the interior, carrying water with him. On February 13, 1845, he was nearly abreast of
Moreton Bay, in point of latitude, more than 200 miles west of the Darling, and in
longitude 141° 22';
“ and yet,” says he, “as
I looked around, and
from the top of a small
sandhill I had ascended,

returned to his depot, and, after recuperating, determined to make another attempt to discover
whatever lay hidden in the north. Mr. Poole, who had suffered from scurvy, was Instructed to
go back with a third of the men, but died on June 14 -a day after leaving the depot. Sturt
did his utmost to penetrate the waste places of the interior, and on the last occasion rode 843
miles in five weeks, and “ for 12 weeks was exposed to the perils of excessive heat, insufficient
food, and loathsome water, which resulted in a severe attack of scurvy and a painful affection
of the eyes. Ihe country, so far as he could ascertain, consisted of an immense stony
desert, which he could neither penetrate nor skirt. He found and named Cooper Creek
(after the then Chief Justice), and returned to Adelaide in January, 1846. The appearance of
the expedition in the streets of the city was interesting. The faces of the men were
almost hidden by long beards, and their skin was burnt almost to the color of the natives.
“ The wheels of the drays were caulked and stopped up with whatever materials could
be spared to fill up gaps and cracks to keep them together, the woodwork showing- that

every particle of oil and turpentine had been extracted by the heat of the sun ; but the
most singular object of attraction was the remainder of the dock of sheep following, from
habit, the last ol the drays as quietly and regularly as a rear-guard of infantry." “No
party, comments Harcus, “ ever suffered more than this did.”
A small band, under Mr. J. A. Horrocks, a pastoralist, in 1846 started to examine
the country north-west of the Mount Arden Ranges, but before their object was attained
the leader was killed by the accidental discharge of a gun. His body was brought back
and buried at Penwortham, near Clare, and upon his grave the camel (the only one in
the Province), which accompanied the men, was shot.
Ihe native tribes in the neighborhood of xVdelaide were gradually dying out, but
their numbers were constantly being swelled by arrivals from the country districts. They
did not abandon the city in its misfortunes, and gathered in numbers in the park lands.
In the days of Governor Grey’s unpopularity they took sides, and cried : “No good
Gubner Grey ; berry good Gubner Gawler—plenty tuck out ! ” The untutored minds of
the savages prevented them from understanding the niceties of European morality and
law, and in the country they repeatedly came into collision with the white people. On
the shores of the Coorong they assassinated a party of shipwrecked people during Governor
Gawler’s administration, and a punitive expedition was sent into the district. Two men
were hung on a tree overlooking the scene of some of the murders. In 1841 Major
O’Halloran went to the Murray to chastise marauding natives. Other native executions
took place during subsequent years, when overlanders were attacked, and one party, under
Mr. C. Dutton, in 1842, perished at their hands. Settlers were killed at Port Lincoln, in the
north, and in the south-east, and a large quantity of stock was destroyed. Governor
Grey, in pursuance of the policy that distinguished his later career, endeavored to institute
considerate laws on behalf of the aborigines. He encouraged the establishment of mission
stations, and introduced to the Legislative Council a measure providing for the reception
of the evidence of natives without oath, and a Bill to provide for the orphans of
aborigines. Shortly after this time the native question practically disappeared from the
arena of politics. In the settled districts the faces of aborigines are now seldom seen,
while in the back country they are gradually disappearing. According to the census of
1891, there were in South Australia (exclusive of the Northern Territory) 3.134
aborigines ; since that year the deaths have been double the births ! Mission stations
have frequently been established, and three still continue in existence. Crimes have been
perpetrated by the natives since 1848, but, except in remote territory, not sufficient to
intimidate settlement. The original occupiers of the land are fast passing away.
Owing to the presence of convicts from New South Wales and Tasmania, the
crime statistics were large. Bushranging was not unknown, revolting murders were
perpetrated in the country and in the city, and the stories of some of these men are
worthy of the gruesome sensationalism of Gaboriau. Though the original Act stipulated
that no convicts were to be introduced, an attempt was made to send to the Province from
England bands of Parkhurst lads ; but South Australia indignantly refused to receive them.

H ERE was a hope in some minds that Colonel Gawler would
k m be re-appointed Governor on the retirement of Governor
I Rohe, but it was not gratified. On August i, 1848. Sir
J Henry Edward Fox Young, with Lady Young, arrived in
conservative, inclined to be arrogant, and deficient in tact, Sir
Henry Young was courteous, conciliatory, and capable. He
J O J A
recognised that the spirit of the British colonist is determined,
ambitious, and somewhat impulsive, and seemed to immediately
—5 appreciate the vitality of the South Australian pulse. Governor
Young was the right man to take the Province by the hand
O J
on its emergence from serious depression. “ One of his highest qualities, said Bull, “ was
to know no party, and to be uninfluenced by any section of the community bent on
Ij l j j '
pushing their private interests to the injury of the community at large." He was anxious
to ascertain the opinions of the people, and to give effect to them wherever and
whenever such appeared to him to be wise.


The third son of Colonel Sir Aretas W. Young, and godson of General Edward
Henry Fox, brother of the celebrated Whig statesman, Sir Henry Young was possessed
of a good colonial training. He was born at Brabourne, near Ashford, Kent, on April
23, 1810, and was educated at Deans’ School, Bromley, Middlesex. At first intended for
the Bar he chose an official career, and on quitting school was appointed to the Colonial
Treasury at Trinidad. He served as aide-de-camp under Sir Benjamin d’Urban at
Demerara, and subsequently at St. Lucia filled such offices as secretary, treasurer, and
puisne judge of the Supreme Court. In 1847 he was knighted, and was appointed
Lieutenant-Governor of the eastern districts of the Cape of Good Hope. Owing to a renewal
of the Kaffir war, the Imperial Government transferred him to South Australia, believing that a
civil Lieutenant-Governor was not required at the former place at such a crisis. Sir
Henry Pottinger, the Governor and High Commissioner, recommended that his useful
services should be retained at Grahamstown, where Sir Henry Young had been stationed
for eight months, but before the despatches could be answered he had left the country.
A fortnight before leaving England for this Province, Sir Henry Young, now 38 years
old, had married the eldest daughter of Charles Marryat, of Park Field, Potter’s
Bar, who was a niece of the celebrated novelist, Captain Marryat.
No organised welcome was accorded to Governor Young on his arrival in South
Australia, but on August 2 he was the recipient of an address, in replying to which he
gave expression to the views which seemed to govern his whole administration. He
advocated the circulation ol scientific information among farmers and pastoralists, and the
formation ol “ self-supporting voluntary associations to receive, record, and arrange any
accounts and specimens transmitted to them of mining operations.” He also explained
“that the sphere of official government was wisely limited, and that the numerous methods
of social advancement in all free countries should derive their origin, maintenance, and
progress from the energies and resources of private individuals.” In November, when the
Legislative Council met, he further foreshadowed his policy : “ It only remains for me,
to give my sincere assurance that whether the lapse of time that may occur
before representative institutions be conceded to South Australia be long or short—and
my wish is that it may be brief I am cordially desirous, as far as my power extends, to
join with this Council as now constituted only in such legislation as shall be in unison
with the general opinion of the colonists.”
The inconsiderate, and often antagonistic, policy of Governor Robe —especially in
the matters of State aid to religion, and the royalty on minerals had stimulated in the
minds of South Australians a desire for a representative constitution. In that sense his
administration served a good purpose from a historical point of view, for his successor
quickly showed that he was sympathetic in this and other important questions, and
earned from Hodder the somewhat extravagant description of “an ideal Governor.” On
August 17, the Governor proved the sincerity of his desire to serve colonists by boldly
J J J
suspending the imposition of the obnoxious royalty on minerals until the Queen’s pleasure


should be learned. A public meeting five days later expressed satisfaction and gratitude
for this action, which received the formal authorisation of the Secretary of State for the
Colonies in the following year.
1 he question of representative government does not seem to have been advocated
as a great principle by South Australians at this time, although the actual desire for a
constitution had been in existence ever since the establishment of the Adelaide City
Council. Occasionally the common sentiment found expression, and more particularly when
the administrators pursued a policy opposed to the popular will. It would probably have
been dangerous to have had a representative constitution during the administration of
Captain Grey, but now both the population and the importance of colonial industries and
progress warranted some change. Under an administrator so agreeable and penetrating
as Sir Henry \ oung, the colonists would probably have been satisfied to go on as they
were, but the time might arrive when a successor would not be so considerate of
their \ lews. I During this administration two valuable institutions were established : a
representative Parliament and municipal government. Though there was no popular
clamor for a representative government, a new constitution was expected. The population
of South Australia had reached the number (50,000) specified in the Act of 1834 for a
constitution to be claimed. The British Parliament passed a new Act providing for
representative institutions in the Australian colonies, and this reached South Australia
m September, 1849- It authorised the separation of the colony of Victoria from New
South \\ ales, and the establishment in each ot the Australian colonies, which possessed a
certain population, of a Legislative Council —in South Australia to consist of 24 members,
16 of whom were to be elected, and eight to be nominated. Power was vested in these
Chambers to make laws, raise taxes, and appropriate public money, and establish
district councils; also to establish a General, or Federal, Assembly for the Australian
colonies, and, with the consent of Her Majesty in Council, to alter the constitution of the
respective Legislative Councils. Ihe “ General Assembly of Australia ” was to consist of
the Governor-General, and a House of Delegates elected by the respective Legislative
colonies, two members being allowed to each colony for every 15,000 inhabitants. Under
the clauses permitting the Legislative Council to alter the constitution of any particular
colony, power was given to establish, by any Act or Acts, the bicameral system of a
Council and a House of Representatives.
South Australians, indeed Australians generally, were not favorably impressed
with the idea of a General Assembly. They opposed it because, to use the words of
Mr. G. F. Angas, “the habits, disposition, social condition, and productions of each colony
are so diverse, the distances so great, and the means of conveyance so few and inconvenient
• • • ■” They believed that it would endanger colonial independence, and, because the
aggregate population was so small, that it would be impracticable to work out the scheme
for 20 years to come. The Federal idea was therefore quietly dropped, even though Sir
Charles Augustus Fitzroy was appointed by Her Majesty to be Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief of South Australia, while Sir Henry Young was entitled Lieutenant-


Governor of South Australia. Sir Charles had no occasion to exercise the functions thus
vested in him, but as early as 1850, an Australian conference was held- the beginning
of united action—to protest against the continuance of transportation to any Australian
colony.
The Act to provide for a representative Legislative Council in South Australia
was hailed with pleasure by the people, who characterised it as "wise, liberal, and
comprehensive.” In the Legislative Council Mr. J. Morphett carried resolutions affirming
that there should be government by a Governor and two Chambers, the upper of which
should be composed of hereditary members nominated by Her Majesty, the second of
members elected by the people. The colonists were determined to take full advantage
of their new powers, and for months before the Constitution actually arrived, evinced
considerable activity in canvassing the views of possible candidates, and in advancing
their particular theories. Associations and leagues were formed, their policies declaring for
universal suffrage, vote by ballot, and no nominee members ; one went so far as to
advocate annual elections. Democratic sentiment was vigorous, and the " South Australian
Political Association exerted a particularly powerful influence.
I he new Constitution arrived in the Province on January 16. 1851, in the ship'
Ascendant , and Mr. George bife Angas came in the same vessel to take up his residence
in South Australia. Since the foundation he had been laboring actively for South
Australia in interviews with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the management
of the South Australian Company, in correcting injurious reports concerning the Province,
in advocating its attractions, in supporting it during its time of depression, and in agitating
for a more popular system of government. An application was made to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies to permit him to convey the new Constitution to the Province, but,
on the ground that such a method of transmission was contrary to precedent, the honor,
which would have been appropriate and was well deserved, was denied him. A clerk
from the Colonial Office was instructed to deliver the package containing the important
document to the captain of the Ascendant. “ Put he had gone ashore,” says Hodder, "and as
the ship was on the point of sailing, the clerk, either through negligence or from not
understanding the importance of the papers with which he was entrusted, gave the package
to a steward who, being very busy, thrust it into the nearest place of safety. .. .
On arrival in Adelaide the proper authorities came on board to demand the Constitution
and receive it with due honor, for advices from England had informed them that it would
arrive in the Ascendant. Ihe captain, of course, protested that he had seen nothing of
it, and there was a great hue and cry for the lost Constitution, until one day shortly
after, in turning out the captain s soiled linen for the laundress, it was found, to the great
amusement of every one, at the bottom of the bag, where the steward had hurriedly
placed it for security.”
Ihe new Constitution was proclaimed on January 20, 1851, and on July 2 the
elections began. The excitement became more acute as the day approached, and among


the chief questions agitated were State aid to religion and the advisability of establishing
responsible government. Governor Robe’s Act making a grant out of public funds to
religious bodies had aroused considerable religious rancor, which seemed to intensify now
that representative government was established. A league for the “ maintenance of
religious freedom devoted all its energies to secure the return of members opposed to
the grant, and the expression of opinion of the country was undoubted —only four
members in favor of State aid were chosen. The honor of being the first elected
members of the Legislative Council fell to Messrs. F. S. Dutton, A. L. Elder, J. B.
Neales. R. D. Hanson, G. M. Waterhouse, C. S. Hare, J. Baker, S. Davenport, W.
Peacock, G. F. Angas, \V. Younghusband, G. S. Kingston, and J. Ellis, and Captains
Hall, John Hart, and C. H. Bagot. The non-official nominees were Messrs. John
Morphett, J. Grainger, E. C. Gwynne, and Major Norman Campbell ; and the officials
were Captain Charles Sturt, Colonial Secretary ; B. T. Finniss, Registrar-General ; R. D.
Hanson, Advocate-General ; and R. R. Torrens, Collector of Customs. The Council was
a gathering of highly competent men, some of whom had already distinguished themselves
in South Australian history, and most of whom were destined to vitally influence the
fortunes of the Province. No finer band of legislators could have been desired. During
the elections Mr. Hanson was appointed Advocate-General in succession to Mr. Smillie,
and Mr. William Giles was elected in his stead.
The vexed question of State aid to religion was brought to a final issue, and a
Bill to provide for the continuance of the grant was defeated by 13 votes to 10. An
Education Act was carried, and it was decided to grant Captain Sturt, who retired from
his official position, an annuity of £ 6OO. Since his last expedition the intrepid old
explorer had been almost totally blind. He now removed to England, and died at
Cheltenham, on June 16, 1869. While on his deathbed the honor of knighthood, so long
withheld and so well earned, was conferred upon him, but he did not live to assume the title.
By this time the Province had arrived at a stage ol advancement contrasting
brightly with its position 10 years before. The population had risen to 63.700, the
exports were valued at half a million sterling, local industries such as mining, agriculture,
and wool growing were flourishing, and the financial situation was satisfactory. Governor
Young had strong views on a public works policy, but before he could carry it out a
crisis was reached, which ultimately proved of permanent advantage. It was occasioned
by the discoveries of gold in New South Wales and Victoria, which so powerfully affected
the whole of Australia. Several hundred men left the Province for the Californian
diggings in 1849-50, and some concern was felt by settlers because of the exodus. Early
in 1851 a few parties proceeded to New South Wales, but when the Victorian fields were
discovered in the latter part of that year, what at first seemed a disastrous migration
took place. A report of the Chamber of Commerce announced that between 15,000
and 20,000 people left for the eastern colony in 1851. The copper mines were almost
deserted, wheat fields were left untended, and flocks were abandoned by the shepherds.
135
The Legislators ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


Thousands of wagons, drays, carts, and foot passengers pursued a tedious journey overland,
and thousands of men went to Victoria by sea. The Government, to stay the outflow,
offered £I,OOO for the discovery of a payable goldfield in South Australia, and this
amount was supplemented by a guarantee of £3OO by private subscription, but the reports
of fabulous discoveries were difficult to withstand, and the “gold mania” increased every
month. The city suffered as acutely as the country ; the business of tradesmen dwindled
away until they closed their doors and joined the gold seekers. Mercantile depression
was intense, and “ Hindley Street in 1851,” writes Mr. H. Hussey, “saw a repetition of
the state of things that had obtained 10 years before, the street being largely deserted.
Upwards of 50 shops in this thoroughfare alone were closed, and many private houses
were without tenants, as it was often the case that two families whose bread-winners had
gone to the diggings would occupy one house instead of two.”
The Banks were “drained of coin by the numbers who had left the Province,”
the hands employed at the Burra Burra copper mines “were reduced from 1,042 to 366,”
Government officers resigned, the police force by diminution in numbers became disorganised,
and wives and families were dependent on the Destitute Board for subsistence. The
withdrawal of specie “ involved the necessity on the part of the Banks of restricting their
note circulation, and of diminishing their discounts of commercial bills, which had the effect
of paralysing trade, and left the already glutted markets without purchasers for their
commodities.”
It was apprehended that this egress would permanently rob the Province of a
large portion of its population, but such was not the case. Indeed, by attracting hundreds
of thousands of people to Australia the Victorian goldfields were invaluable, apart altogether
from the wealth which the old settlers obtained. The land laws of Victoria were not
sufficiently liberal to hold the great mass, and South Australia, as well as other colonies,
gained an accession of population. By the beginning of 1852 numbers of people were
returning to Adelaide possessed of considerable quantities of rough gold which, however,
could not be accepted as a general mercantile tender. It is said that in two weeks
in February about ,£16,000 worth of the metal found its way to Adelaide, quite a large
number of South Australians being among the lucky diggers. Proposals were made for
utilising this gold as a circulating medium to overcome the financial congestion, and Mr.
George Tinline, Manager of the Bank of South Australia, suggested that the metal should
be assayed and moulded into stamped ingots of a fixed value. A memorial was presented
to Governor Young, and a special session of the Legislative Council was summoned. A
Bullion Bill was introduced, passed all its readings, and received the Governor’s assent on
the same day, and made “gold assayed and cast into ingots by a Government assayer a
legal tender, at the rate of £"3 10s. per ounce.” The Banks were authorised to issue new
notes against this gold, and to pay for the notes with the gold at the rate stated. “Sir
Henry Young,” writes Stow, “assumed great responsibility in assenting to this Bullion
Act, as it was called, for it was opposed to the currency laws of the British Empire, and
repugnant to Imperial legislation ; but he hazarded his own position to save the Colony


i 2 3 4 5
and the home authorities, recognising the greatness of the emergency, did not disapprove
of the action of the Governor.” The Act was in operation for one year.
On the first day of opening the Government Assay Office, gold to the value of
£IO,OOO was deposited. Larger quantities of the metal now arrived, partly because the
price given was higher than that in Victoria. Mr. Tolmer, Inspector of Police, suggested
that an overland escort should be established. To the advantage of South Australia
Governor Young acquiesced in the proposal, and Inspector Tolmer was appointed to the
command. He traversed the distance between Mount Alexander and Adelaide (338 miles)
in eight days, bringing with him in a spring cart gold valued at ,£18,456 9s. The first
escort reached the city in March, and the second (bearing 1,620 lbs. of gold, valued at
££0,000) in May. Arrangements were made for a monthly service, and also for the
conveyance by the escort of letters from South Australian diggers. Other escorts brought,
in 1852, gold valued at £"729,143 12s. 3d., principally from South Australian diggers.
The escorts met with many adventures during their long journeys.
Figures I and 2 are the obverse and reverse of a die which was intended for tokens, authorised, but not
issued, as a legal tender. Figures 3 and 4 are the obverse and reverse of a die used for £1 tokens. No. 5 was
struck owing to a flaw in No. 4, as shown in plate. Only a few issues were made from No. 4, the total
issues from Nos. 3, 4, and 5 being 24,648. Dies for £2 tokens do not appear to have been made.
The Bullion Act and the gold escort worked out very beneficially for South
O * J
Australia, and the diggers soon began to return. As early as April, May, and June,
1852, the arrivals in the Province exceeded the departures. By making gold a legal
tender, the financial paralysis was arrested ; the price of products began to rise ; many
successful returning diggers invested in land, and farming pursuits a year or two later
acquired unexampled vitality. As a result of the amazing increase of population in
Australia generally, the cost of living rose considerably, and in 1853 it was found necessary
to increase the salaries of South Australian Government officials. In the latter year the
crisis in South Australia had passed, and there was activity in all departments of trade
and industry. New discoveries occasionally caused a substantial emigration to Victoria,
but the vast proportion of the men returned, besides a percentage of new arrivals in
Australia, who, becoming satiated with gold-seeking, came to South Australia and invested
in land or established themselves in business. The escort was discontinued in December,
1853, after having conveyed to the Province about ,£2,000,000 worth of gold ; but for
several subsequent years diggers who had left their families in this Province continued on
the goldfields, and sent home a large proportion of their earnings.


One important result of the eastern goldfields was the market which they opened
up for South Australian produce and the natural effect of abundant gold in raising the prices
of commodities. This result was immediately demonstrated in the country, where hundreds
of new farms were established. The land north of Clare along the plains stretching to
Crystal Brook was gradually settled then and afterwards, and farmers were scattered over
the middle north in great numbers. Nor did this increase of agriculturists injuriously
affect pastoralists, whose Hocks grew in size and value, and there was an annual advance
in the wool export. Vessels laden with wheat and flour were constantly leaving for
Victoria; and while in 1851 the export of breadstuff's was valued at ,£73,359. in 1856
the amount had risen to £"556,371. Wool showed a corresponding increase; in 1851,
£"146,036 ; and in 1856, ,£412,163. In the latter year the stock in the Province represented
1.962,460 sheep, 272,746 cattle, and 22,260 horses. The copper mines also contributed
largely to the export. In 1846 the export of minerals amounted to £"146,231; in 1851,
£310,916; and in 1856, £408,042. The total export rose from £540,962 in 1851, to
£1,398,867 in 1856 -a magnificent increase, which, better than anything else, demonstrates
the additional importance attained by the Province.
With the revival and growth of vitality in trade and industry, Governor Young
was encouraged to pursue his plans with regard to public works, and the legislators,
helped by the people, were enabled to devote more attention to the cry for responsible
government. Sir Henry Young was greatly impressed with the possibilities of the River
Murray for settlement and navigation, and energetically sought to overcome the natural
difficulties that existed. A committee was appointed in 1849 to enquire into the practicability
of establishing communication between the Murray and Encounter Bay, also of establishing
o J o
places of shipment in St. Vincent and Spencer Gulfs. The Governor obtained reports in
1850 from Captain Lipson, R.N., and Mr. R. T. Hill, C.E., concerning the advisability
of building a railway from Goolwa, on the Murray, to Port Elliot. The Legislative Council,
on the motion of Captain Bagot, determined to offer a bonus of £2,000 each for the
first and second steamers that should navigate the Murray from Goolwa to the junction
of the Darling, it being desired to draw to the Province the products of the Riverina ;
and in the following year Sir Henry Young proceeded up the river in a whaleboat, to
decide by personal observation whether it was navigable. The bonus caused two gentlemen
to construct steamers, and in 1853 Mr. W. R. Randell, a young settler, launched a small
craft, built by himself, and proceeded beyond the Darling junction. Shortly afterwards
Mr. Francis Cadell launched a larger steamer, and, with a Government House party,
ascended the river to the same point. As the latter boat more nearly came within the
requirements of the Legislative Council resolution, Mr. Cadell obtained the bonus, but
Mr. Randell was presented by the Government with £3OO, and by the public with a
purse of sovereigns. As an outcome of the reports of Captain Lipson and Mr. Hill, Sir
Henry Young spent upwards of £20,000 in a breakwater at Port Elliot, and in a tramline
running from there to Goolwa ; but the place was ill chosen, and the money was practically
I I 2
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Legislators


wasted. In later years the harbor at Port Victor was improved, where a breakwater 1,000
feet in length has been formed.
During the administration of Governor Young the sum of ,£400,000 was
authorised to be spent In railway construction, the principal schemes being a railway to Port
Adelaide (1851) and a line to Gawler (1854). A further sum of ,£IOO,OOO was set apart
for deepening and improving the harbor at Port Adelaide, and these sums formed the
nucleus of the national debt of South Australia.
M can while, events were proceeding towards the realisation of the expectations
cherished by colonists of a system of responsible government. In the years following
the inauguration of representative institutions, the electors had quietly but plainly shown
that they desired a further instalment of self-government, and Governor Young heartily
entered into the spirit of their demands. To his sympathy, intelligence, and statesmanship
the Province and the city are indebted for their greatest civic privileges. A fuller
measure of parliamentary representation was advocated in 1852-3, both among the public
and in the Legislative Council. Sir Henry Young communicated the desire of the
colonists to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and in July, 1853, despatches were
read in the Council announcing that upon certain conditions South Australia could obtain
control of its internal affairs, with the management and revenue of the waste lands of
the Crown.
Two Bills were thereupon introduced —one to constitute a Parliament consisting
of a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assemblv, the other to grant a Civil List to
Her Majesty. It was provided in the former, upon the suggestion of the Imperial
Government, that the Legislative Council should consist of nominee members, and that
the Assembly should be elected by the people for three years. Newspapers condemned
the proposal of a nominee Chamber, and, when the Bill was under discussion, Mr. J. H.
Fisher moved—“ That, in the proposed Bill for constituting a Parliament for South Australia,
this Council is of opinion that the Copper House should be elective.” P'or three days members
discussed Mr. P'isher’s motion, and many of the speeches were brilliant and patriotic. The
nominee principle was repugnant to them ; but several members compromised with the
Government on the understanding that the nominated Upper Chamber should be amended
after nine years upon the vote in two consecutive sessions, with a dissolution between, of
two-thirds of the members of the Assembly. Under these circumstances Mr. Fisher was
defeated by a majority of eight votes, and the second and third readings were carried by
a majority of five. The Civil List Bill was also passed.
These measures were forwarded to England, but colonists in public meetings and
memorials continued to object to nomineeism ; but before there was any positive result
from their active opposition, Governor Young had been appointed Governor of Tasmania,
and sailed for that colony on December 20, 1854. As an administrator he was an excellent
successor to Captain Grey, and his actions at once commanded the gratitude of colonists and
139

the approbation of the Imperial Government. In appraising the value of popular sentiment
and opinion, and in obeying it in important particulars, he was the man for the time. He
manifested on certain occasions exceptional courage, especially when he suspended the
mineral royalty and assented to the Bullion Act ; and the Imperial Government, invariably
jealous in matters of unauthorised responsibility, must have had great confidence in his wisdom
to permit such assumptions of power. In Tasmania, Sir Henry Young successfully introduced
responsible government; he held office there until 1861, when he retired from the colonial
service; and he died in London on September 18, 1870.
Mr, Boyle Travers Finniss, the Colonial Secretary, who arrived in the Province in
the Cygnet in 1836, administered the affairs of the Province from December 20, 1854, to
June 8, 1855. The Imperial Government appointed Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell to
succeed Governor Young, and he landed in South Australia from the steamship Burra Burra
on June 7, 1855, when he had an enthusiastic reception. Sir Richard, like his predecessor,
was not new to colonial office. Born in 1815, he was a son of the Rev. Dr. MacDonnell,
Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, where, in 1839, Sir Richard took his degree of Master
of Arts, and in 1844 that of Doctor of Laws. He was called to the English Bar in 1841,
and from 1843 to 1847 was Chief Justice of Gambia, during which period he consolidated
the laws of that colony, and travelled extensively into the interior of Africa. In 1847 he
was appointed Governor of Gambia, and subsequently, while visiting one of the native
kings, “ fell into an ambush treacherously laid for him, and was within an ace of being-
assassinated.” Four hundred men marched into the country and chastised the rebels. Sir
Richard made exploring trips into the interior, and extended the limits of British commerce.
In 1852 he became Governor of St. Lucia, and afterwards of St. Vincent. He was knighted
in February, 1855, and a few days later embarked for South Australia.
Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, adopting the policy of Sir Henry Young, lent
every support to the aspirations of the people of South Australia. Says Loyau in “ Representative
Men of South Australia”:—“He possessed considerable ability and energy of character,
which, added to a pleasant and genial manner, made him exceedingly popular.” The Province
continued to advance under his regime, and no obstacle was placed in the way of the demand
for responsible government. After occupying his time on delicate points connected with
immigration matters, Sir Richard joined the Council in a reconsideration of the Constitution
Bill. Such intense opposition was shown to nomineeism that the Imperial Government,
after receiving memorials from the Province, decided to return the Bill to South Australia
for further consideration. In August, 1855, the Government Gazette published a despatch
from Lord John Russell, from which it appeared that Sir Henry Young and his advisers
had “misconceived the intentions of Her Majesty’s Government in granting certain enlarged
powers to the local Legislature.” The Imperial Government did not consider the Bill
expressed the wishes of the majority, and recommended that a free and an independent
decision should be obtained by a dissolution of the elected portion of the Legislative Council.
P'our days afterwards the dissolution of the Council was announced. The newspapers


did their utmost to awaken the people to the great importance of the elections, and to the
advisability of getting rid of "the incubus of nomineeism.” “We are laying the foundations,”
remarked the Register , “of a new political and social state. We are deciding whether
public opinion shall be taken as the source of legislative authority, or whether the people
are yet to be held in the leading-strings of Imperial domination.” The elections in most of
the districts were held on September 20 and 21, in places amid scenes of disorder. At West
Adelaide, where a popular candidate, Mr. J. H. Fisher, w r as defeated, mounted troopers
had to rush with drawn swords into a crowd of partisans to disperse them.
Ihe new Council met on November 1. Governor MacDonnell was in favor of
a single chamber ; and, before the dissolution of the old Council, had issued “an elaborate
outline of a Constitution Bill, which did not receive a hearty welcome. He now declared
that he would bow to the demands of the people, and introduced a more advanced measure.
Even this was not popular, and was subjected to considerable amendment in committee.
The Legislative Council decided to have two Chambers, both elective. The Upper House
was to consist of 18 members, elected for 12 years by the whole Province as one constituency.
Six members were to retire every four years; the qualification for electors was fixed at
freehold, £\o per annum leasehold with three years to run or right of purchase, and
a tenancy valued at I he House of Assembly was to consist of 36 members, elected
for three years by a certain number of districts divided on the basis of population. Manhood
suffrage, with six months registration, was declared ; all voting to be by ballot. There
were to be five responsible Ministers, who were to be elected by the constituencies. Money
Bills were to originate in the Assembly, and official appointments and dismissals were vested
in the Ministry. No Governor’s warrant for the payment of money was to be valid unless
countersigned by the Chief Secretary. A Civil List was fixed, and the Constitution Bill
in its amended form passed its third reading on January 2, 1856.
Governor MacDonnell, in forwarding the measure to England, recommended that
the royal assent should be given; and on October 24, 1856, the new Constitution was
returned unaltered, having received the assent of Her Majesty on June 24. Responsible
government was proclaimed on the same day, as were the members of the first Ministry.
Mr. B. T. Finniss, Colonial Secretary under the old regime, became first Premier and
Chief Secretary ; Mr. R. I). Hanson, Attorney-General; Mr. R. R. Torrens, Treasurer ;
Mr. A. H. P'reeling, Commissioner of Public Works ; and Mr. C. Bonney, Commissioner
of Crown Lands and Immigration. By another proclamation, on the same day, the Crown
vested in the colonial Legislature all the unsold and unappropriated territory of the Province.
During the next few months the Ministry was engaged in establishing the State
departments under the new system, and preparations were made for the elections, which
w r ere held on March 9, 1857. A public holiday was declared, and the proceedings were
orderly throughout. There were 27 candidates for the 18 seats in the Legislative Council,
and 62 for the 36 in the Assembly, nine candidates being unopposed.


The original members of the Legislative Council under responsible government
were : —G. F. Angas, H. Ayers, C. H. Bagot, J. Baker, S. Davenport, C. Davies,
C. G. Everard, J. H. Fisher, A. Forster, A. H. Freeling, E. C. Gwynne, G. Hall,
T. S. O’Halloran, J. Morphett, A. Scott, W. Scott, E. Stirling, and W. Younghusband.
The original members of the House of Assembly were For City of Adelaide —R. R.
Torrens, R. D. Hanson, F. S. Dutton, B. T. Finniss, J. B. Neales, W. H. Burford ;
Port Adelaide —J. Hart, J. B. Hughes ; West Torrens— L. Scammell, J. W. Cole ; Yatala
J. Harvey, C. S. Hare; Gumeracha—A. Blyth, A. Hay; East Torrens —G. M. Waterhouse,
C. Bonney; The Sturt —T. Reynolds, J. Hallett ; Noarlunga —T. Young, H. Mildred;
Mount Barker— F. E. H. W. Krichauff, (. Dunn; Onkaparinga W. Milne, W. B. Dawes;
Encounter Bay —B. H. Babbage, A. F. Lindsay ; Barossa—W. Duffield, H. Dean ; The
Murray—D. Wark ; Light —J. T. Bagot, C. Smedley ; Victoria — R. R. Leake; Burra and
Clare—G. S. Kingston, M. Marks, PL J. Peake; and blinders —M. MacDermott.
The new Parliament assembled on April 22, about yooo persons congregating on
North Terrace to watch the arrival of the Governor and the members. Mr. J. H. P'isher
was chosen President of the Council, and Mr. G. S. Kingston, first Deputy-Surveyor
General and a founder ot Adelaide, was elected Speaker of the Assembly. The new
members entered upon their task with enthusiasm, and the vitality among them was quickly
evidenced in rapid changes of Government, and in the influence and weight which some of
their earliest measures had over the progress of the Province. Commenting on the
establishment of responsible government the London Times wrote: —“It must be confessed
that it is rather an odd position for a new community of rising tradesmen, farmers, cattle
breeders, builders, mechanics, with a sprinkling of doctors and attorneys, to find that it is
suddenly called upon to find Prime Ministers, Cabinets, a Ministerial side, an Opposition
side, and all the apparatus of a Parliamentary Government— to awake one fine morning and
discover that this is no longer a colony, but a nation, saddled with all the rules and traditions
of the political life of the mother country.”
It is now time to turn to affairs relating specially to Adelaide and its neighborhood.
I his being the capital, the changes of Government influenced to a particular degree the
dignity of the city. The progress made throughout the Province in mineral, agricultural,
and pastoral pursuits very considerably affected the commercial centre. Large buildings
arose, and the city, by increase of population and by reason of the greater wealth of the
community and productiveness of the country, gained a more substantial appearance. The
“ newness ” which was its characteristic in former years was slowly disappearing, and it began
to have a settled, permanent look. Each large extension of wealth in the country districts
was eventually reflected in the capital, so that Adelaide was by this time becoming pretentious,
and its inhabitants more commercially solid.
While Governor Young helped the Province to obtain representative, and then
responsible government, he did not pass over the claims of the city to local government.
Unlike his two immediate predecessors, he was willing to devote substantial sums of money
116
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Legislators


to improving its streets, and also to give ear to the desire of residents for a municipal
institution. On February 7. 1849, a public meeting proposed to establish a corporation,
with the title of "The Chairman, Councillors, and Citizens of Adelaide,” and presented a
memorial to that effect to Governor \ oung. Not immediately complying with its prayer,
the Administrator, with the consent of the Legislative Council, transferred the affairs of the
city to a commission of five persons, called the “City Commission.” The Governor appointed
Captain Freeling, R. E.—afterwards Sir Arthur Freeling, Bart.- and Messrs. S. Davenport,
I - S- Dutton, W, Blyth, and R. F. Newland as Commissioners, and in September these
gentlemen began their duties. Mr. E. S. Webber was appointed clerk. They were
empowered to levy rates, and were required to keep streets and bridges in proper order,
to construct sewers, and establish waterworks. Ihe sum of £4,000 was voted from the
general revenue in 1849 for the construction and maintenance of the streets of Adelaide, and
,£6,000 for the erection of bridges over the Torrens within the city bounds. The
Commissioners remained in office until June, 1852, and effected extensive improvements.
In 1850-1 the Legislative Council voted £"7,500; and rates, dues, and fees brought in
,£6,401 13 s - 4T more. bp to December, 185T the expenditure in the city amounted to
-£ 1 5’449 j 4 s - anc l from January to September, 1851, the amount laid out was
1 3 *h l 7 H 8 - Altogether they expended ,£33,104 is. id. during their administration,
which terminated on May 31, 1852.
bor three years an Act had been on the Statute-books authorising the constitution
of a municipal corporation. However efficient the City Commissioners might be, they
were not likely to give such satisfaction as a representative institution, especially when
residents were required to pay rates. Governor Young, consistently with his general policy,
introduced into the Legislative Council a Bill to incorporate the citizens of Adelaide under
the style of “ Ihe Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors, and Citizens of Adelaide.” This was a
revised copy of a measure drawn up by Governor Robe and his officers in 1847, and
was passed in August, 1849. The corporation was to be composed of four Aldermen
and twelve Councillors ; the Mayor was to be elected from among them by themselves.
The city was divided into four wards, named after previous Governors—Hindmarsh, Gawler.
Grey, and Robe ; and every male householder who had property in the city, and who lived
within it or within seven miles of it, was entitled to vote at the municipal elections.
Owing to an omission, the occupiers of stables, slaughter-houses, and breweries, although
compelled to pay rates, did not receive a vote by right of their premises. To prevent
difficulties such as beset the first Corporation, the Act provided that “ any councillor who
should resign after accepting office, or who should refuse to act after being elected, should
pay a fine of not less than £"25 nor more than £"50.” The same rule applied to aldermen,
assessors, and auditors, but the Mayor was made liable to a fine of not less than £SO
nor more than £IOO. Ihe Act, however, could only become operative when proclaimed
by the Governor on the petition of not less than 400 of the ratepayers, representing property
to the value of ,£15,000.


The crisis in local affairs caused by the Victorian goldfields was partly answerable
for this Act being so long held in abeyance. The depression in the city being so keen,
property fell in value, and there was a startling diminution in the rates. Ihe revival in
1852 altered the position, and Sir Henry Young proclaimed the Corporation on June 1.
Thus, after the lapse of nine years, residents returned to citizenship, and they took full
advantage of their opportunities. Although not with equal effusiveness and expectation
as on the former occasion, they entered upon their duties with greater deliberation. Adelaide
was no longer a mushroom city, with its forced growth of lavish expenditure : it had
attained the dignity and soundness which is only brought by years of experience and trial
and accumulation of wealth.
At the elections the citizens returned to compose the City Council were
Aldermen Peter Sherwin, Judah Moss Solomon, William Paxton, and Peter Gumming;
Councillors—Daniel Fisher, E. B. W. Glanfield, F. H. Faulding, R. A. Fiveash, C. G. E,
Platts, J. FI. Fisher, S. Stocks, H. C. Beevor, E. Lawson, F. Haire, Isaac Breaker, and
J. Skitter. On June 9, Mr. J. H. Fisher, the pioneer occupant of the chair under the
former Corporation, was elected Mayor; Mr. E. S. Webber was appointed Acting Town
Clerk, but was superseded by Mr. W. T. Sabben on July 15; and Mr. G. Tinline received
the appointment of City Treasurer. Arrangements were made for premises, and Town Acre
203 (see Chapter V.) was again taken over, but no money was expended during the year.
In pursuance of the Act, fresh elections were held on December 1, when Mr. J. H. Fisher
was re-elected Mayor.
There were certain defects in the Municipal Act which Councillors desired to have
removed, and they appointed a committee to undertake the revision. Some difficulty was
experienced in securing the support of the Legislative Council to these, and hence the
relationship between the two bodies became strained. A clause in the Act limiting the
expenditure on municipal salaries to 10 per cent, of the receipts gave especial umbrage. In
1852 an Act was passed declaring that the limit to such expenditure must be ,£2,000 a
year, an advantage which, however, gave little more satisfaction than the previous
arrangement. The question continued to excite attention until 1854, when the section
referring thereto was repealed. Other questions were raised, such as the advisability of
obtaining an efficient water supply, a proper system of sewerage, an Act to regulate buildings
in the city, and an Act to regulate fines imposed on persons refusing to act after being
elected to a municipal office. There was considerable discussion as to the system to be
pursued in assessing the city. According to one record the assessment in 1852 amounted to
£136,800, in 1853 to £112,100, and in 1854 to £130,684. The rates, dues, fees, and
grants from Government up to September, 1853, amounted to £12,056 2s. qd., some
£6,253 11s. of which were laid out in improving the streets, and the thoroughfares now
began to look attractive. In December, 1853, Mr. J. 11. Fisher was re-elected Mayor, but
several changes took place in the personnel of the Council.


The records for the years immediately following these deal principally with civic
expenditure, and have no interest for the general reader. In 1854 the powers of the
Corporation were extended by an Act of the Legislative Council, mostly providing for street
improvements, for the adoption of regulations referring to the erection of buildings, and for
the effectual scavenging of the city. But other powers usually reposed in a municipal council
were withheld, and were not extended until the year 1861. At the elections of 1854 Mr. J.
Hall was appointed Mayor, Mr. J. H. Fisher, one of the most esteemed and patriotic of
citizens, having retired from the Council. From 1855 to 1858 Mr. J. Lazar was Mayor.
The progress of the city is evidenced in the increased value of the assessments —1855,
,£148,504; 1856, ,£160,598; and 1857, £"189,514. The population in 1855 was 18,259.
In the municipal year 1854-5 expensive litigation took place on a claim made by
Bishop Short, the Anglican Bishop of Adelaide, to a portion of Victoria Square as a site
for a cathedral. An early plan of the city showed at the southern end of the square a small
vignette, which was “intended apparently to mark a site for a church." The plan was
destroyed in the fire which took place in the Government Hut in 1839, but early settlers
did not consider that the acre had been intended for the Church of England. In March,
1848, Governor Robe conveyed the acre in Victoria Square to the Bishop. The Municipal
Act of 1849 vested in the Corporation all the park lands and public reserves within the city
bounds, but the squares were not scheduled. The Corporation, having received no notice
that the cathedral acre had been alienated by the Crown, took charge of Victoria Square,
as of the rest of the vacant spaces known as squares. In 1854 the Corporation spent
£1,106 13s. Bd. in improving this particular square; but in 1855 Ur. Short claimed the
land, and demanded possession. The Corporation refused to recognise his right. Four
barristers of the Supreme Court gave a written opinion that the Anglican Bishop’s claim
was just, and, fortified with this, the latter brought an action of trespass against the
Corporation in the Supreme Court, after having ineffectually offered to refer the matter to
arbitration. The case was tried on June 28 and 29, and the jury “ returned a special verdict
to the effect that the land had been originally set apart for the use and recreation of citizens,
thus rejecting the Bishop’s claim.” Although Dr. Short would have been justified in carrying
the case to Her Majesty in Council on appeal, he allowed the matter to drop, after having
pursued the claim with moderation and good feeling. By this finding of the jury one of
the prettiest prospects in Adelaide was retained to the citizens. In the same year an Act was
passed which reserved 40 acres of ground at the eastern end ot North Terrace for a Botanic
Garden, the reserve made in the original survey manifestly being too small for such a
purpose. Mr. G. Francis, F.H.S., was appointed the first Director, and he framed the
general plan which the charming gardens now follow.
Numerous improvements were effected or suggested during the years 1854-7. I p
till 1852 there had been three bridges inside the boundaries of the city, and two outside;
and all these, except one at Thebarton, had been washed away by lloods. Traffic was


at times wholly suspended, and much annoyance and discomfort were caused. A bridge
connecting King William Street with North Adelaide was erected at a cost of ,£22,778 14s. 3d.,
and was opened for traffic in June, 1856. The building of a town hall fronting King
William Street was proposed in 1857, but the funds in possession of the Corporation were
not sufficient to enable the work to be carried out. Proposals were also made in 1857 for
enhancing the appearance of the River Torrens by clearing and regulating its bed, constructing
weirs, and planting and grassing its banks ; but, for the same reason, they were unsuccessful.
The approaches to the city were improved in that year by the fencing in of the park lands
and by having portions of them planted. In 1856 a Mayor’s Court was established, but
The Gorge Weir, River Torrens
was abolished a couple of years later. In the same year Mr. W. A. HuMies resigned
his position as a Councillor, and became Town Clerk. The affairs of the Council were
not in a very happy condition in 1856-7, and there was a good deal of litigation and
several resignations.
The question of a water supply for the city excited attention. Residents since
the foundation of Adelaide had been dependent on water-carts, and, of course, were put
to great inconvenience. A Waterworks Act was passed in 1856, and authorised the raising
of ,£280,000 by loan on bonds terminable at various periods, and bearing 6 per cent, interest.


A reservoir capable of holding 180,000,000 gallons was to be formed, and a weir was
constructed, but “ proved on trial to be so defective as to be useless.” Alterations and
additions were eventually effected, and a sufficient supply was obtained.
Ihe “railway mania’ in England in the forties was reflected to some extent in
South Australia, and from 1846 to 1851 several attempts were made to form companies
to build a line from Adelaide to Port Adelaide. As mentioned on a preceding page, a
Bill providing for its construction was passed by the representative Legislative Council in
1851, and on April 21, 1856, the railway was formally opened to traffic. The Governor
presided at a banquet at Port Adelaide, and the day was characterised as one of unique
importance. By this means the old difficulty raised by Governor Hindmarsh —that the
capital should be on the seaboaid—was largely overcome, and Adelaide gained incalculable
Thorndon Park Reservoir
advantages. In 1854, before the retirement of Governor Young, a Bill was passed providing
for the construction of a line to Gawler, which, it was proposed, would eventually be carried
on to Kapunda and the Burra; and the first section to Salisbury—was opened to traffic
on October 5, 1857.
The electric telegraph was also introduced during this period. In November,
1855, a private line erected by Mr. James Macgeorge, from the city to Port Adelaide,
was put in operation ; and in July of the following year a line to Melbourne was opened.
The system was gradually extended to suburban towns and more distant parts of the Province.
While all these advances were being made in Adelaide, its neighborhood was not
at a standstill. The population, as it increased, spread over the vicinity, and especially


3 -• imui uiMkHM
—«s*Tl
eastward towards the hills. Beyond Kent Town two suburbs had attained particular
importance, and derived names from London suburbs Kensington and Norwood. It is
not possible to give reliable data concerning the founders of these towns, but for several
years the number of residents in them had been increasing. Glenelg and I ort Adelaide
J
had also grown in dimensions, population, and wealth.
Kensington and Norwood were the first suburbs to obtain a separate municipal
o
institution. I hey were incorporated under one Municipal Council in 1833. Iwo years later
Port Adelaide and Glenelg were granted local government; and Gawler in 1857. In
November, 1832, a District Councils Act passed the Legislative Council, and under it
power was given to various districts to tax themselves for the making and management of
roads, bridges, and public buildings.
The notice proclaiming the constitution of a Municipal Corporation for “ the
villages of Kensington, Norwood, and Marryatville ” appeared in the Government Gazette

this position he filled until 1858, when he was succeeded by Mr. F. B. Carlin. In 1856
Kent Town was proclaimed a ward, to be called Kent \\ ard, and its first representatives
were Alderman L. B. Carlin and Councillors J. Skelton and T. Haldane. Mr. J. E.
M oulden was the first Town Clerk of Kensington and Norwood. In 1859 the first d own
Hall erected in South Australia was opened by the Corporation at the south-east corner of
the Parade. Upon the demolition of the building in 1898, a piece of parchment was
found under the corner-stone, with the following engrossed on it : —“ The corner-stone of
this Town Hall of Kensington and Norwood was laid on the 30th day of July, in the

Glenelg, equally with Kensington and Norwood and Port Adelaide, had arrived
at a stage of development when it was entitled to the privilege of governing its own affairs.
As the favorite watering-place near Adelaide, and as the most historical site in South
Australia, it had received a fair share of attention from the public, but, after it was granted
municipal government, important improvements were effected in its appearance and attractions.
Ihe Corporation was proclaimed in August, 1855, and the first meeting of the Council
was held on December 10 of that year at St. Leonards Hotel. There were present
Aldermen Monteith and Colley, and Councillors Lee, Atkinson, Trevenen, Barclay, DeHone,
and Hodges. Mr. R. B. Colley was elected Mayor, and Mr. W. R. Wigley I own Clerk.
Ihe number of ratepayers on the roll in 1857 was 149, and the assessment in 1861 was

AUSTRALIA very appropriately obtained responsible
government—her legal majority in her twenty-first year. In
J '857, when she was permitted to manage her own estate, the
* condition of her patrimony was as agreeable as she could
wish. The population was set down at 109,917 persons; the
land alienated at 1,557,740 acres ; the land cultivated at
ip 235,965 acres ; the stock owned at 2,075,805 sheep, 310,400
cattle, and 26,220 horses ; the annual value of imports at
cl ,£1,623,052, and of exports £"1,744,184; the number of
flourmills at 70; manufactories, 226; post-offices, 110; letters
passing through post-office 934,550, and newspapers 849,946 ;
day-schools 167, scholars 7,480 ; Sunday-schools 192, scholars
10,576 ; and places of worship 300, with accommodation for 50,000 persons.
While in the years 1842-8 the Province actually began to produce, it was not
until the period under review that any very pronounced expansion took place. Partly by
the help of the Victorian goldfields, the producers now multiplied, and the returns from the
wheat lands and sheep stations became really substantial. This, indeed, is the dominant
feature in the local history of 1857-68, although in later years still greater comparative
developments have to be chronicled.


At first, responsible government was accompanied by a measure of depression.
For four consecutive years the seasons were dry and the crops below the average. With
the large introduction of gold from Victoria, and the considerable investment in property,
there had been a boom in land ; high wages ruled, fictitious values were created, and
o o
improvident habits became too common. These bad years hurried on the usual re-action.
In 1857-8 the depression was somewhat severe. The laboring classes do not
appear to have recognised that such difficulties inevitably assail every country practically
dependent on its soil for subsistence, and, in particular, one that is young. They believed
that it was detrimental to their interests, and presumably to the interests of the Province,
to continue to introduce immigrants. Many men were out of employment, and an increase

of population would, it was said, reduce wages and intensify the troubles of the unemployed.
People of opposite views declared that the rates of wages were so high that capital could
not be profitably engaged. A “ Political Association” adopted such an advanced programme
as cessation of immigration at public expense, equal political rights for all citizens, payment
of members of Parliament, taxation of unimproved land alienated from the Crown, law-
reform, and a free and unshackled Press. The central principle of the Association seemed
to be embraced in a clause which announced ; “We believe that property should never
be considered in comparison with manhood ; that the happiness and well-being of the mass
is paramount to the aggrandisement of the few.”


As is not uncommon, the sufferers attacked the Government. They asked that the
Ministry should be removed from office, and inveighed in heated terms on a vote of
for immigration, which one resolution at a public meeting excitedly denounced as “a policy
wanting in humanity, insulting to the understanding of the meanest capacity, likely to
compromise the present peace and order of the community, and opposed to the future
prosperity of the Colony. A deputation waited on Sir Richard MacDonnell, who thus
expressed himself regarding assisted immigration :—“ In my opinion the want of the Colony
is the want most felt by all new countries worth inhabiting, namely, more people to inhabit
it and cultivate the soil. Ihe way to make the country wealthy is not necessarily by
stopping the influx of people. I have never known immigration, well conducted, to interfere
with legitimate wages ; but, on the other hand, an influx of inhabitants, unattended with
a corresponding influx of capital, is not, I admit, the way to promote the healthy and
prosperous settlement of any country.”
Moonta Mines
The crisis, as it was bound to do, adjusted itself without the intervention of
Parliament or the Government. After the lean years came years of plenty, and in each
successive season the area under cultivation was increased. An abundant harvest is a remedy
for most ills in South Australia, and in the early sixties prosperity returned to city and
country. The area cultivated in 1858-9 was 264,452 acres, of which 188,703 acres were
under wheat. The yield from the latter was 2,109,544 bushels, averaging u bushels 1 1 lbs.
per acre. Occasionally red rust or a dry spring injured the crops, but the returns were
never seriously affected until 1867-8, by which time a dry cycle with low prices had amiin

made its appearance. In 1866-7 the area cultivated had risen to 739,714 acres, with
457,628 acres under wheat, yielding an average of 14 bushels 20 lbs. per acre. The total
area cultivated in 1867-8 was 810,734 acres, including 550,456 acres of wheat, from which
the return was 4 bushels 20 lbs. per acre. The cost of cultivating wheat in the Province
comparable with most countries, is low, and the profits are therefore more substantial than

the yields would suggest. “ Tickle the land with a hoe, and it laughs with a harvest,” was
at this time a familiar saying in South Australia. In 1866 the value of the export of
breadstuffs amounted to ,£645,401, figures which were almost doubled five years later. The
export of wheat, flour, and bran and pollard in 1867 was valued at ,£1,034,461. Ihe
principal counties producing breadstuffs in 1868 were in the following order: —Light,
Adelaide, Gawler, Stanley, and Hindmarsh.
The profits of the pastoralist were greater than those of any other section of the
community. “ One proof of the remunerative character of the pursuit is,” wrote P'rederick
Sinnet in 1862 in “An Account of the Colony of South Australia,” “that all sorts and
conditions of men have thriven in it indiscriminately. Gentlemen from England, without
experience ; professional men, turning to the bush rather than to their professions ; men of
capital or education, or neither, or both —representatives of all these classes have grown

wealthy by squatting, and that not in isolated cases, but almost as a general rule.” Even
so early as this in the history of the Province the evils of absenteeism were at work, and
scathing remarks were made upon it by the democratic party. Exploration was opening
up new tracts of pastoral country, and by 1868 stock grazed upon the territory north of
Port Augusta and throughout the South-East. Magnificent estates were formed, comparable
with the best wool-growing properties in the world. The example of the South Australian
Company, in introducing superior strains of sheep, was followed by individual pastoralists,
and the best breeds of the old and new worlds were acclimatised.
The export of wool was often of greater value than that of breadstuffs, and the
flocks increased encouragingly. P'rom 1,962,460 sheep in the Province in 1856, the number
ten years later rose to 3,038,356. In the same period there was a decrease of cattle and
an increase of horses -Cattle in 1856, 272,746 ; in 1866, 123,820; horses in 1856, 22,260;

in 1866, 70,829. Ihe value of the wool export in 1856 was 12,163 : ' n 1861, £623,007 ;
in 1566, ,£1,064,486; in 1867, £1,144,341 ; and in 1868, £1,346,323. In these figures are
small amounts obtained for wool which the geographical position of the Province drained
from the neighboring colonies of New South Wales and Victoria.
The general progress and development of the Province was influenced, more than
is remembered nowadays, by the copper mines. In a lesser degree only Burra, Wallaroo,
and Moonta were to South Australia what Ballarat and Bendigo were to Victoria. They
attracted population, they helped the general producers, and added greatly to the wealth
of the country. Kapunda was no longer a rich-producing copper-field, but the County of
Light, in which it is situated, had become the chief grain producer in South Australia.
Moonta
The mines on the Burra Creek still yielded gfood returns, but even they were soon to be

overshadowed by the greater importance of developments on Yorke Peninsula. Eor years
a large tract of country there had been utilised by Mr. W. W. Hughes —afterwards Sir W.
W. Hughes- as a sheep-run. As early as 1847 minerals were known to exist in the locality.
In December, 1859, a shepherd named James Boor, employed by Mr. Hughes, picked up
specimens of mineral which, upon analysis, were found to be rich in copper. Two months
later four Cornish miners repaired to the locality, and with the proverbial ability of their
countrymen, soon proved that the prospects of the field were excellent. Mineral leases
were secured, and a company was formed. At first the mine was not equal to expectation,
but after a year or two of courageous working the output was substantial and lucrative.

Mr. J. F. Conigrave, in his “South Australia,” gives the following figures: —“The ore raised
between March, iB6O, and December, 1884, amounted to 428,333 tons gross weight, of a
net value of .£1,970,533, and represented a production of copper of 41,025 tons of an
estimated net value in the Colony of ,£2,873,121. The mine gave employment, when in
full work, to a very large staff, there being at one time as many as 1,003 nien and boys
engaged in the workings.”
Ihe Wallaroo Mines were completely eclipsed by discoveries made a few miles
away. In May, 1861, Patrick Ryan, another shepherd employed by Mr. Hughes, found the
celebrated Moonta Mines. Rival claims made to the deposits were enquired into by a Select
Committee of the House of Assembly, and became the subject of litigation. The Moonta
Mines were profitable from the outset, and within a few years there were 20,000 people
resident on the Peninsula. As at Kapunda and Burra, these discoveries led to the early
settlement of the neighboring country by agriculturists. The Moonta Mines yielded between
1861 and Pebruary, 1885, refined copper approximately valued in the Province at £5,879,226.
Centres ot population sprang up, and the Government established shipping facilities at Moonta
and Wallaroo. Some hundreds of claims to mineral properties were made in 1861-2.
1 hese two last copper discoveries, like Kapunda and Burra, produced a substantial
increase in South Australian population, and for a time mining became a mania. In March,
1866, there were 163,452 persons in the Province; and in January, 1868, 176,298. The
export of minerals in 1861 amounted to £452,172 ; in 1866 to £824,501 ; in 1867 to
753*4 1 3 ! and in 1868 to £624,022. Ihe total exports of the produce of the Province in
1861 was £1,838,639; in 1866, £2,539,723 ; in 1867, £^2,776,095 ; and in 1868, £2,603,826.
I he imports in 1861 amounted to £1,366,529; in 1866, £2,835,142; in 1867, £2,506,394:
and in 1868, £2,238,510, presenting a healthy balance on the right side. The revenue was
affected by this expansion. In 1862, including land sales, it was £548,709; in 1865,
£1,089,129; and in 1868, £716,004. Thus will be seen to what importance the work of
the producers had come.
Because of the development of the resources of the country districts, improved means
ol communication were inaugurated. Hundreds of miles of excellent roads were formed, and
railway and telegraphic lines were projected and established. In August, 1857, the railway
to Gawler was opened; and in August, iB6O, the line was extended to Kapunda. Tramways
wctc laid down at Victor Harbor and on the Peninsula. Telegraphic communication was
effected with Gumeracha, Burra, Normanville, Moonta, Tanunda, Watervale, Angaston, Port
Augusta, Wentworth, Lacepede Bay, and other places.
Although the immediate effects of responsible government were most salutary, yet
there was occasionally evident in the earlier proceedings a want of moderation. This was
no more than could be expected, and, in general, South Australians proved themselves to
be of high average political capacity. There were extremists, of course. The democratic
party wanted to go too far all at once, and the “ conservative ” party was unnecessarily

nervous. The general danger seemed to lodge in the belief that responsible Ministers
could accomplish anything and everything. Previously the Governor was expected to be
the personification of such economic wisdom ; but with autonomy his powers were curtailed
and rendered chiefly negative, so that public acts could no longer be spoken of as the acts
of the Governor.
The first Parliament, which met in April, 1857, was exceedingly busy. Members
were something more than garrulous in debate. Their estates and experience represented
practically every settled part and class of the Province. The Government programme was
sufficiently important to demand the most serious attention. It proposed the construction
of public works, an Education Bill, and a Waste Lands Bill. In the first session a deadlock

For several years parliamentary government was distinguished by frequent changes
of Ministry. There seemed at first to be some difficulty in choosing a body of Ministers
J '
who held the confidence of a substantial majority of the House. Ihe P inniss Government
was principally composed of members of the old Executive. On August 20, Mr. B. 1 .
Finniss, after being defeated on two or three occasions, gave way to Mr. John Baker,
whose Government continued in existence for but 11 days. Mr. R. R. 1 orrens then
became Premier, but 29 days later he was succeeded by Mr. R. D. Hanson, a clever
lawyer, wdio retained the political confidence of the country for nearly three years. Mr.
R. D. Hanson, who was born in St. Botolph’s Lane, London, in 1805, had helped to
popularise in England Mr. E. G. Wakefield’s principles as applied to the proposed
colonisation of South Australia, After this he was a reporter and vv 1 iter for the London

pi ess, and then Assistant Commissioner to enquire into Canadian Crown lands and
immigration matters under Lord Durham. From Canada he proceeded to New Zealand,
and in 1846 removed to South Australia. He secured a large professional practice in
Adelaide, and in 1851 was elected to the first representative Council. Before taking his
seat, he was appointed Advocate-General in Sir Henrv Young's Executive, a position he
J O 7 L
held until the inauguration of responsible government. He was described by Loyau as a
profound thinker, a theologian, and a writer of no mean order ” ; also as “ one of the
brightest ornaments in his day and generation.”
J o
It is not necessary to closely follow the chronicles of the various South Australian
Parliaments, nor the changes of administration, except so far as they seem to affect material
and social development. Many matters that appeared highly important at the time had
little or no influence on the structural elements of South Australian progress or of
constitutional government. Ihe first Parliament was dissolved on March 1, iB6O, after
levying a poll tax on Chinese and deciding against federation ; and the second Parliament
met on April 27 following. Ihe Political Association, in pushing the cause of the working
classes, worked vigorously during the elections ; but the actual position of parties (if such a
teim may be used) underwent but little change. Mr. Anthony Forster in 1866 wrote that
vc might as well look for ink spots on the moon as for well-defined parties. It w T as the
want of party organisation that produced Ministerial instability. Mr. R. D. Hanson resigned
office as Premier soon after the new Parliament met, and Mr. T. Reynolds formed a Cabinet.
In 1861 the former was elevated to the Supreme Court Bench as Chief Justice of the
Province; in 1869 he was knighted; and in March, 1875, he died, in his 71st year. Mr.
Reynolds biought forward an extremely advanced programme, in which retrenchment was
the principal feature. Although his Government was popular, it was comparatively short-lived.
Hiking office on May 9, jB6O, he resigned on October 8, 186r, when Mr. G. M. Waterhouse
became I remier. Nine days later the latter was compelled to reconstruct, and in its new
form the Ministry conducted affairs until July 4, 1863. In 1869 Mr. Waterhouse took up his
lesidence in New’ Zealand, and in 1872 became Premier of that colonv.
j
The term of office of Sir Richard MacDonnell terminated on March 4. 1862. From
the inauguration of Parliamentary Government he had exhibited considerable tact, and had
become as great a favorite as Sir Henry Young. His name will always remain identified
wdth one of the most interesting and important periods in South Australian history.
\ aledictory addresses were presented to him by both Houses of Parliament and by various
classes of the inhabitants, while a memorial was drawn up praying Her Majesty to extend
llls U:rm ot service - In ll,s address to Parliament he instituted an encouraging
comparison between the condition of the Province in June, 1855, and in December, 1861.
Prom South Australia he went as Governor to Nova Scotia, and in 1865 to Hongkong. He
retired on a pension in 1872. and died in 1881.
Ihe new Governor was Sir Dominick Daly, who arrived at Port Adelaide on
March 4, 1862. Governor Daly was an Irishman, and a Roman Catholic; but he never


intruded his religious views into political matters. Sir J. W. Kaye, the biographer of Lord
Metcalfe, says: —“All Metcalfe’s informants represented him (Sir Dominick Daly) to be a
man of high honor and integrity, of polished manners and courteous address—a good specimen
of an Irish gentleman.” It was added that “he was possessed of judgment and prudence,
tact and discretion; in short, a man to be trusted.” Sir Dominick was born at Ardfry,
Galway, Ireland, in 1798, and in 1822 became Private Secretary to Sir Francis Burton,
Governor of Lower Canada. In 1827 he was appointed Provincial Secretary of Lower
Canada; and in 1840, upon the union of Upper and Lower Canada, was promoted to the
Secretaryship of the United Provinces, fie held this position until 1848, and during the
next four years managed some important commissions for the Imperial Government. He
was appointed Governor of Tobago, Windward Islands, in 1852, and Governor of Prince
Edward Island in 1854. He occupied the latter office for six years, was knighted in 1856,
and for two years prior to coming to South Australia resided in England.
During; the administration of Sir Richard MacDonnell the volunteer system had
O J
been established in the Province, and, on the occasion of war alarms, remarkable activity
was evinced in organising the forces. Much interest was taken in the subject in the early
part of Sir Dominick Daly’s term, and for the same reason defence matters secured
neneral attention, and the efficiency of the volunteers seemed to inspire confidence.
Ministerial crises were numerous in these years, and no-confidence motions were debated
with almost objectionable frequency. The instability of parties is demonstrated in the
statement that in the first 12 years of responsible government there were 15 absolute
changes of Ministry, besides several Cabinet re-constructions. The Premiers who held
office during Sir Dominick Daly’s administration were: —Mr. Waterhouse (October 8, 1861,
to July 4, 1863); Mr. F. S. Dutton (July 4, 1863. to July 15, 1863); Mr. IT Ayers
afterwards Sir H. Ayers- (July 15, 1863, to August 4, 1864): Mr. Arthur Blyth afterwards
Sir Arthur Blyth (August 4, 1864, to March 22, 1865) ; Mr. F. S. Dutton (March 22,
1865, to September 20, 1865); Mr. H. Ayers (September 20, 1865, to October 23, 1865);
Mr. John Hart (October 23, 1865, to March 27, 1866); Mr. J. P. Boucaut now
Sir J. P. Boucaut (March 28, 1866, to May 2, 1867): and Mr. H. Ayers (May 3, 1867.
to September 24, 1868).
The third Parliament, which met on February 27, 1863, and was dissolved on
January 25, 1865, was particularly harassing. In 1864, legislation was so interrupted that
at a public demonstration the resolution was carried “ that, in the opinion of this meeting,
the scramble for office by members of the House of Assembly, regardless of public policy
or political consistency, has delayed the business of the country and is calculated to bring
into contempt our present system of government." The House was soon afterwards
dissolved, and the fourth Parliament met on March 31, 1865, and existed until March 26.
1868. Its business, which at first was interrupted by rapid changes of Government, was
afterwards conducted in a quieter spirit than that of its predecessors ; and towards its close
there was a lull in political strife. According to Mr. Harcus, this ministerial rivalry was
J 1

not productive of personal animus. “ The bitter rancour of political life which is seen in
some countries is comparatively unknown in South Australia. It is not that our public
men do not feel strongly on political questions, but we are so closely mixed up in social
and business life that we cannot afford to allow political asperities to pass beyond the
region of politics. In iB6O, Mr. J. H. Fisher, who was President of the Legislative
Council from 1857 to 1865, was knighted. He was succeeded by Mr. John Morphett, the
respected pioneer, who resigned in 1873. Mr. G. S. Kingston was Speaker of the House
of Assembly from 1857 to iB6O, when Mr. C. C. Hawker was elected to that high office.
In 1865 Mr. Kingston was again elected Speaker, a position which he held until his death
in 1880. In 1869, Messrs. Morphett and Kingston were knighted.

Robert Richard Torrens
Ihe unstable phases of the first Parliaments were but things of the hour in
comparison with the magnificent repute which one of the earliest measures attained. This
was the famous Real Property Act, since known in almost every civilised country. The
origmator was Mr. R. R. Torrens, whose name is familiarised by being used in most
refeiences to the measure in question. He was born in Cork, Ireland, in 1814, and obtained
the M.A. degree at I rinity College, Dublin. In 1841 he was appointed Collector of Customs
under the South Australian Government, and during his connection with the Executive
drafted his celebrated Pill. In 1863 he returned to England, was knighted, and for some
time represented Cambridge in the House of Commons.


When the Real Property Bill was introduced into the House of Assembly it was
received with decided marks of approval, despite the important changes which it proposed.
It passed its third reading in the Lower House on December 15, 1857, with a majority of
12 votes, and In the Legislative Council with a majority of five. Determined opposition
certainly was shown, but principally by members of the legal profession. The system was
“an assimilation,” says Stow, “of the mode of transferring real property to that of transferring
ships,” a branch which Torrens had become thoroughly conversant with when Collector of
Customs. Stow continues :—“ The fundamental principle of the Act is conveyance by
registration and certificate instead of deeds. All the retrospect is destroyed. In bringing
private lands under the Act, the title is carefully inquired into ; but when the authorities of
the Lands Titles Office are satisfied about that, a clean certificate is given, and the
cumbrous deeds disappear. The title is indefeasible, except in cases of fraud, or adverse
and rightful possession when the certificate, or a transfer based thereupon, was given. In
the former case the title is secure in the hands of an innocent person who has purchased
from the holder under a certificate fraudulently obtained. The party wronged, under such
circumstances, recovers from the Assurance Fund, constituted by a percentage of a half-penny
per pound, levied on all property brought under the Act With regard to
defeasibility through someone being in adverse and rightful possession, ordinary precaution
would prevent anyone from becoming an unfortunate transferee under such circumstances.
In the case of misdescription of boundaries they are corrected, but otherwise the title is
indefeasible. The fees for transfers and mortgages are very small. A certificate of title
costs £ 1 ; registering a memorandum of mortgage, 10s. ; other fees in proportion, the
expenses being greater by a pound or two in rescuing land from the old system and
bringing it under the new. The assistance of a lawyer is not necessary ; the transferor and
transferee can act for themselves, or employ a broker licensed to conduct such business.”
The system has been such a success that the “Torrens Act" has been adopted
in the other Australian colonies, and elsewhere. Mr. Torrens came to be “ hailed as a
general benefactor.” He visited the neighboring colonies in iB6O, and met with “a series of
ovations,” and on his return was appointed Registrar-General, so that he might administer
the Act he had framed. The members of the legal profession for some time continued their
personal opposition to the Act, and 14 practitioners drew up a petition to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies praying that the opinion of the law officers of the Crown should be
obtained concerning its legality and validity. Public meetings followed. “It was not,” writes
Hodder, “in human nature that lawyers, who had made small fortunes by their tedious
• provided always ’ and ‘ and whereas,’ could sit still and contemplate these time-honored
forms, which had been considered indispensable to a good title, being ruthlessly swept away ;
still less could they gaze upon vanishing six-and-eightpences and thirteen-and-fourpences
with equanimity.” But the Real Property Act stood its ground, although a few amendments
in it have since been made.
An unfortunate and painful quarrel between Parliament and a member of the


judiciary excited profound attention. Mr. justice Boothby, in a case arising out of the Real
ropei t) Act. decided that under the new Constitution Act there was no Court of Appeal.
He also expressed his doubts as to the validity of certain Acts passed by the local Legislature,
because of their repugnance to the laws of England, and absolutely decided in the Supreme
against the validity of the Leal Property and other Acts that had not then received
)al assent. 1 hese rulings rendered him generally “ obnoxious,” and a heated controversy
ar ° Se ’ " hich was frequently conducted not in the best taste. A Select Committee was
appointed by Parliament to examine into and report on Judge Boothby’s decisions, but His
Honor refused to appear before it. The powers of the judiciary were discussed with much
public meeting's, in the I less, and in Parliament; and finally a petition was sent
to the Queen, praying for the “amoval” of Mr. Boothby from the Bench. In reply, instead
ol the Judge being reprimanded, the colonial Legislature was censured by the Imperial
Government. Ihe contentions continued for several years, and in ,866 i second address
was lorwarded to Her Majesty. The Secretary of State for the Colonies replied that parte
statements were insufficient to secure the removal of a Judge. He further pointed out
that either the local Government must deal with the case itself, or it must agree to have
ne question argued before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Several charges
were presented to Parliament against Hr. Boothby, who simply protested, but took no steps
to I (Liu iimself. Ihe local Parliament took upon itself the “grave responsibility” of
removing him from office, and the Judge at once declared his intention to appeal to the
Judical Committee of the Privy Council. Before he could take the necessarv steps he died
on June 21 , ,868. principally from vexation and anxiety caused by these protracted and
painful proceedings.
Next to the Real Property Act, and the troubles which arose out of it, the questions
tMI <xuU( tle most important controversy were immigration and “squatters” The
discussion on the former did not really end with the depression. In ,86c. what was known
as . ut le, land s Act was carried, and provided that “ one-third of the proceeds arising from
tie sale ot waste lands should be appropriated to immigration, another third to the construction
ol roads, bridges, and such-like work, and the remainder to public purposes ; or. in other
words, to secure the expenditure of moneys arising from the sale of waste lands for those
pu,poses fo. which they were originally set apart.” In Governor Dalys opinion, Sutherland’s
Ac recognised the sound principle that increase of population is necessary alike to occupying
fresh country and to imparting additional value thereto.” M 8
%
The squatter difficulty was not of a few years' duration ; it continued to be a
pregnant source ol contention throughout a lengthened period. The term “squatter” had
come to be applied to occupiers of Crown lands engaged in pastoral pursuits. Hitherto
these colonists had paid a trilling rent, and some of them had amassed a large amount of
capital , but both public and Parliament apparently believed that the State should receive
additional revenue from this source. Mr. Goyder, the Surveyor-General, was instructed to
value the runs, or estimate the rent that should be paid for them. His valuations were so


high that the squatters raised a great outcry, and denounced them as exorbitant and unjust.
A Commission was appointed, and the valuations were confirmed. The dispute was very
warm ; but, a drought intervening, caused severe losses to the squatters, and discounted
the arguments of their opponents. A compromise was arranged, under which longer tenure
was granted, while an increased revenue was obtained.
Several intercolonial conferences were held to discuss such subjects as federation,
transportation, immigration, uniform tariffs, border Customs duties, the postal question,
coast lights, an intercolonial Court of Appeal, and uniform weights and measures. The
difficulty then, as now, was to obtain the consent of the several Parliaments to the agreements
arrived at by the conferences.
The residents of the city, from the merchant to the laborer, had, ot course, a
large share of the good things which arose from responsible government and the increase
of agricultural, pastoral, mineral, and general activity. The population was dependent on
the city merchant, whose trade expanded, and who had to employ more hands and build
larger premises. Adelaide was the central depot, as well of the necessaries ot life as of the
governing institutions, the railways, and telegraphs. Perhaps, to the disadvantage of the
Province, it was, and has continued to be, the only pretentious city, and the possessor of
an undue percentage of the population. It has, therefore, a more than usual direct interest
in country development, and in the absence of large manufacturing industries, is immediately
affected by a diminution in the wheat or wool yield. It is here that the pulse ol the
Province must be felt.
Mr. Sinnett gives an interesting description of Adelaide as it was in 1861. Hindley
Street was no longer the chief centre of trade ; the current had flowed eastwards, and the
corner of Rundle and King William Streets was now the heart of the business portion. From
this point for a short distance along Rundle Street, Hindley .Street, King William Street,
North Terrace, Currie Street, and Grenfell Street, the rows of houses, shops, and warehouses
were continuous, and the land was of high value. 1 owards the south of the town there
were also several important business houses, but the streets south ol Franklin Street and
Flinders Street contained many vacant acres. Of 700 acres in South Adelaide 479 were
built upon. North Adelaide, with its pretty slopes, had become the favorite place ol
residence of the wealthier people. Ihe principal streets there were metalled and drained,
and contained a few shops to supply the immediate wants ot the neighborhood. Cars and
omnibuses passed to and from North Adelaide night and day.
Rundle Street and Hindley Street were mainly used by the retailers, and King
William Street was devoted to quieter pursuits. In the latter were the Itxchange, the Bank
of Australasia, the National Bank, the Imperial Insurance Office, the Savings Bank, the
South Australian Insurance Office, mining companies’ offices, architects’ and lawyers offices,
and, adjoining Victoria Square, Government Offices, the Post-Office, and the 1 olice Court.
In Grenfell Street and Gurrie Street were most of the warehouses and counting-houses, but


some of the principal merchants w r ere content to inhabit curious structures in the by-streets
tributary to [Bundle Street and Bindley Street. In Wakefield Street were the places of
worship, the Roman Catholic Cathedral,
the Scotch Church, and the Unitarian
Church, standing close together ; while
not far off was a large Wesleyan
Church. Most of the principal denomi-
nations had places of worship in North
and South Adelaide. On North Terrace
were the medical men, and south of
Victoria Square were the breweries and
mills. Along South Terrace were
some handsome private residences. At
this time there were 33 miles of made
streets in Adelaide with macadamised

roadways, kerbed footpaths, and watertables. Ihe streets were lighted by oil lamps.
Since 1855 such buildings had been erected as a new Hospital, Parliament House,
Government House, Government Offices, Mounted Police Barracks, and an Institute with
a free library. There were numbers of residences and mills at Hindmarsh, Thebarton,
and Port Adelaide. A few houses were scattered over Kent Town and Hackney, while
Kensington and Norwood were rapidly becoming important. The population of Adelaide
in 1868 was about 25,000, while the immediate neighborhood added several thousands
more. Vast improvements had been made at Port Adelaide, and at Glenelg a new jetty
was built and the main streets were metalled. In both of these were several shops, hotels,
and a few places of worship. It
was proposed in 1858 to build
a tramline to Glenelg. A small
community had formed at
J
Brighton, a small village beyond
the latter town.
The affairs of the City
J
Council were not in an agreeable
condition for the first few years
after the inauguration of
responsible government.
Council men quarrelled among
themselves, and such criticisms
were passed upon them that it
got to be considered by certain
of them that it was discreditable
to hold a seat in the Chamber.

It is said that slights were put upon the Council by Parliament, and that heartburnings were
the consequence. The Mayor elected for the year 1858-9 was Mr. T. W. Sabben, but in
January, 1859, he vacated office, and was succeeded by Mr. E. W. Wright. In December,
[BSB, the Corporation was in debt to the amount of £6,873 1 is. pd., the depression in the
country districts having affected the city. The credit of the Corporation was not good,
and the Bank refused to make an advance. 1 lie unpopularity of the Council had created
a feeling ot distrust. City improvements were suspended, and the expenditure was reduced
by nearly ,£9,000.
In 1859 Colonel George Palmer, Messrs. Jacob Montefiore, Raikes Currie, M.P.,
and Alexander Lang Pdder presented to the Corporation a large silver bowl and a piece
of the wedding cake of the Princess Royal. The inscription on the bowl contained the
words : “ Presented to the Mayor and Corporation of Adelaide, that they may drink thereout
in colonial wine to the memory of Lieut.-Colonel Light, the first Surveyor-General of South
Australia, by some of the original founders of the Colony ....” It was decided by
resolution “ that the practice ol drinking to the memory of Lieut.-Colonel Light be continued
from year to year in the first meeting of the Corporation, or after the anniversary of the
Colony.”
At the end of 1859 the debt of the Corporation was reduced to about ,£3,200 ;
but while the assessment in that year was ,£193.636, in iB6O it fell to £ 165,824. In May,
1859, a new city seal was adopted. Mr. G. B. W. Glandfield was Mayor in 1859-60-1.
The defective nature of the Municipal Act of 1849 was remedied in 1861 by the passing
of a Municipal Corporations Act. L nder it the means for creating new municipalities were
simplified ; the office of Alderman was abolished ; the election of Mayor was vested in the
citizens at large, instead of being left to the Council ; and the number of Councillors was
reduced to eight, two being returned for each ward. The ensuing elections excited more
than usual interest; Mr. Glandfield was elected Mayor, and Messrs. O. Rankin, S. Carvosso,
H. L. Vosz, H. Brice, T. English, J. Colton, W. Bundey, and S. Goode, Councillors. Mr.
Worsnop records that this alteration in the Council was greatly needed. Neither economy
nor judgment had previously regulated civic expenditure, the Council had exceeded its
resources, and scenes of disorder at its meetings had brought Councilmen very low in public
estimation. I he Mayor urged the importance of improving the river banks and other parts
of the city. In the balance-sheet of 1861 was a statement of the revenue and expenditure
of the Corporation since its establishment in 1852. The revenue was £"188,234 7s. id., of
which the principal items were £"66,596 3s. 46. from city rates, and £766,134 19s. 46. from
Government grants. The expenditure on roads and streets was £113,902 us., and on
Corporation buildings £44,081 2s. ud. ; the amount absorbed in salaries was £17,998 9s. 3d.
It was hoped that, by reducing the size of the Council, discursive discussion would
give way tc solid business. This result was attained, and the proceedings were thenceforth
conducted with more cordiality and facility. Excellent work was done during the next ten
years. Councilmen were determined to have a town hall that would reflect credit on the


capital. Under the Act of 1861 the Council had power to borrow ,£20,000, and to assign
the rates as security. A new Act was, however, necessary to enable them to raise the
money, and this was accordingly passed by Parliament. Competitive designs for a building
were called for, but, before anything was done, the municipal elections of 1862 were held,
when Mr. T. English was returned as Mayor. Within a few days it was decided to begin
building, and the design of Mr. E. W. Wright was accepted. Some opposition was shown
to the work, but it was persisted in. The foundation-stone was laid on May 4, 1863, by
Governor Daly; the cost was set down at ,£16,000. On June 20, 1866, the; building was
formally opened by the Governor,, in the presence of 800 persons ; and at the time it was
the largest municipal building south of the Equator. It formed a welcome adornment to
King William Street. The Town Hall had a frontage of 73 feet, and the tower stood
145 feet above the pavement. The enrichments were in the Corinthian order. Immediately
above the cornice of the main building were sculptured the city arms, and above apertures
originally intended for clock faces was the belfry, provided with a peal of bells. The
Town Hall proper was a magnificent chamber 108 feet long, 68 feet wide, and 44 feet
high. The inaugural banquet held in the evening was attended by the most influential
men of the Province, including the Governor, the President of the Legislative Council
(Mr. (. Morphett), the Speaker of the House of Assembly (Mr. G. S. Kingston), and
the Ministry. The building was erected at a cost of ,£20,000, and in 1877 it was provided
with an or nan.
O
The question of water supply obtained a good deal of attention. Under the
Waterworks Act of 1856 the management of the scheme tor supplying Adelaide with
water was entrusted to a Commission, of which the Mayor was a member. An amending
Act was passed in 1859, abolishing the Commissioners and placing the undertaking under
the control of the Commissioner of Public Works. The city was thus deprived of all
representation. Disagreements between the Council and the Government were frequent,
but the city was early supplied with sufficient water. Public baths and public drinking-places
were opened in 1861. In later years, Councilmen and public meetings agitated to have
the Waterworks transferred to the Corporation. It was a question of money. The
Government showed no disposition to meet tin; views of citizens, and the claim of the
Council was finally decided against in 1870. North Adelaide and the suburbs were
connected with the mains. When the efficiency of the supply satisfied the authorities,
the Corporation sought to obtain money to be expended in draining the city. A Bill
was drawn up in 1867, and introduced into Parliament, seeking to authorise the Corporation
to borrow ,£BO,OOO ; but the financial scheme it set forth was not sound, and the Bill was
not carried. Important discussions took place on the scheme of drainage to be followed.
In 1865, essays were submitted to the Council dealing with the subject, and that of Mr.
R. G. Thomas obtained the first prize. The Bill adopted the plan of Mr. Thomas, which
was that the sewage matter should be conveyed by a deep-drainage system to vacant land
a few miles distant and utilised to fertilise the soil.
In 1867 the lighting of Adelaide streets with gas was established by the South
167
The Producers ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


Australian Gas Company. The Register newspaper had adopted the illuminant years before;
and, even as early as 1851, A. E. Elder & Co. proposed to the City Commissioners, and
in 1852 to the City Council, to erect gasworks.
Year by year the parks and public places were beautified by the planting of trees
and shrubs ; and from time to time proposals were made for the construction of a dam
across the Torrens, so as to relieve the ugly bareness of its wide channel. A writer in
a neighboring colony facetiously declared that “in summer you might dam back the Torrens
with an Irishman’s hat.” The appearance of the stream was considered a stigma on the
citizens, but, beyond planting a few trees, nothing was done until 1866. In that year
Parliament made a grant of £"1,000, which was to be expended in beautifying the 1 orrens.

Before concluding this chapter, one other subject must be referred to. This was
essentially a period of exploration. The interior was penetrated and crossed, and new
lands were opened to public energy. During 1848-57 exploration was practically at a
standstill: Mr. Oakden and Mr. E. V. Bagot in 1851 made a few discoveries in the
neighborhood of Lake Torrens, but that was all. For some time the utmost curiosity
was demonstrated as to the nature of the regions surrounding the lake, and several trips
thitherwards were made. Babbage, in 1856, found MacDonnell Creek and Blanchewater

Lake ; and Goyder, in 1857, while making a trigonometrical survey of the neighborhood,
discovered Lake Freeling. In the latter year, Babbage was leader of a party designed
to explore Lake Torrens, but no important results occurred other than the discovery of
the remains of a previous traveller, W. Coulthard. Augustus Gregory made a long journey
from Brisbane to the Barcoo, which he followed down to Cooper’s Creek, whence he came
to Adelaide. In 1857-8, Mr. Stephen Hack and other explorers went into the north.
During the second trip of Babbage, objection was taken in Adelaide to the route he pursued,
and Major Warburton was sent to recall him. That gallant explorer found a passage over
Lake Torrens. Later on, with Mr. Samuel Davenport, he examined country between
Streaky Bay and Mount Gairdner, and also in the Gawler Range district.
John McDouall Stuart was the hero of the period. He accompanied the veteran
Sturt on a previous occasion into the interior, and showed so much fitness for exploration
that, in 1859, he was entrusted with the command of an expedition. His conduct during
the next three years marked him as one of the greatest of South Australian explorers.
He possessed the dogged determination and ability necessary for the accomplishment of
big designs. In April, May, and June, 1859, he travelled through the Pernatty country,
and succeeded in reaching: the then northern boundary of the Province. He returned in
O J
July, and reported the discovery of an interesting area of pastoral and auriferous country,
and so pleased the Royal Geographical Society that it presented him with a gold watch.
Parliament now offered the sum of ,£2,000 to anyone who would cross the
continent and reach the north coast. Stuart was expected to accomplish the immense
task. Mr. A. Tolmer essayed the journey, and soon gave up the attempt. In iB6O
Stuart made his first trip, with the assistance of Messrs. Chambers and Finke, for whom
he had previously gone out. and went far beyond the limits of previous expeditions, to
about 1.300 miles from Adelaide, and about 300 from the Gulf of Carpentaria. The
centre of the continent was reached on April 22, and upon a high mound, at once named
Central Mount Stuart, he built a cairn of stones and hoisted the British flag. Here he
was afflicted by scurvy, but, despite its ravages, he sought to reach the mouth of the
Victoria River. He was obliged to relinquish the attempt three separate times through
the want of water. Agnin starting: from Central Mount Stuart, for 111 hours he and his
O O
men were “ without a drop of water under a burning hot sun,” with heavy sandy soil
to travel on. Again he was forced back. Then he tried to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria.
He had already been attacked by natives, but on this fresh attempt he was met by a
formidable band. Dangers and difficulties beset him. Says Stuart :—“ I took into
consideration the position in which I was then placed : my horses tired and weary, three
of them unable to be longer than one night without water ; the men complaining six
weeks before this of being so weak from want of sufficient food that they were unable to
perform their duty. Their movements were more those of men of 100 years old than of
young men of 25 ; and myself being so unwell that 1 was unable to sit in the saddle the
whole day without suffering the most excruciating pain ; our provisions scarcely sufficient
170

to carry us back ; and now, being in the midst of hostile natives who were wily, bold,
and daring—so much so that I could see at once that my party would be unable to cope
with them, although we gained the advantage at first.” Therefore Stuart was reluctantly
compelled to return to Adelaide after nearly accomplishing the overland journey and
discovering numerous important features, among them the historical Chambers Pillar.
Parliament voted him ,£2,500 to fit out another expedition, and in November, iB6O,
he was again in the field. Slowly he drew nearer to the north coast, but he was not yet
to accomplish his purpose. He even reached the latitude of the head of the Gulf of
Carpentaria ; but huge plains (which he named Sturt Plains), skirted by dense scrub and
forest, arrested farther progress, “although gallant attempts were made in all directions.” A
fine sheet of water was found in the neighborhood, and named Newcastle Waters after the
Secretary of State. The farther he went, the denser became the scrub and forest, until
he and his men were almost without clothing and boots, and possessed only four weeks’
supply of provisions to accomplish the return journey of ten weeks. Stuart reached the
capital in safety.
Steps were taken by the Government to enable Stuart to make a further effort.
He left Adelaide in October, 1861, accompanied by W. Kekwick, F. W. \ bring, W. P.
Auld, S. King, J. Billiatt, J. F. Frew, H. Nash, J. McGorgery, and J. W. Waterhouse.
The party arrived at Newcastle Waters without serious difficulty, and there the fresh
exploration began. Stuart made several ineffectual attempts to penetrate the forest and
scrub in the locality, but eventually, by way of a succession of ponds, he pushed on to
permanent water, which he named Daly Waters, where was some good country. Thence
he discovered the Strangways and Roper Rivers. The country on the latter was the finest,
in Stuart’s estimation, he had ever seen—excellent soil and rich and abundant grass,
with cabbage-trees, cane, and bamboo lining the river banks. Here was a change from
the desolation of the interior; and on the Adelaide River, nearer the coast, the party
lingered for a few days amid “ lovely scenery and luxuriant vegetation, with birds of
splendid plumage, and with abounding creeks and watercourses.” Ihe great task was
practically finished. On July 24, 1862, they emerged from a thick, heavy bush, and beheld
the waters of the Indian Ocean in Van Diemen Gulf. Three hearty cheers were given,
and, wrote Stuart, “ I dipped my feet and washed my face and hands in the sea, as 1
promised the late Governor, Sir Richard Mac Donnell, I would do it I reached it.
On the following day Stuart had an open space cleared, and upon the highest
branch of one of the tallest trees fixed the Union Jack. Beneath the tree he buried a
paper, enclosed in an air-tight case, announcing his arrival and prosperity. Then followed
the return journey, which was accomplished with difficulty. Natives set fire to the grass ;
the horses were in a weak condition ; and Stuart became seriously ill. He suffered from
scurvy; his eyesight failed him ; he almost lost the power of speech ; and he despaired
of recoverv. He reached Adelaide, where fries and banquets were given in his honor,
J


and where the popular enthusiasm was almost without parallel in the Province. Thus
was rendered possible the overland telegraph line, and thus one of the greatest problems
of past years was settled. Stuart was awarded ,£2,000 for his explorations, and was granted
the lease of a large area of land in the north, rent free. In 1864 he took up his residence
in England ; but his health had been shattered by his many vicissitudes, and he died in
June, 1869 —on the day of the demise of Captain Sturt.
In August, iB6O, the Victorian Government dispatched an expedition under Robert
() Hara Burke and \\ . J. Wills to explore to the north coast. These gentlemen proceeded
through the neighboring colonies, and reached the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1861. They
were thus the first to cross the continent ; but on their return journey their lives were
sacrificed to mismanagement at Cooper Creek. John McKinlay was sent in 1862 to
render assistance to Burke and Wills, and proceeded to the Gulf of Carpentaria. In 1864
and in 1866 Major Warburton conducted parties towards the north-west, in the interior.
By the discoveries of Stuart the question of the settlement of the Northern
Territory, or Alexandria Land, was raised. Ihe area consisted of 231,620 square miles,
or 35,116,806 acres. Sir Richard MacDonnell, when Stuart had nearly reached the north
coast, suggested to the Imperial Government that the Northern Territory should be annexed
to South Australia. Ihe Luke of Newcastle replied that, as an overland route had not
actually been opened, the question was premature. Sir Charles Nicholson (first President
of the Legislative Council of Queensland), Chairman of the Colonial Land and Emigration
Commission, who was in England when the result of Stuart’s exploration became known,
recommended the Secretary of State for the Colonies either to establish a new colony or
to attach the territory to Queensland. The country was offered to the latter colony ; but
South Australia protested, and in September, 1863, Governor Daly received a despatch
from the Duke of Newcastle “placing that portion of the Northern Territory bounded by
the 129 th and 138 th meridians of east longitude, and beyond the 26th parallel of south
latitude to the Arafura Sea, under the charge of South Australia.” South Australians
congratulated each other upon the concession, but a few shrewd gentlemen, and notably
Mr. George Fife Angas, predicted losses and failures.
In April, 1864, a party of about 40 persons under Mr. B. T. Finniss, the ex-Premier,
was dispatched in the sailing vessel Henry Ellis , to establish a colony on the north coast.
Mr. Finniss was appointed Government Resident, and was instructed to proceed to Adam
Bay, which was recommended as the site for the capital. He was, however, free to select
any other spot which he might consider more desirable. Upon his arrival at Adam Bay
he remained there, notwithstanding the protests of the representatives of land-order holders
and the opinion of nearly all the officers. Disagreements arose ; scarcely any progress was
made; and in 1865 Mr. hinniss was recalled, and Mr. McKinlay was sent to explore the
country, while Mr. J. T. Manton was appointed to take charge of the settlement. Mr.
McKinlay, with much difficulty, examined several localities. Upon the return of Mr. Finniss,


jA H
>wv
a Commission was appointed to enquire into the whole affairs of the administration at Adam
Hay, and condemned the site and also Mr. Einniss’s management. Captain Cadell was
dispatched to report on a site for the capital. After his report was received, Mr. Goyder
was sent to choose a site. In the meantime, the Northern Territory was deserted by
Europeans, and purchasers of land clamored for the return of their money. Affairs
remained in this condition at the unexpected termination of Governor Daly’s administration.

ESI LESS as were the first four Parliaments, they were
/ mW quiet and tranquil in comparison with the fifth, sixth, and
seventh. In one sense, during this period, the situation
M was grimly humorous ; while Ministries appeared and
disappeared with the rapidity of scenes in a cinematograph,
Mthe Province made unprecedented progress. Generally the
instability of parties is a menace to effective and peaceful
Parliamentary government, but, singularly enough, in South
Australia it occasionally seemed to make little difference.
1 here were several able men, possessed of gifts necessary
to a leader, with schemes lor bettering the country, which
o J ’
they would promulgate only from the Treasury benches.
Each of them spoke of his scheme vaguely until the passage of the slides enabled
him to appear on the scene. A Government would come into power, introduce and
pass some useful measure, and then suffer defeat upon another Bill of no particular
importance. P'or a time there would be chaos in Parliament, but the new Act might
change the condition of the country. The battles were fought with the utmost ardor;
the warriors were brave and competent, even while they were reprehensibly ambitious for
office. When such men as Baker, Reynolds, Waterhouse, Dutton, Ayers, Blyth, Hart,


Boucaut, and Strangways —to mention only successive Premiers, and omitting the
lieutenants, who were frequently more capable than their leaders were pitted against
each other, there were sure to be stern conflicts.
To understand the position, it will be necessary to enter somewhat into detail.
Upon the death of Sir Dominick Daly, Lieutenant-Colonel F. G. Hamley, senior officer
in command ol the Imperial forces in the Province, was sworn in as Acting Governor
on February 20, 1868. Little is now known of this gentleman’s career, but he showed
excellent patience and judgment at a critical period. He entered the army as ensign in
the 12th Foot in 1835, and, after leaving South Australia, attained the rank of General.
He died in 1876. The political turmoil, in which there was a lull towards the termination
of Governor Daly’s administration, was renewed soon after his death. Ihe fourth Parliament
was dissolved in March, 1868, and the fifth met on July 31. The elections had been
conducted with spirit, land reform and protection or free trade being the questions -chiefly
discussed. It was upon the former item that most ol the schemes referred to were built.
The policy of the Ayers Ministry had principally to do with the Northern Territory,
and it was proposed to liberalise the conditions under which land had been allotted there.
Resolutions to this effect were carried, whereupon the question of land reform was grappled
with. The drought in the pastoral and agricultural districts had seriously affected the revenue
returns, and on September 3 the Budget speech divulged a deficiency of ,£500,000 in the
preceding three years’ finances. The incidence of this drought seemed to increase the desire
of legislators to reform the land system. Since the “squatters’” controversy was initiated
in 1864, public thought had dwelt upon the whole question of land alienation which it
opened up, and views upon it were diverse and sometimes excited. The Ayers Government
offered a solution, but the House refused to accept it, and on September 24 Mr. Ayers
resigned. After Mr. Alexander Hay and Mr. William Townsend had made separate and
vain attempts to form Cabinets, Mr. John Hart succeeded. He met Parliament, and, a
few days later, resigned. On October 13, Mr. Ayers again returned to power; but he
did not have the confidence of the majority, and, on the 23rd, handed in his resignation.
A dissolution was advised, but the Acting Governor sent for Mr. H. B. T. Strangways,
who formed a new Ministry, and was able to control the House for 18 months. The
preceding few weeks had been given up to confusion and what one critic called “ crisis-
mongering.” Land Bills had been introduced by the successive Ministries, who were unable
to carry them.
Mr. Strangways brought in a new measure, and this in a year or two produced
wide-reaching prosperity. The son of the late Henry Bull Strangways, J.P., of Shapwick,
Somerset, Colonel-Commandant of the Bolden Hill (Somerset) local militia, he was born
in 1832. He came to South Australia as a boy, but, returning to England, he entered
at Middle Temple in November, 1851, and was called to the Bar in June, 1856. He
almost immediately resumed his residence in South Australia, and was elected a member
of the House of Assembly in 1858. He declined to form a Government in iB6O, but


%
was Attorney-General, and then Commissioner of Crown Lands, in the succeeding Ministry
of Mr. T. Reynolds. He was Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration in the
Waterhouse, Dutton, and Ayers (1865) Administrations; was a progressive politician, a
clear thinker, and a man of fine judgment and discrimination. While a member of the
Reynolds Ministry he adjudicated on the vexed question as to the ownership of the Moonta
M ines, his decision being subsequently upheld by the court. He gave important
encouragement to exploration, helped to initiate the State railway system, and introduced
the measure providing for the construction of the overland telegraph line.
As Mr. St rangways had defeated the Ayers Ministry on its land proposals, he was
expected to disclose a better policy. Immediately on meeting Parliament he propounded
a scheme which completely reformed the system under which Crown lands were sold,
winning for himself from the Register the title of “ The St. George of the Land Reformers.”
For some years the energy of farmers had been confined by the high prices they had to
Port Adelaide in 1872
pay for new land. Sales by auction of large areas admitted of land-jobbery. In bidding-
in the auction-room the poor farmer had no chance against the capitalist or pastoralist.
From the foundation of the Province to 1868 the Government received an average of
O
£1 5.5. 6d. per acre for all lands sold. As the farmer was outbid in the auction-room, he
frequently had to pay capitalists and land-jobbers from £3 to an acre for this land.
The State “ profited nothing ”; the “ farmers and the country suffered greatly.” Land
suitable for agriculture was employed to feed a few sheep, because the farmer could not
afford to pay the high price demanded.
The Strangways Bill attacked this dragon-like monopoly, and was designed to
throw new areas open to the agriculturist at a fair price and on credit. The debate in
the House of Assembly was vigorous. On January 9, 1869, the Bill was sent to the
Council, where 28 amendments were made, two of which imperilled the vital principle of
the measure. At a conference appointed by both Houses a deadlock was averted, and on
177

January 29 the Land Bill was finally disposed of. On the following day Parliament was
prorogued, and soon afterwards the twelve-months’ interregnum of Lieutenant-Colonel
Hamley came to an end.
I nder this new Act, as previously, land was sold by auction, but it provided
tor the proclamation of agricultural areas, the lands of which were open for selection.
W here more than one application was lodged, possession was decided by lot. No selector
was permitted to purchase more than 640 acres, and the price was not to be lower than
£>' 1 P er acre. In case land was not selected within two years, it was sold by auction.
Ihe selector was required to deposit 20 per cent., which was considered as four years’
interest paid in advance. Certain improvements were to be made, and conditions of
occupation were demanded.
I hus, instead of paying £4 or ,£5 for his land, the farmer could obtain it at a
little over ,£l, and on moderate terms of credit. From the time that the new Act came
into lorce in 1869 to December, 1882, the average [>rice paid the Government for lands
was £1 6s. iod., hence securing is. 4d. more per acre to the Government than previously.
Later, in 1869, an Amending Act extended the term of credit and reduced the amount
ot interest to be paid in advance. Ihe interest was further reduced in 1870-1 ; then, in
1872, the Strangways Act was repealed, although the principle of sale on credit and by
selection was retained.
While the Strangways Act led to dummyism and to the acquisition of large
estates through the medium of sham purchasers, it introduced an era of expansion and
prosperity, which was reflected as much in the city as in the country. Large areas were
taken up by farmers, and soon their mingled output added enormously to local wealth.
Country previously occupied as a sheepwalk was broken by the plough, and the change
was followed by a series of rich harvests. Unfortunately, the latter so encouraged farmers
that they went to more remote territory, and selected land unfit for agricultural purposes,
the unhappy results of which have been abundantly demonstrated in recent droughts.
L nder the reform inaugurated by Strangways Act the rich northern agricultural areas
were taken up by farmers ; new towns and ports sprang into existence, and the population
was largely increased.
South Australia thenceforth became more than ever a grain-producing country.
Ihe area cultivated in 1868-9 was 808,234 acres, of which 533,035 acres were under
wheat, producing 5,173,970 bushels; the land cultivated in 1876-7 represented 1,828,115
acres, or more than double the area of eight years previously. The export of breadstuff's
in 1875 amounted to ,£1,680,996. Jhe pastoralist did not seriously suffer. From 70,829
horses, 123,820 cattle, and 3,038,356 sheep in the Province in 1866, the number by 1876
had increased to 106,903 horses, 219,441 cattle, and 6,133,291 sheep, the number of sheep
being doubled. The export of wool in 1875 amounted to ,£1,833,519. The staple exports
had Increased to £4,427,727 in value (copper yielding substantial returns), and the revenue
to £'1,311,925. The population, from 163,452 in 1866, rose to 237,481 in 1877.


A month after the prorogation of Parliament in January, 1869, when Mr. Strangways’
Land Bill was disposed of, the new Governor, Sir James Fergusson, Bart., arrived. Ihe
career of Sir James had been a brilliant one. He was born in Edinburgh in 1832, and
was educated at Rugby and Oxford. Choosing a military career, he became a lieutenant,
and then a captain, in the Grenadier Guards. He saw active service in the Crimea,
taking part in the battles of Alma and Inkerman, and received the Crimean medal with
three clasps, also a Furbish medal. During the progress of the war, Colonel Hunter
Blair, M.P. for Ayrshire, was killed at Inkerman, and Sir James’s friends in the constituency
elected him to the vacancy in his absence. This was a singular tribute of regard, and
■ n 1 855 he returned to England, sold out his commission, and took his seat at St.
Stephens as a Conservative. In the decisive struggle between the Conservatives and
Liberals at the general election of 1857 Sir James lost his seat at Ayrshire, that constituency
reverting to a Liberal. Two years later, however, he was again returned, and sat until
1868. In 1866-7 he was Under-Secretary for India in the third Derby Government,
and in 1867-8 Under-Secretary for the Home Department in the first Disraeli Ministry.
In 1868 he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of South Australia. Sir
James married, in 1859, Lady Edith Christian Ramsay, daughter of the late Marquis of
I )alhousie.
On February 15, 1869, Sir James and Lady Fergusson reached the Province,
and on the same day H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh arrived on his second visit. The
new Governor was sworn in on the following day in the presence of the royal visitor.
Parliament met in July, 1869, and, for a wonder, the Address in Reply was carried
in both Houses without a division. But whatever hopes the Strangways Government
may have entertained that the session would be peaceful were soon dispelled. The deficit
in the finances continued, and, to remove it, the Government proposed retrenchment and
increased taxation. This was the opportunity tor those who aspired to be Ministers of
the Crown. F'or three or four years industry had been depressed, and the proposal to
impose additional taxation was therefore not likely to meet with popular favor. The
Government brought a hornet’s nest about its ears, and “ ministerial crises and threatenings
of crises came thick and fast.” The Government was strong, but the Opposition was so
obstructive that public business was long delayed. The Ministry undertook to retrench
as far as possible, and to increase taxation only when absolutely necessary. The Estimates
were introduced, and reductions were proposed in most of the departments. The Opposition
contested the items almost line by line, and sometimes the Government was in a minority.
Remarks Hodder ; —“This inordinate waste of time came at length to be regarded as a
burlesque on responsible government.”
Meetings were held throughout the country, but nothing practical was done in the
whole session. On January 4, 1870, the House met after a short adjournment, and a
vote of censure was immediately tabled and lost. On the 25th another attempt was made
to eject the Government, and Mr. Strangways asked for a dissolution. The Opposition

and the Legislative Council objected, but Sir James Fergusson decided to take the advice
of his Ministers. “ Squabbling and place-hunting ” had occupied the time of two sessions.
On February 25, Parliament was prorogued, and the Government went into recess without
an Appropriation Hill or even a Supply Bill.
Parliament was dissolved on March 2, and on May 27 the sixth Parliament
assembled. There was a goodly number of new members, “but,” writes Hodder, “it was
thought by many that the wire-pullers had been guilty of a practical joke, so incongruous
were the selections.” The diversity of views and “ platforms ” was astonishing. It is
said that, on the day before Parliament met, 24 or 25 members arranged to eject the
Ministry without waiting to hear what its programme was. An emphatic vote against the
Strangways Government was recorded, and on May 30 it was succeeded by a Ministry
under the leadership of Mr. Hart. Mr. Strangways left the Province in P'ebruary, 1871,
and has since resided in England.
The Hart Government introduced a Land Bill, the provisions of which were
fought inch by inch. I here were many amendments, and about 150 divisions. P inally
the measure was thrown out on the casting vote of the Speaker. Then the Strangways
Act was amended, and 19 Bills were introduced and sacrificed. Retrenchment was again
debated to little purpose, but several alterations were made in the tariff. The finances
were so seriously embarrassed that a loan of £IOO,OOO was sanctioned to meet current
expenses. The session terminated on January 13, 1871, being as unsatisfactory as its
predecessor.
The inevitable Land Bill was introduced at the re-opening of Parliament on July
28. Again tedious discussion took place, and maundered through weeks and months.
When the committee stage was passed in the Assembly, Mr. J. P. Boucaut submitted the
usual want-of-confidence motion. Mr. Hart tendered his resignation, and Mr. Boucaut
was invited to form a Ministry. He declined the responsibility; after which Mr. H. Ayers,
and then Mr. A. Blyth, were communicated with. The latter took office on November
10, and, finding that the forces in the House were so evenly balanced, recommended a
dissolution. Again the Legislative Council and a section of the Assembly opposed the
suggestion. Parliament was dissolved on November 23, having been in existence for only
18 months. Among the measures sacrificed was an important Education Bill. At the
end of the financial year in 1871 there was a deficiency of about ,£75,000. The
ex-Premier, Mr. John Hart, did not again take office. In January, 1873, he dropped
dead when about to address a mercantile gathering.
The seventh Parliament was summoned on January 19, 1872 ; and such strictures
were passed upon the recent dissolution that, on the 22nd, the Blyth Government resigned
J O ■
after being a little over two months in office. Mr. Ayers now came into power, but the
change did not please everybody. A want-of-confidence motion was discussed, and on
March 4 a re-construction took place. On the following day both Houses adjourned,


only to re-assemble a month later. The respite had a good effect; members were in a
more agreeable mood. Ihe deficiency in the year’s accounts was estimated at ,£94,000,
and the Government introduced a Bill to empower it to issue ,£IOO,OOO worth of Treasury
bills. Although the Government remained in office throughout the session, which closed
on November 30. little practical legislation was effected. Twenty-five Bills were rejected
or were not proceeded with. The session closed in storm. A scene took place on a
question of privilege, in which the Governor and the Speaker were concerned. The
doors were locked, but one or two members broke them in. The Governor, who had
come to prorogue the House, was kept waiting during these proceedings.
This was the last session in the administration of Governor Fergusson. Matters
important to the welfare of the Province had been determined, and a national undertaking-
the construction of the overland telegraph line (referred to on a subsequent page)- had
been completed. Though the financial situation was strained, enterprise, so far from being
at a standstill, was uncommonly active ; settlement was spreading over new lands; new
institutions were founded, and building operations in the city were particularly brisk ; and
these, notwithstanding the impotency and ceaseless squabbling of Parliament.
On December 6, Sir James Fergusson left South Australia, and shortly afterwards
became Governor of New Zealand. In 1871, Lady P'ergusson died in Adelaide, and her
obsequies were attended with unusual demonstrations of grief. Two years later, Sir James
married a South Australian lady, the daughter of the late Mr. John Henry Richman, of
Wambauga. His subsequent career has been important. Retiring from the colonial service,
he became, in 1886, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and, in 1891, Postmaster-
General.
Sir Richard Hanson, the Chief (ustice, was Acting Governor of South Australia
until the arrival on June 8, 1874, of Mr. Anthony Musgrave —afterwards Sir Anthony
Musgrave —whose colonial career had already been long and useful. I his gentleman, the
son of Dr. Anthony Musgrave, of Antigua, became private secretary to the Governor-in-
Chief of the Leeward Islands in 1850, although in the following year he entered as student
at the Inner Temple. In 1852 he was Treasury Accountant at Antigua, and Colonial
Secretary in 1854. He was promoted in iB6O as Administrator of the colony of Nevis,
whence he was transferred to St. Vincent in 1861. 1 hen, in 1864, he became Governor
of Newfoundland; in 1869, Governor ol British Columbia; and in 1872, Lieutenant-
Governor of Natal.
On June 9, 1873, Mr. Musgrave was sworn in as Governor of South Australia.
The year was a progressive one : an abundant output of grain, principally due to the new
country opened up in the Northern Areas, had produced general prosperity. On July
25 the second session of the seventh Parliament was opened. The Ayers Ministry was
succeeded by a Government formed by the previous Premier, Mr. Blyth ; and for about
two years this gentleman continued at the head of affairs. \he land reform question had
practically been settled. Debate in the 1873 session centred chiefly on the administration


of the Northern Territory, and several proposals were discussed, and some were accepted.
After this the immigration about which there had been so much wrangling in
previous years, was resuscitated. The developments in agriculture, in building operations,
and in almost every branch of industrial activity, called for more labor ; artisans were
J J 7
required in the city, and farm hands in the country. The demand was so pronounced
that the public debated not so much upon whether there should be increased immigration
as upon the advantages of free and of assisted immigration. The old annual vote for
immigration continued, but for 1874 the Government proposed that ,£35,000 should be
spent. Public sentiment was expressed at public meetings. In 1873, Parliament voted
,£15,000 for assisted and ,£5,000 for free immigration; and in 1874, ,£30,000 and ,£5,000
respectively.
Among other measures passed in 1873 was a Constitution Act Amendment Bill,
which provided for the appointment of a sixth Minister —a Minister of Education and
established the principle that the Attorney-General should not necessarily be a member of
Parliament. In the Upper House, Sir Henry Ayers (knighted in 1872) proposed that
Ministers should serve without salaries. The Bill equalised the salaries of the six Ministers
at ,£I,OOO. A new Electoral Act was also passed in 1873, and increased the number of
members of the House of Assembly from 36 to 46, and authorised a re-arrangement of
the districts.
In 1871 a fruitless discussion took place on an Education Bill, and in the session
of [874 a new measure was introduced by the Blyth Government. It proposed to
substitute for the Board of Education an Educational Department, which should be under
the charge of a responsible Minister ; but the Bill was defeated in the Legislative Council.
As the Parliament had run its full course, a dissolution took place, and the new House
met on May 6, 1875, 46 members assembling for the first time. The Blyth Government
gave way, on June 3, to a Ministry formed by Mr. Boucaut, who succeeded in carrying
a progressive Education Bill. This provided for a responsible Minister of Education and
a Council of Education, with a salaried president, a secretary, and a staff of inspectors.
Compulsory education was to obtain in districts proclaimed by the Governor, and education
was to be free to all unable to pay fees. A proposal to provide for Bible-reading was
defeated. Provision was made for secondary schools, and about 100,000 acres were reserved
as a land endowment for educational purposes.
The Boucaut Administration will long be remembered for its courage and its
progressive measures. Mr. James Penn Boucaut now Sir James Penn Boucaut—who
was born in 1839, was a son of the late Captain Ray Boucaut, and came to South
Australia with his father in 1846. He studied for the law, was admitted to practice, and
in 1861 entered Parliament as representative for the city of Adelaide. In subsequent
years he evinced a vital interest in politics, was a vigorous and fearless debater, and was
a prominent figure amid the storms which assailed the successive Parliaments. He first
took office as Attorney-General in the Hart Government of 1865. Upon the retirement


ol the leader in 1866 he re-constiucted the Government as Premier, and he was a member
of the Ayers Ministry of 1872.
Ihe programme of Mr. Boucaut, enunciated in 1875, was so bold that it startled
the whole community. I aking account of the recent developments in the country, and
of the possibilities of the future, he propounded a public works policy, the like of which
the Province had never known before. Po this day it is known as “The Boucaut Policy.”
I here was a good deal of the statesman in Mr. Boucaut, and his views had a national
aspect. He proposed to raise a loan of three millions sterling, to be expended in reproductive
and national works, such as building 550 miles of railway to tap the north country, connect
with the Murray, form the nucleus of an overland line communicating with the eastern
colonies, and to serve the producers in the South-East. In addition, he proposed to improve
the harbors, to build jetties, schoolhouses, and other useful structures. P'or several years
suggestions had been made by different Governments to construct a railway to the Murray,
and to extend the system in other directions ; but beyond a railway to Burra, and shorter
lines in other parts, nothing had been done.
The mere idea of raising three millions of money seemed so tremendous that
for a time the community drew back. Mr. Boucaut was not foolish enough to saddle the
Province with debt without making ample and direct provision for the payment of interest,
and introduced a Stamp Duties Bill for this purpose. This passed the House of Assembly,
but on the same day that his public works programme was propounded in the Lower House,
the Legislative Council negatived the Stamp Duties Bill. Parliament was prorogued, so
that the public might have an opportunity of expressing an opinion. Judging by the
tone of public meetings and memorials, its views were unmistakably in favor of Mr.
Boucaut’s scheme, which seemed more feasible and attractive and useful the longer it was
considered. Parliament assembled again on November 10, and two days later the
introduced four Bills into the Assembly—the Stamp Duties Bill, and Bills* providing for
railway and other public works construction. The Assembly quickly passed the first measure,
which was once more submitted to the mercy of the Upper Chamber. Its fate was as
before :it was thrown out by a majority of one. Says Hodder : —“ Much popular indignation
was expressed at eight men being thus able to defy the wish of the Colony, and proposals
were heard that the term of service of members of the Upper House should be shortened.”
The remaining Bills were abandoned, and Parliament was prorogued. In the
recess, the Cabinet was weakened by the secession of Messrs. Morgan and Colton, and
the elevation of the Attorney-General, Mr. S. J. Way—now the Right Hon. Sir
Samuel Way, Bart, -to the Supreme Court Bench as Chief Justice in succession to Sir
R. D. Hanson, deceased. A coalition was formed, and in May, 1876, the House assembled.
In June a vote of want of confidence was recorded, and Mr. Boucaut was relieved of
office “partly, as his friends asserted, by backstairs cabals, and partly because he refused
to borrow large sums of money without making provision to pay the interest . . . .”

Mr. John Colton—now Sir John Colton—Mr. Boucaut’s ex-colleague, was the new
Premier. Much of his predecessor’s policy was borrowed, new railways weie authorised, and
loans aggregating nearly were voted, a useful session closing on November 17.
This practically concluded the political affairs in the administration of Governor Musgrave.
On January 27, 1877, he left South Australia to become Governor ol Jamaica. He had
been face to face with several difficult situations during the ministerial crises, and amid them
all deported himself with dignity and judgment. At a farewell Parliamentary dinner, he
characterised ministerial instability as “ a great blemish in Australian political systems.
From Jamaica Sir Anthony Musgrave, who was knighted in 1875, was transfened to
Queensland, where he died in October, 1888.
The most important feature of the period 1868-77 was the vigorous execution ot
a bold public works policy. The roads throughout the country districts were improved,
money was spent in harbor accommodation, telegraph extension was provided for, and new
railways were built. In earlier years the railway from Adelaide to Gawler had been
extended to the Burra, and a tramline was laid from Strathalbyn to Middleton, a station
on the Goolwa-Port Victor line. A tramline was also built from Port \\ akefield to
Hoyleton, and subsequently extended. Then railways were constructed between Port 1 irie
and Gladstone, Port Wakefield and Kadina, Kingston and Narracoorte, and Adelaide and
Glenelg; a short line was built from Port Broughton to the agricultural country in the
neighborhood. Some 302 miles of railway were open to traffic at the termination of Sir
Anthony Musgrave’s administration, and Parliament had sanctioned the construction of 380
miles in addition. The following; were Included in the measures introduced first by Mr.
Boucaut, and then by Mr. Colton : Port Augusta to Government Gums, 199 miles;
Gladstone to Jamestown, 20 miles; Rivoli Bay to Mount Gambler, 57 miles; Kadina to
Barunga Gap, 33 miles; Kapunda to North-West Bend of the Murray, 56 miles; and
Burra to Hallett, 18 miles. P'or some years railway building was the dominant phase of
local development. It may be said to have attracted thousands of men to the Province,
and in the large expenditure ot loan moneys which it necessitated to have given a
fictitious value to real estate and products. South Australians, judging from the
prominence given to the subject, were at this time a people of railway-builders.
A work, which partook of a national character, was the construction of an overland
telegraph line to Port Darwin. The attempts to settle a colony in the Northern Territory
were renewed. Captain Cadell, after visiting the north coast, supplied the Government
with a glowing account of its resources. Under land regulations specially applying to that
area, English and Australian capitalists had purchased the right to take up certain lands,
and the Government was therefore compelled either to establish a settlement or to return
the money to the purchasers. In 1869, Mr. Goyder was sent to make the necessary
surveys, and he used Port Darwin as a base of operations, choosing Palmerston, on its
shores, as the prospective capital. Mr. Goyder performed the task allotted to him with
characteristic energy and dispatch, and the survey of the chief town and three smaller

settlements, also of 500,000 acres of country land, was completed by 1870. In the
meantime, most of the English land-order holders had demanded the return of their
money. Ihe Government resisted, but in later years —in obedience to a judge and jury,
whose verdict was confirmed by the Full Court, and subsequently, on appeal, by the Privy
Council—they had to pay back about £"40,000 in principal and interest. In March, 1870,
Captain Bloomfield Douglas, R.N., was appointed Government Resident in the Northern
Territory ; and in May the purchasers who were willing to retain their land-orders took
a ballot for the choice of land. Government offices were opened at Palmerston, Port
Darwin, and a few score people went there to reside. In 1872, owing to rumors of gold
discoveries, several parties of men were sent to the Territory. Some of them secured
good returns, and immense sums of money were spent in quartz-reefing and machinery.

continent with an electric wire, so as to connect with Europe and Great Britain.
The reader of John McDouall Stuarts journals will appreciate the extreme difficulties of
the task of carrying the wire over the central barren and burning wilderness. To Mr.
H. B, T. Strangways and his Ministry, supported by the enthusiasm of Governor hergusson
and many members of Parliament, the Province owes the projection of this continent-bridging
and globe-connecting line. They introduced a Bill in 1870 providing for its construction,
the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company agreeing to put down a cable from
Singapore to Batavia, and from Banjoewangie to Port Darwin. The estimated cost from
Port Augusta to Port Darwin was £"8o per mile, or ,£120.000 for the entire distance.
The supervision of the construction was entrusted to Mr. Charles Todd—now

Sir Charles Todd —the Postmaster-General and Superintendent of I elegraphs, who, years
before, had brought the project officially before Sir Richard MacDonnell. Ihe work was
commenced from both Port Darwin and Port Augusta. Ihe two ends gradually approached
each other, and were ultimately connected near the centre of the continent. Many were
the vicissitudes and the obstacles to be overcome ; first, floods, and then the scarcity of water.
Numerous stories are told of the great privations endured by the men in crossing the
bush and desert, and the construction reflects honorably on the engineering skill of Mr.
Todd and his subordinates. Direct communication between Adelaide and Port Darwin
was established on August 22, 1872. The event was hailed with much enthusiasm, including
the ringing of bells and display of bunting. Mr. Todd at that time was near Central Mount
Stuart, and from the heart of the Australian continent exchanged welcome congratulatory

for exploring parties penetrating the deserts west and east. The exploration so
vigorously pursued in the previous period was brought to a sort of climax in these years.
In 1870, Mr. John Forrest now Sir John Forrest —at present the Premier of
Western Australia, but then a young man attached to that colony’s survey department,
conducted a party overland from Perth to Adelaide along the southern coast. He kept
principally to the route taken by Eyre in 1840. but though the itinerancy of the
expedition was pursued with ability, it brought little practical advantage to the colonies
concerned other than to open the way for the construction of a telegraph line between
the two capitals, which was completed in 1877.
With the expeditions over the continent by Stuart, the only great problem
remaining to be settled by explorers was the crossing of the tract of country separating
South Australia from the western seaboard. There was a good deal of healthy rivalry


between South and Western Australia as to which should first accomplish this last huge
task. Ihe honors were fairly evenly divided. South Australia was first on the track. In
August, 1872, Mr. Ernest Giles left Chambers Pillar with the intention of crossing the
deserts of the west to the source of the River Murchison. Innumerable sandhills and
long stretches of dreary unwatered scrub country forced him back after he had reached
the neighborhood ot the border. He made other attempts with like results ; a member
of his party was lost and not again heard of. Gosse, as with Giles, had terrible trials
while seeking to penetrate an arid tract over the border in Western Australia, and he, too,
was compelled to return to civilisation. P'orrest was anxious to set forth from the
Overland Telegraph Construction Party Camped at the Roper River
western side, but his Government desired him to wait until the results of the South
Australian expeditions should be learned.
Maj or Warburton, a grey old warrior, was the first to travel from the overland
telegraph line to the western coast. Born in Cheshire in 1813, he entered the Royal
Navy in 1826; and from 1831 to 1853 was in the East India Company’s service, retiring
with the rank of major. In the latter year he was appointed Commissioner of Police in
South Australia, and, in 1869, Colonel-Commandant of the South Australian Volunteer
Force. Between 1856 and 1874 he had charge of several exploring expeditions.


In April, 1873, Major Warburton, then 60 years of age, whose party was equipped by
the liberality of Sir Thomas Elder and Sir W. W. Hughes, started to cross from Central Mount
Stuart to Fremantle. Giles and Gosse went out with horses, but Warburton was supplied
with camels. From Alice Springs the explorer pursued a course near to the MacDonnell
Ranges, and then he struck to the north-west, missing the stretch which defeated Giles.
As soon as the border was crossed, the serious trials of his journey began. Perhaps
Warburton was not so expert a bushman as many Australian explorers, but certainly he
was as fearless as the bravest, and as stoical in bodily suffering. Ihe necessity to obtain
water drove him in the search upon a more northerly course than he intended to pursue.
Month after month passed as he wrestled with his task. Long excursions were made
west, and then back on his track to the east, north, and south, for water. Hot sand, blown
by- the wind, scorched his face ; by day the sun’s heat was almost unbearable, and at night
the cold was intense. It is said that, out of 49 attempts he made to find water by sinking,
only one was successful. The way' - led over innumerable ranges of sandhills; nowhere
was there a pleasant prospect. One or two of the camels broke loose, and were lost in
the desert. As the months passed, and the provisions diminished, the remaining animals
were killed for food. Fatigue and anxiety caused Warburton to despair, and he would
O J
have gladly died in the wilderness. So weak was he, that his companions strapped him
upon a camel, and thus a great part of the journey was accomplished. Ihe success of
the expedition was largely due to Charlie, an Australian native attached to the expedition,
who found water when the others gave up hope. All possible speed was made for the
Oakover, a river in the north-west of the sister colony-, and there the party arrived on
December 4, 1873, after “looking death close in the face” to use Warburton’s own words.
Help was procured at a station on the De Grey River, and by slow stages the journey
was continued among the settlements to Perth. Thus an old man was the first to successfully
storm the deserts of Western Australia. The South Australian Parliament voted \\ arburton

In 1874, Ernest Giles and John Ross discovered considerable areas of country-
near the border, but they failed to get overland to Perth. Warburton, with his camels,
had crossed the western colony" in its northern latitudes; and John Forrest, with horses,
now determined to take a more southerly and central course. In March, 1874,
accompanied by his brother Alexander, two other Europeans, and two natives,- he left
Geraldton, north of Perth, followed the Murchison watershed, and then resolutely turned
his face eastwards. In all his journeys P'orrest proved himself to be a master in
bushcraft, a “science” in which he was helped the cunning of the clever natives who
accompanied him. One of these, Tommy Windich, deserves to be ranked among the
great explorers of Australia. He accompanied John Forrest in all his long and arduous
journeys, and was also a companion of Alexander P'orrest and another explorer in then-
expeditions. The brothers affectionately laud his ingenuity and hardihood. Though he
had many vicissitudes to put up with during his overland trip, Forrest conducted his
party with such good judgment and generalship, that their sufferings did not compare

with those of Warburton, Stuart, or Sturt, horrest, a son of the soil, knew his country,
and it treated him with more generosity than it did most others. \\ hen he had pushed
hundreds of miles into the deserts, so far that he could not retreat, his situation became
grave. All his bush knowledge, and that of his companions, could not find sufficient
water on the onward route. Before him was the western fringe of the desert that dro\ e
back Giles and Gosse. Behind the horses had drank up nearly all the water in the
springs and natural reservoirs. To retreat was as dangerous as to push on. \\ rote
Forrest in his journal :—“ The thought of having to return brought every feeling of
energy and determination to my rescue, and I felt that, with Gods help, I would even
now succeed.’ The men were reduced to short rations, and every preparation was made
“ for a last desperate struggle.” Then came a timely fall of rain, and the forbidding
stretch was traversed. “I need not add,” remarked horrest in his journal, how pleased
all were at having at last bridged over that awful, desolate spinifex desert. On September
27, 1874, as it rounded a clump of trees, the party sighted the overland telegraph line,
at which there were cheers and exclamations of gratitude. Ihe subsequent journey to
Adelaide w r as soon completed, and in the city the discreet and able explorer was given a
royal welcome. With his horses Forrest had accomplished what Giles and Gosse could
not do, and made his journey in much shorter time, and with greater ease than W arburton
with his camels.
Ernest Giles, than whom no explorer was more enthusiastic, went out again after
the brilliant achievements of Forrest. In August, 1875, he left Ouldabinna with camels
for the west, his object being to cover new country much to the south of horrest s track.
Giles went west by south, and entered what appeared a limitless ocean-desert. He determined
to cross it at all hazards, and so he pushed straight on, hardly diverging a mile from his
course. The farther he went, the more certain did an early death seem. “ Not a soul
thought of retreating,” said Giles afterwards, and yet the horizon afforded no glimpse to
encourage. “The desert,” said one writer, “was majestic in its melancholy and desolation.
Here was an illusive salt lagoon ; here a waste of spinifex ; and here a dwarfed and halt-dead
scrub. There was no sign of life anywhere. At last the camels had gone 325 miles
without water, and were showing serious signs of exhaustion ; it was unlikely that they
could hold out much longer. Tommy, a native, walked ahead of the band, watching
for those natural evidences which indicate the presence of water. He caught sight ot an
emu, and followed it to the top of a ridge ; on the other side he observed a tract
ornamented with pine trees. Still following the emu, he descended the hill, and in the
hollow found a spring of pure water. The relief from anxiety, and the joy ot Giles and
his companions, can be imagined. The oasis saved them, and Giles named it \ ictoria
Spring, after the Queen. A course was then made north of the present goldfields ot
Broad Arrow and Siberia, and Perth was reached without difficulty. Giles was not yet
satisfied, and he crossed the huge deserts to South Australia on another route- north of
Forrest’s. No serious difficulties assailed him on this occasion, but no extensive country
of commercial value was discovered by Warburton, Forrest, or Giles on these journeys.


The city again demands attention. As previously, with the country’s progress there
was corresponding development in the metropolitan area. At no stage during her history,
except perhaps that in the early part of Governor Gawler’s administration, did Adelaide
so completely improve the standard of her buildings. The activity of the limbs brought
the heart into more healthy action.
The period started with depression. Droughts and poor returns to the farmers
were prejudiciall]gfeffecting the whole community ; but when the northern agricultural areas
were opened up, all this was changed. The effect in Adelaide was evident in the foundation
of new institutions as much as in commercial prosperity and building development. The
city revenue expanded, and the City Council itself was enlarged. New public comforts
were extended to citizens, and the full expenditure of money went towards making the
reserves and surroundings as beautiful as those of any city in the Southern Hemisphere.
In effecting these improvements, the authorities took full advantage of the opportunities
afforded by Colonel Light’s original survey. From ,£185,494 in 1868, the annual assessment
gradually increased until, in 1877, it reached the total of ,£263,632. From a revenue of
£'35,57° in 1868, the figures mounted to £48,335 in 1877 ; and from a population in the
city proper of 23,229 in 1866, the number rose to 31,573 in 1876, with upwards of double
the number in the whole metropolitan area.
In 1868 serious defalcations were discovered in the administration by a prominent
official of the Corporation funds, the amount involved between 1859 and 1867 being
£4,068 15s. 6d. ; and the culprit was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. In 1866
Mr. Thomas Worsnop was appointed Town Clerk, and Mr. H. R. Fuller was re-elected
Mayor. The successive Mayors to 1877-8 were : —J. M. Solomon, 1869-70-1 ; A. H. F.
Bartels, 1871-2-3; W. D. Allott, 1873-4; J. Colton, 1874-5; Caleb Peacock, 1875-6-7 ; and
Henry Scott, 1877-8. In 1873 a Municipal Corporations Amendment Act was passed,
and increased the number of wards to six, and the number of councilmen from eight to
twelve. Grey and Robe Wards were each divided, the extra wards being given the names
of Young and MacDonnell respectively. The 1873 Act added to the powers of the
Council, and gave greater facilities for appeals against assessments, extended the borrowing
powers of the Corporation, and increased its power to make by-laws.
From the beginning of its history the Council had some difficulty with its
markets. In 1854-5 the Corporation erected a building to serve as a market-place on the
Corporation Acre fronting Pirie Street, but the site was unpopular, and the place was
closed. In 1861, Mr. Vaughan provided accommodation for market gardeners from the
hills at the east end of the city, between Rundle Street and North Terrace. Ihe site was
convenient, and was soon generally used, Mr. Vaughan being its proprietor, dhe Corporation,
desiring a market of its own, in 1869 purchased land in the centre of the city, and laid it out
as a market-place under the name of the City Market. Vaughan’s market was the more
popular, and, notwithstanding attempts to have it closed by Parliamentary action, it maintained
its right to existence. The cattle, sheep, and other markets were much improved.

The improvement of the
Torrens, and the systematic
planting of the park and
reserves in ornamental trees,
was slowly gone on with. In
1869, by Act of Parliament, the
Corporation was empowered to
raise, by bonds, a sum not
exceeding ,£15,000, which was
to be expended in beautifying
the city. The dam, carried away
by the Hood of 1867, had given
so much pleasure, that it was
desired to construct another
and stronger one. The actual
construction of a dam or weir
was held in abeyance for some
years, but small improvements
were effected. In 1875, some
The City Bridge, King William Road, Looking West
4,000 trees were planted in the streets, and the bare places in the reserves were adorned
in the same way.
In 1873 Mr. Worsnop, the Town Clerk, prepared an elaborate scheme for the
improvement of Victoria Square and its environs. He proposed that the authority of
Parliament should be obtained for the purchase of four acres of land fronting the west
side of the Square, that a road 132 feet wide should be made through the centre, and
that the Parliament Houses and University Buildings should be erected on the eastern
side of the road. The City
Council regarded the project with
favor, the House of Assembly
passed an empowering Bill, but
the Legislative Council would
have none of it. Had the proposal
been carried out, the stately appear-
ance of King William Street would
have been greatly augmented.
For many years there had
been considerable disagreement
between the Corporation and
Parliament concerning the Mor-
phett Street railway crossing

drains. Various proposals for obtaining a scientific system of drainage were debated,

and erroneous and exaggerated ideas were held as to the probable cost of such a work.
The political crises protracted the passing of an Act providing for the raising of a sum of
money for this purpose, and little disposition was shown by Parliament to divert public
money from railway and other more national construction. A survey of the route for the
main trunk sewer in the drainage system was completed in 1876, and a Drainage Bill was
drafted, but, in the pressure of other measures, received slight attention from Parliament.
In the meantime, the provisions of the Health Act were enforced as far as possible, to
the advantage of the city residents. A disagreement arose in 1876 between the Central
Board of Health and the Corporation, acting as the Local Board of Health, in regard to
drainage matters, and the subject was taken before the Supreme Court. It referred to
alterations to be made in the sewers, which the Corporation did not wish to effect until
a proper system of drainage was established. This collision was serious enough, but it
did not move the hands of
the Government. Negotia-
tions were opened with
the latter, and a Bill to
authorise the Corporation
to borrow money for the
work was prepared, but
no political action was
taken. The general opinion
seemed to favor the
emptying of the sewage
into the sea.
The bare recapitu-
lation of the chronicles ot
the Corporation does not,
however, convey any just
idea of the importance the
Town Hall, Unley
city was attaining. In the world of higher education, philanthropy, and manufacture it was now
able to take a place. In higher education the people had principally depended on the St. Peter’s
and Prince Alfred Colleges, established under the auspices of the Anglican and the Methodist
Churches respectively, and on advanced schools conducted by the Roman Catholics and private
individuals. The need of a university was generally recognised in 1872, and, as a result
of meetings and representations to Parliament, such an institution was founded in [874.
Sir W. W. Hughes, in 1872, promised the sum of ,£20,000 for the endowment of two
chairs. In November, 1874, an Act to incorporate and endow the University of Adelaide was
passed. It provided for a Council and Senate, endowed the institution with 50,000 acres of
ground in fee-simple, and guaranteed an advance of 5 P er cen L on funds invested by the
Council. Sir Thomas Elder, to further the project, also gave ,£20,000; and Mr. J. H.

Annas founded an Engineering
Scholarship valued at £2OO per

Adelaide University was formally
opened in the presence of the
leading personages in the Pro-
vince. Sir R. D. Hanson was
the first Chancellor. A Bushman’s
Club, a Sailors’ Home, and a
Blind and Deaf and Dumb Asylum
were also founded during this
period.
The commercia 1 and
industrial progress caused a
Old Town Hall, Hindmarsh
marked change to take place in the buildings of the city, private as well as public.
Ihe Post Office, with its lofty tower, was completed and opened on May 6, 1872.
Police and Customs Offices were built, alterations and additions were made to the Law
Courts and to Government House, to prisons, and (chronicles Hodder) “churches, chapels,
institutes, and halls rose in all
parts of the country.” Un-
occupied acres in the city
“were filled up with hand-
some dwelling-houses, more
particularly in the eastern,
southern, and northern
portions.” The increase of
population forced the people
into the suburbs, and by this
time the country lying be-
tween the city and the hills
was more or less built on.
New suburbs appeared and
clamored for municipal
government. In 1871 Unley
was incorporated, and in 1874
Hindmarsh.

centres. Its first year’s rates amounted to £489, comparable with £7,542 in 1899.
The town of Hindmarsh is nearly as old as Adelaide, and its history is practically
contemporary with it. It has been a large manufacturing centre for several decades, and

HE remainder of this history may be told with less fulness
[v I of detail. The period of general formation was com-
. I pleted, public works construction, first made a dominant
rendered comparatively easy, and South Australia was the
---: :T_possessor of the chief concomitants of civilisation, and of a
self-reliant people comprehensively embarked in the
management of their own affairs.
O
The building of railways quickly told on the agricultural returns. Each year,
for several years, the area under cultivation and the number of farmers increased, and
J 7
South Australia reached in this period her highest point of prosperity. To some extent
the additional area brought under cultivation has not been an advantage, for much of the
increase was in the poorer country, where the rainfall is unreliable. bor one good year
there are several discouraging ones, and the average returns suffer. Ihe farmer took
177 M


land to which the shepherd had the best right. While tillage in the unsuitable region
increased, there was a slight decline in the older agricultural areas. By the year 1889
there was not an agricultural district of any pretension or reliability that was not served
o /i j
by a railway.
* J
The Boucaut policy, while it eventually drained from the Province large sums
of money to pay the interest on loans, and while it was not always followed in its original
integrity, resulted in a rapid increase of population and of trade, and in an enormous rise
in the value of property. Of course, there was a land boom, during which building
operations in Adelaide were conducted in a manner suggestive of 1840. The population
jumped from 237,090 in 1876, to about 300,000 in 1882; the area under cultivation from
1.514,916 acres to 2,623,195 acres; and the revenue from ,£1,331,925 (1876-7) to ,£2,242,085
(1881-2). In Adelaide, business sites rose 120 per cent, in value, and good residence
sites 100 per cent. New townships were laid out on the Adelaide Plains and on the
seaboard, and syndicates purchased land here and there, with the idea of cutting it up into
residence lots. Henley Beach and the Grange came into existence, and the tints of the
bubble were observed with all the old eagerness. By 1882-3 had come the re-action and
the vain regrets.
The public works policy was to a large extent the instigator of this boom, but
the increase of production and export had some influence. Up to 1880 the wheat yields
were large, and in that year the export of breadstufifs amounted to £'2,469,720. Poor
returns followed, and in 1882 there was a diminution in the export of nearly a million
pounds. In 1880, the total exports amounted to £"5,574-405, but in 1882, it was
£4,187,840. Thenceforth the returns varied with the seasons; there were bad years and
there were good. In 1889, the stock in the Province was represented by 6,386,617
sheep, 324,412 cattle, and 170,515 horses. Ihe export of produce of the Province
amounted to £3,694,692, of which wool supplied £1,541,972, breadstuff's, £957,585, and
copper, £295,288. The season was not a good one. The population in December, 1889,
was 324,484.
In the interval between these dates, there were happy and also bitter experiences.
Loan money and substantial returns for wheat and wool effected a great difference in the
condition of the people, but the general and legitimate prosperity was affected by occasional
droughts in the northern districts. After the severe drought of 1882, there was an
improvement in the harvest, but in the city the aftermath of the boom was being felt.
Ihe Insolvent Courts were busy, and the newspapers were constantly announcing-
assignments. The revenue returns decreased quarter by quarter, and the public defied
grew rapidly. The price of wool went down so low that it was almost impossible to
make pastoral pursuits pay. Then came a change. The discovery of silver in the
Barrier Ranges was a matter of supreme importance to South Australia because of its
geographical position, and a railway line was projected to the argentiferous area. Wool
rose unexpectedly in value, and the exploiting of a goldfield at Teetulpa gave a temporary


impulse. Ihe farmers in 1886 reaped a fair harvest where dearth was predicted, and in
that year little more was heard of bad times- the people as readily forgot what had been
bad as at other times they forgot what had been good.
Ihe year 1886 began with distress and ended in jubilation. Prospects improved;
but there was another reason : On December 28 the Province attained its fiftieth birthday.
On December 27 arrangements were made for bringing together as many of the pioneers
as possible. Ihe vast majority of the founders had disappeared, but a few remained.
Dodder remarks that men who had shaken hands with Governor Dindmarsh in 1837,
shook hands with Governor Robinson at this time. A crowded meeting of pioneers
and old colonists was held in the Adelaide Town Dali in the evening, and events in the
history of the Province were depicted in tableaux. Interesting relics were exhibited in the
banqueting-hall, such
as old newspapers,
books, sketches,
Colonel Light’s
sword, and Stuart’s
original diary. There
O j
were present several
venerable men who
were familiar with

struggles of the Province; men who “had built so strongly and well,” writes Mark Twain
OO O J
of them, “and laid the foundations of their commonwealth so deep, in liberty and tolerance;
and had lived to see the structure rise to such state and dignity, and hear themselves so
praised for their honorable work.”
On the following day, Glenelg was the centre of popular rejoicings. Thousands
of people congregated on the shore, or near the rugged old gumtree, or about two rusty,
time-worn guns on the Colley Reserve which had frowned from the deck of the old Buffalo.
Among the assemblage were some who had heard the proclamation read beneath the gumtree
50 years before. That half-century was very potent. Dodder, instituting a comparison
between the old and the new, said: —-“The colonists remembered with pride that in 1836

Adelaide was a finely-grassed and tree-covered plain, Glenelg all waste land, swamps, and
sandhills, whilst Port Adelaide bore the suggestive name of Port Misery. Ihe • pioneers
dwelt in structures of mud, reeds, or canvas, and food was scarce. Now, Adelaide, one
of the most beautiful cities in the world, was linked by 1,200 miles of railway with other
J 7 *
parts of the colony, and 3,000,000 acres of land produced annually hundreds of thousands
of tons of the best wheat in the world.
An excellent and appropriate opportunity was afforded the world in the
following year of observing the developments made by South Australia during her first
half a century of history. The year 1887 was a happy one; a favorable harvest, good

prices, and promising mineral developments, had put the people in a good temper. It had
been decided two or three years before to hold a Jubilee Exhibition, at which should be
shown the products and manufactures of the Province, side by side with the products and
manufactures of other countries. Mr. E. T. Smith, M.P. mow the Hon. Sir E. T.
Smith, M.E.C. —was an indefatigable worker in this object. A private exhibition had
been held in 1881, but it was intended that this should outshine it in representativeness
and publicity. Magnificent buildings were erected on North Terrace, and money was not
spared to make the scheme a success.
The Jubilee Exhibition was opened on June 21, 1887, and before it was closed

on June 7, 1888, over three-quarters of a million persons had visited it. Some acres
of ground were occupied, and the permanent building had a floor space of 85,600 feet,
attached to which were annexes. In these were displayed the handiwork of an ingenious
people, and the fruits of the soil, produced in a country which 51 years before was wholly
A • '-S J J
inhabited by blacks. A more stirring and impressive object lesson could not have been
supplied ; all this was the wealth of a peaceful people. The chief credit for the success
ot the Exhibition must be awarded to Mr. K. J . Smith and Sir Samuel Davenport.
In 1888-9 there was excitement in Adelaide owing to the phenomenal developments
on the Broken Hill (Barrier Ranges) silver fields. A huge silver boom took place; a vast
Southern portion of Broken Hill
number of people became shareholders in silver stocks, some of which were not worth the
paper they were printed on. The Stock Exchange became the centre of attraction in the
city, and numerous fortunes were made and lost in speculation. One useful result of the
prevailing mining excitement was the formation of a .School of Mines. The wheat and
wool returns were good in rBBB, and poor in 1889. In the north, in the risky country,
where the farmers had too hurriedly settled, there was distress in the latter year, and vain
attempts were made to induce the Government of the day to make advances of seed
wheat to the sufferers. Private funds were raised, relief was given, and fortunately the
succeeding harvest was abundant. The copper industry, by this time almost exclusively
centred on the Peninsula, was also greatly depressed in 1889, owing to a collapse in the


copper market; but what South Australia temporarily lost in this part of the Province,
it gained in the splendid returns from Broken Hill.
Adelaide was brought into great prominence by these exhibitions, and also by the
accession of population. Unfortunately, an undue proportion of the incieasc of people
settled in the metropolitan area, and the evils of centralisation were intensified. Ihe
exhibitions, the land boom in 1881-2, the silver boom in 1888-9, g enera l attractions
of the city, were all, to some extent, detrimental to the true interests of the I rovince in
that they drew too many people to reside in the capital.
The formative period of Adelaide may also be said to have ended in these \ears.
During the land boom the population of the metropolitan area increased rapidly, and
hundreds of new houses were erected. 1 here was such a plethora of residences, offices,
and business sites, that for some years after the re-action the number of vacant houses
was depressing, and men who anticipated a large rent-roll went insolvent. Complaint was
general. But the boom in city and suburban property served to enhance the aspect of
the city, notwithstanding empty dwellings.
Owing to the peculiar system adopted, the annual assessments are not representative
of the true value of city property. At the time of payment of rates the residents are quite
willing to agree that the assessments are good, but afterwards they loudly assert that they
are absurdly low. The assessment in 1878 was ,£289,030; in 1883, £485,065: in 1886,
£433,373; and in 1889, £390,374 15s. In a Land and Income Tax Bill proposed by
the Government in 1884 the estimated value of Adelaide was £14,000,000 out of £65,000,000
for all the land in the Province not in the hands of the Government. PTontages in King
William Street were valued at £325 a foot; in Bindley Street, at £125; in Grenfell,
Currie, and Waymouth Streets, at £100; in Gouger Street, at £SO; and in Gilles and
Gilbert Streets, at £ls. In 1889 the population of the city proper was estimated at
43,75°, with three times that number in the metropolitan district, and 315,281 in the
Province.
In keeping with the dignity of Adelaide, the citizens had almost from the foundation
of the Corporation been very discreet in their choice of Mayors, and particularly since
the election was entrusted to the ratepayers. The present period was no exception to the
rule. The successive Mayors were men whose careers were distinguished throughout the
Province. Of them Mr. PL T. Smith, M.P., was probably the most public spirited and
able. Both in natural talents and wealth he was singularly adapted to occupy the highest
position in an important municipality. Born at Walsall, Pin gland, in 1831, he came to
South Australia in 1853, and was soon the proprietor of a large brewing business. PI is
first experience of municipal government was obtained in the Kensington and Norwood
Corporation, of which he was Mayor in 1868-9-70-72-73. He was Mayor of Adelaide
in 1880-1-2-7-8, and was at the same time a member of the House ot Assembly tor


East Torrens; in 1884 he accepted the portfolio of Minister of Education in the Bray
Ministry. Enterprising as well as charitable, Mr. Smith was to the city in the eighties
what Sir J. H. Tisher had been earlier in its history. Many of the most charming pleasure
resorts about Adelaide are monuments to his energy. In 1888, he was knighted in
recognition of his services in connection with the Adelaide jubilee Exhibition. The other
Mayors of Adelaide were In 1878, Henry Scott, M.L.C. ; 1879, W. C. Buik, M.L.C. ;
USB3, H. R. Toiler, J.P. ; and 1884-5-6, W. Bundey, J.P.
Tor some years prior to 1880, it was considered compatible with the importance
ot the citizens that they should again have the privilege of electing Aldermen to the Council.
In 1861. these dignitaries were abolished, but under a Municipal Corporations Act, passed in
1880. it was made
possible for the rate-
payers to elect under
certain conditions a
Council, to consist of
a Mayor, Aldermen,
and Councillors. The
necessary conditions
were obeyed, and the
Governor was re-
quested to proclaim
that the number of
Aldermen should be
six. On December
1, 1881, an election
of Aldermen too k
place, when Messrs.
H. R. Fuller, M. H.
Madge, W. Bundey,
H. E. Astles, W. C.
Buik, and F. Hage-
dorn, were returned.
Insignia and Plate, Adelaide Corporation
On May 24. 1882, the Mayor was for the first time invested with a Mayoral
chain. It was composed of 26 links, representing the terms of office of previous Mayors.
At this time the insignia and plate of the Corporation consisted of a Mayor’s gold chain
lx J Q )
silver mace, silver bowl, silver ladle, and a three-handled loving-cup made of the same
metal. Improvements were effected in 1881-2 to the Town Hall, and especially to the
Council Chamber, at a cost of ,£6,000. In 1882, a Building Act was passed by
Parliament, and had special reference to the requirements of lighting, ventilation, and
general construction of dwelling-houses. An Amending Act was passed in the following
year on the initiative of the City Council.

As to improvements effected in the city, first and foremost was deep drainage,
hor years this question had been debated with thoroughness, and while some citizens
ad vocated that the sewage should be carried into the Gull, others were in favor of a
sewage farm. At ratepayers’ meetings, for upwards of 10 years, schemes had been discussed
with such detail that it seemed that deep drainage was to be immediately established.
Ihe election ol Councillors often turned on the question. In the preceding chapters
we saw that Parliament, or responsible Ministers, were principally to blame for the
delay, but now the hopes of citizens were to be realised. The City Council importuned
the Government so persistently that in 1878 the sum of ,£200,000 for dee]) drainage
was included in a Loan Bill. Purther amounts of £llO,OOO and ,£lOO,BOO were
subsequently obtained for the same purpose. By 1884 the work of laying the main
sewers was completed, and 6,500 connections were made up to October of that year.
Sewage Farm
By October of the following year the system in Adelaide was practically complete. In
subsequent years the suburbs have been gradually connected with the system.
. As k was feared that tide in the Gulf would not draw the output of the
sewers into the ocean, but would deposit it on the beach, the scheme eventually adopted
was to establish a sewage farm. The whole system was carried out on’ scientific
principles ; capacious main sewers were laid down, and the site of Adelaide, so carefully and
piesciently chosen by Colonel Light, offered no great engineering difficulties to the
completion of the design. These sewers run from the populated centres, and are connected
with the thoroughfares by a great number of street sewers. Beneath Adelaide is a series
of miniature cleansing rivers, which disembogue at the Sewage Farm at Islington about
four miles north of the city. There all the sewage is strained before being distributed.

Ihe farm, which is about 470 acres in extent, and whose soil varies from a stiff clay to
a sandy loam, is divided into paddocks. The broad irrigation principle is adopted, and
the filter-beds are thoroughly under-drained, the effluent being clear and pure. Ihe
production ot the land has been extraordinary. Cows, horses, sheep, and pigs are
depastured, while luxuriant crops have been obtained of lucern, Italian rye-grass, mangolds,
sorghum, wheat (for hay), barley, vines, and wattles. It has been justly claimed that
by means ot this system Adelaide is the cleanest and healthiest city in Australia, and the
* J
best drained in the Southern Hemisphere. Experts from various parts of the world
have reported upon it, and agree in their praise.
In the early part of the period considerable activity was shown in tramway
construction. The public works policy pursued for the Province generally was copied in
the metropolitan area, and tramways were laid into all the principal suburbs. Indeed, the
desire to build tramways became a fever, and lines were proposed which could never have
paid. But a system of horse trams was established, and ran north, south, east, and west.
Without entering into particulars concerning the general improvements of the
city, special reference must be made to the Torrens Lake. In 1881, a weir was completed
in the Torrens near the site of the old dam, and soon there was a magnificent stretch
of water thrown back from near 1 hebarton to the Botanic Park, making a beautiful lake


/ JmS* I '

wi th willows and other trees growing on its banks. The Governor opened the water to
public use on July 21. It was “one of the most attractive and brilliant spectacles ever
witnessed in Adelaide. Upwards of 40,000 people lined the banks of the Torrens as the
procession of boats passed from the weir to the landing stage near the Exhibition
Grounds, and back to the starting place.” In order to further beautify this locality, Mr.
E. I'. Smith, the Mayor, warmly advocated the formation of a Rotunda on the southern
bank by the City Bridge. This work was duly carried out, owing to the liberality of
the late Sir Thomas Elder, and was opened by the Mayor on November 28, 1882.
The growth of population caused new municipalities to be proclaimed in the
metropolitan districts, and in 1883 corporations were established at St. Peters, Thebarton,
Rotunda, King William Road
Presented to the Corporation of Adelaide by Sir Thomas Elder
and Semaphore. The area of the St. Peters Municipality is about 908 acres, divided into
four wards —Hackney, P.ast Adelaide, Stepney, and Maylands. The members of the first
Council were: —Mayor, Joseph Bertram; and Councillors T. Seabrook, M.D., Robt.
Knowles, PL W. O’Halloran, Thomas Wood, Joseph Jackman, W. R. Sanclo, Thomas
Garneau, and W. J. H. Farrant ; with Mr. W. H. Goss as Town Clerk. The assessment

and Torrens —and the assessment was

Mr. S. J. Way, the Chief Justice, acted as Governor between the departure of
Sir Anthony Musgrave and the arrival of Sir W. W. Cairns, K.C.M.G. The latter, who
had just vacated the Governorship of Queensland, was sworn in on March 24, 1877, but
his tenure of office was exceedingly short. After associating himself with the aspirations
of the people, and making himself popular by the interest he took in their institutions,
ill health compelled him to resign, and he left the Province on May 17, less than two
months after his arrival. Mr. Way again acted as administrator.
Sir W. F. I). jervois, G.C.M.G., was the next Governor, and on October 2 he
assumed office. His appointment was popular; rumors of war in the old world caused
Australians to have a very natural fear that they would be defenceless against an enemy.
J J O •
Meetings were held in several parts of South Australia, and hundreds of men applied for
enrolment in the local volunteer force. The Imperial Government commissioned Sir William
Jervois and Colonel Scratchley to report on Australian defences. The former, born in
Victor Harbor
182 r, had seen active service among the Boers and Kaffirs, and In 1857, became Secretary
to the Permanent Committee on the Defence ot the Empire. While investigating the
question of colonial defence, he received instructions to succeed Sir W. W /T . Cairns in South
Australia. All Australians were pleased that a military officer so competent should remain
in their midst for some time, and in Adelaide he was welcomed by a larger crowd than
had previously assembled to greet a new Governor.
While Sir William may have been useful to Australia in a military sense, in
J J
South Australia his duties were happily chiefly of an official and social character. He
was logical in argument and sound in judgment, and so closely identified himself with local
Interests that he became as one of the colonists. He invested money in station property,
and his interest in South Australia did not cease with his departure from it. When he
arrived, a constitutional struggle was in progress. The works for new Parliamentary
buildings had been begun without the Legislative Council being consulted as to the site,
although the project had been sanctioned by both Houses. Ihe Council took this as


** x ; *l.* • v • - * c '* ..* * v - v u /a ■%.
a breach of privilege, and demanded the deposition of the Chief Secretary, Sir Henry
Ayers, the leader of their Chamber. The Colton Government refused to sacrifice their
colleague, whereupon the Council declined to transact any business. Affairs were practically
at a standstill, and the Council addressed the new Governor on the subject. But before
Sir William had replied, the Assembly ended the dispute by censuring the Colton
Government, on the casting vote of the Speaker. Mr. Boucaut returned to office as
Premier, and notwithstanding the narrow vote on which Mr. Colton was deposed,
the new Ministry was long-lived. Persistent crisis-mongering has never been repeated
to such excess as in former times, and Parliamentary government has been pursued with
much more dignity.
■o j
During the
1877 session of
Parliament a useful
Crown La nd s
Consolidation Bill
was carried, which
repealed all the
statutes (31 in
number) relating to
the Crown lands of
South Australia
proper, and also
liberalised the laws
governing: agricul-
O OO
tural, pastoral, and
mineral tenants.
Amendments were
made in following
years. A loan of
£ 1,03 6,6 00 was
authorised for water
Railway Viaducts between Mitcham and Blackwood
supply and railway construction, and for a breakwater at Victor Harbor. The railways
provided for were to run from Hamley Bridge to Balaklava, Kadina to Wallaroo, and
the Barunga Extension. Ihe projection of these new' public works demanded more
taxation, and the Boucaut Government proposed by resolution a propertv tax and an
income tax. Ihe Assembly assented to the former, but declined to have anything to
do with the latter.
Befoie the necessary Bill was introduced, a change of Premiership took place.
Upon the death of Mr. Justice Stow, the Premier, Mr. Boucaut, was elevated to the
1 an. in September, 1878, became Premier,
with Messrs. C. Mann, G. C. Hawker, W. H. Bundey, T. Playford, and R. Rees


V
XT
(who was succeeded by Mr. 1. King), as colleagues. 1 his was practically the same
Got eminent, tinder a new leader, and held office (with some change of pevsounel r ) until
March. 1881.
In accordance with the resolutions previously passed in the Assembly, the
Morgan Government brought in a Land and Property Tax Bill. The Lower House,
apparently with the approval of the public, passed the measure, but the Council rejected
it b\ ten votes to two. Prom this time a desire to reform that body seemed to become
general ; but before anything definite was done, the Chamber brought upon itself further
obloquy. In IS7S it rejected railway Bills, the object being to discountenance too heavy
an expenditure of public money. As it was, a Loan Bill for ,£2,058,000 was carried,
making the third within a very short period. I nder this, railways from Adelaide to
Nairne, Hallett to 1 erowie, Moonta to Moonta Bay, I erowie to Pichirichi, and a branch
to Jamestown, were authorised—a heavy enough outlay, in connection with the others,
for 300,000 people.
The Parliamentary session of
J
1879 was colorless. The Property and
Income Tax Bill was again defeated,
and the Immigration vote was reduced.
The demands of these loans upon the
revenue began to be seriously felt,
and the Budget showed a deficit. In
1880, owing to public works expendi-
ture, money seemed to be abundant
among the people ; but there was a
seriotis disparity between the State
revenue and the expenditure. Mr.
J. C. Bray drew particular attention
to this point. W hen Parliament was
H. M.C. S. Protector
opened on June 2, 1881. the Morgan Government proposed to curtail expenditure, impose fair
taxation, and to reform the Legislative Council. Before the Premier was able to pursue
his programme, private circumstances led to his resignation. Mr. G. C. Hawker sought
to form a Ministry ; but he failed, and eventually Mr. j. C. Bray succeeded, having as
colleagues Messrs. L. Clyde, j. W. Downer, Q.C., j. G. Ramsay, Alfred Catt, and J. L.
Parsons. Mr. Bray was the first native of South Australia to become premier, and his
dexterity in debate, his shrewdness, and his general talents, did honor to the Province.
The reform of the Upper House was the great measure of the session. Stow
points out that from 1875 to 1881 the Council had thrown out every measure, except one,
for taxing property. Public feeling upon its obstructive tactics was frequently expressed
in very severe terms. The one-district system had become objectionable; it prevented
representative and represented from knowing much of each other. The object sought to
i8g
TheJubi,ee ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


be attained in constituting’ the whole Province as one electorate was to prevent the return
of provincialists, and to secure men of broad views acceptable to all, and not the nominee
of a particular class ; but it was not satisfactory in practice. * A measure to reform the
Legislative Council was therefore welcomed. As a matter of fact, the Upper House
reformed itself. It passed a Bill under which the number of members was increased from
18 to 24. One-third of the members were to retire every three years instead of four,
making the maximum tenure of a seat nine years, and the Province was divided into four
O J
districts for the election of Councillors. In addition, it was made lawful for the Governor
to dissolve both Houses, or to issue writs for the election of not more than two additional
members of the Legislative Council for each district, when the Council had refused to
o
accept any measure passed by the Assembly by absolute majorities in two sessions. Ihe
object was to obtain “ample security against deadlocks, or Upper House obstructiveness.
In the following year a new Electoral Act for the Assembly was passed, and under it the
number of electoral districts was increased from 21 to 26, and the number of members
from 46 to 52.
A Loan Bill for ,£1,287,608, to carry on various public works, was passed in
1881, and several other important measures became law. The 1882 session was prolific.
Fifty-two Bills were passed, among them Bills for railways from Nairne to the Victorian
border, and from Gladstone to Laura, for the construction of wharfs at Port Augusta, and
for the purchase of a warship. The Land Laws were subjected to considerable amendment
on lines suggested by recent droughts in the remote areas. The failure of the harvest in
1881-2 had created great distress among the northern farmers, notwithstanding that
Adelaide was the centre of a boom. So severe, indeed, was the drought, that the
Government was compelled to have water carried to some townships, and the country
was canvassed lor subscriptions to supply seed wheat to distressed farmers. The Crown
Lands Bill enabled those settled on land unsuited to agriculture to surrender, and to
select elsewhere; provided for the granting of concessions to selectors who for three
successive seasons had reaped poor crops ; and introduced a new and liberal system
of sale on credit.
In January, 1883, Sir William Jervois’ term of office expired. At a farewell
luncheon, held on January 5, he reviewed the progress made during his sojourn in the
Province, and proudly declared that open railways had increased from 321 to 946 miles;
that revenue and export had expanded ; that 40 new primary schools had been opened ;
that institutes had developed ; and that an Art Gallery, a Public Library, a Museum, and
a School of Art and Design had been located in a handsome building that cost £40,000.
He remarked that special provision should be made for the payment of interest on loan
moneys, the public debt having increased from ££,217.000 to £11,369.300. and advocated
the encouragement of immigration, and of pastoral, agricultural, and mineral development.
On January 9, he embarked for New Zealand.

of the Province. 11 is official career began in 1855, when he became secretary to his
brother, Sir Hercules Robinson. In [862 he was appointed President of Montserrat; then
Governor of Dominica, Falkland Islands, Prince Edward Island, Leeward Islands, and
ol Western Australia. He was a good business man, and talented in other respects.
11 is term of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of South Australia began on Pebruary 17,
1883, and did not end until March 5, 1889.
Early in the session of 1883 the Government defeated a no-confidence motion,
Elder Conservatorium of Music (in course of construction)
and Mr. Pray remained in office until June 16, 1884. Owing to a deficit, new taxation
was proposed ; but the Legislative Council declined to pass an Income and Property
Taxation Pill. On March 19, 1884, the tenth Parliament was dissolved, and when the
eleventh met on June 5 it comprised, for the first time, 52 members. The Pray Ministry
was soon defeated on a want of confidence motion introduced by Mr. Colton, and on
June 16 the latter assumed office at the head of a Government composed of Messrs.
218

W. K. Rounsevell, C. C. Kingston, Jenkin Coles, Thomas Playford, and R. C. Baker.
Very pressing subjects for decision claimed the attention of the Government. There was
a deficit of ,£436,658, and to balance revenue and expenditure new taxation was imperative.
The Opposition and the people are always ready to cry down any Government proposing
taxation, but on this occasion the need for it was plain to all. Opinions disagreed as to
the kind of taxation. The Government, departing from the policy of previous administrations,
proposed a land and income tax. The landholders cried out, but Parliament passed the
Bill. The tax amounted to one halfpenny in the pound on all land in the Province (excluding
the value of improvements upon it); threepence in the pound on trade and professional
incomes, and sixpence in the pound on incomes derived from any other source. Land
used for religious, charitable, and institute purposes was exempted. Other important
measures were carried, such as an Agricultural Crown Land Act and a Pastoral Land
Act the first offering new concessions to selectors, the second dividing pastoral lands
into three great classes, altering the basis of the leasing system, and granting compensation
for improvements.
Port Adelaide in 1884
In June, 1885, Mr. John Downer, Q.C. —now the Hon. Sir John Downer- a native
of the Province, and a very able politician and lawyer, ejected the Colton Government and
formed a new Ministry, consisting of Messrs, J. B. Spence, S. Newland, J. Darling,
f. H. Howe, and Dr. Cockburn now Sir John A. Cockburn. The ensuing session
was not altogether satisfactory, but it marked “the first deliberate advance of South
Australia towards a policy of Protection. A Loan Bill tor ,£1,332,400 was passed, and
provided for £537,400 to be expended on railways, £530,000 on waterworks, and other
amounts for defence, telegraph, and telephone extension, and harbor improvement. In
1886, a re-construction took place; and a Stamps Bill, a Land Bill, a Real Property Bill,
and a Gold Mining Bill were carried. There was a new Loan Bill for £850,000, which
made provision for £125,000 to be spent on the Beetaloo Waterworks, £200,000 on
water conservation, and £450,000 on payment for improvements on pastoral leases. Mr.
Downer attended a Colonial Conference held in London, and received the honor of
knighthood.


C jf * \

Soon after the Twelfth Parliament met in June, 1887, Mr. Fhomas Playford, one
of the most reliable and shrewd of South Australian legislators, carried a motion of want
of confidence in the Downer Government before the Premier had returned from England.
The new Ministry, comprising Messrs. C. C. Kingston, J. G. Ramsay, J. Coles, Alfred Catt,
and J. C. F. Johnson, grappled with the question of tariff reform, and heavy protective
duties were passed by both Houses. Payment of members at the rate of £2OO per
annum was decided on, and a long debate took place on the subject of payment for
improvements to pastoral lessees. A measure to hand over the control of the railways to
a non-political board was
carried; also a Bill to
authorise the issue of / \ N
Treasury Bills for /

,£1,000,000, and an Electoral Bill adding- two new members to the by declaring
J J o
the Northern Territory an electoral district.
I his was the last session of Parliament under the administration of Sir William
Robinson. On March 5, 1889, he left South Australia for Victoria, and was the recipient
of many cordial addresses. His encouragement of educational institutions, and his assistance
in securing the success of the Jubilee Exhibition, had made for him many admirers.
Because the greatest problems were solved, exploration did not now excite the

same interest as in previous days. Huge stretches of territory remained (and still remain)
to be traversed ; but they could not possess anything essentially different from what had
already been examined. Pastoralists pushed farther north, and examined new country ; but
except for the necessity of opening up stock routes, exploration in future was principally
for the geologist, the miner, and students of inland flora and fauna. In 1879, country
between Queensland and the Northern Territory was traversed by a party sent out by
the proprietors of the Queenslander , a Brisbane newspaper. Mr. Eavenc discovered a
large area of pastoral country near the Gulf of Carpentaria ; and Mr. Alexander Forrest, after
great privations, journeyed from the north-west of Western Australia to Port Darwin.
In 1883 Mr. A. N. Chambers and Mr. E. Coates marked out a route from Denial Bay
to the Warburton Ranges, and in December of that year Mr. Charles Winnecke completed
an exploration into the interior. In 1883, also, Mr. W. W. Mills went from Beltana, in
the North, to Champion Bay, in Western Australia. Mr. Winnecke made further
explorations in the interior in 1884. Many private parties gathered information concerning
the central territory.

j substantial, if not rapid, progress has been made. The

i J country possessed of other resources than those found in

? mere incidents in history have taught useful lessons
T*S«»NI»V J
which are not all forgotten. Business has become healthier
in tone, and a useful momentum has been given to the
establishment of new industries. Ihe years 1889-99 have demonstrated that the South
Australian people are patient and self-reliant, that they can suffer and struggle and
persevere with becoming fortitude.
The events to be recorded in this chapter begin with the arrival of the Karl of
Kintore, on April 11, 1889, to succeed Sir W. C. F. Robinson as Governor. Lord
Kintore was an M.A. of Cambridge, was Captain of Her Majesty’s Body Guard in tBB6,
was sworn in as a Privy Councillor in the same year, and was a Deputy-Lieutenant for
Aberdeen and Kincardineshire. He possessed no experience in the colonial service, nor


had he taken a prominent place in Imperial politics, but he was an able man who
adapted himself to the ways of the colonists, and who quickly obtained their esteem.
On June 27, 1889, the Playford Government was superseded by a Ministry formed by
Dr. Cockburn. The new Premier sought to carry several advanced democratic measures ,
but, owing to the division of parties, was not uniformly successful. On August 19, 1890,
Mr. Playford ejected Dr. Cockburn, and held office until June 21, 1892.
In 1890, South Australia, in common with its neighbors, was grievously afflicted
by a maritime strike, which paralysed trade, and caused such heavy losses to individuals
and to trading companies, that years of careful management were necessary to enable
them to recover lost ground. It was a time of social unrest, when class was pitted against
class throughout Australia. Except in isolated instances, a mammoth industrial war was
waged without personal violence. The Government and Parliament assumed a neutral
position, and, beyond encouraging conciliation and providing protection, left the two great
forces capital and labor —to adjust their own differences. Ihe suffering in South Australia
was rendered the more acute by reason of a strike of miners in the Peninsula copper fields,
where 500 men relinquished work. Apart from these calamities the year was fairly
prosperous, even though the speculators were cast into tribulation by the re-action of the
silver boom. The farmers had obtained average returns ; and when they are satisfied, the
general community has very little to complain of.

The harvest of 1890-1 was almost equal to those of the two preceding years. The
value of breadstuffs exported in 1890 was £2,018,719, and in 1891, £1,927,483.
The year 1892 was one of trial for the agriculturists, and the export of breadstuffs
was but ,£944,264. It had commenced amid good prospects, but it soon became
chequered with anxiety and disappointment. There was a general strike of miners at
Broken Hill. South Australia had obtained the chief advantages from the argentiferous
wealth of that district, which lay just beyond her borders, in New South Wales. The
merchants supplied Broken Hill residents with goods ; her producers sent them (lour and
hay, vegetables and fruits ; and the railways of South Australia obtained the whole
benefit of her traffic. In addition, South Australians owned a large proportion of shares
in the principal mines, from which they obtained substantial dividends. Certainly the
Province was robbed of thousands of inhabitants who went thither, but practically it
still sustained them. When, therefore, the miners went out on strike in 1892, South
Australia suffered more than New South Wales. Upwards of 20,000 people had settled
on the Barrier, and nearly all were dependent on the silver mines. For months the
battle between the mining companies and the men continued, and commercial operations
were dislocated. Hundreds of thousands of pounds that should have been paid in wages
and dividends were irretrievably lost, and social rancor was aroused. Cases of hardship
and actual privation were reckoned by thousands. The strike had unpleasant features
which were not existent in the episode of 1890. It also served to show how important


the field had become to South Australia. With the end of this social war there was
no immediate abatement in the ill-feeling between the two classes.
In June, 1892, Mr. F. W. Holder carried a vote of want of confidence in the
Playford Government, and took office as Premier. There was for a time a repetition in
politics of the political unrest ol 20 and 25 years before. This was caused principally
by the number ol parties in the House. Mr. Holder had to give way to Sir John
Downer within four months of taking office, but even the Downer Ministry did not
represent the views of the majority in the Assembly. Soon after the Fourteenth Parliament
met. in June, 1893, Sir John was summarily ejected by Mr. C. C. Kingston, O.C. —now the
Right Hon. C. C. Kingston -(son of the Founder, Sir G. S. Kingston), who was supported by
a powerful following. Mr. Kingston managed to blend sections which were previously opposed
to each other, and among his colleagues were three previous Premiers—Messrs. Playford.
Holder, and Cockburn and two popular young politicians, the Hon. J. 11. Gordon, M.L.C.,
and Mr. P. P. Gillen, M.P. It was called at the time a “ Ministry of all the talents.”
I he coalition was effective In consolidating parties, and as a consequence, the Kingston
Government continued in office longer than any previous administration in South Australia.
It was displaced on November 29, 1899, by a hostile motion carried in the Assembly by
a majority of one, but at that time only Mr. Kingston and Mr. Holder remained ol the
original members of the Cabinet. A new Ministry was formed by Mr. V. L. Solomon,
who had not previously held office as a Minister of the Crown. The Solomon Ministry,
however, only held office for seven days, Mr. Holder securing a majority ol three votes in
moving the adjournment of the House immediately it met on the day after Mr. Solomon
had announced the policy of his Ministry. The cause of all the trouble was a measure
introduced by the Kingston Government to alter the franchise for the Legislative Council
by giving a vote to every householder. This Pill had been passed by the House of Assembly
in 1898, but rejected by the Legislative Council. At the time of the General Elections
in 1899 the electors were asked to express approval or otherwise of the Pill, with the
result that 49,208 voted in favor of it, and 33,928 against it. Portified by the result of
this referendum, the Kingston Ministry re-introduced the Pill into the House of Assembly,
where it was again carried in the same form as previously, it being understood that should
the Legislative Council reject it the Ministry would avail itself of the constitutional power
to either dissolve both Houses or take steps to have eight additional members elected to
the Council. Mr. Kingston declining to give a promise that the Houses should not be
dissolved, caused certain members to seek a means of avoiding this—preferring to consider
their own personal convenience, and the cost of having to go through another electoral
campaign, to that of the expressed wishes of their constituents and the promises they had
made when securing election but a few months previously —sacrificing principle to pocket.
Thus was the required majority found to turn out the Kingston Ministry, the malcontents
being given to understand that Mr. Solomon would secure a reduction ot the franchise
qualification to £ 15. When the policy, however, was announced, it was found that instead
of it was to be £ 2O, and that not till next year, while the present voters wives were

to at once have a vote given them. This was considered so unsatisfactory that members
turned round, and ousted the Solomon Ministry, but gained their point in saving the
dissolution by supporting Mr. Holder, whose policy was that of a £ls franchise with the
vote to wives. This the Upper House also rejected, and further action is postponed till
the result is known of the periodical Legislative Council election to be held in 1900. Mr.
Holders colleagues are the Hon. j. H. Gordon, and Messrs. J. G. Jenkins, L.
O’Loughlin, R. W. Foster, and E. L. Batchelor. The inclusion of the latter marks the
first Ministerial recognition of the Labor Party, Mr. Batchelor having been its chairman
since the decease of Mr. J. A. McPherson, its first leader. Consequent upon the time
spent over this franchise question, the result of the first session of the Sixteenth I arliament
must be written down as barren.
Once more a series of unpropitious circumstances has to be referred to. V\ bile
1892 was an unfortunate year, it did not compare with 1893. Wheat, wool, copper, and
silver depreciated in price. Breadstuffs valued at ,£1,074,583 were exported, and the total
value of the products of the Province sent away was only ,£3,295,475. in comparison
with £4,685,313 in 1891. In the remote northern farming districts the returns were
disheartening. The comparative, but temporary, unprofitableness of the grain and wool
industries turned a proportion of energy into other channels. Dairying and wine- and
fruit-growing were encouraged. A system of paying butter bonuses had been established
by the Government a few years before, and there had been a consequent increase in the
outputs. Practical encouragement was given to wine export. The Kingston Government
established a depot in London where South Australian wines of good quality only were
supplied to the British consumer, the depot being also used for other produce. Ihe
226
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Conclusions


number of dairy cattle, and the area under vines, increased. As early as the forties
the suitability of local soils for wine production was tested by several settlers. Ihe
South Australian Company sent vines to the Province in its first ships; in 1840 Mr. John
Reynell planted a vineyard at Reynella, near Adelaide; and in 1846 Mr. Patrick Auld
formed the nucleus ot the Auldana Vineyard. Thenceforth settlers here and there
devoted some attention to wine-making. It was not, however, until the early seventies
that any considerable export trade with England was carried on, and the vintage gradually
increased from that time. The wine export in 1888 was valued at A 33.903, and in 1891 at
1 he product in 1893 and 1894 was small, but in the following years new vineyards
came into bearing, and in 1897 the highest export was attained—lß94, £49,475 ; 1895,
-£58.826 : 1896, ,£73,316; 1897, £"82,553; 1898, £78,381 ; and 1899, £77,773 —showing
that local vineyards are likely to prove substantial sources of wealth. In addition to a
poor harvest and low prices in 1893, the people were made to suffer from other causes,
which had their origin outside the bounds of the Province. A land boom in Melbourne,
\ ictoria, in 1890, had attracted a large number of people from South Australia, as well
as from the other colonies, and, because of the greater magnitude of the operations, the
re-action in that colony was more severe than in the case of previous incidents of the kind.
Victoria was intensely depressed, and public and private institutions were soon in financial
difficulties. Over and above this, depression was general from north to south and east to
west of Australia, excepting In Western Australia, where phenomenal gold discoveries had
been made. No period in Australian history equalled this in financial embarrassment, and
the climax was not long in arriving.
o o
In the eighties much privation was caused in Adelaide by the collapse of the
local Commercial Bank. Just when the liquidators were finally settling the accounts of
that unfortunate institution, the Federal Bank closed its doors. Then a financial cataclysm,
starting in Tasmania and Victoria, deluged the whole of Australia. The enormous
operations in land in Melbourne, and the risky and unscientific business that had been
carried on by banking institutions there and elsewhere, culminated in a crisis unparalleled
in the Southern Hemisphere. The failure of one or two small financial houses caused
a grim rush on every great intercolonial banking company, and one after another had to
close its doors for the purpose of re-construction. Nothing could stem the wave of fear
which seized upon depositors. Within a few weeks of the Eastertide of 1893 (according
to one statement) 12 banks suspended payment, involving £8,735,950 of capital,
£4,596,000 reserves, £78,611,801 deposits, £11,456,433 coin and bullion, and £80,980,728
advances. Very many who had thought themselves wealthy were reduced to absolute
poverty, and the ruin was deep and wide.
As after-events proved, the losses were not so great as would appear in the
figures. The important institutions that had suspended payment resumed business.
Weakly institutions, that had been a delusion and a snare, were dredged away, and
the financial streams were cleared. The crisis and the depression established colonial
201
Concl,,sions ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


finance, both public and private, upon a more healthy basis. Banks became more
careful in their conduct of business, and merchants and shopkeepers followed their example.
It may even be said that the financial position of Australia to-day is better than it
has been for many years, and especially than it was in the recent period of apparent
prosperity. South Australia did not feel the strain so severely as her Victorian neighbors,
mainly because her people were more cautious ; a good harvest or two, with lair pi ices,
would terminate her troubles. The Bank of Adelaide, which had its head office in
the city, was one of the very few large banking institutions in Australia that did not
close its doors.
Bank of Adelaide
Unfortunately the good harvests that might make all the difference did not
J O
arrive when expected, yet the financial condition of the Province is sound. Ihe people
have been patient and hopeful, and have spiritedly put their houses in order in preparation
for the good years that must be before them. Prices in 1894 were lower even than
in the previous year, and the harvest was below the average. In 1895 there was a
slight rise In wheat, and although the harvest was no better than its predecessors, the
general condition of the Province was more encouraging. Ihe price ot wheat was higher
still in 1896 and 1897, but the drought continued to devastate the north country. To
relieve the distress among the farmers in the remote districts, a Seed \\ heat Loan Act
was passed by Parliament, and public subscriptions were obtained. The harvest in 1596-7
averaged only 1 '66 bushels per acre, in 1897-8 it was 2A4, and in 1898-9, 4’9i. Ihe loss to
the Province is seen in the small annual export of breadstuffs —1894, ,£1,082,665; 1895,
£873,872 ; 1896, £643,332 ; 1897, £230,868 ; 1898, £261,898; and 1899. £7 8 3«75 T -

I hese years have also been disheartening to the pastoralists. Owing to the
droughts, and also to the ravages of rabbits, huge tracts of territory have been surrendered,
and the wilderness has reclaimed its own. Many flocks have been literally decimated,
and in some instances have been completely exterminated. The number of sheep in
the Province has ominously decreased, and for some years the prices to be obtained
for wool have been unprofitably low. In 1890-1 there were in the Province 7,004,642 sheep,
35T938 cattle, and 187,686 horses; in 1898-9 these figures were reduced to 5,012,620
sheep, 260.343 cattle, and 161,774 horses. The export of wool in 1893 was valued at
£ 2, 001,277, in 1898 at ,£1,167,181, and in 1899 at £1,511,693, when wool exceeded all
previous values in Adelaide, reaching to is£d. for greasy merino, i2 J / 4d. for greasy lambs,
26f£l. for scoured merino, and 14% d. for greasy crossbred. Comparatively, there has been
Bird’s Eye View of Port Pirie
as much suffering among the remote pastoralists as among the farmers. Some shrinkage in the
volume of exports, accompanied by a reduction of prices, has caused the total value
of exportable products of the Province to seriously diminish. Of the greater
industries, copper and wine are the only items that do not show a decrease. From
,£4,410,062 in 1890, the figures went down to ,£2,487,009 j n 1898. But throughout
this period, with the exception of 1897, the balance of value between imports consumed
and local produce exported has been in favor of the latter. South Australia, by its
position in relation to Broken Hill and the border country in Victoria, New South Wales,
and Queensland, gains very substantially. The total exports in 1891 were £, 10,5 1 2,049,
while those of the produce of the Colony were only £"4,685,313; in the same year the

»■« it
total imports were ,£9,956,542, while only ,£4,129,806 was retained for local consumption.
The ratio is preserved in other years, which shows that the merchant, the agent, and the
railways gain enormously from neighboring colonies. 1 his is particularly the case in regard
to Broken Hill. At Port Pirie immense smelting works have been erected by the leading
silver mining company of the Barrier, and employ above 1,000 men. 1 here is now a
thriving community at that port.
It is pleasing to record that in the years of depression the public finances were
so carefully managed by the Kingston Government, with the Hon. P. W. Holder as
Treasurer, that, with the exception of one year, there has been no deficit. Retrenchment
was vigorously pursued to bring the expenditure below the revenue, and public works
construction brought almost to a standstill. The Parliament and the Government
presented an example to the people in these respects. I here was very little needless
Institute and two views of Ellen Sireet, Port Pirie
lamentation or impotent repining; but a spirit of sturdy confidence in local resources
generally prevailed. In the first year or two of depression there was a considerable
number of unemployed, but the Government, by advanced legislation, aided by what
might be termed adventitious circumstances, greatly relieved this class of distress. In the
latter case, the phenomenal discoveries on the desert wilderness of Western Australia,
traversed under such difficult circumstances by P'orrest, Giles, and another explorer named
Hunt, attracted thousands of persons from South Australia. Gold was found in quartz
reefs in such unusual quantities, that Western Australia doubled its population in a few
months, receiving its first voluntary accession of people in any considerable numbers since
1829-30, or immediately after the foundation of the colony. From one point of view the
migration of people from this Province was a distinct loss ; from another it was a most
fortunate circumstance. The glut in the labor market was quickly relieved, and men

whose outlook had been extremely discouraging were enabled to obtain good wages. The
V\ estern Australian goldfields worked for good in South Australia in yet other respects.
Local producers found a high-priced market for hay and butter, local manufacturers for
every class ot mining machinery, local merchants for their goods, and local capital for
investment. Ihe best of the Western Australian groups of mines was originally owned
by an Adelaide syndicate, and the local men who took up their residence in the West
invariably left their families in this Province, and despatched, through the money order
office, substantial sums of money in the aggregate to their relatives. In truth, the
\\ estern Australian goldfields afforded great relief to all Australia at an awkward period.
h urther relief to the labor market was afforded by the Government in the
formation of Village Settlements on the communistic principle. Seven or eight of these
small communities were established bv State assistance, and although they have not been
a remarkable success, their establishment served a useful purpose. In providing a
temporary outlet lor the energy of a class which was idle by compulsion, they were
undoubtedly useful, and may be said to have augmented the assets of the Province.
The Holder Village Settlement
Concurrent with this, the Government has given practical encouragement to what is known
as the Homestead Blocks system, initiated many years before by the Hon. G. \V. Cotton,
under which working men are able to obtain, on nominal terms, the fee-simple of a plot
of soil which they may cultivate in their spare time, and upon which they may build a
cottage, thus becoming landed proprietors. This is an admirable innovation, which has
attracted deserved attention from other countries. The applications for blocks have
sometimes been so numerous that the Government has not been able to supply them.
There are now in South Australia magnificent examples of the advantages of this unique
system.
Over and above necessary legislation designed to meet the peculiar conditions
of local economy, the Kingston Ministry projected measures compatible with the
advanced liberal, or democratic, views of the constituencies. These have supplied the
most decided feature of local politics in the present decade. Some of them, such as the
Village Settlements Act, were demanded by conditions prevailing at the time. A

Civil Service, is another example. It was drafted by the Premier, and was designed as a
solution ol strike difficulties —a very serious question in political economy, especially a few
years ago. While the measure was admittedly clever in conception, it has not been
extensively utilised.
Among the most important measures introduced and carried by the Kingston
Government were Adult Suffrage, an Employers’ Liability Bill, a Closer Settlement
Bill, a Bill to provide for the establishment of a State Bank, a Factory Bill, and bills
providing for a progressive system in land and income taxation, and in succession
duties. Under the Adult Suffrage Act the vote was extended to women, and they for the
first time appeared in practical politics at the General Election in 1896. Ihe vote did not

seem to materially affect the balance of parties. The Closer Settlement Act empowered
the Government to purchase, under certain conditions, large estates that were believed to
be insufficiently utilised, and to cut them up into sections principally for the benefit of
farmers. The Succession Duties Act was of such a nature that the Imperial Government,
when effecting a modification in the British laws, used it as a precedent, and transferred
many of its principles to a new bill Introduced into the Commons by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer. Among advanced measures which the Government has not yet been able
to carry are some dealing with early closing, law reform, and the abolition of a
property qualification for electors in the Legislative Council. The Kingston Government,

in its advocacy of advanced liberal measures, may be looked upon as the product of
the democratic sentiment prevailing in the Province since its proclamation, and especially
since responsible government was advocated and established.
One other special political feature is the development of the Eederal sentiment,
and its crystallisation into definite action. Since the establishment of responsible
government numerous conferences of representatives from the several Australian colonies
have assembled to determine on united action in matters of intercolonial import, but it
was not until the last two decades that any decided desire was manifested for a
constitutional federation. In 1883, it was enacted that a Eederal Council, composed
of delegates from each of the colonies that chose to be represented, should meet
Happy Valley Reservoir
periodically to debate questions which seemed to demand united action. This Council
having no executive power, was not by any means a great success. A Convention of
historic importance was held in Sydney in 1891, by which a constitution was framed, but
local politics so absorbed the attention of the colonial parliaments that no further progress
was made for several years. At length an agreement was reached between the several
Premiers to lift the subject out of the region of political partisanship, and allow of it
being dealt with by the people who were most concerned. In pursuance of this
arrangement, an elected Convention, representing all the colonies but Queensland, assembled
in Adelaide in March, 1897, which afterwards held adjourned sessions in Sydney and
Melbourne. The result of its labors was a Commonwealth Bill, which, after enduring
some vicissitudes and being slightly amended, was accepted by a popular vote in all the

colonies but Western Australia during 1899. The closing year of the century will,
therefore, be memorable as the Federation year, which witnessed the birth of a strong and
self-reliant nation under the Southern Cross.
The construction of railways has not been pursued with the vigor significant of the
previous decade. The only lines laid down and opened up to December, 1897, were
Glanville and Largs Bay (1891), Woodville and Henley Beach (1893), Peake and Angle
Pole (1891), and Blyth and Gladstone, with a branch to Snowtown (1894). On June

Qn April 10, 1895, the Earl of Kintore relinquished office, and was succeeded as
Governor by Sir Thomas Lowell Buxton, Bart., K.C.M.G. This gentleman took office on
October 29, 1895.
and retired in
Decern ber, 1898.
He was a grandson
of Thomas P owell
Buxton, the first
baronet, who was
distinguished for his
advocacy of the
abolition of slavery,
and of the liberal-
ising of the Penal
code. Born in
January, 1837, he
succeeded to the
baronetcy in 1858.
Botanic Gardens
He entered the House of Commons in 1865, was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk in
1876, and was a familiar figure at Exeter Hall. Philanthropic like his ancestor, the retiring
Governor was also unostentatious, and was most kindly disposed towards local religious
institutions. The Chief Justice, the Right Hon. S. J. Way, P.C., was administrator during
the interregnum. His varied and great services to the Province were appropriately
recognised in 1899 by his receiving the title of baronet. No South Australian stands, or
deserves to stand, in higher esteem than Sir Samuel Way.
The announcement that Lord Tennyson had been chosen to succeed Sir Powell
Buxton caused great and general satisfaction. As a son of the late poet laureate, he bore
a popular name, while his ability as a literary man and in other respects, secured for him
a cordial welcome on his own account. Though he had no previous experience of official


life, his Lordship speedily showed that he was able to adapt himself to new conditions,
entered heartily into the interests of colonial life, and proved himself fully equal to the
position. His genial disposition, sound judgment, and wise counsels on many important
questions, were highly appreciated by all classes of the community.
Of course the city and its residents have not been exempt from depression during
the period. I here has not been that increase in population which might be expected
during a series of good years, and building operations have been limited. The trade of
city merchants and retailers has been restricted, while every department of energy has
been affected. But here, as in the country, the citizens have shown admirable patience.
Despite dull years, many substantial improvements have been effected. The water supply
has been rendered more reliable by the construction of the Happy Valley Reservoir, at a
cost of £493,458. The
electric light has been
installed, and numerous
smaller undertakings
o
have been carried out.
Instead of a
diminution, there has
been an increase in the
total amount of the
assessments. From

decidedly good. Ihe population on January i, 1900, was put down at 41,005, and that
of the Province, including the Northern Territory, at 373,378. The successive Mayors
have been:—lßß9, Mr. James Shaw, J.P. ; 1890-1, Mr. Lewis Cohen, M.P. ; 1892, Mr.
b. W. Bullock, J.P. ; 1893-4, Mr. Charles Willcox, J.P. ; and 1895-6-7-8, Mr. Charles
Fucker, J.P. ; while Mr. A. W. Ware has been elected for 1899 and 1900. On January
24, 1898, Mr. 1 homas Worsnop, Town Clerk since 1869, and author of two useful
publications dealing with the metropolis, died in Adelaide, and Mr. Adam Wright was
appointed to the vacancy, but resigned shortly after, Mr. T. G. Ellery succeeding him.
No depression such as could ever visit South Australia could detract from the
beauty or permanently prejudicially affect the importance of its capital. Adelaide as a
picture is as beautiful as any capital city in the world-wide British Empire. As an object

lesson in colonial energy it can hardly be surpassed. Ihe Adelaide of the nineties symbolises
the irrepressible energy of the pioneers and those who followed them. Lpon the “beautiful
stream,” flanked by large trees, described by Governor Hindmarsh in his letter to Mr. G.
E. Angas in January, 1837, has gradually grown a magnificent city. In place of the lines
of survey pegs fixed among the trees by Colonel Light and his surveyors early in the same
vear are now great buildings of brick and stone and even of marble, macadamised streets
J o o
and terraces, and artistically laid-out squares and parks. Except in the Botanic Park, not
one of the original trees survive. But the scene of natural beauty that so pleased the eye
of Colonel Light in 1836 has been replaced by a scene only less beautiful, and perhaps
more stirringly impressive—the handiwork or art of man compared with the artlessness and
idyllic abandon of Nature.
Adelaide is the
proud possessor of most of
the advantages of old-world
cities. She is the centre
of an extensive railway
system and of all the great
institutions of an important
Province. Here and there
rise the steeples of
cathedrals and churches, or
the lofty heights of great
public buildings, banking
houses, and commercial
edifices. Her streets, along
which busy throngs daily
pass, are wide, and are
ornamented with trees
representative of many
climes, and bounded by
continuous rows of buildings.
Botanic Gardens
She has an efficient water supply, and the highest laws of hygiene have been obeyed in
her drainage system. Well-organised Fire Brigades, subsidised by the State, provide
protection in cases of fire. A Council of clear-headed business men manages her affairs.
The parks, reserves, and squares are laid out in avenues and rustic paths, and the Botanic
Gardens, supplied in the hothouse and the open with choice and rare blooms, shrubs, and
trees of various lands, are a fine example in landscape gardening. Adjoining the latter
is a Botanic Park, encircled and divided by charming drives, where, side by side with
the oak, the elm, and the ash, are great gums, monarchs of the Australian woodlands.
Next to this are Zoological Gardens, where the lion, the tiger, and the monkey reside
near the opossum, the dingo, and the laughing jackass. An artificial lake is not the least
of the beauties of the city.

In our general sketch of the history of South Australia and of the affairs of
Adelaide and surrounding centres of population, the reader should be able to get some
conception of the circumstances which from time to time have contributed to the present
state of develop-
ment, Eve n
though the past
has produced no
world-known heroes, there
is yet a great opportunity
for some able pen to tell
the story of aborigine,
of struggling pioneer,
Zoological Gardens
and of sweet country scenery with primeval somnolency upon it. In the bush South
Australia has had its warriors as brave, inflexible, and ingenious as most British heroes,
and often against conditions apparently hopeless.
As yet she is a comparatively unsettled country. There are great stretches of
woodland and plain uninhabited, and there are resources which arc only vaguely understood.
With the Northern Territory South Australia extends over an area of 903,690 square
miles, or 578,361,600 acres; and yet this country held in 1898-9 only 5,012,620 sheep,

had under cultivation in the same year only 2,967,370 acres, and possessed a population of
but 373,378 persons. The soils suitable for agriculture and horticulture are admittedly
highly fruitful, and the pastures produce some of the best wool in the world. There are
immense belts of mineral country, which, through the lack of capital, are waiting to be
prospected, and there are extensive forests containing timber, capable of yielding
considerable wealth.
With systematic and scientific treatment the future of the agricultural districts
J o
should be bright. The wheat produced in the Northern Areas commands the highest
price. In recent years, with the help of labor-saving machinery, large reductions have been
made in the cost of production, and the droughts have caused the more enlightened cultivators
to amend their methods of farming. Most of the best agricultural lands are situated near
o o
ranges, where, with the aid of capital, extensive and fairly cheap schemes of water
conserv a t i on an d
irrigation could be
O
carried out. To this
department much
careful attention will
have to be given in
the future. Also
tracts of country at
present occupied by
farmers will have to
be surrendered and
handed over to the
pastoral is t. Were
this done, the average
of the returns would
be raised, extreme
misfortune would be
Hospital, Adelaide
saved to the Province, and cultivation in the reliable districts would be intensified. The
Closer Settlement Act affords an opportunity. But even without these desirable changes
the future of agriculture in South Australia is assured. Cycles of droughts are bound to
recur, and so, also, are cycles of prosperous years. South Australia was projected as an
agricultural country, and she has soil eminently adapted for this primary industry.
In the Lower North, Central, and South-Eastern Districts there are extensive
areas practically unutilised which might be devoted to vine culture for wine-making purposes,
and in recent years closer attention has been directed to other industries than agriculture.
Numerous experiments have been tried, and a strong impetus given to viticulture and dairy
farming-. South Australian wines are gradually gaining in popularity, and the result has
O
been an increase in the area under vines. In 1890 there were 7,352 acres so occupied, and


i
f
in 1899 there were 19,159 acres. According to present indications the near future will
probably show a still greater increase, and there is every promise of the industry annually
drawing substantial amounts of outside capital into the Province. Within the past ten years
the area devoted to fruit cultivation in contradistinction to viticulture has been more than
doubled, and with the improved opportunities for shipment, a large market should be found
in Great Britain. Fruit preserving, canning, and drying are becoming important industries.
Of industries that are in their initiatory stages are silk culture, and llax and hemp, beetroot,
olives, hops, tobacco, mustard, opium, liquorice, and cotton.
After what has appeared in the narrative it would be unnecessary at this point to
Children's Hospital, Adelaide
refer at any length to pastoral pursuits. The fine pastures and the high-class breeds of
sheep in themselves are more valuable than many fabulously wealthy gold mines. There
is, however, much to be done in the breeding of horses and cattle, and in these departments
conditions are favorable for extensive developments.
South Australia is the only part of the continent that has never had the stimulus
of extensive gold diggings. Numerous auriferous deposits have been discovered, but no
rich gold mines have been developed. It has been proved that many kinds of minerals
and precious stones exist in South Australia, and both geologists and mining experts agree
that they will yet amply repay energy and enterprise in their search.

The land that slumbered in 1836 is in 1900 the home of an industrious,
energetic, and intelligent people, who have much to be proud of in their past, and every
right to cherish confident anticipations of great and growing prosperity in the future.
A city that bears the name of an English queen, has that of “ King William ’’
for its principal street, and of “Victoria” for its central square, with a statue of Her
Majesty in the heart of it, should be exceptionally loyal, and the citizens of Adelaide have
often displayed this distinguishing characteristic, but never more strikingly than at the
close of 1899 and the beginning of 1900. The war in South Africa afforded an opportunity
of showdng that their’s was no mere lip-loyalty. In common with other colonies, South
Australia promptly offered to assist in fighting the battles of the Queen, and the acceptance
of the offer was greeted with the utmost satisfaction. Successive contingents were selected
from large numbers of applicants, equipped and dispatched without loss ol time, and in
each case their departure was accompanied by a tremendous outburst of public feeling.
By an undesigned co-incidence, the second contingent, consisting of mounted men, left on
the anniversary of the first landing at Port jackson in 1788, and the day was observed as
a general holiday. Through streets gay with bunting, and densely packed with greater
masses of people than were ever seen in Adelaide before, the citizen soldiers and their
escort made their way to the Port, where a corresponding reception awaited them. Their
progress was amid a continuous roar of cheering that often drowned the music of the
bands, an altogether unprecedented enthusiasm, which demonstrated the breadth and
intelligence of the patriotic spirit that prevailed. In what was only the other day a mere
outpost of civilisation, the P'ederal movement has shown the evolution of a true sense of
nationhood, and the South African war elicited the tangible expression of a noble
readiness to make what sacrifices were required in order to maintain the integrity of the
Empire.

Right Hon. Sir Samuel J. Way, Bart.,
Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Justice.


The Right Hon. Sir Samuel James Way, Bart., P.C., D.C.L., LL.D.
Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Justice of South Australia , Chancellor of the University of
Adelaide , Australasian Representative on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
ABOVE is the name and description of one who has often been designated by the
local Press as “the most distinguished citizen of South Australia." He was born
on April ii, 1836. Although claiming, as his father’s son, to be a Devonshire man,
the birthplace of the future Chief [ustice was Portsmouth, in Hampshire the circuit in the
Bible Christian Connexion of which his father, the Rev. James Way, was then superintendent.
In 1850 Mr. Way, who was a man of mark in his denomination, came to South
Australia with the mission of establishing Bible Christian Societies in the southern world.
His elder son, who had previously spent two years at the denominational Grammar School
at Shebbear, near Bideford, was left in England under the educational care of the Rev.
Joseph Calrow Means, a distinguished Unitarian minister of high literary and scholarly
attainments, whose success as a headmaster had gained for the Maidstone Road School at
Chatham a far-extended reputation.
On February 27, 1853, young Way landed in Melbourne ; and on March 6 joined
his family in Adelaide. The calling to be selected occasioned a good deal of anxiety to
the young colonist, who was just under 17 years of age. Binding that he could qualify
for the legal profession in the Province, he entered the office of the late Mr. (afterwards
the Hon.) John Tuthill Bagot. After a few months’ experience, during which his taste
for legal studies became quite apparent, he transferred himself to the much larger office of
the late Mr. Alfred Atkinson, to whom he was articled in 1856. On March 23, 1861, he
was admitted to the Bar ; and shortly afterwards, on the death of Mr. Atkinson, he
became the head of the office which he had entered exactly seven years before.
These were the days of great opportunities, and it was not long before the
young lawyer’s qualifications as an advocate attracted attention. His connection with
the Moonta case hastened his advancement. Although the result of the litigation was
finally unfavorable to his clients, the value of the property in dispute and the nature
of the case excited much public interest, and the research and dialectic skill which he
displayed soon won for him “the ear of the Court,” whilst his earnestness and
declamatory power made him equally effective with juries. He found himself pitted
against, or the junior of, the late Mr. Ingleby, Mr. Fenn, Mr. T. B. Bruce, Mr. R. B.
(afterwards Mr. )ustice) Andrews, and Mr. (now Sir) J. P. Boucaut — all lawyers of marked
ability —and especially of the late Mr. Stow, the then leader of the Bar, whose forensic
gifts have never been surpassed in Australia and would have gained distinction in any
part of the world. Mr. Way soon divided with Mr. Stow the leading business at the
Bar, and there were few cases of any magnitude in v/hich they were not either engaged
on the same side or on opposite sides.
In these early years the proceedings of the law courts were reported at much
greater length than is possible now, and Mr. Way has often said that he was greatly
indebted to'’ the admirable reports of his addresses and arguments, which were contributed
to the Register by Mr. J. H. Finlayson, for the public attention which his forensic efforts
commanded. It was a great advantage also to have the co-operation of his friend and
partner, the late Mr. James Brook. Besides managing the general business of the office,
that o-entleman “ devilled ” most industriously for his partner, who confined his attention
V


exclusively to barrister’s work. When on circuit at Mount Gambier, in 1868, the ability of
Mr. (now Sir Josiah) Symon, who was then a clerk with his cousin, Mr. J. J). Sutherland,
a local solicitor, attracted Mr. Way’s notice, and he invited him to complete his articles in
his office. On Mr. Brook’s death in 1872 Mr. Way admitted Mr. Symon into the firm,
and he succeeded to the entire business on Mr. \\ ay’s elevation to the Bench less than
four years afterwards. The Right Hon. C. C. Kingston, K.C., was another pupil of
Mr. Way who exhibited great promise, and so also were Mr. I . B. Gall and others who
afterwards became leading Adelaide lawyers.
In 1869 Mr. Way took a trip to England to recruit from the effects of overwork.
During this visit he appeared twice before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, of
which he was afterwards to become a member. He was entertained at Gloucester by
the members of the Oxford Circuit, and he was fortunate enough to hear most of the trial
and the celebrated charge of Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in the Overend Gurney case.
In September, 1871, Mr. Way was appointed a Queen’s Counsel. He was
frequently urged to enter Parliament, but he steadfastly refused until he regarded himself
as independent of his profession. At the General Election in 1875 Air. Way, who
had received requisitions from six other constituencies, was returned to the Assembly
on February 10 for the District of Sturt. In the debate on the address in reply which
Mr. Way had moved, the Blyth Ministry was defeated. Mr. Townsend, the mover of
the amendment, having failed in forming a Ministry, Mr. (now Sir James) Boucaut was
sent for, and succeeded in the task. Air. Way accepted the Attorney-Generalship in
this administration, which was sworn in on June 3. Air. Boucaut’s policy included a
comprehensive scheme of railway extension and other great public works, as well as the
necessary taxation to pay interest on the loans which had to be raised to meet the great
expenditure. It also included a system of primary education. This “bold and comprehensive
policy,’’ as it was called, commanded the support of the House of Assembly and of the
country. The Legislative Council temporarily defeated the Ministry’s proposals by rejecting
a stamp tax, which was an instalment of the taxation required, and threw it out a second
time, in a special session convened to give them another opportunity of passing it. During
these two sessions Air. Way established his reputation as a ready and effective debater;
but his Parliamentary career came to an abrupt termination in the following recess.
Sir Richard Hanson, the then Chief Justice, died suddenly on March 10, 1876.
The Premier and his colleagues invited the Attorney-General to become his successor.
The opportunity was in some aspects a tempting one which might never occur again. On
the other hand the salary attached to the office was only a third of Air. Way’s professional
income, whilst he had the prospect of still further distinction both in Parliament and at
the Bar. On the advice of his friends Mr. Way determined to accent the vacant office,
J A ‘
and on Alarch 18 he was appointed Chief Justice. His advancement had been remarkably
rapid. He was a few weeks under 40 years of age and he had been five days less than
15 years at the Bar. With the exception of Sir Hy. de Villiers, the Chief justice of
Cape Colony (afterwards his colleague on the Judicial Committee), Mr. Way was probably
the youngest Chief Justice in Her Majesty’s dominions. He is now the senior judge in
Australia, and few Judges in an)' part of the Empire have had a longer term of judicial
service. He took his seat on the Bench for the first time on Monday, March 27. His
father preached his farewell sermon as a stated Minister on the previous day. On Alav 18
the newly-appointed Chief Justice had the honor of presiding at a public breakfast in' the
Town Hall in celebration of his father’s Alinisterial jubilee, which was attended by about
400 guests, including the Premier and many other leading colonists.
“At the present moment,” said the Register on the day on which the Chief
Justice’s appointment was announced, “ Mr. Way is the natural leader as well as the mere


ex-ojfew leader of the South Australian Bar. He has earned this proud position by sheer
hard work and thorough devotion to his calling. He has recognised the old adage that
1 . B o o , O I T
the law is a jealous mistress and will brook no divided or half-hearted fealty. He is
generally looked upon as a thoroughly shrewd lawyer, well versed in the science of his
profession, rapidly seizing the point of an argument, acute in discriminating between what
is material and what is purely accidental, prompt to detect a sophistry, and far more apt
to be swayed by principles than technicalities. In a word, he has many of the qualities that
go to make an excellent judge.”
A quarter of a century has passed, and the Chief Justice’s judicial career has
not only justified the most sanguine expectations when he was appointed, and upheld
the prestige of his high office, but his reputation as a lawyer and a jurist has been
established all over Australia and is recognised in England and America. “It is,” said an
article on “The Supreme Court Bench of South Australia,’ in the Australian Review
of Reviews lor 1895, “the justifiable boast of South Australians that they possess
a judicial Bench which, both on the intellectual and the moral sides, worthily maintains
the high standard which the British judiciary has given the world, and that in Chief
Justice Way they have one of the ablest judges in Her Majesty’s dominions. Ihe
qualities which have so rapidly advanced Mr. Way may be summed up in five words
-clearness of vision, courage, capability. To the man who has these comes opportunity.
Mr. Way is first and foremost a lawyer. This he regards as the great business of his
life, and to this the varied spheres of his marvellous activity are subordinated.” According
to a writer in the “ Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation,” in December,
1899, the Chief Justice brought to the Bench “all the qualities of a sound and learned
lawyer, added to industry that never flagged and patience that was inexhaustible. As
Chief Justice of the Colony, Sir Samuel Way has gone on steadily from year to year
increasing his reputation, and he is now acknowledged to be one of the ablest constitutional
lawyers in the colonies.”
Simplicity of procedure and despatch are the ideals he has set before himself in
the administration of justice. In view of the former he was largely instrumental in procuring
the re-enactment in South Australia in 1878 of the English Judicature Acts, and he actively
supervised the rules of procedure, which have gone further than the English rules, in
preventing delay and in securing prompt relief. His judgments are rarely reserved, and
are almost invariably unwritten, or aided only by brief notes. He has also been a
strong advocate of the extension of the Circuit Court system. Owing to his efforts the
Northern Circuit Courts were established in 1881. He held the first ol these Courts, and
complimentary banquets were given him on the occasions at Port Augusta and Gladstone.
The Dormant Commission to administer the Government in the absence of the
Governor has, in South Australia, since the withdrawal of the Imperial troops in 1870,
always been addressed to the Chief Justice, and, in his absence, to the other Judges, in
order of seniority. In less than a year after Mr. Way’s elevation to the Bench, his
Dormant Commission became active. Either as Administrator or Lieutenant-Governor, Sir
Samuel has administered the Government of the Province eight times, as follows
January 29 to March 24, 1877: May 17 to October 24, 1877 ; February 14 to August 15,
1878 ; January 9 to February 19, 1883: March 5 to April 11, 1889: November 3, 1893,
to May 19. 1894; January 17 to October 29, 1895; and September 29, 1898, to April 10,
1899 (inclusive). He has also frequently acted as Deputy-Governor during the absences of
successive Governors for less than a month. Probably there is no one else in colonial
history who has opened a session of, and dissolved, the Parliament of which he was a
member.
Mr. Way’s Acting Governorships have met with the approval of successive


Secretaries ol State for the Colonies and ol his fellow-colonists. Some years ago it was
proposed that in the interests ol economy Mr. Way should continue to lill both the vdceregal
and judicial offices permanently, or at least lew a long and indefinite term. This proposal
was strongly disapproved by him as both unconstitutional and as tending to weaken the
connection between the Province and the Mother Country, and it was at length quietly
abandoned.
1 he Chief Justice has always been ready to employ his time and his energies for
the benefit of the public without limiting himself strictly to his judicial and occasional
gubernatorial duties. From April, 1881, until June, 1883, he performed the duties of
Commissioner ol the Court ol Insolvency. This task, which added at least one working
day a week to his other occupations, was undertaken voluntarily and without salary, after it
had been declined by his colleagues, in order to enable the Government of the day to
give effect to its policy of transferring the business of the Court ol Insolvency to the
Supreme Court, and he only relinquished it when he found that it occasioned a strain
upon his energies which was injuring his health.
In 1877 he presided over and drafted the report of a Royal Commission on
I ribunals of Commerce, the sittings ol which lasted over six months. In 1883 he accepted
the Presidency of a Commission to enquire into the administration of the Destitute Acts
and Regulations, which was appointed chiefly because of the constantly reiterated complaints,
in the Press, and at excited public meetings of Roman Catholics, with respect to the
management by the Destitute Department of the Industrial and Reformatory Schools and
of the Boarding-out system. Phis appointment was pressed upon Mr. Way by the
Government, the Roman Catholic Bishop, and the members of the Destitute Board, and
reluctantly accepted by him, because no other chairman could be obtained who would
command the confidence alike of the Catholics and of the general public. The sittings of
the Commission lasted two years and a half. In the prosecution of his enquiries the Chief
Justice \ isited New South Wales and \ ictoria at his own expense, frequently worked 12
and 14 hours a day, and for more than six months relinquished all social engagements and
recreation of every kind. The final report which he drafted is one of the most elaborate
State papers ever presented to the local Parliament, and, besides finally settling the
controversy between the Department and the Roman Catholics to the satisfaction of both
disputants, was acknowledged both in the colonies and in England as a valuable and
permanent contribution to the literature of the subjects with which it dealt.
t
But the Chief Justice in his zeal lor the public good has gone far beyond these
quasi-official services. k ‘ Ever since His Honor’s promotion to his present high position,”
/ ahan I\ c <s> isle / in 1897, “he has occupied a unique position. While
bringing to the discharge of his judicial responsibilities the best qualities of the most
capable judges that have adorned the Bench in this or any other British community, he
has laid himself out with untiring assiduity to fulfil such of the duties of citizenship as
were not incompatible with his obligations as Chief Justice. He has been foremost in all
matters affecting the intellectual, the aesthetic, and the social interests of the Province.
He has taken the lead in all charitable movements, and the princely way in which he
has dispensed his hospitalities, particularly to visiting strangers, has been influential in
giving South Australia a good name in places far beyond its boundaries.”
The Chief Justice was elected President of the Acclimatisation Society at its
first meeting on July 25, 1878, and he continued to hold that office for four years. He
then vacated the presidency in favor of the late Sir Thomas Elder, though he has
continued to be a \ ice-President. He was chiefly instrumental, in spite of the opposition
of the Botanic Board, in securing for the society the admirable site now occupied by
the beautiful Zoological Gardens. 1 ;


Me has been President ot the Gardeners’ Society since the death of its first
President, the late Mr. Rupert Ingleby, 0.C., in 1881. for many years the speeches of the
Chief Justice on gardening topics were the special feature of the annual dinners of this
society. Since August, 1893, he has been a member of the Botanic Garden Board. Although
his early predilections tor a quiet country life were not to be gratified he has always
taken a keen interest in country pursuits. For more than 20 years he has been a
sheepbreeder at Kadlunga, his beautiful estate near Mintaro, and he also has a smaller
farm at Sea \ near Noarlunga. In 1889 he was, through the advice of his manager.
Mr. Weston, the first to introduce into Australia the improved Shropshire sheep a breed
which has since become so popular.
Ihe Adelaide Children s Hospital is the; charity of all others with which the
Chief Justice’s name and that of his brother-in-law, the late Hon. Dr, Campbell, as well
as Mi. John Howard Angas and the late Lady Colton s, will always be inseparably associated.
I he Chief Justice was the principal speaker at the meeting at the Town Hall when the
establishment of the hospital was determined upon. He laid the foundation-stone of the
building, as Acting-Governor, on June 20, 1878, and he has been the President of
the institution from its commencement. In 1897, in recognition of his long services, the
original structure was named the “ Way Building.”
J o
On May 17. 1880, Mr. Way was elected a member of the Board of Governors
of the South Australian Institute, and he has continued to be a member of the Board,
under its new constitution and title of the Public Library, Museum, and Art Galler\, in
1884. Since November 17, 1893, he has been President of the Institution. During his
Presidency the new Museum was opened on January 12, 1895, and the new Art Gallery
on April 7, 1890. He has also been President of the affiliated South Australian Society
of Arts since its rehabilitation in 1892.
Probably the Chief Justice’s greatest public services, outside his judicial duties,
have been in the cause of education and to the University. His first public appointment
was as a member of the old Board of Education, in 1874. The Education Act of 187 s
(which is still the principal Act of the primary school system of the Province) was
drafted by Mr. Boucaut, the Premier, and settled by Mr. Way, as Attorney-General,
who had the task of taking the Bill through committee its second reading having been
carried after an eloquent speech by the Hon. E. Ward, the Minister of Education. Mr.
Way had discerned the great capacity of the late Mr. J. A. Hartley as an educationist and
in administrative business, and, on his recommendation, Mr. Hartley was appointed the
permanent head of the new Education Department, with the title and office of President
of the Council of Education. In later years the Chief Justice took a keen interest in
urging upon the Government the acceptance of the offer of the University to make a free
attendance at the University lectures a part of the training of the public school teachers.
In 1883 he had been successful in inducing the legal profession and the Judges to raise
the standard of legal education by making attendance on the law lectures at the University
compulsory on students qualifying for legal practice.
Mr. Way was a member of the University Association formed in 1872 to take
advantage of the offers of ,£20,000 each by Sir Walter Watson Hughes and Sir Thomas Elder
towards the endowment of a local University. On the passing of the University Act in
1874 Mr. Way was appointed a member of the first University Council. On the election of
the Right Rev. Dr. Short as Chancellor, the Chief Justice, on April 26. 1876, was elected
Vice-Chancellor, and after the Bishop’s resignation the Chief Justice, on January 26, 1883,
became Chancellor, an office which he still holds.
In recognition of his academic as well as judicial services, the University of

The Chief Justice is an influential Methodist. Por many years he was closely
identified with the Bible Christian Denomination, in which he was born, and he attended
its English Conferences in 1869, 1891, and 1897. In 1891 he was one of the Bible Christian
representatives at the Methodist (Ecumenical Conference at Washington, in America. Before
leaving England tor America he endowed the Bible Christian College at Shebbear with
Lake Farm, an estate worth on which the first Bible Christian Society was formed
in 1815, and which he had purchased on account of its denominational associations. In
1897 he visited and addressed the Wesleyan Methodist, Primitive Methodist, and Bible
Christian Conferences at Leeds, Birmingham, and Exeter. So long ago as 1869 he advocated
Methodist Union at the Bible Christian Conference at Bristol, and he took an active part
in the movement when it assumed practical shape in Australia. In the winter of 1895 a series
of great meetings was held in each of the Australian capitals, in order to bring the question
before the Methodist people of all four denominations into which they were divided. Mr
Way, who was then administering the Government of South Australia, presided at the meetings
in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide, and also at Goulburn, in New South Wales. The
movement never lost the impetus it then received. The union has since been accomplished
in Queensland, in South Australia, in Western Australia, and (except as to the Primitive
Methodists) in New Zealand ; and it has been arranged that the union shall be consummated
in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania on January 1, 1902, when the United Church
will be known as “ The Methodist Church of Australasia.”
d'he Chief Justice is an equally prominent Freemason, and his advocacy of
Methodist Union was anticipated by similar services for the union of Australian Masonry.
He was installed as first Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of South Australia,
on April 17, 1884. Largely owing to the representations he made to Lord Carnarvon
on his visit to Australia in 1887, and through him to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, the
English, Irish, and Scottish Grand Lodges entered into fraternal relations with the South
Australian Grand Lodge. This was followed by the union of the Craft in New South Wales,
Victoria, and Tasmania, and subsequently in New Zealand and Western Australia.
Mr. Way installed Lord Carrington as Grand Master of New South Wales on September 18,
1888, in the presence of 4,000 Freemasons. In 1889 he assisted His Lordship at the
installation of Sir William Clarke as Grand Master of Victoria, and of the Rev. Paulet Harris
as Grand Master of Tasmania. In the same year he resigned the Grand Mastership of South
Australia in favor of the Earl of Kintore, who, besides being himself a distinguished Freemason,
was a collateral descendant of the Earl of Kintore who was successively Grand Master of
Scotland and of England in the first half of the eighteenth century. After Lord Kin tore’s
return to England in April, 1895, the Chief Justice was again elected Grand Master, a position
which he still holds. In 1891 he assisted H.R.H. the late Duke of Clarence to instal Lord
Carrington as Provincial Grand Master pf Buckinghamshire. At the great Masonic gathering

Queensland Largely through the influence of Mr. Kingston (Premier of South Australia),
the four other Australian colonies and New Zealand agreed to nominate Chief Justice
at wo 1a January, 1897, he was appointed by the Imperial Government. The late
Mr. \\ h. Dailey was the first, Sir Alfred Stephen was the second, and Mr. Way was the
lld Australian I nv y Councill ° r . He arrived in London on April 23, was sworn of
Her Majesty s I nvy Council on May 18, and took his seat on the Judicial Committee
on the following day, _ being the first colonial Judge to sit on that Board. The Chief
Justice joined in hearing appeals from India, South Africa, Jamaica, Ceylon, Victoria
Aew South Wales Canada, and the Consular Court at Shanghai. During this visit to
England he presided at the South Australian banquet on May 29, which, out of compliment
to himself, was attended by the Lord Chancellor (Lord Halsbury), by the Lord Chief
Justice (the late Lord Russell of Killowen), by Lord fames of Hereford, and by Earl
Jersey and Earl Carrington (two ex-Governors of New South Wales). He was also
entertained by the Lord Chief Justice; by the Honorable Societies of Lincoln’s Inn the
nner and Middle I emple, and Gray’s Inn ; and by the benchers and members of the King’s
nn in Dublin, at the banquet by the Irish Bar to celebrate Her Majesty’s Diamond
Jubilee.
* he appointment to the Judicial Committee carries with it no emoluments,
and Mr. Ways journey to England was made at his own charges. Whilst absent also
at his own instance, he drew only half salary as Chief Justice, At order to provide’ for a
locum . tennis on the Supreme Court Bench. The Chief Justice has not since resumed his
attendance on the Judicial Committee, as no provision has yet been made for payment of
his travelling and other expenses, which have been provided for in the case of the
representatives from Canada and South Africa.
In 1879 and several subsequent years the Chief Justice was offered, but asked to

of Lieutenant-Governor —the first occasion on which it was bestowed on a Clue Justice
before his retirement. In the Birthday list for 1899 Mr. Way received a baronetc) tie
fourth which has been conferred in Australia, and the first in South Austialia.
Until 1898 the Chief Justice remained a bachelor. On his birthday in that year
he was married to Katherine Gollan, widow of the late Dr. Blue. Ihe maniage
is a happy one Lady Way having identified herself with her husband s social and
philanthropic pursuits. During his last administration of the Government in 1899 the Chief
Justice had a dangerous illness, his recovery from which occasioned unmistakable lejoicings
J o
by all classes of his fellow-citizens.
f rom his first entry into public life Sir Samuel Way consistently advocated
the federation of Australia and the maintenance and strengthening of the ties between England
and her Colonies. His judicial office, however, disqualified him from becoming a member
of the Convention by which the Constitution of the Commonwealth was framed. He did
not fail, when the time came, to protest against any limitation of the right of appeal
to the Sovereign in Council, which is so prized by the great majority of Austialian
citizens, and which is so essential to the connection with the Mother Country. Ihe
controversy as to Clause 74 of the Commonwealth Bill is not yet forgotten. Ihe
arguments which the Chief Justice advanced greatly helped the rejection of the clause as
originally framed and in bringing about the final compromise by which the right of
appeal from the State Courts is left untouched, and is only limited from the High
Court on questions with respect to the jurisdiction of the States and Commonwealth
inter se. At the inauguration of the Commonwealth in Sydney on January 1, 1901. Sir
Samuel was present as Lieutenant-Governor of the State of South Australia, and he was
a guest of the State of Victoria at the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament in
Melbourne in May, 1901.

A C.M.G., received his education first at a private school, then by private tuition, and
subsequently at King Edward VI. Grammar School, Bath. Prior to coming to
South Australia, he followed pastoral pursuits in New Zealand, and participated in the
Maori War, receiving a medal for military services. In October, 1864, he was appointed
Librarian to the South Australian Parliament; in December, 186 c, Clerk Assistant of House
of Assembly ; in May, 1883, Clerk ; and in May, 1887, Clerk of the Legislative Council and
gazetted Clerk of the Parliaments. On January 1, 1901, he was made a C.M.G., and on
April 3, 1901. appointed Clerk of Parliaments to the Commonwealth Parliament. He
was also Clerk of the Australasian Federal Conventions at Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne
in 1897-8, as well as Clerk of the Constitutional Committee which drafted the Australian
Commonwealth Bill. He is recognised in Australasia and England as one of the world’s
authorities on Constitutional Law, and has contributed largely to the complete interpretation
of the written and unwritten laws governing Parliamentary procedure. Ihe following are the
works he has issued : —“ The Decisions of Mr. Speaker Denison, 1857-1872,” “I he Decisions
of Mr. Speaker Brand, 1872-1884,” “ The Decisions of Mr. Speaker Peel, 1884-1900, “ Ihe
Practice and Procedure of the Legislative Council,” “ The Practice and Procedure of the House
of Assembly,” and “ The Law of the Constitution of South Australia.” Ihe value ot these
treatises has been recognised by the Speakers and Chairmen of Committees of the Imperial
Parliament, as well as by Sir Erskine May, a world-renowned constitutionalist, whilst the
Times and other leading newspapers have favorably criticised his works.

Hon. F. W. Holder, M.P, Premier and Treasurer
THE latter half of the decade ended in 1890 brought out of comparative obscurity
three men who have pregnantly impressed public thought in South Australia,
namely : -Messrs. Gordon, Cockburn, and Holder; and it is a co-incidence that
the politics of all three are almost identical, also that each has been a member of the
same three Cabinets. The present
is the fourth occasion that Mr.
Holder has been Treasurer ; and
no one, probably, has more dis-
tinguished himself in such a
department in Australia. When
he took over the portfolio in
1894, upon the appointment of
Mr. Playford as Agent-General,
J O ’
it was conceded by both sides of
J
the House of Assembly that South
Australia would gain, “ both in
London and in Adelaide, by these
changes.” On that occasion the
Australian editor of the Review
of Reviews , in referring to Mr.
Holder, said : “He is rich in
saving common-sense, has a most
intimate knowledge of the con-
ditions and needs of the Colony,
and is universally respected for
his uprightness.”
Frederick William Holder was
born at Happy Valley, South
Australia, on May 12, 1850, and
is the son of James Morecott
Holder. In his school days he
showed some inclination for the
teaching profession, and eventually accepted a position under the South Australian State
Schools Department. After filling several scholastic appointments, he was transferred to the
Burra, where he later began his public career. His abilities fitted him for positions of
wider scope than teaching, and after some time he resigned from the department. If at
this time he had any ambition for public life, he could not have chosen a more suitable and
appropriate training ground than that he now entered. The country press is a useful lever,
and Mr. Holder became proprietor and editor of the Burra Record. He gave life and
strength to that organ ; and, as it circulated through a large district, he became well


known, and, because of the hardiness of his views, respected. As a journalist Mr. Holder
vas much above the average of country editors. Possessed of a ready flow of language,
of clear discernment, and of analytical power, his abilities were not confined to country
journalism. I hen and afterwards he became a contributor to the leading columns of
the Adelaide dailies, and a writer of special articles for English newspapers. The
productions of his pen were promptly accepted, and it is certain that had he continued
in this sphere he would have become a leading Australian journalist.
While associated with the Burra Record\ Mr. Holder took another useful step
towards public life. He interested himself in municipal matters, and was elected to the
Burra Council. Not long afterwards he became Mayor, a position which he occupied for
two years. He was able to do good work for the town, and to initiate many improve-
ments. He infused some of his own strenuous spirit into the Council, was painstaking,
and was a municipal reformer. His reputation in the district rose by degrees, and he was
gazetted a Justice of the 1 eace. He principally devoted himself, however, to religious
work : and as a lay preacher in the Wesleyan Church delivered many thoughtful sermons;
and though he now holds the highest position in the land, he still, upon occasion, occupies
the pulpit in metropolitan and country churches.
When in 1887 Mr. Holder offered himself to the suffrage of the Burra electorate
for a seat in the House of Assembly, his advent was hailed with pleasure. The Burra
district, embracing such large country towns as Burra and Jamestown, and an extensive
farming and pastoral territory, has been the favored constituency of several leading South
Australian politicians, some of whom were non-residents there. It was known that
Mr. Holder had a close acquaintance with the country and the wants of the population ;
and as his addresses were always intelligent, and he was considered to be a man of
superior talent, he was returned first on the poll. His political career has since been so
distinguished, that his seat is now recognised as probably the safest in the Assembly. At
any rate - the electors have from time to time expressed their confidence in his worth bv
returning him by overwhelming majorities at each subsequent election. And this reputation
has been attained by high ability in State service rather than by log-rolling or the fulsome
promises of the “roads and bridges” politician. Few local politicians have travelled more
widely In South Australia, whether in the desolate interior or the remote South-East
Immediately after entering the House, Mr. Holder demonstrated that he was a
man of promise. H,s utterances were well thought out, concise, and polished. As a
debater, he is fluent ; and it might even be said that he is in the forefront of Australian
debaters. He was always a rapid speaker, who halted as little in a budget speech
weighted with many figures, as upon some abstract theme. Besides being a thinker he
is a student, well read on every subject that ordinarily comes within the cognisance of
the House. In his first two sessions of Parliament, Mr. Holder had already made his
mark, and was looked upon as a likely man for Ministerial office. This came at what was
practically the first opportunity. In June, 1889, Dr. Cockburn carried a vote of wLnt of
confidence m the Playford Government. He formed a Cabinet, which took office on the
2/1,1 of the same month, with Mr. Holder as Treasurer. The latter applied himself to


master the intricacies of State finance with a will, and quickly got hold of the subject.
Perhaps South Australia does not possess a more thorough, hardworking administrator,
and it was seen by legislators that Mr. Holder had a firm grip on his department.
Ihe difficulties of others were to him matters of easy mastery. His first budget
speech attracted no little attention for its conciseness and lucidity, and also for its
eloquence the last an unusual feature in such a connection. Touching upon the various
and complicated questions with rapidity, he delivered the whole address almost without
consulting a single note, even when dealing with large figures.
o ’ O O
The Cockburn Government remained in office from June 27, 1889, to August
19. 1890, and no member of it gained such a reputation as Mr. Holder not even the
brilliant leader himself. While the succeeding Playford Government occupied the Treasury
benches from August, 1890, to June, 1892, Mr. Holder took an active part in the
Opposition, and was eventually appointed Leader. He was also fully occupied in journalistic
work, and on Royal Commissions and Select Committees. In these latter branches of
political work he evinced great competency. During his first session in Parliament in
1887, he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on the Land Laws, a subject
in which he is as much at home as in finance. In 1888 he was a member of the Select
Committee on the Star of Greece shipwreck disaster, and chairman of the Barrier I rade
Select Committee. In 1890 he was chairman of the Royal Commission on Intercolonial
free Trade, and was a member of the Mails Commission. In 1891 he was appointed
to the Pastoral Lands Royal Commission, and in 1892 to the Orroroo Railway Commission.
In taking evidence on these Commissions, he travelled over a large tract of territory, and
on behalf of the Pastoral Lands Commission penetrated into the interior. He was thus
seldom disengaged. As Leader of the Opposition he defeated the Playtord Ministry
in June, 1892, and on the 21st of the month took office as Premier and 1 reasurer. His
colleagues were Dr. (. A. Cockburn (Chief Secretary), Mr. W. P. Stock (Attorney-General),
the late Mr. P. P. Gillen (Commissioner of Crown Lands), Mr. A. I). Handyside
(Commissioner of Public Works), and the Hon. J. H. Gordon, M.L.C. (Minister of
Education). The state of parties at this time was particularly unstable, and the Holder
Government had a short and uncomfortable period of office. On the 15th October
following, Sir John Downer became Premier, and Mr. Holder was once more in opposition
A coalition of two parties was soon formed, and on Parliament assembling in
1893, Mr. Kingston carried a vote of want of confidence, and on June 16 assumed office,
with Mr. Holder as Commissioner of Public Works. In April, 1894, however, Mr.
Playford, the Treasurer, was appointed Agent-General, and Mr. Holder returned to his
old department. The Kingston-Holder Cabinet continued in office until November 30,
1899, thus far outrunning the record span of South Australian Governments. During
the successive years of drought and depression which marked the term of this Ministry,
the Treasurer managed the finances in such a manner as to win the praise and confidence
of every side of the House ; and during this period made some useful innovations in the
Treasury Department, while the thoroughness displayed in his first term of office has
been maintained ever since. To Mr. Holder’s initiation many of the reforms passed by
the Kingston Government are due ; and he has sponsored several important pieces of
legislation. Q 2


Active as he has always been in the local political arena, during the past four
years his reputation has attained intercolonial importance. Early in 1897 he was elected
second on the poll as a delegate tor South Australia to the Pederal Convention ; and at the
three sessions ot that gathering of great Australians, he distinguished himself by earnestness
and intelligence in debate, while his speeches on financial issues were weighty and keen. In
this latter respect he was one ot the most capable members of the Convention. 11 is views
were comprehensive, and showed so much depth, that they were listened to with general
respect. His judgment, knowledge, and clearness of vision will certainly be exceedingly
useful in the high position in the Commonwealth to which he is bound to attain. When
the Commonwealth Bill went before the electors of South Australia for their vote, he was
indefatigable in securing its acceptance. He was invited to visit almost every part of the
Province to explain its provisions, and was in the habit of delivering seven and eight
addresses a week in different districts. It is due to him, therefore, to record that he was
largely responsible for the preponderating vote in South Australia in favor of the Bill.
Returning to his record in the politics of the Province of which he is so
distinguished a native, it remains to be said that after the short-lived Solomon Ministry,
which held office from December 1 to 7* 1899, had been defeated, Mr. Holder succeeded
to the Premiership. And this position he still holds at the time of writing (September,
1900), apparently all the more securely for several futile attacks made upon his policy by
the Opposition on motions of censure. The current session has not been characterised
by sensational legislation ; but the maintenance of even and steady administration in the
executive branch of government, is no mean achievement for the Premier of an important
Province.
Perhaps there is no busier man in Adelaide than Mr. Holder. When not
officially engaged, he is working for his Church or studying in his library. Although a
modest man, he is certainly entitled to be reckoned among the most distinguished of
Australian Statesmen.
1 he late Sir John Morphett, Knt
THE late Sir John Morphett was born in London on May 4, 1809. He was the son
of Nathanael Morphett, solicitor. He arrived in South Australia in September,
1836, and was present at the proclamation ceremony on December 28 of the same
year. On March 6, 1838, Sir John was appointed a member of the Aborigines’ Protection
Board, and he served on this for many years. In December, 1840, he was appointed
I reasurer of the City Corporation. Ihe birth of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural
Society may be indirectly traced to a meeting over which Sir John Morphett presided on
April 27, 1844.
Sir John Morphett was one of the four non-official members of the Legislative
Council from 1843 to J BS T : a nominated non-official member and Speaker till 1854;
elected under the new Constitution Act in 1857, and retained his seat till 1873, having
been President from 1865. He was Chief Secretary in the Reynolds Ministries in iB6k
He was knighted in 1870. On his retirement from politics Sir John led a life of comparative
quiet, and died in November, 1892.

Right Hon. C. C. Kingston, P.C., Q.C., D.C.L., M.L.C.
H ARLES CAMERON KINGS lON was born in Adelaide on October 22, 1850.
Regarding his ancestry, it may be stated that his grandfather on the maternal
side was the late Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Cameron, of the 3rd Buffs, and formerly
of the 92nd Regiment, who served with distinction in the Peninsular and North American
Wars. Mr. Kingston’s father,
the late Sir George Strickland
Kingston, was one of the celebri-
ties of the Province. He arrived
on these shores with Colonel Light
in the ship Cygnet, some months
prior to the proclamation establish-
ing South Australia as a British
Province. Sir George Kingston
o o
was one of the discoverers of the
River Torrens ; and, next to
Colonel Light, was the founder of
Adelaide. He was the first white
man to set foot on the site of the
city. As Deputy Surveyor-
* J
General he assisted in the survey
J
of the city, and upon the retire-
ment of his chief he became
Surveyor - General. In 1839 he
held the post of Inspector of Public
Works, and in the next year was
appointed first Town Surveyor to
the Adelaide Corporation. Among
1 o
the elder Kingston’s greatest
services to the new Province was
the part he took in securing
a representative Parliament
and Responsible Government for
South Australia. He advocated
manhood suffrage for both Houses of the local Legislature. In 1851 he was elected to the
new Legislative Council, for the Burra District; and, upon the inauguration of Responsible
Government in 1857, he was unanimously selected as first Speaker to the Legislative
Assembly. Sir George Kingston filled that office for nearly 20 years with dignity and
tact, and his name finds an influential place in local history. He died at sea on November
26, 1881, whilst on a voyage to India, taken to benefit his health.
Mr. C. C. Kingston, the subject of this notice, was educated in Adelaide, at the


popular school of the late Mr. J. 1.. Young; and in March, 1868, was articled to Mr. S. J. Way
(now the Right Hon. Chief Justice Way), at that time a rising lawyer in the city. Admitted
to practice at the South Australian Bar in 1873, Mr. Kingston, after a period of uphill work,
made rapid headway in his profession, and “took silk” in 1889. His heart and time
have, however, always been so enthusiastically and entirely given to public affairs and the
legislative arena that his private practice has never attained to the extent that it would
otherwise have most certainly reached. With forensic talents admittedly of a very high
order, his principal and almost his only love has always been for politics.
In 1881 he took the first step in his political career by coming forward as a
candidate for the House of Assembly for West Adelaide. He was then 30 years old, and
untried in public affairs. But it was not long before it was clearly recognised that West
Adelaide had as its representative one of the ablest men in Australia, and until he
resigned his seat in 1899, he continuously represented that Democratic constituency.
In the House of Assembly Mr. Kingston’s light did not long remain hidden
under a bushel. Sir John Colton recognised his talents by selecting him as Attorney-
General in the Ministry which took office on June 16, 1884. For exactly 12 months he
carried out the duties of that post ; and during that time he amply fulfilled the expectations
formed of him. His legal skill, and his capacity for hard work, won general attention ;
and more than one member of Parliament prophesied that his career would be a
distinguished one. The Downer-Bray Ministry, which succeeded to the Colton administra-
tion, held office until June, 1887. Then the Hon. Thomas Playford was entrusted with
the forming of his first ministry. That prominent and popular politician has ever been
one of Mr. Kingston’s most constant admirers, and the latter does not disguise his
gratefulness for the assistance Mr. Playford has rendered him in his political career.
Under Mr. Playford, Mr. Kingston resumed his old portfolio, which he held for the
succeeding two years. During that period Mr. Kingston was referred to as the
“ Lieutenant of the Premier.” He also took a most important part in the debates, and
drafted most of the legislation of the Government.
While the succeeding Cockburn Government was in office, Mr. Kingston proved
the versatility of his powers as a debater. On the Treasury benches strong and confident,
in opposition he proved forcibly and fearlessly critical. For 12 months he was a sharp
thorn in the side of the Government. The Cockburn administration having fallen, and
Mr. Playford having again taken the reins of office, early in 1892 Mr. Kingston succeeded
the late Sir John Cox Bray (appointed Agent-General) in the Chief Secretaryship. But in
June of that year the Ministry was defeated. Exactly a year later a further change of
Government resulted in establishing Mr. Kingston as Premier, he having succeeded in
ejecting Sir John Downer from the Treasury benches. For years he had been looked
upon as a prospective Premier. A pronounced Democrat, his talents were so marked
that he was accepted as the champion of the advanced Liberals —and Liberalism was then
beginning to be unmistakably in the ascendant in South Australia.
Perhaps at no time in the history of South Australia has so talented, and even


brilliant, a combination held office as that which Air. Kingston at this time formed. It
included three ex-Premiers—Air. I. Playford, Mr. F. W. Holder, and Dr. J. A. Cockburn- as
well as two of the rising men of the day, the Hon. J. H. Gordon and the late Hon. P. P.
Gillen. I his Ministry was referred to as the “Cabinet of all the talents”; and as it was
in some respects a coalition of two parties, which, while of somewhat similar politics, had
hitherto been opposed to one another, it was accounted sure of a long life. The expectation
was more than fulfilled. Ihe Kingston Government held office longer than any previous
Ministry in South Australia. Ihe end did not come until December, 1899; and it is
not too much to say that although he then personally ceased to be a Minister and a member
of Parliament, the spirit of Mr. Kingston animated the Ministry formed by his able and
ti listed lieutenant, Air. Holder, a week later. Holding office for over six years, and firmly
established in the confidence of the people of South Australia, the Kingston-Holder
administration was enabled to give lull effect to its abounding legislative energy. This
energy manifested itself entirely in Democratic directions, resulting in legislation of
the highest importance and most far-reaching effect. Whatever position Air. Kingston may-
come to take in the higher sphere of Federal politics, it will never be forgotten in his own
Province of South Australia that he was the first to get the somewhat inclined-to-be-restless
Democratic team to go in harness together. He attached them to the political coach
and drove them straight ahead. While possessed, however, of no uncertain leaning
to Democratic views, Air. Kingston also proved himself a man of judgment and sense, who
was not likely to go too fast ; and this although he has made remarkable changes in South
Australian legislation, which will undoubtedly largely influence the future of the most
Democratic Province of the group of sister States on the Australian Continent.
Prominent in the long list of legislation standing to the credit of the Kingston-Holder
Government are measures providing for the extension of the franchise to women, the
establishment of a State Bank, the regulation of factories ; industrial conciliation ; a
progressive system of land and income taxation ; State-aid to producers ; liberalisation of
mineral, pastoral, and agricultural laws, and progressive land, income, and succession duties.
Owing to this outcrop of Democratic legislation, South Australia may now be said to possess
a code of progressive laws which attracts widespread attention, and the effects of which
are being keenly watched in various parts of the world. Air. Kingston is a determined
leader and indefatigable worker —phases of his character that explain much of his success
In intercolonial matters Air. Kingston has ever been an active figure. About twelve
years ago, at an Intercolonial Conference, he drafted the Bill relating to the restriction of
Chinese immigration ; while he has ever declared himself staunchly inimical to colored
immigration, and determined to fight tooth-and-nail to keep Australia for the white man. At
the P'ederal Council held in Hobart in 1889 he carried resolutions providing for the
extension of that institution. He was a South Australian representative at the National
Australian Convention held in Sydney in 1891 to frame a P'ederal Constitution ; on wlvch
his abilities as a draughtsman led to his appointment as one of three to assist Sir Samuel
Griffith in drawing up the first Australian Commonwealth Bill. Air. Kingston is an ardent
Federationist, and throughout the subsequent agitations, conferences, and conventions, has
ably represented his Province. With Sir George Turner, the Victorian Premier, he drafted
265
Right Hon. c. c. Kingston ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


the hederal Enabling Bill, on the basis of which the whole subsequent Federation procedure
was established. The matter being' urgent, he attended the Intercolonial Conference held
o o
in Sydney in 1896 to discuss the serious question of Asiatic immigration, when he advised
stringent precautionary measures to prevent or limit the influx of undesirable races. In 1897
the seven Premiers again met at Hobart, and decided on matters of intercolonial and Imperial
importance ; and shortly afterwards the second Federation Convention assembled at Adelaide.
I his important gathering was attended by representatives of all the Australasian Colonies
except Queensland and New Zealand. Mr. Kingston was chosen at the head of the poll
among South Australian delegates, and also had the eminent honor of being appointed
President of the Convention. This position he filled with dignity at the subsequent sessions
held in Sydney and Melbourne. Throughout the various sessions he cordially supported the
conciliatory spirit of fair compromise wherever the interests of South Australia conflicted
with those of sister colonies. In presenting the Commonwealth Bill passed by this Convention
to the electors of South Australia, he gave it a hearty support, and delivered numerous
addresses advocating and explaining its provisions, in this way largely influencing the
subsequent acceptance of the measure by the people.
It is generally admitted that, by his statesmanship, his unswerving advocacy, his
constitutional knowledge and his conciliatory spirit, Mr. Kingston has greatly assisted to
realise the aspirations ol Australian federation. As the South Australian delegate to
England to watch the passage of the Commonwealth Hill through the Imperial Parliament
in 1900, he ably co-operated with his colonial colleagues in securing the acceptance by the
British legislature of the measure in practically the identical shape in which it was passed
by the Australian Convention. Some hitches occurred during the consideration of the Bill
by the Home authorities : and at one time it seemed that the measure would be held
over owing to differences reported to exist in Australia in regard to a certain clause. But
the energetic insistence of the delegates won the day by impressing upon the Secretary of
State the wisdom and advisableness of meeting the wishes of Australia in their entirety.
On his return from England in August, 1900, after this mission, Mr. Kingston received a
most enthusiastic reception from all classes of his native city.
I his was not the first time that Mr. Kingston visited England in an official
capacity. As Premier of South Australia, he attended the celebration of the Queen’s
Diamond Jubilee in London in 1897, when, with his fellow premiers from the colonies,
he had the honor of being appointed to the Privy Council, and also had the honorary
degree of U.C.L. conferred upon him by the Universities of both Oxford and Cambridge.
But without regard to his well-earned titular honors, it is safe to say that Mr.
Kingston’s name will always be historically and honorably associated with that of his
native Province.
Mr. Kingston resigned his seat in the House of Assembly for West Adelaide in
rpoo, for the purpose of winning a seat in the Legislative Council in the interests of the
reform of that body. I his he succeeded in doing the same year, and he now sits in the
Upper House as a representative of the Central District.

Hon. Sir Richard Chaffey Baker, K.C.M.G., Q.C., M.A.,
hamster-at-law and President of the Legislative Council.
NO one occupies a higher place in the eyes of South Australians than Sir Richard
Chaffey Baker, and his biography is co-extensive with the growth of the historv
of the Province.
Sir Richard Baker, who is
the “Father of the South
Australian Legislative Council,”
was born at North Adelaide on
June 22, 1842, in the early years
of the Province’s history. He is
the son of the Hon. John Baker,
a politician and patriot, whose
yeoman’s services to the Legisla-
tive Council and the Province can
never be effaced from the memory
of contemporary settlers. There
is much in heredity, and perhaps
more in domestic principle and
example, which makes for pro-
ducing those desirable factors of
mind and character which con-
stitute a good citizen. Sir
Richard s father was a man
endeared to all by his distin-
guished ability, his unremitting'
J O
labors in the interest of
colonists, and his zeal for ad-
vancing general prosperity; who
was esteemed in his lifetime,
and honored and bewept on his
death. One of the Province’s
oldest pioneers, Mr. John Baker
arrived in Adelaide in 1838. He
was a scion of an old and well-known Somersetshire family the Bakers of South
Petherton, Ilminster, Yeovil, and the neighborhood. Pluck and dogged tenacity of purpose
were characteristic of the early settlers in South Australia. They had to rely on then-
energy and perseverance in encountering and for overcoming the immense difficulties which
surrounded them, and they could not, and would not, had they been able so to do, like
the effete and State-supported products of coddling legislation, rush to the Government for
aid and assistance in every difficulty. Among this self-reliant portion of a nation the


late Hon. John Baker was pre-eminent for his enterprise and public spirit. He was the
first Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and amongst the many other public offices
which he held, was for many years President of the Royal Agricultural Society, a
Director of the Botanic Gardens, and a member of the Savings Bank Board. He was
one of the founders, and chairman, of the Adelaide Club. He was also an ardent
supporter of sport, having been for many years the Chairman of the South Australian
Jockey Club. But perhaps the greatest debt of gratitude this Province owes to the
deceased gentleman is that when on the first establishment of the present form of
representative and responsible government a most serious and dangerous difficulty arose
on the very threshold of the proceedings between the two Houses of Parliament, the
Hon. John Baker formed a Government, replacing the officials (who had been, as a matter
of course, appointed the first advisers of His Excellency the Governor) by the first real
responsible Ministry of South Australia, in order to settle that difficulty. In this he
succeeded, and what is commonly called the “ Compact of 1857” has been ever since-
and still is. the modus vivendi between the two Houses on that ever-fruitful source of
misunderstandings and quarrels between two elected Legislative bodies all over the
world, viz., their relative powers and functions in reference to what are vaguely called
Money Bills. I his “ Compact ’ was an entirely novel development of political science
and practice, but it has worked well, and has now become part of the Constitution
of South Australia, and there are signs of its becoming a constitutional practice
throughout the British dominions. The great P'ederal Conventions of 1891 and 1897
both adopted the principle of this “Compact ” as part of the proposed Federal Constitution of
Australia, Sir Richard Baker cannot but be touched with feelings of pride in remembrance
of the notable career of his father. As Minister, as member, as citizen, the Hon. John
Baker fulfilled a mission useful in its objects, varied and comprehensive in its reach. This
reference to Sir Richard’s father may be in one sense digressional, but it demonstrates
the fibre and blood from which the son was born, and the heritage and example that
were bequeathed to him to follow and emulate. How far Sir Richard succeeded, and how
truthfully he caused the adage of “ A worthy son of a worthy sire ” to be applied to him, may
be gathered from the sequence of his life.
Sir Richard Baker received his early instruction at the famous English school of
J O
Eton. Passing through the curriculum of that classic institution, he proceeded to Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he chiefly distinguished himself as a first-class oarsman. ft
may here be mentioned that one of his principal friends, both at school and college, was
John Richard Selwyn, afterwards Bishop of Melanesia. Sir Richard took his B.A. degree
in 1864, and his M.A. in 1870.
Having decided to enter the legal profession, upon leaving the University Sir
Richard was called to the Bar at Lincoln’s Inn in June, 1864, and returned to Adelaide
in the same year. He started practice, at first in partnership with the late Charles Penn,
who at one time had the largest practice in Adelaide ; after the death of Mr. P'enn on
his own account, and subsequently in partnership with Dr. Barlow. But his ambition
was not bounded by the limits of his profession. The logic and training of law was to him
a school for the study of the principles of politics, and for the acquirement of those
qualifications which are serviceable in the higher walks of legislation.


On April 7, 1868, Sir Richard was returned to Parliament by the Barossa
Electorate lor the House ot Assembly at the head of the poll. His first essay augured
well and reflected ciedit on the able manner in which he prosecuted his campaign, as he
had for one of his opponents a Minister of the Crown, the late Hon. P. Santo. Opportunities
came to the new member, and they were grasped, and the House found that it had
to 1 eckon with one not only effective in debate, but strong and energetic in character.
Until 1871 Sir Richard continued as the representative of Barossa ; and during
that time he had for his colleague the late Hon. P. Santo, and afterwards the Hon.
W . Duffield. That his talent and energy were appreciated by his fellow' members in the
House of Assembly, is shown by the facts that shortly after his entrance into public life
he was offered by Mr. (now Sir J. P.) Boucaut a seat in the Strangways Ministry, This
honor he refused, and at the age of 29, having been a member for little over two years, he
was unanimously chosen to move a want of confidence motion in the Strangways Ministry'.
The motion was carried with perhaps the greatest relative majority on record in
similar cases, the Ministry having but one supporter when the division was taken. It is
a curious and perhaps unexampled coincidence that Sir Richard’s father, the Hon. John
Baker, also on the same day carried in the Legislative Council a vote of want of confidence
in the same Ministry. As a result of these motions, the late Hon. f. Hart was sent for
to form a Ministry, and in May, 1870, Sir Richard accepted the portfolio of Attorney-General
in the Hart Ministry. He held this Ministerial office for 14 months, and then the assumption
of the superintendence of his father’s business (who died in 1872, after a protracted illness)
necessitated his temporary withdrawal from so onerous a public post. On his retire-
ment the Register newspaper said: “ He assumed the post of Attorney-General when
he had been but a short time in public life, and when he had still much to learn ; but
we think the general verdict of the country will be that he has discharged his official
duties with energy and ability, and advanced himself in public estimation by
his administrative career.” The Premier, the Hon. John Hart, in an official letter, said
“that in expressing our entire satisfaction as a Cabinet with the ability and judgment with
which you have filled the office of Attorney-General, we are only stating what we feel
assured is also the general opinion of the public.” He was then offered the position of a
Queen’s Council, which, however, he did not accept till many years after.
On the dissolution of the House of Assembly by effluxion of time, Sir Richard
did not stand for re-election, private affairs requiring his undivided attention. When these
matters were adjusted, Sir Richard took a trip to England, taking with him authority to
represent South Australia tit the Vienna International Exhibition. Almost immediately
after his return, viz., in February, 1875, he, although not a member of Parliament, was
offered a seat in the then Cabinet by Sir Arthur Blyth (then Premier) as Minister of
Justice and Education. This honor wtis declined, as he has both before and subsequently
frequently declined offers to join various Governments.
In May, 1875, he offered himself for election to the House of Assembly for his
old constituency, Barossa ; but on this, and on this occasion only, he was unsuccessful in
his candidature
269
Hon. Sir R. C. Baker ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


In 1877, Sir Richard first stood as a candidate for the Legislative Council, for
which he was elected on April r, 1877. At that time, and up to 1884., the whole Province
of South Australia was one constituency so far as the Council was concerned. When in
1884, for the sake of convenience, the Province was divided into four electoral divisions
for the Legislative Council, Sir Richard chose as his constituency the Southern Division,
which he has ever since represented. In May, 1897, he was returned at the head of the
poll by the greatest number of votes ever obtained by any member of the Council since
the division of the Province into electoral districts, polling nearly 1,000 votes more
than the second, and nearly 2,000 more than the third candidate. Sir Richard’s present
term of membership does not expire until 1906.
When the Colton Government went into office in June, 1884, Sir Richard became
Minister of Education and leader of the Legislative Council, resigning, however, with
O ’ O o'
his colleagues in the following June.
It was while holding the office of Minister of Education that events shaped
their course to permit of Sir Richard’s obtaining a somewhat inadequate recognition by
the British Government of his services and position. Up to that date the system of the
division of the postage receipts and payment of the postal subsidies to steamship companies
between Great Britain and the Australian Colonies was of a most complicated and
unsatisfactory nature, based on no principles, and varying according to each particular
line of steamers carrying mail matter. Separate colonies, or groups of colonies, had made
separate arrangements with the P. & O. and Orient Steamship Companies, and with Great
Britain ; and in certain cases sub-arrangements had been made between colonies not parties
to the original contracts. I his complicated state of affairs rendered it exceedingly difficult
lor anyone to understand the position. Sir Richard grasped the situation, and having
been given a free hand, he entered into a contract with the Orient Company, and then
proceeded, in his capacity as Minister of Post and Telegraphs, to Sydney and Melbourne
to discuss with their respective Governments the whole question of a joint mail service
between Great Britain and the Australian Colonies, also of a simple and equitable division
between the colonies and Great Britain of the postages received at each end. He
succeeded in persuading the Governments of Victoria and New South Wales to accede to
his ideas, and drew up an agreement (which is in existence to this day, and is commonly
called the “ Baker Agreement ”), which was executed by the Governments of Victoria,
New South Whiles, and South Australia. The Governments of Western Australia and
Tasmania afterwards concurred. The Government of Queensland, although it never formally
executed the agreement, has adopted it by payment and practice. Although in June,
1885, the Colton Government went out of office, in recognition of his services the new
Government commissioned Sir Richard -(and in this commission the Governments of New
South Wales, Victoria, 1 asmania, and Western Australia concurred) —to proceed to England
as the accredited representative of the Australian Governments to negotiate a joint contract
with reference to the new mail tenders, and to win the adherence of the British Government
to the postal contract with the colonies which he had negotiated, as well as to conclude
the arrangement regarding the division of the postal receipts between Great Britain and
the colonies. He was also appointed a Commissioner for South Australia for the Indian


ami Colonial Exhibition then about to be held. The various nroposals of Sir Richard’s
scheme were submitted to a Departmental Committee appointed by the British Government,
and, aftei a searching and careful investigation, were recommended without modification
(except as to unimportant details), and were subsequently adopted by the House of Commons.
I hus Sit Richaid may be said to have federated the Australian Colonies so far as external
postal matteis were concerned, and this no doubt gave him a stimulus in his exertions (to
which leference is hereafter made) to aid in completing the federation of the Australian
Colonies.
Sit Richard was the first and only Australian who ever specially represented
the Australian Colonies as a whole in England, in any important matter, with power to
act on his own reponsibility. In recognition of the success of his mission he received
the title of C.M.G. ; also the official thanks of the various Governments of the Australian
Colonies and the British Post Office.
Both in and out of Parliament Sir Richard has delivered many interesting and
able speeches. As an appendix to this volume is published a valuable contribution from his
pen, describing the origin, growth, and present features ot the Constitution of South Australia.
As Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, Sir Richard Baker did
valiant service. lo him is assigned the credit in 1870 of initiating the action which
ultimately, years after, led to the placing of the Audit Commissioners in a position independent
of the Government. \\ hen the delegates were appointed to represent the Province
at the Federal Convention held in Sydney in 1891, Sir Richard Baker was elected as
one of the representatives of South Australia, and by his great knowledge of the subject,
materially influenced the results of the Convention. Ihe handbook on Federation which
Sir Richard had written for the use of the delegates, dealing with the whole complex and
intricate subject, proved of immense service in the work of the Convention as a book of
reference, summarised exposition, and exegesis. On perusing this book, “ The Federal
Manual,’’ it will be found that the Federal Constitution, framed by that Convention, follows,
both in its principles and in its details, almost word for word the lines laid down by Sir Richard.
Sir Richard was appointed to the high and honorable office of the Presidentship
of the Legislative Council of South Australia in December, 1893, amid expressions of the
respect and goodwill which the members felt towards, him. His ability, his lengthened
experience in the Council, his intimate acquaintance with Constitutional law, and his un-
doubted knowledge of the various forms and rules of the House, qualified him in every way-
tor the most honorable and exalted duties. Previous to his elevation to the Presidentship,
Sir Richard was for a long time the unofficial leader of the Legislative Council. During
his political career it may be said that he has taught many useful lessons to the electors
and the people generally ; and that he has always been a strong advocate for self-reliance,
and an uncompromising opponent of State coddling in all its phases.
As has already been mentioned, to the Federation question Sir Richard Baker
has devoted long and profound attention, and so thorough a master and leader on the
271
Hon. Sir R. C. Baker ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


subject as the Hon. Edmund Barton, in his great speech in the Legislative Council of
New South Wales in 1897, stated that Sir Richard Baker “knew more of this matter
than he did.” It is not surprising, therefore, that his extensive conversance with
this great question should have been recognised by his appointment to the very
responsible office of Chairman of Committees of the Federal Convention, which was opened
in Adelaide in 1897, and was continued in Melbourne and Sydney, and which framed the
Commonwealth Bill in its accepted form. By those who sat and acted under his supervising
guidance he has been described as an ideal chairman ; and the Sydney Morning Herald
referred to his performance of his duties on these all-important occasions in the following
terms :—■“ The most arduous position in the Convention was that of Chairman of Committees ;
Sir Richard Baker simply makes an ideal chairman. His knowledge of Parliamentary
law, his profound acquaintance with the whole subject of b ederation, his wide knowledge
on ordinary questions, his firmness, his strict impartiality, his readiness to afford assistance
outside; the technical duties of his office, rendered him a striking success in the most
trying office that could have been conferred on any delegate.” At the close of the sitting
in Melbourne in 1898 the Hon. Edmund Barton, the leader of the Convention, moved,
and the Hon. Alfred Deakin seconded, a vote of thanks to Sir Richard for his services
in the chair. The mover said : —“ Sir Richard Baker had no ordinary task. He had to
*
deal with a very large number of amendments suggested by the Parliaments of the various
colonies. On the part of Sir Richard Baker was required not merely a knowledge of the
place these amendments occupied in the Bill, but a knowledge ot Parliamentary procedure
such as few men possess. His work Sir Richard Baker had accomplished with marked
ability. In addition to all that ability, Sir Richard Baker had shown a very strong and
ardent attachment to the federal cause. The tact and judgment exhibited by the chairman
often saved the Committee from entanglements amongst those numerous amendments which
anyone, however skilled, but with less skill and judgment than Sir Richard Baker, might
have allowed the Committee to drift into. In that way the Convention was deeply indebted
to Sir Richard Baker. It might not only be said fairly of him that he had brought to
this labor the skill of a practised Parliamentarian- not only the tact of a naturally able
man, but that that skill and that tact had been directed by a devotion to the cause which
has enabled both to be exercised with special point and effect." Similar expressions of
appreciation from other delegates followed.
In May, 1895, Sir Richard was selected for a special mark of his Sovereign’s
approval the Knighthood of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. But Sir Richard
Baker has some unique honors outside of the titular world. He was the first native-born
South Australian ever elected to the House of Assembly, and the first to sit in the Legislative
Council. He was the first man born in tin; Colony sworn in as a Minister of the Crown,
the first son of a former member of the Cabinet to be included in a Cabinet, and the first
man of South Australian birth to receive honors from the Oueen. Lastly, Sir Richard
J
was the first native-born South Australian to be chosen as President of the Legislative
O
Council. Following in his father’s footsteps, he has been for over 20 years Chairman of
the Adelaide Club, and for over 12 years Chairman of the South Australian Jockey Club.
It may truly be said of Sir Richard Baker, in conclusion, that his fields of labor have been
many, but he has tilled with uniform success.

Hon. Sir Jenkin Coles, K.C.M.G., M.P.
Speaker of the House of Assembly
THEN the political pulse beats high amid the combats of the legislative arena, and
V V when the; House rocks and sways under the pitch of party emotion, the
Speaker the guardian deity of the privileges and prerogatives of Parliament
must be calm and moderate in
word arc! thought and presence.
It is easily inferable that the
qualifications of the Speaker must
be compatible with the dignified
and stately privileges of the House,
and with the retention of the
heritages of custom and precedent
which as well characterise the
conservatism of political discussion
as the high tone and ethics of
disputation or conduct on the
Benches. A veteran of the
House of Commons once
declared, with an appreciable
amount of metaphorical truth,
that “ Sneakers were born in
L
heaven, and must remain there
in spirit if they would carry out
their terrestrial trying mission to a
satisfactory finale.” This humorous
declaration voices the qualifica-
tions essential to the Speaker’s
successful welfare : elevation from
immediate heated surroundings,
serenity and toleration, edged
J O
where necessary by decisive
promptitude, and ready use of
the power invested In his Chair for the due conduct of the business of Parliament. As
the operator in a laboratory can watch and effectively control by careful adjustment, knowledge,
and accurate precision the experiment before him, so. too, can the Speaker guide the fusion of
political ideas in the crucible of legislation ; and though he may not interfere directly in
the attainment of the political solution, Ik; may yet expel any object foreign or detrimental
to its satisfactory operations.
The members of the House of Assembly in South Australia agree in crediting
its Speaker, Sir Jenkin Coles, with the possession of firmness, impartiality, tact, toleration,
and dignity.


Sir Jenkin Coles comes of an old family which took up its residence in the
north of Ireland over 300 tears ago, and whose members were the descendants of Sir
William Cole of the County of Fermanagh. His ancestral lineage extends far back into
J O O
Irish History, and is connected in its genealogical chain by links of meritorious prestige.
Ihe more immediate ancestors of Sir Jenkin were for many years resident in England
previous to their departure for Sydney in 1839.
Sir Jenkin himself was born in New South Wales on January, 19, 1842. At the
earl) - age of seven years he left with his parents for England, and was educated in the
old “ Blue-Coat ” school known as Christ’s Hospital, which has reared not a few of
Australia’s prominent men.
After his studies were completed, he returned to the colonies with his parents,
who lor a time took up their residence in South Australia. This Province was then
only slightly developed, and there was much untamed bush and untilled land. It
was useful at this comparatively infantile stage of the Province’s growth for a settler to
become thoroughly acquainted with the rather precarious conditions of bush life. Sir
Jenkin enlisted in the Mounted Police Corps of the Province, in which service he
remained for three years, being stationed at the Overland Corner, River Murray ;he thus
became an expert bushman, and acquired the capacity for navigating his way through
untrodden country.
On retiring from the service, Sir Jenkin started in business as an auctioneer
and stock and station agent at Kapunda, having for his partner the late Mr. W. G.
Goodchild. From modest beginnings the business assumed very large proportions, and
in 1875 Sir Jenkin relinquished the active control of it. His career now turned to a more
disinterested direction, and, in response to a requisition from the electors of Light, he
became a candidate for and was elected to the House of Assembly by a large majority. For
a term his political services were severed from the electorate of Light, but with that brief
exception he has unbrokenly represented its interests in the House up to the present day.
In politics, as in specific sciences, adherents and devotees specialise, and that
which seemed to possess most fascination and interest for the member for Light was the
important question of land settlement. In an agricultural community the close study of
this utilitarian question is absolutely imperative. The active interest which Sir Jenkin
evinced in the prosecution of enquiries on various points connected with the agricultural
and pastoral industries wais rewarded by his appointment to the Ministerial office of
Commissioner of Crown Lands, under the administration of Sir John Colton in 1884. In
1885 Sir John Colton’s Government was defeated, and Sir Jenkin remained in Opposition
until 1887. On the downfall of the Downer Government in that year, the Hon. Thomas
Playford was called upon to form an administration, and Sir Jenkin accepted his former
portfolio, holding it until the overthrow of the Government in 1889. His tenureship of the
important office of Commissioner of Crown Lands gave general satisfaction, and the zealous
enthusiasm evinced by him was well spoken of on both sides of the House.
In 1890, when the responsible office of Speaker of the House of Assembly fell
vacant, Sir Jenkin Coles was unanimously elected to the position. The duties of this hi Mi


office are still retained by him, and during his ten years’ experience in it he has more
than graduated in the knowledge required in its holder. In 1894 Sir Jenkin was singled
out for the special commendation of the Crown, and had conferred upon him the dignity
of K.C.M.G.
Sir Jenkin Coles, who is one of the Directors of the Bank of Adelaide, and
Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Citizens’ Life Assurance Company, has a
personality that is dignified and commanding. Tall, stern, and a close reader of men, the
decisive power that one associates with such a bearing could find no better sphere for
its exercise than in the office of Speakership ; while in private life Sir Jenkin will be
found an affable, courteous, and in every way estimable gentleman.
Sir John Alexander Cockburn, K.C.M.G., M.D.,
Ex-Premier and Agent-General
THE ambassadorial position of Agent-General in London for an important self-
governing Australian colony is not one easily to be filled, requiring as it does in
the occupant abilities and qualities not only of a high order, but also rarely to be
found in combination. The man who possesses the necessary business knowledge and
capability may, as likely as not, lack the equally requisite longer foresight and larger
mental grasp of the statesman. He who has the indispensable tact and diplomatic skill
and the desirable charm of manner, may be wanting in energy and power of initiative.
But of Sir John Cockburn, the present representative of South Australia in the capital of
the world, it may be said that he is fully qualified in all respects for the difficult
post he holds —in short. that he is an ideal Agent-General. With unfailing
courtesy of manner, and a pleasant address and presence, he combines intellectual
activity, great working powers, and a keen instinct for the best means of promoting the
interests of the Province he represents. He never loses an opportunity for vigorously
advertising South Australia by voice and pen in the great centres of civilisation, whether
the chance arise at his own official door, or in the yet farther distant I nited States of
America.
John Alexander Cockburn was born at Corsbie, in the Lammermuirs, Scotland, in
18so; and he is therefore now in his fiftieth year. As a boy he was sent to Chomeley
School. Highgate, London ; and he subsequently studied medicine at King’s College.
London. At the age of 23 he graduated with the M.B. degree at the London University,
and in the following year (1874), gained the gold medal in the medical course at that
institution. Then, like so many of his enterprising and capable countrymen who have duly
provided themselves with a good education, he looked abroad for a career rather than to
the overcrowded homeland. Fate directed his steps to South Australia, and he came out
to the Province in 1875. He chose Jamestown for his first sphere of labor, and there he
settled and entered upon the practice of his profession. He speedily became popular in
that locality, and was chosen as the first Mayor of the town. He held the leading civic
7 R


office for three and a half years, being re-elected no less than four times in succession ; and
his administration of the municipal affairs of Jamestown was marked by the enduringly
beneficial plantation of the streets and reserves with shade-giving trees. In 1881 he was
appointed a Commissioner of the North Midland Road Board ; and while in the district he
interested himself in the Volunteer Force, becoming a Vice-President of the Rifle
Volunteers, as well as Captain of the local company.
He began his political career in 1884, being returned to the House of Assembly by
the Burra electorate at the head of the poll. He moved the adoption of the Address-in-Reply,
acquitting himself so ably that on all sides high Parliamentary distinction was predicted for
him. He soon showed that this effort was no mere flash in the pan, and speedily began
to make his way towards an influential position in the House, chiefly by means of his mastery
of a copious and cultured eloquence. His principal achievement as a young member of
1 arliament was in promoting the Bill for Payment of Members, which was carried mainly
thiough the agency of his strenuous, persistent, and eloquent advocacy. He became a member
of the Downer Cabinet in 1885, as Minister of Education and Agriculture ; and while holding
I*•* 1 • -
this position he introduced to Parliament several important progressive measures in connection
with the departments under his charge, notably the parcels post and postal notes regulations.
He continued his Ministerial duties until 1887, when, at the general election in that year, he
was defeated for the Burra. Ihe Mount Barker electors, however, immediately came to
the rescue, returning him at the head of the poll ; and he continued to represent that
constituency until his appointment as Agent-General in 1898. In June. 1889, he succeeded
in carrying a vote of want of confidence jn the Administration headed by the Hon. Thomas
Playford, which gave him the Premiership ; and he held the first Parliamentary position in
the I rovince for 14 months. On the defeat of Sir John Downer’s Government in June, 1893,
Ur. Cockburn resumed Ministerial charge of the Education Department, the Hon. C. C.
Kingston being the head of the new Administration. In 1897 he was chosen one of the
ten representatives of South Australia at the Federal Conference which opened in Melbourne,
and the deliberations of which led up to the framing of the Australian Commonwealth Bill.’
In lB9B, he left the Province to take up the duties of Agent-General in
London ; and this office he has continued ably to fill up to the time "of writing this
memoir. When, on January 1, 1900, he received from the Queen, as a New' Year’s
honor, the title of K.C.M.G., it was generally felt that the reward was a well merited
recognition of his public services. He is rightly looked upon as the parliamentary pioneer
of the liberal movement in the politics of South Australia, which has been so marked a
feature of the past decade so far as the Province is concerned, and has been watched
with keen interest by other countries. He was ever a vigorous supporter of Adult
Suffrage, Reform of the Upper House, Technical and Industrial Education, and Voting
b\ Referendum to name only some of the progressive measures with the advocacy
of which he identified himself freely and fearlessly. While representing the Province
across the seas, he is in the habit of delivering public addresses on various subjects which
are highly appreciated, and serve to popularise South Australia in his own person. He
distinguished himself conspicuously in this way at the great Commercial Congress at
Philadelphia, which he attended on behalf of the Province.

Hon. J. G. Jenkins, M.P., Chief Secretary
DPHE capacity of Americans to “go ahead" is proverbial and commendable, and numbers
1 of representatives of that nation have, by the qualities of push and perseverance,
established their right to superior recognition in Australia. In this colony are
men, breathing the spirit of liberty emanating from the memorable Declaration of
Independence, whose usefulness and
high-grade service reflect credit on
o o
the land of their birth and on their
individual attainments. Among
them is the Hon. J. G. Jenkins,
the shrewd and humorous Chief
Secretary in the Holder Ministry.
Born at Susquehanna, Pennsyl-
vania, on September 8, 1851. John
Greeley Jenkins was early animated
with the enterprise characteristic of
natives of that historical State.
When he left school he became
associated with the office of a large
publishing house, a branch of trade
at that time showing considerable
activity in ingenious innovations.
He was soon commisioned to travel
for that firm in various parts of the
States and Canada. Mr. Jenkins,
like most of his countrymen, was
endowed with an aptitude for
acquiring information and of storing
it up to good purpose. Eventually
he was engaged to travel in Aus-
tralia, and he arrived in Adelaide,
South Australia, in April, 1878. A
short sojourn in the Province sufficed
to induce him to sever his connection with his firm and to establish a business on his
own account in Adelaide. He imported, on a large scale, English and American publications,
and found an agreeable market to encourage him. An offer from the Picturesque Atlas
Company to manage its publication in South Australia caused him to relinquish his private
business, and he was associated with this position for some time. In 1886 he started
auctioneering, and became senior partner in the firm of Jenkins <N Guir. I his Inm
enjoyed for some time a substantial business. Mr. Jenkins retired from it to devote
himself more closely to public work.


Of an observant frame of mind, it did not take him long to understand local
conditions and institutions. As every occupant of a log hut has the opportunity of becoming
master of White House, so Mr. Jenkins was imbued with an exemplary ambition fora public
career. His experiences in the United States and Canada were likely to be useful in
South Australia. His residence was situated in the suburb of Unley, where he displayed
some activity in public movements. As a member of literary societies he proved that he
was possessed of bright debating powers, and he was elected to the Union Parliament, a
body constituted by these societies, from which several useful legislators have graduated.
Mr. Jenkins attained official importance among these unofficial parliamentarians, and rendered
both the Literary Societies’ Union and the Union Parliament good service. He was
for some time “ Premier ”of the latter and President of the former. He was for many years
J J
connected with the Adelaide Young Men’s Literary Society, and during the presidentship
of the late Rev. \V. Roby Fletcher was Vice-President. At that time the Society comprised
500 members, outdistancing in number any similar organisation in South Australia. Mr.
Jenkins first entered public life as member of the Unley Council for Parkside Ward. P'or
two years he represented that expanding suburb with some vigor and to the satisfaction
of ratepayers, and was forthwith returned to the Mayoralty unopposed an honor seldom
afforded to one so young in municipal experience. His term of office satisfied the
townspeople, and he had to decline the post in the following year, being debarred by
business pressure.
At the general elections of 1887 Mr. Jenkins was a candidate for a seat in the
House of Assembly for the District of Sturt, which had Unley and Parkside for its chief
centres. His popularity in the locality, and his ability for the office, were demonstrated by
his being elected first on the poll among several candidates. Here his acumen and o- o od
. . 0 c">
sense sustained him, and he has been returned at every subsequent election. During the
first three or four sessions his speeches were listened to with attention, and his political
sturdiness won for him encomiums from the press and the public. Of advanced views, he
was yet known to be moderate in pressing them ; and, as his accomplishments were so
generally recognised, it was only a question of time before he assumed Ministerial office.
Upon the sudden death of the Hon. David Bews in March, 1891, the Premier, Mr. T.
Playford, offered Mr. Jenkins the portfolio of Education, which he accepted. He occupied
this post for nine months, and made an exhaustive study of the question of State education.
He introduced and carried through the House a Bill providing for free education, an
advanced piece of legislation very creditable to the Province. When in January, 1892, the
late Sir John Bray was appointed Agent-General, there was a re-arrangement of portfolios,
and Mr. Jenkins took office as Commissioner of Public Works. He was thus engaged
until June of the same year, when the Government was defeated by Mr. Holder.
At the general elections in 1893 the contests in the metropolitan districts were
unusually keen because of the activity of the Labor Party. This political school organised
its forces with such admirable vigor that it returned every one of its metropolitan nominees
with the exception of the Sturt candidate, where Mr. Jenkins defeated him by 21 votes.
Although a narrow majority, if the splendid concentration of forces of the Labor Party be
considered, it appears an eminent one. When the Kingston Government took office in


June, 1893, Mr. Jenkins was appointed Government Whip; but in the vacancy caused in
1894 by the Hon. Thomas Playford assuming the office of Agent-General, he was awarded
the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works, relieving the Hon. F. W. Holder, who
went to the Treasury. This post he filled until the termination of the long span of the
Kingston-Holder Ministry in December, 1899. When but a week later Mr. Holder
formed his present Ministry, Mr. Jenkins accepted the portfolio of Chief Secretary with
its multifarious duties. Thus, save for that one week’s interregnum, he has been a Minister
of the Crown for seven out of the thirteen years he has sat in Parliament. As Commissioner
of Public Works, Mr. Jenkins initiated several improvements in his department. Although
within his period of office in that important capacity the Province was unusually depressed
through inexorable causes, his policy has been comparatively a forward one. He advocated
a plan whereby the metropolitan district could be assured of a plentiful supply of water.
He believed this to be a matter of the first importance, and even in the Playford
Administration had evinced great interest in it. The Happy Valley Waterworks Bill was
the outcome, and those extensive public works will remain as monuments of his occupancy
of the Treasury benches. At a subsequent period he hastened the completion of construction,
so as to give Adelaide and suburbs a supply three times larger than that formerly enjoyed.
As Chief Secretary and Minister of War, Mr. Jenkins was necessarily closely
associated with the enthusiastic military movement which resulted in sending four successive
contingents of troops from the Province to aid the British arms in the struggle with the
Boers ; and the excellence of all the arrangements in connection with the raising, equipment,
and despatch of these forces was largely due to his ability as chief administrator of the
Defence Department.
As a private member Mr. Jenkins was responsible for the introduction of the
Extension of the Hours of Voting Bill. This amendment to the existing Act, designed to
remove certain forms of electoral injustice, affords electors an opportunity of voting up to 7
o’clock at night, and it is a privilege to those who are employed in shops, who are able
to record their vote without risking the disfavor of their employers by absenting themselves
during working hours. Mr. Jenkins is ardently in favor of Federation ; but, because of
his Ministerial duties, was unable to offer himself for election to the recent Convention.
During the absence in the other Colonies of the Right Hon. C. C. Kingston at the
meetings of the Convention, he acted as Premier of South Australia.
Mr. Jenkins took an active part in the establishment of the South Australian
Constitution of Freemasons. He was Worshipful Master of the Leopold Lodge in
1885, and has filled many offices in connection with the Grand Lodge of South Australia.
During the absence of the Right Hon. S. J. Way in England in 1897 he acted for him,
being at the time Deputy Grand Master, a position he still holds. Not only has the Hon.
J. G. Jenkins accomplished a successful public mission in South Australia, but by his amiable
personality has secured the regard of her people.

Hon. J. H. Gordon, Q.C., M.L.C., Attorney-General
AMONG three or four brilliant men who entered the South Australian Parliament
in the latter half of the decade ended with 1890, was the Hon. J. H. Gordon.
There then emerged from comparative obscurity such talented orators and
politicians as Mr. Gordon, Mr. Holder, and Dr. Cockburn, men who since that
period have wielded an immense
influence over public thought and
local politics.
John Hannah Gordon was
born in Scotland in 1850, and is
the eldest son of the respected
Rev. James Gordon, Presbyterian
minister, of Gawler. He came to
the Province with his parents in
1859. It does not seem that at
first he was intended for the law,
for Mr. Gordon entered the count-
ing-house of W. Duffield & Co.,
whence he went to the milling
firm of John Dunn & Co. But
no doubt showing a predisposition
for legal technicalities, he was
eventually articled to a firm of
lawyers, and in 1876 was admitted
to practice at the South Australian
Bar. No sphere was better suited
to his talents, and he entered upon
a successful career. He practised
for eleven years at Strathalbyn,
where he was monopolised by the
people of the countryside who had
complaints to make and interests
to defend. While in Strathalbyn
he was a prominent member of the municipal council, and occupied the office of mayor,
lo this day Mr. Gordon takes a lively interest in the affairs of that pretty country town.
When he left Strathalbyn, Mr. Gordon emigrated to Adelaide, where a wider
field opened for his undoubted talents. He entered into partnership with Mr. T. R.
Bright also a successful lawyer from the country, Clare and the two gentlemen soon
secured a good practice. They were subsequently joined by Mr. J. R. Anderson.
In 1888, Air. Gordon was elected to the Legislative Council for the Southern


District, which he still represents. His political career, prosperous as it has been, thus
extends back only a dozen years. He early took an active part in political life, and in
June, 1889, when Dr. Cockburn formed his first Cabinet, he consented to lead the Upper.
House as Minister of Education in the Government. He occupied this office until
August 19, 1890, when Dr, Cockburn’s Ministry gave way to that of Messrs. Playford
and Kingston. On June 21, 1892, Mr. Holder, who held office in Dr. Cockburn s
Government, succeeded the Playford combination, and Mr. Gordon again took charge of
the Department of Education. The Holder Government was ousted by Sir John Downer
in the following October, and then, on June 16, 1893, Mr. Kingston, Mr. Holder, Dr.
Cockburn, Mr. Playford, and Mr. Gordon, forming a powerful combination, resumed the
reins of Government, Mr. Gordon becoming Chief Secretary. Mr. Gordon held this
important position until 1896, when he retired, first being awarded the right of prefixing
the title “Honorable” to his name. In 1899, when Mr. Kingston resigned office, Mr.
Gordon joined Mr. Holder’s Ministry as Attorney-General, which position he still retains.
For one in Parliament for such a short time, the above is a brilliant record of
administrative work ; and undoubtedly, had Mr. Gordon been in the Assembly, it would
have been still brighter. In all his official duties he was associated with Messrs. Holder
and Cockburn.
As Minister of Education and Chief Secretary, the Hon. J. H. Gordon has been
responsible for several useful innovations in the departments under his Ministerial charge.
The tactful manner in which he led the Upper House, in which Chamber may be said to
have lain the chief danger to the Governments of which he has been member, greatly
contributed to the strength of his party, and even to the duration of its term of office. In
this regard Mr. Gordon merits more commendation than he received. In IS9O he
presided over the Postal Conference held in Adelaide which brought about a reduction
in the cable rates, and an alteration in the agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph
Company and the countries interested in the route. I his amendment was to the advantage
of South Australia, and Mr. Gordon was energetic in having it carried. He was also
prominently associated with other measures of public utility.
Apart from provincial politics, the Hon. Mr. Gordon has been active in promoting
the aspirations of the Australian people in helping to bring about Federation. In 1891 the
Legislative Council unanimously elected him delegate to the Federal Convention held in
Sydney in that year, and he was by no means a silent member when the important debates
began. He was elected by the people of the Province to represent South Australia in the
more recent Convention, which held meetings in Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne in 1897-8.
To the difficult task of settling the conflicting interests of the various colonies interested
he brought a deliberative judgment, and the eloquence of his appeals assisted the delegates
in arriving at a workable basis. After the Convention rose he was also energetic in speaking
throughout the Province in the interests of the Commonwealth Bill, for which work Mr. Gordon
is worthy of the good words of all those who wish to have a Pederated Australia.
As a speaker, the lion. Mr. Gordon is among the most eloquent in Austiaha.
His delivery is easy, his words are well chosen, and his manner is pleasing. He is a
force that must always be reckoned with in South Australian politics.

Hon. Laurence O’Loughlin, M.P.,
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Minister of Mines
There is no more important position in the Cabinet of an Australian colony than that of
the administrator of lands, mines, and forests. To his care and control are entrusted
the most vital interests of a new country. Consequently it is found that, where the
administration is most effective in
the colonial group, the post of
M mister of Lands is filled by a
man who not only possesses an
intimate acquaintance with the
cultivation of the soil, but also
knows how to turn that expert
knowledge to account for the
general good of the community.
The present Government of South
Australia (writing in 1900) has
for its Lands Minister a man
who in every respect may be
said to adequately fill the
position. A practical agriculturist,
Mr. O’Loughlin is also, from long
experience, intimately acquainted
with pastoral requirements in a
country where seasons are un-
certain and the shepherd king of
to-day may be the bankrupt of
to-morrow. Further than that, he
is devoted to the industry that,
falling within his Ministerial care,
is also second to that only of wool-
growing in Australia. The clay
will probably come when the living
sheep will have to yield to the
dead gold as the champion product of Australia. Ihe period of mighty squattages is
done ; and the mineral bids fair to replace the animal in a land where deadly drought is
prevalent. Not yet, however, is gold uppermost in the list of South Australian products.
1" arinaceous are her wares. South Australian wheat has topped the price in the world’s
market ; and the grain-raising interest is the backbone of this Province. Fitting is it,
therefore, that the Minister of Lands should be a tiller of the soil.
Mr. OLoughlins father was an early settler near Virginia, and he himself was
born at Salisbury, on the Adelaide Plains, on February 21, 1854. He was educated at


the Roman Catholic School at \ irginia, and subsequently at the Sevenhills College.
Arrived at mans estate, he engaged in farming and grazing in the district of Frome, with
which part of the country his political hie has since been associated. His experience
embraced good times and bad, and he had to pass through the chequered experiences of
a settler on the land in Australia. He was one of the first to take up selections in the
Northern Areas, first at Caltowie, and afterwards at Telowie and Baroota. For many
years before entering Parliament he was a member of the Vermin Board, and was also
one of the first nominated members of the Port Germein District Council.
Mr. O’Loughlin first became a member of the House of Assembly in 1890, when
he was returned at the head of the poll for the constituency of P'rome. He then supported
the Cockburn Government, following his chief into opposition on the defeat of that
Administration. His next governmental association was with the short-lived Holder
Ministry of 1892. In the general election of the following year he again topped the
poll for the Frome electorate, and in 1894 he was appointed Government Whip in the
Assembly, in succession to Mr. Jenkins, who was elevated to a Ministerial position. In
1896 Mr. O’Loughlin was once more returned as senior member for Frome; and in this
year his services to the Liberal cause were rewarded with a Ministerial portfolio, he being
appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands in the Kingston-Holder Ministry, succeeding
his intimate friend, the late Mr. P. P. Gillen, on the tragically-sudden death of the latter.
Save for the interregnum of one week in December, 1899, when Mr. Solomon held the
reins of power, Mr. O’Loughlin has had charge of the Lands Office ever since, and he
remains senior member for Frome.
As a Minister of the Crown, Mr. O’Loughlin has distinguished himself by his
practical good sense rather than by any oratorical displays ; and in his department he is
thoroughly at home with all the details of land administration. Possessed of highly
progressive ideas, he has persistently advocated the throwing open of the land, federation,
intercolonial free trade, the amendment and consolidation of the pastoral laws, the development
of the mineral resources of the Province, and a vigorous public works policy, lie is a
supporter of a progressive land tax, but is opposed to the single tax. Since his term of
office began, very important legislation affecting territorial interests has been passed, including
the following Acts: Pastoral Act, 1896; Vermin Districts Act, 1896; Closer Settlement
Act, 1897; Vermin-proof Fencing Act, 1897; Crown Lands Amendment Act. 1898:
Pastoral Lands Act, 1898; Vermin Amending Act, 1898; Mining on Private Property
Act, 1899. The tendency of this legislation has all been towards liberalisation of the land
laws; and the importance of these enactments may be easily inferred from their titles
The interests of the miner also, equally with those of the farmer and pastoralist, are in
Mr. O’Loughlin’s fostering care; and his Ministerial usefulness may be said to extend over
the length and breadth of the land.
Since the Hon. L. O’Loughlin’s advent as Minister of Mines in 1896, he has
done all in his power to foster and encourage the mining industry. This, coupled with
the increased price of copper, has given a great impetus to the copper industry, especially
with regard to the Northern mines. Old mines, such as the Blimnan, Sliding Rock, Prince
283
Hon, l.OLoughiin ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


Alfred, and Yudnamutana, have again started operations ; and amongst more recent shows
the Copper Top, Pauli’s Consolidated, Parabarana, O’Donoghue Castle, and Lorna Doone
are being actively worked. The new gold find at Tarcoola continues to be most
promising, and there is evidence that a permanent field has been found.
In 1895 the number of mineral claims held was 112, comprising an area of 8,220
acres, the number of mining leases held being 96, with an area of 1,799 acres. At the
present time (1900) there are 1,441 mineral claims on the Mining Register, embracing
56,199 acres, and 1,087 mining leases, with an area of 28,015 acres; total area held for
mining purposes being 84,214 acres. The number of men employed in mining in 1895
was estimated at about 3,000 ; at the present time the estimate is 5,000.
During the four years that the Hon. L. O’Loughlin, M.P., has occupied the
position of Commissioner of Woods and Forests the distributing of trees and vines free to
applicants has been continued, 980,188 trees and 155,415 vines being distributed to the
public. The planting operations of the department have been continued, 525,920 trees
being planted. The young timber in the plantations at Bundaleer has in some instances
developed into useful material, realising satisfactory rates. The cash received for sales
of this timber during the period under review amounts to 713 9s. 6d.
The beautiful cave which was discovered some time ago in the Cave Range Forest
Reserve near Narracoorte has been made accessible to the public during the Hon.
Commissioner’s tenure of office, and was duly opened for the admission of visitors on June
22, 1897, under the name of “The Victoria Cave,” this designation having been given
it by the Hon. Commissioner in honor of Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee. It has since
been considerably improved by the formation of various extra passages, so that the
natural phenomena of stalactites, etc., in which its chambers abound, together with the
attractions of the older caves, prove together a charming resort, which visitors greatly
appreciate.
Fearless in the advocacy of his opinions and the prosecution of his principles,
Mr. O’l .oughlin has yet always retained the respect of all with whom he has come in contact-
political opponents as well as friends. Deeply imbued with religious feeling, he is a true
son of the Roman Catholic Church.
The late Hon. R. B. And reWS, a Judge of the Supreme Court.
BORN at Epping, in Essex, in 1823, Richard Bullock Andrews embraced law as a
profession, and practised in his native town for some years. Coming to Australia
primarily for his health, he resolved, in 1853, to remain in South Australia. In
March, 1865, he was appointed Queen’s Counsel. He was first elected to Parliament on
June 5, 1857, continuing, with the exception of the years 1860-62, a member of the House
of Assembly till his resignation on January 18,1870, when he was appointed Crown Solicitor
and Public Prosecutor, having had the title of “Honorable” conferred upon him. Mr. Andrews
was Attorney-General in seven Ministries. On March 9, 1881, he was elevated to the
Supreme Court Bench, where he showed excellent tact, courtesy, and judgment. Towards
the close of 1883 his health broke down. He was granted six months’ leave of absence
and proceeded to Tasmania, where he died on June 26, 1884.

Hon R. W. Foster, M R., Commissioner of Public Works
IN comparing a table of the industries of the Province with a list of the occupations
of members of Parliament, it will be found that the latter fairly represent the
former. Nearly every class, small or large, is represented in the Legislature by
one ot its own following; and the influence of this equality of representation on the laws
should give satisfaction to the
people as a whole. The wool,
wheat, and flour industries deserve
to have each its personal represen-
tatives, and may be said to have
them. Parliament contains a good
sprinkling of pastoralists, agricul-
turists, and millers, or those who
by residence, personal observation,
and study have become closely
acquainted with such pursuits.
Mr. Foster represents these three
industries, and as senior member
for the District of Newcastle in
the House of Assembly, is respon-
sible to very large and serious
J O
interests.
Richard Witty P'oster is a
native of Yorkshire, England,
where he was born in 1856.
After leaving school he went to
London, where he was for some
years engaged in the soft-goods
trade. He came to South Aus-
tralia in 1880, and for three years
was a probationer in the Weslevan
J
Church. He eventually deter-
mined to sever his connection with the ministry and to engage in business pursuits at
Ouorn. He married a daughter of Mr. T. Lees, of that town, and entered into partnership
with his father-in-law, who was a storekeeper and farmer on a fairly large scale in the
district. In the course of a few years Mr. Foster became sole proprietor of the business.
It is strikingly apparent in Australia that the qualities general in the undenominational
ministries seem to fit the pastors to an unusual degree for public capacities. Thus it comes
about, that numbers of ministers have entered politics and are regular contributors to the
editorial columns of the principal newspapers. Mr. Foster is no exception, and he has


done Rood work in Parliament. He was for a number of years a member of the Quorn
o •'
Council, and for three consecutive years occupied the mayoral chair. Por several
years he was chairman of the local School Board of Advice, and was identified with
agricultural societies. When, therefore, he offered himself in 1893 to the electors ot
Newcastle, for the District of Newcastle, in the House of Assembly, it is not surprising
that he was successful ; and so well did he carry out his duties in the ensuing Parliament
that he was returned at the head of the poll in April, 1896, and again in the general
elections in 1899. His special forte in politics is land legislation, and he gives an earnest
support to all movements aiming at improving the position of the farmers and graziers,
In the numerous and serious debates which have taken place on the land laws he has
been a prominent figure ; and because of his personal knowledge and study, he is able to
speak to some purpose. When the unfortunate drought of four years ago was at its
worst, he heartily advocated the cause of the sufferers, and took a foremost part in the
questions of gratuitous distribution of seed wheat and commonage lor farmers’ stock. He
used his influence to have seed wheat advanced to distressed aß'riculturists, and not only
O J
earned their gratitude in that respect, but also went to considerable trouble to secure
commonage for graziers at a nominal price, where feed was more plentiful, so as to save
their stock. The Government acquired an area in the Cooper district, and between William
Creek and Oodnadatta, and offered it for grazing purposes, with the result that no fewer
than 7,000 horses were dispatched from various districts in the North to this locality.
Mr. F oster, on behalf of the Commissioner of Crown Lands, had inspected the area, and,
moreover, went to the trouble of overlooking the trucking of the stock to Oodnadatta.
The animals remained in the Far North during the most severe period of the drought, and
the bulk of them were saved and returned to their owners in fair condition.
•
When the Kingston Ministry resigned in 1899, Mr. Holder took Mr. Foster in
as his Commissioner of Public Works —a selection which has proved most satisfactory both
to the Ministry, to the Parliament, and to the community.
It is certain that his constituency thoroughly appreciates Mr. Foster’s useful
services. He is a man of strength in debate, and of general business acumen, and he
worthily upholds the dignity of his responsible position.
The late Hon. G. C. Hawker.
BORN in London on September 21, 1818, the late Hon. G. C. Hawker arrived in
South Australia on September 6, 1840, settling near Clare. Mr. Hawker suffered
many hardships in the earlier years of his career, but by steady perseverance and
a firm belief in the future of the Province created a magnificent estate known as Dungaree,
with an area of 80,000 acres. He was first elected to Parliament on January 5,
1858; was Speaker from April 27, iB6O, till January 25, 1865. Altogether Mr. Hawker
sat in Parliament for more than 26 years, and served as a Minister of the Crown an
aggregate of 1,422 days, having been Treasurer in the Blyth Ministry of 1875, Chief Secretary
in the Boucaut Ministry of 1876, and Commissioner of Public Works in the Boucaut and
Morgan Ministries of 1877-81. He died May 21, 1895, and was accorded a State funeral.

Hon Egerton Lee Batchelor, M.P.,
Minister of Education and Agriculture
THE most important feature in the political development of South Australia during
the last ten or twelve years has been the growing Parliamentary influence which,
by persistence in organisation, the Labor Party, as it is termed, has obtained. As
regards the House of Assembly,
this influence may now be said to
be strongly and firmly established.
Without the support of the
proletariat, no Ministry could hope
to continue long in office ; and
no measure has a chance of
being passed into law which is
unfortunate enough to incur the
disfavor of any large class of
j o
manual workers. In no other
self-governing province of the
British Empire has the Demo-
cratic principle of rule “ for the
people, by the people,” been
carried so determinedly to the
J
logical conclusion that from the
o
masses rather than from any
J
artificially - created classes shall
come those to whose hands are
to be entrusted the reins of
political power. The South
Australian statesman who should
ignore the Labor Party in his
o J
plan of campaign, would speedily
find that he had reckoned sadly
without his host. With so pre-
ponderating an influence in the
chief electorates of the Province, and so strong a representation in Parliament, this party
is certainly to be reckoned with in South Australian politics ; and, having this influence, it
is no wonder that its prominent members are found very much to the fore in the Legislative
business of the Province. Time was when the Labor leader was despised as a mere
agitator, a mob orator. Now he is not only to be found among prominent members of
Parliament, but even in the Ministry itself- —and accounted not the least important of the
Ministers. The subject of this notice is a case in point.
Etrerton Lee Batchelor is a native of South Australia. He was born in Adelaide


jn 1865, and is therefore still a young man. He started earning a living for himself as a
pupil teacher at North Adelaide, and passed his qualifying examination at the age of
years. An appointment to the North Adelaide Model School followed, and in that
position he remained until 1882, passing, meantime, the periodical examinations with great
success. In the year last mentioned, indifferent health compelled him to relinquish the
arduous duties of a school teacher, and he followed a natural bent by entering the Locomotive
Department of the State railway service as an apprentice in the engineering branch. His
career in the Railway Department was very successful, for at the age of 26 years, when he
forsook the study of engineering for politics, he had risen to a foreman’s position in the
Locomotive Shops. His connection with the Railway Department extended over 11 years
and during the whole of that time not one single complaint of any kind was recorded against
him. Under a rule of the Service he was obliged to resign his position on coming forward
as a candidate for a seat in Parliament.
In 1889 Mr. Batchelor joined the Adelaide Branch of the Amalgamated Society
of Engineers ; and he has been a consistent and energetic member of that powerful corporation
ever since. He served as President for no less than four terms, and he has held various
offices in the Society during the last ten years. He was delegate of the Adelaide Branch
to the South Australian Trades and Labor Council, and was also treasurer of the latter
body. For many years, too, he held the office of president of the South Australian Railway
Service Mutual Association, a powerful organisation with a large membership, and he
only relinquished this post on becoming a member of the Holder Ministry last year (1899).
He has also filled the very responsible position of Secretary of the United Labor Party of
South Australia ; and the electoral triumphs of that party during recent years were undoubtedly
largely due to the energy, organising talent, and general ability he displayed in that capacity.
Mr. Batchelor began his Parliamentary career on leaving' the railway engineering
<’J O J o
service in 1893. He was then only 28 years of age; but so ably had he comported
himself in the various responsible offices in connection with trades and labor organisations
to which he had been appointed, and so successful had he been in winning the esteem of
his party, that, young as he was, he was selected at the general Parliamentary elections as
a candidate in the interests of labor for the district of West Adelaide. The contest
was a memorable one, and the result may be said to have once for all established the Labor
interest as a determining factor in South Australian politics. The other candidates were
the Hon. L. Grayson (Commissioner of Public Works) and the Hon. C. C. Kingston. O.C.
Mr. Batchelor, however, was returned at the head of the poll. This young man, on his
first appearance as a Parliamentary candidate, actually defeated two seasoned political
warriors—the one a member of the Ministry, the other even then perhaps the strongest
politician in the Province ! This triumph was no doubt mainly attributable to the splendidly
organised electioneering efforts and tactics of the Labor Party. But a share of the credit
is certainly due to the merits of the candidate himself. The man was worthy of the occasion.
No mere puppet could have met with such success. The fact that Mr. Batchelor possessed
qualities of a sterling and lasting character was amply proved by his being returned at the
top of the poll for the West Adelaide constituency at succeeding triennial elections, not once,
not only twice, nor even thrice, but four times ; and, more remarkable still, no less a person


than Mr. Kingston, Premier of the Colony for six and a half years, was his junior colleague
in the constituency during the whole period of that popular and able statesman’s unprecedently
long lease of political power.
Since he entered Parliament, seven years ago, Mr. Batchelor’s name has been
prominently connected with many efforts in the direction of social reform. He has had
charge, for the Labor Party, of various important measures, notably the Village Settlements
Bill and Lake Bonney Settlements Bill; while in 1895 he introduced to the House of
Assembly the Referendum Bill, considered to be the most complete measure dealing with
that subject which was ever introduced to any English-speaking Parliament. On the
much-regretted death of Mr. J. A. McPherson in 1898, Mr. Batchelor was unanimously
elected to the leadership of the Parliamentary Labor Party-—a most important post when
the strength of the Labor Party and its influence on the course of political events is duly
borne in mind. After the fall of the long-lived Kingston Administration in December of
last year (1899), followed within a week by that of their Conservative successors, the
Hon. F. W. Holder, who formed a Ministry from the combined Liberal and Labor parties,
offered Mr. Batchelor the portfolio of Minister of Education and Agriculture. With
characteristic loyalty to the great cause of which he is so ardent a champion, the Labor
leader placed the decision in the hands of his party, who unanimously approved of his
acceptance of the position. Mr. Batchelor, it is understood, is the first Parliamentary Labor
member in Australia who has joined a Ministry with the full approval of his party. The
appointment to the position of a Cabinet Minister of a young man who but a few years
j j
ago was working at the bench, and whose intervening Parliamentary career has been
but short, however praiseworthy, may in some quarters be regarded somewhat in the
li&ht of an experiment. But those who know Mr. Batchelor best, confidently anticipate
an entirely successful career for him as an administrator.
Anyone less like burly, broad-chested John Burns, the chief Labor champion in
the House of Commons, than the Labor leader in the South Australian House of Assembly,
could hardly be imagined. Mr. Batchelor is slight and almost frail of physique, and his face
conveys the impression of delicate health. But this Australian possesses equally with the
Englishman the ardor in a great cause that alone can make a man a telling force among
his fellows. And as John Burns has now succeeded in winning the respect and esteem
of even his bitterest political opponents, so has Mr. Batchelor become one of the most
popular and highly respected members of the South Australian House of Assembly. By
J J
undeviating courtesy of manner and tone, coupled with a manly modesty of demeanor, he
has secured the goodwill of both friends and opponents of his party, while his straight-
forwardness and conscientiousness have gained him general public appreciation. As a
speaker he is fluent and easy, convincing rather than denunciating. As an organiser he
has proved himself a master ; and his past effectiveness in this role is one of the best
auguries for his success in the future as an administrator. Mr. Batchelor has the best
part of his life before him, and a powerful organisation, commanding some 23,000 votes,
behind him. Could any public man wish for better prospects ?

Hon. Sir fames Penn Boucaut, K.C.M.G., Second Judge of the Supreme Court
HAD it been asked some twenty years ago who was the most courageous and
formidable warrior in the South Australian Parliament, the reply would have
undoubtedly pointed to the Hon. J. P. Boucaut, whose political energy and good
temper were unaffected by the invective hurled at him by Parliamentary enemies, and
whose bold political programme
at once excited the fear and the
admiration of the people. I here
was a good deal of the statesman
about this fighter, and whatever
fear was aroused by his boldness
as a legislator has been turned in
later years into praise of the fine
results his measures have achieved.
During a period of 17 years of
unrest and turmoil, Sir James Penn
Boucaut proved himself to be a
politician of the highest order,
whose stamp of mind, whose
courage, and whose foresight were
< 1 o
adapted to the exigencies and
rapidly - changing conditions of
colonial government. And from
this storm and stress he quietly
entered into the repose ot the
Judiciary —a change comparable
with that of a soldier, at war to-day,
becoming a solemn and peace-
loving country squire to-morrow.
Mr. Justice Boucaut is a
son of Cornwall, and he has
more than once boasted of the
circumstance on public occasions. He was born near P'almouth, on October 29, 1831, and
there received those delightful impressions found in quaint legend and hoary tradition so
dear to the heart of every true Cornishman. His father was Captain Ray Boucaut,
and his mother was a daughter of the late James Penn, Superintendent ot Her Majesty’s
Naval Victualling Department, P'almouth. Captain Boucaut came to South Australia with
his family in 1846. and here became “a most energetic and popular man,” and greatly
interested himself “ in all that concerned the welfare of the Province ” —(George E. Loyau,
“ Representative Men of South Australia,” 1883). He died of apoplexy on January 29,


1872. Sir J. P. Boucaut’s education was imparted in England; and soon after his arrival
in the Province he was articled to the law, and was admitted to practice in 1855. he
became a barrister of leading rank, and attained renown in Common Law. He was also
an all-round practitioner, and enjoyed a very large professional connection. Important
briefs were entrusted to him, and no one in the Province could pick out their subtleties
and appraise their value better than he.
Sir J. P. Boucaut had a powerful predisposition for politics, and he was never
happier than when testing his prowess with political combatants. His heart was in the
legislative arena, and he gave full vent to His talent there. His rise in law w r as rapid, and
at the comparatively early age of 30 years, or 15 years after arriving in South Australia
as a boy. he entered upon his Parliamentary career. In the stormy battles of the period
he was destined to play a bold hand, and fortunately his astuteness was proportionate to
his courage. He was elected to the House of Assembly for Adelaide in December. IS6I,
upon the resignation of the late Sir R. I). Hanson. But Mr. Justice Boucaut s career
was at first chequered, and it was only the determination and enthusiasm of the man that
ensured him a lengthened political life. He was defeated by Mr. Bakewell at the geneial
election in November, 1862. In March, 1865, he was returned tor West Adelaide at the,
head of the poll, although he was one of a very few candidates w r ho refused to support
Goyder’s valuations, then considered infallible throughout the Province. His ability was
already known, for on the day alter his election he was offered, and he declined, the
portfolio of Attorney-General, vice Mr. Stow, defeated for the District of \ ictoria, in the
Government of Sir Henry Ayers. He sat until the dissolution in March, 1868, when he
sought the suffrages of the Burra electors, and was returned. At the general election in
March, 1870, he was rejected ; but in August. 1871, he re-entered Parliament as member for
West Torrens, in succession to Mr. Strangways, being re-elected at a general election in
December, 1871 ; in 1875 he became the representative for Encounter Bay, and re-elected
in 1878. He was thus the chosen, at different periods, of five constituencies; and the
circumstance is explained by the topsy-turveydom of politics in those days.
When Sir J. P. Boucaut declined the Attorney-Generalship in the Ministry of
Sir Henry Ayers, he showed an example which is not always followed in Australian
legislative circles. He had attacked the Government policy on the hustings, and, in
consideration of the vote of his electors and of his own conscience, he could not accept
the portfolio. Although at this time he had been known in Parliament for only a year,
when the Ayers Government resigned in October, 1865, he was largely instrumental in
forming an administration under the nominal leadership of Mr. Hart. Sir James took the
portfolio of Attorney-General, and in March, 1866. on Mr. Harts departuie for England,
became Premier, an unusual dignity indeed for one who had passed so short a time in
Parliament. But he was “ a consummate Parliamentary manager, and a bold and far-seeing
statesman.” Review of Reviews. Much useful legislation was initiated by the Government
which he led, and for a time there was a lull in the political strife. Previous Governments
had been principally occupied in no-confidence debates, and. as a consequence, few good
measures were placed on the Statute Book. The state of affairs had been so strained
that at a public demonstration, a resolution was carried animadverting severely on the


scramble for office by members,” which was declared to be “ calculated to bring into
contempt our present system of government.” But Sir James apparently allayed the
discord, and with his colleagues—Sir Arthur Blyth, Sir William Milne, Mr. Duffield, and
Mr. English, enjoyed a peaceful • reign until May 2, 1867, when Sir Henry Ayers
returned to power. Ihe out-going administration, with Mr. Hart, and then Sir J. P.
Boucaut, at its head, was the longest-lived since that of Sir R. I). Hanson —1857-60.
L pon his retirement, Sir James was offered a 0.C.-ship., but declined that honor, as he
did several offers of office in succeeding governments.
cai s i iiow ing were fraught with big results ; and although the old turmoil
was revived, legislation was carried which very greatly and beneficially affected the future of
the Province. io this result Sir J. P. Boucaut, although not in power, largely contributed.
Mr. Strangways succeeded Sir Henry Ayers as Premier, and his Cabinet so amended the land
laws that an immense tract of country was added to the agricultural areas. This was in
the Middle North, where the grain output added enormously to the fame of South Australia
in that direction, led to a migration of farmers from the lower and older districts, and
caused a great wave of prosperity to sweep over the Province. Immigration was heartily
encouraged for a time, and public works on a big scale were projected. It must not be
supposed that these beneficent measures were carried without a struggle. The men who
1 ramed them were fought inch by inch, and an astonishing amount ot rancour was aroused.
Despite frequent requests, Sir J. P. Boucaut remained out of office until 1872.
c \ cai he had moved a vote of want of confidence in the Hart Ministry,
which caused its members to resign, and Sir James was asked to form a Cabinet. Upon
his refusal, Sir Henry Ayers, and then Sir Arthur Blyth, were sent for. The last
gentleman went into office, but in keeping with the spirit of the hour, he was ousted
about two months later. Under the name of the Ayers Government, a new Ministry was formed
in January, 1872, by Mr. Hughes and Sir Henry Ayers, with the assistance of Sir James, “to
establish the principle that the Governor was not entitled absolutely to say that the framer of
the Government should necessarily be its head.’ In March Sir Janies retired, and he did not
again sit on the Treasury benches until June 3, 1875, when he once more assumed the
position ol Premier, having defeated Sir Arthur Blyth. Sir James propounded a policy
so bold and comprehensive that it will not readily be forgotten in the Province. It was
the most celebrated feature in his political career. Ihe vital questions of the day
referred to immigration, to education, to public works, and to finance. The opening up
ot the northern agricultural areas under the Strangways Land Act had already proved
highly beneficial, but the supply of labor was so limited, that large sums were voted by r
Parliament in aid of assisted and free immigration. The finances were in such a condition
that any attempt to incur further liabilities was opposed most vigorously. The trend of
public opinion was nervous of a big expenditure, and yet the growing interests of the
Province seemed to demand the projection of large public works. The Education Act
was confused, and a proposal to place the system on an equality with that of some of
the othei colonies was supported and opposed according to the divergent views
of the people. Ihe Boucaut Ministry, says Mr. Edwin Hodder in his “ History of
South Australia,” “brought in an Education Bill which skilfully embodied the views of


the majority of the community.” It substituted for a Central Board of Education, a
Council, provided for a responsible Minister, demanded that education should be
compulsory in districts proclaimed by the Governor, and made education free to all
unable to pay fees. This measure, when finally adopted by Parliament, ushered in the
excellent and advanced educational system which at present obtains in South Australia.
The part of the Premier’s policy which attracted the most attention in this and the
other colonies was expounded on September 28, 1875. To the astonishment of the people,
Sir James proposed to borrow sterling for public works construction, accompanied
by direct taxation to meet the resultant expenditure. Ot this immense amount the sum of
,£2,290,000 was to be “appropriated to the construction of 550 miles of railway, intended
to open up the Par North, tap the Murray River at the North-West Bend ; form the
first section in a line connecting Adelaide and Sydney by way of the mineral country
O J J J J *
beyond the Burra and the pastoral land of the Barrier Ranges ; complete the means of
communication with the seaboard required by residents in the rich agricultural areas under
cultivation in the North ; and furnish the people of Mount Gambler, in the South-Eastern
district, with proper facilities for reaching a port available in all weathers —(Hodder).
The remainder of the loan was lor harbors, jetties, school-houses, and other necessary works.
Probably never in the history of Australia up to this time had such a daringly
progressive policy been proposed by any Government. Sir James knew that all these
suggested railway lines were required, and would greatly tend to the general prosperity ;
but he was not foolish enough to saddle the Province with so heavy a debt without
seeking to provide for the payment of interest by directly calling for the help of the
community. A Stamp Duties Bill had previously passed the Assembly to secure the
means to pay the interest on the proposed loan, and to meet an expected deficiency in
the finances ; but, on the very same day that this great public works scheme was
announced, the Legislative Council threw out the measure. Parliament was prorogued,
and during a short recess the people indicated by resolutions and memorials that they
approved of Sir James’ programme. Parliament re-assembled on November 10, and two
days later the Government again introduced into the Assembly the Stamp Duties Bill, as
well as three measures referring to railways and other public works. Ihe I axation Bill
passed the Lower House almost without a division, but was again defeated in the Council,
on this occasion by a majority of only one vote. Public indignation against that Chamber
was aroused, and suggestions for its amendment were made. But it was already so late
in the year that the Government abandoned its Railways and Public Works Bills, and
Parliament was prorogued after such measures as an Intercolonial bree 1 rade Bill, a
Forests Bill, and a Rabbit Bill had been carried. In the 1876 session the Government
introduced a new Public Works Bill, but as the Cabinet had been weakened by the
elevation of the Attorney-General, Mr. S. J. Way, to the office of Chief Justice, and by
the retirement of other members, a vote ot no confidence was carried by Sir John Colton
on June 1. This defeat was said to be caused by political log-rolling, and by the Premier’s
refusal to borrow money without making provision to pay the inteiest. Had Sll James
been permitted to have his way the progress of South Australia would ha\e been greatly 7
facilitated. The country proposed to be traversed by his lines now has railway connection


268
The Ministry of Sir John Colton, who had retired from the Boucaut Cabinet early in
1876, and whose conduct in subsequently attacking his former chief was the subject of much
adverse comment, held office from June, 1876, to October, 1877. It succeeded in carrying part
ot Sir James’ own scheme. After the defeat of the Colton Government, Sir James Boucaut
formed a new and stable Ministry. The finances were still in an unsatisfactory condition, and
J J
amongst the most important proposals of this Government were property and income taxes.
The latter was not agreed to ; but the former, providing for a tax of threepence in the pound
on property above in value, was carried. In 1878 the Premier consented to join the
Judiciary.
As a politician he had distinguished himself by intrepidity and inflexibility, and
to him must be ascribed the credit for much of the prosperity of South Australia during
succeeding years. His able, enlightened, and progressive proposals were drawn up under the
conscientious belief that they were the very best under the circumstances ; and that he was
right has since been abundantly proved. In formulating his schemes he looked beyond the
present and reckoned largely on their influence over the future. As a statesman Sir fames
was distinguished, and one critic doubts whether "his genius is more distinctly legal or
political.”
Mr. Justice Boucaut has succeeded as ably in the Judiciary as in Parliament. In recent
times Sir Samuel Griffiths, in Queensland, is the only other Australian politician who from
the front of the fray went direct to the dignified quietude of the Bench ; and both gentlemen
were eminently prominent in and useful to their respective Colonies. Mr. Justice Boucaut
has now borne the cares of a puisne Judge for over 20 years, and the warrior of the old
days is transformed. Those who had known him in Parliament predicted that he would
soon tire of the Bench, and "for some years at every election the rumor was spread that
the Judge was going to buckle on his discarded armor, and once more fight the battles
of his country in Parliament.” But he has refused to be enticed away from his dignified
position on the Bench, although his friends think that a seat in the Federal Parliament
might tempt him; and, continues the Review of Reviews, "he would only have to ask to
have, when the time comes.” In regard to his conduct as a Judge, the same writer says
that, “ bearing in mind the adage that the law is a jealous mistress, he has sedulously
devoted almost the whole of his time and learning to his judicial duties . . . Judge
Boucaut is an acknowledged master of the Common Law. He is as pronounced as he is
learned upon all matters affecting the liberty of the subject, and his judgments upon all such
questions speak with trumpet tongue in support of the rights of all sections of the community.’’
From October 26 to November 13, 1885, and from February to to February
27, 1886, Sir James Boucaut administered the Government during the absence of Sir
W. C. F. Robinson ; and from January 16 to March 11, 1890, as also from February 27
to May 23, 1891, he occupied the same high office while the Earl of Kintore was out of
the Province. A few years ago he made a tour round the world, and the instructive and
entertaining articles he supplied to a local newspaper are well remembered by the public.
Those who heard him speak at a banquet of the Cornish Society in 1890 were treated
to a delightful display of eloquence, which stirred the very depths of memorv of many
J * 3 J
patriotic and devoted sons of the ancient county. Sir James Penn Boucaut was
decorated with the K.C.M.G.-ship in January, 1898.

Hon. Wi]l i am Hen ry Bn n dey , « J m k e °f the Supreme court
THE Judges of the Supreme Court of South Australia past and present —have been
men of such high standard that it is impossible to discriminate concerning their
comparative supremacy. Beginning with the first Judge, Sir J. W. Jeffcott, who in
1837 was drowned in the rollers of Encounter Bay, while striving to prove his pet theory
that on the shores of that historical
locality the capital of the Province
should be established, every
occupant of the high office has
been more or less famous either
for his excellent interpretations
and expoundings of the law, or
for his claims to the title of an
honorable citizen, and a colonist
of grit and utility. The list
embraces some of the most note-
worthy men in South Australian
J
history.
J
Each of the present members
of the Bench won a meritorious
reputation as an advocate, and
each had previously served as a
colonial Minister under the Crown
In this latter respect, Mr. lustice
Boucaut and Mr. Justice Bundey
obtained larger experience than
the president of their court, the
RiMit Hon. Sir S. ]. Wav, Bart. It
J j
can be recorded of them all, how-
ever, that they have distinguished
themselves at the Bar, in the
political arena, upon the Bench,
and as private citizens.
Mr. Justice Bundey was born in 1838; his father, the late Mr. James Bundey,
was a gentleman farmer; and the family resided at Bashley Manor, neat Leamington,
England, where they experienced severe reverses of fortune, and in consequence left
England in 1848 for South Australia. Ihe head of the family died within a fortnight
of his arrival in this Province. Mr. W. H. Bundey, after serving his articles to the
law, was admitted to practice at the South Australian bar in Apiil, 1865. lie quickly
found that he had entered a congenial sphere for the application of his talents. He


steadily advanced in the profession, and in 1878 was made a Queen’s Counsel. As a
criminal pleader and an advocate, he was almost unrivalled in the Province. One
competent critic says of him that he “ was probably as fine a speaker as we have had
in South Australia, and a specially dangerous antagonist before a jury.’’ His genius, the
writer continued, was perhaps distinctly forensic; and it was thus that he first acquired
popularity. His practice became extensive, and he earned it in many sturdily fought
battles. He gripped his cases with a strong hand, and whether in cross-examinations or
in his addresses to the jury, he was recognised as a master.
One of the best examples in this respect was in the case of Captain Cameron, a
fine old Scotchman, whose ship, Lightning , ran ashore near Troubridge Lighthouse.
A number of passengers were on board, and the captain was prosecuted for the
misdemeanor of endangering their lives. Mr. Bundey and the late Mr. Dempster
defended him ; and the blame, if any, was proven not to have rested with the captain.
One ot the other officers of the ship will not readily forget the cross-examination to
which he was subjected. In his address for the defence, Mr. Bundey placed the captain’s
conduct and his previous career in such a light before the jury, that, when asked for
their verdict, they rose as one man, and said “Not guilty ” ; and as they filed out of the
jury box they approached to where the captain stood by his counsel, and each of them
shook hands with him. This is probably a unique incident in a Court of Justice.
Seven years after entering into practice, Mr. Bundey yielded to the repeated
requests of residents in the Onkaparinga district, and entered Parliament as their member,
fie sat for that constituency from January, 1872, until the dissolution in January, 1875,
and from May, 1878, until the dissolution in March, 1881. He was thus in Parliament
for nearly six years, for upwards of three of which he held a portfolio. Mr. Bundey was
no political firebrand, he was an acute thinker, and had made a special study of political
economy. He was well able to appraise the ultimate value of legislative measures, and
to recognise the general trend ot public opinion. His speeches in Parliament, and his
lectures on the public platform upon the relations of capital and labor, reform of the
land laws, and other subjects, were particularly impressive. He sought earnestly to
guide the people in “paths which have now become well worn,” and he is credited with
being a pioneer in several directions of public thought then new, but which have since
become established.
A short time after entering Parliament in 1872, Mr. Bundey was offered, but
declined, the portfolio of Attorney-General in the Ayers-Barrow Administration, a post which
was accepted by the late Mr. George Stevenson. In July, 1874, he joined the Government
of Sir Arthur Blyth, and became the first “sixth” Minister in this Province, founding the
political offices of Minister of Justice and Education. He proved himself to be an
administrator thoroughly competent to grasp the details of important public offices, and
he established the departments committed to his charge on harmonious lines. In the
same year (1874) he introduced and carried through the House of Assembly a Bill to
constitute the present Adelaide University, endowing it with a grant of 50,000 acres of
country land and five acres of town land on North Terrace. He also took an active
interest, in November, 1874, in the subject of establishing an advanced school for girls.


He retired from office on March 15, 1875. As showing the sincere interest that he
evinced in educational matters, after retiring: from Parliament early in that year, he
o J *
gratuitously drafted a Bill of 67 clauses entirely altering the then principle on which the
system was conducted, making a Minister of the Crown, instead of a Board, the chief
authority. That principle was soon afterwards adopted by legislation.
Three years of freedom from the toils of Parliamentary life followed, during
which Mr. Bundey was fully occupied in managing his large professional practice; and
then, from September 27, 1878, to March 10, 1881, he served as Attorney-General in the
Morgan Ministry. fie was a hearty law reformer while official head of the legal profession.
Among other measures, he carried through Parliament in 1878 the present Supreme Court
Bill, and in 1880 the Public Trustees Bill. The latter is one of the most useful and successful
legal reforms in the Province, and the department is now returning a handsome revenue.
After a lengthened contest, he also carried through the Assembly a Bill to establish
District Courts, adopting the Local Court practice and bestowing insolvency, matrimonial,
probate, and criminal jurisdictions. Although this measure was carried in the Lower House
by 25 votes to 8, it was lost in the Legislative Council. In 1880 he also carried an Act
to amend the law of insolvency which abolished imprisonment for debt in South Australia.
Mr. Bundey also pointed out, in an address to the working men of Port Adelaide in 1877,
the great reform of the law in England, with respect to masters and servants, which
deprived the courts of power to imprison, for breach of contract, and placed employers
and employed on an equal footing. He advocated a similar law in this Province, and,
when Attorney-General in 1878, rendered valuable aid in having such a measure passed.
A recapitulation of all his work in Parliament and the Cabinet is hardly possible here ;
suffice it to say that, In addition to the important measures mentioned, he strenuously
supported the Hills Railway project in 1878-9, which was carried by the Government of
which he was a member. The Murray Bridge (once called “ Bundey’s P'olly ”), the
construction of which at its present site he carried in the House, determined the route of
the railway to Victoria. During his political career he was an active writer of pamphlets,
which, like his lectures and contributions to debates, were highly appreciated for their
instructiveness.
Finally severing his connection with Parliament in 1881, but not until the title
of “ Honorable ” was conferred upon him, Mr. Bundey made an extensive tour of Europe
and the Orient. His close observation of men and things, and his ready perception of
essentials, enabled him to acquire a full storehouse of information during his travels ; and
on his return to South Australia he published, for private circulation only, a pamphlet
descriptive of what he had seen and observed. His pictures of japan and China, and
the life of their people, were especially attractive, and the privileged readers were able
to glean much interesting information from his literary work.
In 1884 he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court, in succession to the late Mr.
fustice Andrews. At this time his practice was estimated to be woith nearly a
year, and hence he made a considerable pecuniary sacrifice when he accepted the judicial
office. In 1894 Mr. Justice Bundey was appointed the first president of the Board of
Conciliation, under Mr. Kingston s Conciliation Bill, and with the difficulties ot this


newly-created office he was eminently fitted to cope. He retired after holding the office
for 15 months. His reputation on the Bench has been of the highest, and his judgments
have been uniformly satisfactory; and Public, Press, and Bar unite in showing him respect
and esteem. Mr. justice Bundey worthily upholds the traditions of an Fmglish judge.
His qualities were thus summed up in the Review of Reviews (Australian edition, June,
1895):— “His extensive knowledge of shipping and mercantile law renders him an
acknowledged authority in these important branches, both by Bench and Bar ; while theie
are few of Her Majesty’s judges anywhere more deeply read in criminology. To all
questions he brings the best consideration of a trained mind, courageously determined to
get at the truth, and to hold it at all hazards. Mr. Justice Bundey is the idol ol the
Bar, to whom he shows that fine courtesy which the rough and tumble of modern lile
threatens to extinguish, and upon which, in his case, no man dares to presume. Ihe
approval shown by all classes of the community on the occasion of his elevation to the
Bench has been deepened by his conduct during the subsequent sixteen and a half years.
From what has already been written, a conception can be formed of Mr. Justice
Bundey’s intelligence and character. He has a leaning to literary pursuits, for, besides the
booklet and pamphlets mentioned, he has written an interesting work on a favorite pastime
of his, entitled “Yachting in Australia,” a second and more recent publication dealing with
yachting in South Australia, and a brochure relating to the irrigation settlements on the
River Murray. In 1891 he published a pamphlet on the administration of the criminal
law, and in 1893 an essay on the punishment of criminals. In 1899 he published a
work entitled “Conviction of Innocent Men.” With his facile pen and opportunities for
expert knowledge, Mr. Bundey might be expected to compile an authoritative book on
criminology. He has been an active supporter of cricket and yachting; and from 1874
to 1884 was Commodore of the South Australian Yacht Club. He is an expert helmsman,
and has owned and sailed four of the finest boats in the south. He was for six years
captain of the Woodside Rifle Volunteer Company. Mr. Bundey has from time to time
delivered entertaining and instructive lectures to young men. He is one who seeks to
do good work in the w'orld outside his profession, and may fairly claim to exemplify in
his life the truth of his precept to young men, viz., that a love for, and practice of.
outdoor manly sports within proper limits in no way detracts from the proper discharge
of life’s duties.
The late Sir R. D. Ross
island of St. Vincent, in the West Indies, was the birthplace, in 1828, of the late
Sir Robert Dalrymple Ross. He was the son of Mr. Robert D. Ross, and his
mother was a daughter of the Earl of Stirling. His early career was of a military
character, receiving his first commission in the army, April 1, 1856. He arrived in South
Australia in 1862. First elected to Parliament, June 4, 1875, representing Wallaroo, and
subsequently Gumeracha, in the House of Assembly. Became Speaker, June 2, 1881 ; was
Treasurer in the Colton Ministry, 1876-7 ; knighted in May, 1886; died December 27, 1887.

His Honor James George Russell,
Commissioner of Insolvency , Commissioner of Taxes , President of the State Board of
Conciliation , etc
During its history, the Civil Service of South Australia has been manned by some
highly distinguished officers. Because of their splendid work in the organisation
and management of State departments, and because of their many years of
earnest, honorable, and patriotic
service, their names fin d a
prominent and remembered place
in the annals of the Province.
Their work, while probably more
valuable, is not advertised abroad
with the persistence significant of
a politician, and therefore they
do not receive such ephemeral
glorification as does the parlia-
mentarian. But stored in the
archives of the Province are
lasting memorials of their worth.
Among such men the public
services of Mr. Commissioner
Russell have been prominent,
and his integrity and good judg-
ment are highly appreciated, both
by the public service and by the
country generally. He is the
eldest son of the late James
Russell, formerly of Richmond,
Surrey, England ; and was born
in that historical old town in
March, 1848. From early child-
hood the subject of this notice
conceived a strong desire to come
to Australia, and the visit to England of his uncle, the late Mr. George Stacey, from
Victoria, in iB6O, afforded the opportunity of gratifying his wishes. He arrived in South
Australia by the ship Herzog Paul in May, iB6O, being then 12 years of age. For
several years he received tuition at the boarding school then conducted by the late Mr.
E. Planta Nesbit at Angaston. After leaving school and travelling over all the settled
parts of South Australia, Mr. Russell was engaged for a year in gold mining operations
in Victoria. Upon his return, he resided at Wallaroo, where, in 1865, he commenced his
law studies with the late Mr. H. a’Court Bloxam, of the Peninsula, and afterwards


continued them with the legal firm of Messrs. Emerson & Kloxam, completing his
articles wfith Messrs. Burton & Bloxam, who practised at Mount Cambier. In the )ear
1873 he was admitted to practice, and for several years he managed the of the
late Mr. Rupert Ingleby, Q.C.. of Adelaide, with whom he was afterwards associated as
a partner, and conducted business at Port Adelaide.
In 1878 he entered upon that career in the Civil Service which has since been
so distinguished. In March of that year he became Acting Master in the Supreme Court
during the absence on leave of Mr. W. J. Hinde. I pon the latters death, he was
appointed Master, and he performed the duties with eminent success until November,
jBB4. During this period, in addition to the Mastership, he held the minor offices of
Registrar of Companies. Registrar under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act,
Registrar under the Trades Union Act of 1878. and Registrar of the Vice-Admiralty
Court. For about twelve months also he was Acting Registrar ot Probates, and was
subsequently appointed as the first Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Ihe excellence
and usefulness of his work in these respects was accentuated by his services in other
connections. Thus he rendered active service in the preparation of the rules and the
introduction of the Supreme Court Procedure Act of 1878, by which the systems of
common law and equity were fused, one procedure being made common to both systems.
Pie also received praise for his work in conjunction with the present Chief Justice in the
preparation of rules of procedure, at the request ot the Admiralty, for regulating the British
Vice-Admiralty Courts.
In 1884 Mr. Russell relinquished his Supreme Court appointments, and was
appointed Commissioner of Taxes under the Act of that year providing tor the levying
of the land and income taxes. This was the first appointment of the kind in the Province,
and Mr. Russell has been commended for the way in which he organised the immense
work of that new office. On December 6, 1886, his duties were increased by the acceptance
of the office of first Commissioner of Stamps under the Stamps Duties Act. He prepared
the stamp regulations, initiated that Act, and had the whole charge of administering the
stamps duties. In 1889, upon the death of the Hon. Charles Mann, Q.C., who held the
office of Crown Solicitor, that appointment was offered to Mr. Russell. In lieu of accepting
the same, he succeeded to the vacancies which occurred in the same year in the offices ot
Commissioner of Insolvency and Special Magistrate of the Local Court of Adelaide, and
he discharged these new duties while also carrying on the business of Commissioner of
Taxes and Commissioner of Stamps.
He succeeded His Honor Mr. justice Bundey as President of the "State Board
of Conciliation under the Conciliation Act, 1894, and still holds this position with his many
other responsible offices. During the absence of the Right Hon. Sir S. J. Way, Bart.,
Chief justice, in England from March to October in 1897, Mr. Russell performed the
duties of Acting Judge of the Supreme Court. He took an active interest in establishing
the Public School Teachers’ Superannuation PTmcl, and, since the passing ot the Act in
1890. has been a member of the Board of Management of that excellent fund. Mr.
Russell was President of the Public Service Association, and for several years worked hard
274
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY His Honor J. G. Russell


with the late Mr. J. A. Hartley and others in endeavoring to found a superannuation fund
for the whole public service. He has served on many public Boards of Inquiry, and as
Chairman, appointed by the Supreme Court, on the winding up of the Commercial Bank
of South Australia, performed delicate and important duties.
As Commissioner of Insolvency and as Acting Judge, Mr, Russell has added to
the respected name which he so well earned in his numerous other important offices. His
knowledge of the insolvency law is very thorough, and his judgment has been above
reproach. Since taking up these duties he has been called upon to adjudicate in verv
difficult cases, and in these, as in his office of administrator of the land and income tax,
his findings have given general satisfaction. Mr. Russell has a keen, analytical mind and
safe powers of discrimination. He is able to quickly grasp large and intricate problems
and to reduce them to simple issues. There are few members of the South Australian
Civil Service bearing such honorable records as his. and few enjoy such general regard
and esteem.
Mr. I. M. Stuart, 0.C., Crown Solicitor
JAMES MARTIN STUART was born at Aberdeen, New Zealand, on September 20,
1834. He was educated in his native village, and served in the Imperial Post-
office in the South Island for four years prior to the establishment of local government.
In 1854 he removed to Victoria. For a short period young Stuart connected himself with
banking affairs. He came to South Australia in 1861. and became a State school teacher.
When 36 years of age he was courageous enough to apply himself to the study of law.
In 1870 he took articles from Sir j. P. Boucaut, and in 1875, at the age of 41, was
admitted as a barrister, joining the firm of Boucaut & Bruse. Soon after Sir f. P. Boucaut’s
elevation to the Bench, Mr. Stuart accepted the positions of justice of the Peace, Special
Magistrate of the Local Court of Adelaide, and Commissioner of Insolvency. He occupied
these positions with credit until 1889, when he was appointed Crown Prosecutor and Crown
Solicitor. Mr. Stuart has acted temporarily as Commissioner of Patents, Commissioner of
Trade Marks, and Solicitor to the Lands Titles Department, in the absence of Mr. Turner,
the permanent holder of these offices. Mr. Stuart was made a O.C. in 1900.
Notwithstanding that he was 40 years of age before entering into the practice of
his present profession, Mr. Stuart must be said to have had a bright career. It must be
exceedingly gratifying to himself to know that his courage has been so well rewarded
and his success so substantial in law. He is a man of great industry, and one who can
begin a wrestle with some abstruse problem with a smile. His demeanor is dignified and
thoughtful, and there are few more familiar figures at the Law Courts than his. His is a
remarkable life, and one worthy of commendation and emulation.

Right Rev. I K . Harmer, D.D., Anglican Bishop of Adelaide
A LLSTRALLY during its history, has provided a scene of labor for several notable
Bishops of what is known as the Anglican Church, whose names are affectionately
treasured in the memory of colonists. Many are the stories told concerning
them—their exploits in the bush, their wit, and their great heartedness. These reverend
gentlemen have been essentially
manly, and, as such a term is
understood by bushmen, no more
flattering compliment could be
paid them. The duties of an
Australian Church dignitary in no
way resemble those of his brother-
workers in England. In the
colonies he has to travel long-
distances by train and coach and
on horseback. He has often been
lost in the monotonous and melan-
choly bush, and has sometimes
endured some hardship before
being rescued. He must be
as strong physically as he is
spiritually, for his lonely journeys
sometimes extend for hundreds of
miles through sparsely - settled
country; and when he reaches
his destination, he ministers to
perhaps but a modest score or so
of settlers. Indeed, he must be
brave and earnest, good-humored
and long-suffering.
It is because of their earnest-
ness, their sturdiness when
“roughing it” (as bush travelling and fare is termed), and their manly sermons suitable
to the people, that these Australian prelates have become popular and beloved. On
remote stations many scores of miles from the nearest township one is told in happy
words divers stories ot Bishops Moorhouse, Short, and Julius. A great churchman,
when he answers to the bushman’s ideal of manliness, has a substantial and lasting influence
over the hitter s mind.
Although his sojourn in South Australia has been comparatively short, we have
no hesitation in declaring that the present Bishop of Adelaide, the Right Rev. Dr. Harmer,


has already endeared himself to the people. Owing to the advance of settlement, the
development ol country once remote, and the improved means of transit, he has not been
called upon to undertake such arduous journeys as some of his predecessors ; and yet,
wheiever he has gone in this extensive Province, he has made a good impression upon
the bronzed, hardy, and critical resident, whether the denizen of a township or a
backwoodsman. Dr. Harmer is young and energetic, and thoroughly earnest and sincere
in his desire to serve his flock. He has so judged Australian character that he immediately
places those with whom he converses at their ease, and shows them that he is a friend,
and not a critic with the curling lip.
John Reginald Harmer was born at Maisemore, near Gloucester, England, 43
years ago. After a happy preparation period at Eton, he proceeded to King’s College,
Cambridge, where he was destined to pursue a brilliant career. In 1878, his first year,
he became Bell Scholar, which, though confined to sons of the clergy, alwavs ranks hip'll
<“*> J j O
among the distinctions open to the younger students at the University. This scholarship
has been achieved by' such illustrious men as Alford, of Greek Testament fame ; Kennedy',
senior classic ; Thirwell, the historian ; Holder, senior classic ; Butler, master of Trinity
and late headmaster of Harrow; and Weldon, headmaster of Harrow. Then in 1881 he
was Parus Prizeman, and Evans and Scholefield Prizeman. For the uninitiated it may be
J
explained that the former is obtained for the accurate study of the Greek Testament, and
the latter for the critical study of Holy Writ. In 1881, also, he was fifth in the first
class for the Classical Tripos, and two years later in the Theological Tripos, thus winning
what is known as a “ Double First a very distinguished record indeed. In the
following year he took his M.A. degree, and in 1885 the M.A. ad eundem at Durham
University. Such were the distinguished scholaristic exploits of Dr. Harmer at the
University. Among his fellows he was regarded as a rising man in the Church, and a
brilliant classical scholar and theologian.
In 1883 Dr. Harmer was ordained a Deacon, and in the following- year a Priest
O J
From 1883 to 1889 he was a Fellow of King’s College, Cambridge, and from 1883 to
1884 he was curate of Monkwearmouth. He was Domestic Chaplain to the Bishop of
Durham, the late Dr. Lightfoot, from 1884 to 1889. While fulfilling the duties
appertaining to this latter office, he was drawn into close relationship with the venerable
and talented Bishop, and obtained a considerable knowledge of his life and studious
nature. In 1889 he edited, for Macmillan & Co., “The Apostolic Fathers,” and other of
Dr. Lightfoot’s posthumous works. To this severe task he brought a discriminating-
O
judgment and extensive erudition ; and the books have proved of great value to Churchmen.
During these years Dr. Harmer had been rising more and more in general favor. Both
in the pulpit, and in his other numerous duties, he evinced much earnestness and
singleness of purpose. He became a P'ellow of Corpus Christ! College, and Examining-
Chaplain to Dr. Westcott, Dr. Lightfoot’s successor in the Bishopric of Durham, in
1890; and in 1891 he was made vice-principal of the Cambridge Clergy Training School.
At Westminster Abbey, on May 1, 1895, Dr. Harmer was consecrated Bishop
of Adelaide, in succession to Dr. Kennion, translated to the English See of Bath and
Wells; and on July 2of the same year, he arrived in this Province. It might be
303
Right Rev.J. R. Harmer ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


considered by some that one so distinguished in scholarly attributes would find it
difficult to identify himself with the conditions peculiar to a new country. Away from the
great centres of learning and congenial association with men of proved talent, the scholar
is apt to be depressed, unless he have some specially engrossing work to perform. Di.
Harmer quickly appraised Australian aspirations and the spirit of the colonist, and he
entered sympathetically into his new work. From the centre of learning he came to what
J m. - « •
is indeed an isolated, and not specially intellectual, community. In his own sphere, he is
copying the work of the colonist, and, divested of the pomp and circumstance of Church
life in England, he has become a colonist in Church matters in South Australia. He has
travelled extensively in the Province among the inland townships, on the desert track,
and in the remote bush ; and everywhere he has made new friends in his efforts to push
the work of his Church. Dr. Harmer is a cultured preacher, and his sermons are bright
and courageous, hopeful and ambitious, as is the colonist himself. St. Peters Cathedral
at North Adelaide is visited by large congregations, who listen attentively to his discourses,
which are always marked by earnestness and sincerity.
Since his arrival in South Australia he has visited England to attend the Lambeth
Conference. After an absence of eight months he returned to his southern field of labor
in February, 1898. Bishop Harmer married, on January 3, 1895, Dorothy, daughter of
the late Arthur Herbert Somers-Cocks, C.8., 8.C.5., of London. Of Dr. Harmer, as
showing his adaptability to the work he has chosen, it may be said that his life has
undergone a complete transformation in its conditions, and that members of the Church of
England in South Australia are the gainers.
Rev. James Jefferis, LL.D.
JAMES JEFFERIS was born at Bristol, Somerset, on April 4, 1833. His earlier
education was received at a grammar school in Bristol. He subsequently studied at
New College, London, affiliated with the London University. In 1855, Dr. Jefferis
graduated in Arts, and in the following year took the Bachelor Degree in Law, subsequently
graduating as LL.D. in Sydney University. He was ordained in 1858 as pastor of Saltaire
Conereeational Church, in Yorkshire, but in the following year removed to North Adelaide,
South Australia, where for 18 years he labored vigorously and successfully as preacher,
lecturer, and pastor. A lasting memorial of the influence exerted by Dr. Jefferis is seen
in the Universitv of Adelaide. In 1872, whilst Dr, Jefferis was Professor of Ecclesiastical
History, Union College, Adelaide, a sum of ,£20.000 was offered by Mr. W. Watson Hughes
as an endowment. At the suggestion of Dr. Jefferis, both the Council of the College and
the donor consented to devote the money to the foundation of a University instead of to
the purpose originally intended. Sir Thomas Elder gave another £"20,000, the Government
provided an endowment of £"2,400 per annum and 50,000 acres of land, and thus a
flourishing University arose, chiefly through the wise forethought and disinterested effort
of many citizens, of which Dr. Jefferis was not the least. In 1877, and for the next 13
years, the scene of the Doctor’s labors was in Sydney, New South Wales. In December.
1889, Dr. Jefferis returned to England, but came back to South Australia in 1894 to resume
the pastorate of his old Church at North Adelaide.

Most Revel end John O Reily, 0.0., Roman Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide
THE Roman Catholic Church, from the early foundation of the several colonies of
Australia, has been a most powerful religious denomination in these parts, and its
success is to be ascribed to the ability and pious zeal of its clergv, as well as to
the liberal enthusiasm of its adherents. In the infantile stages of the history of a colony,
when many difficulties and vicissi-
tudes had to be sternly faced, and
with little pecuniary recompense,
ministers of the Roman Catholic
faith carried on their work with
surprising vigor. The name of
Archbishop O’Reily is inseparably
connected with the growth of the
Roman Catholic Church in
Western and South Australia.
Few ministers of his or any
Church have devoted themselves
so earnestly and energetically to
the advancement of Christian in-
terests in the Australian colonies.
John O’Reily (now Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide)
was born in November, 1846,
in Kilkenny, Ireland. His
elementary instruction was received
in the Catholic parochial boys’
school in St. John’s Parish of
Kilkenny. In January, 1858, he
entered St. Kieran’s College,
Kilkenny, where he laid the
foundations of a comprehensive
study in classics, science, and
history. His powers of retention equalled his application. Ideas, words, phrases, and
whole quotations could be summoned up promptly in the memory when necessity demanded
them. But it was not classics alone in which the future Archbishop revelled. Knowing and
well perceiving the swift and rushing growth of scientific knowledge, O’Reily cultivated a
close acquaintance with this ever-growing department of human knowledge. Exhaustive
insight into the method of operations and results of science enabled him to balance more
effectually the consequent inferences and hypotheses with the deductions and conclusions
that centuries of close Scriptural study had presented to the spiritual world for guidance.
After six and a half years of incessant scholastic study at St. Kieran’s College, the


Archbishop moved to All Hallow’s College, Dublin, in September, 1864. At this time
this celebrated institution enjoyed the reputation of being the largest purely missionary
college in the world in connection with the Roman Catholic Church. At the time o
the Archbishop’s entrance there were no fewer than 300 resident students in the college.
One year in this advanced hall of learning was spent in the study of Mental Philosophy,
and four more were subsequently absorbed in forming a more intimate and deeper
acquaintance with theological knowledge. In June, 1869, the Archbishop was ordained a
priest, and a few weeks later he left Ireland for Perth, in Western Australia. I here
existed in that then little-known Province a wide field for the future Archbishops labors,
for Western Australia was then still the “Cinderella” of the Australian group. It had
no pretensions then to development beyond a haphazard and precar 1011s tillage of the
soil: all its potentialities were crude and latent. It Father O’Reily in anticipation conjured
up a mental vision of rich oriental vegetation luxuriantly clothing the shores and slopes
of his place of disembarkation, he must have been woefully disappointed when his ship
arrived off the sandy beach of Fremantle. There was no fine harbor there then. He
could have been as little enchanted as was Darwin in his voyages round the world with
the deserted, cheerless prospect afforded by the coast of Western Australia. In those days
it was especially depressing in its sandy barrenness of aspect, and Father O Reily probably
felt it was small matter for wonder that the country to which he had come was not a
popular Province. But landscapes did not concern the reverend Father to a degree likely
to affect his inclinations for the work he was about to take up. He was first stationed
at Perth ; and here he remained for some time to enable him to acclimatise and adapt
himself to the new life that spread itself before him. hor a brief interval, bather O Reily
had charge of Newcastle and Northam, now two well-known agricultural centres, but then
mere hamlets. Thence he was transferred to the charge of Fremantle, where he remained
for the rest of his term in Western Australia. During his residence in the West, Archbishop
O’Reily, in addition to the discharge of his ordinary parochial duties, did much for the
advancement of the Catholic press. In 1874 the Western Australian Record , a journal
published in the interests of the Roman Catholic body, was founded in Perth through the
energy of Bishop Gibney, then Vicar-General of the diocese. For this organ bather
O’Reily wrote the first leading article, and he remained an active contributor to its
columns until he left the Colony for South Australia. His journalistic abilities, though
they suffered somewhat from restriction to the main ends the journal had in view, were
of a hieff order, and reflected a talent that only required exercise for its full development.
<“!>
One of the decisions of the Plenary Council of Australasia in 1885 was that of
petitioning the Holy See for the establishment of fresh dioceses in Australia; and one of
the centres chosen as a seat for an episcopate was Port Augusta, in South Australia.
For this See, Father O’Reily was recommended, and in course of time was duly nominated
by Propaganda. The diocese comprises the northern portion of South Australia proper,
together with a strip one degree of latitude in width belonging to the Northern I erritory.
The area of the diocese is 370,000 square miles, and the Roman Catholic population in that
district in 1891 numbered 11,156, a proportion of one Catholic to every 33 square miles,
while the whole population of his See did not exceed 53,184. During His Lordship’s
eight years of episcopate, considerable progress was made. In 1889 there were 7 parochial
306
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Most Rev, J. O’Reily


districts, with 14 priests, 28 churches, and 7 presbyteries. In the beginning of 1895
there were 9 districts, 15 priests, 29 churches, and 8 presbyteries. In 1889 there
were 610 children in the schools; in 1893 there were 875. In 1889 there were 6
convents, with 15 nuns, besides ir lay teachers and 11 primary schools. In 1893 there
were 8 convents, with 31 nuns, besides 9 lay teachers, primary schools, and 1 high
school. These figures exhibit a considerable expansion in the progressive cause of the
Roman Catholic religion —an expansion which is to be ascribed chiefly to the efforts of
the Bishop. His labors, so prolific of happy results and timely issues in the Port Augusta
Diocese, were soon, however, to be transferred to a higher sphere of exercise ; and the
parting must have conjured up prominently in the memories of his (lock the amount of
valuable work he had done for them and among them.
By Papal decree, dated January 5, 1895, Dr. O’Reily was transferred to the
Archiepiscopal See of Adelaide, rendered vacant by the demise of Archbishop Reynolds.
In March of the same year Dr. O’Reily took up his new exalted position. But, however
hiofh and honorable this See may have been, it was wofully embarrassed with debt. But
O J J
the Archbishop proved equal to the efforts required to establish the finances of the See on
a stable basis. The liabilities at the date of his appointment amounted to no less than
£57,000. His first essay consisted in summoning a general meeting of the Catholic laity
of the city and suburbs, to put before them a statement of affairs and to arrange with
them a plan of operations for the liquidation of this heavy debt. Since that Conference
the Archbishop has been hard at work at his scheme, and his efforts to diminish the debt
have been well seconded by the clergy and laity. In connection with the old accounts, up
to March 31, 1900, an additional outlay of ,£29,254 had to be incurred. 'Phis carried the
total liabilities to over ,£86,000. The moneys raised between the two periods of March
31, 1895. and March 31, 1900, totalled the handsome sum of ,£105,510 3s. 4d. 1 hus the
original liability was brought down within that short period to £22,102 6s. 2d., and meanwhile
O *
the current expenditure of the diocese was being satisfactorily met by current revenue.
Every department of the Church received Dr. O’Reily’s fostering care ahd tutelage.
He introduced into the Province, and established at Glen Osmond, the Passionist Fathers,
an order of priests devoted to the popular services known as missions ; also the Marist
Brothers, members of the teaching order who have recently taken charge of upper and
primary schools at Port Adelaide. Owing to his initiative, a community of the Dominican
Fraternity has been established at North Adelaide, and a company of sisters of one of the
Nursing Orders of the Church has taken charge of the Private Hospital on Strangways
Terrace in the same part of the capital. Within the Church, Dr. O’Reily has formed one
of its greatest pillars. He is an indefatigable worker, never allowing his studious enthusiasm
for a moment to forsake him m the mundane world, while at the same time, with the ardor
of the days of college life, the learned doctor can plunge into the beauties of classic lore
or make a pleasurable excursion into the limitless domain of philosophy. Nobly pious his
life has ever been, its unfailing utility in rendering altruistic services to his brethren and
his adherents standing out prominently in the record ol his past performances. Kindly and
magnanimous, with a whole-hearted love for those in whose spiritual interest he labors,
Archbishop O’Reily is a conspicuous ornament of the Church to which he belongs, and
which he so ably and zealously serves. T

The late Sir Thomas Elder, G.C.M.G.
THE late Sir Thomas Elder was born at Kirkcaldy, Scotland, in 1818, Leaving
school as a youth, he received a thorough education in mercantile pursuits, Latterly
he represented, with his father (the late George Elder), the firm of A. L. Elder
and Co., established by his brother (A. L. Elder) in Adelaide in 1841. This business
was the forerunner of Elder,
Smith, & Co., now one of the
largest commercial houses in Aus-
tralia. Sir Thomas came to South
Australia as a partner in the
original firm, which, after some
changes, resolved itself into Elder,
Smith, & Co., Mr. R. Barr Smith
early joining Sir Thomas in the
sole proprietary. 1 hus early the
firm launched out into almost every
department of colonial industry
especially the pastoral, which was
thoroughly and vigorously de-
veloped. Millions and millions
of acres were leased, and many
thousands of pounds were spent
in sinking wells and tanks, in both
of which Mr. Thomas Elder was
the pastoralist most largely en-
gaged, and in tank-sinking by
machinery he was the pioneer in
South Australia. After exploring
parties had penetrated the interior
wilderness and reached the ocean
in North Australia, he took up
areas reckoned in thousands of
square miles. On many of these
isolated stations moderate fortunes were expended, but substantially the pastoral investments
were remunerative, and helped to build up the large capital so meritoriously earned. At
Paratoo 3,000 square miles were occupied ; at Beltana, 900 square miles ; and at
Umberatana, Mount Lyndhurst, and Blanchewater, 3,000 square miles. Sir Thomas was
a large supporter of the agricultural and horticultural industries, and his gardens at Birksgate,
Glen Osmond, and Mount Lofty were models of their kind.
The success of the copper mines at the Kapunda and the Burra gave Sir Thomas
great faith in the mineral resources of the Province, and in connection with the Wallaroo


and Moonta Mines, the firm of Elder, Smith, & Co. will always be remembered as the
financiers who supplied the necessary capital for the initial working of the now famous
leases which have contributed so largely to the material progress of South Australia. In
the North-East, and also at Port Lincoln and Franklin Harbor, the firm sank considerable
money in testing the mineral resources.
1 hrough the commercial pursuits of Elder, Smith, & Co., and by his private enter-
prise, Sir 1 homas became possessed of a fortune, in the distribution of which he was a great
benefactor. Foremost in national importance were his services to exploration and geographical
science. In 1861 he introduced camels for exploration and commercial purposes; and in
1872 he defrayed the cost of a preliminary exploration by the veteran Major Warburton.
In 1873, after the Government had abandoned a proposal to equip an overland party, Sir
1 homas Elder, in conjunction with Sir W. \V. Hughes, provided the whole of the funds
for the dispatch of Warburton. This expedition is noteworthy, for it was to pass over
the deserts separating South Australia from the western coast, and it greatly dispelled the
erroneous impression of the existence of a large sheet of water in interior Australia. It
was on April 15, 1873, that Major Warburton, with 17 camels and six men, including
a native named Charlie, set out from Alice Springs on their dreary journey, and, ' after
terrible privations, reached Oakover River, on the north-west coast of Western Australia, on
December 4, 1873. Thus was the continent bisected from south to north, and from east
to west. Warburton owed his life to the camels, the faithfulness of his party, and to the
ingenuity of the native boy Charlie. When, in 1873, W. C. Gosse sought to cover the
deserts south of Warburton’s track, Sir Thomas fitted out his expedition with camels; but
Gosse had to turn back after he had reached the Western Australian border. Other
parties were supplied by Sir Thomas with camels about this time, the chief amongst them
being that of the intrepid Ernest Giles, the third explorer to cross the central deserts to
the western seaboard. On August 24, 1875, Giles left Ouldabinna, and struck a south-west
course for Perth, a route still further south of Sir John Forrest (1874) and Warburton.
Giles staked his life on the issue; and again the camels were a supreme factor, for on
one occasion they travelled 325 miles without water. With the same animals Giles returned
to South Australia by a more northerly route. But Sir Thomas did not rest satisfied
J J
with the discoveries of these pathfinders. His firm had large tracts of other country
explored by men whose journals do not find a place in history. Some 2,000 miles of
territory near the Queensland border were opened up, beside other immense areas in the
centre of South Australia. The last large exploration sent out by Sir I homas Elder was
in 1891 —that led by David Lindsay. This was under the auspices of the Royal
Geographical Society, of whom it was desired by the noble patron that scientific men
of reputation “should form a conspicuous feature of this party, whose first duty was to
attempt to traverse the unknown regions in North and Western Australia between the
tracks of Forrest, Giles, Gosse, and Warburton.” On April 22. 1891, Lindsay and his
men, with 40 camels and six months’ provisions, left Adelaide for the Peake. On reaching
the interior it was found that there had been a long drought, which, as was afterwards
seen, severely militated against the general success of the explorers. Despite this, areas
of new country were passed through, and a track to Dundas in Western Australia was
inspected and marked down as a mineral belt, which soon after became famous by reason


of gold discoveries. It is unnecessary to dwell on the mass of valuable scientific infoimation
given to the world through these expeditions promoted by Sir I homas Elder.
Almost every kind of sport was furthered by Sir I homas, both on land and
sea. He was a former commodore of the old Glenelg Yacht Club, and owned a fine
cutter yacht, the Edith. He was a liberal patron of the turf, and a sportsman in the
true sense of the word. He owned a large stud farm at Morphetville, and several fine
racehorses, with which he won many valuable prizes. He first started his lacing in
May, 1875, and in 1884 he retired, having owned such well known horses as Gang
Forward,” “ Newstead,” “ Maddelina,” “Dunlop,” “ Hortense,” “Guesswork,” “Viceroy,”
and “ Portsea.”
The public benefactions of Sir 1 homas were innumerable. Every chaiitable
institution was helped by him, and in the encouragement of the higher education no one
was more practical. In [874 he gave ,£20,000 towards the endowment and building of
the Adelaide University, which he supplemented in 1884 with ,£IO,OOO, as an endowment
of the medical school attached thereto. He largely aided the formation of the Chair ot Music
in the Adelaide University, and he founded, at the Royal College of Music, London, a
scholarship, under which successive pupils have been sent to England to study. He
presented the City of Adelaide with the handsome Rotunda which stands on the banks
of the Torrens, and was liberal in ensuring the establishment of Zoological Gardens, and
was for years President of the Acclimatisation Society. Sir I homas presented several
valuable animals to the Zoo during his lifetime. He gave ,£2,000 in the interest of
Chalmers Church, Adelaide, and donated large sums in eleemosynary gifts. Ihe National
Gallery, the Museum, the various hospitals, colleges, and benevolent asylums received
his practical sympathy.
Sir Thomas had little liking for public life. He entered the Legislative Council
in 1863, and retired by rotation in 1869: re-entering in 1871, and finally resigned in
1878. Except during that period, he was rarely seen in public life. In 1878 he was
knighted, and in 1887 the distinguished honor of G.C.M.G. was conferred on him the
late Sir Henry Avers heincr the only other South Australian to attain this distinction.
J J O J
From the time of his arrival in South Australia in 1854, Sir 1 homas Elder
paid four visits to England, and in 1878 he went to Europe as Hon. Commissioner from
South Australia to the Paris Exhibition. For several years he lived in strict seclusion
either at Glen Osmond or at Mount Lofty, in each of which he had a handsome residence.
He died on Saturday, March 6, 1897, at the Pinnacle, Mount Lofty, in the
seventy-ninth year ot his age. With him there went the most sincere friend the Province
has had.
A statue is now in course of erection to perpetuate his memory, and has been
subscribed to by residents of South Australia.
Although in life Sir Thomas was celebrated for his philanthropy, his benevolence
did not end there. Not satisfied with the large gifts he made, he set the coping stone

to a noble career when he left the sum of ,£155,000 to be distributed among worthy
institutions, besides directing that the succession duty thereon, amounting to £'15,500,
should be paid out of his estate. Ihe University, which was already so indebted to him, was
awarded the sum of ,£65,000, making ,£95,000 in all which it has received from him. Ihe sum
£"25,000 was apportioned to the National Gallery. His detailed bequests were : —Medical

The late Hon. Sir Arthur Blyth, C.B.
MARCH 21. 1823, was the birthday of Sir Arthur Rlyth. fie was educated at the
King Edward VI. Grammar School, Birmingham. He reached South Australia
with his parents in 1839, who settled in Adelaide. flis father, Mr. William Blyth,
took a prominent part in municipal matters, being a city councillor in 1840. and one of
the city commissioners in 1849. Sir Arthur Blyth first entered public life as representative
of Yatala in the Parliament of 1855, which passed the Constitution Act, giving responsible
government to the Province. In 1857 Sir Arthur represented Gumeracha, which district
returned him at each election, except the one in 1868, till that of 1875, when he was
returned for North Adelaide. During this period he was in upwards of 11 Ministries
(three times Premier), holding office for an aggregate period of 3,247 days—which, up to
Ma,y 31, 1900, had only been exceeded by Right Hon. C. C. Kingston and Hon. T.
Playford. He was twice Chief Secretary, four times Treasurer, twice Commissioner of
Crown Lands, and twice Commissioner of Public Works having had no fewer than 22
'* J
colleagues, a larger number than any other Minister of the Crown in South Australia.
Sir Arthur was a Director of the .South Australian Company, as well as of the National
Bank, a member of the Synod of the Church of England and of the University Council,
and a governor of St. Peter’s College. In 1864 he was gazetted as entitled to permanently
retain the title “ Honorable.” In February, 1877, he was appointed Agent-General, on
the death of Mr. F. S. Dutton. He was knighted in 1877, and made a Companion of
the Order of the Bath in 1886. He died in England on December 7, 1891, having served
his country with dignity, fidelity, and ability.

The late Sir Henry Ayers, G.C.M.G.
WHEN Sir Henry Ayers died on June u, 1897, South Australia lost one of its
most notable men. He was one of those links connecting 1 early days with more
modern times. Sir Henry’s record of service to the State ranks prominently
in the annals of South Australian history. hor 36 years he was a prominent figure in
politics, and for a quarter of a
century he was a moving force
in the country’s government. His
public career began when the
Province was first cradled in
responsible government, and he
was seven times Premier, 11
times a Cabinet Minister, and
for 12 years President of the
Legislative Council.
Sir Henry i\yers was born
J J
at Portsea, England, on May
i, 1821. fie was educated to
the law, and left for South
Australia in 1840, only four years
after the Province’s proclamation.
He followed his profession in
the office of the late Mr. J. H.
Rich man and the late Sir James
Hurtle Fisher, the latter the first
President of the Legislative
Council after it became an elective
body. In April, 1845, Sir Henry
was appointed Secretary of the
South Australian Mining Associa-
tion, and for many years he
discharged the duties appertaining
to this post with admirable business ability. When the Burra Burra Copper Mine was
discovered in April, 1845, he became prominently associated with its interests. He firmly
believed in its value, and invested accordingly. His faith was amply rewarded, and with
enlarged means he was soon engaged in financial pursuits of considerable magnitude.
He earned a reputation as a financier and financial adviser, and as one gifted with
diplomacy, shrewd penetration, and a genuine spirit of enterprise. Right up to the time
of his death Sir Henry was actively interested in financial affairs in South Australia, and
promoted many of the sound trading institutions of to-day. One work of his. of which
he was justly proud, was the Savings Bank. He was a trustee of this institution for 40


years, and was Chairman of the Board for many years, filling the chair, indeed, up to
the time of his decease. In the South Australian Gas Company he was a large shareholder,
and was Chairman of Directors from 1862. He was one of the founders of the Bank of
Adelaide, and acted as a director for a long period. He was also on the directorate of
the Bank of Australasia from 1862 to 1865. In the year 1873 he was appointed a director
ot the South Australian Board of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, and afterwards
chairman—which hitter position he retained until he retired in accordance with the rules of
the society. He was for 35 years Governor of the Botanic Gardens Board ; and of the Old
Colonists Association, which was formed in 1883, Sir Henry was the first President. He
has been known, on occasions when the funds of the society were not sufficient to
meet deserving cases of impecunious pioneers, to put his hands in his own pocket. Sir
Henry showed a deep concern in the matter of education, and was long a member and
Treasurer of the University Council.
In politics, Sir Henry’s public movements were governed by the same keen
discrimination which made him so successful in the commercial world. To go back to the
beginning of his political life means the turning over of numerous pages of an eventful
past. On March 9, 1857, he was elected a member of the first Legislative Council after
responsible government was conceded. At that time the whole Province voted as one
constituency. There were 27 candidates for the 18 seats, and Sir Henry was the youngest
member returned. Plight years later, in 1865, when he retired by effluxion of time, he
was re-elected at the head of the poll, there being then 13 candidates for eight vacancies.
Again, in 1873, he headed the poll out of the 13 candidates who sought the vacant seats.
Not only did Sir Henry top the poll for the whole Province, but also headed the voting
in 15 out of the 18 chief polling districts into which it was divided. Offering- himself again
. O
m 1881, he alone was returned of the six retiring members who stood for re-election,
although he was last on the list. All the old members had been subjected to much hostile
criticism with regard to the reform of the Legislative Council, and true to his principles
right throughout the campaign, Sir Henry had reason to congratulate himself on a victory
carried in the teeth of a stormed citadel. In the session then opened the Constitution
Further Amendment Act, 1881, was carried, and the Province, was divided into four separate
electoral districts. In 1888, Sir Henry and the Hon. J. Warren were chosen as
representatives of the North-Eastern District. He retired in December, 1893, rich in
political laurels, and bearing the kind opinions of his fellow-legislators.
The foregoing is merely the shell of Sir Henry’s political record. Coming to
details, as already stated, he was connected with 11 Ministries, in seven of which he was
the Premier. The first of these was that formed by the late Mr. F. S. Dutton on
July 4, 1863, Sir Henry representing the Government in the Legislative Council without
portfolio. A difficulty arose on account of the Upper House taking strong umbrage at
the Government being represented there by one who held no responsible executive office.
The matter assumed a serious phase when the Council finally determined that it would
not proceed with the business of the country unless its wishes were acceded to by the
appointment of an executive Minister to conduct Government business in that Chamber.
As a consequence, Sir Henry resigned ; and, although it had very heavy support in


the Assembly, the Dutton Ministry collapsed. Ihe political atmosphere at this time
became particularly troubled, and all sorts of constitutional complications and difficulties
beset the then Governor, Sir Dominic Daly; and in his extremity he sent for Sir Henry
Ayers and asked him to form a Ministry. This task Sir Henry successfully accomplished,
and on July 15, 1863, the old Ministry was subjected to a process of re-construction.
The Cabinet (the tenth under responsible government) was composed of Sit Henry Ayers,
Mr. (afterwards Judge) Andrews, and the Hons. J. Hart, L. Clyde, and Philip Santo,
all of whom pre-deceased their political chief. Sir Henry guided the destinies of his first
Ministry till July 22, 1864—a little over a year. He was at the head of the succeeding
Government, which held office from July 22 to August 4, 1864. I here was now a period
of two years of “shifting change,” in which Ministries quickly came and quickly went.
Succeeding Sir Henry’s last Ministry were those of the Hon. Mr. Idyth and Mi. Dutton,
in each of which he held office. Then he once again took charge of the political helm ,
but the Ministry lived only for one month, and on October 23, 1865, Mi. Hart became
Premier. This Administration survived but a few months, and was succeeded by the
Boucaut Government, which came into power on March 28, 1866. Shortly after this, Sir
Henry was gazetted an “Honorable,” under orders from Downing Street. The Boucaut
Ministry saw about one year and two months of office, and on May 3, 1867, the fourth
Ayers Ministry took in hand the affairs of the country. Sir Henry held the reins of
Government until September 24, 1868, when once again the Hon. J. Hart assumed control
with his team. But the tenure of life of the Hart Administration was short indeed, the
Avers Government being' again in office so soon after as October 13, with the same personnel
J e) O 1 • • 1
as constituted the Cabinet of the previous month. \ hese were days of great political
turmoil, and the Ayers Ministry had been in office only 20 days when the Government
formed by Mr. Strangways was sworn in, and remained in charge until May 12, 1870.
On January 22, 1872, Sir Henry again had a hand in the formation of a Government, and
two months later his Ministry was re-constructed. On July 22, 1873, he, with his fellow--
Ministers, retired. Meanwhile, Sir Henry had had the dignity of C.M.G. conferred upon
him, and on December 5, 1872, he was made a K.C.M.G. on account of his being Premier
at the date of the completion of the Transcontinental I elegraph Line, an undertaking that
reflects lasting glory on South Australia. In 1894 the Grand Cross of the Order was
conferred on him—Sir Henry and the late Sir Thomas Elder being the only South
Australians to receive this high decoration. Sir Henry was some time “ out of harness
as a member of Government until he became Chief Secretary in the first Ministry formed
by Sir John Colton. From this position he retired on October 26, 1877. I here were some
dramatic scenes leading up to this retirement, and the air in the Council Chamber was at
times electrical. .Sir Henry represented the Government in the Council, and a dispute
arose between him and the members of the Upper House, which gave rise to many heated
discussions and stormy scenes. Finally it was decided to take the management of affairs out of
his hands, Sir William Morgan being elected by the Council to lead them. Ihe end came,
however, when the Colton Ministry was defeated by the third and last Boucaut Government.
There was for some time a coldness of manner between Sir Henry Ayers and Sir \\ illiam
Morgan; but when, in 1881, Sir Henry became President of the Legislative Council, Sir
William made the amende honorable by speaking in highly complimentary terms of Sir
Henry, and by expressing his regret at having accepted the leadership of the Council
314
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Sir H. Ayers


after Sir Henry had been deprived of it. Reviewing his Ministerial career, it will be seen
that from July 4, 1863, to October 26, 1877, Sir Henry was connected with 11 Ministries
six of which were successive. While he was leader ol the Legislative Council he held the
portfolio of Chief Secretary. His colleagues in the various Cabinets were the late Judges
Andrews and Stow, Sir A. Blyth, Sir R. 1). Ross, Sir J. C. Bray, Sir \V. Milne, and the
Hons. J. H. Barrow, E. H. Herrington, F. S. Dutton, L. Clyde, J. Hart, T. Reynolds,
H. K. Hughes, J. G. Ramsay, P. Santo. G. ). W. Stevenson, and Wentworth Cavenagh.
Of those who were his fellow-Ministers, • the survivors are Sir James Penn Boucaut, the
Hon. Sir John Colton, the Hons. H. B. T. Strangways, J. Carr, and If. Ward.
Sir Henry Ayers’ appointment to the Presidentship of the Council in 1881 was
not his first experience of the Chair. In 1879 he acted as Deputy President during the
absence of the then President, Sir William Milne. On the assembling of Parliament in
1881, Sir Henry was elected President: and in 1888 was re-elected. He stayed in the
J ’ J
Presidential Chair till December 19, 1893, when he resigned his seat in the Council. On
that occasion the Council recorded in its proceedings “ its sense of the long and distinguished
services of the hon. gentleman to the colony of South Australia.” The Hon. J. H.
o J J
Gordon, leading the Upper House, in moving the resolution, said that with the resignation
of Sir Henry Ayers they “lost not only a member of ability and distinction, not only a
President under whom every member of the Council had found it a pleasure to sit, but a
kindly and sagacious friend, whose ripe experience and wise counsel were always at the
service of those who sought them. His political career was unique in its uninterrupted
length of service and in prominence.”
As an intercolonial delegate, Sir Henry was on more than one occasion an able
representative of the Province’s interests. Together with the late Sir Arthur Blyth and
the late Hon. Lavington Clyde, he attended, in 1863, the first Intercolonial Conference.
The main purpose of this gathering was for the consideration of the subject of uniform
tariffs and Customs duties and their distribution. .Sir Henry Ayers and Sir Arthur Blyth
also represented South Australia at the Intercolonial Conference held in Melbourne in
December, 1864, in reference to the transportation of criminals from the United Kingdom.
An address had formerly been adopted and submitted to the Queen opposing transportation
to any of the Australian Colonies, and urging that the transportation of convicts to Western
Australia should cease. The Conference made such an effectual remonstrance that the
Imperial authorities were later induced to abandon a projected resumption, and the
transportation to Western Australia ceased. In 1867 Sir Henry represented South Australia
at an Intercolonial Conference in Melbourne on the ocean postal question. Early in 1873
another Intercolonial Conference was held at Sydney, and the matters set down for
deliberation related to the Suez mail contract, Border duties, and others of some importance.
The delegates from this Province were Sir Henry Ayers and the late Hon. J. H. Barrow.
This Conference advised that the ocean mail steamers should call at Glenelg to receive
and deliver mails; it settled the terms of a Border Duties Convention with New South
Wales; abolished the system of collecting Customs duties on the Murray River, and
substituted the payment of lump sums to be arranged on an equitable basis by the colonies
more immediately concerned. \\ hen the delegates returned, they were specially thanked


by the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce for the valuable service they had rendered the
Province. In January, 1877, Sydney was the scene of another conference, the object
being the consideration of the duplication of the cable, the improvement of telegraph
communication between Europe and Australia, and the reduction of the message tariff.
With the Hon. K. Ward, M.L.C., Sir Henry attended, and this was the last occasion on
which the distinguished politician filled an ambassadorial office.
Sir Henrv Avers bore the reputation of being one of the best administrators
J J *■
South Australia has had, and it was stated of him that “it is doubtful whether any
South Australian Cabinet has ever had a better organiser.” It is satisfactory to be able to
record that during his long career he had the pleasure of living down a personal antagonism
which was at times most dramatically displayed towards him by his opponents. Ihe years
intervening between 1861; and 1874- when he was m the midst of his greatest political activity,
formed a period of progress and prosperity in South Australia. The public debt of the
Province at the end of 1877 was under five millions, the era referred to being one of
comparatively small borrowings from the London market. Sir Henry was a warm supporter
of the then Surveyor-General’s (Goyder) pastoral valuations during the session of 1864.
In 187 yhe vigorously opposed the Stamps and Succession Duties Pill introduced by the
Boucaut Ministry, as well as the proposal to borrow ,£3,000,000 in connection with the
furthering of the famous “broad and comprehensive policy” of that administration. To
enumerate the different public Acts for which Sir Henry was directly responsible would go
towards filling a book in itself. His good works live after him, and this notice cannot
have a better conclusion than the following summary of Sir Henry’s character, which
appeared in the Adelaide Register on the occasion of his demise: “Sir Henry was
peculiarly fitted to represent the people in the Senate hall and in the Cabinet office. As
an administrator he took his full share of responsibility, and showed his ready grasp of
detail. His culture and diplomatic training served him admirably in the discharge ot the
work appertaining to the occupancy of the highest positions in the State. No one
presided over the deliberations of the Legislative Council with a higher conception of the
requirements of the office. His rule was characterised by ability, gravity, impartiality, and
courtesy. Without reflecting on his predecessors, it is safe to say he gave an added
dionitv to the office which any successor will find it difficult to maintain. His demeanor
at the most trying times was always worthy of the traditions of the high position. He
was in every way an able exponent of the Constitution, with whose history, and alike
with its details, he was in the fullest sense familiar. After his retirement from Parliament,
Sir Henry gradually withdrew from public affairs; and an admirable lecture delivered
by him before the Australian Natives’ Association has left on lasting record his testimony
and his opinions concerning the achievements of the pioneer settlers of the Colony. Of
him, as of a celebrated Speaker of the House of Commons, it might be truly said, ‘his
face and figure filled the eye, and his voice charmed and impressed the ear.’ Sir Henry’s
uprightness in all things, his sturdy independence, his varied gifts, his tastes, his dignified,
courtly bearing, and his personal associations, all combined to invest him with a distinction
exceeded by few, if any, of our colonists, past or present, whose names are written large
on the pages of colonial history.”

Sir Samuel Davenport, K.C.M.G.
THE escutcheon and heraldry of our forefathers are now becoming the memorials and
emblazonry of the mercantile house and factory. In Australia many English
gentlemen of birth and position have established new homes and made fortunes.
The colonising activity of pioneers of this class has, in most cases, been exceptional ;
they have long enjoyed the reputa-
tion of being accounted among our
most useful and enterprising settlers.
Standing high among these is Sir
Samuel Davenport. In him we behold
a blending of the old and new
virtues. The grace and dignity of
associations with an influential past
have engrained in his being a strong
regard for institutions and customs
that are still the corner stone of our
social fabric ; while at the same time
he has always shown himself fully
animated by the spirit of colonial
enterprise and progress. Descended
from an old and distinguished
English family, Sir Samuel Davenport
was born in 1818, at Sherburn,
Oxfordshire. His father was a man of
position in the county of his
ancestors, and at Great Wigston,
Leicestershire, is to be seen a
memorial erected in the church
of that parish to his honored memory.
Time, in its chang'e - bringing; tlisfht,
O OO O’
however, has obliterated most of the
remains of the former greatness of the
o
Davenport family. The neighborhood
of Stockport, where once dwelt their long unbroken line in all the pleasant and dignified
circumstances of affluent English squirehood, is now covered with busy and smoky
factories. The trade of Liverpool has effected wonderful transformations in that part
of Lancashire where once the forefathers of Sir Samuel rode forth to hunt, and Dame
Dorothy Davenport worked classical pictures in tapestry. Visions of tempus actum are
all that now remain.
The earlier part of Sir Samuel’s manhood was profitably spent in travelling
round the southern shores of Europe. As he journeyed from one point to the other, he


was struck with the superabundant growth of fruit along the coast of the Mediterranean,
and he set himself the task of an exhaustive examination into the methods there prevalent
of vine, orange, olive, almond, and citron culture. The study was congenial to his
inclinations, for Sir Samuel had already resolved on the pursuit of the horticultural
industry immediately he became possessed of sufficient knowledge in regard to it. Ihe
information he reaped in connection with these investigations proved exceedingly valuable
in his subsequent efforts and endeavors in this Province. Meanwhile, his brother. Mr.
G. E. 1 )avenport had visited South Australia in 1839, and purchased a special survey, the
township of which he named Macclesfield, and Samuel, on his return to England, decided
to follow in his wake. On his arrival in this Province early in 1843, he proceeded to the
Macclesfield district, where he was one of the earliest settlers. His first venture was
sheep-farming, which at that time was almost the only remunerative form of industry in
the Province. His stock and acreage kept pace with his success in this direction, and,
ere a few years had elapsed, the subject of this notice was the possessor of an extensive
squatting estate.
In 1846 and 1847, on the appointment by Governor Robe, Sir Samuel
Davenport sat as one of the non-official members of the then Legislative Council,
This was Mr. Davenport’s first introduction to public life. In connection with his legislative
duties, it has often been recorded of him that he was wont to ride from his home in
Macclesfield to the Upper Chamber in Adelaide, a distance of 27 miles, attend to his
duties in the Council, and, after a long and tedious sitting, mount his horse and ride back
again. Such a display of energy and devotion to public duty is not often met with in
these times. These were the days when the Province knew no Road Boards. Each
wayfarer and traveller had to cut his own path and fashion his own track ; and in these
circumstances it was well Mr. Davenport was a skilled horseman. No doubt his experiences
in these long and lonely rides instilled into him some of the zeal he afterwards so conspicuously
displayed in seeking and securing the improvement of the highways of the Province. The
wide knowledge of the country that he had gained from frequent journeys through the
districts adjoining Adelaide proved of immeasurable value afterwards in the drawing up
of schemes with this object. Sir Samuel’s experience was one of the best charts available
for a guide.
As an explorer of the pioneering pastoralist type, he did great service in the
opening up of new country. He was one of the first settlers to cross the Murray with
stock, and, after getting down as far as Rivoli Bay, he tried to extend his operations, with
rather disastrous results, however, for he lost some thousands of sheep from an unknown
local disease, since called “ coastal,” as well as through the spears and robberies of the
aborigines, for protection against whom each (lock was double manned by armed shepherds,
and aided by a mounted man, also armed, whose rapid and unexpected movements did
much to scare the natives. These evils were afterwards better controlled by substituting
cattle and horses for sheep. At a subsequent date, however, his indefatigable energy
succeeded in achieving the desired end. In the bush he was ever brave and fearless, and
his eagerness to open up outlying territory for the benefit of the Province reflects his
patriotic regard for his adopted country. The interests of others were never sacrificed
in favor of his own. Having acted as honorary secretary of an Adelaide committee formed


in 1850 to select South Australian products and transmit them to the late Prince Albert’s
International Exhibition in London, 1851, Sir Samuel Davenport visited England early in that
year, and after receiving an Exhibition Medal for services, returned to Adelaide in 1853,
1 855 the Governor, Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, appointed Sir Samuel
Davenport one of the four ncn-official members of the enlarged Legislative Council
appointed, with the addition of 16 elected members, to frame the Constitution Act.
In March, 1857, Sir Samuel Davenport was an elected member of the first
Legislative Council under the Constitution Act, and so remained up to August 30, 1866.
when he resigned. His policy was broad and liberal, taking its centre in the advocacy
of such reforms as were necessary to the welfare of the Province. The Treasury,
however, was still lean, and could not stand the strain of an elaborate programme of
extension such as he was inclined to favor. Sir Samuel Davenport twice held the
portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works. No administrative office could have suited
his attainments better, and hardly any other politician of that epoch could have discharged
the duties of that office in closer consonance with the requirements and the possibilities
of the State. Ihe first Torrens Dam was made mainlv through his exertions in his
ministerial capacity ; and the completion of this most necessary undertaking was attended
with expressions of general satisfaction.
During many years past Sir Samuel has been prominently connected with varied
phases of industry in the Province. The position of President of the Royal Agricultural
and Horticultural Society of South Australia was ably held by him for ten years : and he
J J j *
also held the Presidentship of the Chamber of Manufactures simultaneously, with an
additional six years added. The unqualified success which attended his mission to king-
land in 1851 was instrumental in procuring for him the appointment of Executive
Commissioner for South Australia at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, at the Sydney
Exhibition in 1879. and at the Melbourne Exhibition in 1880. On his return to Adelaide
from America, where he had worthily sustained the reputation of South Australia, Ik*
was made the recipient of a handsome testimonial, which was presented by Sir R. I).
Hanson. On February 4, 1887, a similar tribute of appreciation was paid him, the
presentation being made by Sir Henry Ayers, on his return from acting as Executive
Commissioner in London. During the progress of the Indian and Colonial Exhibition in
London in that year, in connection with which he again acquitted himself with commendable
zeal as the representative of South Australia, he was made a K.C.M.G. by the Queen
in consideration of his long and valuable services. The distinction of K.B. (Knight Bachelor)
had already been conferred upon him for his conspicuous usefulness in advancing colonial
interests. At the Indian and Colonial Exhibition the work which fell to his lot as
Commissioner for South Australia was exceptionally heavy. He paid untiring attention
to the supervision and arrangement of the South Australian exhibits, and the court in
which they were exposed to observation and criticism became, through his exertions, a
centre of attraction, and was generally pronounced to be one of the features of the
Exhibition.
In 1887 Sir Samuel Davenport’s ripe experience was availed of for the
319
Sir S. Davenport ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


promotion of the Jubilee Exhibition in Adelaide, lo the furtherance of its useful
objects and aims he generously gave his valuable assistance to the Executive Committee,
of which he was a member.
For a lonef time past the early horticultural knowledge which he gained from his
travels in Southern Europe has been turned by Sir Samuel to a good account m South
Australia, where he has large vineyards, fruit orchards, and olive groves cultivated on
scientific lines. Sir Samuel is a member of the directorates of several important local
companies, including the influential South Australian Company. Of recent years he has
led a quiet life, having kept aloof from public affairs.
Sir Samuel Davenport s contributions to the general advancement and development
of South Australia can be estimated from the numerous forms of services he has rendered
to it. His political reputation, however, is apt to suffer from the more conspicuous and
appreciable success that has crowned his labors as the representative of the Province at
the several Exhibitions with which he was officially concerned. But his career in Parliament
was as full of merit as it was prolific of useful issues. His desire to help any good public
cause as best he could was ever a distinguishing trait in his character, which always
elicited the esteem of those who recognised the worthiness of his aims. Although now
in his old age, his countenance bears the honorable impress of the rough and hard
experience of early days spent in arduous toil in the bush. 1 hat rugged mask, as his
numerous friends know well, may be easily and quickly illuminated with geniality and
intelligence, leading characteristics of the possessor being generosity ol heart combined
with culture and much refinement of mind.
The late Hon. B. T. Finniss.
THE last to die of that splendid band of civil officers appointed in England to found
the Province of South Australia was Mr. Finniss. He reached these shores months
before the first Governor, and saw the country as an unexplored wilderness.
Providence, kinder than man, permitted him to reside for upwards of 57 years among
the community to which he devoted his best mental and bodily vigor, and to see the
Province rise from the unknown to that high stage of development which it attained in the
last decade of the nineteenth century.
Boyle Travers Finniss was born at sea off the Cape of Good Hope on August
18. 1807, and was educated first in Greenwich, and then at the Royal Military College at
Sandhurst. Here he laid the foundation for an able military career, till on October 24,
1835, he sold out of the army.
Under the Act providing for the foundation of this Province, the Colonising
Commissioners appointed Mr. Finniss an assistant surveyor at a year on the staff
placed at the disposal of Colonel Eight, the Surveyor-General. In March, 1836, he sailed
in the Cygnet for South Australia, and began his long connection with responsible affairs
in South Australia. He assisted Colonel Light, of whom he was a cherished friend, in
surveying Rapid Bay, and in choosing a site on the Torrens for the capital city Adelaide.
320
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Sir S. Davenport


I pon the death of Colonel Light, Mr. Finniss, in August, 1839, was appointed
Deputy Surveyor-General, and subsequently Chief Draughtsman. His next appointment
was that of Police Magistrate and Commissioner of Police.
On April 28, 1847, Governor Robe appointed him Registrar-General and Treasurer,
which entitled him to a seat in the old Legislative Council, and was thus employed until
1852, when he was appointed Colonial Secretary. He held this position until the inauguration
of responsible government in 1857.
During the interregnum between the departure of Sir Henry Young and the arrival
of Sir Richard MacDonnell- from December 20, 1854, to June 8, he was Acting
Governor. Having been the chief officer under the old Constitution, and indefatigable in
seeming its alteration, it was only natural that he should be commissioned to form the
fust Cabinet. He assumed office on October 24, 1856, having for his colleagues Sir
R. D. Hanson, Sir R. R. Porrens, Mr. Charles Bonney, and Captain I 7 reeling. The
Ministry was, however, only short-lived, being superseded on August 21, 1857, by r a Cabinet
formed by the Hon. John Baker. After 12 days the late Sir R. R. Torrens became
I lender. Pour weeks later saw Sir R. I). Hanson in office, and on June 12, 1858, Mr.
Pinniss became Treasurer in succession to the Plon. John Baker, retaining the position
until May 9, iB6O. During the first Parliament he sat in the House of Assembly as one
of six representatives for the city of Adelaide, but in the second Parliament he was
returned, with Mr. John Dunn, for Mount Barker. Upon the dissolution of the House
in October, 1862, he retired from Parliament, nor did he again contest a seat until years
afterwards, when he sought to enter the Legislative Council and was defeated.
In 1864, when it had been determined to found a settlement in the Northern
I erritory, the Ayers Government appointed Mr. Pinniss its first Government Resident.
His actions there not meeting with the approval of the Government, he was recalled.
In 1864 Mr. Pinniss was gazetted as entitled to prefix for life his name with the
title of “ Honorable.’ In 1875 he was appointed a member of the P'orest Board, a position
which he held until 1881. In 1876 he acted as Auditor-General during the absence on
leave of the late Mr. E. H. Kitchen.
Mr. Pinniss took a great interest in military matters. He raised the Volunteer
Company known as the “Adelaide Marksmen,” and afterwards with Major Moore organised
a force of 2,000 men under the Act of 1853, becoming Lieutenant-Colonel of the Staff and
Inspecting Field Officer. He acted on several commissions to enquire into the defences of the
Province.
His long connection with public affairs in South Australia enabled Mr. p'inniss
to write, and afterwards publish in 1866, a valuable work entitled the “Constitutional
History of South Australia.”
In December, 1893, the Hon. B. T. P'inniss died at Kensington Park, Adelaide.
The Register described him as “a man of determined character, varied capacitv, and
great usefulness, whose sense of duty was never impugned. Pie was, indeed, one of the
finest colonists South Australia has ever possessed.”

Hon. Sir John W. Downer, K.G.M.G., Q.C., M.P.
PERHAPS no Colony in the British realm can boast of a higher standard of legal
attainment than that which is to be found in South Australia. It is also a
noticeable and gratifying feature that the capabilities of most of these legal
luminaries have been utilised in the political arena of the country. Not only has then-
lustre enhanced the more parochial
domain of South Australian legis-
lation, but has also shone in a
marked degree in the higher dis-
cussions of intercolonial and foreign
questions. The noble ideal of
building up an Australian Com-
monwealth has received a stimulus
towards its realisation by these
able constitutional architects. The
name of Sir John Downer has,
from its conception to its
cradle, been prominently con-
nected with the advancement of
this statesmanlike aim. I hough
in South Australia he has won no
uncertain political laurels, his in-
fluence and legislative merits are
widely recognised and appraised
beyond the boundaries of his
native soil. His career is an
inseparable portion of South Aus-
tralian political progression, and,
as a native of Adelaide, his public
conduct must give especial pleasure
to its inhabitants.
John \V. Downer was born in
Adelaide on July 5. 1844, and
received his early education at St. Peter’s College. He afterwards studied lor law, being
J
called to the South Australian Bar in 1868. The work of acquiring a good clientele in
those days was no popinjay’s task; but Sir John Downer forged the way, and, with his
equally well-known brother, Mr. George Downer, established the firm ot G. & j. Downer,
one of the largest legal houses in South Australia.
Sir John had shown for several years an active interest in the public questions
that affected the political weal of the Province, and in 1878 he contested and won a seat


in the Barossa electorate. This constituency Sir John has ably represented to the present
time. He was not long in the House before his abilities as a debater and legislator were
recognised. When Sir John Bray formed an Administration in June, 1881. he chose Sir
John Downer as his Attorney-General. This portfolio was held till June, 1884, when
the Government went out of office. In his capacity of Attorney-General he introduced
and carried through the House a measure allowing persons charged with criminal offences
to give evidence on their own behalf. He also succeeded in carrying the Married Women's
Property Bill, which legislated in the just interests of the class to whom it was extended.
1 he able manner in which he championed these measures found welcome panegyrics in
the contemporary press and among his colleagues.
After Sir John Bray went to England, Sir John Downer became leader of the
Opposition, and carried a want-of-confidence motion against the Colton Ministry, and
assumed office as Premier and Attorney-General in June. iBBy This Ministry instituted
J J J
a strong protective tariff, and decided many other important economic questions. In
January, 1887, Sir John Downer attended the Colonial Conference in London, and was
entrusted with the important and responsible duty of presenting the case for the assimilation
of the law of England with that of the Province in regard to marriage with a deceased
O o o
wife’s sister. On this occasion it was agreed that Sir John Downer’s performance
reflected immense credit on his political sagacity and engineering skill. In his work at
home Sir John displayed unusual statesmanlike resources and wide diplomatic shrewdness.
Recognition of his valuable services was secured bv the conferment on him of the K.C.M.G.
« ’ J
dignity by the Oueen. On his return to Adelaide after the achievement of his mission, he
found his Ministry had suffered defeat. It was not till October 15, 1892, when he was
successful in carrying a motion of want of confidence in the Holder Government, that
Sir John assumed office as Premier of the Province. His position at the helm of public
affairs did not continue further than June of the following year, when the Kingston
party defeated his Government.
Sir John’s connection with the work of Australian Federation dates from the
Sydney Convention of 1883, when he was one of the representatives of South Australia.
He may be said to have been one of its greatest promoters. Its multifold clauses and
complex problems were earnestly studied by him. and the assiduous attention he has paid
to the solution of its knotty issues is well shown by the intelligent account he has given
J J O
of himself at more recent Conventions. In 1891. and again in 1897, he was chosen
as delegate of the Province to the FTcleral Convention, and South Australia added
to her political fame by the argumentative and constructive display of Sir John Downer
before an assemblage of the most brilliant Australian political intellects. He did much to
expedite the onerous and tardy work of the Convention by his constant readiness to lend
positive counsel and advice. Though the interests of the smaller colonies naturally received
his prime attention, he never obtruded these to the detriment or detraction of the general
cause. It was only when something manifestly unfair and unjust to the welfare of the less
populous States cropped up that Sir John’s logic effectively asserted itself. Not only this
Province, but the other smaller States must acknowledge their indebtedness to his wise
and careful guardianship of their interests; and all well-wishers of the ultimate accomplishment
of the national aim of Federation must recognise the patriotism and able assistance lent


by Sir John. The clauses of the great Commonwealth Bill, the most liberal and enlightened
ever projected, bear the impress of his drafting skill, he with Messrs. Barton and O’Connor
having been appointed the Executive of the Convention, under the title of “The
Draft! ng Committee.”
During his long public career, Sir John Downer has been prominently and actively
associated with all public movements of any moment. On behalf of the colonies he has
attended numerous conferences, and proved himself instrumental in advancing various
interests entrusted to his guidance. He is a member of the University Council, and holds
honorable positions in connection with organisations and institutions for promoting the
social well-being of the community. His legal attainments were fittingly rewarded by
his appointment, in 1878, as a O.C. Sir John’s professional and political achievements
entitle him to sit in the forefront of Australia’s most eminent and useful citizens. Few
can produce a record so unchequered in its altruistic designs and attainments. The products
of his legislative construction are still bearing their fruits in a prosperous and growing
Province. He was no mere politician of the passing hour; the range of his submitted
measures extended to an horizon which only a far-seeing and gifted eye could discern. The
future, as well as the pressing needs of the present, seem each to obtain from the devising
mind of Sir John its due share of careful attention. His legislative labors are writ large
in the political development of South Australian history, and will remain as a monument
to his disinterested activity and able public endeavors to promote the weal of his native land.
The late Samuel Beddome , Police Magistrate
gentleman who forms the subject of this memoir was one of the most upright
magistrates who ever presided in a South Australian Court of Law. He was
a man of much worldly wisdom who had a keen, penetrating judgment, and that
wise acquaintance of human character which he combined with a knowledge of close reasoning
o
necessary to the proper administration of the law. He was born in Manchester in 1817,
and came to South Australia in 1843. For ten years prior to his arrival in South Australia
he followed various avocations. The first two years of his colonial life were devoted to
farming pursuits, but he came to Adelaide in October, 1845, and entered the Public Service
as clerk in the Local Court, with the rank of constable, remaining in this clerical capacity
till the end of 1856. On January 1, 1857, he was promoted to the Police Magistracy. The
first Police Court over which Mr. Beddome presided was located in the old building which
used to stand where the Telegraph and Money Order Departments of the General Post Office
are now situated. For years Mr. Beddome sat as Police Magistrate, retiring on July
31, 1890, amid unfeigned expressions of general regret. He died in April, 1898—one of
the most esteemed citizens of Adelaide. Mr. Beddome was a stern upholder of the strict
impartiality of the Bench ; and he carried out his duties fearlessly and in consonance with
right and justice.

Hon. Sir Edwin T. Smith, K.C.M.G., M.L.C
SOUTH AUSTRALIA can boast of wealthy citizens who have, by virtue of unremitting
industry, raised themselves to an enviable point of affluence, and yet who, be it said
to their honor, have utilised their abundance for the general good and welfare of the
<7 <J
community. Perhaps in no place in the world does the famous saying of Aristotle, that
“ man is a social animal,” find
more practical application than in
Australia. If Fortune chance to
have raised the privileged receivers
of her bounties to a position of
power, they seldom forget that
they are citizens with a duty
J J
to perform in a rising colony.
Patriotism, with its components of
generosity and altruism, impels to
liberality ; and the Australian con-
tinent can boast of none more
liberal in the disbursement of
pecuniary assistance to deserving
causes than South Australia’s
popular and well-known citizen,
Sir Edwin Smith.
Sir Edwin was born in Walsall,
Staffordshire, England, in 1831,
and at the age of 22 arrived in
South Australia. His first intro-
duction to colonial life was in the
capacity of an importer. He
afterwards turned his attention
and industrious energy to brewing.
O J O
To this latter business he
tenaciously and advantageously
clung for close on 35 years, during which period he led a life of unceasing and laborious
activity, his industry being only equalled by his skill in his line of trade. He laid the
nucleus of his fortune in the savings gleaned from his own physical exertions ; and these
were subsequently directed into other profitable channels, his investments bespeaking a
discretionary judgment as well as an exemplary display of thrift in his early years. Thus
he was ultimately able to forego a measure of his active business life, and devote himself
J O
to responsible but less continuously exacting public duties.
Sir Edwin had early exhibited a decided leaning to politics. His proclivities were


strengthened with the acquisition of knowledge, and his aspirations matured on reaching
that point where length of purse enables a man to pursue more enthusiastically the bent
of his inclinations. In 1871, therefore, Sir Edwin sought the suffrages of the electors of
East Torrens, and he was returned to the House of Assembly. Time strengthened the
bonds of sympathy between Sir Edwin and his constituents, and as often as he sought
re-election at their hands, so often did they show their satisfaction with him by declaring
in his favor. With the solitary exception of one year (when he was on a visit to England
in 1877) Sir Edwin sat continuously for 21 years as the representative of East Torrens.
Li is Parliamentary career has been characterised as one of genuine zeal for the advancement
of the Province. He was a Progressionist, and whatever was moderately possible in the
way of advancement received his hearty support. It is to the activity and intelligent regard
of such men as Sir Edwin that South Australia owes in a great part her advanced Democratic
and Liberal institutions.
Ministerial office he never sought, often as it was pressed upon him, preferring to
maintain his independence and to assist the work of legislation by giving a moderate
support, wherever possible, to the Government of the day. The only occasion on which
he was induced to break his rule was in 1884. when he occupied for a few months only
the position of Minister of Education in the Bray Government. He now enjoys the
comparative leisure of a seat in the Legislative Council, having been elected by an immense
majority at the head of the poll for the Southern Division in 1894.
It was but natural that a man like Sir Edwin should find considerable scope in
the labors of municipal life. Perhaps in this utilitarian public department, more than in
the hurly-burly of politics, a disinterested worker can confer immediate, if less extensive,
good on the people of a town or city possessing municipal controlling machinery. Municipal
life claimed Sir Edwin’s attention first in 1867, when he was elected Mayor of the Kensington
and Norwood Corporation. He continued in that capacity lor three consecutive years.
That he was a successful wearer of the mayoral robes may be gathered from the fact
that in 1871 and 1872 he was again called to the civic chair. He had rendered notable
service to the suburban municipality by his active administration and wide knowledge of
its requirements. Sir Edwin can look back with satisfaction on that period of his
administration as one of undoubted progressive activity. During his mayoralty, gas and
water mains were first introduced into the municipality, and the various creeks which run
through the town were bridged wherever the streets cross them—a highly necessary but
very expensive undertaking. He has been President of the Norwood Institute from its
inception.
In 1879 the citizens of Adelaide elected him as their Mayor. His past performances
were known and appraised, and it was rightly judged that his worth would be proportionate
on a wider stage. In 1880, and again in 1881, he proved himself highly qualified for the
onerous duties of the chair by being elected Mayor. It would be impossible to enumerate
the various administrative acts with which his name is closely associated during his tenure
of the civic chair. Suffice it to say, he advanced the best interests of the city. His
popularity became commensurate with his municipal activity, and the time he spent in
framing by-laws was amply repaid by the esteem which his labors won for him. It is a
326
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Hon. sir e. t. Smith


seeming paradox that the worry and harassing care of public life afford pleasure to some
who feel a real stagnation when they retire from the midst of the turmoil. Perhaps it is
so with Sir Edwin ; for in r 888 and the following year he again yielded to a general wish
that he should accept the Mayoralty of Adelaide. It must be remembered that these
official duties were contemporaneous with those entailed on him by a seat in the Assembly.
Both city and suburbs are much indebted to Sir Edwin Smith for the facility
of communication which now exists between them. The network of tramways which
stretches on every side had its commencement in his active promotion of the Adelaide
and Suburban Tramway Company, the first to undertake the laying down of lines to
North Adelaide and Kensington. The advantages of the scheme were obvious to all, but
it was he who first made it practically possible, brushing aside all difficulties with characteristic
resolution, and piloting through Parliament the necessary legislation. He was for some
years a director of the Company, but has latterly left the work of management to others.
The bed of the Torrens River as it runs through the city was for many years an
ugly sight, and a thing of general offence. Remedies were suggested, but nothing practical
was done until Sir Edwin and his colleagues in the City Council succeeded, after considerable
O J
discussion of various schemes, in carrying out a measure for its beautification. From an
unsightly and unhealthy quagmire it was transformed into an attractive and useful sheet of
water, and the lake then formed remains to this day one of the chief attractions of
Adelaide. This transformation will long be remembered in connection with Sir Fidwin s
name, for his advocacy and energy were the principal factors in the carrying out of the
scheme.
The Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition of 1887 is still fresh in the memory
of the Province ; so, too, are perhaps the great difficulties experienced in connection with
the preliminary arrangements. It was in the midst of general doubt and uncertainty
at a point when the Government had actually abandoned the original scheme —that Sir
Edwin stepped into the breach and obtained a dubious consent to a fresh start, on a basis
of individual guarantees. His energy and influence soon obtained the requisite support,
and the undertaking prospered from that moment. He became, inevitably, the practical
head of the central committee of organisation, and infused into it his own spirit of activity.
Sir Edwin’s enthusiasm and earnest desire to see not only an Exhibition, but a successful
Exhibition, induced him to contribute much time and labor for the furtherance of the
undertaking, and it was but fitting that, as chief promoter and vice-president, he received
a knighthood as a reward.
There was no doubt a certain fitness in the presentation to the city of Adelaide
of the fine statue which forms the central adornment of King William Street by the
man who had some years before been instrumental, as Mayor, in causing the opening up
of Victoria Square, and so converting that street into one of the finest thoroughfares in
the Southern Hemisphere. The lifelike presentment in bronze of Her Majesty the Queen
was selected by Sir Edwin while on a visit to England in 1893, from the studio of
Mr. Birch, A.R.A. It was cast at the Thames Ditton Foundry, under the supervision
of the sculptor himself; and though several replicas of the work exist in various parts of


the world, the one in Adelaide is considered by competent judges to have no superior.
Ihe crowning scene took place in August, 1894. when, in the presence of the Earl of
Kintore and a gathering of representative citizens, the donor formally presented to the
Mayor and Corporation the statue of the Sovereign which is to hold for all time so
commanding a position in the square that bears her name in the city named after a former
English Oueen.
A long chain of connections with various public institutions has not only tested
Sir Edwin’s co-operative tendencies, but heavily taxed his generosity also. To the
i J O J
delil aerations of the controlling bodies he has brought an element of practical common-sense
not always found allied to the benevolent mind ; and to enable these institutions to start
or continue on a solid basis, he has often made handsome donations. His hearty and
practical response to multifold demands on his generosity has often been worthily commented
upon by the press, but scores of grateful people could tell a tale of deeds of kindness that
have been known to none but the recipient.
Sir Edwin is the present chairman of the Adelaide Savings Bank, having
succeeded Sir Henry Ayers in that position after 26 years' service as an honorary
trustee. He was and remains the first chairman of the National Park Commissioners,
and has rendered great service in connection with this beautiful public resort. The
Commercial Pravellers’ and Warehousemen’s Association of South Australia enjoys his
patronage, as does also the United Commercial Travellers’ Association of Australasia.
Sir Edwin holds a prominent position on the Adelaide Board of the Australian
Mutual Provident Society, as well as on the Board of Management of the Zoological
Gardens. He is also a Director of the Botanic Gardens, and it can be truly said
of him that he has given up a well-earned leisure in order to minister to public
requirements in all directions. P'or directorships and other remunerative positions
he has never striven, and his wide services to the public have been given, almost
without exception, in an honorary capacity. It is surprising that Sir Edwin can find time
to discharge the further functions which pertain to his close affinity with charitable
institutions. For many years he had a seat on the Adelaide Hospital Board, and he is
still a trustee and vice-president of the Blind and Deaf and Dumb Institution, the Elder
Workmen’s Homes, as also of the Benevolent and Strangers’ Friend Society. Sir Edwin
is also chairman of the Old Colonists’ Association, which confers, quietly but well, much
benefit upon those who, having borne the heat and burden of the early days of the
J J
Province, find themselves lacking of the good things of this world in their old age.
Such a list of official and largely honorary duties is formidable enough to excite
curiosity as to how their requirements are all grappled with, and the fact that each receives
cordial, active, and generous attention cannot but redound to the credit of the ready and
# 9 J
untiring capacity of Sir Edwin Smith.
No other man in South Australia —nay, in Australia—has done more than he
has in the interests of athletics. When the mere fact of his being in some capacity or other
connected with over 100 clubs, associations, and other athletic fraternities is mentioned,
this estimate of his relationship to the sporting world can best be judged. Not that Sir
Edwin personally indulges to any great extent in these pastimes (though he was at one


time one of the crack rifle-shots of the Province) ; but, as he says himself, “ I like to
help the young men in their desire for athletic development.” This is the motive which
prompts him to render them assistance and practical encouragement. The turf Sir Edwin
has never actively encouraged, though he bears no narrow prejudice against it ; but in
the direction of every other sport and pastime his sympathies are unbounded. He is
President of the Adelaide Hunt Club, Patron of the South Australian Cricket, Rowing,
Bowling, Chess, and Tennis Associations, and of the League of South Australian \\ heelmen.
To the various athletic clubs he has always been generous, and that generosity finds a
warm acknowledgment in the hearts of all recipients of his kindness.
Sir Edwin has been married twice. In 1857 he took to wife hlorence, daughter
of the late Robert Stock, of Clifton, England; but her early death occurred in 1862.
His second wife is Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Spicer, merchant, of Adelaide, to whom
he became allied in 1869. Lady Smith has earned universal regard, as well for her
social qualities as for the manner in which she has supported her husband’s many benevolent
undertakings.
Sir Edwin Smith, both as a citizen and as a man, is highly and rightly beloved
of the people of Adelaide and vicinity, for whom he has done so much. A consistent
supporter of religion in every form, he is the centre of a wide circle of esteem and respect.
People of every class and denomination unite to do him homage. His life has been one
long series of services for the general weal, brightened by the gems of kindness of heart
and far-reaching philanthropy. The unanimous wish of all South Australians is that his
days may yet be long in the land.
Mr. William Robinson Boothby, C.M.G., B. A. Sheriff of South Australia
SINCE early in the “fifties” South Australia has been popularly acquainted with the
name of Boothby. In 1853 Mr. Benjamin Boothby arrived in South Australia, and
on August 28 of that year was sworn in as a Judge of the Supreme Court. He
was a native of Doncaster, Yorkshire, England, and for some time occupied the positions
of Revising Barrister for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and of Recorder of Pontefract.
Her Majesty’s Government offered him the appointment of Second Judge of the Supreme
Court of South Australia, which he forthwith accepted. Judge Boothby conducted his
onerous duties until 1867, when he disagreed with the Government of South Australia
upon the Real Property Act (Torrens Act). He died on June 21, 1868.
Two of Judge Boothby’s sons became prominent men in the South Australian Civil
Service, and one of them was Mr. William Robinson Boothby, Sheriff of South Australia, the
subject of our memoir. This gentleman was born in England on September 26, 1829. He
took his B.A. degree at the London University, and accompanied his father to Australia in


1 853* entering the South Australian Civil Service in December, 1854, as Deputy Sheriff, and
appointed Sheriff in March, 1856. He was a member of the Court of Disputed Returns
for the Legislative Council in 1854, and became Returning Officer for the Province in 1856.
He has been called upon from time to time to advise the Government as to alterations in
the electoral Acts, the first occasion being after the election in 1857, when Mr. Boothby
devised the present system of conducting the ballot. He was next engaged to report on
the South Australian system of voting; and these reports were printed and laid on the
table of the House of Commons in 1872, at the time the Ballot Bill was under
consideration in the British Legislature. The South Australian plan of voting ultimately
became law in Lngland and in most of the United States of America.
Mr. Boothby’s valuable opinion has been sought on several occasions by Select
Committees appointed by the Legislature to take evidence and report on electoral matters
and the subdivision of the Province into electoral districts. In May, 1888, he wrote a
report on the Constitution granted to South Australia. For over a quarter of a century
Mr. Boothby acted as Returning Officer for the Legislative Council, the whole Province
forming the district, and, with one exception, he presided at every scrutiny of votes. During
this lengthened period no case of bribery or undue influence was ever brought before a
Court of Disputed Returns relative to the elections for the Upper House. He is still
Returning Officer for the Province and for the Central District of the Legislative Council.
As Sheriff, he has had the charge and control of the prisons of South Australia since
1854, and, for nearly 30 years, of the Convict Department. Mr. Boothby drafted the
Prisons Act. 1869-70, and framed the regulations connected with its administration, receiving
for this work the special commendation of the Government. Mr. Boothby, in 1862, designed
the present system of forming Jurors’ Rolls, and drafted the fury Act, No. 1, 1862, in
which year he was appointed Marshal of the Vice-Admiralty Court. He was Captain
in the Volunteer Artillery, B Battery, in the “fifties.” He acted for many years as Chairman
of the Annual Board of Lenders for Government Supplies, and he has acted on several
important Royal Commissions. He is now a member of the Supply and Tender Board
On the foundation of the University of Adelaide in 1874, Mr. Boothby was
appointed a member of the first Council; and he has continued a member of that
governing body ever since, having been periodically re-elected by the Senate.
In 1876, when on leave, he visited most of the prisons and convict establishments
of the United Kingdom, his visit of inspection proving of great benefit to the Province
in the erection—largely by prison labor—of buildings of a more suitable character as prisons.
In addition to enquiring into the workings of penal establishments in Great
Britain, Mr. Boothby toured the south of Franee and Italy to study and report on olive
cultivation. He published a highly instructive brochure as a result of his investigations,
and, on his return, utilised prison labor in planting many acres with olives round the
Adelaide Gaol. In July, 1893, Mr. Boothby was the recipient of a handsome presentation
at the hands of the various Returning Officers of the Province; and in January, 1893,
Her Majesty conferred on him the dignity of C.M.G.

1 he late Hon. Sir John Cox Bray, K.C.M.G.
NO South Australian will readily forget the name at the head of this sketch, nor
the amiable face shown in the accompanying portrait. Sir John Bray was a politician
of high reputation, and there was that about his demise which appealed to the
hearts of the people. After an exile, in obedience to duty, of over two years’ duration
in London, where he served as
Agent-General of the Province,
he was returning to his native
land, and had accomplished part
of the voyage, when death over-
took him. 1 he climax was so
unexpected and pathetic that the
people of South Australia were
moved to emotional grief. In
recent times the counterpart of
the surprise and sorrow was ex-
perienced when the late lion.
David Pews, the Minister of
Education, died suddenly in
Melbourne,
Sir John Bray was a son of
the Province. Mis father, the late
Mr. Phomas Cox Bray, arrived in
South Australia in the “thirties,"
when the people were sowing in
tribulation the seeds of prosperity.
Like his contemporaries, Mr. T.
C. Bray felt the brunt of the
colonising delays of 1837-8. and of
the financial storms of 1841-2.
He carried on business in Hindley
Street, then the “hub” of Adelaide,
for many years, and gained a
meritorious position in the Province. Sir John Bray was born in Adelaide in 1842. received
his preliminary education at St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, and finished his scholastic career
in England, After being articled to the law, he was admitted to practice in 1870, joining
Mr. J. B. Sheridan in partnership. With the changes so characteristic of Australian
legal houses, the firm subsequently became Bray, Poster, & Hackett, then Bray N Hackett,
the latter gentleman being Mr. J. T. Hackett, B.A. These two lawyers were associated
together until 1891. Although Sir John Bray never practised very actively in the courts,
he had an important general connection. He was recognised as a good lawyer, and the
practice of the firm was reliable.


But Sir John Bray’s heart was in politics. He possessed the gifts of a clever
parliamentary debater, with the powers of a leader and of a sturdy fighter. As a young
man, he was so successful in debating societies that complimentary references were continually
appearing in the press concerning his “ promising career.” In the year following his
admission to the Bar he entered the House of Assembly as representative of East Adelaide,
and he held the suffrage of that electorate for 20 successive years, in itself an incontrovertible
indication of his reputation as a politician. From the first, Sir John won an established
place as a debater ; and as his experience became more extensive, he gradually forged a
way to the forefront. Four years after entering Parliament, in March, 1875, he became
Minister of Justice and Education in the Blyth Administration, in succession to Mr. Justice
Bundey. This was the beginning of his Ministerial career, and he aggregated over eight
years in office. He held a position in six Cabinets, being Premier in one Government
for about three years.
As a Minister of the Crown, Sir John at once became popular, as well among the
officers under him as among his colleagues and the private members of the House. Indeed,
it might be said that those who were his most vigorous opponents were as much his
friends as those who looked upon his politics as bound to save the country. Very soon
after Mr. Bray had joined the Blyth Ministry, it was defeated by Mr. Boucaut (now Sir
fames Penn Boucaut); but in June, 1876, Mr. Boucaut retired, and Sir John Colton, who
had been Treasurer in the Ministry of June, 1875, was entrusted with the task of forming
a new combination. Sir John Bray became Attorney-General, and he held office from
lime 6, 1876, to October 26, 1877. Succeeding Sir John Colton as Premiers were Mr.
Boucaut and Sir William Morgan. This was a period of political storm, and he who
rode upon it the highest was the indefatigable and spirited Mr. Boucaut, whose initiative
and example supplied fire and fierceness to the Parliamentary debates.
In the storm and stress of Australian politics there are no clearly defined permanent
parties as such are understood in old countries. The growth of population and the rapidity
with which the conditions alter necessitate periodical changes of political tactics, and thus
it comes about that those who may be of identical views in one year are, a year or two
later, unrelenting opponents. Ministries are, as a rule, short-lived ; parties are quickly
demolished, formed and re-formed, and the inveterate political enemies of to-day become
the bosom friends of to-morrow. The Boucaut Cabinet lasted for twelve months, and then
the Morgan Cabinet enjoyed nearly three years' term of office—a period of reaction after
the previous stress. In March, 1881, Sir William Morgan’s Ministry was reconstructed;
in June it left office. Then followed unique circumstances in the Province, which resulted
in Sir John Bray rising to the dignity of Premier. First the Hon. G. C. Hawker was
asked to form a new Cabinet, and declined. Then Sir John Colton was approached, but
he also refused, and advised that Sir John Bray be entrusted with the task. Sir John
accepted the undertaking, and on June 24, 1881, he entered into office as Premier and
Chief Secretary, having as colleagues Sir John Downer, the Hon. Alfred Catt, the Hon.
J. F. Parsons, and the late Hons. L. Clyde and 1. G. Ramsay. Sir John Bray thus
became the first native-born Premier of South Australia —a distinctive honor which was
well deserved. He had already been the second South Australian to hold a seat in a
Cabinet, Sir R. C. Baker in the Hart Administration being the first in this respect.


Sir John Bray was Premier from June 24, 1881, to June 16, 1884. In March, 1884,
the Hon. J. L. Parsons was appointed Government Resident of the Northern Territory, and
his portfolio was taken by Sir E. T. Smith. The Hon. L. Clyde was defeated in seeking
re-election, and in the reconstruction in April, the late Mr. David Bower accepted the vacant
portfolio. In the meantime Sir John Colton had been on a trip to England. Upon his
return he was so dissatisfied with certain of the Premier’s proposals that he moved and carried
a no-confidence motion. Sir fohn Colton then took office, but in 1885 he in turn was defeated
by Sir John Downer, while Sir John Bray was on a visit to Great Britain. When the latter
returned he accepted a portfolio under his former colleague. This combination was generally
known as the “Downer-Bray administration." In 1886 Sir John Downer proceeded to England
to attend an Imperial conference, and Sir John Bray became Acting-Premier. Before the
Chiefs return, the Ministry, in June, 1887, was defeated by Mr. Thomas Playford. Dr.
J J ! J J
Cockburn succeeded Mr. Playford in June, 1889, but in August, 1890, the see-saw
reversed, and he had to give way again to the latter. In the new combination Sir John
Bray filled the office of Chief Secretary—under his old political enemy, be it noted.
The Speaker of the House of Assembly (Sir R. D. Ross) having died during
recess, upon the House re-assembling on May 31, 1888. Sir J. C. Bray was elected as Speaker;
but he only held the position till June 5, 1890, preferring the greater excitement to be
found on the floor of the House to the quiet dignity of the Speaker’s chair. \\Tilst
Speaker he received his knighthood, an honor which he had declined some years previously.
In deference to the wish of Mr. Playford, in 1892 Sir John Bray resigned his
portfolio in order to fill the position of Agent-General in London. Early in 1892 he
proceeded to England, and there he remained until 1894. The rigorous climate of the
old country did not agree with his health, and he left England to return to South Australia.
When nearing Colombo in the Oceana , the popular politician died on June 13, 1894. Pi is
death was so sudden that the news was received with consternation throughout the Province,
and innumerable expressions of sorrow were forwarded to the late knight’s relatives. A
chorus of lament mingled with eulogy arose on every side, and Sir John Bray’s demise
was looked upon in the light of a public calamity. It is certain that, had he survived, his
position in the Province during recent years would have been important and useful.
During his political career Sir John Bray materially affected the interests of South
Australia. Being a son of the soil, so to speak, he naturally held the country very close
to his heart, and whatever he did was done with the earnest and enthusiastic desire to
serve his native land. He sponsored numbers of measures which were calculated to
stimulate development and good government, and he gave of his talents and his energy
freely and conscientiously. In the less public but humane arenas of utility, he devoted
his time and his purse to philanthropy. He was associated with numbers of charitable
bodies, and was a patron of healthy sport. His presence in the Province was so indispensable
that in Parliament and other spheres his want has been felt more than is generally recognised.
His friends cherish the memory of the kindly and sympathetic knight, while the people of
South Australia generally mourn the loss of an exceptionally able, upright, open-handed, and
open-hearted public man.

Hon. Sir John Colton, K.C.M.G.
I T is fitting Royalty should acknowledge in a distinctive manner the useful work done
by colonial public men in their public cause. Official decorations have from time to
time been conferred on prominent Australian politicians, in recognition of services
rendered in the moulding of Greater Britain ; and of South Australians thus distinguished
none has been more deserving of
the recognition than Sir John
o J
Colton. This political veteran
was born in Devonshire in 1823,
and came to Adelaide with his
father in 1839. He followed
various commercial pursuits until
he reached the age of 19 years,
when he established a small
business which has now grown
into the well-known firm of Colton
and Co., wholesale harness and
hardware merchants. The expan-
sion of the business kept pace
with the growth of the Province,
and reached such substantial
proportions that a few years ago
it was floated into a limited
company. Sir John was actively
identified with his business until
1883, when he retired after a
commercial life of great industry.
Political and municipal duties
also claimed his attention. He
was chosen Alderman of the Citv
of Adelaide in 1859, and in 1862
was returned at the head of the
poll to the House of Assembly for the district of Noarlunga, a constituency which he represented
throughout the whole of his active political career. Into the question of social politics, Sir John
with an ardent desire for progressive legislation, entered with keen enthusiasm. His attitude
in the House always commanded respect, and his speeches were listened to with close
attention. It was a matter of little surprise in political circles when he was asked to take
the Commissionership of Public Works in the Strangways Ministry in 1868. He held
this portfolio for two years, during which time his official duties were discharged with
shrewd administrative ability. One of the measures introduced by the Strangways Ministry
was that of a uniform land tax of a halfpenny per acre, and Sir John loyally adhered to


the wishes of his colleagues, though the Bill was anything but favorably viewed in his
electorate. Ihe result was that Sir John lost his seat at the next general elections; but
after the lapse of one Parliament he was again elected for his old constituency.
His capabilities and untiring energy in regard to municipal affairs had not
meanwhile been allowed to pass unnoticed, and he was elected to the position of Mayor
of Adelaide in 1874. Ihe Chief Magistrate’s chair had few such able occupants, and his
tenure ot office was characterised by assiduous attention to promotive matters in municipal
legislation, as well as tactful generalship in directing the deliberations of the civic fathers.
Contemporaneous with this official dignity was his accession to the Boucaut Ministry as
Treasurer. In this capacity he took a leading part in formulating “the great and
comprehensive policy ’ which marked the Ministry’s occupancy of the Treasury benches.
In June, 1876, Sir John Colton formed a Government of his own, and for 16
months held the Premiership of the Province. But with the kaleidoscopic changes in
Ministries that were the usual feature of those days of political unrest, the Boucaut
Government again came into power in October, 1877. Sir John Colton’s health was now
tailing, and so critical did it become that in August of the following year he resigned his
seat and made a lengthened tour of the world for recuperation, after his many years of
incessant and wearying work. On his return to South Australia he re-entered the Assembly
' O j
in the new Parliament of 1881. In June of that year the late Sir William Morgan retired
from the Premiership, and with his resignation came that of his Ministers. One of these,
the late Hon. G. C. Hawker, having declined to form a new Cabinet, Sir John Colton
was sent for by the Governor ; but on account of ill-health he had to reluctantly decline
the task with which it was sought to entrust him. He, however, suggested a former
colleague in the person of Sir J. C. Bray, with the result that a new Ministry was formed
by that gentleman. Sir John, seeing that his health was again beginning to wane, took
another trip to Europe. The change had a salutary effect, and he returned to the arena
of political discussion to take his seat on the Opposition benches. The reason for this
change of position in the House was attributable to Sir John Colton’s strenuous resistance
to a Property Tax Bill which Sir John Bray desired to adopt. He succeeded in carrying
a motion of want of confidence in his political god-child, and was not long in office before
he induced Parliament to inaugurate what he deemed a more equitable land and income
tax In 1885, Sir John Colton’s Ministry retired from office, and was succeeded by the
Downer Government. In 1887 he retired finally from the noisy arena of politics, heelings
of unfeigned regret were expressed far and wide at this withdrawal of his public services.
Appreciation of his political conduct found unanimous acclaim, when in the new year of
1892 Sir John Colton received the distinguished order of K.C.M.G.
/
His connection with religious, social, and charitable movements cannot be effaced
from the memories of those for whom he so generously and disinterestedly labored. He
has ever been a prominent member of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, as well as a
Sunday-school teacher and superintendent. His philanthropic disposition is reflected in
his many benefactions. His life, both in public and private, has been genuinely sincere;
his private business, lucrative as it undoubtedly was, has ever been sacrificed on the altar
of public devotion ; and round his name are gathered deep feelings of venerable regard.

Sir Charles Todd, K.C.M.G., M.A, F.R.S., F.R.A.S., etc.
THE importation of scientific men from England from time to time marks an important
stage in the progressive history of the colonies. When as yet the bucolic era
reigned undisturbed, little was expected in the way of scientific facilities by the rustic
selector, and possibly less was received. But the birth of various industries and manufactures,
and the consequent endeavors to
form connections with the world
of commerce beyond its territory,
induced each colony to strive to
possess those conveniences which
alone could ensure progress and
progressive prosperity.
It was consequent on the
imperative need for organisation
of the South Australian Telegraph
Department, that an invitation
was extended by the Government
of South Australia to Mr. Charles
Todd, a young Englishman, who
had, however, even then won
favorable distinction in England in
the mathematical faculty of Physics.
J J
Not only had his scholastic
J
qualifications been proved, but
extra - Academic success in the
world of experience and practice
had stamped him as exceptionally
qualified. Astronomy, which
seems an appendage to the con-
trol of Posts and Telegraphs in
the Australian colonies, was the
subject in which he had specially
gained his laurels in England. But this absorbing study had to stoop somewhat to the
more urgent demands of systematic development of the electric system. Mr. Todd’s
acceptation ol the offer made to him inaugurated a new era in the Department, and the
value of his services can be measured by the extension of the telegraph system, by the
efficiency of the postal arrangements, and by the undoubted advantages he has conferred on
the whole of the Australian colonies by the memorable achievement of the establishment of
the Transcontinental wire.
Sir Charles Todd was born at Islington, London, on July 7, 1826. and received
his primary education at the Greenwich Schools. On December 6, 1841, he entered the


Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and it may be mentioned that while in this service he
was one of the earliest observers of the wonderful planet Neptune. The discovery of
this long-concealed world was a great triumph of the reasoning methods of inductive
logic. From the hour ol his admission to the observatorial service, Sir Charles labored
unrelaxingly. To such proficiency did he attain in a few years that he attracted the
notice of the Astronomer-Royal, who evinced satisfaction at the success of his early career.
Alter seven years of faithful and student-like devotion to the foundation sciences of the
Observatory, he left the service of that institution to accept the post of Assistant-Astronomer
at Cambridge to the late Rev. Professor Chalice. In this great scholastic arena, Sir
Charles (then plain Mr. Todd) pursued his investigations amidst an elevated mental
atmosphere, and his operations in the laboratory proved him to be a scientist of unusual
ability. The ardent young astronomer next accepted the offer of Sir G. B. Airy (then
Mr. Air)’), the late Astronomer-Royal, of the position of Assistant-Astronomer at the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich.
For a year Sir Charles held this position, when the position of Superintendent
of Telegraphs and Government Astronomer for the Province of South Australia was offered
to him through the Astronomer-Royal (the late Sir G. B. Airy). This appointment was
accepted, and he left England in July, 1855, to undertake his new duties.
It may fairly be said that Sir Charles Todd practically inaugurated the electric
telegraph system in South Australia. Under his skilful superintendence connecting wires
were constructed through different parts of the Province, and a well-woven network of
electrical communications was spread over it in a comparatively short period ol time. The
enthusiasm and willing enterprise of the Government enabled him to carry out this work
with less of the hindrance and difficulty which usually retards developmental work of a
scientific kind. The value of the new system soon became generally recognised ; and it
was seen that Sir Charles had initiated a successful policy of extending communications
throughout the Province, which was to develop with the growth of time.
His greatest achievement, and that with which his name will ever be associated,
is the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph line from Port Darwin to Adelaide.
Western Europe had done her ample share in this utilitarian venture. She had brought
the cable through submarine depths to the shores of North Australia ; and there it lay
waiting for the enterprising spirit of Australia to join ends. South Australia supplied
the necessary finance and enthusiasm, and under Sir Charles Todd’s personal survey and
superintendence, the line was successfully laid, across the desert and through the bush, from
top to bottom of the Continent. Many are the stories that are told of the great privations
and vicissitudes endured by those who carried out the work of erecting the line through
the little-known interior wastes. But the personal stimulus of the indefatigable Sir Charles
animated the workers, while his capacity as an organiser facilitated their laborious and
dangerous task. Sir Charles had ridden across the stretch of 2,000 miles now spanned by
the wire, and inspected the route throughout, thus qualifying himself for directing the
undertaking. On its completion in August, 1872, amid the congratulations of Pmgland and
3U
sirCTodd ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


the colonies, Sir Charles was awarded warm thanks for his valuable labors, by notable
representative bodies in all parts of the world. In the undertaking- Sir Charles was ably
assisted by Mr. R. R. Knuckey, who shared his enthusiasm and not a little of his scientific
• j
ardor, bor this achievement the Queen bestowed on Sir Charles the order of C.M.G. At a
later date (1893) he was further honored by receiving the order of K.C.M.G.
On the amalgamation of the Post and Telegraph Departments in 1870, Sir
Charles became Postmaster-General, and in this official capacity he has taken part as the
representative of South Australia in almost all the Australian Conventions assembled to
discuss matters connected with the postal service. In 1885 he represented the Province
at the International Telegraphic Conference held at Berlin. Much valuable information
was acquired by him at this scientific gathering, and the interchange of useful and progressive
opinion among the authorities at this meeting was not without good effect in connection
with the postal service of South Australia. On the breaking up of the Convention (in
1886) Sir Charles proceeded to England, where he delivered a paper before the Royal
Colonial Institute on “ I elegraphic enterprise in Australia.” For his many services in
the interests of science and commercial advancement, he received from the Senate of
Cambridge University the honorary degree of M.A. (>honoris causa).
As Government Astronomer of the Province, Sir Charles has pursued careful
investigations and instituted many researches in this department. An extensive series of
astronomical and meteorological observations has been tabulated under his direction, and
has proved of great service to the Province from time to time.
Sir Charles is a bellow of the Royal Society of England, Fellow of the Royal
Astronomical Society, a Fellow of the British Meteorological Society, and an honorary
al Society of Edinburgh. Over and above these enviable distinctions,
he has been elected a member of two advanced European scientific institutes. In South
Australia he has been a hard and successful worker for the advancement of science. The
I and the I institute of Surveyors of South Australia have both received from
him prominent and ready support, and his large fund of general as well as special information
has contributed no little to the prestige of these two scientifically promotive institutions.
I he University of Adelaide found in him an able adviser as well as a genial sympathiser.
He is still a member of the Council of the University, for whose welfare his energies are
ever ready. He sits on the Board of Governors of the Public Library, Museum, and Art
Gallery, and was for many years a member of the Council of the South Australian School
of Mines. His enthusiasm is not apparently focussed on one point. It radiates in whatever
direction he can render assistance in the way of educational or intellectual advance. Few
Australians can look down the valley of their past official life, as he can, and see so many
monuments of serviceable work and so many evidences of worth and skill. Certainly few
exceed Sir Charles in the length of official service; for, in 1891, he had the unusual
happiness of celebrating the jubilee of his entrance into the Government service.
Congratulations and good wishes for his prolonged health flowed in pleasantly on that
occasion, and Sir Charles could not. on these manifestations, but feel gratified that the
results of his life-long, arduous labors were duly appreciated by those whom he had served.

The late Hon. Sir William Milne
AMONG the names distinguished in South Australian history, Sir William Milne’s is
not the least. Arriving in the Province less than three years after its proclamation, he
w r as at first prominently associated with business affairs. Upon the inauguration of
responsible government he entered Parliament, and pursued an extensive and successful
career as a Minister of the Crown.
His name was one of the most
familiar among the veteran settlers,
and a sketch of his life wall be
interesting, not only to them, but
to the younger members of the
j o
community as well.
He wvis the eldest son of Mr.
William Milne, of West Common,
near Glasgow, and was born on
May 17, 1822. His father was a
Glasgow merchant. Upon leaving
the High School, the voting man
O J ’
was engaged for some years in his
OO
parent’s office. He left Scotland
in 1839, for the then recently
established Province of South
Australia, and landed at Holdfast
Bav on October 29 of that year,
J '
from the barque Palmyra. A
few lightly-stocked pastoral stations
were already in existence, and
upon one of these the young
colonist gained a useful experience.
But at this time the prospects of
the little community were very
gloomy, and soon a financial
o J
cataclvsm caused a serious exodus
of people. In 18/| 2 Mr. Milne went to Hobart, I asmama, to fill <ui cippointment in the
Commissariat Department. Happily, he did not elect to settle permanently in the island
colony, but, after three years, returned to South Australia. Having entered into partnership
with his brother-indaw, he founded a wine arid spirit connection in Adelaide. He afterwards
took over the business of the late Mr. Patrick Auld. His ventures were so successful that in
[857 he sold his business and retired. Ihe story ot his connection with commeicial affaiis
is short, as his rise and retirement were rapid.
When responsible government was inaugurated he w r as elected one ot the pioneei


members of the Assembly. He was chosen for Onkaparinga on March 9, 1857, representing
that constituency until 1868. In 1869 he was elected to the Legislative Council, and held a
seat until 1881. In 1876 he had the dignity of Knight Bachelor conferred upon him in
recognition of his splendid services to the Province and to responsible government.
p'or a period aggregating five years and eight months Sir William Milne was a
Minister of the Crown, principally in the Crown Lands Office. He held the Lands portfolio
in the first Baker Administration from August 21 to September 1, 1857 ; in the Hanson
Ministry from July 5, 1859, to May 9, i860; in the Ayers Ministry from July 22 to
August 4, 1864; and in the Boucaut Ministry from March 28. 1866, to May 3, 1867. As
Commissioner of Public Works he served in the reconstructed Cabinet of the Hon. G. M.
Waterhouse from February 19, 1862- to July 4, 1863, and in the Blyth Administration from
August 4, 1864, to March 22, 1865. He was Chief Secretary in the Hart Government
from May 30, 1870. to November 10, 1871, and in the succeeding Ministry of Sir Arthur
Blyth from November 10, 1871, to January 22, 1872. He thus served the State in many
important capacities, and was a member of more Cabinets than but few other South
Australians. In his day he was in the forefront of politics, and was esteemed as an
administrator whose assistance was invaluable, and whose departmental work was characterised
by industry and thoroughness. He was a public speaker of considerable force, and his clear
and concise language, with his sincere demeanor, gained general respect in debate. Indeed,
he was a political warrior of tried and respected powers. He was one of the first Ministers
of the Crown in South Australia. While Commissioner of Crown Lands he sponsored
several useful Bills, and inaugurated valuable reforms. He introduced the Scrub Lands
Act, which enabled and encouraged settlers to take up lands which were previously practically
unutilised. He introduced a Scab in Sheep Act, and initiated legislation which resulted
in the transformation of many swamp and lagoon areas in the South-East into rich alluvial
country. Through his instrumentality, agricultural settlement was given a great impetus.
He was one of the most earnest supporters of Sir R. R. Torrens’ famous Real Property
Act. Railways, telegraphs, water supplies, and other public works received very substantial
assistance from him. The Bill providing for the construction of the Overland Telegraph
line through South Australia to Port Darwin, and connecting by cable with the chief
electric systems of the world, was introduced by the Government of which he was a member.
He rendered valuable assistance in the passing of the Bill, and was Chief Secretary while
the work was being carried out. He warmly advocated the establishment of water supplies
at Port Augusta and at Port Adelaide, and took official part in their construction.
But it is not possible to give full details of the many political services of Sir
William Milne. His contemporaries considered that he thoroughly deserved knighthood, and
he was sincerely complimented when he received that distinction. Upon the death of Sir
John Morphett he was elected, on June 25, 1873, President of the Legislative Council, and
he continued in that important office for several years.
Almost throughout his career he was prominent in public matters. He was for
many years chairman of the Central Roads Board, and took an active part in the Volunteer
movement. He was a member of both the Mounted and Foot P'orces, and held a
340
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Hon Sir W. Milne


Captain s commission. P'or a number of years he represented several wealthy absentees,
and was for a long period Chairman of the Wallaroo and Moonta Mines Company, besides
others. He was a trustee of the Savings Bank, and was a member of the Council of the
Zoological Acclimatisation Society. He was also a member of the Committee of the Blind
<*> J
and Deaf and Dumb Institution.
Sir William attained a ripe old age in South Australia, and was a magnificent
example of the healthiness of the climate. Even though his local career had been an
active one, it was in itself the span of a long life. Por several of his last years he lived
in well earned retirement, and then, on April 23, 1895, he died at his country residence
at Mount Lofty. On his death the newspapers published very flattering eulogiums upon
the veteran, and agreed that he had been a durable bulwark to the State. His eldest son
is Mr. William Milne, who was born in Adelaide in 1849.
The reader may judge, from this hurried sketch, of the prominent place Sir
William Milne holds in the history of South Australia. He devoted his talents sincerely to
the welfare of the Province, and was as popular and respected in private as in public life.
The late Mr. George Woodroffe Goyder, C.M.G.
GOYDER’S line of rainfall ” has become almost a proverb in the Province signifying
an imaginary line defined by Mr. Ooyder as separating the wet from the dry
districts of South Australia, based upon observations made by that gentleman during
a 30,000 miles’ ride on horseback over the pastoral lands. Mr. Ooyder was born in 1824,
and received his education at Glasgow. After serving an apprenticeship with a firm of
engineers, he emigrated to South Australia in 1848, entering the public ser\ ice on June
io? 185 1. On January 17, 1 853, he became Chief Clerk in the Lands Office ; was appointed
Assistant Surveyor-General on September 14, 1854; Deputy Surveyor-General on January
1, 1858; and Surveyor-General on January 19, 1861, occupying that position until his
resignation on June 30, 1894- In the furtherance of his official duties he made several
exploratory expeditions to the interior of the Province, and was sent to the Northern
Territory upon the recall of the Hon. B. T. Finniss. Whilst there he fixed upon Palmerston
as the site for the capital, and surveyed some 500,000 acres in the surrounding neighborhood.
For this work he was given the thanks of the Parliament and a bonus of Other
of his official duties were the valuation of pastoral leases, the draining and reclaiming of
swampy country —more particularly in the South-East, and the conserving and providing
of water by damming or well-sinking for the development of the far northern country.
After his retirement he lived at Warrakilla, near Echunga, in the hills, where he had an
orchard and valuable estate. He died on November 2. 1898.

Sir Langdon Bonython
rj-' HE Advertiser has always had the advantage of being under the definite editorial
y control of one man. It was started by a company, but the articles of agreement
prescribed that Mr. J. H. Barrow should guide its policy without interference from
any of his co-directors. Through the changes of ownership which took place between
that date and the time of his
death in 1874, the same conditions
operated. Sir John Langdon
Bonython joined the staff of the
paper in December, 1864, and
though then only 16 years of age,
he rapidly acquired relations of a
confidential nature with the
founder of the paper, much of
whose spirit was breathed into
him. He always admired Mr.
Barrow, and he set himself to
work to master his methods and
to put himself en rapport with
his policy. When the senior
proprietor died, Sir Langdon had
already attained a position of
considerable influence, and was
always consulted in the higher
matters of policy. He has a
natural aptitude and a keen
insight, which made him from
the beginning an ideal journalist,
and he seldom allowed the paper
to go astray, even when he was
not its ruling force. Many years
ago, he became the absolute
arbiter of its destiny, and the
progress of The Advertiser is an eloquent testimony to Sir Langdons skill, judgment,
and* tireless industry. He recognised the need there was for fostering the struggling
manufactures of the Province, and by the constant and forcible advocacy of a protective
system in the columns of The Advertiser that help they so urgently required was
rendered at the opportune moment, so that the profitable export trade which South
Australia now enjoys, as well as its internal commercial health, is due in a very large
measure to his patriotism and foresight.
Sir Langdon again proved that he knew “ the season when to take occasion by


the hand,” when in 1881 he saw 7 the general demand tor cheap papers, and advocated the
reduction of the price of The Advertiser to one penny. As public support was more
and more liberally accorded, Sir Langdon showed a greater desire to retain and increase
it. The Advertiser grew in size and attractiveness as the years rolled on, and it is still
O J
growing. Machinery of the most modern description was added as the existing plant
passed out of date, and at the present moment there is not a newspaper office in the
world which is better equipped than that over which Sir Langdon rules, w'hile there is
no other city or town of the same size as Adelaide which can show anything even
approximating to The Advertiser in completeness of outfit or extent of circulation. It
was the first office in South Australia to employ a stereotyping plant or a really up-to-date
printing press ; and at the present moment it is w y ell in advance of every other office in
the Province. The clear view of business needs in the establishment has been paralleled
by the clearness of vision concerning the wants of the Province.
In its policy, as in its management, it has always been progressive. It has
sought the good of the Province as a whole —the producer, the artisan, the commercial
man, the manufacturer, and the capitalist without respect to class or party. Sir
Langdon has always been independent of outside influence, and he has pressed forward
consistently to the goal he set before him, which was the prosperity and stability of
South Australia as a nation. Largely as the result of this high-minded seeking after
the best things, rather than those which seemed to be expedient at the time, the way
has been made clear for the Province to enter the Federal compact with an assured
confidence that it would not suffer by the trade competition of the neighboring States.
The paper and its attitude towards the genuine advancement of the people, of
whom it is the most potent champion, have always been Sir Langdon s chief concern.
With all his weight of work and responsibility, however, he has not been a man of
one interest. He has always displayed a willingness to step outside the editorial office
to help in oublic matters in his capacity as a private individual, where he could do real
good by such action ; for he does not value mere complimentary offices, and when he
accepts a position he is ready to undertake all the duties fairly appertaining to it.
Sir Langdon Bonython was born in London on October 15, 1848, and is a son
of Mr. George Langdon Bonython. On the father’s side he represents the main branch
of an ancient Cornish family- the Bonythons of Bonython and Caiclew, who were
landowners in Cornwall more than seven centuries ago. Sir Langdon came to South
Australia with his parents, both of whom still survive, when he was quite a child ; and
he was educated in Adelaide, one of his earliest teachers at Brougham School having-
been Mr. T. Burgan, now a member of the Board of Inspectors which controls the
Department of Public Instruction. Having early shown a leaning towards literature,
Sir Langdon, directly after leaving school, secured a position on the staff of Ihe Advertiser,
and there won an immediate place in the esteem and confidence of Mr. J. H. Barrow,
who was a keen judge of character. To that gentleman’s guidance Sir Langdon has
always acknowledged a very great indebtedness, and he attributes his success to the


kindly interest which Mr. Barrow took in his work. He did work. too. The staff of
the paper was very small in those days, and the responsibilities of each member of it
were exceedingly heavy. Sir Langdon, however, never showed any disposition to shirk
the many and various duties imposed upon him, although his very willingness to be of
service increased the number of the tasks laid upon him. He toiled tor the love of it, and
because he was deeply interested in the success of the paper never stopping to ask
whether the engagement allotted, or which he had voluntarily undertaken because he saw
it needed doing, did or did not come within his proper routine. If others made their
labor as light as possible, that was a matter for themselves; he had no inclination to
follow their example.
Sir Langdon’s zeal, though actuated by a higher motive, brought its due reward
in rapid and substantial promotion. While quite a youth he was made chief of the reporting
staff, and shortly afterwards he became sub-editor, which office very soon developed into
that of managing editor. In 1878 Sir Langdon received a proot of the confidence of his
employers by being admitted a member of the firm of Messrs. Barrow & King, a place
in the proprietorship being at the same time found for the late Mr. hrederic B. Burden,
a step-son of Mr. Barrow. Mr. Thomas King retired from the partnership in 1884. the
style of the firm being then changed to that of Messrs. Burden & Bonython ; while, in
1893, Mr. Burden, who had previously gone to England, parted with his interest, and Sir
Langdon Bonython became sole proprietor, being then not 45 years of age. Seldom,
anywhere else, has there been such a steady record of individual progress won entirely
by merit and industry.
Sir Langdon has long taken a deep interest in education, believing, as he does,
that there is no nobler vocation than that of the teacher. His enthusiasm in the cause
has been demonstrated in a very practical manner. He was gazetted a member of the
Adelaide School Board when it was created on August io, 1881, and two years later he
became chairman, an office which he still fills with accustomed conscientiousness. In that
capacity he exercises control over the principal schools of the metropolis, and his influence
has ever proved of a beneficial character, alike to the State, the teachers, and the children.
In 1886, Sir Langdon was appointed a member of the Technical Education Commission,
on whose recommendation the splendid School of Mines and Industries, now one of the
principal glories of the South Australian education system, was established. Indeed, it
was due to his initiative that the proposal took definite shape. He was an original member
of the Council of the institution, in which he has ever manifested more than a father’s
interest; and when, in 1889, Sir John Cockburn, the first president, became Premier of
the Province, Sir Langdon succeeded to that honorable post, the executive work of which
he has since performed in a signally successful manner. It was owing to his tireless care
that the school lived through the troublous times immediately following its birth ; and it
is chiefly due to his energy, prudence, and forethought that it has attained its present
status. The knighthood conferred upon him by Her Majesty the Queen in May, 1898,
was a fitting recognition of the magnificent services rendered to the cause of education ;
and it is pleasant to know that the earliest congratulations on the reception of that richly-
deserved honor came from the members of the Adelaide Teachers’ Association, who,
344
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Sir Langdon Bonython


during the following August, tendered him a banquet, at which the attendance was very
large and completely representative. Another important position, in an educational sense,
held by Sir Langdon is the presidency of the Council of the Roseworthy College, the
chief centre of agricultural instruction in the Province. Sir Langdon was a Commissioner
for South Australia to the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in 1888, and many years
previous to that date he was gazetted a Justice of the Peace. He is vice-president of the
Council of the South Australian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia,
and he was a founder and vice-president (the chief office being occupied by Sir James
Boucaut) of the Cornish Association. Many other offices have been filled by him, and
indeed no opportunity of assisting in the intellectual or social advantage of the land he
loves so well has ever been neglected. His reputation has gone out through the length
and breadth of the Province, and in other Australian cities as well as in Great Britain
he is known because of his patriotic desire to prove in all respects a good and useful
friend of progress and culture.
Sir Langdon is an excellent platform speaker and trenchant writer. His method
is to go to the heart of things with as little circumlocution as possible, and both his
utterances and his articles are full (A point, vigor, and eloquence. Politically he has always
been a great power, as well as socially, but he has never wielded his influence for selfish
ends, and he has never allowed himself to be placed under an obligation to any particular
party. His whole career has been marked by a manly spirit of independence, which has
compelled universal respect. He takes a great delight in books, and possesses one of the
most valuable libraries to be found in any private house in Australia. His pride in his
Cornish ancestry has made him a devoted student of the history of Cornwall and its
people, concerning both of which he is a recognised authority. His busy life contains no
idle moments, and the recreations of his leisure are all part of his great plan tor
continually acquiring knowledge. Until the winter of 1900 he took no holidays, but an
illness caused by close application to work compelled him then to take a sea voyage, and
he made a long-desired journey to Europe, where, however, he continued his faxorite
pursuits, and concentrated his attention on the accumulation of information likely to
be of service to his much-loved School of Mines and other institutions with which he is
officially connected.
Sir Langdon’s eldest son, Mr. Lavmgton Bonython, is closely associated with
his father in the management of The Advertiser and its kindred papers.

Edward Charles Stirling, C.M.G., M.A., M.D., F.K. S., F.R.C.S.,
Corresponding Member of the Royal Zoological Society of London ; Honorary Fellow of the Anthropological Institute
of Great Britain and Ireland; Fellow of the Medical and Chirurgical Society; Member of the Clinical Society of
London; Member of the Physiological Society; Professor of Physiology in the University of Adelaide; Director
of the South Australian Museum
THE dominant feature of Professor Stirling’s life has been his devoted labors in the cause
of science. His reputation in this direction is not confined merely to the Province
in which he was born, but has sped
so far that he has received decoration
from the Queen and acknowledgment
from foreign Royalty. It would indeed
be hard to estimate the value of the
work he has contributed to scientific
research, more especially of that relating
to the anthropology and fauna of Aus-
tralia. As a young man his career
was brilliant, and it is gratifying to
O J o
know that in the maturer years of life
he has drawn additional distinction to
his name.
Edward Charles Stirling was born
at Strathalbyn, South Australia, in 1848,
and is the eldest son of the late
Hon. Edward Stirling, formerly a
member of the Legislative Council of
this Province. He was educated
primarily at St. Peter’s College, at that
time under the guiding hand of Arch-
deacon Earr. Leaving St. Peter’s, he
proceeded to the Continent, studying
for some time in Germany and France,
after which he matriculated as a student
at Trinity College, Cambridge. He
graduated there as 8.A., with honors
in natural science, and in due course proceeded to the degree of M.A. Embracing
medicine as a profession, Dr. Stirling graduated as M.B. and M.D. at the University.
Having meanwhile entered as a student at St. George’s Hospital, London, he became
a Member, and subsequently acquired the higher distinction of the Fellowship of the
Royal College of Surgeons, England. At the close of his studentship he was appointed
House Surgeon at St. George's, and a few years subsequently was elected on the
staff as Assistant Surgeon. In addition to this post at St. George’s, he also became
successively, Lecturer on Microscopic Anatomy, joint Lecturer on Operative Surgery, and


Lecturer on Physiology, at that institution. He was also elected Surgeon to the Belgrave
Hospital for Sick Children.
These positions Dr. Stirling resigned in 1881, and, returning to the land
of his birth, he was very shortly afterwards elected Lecturer on Physiology at the
Adelaide University a position which he held until 1900, when the Lectureship was
converted into a Professorship, Dr. Stirling being then appointed to the new Chair.
In his position as a member of the Council of the University, he has taken a prominent
share in the foundation of the Medical School which has been so liberally endowed by the
J J
late Sir Thomas Elder. As a teacher he has taken a large and active share in its work
ever since its establishment. Having been appointed Surgeon to the Adelaide Hospital
soon after his arrival in South Australia, he eventually became Senior Surgeon, and held
that position until the resignation of the whole medical staff took place at the time of the
Hospital dispute.
Appointed in 1882, Dr. Stirling was for many years a member ol the Board of
Governors of the Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, and he now occupies the position
of Director of the Museum, which owes much to his management. He was appointed first
President of the State Children’s Department on its establishment as an independent institution,
and this position he held for two years. In medical matters he has taken a prominently active
part, having been President of the South Australian branch of the British Medical Association.
In 1887 he was elected, though he did not serve, as President of the first Intercolonial
Medical Congress, held in Adelaide. In the following year he was nominated, and acted, as
President of the Section of Surgery at the Congress held in Melbourne. With Dr. Paterson,
he represented South Australia in 1888 on a Royal Commission held in Sydney with
the object of ascertaining how far it might be possible to apply the dissemination of
infective diseases (particularly Pasteur’s chicken cholera) to the destruction of rabbits.
In 1892 he was elected corresponding member of the Royal Zoological Society of London ;
and in the same year received a gold medal from the Queen Regent of Holland for “services
to science.” The following year he received the signal honor of election as a Fellow of
the Royal Society of England. He has been President of the Royal Society of South
Australia, and is the author of many scientific works and papers in connection with that
body, the Royal Zoological Society of London, the Intercolonial Medical Congresses, the
British Medical Association, and several other societies.
Professor Stirling’s scientific work has not been entirely confined to the laboratory,
for in 1892 he accompanied Lord Kintore on his journey across the continent from
Port Darwin to Adelaide; and in 1891 he took part in the work of the Horn exploring
expedition to Central Australia as medical officer and anthropologist, embodying the results
of his labors in a paper which forms part of the published report of that expedition.
His name is perhaps best known in connection with the remarkable blind marsupial mole,
Notoryctes typhlops , discovered at Idracowra Station, on the P'inke, by Mr. J. F. Bishop,
which his description in the “ Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia ” first
made known to the scientific world. His name, in conjunction with that of Mr. Zietz, will
also be remembered m connection with a discovery at Lake Gallabonna (originally made
some years ago by Mr. Raglessj of an immense deposit of fossil bones. 1 hese included


many remains of the huge marsupial, Diprotodon australis; and, amongst others, w'ere
those of a wingless bird as large as the moa of New Zealand, which has been made
known under the name of Genyornis newtom.
It is not within the scope of this notice to give full details of Dr. Stirlings
accomplishments in science, but the distinction of C.M.G. which the Queen conferred on
him in 1893, and his election to the Royal Society, were indications that his work was
highly meritorious. Only once has Dr. Stirling entered politics, and that was in 1884,
when he was elected at the top of the poll for North Adelaide, his colleague being the
late Mr. G. C. Hawker. Whilst in the Legislature he took a keen interest in the question
of Woman’s Suffrage, and was the first to propose and carry, though without an absolute
majority, a measure for the admission of women to the franchise. Being defeated at the
next election, in 1887, he has not since sought to enter the political arena. His brother,
the Hon. J. L. Stirling, is a conspicuous member of the Legislative Council.
It is by the work of such men that South Australia makes herself known among
the highest and most cultured men of the age. In its particular and select sphere this is
as indispensable as a reputation for advanced political economy. Dr. Stirling’s name will
be handed down to subsequent generations as a leading scientist, a successful teacher, and
a worthy citizen.
Hon. J. H. Howe, M.L.C.
IN the county town of Forfar, Scotland, the Hon. J. H. Howe was born in 1839, and
at the age of 16 he sailed for South Australia. On his arrival he joined the Mounted
Police P’orce. For some time he remained in this capacity, gaining a great knowledge
of the interior, which has stood him in good stead in his political life, more particularly in
his administration of the Crown Lands Department. He afterwards started business at
Gawler; and it was in that town he first entered into municipal life, being chosen by the
people of that municipality to serve them as councillor. He next engaged in grazing
and agricultural pursuits. In 1881 he was returned to the House of Assembly for the
Stanley District. From 1884 to 1896 he represented the District of Gladstone, the change
being due to an alteration in the Electoral Act. At the general elections of 1896 Mr.
Howe lost his seat. In 1897, he was elected a member of the Legislative Council for
the Northern District. For his knowledge of land legislation and administrative ability,
Sir John Downer twice apportioned him the portfolio of Commissioner of Crown Fands.
He was also Commissioner of Public Works in the Cockburn Government ; and in
July, 1890, was made “Honorable” for life. Mr. Howe is associated with many mining,
commercial, and pastoral pursuits in various parts of the Province. He was one of the
delegates of the Province at the Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne Federal Conventions, and
to the discussions on the Commonwealth Bill he brought a full and ready mind. Mr. Howe
has ever been a true friend to the deserving poor ; and his proposal to give the Federal
Parliament power to legislate for “ invalid and old-age pensions ” was carried by an
overwhelming majority before the work of the Convention terminated.

Hon. Thomas PI ay ford, M.P.
j
FOR number of terms of Ministerial responsibility held in South Australia, the Hon.
Mr. Playford and Sir Henry Ayers probably hold the record. Each has very
substantially impressed his judgment and vigor on the pages of local history, and
each has been an enthusiastic friend of the Province. Mr. Playford has held office in
seven Administrations, in two of
which he was Premier, and, reckon
ing re-constructed Ministries, has
been a member of ten. So ex-
cellent and straightforward has
been his conduct that he has
earned the popular sobriquet of
“ Honest Tom ” —a name that has
clung to him for many years.
Thomas Playford was born in
London in 1837, and is the eldest
son of the late Rev. Thomas
Playford, for many years pastor
of the Bentham Street Chapel,
Adelaide. The latter was one of
our earliest colonial ministers, and,
when quite young, entered the
army and served in the Life
Guards under Wellington at
Waterloo. “This gentleman,"
says a biographer, “was highly
esteemed for his many excellent
qualities and unassuming de-
meanor.’ The family came to
South Australia in 1843, and here
the subject of this memoir received
his education. But though not
privileged to enjoy a lengthy career at school, he was a very ready pupil when he entered
into manhood ; and all South Australians respect the solid information which he is possessed
of. For many years he was engaged in farming at Mitcham, whereupon he proceeded
to Norton’s Summit and cultivated one of the finest fruit gardens in Australia. I his has
been the occupation of Mr. Playford’s life, and he is never happier than when, escaping
from his political duties, he is able to quietly tend his orchard and his vegetables.
As a youth, Mr. Playford was attracted to debating societies, and in such a useful
training ground acquired his undoubted power in debate. Upon taking up his residence


at Norton’s Summit he evinced an active interest in local government matters, and for
2i years was chairman of the East Torrens District Council. He was for three years a
member ot the Central Road Board, and for five years president of the Association of
District Chairmen. The rugged strength of his views caused the electors of Onkaparinga
to return him to the House of Assembly in 1868 ; and then began one of the most useful
and meritorious parliamentary careers enjoyed by any man in South Australia. He served
Onkaparinga in two Parliaments, and then spent three years in retirement. In 1875
he was elected for East Torrens, a district which he continuously represented until 1887. In
the latter year he was not returned, but was immediately elected for the district of Newcastle,
which included Port Augusta. In 1890, however, he returned to his old love- - PMst
1 orrens - and sat for that constituency until April 17, 1894, when he accepted the
appointment of Agent-General to the Province in London.
Soon after his entry into Parliament Mr. Playford figured as a liberal land
reformer, and in this branch of legislation his largest and best work has been done. He
o o
actively assisted Mr. Strangways in passing the celebrated Land Bill which gave to
farmers the opportunity ot taking up land on deferred payments. Upon the retirement
of the Hon. \\ . A. E. West-Erskine, in P'ebruary, 1876, he became Commissioner of
Crown Lands in the Boucaut Administration; and then followed a series of Ministerial
responsibilities, of which, for the sake of reference, we give a connected list. Mr. Playford
was Commissioner of Crown Lands in three of Sir James Boucaut’s Administrations
from P'ebruary 2 to March 25, 1876; from March 25 to June 6, 1876; and from
October 26, 1877, to September 27, 1878. He accepted the same portfolio in the
succeeding Government of Sir William Morgan, which remained in power from
September 27, 1878, to March 10, 1881 ; and from March 10 to June 24, 1881. He
was Commissioner of Public Works under Sir John Colton from June 16, 1884, to
February 4, 1885; and Commissioner of Crown Lands from P'ebruary 4 to June 16,
1885. He was Premier and I reasurer from June ir, 1887. to June 27, 1889; and
from August 19, 1890, to January 6. 1892; and Premier and Commissioner of Crown
Lands from January 6. to June 21, 1892. When the Kingston Government assumed
office, on June 16, 1893, he took the portfolio of Treasurer, which he held until his
departure for England, in April, 1894. Altogether the Hon. Thomas Playford held office
Dr 3-556 days nearly 10 years —being the longest period up to May 31. 1900, that any
member of the South Australian Parliament has served as a Minister of the Crown. His
colleagues in the different ministries were—Right Hons. Sir S. J. Way, Bart., and C. C.
Kingston, M.L.C. ; Sir A. Blyth, C.B. ; the Hons. Sir J. C. Bray, Sir J. Colton. Sir }. Coles,
Sir R. C. Baker, Sir J. P. Boucaut, Sir J. A. Cockburn, Alfred Catt, J. H. Gordon,
G. C. Hawker, L. W. Holder, J. G. Jenkins, C. Mann, W. Morgan, J. G. Ramsay, W. B.
Rounsevell, and E. Ward ; and Messrs. M. P. L. Basedow, D. Bews, N. Blyth, W. Copley.
W. Everard, H. Gawler, P. P. Gillen, R. Homburg, J. C. F. Johnson, and T. King.
After the retirement of the Morgan Government, in 1881, Mr. Playford, with
the late Hon. G. C. Hawker, M.P., and His Honor Judge Bundey, had the title of
“Honorable” conferred upon him for life. It is not possible to here give a detailed
account of the many legislative successes of Mr. Playford. They have been as diverse


as they have been generally useful and important, and they have won for him a name
unsurpassed in the Province. In the Parliament of 1887 he was appointed leader of the
Protectionist side of the House, against the Downer-Bray Government, and in this capacitv
successfully led the Opposition in defeating the Administration. As a consequence, he
formed a Government, whose two years’ term of office was exceedingly active. During
that period he piloted a Protective Tariff Bill through the House. Upon the occasion
of the Hon. Dr. Cockburn carrying a motion of want of confidence against him, in fLine,
1889, Mr. Playford s reply was declared to be one of the most masterly ever heard
within the walls of the Chamber. In his second Administration, having taken the Lands
portfolio, he, in January, 1892, visited India, with the view of discovering the coolie labor
that was most adapted to the circumstances of the Northern Territory. Scon after his
return, his Ministry was defeated by Mr. Holder. As Treasurer, Mr. Playford was
responsible for five Budgets, and it is certain that no more successful financier ever had
charge of the department in South Australia. He managed to obtain a surplus on each
occasion, and, in addition, wiped off the old deficit to the extent of ,£300,000. While
Commissioner of Public Works, he introduced to Parliament the Bill providing for the
construction of the railway from Petersburg to Cockburn, which has been the best-paying
line laid down in South Australia.
In historical intercolonial gatherings the Hon. Mr. Playford’s intelligence is well
known. He was one of the first two South Australian delegates to the Eederal Council
of Australasia, and presided over the third session held in Hobart, Tasmania, in Januarv
and February, 1889. With Dr. Cockburn he represented this Province at the Eederal
Conference held in Melbourne in February, 1889, and his speeches on that occasion
attracted considerable attention for their common-sense and vigor. He was also selected
as a delegate to the historical Sydney Convention of 1891, and rendered material service
to the cause of Federation. He was practically the instigator of the memorable Chinese
Conference in Sydney in 1888. On all these occasions his striking personalitv and common-
sense carried considerable weight.
As an administrator, Mr. Playford is businesslike and thorough. His knowledge
of the land laws ot the Province is beyond cavil, and he is recognised as a leading authority
on all questions relating thereto or to water conservation. During his term of office as
Agent-General in London—from April, 189/p to June, 1898 he proved himself one of
the most capable and sensible that had ever represented South Australia. Very substantial
improvements and innovations were made in the system, and the service got to be of
vital value to the Province. Despite the request of the Government that he would remain
longer in the old country, his health caused him to relinquish the duties—a step that was
viewed by the colonists with regret. On his return he again sought parliamentary honors,
and was returned on April 29, 1899, to represent the District of Gumeracha in the House
of Assembly. It is well known that during the jubilee year (1897) the Secretary of State
for the Colonies pressed Mr. Playford to accept a K.C.M.G.-ship, but (compatible with
his rugged independence) he respectfully declined. Mr. Playford’s firmness of character,
strong individuality, and native ability have made him a prominent figure in Australian
political life.

Hon. John Langdon Parsons, M.L.C.
SOI I H AUSIRALIA is possessed of many eloquent speakers, among whom the
Hon. J. E. Parsons is of the chief. A clear reasoner, and with a wide knowledge,
he dresses his subjects in such choice language that he may be termed a purist.
1 here is a charm and vitality about Mr. Parsons as a speaker that have won the applause
of many a large audience.
The Hon. John Langdon
Parsons was born at Botathen,
near Launceston, Cornwall, in
1837, and is the son of Mr.
Edward Parsons. He studied for
the ministry in the Baptist de-
nomination, at Regent’s Park
College. London, and came to
South Australia in 1863. Re-
maining here for but four months,
he proceeded to New Zealand,
and at Dunedin had charge of the
Baptist Church for four years.
At the expiration of that period
he returned to South Australia,
and became pastor of the Angaston
Baptist Church during the absence
of the Rev. J. Hannay. Then,
upon the retirement of the late
Rev. G. Stonehouse, in 1869, he
accepted the pastorate of the North
Adelaide Baptist Church. He re-
mained there until after the erection
of the Tynte Street Church, when
he retired from the ministry, and
went to England and Norway for
the sake of his health. After some months, he resumed his connection with the Province,
and adopted a commercial career.
Because of his marked abilities, it was not likely that Mr. Parsons would long
remain out of public life. He was for some years a useful member of the old Council
of Education, and in that capacity demonstrated a vital interest in educational matters.
In 1878 he was elected to represent Encounter Bay in the House of Assembly, and, as
members of the Council of Education drew fees from the Government, he resigned that
appointment. Parliament supplied an excellent scope for a man of Mr. Parsons’ calibre,


and he soon became an acquisition in debate. In educational subjects he was particularly
active. In 1881 he sought the suffrage of the North Adelaide constituency, and
was elected. In June of that year, when the late Sir John Pray formed his first Ministry,
the portfolio of Minister of Education conjointly with the control of the affairs of the
Northern Territory, was offered to and accepted by Mr. Parsons. P'or about three years
he retained that position, and was able to perform much good work in his department.
As Minister of Education, he was more enlightened and useful than most who have
occupied the office in South Australia. In March, 1884, he retired from the Government,
and was granted the Queen’s permission to bear for life the title of “ Honorable ” within
the Empire. While conducting the affairs of the Northern Territory, he, with other
members of Parliament, visited that portion of the Province, and, says a biographer
of the time, "the result proved highly satisfactory, especially to the inhabitants of the
I erritory, who are likely in the future to be the recipients of many benefits and favors
from the Government, to which they have long been strangers.”
Having learnt a great deal concerning the Northern Territory and the conditions
of life and industries there, the Hon. J. L. Parsons was, in 1884, appointed its Government
Resident and removed to the north coast. He occupied the influential position until 1890,
and meanwhile got a more thorough knowledge of the wants of the residents. In the
latter year he resigned, and was elected one of the first members for the Territory in the
House of Assembly. At the dissolution of Parliament three years later he did not seek
re-election. In 1896 the Hon. J. L. Parsons was appointed Consul for Japan, having in
the previous year visited that country as Hon. Commissioner for the Government of
South Australia to enquire into the prospects of opening up trade relations with Japan, China,
and the Philippine Islands. He revisited Japan in 1898. At the election of delegates
to the Federal Convention in 1897 the Hon. J. L. Parsons was unsuccessful, but he
was returned to the Legislative Council for the Central District in February, 1901.
Mr. Parsons still continues his exertions for the development of the resources of the
Northern Territory. He recognises that a country which touches almost 12 degrees from
the Equator must be legislated for and administered as a tropical country. Sugar, Liberian
coffee, ramie, indiarabber trees, ginger, tapioca, arrowroot, sesam, millets, and all other
tropical and sub-tropical products can be produced with economic success if suitable labor
is permitted. The supply can be obtained from our own Empire, India, under an Act
carried through Parliament by Mr. Parsons in 1882. On terminable engagements a "white
Australia ” can be preserved, and a profitable field for the investment of capital, and the
employment of Europeans as overseers, etc., can be secured.
One of the most scholarly men in South Australia, Mr. Parsons has delivered
numerous lectures, which have been instructive and entertaining as much for their research
as for their eloquence. We conclude by a quotation from Loyau’s " Representative Men
of South Australia” (1883):- —"Mr. Parsons is a logical and straightforward politician, and
whilst having the interests of the constituency he represents thoroughly at heart, he never
appears to forget the duty he owes to the country at large.”

Hon. Alfred Catt, M.P. (Chairman of Committees of the House of Assembly)
AMONG the solid and reliable politicians of South Australia the name of the Hon.
Alfred Catt holds an honored place. During a long series of years Mr. Catt has
represented in the Assembly one of the most important agricultural districts in the
Province : and that he has for so long a period secured the suffrages of the electors of
the wheat-growing district of
Gladstone is in itself a signification
of his worth and of his acquaint-
ance with the wants of the country
population. But Mr. Catt not
only secures the respect and
votes of electors, he has also
obtained the suffrage of the
elected of the people. On June 5,
1890, he was appointed Chairman
of Committees of the House of
Assembly, and he has filled that
position to the credit of the House
and to the credit of himself. His
impartiality, geniality, tact, and
constitutional knowledge, com-
bined with a decision of manner
and firmness of mind when con-
fronted with difficulties of par-
liamentary procedure, peculiarly
qualify him for his difficult position.
Alfred Catt was born at
Newington, near Sittingbourne,
Kent, in 1833. When 16 years of
age he came to South Australia,
and for 10 vears was farminsf at
O
Balha n n ah and Strath al by n, maki no-
J ’ o
a thorough study of agriculture. He soon began to take an interest in the public well-being
of these places; and it was not long before he became a councillor of Strathalbyn, and
later Mayor of that town. Afterwards he became chairman of the Gladstone District
Council ; and his deliberations and actions in consort with these local bodies showed him
to be a man of solid understanding, who was destined to step beyond the rather circumscribed
limits of municipal provincialism. Taking a survey of the then existing land legislation,
he made a thorough study of its potentialities, and it was not surprising that he, in tBBt,
received a requisition from the constituency of Stanley to become a candidate for their


parliamentary suffrages. He was returned to the House of Assembly in company with the
Hon. J. H. Howe, now M.L.C. ; and he sat for Stanley until 1884, when the re-construction
of electorates was brought about. Mr. Catt then stood for Gladstone, which contained a
great portion of his old constituency, and was returned ; and he has continued to represent
that electorate without interruption to the present time, on two occasions being returned
unopposed.
Mr. Catt was but a month in the House when he was given the portfolio
of Minister of Crown Lands in the Bray Government, which held office from June, 1881,
till June, 1884. The conferment of Ministerial office upon him thus early in his political
life was a signal tribute to Mr. Catt s ability; and his administration of the land laws amply
bore out the high opinion his friends had formed of him. During Mr. Catt’s tenure of office
certain land legislation was passed relative to relieving selectors of some of their liabilities to
the State. There was much acrimonious debate and discussion raised at the time as to the
manner in which the Bill was administered by the Commissioner. The chief objection
urged against Mr. Catt was that he allowed surrenders in some cases which did not merit
relief. But he contended and it proved rightly, too- that he had no option save to accept
surrenders in all cases. Mr. Catt again became a member of Government, his political
chief this time being the Hon. T. Playford, in whose Ministry he was Minister of Public
Works from June, 1887, to June, 1889.
The subject of this sketch has always been a powerful advocate for water
conservation and irrigation. Whilst in the Bray Ministry, he introduced the first Bill for
*■ ' J J
water conservation, and carried it through the Assembly practically without opposition. It
was. however, rejected by the Legislative Council. Mr. Catt took a very active part in
securing the passing of the Beetaloo Water Scheme ; and he it was who introduced and
practically carried the Railway Commissioners Bill when Minister of Public Works. Early
in 1887 he was accorded the title “Honorable" by the Queen; and it was three years
later- June, 1890 — that he was elected, without opposition, Chairman of Committees of the
House of Assembly. His predecessors in this office were the late Mr. William Townsend,
Hon. John Carr, Mr. Luke Liddiard burner, and the Hon. Ebenezer Ward.
Ever since his arrival in the Colony, Mr. Catt has taken the greatest interest
in religious matters. For several years he has been Superintendent of the Strathalbvn,
Gladstone, Pirie Street, and Parkside Wesleyan Sunday-schools, and he has held the
position of President of the Sunday-school Union. In all charitable and philanthropic affairs
he has ever shown a sympathetic and kindly spirit. As a man he is conscientious to a
degree, while as a politician he is the embodiment of earnestness and energy, and to these
latter qualities are due many of the wise laws put on our statute books. He has
been an active member of the Volunteer Force, holding the rank of Lieutenant of the
Strathalbyn force, Captain of the Gladstone corps, and Captain of the Reserve Force. He
was President of the Strathalbyn and Gladstone Institutes, both being built during his
» o o
term of office. He was also a member of the Hospital Board for some years, Chairman
of the Murray Water Commission, Chairman of the Barossa Irrigation Commission, and
of other Commissions. He was appointed a J.P. in 1881.

Hon. William Benjamin Rounsevell, M.P
NO class of citizens in South Australia, judging by members in Parliament at different
times, can be said to serve their country more faithfully than the commercial section
At all periods of the Province’s growth, their political activity has been great. I here
are leading commercial men in the City of Adelaide who have in one way or another
sacrificed personal interests for the
public weal. The popular mind is
exceedingly apt to under-estimate
the amount of self-abnegation dis-
played in serving public interests.
The time of a commercial man is.
exceedingly valuable to his
o J
numerous interests, and leading
business men have a strong excuse
for remaining aloof from the arena
of politics because of the tide of
duties that daily waits them at
their office.
William Benjamin Rounsevell
comes within the circle of this
meritorious class. Though
his business connections were
sufficient to absorb his undivided
attention, he yet found time for a
long exercise of political and
Ministerial duties. His services
were appreciated all the more in
consequence of the valuable
private time he voluntarily allowed
to remain unutilised for his nearer
ends. He was born in South
Australia in 1842. His father.
the late William Rounsevell, owned an extensive coaching business, which has long since
been merged into the firm of John Hill & Co., Ltd. Mr. Rounsevell received his education
at Whinham College. On leaving school, the carefulness of his father had provided amply
for his sons’welfare. On the paternal death Mr. Rounsevell and his brother John became
heirs to a large amount of valuable property. The legacy enabled the two brothers to embark
on enterprises of an ambitious nature. Pastoral and commercial undertakings of an extensive
kind were entered into with active enthusiasm, and a successful wine and spirit business was
conducted simultaneously in the city. Various enterprises were boldly attacked by the
energetic firm, and a profitable connection established in many lines and branches of


commercial pursuits. bor a long time the pressure of their growing business, and the
close attention demanded for careful fostering in order to establish it firmly necessitated the
restriction of energy to their private interests. But public life at length moved Mr. W. B.
Rounsevell s efforts. In 1875 he entered Parliament for the Burra, and represented that
Constituency for 15 years, when Port Adelaide became the chosen seat of his political labors.
He acquitted himself most creditably in the Assembly, He was an ardent supporter
of his party, a strong debater, and a capable speaker. There was no lukewarmness
attached to his conduct in the House. When party feeling ran high, and warm discussions
made the political pulse beat faster, he was always at his post in the front rank of
debaters. His ability to hold a ministerial office was recognised, and his past achievements
warranted his promotion to a portfolio. \\ hen Mr. G. S. Fowler resigned his position in
the Morgan Ministry, Mr. Rounsevell was appointed Treasurer in May, 1881. The
administration of this important office was continued by the new Minister till the
1 etirement of the Government in the following June. Ihe period of ministerial activity was
too brief to admit of any material change being introduced in the administration of his
department. It was then his fortune to be seated in the ranks of the Opposition. The
Bray Government was busy in bringing forward measures antagonistic to the ideas of their
opponents, and a stream of hot debate flowed fast. Taxation and Land proposals met
with a storm of solid resistance from the Opposition. Mr. Rounsevell ably supported the
cause of his party, and declaimed with forceful effect. His unwearying efforts to bar
their passage through the House, were welcomingly appreciated by his colleagues. At no
previous time did he figure with such prominence, or render such distinguished services.
The Government was doomed to lose the seals of office. In 1884 Sir John Colton formed
his Administration, and Mr. Rounsevell was appointed to his former portfolio of Treasurer.
Sir John and his Ministry suffered defeat, however, in June of the following year. With
considerable vigor Mr. Rounsevell had set himself the task of reorganising certain portions
of his department and of improving it. But the fickleness of Ministerial fortune stepped
in and snapped the thread of his projected activity. At subsequent periods of parliamentary
history Mr. Rounsevell filled the same Ministerial office in the Playford and Downer
Governments. The experience which he had amassed from previous occupations of the
post enabled him to proceed more definitely and with greater confidence with the responsible
work of administering satisfactorily the numerous affairs of the Treasury Department.
Much approval was shown towards the conduct of his office, and it was admitted by all
unbiassed minds that Mr. Rounsevell’s ability was congenial to this departmental exercise,
and that his administrative efforts were fruitful of manifold success. He retired temporarilv
from public life in 1893. having earned the title of “Honorable” for life. At the general
o
elections of 1899 he was again returned to the House of Assembly, this time for the
district of Burra.
In sporting, and especially coursing matters, great interest has been evinced by
Mr. Rounsevell. He is a keen and true sportsman, and for many years consistently
contributed his patronage and support to the welfare of the higher pastimes. In Glenelg
Council matters his public usefulness was eagerly availed of, and the office of Mayor of
that municipality was held by him for two years. He took an active interest in municipal
affairs during his connection with the Council, and did his utmost to advance the welfare
and prosperity of the town.

Charleston Studios
Hon. David Morley Charleston, M.L.C.
THIS gentleman was one of the earliest members of the Parliamentary Labor Party in
South Australia, which has since become a powerful political organisation ; and even
those whose political views have been in direct and somewhat bitter opposition to
his, admire his ability equally with his tolerance. He was born in Cornwall on May 27,
1848, was educated at the National
Schools, and also received a certain
amount of private tuition. He served
an apprenticeship to engineering in
his native town of Hayle, with a
well-known firm of engineers ; and
in 1870 he became a member of the
Amalgamated Society of Engineers.
Between that year and 1874 he was
associated with labor reform move-
ments in London. In the latter year
he proceeded to San Francisco,
where he entered the service of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company as
a marine engineer. In 1884 he came
to South Australia, and was ap-
pointed Clerk of Works at the
new Hackney Bridge, subsequently
joining the Adelaide Steamship
Company. In 1887 he was engaged
as engineer at the English and
o c?
Australian Copper Company’s works,
and superintended the erection of
their machinery.
In 1887 he began to take an
active part in local labor reform
movements, and in December, 1888.
he was one of the first trades and labor representatives to be gazetted by the Government
a Justice of the Peace. He was largely associated with the settlement of important labor
disputes while occupying the position of Chairman of the Eight Hours Protective Society
and President of the United Trades and Labor Council of South Australia.
In May, 1891, Mr. Charleston was elected by the Central District to the Legislative
Council, and here the clearness, earnestness, and comprehension shown in his speeches, and
the intellectual standard of the man, secured respectful attention and consideration. He has
been the mainstay of the Reform Party in the Upper House, and has also travelled widely


in the Province lecturing on vital questions of political moment. He has been prominently
connected with the Homesteads League and Village Settlement efforts. In 1896, owing
to his refusal to bind himself to the platform of the Parliamentary Labor Party, he seceded
from that body, and went before the electors on an independent ticket. His return
illustrated the confidence that he had won from his constituents independent of the demands
ot his old political organisation. Mr. Charleston is a respected member of the Upper House,
and an ornament of the Reform Party.
Hon. J. V. O’Loghlin, M.L.C.
GU ME RAC HA was the birthplace of Mr. J. V. O’Loghlin in 1852, his father being
an old pioneer settler of the Province. On leaving school Mr. O’Loghlin engaged
in farming and grazing pursuits for some time. Abandoning after a while the
atmosphere of rustic life, he passed the next seven years with the South Australian
Carrying Company, Limited, which at that time had the sole control of the t-oods traffic
o
on the Government Railways, when he was appointed manager of the firm’s Gawler
branch, one of the most important outside of the capital at that time. A change in the
policy of the Government with regard to the goods traffic necessitated Mr. O’Loghlin
seeking a fresh field of labor, which he found with the firm of W. Duffield & Co. as
wheatbuyer ; and when this house amalgamated with the Adelaide Milling Company, his
services were retained, and at the time of his election to Parliament, he was manager of
the Company’s mills at Gladstone.
It was whilst engaged in the wheat trade that Mr. O’Loghlin turned his attention
to journalism. The Terowie Enterprise was his first venture, whilst at a later period he
became editor and managing director of the Southern Cross.
In May, 1888, he was returned to the Upper House for the Northern District,
which district he has represented ever since. He has closely identified himself with manv
promotive movements, and on the retirement of the Hon. J. H. Gordon from the Kingston
Government on February 15, 1896, Mr. O’Loghlin was a few weeks later chosen to fill
the post of Chief Secretary, with the leadership of the Legislative Council. He remained
in office till the fall of the Ministry on December 1, 1899.
Mr. O’Loghlin is an “Honorable” for life, Vice-president of the Irish National
P'ederation, a member of the Australian Natives’ Association, a trustee of the Savings
O
Bank, and a captain in the Defence P'orce. He has served on several important Royal
Commissions and Parliamentary Committees, notably the Barossa Water Commission, Blvth
to Gladstone Railway, Queensland Border Railway, and Hospital Select Committees, and the
Select Committee on Free Conferences between the two Houses. He was elected a member
of the Gladstone Corporation in 1880. In Parliament he has proved himself an effective
debater and a man of advanced Liberal views.

Hon. John James Duncan, M.L.C.
IN bestowing the praise due to the pioneers who built up this Province, the names of
their sons should also be held in remembrance. These successors have also
supplied their share of the bone and sinew of the country. Such an one is the Hon-
John James Duncan, a noted pastoralist of the Province. He was born at Anstruther,
P'ifeshire, Scotland, in 1845, and
is the eldest son of the late
Captain Duncan, who, with his
family, came to South Australia
in 1854. Captain Duncan became
associated with Mr. (afterwards
Sir) Walter Watson Hughes (his
brother-in-law) in pastoral pursuits,
and together these gentlemen
acquired a sheep station which em-
braced what is now the Wallaroo
and Moonta copper-mining dis-
tricts. Both Mr. J. J. Duncan
and his brother. Mr. Walter
Hughes Duncan, M.P., spent some
of their early years on this station,
j. J. Duncan was educated first
privately, then at St. Peter’s
College, at Bentley, near Gawler,
and at the Watervale Grammar
School. Before he attended a
public school, and while resident
at Wallaroo, the copper discoveries
were made in that district: and he
it was who conveyed the news of
the discovery to his uncle, Sir
J ’
W. W. Hughes, who then resided
at “ The Peak,” near Watervale.
He also drove the first four miners, who had been engaged at the Burra, to the site of
the Wallaroo Mine. When Moonta was discovered, he also drove the first workmen to
that mine.
Alter leaving school, Mr. Duncan had the advantage of three years’ training in
the mercantile office of Messrs. Elder, Smith, & Co. He afterwards became attached to the
smelting works and then to the mines at Wallaroo, charged with the financial administration.
Subsequently he was given charge of some of the station properties of his uncle, and, on
the death of the latter, succeeded him as the owner of the properties known as Gum
Creek, near the Burra, and Hughes Park, near Watervale, It may be mentioned that


Mr. D uncan in the “seventies” had an experience of a unique and alarming character
during a trip to inspect country in the interior. Caught at the Macumba Creek in heavy
floods which surrounded them, he and his two companions, the late Mr. Treloar and his
son, Mr. A. Treloar, were compelled to take refuge in a tree. They were forced to
remain, almost destitute of food, in its branches for four days and four nights before the
J o
water fell sufficiently to enable them to reach dry land. Hughes Park, Mr. Duncan's
J J o
country home, is situated among the hills to the west of Watervale ; and a fine site has
been improved by building and planting. As a sheep-breeder, Mr. Duncan is well known,
the wool from his flocks being among the finest produced in South Australia.
Mr. Dun can early became identified with public matters. He first entered
Parliament when 26 years of age, in 1871, for Port Adelaide, which was in those days
a huge electorate embracing Yorke Peninsula. before the next general election a
redistribution of seats had taken place, and in 1875 Mr. Duncan was returned for the
Wallaroo division of his former district. After six years in Parliament he withdrew from
public life in order to visit the old country ; and when on the Continent in 1878 he
acted as a Commissioner for South Australia at the Paris Exhibition. On returning to
South Australia, he was elected to the Assembly in 1884 tor Wooroora, his home
constituency, which he represented until 1890. In the following year he was elected to
the Upper House as a member for the North-Eastern District, and retained this seat
until 1896, when he retired to again visit the old country, having thus served in
Parliament for 18 years. fie is now once more a member of the Legislative Council,
having been again returned without opposition in 1900 for the same district.
Mr. Duncan believes in absolute freedom as a member of Parliament, and has
never accepted office, although offers of portfolios have been made to him by at least three
Premiers. During the existence of the Neutral Party in the Assembly, Mr. Duncan was
OJ J ’
its chairman, a position in strict consonance with his refusal to ally himself with any
Government, fie has always carefully guarded the interests of those whom he represented,
and on pastoral and agricultural subjects in particular his utterances have ever been of
intelligent interest. Mr. Duncan has been associated with several Royal Commissions;
amongst others the Railway Commission in 1885, and the Defence Select Committee in
1887.
He was a trustee of the Savings Bank for several years ; also a Director of the
<> j
Wallaroo Mining and Smelting Company. Mr. Duncan held the rank of Captain of the
Watervale Rifle Company of Volunteers, and served as Councillor in the Upper Wakefield
District Council as chairman for a time. He was associated with the formation of the
National Defence League, now incorporated with the Australasian National League, and
had the honor of being appointed to the presidency of that body.
Mr. Duncan has done more for South Australia than most men. His work has
been enduring, and his principles unquestioned. He takes rank as a representative man in
the public and private spheres of life, and his name is held in genuine esteem.

Hon, John Lewis, M.L.C.
JUDGING from those who survive, the men who excelled in forcing a path through
the monotonous labyrinths of the Australian bush, thirty, forty, and hfty years ago,
possessed gifts and characteristics which fitted them to forge their way in the important
grades of industrial pursuits. The sturdy qualities which a man must possess who voluntarily
shuts himself out from the world
and settles down to life work on
lonely, untrodden expanses, could
be applied as successfully in other
fields. It was only the fearless, the
strong - minded and able - bodied,
who could hope to succeed in the
pioneering work of opening up a
new country.
Among this sturdy class in
South Australia is Mr. John
Lewis, a somewhat recent addition
to the members of the Legisla-
tive Council of the Province.
He was born at Brighton (S.A.),
in 1842, and is the son of one of
the earliest pioneers ol South
Australia, the late Mr. James
Lewis. After leaving school,
young Lewis worked with his
father at Richmond harm, near
Adelaide, whence he proceeded
into the back countrv and was
J
engaged in various pursuits con-
nected with the occupation of the
land. At that period much
northern country now settled was
untrodden ; but a sturdy band of squatters was constantly pushing' further back into
unknown territory. Mr. Lewis performed a share in this developmental work, and in
1871 he struck out on a yet bolder task than he had previously essayed.
A few travellers had followed Stuart after his journey overland from the southern to
the northern coast, and the Government was engaged in constructing the Overland I elegraph
line. But next to nothing was known of the interior vastness, and very tew private parties
had been courageous enough to explore it. Warburton, borrest, and Giles had not yet


trodden the immense silent deserts between South Australia and the western coast
of the Continent. Mr. Lewis procured horses and began the formidable task of traversing
the desolate interior in order to reach the Northern Territory. While en route . the
Government commissioned him to act as estafette between the constructing parties of the
continental telegraph line, and lor three months he carried the telegrams from Tennant’s
Creek to Daly Waters and vice versa. Over the route he had chosen were long stretches
of arid country ; but Mr. Lewis was fortunate in having a favorable season for his trip.
He eventually reached settlement in the Northern Territory, and this success brought
him great kudos. He remained on the northern coast for about five vears, engaged in
mining, exploring, and in various other businesses. Substantially the Northern Territory
had to be opened up, and several enterprising individuals joined with Mr. Lewis in this
large undertaking. The country was fairly populated with aborigines, who in certain
localities were untrustworthy and even dangerous. Several of the explorers were attacked
by them, but Mr. Lewis experienced little trouble at their hands. In 1873 he was sent
as leader of a relief party to search for the African explorers, Borrowdale and Berman,
who were lost between Port Darwin and Port Essington. Mr. Lewis is the only man
who has travelled overland from Melbourne to Vashon Head, Coburg Peninsula, going
from extreme south to extreme north of the Australian Continent.
After many interesting and entertaining experiences in the far north, he
returned to Adelaide in 1876, when he devoted himself to commercial pursuits. He
joined Mr. W. Liston and Mr. J. Shakes in the stock and station business; and, having
opened a branch at Kooringa, most of his subsequent career has been spent in the northern
districts in supervising the operations of the firm in that part. The enterprise became
extensive, and many notable stock sales have been conducted by the firm, especially at
the Burra. Recognised as one of the best judges of stock in the Province, Mr. Lewis
is a successful salesman; and he is credited with having conducted one of the largest
stock sales ever held in Australia, disposing of 47,000 sheep and 1,200 head of cattle in
one market. A few years ago the firm was amalgamated with G. W. Bagot, and incorporated
under the name of Bagot, Shakes, & Lewis, Ltd., and it now' conducts one of the largest
stock and station agency businesses in South Australia, Mr. Lewis being one of the
managing directors. He is largely interested in station properties, and frequently officiates
at agricultural shows as judge of horses, cattle, and sheep.
Mr. Lewis has had three years' experience in municipal matters; and he was
chairman of the Burra branch of the Agricultural Bureau for many years. He is a devoted
florist, and noted for his encouragement of the growth of chrysanthemums. He was
President of the South Australian Horticultural and Floricultural Society for 1899. Being
fond of outdoor sports, he, as a young man, was often found riding in steeplechases and
following the hounds, and later was an enthusiastic polo-player, having been for 12 years
President of the Burra Burra Polo Club, only resigning that position in 1899.
In June, 1898, he was elected by the North-Eastern District as a member of
the Legislative Council, of which body he is still a member.

Hon. Andrew Tennant, M.L.C
OP' the men who made Australia, the pastoral settlers in the lonely and forbidding
wilderness are not the least. These men have entered the theatre of hardship
with a smiling face, and voluntarily accepted a living burial of months and years
duration. Though the pioneer of Africa had to fight wild beasts and wild men, the
pioneer interior pastoralist of Aus-
tralia had to face more dispiriting
enemies. There is some excite-
ment in a battle with large game ;
there is nothing inspiriting in an
encounter with droughts, in melan-
choly scenery and awful silence.
J ’J
But the squatters in the interior
deserts of South Australia have
always shown the courage and
persistency of truly brave men. A
glance at the map of the Province
conveys an impression of distance;
a perusal of the works of explorers
in these wilds tells of dread deso-
lation and every kind ot dis-
couragement. And yet men of
O j
the good old home stock have
been found willing to face the
dangers and difficulties of the
O
remote “bush”; and among such
in South Australia have been
members of the Tennant family.
Mr. Andrew Tennant was born
in Dumfriesshire in 1835. His
father, Mr. John Tennant, was one
of the earliest pioneers of the
Province of South Australia, arriving here in 1838, when Andrew was but three years
old. Immediately upon his arrival, Mr. John Tennant began pastoral pursuits at Dry
Creek, near Adelaide. In those days the pastoralist desiring wealth depended chiefly on
the natural increase of his flocks. To purchase stock cost a modest fortune ; and to sell
sheep was at times equally difficult. So the pastoralist had to carefully nurture his small
flock not even killing an animal for food ; while the blackfellow, whenever he could,
wantonly speared the stock, and thus often ruined the struggling owner. Mr. John
Tennant, however, gradually extended his operations, selecting station properties at the


Chain of Ponds and at Lyndoch Valley, in the Gumeracha district, and afterwards at the
Burra, which latter district was becoming famous by reason of the rich copper mines it
contained. With all the hardihood of the pathfinder, and the irrepressible spirit of the
pioneer, Mr. John Tennant decided to establish a station at Port Lincoln, on the western
side ot Spencer Gulf. To get sheep overland to this locality a tedious and dangerous
journey north of Gulfs St. Vincent and Spencer was necessary, through unsettled and
largely desolate country. Pew pastoralists had been bold enough to essay so serious an
undertaking, and those few met with many disasters. Nothing daunted, however, Mr.
John Tennant set out on his dreary undertaking with his cattle and sheep. Starting in
the winter, the party got as far as the present location of Ouorn, when they were attacked
by a tribe of aboriginals. Two of the party were murdered, and numbers of the sheep
were driven off and idly killed by the blacks. So serious was the depredation, that
Mr. T ennant turned back to recoup his forces. In the following winter, however, he set
out again on his intended expedition, and this time he was fortunate enough to reach his
destination at Port Lincoln. The first man to get safely across to this place with stock,
he passed on his way hostages to the desert Sphinx, or victims to the vengeance of the
black men. Mr. Tennant, sen., purchased the Tallala Station, 15 miles from Port Lincoln,
from Mr. White, of White Park, and there he ran cattle and sheep for many years.
Being but an infant when he reached the Province, Andrew Tennant imbibed the
adventurous spirit of the pioneers, and grew up in the peculiar conditions of the real
Australian bush. Even as a boy he was prepared to go forth into the wilds and fight the
rover’s battle. To the youth of the “forties" there was a delightful attraction in being
able to visit unexplored territory, unknown to civilised races since the creation. Andrew
was educated at Mr. Wicks’ school in North Adelaide, the Principal of which afterwards
became Inspector of Schools under the Government. When 18 years old, young J ennant
took cattle and sheep, and pushed farther west than the Port Lincoln environs. Near the
shores of Lake Newland, close to Port Elliston, he took possession of a locality abandoned
by Mr. Pinkerton, who was forced back to civilised parts by the raids of blacks. Both
men and stock had been killed by them at this place ; but young I ennant was not afraid
of the aboriginals, and for seven years he kept them in subjection while managing his
sheep and cattle station. After this period, he owned stations successively at Mount \\ edge,
Coffin Bay, and Streaky Bay (Pavaba).
In 1866 Mr. Andrew Tennant leased a large block of. country, known as
Baroota, at Port Germein ; but, as is so often necessary in the remote areas of South
Australia, where the rainfall is scanty and uncertain, and droughts are fierce, he soon
moved thence to other pastures. On this occasion he went farther into the North
country, and took over the Orrama and Barratta Runs from Sir I homas Elder, which
had been depopulated by the drought of 1865-6. He remained there for a year or two, and
then sold these properties to Mr. A. McCulloch. Next he purchased the \\ illipa hastate,
in the same neighborhood ; following this up with the acquisition of Moolooloo (800 square
miles). Uldulya (5.000 square miles), and Murapatina, near the copper district of Manna
(1.500 square miles). The Uldulya Station was situated in the interior, at Alice Springs,
and included in its area the central telegraph station. Mr. Tennant kept about 11,000


head of cattle on this large area of country. After ten years of varied fortune, Mr. Pennant
relinquished this run, also another which he had taken up at Lake Eyre. More recently
he established the Yardea Station (450 square miles), towards the Western Australian
border. At present he owns Willipa, Moolooloo, and Yardea, which have an aggregate
area of 1,430 square miles; besides a large tract at Middle Back, Port Augusta West.
He possesses also considerable freehold property in the city and suburbs of Adelaide,
and 13,000 acres on the Wakefield River, six miles from Riverton. He holds other large
commercial interests ; and has been a Director of the Adelaide Steamship Company since
its formation. He is also a Director of the China Traders Company. He has been a
lustice of the Peace for a long period, and has been for many years a Mason under the
Grand Constitution.
From 1881 to 1887 he was a member of the House of Assembly for the blinders
District, which includes Port Augusta, Port Lincoln, and the country down to Orroroo.
Mr. Tennant was a member of the Pastoral Commission which sat during 1897-8, and the
result of his hard-won experience was of great service to the Board in their deliberations
as to the best means for furthering the pastoral industry in South Australia. In November,
1898, he was elected by a substantial majority as a representative of the Northern District
in the Legislative Council.
The late Dr. Allan Campbell
A SPLENDID colonist, an able legislator, and a noble philanthropist was lost to South
Australia when Dr. Allan Campbell died on October 30, 1898. It is not too much
to say that the news of his death spread a painful sensation throughout the whole
community, for his was one of the most honored names in the Province. Throughout his
career in South Australia, his life was one of unsparing activity, devoted in the main to
the public weal.
Allan Campbell was born in the Barony Parish of Glasgow in 1836, and his
early youth was passed at Cathcart, a village about four miles south of that city. His
elementary education was imparted in the parish school ol his birthplace, and in the closing
years of his education he devoted himself to the higher branches of study, especially
mathematics and physical science. His first aim was to qualify himself for the architectural
profession ; but, his health failing, he abandoned this pursuit. Some years afterwards he
applied himself vigorously to the study of medicine; and in 1867 he became, a Licentiate
of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, also of the Laculty of Physicians and
Surgeons, Glasgow. His first medical appointment was at a London hospital ; but to
escape the rigors of a cold climate he decided to emigrate to the colonies. Having relations
in South Australia, he came to this Province in 1869, and at once entered into the
practice of his profession, in conjunction with Dr. H. Wheeler, then a well-known member
of the local medical fraternity. Dr. Campbell remained in active practice right up to the
day of his death.
Early in his residence here he became identified with the Society of Arts, and
remained an active supporter of that institution for over 25 years. He early interested
366
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Hon. A, Tennant


himself in the cause of education, and for a long while held a seat on the old Board of
Education. Under the Act of 1875 he became a member of the Education Council, and
tor some time acted as chairman. Dr. Campbell earnestly believed, with the Latinist of
old, that “ the welfare of the people is the first great law,” and in the matter of the public
health he labored long and zealously. As a member of the Central Board of Health he
did valuable work, and also on the University Council.
Dr. Campbell entered Parliament in 1878, when he was returned to the Legislative
Council, retaining his seat there for 20 years —up to the day of his demise. From first to last
he thoroughly discharged his duties, championing every good cause with an enthusiasm,
straightforwardness, and trustworthiness which won him an honored name. He proved
himself learned in constitutional matters, and scarcely any man had more influence on the
passing of the laws of the last 20 years than Dr. Campbell ; this, too, in face of the fact that he
never held office in any Government, save for a few days as a member of the Cockburn
Administration without office. The deceased doctor was an ardent Federalist, and a prominent
supporter of South Australian industries.
Dr. Campbell served on a large number of Royal Commissions and Select
Committees. The crowning work of his political life was his strong advocacy of the Public
Health Bill, and this he regarded as one of the most important measures that has ever
come before Parliament. He was in politics a Freetrader, a Liberal, and a Democrat,
and admirably fulfilled his political pledges.
But it is in the work of philanthropy that Dr. Campbell’s name will ever be
kindly ay, fondly- associated. But two days before he died he put the coping-stone
to a noble object by opening the Convalescent Home for Children at Mount Lofty.
1 here was something dramatically pathetic in this incident, for no sooner had he returned
home from the opening ceremony than he was seized with the illness which so speedily
proved fatal. It is consoling to know he was spared to see one more good object of his
initiation satisfactorily accomplished. Dr. Campbell was one of the original four who
founded the Children’s Hospital ; and the great success of that institution has been mainly
due to his indefatigable exertion on its behalf. The “Allan Campbell” Building is an
extensive addition to a really noble pile of buildings, which was solely due to the doctor’s
initiative. The Bacteriological Institute, also founded by him in connection with this
o ’ J
hospital, has proved itself of much benefit and value in the treatment of diphtheria and
kindred ailments.
Dr. Campbell w r as President of the Homestead League, and also exerted his
influence in the House in support of the Working Men’s Block Movement. He originated
the charitable organisation known as the District d rained Nursing Society, whose object
is to render assistance to the sick poor in their respective homes. Other offices which
he held were in connection with the St. John Ambulance Society ; the Sunday-school
Union, of which for three years he was President : the Caledonian Society, of which he
was twice Chief; and the South Australian Literary Societies’ Union, of which he was
a Past-president; and for a time trustee of the Savings Bank ; a member of, and one time
chairman of, the Board of Governors of the Public Library, Art Gallery, and Museum.


Hon. John Lancelot Stirling, 8.A., LL.B., M.L.C.
THE subject of this notice, second son of the late Mr. E. Stirling, was born at Strathalbyn
in 1849. He received his preliminary education at St. Peters College, Adelaide, and
then, after two years spent on the Continent, he proceeded to England, where he
entered at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1871 he took the degrees of B.A. and EL.B.
He also distinguished himself as an athlete. He won the Oxford and Cambridge Hurdle
Race in record time, and held the amateur championship of England for hurdle
racing in 1870 and in 1871. Leaving the University Mr. Stirling studied for the Bar, and
in 1872 was called to the Inner Temple. Contrary to expectation, he did not. however, devote
himself to the law ; the free, active arena in which he was cradled was more attractive to
him. He returned to South Australia in 1876, and entered into pastoral pursuits. Besides
holding a considerable area of country in South Australia and New South Wales, he is one of
the prominent pastoralists of the Province, and has been President of the Pastoralists
Association of South Australia and West Darling since its formation, besides representing this
association at the federal conferences held in the various colonies. He is largely interested in
a number of Adelaide financial institutions, is a Director of John Hill & Co., of the Wallaroo
and Moonta Mining Company, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the Mortgage
Company of S. A., and of the South Australian Company. He is an ex-President and a
Committeeman of the Royal Agricultural Society. He has been for some years Chairman
of the Strathalbyn District Council.
As befitted one of his attainments and position, the Hon. J. E. Stirling has
become a politician of reputation and experience. Eor many years he has been recognised
as a reliable legislator who possesses a clear insight and a ready gift of speech. He was
elected for Mount Barker to the Legislative Assembly in 1881, and was returned at the
head of the poll in 1884. He was defeated in 1887 by Dr. Cockburn ; but in May.
1888, at a bye-election caused by the death of Sir R. D. Ross, he was elected for the
district of Gumeracha. He retired from the Lower House in 1890, but in the same year
became a member of the Legislative Council for the Southern District, which he continues
to represent. The Hon. J. L. Stirling is not afraid of expressing his political convictions,
no matter whether they be against the popular cry. He has very substantially influenced
legislation, and has sponsored several useful measures. He has naturally taken much interest
in the pastoral legislation of South Australia, and his experience has enabled him to urge
on Parliament for many years the necessity of liberal measures in order to preserve vitality
in this important industry. He acted on the Royal Commission on pastoral matters on
whose report the Bill of 1898 was founded. He is a member of committee and also steward
in the South Australian Jockey Club, as well as associated with several other racing clubs.
He is an ex-Master of the Hunt Club, acted as Hon. Judge for the South Australian
Coursing Club, and was the founder, and for years the captain, of the Adelaide Polo
Club, playing for South Australia in most of the intercolonial and other matches.
The opinions of the Hon. J. L. Stirling carry great weight in the community.
His solid views, his social position, and his talents constitute him one of our most influential
residents.

The late Mr. Samuel Tomkinson
THE late Mr. Samuel Tomkinson was for many years, and up to the time of his
death, one of the best-known figures in Adelaide. During a long public career he
pursued his own way, and followed a policy suggested by his principles —altogether
independent of popularity. He was born in Wales, and educated privately. At the early
age of 12 years he was apprenticed
in the office of a West Indian
merchant in Liverpool, and after
fulfilling his time he went in for
banking, which profession he followed
from 1836 to 1850. In the latter
year he received the appointment of
Manager of the Bank of Australasia
in Adelaide. Arriving in South
Australia in September, 1850. he
at once took up his duties, and for
28 years he continued to manage the
Adelaide branch of the bank. This
period was one of much moment, and
those years in the “ fifties ” saw
J
Adelaide and South Australia
generally pass through many im-
portant changes. Mr. Tomkinson
now became identified with public
and semi-public affairs in the
Province, and eventually found his
way into the more stormv arena of
J *
politics. It is little wonder that he
did, for in England he had taken a
leading part in the great Corn Law
agitation, and marched in association
under the banner of the illustrious
John Bright and the noted R chard
Cobden. He opened his public career in the Province by becoming a member of the
Royal Commission which, in 1853, was appointed to enquire into the system of State
accounts, of which body he was appointed chairman. Other Commissions upon which
Mr. Tomkinson sat subsequently were respectively appointed to investigate and report
upon the Education Board, the liquor laws, and the Police Department. He was twice
Chairman of the South Australian Chamber of Commerce.
In order to ascertain the real character of the rush to the Victorian goldfields


which threatened to seriously deplete South Australia of her population in 1851-2, Mr.
Tomkinson, accompanied by Messrs. Dutton and Neville Bagot, rode overland to \ ictoria
and inspected the goldfields of Ballarat, Bendigo, Maryborough, and Mount Alexander in
turn.
Returning to Adelaide. Mr. Tomkinson found the various banking institutions in
the city in a highly critical state. The Governor, Sir Henry Young, had been prevailed
upon to introduce what was known as the Bullion Act in the emergency of the run which
had taken place on the banks, and which departing colonists to Victoria had caused. I his
measure was passed in one day ; and by its provisions Victorian gold was made a legal
tender at the rate of 11s. an ounce. Mr. Tomkinson opposed the Bullion Bill on the
ground that it was contrary to the currency laws of the British Empire and repugnant to
Imperial legislation. It was in this critical time for the Province that Mr. 1 omkinson s
strong individuality was conspicuously manifested ; and although he was unsuccessful in
his endeavors, he held unswervingly to his opinions.
Relinquishing his management of the; Bank of Australasia in 1879, Mr. I omkinson
entered politics in 1881 as a member for Gumeracha in the Assembly. In 1885 he
decided to stand for the Upper House, and was returned as a representative for the Southern
District, which he served for ten years. In May, 1897, he was elected a member for the
Central District in the Legislative Council.
Mr. Tomkinson was created a j.P. in 1858, and was Chairman of the Adelaide
Licensing Bench. He was also long identified with the municipal growth of Adelaide as
an Alderman of the city; holding that position for 12 years, he infused an amount of
dignity into the deliberative functions of the civic body that should distinguish every person
who holds the suffrage of the ratepayers of an important city.
He was one of the founders of the South Australian Gas Company, and
sat for 20 years on the directorial Board of that corporation. For many years he was
deputy-chairman of the well-known Burra Burra Mine. He was the oldest member of the
Church of England Synod, to which he was appointed by the late Bishop Short. His
long and active life came to an end in August, [899.
It is somewhat difficult to estimate the worth to the community of such a man
as Mr. Tomkinson. He never sought for office under any Government, contenting
<» * 0
himself with being independent of all parties. His powerful will bowed only to the
dictates of his principles, and refused to give way to the cries of those people whom he
thought were going too fast. He was therefore by no means a faddist in politics so far
as giving any support to what he would call “experimental legislation.” There is no
doubt that he sometimes acted as a strong influence in helping to keep in hand the
restive elements of a virile democracy, which, while attractive might lead to disaster.
So solid were Mr. Tomkinson’s opinions that he was never afraid to stand alone in
the arena. A firm resolve, a conscientious opinion, and an earnest desire to help, are
qualities eminently to be admired.

Solomon, t*hoto.
Hon. John Warren, M.L.C.
THOUGH colonial Parliaments may not reflect that amount of honor and dignity
which by its universal and national importance and tradition is attached to the
British Houses of Lords and Commons, there is yet something of loftiness, position,
and responsibility about a membership in these provincial Legislatures of the Empire. It
is at times declared by certain
classes of colonists that to be
a member of Parliament is to
hold a doubtful connection and is
no honor. It is not creditable to
their intelligence, and especially to
their patriotism, that they should
announce such views; for while
some of those who represent the
suffrage of the people may not be
of the best, or be gifted with
stateliness of intelligence, nothing
should deter the man with suitable
gifts from placing his services at
the disposal of his country to
provide for the welfare of his
contemporaries and of his de-
scendants. There is a deal of
work for good men to do, and
o
they should be ready to do it.
J J
It is gratifying to observe in
o o
both Houses of the South Aus-
tralian Legislature men who repre-
sent the best intelligence of the
community. Of such the Hon.
John Warren is an example. Mr.
Warren was born at Elgin,
Scotland, m 1830, and in 1842 came to South Australia in the louci , his father having
preceded him. Mr. Warren, senior, first established a brewery on the Torrens, and continued
at this business for two years, when he sold it to Messrs. Auld & Shand. He then purchased
an estate at Springfield, near Mount Crawford, and there the son, the subject of this notice,
has since resided. The virgin land was systematically developed, and upon it has been
erected a charming residence. In improving it, and in performing the duties of a useful
country squire, the main portion of Mr. Warren’s life has been spent. Remote from
curious eyes, in rural quietude, he has toiled long and toiled fruitfully. He has unobtrusively


striven to do his duty to himself and to his neighbors. At a more recent date, Mr.
J o
Warren, in partnership with Mr. Thomas Hogarth, selected an extensive run at Strangways
Springs, in the interior. Mr. Hogarth died about twelve months ago, and Mr. Warren,
with Mr. Hogarth’s sons, now has control of the property. For many years Mr. Warren
was Chairman of the Mount Crawford District Council, and during that period performed
excellent service for the district. He was for several years Captain of the \\ illiamstown
Company of Volunteers, and is a prominent member of the Anglican Church in his own
district.
His political career began in 1888. Four years before (in 1884) he was nominated
for election to the House of Assembly for the District of Barossa, but was defeated. In
May, 1888, however, he was returned for the North-Eastern District to the Legislative
Council ; and so satisfied were his constituents with the manner in which he performed
his duties, that at the election in May, 1897, he was returned at the head of the poll.
Mr. Wt irren has upon occasion taken a prominent part in legislative debates, and has
delivered sturdy speeches on land matters, his professed aim being the enactment of just
laws for the producers, the most important class in the Province, for in them the welfare
of the whole community is completely bound up. If the agricultural and pastoral industries
be depressed, South Australia has very weak and tottering bases to fall back on. This
fact the Hon. Mr. Warren seems to fully recognise, and, as a consequence, he seeks to
encourage production to the utmost of the resources of the Province. Although his views
may not meet with the approval of the majority, they are yet the outcome of his observations,
and, as that, should command the greatest weight.
Hon. A. R. Addison, M.LC.
ARIHUR RICHMAN ADDISON was born in Adelaide in 1843, and is a son
of Mr. T. P. Addison, at one time Deputy Collector of Customs. He was educated
at St. Peter's College, after leaving which he entered the service of Younghusband
and Co., merchants, then that of the National Bank, and subsequently the Bank of
South Australia, being appointed to the branch at Port Elliot, then a flourishing trade
centre. Joining Mr. W. Bowman in his milling business at Port Elliot. Mr. Addison
became not only a business man of some standing in the district, but also a useful public
man. He entered the local municipal council, of which he filled the office of chairman.
From Port Elliot the Hon. A. R. Addison removed to Orroroo, where, in partnership with
Mr. Pruslove, he established a substantial milling business. With this concern he has
since been identified. Flarly in his residence in the North, Mr. Addison associated himself
with the Orroroo Volunteer Force, of which he became Captain. He also prominently
interested himself with good effect in all matters relating to the welfare of the district. His
straightforwardness and shrewdness made him respected throughout the countryside, and
when, in 1889, he offered himself to the electors of the Northern District in the Lecfislative
O
Council, he was duly elected. He is a Liberal in politics, and upon the retirement in 1896
of the Hon. J. H. Gordon from the Kingston Cabinet, he was offered, but declined, the
portfolio of Chief Secretary.

Hon. Charles Willcox, M.L.C.
MANY features of the career of this successful colonist are known to South Australians.
Appreciated as these points are for the underlying principles they reflect, they
would be much more generally recognised in the light of Mr. Willcox’s whole course
o y o o
of actions since first he set foot on the shores of the Province. P'or long he toiled in different
rustic spheres far from the hub of
city life, with his eye on progress
and his heart fastened to his work.
He had the grit and endurance of
a true colonist.
In the parish of Borough-
bridge, Somersetshire, situated on
the Parreth, a tributary of the
majestic Severn, Mr. \\ illcox was
born in 1845, and was educated
at a private school in the neigh-
borhood. At the age of 18 he
<7
sailed for South Australia, where
he arrived in the course of the
year 1863. The advice given to
those about to emigrate—“ that
they should fit themselves for any
sort of employment” though per-
haps unwelcome, nevertheless had
to be followed in most cases. Mr.
Willcox was young, strong, and
J o o
full of pluck and vigor. Into the
bush he plunged, for he could not
afford a choice of avocation. After
18 months in the South-East, he
came to the capital. Like many
more who can divine the secret
keys and springs of success, he thought a city presented greater facilities for those who had the
capabilities of taking advantage of their knowledge. In Adelaide he engaged with the firm ot
Goode Brothers, wholesale merchants, and remained in their employ tor a space of three years.
He then decided to take a trip to the old country. In 1867, therefore, lie was back once
more in England : but the restless spirit of colonial activity did not suffer him to remain
longer than twelve months in the homeland. On his return to Adelaide with some capital
o
he purchased a few blocks of land in North Adelaide, and on these he built several houses.
At this time the agricultural industry of the Province was developing with considerable
rapidity, and in 1873 Mr. Willcox, in company with Mr. W. Gilbert, M.P., developed the


business of Gilbert, Willcox, & Co., hay and corn merchants. For ten years the two
partners shared the profits of this business, but in 1883 Mr. Willcox bought Mr. Gilberts
interests and became sole proprietor. He then took another holiday trip home. Prosperity
attended his subsequent efforts in South Australia, and in 1886 he purchased the I ayneham
and Paradise Tramway Company, in conjunction with the late Hon. W. Everard. I his
investment proved remunerative; and at the end of three years Mr. Everard s interest
was bought by Mr. Willcox. Following up his speculative ventures, Mr. Willcox purchased,
in 1896, the Goodwood and Clarence Park Tramway Company. Ihe large coaching and
livery establishment of John Hill & Co. next attracted Mr. \\ illcox’s attention, and to-day
he is the largest shareholder in that lucrative business, and sits on the directorate as
chairman, having held that position for the last ten years.
Mr. Willcox has for a considerable period identified himself with municipal and
public affairs, and evinced a keen interest in all that affects the welfare of the capital. In
1884 he stood for Robe Ward in the City Council, and was returned. From that time
he sat for many years in the Council, successively passing through the grades of
Councillor and Alderman, until in 1892 his usefulness and devotion to the affairs of the
city were rewarded by his election as Mayor, an office he again held in the following
year. He conducted his administration with dignity and tact, and the city enjoyed a
period of beneficial and wholesome legislation under his mayoralty.
Politics possessed some interest for Mr. Willcox, and in 1896 he was returned as
one of the representatives of the North-Eastern District for the Legislative Council by
one of the largest majorities ever obtained In the electorate. Mr. Willcox had sought
to enter the political arena before, but by an unfortunate technicality his election had been
declared invalid. He had sought the suffrages of the electors of Gumeracha, had successfully
conducted his campaign, and the poll declared in his favor. But it was objected that he
was a Government contractor : and rather than legally fight over this incapacitating
circumstance, he yielded to the wishes of certain political friends and resigned. Since his
advent to the Upper House he has proved himself a useful legislator.
Mr. Willcox is a trustee of the Y. M.C.A. Building, as well as a member of the
managing committee of that institution. He is a trustee of the North Adelaide Institute,
and a director of many mining and commercial companies. His name Is prominently
associated with the Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures, organisations to which he
has consistently lent his practical assistance. For many years he has taken a leading
part in the affairs of the Agricultural Society, and is now an active member of that body-
Mr. Willcox has been a prominent adherent and supporter of the Baptist Church in North
Adelaide for the last quarter of a century.
To the people in North Adelaide he has done a memorable municipal service in
beautifying and embellishing the locality, particularly Brougham Place Square, while to
the general advance of the city he has devoted time, pains, and ability. His commercial
energies have percolated into almost every local channel in and about Adelaide, and to-day
he employs probably more labor than any other single person in the Province. Philanthropy
has ever kept pace with his financial success ; and many charitable institutions, promotive
organisations, fraternities, and guilds have had occasion to express their gratitude for his
timely help.

Mr. W. P. Cummins, M.P.
AS is very right and proper in a Province such as South Australia, the Parliament
contains a lair proportion ot men who have had a somewhat extended experience in
agricultural affairs. The Province depends so largely on this industry, with that of
pastoral pursuits, that such representation is but natural and necessary. Of this class
of representatives, Mr. W. P.
Cummins may be taken as a
specimen of the Middle North
farmers —the Stanley district,
which includes some of the finest
agricultural lands and most
prosperous farmers in South
Australia.
William Patrick Cummins was
born at Virginia, South Australia,
on April 12, 1855. He was
educated in his native town, and
when old enough assisted his
parents on 1 dr farm at Peachy
Pelt. In 1871 his father, the late
Richard Cummins, removed to
Collinsfield, and Mr. W. P.
Cummins continued his association
with him until 1885, when, in
partnership with his brother.
Mr. J. |. Cummins, he started
grazing and farming operations at
“ Fairview,” Hope’s Gap, near
Collinsfield. Notwithstanding the
droughts that have been so
frequent since that year, their
efforts have been successful.
For many years Mr. Cummins has been prominently associated with public affairs
in the district of his residence. He was for several years a member of the Snowtown District
Council, and is a Justice of the Peace. He has been an active member of the Hibernian
Australasian Catholic Benefit Society, having been chosen first President of the Redhill branch
of that society. In these ways he became well and favorably known throughout the district,
and when in October, 1896, he offered himself to the suffragists of the Stanley District for a
seat in the House of Assembly, he. was elected. Mr. Cummins is the successor of the late
Hon. P. P. Gillen, and follows his predecessor in the liberality ol his political views.

Mr. John Darling, jun., M.P.
A GRICULTU RAF produce, a great national resource of South Australia, lacked for
±\_ many years a convenient and systematic form of expansion and export. A lew
city merchants and large farmers attempted to open up markets across the seas for
colonial produce; but their proceedings were irregular and their success limited b\ the
* 11 4- 1-n ✓ . «
comparative smallness of their
un derl a kings. Mr . Jo h n
Darling, the father of the subject
of this biography, with a far-
seeing eye —a clear, calculating
instinct opened up a channel of
extensive and expanding business
activity in connection with the
orain trade ot South Australia.
< 7
Mr. John Darling, jun., became a
partner with his father, and the
business eventually assumed very
J J
large proportions.
John Darling, jun., was born
in Edinburgh on January 24,
1852. Four years after his birth
his parents left their native shores
for Adelaide. The son was some
time afterwards sent to school, and
in the meantime the father —of
whom a biographical sketch is
given in succeeding pages
entered into business pursuits.
His capabilities were soon
asserted in the Province. He
saw his course, he planned his
career, and started his commercial
machinery. Considerable difficulty was experienced at first in organising his intentions and
methods ot procedure; but Mr. Darling, sen., gradually surmounted all obstacles, and with
great financial acuteness carried his business on with ever-increasing success and profit.
When, in 1866, Mr. John Darling, jun., completed his education, he entered the
counting-house of his father. After gaining a thorough acquaintance with the various
details of the business, he became a partner in 1872, and the firm was thereafter known
as J. Darling & Son, millers, grain and general merchants. Mr. Darling had worked
hard during his term of apprenticeship, and, as a partner, showed an exhaustive, well-
acquired knowledge of the work in which he was engaged. The business grew rapidly.


The efforts of the firm were severely taxed to cope with the increasing trade, while
considerable exertions were used in opening up influential relationships with British and
foreign commercial houses. To expedite and assist matters in this direction, Mr. Darling
made an eminently successful trip to England by way of America in 1881. Another visit
to the home country was undertaken in 1894 by Mr. Darling, jun., in the important
interests of the firm. The nature of its commercial pursuits necessitated close association
with the leading marts of the United Kingdom for the export trade. The firm has
established its claims to be considered among the largest grain merchants in Australasia ;
and it has branches in Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania.
Mr. Darling, jun., has identified himself with many commercial ventures outside
his own particular business as a wheat and grain merchant. In intercolonial and coasting
shipping he has been largely interested for the last 27 years ; and he has held the
responsible post of President of the General Employers' Union ot South Australia. 1 his
honorary position is by no means a sinecure. On the contrary, the efforts, energies, and
skill of its prominent members and officials have often been called into active and anxious
requisition. The presidential office holds within its province the lever for much good and
harm in the relations obtaining between employer and employe, and diplomacy, tact, and
discretionary judgment are not only in constant exercise, but are indispensable to the
safe efuidance of the Union. He has also been Director, lor several years, of the
O '
Port Adelaide Dock Company , and has also occupied the presidential chair of the
Shipowners’ Association of South Australia. His interests in mining centre largely round
the famous Broken Hill mines; and in 1892 he was appointed a director of the Broken
Hill Proprietary Company. His able services as President of the South Australian
Chamber of Commerce in 1891, also in 1899, gave abundant proof of his comprehensive
knowledge of commerce and finance.
In April, 1896, Mr. Darling, jun., was returned for the electorate of East Torrens,
and as a parliamentary representative he has more than exceeded the favorable expectations
formed of his political capabilities. He has proved himself an earnest politician, careful
of the interests of his constituency, and zealous for the prosperity and well-being ot the
Province in which he has so large a stake. As an authority on finance, he has few peers
in the House of Assembly.
The principal gram supply ot the firm of Darling N Son has lately been drawn
from the Riverina and Victoria, there being a compulsion to fall back on these places
owino- to the disastrous seasons South Australia has unfortunately experienced of late years.
Mr. Darling sen., retired from the business in October, 1897, since which time the
subject of this sketch has been sole proprietor. On November i, 1900, Mr. Darling
purchased the goodwill of the business so long carried on by Messrs. J. Dunn & Co.,
together with their Eclipse Roller Flour Mills at Port Adelaide. His commercial
success merits the congratulatory admiration of all who can appreciate the magnitude of
the business reared, developed, and extended by his own skill and perseverance. Mr.
Darling bears with him that influential authority that ever accrues to the acknowledged
virtues of a savant. His superior standing in the ranks of Australian commerce, his
uncommon financial and business qualifications, have attracted to his respected personality
profound regard and marks of general esteem.

Mr. Walter Hughes Duncan, M.P
SOUTH AU ST RAIMA is so dependent on her agricultural and pastoral industries that
it is but right and fair they should have due representation in the Parliament of the
Province. Prominent among those members of the House of Assembly who represent
the pastoral interests is Mr. Walter Hughes Duncan, who sits for Onkaparinga in that
Chamber He was born at
Anstruther, Fifeshire, Scotland, in
1848, and he and his brother, John
James Duncan, came to South
Australia with their father, Captain
John Duncan, in 1854. Captain
Duncan and his brother-in-law,
Sir Walter Watson Hughes,
engaged in squatting, and took
up station property, which was
eventually found to contain the
famous Wallaroo and Moonta
Copper Mines. The station, as
originally selected by them, ran
from Tipera Springs to Tickera
Springs, and from Wallaroo to
Green s Plains, covering altogether
a very considerable area. Mr.
Duncan spent his boyhood years
on the fraternal property, and was
sent to be educated at St. Peter’s
College with his brother Mr. J. J.
Duncan. After the Wallaroo and
Moonta Mines had been dis-
covered, Mr. J. J. Duncan was
given control of the office at the
mines, whilst Mr. W. H. Duncan
proceeded to Cambridge. Having
spent two years at that seat of learning, he returned to South Australia, and immediately
engaged in pastoral pursuits, as his father had done before him.
In 1871 he was given a station in the North-East— by name Oulnina- -a property
of 800 square miles, which he still holds. In conjunction with his brother he also selected
a large cattle station in the Far North ; but that venture was subsequently abandoned.
Mr. W. H. Duncan is proprietor of Mernowie, a fine farming property near Saddleworth.
In this district he resided for eight years, and during that period took a more than passing
interest in the public affairs of the locality, lie was Chairman of the Waterloo District
Council for five years.


()t late years Mr. Duncan has resided at Stirling West, in the Onkaparinga
District, and, as has been mentioned, it is this constituency he represents in the
Lower House of the Legislature. He presented himself as a candidate in April. 1896,
and was returned at the head of the poll, defeating five other candidates. He occupied the
same triumphant position also in the General Election of 1899. Since his advent in politics
he has brought to bear much sound and useful knowledge on pastoral matters —a subject
with which he naturally is well acquainted. Though not a “ Rupert of debate,” Mr. Duncan
can hold his own in Parliamentary discussion. I o inspect his station properties he has to
travel over a considerable area of country, and his face is a familiar one throughout the
settled districts in the North of this Province. Mr. Duncan has many admirable qualities
which commend him to his fellows.
Mr. Robert Caldwell, M.P
THE member of Parliament who speaks oftenest and longest is not necessarily the best
representative of a constituency. Of the quiet members, Mr, Robert Caldwell is held
in great regard. He was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1843, and six years later
was brought to this Province by his father. Mr. Caldwell, sen., engaged in agricultural
pursuits at various places in the Province ; he was among the earliest settlers on the Alma
Plains, and subsequently at Mount Templeton. Eventually he removed to Yorke Peninsula.
At this period Robert Caldwell left his father and struck out on his own behalf. Possessed of
bodily vigor and an alert intelligence, he became a farmer at Woodside, in the Onkaparinga
district, and there he has since remained. During all these years he had studied the economic
conditions of South Australia, and obtained a good mastery of the subject. He had formed
his own opinions on local requirements, and the trend of legislation. In 1884 he wooed
the suffrages of the electors of Yorke Peninsula, and was returned by them to the House
of Assembly. In 1887 he was re-elected. In 1890 he offered his services to the Onkaparinga
electors, and was returned at the head of the poll. He still sits for that constituency. He
has always evinced an active interest in all movements for promoting the agricultural interests
of the Province, and has sat on several Commissions appointed to deal with these interests.
Mr. Caldwell is a friend to all productive industries, and has fathered numbers of motions
in their favor. His earnestness in Parliament has made him popular, and it is safe to say that
there are few such earnest politicians. Of the Woodside Institute Mr. Caldwell was one of the
first presidents ; he was also one of the earliest members of the School Board of Advice
for that locality. He has been a frequent contributor to the press, in poetry as well as in
prose. From his place in the House he champions the cause of the oppressed. Because
of his sincerity, and his readiness to render help, he is respected both in and out of
Parliament. His recommendations are best exemplified by the continuous length of his
parliamentary career.

Mr. William Gilbert, M.P.
IT is to the possession of common-sense, intelligence, and businesslike method that Mr.
William Gilbert’s excellence and value as a legislator must be ascribed. During a
long parliamentary career he has been an indefatigable worker, and as an earnest
supporter of the principle of Bible-reading in State schools, local option, Sunday closing,
1 * i 1 _ I . * /"v T < 1 IV / i
and In other social reforms, he
has been particularly prominent.
William Gilbert is a native of
Aylesbury, Bucks, and was born
J J
in 1829. He was brought up to
the engineering and machinery
business with his father, and
carried on himself a large concern
in that line for many years.
Leaving this business he engaged
in milling pursuits at W ooburn.
near Maidenhead, England, which
not proving satisfactory, he
came to South Australia. At one
time, in England, Mr. Gilbert
evinced a special interest in the
Corn Law agitation ; his activity
in this direction causing him
to be summoned to the bar
of the House of Commons to
crive evidence in an election
<75
enquiry arising from the historical
turmoil. In 1869, already 40
years old, he came to South
Australia, and a few years later
began that series of public services
so well appreciated in the Pro-
vince He entered into business as a hay and chaff merchant and wheatbuyer in Adelaide
Mr. C. Willcox joining him two years later; subsequently the latter gentleman became
sole proprietor, Mr. Gilbert carrying on a similar business with his nephew. Mr. Payne,
at Gawler and Adelaide. He has also, for the past 29 years, been interested in farming-
pursuits in Yatala, the district he represents in Parliament.
Until 1878, Mr. Gilbert was gaining a footing in South Australia, and quietly
mastering the conditions of government and society in the Province. In that year he was
elected a member of the Adelaide City Council, and he has been continuously serving the
public in some prominent capacity ever since. In 1879 he retired from the Council, and
in 1881 was elected to the House of Assembly for the Yatala constituency. So satisfied


have the electors of this district been with him as their representative that they have
returned him at each succeeding election. Colonial electors are of such an unstable
character that the representative ol any one district must be exceedingly worthy who can
retain their confidence for a period of over 20 years. The business qualities and excellent
common-sense of Mr. Gilbert were rapidly made apparent to his brother legislators, and he
has sat on a large number of Royal Commissions and Committees. In 1882 he was a
member ol the Royal Commission which advised on the redistribution of electoral districts ;
in 1886 he was on the Stores Commission; in 1890 on the Angaston Railway and the
Aged Poor Commissions: in 1894 he was on the Blyth-Gladstone Railway and Intercolonial
hree Trade Commissions; and in 1897 he was a member of the Northern Territory
Commission. With Sir John Colton and Mr. M. Salom, he is one of the three Charity
Commissioners. In 1894 he was successful in carrying a motion to remove the Royal
Agricultural Society from the old grounds to the new Exhibition and Grounds. These
varied enquiring and advisory duties demanded a vast amount of work and, because
of their diverse nature, of researchful knowledge. In gathering evidence, and in weighing
and sitting it, Mr. Gilbert was always businesslike and judicial; and his discrimination
greatly assisted the labors of these bodies. An ardent religionist, he was successful, in
1883, in having the Totalisator Act repealed: but three years later, in 1886,
another Totalisator Bill was introduced and carried. In [B9O a long debate took place
on a motion bv Mr. Gilbert to secure Bible-reading in State schools. The whole Province
J O
was excited over this controversial subject: but the proposal was negatived. Upon another
occasion Mr. Gilbert unsuccessfully sought to remove the bar preventing ministers of religion
from sitting in Parliament.
At different times Mr. Gilbert has been offered portfolios, but he does not pine for the
glamor of office, preferring rather to serve his constituents and the Province as a private
member. The commercial mind is more valuable to a young country than the oratorical ;
it is, indeed, a pity that Mr. Gilbert has not seen his way clear to accept a portfolio.
He has been Chairman of the Country Party in the Assembly for some years.
J J J J
Of non-political public positions Mr. Gilbert has filled quite a variety. He has
been for many years associated with the Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures, acting
on the committees of both. For ten years he has been a trustee of the Savings Bank.
He is a member of the Licensing Bench, and has been three years President of the Royal
Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia. For ten years he was a member
of the Hospital Board and of the Destitute Board. He is at present a member of the
committees of the Children’s Hospital, North Adelaide Institute, City Mission, Aborigines’
Mission, and Industrial School for the Blind. He has been President of the Baptist
Union, and President and Treasurer of the Young Men’s Christian Association, as also
a vice-president of the S. A. Cricketing Association from its inception.
As has been stated, to religious and philanthropic matters Mr. Gilbert has always
given devotion ; and it may be said that the years of his life in South Australia have been
busy and devoted to the public good, for which he has received no remuneration whatever,
except as member of Parliament, and he opposed that proposal when it was brought
forward. During the last 20 years few public men have occupied so many important positions,
and for his many sterling qualities he is highly esteemed by a very wide circle in the Province.

Mr. James Hague, M.P.
FEW districts in South Australia are so picturesque as that of Barossa, which Mr.
Hague represents in the House of Assembly. It embraces some of the best
farming localities, the richest fruit and wine-producing districts, and the sweetest
types of Australian scenery—the rolling hills, the rugged eucalypt, and the meandering
creek. In its time, too, the
Barossa district has returned to
Parliament some of the greatest
men the Province has seen,
such as Sir R. C. Baker, Sir
John Downer, and Messrs. J. H.
Angas, W. Duffield. and J.
Martin. It also contains the
important town of Gawler,
now the centre of the machine
and locomotive manufacturing
industry of the Province, and
at one time known as “ the
South Australian Athens,’ owing
to the residence there of several
men of literary ability. I o main-
tain the traditions of the district
Mr. H ague had an uphill fight ;
but it is only simple justice to say
that, despite the brilliancy of
intellect which distinguished some
of his predecessors, the present
representative of Barossa has well
upheld its reputation for returning
able and worthy men to the
Legislature.
James Hague was born in
Manchester in 1834, and, upon the advice of friends, came to South Australia m 1855
with his brother Edward. Both carried letters of introduction to residents in the Angaston
District, whither they proceeded on their arrival. Alter following seveial pursuits, in the
manner of all young new-comers to Australia, Mr. James Hague opened in business as a
general storekeeper, and later on his brother joined him, and the present him ot J. be E. Hague
was established. There is no business house better known in the Angaston country than
this, and, as all admit who are acquainted with its methods, it has been a decided benefit to
the district. Mr. James Hague has long been prominently associated with the public interests
ot Angaston, and earned a praiseworthy record.


It was in 1890 that, upon the retirement of Mr. Basedow, and in response to
an influential requisition, he was nominated to a seat in the Assembly for the Barossa
constituency, and was duly elected. Such was the esteem in which his services were held,
that at the general election in 1893, he was again elected; while in 1896 and 1899 he was
returned at the head of the poll, Sir John Downer being his,colleague. Mr. Hague has been
fairly active in debate, and as he is essentially a common-sense and earnest man, his
addresses are always received with respect. To him parliamentary work is a serious
duty, and he shows that he considers his position in the Legislature demands an honest
pursuance of the country’s interests, independent of personal ambition. He has made
abundantly clear that he is in conduct and character a man to be trusted and relied
upon ; while as a speaker he is pronounced by capable critics “ clear, concise, thoughtful,
and fair. In manner, Mr. Hague is unassuming and kindly, and his popularity is not
confined to his own district. Indeed, since his entry into Parliament he has won
admirers throughout the Province, many of whose names, probably, he has never heard.
Major John William Castine, M.P.
THE name of Major John William Castine has attained prominence in the Province
in connection with its militia, and to his enthusiasm the present Defence Force is
largely indebted for many of the advantages it possesses. But Mr. Castine has
won laurels also in the political arena. He was born in Plymouth, Devonshire, on May
26, 1846, and at the age of 16 left England for South Australia. He arrived in the Province
in September, 1862 ; and for a long time after his arrival he engaged in commercial pursuits
in country parts as a storekeeper. As a stock-valuer also his reputation for efficiency was
widely recognised. From the first he took an eager and active part in the volunteer
movement, and was twice elected President of the old National Rifle Volunteer Council,
then representative of 1,652 men, exclusive of officers. His enthusiasm in this position went
far to establish the militia corps on a new and sound basis. He devoted unfailing attention
to his duties as an officer, and received promotion for his services. The demands of political
life were destined, however, to occupy the largest share of his energies and devotion. In
1884 he entered the House of Assembly as representative of the Wooroora electorate, and
he has retained that seat in the House ever since. Mr. Castine belongs to the Independent
Party in Parliament, and for several years he held the honorable position of secretary of
that party. In the House Mr. Castine is a constant debater and fluent reasoner.
He has served on several Royal Commissions and Parliamentary Select Committees.
He is one of the trustees of the Savings Bank, and a member of the Board of Governors
of the Botanic Gardens. Mr. Castine is widely popular in the Province, and his long
public services have often been highly praised by those who can place a proper valuation
on unselfish conduct and labor. He has played no unimportant part in the framing of South
Australian legislation since his entry into Parliament, his sober reasoning and moderate counsel
having often had a salutary effect on the extremists on both sides of the popular Chamber
of South Australia.

Mr. J. Miller, M.P.
MR. MILLER is one of the most practical and experienced representatives of the
farming community in the House of Assembly. Ihe knowledge that he has
acquired in actual participation in such pursuits and in careful observation during
somewhat extensive trips through the country has frequently proved serviceable to the
Province, and particularly to
members of Parliament when
important measures of land
legislation have demanded their
o
consideration. Mr. Miller is not
one of those farmers who are
content to keep in one unenter-
prising groove, nor is he hopelessly
conservative in his opinions on
questions of land cultivation. He
believes that one can be constantly
learning to discriminate and judge
from the lessons which years of
experience have taught him.
An Australian native, Mr.
Miller was born at Hindmarsh-
then a very small suburb of
Adelaide —on July 12, 1840, his
parents having been among the
earliest arrivals in South Australia.
The days of his youth were
important days in the history of
the Province. He witnessed the
birth of most of the industries
which the Province even now
possesses. There was a roman tic-
atmosphere in a childhood and
youth spent in the half-tamed country in the presence of blacks, and with the necessaiiK
nomadic characteristics of the white settlers. Efforts were being made to push the outposts
of settlement farther into the bush, and the remarkable and adventurous characters which
such pursuits attracted abounded in the Province. It is certain that his youthful experiences
had a large influence on Mr. Miller’s character, and tended to impart to it a sturdy, sensible
side. In 1855 he took up his residence at Strathalbyn, one of the first outposts of settlement,
and he remained there until 1861, when he removed to Athelstone. During these years he
had been associated with agricultural pursuits.


While resident at Athelstone he first demonstrated his fitness for public positions.
In 1861 he was elected a member of the Payneham District Council, and he was for some
time its chairman. He had only just entered upon his manhood, but his success in the Council
proved that he bore a sensible head on young shoulders. He became a member of the
Chalmers Church, and in 1872 was elected a Deacon. In 1873 Mr. Miller went to Crystal
Brook, took up an area of country which during subsequent years he has used for
agricultural purposes, and joined the Bible Christian Church, of which he has since been
a prominent member. He was one of the founders of Way College, attached to that
denomination. The soil in that neighborhood is excellent, and, taking it as a whole,
Mr. Miller’s sojourn there has been fortunate in more ways than one. He quickly associated
himself with public bodies in the new district, and rose to the most important offices in
connection with them. At various times he has been President of the North-Western
Agricultural Society, and of the South Australian Farmers’ Association, institutions which
gained not a little advantage from his deliberations and generous assistance. He was also a
member of the School Board of Advice.
Having in view his services in connection with public bodies, and the sturdiness
of his views, it was only natural that Mr. Miller should be destined to enter upon a
parliamentary career. In 1881 he unsuccessfully contested a seat in the Legislative
Council ; but in 1884 he was elected to the House of Assembly for the District of
Stanley. During the following sessions he made an excellent impression on his fellow-
members. Important questions dealing with landed interests were discussed, and Mr.
Miller’s views upon them commanded respect. He retired from Parliament and took a
seat on the Pastoral Board, on which he was engaged as a representative for the farmers
from 1885 to 1888. In 1890 he was again elected to the Assembly for Stanley ; was
defeated in 1893, and returned in 1896 and 1899. In these further terms he has added to the
services which he previously rendered the farming community by his parliamentary work.
He is one of the most doughty champions of their rights, and without his special knowledge
of land questions, his place in Parliament would be difficult to fill. He has been associated
with numbers of important measures, the one for which he has striven most assiduously
and successfully being the establishment ot agricultural schools at Adelaide, Jamestown,
Narracoorte, and Clare, and has conferred very substantial benefits on the country.
To sum up briefly, it must be said that his services merit the general appreciation
with which they are regarded, and that his career is as creditable to the Province of which
he is a native as it is to himself.
Mr. Alexander McDonald, M.P
MR. A. McDONALD was born at Orkney in 1849, leaving two years later
for South Australia. At the age of 15, he started farming, and for nine
years he pursued this toilsome occupation ; he then spent nine years in the
establishment of Messrs. R. H. Wigg & Sons, grocers and wine and spirit merchants,
Adelaide. At length he became the possessor of a large storekeeping business at Blackwood.
In 1887 he was returned to the House of Assembly for the District of Noarlunga, having
' * O o
been re-elected at each periodic election since. He has for nearly half a century resided
in the Province, and his public services are much appreciated.

Mr. Johann Theodor Scherk, M.P.
A PROMINENT feature, in the composition of the population of South Australia is
the prevalence of the German element; and the energy that has been displayed by
German settlers in developing the resources of the Province is apparent in many
directions, Their thrift and plodding perseverance have been instrumental in earning for
these immigrants from the Father-
land the desirable title of “ model
settlers.” It has often been said,
and the truth of the general state-
ment is unquestionable, that under
British rule Germans are among
the best colonists in the world.
While some in South Australia
have spent their life-long days in
extending and improving their
selected areas under tillage and
pasturage, there are not a few who
have risen to greater prominence
by their public activity and zeal, and
by the sincerity with which they
have associated themselves with
the political and legislative affairs
of the Province. No better
example of this class can be cited
than that supplied by Mr. Scherk,
one of the most respected citizens
and politicians in South Australia.
With a knowledge that is widely
recognised, and a popularity ex-
tending in all directions, Mr.
o
Scherk has acquitted himself with
credit during his long and useful
public career.
In the city of Kiel, in Holstein, Germany, Johann 1 heodor Scherk was born
on July 8, 1836. His father was a doctor in that town, and a man of scholastic attainments,
who was for many years Chancellor of the Kiel P niversity and Professor of Astronomy
and Mathematics. Prom surroundings so learned the son imbibed principles of knowledge.
From a father so doctrinally distinguished he inherited many talents. His education was
well cared for, and when he left Kiel for South Australia he was well equipped with the
usual complement of educational training. An attraction for distant lands pervaded his
youthful ambitions and fostered a disinclination for mere book-work. He had heard of


South Australia and the many colonists from his own soil who had sought their fortune
there, and he determined to throw in his lot with them in this British Province.
On his arrival in Adelaide in 1861, he repaired to the German townships of Lobethal
and Tanunda, where he became a schoolmaster under the rdgwie of the old Pducation Council.
For several years he followed this occupation, and the younger generation of these German
settlements profited educationally by his instruction. In 1870 Mr. Scherk left for Adelaide,
where he invested in an agency business. In this enterprise he was fortunate, and his
business relationship assumed, in course of time, substantial proportions. His commercial
qualifications were as marked as his professional endowments. On attaining a measure
of independent fortune, Mr. Scherk resolved to turn his attention actively and practically
to public affairs. He had interested himself in the politics of the Province since his
arrival, and had closely watched the course of legislative events. In May, 1886. he
stood as a candidate for Flast Adelaide, and he was elected at the head of the poll, an
honor which was repeated successively in the triennial general elections of 1887, 1890,
1893, 1896, and 1899; a continued declaration in his favor of this high nature is sufficient
to prove the high opinion his electorate held, and still holds, of his political worth. He
has always been unremitting in his efforts to discharge the duties entrusted to him, and his
attendance in the House was constant. Ihe reason of this constancy is his love for all
legislative agenda. He follows the debates with a closeness of attention that enables him to
at once train vantage ground when it comes to his turn tor discussion and argument. Ihe
O o o
great object of Mr. Scherk’s life is devoted to the progressive cause of South Australian
institutions.
In the Assembly he has introduced several measures which he has carried to a
successful issue. The Savings Bank Amendment Act is one of these, and friendly societies
now enjoy the fruits of this labor. His undertakings have always been prompted by his
earnest convictions. IVlr. Scherk aims at gradual and efficacious advance. Huge strides of
radical and avalanchedike reform, the playthings of plunging minds, do not receive his
support. He is a member of the Adelaide School Board of Advice, and his mature
experience m connection with educational matters has been highly valued by his co-members.
Many years before entering Parliament he was President of a Young Men’s Debating
Society. He also took a special interest in the welfare of friendly societies, being a Past
Grand of the Manchester Unity. For some time he occupied the position of Grand I reasurer
of the Independent Order of Oddfellows, and in 1886 he was elected as Grand Master of
the Order for the Province. At the present time the offices of treasurer and trustee of
various Lodges are discharged by him. L nder his auspices and direction as Chairman
of the Committee of the Grand United Friendly Societies’ Demonstration the greatest
and most successful demonstration that Adelaide has beheld was brought off, and for his
services in this connection he received the compliments of the then Governor, the late Sir
William Robinson. The Masonic craft claims Mr. Scherk as one of its most prominent
members. He is a member of the Druids, and was elected first honorary member of the
United Daughters of Australia. He is Past Grand Master of the Independent Order of
Oddfellows.
A few years ago Mr. Scherk was appointed a Commissioner tor taking affidavits of
the Supreme Court, and in 1882 was made a Justice of the Peace. He was constituted a


member of the Council of the South Australian federation League. As a member of the
Council of the Zoological and Acclimatisation Society he has exerted himself in no lukewarm
manner to set that institution on a serviceable basis. Mr. Scherk has acted with vigor on tie
Parliamentary Printing Committee, also on the Commission of the Pechmcal Education
Board, which urged very strongly the establishment of the present School of Mines and
Industries. He was accordingly appointed a member of the Council of this last-named
useful institution and Chairman of the Finance Committee. 1 hese positions are still retained
by him, and his services to the cause of technical education have been very marked.
Numerous sporting clubs and associations have attracted his patronage. He is a patron
of the South Australian Cricketing Association, of the Coopers Cricket Club, I resident
of the Avenue Cricket Club, Vice-president ol the South Adelaide football Club, and is
a patron of many kindred bodies. His philanthropical tendencies are widely recognised.
He has acted as secretary of many committees formed to relieve local distress, the condition
of the poor having always touched his heart as well as his pocket. In his donations and
spontaneous disbursements of eleemosynary gifts, it may be truly said of him that his
right hand knoweth not what the left cloeth.”
The course of this useful life has been potent for good, and has won general
esteem. Mr. Scherk has worked hard, and Adelaide enjoys the harvest of his earnest
and disinterested efforts.
Mr. W. Copley, M.P
BORN in the village of Hig'hgreen, near Sheffield, England, in 1845, William Copley
came to South Australia with his parents when four years old. Ihe Burra Burra
Copper Mine was entering the heyday of its fame, and there the family proceeded and
remained for two years. After two years spent at the Victorian diggings they returned to
South Australia, taking up their residence at York, in the West Torrens district, and the son
was sent first to the Hindmarsh Public School, and afterwards to Mr. James Baths School at
North Adelaide. As a young man Mr. William Copley embarked in agricultural pursuits and
farmed on the Murray Plats for about seven years, and also on the Blackrock Plains in the
North, where he still resides. He was for several years one of the three Examiners in
Practical Agriculture at the Roseworthy College, and in 1883-4 was President of the South
Australian Farmers’ Association. Mr. Copley began his political career in 1884, when he was
elected to the House of Assembly for the District of Erome ; but at the general election in
1887 he experienced defeat. In June, 1887, however, he was returned to the Legislative
Council for the Northern District. Offering himself for election in 1893, he was rejected,
and continued in private life till 1896, when he was again elected to the House of Assembly,
on this occasion for the District of Yorke Peninsula. He was for about twelve months
Commissioner of Crown Lands In the first Playford Government. In 1890. upon a
re-arrangement of portfolios, he became Minister of Agriculture and Education. For nearly
two years he occupied this post, and after Sir John Downer defeated Mr. Holder, in October,
1892, he again resumed it, exchanging it for that of Chief Secretary in May, 1893. He has
sat on several Royal Commissions, and was a member of the South Australian Commission
in Adelaide for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886.

Mr, J, W. Shannon, M.P.
I YEN a good rainfall, and parts ot Yorke Peninsula contain agricultural lands as
Jf remunerative as any in South Australia, and the town and district of Maitland has
especial claims in this respect. Nature in Australia has been somewhat indiscriminate
in her gifts. She places in the heart of a useless wilderness a beautiful oasis, or within
a fine stretch of soil a barren
centre. It is not always possible
to judge from the summit of one
hill what class of soil lies beyond
the summit ot the next. 1 his is
true of some parts ot Yorke
Peninsula. After a dreary enough
drive from Moonta, the traveller
ascends a hill, whence he sees as
charming a town and valley as any
in South Australia. This is the
town and district of Maitland,
which Mr. Shannon represents in
Parliament.
Mr. John Wallace Shannon
is the youngest son of the late
Abraham Shannon, of Moculta,
South Australia, where he was
born on April 28, 1862. He
received the mam portion ot his
education under Mr. Leonard,
8.A., at Angaston. After leaving
school, he started farming on the
Murray Flats ; but not altogether
satisfied with the neighborhood,
he migrated thence in 1887 for
Maitland, Yorke Peninsula. Here
— - - 7
he engaged in farming and auctioneering pursuits, and the wisdom of his change of residence
was soon borne home to him. The agricultural lands of Maitland are rich, the rainfall is
reliable, and the pasture capable of sustaining a good percentage of stock to the acre.
Hence Mr. Shannon, in both branches of his business, was successful, and he rose to
be one of the most influential men in the district.
After his arrival in the Peninsula, Mr. Shannon began to associate himself with
public affairs, and he was gazetted a Justice of the Peace, being then but -6 \eais o
age; and about the same time he was elected to the Yorke Peninsula Distnct oun^


at the first election under the new District Councils Act. So useful a member was he
that, after being only four years in the Council, he was made Chairman, and held that post
for four years in succession. He was an active member of the Council, and did valuable
work for the district. He has been prominently associated with the local institute committee
for eight years, and has been Vice-president of it since 1894, He is a member of the
Independent Order of Oddfellows, Manchester Unity. I hus, as well as through his
business engagements, he became respected and popular in the district.
In April, 1896, and again in 1899, the electors of Yorke Peninsula returned him
to the House of Assembly as their senior member. In the sessions ot Parliament which
have followed, Mr. Shannon has demonstrated his political ability. His experience has
taught him that the paramount industries of the Province demand the careful attention
<“!) A
and devotion of those who study and strive for her best interests.
Of the proposed amalgamation of the municipal and district councils, Mr. Shannon
was an earnest advocate, and his reputation in Yorke Peninsula would seem to be
absolutely assured.
J
Mr. P. McM. Glynn, 8.A., LL.B., M.P
GORT, County Galway, Ireland, was the birthplace of Mr. Patrick McMahon Glynn,
on August 25, 1855. After completing his elementary instruction, Mr. Glynn
proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin, where he studied Arts and Law. He went
through the several curricula of the Faculties with distinction, and attained honors in
Logic and a certificate for Oratory in the Historical Society. Having taken the Arts and
Law degrees, on the completion of his legal studies Mr. Glynn, in April, 1879, was called
to the Irish Bar. In that year he won the Silver Medal for Oratory in the Law
Students’ Debating Society of Ireland. Seeking a more open sphere for the exercise of
his profession, Mr. Glynn came to Australia towards the close of 1880, and he was
admitted to the Victorian Bar in December of the same year. Shortly, however, after
establishing himself in that Colony, he saw a wider and better opening for his professional
vocation in South Australia, and in July, 1882, came to Kapunda. For several years he
practised his profession successfully in that town ; employing his leisure in lecturing on
political topics, and writing leading articles for the Kapunda Herald. In 1887 Mr. Glynn
stood as a parliamentary candidate for the District ot Light, and was elected. But, at
the following election, he was defeated by only 36 votes. In 1895, he was returned for
the District of North Adelaide, a success that was not repeated at the next election. At
a bye-election in 1897, Mr. Glynn was once more returned as member of the House of
Assembly for North Adelaide; and since that event he has always been in the forefront
of debaters in that Chamber. Mr. Glynn has served on several Royal Commissions,
and has written many political pamphlets. For several years Mr. Glynn has been
President of the Irish National League in South Australia; and he is a public lecturer
of established reputation. He is also one of the best amateur riders in the Province, and
has been a prominent member of the Adelaide Hunt Club for a long time past. An
ardent advocate of Australian federation, at the election of delegates to the P'ederal
Convention of 1897. Mr. Glynn was chosen as one of the ten representatives of the Province.

Mr. Vaiben Louis Solomon, M.P.
THE men who have built up our British colonies and bequeathed an Empire as a
monument of their undaunted courage have been sparingly recompensed by their
contemporaries. In the Province of South Australia we find sires and sons alike
devoting; the full measure of their abilities to the general cause. Mr. V. L. Solomon
is one whose name can be
mentioned in this connection, for
his father before him is well
remembered as a useful colonist
and a valued legislator.
Vaiben Louis Solomon is a
son of the late Mr. Judah
Moss Solomon, who was for
many years a member of the
J J
Legislative Council, and was
Mayor of the City of Adelaide
J *
in 1869-70. Vaiben Louis was
born in Waymouth Street, Ade-
laide, in May, 1853, and was
trained at the late John L.
Young’s educational establishment
in the city—the same school that
has matured many of the brightest
legislative intellects in South
O
Australia. Completing his educa-
tion at the Scotch College,
Melbourne, Mr. Solomon, as a
young man, proceeded to the
Northern Territory, and after
some years became prominently
identified with the destinies of
that part of the Province as
proprietor of the Northern Territory Times and Gazette. As a journalist, he wielded a
facile pen in the cause of advancing the interests of the north country. He took a
pronounced stand against the wholesale immigration of Chinese, and lectured throughout the
colonies on what at one time threatened to become an alarming evil. He also brought
the question of the independence of the Northern Territory prominently before the public,
and it was a fitting tribute to his energetic labors that he was returned as one ot the first
representatives of that electorate in 1890, which he has continued to represent. Mr. Solomon
was not long in the House before his abilities were recognised, for in 1891 he was appointed


Government Whip to the second Playford Administration. This office practically embraces
the political secretaryship of the party in power, and is one of importance when the division
bells are ringing on a critical question. Ihe W hip holds the key to the Cabinet, and
is responsible for the solidarity of its supporters. The Holder Government succeeded the
Playford Ministry, and then, when Sir John Downer’s Ministry was formed, Mr. Solomon
again became Government Whip. At a later period he declined a portfolio. In June, 1899,
he was elected Leader of the Opposition in the House of Assembly, and in the December
following he was successful in bringing about the downfall of the long-lived Kingston
Ministry, and himself became Premier, though only for the short period ot eight days. His
work in the Assembly has always been marked by thoroughness, and in debate he speaks
with a forcible vigor that has won him many admirers.
When the Federal elections took place, in March, 1897, Mr. Solomons past
performances, and his capabilities, won for him a place amongst the ten representatives of
this Province. In the question of Federation he is uncommonly well versed. He had studied
the subject for years, and was able to devote himself to it with a clear understanding. In
his first election address he was a staunch advocate of intercolonial free trade.
Mr. Solomon is thus one of the leading figures in the South Australian Assembly.
A keen debater and a logical reasoner, he is not without repartee and witty retort, and both
men and measures antagonistic to his views have often met with a telling attack from
him. Sharp in summary, and quick to discern plans, he is a source of strength to his side.
Of recent years Mr. Solomon has identified himself in Adelaide with mining and
financial pursuits. He holds many interests in Northern Territory and Western Australian
mining; ventures.

Mr. Clement Giles, M.P
THIS gentleman, who represents the farming class in the Parliament of the Province, was
born in Adelaide in 1844, and his father, Mr. William Giles, was one ot the most
prominent men in South Australia, being one of the early managers of the historical
South Australian Company, and a member of the first House of Assembly established under
the new Constitution of responsible government. After leaving school, Clement Giles for
some years lived on pastoral stations in South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria. In
1868 he started farming near Mount Remarkable, in South Australia, and soon afterwards
erected flourmills and wool-scouring sheds in the same district. In 1882 he became partner
in the firm of Giles & Smith, an old-established milling and merchandise business which had
already possessed a history ranging over 40 years. In this connection he has pursued a
successful business career. Mr. Giles took a prominent part in the formation of the South
Australian Farmers’ Association. He became Secretary to the body, an office which he
holds with credit and dignity to this day. In 1886 he was elected a member of the House of
Assembly for the District of Frome, and has been returned at each succeeding election. He
was Chairman of the Royal Commission which sat some ten years ago and advised on land
legislation, and largely led to the framing of the present laws. He was gazetted a Justice of
the Peace some 30 years ago

Mr. Charles Tucker, M.P.
THE City of Adelaide has been fortunate in having many able men as mayors. The
progressive work begun by one is continued through a series of capable and
patriotic municipal chiefs; and the attainments of former occupants prove a
stimulus to the advance of the successor. Mr. Charles I ucker, ex-Mayor of Adelaide, has.
by his own industry and persever-
ance, won his way to the front.
His capability for high and
onerous positions has been proved
and verified by the ability with
which he has discharged the
manifold functions of the offices
he has held.
Charles Tucker was born at
Walkerville, Adelaide, in 1857.
His parents arrived in the
Province in 1836, the year of the
foundation of South Australia.
In those primitive days of the
Province money was not too
abundant, education was lax, and
work was the all-in-all of existence.
Attention was chiefly concentrated
on the tilling of the soil, for if it
failed to yield, starvation rudely
stared the settlers in the face.
But certain scholars in Adelaide
supplied as best they could the
rudiments of knowledge to the
young; and Mr. Unwin, of
Walkerville, who had a fair
scholastic reputation in those
days, was entrusted with the early school training of Mr. Dicker. His education thus
begun was continued at Mr. J. L. Young’s school, and completed under private tuition.
Mr Tucker then repaired, with his parents, to the Encounter Bay district, where the
family resided for several years. In 1880 he migrated to Port Adelaide, where already
the bustle of commercial life seemed to offer opportunities for success. Serving for some
time in the office of Messrs. G. R. Selth & Co., he acquainted himself sufficiently in
the routine of ledger-keeping and general business life, thus enabling him to undertake
the management of the carrying business of Messrs. Graves & Co., of Port Adelaide.
This firm was in a comparative state of prosperity, and the managerial position was a


responsible one. But Mr. Tucker was too progressive and energetic to remain long in
subservience to any superior command. With his limited monetary accumulations, he
started in partnership with Mr. Malpas, and this firm traded under the name of Malpas
and Co., shipping and customs agents. About six months after the deeds of partnership
had been sealed, the combination dissolved, and Mr. Tucker remained to carry on
the business alone. His success compared favorably with others in a similar capacity,
and was fairly proportionate to the volume of trade passing at the time.
Mining, with its galleries of golden hopes, was already opening a new era in the
history of the Province, and its attractions magnetised the youth and energy of South
Australia. Mr. Tucker forsook his agency establishment, and trudged into the interior. In
conjunction with Mr. Fred. Ayers. Mr. Blades, and Mr. Gall, he erected the first battery
on a mining claim in the North-East. Mr. Tucker’s power of adaptability to the exigencies
of his environment, and his unflagging courage in the bush, ably seconded his prospecting
abilities. He was one of the early pioneers of the Mannahill mining district —a territory
which possessed claims to auriferous plenitude. The Trinity Mutooroo Copper Mine, on
the borders of South Australia and New South Wales, was opened up by him shortly after
these prospecting expeditions; and this property he continued to own. Mining, indeed, in
its various forms and aspects, seemed to be the sphere for which Mr. Tucker was most
suited. But Mr. Tucker does not let his wheels run in only one groove. With his
brother-in-law, Mr. Thomas Brown, he is the proprietor of the Nullarbor (treeless) Plains
Sheep Station —one of the largest pastoral properties in South Australia, with a full
complement ot stock. He has also been interested in other ventures. Often have Mr.
I ticker’s services been sought for boards and committees of various kinds. His career
reflects the possession of many useful qualities necessary to ensure success in the world.
I he year 1889 was the first in which Mr. Tucker appeared on the stage of public
life. He stood as candidate for the councillorship of the blast Ward of Port Adelaide, and
was returned. He remained in this capacity for fifteen months, faithfully endeavoring to
i J J o
minister to the wants of his ward and the whole municipality. It was soon recognised
by an observant public that Mr. Pucker was a capable adviser and municipal legislator.
His tact and moderation demonstrated his fitness for the administration of the duties of a
higher position. Por the last twelve months of his connection with the Port Council he
acted as Mayor’s Delegate to the Municipal Association. On the expiry of that time a
combination of circumstances necessitated the inhabitants of the Port choosing another
Mayor; and it was gratifying to those who were watching Mr. Tucker’s career to see
him elevated to the chief civic post. The town ot Port Adelaide retained his services as
Mayor for three consecutive years, and throughout this period he acted with persevering
energy and resourceful tact in the execution of the varied functions of his office.
Mr. I ucker acceded to several requisitions of Influential citizens to stand as
Alderman for the city of Adelaide. His decision was happy, for the success of this step
brought in its train consequences of further exaltation. He was elected Alderman on
December 1, 1893, the votes recorded in his favor exceeding by 800 the largest obtained in
O J o
any similar election. After a year’s service as Alderman he stood for the Mayoralty, and
J J


defeated the former occupant of the chair, the Hon. Charles Willcox, M.L.C., by nearly 600
votes. A good understanding with the citizens reigned sufficiently strong to enable Mr. Tucker
to gain the distinction of being returned for the mayoralty in the next two successive years,
1896 and 1897. hor the fourth time (1897-8) Mr. Tucker was returned to the Mayoralty by
a large majority. One has only to recount the numerous honorary functions connected with
the Mayoral office to show that the position is a highly responsible one Probably he could
have retained his Mayoralty for 1898-99, but that he refused nomination feeling that four
years was the limit that one man should occupy the position. He, however, still retained his
membership of the City Council, having been returned as Alderman by a large majority.
At the general election of 1899 for the House of Assembly, Mr. Tucker stood for
the District of Encounter Bay, and was returned at the head of the poll. A fresh election
was, however, declared necessary by the Court of Disputed Returns, owing to a technical
breach, by Mr. Tucker, of the electoral code. The electors, however, showed their confidence
in their selection by returning him at the head of the poll. Mr. Tucker represents the
Government on the h ire Brigades Board, having been a member of this institution since its
inception. With educational matters he has kept closely in touch. He was one of the first
two members elected to the School Board of Advice in Port Adelaide, and by virtue of his
polling the highest number of votes he ranked as senior member. Ultimately the Downer
Government appointed him their representative on the Board, and he was made Chairman
in the place of Mr. David Bower. He subsequently resigned that position on removing
to Adelaide.
Mr. Tucker’s patriotism has also been keenly marked by the lively interest he
took in every organisation that had the welfare of the Province as its prime object. Mr.
Tucker has warmly espoused the cause of the Australian Natives’ Association for many
years, and perhaps it was in consideration of this enthusiastic advocacy that he was appointed
first President of the Port Adelaide branch. When, too, at a later period, the Intercolonial
Conference of this Association was held in Melbourne, Mr. Tucker was chosen as a delegate
to represent South Australia at this important gathering.
Mr. Tucker was Vice-president of the Municipal Association in 1891, and in
1894 became its president. He is a Governor of the Botanic Gardens Board, a Commissioner
of the National Park Board, Chairman of the Hospital Board, a member of the Zoological
Gardens Board, and a member of the Adelaide Licensing Bench. Charitable organisations
and eleemosynary institutions have found in Mr. Tucker not only a genuine and generous
supporter in the way of monetary disbursements, but also an ardent and sympathetic worker
in the cause. A few of these compassionate societies are : The Christmas Cheer Fund,
Sick Poor Fund, Prisoners’ Aid Association. Distressed Women and Children's bund,
Strangers’ Benevolent Society, and the Home for Weak-minded Children. The liberality
of Mr. Tucker to deserving causes of all kinds reflects great credit on his sympathetic
disposition.
Mr. Tucker has repeatedly displayed his enthusiasm for sport and athletic exercise.
He is president, patron, and supporter of many sporting clubs. His liberality is übiquitous,
and widely appreciated throughout the city of Adelaide. During Mr. Tucker’s term of


office as Mayor the financial position of the corporation greatly improved. By wise,
cautious, and moderate action and diligent care, even at the risk of unpopularity,
he reduced the expenditure of the corporation, wiped off depressing arrears, and placed the
funds in a sound and healthy financial condition. His occupancy of the civic chair was
marked by the inauguration of many felicitous schemes and enactments, and in their
conception can be seen the impress ol his own sterling ability and his judicious foresight.
His popularity is unquestioned ; his personality has won for him warm and true friendships.
He is Past Worshipful Master of the United Lodge of Preemasons, a member of the
Grand Lodge of South Australia, Past Arch of the Acorn Lodge of Druids, a Mark
Mason, and a Royal Arch Mason.
Mr. Tucker is to be credited with the inauguration of the Local Government
Association, which was formed by joining the forces of the Municipal and District Councils
Associations, with the object of bringing the general government more in touch with the
wants of the people. This intermediate, deliberative body has been from its inception a
distinct success, and its ever-growing utility causes Mr. 1 ucker’s foresight and legislative
ability to stand out in great relief. Of this association he was first President.
Mr. Paris Nesbit, Q.C.
7
ANGASTON was the birthplace of Mr. Paris Nesbit on August 8, 1852. He was a
schoolfellow for some years of his Honor Mr. Commissioner Russell at his father’s
school, Angaston. He received a good grounding in German at the school of the
Rev. G. Rechner, at Light Pass, and afterwards at a school then conducted at Tanunda
by Mr. F. Basedow, who afterwards represented Barossa for many years in the House of
Assembly. Mr. Nesbit first appeared before the public in September, 1865, when he was
very successful at the last of a series of public competitive educational examinations. After
some three months in the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank at Kapunda, under Mr.
J. G. Pitcher, his father deemed a legal career more suitable than banking, and in
August, 1868, he was articled in the office of Messrs. Ingleby & Robinson. He commenced
practice in January, 1874, and in June of that year joined Mr. Nicholson, and was in
partnership with him until about the year 1880, when he joined the firm of Ingleby and
Grundy, thus constituting the firm of Ingleby, Grundy, & Nesbit. His next partnership
was with Messrs. Gordon & Bright for some seven or eight years, during which time he
<2 O J o
received the distinction of the office of Queen’s Counsel. He is now associated with Mr.
Noel Augustin Webb. On August 29, 1900, he entered the ranks of journalism by editing
a weekly entitled Morning , which attracted some attention in South Australia and the
other colonies. Mr. Nesbit’s literary capabilities are of a superior character. He has
made many translations from Goethe, Schiller, and Heine, which are considered by
competent judges to be of the very first order of merit. For about 10 years, from 1885
to 1895, he drafted nearly all the principal Acts of Parliament.

Sir J. H. Symon, K.C.M.G., Q.C.
P ItRHAPS the growing-pains of an infant country are more apt to bring the greatest men
to the front than old established communities. The one may produce a mute, inglorious
Milton, but the very struggles and travail of the other render such a circumstance less
likely. Ihe population is small, and under responsible government every man is aware that his
opinion and his vote may have a
distinct influence. The oppor-
tunities, the possibilities, the en-
couragements afforded, offer a great
chance of success in a public career.
During' the historv of South
o ✓
Australia there have been several
men whose irrepressible talent and
commonsense have lifted them to
the apex of local fame. Some have
been gifted with a power which
Lord Rosebery says is greater than
J J o
talent -the power to lead; some
by the sheer force of commonsense
have made names which shall be
perpetuated in history ; and some
have risen by reason of a happy
blending of these qualities, and
among them not the least has
been Sir 1. H. Symon, O.C. Llis
J J
splendid intellect and his oratorical
powers have now been recognised
for many years ; and whether at
* J
the Bar, where he is foremost, or
in an oration on public affairs, his
talent is known beyond the limits
J
of the Province.
Josiah Henry Symon was born at Wick, in the County of Caithness, in Scotland,
on September 27, 1846. From there, before he was a year old, his parents removed to
the beautiful town of Stirling, famous in history and in song, whose old grey castle looks
upon many battle-fields, from Bannockburn downwards, and there he received his
education, lie was dux of the High School in June, 1862, before he had reached his sixteenth
year. In 1863 he went to Edinburgh, where he completed his education. He arrived in
South Australia before he was 20 years of age, and immediately entered into articles, and
began the study of law under his cousin, Mr. J. I). Sutherland, of Mount Gambler. The


budding lawyer was not destined to remain long in the capital of the South-East. In 1868
he made the acquaintance of the present Chief Justice, then a rising junior, on the occasion of
two visits which that gentleman paid on circuit to Mount Gambier —particularly on the
second ol these, when Sir J. H. Symon, as a young law student, “devilled ” for Mr. Way, who
was leading Counsel for the Caroline farmers in the cases against the late Sir W. J. I.
Clarke. This experience of the quality of the law student led, in June, 1870, to the transfer
of his articles to Mr. Way, whose then firm was Way & Brook, and Sir Josiah took
the position of managing clerk. The senior member of this house of lawyers was already
in large practice, but it was some years later before he was raised to the Chief Justiceship
of South Australia.
Under such a congenial environment Sir ). H. Symon zealously mastered his profession
and successfully passed his examinations, which were conducted by Mr. R. I. Stow, Q.C.,
Mr. R. Ingleby, Q.C., and the Master, Mr. W. Hinde, all since dead. He was admitted to
practice at the South Australian Bar on November 21, 1871. In August, 1872, Mr. Brook
died. His place in the firm was offered to and accepted by Sir Josiah, who thus at the early
age of 26 became junior partner with Mr. Way in what was then one of the leading legal
practices in South Australia. The new firm was known as Way & Symon. It did not take the
latter long to prove himself a lawyer of learning and resource and also of forensic skill, but his
partnership with Mr. Way lasted little more than three years. In January, 1876, Sir Josiah
left to take a holiday trip to England, but in March, 1876, the late Chief Justice, Sir
Richard Hanson, died, and in the same month Mr. Wav, who was then Attorney-General,
J ■ J
became Chief Justice, and Sir Josiah had to cut his trip short at Point de Galle, and
return to Adelaide to assume, at the age of 29, the entire responsibility of the business.
He took Mr. J. V\ . Bakewell into partnership, under the style of Symon & Bakewell.
Since then other changes have taken place in the noted firm. First his brother,
William Symon, entered the partnership, and subsequent reconstructions took place, but
throughout all changes Sir J. H. Symon has remained and is now the head of this firm,
whose professional history goes back nearly 50 years.
Sir J. H. Symon had no sooner assumed the headship of the firm in succession
to Mr. Way than he was retained in many notable legal cases, and he conducted them
in such a manner as to establish his reputation as a leading member of the South Australian
Bar. The expectations of prominent lawyers of the day were fulfilled, and early in 1881 at
the age of 34 —he took silk and was gazetted Queen’s Counsel, a dignity which he had earned
in many a brilliantly fought case. Since that period Sir Josiah has been constantly increasing
his early fame, and in the Supreme Court he has not an equal in South Australia, and, if
authorities in other colonies are to be believed, he is perhaps the chief in Australia. In the
matter of seniority Sir John Downer, 0.C., is the father of the local Bar, but in forensic
skill and legal genius Sir J. H. Symon stands above the ex-Premier. His speeches before the
Court exhibit a remarkable control of attractive language, and his arguments are marshalled so
clearly as to illumine the understanding of the most unintelligent jury. Many are the
polished, witty, and brilliant speeches he has delivered on such occasions. As a
cross-examiner he has provided most interesting exhibitions of keenness and judgment.
His repartee delights the audience at court, and his ingenuity and generalship with


obstinate witnesses invariably redounds to their discomfort, and the success of his own
case. Sir Josiah has been engaged in the most celebrated cases in the annals of South
Australian jurisprudence during the past 24 years, and his greatness as a lawyer is known
in the most remote parts of the Province.
Notwithstanding the excessive demands of his large practice, Sir J. H. Symon evinces
an absorbing interest in public affairs. He served the district of Sturt in the House of
Assembly for six years. On his return in March, 1881, from a year’s holiday in America and
j j
Europe, he took office as Attorney-General in the late Sir William Morgan’s Ministry without
ever having been in Parliament; and he fought the Sturt constituency a month later for that
Ministry and won the seat, his colleague in the representation being the late Mr. William
Townsend. Upon the meeting of Parliament in June, Sir William Morgan, owing to the
position of his private affairs, found it necessary to resign office; and as neither Mr. G.
C. Hawker nor Mr. T. Playford (the senior members of the Ministry) was then prepared
to form a Ministry, all the members, including Sir josiah, resigned with their chief. He
was again returned for the Sturt at the general election of 1884. When the new
Parliament met it was the unanimous wish of the Opposition he should be its leader;
but although he declined this honor, owing to the increasing demands of his profession, he
was mainly instrumental in ejecting the Bray Ministry from office in June. It was
succeeded by the Colton Ministry, to which Sir Josiah during the session gave powerful
independent support. Very shortly after the new Ministry took office, the late Mr. Justice
Andrews died. The vacant judgeship was offered by Sir John Colton to Sir J. H. Symon, who
declined it. It was then offered to, and accepted by, Mr. (now Justice) Bundey. Sir J. H.
Symon continued in the Assembly till 1887. As a politician, he spoke his mind without
fear or favor ; and he proved a very strong support to his side in debate.
There are few subjects of legislation upon which he did not make his mark. His
influence in Parliament was potent. He specially distinguished himself in his advocacy
of free trade, the independence of the Judiciary, liberal pastoral legislation, in his opposition
to the Federal Council Bill, and in his persistent, earnest, and eloquent advocacy session
after session of the abolition of oaths in courts of justice. His speeches on some of these
subjects have been separately printed. At the general election in 1887 he paid the penalty
of being a staunch freetrader by being defeated on that ground for the district of Victoria,
in the South-East, to which he had unfortunately been induced to offer his services, instead
of remaining with the Sturt. Since then he has declined all invitations to re-offer himself
for the local Parliament. He has held many public positions in South Australia, and has
done good public service both in and out of Parliament. He was for years President of
the South Australian P'ree Trade League, and for services in that cause he was elected
an honorary member of the Cobden Club; he was President of the Federation League,
President of the Commonwealth League, a member of the University Council, and President
of the Literary Societies’ Union. He takes an active interest in the Home Reading Union,
and is President of the Home for Weak-minded Children. In the various interests of
these different bodies he has delivered eloquent speeches.
Sir Josiah Symon’s literary sympathies and gifts are widely known, and whether in the


form of lectures on literary subjects, or in contributions to the Press, his efforts are great y
appreciated. He is a devoted Shakespearian, and his love of the world’s greatest poet has
borne fruit in scholarly addresses —some of which have been published by request in the
old country. His controversial literary style is lucid and pungent, and his articles, letters,
and pamphlets on debatable topics are of great force, and give powerful effect to his side.
But he is equally successful in the calm historical style, as is evidenced by his lecent
article on “United Australia,” in the Yale Quarterly Review for August, 1900. Ihe quality
of his pen would have given him success in journalism had he followed that career.
But, apart from law and literature. Sir J. H. Symons greatest achievements-and those
of which he is himself most proud have to do with Federation. He is no doubt proud, though
out of Parliament for years, of having been elected sixth on the poll lor representatives to the
National Convention. The supremely important question of Australian Pederation has
attracted the thought of the best minds of each colony for many years. Before it could
be brought about, problems of a very difficult nature had to be solved, and the
obstacles in the way seemed insurmountable. Sir Josiah Symon, by his speeches before
the election of Convention delegates, did much to clear the way and concentrate public
interest. The Federal Conventions- that In Sydney in 1891, and that of 1897-8 with its
three sessions held in Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne—have been attended by the greatest
men of Australia; and with a rare combination of ability and wisdom they evolved
a means which has at last brought about the desired consummation. Among the delegates
from South Australia at the last Convention, Sir J. H. Symon is the acknowledged champion
of the interests of the small States. His contributions to the debates have been conspicuous
lor earnestness and brilliance, and he has been termed the most distinguished orator in this
gathering of talented speakers. One or two of his deliveries in Sydney in 1897 were
especially famous, and charmed and influenced those who were privileged to hear them.
When the history of the Federation movement comes to be written, Sir J. H. Symon will
undoubtedly hold a pre-eminent place among those sincere men who fought for national
greatness and honor. His arguments on behalf of South Australia in the negotiations
were exceedingly powerful, and have carried the desired weight; but Sir Josiah
at the same time looked beyond the provincial aspect in his earnestness to encompass the
high aspiration. He was eager for Federation, and he sought to obtain fair play to every
State which would enter it. His reputation, which was already great, has become more
widely known, and delegates from other colonies have found him a doughty warrior in
debate. For his services in this respect, South Australia and the whole continent owe a
debt of gratitude to Sir J. H. Symon. His greatness Is not that of the politician ; it aspires
to statesmanship, and the people of the Province are properly proud of their distinguished
Queen’s Counsel.
On January r, 1901, the day of the inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth,
Josiah Henry Symon was raised to the dignity of a Knight Commander of the most
distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George, receiving the hearty congratulations
of numbers of his fellow-colonists.

Mr. George Sydney Aldridge
II is difficult for the average individual in an old settled country to realise how many
parts on the stage of life a man can play in a new and undeveloped country. The
history of almost every prominent Australian shows the development of a wide
range of talent to correspond with the large scope afforded to him by his surroundings.
The man behind the counter in a
retail shop has frequently become
a leading politician, knighted or
otherwise honored by his country.
* J
Ihe young Scotchmen, from
Kirkcaldy, become merchants,
sheepfarmers, and millionaires.
The banker becomes a clergyman,
and the Methodist parson writes
of warlike deeds and bloodthirsty
fights. From clerk to shopkeeper,
farmer to politician, grocer to
sheepfarmer, sharebroker to
newspaper proprietor, bank clerk
to surgeon, peddler to artist,
bush - hand to poet from one
occupation to another of the most
diverse description, the young
Australian passes with marvellous
facility. Of such men is Mr. G. S.
Aldridge, the President of the
Stock Exchange of Adelaide.
P'irst a clerk, next an accountant;
again a surveyor in the wilds of
the Northern Territory, after that
a mining prospector, then an
auctioneer, and also a brewer, he
finally becomes a sharebroker and the head of a great institution.
Mr. Aldridge was born in London on July 23, 1847. but arrived in this Province
while still an infant. He was educated at St. Peter’s College, under the Head-Mastership
of the Rev. G. H. Parr. He not only had a successful career at the College, but gained
distinction at the competitive examinations held for the Province when the Governor, Sir
Richard Graves MacDonnell, was President of the Board of Examiners. He next filled
various positions as clerk and accountant in several mercantile houses. Throughout this
time he was a good all-round athlete, and his name is noted in the early history of
sport in South Australia. P'or instance, on the occasion of the Duke of Edinburgh’s


visit, Mr. Aldridge won the high jump and the mile race, and ran second for
the hundred yards, a very excellent performance. As a cricketer, he compiler ns
“centuries,” and he was well known as a footballer, gymnast, and boxer. On the historic
occasion, when the 50th Regiment was quartered in Adelaide, and challenged the civilians
to a football match, Mr. Aldridge and his fellow-townsmen won easily, in spite of the
rough play of the warriors, whose main object was apparently to leave their opponents
dead on the battle-field.
At 21 years of age Mr. Aldridge joined a survey party to the Northern lenitory
under Mr. G. W. Goyder. This survey was a remarkable one, the men working from
daylight to dark in a wild and dangerous country. It was during this trip that one of the
survey camps with which Mr. Aldridge was attached was attacked by a tribe of blacks
from the Adelaide River, and Messrs. Bennett and Guy were speared, the former dying
of his wounds. Three years later, when the Northern Territory mining “boom” broke out
in Adelaide, Mr. Aldridge joined Messrs. J. E. Roberts, John Servante, and Wickliffe Stow
in a prospecting expedition to the Territory. The party underwent many hardships. 'I hey
discovered and worked for twelve months the “Woolwonga Mine, which gave excellent
results: but the “boom” having collapsed in Adelaide, no capital was forthcoming, and
the mine was abandoned. Mr. Aldridge then went to the Sandy Creek Diggings, and
did very well ; but an attack of malarial fever compelled him to return to Adelaide. Lie
came back in the ill-fated Gothenburg . which was wrecked on the following trip, with the
loss of many valuable lives.
Mr. Aldridge next became an auctioneer in conjunction with his old schoolfellow,
Mr. Theodore Bruce. Subsequently Mr. R. W. E. Henning joined the firm, which had a
large and prosperous business. I hey also, in conjunction with Mr. \\ . I. 1 errers, conducted
a large brewing business at Port Augusta.
In 1888 Mr. Aldridge made his last change of occupation, becoming a member of the
Stock Exchange of Adelaide ; and on March 27, 1889, on the death of the then President, Mr.
Henry Bellingham, he was elected to the chair, and has since continued to hold that office.
There is no institution more representative of the enterprising and speculative nature
which is born in the average South Australian than the Stock Exchange ot Adelaide.
The small community of this Province Is probably the most remarkable in the world in
this direction. A mere handful of people, and in spite of the low prices and disastrous
seasons which overwhelm their own resources, they are ever ready to find immense sums
of money to exploit any likely mining field on the continent of Australia. After spending
large amounts in endeavoring to find minerals in their own territory, they were the first
to push into the Silverton and Broken Hill country. W hen silver fell, and a crash came
in all Broken Hill stocks, Adelaide suffered terribly ; and yet this small community was
the first to develop the great new fields in Western Australia. At the present time the
people of South Australia hold mining stock representing millions of pounds in value.
By their enterprise in every direction, the Stock Exchange of Adelaide has taken precedence
over the Stock Exchanges of Melbourne and Sydney, and its transactions are daily cabled
to the great English newspapers. It is, therefore, no small honor for Mr. Aldridge that
he should be the head of this remarkable institution. But ht well merits the position,
for he has not only gained respect as an honorable business man, but he is also a gentleman
of kindly and courteous disposition.

The late George Fife Angas
Ob' the men who took an active hand in founding South Australia, no one was greater
in loftiness of purpose and in actual work than George Fife Angas. His position,
enterprise, and elevated sentiments led him to join in this venture at a time when help
was most needed, and his ingenuity and courage made possible the foundation of the Province
in 1836 ; and he continued to the
year of his death its candid, liberal
friend. Apart, also, from his work
in colonisation, he was one of the
best-known philanthropists of his
time. Edwin Hodder, in the
preface to his life of George Fife
Angas, thus sums up his works :
“ He was one of the fathers and
founders of South Australia ; he
originated the South Australian
Company, and the Bank of South
Australia ; he assisted in founding
the Union Bank of Australia and
the National Provincial Bank of
England ; he fought the battle of
the slaves in Honduras and the
Mosquito Coast, and obtained an
Act of Parliament for their
emancipation ; he circumvented a
reiafninpf monarch and assisted
o O
those who were subjected to, and
helped to stay, a despotic religious
persecution; his foresight and
shrewdness won for Great Britain
the possession of New Zealand as
a colony. He realised a large for-
tune, lost it in pure philanthropy,
and, after years of poverty and distress, regained it fourfold through the reckless land purchases
of an adventurer; he established the first Sunday-school union in the North ot England,
was one of the founders of the British and Foreign Sailors’ Society and other well-known
institutions, and was, 50 years ago, one of the leading ‘philanthropists ol this country
(England).”
The name of George Fife Angas figures thus prominently in the history of
South Australia ; and his life-work was of immense importance to the Province. He
was born in St. John’s Lane, Newcastle, England, on May 1, 1789, and was descended
z


from a long line of religious men who strove zealously to weave Christian teachings into
their everyday life. He was also member of a branch of the house of the Earls of Angus,
who trace back their lineage beyond the reign of Elizabeth. His father, Caleb Angas,
of Newcastle-on-Tyne, an extensive coach manufacturer and shipowner, was, says Hodder, “ a
shrewd, intelligent, and far-seeing man, with a cool head and a warm heart.
At the agfe of six years, George was sent to an elementary school. At the age
I*ll
of 12 he lost his mother; and shortly after this sad event he entered a boarding-school at
Catterick. In 1804, when 15 years old, he was afforded the choice of a profession, his
father desiring that he should study for the Bar. But the youth preferred a commercial
career and was accordingly apprenticed to coach-building. Being careful, accurate, and
industrious, he quickly mastered the trade. While yet an apprentice he gave evidence ot
that large interest in his fellows that became a distinguished feature of his character ; and
thenceforth, during: a life full of years and works, his nature compelled him to devote
O j
himself to philanthropic and religious efforts. In 1807 he originated the Benevolent
Society of Coachmakers in Newcastle, to provide for sick members, and to promote
economy and temperance ; and the institution was eminently successful.
At the end of four years at his trade, he went to London, and, unknown,
presented himself at the office of a large manufacturer with the request for work. He was
taken on, and succeeded well. In 1809 he returned to Newcastle, and became overseer of his
father’s business. In the meantime he had become a member of the Baptist Church. On
April 8, 1812, he married Miss Rosetta French, daughter of a friend of his father who
resided at Hutton in Essex. Within a few years Mr. G. F. Angas, with his brothers, became
a partner in the parental business ; but years later the partnership was dissolved, a brother
taking over the coachbuilding manufactory, while the subject ol this memoir removed to
London and entered into business as a merchant and shipowner, under the style of G. K
Angas & Co.
Mr. Caleb Angas had established an extensive trade in importing mahogany,
dye-woods, and other products, from British Honduras. With his brother William, a man
of vast and romantic experience among the islands, who subsequently devoted himself
wholly to the cause of poor seamen, Mr. G. E. Angas resolved that everything he
undertook should be for “ the highest good of mankind.” At Honduras there continuously
occurred numerous instances of injustice and oppression in the laws and usages. The
slaves, Mr. Angas declared, were held in illegal bondage, and to improve the morality ot
the serfs and to prepare the way for great changes, he sent out agents for the firm who
were also missionaries. He chose as officers for his vessels men who were required to
zealously watch over the interests of the islanders as well as of those of the firm. But
devoted sailors and agents were not enough, and a missionary was despatched by the
Baptist Missionary Society upon his representations. He largely contributed to the
support of the missionary station, and gave free passages on his vessels to all ministers
of religion who were bent on the good work. Then he “ exerted himself to bring about
the abolition of slavery in the Mosquito Coast territory, and to obtain other desirable
advantages for the aborigines, and besides carrying on a correspondence upon the subject
37S
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Mr - GFAngas


with Colonel George Arthur, the Governor, he enlisted the co-operation of Messrs. J.
Butterworth, howell Buxton, W. \\ ilberforce, and other anti-slavery champions, until the
liberation ot the Indians was accomplished.” To bring about this desirable result meant
years of anxious work and thought, the expenditure of considerable capital, and the
forcing the hands of those in power. For several years he labored constantly on behalf
of the Serampore Mission, and it was chiefly through his efforts, and those of his brother
1 J o
\\ illiam, that the undertaking proved a success.
FI is philanthropic interests in his own country were as great as those abroad.
W bile still resident in Newcastle he had a Savings Bank established under the auspices
ot the Benevolent Society that he had previously formed, the special object of which was
to encourage provident habits in the work-people. He “very early became a Sunday-school
teacher, and was also instrumental, with other persons, in forming the Newcastle Sunday-school
I nion in 1816. So permanent was his interest in this organisation that in 1869, three
years after the celebration of its jubilee, he bore the expense of publishing a history of
the Association.” He rendered his brother William devoted assistance among the sailors of
England, and helped to found the Bethel Seamen’s Union and the British and Foreign Sailors
Society. He was for years a treasurer to the latter institution, and the whole cost of the
first year’s labors of the pioneer missionary was borne by him. But he failed in his laudable
J 1 J J
endeavors to persuade his fellow-merchants to follow his example in promoting Christianity
and civilisation through the medium of commercial, scientific, and professional agency. He
proposed the formation of a society with this object, the operations of which were to be
world-wide. But there were few who believed the scheme possible, and during the commercial
panic of 1825-6 it fell to the ground. In that crisis, in common with most other large
British merchants, he suffered heavv losses. During the year 1852, when the Reform Bill
J J v-2
agitation was exciting national interest, he was twice asked to stand for the British Parliament,
for Newcastle and Pontefract, but refused, because “the idea was repugnant to him.” A
year or two later he helped to found the National and Provincial Bank of England, was
its first Director, and advanced money to provide for the preliminary expenses. In 1890
the report of this institution showed a subscribed capital of £12,037.500, a reserve fund
of ,£1,450,000, and a profit for the current year of £515,206 14s. 6d.
In 1831 Mr. Angas turned his attention to the colonising schemes which were
o o
then being actively promoted in England. The home country was depressed and agitated,
and men were turning their eyes to other lands Edward Gibbon Wakefield had lately
propounded a new scheme of colonisation : to sell land in small lots to attract settlers, and
“to apply the purchase-money to assist further emigration.” Mr. Robert Gouger accepted
the principle, and advocated the formation of a colony in South Australia, west of the
River Murray. The reports of Captain Sturt led a good many people to support the
scheme, and a prospectus of “The South Australian Land Company” was drawn up. On
March 31, 1832, Mr. Angas received a copy of this document, and “at once intimated
his wish to take up as many shares as would qualify him to become a Director, and
offered his office in Jeffrey Square for the use of the proposed company.” He then
became a member of the Provisional Committee. He protested against a proposal to
send out paupers, and hoped that “ Bible truth should be taught unfettered and without


State aid.” He also advocated the following provisions in the proposed colony:—“ i. Ihe
exclusion of convicts. 2. The concentration of the settlers. 3- I taking out of persons
of capital and intelligence, and especially men of piety. 4. Ihe emigration of young
couples of good character. 5. Free trade, free government, and freedom in matters of
relipion.” He greatly influenced the work of the committee in drafting the charter.
o J
After two years of endeavor, a Bill was carried in the British Parliament
in 1834 providing for the administration of the proposed Province by a Board of
Colonising Commissioners, and Mr. Angas was by Sir Robert Peel s Government
appointed one of the Commissioners, Colonel Torrens, M.P., was President of the Board,
and Mr. (afterwards Sir) Rowland Hill Secretary. Ihe Act declared that the Province
could not be founded until land to the value of ,£35,000 was disposed of, and a loan of
,£20,000 had been raised. The first Board experienced difficulties and complications, and
grave wav to a second Board, of which Mr. Angas was also a member. Divers methods
O J
were adopted to raise the required ££5,000 to enable the Commissioners to establish the
Province, but all failed. It was now that Mr. Angas concentrated his energies on
attaining success. He suggested that a Joint Stock Company should be formed to
purchase the land. At first his fellow Commissioners did not agree with him in this plan ;
but eventually they came round to his view. The price of the land had been raised from
12s. per acre, the minimum prescribed in the Act. to £l, the maximum. Mr. Angas, with
two or three other gentlemen, offered to purchase the whole of the unsold land, and the
offer was accepted. The money was forthcoming on September 29, 1835. and Mr. Angas
and his supporters at once proceeded to form a company, to which the land was to be
handed over at cost price, with interest at 5 per cent. By October 15 the company
was formed, and Mr. Angas was elected Chairman of Directors. The arrangements were
completed with wonderful expedition, and the company sent the first vessel to the
Province. It “ raised a capital of £300,000. to be employed, not only in the purchase of
land, but also in forwarding settlers to the Colony, establishing whale fisheries, introducing
pastoral and agricultural pursuits, and in many other ways providing employment and
stimulating production in the new settlement.” In all this Mr. Angas was the central and
commanding figure. Artisans and producers were introduced into the new Province, and often
led the way in establishing industries. Schoolmasters were sent out under the auspices of
the South Australian School Society, of which Mr. Angas was a founder, and educational
advantages were given to the colonists, which were greatly appreciated.
In 1838 he enabled to emigrate under Pastor Ravel numerous German families who
were suffering a religious persecution in Prussia. It was thus that he helped to “stay a
religious persecution,” to use Hodder’s words. He co-operated actively with the Aborigines’
Protection Society, and in 1838 assisted the Dresden Missionary Society to despatch the
Revs. Teichelmann and Schumann to work among the natives. In the same year he
assisted Mr. John Stephens in compiling a history of South Australia, and “in refuting
certain calumnies which had been published respecting the Colony.” He encouraged
persons to emigrate by disseminating information concerning the resources of South
Australia, delivered lectures through England on the subject, and bore the greater part of
the expense of publishing newspapers advocating South Australian interests.


W hen the Government of the Province was rendered bankrupt in 1840-1, by the
decision of the Colonising Commissioners and of the Colonial Office to dishonor bills drawn by
Governor Gawler, he was the first to advocate the cause of the colonists, and was one of the
witnesses examined by the Select Committee of Inquiry. His “evidence as to the progress
and resources of the Province strongly favored the view that its financial success under
proper management was only a question of time,” and he assisted to dispose the
Committee to “ recommend the measures of relief, the adoption of which started the
Province upon the career of prosperity it has ever since, with but slight deviations,
pursued.” He induced the South Australian Company to establish the Bank of South
Australia, which was founded in 1837 by Mr. Edward Stephens. In the same year “he
was principally instrumental in founding the Union Bank of Australia, which came into
existence through the Tamar Bank of Tasmania being placed on the London market for
sale with a view to the extension of its operations.” He succeeded in getting several
capitalists to join him in forming an independent company, and was appointed the first
Chairman of Directors.
Mr. Angas was so fully seized with the subject of colonisation that, even during
his unequalled services to South Australia at this period, he found time to assist in the
foundation of another colony, which is now not the least of the gems in the British Crown.
Early in the present century white people opened fisheries in New Zealand, and gradually
their numbers increased and a missionary station was established in the Bay of Islands. A
j *
British Consul or Resident Magistrate had for years been stationed there, and in 1837
several gentlemen, some of whom had taken part in the colonisation of South Australia,
formed “ The New r Zealand Association,” the objects of which were to establish a colony
on the island. The colonising scheme failed, and there was the likelihood that New Zealand
would fall into the hands of the French. Mr. Angas received a visit from two gentlemen,
one of whom was Baron de Thierry, a Frenchman, who casually informed him “that the
Prench Government was actually engaged in fitting out an expedition for planting a Prench
colony in New Zealand.” Such intelligence was supremely important; and to secure for England
such valuable islands in the neighborhood of Australia it was necessary that immediate
steps should be taken. Mr. Angas at once wrote to Lord Glenelg, the then Secretary
of State for the Colonies, declaring that the British possession of New Zealand was
“ intimately connected ” with “ the peace and safety of Her Majesty s Australian Colonies,
and strenuously advising that the islands should be taken over by the Imperial Government
before France obtained a footing. A few days later, at the request of Lord Glenelg,
Mr. Angas had an interview with that gentleman, and proposed several points tor his
consideration, which in effect advised that New Zealand should be claimed as belonging to
Great Britain, that a charter should be given to merchants, and that every encouragement
should be afforded missionary societies to work among the natives. Alter slight delay
and further representation on the part of Mr. Angas, Captain Hobson was dispatched in
H.M.S. Druid “to enter into a treaty with the native chiefs for the cession of the islands
to Great Britain.” The negotiations were concluded on August 10, 1840, when the raising
of the royal standard at Akaroa completed the annexation of the group. “Pive days
later,” says one biographer, “the P'rench frigate LAube, followed by the Comic de Pans,
arrived in the port, only to find that they had been forestalled in then plans. Ihe


designs ol the French Government were thus checkmated by the energy of Mr. Angas,
who, in consideration of his services, was offered a knighthood and then a baronetcy, each
of which he at once declined. One further instance of his activity in colonisation is afforded
by his accepting, in 1840, the position of Director of the North American Colonial Association
of Ireland.
Even as early as 1838, Mr. Angas and members of his family were inclined to take
up their residence in South Australia, but the time was not yet. During the land boom
of 1839-40. Mr. Flaxman, an agent for Mr. Angas in the Province, made erratic and
unauthorised purchases of large areas of land on the Rhine and Gawler Rivers. To find
the money to meet the drafts that were drawn upon him was a serious difficulty, and the
action of Mr. Flaxman imperilled the financial position of Mr. Angas. In April. 1843,
Mr. J. H. Angas, a son, sailed for South Australia in the barque Madras , to look after
the affairs of his father, and to “ examine and develop the large tract of country purchased
by Mr. Flaxman, and undertake such measures as would tend to retrieve the fallen fortunes
of the family.” This work he performed to the credit both of his father and of himself.
Another son, George French Angas, who had chosen art for his life-work, proceeded to the
Antipodes in the same year, returning in 1846 with many sketches and curios which he had
the honor of showing to Her Majesty and the Prince Consort. In that year the father
suffered heavy losses, but in 1848 a better era began to dawn. Just previous to this, Mr.
G. F. Angas began to look with confidence to removing from England to take up his
residence in South Australia ; and as his affairs got brighter, he disposed of his English
interests, and on October 3, 1850, in the ship Ascendant , left for the Province with Mrs.
Angas and his youngest son. In January, 1851, he first set foot in the Province for which
he had labored so long and so well. For several years in England he had been using
his influence to obtain a liberalised Constitution for South Australia ; and it was singularly
appropriate that the vessel in which he arrived should have on board the official copy of
the Constitution Act which awarded a modified system of representative government
to the Province.
Of his subsequent connection with South Australia, the South Australian Register
of May 24, 1879, in its biographical notice published some days after his death, says: —
“A few days after he had landed, Mr. Angas was entertained at a public dinner, at which
cordial acknowledgment was made by the Chairman (the late Sir J. H. Fisher) and other
prominent colonists of the services he had rendered to the Province. At this time Mr.
Angas had reached the age when men usually prefer a quiet life, but his active disposition
forbade his withdrawal from public duties. His entrance upon political life occurred in
August, 1851, when, at the request of the electors of Barossa, he offered himself as a
candidate for election to the Legislative Council, and had the honor of being returned
unopposed. One of his earliest votes was against the continuance of the State grant in
aid of religion, which was finally abolished by the votes of 13 out of the 16 representative
members. Four years later he contested the same district against Captain Rodda, whom
he defeated by a majority of 257 votes, and was thus one of those who assisted in
framing our present Constitution Act. In the warm contest in the Council between the
advocates of a nominee and an elective Upper House, he strongly supported the latter,
although his views were not nearly so democratic as those of some of his colleagues. In 1857


he entered the first Parliament under the new Constitution, as a member of the Upper
House, and was allowed to retain his seat on leave when, during the two following years, he
was absent on a visit to Europe. He took an active part in the proceedings of the
Council, where his speeches were marked by a plain, businesslike character, which, combined
with clearness of statement, gave them considerable weight with his brother members. In
the long and painful discussion connected with the administration of the Supreme Court,
Mr. Angas was one of the small minority who took the unpopular side ; and his speeches
in defence of Mr. Justice Boothby showed great tact as well as vigor. An instance of
his shrewdness and foresight is afforded by his speeches on the original Bill for colonising
the Northern Territory. He opposed the measure as being beyond the capacity of the
colony at that time, and pointed out that selling the land without making any provision
for the introduction of labor would not lead to the settlement of the country. He urged
instead that large inducements should be offered to squatters to take up the land, and
that a company should be encouraged to attempt the growth of tropical products. Mr. Angas
retired by rotation in 1865, and was immediately re-elected; but in the following year
ill-health compelled him to close his Parliamentary career of 15 years by resignation. A
few days after his resignation was received, the Hon. J. Baker took an opportunity
of referring to that and other vacancies in the Council which had recently occur red. 1 n
<-5 *
the course of his speech Mr. Baker said : Mr. Angas, in consequence of his early connection
with the colony, his position in society, his experience, his knowledge of mercantile affairs,
and everything connected with colonisation, was eminently entitled to their gratitude, and
j y o
he ought not to be allowed to retire into private life without some recognition ot his services.'
Several members of the Council, including the late Hon. Sir Henry Ayers, Captain
Bagot, Mr. Magarey, and others, also bore warm testimony to the valuable services Mr.
Angas had rendered to the Province.
Other references to his political efforts might be made, but it can be understood
that Mr. Angas did not give even half of his time to these matters. He was essentially a
philanthropic man, and as his land investments under good management proved remunerative,
he constantly added to the debts ot gratitude which the Province already owed him. A
portion of his income was systematically devoted to charitable purposes, and he assisted
in the erection of churches throughout the Province. He was a generous contributor to
Bible, missionary, and all kindred societies, not only in South Australia, but in other
parts of the world, and he also gave considerable sums towards the building of schools,
while such institutions as the Bushman’s Club and the Sailors’ Home found in him a
munificent helper. In addition his private benefactions were extensive.
On May 15, 1879, this empire builder, princely colonist, and faithful Christian
died at his residence, Lindsay House, Angaston, S.A., at the advanced age of go years.
George Fife Angas must ever be credited with having been the Father, Founder, and
Faithful Friend of South Australia.

Mr. John Howard Angas
FOR well over half a century John Howard Angas has been usefully engaged in
reclaiming and developing the waste places of South Australia. No colonist alive
to-day possesses a finer record, and none has more beneficially affected local
pastoral interests. Districts have been settled and townships established through his
enterprise and judgment; philan-
thropic institutions have gained
largely by his munificence;
education and religion have been
greatly assisted by his support ;
and many obscure individuals have
had reason to bless his name.
Throughout his extended sojourn in
the Province he has well and faith-
fully carried on the work begun by
J O J
his father.
Mr. J. 11. Angas was the
second son of Mr. George Fife
Angas, the subject of the
immediately preceding memoir.
He was born at Newcastle-on-
Tyne, on October 5, 1823, so
that he was just entering his
teens when his parent was labor-
ing so zealously to found this
O J
Province. While the son was
pursuing his education in the
h omel an d , the father was
entering more and more largely
o J
into the concerns of the distant
Province; but it was not then
determined that the former should
emigrate to the new country. As has been related in the sketch of the parent’s
biography, during the land boom in Governor Gawler’s administration, an agent of Mr.
G. P. Angas recklessly purchased in the name of Mr. Angas, but without his authority,
large tracts of country in the Barossa District, and drew on Mr. G. F. Angas for the
money. 1 hese drafts the latter had great difficulty in meeting, owing to large financial
losses and to engagements which at that period were harassing him. Possessed of the
land, against his will, Mr. Angas, sen., considered that the next best thing was to develop
it; and as he had lost confidence in some of his agents in the Province, he decided to
send his son out to look after his interests there. On this point the following extract,


taken from Edwin Modeler’s “Life of George Fife Angas,” is interesting: —“The first
word he ever spoke to his son, Mr. J. H. Angas, with regard to his going to South
Australia, was in 1841, when he said, somewhat abruptly, ‘ I wish you to go to South
Australia!’ John replied, ‘I am quite willing; when do you want me to go?' ‘As soon
as you can get ready.’ ‘What am I to do when I get there?’ asked the son. ‘You
must do what you see requires to be done,’ was the laconic reply. ‘ Had he written a
book of instructions,’ said his son many years afterwards, ‘he could not have given fuller
J J 1 <->
or more detailed information than the single sentence which comprised the whole.’
‘Before you start,’ Mr. Angas added, ‘you must make yourself acquainted with the
German language, in order that you may look after the 700 German immigrants by
settling them upon my lands and collecting the advances which I made for their passage
money ; and you must spend six months in studying land surveying, mapping, and so
forth.’’’ At this time Mr. J. H. Angas was only 18 years old; but he pursued his
preparatory studies with avidity, and showed by his shrewdness, firmness, and judgment,
that he was worthy of his father’s confidence. The elder Mr. Angas, as previously stated
in this volume, had, in obedience to his philanthropic nature, helped numbers ot Germans,
victims of religious persecution, to emigrate from the Fatherland to South Australia, and
these he intended his son to settle on the land.
On April 15, 1843, when 19 years of age, Mr. John Howard Angas left England,
after receiving an affectionate letter of recommendation as to character and conduct from
his father. He arrived in the Province in the Madras , in September of the same year,
having remained three weeks in Western Australia. His mission was an important one
for so young a man. Shortly put, he “ was commissioned to look after the affairs of his
father in the new colony, to examine and develop the large tract of country purchased
by Mr. Flax man (his father’s agent), and to undertake such measures as would tend to
retrieve the fallen fortunes of the family.” The affairs of Mr. G. h. Angas, as well as
those of the Province, were in “hopeless confusion,” and a great deal depended on the
son’s efforts. The estate consisted of seven special surveys of 4,000 acres each in the
Barossa Range, then sometimes called “ New Silesia. ’
“ The Barossa Range,” says Hodder, “ is situated about 40 English miles to
the north-east of Adelaide, and comprises some miles of the best land in South Australia.
It is watered partly by the Gawler, and partly by the North and South Rhine Rivers, with
splendid ‘parks’ and valleys between picturesque ranges of hills. Ihe soil is fertile, light,
and easy to be worked ; there are considerable tracts of pasture land for sheep and cattle,
and it retains a large body of fresh water all the year round. Ihe district abounds in
useful materials, such as large timber trees, gum, wattle bark, asbestos, marble, iron, limestone,
granite, and building stone.” In the most fertile portions of this country Angas Park and
Salem Valley were situated, amid types of the prettiest scenery in South Australia. len
thousand acres of this land had been surveyed into 80-acre sections, and offered for sale
or lease, with or without the right of pre-emption, on moderate terms. 1 here was a "poor
response,” and it remained with Mr. J. FI. Angas to “set matters right.
Immediately after his arrival, the young man made a careful study of local conditions
J j
and of the exact state of his father’s property, and then embarked on his mission of


improvement. Caution blended with enterprise was soon productive of satisfactory results,
and nowhere in the Province were greater changes made than at Barossa. Ihe town of
o o
Angaston was established under his supervision, and other thriving settlements sprang up
in the vicinity. The German “immigrants assisted to the colony by Mr. G. P. Angas
were grouped in townships,” the chief of which were Klemzig, Bethany, Langmeil, I anunda,
Lobethal, and Hahndorf all at this day flourishing settlements. len years later, under
the management of Mr. Angas, “the wilderness had been made to blossom as the rose,
O O’
order had been evolved out of chaos, and the lands acquired under such peculiar circumstances,
and the cause of years of privation and anxiety, gave promise of yielding to their possessor
a more than ample fortune. ’ Prom the beginning Mr. J. Id. Angas took a place among
the most important pastoralists and landed proprietors in South Australia, and he has
since led the wav that has been followed by other settlers in the country parts. He put
J J
his whole energies into the work, and the estates gradually improved in development, in
wealth, and importance. From time to time they were enlarged, until the territory under
his control was larger than that of most of the old feudal lords of Europe. Por practically
57 years now, Mr. Angas has been constantly engaged in this developmental work. So
vigorous have been the demands upon his time in managing his large interests that, after
a hard day’s work, he has been known to ride on horseback at night from Angaston to
Adelaide, and, after a day in town, ride back again—a distance of nearly 50 miles each
way —and to resume work on the following morning. To bear such severe strains requires
an iron constitution and an iron will. Year in, with year out, Mr. Angas is probably the
busiest man in the Province. In 1854 he proceeded to England, and in the following
year was married to Miss Susanne Collins, of Bowdon, near Manchester. They have a
son and daughter, both of whom are married and settled in South Australia.
Released from the management of his father’s property, Mr. Angas became a
breeder of stud cattle and sheep, and his prize stock are not only unsurpassed in South
Australia, but famous throughout the continent. Quite earlv in his colonial career he
purchased high-class shorthorn cattle and merino sheep from the South Australian Company.
He thus formed the nucleus of splendid flocks and herds, and by expensive importations
from Great Britain and elsewhere, eventually obtained the finest cattle in Australia— as
attested by the prizes he has won at Royal Shows held in Melbourne, Sydney, and
Adelaide. He has paid more than a £ 1,000 for a single sheep for stud purposes, and, by
this wise expenditure, produced a strain almost as celebrated in their class as his cattle.
The business increased as his herds and flocks became larger. The pastures of Barossa
were insufficient for his stock, and after inspecting country about 200 miles north of
Adelaide, near Mount Remarkable, he established a cattle station there. Of this pioneer
station many stirring stories are told by old bushmen of cattle musterine, kangaroo hunts,
J oJo ’ o *
phenomenal riding prowess, encounters with aborigines, and of reckless characters who
from time to time sojourned there. The Mount Remarkable pastures were eminentlv
suited to fattening cattle, and many thousands of fat stock were sent thence to the
Adelaide market. Even this stretch of country was soon found too small, and Mr.
Angas formed stations at Arrowie and Wirrialpa, and stocked them from the large herds
at Mount Remarkable and Collingrove, the homestead near Angaston. With a fair rainfall


the production of grass on these areas was satisfactory; and although he experienced
severe droughts and other drawbacks, Mr. Angas made his new acquisitions profitable. As
the population pressed further afield, the Government resumed considerable tracts of land
hitherto used tor pastoral purposes, and surveyed them into blocks for agriculturists. Mr.
Angas was consequently compelled to purchase a large area near Mount Remarkable to
secure his holding; and this he stocked with high-class merino sheep, moving the cattle
to still more remote country. For the latter purpose several thousand square miles were
leased from the Crown at Stuarts Creek and Mount Hamilton in the Far North. At a
more recent date Mr. Angas purchased from Mr. C. B. Fisher the celebrated Hill River
Estate lying a few miles north, east, and south-east of Clare. This runs for many miles
j Co ' j
along a beautiful valley following the course of the river, and is bounded on either side
by a high range of hills. The coach road leading from the railway station at Farrell’s
Flat to Clare runs through this property, and at considerable expense Mr. Angas has made
it one of the most beautiful drives in Australia. Broad avenues of various kinds of
ornamental trees have been planted on both sides of the road for a distance of about five
miles, and these terminate in a pine clad range near the head station, two and a half
miles from Clare. The slopes upon which the house and station buildings are situated are
adorned with extensive shrubberies, orchards, orangeries, and vineyards; and no more
charming Australian home could be found. Here and there, scattered over about 60,000
acres of good soil, blocks of from five to 25 acres have been planted with forest trees.
This and the Collingrove Estate are among the finest in Australia. The Hill River
Station carries a large number of highl ) -bred merino sheep (including a stud flock, numbering
about 5,000), and a herd of pedigree shorthorn cattle. Other properties are owned by
Mr. Angas in the Roseworthy District, the home of his Hereford stock, and at Point
Sturt, near the Murray Mouth, where the imported shorthorns are kept. In connection
with his cattle-breeding operations, Mr. Angas established large dairies on the co-operative
system, and had at one time as many as 500 milking cows, “ the progeny of which, from
imported and pure pedigree shorthorn cattle, were carefully reared and transferred to the
northern runs, thus not only improving their breeding, but making the cattle remarkably
quiet and docile.” Some years ago his Mount Remarkable and other northern properties
were merged into what was known as the Willowie Land and Pastoral Association. Mr.
O
Angas recently became a large shareholder in this Company, and was appointed Chairman
of the Board of Directors. At the present time he is considered one of the foremost
breeders of stud stock in the Australian colonies. The numbers and varieties of his
high-class pedigree animals imported from the old country are too numerous to mention.
Not only Shorthorn and Hereford cattle, but Clydesdale Thoroughbreds and Carriage horses,
Merino and Lincoln sheep and Berkshire pigs (also dogs and poultry) have been successfully
introduced by him and bred with excellent results. For upwards of a quarter of century
he has been a very large and successful exhibitor of live stock at the Royal Shows in
all the Australian colonies. The list of the prizes he has taken at these meetings would fill
a volume. Mr. Angas has also engaged extensively in agriculture, at one time having several
thousands of acres under crop. He has taken the leading champion prizes for wheat and other
cereals at the Royal Shows in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide, and was the first, after
seven years’ keen competition, to carry off the 50-guinea challenge cup, open to all Australia.


for the best too bushels of wheat. The conditions were that the exhibitor must for three
years win the champion prize lor the best too bushels of wheat, each of a different seasons
growth.
Mr. Angas is a life member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, the
Shorthorn Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Hereford Herd-Book Society,
and of the New South Wales, Victorian, and South Australian Royal Agricultural Societies.
He is also a life member of the Royal Colonial Institute in London.
Mr. Angas has had a creditable Parliamentary career. Though he has not been
in the arena so long as many other old colonists, he has yet very materially influenced
legislation. He represented the District of Barossa in the House of Assembly foi five
years (1871-5), and was returned at the head of the poll on two occasions. He entered
the Legislative Council in 1886, and represented the City and Central District until a
year or two ago. Although asked to stand again for the same electorate, he declined the honor.
By his great experience in local affairs, his mature judgment, and commercial ability, he
was able to largely influence political measures that were submitted to the consideration
of the Council.
His industrial and political activities form only two sides of the character of Mr.
h H. Angas. Pie has been the excellent son of an excellent father; and whether in his
grasp of essentials in commercial affairs, or in that more beautiful side which leans to
philanthropy, he has followed closely in the [internal footsteps. He is one of the most
charitably-inclined men in South Australia. Monuments of his liberality exist in the
metropolis which are as creditable to him as they are advantageous to the people. In
1878 he founded the Angas Engineering Scholarship at the Adelaide University, and in
1884 gave ,£6,000 as an endowment for a Chair of Chemistry in connection with that
institution. He founded the Angas Engineering Exhibition as well. Mr. Angas was one
of the inaugurators of the Bushmen’s Club, and assisted it liberally with donations. He
also took an interest in, and was one of the committee of, the Sailors’ Home at Port
Adelaide. The Angas Buildings at the Children’s Hospital in Poole Street, North Adelaide,
were erected at his cost, and he also built a wing to the Home for Incurables and an addition
to the Semaphore Convalescent Hospital. Mr. Angas largely assisted in establishing the
Hope Lodge, the Inebriates’ Retreat, and Missionary Training Homes at Belair ; the Angas
College, Jeffcott Street, North Adelaide; and the Young Men's Christian Association in
Adelaide. He continues to pay the expenses of the missionary in connection with the
Hindmarsh and Bowden Town Mission founded by his father, and has been a large
contributor to Dr. Barnardo’s Homes and other charitable and industrial institutions for a
quarter of a century. The London Missionary Society, China Inland Mission, Zambesi
Industrial Mission, and various centres of missionary and school enterprise in India and
Syria have his liberal support. He is President of the British and P'oreign Sailors’ Society,
Vice-President of the British and P'oreign Bible Society in England, and President of
the South Australian Auxiliary. In short, he is connected with nearly all the local benevolent
and charitable institutions; while it is said of him that no one knows the extent of his
private charities. Reckoning all things up together, it may truly be said that South
Australia does not possess a more influential and useful colonist than John Howard Angas.

Mr. W. P Auld
PHE few score sturdy, courageous explorers who at one time and another sought to
I penetrate the arid interior of Australia arc now nearly all swallowed up in death,
but the records of their hardy exploits will live as long as the annals of the colonies
last. Among those who will thus live in the history of South Australia is William Patrick
O J
Auld, who was born in England
in 1840. Shortly afterwards his
father, the late Mr. Patrick Auld,
decided to come to Australia, and
he arrived in Adelaide in 1841, his
family following a year later. Mr.
J O J
Auld, sen., established himself in
Hindley Street as a wine and
spirit merchant. He sold his
business in 1849 to Messrs. Disher
and Milne (afterwards Sir William
Milne). At this juncture he re-
turned to England with his family,
and remained there until 1852, in
which year he again came to South
Australia, leaving his wife and
three children, among whom was
Mr. W. P. Auld, in the old
country, specially to secure a good
education for the latter. In 1842
Mr. P. Auld had purchased, at £ 1
per acre, about 230 acres of land
near Adelaide from the Govern-
ment. He afterwards erected a
residence at this place. In 1847
he planted a few vines here, and
upon his return to South Australia
decided to devote himself to viti-
culture. He laid out the now celebrated Auldana \ ineyards in port-wine pi apes, but soon
discovered that these were unsuited to the heat ot the climate. His wines were popular
from the beginning. In 1858 he opened an office m Hilbert 1 lace lot the pin chase ot
South Australian wines, and conducted a substantial local business. He also had an
extensive connection with Melbourne, until the duty of 6s. pet pal lon killed the, tiade.
He subsequently established extensive cellars at the locality now occupied by the I nion
Bank buildings. Through his instrumentality. South Australian vignerons sent samples
of local wines to the London Exhibition of 1863, where they attracted some attention and
received first-class honors. In 1871 Mr. Ik Auld went home and opened a business in


Mill Street, Hanover Square, London, to which his son shipped over 150,000 gallons of
Auldana wine, a sample made from Frontignac selling in one line for 80s. a gallon. By
this venture Mr. Auld pioneered the sale of South Australian wines on the Eng is
market. After a busy life, and one of considerable importance and value to South Australia,
he died on January 21, 1886.
Mr. W. P. Auld studied at King’s College, London, where he remained for four
vears. In 1853 he returned to this Province, and completed his school career at the
educational establishment of Mr. J. L. Young. Adelaide. Mr. Auld entered as a cadet in the
office of the late Mr. G. W. Goyder, C.M.G.. who was for many years honorably known
as the Surveyor-General of South Australia. He was associated with survey work for
two years, and then joined the expedition of J. McDouall Stuart, which succeeded m
traversing the continent from south to north. Twice before had Stuart gone into the
interior, and twice had he to return to Adelaide, defeated in his effort to cross from shore
to shore. On the first occasion, when two-thirds of the way over, he was driven back
by natives; on the second, he reached lat. 17°, where he was stopped by desolate
expanses of scrub. In his successful expedition, besides Mr. Auld, he was accompanied
b y Wm. Kekwick, F. W. Timing, F. G. Waterhouse (naturalist), Stephen King, John
Billiat, James Frew, Herth Nash, and John McGorgery. These were the men who
performed the great feat which had for many years excited and daunted Australian explorers.
On November 7, 1861, the party left the settled districts of South Australia ; m April, 1862,
Stuart reached the northern limit of his previous expedition ; and on July 24, he and his
brave men stood on the beach of Van Diemen Gulf, and looked out over the waters
of the Indian Ocean. The dreary tracts separating the south from the north were marked
by their footprints. We are told that before going forth. Stuart promised Governor
Mac Donnell to dip his feet and wash his hands in the Indian Ocean before he returned
to Adelaide, and to hoist the Union Jack on the northern strand. He fulfilled his
promise with the aid of his companions. Numerous features of the country weie named
by the party which accomplished the difficult journey, at the expense of considerable
suffering and great hardships. To this day Mr. Auld possesses interesting relics of the
party, such as'Stuart’s MS. and the beautifully written diary of the explorer. Mr. Auld
was next a member of the expedition which founded settlement in the Northern
Territory, and is therefore in a double sense a pioneer of that remote part of the
South Australian Province. In 1864, the Hon. B. T. Finmss was appointed first
Government Resident of the Northern Territory, and, accompanied by a numerous party,
proceeded to Adam Bay, and selected a site for the northern capital at the mouth of the
Adelaide River. A few years later this locality was abandoned as unsuited, and Port
Darwin was chosen in its place. This was the concluding effort of Mr. Auld in pioneer
exploration. As a member of the distinguished Stuart band of explorers, his name will
be remembered for his creditable assistance In a great work. It was only by the help
of each hardy member of these parties that the early long journeys were made.
In 1886 Mr. Auld turned his attention to quieter pursuits. He joined his father
in business, and since that time has been associated with the history and expansion of
South Australian wine-making. When the father went home to establish the London
branch, the son, as already mentioned, looked after the local business. Spent in such a
416
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Mr. w. p. Au ld


manner, his life has since been of a less exciting tenor. After the early struggles to secure
<*> J o o
a good class of wine, the proprietors of the vineyard had every reason to be satisfied
with their production. They obtained a ready market for it, and won prizes in wine in
quarters where a. high standard of excellence is required, such as at Paris, Vienna, and
Bordeaux. The Auldana wines have taken numerous prizes, also, in Australian
competitions. In recent years Mr. Auld has relinquished the vineyard, and with his sons,
Messrs. W. G. and E. P. Auld, under the name of W. P. Auld & Sons, purchases
the product of various South Australian vineyards, and prepares it for the market.
Mr. Auld was for many years a member of the Burnside District Council, and
J J
in 1896 was elected President of the South Australian branch of the Australian Vignerons’
Association, having previously been President of the Adelaide branch. His son, Mr. \\ .
G. Auld. is also a Past-President of the society. For manv years Mr. Auld was on the
- j J
committee of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society, for which he has acted as
j <"> J
Judge at nearly all the shows. He is regarded as a prominent wine expert, and in 1888
was selected by the local Government to adjudicate on South Australian wines at the
Melbourne Exhibition. He has had an extended association with the Adelaide Hunt
Club, and has also been identified with amateur theatricals for charitable purposes.
Mr. William Barlow, LL.D.
IN the history of the University of Adelaide the name of Dr. Barlow will ever find a
prominent and honored place. He was born at Dublin, Ireland, in 1834, and was
a son of Mr. Peter Barlow, a learned Queen’s Counsellor, practising at the Irish
Bar. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1850. He had a bright career at
the University, even among the many brilliant scholars of his own country. In November,
J’O J J
1854, he took a senior moderatorship in Ethics and Logic, and passed for the B.A. degree,
which was duly conferred upon him on Shrove Tuesday in 1855. He took the LL.D.
degree in 1884. While at the University he gained some distinction in oratory. He
entered the Trinity College Historical Society, and in 1856 became Auditor, or chief
executive officer, and obtained the gold medal for oratory. Dr. Barlow was called to the
Irish Bar in Hilary Term, 1858, and thenceforward lor some years practised his profession
in his native island. In 1870 he chose South Australia as a suitable field for his energy
and learning. He was admitted to the South Australian Bar in that year, and practised
alone until 1873, when he joined Sir Richard Baker (now K.C.M.G. and President of
the Legislative Council) in partnership. Dr. Barlow has not confined himself wholly to
law. His principal public services have been conferred on the University. The University
was established in 1874, and in December of the same year he was elected Registrar- an
office which he filled until 1882, acting also for some time as Clerk of the Senate. When
he relinquished the Registrarship, Dr. Barlow was elected to the Council, of which he
remains a member. Upon the death of Mr. Hartley, the talented Inspector-General of
Schools and father of the present excellent State education system of South Australia,
Dr. Barlow, in 1896, was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University. He continues in
that dignified office. He has been for years a prominent member of the Church of
England, and is Chancellor of the Diocese of Adelaide and member of the Synod and
o
Standing Committee.

Mr. Thomas Barnfield
THE subject of this memoir, Mr. Thomas Barnfield, spent many a toilsome day on
the plains of the wilderness in the search for gold before he reaped the ripe reward
of his energy and well-directed efforts in that absorbing but so often delusive pursuit.
Mr. Barnfield was born in England in 1842. When he was a mere lad his father sailed
for Victoria, taking young 1 homas
with him. After receiving his
education in Melbourne, he, as a
youth, proceeded to the goldfields
of Ballarat, and there received his
first introduction to the sphere in
which he was destined to move
thenceforward. Mr. Barnfield
came to Adelaide in 1873, in
which city he has remained ever
since, and started as a mining
financier. He soon became a
prominent investor and specu-
lator, and his name was
associated with some considerable
ventures. Having travelled over
most of the goldfields of New
South Wales, Victoria, and South
Australia, he had gained a fair
acquaintance with their respective
prospects, and this practical know-
ledge of mining in all its branches
was, of course, of great service
to him in his operations. One
achievement in particular did
much to place him in the front
rank of mining financiers. The
Baker’s Creek Mine at Hillgrove,
New South Wales, was put in his hands, and he made a successful flotation of
the concern. Up to the present, dividends to the large amount of a quarter of a
million have been paid by the Baker’s Creek Gold Mining Company, without a single
call having been made. Consequent on the success which attended his financial exertions
in this direction, he next took in hand the Eleanora Mine, which is also situated at
Hillgrove. The company was floated in Adelaide; and this property has since been
developed into a valuable and remunerative concern. Mr. Barnfield’s performances in
connection w r ith these mines were productive of a flow of mining business in his direction.
Positions in the directorates of various companies were placed at his disposal, and in the


course of a few years he became a member of several boards controlling important industrial
enterprises. He has been Chairman of the Adelaide Ice Company for 20 years, and is
also Chairman of the 1 hebarton Distillery ; while he has always been a moving spirit in
mining development, both as a promoter and an investor.
In the sporting circles of South Australia there is no man better known than
Mr. Barnfield, his figure being familiar on the principal racecourses of the Province. HE
services have been utilised in the Adelaide Racing Club as a member of the committee
and a steward for several years. He was formerly the owner of several fine racehorses,
which acquitted themselves gallantly. In 1882, when Assyrian won the Melbourne Cup,
Mr. Barnfield benefited largely. For the race of 1883 he speculated to an enormous extent
on the chances of First Water; and, had this horse won, he would have profited to the
amount of one of the greatest pools in Australian racing annals. Unfortunately
for him. First Water ran second to the Hon. f. White’s Martini-Henry.
Mr. Barnfield became a member of the Adelaide City Council in December,
1898, being returned by a substantial majority as a representative of MacDonnell Ward,
but he was defeated when seeking re-election in December, 1900. His term of civic
office was marked by the advocacy of a sound policy in regard to the municipal affairs of
the capital. He is still a leading figure in financial circles.
Mr. Theodore Bruce
MR. THEODORE BRUCE, one of the best known business men in Adelaide, was
born in Leeds, Yorkshire, in 1847, and came out to Australia with his parents
in 1852. His father was a large woollen manufacturer in that prosperous and
busy city, while his grandfather, Mr. Edward Baines, was the founder of the well-known
and influential daily journal, the Leeds Mercury. On Mr. Bruce’s arrival as a boy in South
Australia he was sent to Mr. j. L. Young’s school, and afterwards to St. Peter’s College. On
leavino- school, he engaged for a time in station life, but left it for the sake of gaining
commercial experience. He entered the National Bank in Adelaide, where he devoted
himself with all zeal and diligence to the acquisition of financial knowledge and experience.
In 1878, in company with Mr. George Aldridge, Chairman of the Stock Exchange, Mr.
Bruce started an auctioneering business. In 1870, the partnership was dissolved, and
Mr. Bruce, in conjunction with other commercial enterprises, started a brewing establishment
at Broken Hill. As a member of the Stock Exchange of Adelaide, and as an auctioneer
in the South Australian capital, Mr. Bruce has long pursued a successful career. Attention
to private business has not, however, prevented him from taking an active part in public
matters. He was elected Mayor of Unley in 1897, and occupied the unique position of
being at the same time a councillor in the Adelaide Corporation. In December, 1900, he
was elected as Alderman for the City Corporation. Mr. Bruce is a Progressionist, and
never fails to urge the adoption of advanced principles wherever desirable and practicable.
Besides being respected as a business man. Mr. Bruce is highly esteemed by all classes
in and about Adelaide for his geniality and kindheartedness.

The late Mr. David Bower
THE memoirs of veterans of Australia contain the account of many incidents of other
days the like of which can hardly be repeated. With the advance of settlement
and the inevitable extinction of the aborigines, romance and adventure largely
disappear, and Australian life sounds a more prosaic note. Although the days of exciting
experiences in sequestered parts of
the bush are not altogether gone,
o o
they do not compare in vivifying
interest with those of 50 and 60
years ago.
With such reflections that
respected veteran, the late Mr. David
Bower, was possessed in his latter
years. In his time he roamed through
lonely country which to-day is adorned
with haystacks, and barns and town-
ships. David Bower, gazetted a
Justice of the Peace many years ao-o,
J J O
was born at Upper Mill, in the Parish
of Saddle worth, in the W r est Riding
of Yorkshire, on April 11, 1819. He
was the eldest son of a family of
seven children, and, when 22 years old,
left England for Australia, landing at
Port Phillip, Victoria, in July, 1841.
1 he territory at present embraced in
the Colony of Victoria was then little
known, and only the fringes of the
J <■»
more accessible districts were in-
habited. Ihe few colonists who had
already taken up their residence there
were not particularly prosperous, and
seeing little chance of a prosperous career in that part, Mr. Bower left Victoria
and went to New Zealand towards the end of 1841. He remained in Maoriland
until 1846, garnering the while a rich store of experiences. For some time
he traded with the Maoris in the North Island. Mr. Bower traded with a ship
which he built himself on the Waikato River, and, notwithstanding trading risks and
bodily dangers, his operations proved remunerative.
In 1846 he set sail for Sydney, and, landing in New South Wales, travelled
all over that Colony. He then decided to seek his fortune in South Australia, and
arrived at Port Adelaide in December, 1846. In that growing seaport he established


himself as a timber merchant, and quickly obtained a large connection. Almost from the first
he interested himself in the welfare of Port Adelaide, and subsequently he turned his attention
to the politics of the Province. In 1855 the people of that seaport agitated for a corporate
municipality, and Mr. Bower was one of a deputation which urged the demand upon
the Governor. Sir Richard MacDonnell. The town was accordingly incorporated, and
Mr. Bower became a member of the original Council, occupying the position from 1855
to 1858. During the early “fifties” he twice visited the Victorian goldfields, and in
1858 made a long holiday tour to the old country. In 1861 he returned to South Australia
o j j
and was engaged in business for some time at Wallaroo. He remained on the Peninsula
for about 10 years, and then once more took up his residence at Port Adelaide. He
again became a member of the Port Municipal Council, and in 1877 occupied the
mayoral chair.
He first entered Parliament in 1865, when he was elected to the Assembly for
the huge constituency which embraced Port Adelaide and Wallaroo. He represented
the Port and Wallaroo Electorate for some 10 years, and then, upon a sub-division
of electorates, he was returned for the District of Port Adelaide. In Parliament he
supported a progressive policy, and encouraged developmental works with much earnestness.
He was instrumental in getting important works undertaken at Port Adelaide, and in
securing substantial benefits for his district. He held office in the Bray Government as
Commissioner of Public Works, and was for a considerable period a member of the Civil
Service Commission—a body which saved the country many thousands of pounds. His
name was familiar to all old residents, and he was esteemed as a worthy and public-spirited
citizen. Many years ago he retired into private life, and he enjoyed a well-earned
cessation from work until his death, in July, 1898.
Being of a charitable nature, his gifts were commensurate with his wealth. At
Wallaroo he presented the Moonta people with a block of land and a building to be used
as an institute of an instructive and educational nature. He laid the foundation stone
of the Moonta Institute. He subsequently donated ,£SOO to establish an institute at
Port Adelaide, and laid the foundation stone of the present institute there. He also placed
in the hands of a trust at Port Adelaide a block of land for the benefit of sailors, and
several Diamond Jubilee Cottages now stand upon it. Ihe land was valued at and
he supplemented it by a cash donation of /JBOO. Mr. Bower made several other gifts to
the public. He sought to encourage self-improvement in the people, and was a staunch
believer in the establishment of public libraries in centres of population. In every respect
he was a colonist of the solid old stamp of ingenuous, energetic, liberal-handed men. He
devoted his time, his talents, and his purse to the people of South Australia. At the
time of his death he was President of the Woodville Mechanics Institute and of the
Port Adelaide Institute. He was for many years a member of the Board ot Governors
of the Institutes of the Province. The South Australian Register , dated July 7, 1898, in
a highly appreciative leader, commenting on his death, said ; “ Blessed is the man whose
death the poor will mourn. This beatitude may be appropriately expressed in any
judicious reference to the late Mr. David Bower, who died at \\ oodville yesterday.
Quiet, self-possessed, unemotional, plain, matter-of-fact, unpretentious- he was nevertheless
a conspicuously useful and, in a very real sense, patriotic colonist.

Mr. Samuel Braund
T T 7K R I
1 many of the singular experiences of veteran colonists recorded in print, they
V V would have the appearance of unreality. A book of representative biography
can deal in generalities only. It must be left to other classes of works to combine
in a single narrative a connected history of typical episodes in the lives of the pioneers
of South Australia. In the life
of Mr. Samuel Braun cl have
occurred episodes that would well
bear recounting at full length were
space available. He was born in
Devonshire in [826, and came
of a family of English farmers.
Employed in the Government
service at home, he eventually
made up his mind to come to
Australia and engage in the bucolic
occupation of his fathers. Leaving
the old country in 1853, he arrived
in South Australia in February,
1854, and became manager, for
Mr. E. j. E. Crawford, of a large
farming property at Hindmarsh.
I he crops near Adelaide in those
days were generally large, and the
prices were such as would delight
the present - day farmer in the
Province. After four years had
passed, Mr Braund began farm-
ing on his own account in the
Hundreds of Grace and Port
Gawler ; but at first he had to put
up with a severe drought, reaping-
less than he actually sowed, and
having to pay its. 6d. per bushel for the seed. Pasture was so scarce that he had for
months to fell the sheaoak trees to secure feed for his cattle. He soon, however, became
one of the largest producers in the Province at that time ; and his returns were generally
sufficient to handsomely recompense him for difficulties with which every husbandman
had then to contend. In the outer districts there were few macadamised roads, so
cartage was an important item in the expenditure of the farmers. Mr. Braund can tell
many stories of hardships in those early days. The knowledge obtained in agriculture in the
old country was very serviceable to him in the Province, and after the initial expense of
clearing and breaking the soil, he obtained a large annual yield from his tillage. For many


years he reaped from his paddocks from 10,000 to 12,000 bushels of corn per year, for which
he frequently secured 10s. and 1 is. per bushel. He established a large dairy on his property,
and also became a sheepfarmer. I welve years after going to Port Gawler, he let his land
on lease, and retired from active business, taking up his residence in Prospect, near Adelaide,
where he has continued to live for 28 years. Mr. Braund is still, however, closely associated
j y ’ j
with the interests of the producers of the Province, and has for many years been connected
* J J
with the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia, of which body
he has been on a committee of management for over 17 years.
O I J
Almost immediately after his removal to Prospect, the residents of that part
agitated for separation from the District of Yatala. Mr. Braund entered heartily into
the movement ; and when a District Council for Prospect was constituted as the result of
this movement, he was chosen its first Chairman. P'or 22 years he was a member
of that Council, for several of which he filled the chair. During that period he actively
promoted the development of the suburb, and its general satisfactory condition to-day is
largely owing to his exertion. He has been frequently asked to stand for Parliament, but has
always declined these requests. His name stands upon the list of Justices of the Peace.
Mr. Braund has been a quiet builder of the State, a man of upright principle and
earnest purpose— one of the class which forms the best side of the national character.
The late Mr. John Stokes Bagshaw
THE clang of the hammer and the roar of the furnace in a new country are heralds of
industry ; and industry is one of the main agencies in the moulding of history in the
crucible of time. The clarion note of commerce thus rings out, and, in a manner of
speaking, one part of history is begun when a man pioneers an industry in a land which
has not a past to look back on, but has its big future before it. The late Mr. John Stokes
Bagshaw can very properly be looked upon as a man who helped to shape the industrial
career of South Australia, inasmuch as he was a pioneer in the manufacture of agricultural
implements at a time when most of the Province’s broad acres had yet to be furrowed by
the gleaming ploughshare. He was made of that indomitable stuff which goes to provide
the bone and sinew of a coming country, develop her resources, and prove her potentialities.
John Stokes Bagshaw was born in Chetwynd, Shropshire, England, in 1808, and
learnt the trade of a millwright and general mechanical engineer. Having acquired
a thorough knowledge of the trade, and being of an inventive turn of mind, he resolved
to emigrate and try his fortunes in South Australia. He arrived here by the ship Eden
in June, 1838. At that time industry was somewhat “cramped,” as might have been expected,
and for a time he had, perforce, to follow occupations not at all congenial to his nature.
But he was not long at this before he launched in an unpretentious manner the Pioneer
Machinery Works; and from a small beginning in 1839 it grew until, at the time of his
retirement from business, it had assumed very large dimensions. \\ ith the primitive appliances
at his command he helped to build the first water, wind, and steam mill, and he also
constructed the first winnowing machine ever made in the Province. He was an ardent
worker in the Ancient Order of Oddfellows, of which he was the founder in South
Australia. He died on January 1, 1888, and his loss was very keenly felt.

Mr. George Brook man
o
MR. GEORGE BROCKMAN is a capitalist who devotes a great deal of his life
to the solving of financial problems in the management of his large interests. He
is a native of Glasgow, and came to South Australia with his father, Mr. Benjamin
Brookman, 45 years ago. His education was imparted at the school of Mr. James Bath,
the present Secretary to the Minister
of Education. Upon leaving school,
Mr. Brookman entered upon a
commercial career in the well-known
establishment of Messrs. I). & J.
Fowler, Adelaide. With that firm
he served for 15 years, and then,
in conjunction with Mr. W. Finlay-
son, he took over its retail grocery
< j ✓
business in King William Street.
I his was probably the largest retail
business in South Australia. At the
end of 10 years, he sold his interest
in the concern, and devoted himself
extensively to financial operations of
diverse kinds. He became a member
of the Stock Exchange of Adelaide
in 1890, and almost immediately
purchased important interests. At
that time the Broken Hill silver
boom was attracting the attention of
Australian Stock Exchanges; but
already the inflation had vanished
from silver-mining.
bor a year or two, Mr. Brookman
then pursued a quiet career on the
Adelaide Exchange. The share
market, whether gold or silver,
copper or lead, had sunk to a low ebb, and the financial deals decreased in volume and
importance. It was not until the astounding discoveries of gold in the deserts of Western
Australia that a revival took place in local mining speculation. Such sensational reports as
those made by Bayley and Ford. John G. Dunn, L. R. Menzie, P. Hannan, and Flannagan,
and the Londonderry prospectors, were bound to stimulate and excite the market. Of the
consequent advantages following upon the Western Australian discoveries, South Australia
reaped not a lew. Alter Hannan and Hannagan had discovered Kalgoorlie, and before
J. J. Cassidy was generally known to be developing a quartz reef in that neighborhood, Mr.


Brookman organised the Adelaide Prospecting Syndicate, and despatched Mr. W. G.
Brookman and Mr. S. W. Pearce to Western Australia to look for likely claims. These
fortunate men went to Albany, and across the desert from York ; and it would seem that
a specially kind fortune took them by the hand. They were led direct to perhaps the
wealthiest and most remarkable belt of gold reefs ever discovered, in Australia at least.
I he Syndicate which Mr. Brookman organised found a gold estate which proved a source of
enormous wealth. Near Kalgoorlie, Messrs. Brookman and Pearce pegged out such famous
claims as the Great Boulder, Ivanhoe, Lake View Consols, Associated Mines, Royal Mint,
Oroya, Brookman’s Boulder, Kalgoorlie Bank of England, Hannans Proprietary Development
Company, and others. To hold this rich group after the leases were taken up called for
financial sagacity of a very superior order. The mining regulations of Western Australia
contained stringent and difficult labor conditions, so that it required considerable capital to
work a single lease up to the provisions, let alone the number possessed by the Adelaide
Syndicate. Ihe general of an army, or the leader of a political revolution, would not be
required to exercise more judgment, strategy, and administrative ability than it was necessary
for Mr. B rookman to show in the circumstances. His syndicate was possessed of valuable
claims, but it needed a hard fight to retain them. Notwithstanding opposition, adverse reports
by experts, and the stringent labor conditions, however, Mr. Brookman won the victory,
financed, and carried the claims on until companies with large capital were floated to own and
develop them. To attain his ends, he obtained the assistance of other wealthy men in South
Australia. Eventually he went to England, where he assisted in establishing some confidence
- O ’ o
in the Western Australian goldfields at a time when the British investor had reason to
fight shy of ventures in those parts. All the claims already mentioned were taken over by
companies formed in London, machinery was purchased, developmental work was carried out,
and their mingled output to-day is astonishing. The ease with which most ot the claims first
discovered were floated in London, the ridiculous over-capitalisation of unproved mines, and
the small sums of money applied to real developmental work, so characteristic of mining
operations on a new field, had had the natural effect of causing a severe re-action from the first
burst of speculation by European operators in Western Australian enterprises; and upon the
legitimate mines, such as those of the Brookman group, the onus was thrown of convincing the
capitalistic world of the gold resources of the new region. The result has justified these
endeavors. The thud of many batteries, the click of many picks, and the hum of a numerous
J J 1
population now sound over the area which the Adelaide Syndicate pegged out. During a
more recent visit to England, Mr. Brookman formed a company to establish smelting works at
Fremantle, Western Australia, and these were calculated to become a great saving and
advantage to the Kalgoorlie mines.
Mr. Brookman is on the directing board of numerous Australian mining
companies, and his ingenuity and financial ability have been taxed to their utmost to
I o J J
manage his large interests. He is faithful to South Australia, and believes in spending
and investing his money in the Province. He is a very wealthy man, and with such
a laudable intention he is bound to greatly benefit the community. He recently erected
o J * *
palatial offices, called Brookman’s Building, in Grenfell Street, Adelaide, at a cost of
,£30,000., And one of his latest acts was the gift of ,£15,000 towards the erection of a
new building for the South Australian School ot Mines in Adelaide; while he also
425
Mr G. Brookman ADELAIDE AND VI GIN IT'Y


liberally subscribed towards the equipment of the Bushmen’s Contingent sent from the
Province to serve in the Boer War. In addition, he gives large orders within this
Province for machinery to be used on Western Australian mines, Mr. Brookman is not
ambitious of public life ; but he was for about eight years a member of the Walkerville
1 <7 /
Municipal Council, and was also for a period its chairman. Some time ago he bought
the almost defunct Pdectric Light and Motor Company at Port Adelaide, which he was
principally instrumental in reorganising, and of which he became Chairman of Directors.
Ihe new company now supplies Port Adelaide with electricity. Mr. Brookman is also
the guiding principal in the Pdectric Lighting Company, which is to supply Adelaide with
the new illuminant. At the time of writing he is absent from the Province on a trip to
Europe.
Mr. J. A. Bagshaw
THL law of heredity, both direct and reverting, offers much food for reflection to the
student of human affairs. No one can gainsay the influence of heredity, for it as
been a potent force from time immemorial, and in the direct transmission of traits,
gilts, and qualifications, has played an important part m every field of life. The subject is
as vast as it is complex, and no writer in modern fiction has described with such unerring
detail the influence of heredity on generation, as Emile Zola. Too often in these days do
w e find the expression “ like lather, like son, applied in the severely cynical sense ot the
term ; but it is indeed pleasing to come across instances of a son having inherited all
the gilts of his parents and employed them to the best possible advantage. We find this
in the case of Mr. j. A. Bagshaw, a son ot a worthy pioneer of South Australia who did
much to help on machinery manufacture here, and who has shown himself to be possessed
ot much ot the inventive faculty which has made the house of Bagshaw a well-known and
respected one throughout the Province. Mr. J. A. Bagshaw is the eldest son of the late
i\l r. John Stokes Bagshaw, and was born m hranklm Street, Adelaide, on September 26,
1838. 1 hat was a time when houses were very rare, and when the bulk of the population
was living under canvas. Mr. Bagshaw was born in a tent under a large gumtree, at a spot
not more than 200 yards from where the Pioneer Machinery Works, which his father inaugurated,
now stands. Pie was educated at Mr. Jolly s school, and finished under the tuition of the
Rev. PP K. Miller, in Pulteney Street. His education completed, he entered his father’s
engineering works, and, starting as an apprentice, learnt his trade in its entirety. In his
calling he exhibited marked ability, and, while a boy, he built a steam-engine in all its parts.
He was the first South Australian native to achieve this distinction, and as a reward for
his efforts he was presented with a gold medal by the Royal Agricultural Society, at whose
annual Exposition the steam-engine was exhibited. The engine was a thorough one in even-
respect, for it was purchased by Messrs. Harford <& Co., and the firm had it in operation for
over ten years. In conjunction with his brother, Mr. T. A. Bagshaw, he has patented several
highly useful inventions in connection with agricultural machinery, and these have been oreatly
appreciated by the young community.

Mr. William Gordon Brookman
IN the whole history of the Western Australian goldfields there is no name better
known than that ol \\ .C. Brookman. His exploits are encircled with romance,
tor fortunate feats are ever pregnant with sensational interest for the reader. His
record has been marvellous, and it is said of him that whatever he touched m Western
Australia turned out well. Every-
one has heard of Mr. Brookman
and his unparalleled success in the
Golden West. I hey regard his
performances with mixed feelings
of curiosity and wonder, and con-
vincingly feel that his discoveries
have kept the sun of prosperity
warm in the Colony at times when,
but for the existence of these
gigantic treasure results, the
prestige and the fortune alike of
Western Australia would have
sunk to alow ebb. His services
are not to be reckoned by the
length of personal success, but by
the more praiseworthy calculus of
the good he has conferred on that
Colon)' as a whole. Just when a
bright example was required, the
world - renowned Great Boulder
stepped into the breach and
declared its extraordinary wealth.
Its consistent richness has proved,
in great measure, the salvation of
the goldfields.
Mr. Brookman was born at
Prospect, Adelaide, in 1863, and received his education at Whinham College. His
scholastic career was creditable, and he succeeded in carrying off several scholarships.
For several years after leaving school he was employed in the Government service of
South Australia, but its monotonous regimen and limited scope did not tend towards
enamoring him with the Civil Service of the Province. Growing tired ultimatelv of its
surroundings, he resolved to launch forth on the commercial world, and embarked on several
enterprising ventures in the city. From the early moments of his introduction to business
life he showed an aptitude for acquiring a rapid and clear knowledge of its many-sided
details, and a thorough practical exposition of his commercial attainments proved him a


capable anti shrewd business man. His educational training aided him considerably in his
lengthened cruises on the sea of competitive enterprise and commerce.
When the sister colony’s goldfields were becoming popular, and Bayley had
discovered Coolgardie, numbers of people went thither in the hopes of wooing early
fortune. In June, 1893, Mr. Brookman and Mr. S. W. Pearce left Adelaide, and took
boat to Albany. On arriving at the latter port they provided themselves with a spring
dray and two good horses, and set out on that tedious and ever-to-be-remembered journey
to Coolgardie. After considerable exertion they reached their Eldorado, but deemed it
more desirable, after a short sojourn in Coolgardie, to push on to Hannans, which was
then a mere embryo. 1 hey pitched their tent and went forth prospecting.
Mr. Brool sman and his companion represented a capital of which, though
a small amount, was sufficient for the time. In the interests of their Syndicate thev set to
earnest work, and prospected the vicinity of Hannans. In a short time they pegged out the
Creat Boulder, Lake \ iew Consols, Ivanhoe, Lake View South, and the Associated Mines.
I hey worked away at these claims with energy and confidence, but a lack of funds in the
treasury of the Syndicate somewhat disappointed the sanguine prospectors. However bright
may have been their anticipations of success, their prospect was darkened by odds and straits.
Again— the exchequer nearing depletion—exemption was unprocurable, and many so-called
mining experts of note endeavored to damp their ardor by decrying the claims, and suggesting
abandonment. \ et, in the teeth of handicaps and vicissitudes they plodded gallantly on,
hoping soon to refute the damaging opinions of their critics. Eventually, after much hard
striving to comply with the stringent labor conditions, they successfully floated the Ivanhoe
Mine in Melbourne for and the Lake View' for 1 hese claims, now of such
great value, and so celebrated, gained popular appreciation at a humble exhibition of is. and
is. 6d. per share in these early days, guessed the rich transformation that was in store
toi these despised and ill-favored stocks. Lncouraged by these flotations, the prospectors did
not pause m theii work of enrichment and aggrandisement till they had pegged .out 500 of the
richest acres in Australia. I here is no music more sweet to the miner’s ear than the measured
clang of the batteries, and these soon sounded over the desert monotony. The yields w’ere
enormous, shares were rushed for, and prices rose quickly. The richness of the claims was
a general theme, and the courage and perseverance of Mr. Brookman were gloriously
rewarded.
I he success of the Great Boulder was the signal for a new era in gold mining
in Western Australia. All Mr. Brockman’s claims were floated with enviable success,
and he now proceeded to London to look after his numerous interests. In the oreat
metropolis he is held in esteem by those with whom he has done business. His minino-
career has been fraught with many retarding and harassing obstacles, but he has overcome
all these triumphantly, and has decked his exploits in colors of splendor.
Mr. Brockman’s success has not been wrongly used. His belief in the mines of
Kalgoorlie seems to be analogous to the enthusiastic and unwavering confidence of Mr.
Lansell in the mining interests of Victoria. Mr. Brookman has not, like many regardless


mining potentates, withdrawn his wealthy capital and interests from the Colony. It is
refreshing, and pleasant to see him investing extensively in the capital—actions which
prove more strongly than words his true belief in the future of the Colony.
II we can study human nature better on the side of fortune, then we can
unhesitatingly say that Mr. Brookman has acquitted himself consistently in the discharge
ot his manifold duties, and he is a staunch patriot. His virtues are those of a man who
knows how to bear misfortune with stoicism, and fortune with grace. His myriad interests
keep him continually busy, and his sense of duty demands ready compliance with its
dictates. Conscientious and true of heart, Mr. Brookman is an excellent example for
many who would benefit by learning and practising his commendable attributes.
A few reflections on the mining fields may aptly be appended as being Mr.
Brookman s own racy observations. In 1893, the year of Mr. Brookman s arrival in the
Colden W est, the train from Albany did not go beyond York, which was then the
terminus of the line in the goldfields’ direction. Neither railway nor telegraphic
communication existed at this early period of awakening, and those who wished to
go to the fields were obliged to walk, ride, or drive the whole distance from York.
It was only recently that the railway from Perth to Kalgoorlie was opened, thereby
providing an easy means of transit to travellers. Kalgoorlie, as it is now known, was in 1893
nothing but a miners camp, occupied by those who were merely endeavoring to get what little
alluvial gold could be obtained to recompense them for their labor and exertions. It was not
until two years after the field was discovered that the town that now appears on the map as
Kalgoorlie was surveyed by the Government. From that time forward the population
of the town has grown in proportion to the progress of the adjoining country.
And what a transformation has been effected in a few brief years! Thirst, famine, and
fever- those guardians of Nature’s treasure-house are overcome. In the wake of the
army of pioneers there follows a vast commissariat of supplies for the men at the front.
Railways bind the busy hives of industry, springing up like magic in the interior, with
bands of steel to the growing ports of the seacoast. A fleet of vessels from all quarters
of the globe is freighted with merchandise for the new West, which has become the
Mecca of the treasure-seeking pilgrims flocking inland in obedience to the auri
sacra fames , that lies inherent in the human breast. “ Judging from what I have
seen, the present population of Kalgoorlie and adjoining mining districts,” Mr. Brookman
says, “ must total 60,000 souls. In 1893 there were only a few hundreds, but the opening
up and development of the mines has brought in its train a career of success, not merely
for commercial and professional men, but for all engaged in every phase of business, not
excluding those interested in the gold mining of the district.” Mr. Brookman in 1898
proceeded on a trip round the world to inspect the great mining centres. During his
absence he was elected a member of the Legislative Council of Western Australia, and
at the municipal elections of 1900 was elected Mayor of Perth.

Messrs. \V. H. Burford and Win. Burford
THE Pilgrim Fathers of South Australia have nearly all disappeared. In the fullness
of time they have passed out of existence, but not of memory. Any history of
* * J J J
South Australia would be incomplete without the names of the score or two of men
who fought and struggled undauntedly, though with small return at first. And while
O O CO J < »
memory and history perpetuate their
names, their children remain to main-
tain the position won by the pioneers
and makers of the Province. In
this sketch an account is given of
a P'ather of the Province who built
up a great business, and of the son
who succeeded to the position and
work. The late William Henville
Burford, and William Burford, his
son, are worthy types of the success-
ful colonial family ; and their com-
mercial progress as individuals not
inadequately typifies the history of
South Australia as a Province.
Mr. W. H. Burford was born at
St. Catherine’s, Middlesex, England,
on January 24, 1807. The youngest
of five sons, he early decided to
learn butchering as’ a trade. He
spent seven years as an apprentice
to that calling, and then followed a
period engaged in the oil and color
trade, under which came such work
as tallow rendering: and tallow candle-
making. Thus the substratum of
that knowledge and experience was laid which served to fit him for a prominent branch
of colonising. When entering his prime, in 1838, full of bodily strength and vigor, he
embarked on the ship Pcstonjcc Povuxnjec for the Antipodes. Among other passengers
on the vessel was Governor Gawler. On October 12, 1838. Mr. Burford. with an invalid
wife and two young children, arrived at Glenelg, South Australia. This Province was
not then out of the infantile stage. 1 here were few conveniences and few buildings, and new
arrivals had literally to make their own homes and carve out some distinctive career for
themselves- often inaugurate new industries. The first experiences in this far-away country
were not reassuring, and the pioneer needed a courageous heart when landing- in the new

I rovince. Mr. Rurford landed on the South Australian shore in water up to his waist;
and when he had got his sick wife and children to dry ground, the family had to spend
two days and nights in guarding their baggage on the beach. Eventually they were
conveyed to Emigration Square, Adelaide, where, to use Mr. Burford’s own’ words, they
were lodged in a rude wooden shanty, without a single article of convenience, and only
is. 6d. in cash to begin colonial life. But uneasy fears as to the wisdom of emigrating
were useless. The die had been cast, and the sturdy colonist had to look about him for
work. The outlook was certainly not promising; for, with no capital, there seemed little
opportunity of making a home and
even a competence in an environment
remote and unsettled ; but he was
strong-hearted, and, with the eagerness
of a sincere worker, felt equal to over-
coming a great many obstacles. He
obtained employment in a limekiln,
and then he was engaged in excavating
a cellar in Bindley Street, Adelaide.
In a few weeks the prospects of the
willing colonist took a more promising
turn. In a letter he sent to the South
Australian Record (published in
London) of August 14, 1839, and
written at Adelaide on January 15
of the same year, he expresses the
brave opinion that life in South Aus-
tralia afforded a comfortable livelihood,
which, with many excellent oppor-
tunities, would justify even a man
with a young family in leaving England
lor “this highly-favored land.” Then
he refers to the progress of the
Province, and says “everybody is
J J J
busy and has a smiling countenance
J O
expressive of sufficiency and
satisfaction.”
After the cellar experience, Mr. Burford obtained employment as a painter and
glazier, and at this work he earned about £ 3 per week. He soon purchased a piece of
town land for payable in weekly instalments ; and, being thrifty, he began to lay the
foundation of that success which he won in later years. From the position of an employe
he came to engage men on his own account at the painting and glazing trade, paying
them from 10s. to 14s. per day. It seemed that this undertaking would supply him with
a permanent and remunerative avocation ; but an infant country is spasmodic in its progress,
and the slightest difficulty will banefully affect the whole community. Mr. Burford’s business
ended with the crisis in the history of the Province caused by the Colonial Office in London
431

dishonoring its bills. But the hardy colonist was not at a loss ; and, being observant, he
rapidly turned his energy to another promising sphere. At that time this Province, like
Western Australia, suffered from a great scarcity of candles and soap. In the Western
colony as much as ios. was sometimes paid for a small cake of the latter commodity, and
often the article could not be obtained at any price, nor did the settlers possess the
inoredients for making it. In South Australia as much as 6d. was paid for a single
O' 2 .
candle at this time ; and Mr. Burford was not slow to appreciate the fact. In 1840 he
turned his hand to the manufacture of candles and soap, a trade which he had fortunately
learned in England. He erected a modest plant, and agreed to pay the butchers
yfWl. per lb. for fat. He was able to supply a good article ; but he then found he had
to fight competition, local and intercolonial. Several years passed, and gradually the
business increased. When the copper mines were opened up he secured large contracts
from the companies owning them, which, with his general connection, made him the
possessor of a thriving factory. Since then the plant has from time to time been enlarged,
and at the present day the business is one of the most substantial and important of local
industries. In [B7B he took his two sons, Messrs. Benjamin and William Burford. into
partnership; but in 1886 Mr. Benjamin Burford retired. It is now principally carried on in
an extensive range of buildings with frontages to Sturt, Russell, Norman, and Gilbert Streets,
Adelaide ; but there are branches also at Hindmarsh, Port Pirie, Port Augusta (in South
Australia), as well as at Broken Hill (N.S.W.), and Perth (W. A.). The sum of ,£16,000 a
vear is disbursed in-wages ; and some 4,000 tons of coal are consumed in running the machinery.
j o
Although very actively engaged in controlling and assisting this rapidly-growing
business, Mr. W. H. Burford yet found time to devote to extraneous matters. The
struo-crles of a young colony are calculated to bring out the best that is in the community,
and Mr. Burford, although unostentatious, and preferring the seclusion of private life to
the glamor of high positions, soon proved that he was not merely a stout-hearted colonist
and a clever business man. In October, 1841, three years after his arrival from England,
he was elected a member of the Common Council in Adelaide. He was thus one of the
municipal fathers of the capital, for it was only in 1840 that the municipality was founded.
Then, in the agitations for responsible government, in the “fifties,” Mr. Burford took
an active part. He gave the movement an earnest support, and, upon the granting
of the new Constitution, he was elected, on March 9, 1857, to the House of Assembly
for the City of Adelaide, together with five other representatives of the same constituency.
He sat for two sessions, resigning on April 29, 1859. One so earnest as Mr. Burford
was certain to take a keen interest in debates on important questions and principles. In
1857 he unsuccessfully advocated a land tax on large holders. He supported the Real
Property Act of Sir Richard Torrens ; and on more than one occasion Sir Richard
publicly announced to how great an extent he was beholden to Mr. Burford for his
help. The first copy of his book on “Law Reform” this statesman presented to Mr
Burford, on June 1, 1859, with the following inscription: —“This, the first completed
copy of my work, I present to my friend, W. H. Burford, hoping that he will accept it
as testifying my esteem for his steadfastness and integrity of character, and my gratitude
for the assistance rendered by him in carrying the Real Property Act through the
Legislative Assembly, especially on the occasion of the second reading.”

ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Messrs. W. H. &W. Burford


The course of Mr. Burford’s life was largely affected by a deep religious fervor. He
had strong views, and never swerved from them. It was one of his favorite sayings that
a candlemaker, of all persons in the world, though he might not be a great luminary,
ought to burn with no uncertain light.” It was largely in search of perfect freedom of
belief that he emigrated to South Australia, and throughout his long life he consistently kept
up his adherence to the comparatively small religious community with which he had identified
himself. In April, 1841, he signed a memorial to Governor Gawler in the interests of
religious equality. Before his arrival in this Province he had been an active Christian
worker. When he was but 19 years old he joined the celebrated Rev. G. C. Smith, the
sailors missionary, and was leader of the singing at open-air meetings in the Billingsgate
Pish Market. He was an energetic worker for the Church of Christ, and was for* very
many years a member and liberal supporter of that denomination at Kermode Street, North
Adelaide. He was an elder of the Church, and frequently occupied the pulpit.
Notwithstanding the vicissitudes of the early days, Mr. Burford lived to a ripe
old age. He was in his 89th year when he finished his earthly course. On October 23,
1895, he died at Clapham Park, South Australia ; and thus went one of the few
links which bound the earliest period of South Australian historv with the present, and
there was none more sincere, shrewd, and businesslike than he.
Happily Mr. W. H. Burford was blessed with a son eminently capable of
carrying on his business. Mr. William Burford, who, on his father’s death, succeeded to
the control, is as astute in business, and as earnest in philanthropy, as was the founder of
the family in South Australia. Mr. Burford was born in the Province on December 11
Bqs' and was educated at the then notable school of Mr. J. L. Young. Immediatelv
after leaving school, he joined his father in the business, and quickly mastered the
ramifications of that extensive concern. Under paternal guidance he made a careful study
of. and gained experience in, every branch of the large undertaking, until he became
quite competent to assume a responsible share in the management. The two sons
undoubtedly proved reliable successors to their father in the house, and under their
guidance the dimensions of the business were extended, and new ideas and appliances
were inaugurated.
Mr. \\ illiam Burford has taken considerable interest in municipal government.
He entered the Unley Council in 1884, and was returned unopposed. In 1892 he severed
this connection, having removed to Clenelg as a place of residence. He was returned
unopposed for the Clenelg Council in 1895. He remained in office until April, 1896, when
he retired in order to take a trip round the world. After his return, in the following-
year (1897), he re-entered upon his municipal duties. In December, 1897, he was once
more returned unopposed to the Clenelg Council. For some 15 years he has been a
member of committee of the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures ; and besides
these public positions, Mr. Burford occupies several others.
Summing up in a word the careers of the two subjects of this memoir, it is to
be said that, while Mr. Burford, senior, conferred lasting benefits on the Province of South
Australia, his son has ever worthily followed in his footsteps.

Messrs. T, G. H. Biiring and C. A. Sobels
IN the agitation for the proclamation of the Province ot South Australia, stretching over
a period of four years before the authorising Act of Parliament was passed, it was
frequently set forth that the soils in this part of the south coast would take kindly
to vine culture. Later, when the South Australian Company had been projected by T
the revered George Pile Angas
the records of local industries to be
founded made special reference
to the despatch of experienced
vignerons. A few representatives
of this class of workers were
introduced ; but. notwithstanding
that they were able to produce
fine grapes, the conditions follow-
ing upon local colonisation checked
for several years any substantial
attempt to establish a wine-making
industry. It was not until late
in the “forties” that any special
advance was made in this
direction. It was then believed
\)y several experienced men that
extensive areas of country afforded
excellent prospects tor such
purposes. Vineyards were planted
in several districts, and a trade
was developed in the course of
years ; but it is only, however, in
the last two decades that South
Australian wines have made any
solid impression on English and
European markets. To this day.
however, many of these early
vineyards continue in existence. Prominent among the vignerons of the Province to-day
are the names of Messrs. Bliring & Sobels, who are joint proprietors of the Spring Vale
Vineyard at Watervale.
Mr. T. G. Hermann Bliring was born in Berlin in 1846, and in 1849 came to
South Australia with his parents in the ship Princess Louisa. His father, Mr. F. A. Bliring,
was an engineer and a brassfounder by profession, and early entered into partnership with
Mr. Ernst Fischer. Bliring junior was educated first at Mr. R. C. Mitton’s school, and
subsequently at the educational establishment of Mr. J. C. Hansen. When he left school

he went “up country,” and was for nearly nine years engaged as a storekeeper. He next
spent three years at the distillery of Mr. Benno Seppelt at Seppeltsfield. The nine succeeding
years were occupied by him in storekeeping on his own account at Friedrichswalde, after
which he decided to remove to Adelaide. In 1879 he opened a store in Pirie Street; and
at the same time received the sole agency for the Spring Vale wines, which were then
being manufactured by Mr. C. A. Sobels for Mr. J. M. Richman, owner of the estate, and
a brother-in-law of the late Sir Walter W. Hughes. In the year 1890 Mr. Biiring and Mr.
Sobels joined forces and purchased the Spring Vale vineyard and plant, and since that
time have worked it in conjunction.
Mr. Burinsf was President of the
Winegrowers’ Association in 1 896,
and has been a member of the
Council of that body for many
J J
years.
Charles August Sobels was
o
born at Ouedlinburg, Hanover, in
1.838, and came to South Australia
with his parents in 1848. His father
was a practical winemaker, having
studied the industry on the
Continent. Mr. Sobels, sen., was
the first to start winemaking in
the Tanunda district, and carried
on business there for a number of
years. At his death, in October,
1863, he was succeeded by his son,
Mr. C. A. Sobels, who from his
boyhood had acquired a thorough
knowledge of wines and vine
culture, and is acknowledged to be
one of the most expert winemakers
in Australia. In 1868 he was con-
nected with Mr. Richman, acting
as winemaker for that gentleman.
Mr. Btiring has charge of the com-
mercial department of the firm, whilst Mr. Sobels superintends the manufacturing branch. The
vineyard lies ~600 feet above sea level (an altitude favorable to the production of light wines),
and contains i2O acres of full-bearing vines. The stock of grapes is supplemented by purchases
from surrounding growers. The firm of Buring & Sobels has been very successful in prize-
taking, having carried off honors at London, Bordeaux, lat is, 1 hiladc.lphia, and at the
Adelaide International jubilee Exhibition. They have established a promising export trade
with England and the Continent. They have perhaps gained most fame for their Old Port,
Madeira? Claret. Ouellthaler, Hock, and Reisling wines, which won the highest encomiums
from connoisseurs. Mr. Sobels is a Justice of the 1 eace. ini

Mr. Lewis Cohen
ORIGINALITY is peculiarly characteristic to the Hebraic race in Australia, and, as
an example, Mr. Lewis Cohen, during his political career in the House, won not
a little prestige for the staunch fashion in which he clung to his tenets. His
ideas were not the slavish borrowings of some influential leader ; they were the grist of
his own milling. Mr. Cohen was
born in Liverpool in 1849, and,
when three years old, came to
Australia with his father, Mr.
Henry Cohen, who was for many
years engaged in commercial pur-
suits in New South Wales. The
son received his elementary
education in Sydney, and then
J J 1
proceeded to England, in 1867.
to complete his studies. On
returning to New South Wales,
he resided in Sydney, but shortly
J J J
afterwards left for Fiji. At this
time the South Sea Islands
afforded considerable opportuni-
ties for commercial enterprise.
Trading had not yet surfeited
the market, and the whirl of
competition was still in its first
rotatory movement. But Fiji had
entered upon an active phase in
its existence, for the residents
were going to adopt a system of
constitutional government. The
country was consequently in a
state of considerable agitation,
and the energy of the white
settler was willingly put forth in the attempt to establish an autonomous legislature. A
system of municipal government was established, and Mr. Cohen, in 1872, was elected
a member of the council. He proved himself a useful auxiliary to the devisers of the
new administration. His counsel, tendered with due regard to the ancient privileges
and customs of the natives, was relied upon. Ihe administration provided for five
Ministers, with King Cakabau at the head. Mr. Cohen received the thanks of the
Ministry for his useful services ; and the white settlers, who profited considerably by
this salient administrative establishment, expressed their indebtedness to his serviceable
assistance.


In 1876 Mr. Cohen arrived in Adelaide, and opened a branch of the London
Discount and Mortgage Bank, Limited, the head office of which was in Melbourne. In
1879 Mr. Cohen was elected President and Treasurer of the Adelaide Hebrew Congregation.
Ihe chairmanship of the school in connection with that religious denomination was also
held by him for three years. Following upon his arrival in Adelaide, he interested
himself keenly in the welfare of several fraternities. He has been prominently associated
with the Oddfellows, Foresters, and Druids, having occupied the position of Grand
President of the last-named society. He is also a Freemason. Mr. Cohen’s public
career in Adelaide may be said to date from the time of his return to the City Council
for MacDonnell Ward. His attitude was always one of progression in the Council ; and
he secured re-election. At the end of his second term, in 1890, he stood for the Mayoralty,
and was duly elected ; and, at the close of his first year of office, he was returned
unopposed. Under his municipal administration several progressive enactments and
ameliorative measures were introduced and passed for the benefit of the city. Although
requested by a large and representative deputation, he declined to act for a third term,
owing to the pressure of private business. Upon the termination of his occupancy of the
civic chair he tendered a ball in the Exhibition Building, which is said to have been
the largest ever held in the Southern Hemisphere, there being no fewer than 3,600 guests
present. A return ball was given him by the citizens, and a suite of diamonds given
to the Mayoress. A full-length painting of himself was presented to the citizens, which
now hangs in the Town Hall.
In 1887 Mr. Cohen entered the House of Assembly for the District of North
Adelaide, and retained his seat for six years, retiring in 1893. He was as useful in
Parliament as in the City Council. Always strong in debate, and a good fighter, he was
not afraid to cross swords with the most redoubtable parliamentarians. When the Hon.
J. H. Howe retired from the Cockburn Administration, Mr. Cohen was offered a portfolio ;
but business would not permit him to devote enough time to the responsible duties, and
he declined the honor. Mr. Cohen has always been a staunch supporter of Protection. He
has for many years been a Justice of the Peace, as well as a visiting Justice to the Lunatic
Asylums of the Province. He has been an earnest supporter of the Australian Natives
Association, and has occupied the position of president of the local branch. He supported
the formation of the Wattle Blossom League, and a social club connected with the A. N. A.,
of which Mrs. Cohen had the honor of being elected first president.
Dr. Thomas Cawley, M.D.
AS an honored exponent of the great healing art in this Province, I homas Cawley, M.D.,
claims historic notice. He was born in Cheshire, England, in May, 1837. In 1873
the wide field presented to medical skill in Australia attracted the notice of Di.
Cawley, who sailed to Sydney. After spending a few weeks in Sydney, he came to
South Australia. He resided at Glenelg for three or four years, and then took a trip to
Europe. He holds the post of Honorary Surgeon to the Orphan Home and the Childrens
Home, and formerly was House-Surgeon to the Retreat for Fallen Women. For two
years he sat on the Board of the Adelaide Hospital. A genial, kindly, couiteous, and
talented gentleman, Dr. Cawley holds the high esteem of all sections of the community.

The late Mr. James Cowan
MANY South Australians will remember the gloom cast over the Province by the
news of the shocking death of Mr. James Cowan, M.P., by accident, near Dry
Creek, in July, 1890. He had for years been a prominent colonist, and a few
months before his death had been elected to a seat in the House of Assembly, where he
showed such promise that hopes
were entertained of a bright future
for him. His disposition was so
kindly that the sudden ending
seemed the more pathetic. James
Cowan was born in the north of
Ireland in 1848, and four years
later came, with his parents, to
South Australia. He was edu-
cated at the North Adelaide
Grammar School, upon leaving
which he entered his father’s
business house in North Ade-
laide. where that gentleman
owned coaching- stables. In
o
addition, the latter was interested
in grazing pursuits. A brother
(the late Mr. Thomas Cowan,
M.P. for Yatala) was also asso-
ciated with the business. After
some time the father closed his
city establishment, and removed
to Two Wells, where he possessed
a farm and an hotel. Before he
was out of his teens, Mr. James
Cowan entered into business on
his own account at Two Wells,
as a mail contractor and small
farmer. Prom the outset his concerns flourished, and, being enterprising, he bought a
flourmill from Mr. Henry Warren (his wife’s father), in the same neighborhood. This
proved a very successful investment, and within a few years Mr. Cowan was the proprietor
of mills at Ouorn, M.allala, Allendale, and Gladstone, and also wharves at Port Pirie
and Port Gawler, with numerous agencies. The business formed by Mr. Cowan and
others was then merged into the Adelaide Milling Company. In the meantime Mr. Cowan
had become prominently identified with several land syndicates, by which he accumulated
considerable capital. He was interested in the Willowie Pastoral Company, and helped in
opening up mines at Woodside, particularly the; Bird-in-Hand Mine.


Up to this time everything had gone well with Mr. Cowan; but, as the result
of severe depression all over the Province, heavy inroads were made into his capital.
Ihe climax came with the failure of the Commercial Bank of South Australia, which
seriously affected him with so many others. But his financial difficulties were merely
temporary. Mr. Cowan had the good fortune to buy shares in the Broken Hill Proprietary
Company when they could be had at a low price, and the wonderful rise in their value
again made him a rich man. He set about recovering the farming and other properties
he had previously lost, and also purchased three stations- one at Charlotte Waters, one
at Alice Springs, and one on the River Murray. He assisted in the formation of a Coke
Company at Port Pirie, became a shareholder in John Hill & Co.’s coaching business,
and a partner in an Adelaide furnishing warehouse. He purchased the residence of
the late Mr. James Stuart Sanders at Burnside, one of the most beautiful homes in the
Province ; and there his wife and he lived to the time of his death. Mr. Cowan took an active
interest in geographical matters, and was a promoter of the Tietkins Exploration Party, which
went into Central Australia. He was associated with the Council ot the Zoological Society,
and made several gifts to that institution. He was a Justice oi the Peace, and in April,
1890, was elected to the House of Assembly for Yatala. When Parliament met, Mr. Cowan
made an immediate impression on members by the intelligence and knowledge displayed
in his addresses and his powers as a debater; and he was looked upon as a possible Minister
of the Crown in the near future. He was appointed a member of such important bodies
as the Free Trade and the Federation Select Committees of the House. But at this stage
in his career his life was cut short. While driving with Mr. Bullimore, electrician, across
the railway line near Dry Creek, on July 21, 1890, his horse jibbed on the rails, and.
before it could be moved, a train dashed into the vehicle and killed the two gentlemen
instantly. This untimely end to so prominent a man caused heartfelt and general sorrow.
Mr. C. H. T. Connor
ONE of the principal representatives of the paramount industry of South Australia,
wheat-growing in the milling side —is Mr. Charles Hawkes I odd Connor, who
was born in Ireland in 1836, and came to South Australia in 1853. Immediately
on his arrival in the Province he joined the firm of John Hart <& Co. Mr. Connor
eventually founded the Adelaide Milling and Mercantile Company. In 1883 the Company
was changed, and became the Adelaide Milling Company, Limited, ot which Mr. Connor
has since been manager. The Company manipulates an immense quantity of wheat, which
it draws from every part of the Province, and has numerous branches at Iwo \\ ells,
Gawler, Wallaroo, Gladstone, Snowtown, Moonta, Port Pirie, Hawker, Jamestown, Ouorn,
and Port Adelaide. In 1861, during the term of office of Governor Pergusson, Mr.
Connor proceeded to Calcutta as Commissioner tor South Australia, with the object of

Mr. Charles Cross
IN South Australia few men have attained such publicity as dispensing pharmacists as
Mr. Charles Cross, who, by constant experiments and knowledge gained over a long
period of years in the manufacture of medicines, succeeded in discovering some
useful medicinal remedies. He was born in London on October 15, 1845, and his parents
came to South Australia in 1854.
Chemistry being uppermost in Mr.
Cross’s mind, he, early in life,
entered the service of Mr. Luther
Scammell, chemist and druggist,
under whose direction he pursued
his studies. After a few years,
Mr. Scammell became associated
in partnership with Mr. b. 11.
Eaulding, in Adelaide, and Mr.
Cross was transferred to the head
place of business, where he re-
mained with Messrs. Eaulding and
Company for 1 1 years. At that
time the homoeopathic system of
treatment was attracting attention,
and Mr. Cross engaged himself to
Mr. E. S. Wigg, homoeopathic
chemist, remaining eight years in
his employ, and latterly holding
the management of the pharmacy.
Having derived great benefit by
observing the prescriptive remedies
of leading doctors, he resolved to
start in business on his own
account ; and, with this end in
view, purchased an old-established
pharmacy in Gawler. He made a
special study of indigestion, and, after mature experiments, brought forward a remedy in
the shape oi drops. He advertised judiciously and attractively, and in one year expended
,£l,OOO In this direction.
Whilst in Gawler he made himself extremely useful in promoting the welfare of
the town. In the Wesleyan Church he was for many years local preacher, circuit treasurer,
and representative at the annual conference of that body. Afterwards he resigned these
offices. He was President of the Blue Ribbon Army; Chairman of the Gawler P riendly
Societies’ Union ; Treasurer of the Agricultural Society, the Literary Society, and the


Benevolent Society ; Member of Committee of the Bible Society and Institute ; and Past
Officer of the Foresters and Rechabites. Mr. Cross lectured on frequent occasions for
religious and benevolent societies. In connection with the opening of the Exhibition Building
at Gawler a public meeting was held, and he was appointed to arrange with merchants in
Adelaide for the display of their goods. This undertaking he engineered successfully.
Por some time he sat as councillor in the Gawler Council, and was afterwards asked to
stand tor the mayoralty, but his removal to Adelaide prevented his doing so. He was
also asked to stand as a candidate for the constituency of Barossa, but declined. He was
once chosen by the Pharmaceutical Society of South Australia to represent it at the
\ ictorian Conference. In 1888 Mr. Cross was made a J.P. On the first occasion that he sat
on the bench, the only delinquent presented for punishment had no money with which to
pay the fine inflicted, and Mr. Cross paid the money himself.
At length Mr. Cross found it necessary to remove to Adelaide to extend the
sphere of his operations ; and on his leaving Gawler the townspeople tendered him a
banquet, which was attended by a representative gathering of influential citizens ; and
Mr. Cross was presented with a large illuminated address, the outcome of a public
subscription. Mr. Cross still continues his public lectures, the subjects embracing “ Love,
Courtship, and Marriage,” “ Proverbs and their Lessons,” “ Mark Twain,” “ The Rontgen
Rays,” “ Chemistry,” “ Life and Character illustrated by Candles,” “ Chats on Poison,” etc.
j ' j j
He has an original manner of dealing with these diverse topics, and blends with the more
solid portions a great deal of humor, thus making them very popular. While delivering
his lecture, “ Life and Character illustrated by Candles,” he displayed upon the platform
over 250 candles of all sorts, sizes, colors, and shapes, lighted and unlighted, from six
feet high and four inches in diameter to a mere rushlight all being specially manufactured
for him. The various phases of life and character, and the original remarks which
accompanied these novel illustrations, were interesting. His “ Chat on Poisons ” was
delivered expressly for juveniles, and in this he introduced an interesting feature, arranging
the names of the poisons in such a manner that immediately it became known that a
certain poison had been taken, the name of it suggested in rhyme the recognised treatment
to be adopted. Mr. Cross thought that children, and adults as well, might remember the
treatment quicker in this way, and experience proved this to be true. Before entering on
his profession as a chemist, Mr. Cross was identified with the publication entitled Printers Ink.
He has published a pamphlet on “ Indigestion and its Cure,” of which over 412,000 copies
have been printed. He has also written a pamphlet on “ Lead Poison,” the treatment he
recommends being first to neutralise the poison, then to decompose it, and afterwards to
remove it from the system. Some flattering opinions have been expressed on this work,
Mr. A. Thomas, P'.C.S., of London, stating “that Mr. Cross’s was the best and surest
remedy that could be used in lead poisoning cases.” During one of his holiday trips, Mr.
Cross paid a visit to the Narracoorte Caves, South Australia, and wrote an article (illustrated)
descriptive of these natural attractions, which was published in the Christmas number of the
Adelaide Observer , 1897, and excited a good deal of favorable comment. Mr. Cross continues
the manufacture of his medicine, and his business is a large and flourishing one. He is a
member of the Pharmaceutical Society of South Australia, of the Pharmaceutical Society of
Victoria, and of the Homoeopathic Society of Great Britain.

Mr. John Darling, sen.
MR. JOHN DARLING, sen., for many years one of the great wheat merchants in
Australia, has been most active in opening up markets for Australian wheat. He
must receive the credit of attracting hundreds of thousands of pounds to this
Province, and, by honorable business, of adding to that popularity of the local grain, which its
undoubted excellence has earned.
But Mr. Darling has gone beyond
this particular yet all important
sphere, and has helped the
industry with sound advice in the
legislative halls of South Aus-
tralia. Born in Edinburgh,
Scotland, in 1831, Mr. Darling
was educated at the George
Harriot School, a celebrated insti-
tution in that ancient city. He
was for 13 years a type-founder
in the establishment of Marr and
Co., in Edinburgh, and came to
South Australia in 1855. P'rom
the outset he became interested
in the producing industry, first in
association with the business of
Messrs. Giles & Smith, grain and
general merchants, ol Adelaide.
After some - years he joined the
late Mr. R. G. Bowen in a similar
business, and eventually became
the proprietor ot that gentleman’s
connection. With the utmost
shrewdness, and with uncommon
enterprise, Mr. Darling quickly
rose to a leading position as a
grain merchant and exporter. A description of this important business will be found in
another part of this work, under the name of Mr. John Darling, jun., M.P., from which
will be gathered some idea of the success which has attended the operations of Mr.
Darling, sen. It was not an easy matter to secure so large a portion oi the trade ; but
Mr. Darling made such a study of the market that he managed his concerns with lucrative
results. The firm of John Darling & Son has made a name through England, Europe,
America, and South Africa, as one of the largest exporters ol grain in Australia. When
Victoria became an active rival of South Australia in wheat production, thus closing the


readiest market for the local product, Mr. Darling visited England and America, and opened
up new markets, popularising the products of the wheat fields of the Province in the
principal consuming countries in the world. Large argosies have been sent forth from
South Australia by the firm, which obtains its wheat at first hand from the farmers by
establishing branches in the principal districts. Upon Mr. Darling, sen., must be conferred
the credit of establishing an institution of vast importance to South Australia.
Mr. Darling’s political career began in 1870, when he was elected for West
Adelaide for a seat in the House of Assembly. He only remained in the House for one
year on this occasion, but again sat for West Adelaide in 1876 and 1877. In 1878 he
was returned for the District of Yatala, retired in 1880, and did not re-enter Parliament
until May, 1885, when he was chosen as representative for Stanley. In May,
1887, he headed the poll among 10 candidates for the representation of the Northern
District in the Legislative Council, and he continued in the Upper House for ten years,
when he retired from politics and from business. Sound in judgment, and possessed of a
wide knowledge of South Australia gained in the pursuit of his large business, Mr.
Darling as a legislator was very useful to the Province. He supported the interests of
the farming community, and no one understood their requirements better than he.
Although not a frequent speaker in Parliament, his utterances carried weight, and it could
never be said that he spoke to the gallery ; his opinions were based too firmly on
experience to permit him to vacillate for votes. In June, 1885, he accepted the portfolio
of Commissioner of Public Works in the Ministry of Sir John Downer ; but as he
retired from the Government in October of the same year, he had litttle opportunity to
prove his worth as an administrator. He was a useful member of several Select
Committees and Royal Commissions, that on the coal contracts and wharfingering being
appointed on his initiative.
In philanthropic circles Mr. Darling’s name is favorably known in Adelaide, and
among other donations was the sum of given towards the erection of the City
M ission Hall in Light Square. He is a prominent supporter of the Caledonian Society,
and was elected to the office of Chief. He was prominent in establishing the beautiful
cricket oval in Adelaide, and is father of the brilliant left-hand batsman, “Joe Darling.”
Since his retirement Mr. Darling has resided in Melbourne. In private, as well as in
industrial circles, his name carries general respect in South Australia.
Mr. John Creswell
AMONG the leading figures in the Australasian Cricket Council has long been a
representative of South Australia, Mr. John Creswell, the Honorary Secretary. He
was born at Woodville, South Australia, on December 8, 1858, and attended St
Peter’s College for some time. Upon the conclusion of his college career he became associated
in business with the late Mr. E. S. C. Driffield, local manager of the National Eire and
Marine Insurance Company of New Zealand. Mr. Creswell, upon the death of Mr. Driffield
in 1889, succeeded to the business and the various positions attached to it. Two years later
he became Secretary of the South Australian Cricketing Association. He helped to form the
South Australian P'ootball Association in 1876, and was for many years its Secretary.

Mr. Hmjh Robert Dixson
o
r PHE annual output of tobacco constitutes a very substantial asset of South Australia.
However the moralist may prate of the moral aspect of the nicotine habit, it must
be admitted that, like opium, it is a useful source of wealth from the tax-collectors
point of view. Without the imposition of duties on such luxuries, the incomes of nations
would be in a sorry condition, and
direct taxation would have to be
levied. In South Australia the
public revenue is materially aug-
mented by the tobacco duties.
There are certain local firms which
enter extensively into the manu-
facture of tobacco, employ con-
siderable labor, invest substantial
capital, and, by importing the raw
material, largely augment the
<7 J O
revenue. Among these the name
of Robert Dixson & Co. is the
best known, and the head of the
concern, Mr. H. R. Dixson, is one
of the leading business men of the
Province.
Hugh Robert Dixson was
born at Forbes, New South Wales,
in 1865. His father, Mr. Robert
Dixson, for years controlled the
firm of Robert Dixson <N Co. in
Adelaide ; and his grandfather,
Hugh Dixson, established the first
tobacco business in the capital of
New South Wales. The history
of the original firm began in the
earlier half of the nineteenth century, and in the course of generations it has ramified
throughout Australasia. It is now the largest house of its kind on this continent, and
possesses plantations in New South Wales and Queensland. Messrs. Dixson are also the
largest importers of American leaf in Australasia. The firm employs some 500 hands in
the different factories. There are branches in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Fremantle, as
well as in Adelaide. The subject of our sketch was educated at the Scotch College, Melbourne,
and University College, London. In 1878 his fathe", Mr. Robert Dixson, came over from
Melbourne and established the South Australian branch ; and. upon leaving College, Mr.
H. R. Dixson settled in this Province, and was associated with the local business until


1889. In that year he went to Western Australia, and established an extensive connection
there, with Premantle as the distributing centre. He remained in the West until 1893,
and during that period became well known and popular among its chief commercial men.
I pon the death of his father, Mr. Dixson returned to Adelaide and took over the local
connection from the trustees. He employs in Adelaide about 100 hands, principally in the
manufacturing department, and among the brands of tobacco sold are the “Conqueror,’’
" American Lagle,” “ Yankee Doodle,” and “ Champion." He also intrduced to South
Australia the “ Dixson’s No. 1 Cigarette,” of which nearly two million packets are now made
up annually.
Even this short sketch will be sufficient to show to how large an extent Mr.
< j
Dixson is representative among the commercial men of the city. Put in other respects
he has manifested talent of a useful order. He has occupied many honorable public and
semi-public positions in the Province, and has proved himself willing to devote time and
money to the public welfare. He represented Gawler Ward in the City Council in 1888-9,
He evinces an interest in sport, and was for some time Treasurer, and also Chairman,
of the South Australian Rowing Association. He is a patron of music also, and liberally
supports local musical societies. He has officiated on the committee of several choral
societies, and has taken part in many concerts as a soloist. In more recent years he has
been prominent in mining affairs, and was one of the fortunate early shareholders in the
Coolgardie Syndicate which sent out the prospectors who discovered the famous Boulder
group of mines. Mr. Dixson’s commercial talents were so highly esteemed that, when on
a visit to London in 1897, he was deputed, in conjunction with Mr. George Brookman,
by the Adelaide shareholders to represent them at the annual meeting of the
Great Boulder Company. He was successful in the desired object to get a considerable
alteration made in the Articles of Association, and to obtain the establishment of an
Adelaide Board of Directors. In political matters Mr. Dixson has taken much interest, and
at the recent Assembly elections, he contested the District of North Adelaide, and was only
defeated by the sitting members by a narrow margin. He is at present a Vice-President, and
also Chairman, of the Council of the Protectionist Association of South Australia.
He is possessed of shrewd business intelligence, and his judgment in commercial
matters is highly esteemed. In the management of the extensive branch of local industry
of which he is proprietor, he is enterprising, active, and thorough, and the destinies of
the firm are safe in his hands. He is as popular with his employes as with the public.
Dr. William Lennox Cleland, M.B.
DR. WILLIAM LENNOX CEE LAND, the present Colonial Surgeon and Medical
Officer for Parkside and Adelaide Lunatic Asylums, was born at Hong Kong, of
Scotch parents, on July 18, 1847. When about 24 years of age he entered upon
the medical course at Edinburgh University, and in 1876 took the M.B. degree. Dr. Cleland
practised privately for about a year in South Australia, and then accepted the appointment
of Medical Officer to the Parkside Lunatic Asylum, which he has held ever since. On the
resignation of Dr. Paterson in 1895, Dr. Cleland assumed the position of Resident Medical
Officer at North Terrace Asylum, as well as being appointed Colonial Surgeon.

Mr. Alexander George Downer
THERE is in Adelaide a firm of lawyers which has helped considerably in the making 1
of the history of the Province. Por some decades past one or another member of
the Downer family has figured prominently in the annals of the Province. In the
legal profession, all have pursued useful careers; in the political arena they have fought
with the best ; and in the pastoral and commercial pursuits they have been among the
rulers of local destiny. Ihe biography of Sir John Downer is given in another page of
this book of South Australian memoirs, and this one is devoted to his brother and partner,
Mr. A. G. Downer. I his latter gentleman was born in Adelaide, and was principally
educated at the establishment of Mr. F. Haire. He first began the study of Law, and was
for some years with the firm of Bartley, Bakewell, & Stow ; but after a while he engaged
in the more ready profession of journalism, which, though not so remunerative, has potent
attractions for a young and ardent man. Mr. Downer’s essays in this direction were in
connection with, and as editor for a time of, the Telegraph , a newspaper which flourished
for a period, and was then swallowed up and incorporated with a more powerful organ.
Mr. Downer eventually returned to his law books, and was admitted to practice in 1868.
His brother (now Sir John Downer) had just been admitted at that time, and the two
young men went into partnership. Throughout all the intervening years thev have been in
practice togethei, and have attained and maintained an honorable name m connection with
South Australian law. I heir clients have represented leading colonists, and their cases
have embraced many of those of supreme interest in local jurisprudence. Within their
office problems of paramount importance to the Province have been studied and mastered.
Ihe partnership has in every respect been a happy one, and the two gentlemen form a
very strong legal entity. They are two of the oldest members of the legal profession in
South Australia.
Sir John Downer entered the political arena, and became more than once Premier
of South Australia. Mr. A. G. Downer has been content to serve the Province in other
fields —principally in connection with pastoral, financial, and commercial pursuits. He early
invested in pastoral stations, principally in the north. He has been associated with the
management of large institutions, and is at present Chairman of the Bank of Adelaide,
and of the China Traders Company, and is on the Board of several other important
institutions. Of the Bank of Adelaide he has been a Director since 1889, and of Elder,
Smith, A. Co., since 189 c. In these responsible positions he has helped to determine
business issues of wide-reaching influence.
Mr. A. C. Downer has also been interested in the management of benevolent
institutions. In characteristics, he is shrewd, cautious, and businesslike, excellent qualities
for a lawyer. He well maintains his position in the Downer family, as well as in the
capacity of a leader in various branches of South Australian industry and policy. His
name, like that of his partner, will be remembered for many years.

The late Mr. Charles Drew
HIGHLY respected by all who knew him was the late Mr. Charles Drew, who, both in
religious matters and in local business circles, was a moving spirit. During many
years he was an indefatigable member of the Wesleyan Church. He was born
J O J
at Stoke-under-Ham, Somersetshire, England, on January 28, 1836, and he arrived in
South Australia in 1854. Not-
withstanding the better-advertised
attractions of the V ictorian gold-
fields, the famous copper mines of
the Burra Burra were at that time
still drawing- numerous new arrivals
to the inland town that had sprung
up since the discovery of rich
copper deposits there some ten
years before. Mr. Charles Drew
proceeded to the Burra, impelled
thitherwards by the fact that his
brother, Mr. Samuel Drew, was
already there. He joined his
brother in business as gfeneral
o
storekeepers, and the busi-
ness eventually became very lame
J J O
and prosperous, with extensive
connections throughout the sur-
rounding parts of the country. A
general storekeeper’s trade in the
country in those davs was generally
J J m) J
sure to thrive under g'ood manag-e-
-o O
ment, but that of Samuel Drew
and Co. forged ahead of all local
competitors.
In 1865, Mr. Charles Drew,
in company with his brother John, went to Moonta to open in business. Here, as in the
Burra, the copper mines had attracted, and were attracting, a substantial population. The
Moonta store was established at the right time, and the Messrs. Drew rapidly became the
chief business men in the town. They were esteemed, not only for their integrity in
business, but also for their services in other matters of general moment. Mr. Charles
Drew entered the first municipal council, and had the well-deserved distinction of being
the first mayor of the town. In the Burra he had evinced a lively interest in public
affairs, and assistance such as he tendered there was as willingly offered in Moonta. In
both places he was a very active member of the Wesleyan Church, which he served in


various offices and helped with liberal donations. In 1882 he left Moonta and returned
to the Burra, and the occasion was marked by very flattering testimonies to his character
from his fellow-citizens. He now conducted the business in the Burra, from which Mr.
John Drew retired in 1882, and ol which Mr. Thomas Drew was now the other remaining
partner. The firm of Samuel Drew & Co. possessed some historical importance, for it
was associated with the opening up of pastoral stations, which it supplied with rations and
other necessaries. As the argentiferous richness of Broken Hill became more and more
a certainty, the firm’s connection with that centre increased. They were among the earliest
J J
storekeepers in the Barrier mining town ; and as the railway line was being pushed on
thither, they were large provisioners of the men engaged in its construction, Cockburn
being the principal distributing centre. In 1890 Messrs. Drew disposed of their retail
business, and Mr. Charles Drew took up his residence at Gilberton, near Adelaide, with
an office in Broken Hill Chambers. King William Street. Adelaide. Ihe firm was now
confined to the wholesale trade, having a large connection with the Barrier,
Mr. Charles Drew was among the early shareholders in the famous Broken Hill
cD J
Proprietary Mine, and was for a time on the directorate. He was also largely interested
in Western Australian gold mines, in which he proved himself a fearless investor, and
one whose support was ot material advantage to the industry.
In his later years Mr. Drew continued his liberal support of the Wesleyan Methodist
Church. He occupied all the offices open to a layman, and contributed largely out of his
wealth to various churches. He was a liberal supporter of missionary work, and, at
his own expense, fitted out a mission steam launch for work in the Fiji Islands. He
spent ,£2,000 in the erection of cottages for the shelter of impecunious pioneers, and was
a life member of the Children’s Hospital, a member of committee of the South Australian
Female Refuge, and Vice-president of the Council of the Zoological and Acclimatisation
Society.
When Mr. Charles Drew died at Gilberton in October, 1896, profound expressions
of regret came from various parts of the Province, and the bereaved family was afforded
ample evidence of the esteem in which the late gentleman was held. He had lived a
true and worthy life, and had given much for the weal and good of his fellows. He was
of a sturdy, shrewd, sympathetic type of character, and was a keen judge of his fellows
and their capabilities.
Mr, R. J. Coombs
DURING the harvest of the pastoralist, the firm of Messrs. R. J. Coombs & Co., was
in considerable prominence in South Australia. The firm is one of the principal
agencies for the receipt and sale of wool, and their auctions are largely attended
by buyers and sellers. Mr. R. J. Coombs, who was made a Justice of the Peace some
years ago, was born in Adelaide in August, 1853. He received early instruction at the
Rev. W. S. Moore’s Grammar School, and later tuition at St. Peter’s College. After serving
an apprenticeship to mercantile affairs for some years, he established, about 20 years ago, the
wool-broking firm of R. j. Coombs & Co., one of the most important concerns in that line
in the Province, Tor two years he occupied the mayoral chair of St. Peters municipality.

Hammer & Co., Photo MR. JOHN DUNN, sen.
The Dunn Family
IN the annals of South Australian commercial history no names stand forth more honorably
than those of Messrs. John Dunn, sen., John Dunn, jun., and E. W. Dunn. Eifty-
six years ago the senior member of this family established, in a quiet valley among
the hills, a modest enterprise which was destined to be the nucleus of an important local
industry. Out oi that small be-
ginning at Hay Valley, near Mount
Barker, grew a large business.
Ihe founder of this South
Australian house, John Dunn, sen.,
was born in the parish of Bondleigh,
Devon, on February 13, 1802.
He was one of a family of nine
sons and two daughters, and his
father was a small farmer. Owing-
o
to the limited opportunities afforded
to those of his class at that period,
the lad had but few schooldays.
f J
At the age of 10 years (three years
before Waterloo) John Dunn
became a farm servant, earning- a
salary of 6d. a week, or £ 1 6s.
per year. Even at this early
period the lad was interested in
milling pursuits. He watched the
corn garnered in the fields and
ground into flour by the primitive
machinery in use in his native
place. Upon the first opportunity
he gained employment about a
flourmill, and, after seven years, he
became manager of a small steam
mill at Bideford, Devon, at a wage of 15s. per week. Being thrifty and industrious, John
Dunn gradually improved his position with his opportunities, and in 1831 he married.
Five years later he owned a flourmill, subsequently adding farming to this pursuit. With
his training in farm work the young man, then in his prime, was admirably adapted for
colonising work. In May, 1840, he and his family sailed for the infant Province of South
Australia in the ship Lysander. Three brothers had preceded him thither : Charles founded
the Charleston district, and died at the age of 86 ; and George and Thomas farmed in
the Onkaparinga district. A fourth brother, William, followed in 1841, and a sister, the


late Mrs. Paltridge, in 1846. Finally the parents came to South Australia, and the father
lived to the ripe age of 82, while the mother died at 83.
John Dunn, sen., landed from the Lysander at Glenelg on September 6, 1840.
He looked about him before setting out in any particular occupation, and meanwhile was
employed by Messrs. Borrow & Goodiar. Eventually, in 1841, he purchased some land
near his brother’s property at Hay Valley, in the vicinity of Mount Barker. He cleared
and tilled several acres of ground, which he sowed with wheat. After his first harvesting,
he determined to combine with agriculture his favorite occupation of milling, and with his
own hands he accordingly erected a wind-mill, the remains of which are standing to-day.
Located in the Hay Valley, this contrivance managed in its time to grind a deal of corn,
and though it ground slowly, it did its work well. But it was too slow, so Mr. Dunn
sold it, and in 1844 he erected a steam mill at Mount Barker. Year by year passed in
quiet toil. The Province was recovering from the financial collapses of the early “ forties,”
and was gradually becoming the granary of Australia. The Onkaparinga district and
the country around supplied the chief proportion of the output ; and so prosperous was the
neighborhood, that population was attracted and substantial buildings were erected.
Meanwhile Mr. John Dunn’s flour, with that of the Ridleys, Harts, and Magareys, had
become the most popular brand in South Australia and the other colonies. In order the
more effectually to master the intricacies of machinery, Mr. Dunn associated himself wi th
J J
the late Mr. Ridley, and helped to construct the well-known Ridley reaper, which he
at once put to work on Mr. I). MacFarlane’s land at Mount Barker. During the first
20 years the milling operations flourished, and the Dunn mills became the most important
in the Province. In place of the primitive wind-mill, there were now i 1 steam flourmills,
which at the several periods of erection were fitted with the most advanced milling
machinery. Four hundred men were engaged to conduct them, apart altogether from the
extensive business of shipping wheat to Europe (which the firm combined with its
milling business), and the numerous agencies established outside the Province. In 1890
no less than 75,000 tons of wheat and flour were exported in one year by the firm, and
its product circulated in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, the Pacific
Islands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and other places.
From the beginning the business of Mr. Dunn thrived, and the trade w r as extensive.
Lie continued to be sole proprietor of the firm until 1852, when he admitted his son, John
Dunn, jun., into partnership, and with him into the firm came the late Mr. W. H. Dunn,
the late Mr. W. Hill (brother-in-law), and the late Mr. G. Shorney. Mr. W. H. Dunn
retired in 1875. and started farming in the North; while Mr. Hill died in 1885, and Mr.
Shorney in 1891. Three grandsons —Messrs. F. W., A. C., and E. A. A. Dunn were given
each an interest of their father’s share in the business towards the end of the “ eighties” ;
and in 1889 the venerable founder retired from the firm, leaving John Dunn, jun., sole
owner of the great house. That Mr. John Dunn, the elder, was enterprising and shrewd,
the large dimensions of his business amply testified. During his early sojourn at Hay
Valley he had evinced a sincere interest in the welfare of that district, and was distinguished
as an earnest supporter of Methodism. At the first election following the granting of a
Responsible Constitution to South Australia, on February 9, 1857, he was returned with

Mr. r. E. H. \\ . Krichauff to represent the Mount Barker District. He; had previously
been for some years a member and chairman of the Mount Barker District Council. It
may here be mentioned that the pioneer legislators for Mount Barker were wont to walk
over 20 miles to attend the sittings of the House. Mr. Dunn, successively with the
Hon. B. I. hinniss, Messrs. Allan MacFarlane and James Rankine, represented Mount
Barker in the Assembly until 1868. In that year he was first defeated ; but, upon a
petition, one of the candidates, Mr. W. Rogers, was unseated. Another election took
place, and Messrs. Dunn and John Cheriton were returned ; but, in the next month, Mr.
Dunn’s election, amid great excitement, was declared void. On March 19, 1869, when
the whole Province acted as one electorate, he was returned to the Legislative Council,
and sat until February, 1877. Mr. Dunn had thus passed 20 years in Parliament, and
during that period he was able to render good service to South Australia. He was
essentially a sensible legislator, and rendered useful help in the passage of the Torrens
Real Property Act.
Of the Wesleyan Church, Mr. John Dunn, sen., was an earnest adherent. P'or
decade after decade he served the denomination in many substantial ways, and in 1884 he
presented a church, costing £ 4,000, to the Mount Barker Circuit. He was a charitable
man, and during his later years distributed his money with an open hand. Among other
donations, he built a row of cottages at Mount Barker for the aged poor and infirm. The
veteran was spared to witness the growth of his enterprise with the expansion of the
Province. Upon his 80th birthday he was presented by the employes of the firm with an
illuminated address, and he was tendered another address when he retired from business in
1889. In consequence of the death of one of his sons a grand public demonstration,
arranged to celebrate his 90th birthday, was postponed for some months. When it was
held in 1892, Mr. Dunn testified his thankfulness by presenting a piece of land Dunn
Park- near the Mount Barker Railway Station to the people for recreation purposes.
At the same time he showed his gratefulness by giving sums of money to his employes,
many of whom had been associated with him for a- long term of years. On August 1,
[894, the Mount Barker mill presented a gay scene. But apart from the gaiety, it was
a unique occasion, the like of which seldom occurs anywhere in a young country. Ihe
firm of Dunn & Co. on that date attained its 50th birthday; and for half a century it had
uninterruptedly helped to supply the market. Besides the people of Mount Barker, there
were several representative citizens of Adelaide, and old pioneers, present at this gathering :
and for the last time the honored pioneer was seen in public. Ihe old gentleman, who seemed
much affected, was helped on to a platform amid the cheers of the sympathetic assemblage,
and he delivered a short and impressive address, during which he referred to the
establishment and growth of the firm. He related a few interesting reminiscences, and
then handed his grandson, Mr. F. W. Dunn, the title deeds of the property on which
they stood.
A few weeks later, on October 13, 1894, the founder died at his residence, The
Laurels, at the age of nearly 93 years ; and with him went one of those who helped to
establish the Province on a strong and sound foundation.
During the last 30 or 40 years Mr. John Dunn, jun., had been the most active


spirit in the house of Dunn & Co., and the chief representative of the family. He was
born at Bideford, Devon, in 1830, and accompanied his father to South Australia in 1840.
Mr. John Dunn, jun., was educated partly in England and partly in Australia, and in 1852,
when 22 years old, he became a partner in his father’s business. He felt a deep interest
in the welfare of the Wesleyan Church, and as a young' man devoted time and money to
J J o »
its service. Within 10 years, so lucrative was the business of John Dunn & Co., the
junior partner had acquired a competency, and rather than spend the whole of his life in
hoarding- up wealth, he chose to become a missionary. He severed his connection with
the house in 1862, and with his wife was appointed a missionary in the South Sea Islands,
having his station at Fiji. In those days this was a more dangerous undertaking than at
present, and the young couple literally took their lives in their hands. The work of the
Wesleyan Church in Fiji has no parallel in any country. There the tenets of that Church
seemed to seize readily upon the minds of the natives, and as a result the whole group
is now practically a Methodist one. To the fulfilment of this result, however, Mr. John
Dunn, jun., found he could contribute but little, owing to failing health, which compelled
him, within 12 months, to abandon missionary endeavor, and to return to Adelaide. He
rejoined his lather in business in 1864. after designing and erecting, on his own account,
a large mill at Port Adelaide. His engineering knowledge was of a high order, while
acute intelligence and foresight led him unerringly in the right direction. As with his
father, he devoted some years to politics. In 1875 he was returned to the House of
Assembly for Barossa, and in 1888 he entered the Legislative Council. He visited England
on three occasions—in 1866, 1878, and 1890 -and also travelled in the interests of his
firm to other countries. He was twice President of the Mill Owners’ Association of South
Australia, and at the time of his death was chairman of a number of Directorial Boards.
He was for many years a prominent member of the Kent d own Wesleyan Church, and
donated some ,£1,600 towards the liquidation of its debt. Mr. John Dunn, jun., predeceased
his father. He died at Port Augusta on P'ebruary 13, 1892, and the Press was filled with
eulogiums of him. He was buried in Adelaide, and his funeral was one of the largest
ever seen in the metropolis.
Mr. P'rederick Williams Dunn is the son of Mr. John Dunn, jun., and was born
at Fiji, when his parents were devoting themselves to missionary work. Three months
after his birth the family left the South Sea Islands, and returned to Adelaide. As a
boy, Mr. F. W. Dunn was educated at Prince Alfred College and St Peter’s Collegiate
School, finishing at Leys School, Cambridge, England, under the late Dr. Moulton. He
remained in the old country for three years, and then returned to South Australia in
1881, via America. Mr. F. W. Dunn inspected the largest mills in America, devoting
especial attention to those at Minneapolis, a great centre of milling operations.
Upon his arrival in South Australia, the young man went to the mills at Port
Adelaide, took off his coat, and began to acquire practical experience of every branch
of the business, working personally in each department with the employes. He
then assisted his father in planning and supervising the erection of new mills the firm were
having built at Hawker and Wolseley. In 1885, to extend his knowledge, and with a
view to trade, he visited California, and sedulously investigated the newest methods of


milling on the Pacific Coast. A complete plant was then purchased for a mill at Port
Augusta, and after several months’ study, he made his way back to Adelaide. In 1889
the firm sent him on a tour of inspection to the other colonies. He visited all the
principal ports on the south and eastern coasts, from Port Adelaide to Port Darwin, and
from the latter place he went to Java, Hong Kong, and Japan to enquire into the
feasibility of opening up new trade centres. For some years prior to the death of his
father he had the responsible duty of chartering ships to carry wheat and flour to the
ports of consignment, and in one season he chartered a fleet of no fewer than 33 grain
vessels for the United Kingdom. On the death of his father in 1892, he became chief
manager of the business. Following the example of his father and grandfather, Mr.
b. \\ . Dunn is an earnest adherent of the Wesleyan Church, and for some years filled
* J
the office of treasurer of the. Kent Town Church. He has been chairman of the
Corn 1 rade Sectional Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, director of the South
British Insurance Company, and is on the Committee of the Chamber of Manufactures.
I hough nominally partners, the three sons mentioned were the executors of their
father, the late Mr. John Dunn, jun. Since then the mills from time to time have been
disposed of, so that the old family no longer retains any interest in them.
The late Mr. Martin Burgess
o
MR. THOMAS BURGESS settled in this Province in 1848, and died much respected
22 years ago. His eldest son, Martin Burgess, was born in Cheshire in j 837, and
accompanied his parents to Australia. The family first proceeded to the Burra
Burra Copper Mines, then just becoming renowned throughout the world for their wonderful
wealth. In 1856 Mr. Thomas Burgess removed to Noarlunga, where he and his son conducted
a storekeeping business. Father and son remained together for a number of years, and
in 1873 Mr. M. Burgess joined the late James Clark, and, under the name of fames Clark
and Co., conducted a milling and chaffcutting business. In 1884, the partnership being-
dissolved, Mr. Burgess removed to Adelaide, and, in partnership with Mr. George Muo-a,
*■A A O
became a produce dealer and wood and coal merchant. He continued in this capacity
until 1891, when he became Secretary of the National Defence League. In 1895 this
body was merged into the Australasian National League, Mr. Burgess continuing as Secretary
of the South Australian division of the corporation, which has branches throughout the
Province. Mr. Burgess took a lively interest in friendly societies, and filled all the offices
both in the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows and in the Ancient Order
of Foresters, having been a member of each community since 1858. He was on the
Board of Directors of the former, and was Chairman of the Investment Committee of the
Oddfellows’ Society. He was also a Director of the City Permanent Building Society.
Mr. Burgess died at his residence, at Malvern, on December 31, 1900. He was a most
valuable colonist, and possessed great talent for diplomatic administration.

Mr. Henry Dutton
VERY Australian colony has its aristocrats, who are also its large landed proprietors.
But they are not drones in the hive, as they personally supervise the management of
their estates. To this class belongs the subject of this notice. Henry Dutton
comes of a well-known Australian family. He was born at Richmond, Victoria, in 1848,
and is a grandson of a British
Consul in Holland, and son of
the late Mr. William Hampden
Dutton, who was prominently
connected with pastoral stations in
New South Wales. It is of im-
portance to this memoir to record
that Mr. W. H. Dutton induced
his brother, Mr. F. 11. Dutton, to
come to South Australia in 1841.
He enabled him to engage in
pastoral pursuits in the Province.
Mr, F. H. Dutton went into
partnership with the late Captain
Bagot, and became possessed of
the Koonunga Station at Kapunda.
In the following: year Mr. F. S.
O J
Dutton and Mr. C. S. Bagot (a son
of Captain Bagot), while searching
for some sheep on the property,
found samples of copper ore, and
the locality therefrom became
famous for the Kapunda Copper
Mines. Mr. F. S, Dutton, who
acquired considerable wealth from
this discovery, was a man of un-
doubted ability, and rose to the
most influential offices in South
Australia. He was possessed ol a good commercial knowledge, gained chiefly in Brazil and
Rio de Janeiro, and was proficient in languages. After leaving South America he joined
his brother in New South W ales, and, as in the case of Mr. F. H. Dutton, at his suggestion
came to South Australia in 1841. In 1849 he was appointed one of the Board of City
Commissioners —the forerunner of the present Corporation of Adelaide- and was re-appointed
in 1851. Mr. F. S. Dutton was for years a prominent legislator, and was Commissioner of
Crown Lands in the Hanson Ministry of 1857. In 1863, and again in 1865, he was Premier
of the Province. Upon his retirement he was appointed Agent-General in London, the


duties of which position he discharged with zeal and intelligence up to the time of his
death in January, 1877- He had the dignity of C.M.G. conferred upon him.
In 1843 the partnership between Captain Bagot and Mr. F. H. Dutton was
dissolved, and the latter founded a new head station on the same property, at that time
known as 1 udna, but which he called Anlaby, after a village in Yorkshire of that name.
I his magnificent estate comprises about 70,000 acres of some of the best land in South
Australia, and is one of the most complete in the Province. It is of this fine estate that
Mi. Henry Dutton is now proprietor. He came to South Australia as a boy, and was
educated at St. Peters College. Upon leaving school he received an appointment in the
Bank of South Australia in Adelaide, and was lor nearly 50 years associated with that
... J KJ J
institution. He was for some years Manager of the Mount Pleasant branch, but resigned in
1890. In that year his uncle, Mr. F. H. Dutton, died in England, and Mr. Henry Dutton
o J
succeeded to Anlaby. Mr. P. H. Dutton had practically resided in England since 1853,
although he visited the Province for a few months in iBsB and in 1868. Anlaby was
• • - J
originally stocked with a fine strain of sheep, and this Mr. h. H. Dutton constantly improved
by importations. On four different occasions he purchased for the estate valuable merino
rams in Germany, and from these the present Hocks are descended. It has been the
object of the management to obtain an even standard of wool rather than to rear
prize-taking animals, hence the property has been highly remunerative. Stud sheep of fine
quality produced there have been purchased by other breeders, so that Anlaby, apart from
its charming scenery and handsome residence, is noted throughout the Province.
There have been four managers of the property on behalf of the Duttons uncle
and nephew - and these gentlemen have made it their peculiar care to improve the
property in consonance with the wishes of the owners. The first manager was Mr. A.
Buchanan, the second Mr. H. T. Morris, the third Mr. P. M. Miller, and the present, Mr.
May oh Miller, son of the last named.
Many years ago Mr. F. H. Dutton took up the Callana lease, of 1,000 square miles,
near Hergott, but owing to the uncertainty of the rainfall, deemed it advisable to surrender it
to the Government. With Mr. John Melrose, Mr. Henry Dutton is owner of North Booborowie.
a valuable and well-grassed property of about 35,000 acres, situated some 12 miles from the
Burra. He is thus a pastoralist on a large scale. In addition to his residence at Anlabv,
where he and his wife have been enthusiastic floriculturists, having taken prizes in Adelaide
for their blooms, Mr. Dutton has purchased at Unley Park, near Adelaide, a large mansion,
surrounded by about 22 acres of land, which is called “ Miegunyah,” (the native name
for “ my home ”).
Mr. Dutton is a Justice of the Peace, a member of the Pastoralists’ Association
and a man of local influence. He is a Fellow of the Colonial and Imperial Institute, and
a liberal-handed member of the Church of England. He built a church at Hamilton, near
Anlaby, and presented it to the parish in memory of his only daughter. He contributed
largely to the building fund of the Anglican Cathedral in Adelaide. He is a member
of the Synod, and a lay reader, frequently officiating in the churches in the absence of
the clergyman. A member of one of the oldest and chief families, he does not forget his
duties to the community.

Mr. John Harvey Fin lay son
IN controlling the literary department of the South Australian Register through many
trying years, Mr. Finlayson proved himself to be one of our most enlightened and
capable citizens. His energy, perspicuity, and intimate acquaintance with local affairs
have been of the greatest service to the paper and to the public, whose interest it is its
aim to promote. Ihe editor of a
widely-circulating newspaper, as he
sits, unseen, in his sanctum, may
he compared to the hidden steam
that moves the engine ; and it is
to be remarked of the subject of
this notice that in his literary
capacity he has shown himself
perfectly content to merge his
identity in the paper with which
he is associated.
Mr. J. H. Finlayson, who is
of Scotch parentage, was born on
February 3. 1843, at “ Helen-
holme,” Mitcham, South Australia.
11 is father (the late Mr. William
Finlayson, who arrived in the
Province in February, 1837, fired
with a desire to evangelise the
aborigines of the Province) had
been engaged in farming since
1840. Thus Mr. Finlayson, like
two of his partners, is descended
from a pioneer colonist. He first
attended the school of the late
Mr. George Mugg, at whose feet
several young men, who have
afterwards occupied prominent positions in South Australian public life—notably the Hon.
Thomas Playford, ex-Premier and ex-Agent-General—-learnt their first school lessons
J ’ O
He proved an apt scholar, and in due course imbibed all the knowledge that his teacher
could impart. At the age of 16 years he entered the Adelaide Educational Institution,
conducted by the late Mr. J. L. Young, also distinguished for its successful pupils. By-
dint of much natural ability and close application to his studies, he made his mark in this
establishment, carrying off prizes in many subjects, including Latin, German, Geometry,
Political Ivconomy, Moral Philosophy, Geography, History, and English Composition. It
is noteworthy that Mr. Finlayson warmly recognises his obligation to Mr. Young, an


exceptionally liberal-minded and high-principled man, for much of his success in life.
Shortly aitei leaving school, Mr. hinlayson was appointed to the literary staff of the Register
by the then editor, the late Mr Anthony borster. He entered upon his journalistic duties
in December, iS6t, and has been connected with the Register and its allied newspapers
ever since. His chief characteristics as a reporter consisted in his extraordinary capacity
for hard work and in the keen interest he took in public affairs ; and the reward of his
industry and proved aptitude for journalistic work was not long in coming. In 1866 —five
years after his first appointment—upon the death of Mr. Patrick Parkinson, he became
chief of the reporting staff. His rise in his profession was rapid ; and during the career,
as chief leader-writer of the Register, of Mr. W. R. Lawson—afterwards editor of a
journal in Scotland, and at present a financial authority on the London Stock Exchange—
he became assistant leader-writer, acting in a similar capacity when the late respected Mr.
J. Howard Clark assumed the editorial control. In 1876 he visited the United States,
England, and the Continent, primarily as the representative of the Register at the Philadelphia
Exhibition, and, under instructions, appointed correspondents in New York and the leading
capitals ot Plurope. Some of these, such as Mr. W. L. Alden and Mr. Beattie Kingston,
were men of especial brilliancy. While in the States, Mr. Finlayson travelled to and
fro, contributing instructive and entertaining articles to his paper.
During Mr. Einlayson’s absence on this occasion, Mr. E. W. Andrews, one of
the proprietors of the Register , died in South Australia, and Mr. Finlayson, together
with Mr. R. Kyfifin Thomas and the late Mr. Charles Day, who had also for many
j
years been prominently associated with the paper, received an offer of partnership on
advantageous terms. On his return to the Province he accepted the offer, and became
assistant editor. In the course of the next 15 months, both of the old proprietors. Mr.
W. K. I homas and Mr. J, Howard Clark, died, and the management devolved upon the
three new members. When Mr. Day retired a few years ago, Messrs. Finlayson and
Thomas became sole proprietors; but on July 1, 1899, Mr. W. j. Sowden (Mr. P'inlayson’s
successor in the editorship of the Register ) and Mr. E. Kyffin Thomas were admitted to
the proprietary.
Upon the death of Mr. Clark, Mr. Finlayson took charge of the editorial
department —a work for which he had been prepared by the duties falling upon him during
the lengthy illness of the former occupant. It may be here mentioned that a long list of
able men, who attained considerable fame in South Australia, had preceded him in the
chair; and it would have been very natural for him to feel burdened with the sense of
a heavy responsibility. But his clear insight, excellent judgment, and vigorous pen sustained
him, and the Register continued as vital a force as before.
It is a mere act of justice to say that Mr. Finlayson has very materially affected
the political history of the Province, and considerably extended the influence of the journal
he so ably conducted. Many of the legislative successes for which those prominently engaged
in the political arena have received the chief, if not the sole, credit are traceable to
him. In particular, he played an important part in securing the adoption of the admirable
system of public elementary education now in force in the Province. As Premier of a
Ministry connected with an influential Parliamentary Club established in Adelaide more


than a quarter of a century ago, he succeeded, with the help of Air. (afterwards Sir) J.
C. Bray, in passing a Bill containing the principles of the measure now in operation.
Subsequently, in conjunction with Air. David Murray and others, he founded an Education
Eeague, which pressed upon Parliament the necessity for reform in the direction of free,
secular, and compulsory education ; and the Bill to establish such a system, introduced by
Air. Ebenezer Ward, a member of the Boucaut Government, had his strenuous advocacy.
In 1897 Air. Einlayson revisited England and the Continent, Mr. W. J. Sowden
relieving him as editor. During the greater part of 1898 he acted as London correspondent
for the Register. He was commissioned a Justice of the Peace in 1880. He returned
to South Australia in 1899, but only for the purpose of settling up his affairs, having arranged
to act permanently as the principal London representative of the Register , which post
he now fills.
Although several times asked to stand for Parliament, Mr. Einlayson has declined,
o ’ J
chiefly because he deemed it desirable to hold aloof from the Legislature while exercising
literary control over a daily newspaper of strong political views. He was, for many years
after its inception, a member of the North Adelaide School Board of Advice. He evinced
an earnest interest in charitable work, and, largely through his instrumentality and that
of Air. W. J. Sowden, the practice of giving special help to the poor at Christmas time
was established, as well as the plan of special visitations during the same season to orphanages
and other philanthropic institutions. He served on the South Australian Commission of the
Adelaide Jubilee Exhibition and of the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition. He was for
many years a regular attendant at the Stow Memorial Congregational Church.

The Edwin Davey Family
AMONG the leading representatives of the milling industry of South Australia is the
Davey family, ol Angaston, Eudunda, Salisbury, and Adelaide. Mr. Edwin Davey,
the father and founder, came to South Australia from England some 50 years ago,
when about 10 years of age. A portion of his education was imparted locally, and when
old enough he went into farming pursuits at Angaston. After an experience in this
occupation, about 32 years ago he branched out into milling operations at Penrice, near
Angaston. He next opened a mill at Eudunda, under the management of his eldest son,
Mr. Arnold Edwin Davey. As his sons grew up, Mr. Edwin Davey took them into
partnership under the name of If cl win Davey & Sons. Besides the father, the partners
are Messrs. A. E., Thomas H., Maurice C., G. A., and B. J. Davey. At the headquarters
of the firm in Currie Street, Adelaide, the products of the branch mills are sold, and from
here shipments to other countries are made. The three country mills are replete with
improved roller-milling machinery. Air. Maurice Davey manages the Angaston mill, Mr.
G. A. Davey the Eudunda, and Mr. B. j. Davey the Salisbury, while the two eldest sons
JJj J ’
supervise operations generally at headquarters, Adelaide. All the partners in the firm are
shrewd business men of proved integrity.

Mr. H. D. Cell
ADIS I INCUISHINC feature of the latter half of the nineteenth century is to be
found in the increase of educational facilities. By the aid of certain institutions, the
poor as well as the rich are able to obtain a most liberal education, to follow
contemporary literature in periodicals and books, and to have entrv to a library of a class
that at the beginning of the
century was open only to the
wealthiest. 1 his great beneficial
<7
change a veritable revolution in
educational methods - - has been
wrought by the formation of public
libraries, and what are popularly
known in Australia as mechanics’
institutes.
In founding these and other
useful institutions in South Aus-
tralia, Mr. H. 1). Cell has been
especially active. Harry Dickson
Cell, who was gazetted a Justice
of the Peace in 1884, was born
in Chelsea, England, in 1845, a nd
arrived in South Australia in
September, 1849, with his parents.
His father, Mr. Charles Cell, was
M anager for the then well-known
firm of Morewood & Rogers,
inventors and patentees of
galvanised iron. At the age of
o
13 years, H. 1). Cell became
cashier at Hamilton Bros.’ store,
Port Adelaide. Two years later
he proceeded to the Wallaroo
district, and this was soon after the copper mines were discovered. He filled several positions
on the Peninsula, and in 1866 went to Robe, in the South-East, under engagement to
o o
Messrs. Ormerod & Co., shipping' and general merchants. He was associated with this firm
for several years, after which he joined Kingsborough & Chapman, in Adelaide, and
continued with them until 1874. In that year he became Secretary of the City Permanent
Building Society, a position which he retains in connection with that of an accountant, and a
land, estate, and general commission agent. In all these capacities he has pursued a career
notable for its integrity and openness.
But it is to the educational work with which Mr. Cell has identified himself that


this biographical sketch must be mainly devoted. Although he started out in business at
so young an age, his studious disposition and earnest intention to improve his mind while
other youths were at play caused him to become a man of superior parts. He conceived
a love for mental and moral improvement, and this desire has not staled in the course of
years. He became a well-read man, and one who took a serious view of life and its
duties. He was also possessed of a talent for translating his opinions and his knowledge
into clear language. While at Wallaroo he agitated to establish a weekly half-holiday, also
for the limitation of the hours of daily labor ; and in these efforts he was successful. He
was practically the founder of the former movement, which has since had effect in nearly
every township in South Australia. He was also secretary of the organisation constituted to
inaugurate the movement.
In the records, also, of mechanics’ institutes and literary societies in the Province,
Mr. Cell’s name is deserving of an honored place. With his earnestness of character, and
in appreciation of the pleasures which he has derived in the study of literature, he seeks
to popularise these elevating and improving institutions. He was an earnest advocate for the
establishment of the Wallaroo Mechanics’ Institute, and was one of its founders, as well as its
first secretary. The benefits so apparent from these efforts in that district strengthened his
purpose elsewhere, and, while at Robe, he took an active part in securing the erection
of the present Mechanics’ Institute there, of which he was the first secretary. When
he went to reside at Glenelg, Mr. Cell joined the literary society established in that town,
the membership of which embraced some of the brightest minds of that seaside resort. He
was for ten years president of this societv. He has since rendered great assistance to similar
JIJ < i
organisations elsewhere. He was one of the founders ol the South Australian Literary
Societies’ Union, which was established in 1882, and was for ten years associated with the
executive in various capacities. He became President of the Union, and in 1886-7 was
its I reasurer. He was for some time President, and afterwards Vice-President, of the
Glenelg Institute. Tor nearly a quarter of a century he has been identified with the
Congregational Church at Glenelg, and with its Sunday-school as teacher or superintendent.
He was for some time on the Committee of the Young Men’s Christian Association. He
is an ardent follower ot the noble fraternity of Freemasons, and has held office in the
Grand Lodge for the past ten years, for nine of which he has been on the Board of
General Purposes. He has filled the office of Grand Lecturer for three years, and that of
Auditor for eight years. He was a Worshipful Master in the MacDonnell Lodge, and
represents Victoria in the Grand Lodge. In 1886 he was elected to the Committee of
the Adelaide Co-operative Society, and has assisted in the establishment of similar societies
at Gawler, Penola, Wadnaminga, and Port Adelaide. He also assisted in founding the
0 o
South Australian Mutual Stores. He was complimented for his business acumen during the
1 O
financial crisis associated with the name of the Town and Country Bank. He was
appointed to the investigating committee, and was chairman for three years. He largely
OO J j
influenced the successful settlement of affairs, and the establishment of the assets company
in connection therewith.
Not long after going to Glenelg to reside, Mr. Cell was elected, in 1879, to the
Glenelg Council, a position which he held for five years, for two of which he occupied the
460
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY MIHDGeII


mayoral chair ; and it was mainly through his exertions at that time the mail steamers put
into Glenelg for two years longer than was intended. In 1885-6 Mr. Cell was Vice-President
of the Municipal Association of South Australia. Mr. Gell twice essayed to enter the
Legislative Assembly for the District of Sturt ; but both times he was defeated, though
only by small majorities.
Ihe governing purpose of Mr. Gell’s life has apparently been that of improving
the mental and moral standing of the people ; and he undoubtedly has the satisfaction of
knowing that his disinterested efforts in this direction have borne good fruit. The earnestness,
frankness, and simplicity of Mr. Gell's character make him exceedingly popular wherever he
is known.
Mr. Thomas Robert Bright
MR. BRIGHT was born at Gawler on March 15, 1852. In his early days educational
advantages were rare, but the parents of Mr. Bright, observing the signs of ability
in their son, exercised a wise forethought in this matter, and the best opportunities
afforded in the Province were availed of. Mr. Bright was sent first to the school conducted
by Mr. L. S. Burton, whence he passed to Mr. J. M. Mitchell's Colonial Piducational
Institute. On leaving school he was articled, in the year 1867, to Mr. F. F. Turner, solicitor,
who at present fills the post of Solicitor to the Lands and Pities Commissioners, Registrar-
General, etc. After some time spent with Mr. Turner, he served under Messrs. Way& Brook,
a firm which possessed at its head the future Chief Justice and Lieutenant-Governor of
South Australia. Having completed his articles, Mr. Bright was admitted to the Bar, and
shortly afterwards commenced practice at Clare, which was at that time the trade centre
of the Northern Areas. Mr. Bright’s ability as a barrister soon won for him a wide
connection, and he built up a practice which became in a very brief time the
largest north of Adelaide. While in Clare Mr. Bright exhibited considerable Interest
in public matters, with the result that the ratepayers placed him in the honorable
and responsible position of Mayor, and he was asked to stand for Parliament,
Mr. P. P. Gillen, who was afterwards to obtain fame as Commissioner of Crown Lands
in the Kingston Ministry, offering to retire in his favor. Mr. Bright was, however,
determined to stand aloof from politics, and he declined the proffered honor. This decision
he adhered to, although the request was afterwards repeated. After a period of 15 years
spent at Clare, Mr. Bright decided to try a city practice. Mr. Bright's energies, after his
removal to Adelaide, were devoted more particularly to mining law, and in this branch he
has excelled. As an able solicitor and barrister, a citizen of integrity and active
energy, and as a genial and courteous gentleman, Mr. Bright reflects credit upon the
Province which gave him birth.

Mr. Charles H. Goode
NO one is better known in Adelaide commercial and philanthropic circles than Mr.
Charles H. Goode. It could be said of him that the face is the window of the
soul ; that the benevolence of the one gives fit expression to the kindness and
sincerity of the other Popular, and generally esteemed for his disinterested generosity,
Mr. Goode has a peculiar claim to
be biographically noticed in this
work.
Mr. Charles H. Goode is a
native of Hinton, Herefordshire,
England, and was born in 1827.
At the age of 12 years he was
apprenticed to a drapery business
in Hereford. As a mere child, he
was getting an insight into the
serious sides of life, its struggles
and aspirations ; and no doubt the
experiences gained at so impres-
sionable an age helped to mould
the sympathetic and sincere nature
for which he has since become
noted. Goethe has told us that
one serves an apprenticeship in
the ways of the world, and showed
us the true meaning of life ; and,
in a double sense, Mr. Goode
entered this sphere when very
young. In 1845, when relieved
of his duty to the Hereford
draper, he proceeded to London,
where he remained for nearly four
years. Then, in 1849, he freed
himself from the congested population of England, and came to South Australia, arriving
in April. In the freshness and potentiality of a new country, with all its greatness
and success before it, a youno- man of earnestness and industry has a fair chance to
j o -
attain to a good position. In conjunction with his friend (afterwards brother-in-law), the
late Mr. Thomas Good, Mr. Charles H. Goode opened a general soft goods business in
Kermode Street, North Adelaide. The population in that locality was small, but with the
development of the Province it constantly increased. Mr. T. Good having retired, Mr.
C. H. Goode was joined by his brothers, Samuel and Mathew; and for 30 years their
affairs prospered and their wealth increased. From the small house in North Adelaide


they graduated and opened warehouses in Rundle Street, Stephens Place, and Grenfell
Street ; and ultimately the ramifications of their business embraced most of the settled
parts of South Australia. The partnership of Goode Brothers was dissolved in 1882, and
the subject of this memoir then joined in business an old friend of many years’ standing,
Mr. W. H. D urrant, of London. Mr. \\ . H. bite next entered into the partnership, retiring
some years ago. Under the style of Goode, Durrant, & Co., the old trade connection
was augmented, and the business continued to flourish. Besides the South Australian
establishments, it now has branches in London, Broken Hill (New South Wales), and Western
Australia, and their house is one of the most progressive in the colonies.
On different occasions Mr. Goode has visited England, and on one of these an
incident occurred of some interest. While, in 1859, the Northam , a P. & O. steamer, in
which he and his wife were voyaging, was proceeding through the Red Sea, she struck
J O O I o o
the Shah Buryer Reef, and stuck fast at a dangerous angle. So serious was the position
that the passengers were rowed to the island of Myetta, where, for four days, they remained
beneath a tropical sun, which burnished the desolate sand-patches in dazzling discomfort.
I hey lived on scanty fare until the steamer was refloated. Mr. Goode remained in England
at this period for four years, supervising and extending the connections of his business.
He returned to South Australia in 1863. Shortly afterwards he was elected to the House
of Assembly for blast Torrens, obtaining the largest number of votes that had, up to that
time, been polled by any politician in South Australia. The disastrous effects of the civil
war in America were felt even in Australia. For one thing, cotton fell in consequence in
price from 2s. 6d. to 6d. per lb. ; and it was feared that, because of this serious drop, leading
South Australian soft goods merchants would be ruined. Mr. Goode foresaw the probability,
and in 1866 resigned his seat in Parliament, and took to the roads as a commercial traveller
on behalf of his firm. He was moved to do this not so much by the fear of losing his
own money as that of other people. By the exercise of keen insight and industry, however,
his house weathered the storm. In 1867 he again went to England, and he then remained
in the old country for 12 years, managing the London branch of the business. In 1879
he returned to the land of his adoption, not visiting England again until 1898, when he
remained in the home land for eight months.
The foregoing account conveys a slight impression of the success Mr. Goode and
his brothers obtained in the local business world by their own efforts and owing to their high
character. Mr. Goode’s integrity and honesty are well known in South Australia and among
his business connections in the old world. He has also distinguished himself by his efforts in
the interests of charity. In his earlv manhood he evinced a warm interest in relimous
and philanthropic matters, and succeeding years have served to ripen and expand that laudable
enthusiasm. There is nothing lukewarm about him ; what he applies himself to do, he
does whole-heartedly. His geniality, combined with his sincerity, win him good opinion
in all his endeavors. In England and in Adelaide, as a young man, he devoted considerable
time to succoring the unfortunate and the poor. While in the old country, during the
1867-79 period, he was treasurer of Dr. Landel’s Church, Regent’s Park, London, and
a member of the committee of public institutions, including the original Field Lane Ragged
Schools and Regent’s Park College. The sincerity of his desire to help the poor was
463
Mr. c. H. Goode ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


manifested by his crusades on their behalf in the highways and byways of London. In
South Australia he has been one of the most active and hardworking colonists on the
managerial boards of philanthropic bodies. He has held more offices in these spheres
than perhaps any other man ; and he gives his time and his money ungrudgingly to such noble
causes. He has sat on several Royal Commissions, and among them the Destitute Act
Commission, whose sittings extended over two years. P'rom the work of the Commission
the State Children’s Council came into being, of which governing body Mr. Goode is a
member. He is especially enthusiastic in his devotion to the young, whose welfare and
character he watches most zealously. He has been President of the Y. M. C. A., and is
called the “G. O. M.” among- the Sunday-school teachers. He has devoted some so years
of his life to this work, and has been for 20 years President of the Young M en’s Bible
Class at the blinders Street Baptist Church, Adelaide. Of other bodies, he has been
Chairman of the North Adelaide Institute, and member of committee of the Children’s
Hospital, the Belair Retreat, the Convalescent Home, and the Strangers’ Friend Society.
1 he Industrial School for the Blind, of which he has been president, largely owes its existence
to him.
He is on the committee of the District Trained Nursing Society, which provides,
free of cost, experienced nurses for the poor. Some years ago an important bequest, called
“The James Brown Trust,” came into existence. The late Mrs. J. Brown, widow of a
prominent South Australian pastoralist, left the sum of ,£IOO,OOO for the purpose of founding
an institution for supporting the aged blind and crippled, as well as orphans and consumptives.
Mr. Goode was appointed on the Trust, and, upon the death of the late Mr. A. Adamson, was
elected chairman thereof. The refuge known as Estcourt House was established under
this Trust, and there many a crippled child and aged blind person finds a comfortable
home and obtains kindly treatment. Of the Blind and Deaf and Dumb Institution he
has been an earnest supporter. At an annual meeting of the last-named Institution, the
Chief Justice, Sir Samuel J. Way, Bart., passed a well-deserved eulogium upon him in
these words : —“ Ihe father of the Industrial School for the Blind in North Adelaide
was his honored friend, Mr. C. H. Goode. . . . Mr. Goode had done many things to
be proud of, but he looked upon his services for the Industrial School for the Blind as
the top-stone of his work.”
He is on the committee of the Adult Deaf and Dumb Mission, which holds
Divine service every Sunday in Gouger Street, in such a manner that the afflicted people
can understand it. Ihe work of the mission is thoroughly unsectarian and unique in the
Southern Hemisphere. It provides a residence for a missionary and rooms for visitors,
and is free from debt.
1 o all these numerous institutions Mr. Goode has been a father in their establishment
and successful management. He has assisted them very materially with donations, and
supported them financially in a substantial manner. Mr. Goode has been a fervent supporter
of the Baptist Church and of missionary endeavors in foreign lands. Indeed, his goodness
and liberality are not confined to his own city or Province or denomination, but extend to
many climes and sects. There are few men in Adelaide so justly esteemed and beloved.
He is a Justice of the Peace, and all classes, rich or poor, look upon him as a true and
hearty friend.

Mr. Thomas Grose
The citizen who builds up an industry, and who also brings prudence and sense to
the senate-house or the council-chamber, deserves to rank high in public estimation.
Of such, the earlier Parliaments and Councils of England were composed. Each
member was a man of standing among his fellows, and the days of professional politicians
had not arrived. A Parliament
constituted principally of country
gentlemen farming their own land,
o o
was so strong and united as to
defy a king, declaring war against
him and brinmno- it to a success-
o O
ful issue.
The history of Port Adelaide
contains the record of many men
who may be compared to that
old class. Among them is Mr.
Thomas Grose, who has repre-
sented the Centre Ward of that
town for eight years, and in
December, 1898, was elected to
the mayoralty without opposition.
Thomas Grose was born at St.
Just, West Penzance, Cornwall, in
1837, and was a schoolfellow and
playfellow there of his future
brother-in-law and partner, the late
Mr. William Thomas. After
obtaining some considerable
amount of education at private
schools in St. Just, Mr. Grose, in
addition to some mining experi-
ence, learned the trade of a
blacksmith, which enabled him in after years to carry his proficiency to the status of
a practical engineer and boilermaker. At the age of 28 he accompanied his friend Mr. Thomas
to South Australia, arriving at Port Adelaide in the ship Peeress in the year 1865. Soon
after reaching the Province, Mr. Grose obtained employment with Mr. Robert Lindsay, of
Carron Iron Works, and it was in this employment he extended his trade knowledge to
1 J o
the more intricate branches of engineering and ironfounding. His proficiency in these
departments was soon rewarded with the foremanship of the foundry, a position which he
filled with credit for a period of 12 years. The knowledge of practical engineering which
Mr. Grose thus obtained enabled him, in his subsequent career as a public man, to render,


on more than one occasion, valuable service to the trade of the Port and Province. As
a general rule, vessels requiring repairs of any magnitude wait for them to be made
on reaching Melbourne or Sydney, ignoring Port Adelaide as not possessing proper facilities
for the work. On several occasions, however, Mr. Grose has persuaded masters of vessels
to forego this practice ; and he has executed the desired repairs with such exactness and
ingenuity as convinced shippers that Port Adelaide was not lacking in the necessary facilities,
in this way materially benefiting that branch of trade. Mr. Grose also superintended many
large engineering works, and established a high reputation for the firm with which he was
connected. In 1878 he resigned his position under Mr. Robert Lindsay, and with his
brother-in-law, Mr. I homas, visited England, purchased a milling plant, and established
the business that has since occupied an important place in Australian trade. The partnership
continued until the death ot Mr. I homas in 1891, and the business is still carried on, under
the name ot I homas & Co., by Mr. Henry Thomas, a son of the former partner, in
conjunction with Mr. Grose.
As a public man lor many years past, Mr. Grose has helped considerably in shaping
Portonian history. In 1890 he entered the Port Adelaide Town Council as the representative
of the Centre \\ ard, and has served that section of the municipality with fidelity ever since.
1 he revolution in the conduct of the Council’s business, its officership, and other matters,
has been largely due to his unwearied efforts. His election to the mayoralty has also proved
ot service to the municipality, for many years he has been prominently associated with
liberal and democratic associations promoted for the purpose of encouraging public discussion
tlj litical. Both in public and private life Mr. Grose has ever maintained
the character of a candid, upright, and intelligent citizen.
Mr. James Duncan
MR. JAMES DUNCAN ot the coachbuilding and wheelwrighting firm of Duncan
and Fraser, was born at Rothesay, Scotland, February 28, 1840. He learnt his
trade as a “body maker” in coachbuilding under his uncles, Messrs. N. & I).
McConechy. At the age of 19 years Mr. Duncan came to Adelaide, South Australia, and
three years later went into partnership with Mr. Fraser, as a coachbuilder, the firm
continuing in existence to this day. Mr. Fraser died some years ago. and Mr. Duncan,
with his sons, now controls affairs. The business is now one of the largest industries of the
kind in South Australia. They have manufactured tram cars in use in Ballarat (Victoria),
and in Adelaide, and they also build bicycles. Mr. Duncan, who is a Justice of the
I eace, is an cx-I lesident of the Chamber of Manufactures, and more recently took an
extremely active interest in the question of federation. He was President of the
Central Committee of the Commonwealth Bill League, and did his utmost to secure
the acceptance of that measure by the electors.

Mr. Caleb George Gurr
THE best business man is a busy man on all occasions. In the hours set apart for
his duties he does not waste his time in idle discussions on abstract theories. His
interests demand his earnest attention. The interests of his clients are included
in his own, and he throws his whole soul into them. He lives two lives ; his business
life, and his social and home life—
a wide line of demarcation lying
between the two. In the interests
of his business he forgets all else ;
O ’
while into his social and home
existence he never allows business
to enter.
Mr. Caleb Georoe Gurr, a
o
typical business man, was born in
Adelaide in 1856, and was educated
at the private establishment of Mr.
T. Burgan, who tutored quite a
number of prominent South Aus-
tralians. His first essay in the
working world was as a clerk in a
solicitor’s office. The mustiness of
legal tomes and legal arithmetic
possessed no particular attraction
for him, and he entered the Post
Office Department. He remained
in the Civil Service for several
years, gaining a good official educa-
tion, but one hardly comparable with
that obtained in an active and up-to-
date business house. Certainly, the
clerk is able to form some conception
of how State business is carried on,
but he gets only a superficial view for many years ; and when he may be said to have mastered
the whole routine, he is often too old or mechanically unfit for more active duties. Mr. Gurr
became accountant in the firm of Henning, Bruce, Sc Aldridge, leading auctioneers in
Adelaide. He proved himself so adept in his work that, on their retirement from premises
in Grenfell Street, he, with Mr. [. G. Jenkins, the present Chief Secretary, became the
owner of this large auctioneering business. In 1887, the Hon. J. G. Jenkins, having
accepted office as a Minister of the Crown, retired from the firm, and Mr. Gurr took over
the whole control and possession of the concern, which has now been in existence for 20
years. Mr. Gurr carries on a large auctioneering, land, and real estate agency business.


Lor some years Mr. Curr was associated with the Unley Municipal Council as
auditor for the Corporation, and for several later years as representative for the Fullarton
Ward. His knowledge of the district and its internal interests has conduced to make him
a valuable member, and his advice on civic administration has been appreciated as well by
his brother councillors as by ratepayers. In 1891 he was elected Mayor of Unley by a
large majority of the townsmen, and he was again elected Mayor in 1900. Having a
kindly feeling for field sports, he set to work to open the Unley Oval, which, with the
kind co-operation of Lord and Lady Kintore, was successfully accomplished, and the Oval
is now in the occupation of the Sturt Electorate Cricketing Association. Perhaps, however,
the most solid work he has performed was in reference to preserving the public health
by establishing complete supervision over dairies and regulating the milk supply by stringent
by-laws, which must have taken a large amount of labor to prepare. They were adopted
by the Municipal Association of South Australia, a leading article in the South Australian
Register stating:—“ If Air. Currs by-laws are adopted, they- should go far towards creating
confidence in the purity and wholesomeness of an important article of diet, and in the
healthy conditions under which it is distributed. Ihe general object in view commends
itself to the cordial approval of the community at large, and Air. Curr is deserving of
thanks for the trouble he has taken to make the by-laws bearing his name effective to
ensure protection to the public. Ihe 20 municipal and district councils comprising the
metropolitan area have shown their great confidence in him by electing him their
representative on the Central Board of Health.
Air. Curr devotes considerable attention to politics, and being able to express
himself clearly 7 , and having opinions of his own which would be useful to the countrv he
j J
is likely to enter Parliament. He has taken a great interest in Freemasonry, and was for
two years Worshipful Alaster of the Holdfast Lodge under the South Australian Constitution.
He also holds office in the higher branches of Masonry—in the Mark Alaster Masons and
the Royal Arch Chapter, also in the Knight- 1 emplar Encampment and the Rose Croix,
having taken the 18th degree, the highest obtainable in these colonies. He is an active
man, quick to perceive a point, and brisk in the conduct of his business. As an auctioneer,
he is regarded as one of the most prominent in the city. Endowed liberally with both
mother-wit and courtesy, as well as business acumen, he is a man bound to make his
mark in whatever sphere he chooses to exert himself.
Mr. James Richard Fowler, M.A
MITCHAM, near Adelaide, was the birthplace of Mr. J. R. Fowler, who was born May-
-25, 1865, being the eldest son of the late Mr. G. S. Fowler. As a boy, Mr. J. R
Fowler attended Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, for some time, and then he
proceeded to England and studied at Amersham Hill School, near Reading. In 1883
he registered his name at St. John’s, Cambridge, and in 1886 he took honors in the
Historical Tripos, and received his ALA. degree. He returned to South Australia in 188;
and entered the house of I). &J. Fowler, in order to help his father. In 1892 he was
admitted to a partnership in the firm. He has for years been superintendent or teacher in
the school attached to the Clen Osmond Baptist Church, of which he is a prominent member

Dr. Thomas Kinley Hamilton
8.A., M.8., M.D. (Univ. Dublin,) M.D. (Adelaide), FR.C.S.I., and L.M., etc.
TH E medical faculty is very prominent in Australian social life, upon which it has
conferred material benefits, and the tone of which it has elevated by the culture
which comes from a University education. Medical and surgical talent is, by itself,
of immense value to a community,
but when combined with Christian
philanthropy and intellectual vigor,
it is invaluable. To this highest
order of physicians the subject of
this article belongs, for Dr. T. K.
Hamilton is at once a skilled
suroeon and an estimable and
o
benevolent citizen.
Dr. Thomas Kinley Hamilton,
though probably of Scottish origin
primarily, was born in County
Tyrone, Ireland, in 1853, and is
the eldest surviving son of the late
Rev. Robert Hamilton, Rector of
Drumcree, County Armagh, Ire-
land. His earlier education was
received at the Royal School,
Dungannon, and in the Grammar
School of Dundalk. In the latter
institution he gained, in three con-
secutive years, a medal presented
by the Earl of Roden, the patron
of the school, to the pupil securing
first place in the school by obtain-
ing the largest number of marks in
Classics, Mathematics, and Modern
Languages. In 1870, Dr. Hamilton entered Trinity College. University of Dublin, securing
one of the chosen positions amongst the candidates at entrance. He subsequently gained
the Catechetical Prize in each of his first four terms. In 1874 he graduated as Bachelor
of Arts, obtaining second place in the second class at the degree examination. Commencing
the study of Medicine, young Hamilton, two years later, took the Bachelor degree in that
J 7 ✓O 7 t .
science, securing fourth place among a large number of candidates. In the same >eai he
acquired the diploma of Surgery in the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland, also the Licence
in Midwifery at the Rotunda Lying-in Hospital, Dublin. He applied himself to obtaining
practical skill by traversing the usual course at the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin, wheie he
DD 2


gained all the clinical prizes conferred there in Medicine, Surgery, and Gynecology, as well
as a special prize presented by Dr. Knaggs (now of Sydney), himself a former student of
this hospital. I his last honor was conferred upon the senior student showing the greatest
proficiency for the year in all subjects. When a student in the Royal College of Surgeons,
the subject of this notice was the recipient of a special prize in Medicine, presented by the
Professor of Medicine in that institution.
Dr. Hamilton received his first appointment in the north of Ireland, where he
practised for a period of three years. Actuated partly by reasons of health, and probably
also by ambition and an adventurous spirit, he resolved to remove to Australia. Choosing
South Australia for his new sphere, he arrived in the Province in 1880, having previously
taken the M.D. degree in the Dublin University, and obtained the Fellowship in the Royal
College of Surgeons by examination. Soon after reaching the Province, Dr. Hamilton
commenced the practice of his profession at Laura, in the Northern Areas, where he remained
tor a period of six years, obtaining a high reputation among the Northern farmers. Perceiving
the value of certain special qualifications, he decided to further enlarge the range of his
studies, and in 1886 returned to Europe. In the pursuit of the specialities he is now
practising, Dr. Hamilton worked at first in Dublin under Dr. Swanzy, in whom he found
an old friend, having acted in the capacity of his clinical clerk in the Eye Department at
the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin, when a student at that institution. Subsequently, Dr.
Hamilton spent some time in study at the Moorfields Ophthalmic Hospital, London, and
at the Golden Square I hroat Hospital, an institution which was then under the distinguished
presidency of the late Sir Morell Mackenzie. Dr. Hamilton completed his special studies
m diseases of the Lye, Ear, 1 hroat, and Nose at Berlin under Professors Hirschberg, Scholer
I h I toff, and Prankel; and in 1888 was elected a member of the Ophthalmological Society
of the United Kingdom.
O
Returning in the same year to Adelaide, where he had previously taken the
M.D. adeundem gradum degree at the University, Dr. Hamilton soon afterwards commenced
piactice in the city as a specialist in Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases, and rapidly
established a large connection, which he still maintains and increases. In 1890 he succeeded
the late Dr. Davies Thomas as honorary physician to the Throat Department of the Adelaide
Hospital, Adelaide, holding that appointment until the resignation of the honorary staff in
1896. In the same year (1890) Dr. Hamilton was appointed by the Cockburn Government a
member of the South Australian Medical Board, of which Board he is now President,
having been appointed to that position by the late Government on the resignation of Dr.
Paterson, the late Colonial Surgeon. In 1895 he was elected President of the South
Australian Branch of the British Medical Association. He was chosen as one of the
Vice-presidents of the Eye, Ear, and Throat Section of the Fifth Intercolonial Medical
Congress held in September, 1899, at Brisbane, and is now President-elect of the same
Section of the Sixth Medical Congress, which is to be held in 1902 in Hobart.
In 1899 he was appointed to succeed the late Dr. Whittell as a Director of the Australian
Mutual Provident Society. Dr. Hamilton at present holds honorary appointments in
connection with the Deaf and Dumb Institution, Brighton ; the Blind Institution, North
Adelaide; the Orphan Home and House of Mercy, Walkerville; and the Home for


Weal v-minded Children, which was established as a result of the vigorous and disinterested
efforts of the late Mr. George Ash, M.P.
As a strong supporter of religious and philanthropic institutions, and as a courteous,
honorable, Christian gentleman, Dr. Hamilton’s name is cherished throughout South
Australia ; and his fame has reached even wider fields. Thus a career, brief in years, has
been crowded with honors and successes.
Mr. G. P. Doolette
OV the influential South Australians now resident in England, Mr. Doolette is among
the best known. He was for many years a leading business man in Adelaide, and
held large interests in pastoral properties and mining companies. Latterly he has
been prominently identified with Western Australian mining, and is one of the chief friends
of the Western goldfields in London. George Philip Doolette was born at Sandford, near
Dublin, in 1840, and came to South Australia with his parents in 1855. In his native land
he was tor two years engaged in the soft goods trade, and upon his arrival here, turned
to this occupation. He was for two and a half years connected with the firm of McNichol
and Young, as cashier, after which he joined the firm of A. Macgeorge & Co., of Hindley
Street and King William Streets, proving himself so useful an officer that, after nine
years, he was admitted to a partnership. Some time later, Mr. Macgeorge retired,
and Mr. Doolette obtained sole control of the business, which, established in 1849,
became the leading one of its kind in Adelaide. In 1865 he married Mary, the eldest
daughter of Mr. George McEwin, of Glen Ewin, a lady whose sweet disposition and
sympathetic nature endeared her to a large circle of friends. In 1890 she passed away,
after a serious illness, leaving him with a son and daughter, who are now living. Mr.
Doolette invested in pastoral properties, and purchased an interest in Naming Station,
which he afterwards sold to Mr. Philip Charley ; and was interested in other stations. When
the Broken Hill silver fields were developing, he became a considerable speculator and investor
in mines there and in other colonies. Five years ago he proceeded to England, and floated
in London properties acquired by the Coolgardie Mining and Prospecting Company, such
as the famous Great Boulder and Associated Mines. Since then he has taken up his residence
in England, and interests himself largely in Western Australian mining companies, many
of which he has assisted in floating. He is a Director of the Great Boulder and Associated
Mining Companies. Mr. Doolette is a valuable adherent of the Congregational Church.
He was for years a deacon of the North Adelaide Church, and was, in 1885, elected President
of the Congregational Union of South Australia ; and was also Vice-president of the Youim
M en’s Christian Association, and Treasurer of the London Missionary Society. In England
he married a daughter of the late Dr. Dale, the eminent Birmingham Congregational divine.
Such was Mr. Doolette’s ability that he was frequently asked to stand for a seat in the
South Australian Parliament or in the Adelaide City Council, but declined. His friends
at this end of the globe retain a high opinion of his worth and character, for absence does
not dull the memory of his useful qualities.

Mine-Superintendent H. R. Hancock
THE richness of her copper deposits gave South Australia a world-wide reputation
in bygone days. A certain amount of romance attaches to the discovery of each
of the principal mining districts, the element of chance having proved a prominent
feature in each case. In 1845 the famed Burra Burra mines were discovered by a shepherd
tending his flock, and history
repeated itself in 1859 and 1861,
when shepherds found the Wallaroo
and Moonta Mines respectively.
How large an influence these
discoveries, and the subsequent
development of the mines, have
had on the prosperity of South
Australia it would be hard to
estimate ; but it is easy to say
J J
that they have been material factors
J
in the advancement ol the
Province.
It is with the Wallaroo and
Moonta Mines that the name of
Captain H. R. Hancock, pre-
eminently the leading man in the
copper-mining industry in South
Australia, is identified. For 34
years he was Superintendent of
the Moonta Mines, and for 22
years of the Wallaroo Mines; and
during his long residence on Yorke
Pemnsula his work was of para-
mount importance to the com-
munity at large. To deal fully
with those 34 years of his life
would demand a history of the two great mines. Apart from mining and scientific inventions,
Captain Hancock has been engaged in valuable work in philanthropic, religious, and social
circles; and when he left Yorke Peninsula in October, 1898, the residents lost a leader
of men in all movements tending to the common good, besides a veritable captain of industry.
Henry Richard Hancock was born in [836 in one of the copper-mining districts
of Devon, about five miles from the borders ot Cornwall, so that he was practically reared
in the industry from his birth. He engaged in copper-mining in bis youth, beginning at
the lowest rung, and working gradually up the ladder. At the age of 23 he came to


South Australia, and five years after his arrival he took charge of the Moonta Mines. It
seldom falls to a man’s lot to assume such a great responsibility at the early age of 28,
but Captain Hancock proved in every way equal to the task. He possessed the advantage
of having served as the Company’s assayer, and of having surveyed all the underground
workings, thus becoming familiar with the internal arrangements and modes of raising
the ore, besides acquiring an estimate of the value of the mines and the practicability of
their expansion. The ores at this time were very rich, carrying, in some portions of the
mine, as much as 60 per cent, of copper. Captain Hancock divined that this remarkable
percentage could not be maintained for any length ol time, and perceived that he would have
to depend on ore of lesser value. At the same time he recognised that the mines could
be developed more vigorously, which indeed was the only course to be pursued in order
to obtain permanency of operations and the best possible results. The pursuit of such a
scheme demanded the employment of double the number of miners then entrapped in the
I J OO
various shifts, and the scarcity of labor created a serious difficulty. Upon his suggestion,
the Board of Directors dispatched the late Mr. S. R. Wakefield to the Victorian goldfields
to secure the necessary complement of men. That gentleman was successful in his mission,
and a steamer was chartered to convey the miners to the Province. This step caused something
like a crisis, for the news was bruited about the Moonta district that “ a shipload of men
was coming over." There was much excitement among the miners already there, and
the news was immediately signalled to the men working underground. Tools were dropped,
and the men marched en masse to the Superintendent’s office to get an explanation of this
immigration. The situation was certainly critical ; but the wise, cool, collected counsel of
Captain Hancock soon assuaged the ruffled feelings of the men. He pointed out that the
employment of extra men meant more developmental work, that more ore would be raised,
and that the policy was to extend the mine, and not retrench in any respect. The men
were, one and all, satisfied, and went back to their work contentedly. The extra miners
duly arrived, and the developmental work was pushed on. As Captain Hancock surmised,
the ore became gradually less valuable as the workings were carried down, and, of course,
more expensive to work. In order to send away ore enough to keep up the output of
copper, it became necessary to raise an increased quantity of veinstone. This matter
required very careful watching on the part of Captain Hancock ; but his admirable foresight
bore fruit in the splendid approximate uniformity of the annual output of copper which he
maintained for the many years he was connected with the mines. He worked on sound
principles, always striving to keep in sight three or four years’ veinstone, thus avoiding a
“ hand-to-mouth ” policy by leaving exploration work till supplies of ore had actually run out.
Captain Hancock’s working of the Moonta Mines had been so eminently successful
that, 12 years after he assumed command of them, he was appointed to the charge of the
Wallaroo Mines. He was now Superintendent of both Moonta and Wallaroo, and
immediately on assuming the reins at the latter place a vigorous policy of developmental
work was adopted, something like ,£20,000 to ,£30,000 being spent in this direction.
This also was a critical time, for a number of men had to be dismissed when the mine
was being practically reopened. The miners’ residences at Wallaroo, through lack of
tenancy, had been allowed to become dilapidated, and it was accordingly necessary for
the proprietors to expend the sum of ,£9,000 in building cottages for the men required


when the mine was once more brought into full working order. The operations at
\\ allaroo once threatened with extinction have thus been continued up to the present
time, notwithstanding that copper temporarily receded considerably in value from the halcyon
early days of the industry in South Australia.
As the vein stuff, year after year, became poorer and poorer, it became necessary
to use special mechanical apparatus at both Wallaroo and Moonta; and here Captain
Hancocks inventive talent came into use, and proved of great service. Had it not been
ha the judicious use ot his improved rock-drill and other mechanical appliances, the
copper-mining industry would have suffered a severe blow. His jigging apparatus has
proved very valuable. Ihe benefits of the jiggers are not confined to South Australia,
loi they have been utilised on the silver mines ot Broken Hill, where they helped to
soK e the difficult sulphide problem by completing the process of concentration, and returning
oie of a quality fit for the smelters. I here are nine companies engaged in concentrating
w-ork on the Barrier, and six out of this number use Captain Hancock’s patent jigs.
Ihe machinery which he invented is pronounced by experts, and proved by experience,
to be amongst the best in the world ; and his jigging apparatus forms the subject of an
interesting article in Dr. Ure’s well-known “Dictionary of the Arts and Sciences.” A
leading South Australian journal, in speaking of these jigs, said; —“The feasibleness of
his (Captain Hancock’s) device for making the screens not only rise and fall, but also
throw the ore laterally, and thus produce a separation of the good from the bad, has been
fully demonstrated in other places than the Peninsula.”
How important was the industry Captain Hancock controlled can be gathered
from the fact that, during his superintendency of the Wallaroo and Moonta Mines, the
enormous sum of ,£5,500,000 was paid away chiefly in wages. The total amount paid
by the mines m wages since their inception has been estimated at £7,000,000, and
the profits distributed at one and three-quarter million pounds. The dividends in relation
to wages, therefore, have averaged about 25 per cent. The mines employ annually, on
an average, 1.600 men.
111-health compelled Captain Hancock to resign his position in connection with
these copper mines. During his long residence on Yorke Peninsula he was largely
identified with all its leading institutions. He was one of the founders of the Point
Pearce Mission Station, which was established at Boorkoyana in 1865, and has been one
of the most successful institutions of its kind in South Australia. He was for 16 years
Chairman of the Moonta Agricultural Society, and was one of the moving spirits in the
establishment of the Moonta School of Mines, being- afterwards connected with its
governing committee. Captain Hancock was one of the founders of the Moonta Mines
Institute, and one of the promoters of the Moonta Gas Company. An earnest worker
in the Church, he for many years was Superintendent of the Moonta Mines Sunday-school.
He also devoted many years of labor to education as Chairman of the School Board of
Advice. lie is a Preemason ; and all branches of manly sport have received his cordial
co-operation. Ihe various religious and philanthropic organisations of his district have
had in him a sincere worker and well-wisher.


On the eve of his departure from Moonta, Captain Hancock was tendered a banquet,
at which all the representative men ot Yorke Peninsula congregated to do honor to the
departing guest. Ihe speeches were marked with the highest eulogy of him; and in
presenting him with a beautiful illuminated address, as expressive of the esteem and honor
in which he was held, the Mayor of Moonta dwelt on Captain Hancock’s inestimable
services to the district and to South Australia generally. The address was signed by
the Mayors of Kadina, Wallaroo, and Moonta, and all the leading residents on the
copper-fields, as well as by representatives of the officers and of the workmen on
the mines. Captain Hancock’s successor as Superintendent of the mines is his eldest son,
Mr. H. Fipson Hancock, a gentleman who studied under his father and has a thorough
knowledge of mining in every department.
Captain Hancock has for a number of years been a member of the North of
England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers. He served as a Councillor
on the Australian Institute ot Mining Engineers from its formation, and in January, 1898,
was elected \ ice-president for a term of three years. During his visit to England in 1895
he was elected a member of the Royal Colonial Institute. He is also a member of the
Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. After a life of much toil and of
great usefulness to his adopted country, Captain Hancock is now living in comparative
retirement at his beautiful home, “Ivy Meade,’ Burnside, near Adelaide. His striking
personality and commanding physique suggest that he is a born leader of men. His name
must be ever associated with the history of a leading industry of the Province, and he is
the possessor of a reputation almost without parallel in the mining annals of Australasia.
Mr. Joseph Fisher
ONE of the notable colonists of South Australia is Mr. Joseph Fisher. He was born
in Bughouse, Halifax, Yorkshire, on September 14, 1834, and came to South
Australia in the ship Pestonjee Bomanjee , on board of which was Governor Gawler,
who was proceeding to the assumption of his vice-regal duties in the Province. The
vessel arrived on October 12, 1838, and Josiah Fisher, with his son Joseph, disembarked
on the new and little known territory. On arrival in Adelaide Mr. Josiah Fisher, Joseph’s
father, engaged in business in Hindley Street. His demise on September 3, 1841, was
deeply regretted by the whole community. Mr. Joseph Fisher’s education was begun and
completed at the Oddfellows’ School, under Mr. J. W. Disher. On leaving school, the
youth went in October, 1846, into the office of Mr. Anthony P'orster, ahd remained there
till March, 1848. Then he entered the office of the Register newspaper. He succeeded
by dint of perseverance in rising to a position of prominence in his new sphere, and in
1853 he joined six other gentlemen in purchasing the Register , retiring from the firm in 1864.
In April, 1868, Mr. P'isher stepped into the political arena, and was returned at the head
of the poll for the District of Sturt ; and in 1873 he was elected a member of the
Fegislative Council, a position which he ably held till 1881. He sought re-election, but
was unsuccessful, and then severed his connection with active political life.

1 he Hardy Family
PROBABLY the best ! •mown South Australian wine is that made by Messrs. Thomas
Hardy & Sons, Limited. To obtain a reputation of this kind in a new country is no
small achievement. Perhaps there is no more conservative person than the wine-
drinker. An unknown vintage of a better quality may be offered to him, but if it come
from anywhere outside the fashion-
able manufacturing countries, he
will have none of it ; and he must
be somewhat courageous who will
deliberately and openly place a
new wine on his banquet table. Let
it be as excellent as possible —the
guests will, as a rule, let it severely
alone. Although it has been
proved times and again that South
Australian wines are of a higher
quality than many of those grown
in the better-known wine countries
of Europe, they are often looked
upon with suspicion or apathy in
the world’s markets. It was onlv
by great persistency and courage
that South Australian makers
obtained any hold at all upon the
home trade. By a careful and
systematic pushing they have at
length reached the consumer ; and
although the demand is not as yet
commensurate with the excellence
of the ware, the initial steps, at
any rate, have been taken in the
direction of finding a good market
O o
in England for South Australian
wines. In the attainment of this end, so far, the firm of which Mr. Thomas Hardy was
the founder has taken a leading part. For over 40 years Mr. Hardy has been engaged
in wine-making in South Australia, and during that period he has naturally obtained an
extensive knowledge of the capabilities of Australian soils for viticulture, as well as the
suitableness of Australian atmospheric conditions.
Mr. Thomas Hardy was born near Honiton, Devon, on January 14, 1830, and
while yet a young man, in 1850, he came to South Australia. Soon after his arrival, the
Victorian gold-diggings attracted general attention, and created great excitement throughout


Australia. Forming one of a large complement of South Australian inhabitants, Mr. Hardy
set off for the new goldfields in 1851 ; and there, among the creeks and gullies and in
the bush, he pursued the adventurous life of a gold-seeker for many months. At last, tired
of the uncertain quest for gold, he returned to South Australia in 1855. He purchased
some land on the Adelaide Plains, and began wine-making in a modest way. His property
was situated at Bankside, about three miles from Adelaide. He planted a small vineyard
and orchard, and gradually enlarged them as opportunity allowed. It took him some
years to produce a wine natural to climate and soil ; but pertinacity, industry, and a studious
and observant nature enabled him to succeed.
\\ ith all the courage of the true colonist, Mr. Hardy persisted in his experimental
efforts, and his wine eventually secured a large sale. Unlike many another South Australian
J o j
vigneron, he did not plant more vines than he could properly cultivate. The growth of
his business has, ever since, been steady and sure, and eventually it has become one of
the largest of the kind in Australasia. The original small plot planted with vines has
been added to, until now the vineyard in bearing consists of 540 acres ; and the stock of
wines on hand amounts to some 1,000,000 gallons. The wines are of various ages, some
dating back as far as the 1865 vintage. As Australian wines became more popular,
the business increased, until a few years ago the concern got beyond the range of the
original proprietary. It was accordingly transferred to a limited company, comprising its
founder, and Mr. J. J. Hardy, Mr. T. N. Hardy, Mr. R. B. Hardy, and a few friends,
under the style of Thomas Hardy & Sons, Limited.
J J
The largest vineyard of the company is at Lintara, and it produces a very high-class
wine of a Burgundy or full claret type. This wine is sold principally in England, under
the “ Tintara ” brand. The company is especially noted for the excellence of its claret,
Hardv’s No. 1 Claret being' favorably known throughout Australia. New and extensive
j o J o
cellars have been erected by the company at Mile End, on the outskirts of Adelaide, and
they are admirably adapted for their purpose. They are capable of holding 1,c00,000
gallons of wine. The old Bankside homestead has meanwhile been converted into a
beautiful place. The vineyard, cellars, orangery, and orchard are replete with conveniences
and laid out with an eye to the picturesque. In fact, Bankside is looked upon as one of
the show-places of Adelaide and its environment. Raisins, currants, and olive oil are
produced and sold by the company in large quantities; and extensive offices and cellars
are located at 87, Currie Street, Adelaide.
Mr. Thomas Hardy, having so early associated himself with the general welfare
of the wine industry in South Australia, is well qualified to advise on the industry ; and
from time to time he has given his fellow-colonists the benefit of his experience in the
business. An expert judge of soils, his valuable knowledge has been repeatedly placed
at the service of the State. He is at present Vice-president of the South Australian
Horticultural Society, of the Vinegrowers’ Association, and ol the Chamber of Manufactures,
to all of which institutions he has rendered great service. He is Chairman of the West
Torrens School Board of Advice.
Mr. J. J. Hardy, Mr. Thomas Hardy’s son, who was born in 1855 the starting


year of the original vineyard—is vice-president of the Vinegrowers’ Association. This gentleman
takes a very active part in the management of the company founded by his father. Having
obtained a clear insight into the industry in Australia, he has given much-appreciated advice
to wine-growers in South Australia and, recently, in Western Australia; and, with his
brothers, may be considered as a leader in a promising colonial industry. With suitable
soil and climate, the future ot wine-making in the Province is assured ; and the industry
is bound to become a source of wealth to the community at large as well as to individuals.
As successful pioneers of this industry in South Australia, Mr. Thomas Hardy and his
sons deserve well of the Province and all the great prosperity they now derive from their
business.
Mr. Frederic Chappie, 8.A., B.Sc.
W1 1 H the foremost of the chief educational establishments of South Australia —one
might almost say of Australia generally -Prince Alfred College must take rank,
Some 32 years ago, in January, 1869, this great school was opened ; and it has
since come to be almost a national institution in the Province. The memorial-stone of the
College was laid on November 5, 1867, by His Royal Highness the late Prince Alfred,
Duke of Edinburgh, whose name the establishment bears. Mr. F. Chappie, 8.A., B.Sc..
came from England, fresh from a short and bright career in London. He has since fully
maintained the efficiency of the curriculum, and has constantly improved upon it, so that
now Prince Alfred College can offer educational advantages equal to those of any other
scholastic establishment in Australia. Mr. Chappie was born in London in 1845, and, as
a young man, he studied at the London University, where he obtained honors in Physiology
(Human and Comparative), in Logic, and Mental Philosophy, studying for the last-named
at Kings College, London. After completing his collegiate course, he became tutor at
the Wesleyan I raining College, Westminster; and during his leisure hours he followed
the Science Course at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington. In 1873 he took
the degree of Bachelor of Science in the first class, his Arts degree having been achieved
with similar success. Mr. Chappie early evinced singular ability as a schoolmaster, and
under him Prince Alfred College from the first began to attain fresh fame. The success
of Prince Alfred boys at the University is an earnest of the high standard of the academical
curriculum of the College. Since 1883, Mr. Chappie has been Warden of the Senate of
the University of Adelaide, and he was Vice-president of the Royal Society for some
years. He has been prominently associated with the Young Men’s Christian Association
movement, was President of the Council of Churches, and has held all the offices open to
a layman in Methodism. Mr. Chappie’s career in this Province has been uniformly
beneficial. His services to the community have been many, and by his large-minded
sympathy and knowledge, he has proved a highly valuable colonist. In a young country,
whose children are not ungifted with brains, there is a great deal of room for educated
men such as Mi. Chappie. Ihe Prince Alfred boys, old and young, hold a warm place
in their hearts for him, for he has governed them with a kindly, paternal dignity.

The late Mr. Alexander Hay
B\ the death of Mr. Alexander Hay, South Australia lost one of those sturdy pioneers
of sterling merit who have helped to build up the Greater Britain beyond the
seas. What the Pilgrim Fathers did for America, the pioneers from Britain have
done for Australasia. Their mental and bodily vigor laid the strong and enduring
foundations of a nation, which
they have bequeathed as an
heirloom to their sons to extend
and embellish.
The late Mr. Alexander Hay
was born in Dumfermline, Scot-
land, in 1820, and came to South
Australia in 1839. In him there
was a stronof blend of those
persistent and enduring Scotch
characteristics that have made
its sons famous in the annals of
British enterprise and colonisa-
tion. The dogged tenacity, the
OO J
unwavering resolve, the capacity
for thrift and perseverance, were
inherent in his character, and
conduced to the furtherance of
himself and the promotion of
others. For some time subsequent
to his arrival in the Province,
which occurred only three years
J J
after the foundation of South
Australia, Mr. Hay sojourned in
the Gumeracha district, where he
engaged in various pursuits con-
nected with settlement on the
virgin soil of the new country. Land settlement and agricultural occupations comprised
at this early period the main industry of the Province, and devotion to these or their
accessories was almost the only means of winning a competence—or even ensuring bare
subsistence. Moving later to Linden, near Adelaide, Mr. Hay engaged in general
business. Simultaneously with commercial avocations, he extensively followed pastoral and
agricultural pursuits ; and his reputation as a competent business man was proved by the
able manner in which he successfully supervised and managed his diverse interests. He
took a step in a new direction when, on the death of Mr. John Stephens, proprietor of
the Register and Obsei'ver newspapers, he formed one of a syndicate of seven gentlemen


who purchased these properties. His public life began with his appointment as
member of the City Corporation, which office he filled for three years. The groundwork
of a legislative system for the city was then still in the process of formation, and the
framei s had no easy task assigned to them in initiating laws and regulations for the
benefit ol the community. 1 hey had little precedent to fall back on save the customs
and ordinances which obtained in the countries they had left, and these they could not
well import into their new municipality. I hey had to devise enactments that would be
suitable to their new environment, and many of the measures promulgated by the pioneer
band of municipal legislators of Adelaide remained in serviceable activity without
amendment for many years after the city had crystallised into more definite form. On
the. Central Board of Health, Mr. Hay plied his energies for five years, tendering his
assistance to his colleagues in their praiseworthy attempts to raise the standard of hygienic
management, and remove certain insanitary customs that ' imperilled the health of the
community. Ihe Board did much to improve the conditions of Adelaide by the by-laws
it instituted for the maintenance of cleanliness.
I rom his eaihest years as a colonist, Air. Hay identified himself with every form
of religious, social, and philanthropic work in the Province. With the Rev. T. O. Stow
and Dean Farrell, he served on the local committee of the British and Poreign Bible
Society, an institution which has wrought inestimable good in the religious history of the
colonies. As a loyal and patriotic Scotchman, he always evinced a keen interest in the welfare
of his compatriots. His great desire was to foster among them a true esprit de corps ,
and he was eminently successful in this endeavor. The Caledonian Society was founded
by several enthusiastic Scotchmen, including Mr. Hay; and of this Association he was
elected the first Chief in South Australia. Ihe conception was happy, and the birth a
success, for to-day that society claims many of the foremost names in the Province on its
101 l of membersnip. lo him also fell the honor of being one of the earliest Presidents
of the Young Men’s Christian Association in the Province.
In commercial and financial fields, where the material and practical side of a
man’s abilities is summoned into greater requisition, Mr. Hay also attained prominence.
He, was connected with the promotion of many local financial institutions, including the
Bank of Adelaide, the South Australian Branch of the Australian Mutual Provident
Society, the South Australian Insurance Company, and the South Australian Gas Company.
Air. Hay for years sat on the directorial board of each of these concerns
In 1857 Air. Hay made his political ddbut as the representative of Gumeracha in
the Lower House. He sat for this district till 1861, and was again its representative
from 1867 to 1870. In the Parliament of 1870-71 he took his seat as member for East
Torrens. He sat for two years, and in 1873 entered the Legislative Council, of which
he remained a member for 18 years, up to his final retirement from active politics in 1891.
In the Reynolds Ministry Mr. Hay held the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works
from May, iB6O, to October, 1861, and his administration was marked by deliberation
and sound common sense. He was responsible for many utilitarian Acts;" but perhaps
the measures with which his political record will be most closely associated were the Real


Property Act, which he assisted the late Sir R. R. I orrens and others to carry, and the
Sale of State Lands on Credit Act, which he introduced into, and carried through, the
Assembly. Ihe lattei measure was productive of much good in enabling small settlers to take
up land, and pay lor it alter they had obtained some returns from their selections. Mr.
Hay was a consistent and strenuous supporter of the transcontinental telegraph line.
Mi. Hay made three trips from South Australia to the old country, and on the
occasion of his last visit, in 1893, he was made Hon. Executive Commissioner for South
Australia at the Indian and Colonial Exhibition. He also sat as a delegate from the
Adelaide Chamber of Commerce at a united congress of kindred bodies in the British
metropolis. In both of these capacities he acquitted himself with great credit.
Alter his retirement from politics, Mr. Hay led a quiet life, devoting himself to
looking after his extensive pastoral interests, supervising affairs from Adelaide. It was
whilst away at Port \ ictor, in January, 1898, that he died, greatly to the sorrow of South
Australia generally. Mr. Hay was one ol the most esteemed citizens of Adelaide. The
sympathetic and kindly interest evinced by him in connection with many forms of social
advancement, the w 7 arm and glowing spirit which seemed to suffuse his every word and
deed, won him general popularity and esteem.
The late Mr. James Bath
MAN\ successful colonists ot South Australia are under a debt of gratitude to the
late Mr. James Bath for his patience in guiding their early tuition, and the kindly
advice he gave them in their later years, which has enabled them to fill positions
of influence in the Province with credit to themselves and their teacher. Mr. Bath was
born in Wiltshire in 1833, and at 17 years of age was employed in teaching. Reading
the glowing accounts published by Messrs. Wilkinson and Byrne, he decided to emigrate,
and landed in South Australia from the barque Asia in 1851. He took charge of the
Christ Church School, and was one of the few men left in Adelaide when the exodus to
\ ictoria took place at the time of the gold fever. Alter 10 years’ mastership he severed
his connection with the Christ Church School, and opened a private school, which he
conducted with success, until, in 1867, he was appointed secretary to the Board of
Education; and when the Board was succeeded by the Council of Education, Mr.
Bath still held his position. In 1883 he received the appointment of secretary to the
Minister of Education, which appointment he held until his death, on May 20, igoi,
serving under no fewer than 14 Ministers, one of them being a former pupil. He
rendered the Province good service as secretary of the Postal Conference in 1890, and
of the Rust in Wheat Conference. Mr. Bath also acted as private secretary to the
Right Hon. C. C. Kingston during the P'ederal Convention in Melbourne. Mr. Bath’s
invariable courtesy endeared him to all with whom he came into contact, and his death
was deeply regretted.

The late Mr. William Hill
THE pioneers of South Australia who, full of years and honor, have gone to their
well-earned rest, left behind them many lessons well worthy to be learned and
examples to be studied. Not the least of these is a sturdy independence of action,
coupled with a staunch conscientiousness. They were as little afraid of undergoing bodily
hardship as ol announcing
cherished religious convictions,
whether popular or not. I hey
did not mind soiling their hands,
and in Christian principle they
were as milestones to those who
would follow in the same road.
A man of this stamp was the late
Mr. William Hill, who was born
at Wendoon, Cornwall, on April 2,
1830. He came to this Province
as a young man, and, after
acquiring a good general ex-
perience, entered, in 1853, the
service of the pioneer millers,
Messrs. John Dunn & Co. A
memoir of this historical family
appears in another place in this
volume, and it was in their con-
nection that Mr. Hill performed
much valuable work for South
Australia. He was soon appointed
head manager of the Adelaide
branch of the business, and some
years later, was admitted into part-
nership with the proprietors. He
became a very active member of
the firm, and helped considerably
in bringing it to so successful and flourishing an issue. The firm extended its operations
into every corner of South Australia, into the other colonies, and even beyond the continent.
j
It was by the earnestness, business application, and enterprise of the partners that this
o-reat business was built up. It is to be regretted that circumstances have arisen which have
o
resulted in the break up of the business so ably carried on in the earlier history of the Province.
Mr. Hill was especially known for his practical application of religious principle
to every day life. This was not done with dramatic show or with the accompaniment of
false glorification, but in a quiet, unobtrusive, and kindly fashion. As a consequence, he


gained the good will and confidence, not only of the general public, but also of the men
under him. Ihe best testimony of their good feeling was in the presentation, after
he had been 30 years with the firm, of a handsome gold watch and chain as a mark of
esteem by the employes. He was an energetic lay preacher in the Wesleyan Church, and
filled numerous offices in that denomination. In 1880, accompanied by his wife and family,
he proceeded on a tour through Great Britain, Europe, America, and South Africa, spending
some time in his native town in Cornwall, which ever had his enthusiastic regard.
For many years Mr. Hill was a resident of Glenelg, where his fine qualities and
sound common-sense won the admiration of the residents. He was for some years identified
with the Glenelg Council, and rendered it useful advice on all matters having for their
o ’ o
object the better comfort of the townspeople and the improvement of that pretty seaside
resort. He was frequently asked to stand for Parliament for the Districts of Onkaparinga,
Mount Barker, and Sturt, but as frequently declined, owing to the exigencies of his business
engagements.
o o
Mr. Hill married a daughter of the founder of the business house of Dunn and
Co., who, with three daughters, survives him. He died at his home, “Glenara,” Glenelg,
on September 11, 1885, greatly esteemed and sincerely mourned. The business world
then lost a worthy worker, and the religious world an earnest helper. He was a supporter of
Volunteer matters, and was earnestly interested in Masonry.
Mr, Matthew Goode
MR. MATTHEW GOODE, who has been for many years a leader in the Adelaide
commercial world, was born at Hampton-Charles, on the borders of Herefordshire
and Worcestershire, in 1820. Upon leaving school he proceeded to London, where
for seven years he was associated with the drapery trade. In 1852 he followed his brother,
Mr. C. H. Goode, to South Australia. The latter was already established as a draper in
Kermode Street, North Adelaide, and the subject of this sketch joined him in partnership.
The business of the brothers grew rapidly, and they removed to larger premises in Rundle
Street. In course of years, the business was removed to Stephens Place, where Messrs.
Goode devoted themselves to the wholesale trade, with ever-increasing success. Thirty
years ago the firm established large warehouses in Grenfell Street, which Mr. Goode still
utilises. The partnership was dissolved in 1882, and since then Mr. Matthew Goode has
held sole control of the extensive and ever-extending business. Many years ago Mr.
Goode was elected to the City Council, and he served the ratepayers for two years, during
which he distinguished himself as an earnest advocate of sanitation and financial reform.
In politics he is both a Freetrader and Federationist. Upon the introduction of the present

Mr. William Austin Horn
IN South Australia, the home of many eminently-successful commercial magnates who
have built up their fortune and their reputation by a consistent display of intelligence,
are to be found examples of what men endowed with keen faculties can do in life.
Mr. William Austin Horn, a man of this class, is widely known in South Australia and
in England. His patriotic ten-
dencies, directed towards explora-
tion and the advancement of
human knowledge regarding the
unknown interior of the Australian
continent, have received approba-
tion both in Australia and among
scientific authorities in (ireat
Britain.
Mr. W. A. Horn was born in
New South Wales in 1841. He
left the mother colony in 1852, and
came to South Australia, where he
began his education at St. Peter’s
College. Later, he proceeded to
Worcester College, Oxford, to
continue his studies. He returned
to South Australia in 1874, and
for many years followed pastoral
pursuits. Frequent travel and
tours were indulged in during a
10-years’ sojourn on a sheep-run ;
and these expeditions added
piquancy to existence and relieved
the otherwise overwhelming feeling
of tiresome monotony inseparable
from station life in lonely parts.
In after years, when speculative successes brought more plenitude to his doors, he invested
considerable sums in the purchase ot station property in the Province. It was while
actively engaged in squatting that he became interested in the famous Moonta copper
mines, and had the good fortune to become one of the original proprietors. Anyone who
has followed the subsequent history of these mines can easily guess how lucrative must
have been a first share. Mining ventures henceforth attracted his energy. He purchased
interests in the leading mines on Yorke Peninsula, and associated himself prominently
with their development.


Mr. Horn was one of the early pioneers of Silverton and Broken Hill ; and in
this latter field he acquired extensive interests. He was appointed a Director of the famous
Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and was given many other official positions in connection
with mining companies. On the discovery of the Mutooroo copper mines, his capital and
influence were alike sought and enlisted for the promotion of the claims thereon. When
Western Australia asserted its auriferous splendor, and prospecting expeditions were in
great demand to search and explore for the hidden treasure, Mr. Horn put himself in the
van of stimulative progress in that direction. He took a leading part in forming the Octagon
Syndicate, with a view to fitting out expeditions to explore and prospect the vast mineral areas
of the sister colony.
In 1887 he first entered politics. He stood as a candidate for the Flinders District
in that year, and was returned by a large majority to the House of Assembly. For this
electorate he sat for six years, retiring in 1893. In the following year he went to England,
and did not return to the Province till December, 1896. His political career was characterised
by readiness in debate, outspokenness, and sturdiness of opinion. His policy was pre-
eminently decisive and constant in purpose. Shuffling and shilly-shallying with their
aimless and weakly intentions were his aversion.
In connection with the Northern Territory, Mr. Horn proposed a measure in the
House of Assembly to allow colored labor to be introduced on plantations, and in other
semi-tropical industries. Ably defending the position he took up, and championing the
good that would accrue from the passing of such a measure, he succeeded in winning- the
attention of the House, but the Labor Party, ever jealous of the sacred privileges of the
whites, and ever condemnatory of alien immigration, gathered their forces together, and
effectually barred the progress of the measure.
Mr, H orn’s deep insight into the general character of the people is well illustrated
in the action he took in a rather serious crisis in the agricultural industry of the Province.
The farmers throughout South Australia, having experienced a succession of disastrous
seasons, laid their grievances before Government in the form of a petition for a subsidy for
seed wheat. They implored assistance in this direction; but the Government doubted whether
the State would ever be recouped the proposed outlay, and accordingly refused the prayer,
Mr. Horn urged that the farmers’ request be granted, and placed faithful reliance on the
honesty of the distressed agriculturists in his many strenuous addresses on the subject. He
followed up his preaching by practice. All the beleaguered farmers in his constituency, and
they aggregated no inconsiderable number, were equipped by him with seed wheat, and he
trusted for re-payment to their honor. His confidence in them was justified ; for, as soon
as they were able they all repaid him, with the exception of one poor selector whose holding
was so small that it was utterly impossible for him to requite his obligation. Mr. Horn
pitying the man’s unfortunate position, purchased the holding and presented it to him. His
whole conduct in this matter was exemplary, and not only proved his acquaintance with
human nature, but showed his readiness to demonstrate by practice the sincerity of his
professions. For his single-handed munificence he received tfle eulogiums of the Press, as
well as the gratitude of the recipients of his kindness.

Mr. w. A. Horn ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


He gradually grew in favor in the House, and his legislative invoked
appreciable comment from both parties. He refused the offer of the portfolio of treasurer
in the Cockburn Government, preferring to remain independent in his political attitude. His
capabilities would, however, in general estimation, have fitted him for any Ministeiial post.
He was possessed of a rich fund of humor, and a gift of keen satire, with a capacity for
epigrammatic expression and telling repartee which often delighted the House.
But it is more particularly in connection with exploration work that Mr. Horns
name will be remembered. He personally bore the heavy expense of the Horn Exploration
Party, which went through Central Australia for scientific purposes. The services of the
eminent naturalist and scientist, Professor Baldwin Spencer, were secured for this expedition,
and the success of the exploration has well repaid Mr. Horns patriotic open-handedness.
In 1894 the party started on its arduous journeying into the desert and bush, and reached
Larapinta Land, which they examined in an exhaustive fashion. Ihe discoveiies and
observations of this expedition are preserved in a work of four volumes, the perusal of
which shows the richness of the copious information gleaned. Geological, biological, botanical,
and ethnological matters are extensively dealt with, and form an interesting and very valuable
addition to the knowledge of the little-known districts of the great central deserts of the
Austral continent.
Mr. Horn’s speculative connections seem to have endless ramifications. He is
deeply interested in the Great Western Railway in I asmania, which acquired lights from
the Government to build a direct railway from Mount Ly r ell to the capital. As a concession,
the company received half a million acres. Mr. Horn retired, however, from all his official
positions on his departure for England in 1898. But, though absent himself, his name will
ever remain m close association with the colonies, and especially with South Australia. He
has added greatly to the welfare of this Province during the many years he has sojourned
in this part, and has not failed to assist in any cause for the improvement and promotion
of his fellow-colonists. He has thus earned the goodwill and kindly esteem of all who
can admire disinterested and useful devotion to the common good. His devotion tacked
closely r on to his keen scientific ardor, and a corresponding love for its advance, has made
him a national benefactor. His name brings with it the respect which it is entitled to.
and will remain as that of one of the most generous public men in the treasured annals
of South Australian history. Many gifts have been bequeathed by him to the city of
Adelaide. The Museum received from him 11,000 coins, dating back to the earliest times
of the Romans, and comprising one of the most valuable collections in the world. Ihe
statues of Venus Canova and the Farnese Hercules were the gifts of Mr. Horn to the
municipality.
Thirty years ago, Mr. Horn was appointed a Justice of the Peace. He is a
member of the Junior Carlton Club and New' Universities Club in London, and of the
Melbourne and Adelaide Clubs. His kindly disposition has won him many friends, while
his sincere straightforwardness and his sympathetic regard tor all promotive movements
have singled him out as a citizen and colonist exalted in type and truly useful in many
spheres.

Captain Inglis
The growth of England’s maritime enterprise has necessitated a system of strict
supervision, from which few shipping operations are exempt. In the rise of any
national enterprise the wills of the originators are at first the only law ; but with
time and progress the necessity of restriction and systematic governance becomes apparent.
And in equal proportion to
England’s maritime greatness is
the strength, justice, and effective-
ness of her shipping laws. In this
respect the colonies follow the lead
of the mother country, and thus it
is that we have in South Australia
a Marine Board, with its strict
enquiries, its numerous officials,
and its admirable system of super-
vision. Under that system, the
most important officer is the
Harbormaster, who combines a
multiplicity of varying duties.
Captain Alexander Inglis, the
present occupant of the position,
is, as his name signifies, a native
of Scotland—a country which has
produced a large proportion of the
navigators for whom Britain is
famous.
Captain Inglis was born at
Eordyce, Banffshire, on January
26, 1845, receiving his preliminary
instruction at the Eordyce
Grammar School, and completing
his education at the Cullen
Grammar School. Having mastered the trade of a shipwright, principally on the India
and China trade, at an early age he went to sea. In 1864, on one of his voyages as
first officer of the Alexander , ol Kirkcaldy, he visited South Australia. Subsequently he
joined the service of the Circular Saw Company, a New Zealand shipping proprietary,
and engaged in the (lour trade with the west coast of America. After four years of this
life, Captain Inglis voyaged to South Australia in his own vessel, the Planter. He sold
the vessel to Mr. Henry Simpson, and in 1878 took command of the Athena , a ship
owned by the latter. In the following year he succeeded Captain Blanch as Examiner
for masters’ certificates, shipwrights’ surveyor, etc., continuing in that position until the


resignation, a year or so subsequently, of the then Harbormaster, Captain Quin, when he
assumed the vacant position, which he has held ever since.
Captain Inglis has never ventured far into public matters, but he has for many
years been a member of the South Australian Caledonian Society, and for two years was
Chief of the Port Adelaide branch. He has earned the reputation of a painstaking,
energetic, and eminently competent officer. His service to the Marine Board has been
of great value, whilst as a private citizen he has earned high esteem.
The late Mr. George Swan Fowler
WHEN Mr. George Swan Fowler died on October i, 1896. at his residence, Wooton
Lea, Glen Osmond, there passed away one of the few remaining business men of
the South Australia of the “sixties.’ He was born at Anstruther, Scotland, on
March 9, 1839, and was a son of the late Mr. James Fowler, a prominent business man
in his native town. His elder brother, James, had preceded him to Australia, and prepared
the way. The latter gentleman founded the business of Messrs. Fowler, in Rundle Street,
Adelaide, in 1853. He was joined by another brother, the late Mr. David Fowler, and the
firm became known as I). &J. Fowler. In 1859 the pioneer died, and George Swan
Fowler came to South Australia in iB6O. All the three brothers were experienced in the
grocery trade, in which their father was engaged in Scotland. But Messrs. David and
G. S. Fowler quickly recognised that their chief opportunity lay in the need then existing
in Adelaide for wholesale grocery merchants. Wholesale trade premises were opened in
King William Street, and there the firm has remained for 33 years. A branch was
immediately opened in London, and through that means a considerable portion of the
success attained has been gained. Stores were rented on the old historical McLaren "Wharf
at Port Adelaide, but seven years later the importations became so large that these were
insufficient for their purposes. Larger premises were opened in Adelaide, and the staff of
employes was considerably increased. In more recent years Messrs. D. & J. Fowler have
largely increased their sphere of operations and their articles of trade; and in 1889 they
purchased property and built a large factory. Since the death of Mr. David Fowler in 1881,
the major portion of the management devolved on the subject of this notice. A few years
ago he acquired a paramount interest in the Adelaide Milling Company, one of the largest
trading concerns in the Province. He introduced to Australia the McArthur-Forrest Cyanide
Process of gold recovery, and was for many years local director of the Australian Gold
Recovery Company. Mr. P'owler represented, with the late Sir J. C. Bray, the District of
East Adelaide, from 1878 to 1881, and in April of the latter year was re-elected; but on
June 7 he resigned in order to take a prolonged rest. He did not again enter the
political arena. Prom March 10 to May 10, 1881, he was Treasurer in the re-constructed
ministry of Sir William Morgan. Mr. P'owler was for three years Chairman of the Phist
Torrens School Board of Advice; and was prominently identified with the Baptist Church.


Ihe late Dr. Richard Gardiner fay, M.R.C.S
Australia may well boast of its pioneers in very department of industry. They
were a race of ardent, dauntless men, who divested themselves of the ties of
home, kindred, and luxurious associations to enter the wilds of the untrodden bush.
While we pay high tribute to the brawny, bearded, loose-limbed, courageous bushmen,
who have entered the interior and braved the terrors of hardship and thirst, we must not pass
unnoticed those refined, skilled, and accomplished men who, settling where population
gathered, laid the foundation of civilised societv in a hitherto unhabited region. Of the latter
class, the late Dr. Jay, a pioneer surgeon in this Province, deserves especial notice as
having pursued an honored career, dating from the earliest period of South Australian history.
Ihe late Dr. Richard Gardiner [ay was born at Ipswich, the capital town of
Suffolk, a county wherein his ancestors had lived for many successive generations. After
gaining the preliminary education customary to youths of his station and period, Richard
Jay commenced the study of medicine, passing through the apprenticeship stage usual
in those days. He then entered Guy’s Hospital, which at that time also comprised
the hospital of St. Thomas, and went through the course there stipulated, at the
conclusion ot which he qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons,
England. In his young days, Australia was a country possessed of unique attractions to
the adventurous and enterprising, and as one ol these, Dr. Jay, who had considerable
independent means, came to South Australia in the early “forties.’’ On landing in the
Province he remained for some time in the city, and afterwards settled at Willunga, where
he practised successfully for over 30 years. At that time there were few members of the
medical profession in the Province, and the scattered settlements south of Adelaide formed
a wide field for his operations. Almost all the business south of the city came into his
hands, and he soon worked up an extensive and lucrative practice. In later years
competition came into the field ; but the skill, energy, and popularity of the late physician
constituted qualities which maintained a large connection. Added to the results of many
years’ incessant surgical work in a thriving community were the independent means already
mentioned, and Dr. Jay attained to a position of opulence. In later years, however,
mining speculations seriously diminished the wealth so honorably acquired. His prominence
in the district which formed the scene ot his labors drew upon him the notice of the
authorities who, at an early stage in colonial history, invested Dr. Jay with the Commission
of the Peace, which he exercised justly and fearlessly for a great many years. One of his
sons, Mr. William Eugene Jay, who followed his father’s profession, was practising at
Wallaroo, when he died suddenly at that centre. Dr. Jay, sen., then took up the practice
which his son had established in the mining town, and remained there until he was taken
ill in 1878, and was removed to the city, where his death occurred shortly after.
During his long career in this Province, Dr. Jay earned a high reputation as a
medical man, besides wide popularity and much esteem for his many social and personal
qualities.


Dr. Melville Richard Hindmarsh Jay, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.
IN the Midland Counties of England, where a distinct Saxon character prevails, the
hereditary principle holds more firmly than in localities where a less conservative
spirit is found. The same social status, often the same profession or occupation, is
handed on from father to son. The |ay family, which has been so prominent in South
Australian medical circles, is of Suffolk origin, and the general characteristic mentioned
has in its members individual exemplification. Two sons of the late Dr. Jay, who for nearly
half a century practised as a surgeon and physician in South Australia, followed in the
footsteps of their father ; and of one of them, Dr. Melville Richard Hindrnarsh Jay this
article treats.
Dr. Melville Jay was born at Willunga on February 16, 1866. After some
preliminary instruction, he was sent to St. Peter’s College, where he studied for a number of
years. He showed great proficiency when a lad, taking every scholarship and prize available ;
and for three years was senior boy at the school. Having completed his education in
general subjects, he commenced the study of medicine in the Adelaide Hospital,
where his brother, Dr. William Eugene Jay, was then Senior House Surgeon. After
some time spent in that institution, he went to England, and entered St. Thomas’s
Hospital, London, an establishment at which (when it was conducted conjointly with
Guy’s Hospital) his father had studied before him. Five years’ experience here sufficed
to pass Dr. Jay through his medical course, and he then qualified as a Member of the Royal
College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London. He had
contemplated adding a University degree to these qualifications ; but his father’s death about
this time caused him to alter his plans. Accordingly he commenced the practice of his
profession in the South-West of London, where he labored arduously for a period of 18 months.
He found that the duties attached to a practice in the great metropolis demanded too much
of his energy and strength, and he returned to South Australia in 1880. Immediately on
arrival he joined Dr. Wylde in his practice at North Adelaide. The partnership lasted
three years, when Dr. Wylde, wishing to visit England, sold out to Dr. Jay. The
abilities, integrity, and courtesy of the young physician speedily gained him repute and
popularity, with the result that a substantial and lucrative practice has undergone considerable
expansion in his hands.
Dr. Jay was for many years a member of the honorary staff of surgeons
attached to the Adelaide Hospital ; but in consequence of the disputes between the Board
and the Government which arose some time since, he has severed his connection with the
institution. He also held the post of Honorary Surgeon to the Convalescent Hospital,
at the Semaphore, and was for a considerable time a prominent member of the South
Australian Branch ot the British Medical Association. Dr. Jay has not sought public
honors, but amid the wide circle ot his acquaintance he enjoys a high reputation as a
skilful surgeon and an honorable gentlemen.

Mr. J. C. F. Johnson, F.G.S.
JOURNALISM has frequently proved a valuable and practical Introduction to public hie;
and when the pressman steps from the friendly ambush of anonymity, and goes before
the bar of public opinion, he is generally found not only to acquit himself well, but to
add credit to his associations. The world is fruitful in such examples, and in South Australia
we have several illustrations of
members of the Press who have
risen to eminence. Mr. J. C. F.
Johnson is a case in point, and
though not now in active politics,
he is still a public man not only
on account of past performances,
but also by reason of his interests
in the South Australian mining
and commercial world.
Mr. Joseph Colin Francis
Johnson was born, in King William
Street, Adelaide, in February,
1848. Both his fat he r and
mother were pioneer colonists.
His father arrived in the ship
Africaine , and was one ot the first
lawyers to practise in Adelaide.
His mother, Wilhelmina Colquhon
Campbell, was the third daughter
of Mr. Colin Campbell, who
arrived with his family and ser-
vants by the ship Superb in 1839,
and settled at Stonefield, Pine
P'orest. Though he never entered
the Parliamentary arena, Mr.
Henry Johnson was an active
public man in the early days, and took a deep interest in the affairs of the struggling
Province. Early in the “fifties,” he removed with his family to Victoria, and lived for
some years at Geelong. It was at the Grammar School of that seaside town that the
subject of this sketch received his education. Leaving school in 1865. he spent several
years in pastoral pursuits. Mr. Johnson’s life in the bush was well employed; for,
combining an observant with a receptive mind, he gathered in a store of experiences which in
after years delighted many readers when reproduced as smartly-written stories of overlanding,
river steamboating, camping, the shearing-shed, and the thousand-and-one phases which give
interest to the Australian bush. Mr. Johnson, wielding the pen of a ready writer, thus


early identified himself in writing descriptions of scenes and adventures of life in Australia.
Gradually he drifted into regular literary work, and, after contributing many stories and
sketches to intercolonial journals, he returned to his native Province in 1868, and joined
the staff of the South Australian Register. In connection with this journal he was not
long in making his mark His special articles on many subjects attracted much attention,
especially those on mining, which were read with a large degree of interest. Mr. Johnson
also acted as the Registers dramatic critic from 1873 to 1880. In 1880 he purchased
Adelaide Punch , which he conducted for several years, during which he sought to elevate
the tone of the satirical Press. Adelaide Punch is still remembered as a crisp weekly,
sparkling with smart satire and choice epigram. In 1880, Mr. Johnson rode over the
now famous Barrier Range country to the Mount Brown Diggings, and published his
experiences in the Press, and afterwards in a racy little work, “ Moses and Me, which
met with a large sale. “ Moses,” or “ Barrier Moses, ’ was the name of the pony which
Mr. Johnson rode, and the droll adventures of the two were told in a vein of graphic humor.
Some time after his return to Adelaide, Mr. Johnson relinquished journalism as a profession ;
and having purchased the Mount Cultaga Gold Mine, Boolcoomatta, commenced a career
of gold mining in South Australia. In 1881, Mr. Andrew Mitchell discovered gold near
Woodside, and Mr. Johnson, forming a company, opened what was called the “ Woodside
M ine,” on the Craigdarroch Estate. He then, in various parts of the district, employed
prospectors, including Captains Pleitner and McCracken, the latter of whom discovered
the “ Bird-in-Hand Mine ”on the land of Mr. James Shepherd. I his led to the finding
of several other promising mining properties, and nearly ,£IOO,OOO worth of gold has since
been raised in the neighborhood.
In 1884, in response to a requisition from a number of prominent gentlemen of
the district of Onkaparinga, Mr. Johnson became a candidate for Parliament, and was
returned as a member of the Assembly for that constituency. He felt his way in the
J J J
House cautiously at first, and spoke only when he had matter of special knowledge and
import to impart. He soon, however, began to take a prominent part in debates, and
became one of the leaders of the Protectionist movement, the advocates of which were
termed by him the “ Productionist Party,” but, as his speeches of that date and previous
days show, his policy was to make protection the first step towards intercolonial freetrade,
and thence to a federated Australia. Shortly afterwards he was elected by a majority
of the House a member of what was known as “The Triumvirate,” whose special mission
was to reduce the expense of the Government. Their joint labors resulted in a saving in
the estimates of ££o,ooo, and for the time being they were really the controlling power
in the country, the Government being to some extent powerless in their hands. On
June 3, 1887, Mr. Johnson initiated what was known as the Australian National Union. A
crowded and enthusiastic meeting was held at White’s Rooms, Adelaide, with the late Sir
John Cox Bray in the chair. In a rousing patriotic speech Mr. Johnson declared that the
prime object of the Union was to induce greater interest in political affairs, particularly
among young men, and, primarily and above all. to promote the federation of Australia.
The National Union afterwards amalgamated with the Australian Natives’ Association to
prevent duplication of work, as the objects of the two societies were found to be virtually
identical. Mr. Johnson afterwards became president, and being appointed on the South


Australian delegation, attended the Federation Conference of the Australian Natives’
Association in Melbourne, where good work in helping to draw up the plans for the
foundation ol the future Commonwealth of Australia was accomplished. Mr. Johnson was
also one of the committee who formed the Australian National League, an association
which has since proved a power in local politics. In 1887, on the defeat of the Downer
Government, Mr. Johnson became Minister of Education and Minister Controlling the
Northern 1 erritory in the second Playford Administration, which retained office for over
J J ’
two years. At the end of the financial year of 1888, the Government was able to show a
balance to credit of ,£173,000 in place of the debit balance of ,£295,303 for 1887: and
though the harvest for 1888-9 was a poor one, by economy the result for that year was a
credit balance of £33,000. Of this satisfactory result the Post and Telegraph Department,
under Mr. Johnson’s administration, showed a profit of £26,515 in 1887-8, and £27,084 in
1888-9. Although the number of free scholars had very materially increased, he succeeded
in considerably reducing the expenditure on education. He also made a special trip to the
Northern Territory, with the object of thoroughly enquiring into affairs there and reducing
the heavy cost of that dependency. This he succeeded in doing ; leaving a balance to the
good of ,£14,756. When the Playford Ministry went out of office, Mr. Johnson, as a
private member, did excellent work, and every motion he brought forward he succeeded in
getting the Assembly to accept. In 1895 he obtained leave of absence from his
Parliamentary duties, travelling through England and Europe, and remaining away two
years, during which he visited many of the leading art galleries and museums of the old
world. Whilst on this tour he purchased the painting by Charles Stuart, “ Golden
Autumn,” which, on his return, he presented to the South Australian National Gallery.
When in London, he was elected a F'ellow of the Geological Society, at one of whose
meetings his unique collection of Australian auriferous specimens was exhibited, and evoked
much favorable comment and admiration. This collection, which took Mr. Johnson many
years and much arduous labor to gather, was presented by him to the British Museum,
eliciting from the Governors of that institution a special vote of thanks, and a special
testimonial. A number of the richest and most ornamental specimens and nuggets were
presented by him to Her late Majesty Queen Victoria through the Colonial Secretary,
eliciting a very cordial letter of thanks from Her Majesty’s Private Secretary, accompanied
by a large, handsomely-framed portrait of the Queen.
In connection with mining, Mr. Johnson was one of the founders of the Australian
Institute of Mining Engineers, and is an honorary life member of the Australian Mine
Managers’ Association. He is the author of a technical book on gold-mining, entitled
“Getting Gold,” published by Messrs. Charles Griffin & Company, London, in 1897. Mr.
Johnson previouslv published one or two books on the same or similar subjects, but
these are now out of print. His stories and sketches of Australian life have been written
with those true touches of human interest and sympathetic coloring which have made the
Australian school of writers so popular, and bid fair to bring about a renaissance in Australian
literature with the upcoming of the young nation. Mr. Johnson retired from Parliament
in 1896, his career having been one made up of hard work, together with undoubted
success.

Mr. Charles Kimber
THE development of the Northern Areas of South Australia in the early days demanded
the highest class of pioneering talent. Not alone was the hardy physique that can
endure privation and climatic extremes required, but the skill and patient industry
that can turn the wilderness into the fruitful cornfield was also necessary. Ihe present
productiveness of the northern
portions of the Province has
resulted from the efforts ol perse-
vering: settlers, who added much
o ’
talent and industry to great
courage and endurance. Among
those whose well-directed abilities
and energy have contributed to
this end, is Mr. Charles Kimber,
who, as a public and commercial
man, played a very prominent part
in the Stanley District for many
years.
Mr. Kimber was born at
Newbury, Berkshire, England, on
January 13, 1826. He received a
sound education at private schools
in his native town, and subse-
quently removed to London, where
he entered the wholesale stationery
warehouse of Mr. James Norris,
207, Upper Thames Street. Here
Mr. Kimber spent seven years,
obtaining during that period a
valuable business experience. The
wide field of opportunities presented
in Australia at this time attracted
Mr. Kimber’s attention, and he determined to try his fortune in the new land. He
accordingly set sail in the ship John Woodhall, and arrived in South Australia on
January 5- 1849. Soon after reaching the Province Mr. Kimber obtained employment with
the firm of Messrs. Acraman, Cooke, & Co. These merchants were carrying' on business
J O
in blinders Street, Adelaide, and in their employ Mr. Kimber remained for several months,
after which he removed to the Burra. The copper industry was at that time in its prime, and
Mr. Kimber found employment with the Patent Copper Company there. The opening-up
of the Victorian gold diggings, however, had excited the minds of the adventure-loving
throughout the world, and Mr. Kimber, like many others, determined to test the reported


wealth of the new fields. He found his way to the gold camps of the sister colony, and
stayed there several months, but was not successful in meeting fortune as a miner. He
accordingly returned to the Burra district, and commenced business for himself as a storekeeper
at Redruth. Both mining and farming industries were prosperous in those days, and
Mr. Kimber’s venture proved a success. Having engaged in storekeeping for five years,
Mr. Kimber sold out and purchased a farm on the Wakefield River, in the neighborhood of
Mintaro, where he continued for another period of five years. In the meantime the Wallaroo
mines were discovered, and Mr. Kimber engaged for a brief space in a water-distilling
enterprise in that locality. Subsequently he purchased a mill at Clare, which was at that
time the most important centre north of Adelaide. Having; a thorough knowledge of business,
1 O O o
and personal qualities of a high order, Mr. Kimber soon became a man of standing in
Clare, and he succeeded in building up a large milling industry. Encouraged by the
prosperity which attended his operations, he then erected another large flourmill at Kadina,
and he was soon regarded as one of the most flourishing merchants in the North. He
purchased land at Clare, built a house, and founded a fine estate known as Woodleigh,
and famous for its fine orchard. Here Mr. Kimber lived for a period of 33 years.
The business abilities which Mr. Kimber had shown, combined with high integrity
O O j
and private worth, attracted public notice, and in 1887 he was persuaded to stand for
Parliament. With Mr. E. W. Hawker he was returned to the Assembly for Stanley
district in that year, and sat for three sessions with such conspicuous merit, that at the
end of the term he was again requisitioned to take the seat. With unaffected modesty
Mr. Kimber, however, declined the proffered honor, although he continued to do good
public work in Clare. He sat for three years as Chairman of the District Council, and,
after the incorporation of the town, for two years as mayor. Mr. Kimber also held the
post of Commissioner of Roads, and at an early date was invested with the Commission
of the Peace. In his capacity as a magistrate, he sat for several years as Chairman of
the Clare Licensing Bench. A few years ago Mr. Kimber sold his estate and business,
and he went to live in retirement at Glenelg. Twenty years ago Mr. Kimber visited England,
principally for health reasons, and spent six months enjoyably at home. On September
16, 1852, Mr. Kimber married Miss Nankervis, of the Burra, and he has had a large
family. Two sons, Messrs. William and Madron Kimber, are now the proprietors of large
wine-growing estates at Stanley Plat. Throughout his lengthy, varied, and successful
career in this Province, Mr. Kimber has ever maintained an unblemished reputation as a
public-spirited citizen, enterprising merchant, and as an honorable and courteous gentleman.
The late Mr. Walter Griffiths, M P.
BY the lamented death of Mr. Walter Griffiths on September 4, 1900, the House of
Assembly lost a member of considerable gifts, and the Northern Territory a
representative who was alive to its claims. He was born in Kent Town on July
4, 1867, and was educated at St. Aloysius’ College, near Clare, and at St. Peter's College,
Adelaide. When 16 years old he went to the Northern Territory, and entered into partnership
with Mr. V. L, Solomon. In April, 1893, he was elected to the House of Assembly. He
was fearless in debate, a ready speaker, and for some time “ Whip ” to the Country Party.

The late Rev William Longbottom
THROUGHOUT her history South Australia has been noted for the freedom given
within her confines to religious thought and development, and also for the strength
of her religious institutions. From the inception of local history the people have
been liberally provided with religious instruction, and, within a few years, representatives
of most of the principal denomina-
tions in Christendom had erected
their temples in the Province, in
which they might worship in the
faith and after the fashion of their
fathers.
Among the first sects to take
deep root in South Australia
was the Wesleyan, the founder of
which in the Province was prac-
tically the late Rev. William
Long-bottom. There were other
followers of that Church here
before him ; but he it was who
consolidated them and enhanced
their interests. From a humble
root, planted in 1837, has grown a
powerful tree, whose branches now-
spread over the whole Province.
The late Rev. William
Longbottom was born at Bingley,
Yorkshire, England, on December
10, 1799. He was educated for
the Wesleyan Church, and, after
being ordained, w ? as dispatched as
a missionary to India in 1827.
After some years of zealous labor, his health broke down, and he proceeded to Cape Colony.
After returning to India, his health again failed him, and he went, in 1837, to 1 asmania,
hoping to find in its genial climate surcease from bodily infirmity. A few months residence
seemed to improve him, whereupon he was appointed by the English Conference to take
up work in Western Australia, then a few years old. But circumstances decreed another
sphere. With his wife and son he took passage in the schooner Fanny , which was wrecked
near Lacepede Bay, South Australia, in 1838. All the passengers got safely to shore,
and, remote from settlement, made a tedious journey to Encounter Bay. I hey walked
in company along the desolate coastline by the Coorong. With a small boat they crossed


the Mur ray River, and were then able to continue their journey to the whaling station
near \ ictor Harbor. Ihe whalers and natives gave them a hearty welcome, and, in a
little vessel called the Lady Wellington, they sailed up the Gulf to Port Adelaide. A
few months later the brig Maria was wrecked near the same spot in Lacepede Bay,
and, after reaching the shore, all hands were murdered by the natives.
1 he shipwrecked minister and his family were hospitably received in Adelaide, and
a subscription to recoup their losses was started. The Rev. W. Longbottom was prevailed
upon to remain in the Province, and a small chapel was erected for him in Bindley
Street, about where the 1 heatre Royal now stands. There he began his ministrations,
and his congregation speedily grew in numbers and in strength. The chapel in Bindley
Street became so popular that a larger building was erected in Gawler Place, where the
warehouse of Messrs D. & W. Murray now stands, and there the Rev. W. Longbottom
continued his work. On November 27, 1838, Governor Gawler laid the foundation-stone.
Ihe cost was about and it provided seating accommodation for 500 persons. But
his spirit was stronger than his body, and he was compelled by ill health to relinquish
the charge in 1840, and again seek recuperation in Tasmania. He was succeeded in
Gawler Place by the Rev. John Plggieston, who was soon afterwards relieved by the
Rev. J. C. Weatherstone. The latter was not able to keep the congregation together,
and Mr. Longbottom was asked to return. From his pretty Tasmanian station at New
Norfolk he came back to Adelaide in 1844. and his earnestness and enthusiasm soon re-joined
the dissatisfied and scattering flock. For three years he occupied the pulpit. It was then
clear that his missionary work in India, his privations by shipwreck, and the energy he
infused into his local labors had permanently ruined his health ; and in 1847 his congregation
(says Mr. George E. Loyau in his “Representative Men of South Australia”), “out of pure
respect and gratitude to him, consented to his retirement, and made such provision as
enabled him to pass his declining years in comfort.” Be was succeeded by the Rev.
D. j. Draper, who, whilst returning from a visit to England, was lost in the Loudon . on
January 11, 1866.
Mr. Longbottom did not long survive his retirement. His strength, never very
good, wasted away, and on July 31, 1849, he died at his residence in Hackney, aged 50
years. But he had accomplished his mission, and started the Wesleyan Church in South
Australia on a splendid career. A memorial tablet to his memory has been placed in the
Pirie Street Wesleyan Church. Mrs. Longbottom, who was Miss Eagland, of Wakefield,
Yorkshire, was an excellent helpmeet to her husband. She had remarkable skill in acquiring-
languages, and, six months after her arrival in India, conducted classes in Tamil and
Portuguese. Her long life was devoted to good works. She died in 1873. The son,
Mr. William Longbottom, wrecked with his parents in Lacepede Bay, still lives in Adelaide.
He was born in India in 1832, and, though but six years old at the time, possesses a
clear recollection of the wreck incident. Mr. Longbottom, who was educated in Adelaide,
adopted a commercial career, and eventually became a partner with Sir John Colton in a
harness and hardware business.

Colonel Lovely
WE discover from a glance abroad that large numbers of men who are capable are
ready to devote their talents to the public cause. And occasionally they are
found to do this with no aim other than to faithfully serve their fellows. Ihe
springs of ambition, the pleasure to be derived from general approbation, may lead them
to such services; but, whatever
the motive, the results are useful
to the race. In these latter days
military matters are engaging
especial attention throughout
Australia ; and those who serve
the colonies in a leading position
in the Defence Force undoubtedly
deserve a special measure of
commendation.
James Chapman Lovely was
born in London, in the year 1844,
and, upon leaving school, was
articled to Alfred Cubitt Bean,
one of the engineers and
surveyors to the London Metro-
politan Board of Works, under
which gentleman he learnt the
duties of the profession. He
came to South Australia in 1864.
and joined the office of Messrs.
Green & Wadham, land agents
and surveyors, Adelaide, thus
entering upon that connection
with those phases ot the local
business world in which he has
won such a respected name. He
proved an acquisition to the firm, which is now known as Green & Company, and for the
last 22 years has been a partner in it. He has had an extended association with land
agency and surveying matters, and matters of importance to the industrial welfare of the
community have passed under his supervision, hor several years he was Chairman of the
Lefevre Peninsula District Council, and in that capacity he rendered the neighborhood it
served substantial service. In a great measure to his exertion was due the proclamation
of the Semaphore as a municipality in December, 1883, and during the three following
years he represented Largs Ward in the pioneer Council. In 1887 he occupied the honorable
position of Mayor of the Semaphore, and he well maintained the dignity of the municipality.


Colonel Lovely has been a member of the militia forces for over 30 years,
and he has largely assisted in popularising and organising the local service. He began
his military career as a cadet in the Second South Middlesex Rifle Corps, then under
the command of Lord Ranelagh. In this corps he served successively as a private, corporal,
sergeant, and color-sergeant, resigning only when he left for Australia. He joined the
local Rifle Volunteer borces in December, 1878, soon after their organisation, and received
his commission as Captain therein in 1879. He was able to give appreciated help to the
new institution, and, being both popular and efficient, rose rapidly in the service. In 1889,
as Lieutenant-Colonel, he raised the 3rd Regiment of Militia, which he commanded until the
inauguration of the new Force. He has held the appointment of an honorary Aide-de-camp
to four successive Governors, viz. : —Sir William Robinson, the Earl of Kintore, Sir Eowell
Buxton, and to His Excellency Lord Tennyson; this latter position he still holds. In
1899 he was ordered back to the active list, and instructed to reorganise the rst Battalion
A. R., which, having been accomplished, he was in November, 1900, promoted to the rank
of Colonel, and appointed Officer Commanding the Brigade. As a commandant and
tactician, Colonel Lovely is well regarded by his brother officers and by the men under him.
Mr. James Gordon, S.M.
ADELAIDE has been exceedingly fortunate in having been served by able stipendiary
magistrates, and Mr. James Gordon, the present president of the City Police
Court, ranks in ability with any of his predecessors in that position. He was born in
Glasgow, on October 29, 1856, and was brought to South Australia when quite an infant. His
father, the Rev. James Gordon, was a highly respected Presbyterian minister at Gawler ; and
his brother, the Hon. J. H. Gordon, 0.C., is the present Attorney-General. Mr. James Gordon
attended for some years the school at Gawler conducted by the Rev. Thomas Smellie, and
afterwards went to the St. George’s School, of which Mr. L. S. Burton was the headmaster.
Like his brother, Mr. Gordon decided to embrace the legal protession, and he was articled
to Mr. Bonnar, a Strathalbyn solicitor ; but after a short period his articles were transferred
to his brother, Mr. J. H. Gordon, who was already a solicitor. In 1881, Mr. James Gordon
was admitted to practice, and opened an office at Port Adelaide. Thence he removed to
Port Pirie, where he soon obtained a satisfactory amount of business. P'or eight years he
remained at the northern port, during which period he actively interested himself in
municipal affairs, and was for one year Mayor of Port Pirie. In April, 1890, he joined the
then firm of Gordon, Nesbit, & Bright, with whom he practised for two years. Finally, in
June, 1892, he relinquished personal practice to take the post of Stipendiary Magistrate at
Port Adelaide, with the charge of the Courts of the Midland District. Upon the death of
Mr. P ater, later in the same year, Mr. Gordon took up the more important magisterial
duties at the City Police Court of Adelaide, which he still performs. This was a quick
promotion, and justified the trust reposed in him. His office is no sinecure, for upon the
Chief Police Magistrate depends, to a considerable extent, the morality of the city. A
determined, fearless magistrate in the Lower Courts has probably more influence over the
morality of the community than the Chief Justice, or other Supreme Judges. He has
summary power, and can instil into the minds of offenders a respect for law, and a fear of
its clutches. FF

The late Hon. James Martin, M.L.C.
THE annals of the late Hon. James Martin contain many stories of hard-fought
battles and uphill endeavor, and serve to illustrate the sterling and strenuous
qualities of the man. He was born in 1821, in the village of Foundry (which
secured its name from a foundry managed by his grandfather), in the parish of Stithians,
in Cornwall. His father was in
business as a mechanic, and when
he died there was no one to undertake
the control of his works. His mother
was left a widow in poor circum-
stances, with six young children (the
subject of the present memoir not
being then born) to support. It was
therefore necessary for the sons to
work for their own living from an
early age, and the following; account
J o o
will show to what extent Mr. James
Martin succeeded. According to a
recent biographical sketch given in
the Adelaide Observer (to which we
are indebted for most of the informa-
tion here set forth), he “inherited
mechanical tastes ” from both sides of
the family, and soon evinced a decided
predilection for such pursuits. But
the road to gratifying them was long
and sometimes dreary, and it may be
J J
said that whatever success he attained
has been by dauntless perseverance in
obedience to his own desires. It was
not possible for him to have much
schooling, for the reason already
stated, and when very young- he was
J J O
compelled to earn his own living. After working as a lad for some time in his native
town, he went to Truro, where he was employed as a millwright. Here he became associated
with the Treseaven Mine, and was enabled to demonstrate his natural adaptability to
engineering work. At that time the first man-engine was used in England. To save
miners the exhausting exertion of climbing to the surface by ladders hundreds of feet long,
a reward of was offered for some mechanical contrivance that would obviate the
necessity. The engineer of the mine prepared a drawing, and Mr. Martin was instructed
to construct a model from it for submission to the gentlemen who had to judge of its merits.
The contrivance was accepted, and, as one authority states, “ marks an important epoch


in the mining history of England.” Mr. Martin’s model is treasured in the Polytechnic
Hall at Falmouth. Eventually Mr. Martin severed his connection with the Treseaven
M ine, and obtained employment in a, woollen factory at Ponsuooth, where he had to
engage in all sorts of work. But, we are told, “ the greater the difficulties, the more
determined was he to surmount them, and usually he was successful. This determination
to overcome obstacles was the secret of much of his success in after-life.’ Working, however,
in damp and draughty mills was not conducive to health, and Mr. Martin soon became
subject to asthma. The rigorous climate of the old country accentuated the trouble, and
he accordingly determined to seek the warmer and drier atmosphere of Australia. He chose
the southern Province as his future home, and here he arrived in 1847, being then 26
years of age. He associated himself with mechanical affairs in the employ of Mr. Ridley,
who, four years before, invented the now celebrated reaper or stripper. At Mr. Ridleys
workshops at Hindmarsh Mr. Martin assisted in the manufacture of these machines.
The time came when he felt competent to start in business on his own behalf,
and, after enquiry, he determined to open workshops at Gawler, then a quaint little village
in the bush. On June 15, 1848, he set out for this pioneer centre in a dray, which also
contained his wafe, furniture, and a few tools, constituting all his belongings. Previous to
his arrival he had secured a shop, the site of which is now a very small portion of the
huge works of Martin & Co. Although there was then no opening for mechanical work,
save in the manufacture of bullock-drays and the effecting of repairs to farming implements,
Mr. Martin had an eye to the future, and foresaw that, as the Province developed, Gawler
would become an important centre. His foresight has since been amply demonstrated.
One of the first tasks which he set himself was “ to cut down a tree and, from the timber,
construct benches and a lathe.” This lathe is kept in the present large establishment as
a cherished relic of pioneerdom. “ For the first little while I was here,’ says Mr. Martin,
“it was a terrible job to get along. Sometimes, after paying my men only a portion of
their wages, I had not 4d. left to take a letter out of the post office.” The story of the
beginning, and of the contrast with the present, is thus told by the Observer writer :-
“ d'lie original site comprised only a few feet ; the area now occupied by the firm which
has grown out of that humble beginning is 18 acres. Mr. Martin began operations with
one man ; to-day about 700 are employed. He commenced by building bullock-drays ;
as agriculture extended he took up the manufacture of reaping machines and other agricultural
implements ; then mining machinery ; and now the establishment produces railway locomotives
which are declared to be equal to any made in the world. At first the trade was strictly
local : then the reputation of the firm —for Mr. Martin soon took unto himself partners
rapidly spread into other districts, and demands for agricultural implements flowed in from
all parts of the Province. Later, orders were received from neighboring colonies, and to-day
the business of Martin & Co. has ramifications in all parts of Australia, and extends even
to South Africa and New Caledonia.” This extract will convey an adequate idea of the
enormous development of the business; and it will be understood especially when the
circumstances of the Province are taken into consideration- —that it could not be attained
without skill, good management, energy, and discernment, coupled with indomitable industry.
Better days arrived when, after the return of the gold-diggers from Victoria, the


agricultural lands of the North were opened up. Mr. Martin bid with resourcefulness and
perseverance for the consequent business in supplying farming implements, and, )\ aci it) o
invention and a comprehensive study of the wants of farmers, he obtained the most of
it. “ Although,” says the chronicler, “ Mr. Martin was not a blacksmith, he frequently
took anvil work, and made many a professed smith look foolish by the dexterity and skill
of his amateur hand. In busy times he has toiled at the fire from 6 o’clock in the morning
till i i o’clock at night for weeks at a stretch.” The firm was decidedly happy in inventing
machinery suitable to the environment of agricultural pursuits in the Province, and led
the way in improvements which revolutionised the industry. Wherever farms wete
established—in the remote north or in the far south—its reaping machines and ploughs
were seen at work. The cost of production was made cheaper to the farmers, and the
implements were gradually reduced In price. The first stripper manufactured by Mr. Martin
was sold for ,£150; to-day he sells a better machine for less than ,£SO. He was the fust
to use the thimble-comb and the clutch motion on the reaper ; and in his workshops the
stump-jumping plough was invented. He first manufactured iron from local ores. His
conquests in agricultural and mining machinery could not be enumerated here. “It is
estimated,’’ continues the Observer, “that Messrs. Martin N Co. have constructed more
than 15,000 reaping machines. A large portion of their present output is for export. A
few months ago they dispatched in one day 39 trucks of machinery, weighing more than
200 tons, and having a value of upwards of ,£IO,OOO. Mr. Martin had very little capital
when he started; it now takes ,£150,000 to run the business.” The firm has manufactured
locomotives and carriages to the order of the South Australian Government, and in this
has fulfilled a beneficial purpose by keeping capital and labor within the 1 ro\ ince. It
can be said that there is no more pretentious and useful business house ot the kind in South
Australia, and certainly none which has conferred such substantial advantages upon the
* J
inhabitants.
To come now to the more personal aspect of Mr. Martin s career, as relating to
his services to municipal and political government. By means of his extensive enterprise
he was largely the maker of the town of Gawler —the principal means ot its growth.
Though his business demanded much of him, he found time to help nearly every public
movement with which the townspeople have been connected. Atter the municipality was
founded, he was elected an Alderman. Three years later he became Mayor of the town,
being the first to occupy that position after the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act.
For eight years from that time he occupied the mayoral chair, and was only once opposed,
that occasion being when he first offered his services. He was enabled to greatly improve
the city and to devise by-laws and support measures to ensure health and comfort to the
ratepayers. Thus, in a double sense, he was as a parent to Gawler. “It is related that
on one occasion, being very busy at the anvil at the time of the declaration of the poll,
he appeared in his shirt-sleeves straight from the fire, returned thanks, and hurried back
to his work. Conventionality, in his career, always had to give way to necessity. In
still other respects Mr. Martin was a useful support to Gawler. He was one of the founders
of the local Institute, gave a portion of the land on which the building stands, and supplied
the plans for the structure. He was the first 1 reasurer of the Institute, and was also a
trustee. He rendered great assistance to the Gawler Agricultural Society, and was for
several years Captain of the local Volunteers,

Mr. Martin was a useful representative in Parliament for the district. Here,
also, he did what he could, and he did it conscientiously and with the best motives, hor
four years, 1865-8, he represented Barossa in the House of Assembly, and in
1885 he was elected to the Legislative Council for the North-Eastern District. Taking
a close interest in the debates, and being a keen practical man who was listened to with
attention and respect, he was often able to decide the fate ot a measure by his advice
and influence. Privately his character was as sturdy, intelligent, and kindly as publicly.
He died on December 27, 1899, at the ripe age of 77.
The Rev. Henry Girdlestone, M.A.
IT was on July 15, 1847, that the Collegiate School of St. Peter was opened to a moderate
attendance of pupils. The early struggles were so successfully and quickly overcome
that improved buildings were in course of erection two years later, and on May 24,
1849, Bishop Short laid the foundation stone of the present attractive structure. The
group of buildings now comprising the College is located in handsome grounds, tastefully
laid out and furnished with trees, and containing 30 acres of play ground. Among the
additions to the original building are new schoolrooms, a chapel, a gymnasium, and a fives
court. At present there is accommodation for 50 boarders. Among the headmasters, since
the inception of the College, have been gentlemen of great culture and talent; and among
the “old boys” are some of the most prominent men of the Province. The present
Headmaster, Mr. Henry Girdlestone, M.A., has as yet sojourned but a short while in South
Australia, but not too short for the recognition that his abilities and capacities are of a
high order. Henry Girdlestone was born at Penkridge, Staffordshire, England, in 1863, but
spent nearly all his early life at Bathampton. Mr. Girdlestone attended the Bath College
for some years, and in 1882 he entered at Magdalen College, Oxford. He pursued a
bright University career, and in 1886 obtained his B.A. degree. In 1889 he took his
M.A. degree with honors in Mathematics and Natural Science. For two years, 1885-6,
he was stroke of the victorious University Plight. Upon leaving Oxford, Mr. Girdlestone
was for two years private tutor to Lord Ashtown, after which he accepted a mastership
at Bath College, his old school. At the end of 1893 Bishop Kennion offered him the
appointment of Headmaster of St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, which he accepted, and in
February, 1894, he arrived in this Province to take up his new duties. During the
ensuing years he has more than sustained the reputation of the College, and has won
for himself general good will. It is certain that the destiny of the old College will not
suffer under his superior supervision.

The late Mr. George McEwin
MUCH of the nomenclature of South Australia memorialises the names of pioneers
who have labored in the cause of the Province. The names of the streets and
squares of Adelaide, country towns and villages, and special localities here and
there, have been derived from this source ; and. if the original names be euphonious, no
more appropriate way could be found
of paying lasting tribute to the foun-
ders. Such is the case as regards
the late Mr. G. McEwin, whose
name is perpetuated at Glen Ewin,
about 12 miles from the metropolis.
Mr. George McEwin was born
in the south of Scotland in 1815, and
became a landscape gardener by
occupation. Plant-life in all its forms
supplied him with much-loved study,
and he was a botanist of considerable
ability. At the age of 18 he made a
J O
classification of the plants of Scotland,
and so thorough was this work that
he was elected a life member of the
Arboricultural Society of Scotland.
From Scotland, Mr. McEwin went to
Liverpool, where he laid out a number
of large gardens and delivered lectures
o o
on botany. In 1839 he arrived in
South Australia with his young wife,
and it is said that he marked out
some of the oldest and best gardens
in and about the city. In 1844 he
took up his residence in the locality
which received its name from him,
and in the same year visited New South Wales, and purchased plants and trees which
he considered were adapted to South Australian soil. These he planted at Glen Ewin,
and he soon surrounded himself there with a charming orchard and vineyard, and also a
pleasing ornamental garden. While he spent his time partly in attending these, and partly
in landscape gardening for other settlers, his orchard came into bearing ; but at first there
was a difficulty in obtaining a market for its productions. In iB6O he hit upon the plan
of manufacturing jams and preserves, and this business eventually attained intercolonial
importance. T*he products of the factory had a ready sale, and the concern became one
of the largest of the kind in South Australia. It is still carried on by Mr. Robert


McEwin, the son of the founder. Mr. McEwin thus rose to an influential position, and
was able to devote himself to questions of public utility.
Out of his experience, gained by study, observation, and experiment in plant-life,
he was able to tender good advice to colonists. He was an authority on horticultural
and agricultural matters, and contributed largely to the Press on these subjects,
but especially on horticulture. His work, “ The Vigneron’s and Gardener’s Manual,”
went through several editions, and was of very practical use to those concerned. Many
articles from his pen also appeared‘in local newspapers on fruit-trees and vines and ornamental
trees. He obtained a gold medal from the Scottish Arboricultural Society for a paper on
I he Natural Porests of South Australia”; and in 1877, from the same source, he won
a silver medal for the best essay on “ Arboriculture,” and the souvenir is now in the possession
of his family. He was for years a member of the Forest Board and of the Agricultural
and Horticultural Society. Besides excellent advice given on subjects which by occupation
he was specially interested in, he rendered service to the public in other respects. He
was appointed by the Government a member of the Central Road Board, and was for
many years Returning Officer for the district of Gumeracha, a position in which his son
has succeeded him. He was a Justice of the Peace, and was quite celebrated throughout
his district for his decisions. Having made some study of the law, he was able to adjudicate
with more than the usual success of the unpaid magistrate, and fulfilled a still higher function
by so advising many who called upon him on the legal aspect of their claims and complaints
that cases were settled out of court with dispatch and satisfaction.
After about two month’s illness, Mr. McEwin died on August 8, 1885, in his
70th year. His wife had predeceased him, and both were highly esteemed and beloved.
Mr. F. D. Harris, LL.B.
AMONG the most influential men of Gawler is Mr. F. 1). Harris, who has the distinction
of being the first native-born to occupy the position of Mayor. He was born on
fuly 15, 1864, and is the youngest son of the late Mr. James Harris, founder of
the well-known country firm of James Harris & Sons, storekeepers, of Gawler and Kapunda.
He was educated at .St. George's School, Gawler, conducted by the late Mr. L. S. Burton,
and at the Glenelg Grammar School, the principal of which was the late Mr. Frederick
Caterer, B.A. Late in 1881 he was articled to Sir John Bray, and served under Bray
and Sheridan and Bray & Hackett. Law seemed to be a congenial study, and in December,
rBB6, he took the LL.B. degree at the Adelaide University, and in the same month was
admitted to the Bar. Almost immediately after resuming his residence in Gawler, Mr.
Harris began to take a part in local public movements, and he has since occupied the
most influential offices in the gift of the townspeople. He was elected to represent the
East Ward in the Gawler Corporation) in December, 1893, and, after serving for three
years, was elected to the mayoralty in 1896-7. Mr. Harris in later years has been associated
with numerous local bodies and societies, to follow which must occupy a great deal of his
time. He is a Past Worshipful Master of the Gawler Lodge of Freemasons.

Professor William Mitchell, M.A., D.Sc.
PROFESSOR WILLIAM MITCHELL, M.A., D.Sc., is justly credited with being a
distinguished acquisition to South Australian talent. He was born at Inveravon,
Banffshire, Scotland, in 1861, and received his preliminary education at Elgin,
whence he proceeded to the Edinburgh University. His career there was highly distinguished,
and he took the degrees of Master
of Arts and Doctor of Science.
While yet comparatively young, in
1886, he was appointed Lecturer
in Ethics at the University of
Edinburgh, alter which he held
successively such honorable offices
as Lecturer on Education at Uni-
versity College, London, Examiner
in Philosophy at the University of
Edinburgh, and Examiner in the
1 heory of Education at the
University of Cambridge. The
J o
enumeration of these offices illus-
trates the confidence and respect
which Professor Mitchell’s talents
commanded at these seats of
learning. In 1894 he came to the
University of Adelaide as Hughes
J o
Professor of Knglish Literature and
of Mental and Moral Philosophy.
He has contributed important
articles on philosophical subjects to
British and American Reviews, and
his work at the local University
meets with high commendation.
Professor Joshua Ives, M.B.
PROFESSOR JOSHUA IVES was born near Manchester in 1854. He arrived in
Adelaide in March, 1885. Within a month he delivered his inaugural address, framed
the regulations for the new degrees of music, formulated the course for students, and
mapped out his lectures. The late Sir Thomas Elder having provided means for establishing
a Conservatorium of Music, Professor Ives went to England in 1897 to enquire into the
latest developments in teaching the Musical Art. and upon the result of his investigations
in England and the Continent, the Elder Conservatorium of Music was founded in Adelaide.
This Institution has the right to grant diplomas, associateships, and scholarships.

Mr. Samuel James Mitchell, LL.B.
II was one of the Earl of Beaconsfield’s favorite beliefs that a person with brains
could achieve whatever he willed. The laws of destiny were not altogether obscure
to him, but actions, he demanded, must be embraced to help destiny. By work
and study and observation, strenuous and sedulous, the o'oal could be reached. We
now and then discover In our
midst examples which tend to
give testimony to these conclu-
sions. It is so in the case of
Mr. Mitchell, who, when beyond
the usual period at which men
generally seek to learn a profes-
sion, devoted himself to the study
of the law, and made himself a
master of it. There have been
other similar examples in South
Australia— notably Mr. J. M.
Stuart (Crown Solicitor) and
the late Mr. Ash, M.P.
Samuel James Mitchell was
born at Mount Barker, South
Australia, in 1852, and was
educated at Mitton’s Academy,
Adelaide, and at other private
schools. Upon leaving school he
went to Port Augusta, where he
entered into commercial pursuits,
eventually establishing himself
there as an auctioneer. Pie
seemed to be admirably adapted
for this avocation, at which he
flourished. fie gained a sub-
stantial connection, and became, besides, one of the leading public men of the northern
port. He was for some years a member of the Port Augusta Council, and for two
years occupied the mayoral chair, and was appointed a Justice of the Peace.
While pursuing a successful career as an auctioneer, Mr. Mitchell determined to
fulfil his long-cherished wish and become a lawyer. Although above the normal age
for embarking in this profession, he was bent upon carrying out his intention. Coming
to Adelaide, he articled himself to the firm of Messrs. H. E. & H. F. Downer, arranging,
however, for the privilege of being allowed to attend the University in the pursuance of


his studies. Despite the difficulty, especially severe in the case of adults, of being
cramped in a dry and routine study, he made rapid progress in his new profession. In
recognition of his business abilities, he was, meanwhile, given the management of the
office. In 1889 he took the LL.B. degree at the Adelaide University, and in the following
year opened in practice in the city as a barrister, solicitor, and notary. In this new sphere
he realised his expectations by becoming a very successful practitioner. His practice in
the Supreme, Criminal, and Petty Courts became extensive, and he has been complimented
by the Bench for his success in conducting important cases. In legal circles he is known
rather as a good all-round man than as a specialist. His clients have reason to be as satisfied
with his work as he has himself. Mr. Mitchell has been a member of the committee of
the Glenelg Institute since its inception. He is also an enthusiastic b reemason, and was
Worshipful Master of his Lodge at Port Augusta. He has been the president of the
Electric Telegraph Association of South Australia ever since its foundation. Until recently
he has resisted many requests to enter the political arena, but now aspires to represent the
Northern Territory in Parliament. His career is an example for ambitious young men, and
should encourage them in their desire to attain success in any sphere. Mr. Mitchell is a
collected, vigilant, persistent man of strong will. Whatever he sets his mind to do. he
accomplishes. His successes are not envied ; for it is on all hands agreed that whatever
he achieves he deserves.
Mr. James Thompson Hackett, B.A.
AMONG the few legal men in South Australia who have acted as leader-writers on the
daily newspapers is Mr. Hackett, one time partner of the genial and popular
politician, Sir John Cox Bray. Mr. James Thompson Hackett, 8.A., was born in
the Colony of Victoria in 1858. His preliminary education was received in the Melbourne
Public Schools, and afterwards he studied at the Melbourne University, where he took his
degree in Arts. The University of Adelaide was then beginning its career, and the
schools of this Province were recruiting their teaching staff in preparation for the higher
standard of education which the University required. Mr. Hackett was asked to accept
the position of master at Whinham College, and came to the Province for this purpose at
the age of 18. Subsequently, in 1881, acting on the kindly advice of Mr. Justice Bundey
(then Mr. Bundey, Q.C.), he resigned his office of pedagogue and turned to the law
articling himself to Mr. Sheridan, the partner of Sir John Bray. During the short term
of his articles two prizes were offered, one on the comparison of Roman and English Law,
and the other on the Growth of the Constitution under the Stuarts, and both were secured
by Mr. Hackett. In three years he was admitted to practice, and was immediately
afterwards taken into full partnership by Sir John Bray. The two gentlemen continued in
partnership until 1891, when Sir John went to England to take up the duties of Agent-
General. Since that year Mr. Hackett has practised on his own responsibility. Mr.
Hackett has from time to time visited the other parts of the world, and as he has not
yet passed his fortieth year, he has many valuable years still before him.

Mr. David Moody
THE pretty South Australian town of Kapunda possesses a by no means uninteresting
history. Upon the surrounding district, some half a century ago, depended the
immediate prosperity—-almost success —of the whole Province. Until the arrival
of the late Captain Grey (afterwards Sir George Grey), who brought the community
out 01 the teeth of insolvency, little
developmental work had been
done, and there were few realisable
assets. Governor Grey sought to
J O
drive the population out of
Adelaide into the rural districts.
He succeeded ; but their struggles
in endeavoring to cultivate the
wilderness were often disheartening.
New hope arose, however, when
it was announced, in the by-gone
day, that copper had been dis-
covered at Kapunda. General
attention was at once directed to
that district, and then, for two or
three years, anxiety as to the
value of the deposit was keen.
The Kapunda Copper Mines were
equal to the occasion, and they
practically inaugurated a prosperous
era in South Australia. Thev
drew population and capital to the
Province, whose history accordingly
at once took a brighter tone.
Although the high prosperity of
these copper mines did not last
more than 25 years (authorities
maintain that they are not half
worked out, if only the inflow of water could be coped with), they fulfilled a most
important purpose. Kapunda became a pretentious country centre, and that position it
has since retained because of the wealth of the surrounding land resources. At one time
the District of Light raised one-third of the entire wheat supply of the Province. The
subsequent career of the town has been quiet, but not unprosperous.
The district has produced some useful legislators, and, among the number, Sir
Jenkin Coles and Mr. David Moody are not the least. Ihe latter has served the district
for over 40 years. He was born in County Londonderry, Ireland, in November, 1834,


and was the youngest of a family of ten sons and four daughters ; seven of the sons became
South Australian colonists, four still surviving It has been a hardy family, and one brother,
residing in Ireland, is now in his 90th year; while a cousin who died recently attained
the extremely venerable age of 98. Mr. David Moody has been interested in South
Australia since his infancy, his brothers having resided in the Province for seven years
before he left Ireland, in 1857. At about that period Melbourne, in the mind of the
average Britisher, included the whole of Australia, and, beyond that then mushroom
city, and the Victorian goldfields, he knew practically nothing of the distant continent.
As a consequence, during the goldfields excitement, few ships but those specially engaged
in local trade sailed direct from Great Britain for South or Western Australia, or even
for New South Wales ; and passengers for any of these colonies had frequently to ship
to Melbourne and then make their way to their destinations as best they could, in many
cases their want ot knowledge of the country landing them in serious difficulties on the
journey. Many instances are recorded where emigrants from the old country, in coming
to settle among friends in other colonies, cheerfully took passage to Melbourne, believing
that, upon their arrival, they could comfortably walk from one colony to another. The
consequence was that they had to endure much hardship and delay before they could
join their friends.
Mr. Moody, however, was not so badly informed. Ile possessed a fair knowledge
of Australia, and knew what was before him when he arrived in Melbourne. Pie was
fortunate in securing an early passage to his destination in South Australia ; for, although
he ate his Christmas dinner in the sister capital in 1857, he partook of the following
New Years Day meal in Adelaide. Mr. S. B. Mood)', one of the brothers, had previously
been engaged in farming in the Truro district of the Province; but in March, 1858, Messrs.
I)., W. A., and S. B. Moody purchased land in the Light (Kapunda) district, where they
entered largely into agricultural operations. Mr. David Moody shortly afterwards proceeded
to the Ovens gold-diggings in Victoria ; but though he worked laboriously on the claims,
he obtained sufficient returns only for what would be termed good wages in these days.
While he was away, his brother, Mr. W. A. Moody, died; and, after 15 months’ absence,
Mr. I). Mood)' returned to Kapunda to assist in the management of the property.
Subsequently, Mr. S. B. Moody dissolved partnership with his brother; and about 1878
the rabbits in the district became so troublesome that Mr. S. B. Moody sold his property
and settled in Yorke Peninsula, Mr. D. Moody remaining in the Light district. He is
now the possessor of a fairly extensive estate in that part, which he has cultivated for over
40 years.
Although it cannot be said that Mr. Moody has shown very great predilection
for public life, he has yet taken an active part in important movements at Kapunda. He
was elected at the head of the poll at the first election of District Councillors in that
town. He did not remain long in the Council, but on several occasions since has held
a scat m the chamber. In 18/8 he was elected to the blouse of Assembly as member
for Light, his colleagues being Mr. James White and Mr. James Shannon. The rabbit
plague was an absorbing topic of conversation in the neighborhood, its ravages having
caused serious loss to the tanners and graziers. It was made an election cry, and with
good reason ; for Mr. Moody, at a low estimate, set down his losses in 1879, throuo-h damao'e
' O


lo his crops from this cause, at /, 4,000. He very earnestly pressed the subject on the
attention of 1 arliament, and was largely instrumental in inducing the Government to adopt
remedial measures. Mr. Moody did not offer himself for re-election in 188r, but in 1884
he was again returned for Light. In 1887 he retired, and did not come forward again
until 1890, when he was defeated after a close contest. The electors, however, once
more expressed their sense of his worth in 1896; but in 1899 he again suffered defeat.
His knowledge of the country, gained in a long experience, and his sensible views on
other subjects, constituted Mr. Moody a serviceable member of Parliament. His record
is one of useful deeds.
Brigadier-General Gordon
DURING recent years the South Australian military forces have been reorganised, and
in this work that highly-esteemed officer, Brigadier-General Gordon, has been the
leading spirit. He is practically the father of the present laws relating to the
forces, and has pursued quite a distinguished career in colonial military affairs. Brigadier-
General Gordon was born in the year 1856, at Xeres, Andalusia, Spain, where his father
was British Consul. He came to South Australia in 1881. For five months he acted as
drill-instructor to the Mounted Police, alter which he was appointed Lieutenant-Staff Instructor
of the Rifle Volunteer Force. He was, in September, 1882, gazetted Lieutenant in command
of the Permanent Military Force, and his quick promotions have been well earned. He
devoted himself enthusiastically to organising the force, and in August, 1883, got a captain’s
commission, and in May, 1885, a major’s. Six months after the latter date he was
appointed Acting Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General of the Military Forces, and on May
24, 1886, Hon. A. I). C. to his Excellency the Governor. Two years later, in the absence
of the Commandant—from February 1, 1888, to April 1, 1888—he held the position of
Acting Commandant of the Forces, with the rank of Colonel. Again, in November, 1892,
upon the departure of Major-General Downes, he occupied the same important office, and
in March, 1893, received the popular and distinguished appointment of Commandant, with
the rank of Colonel on the Staff. In 1894-5 a new Bill, dealing with the Defence Forces,
was drafted, and at the request of the Government, Brigadier-General Gordon undertook
the difficult task. It provided for the re-organisation of the Forces, and embodied all the
principles recommended for inclusion in the F'ederal Forces Act. The Bill was passed in
December, 1895, ar >d the new regulations were published in May, 1896. Brigadier-General
Gordon, who, on February 29, 1892, married Eily, second daughter of the late Mr. Edward
Fitzgerald, of Castlemaine, Victoria, has the distinction of holding 14 commissions—two in
the Imperial Service, and 12 in the service of South Australia. His colonial career has
been a bundle of felicitous circumstances which, in honoring himself, has advantaged the
Province. His work in connection with the Permanent Force, with the South Australian
Defences Act, and as Commandant of the local forces, has marked him out as a military
officer of superior talent and high standing.

Captain William Henry Morish
THE mines of Cornwall are, and have been for scores of years, an important factor in
the progress of that Western County of England, and in order to maintain this
prosperity, the study of mineralised deposits, as well as the practice of mining, is
a sine qua non in Cornish homes. I hus from his earliest days the young Cornishman
becomes conversant with the ways
of mining and mining procedure,
and in the hard school of practical
experience acquired his knowledge
of the science of recovering mineral
treasure from the bowels of the
earth. Where the benefit of Cor-
nish mining to Australia lies, is in
the fact that so many of the sons
of the westernmost county ol
England have come to the colonies.
Captain William Henry
Morish was born at I ruro, Corn-
wall, in 1844. True to the traditions
of his surroundings, he engaged in
mining at an early age. and when
16 vears old he left for South
Wales, where for two years he
labored in the coal and iron mines
in that part of the old country.
He then resolved to come to
South Australia. After his arrival
in the Province, he was employed
in the Wallaroo mines, where he
spent his 21 st birthday. When
he had been two years at work
in the copper mines of the
Peninsula, he, like so many others, decided to try his luck at gold-mining in \ ictoria.
He. spent nearly 20 years of his life on the famous goldfields of Ballarat and Bendigo;
and soon gaining distinction in the mining world, he acted as manager of a large number
of well-known mines in the Ballarat district. Thence he went to Cobar, New South \\ ales,
and there acted as underground manager of the Great Cobar Copper Mining Company.
He remained at Cobar till 1886, when he proceeded to Broken Hill as manager of the
Broken Hill South and Central Mines. Captain Morish was eminently successful in his
management of these mines. A man of remarkably shrewd judgment, he early invested
in the Great Barrier silver mines, and in 1888, having acquired a fortune, he retired from


active business pursuits, coming to Adelaide to live. His home, “ Bucklands, is situated
at Plympton, and is beautiful both in approaches and appointments.
Alter a career in the colonies in which many events have been crowded, Captain
Morish is now reaping the reward of the days of toil. He is a sturdy-framed and strong-
minded man. On all the mining fields he has been associated with he has borne a name
for integrity and uprightness. He is distinguished by warmth of heart, and has earned
general respect and goodwill.
Mr. Theodore Hack
MR. THEODORE HACK is a native of Echunga, South Australia, and was born
in 1840. He attended the popular and successful educational establishment of
Mr. J. L. \oung, Adelaide, and upon leaving that academy, spent some six years
on the sheep station in the South-East owned by his father, the late Mr. J. B. Hack. In
[863 Mr. Hack entered the Customs Department of the Civil Service, and was for some
time Boarding Officer at the Semaphore. Then he became Assistant Tide Surveyor,
Sub-Collector of Customs, and Harbormaster at Willunga. He was connected with the
Customs for five years, after which he was transferred to the Public Works Department
as Corresponding Clerk in the Engineer-in-Chiefs office. He filled his varied duties in
these several positions with gratifying success, and in [869 was appointed Public
Works Storekeeper and Customs Agent, a position which he held until 1874, when he
retired from the Government service. In September. 1874, he became managing partner
in the newly-established firm of Robin & Hack, large timber merchants at Port Adelaide.
The business thrived until 188s, when a devastating; fire in the timber yards during - a
< ’ J O
period of serious financial depression, brought it to the ground. Mr. Hack then started
business as a valuator and general commission agent, as well as an architect. He
still pursues these occupations. After leaving the Government service, Mr. Hack began
to take some part in public matters. In Port Adelaide he was for some years a
Councillor; and for two years he occupied the Mayoral chair. Subsequently he became
a member of the Semaphore Council, and was the first Mayor of that Municipality. For
10 years he was a member of the Central Road Board, as representative of the corporations
and district councils ; and he has long been a member of committee of the Chamber of
Manufactures. When, prior to the historical Eederation Convention held in Sydney in
1891, a conference of Australian commercial magnates was held in Melbourne to discuss
a commercial basis of federation between the colonies, Mr. Hack was chosen as one of
the five delegates from the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures. He offered himself
to the electors of Gumeracha for the House of Assembly in 1890, and was returned; but
failed at the general elections of 1893, owing to the splitting of votes among candidates
of similar views. Whilst a member of Parliament he was Chairman of the Select Committee
appointed to enquire into the advisability of constructing a light railway across the Murray
Plats to connect with the intercolonial line at Monarto,

Mr. Charles Richard Morris
'HP' chief port of a country is the gateway to the kingdom of commerce , and it
j is well that there are men at the civic helm in these towns who are closely
allied with the mercantile interests of the community, for, on account of their
business training, they thoroughly know the requirements of the locality.
O ✓ O J A
Charles Richard Morris,
whose name is identified with the
progress of Port Adelaide, the
chief sea-gate of South Australia,
was born at Noarlunga, South
Australia, on March 13. 1863, his
grandfather having been a pioneer
merchant in the latter years of the
“forties.” Young Morris completed
his education privately in Adelaide;
and in 1876 entered the office of
Messrs. Robin & Hack, timber
merchants, of Port Adelaide.
Steady application, and a deter-
mination to get on in the world,
ensured him a few years later the
position of head accountant in the
office, and in 1886 he became
part proprietor with his whilom
fellow - employe, Mr. Theophilus
}. Walter, who had joined the firm
some three years before Mr. Morris.
The Sarnia Timber Yard, which
they had become possessed of, is
an establishment of 33 years’
standing in the Port, having been
launched in 1865 by Captain
LeMessurier and Mr. Theophilus Robin. In those days Port Adelaide was little more
than a swamp lined with mangroves, and most people who bought town sites had to
import the “land” there afterwards. Consequently a large sum of money had to be spent
in filling up the swampy site before the timber yard could be established. In after years
Mr. Robin bought out the interest of Captain LeMessurier, and continued the business
until 1873, when he died. Mr. Theodore Hack now became associated with the executors
of Mr. Robin, and the business was carried on under the name of Robin & Hack. I rade
increased, and the firm opened branches in various parts ot the Province ; but, a period
of depression setting in, the firm met with severe financial reverses. Ihe result was that


Mr. Hack bought the business from the trustees. But, partly owing to a disastrous fire,
and a commercial crisis which culminated in the failure of the Commercial Bank of South
Australia, Mr. Hack relinquished his connection with it; and in 1886 Messrs. Walter
and Morris, who had entered it not so many years before as mere boys, became the
proprietors of this big concern. It must have required much nerve and native courage for
two young men to take over a business which, in older hands, had been so unsuccessful.
It was up-hill work at first ; but, blending enterprise with a sound policy, the new
proprietors were not long in reaping a reward for their industry, and to-day they stand
as examples of successful business men who control many workers both in Port Adelaide
and in Adelaide, in which latter city they own a large branch establishment.
Mr. Morris has devoted several valuable years to the weal of the dwellers of
Port Adelaide. About 10 years ago he was returned tor Cleave Ward to the Council of
the local municipality ; and he had served in the Council only two years when he was
appointed Chairman of fi'inance —a position he held tor two successive years. At the end
of this period he was asked to contest the mayoralty, but his opponent, Mr. Sigrist,
defeated him by 19 votes. Nothing daunted, Mr. Morris went before the ratepayers again
in 1894, and was returned by a large majority. In the Chief Magistrate’s chair he
realised the anticipations of his sanguine admirers. The ratepayers paid him a very
flattering compliment when they returned him unopposed as Mayor for the three succeeding
years. There are not many young men of his age in Australia who can boast of such
a record.
Necessarily, Mr. Morris has held many offices more or less associated with the
civic governorship. He was vice-president of the Municipal Association, a member of the
Adelaide Hospital Board, and of the fibre Brigades Board, representing the Suburban
Corporations. He is a member of the Port Adelaide School Board of Advice, and in
1897 carried out, as Mayor, the working of the Diamond Jubilee scheme of Mr. David
Bower, who gave a large sum of money and a grant of land for the establishment of
homes for necessitous seamen. During his reign as Mayor, Mr. Morris instituted, or
helped to institute, many municipal reforms and improvements, foremost amongst which
may be mentioned the installation of the electric light system throughout Port Adelaide;
and this was the first town to establish the system in South Australia. In connection with
the Portland embankment, Mr. Morris took an active part in having it kept a solid buttress
to prevent the inrush of flood and tidal waters which formerly used to overflow at this point.
Mr. Morris lends ready aid to healthy athletic exercise, and is patron and president
of quite a number of football, cricket, and other clubs, and in connection with cricket,
he, as delegate to the South Australian Cricketing Association representing Port Adelaide,
was instrumental in getting the senior club formed at the Port ; also in securing 100
acres of land adjacent to the Port for recreation purposes.
In the Congregational Church at Port Adelaide Mr. Morris has always taken a
great interest, and for some years has been a deacon. His upright bearing and conscientious
dealings, together with his success in life, are tributes to his character that only require
to be mentioned.

Mr. William Tennant Mortlock
THE name of Mortlock has been long and honorably associated with the pastoral history
of South Australia. The men who early set out to reclaim the inhospitable wilds
of the Province deserve to have their names kept green in the minds of the people.
Prominent in the ranks of pioneering pastoralists in South Australia was the late Mr. William
Ranson Mortlock, who, just after the
Province entered upon its swaddling-
clothes era, helped to open up the great
out-back country, then only trodden by
J’ J J
the dusky inhabitants of the interior.
The late Mr. Mortlock was a
native of Cambridgeshire, England,
and came out to South Australia early
in 1845, in which year he took up a
large tract of country in the Port
O j
Lincoln district. It was no light task
to open up new country in those days,
but there were strong, willing hands
and stout hearts engaged in the work.
Thrilling adventures and personal
dangers enough were experienced by
the daring pioneers. Mr. Mortlock
increased his properties in after-years,
and they thrived under his guidance.
He bought the Mount Arden Station
in 1863, and this proved a valuable
adjunct to his pastoral possessions. He
took a lively interest in the political
affairs of his adopted country, and sat
in the House of Assembly as repre-
sentative for Flinders for over 15 years.
He died May 10, 1884, but the good
work he began has been ably carried on by his son, Mr. W. T. Mortlock, who, during the
Fifteenth Parliament of South Australia, represented, as his father did before him, the
blinders electorate in the Lower House.
William 1 ennant Mortlock was born in the Port Lincoln District in 1858.
Primary education was imparted to him at St. Peter’s College, Adelaide ; and later on
he proceeded to Jesus College. Cambridge, where he finished his scholastic training.
Afterwards he read for the Law at the Inner Temple. Altogether he spent eight years
in England, returning to his native shores in 1883. He then at once set to work to


acquire pastoral experience, and worked with this view on his father’s station, Yudnapinnie,
in the Port Augusta District. Reared on a station, and inured to the conditions of pastoral
life from his early days, Mr. Mortlock became a valuable assistant to his father, after
whose death he increased the pastoral properties possessed by the Mortlock family. An
idea of the size of the territory which he now controls can be obtained when it is stated
that \ udnapinnie, Mount Arden, and Eurobluff Stations together represent 1,600 square
miles ; Coffin Bay, 200 square miles ; Angoritchna, 100 square miles ; Yalluna and
Strawberry Hill, 13,000 acres ; Martindale Hall, 10,000 acres ; and Ratavale (purchased
in 1897), 26,000 acres. Such an array of figures as the foregoing implies the outlay of a
large amount of capital on the part of Mr. Mortlock, and the work of superintending
operations over such an immense area necessarily makes his life a particularly busy one.
He, however, managed to find time for public duties as a parliamentarian when he was
elected for Flinders, on April 25, 1896. In the House Mr. Mortlock acquitted himself
very creditably, his intimate knowledge of the country being of great value in legislative
matters connected with pastoral affairs. Mr. Mortlock is a true sportsman, and there is
hardly a racing club of any importance in the Province with which he is not in some
way associated. Of the Port Augusta Racing Club he is a leading member, and figures
on the list of office-bearers as patron. Mr. Mortlock has in every way worthily upheld
his father’s reputation, both on the stations and in the halls of legislation ; and, as an
important figure in the great pastoral industry, he ranks among the representative men
of the Province.
Mr. Edward William Hawker, M.A.
MR. EDWARD WILLIAM HAWKER comes of a good old English family. His
grandfather was an Admiral in the English navy, and his father, the late Hon.
G. C. Hawker, M.A., M.P., was one of the worthiest pioneer settlers of South
Australia. Mr. E. W. Hawker was the eldest son, and he was born on January 14,
1850, on his father’s estate at Dungaree. He attended St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, for
some years, and then proceeded to Harrow, and afterwards to Cambridge University.
After a successful college course he took the degrees of D.A. and LL.B. After being
admitted to the Inner Temple in 1873, he returned to South Australia, and in 1878 he
began to practise as a barrister in Adelaide. In 1884 he was returned for his native district
of Stanley to the House of Assembly. On May 28, 1889, Mr. E. W. Hawker resigned his
seat in order to proceed to England. He applied himself heartily once more to academic
studies, and in 1890, at Cambridge, he took the degrees of Master of Laws and Master
of Arts. He principally, however, devoted himself to mineralogical and metallurgical
study in the laboratories of Germany. In 1892 he leturned to South Australia, and since
that time has energetically interested himself in mining matters in this I tovince. He
holds the position of Lecturer on Mining at the School of Mines in Adelaide. At the
general election of 1893 Mr. Hawker again offered himself to the suffrages of the Stanley
electors, and was returned to the Assembly, of which he continued a member for three years.

Mr. Alexander Borthwick Murray
r pHE name of Murray is among the best known and respected in South Australia.
X Almost since the establishment of the Province, members of the family have been
prominently associated with its pastoral pursuits, and their stud sheep have formed
the nucleus of many (locks in neighboring colonies, such as in Western Australia, New
Zealand (North, South, and West),
Queensland, New South Wales, and
also in the Cape of Good Hope. Ihe
industry and knowledge of Mr. A. B.
Murray, in particular, has proved of
paramount advantage to colonial sheep-
breeders.
Mr. Alexander Borthwick Murray
is a native of Lang’shall Burn, in the
parish of Eskdale Moor, Dumfriesshire,
Scotland, where he was born on Feb-
ruary 14, 1816. In his early youth he
became associated with sheep-breeding
and rearing, and, when 17 years old,
went to the Highlands of Scotland,
where he was engaged in acclimatising
the Cheviot sheep in the mountainous
regions of Inverness and Rosshire. He
thus obtained considerable knowledge
of woolgrowing, and was better fitted
by experience than most early colonists
to take up pastoral pursuits in Aus-
tralia. In May, 1839, he left his native
land in the ship Lady Lil/ford , and
arrived at Holdfast Bay on September
27, 1839. At this time the Province
had entered upon its first large boom,
caused principally by the public works expenditure initiated by Colonel Gawler. That
Governor infused great vitality into local affairs, and fitted out expeditions to explore the
country north, south, and east. He also established a system of special surveys, under
which purchasers of land could select a large area, of which each person might eventually
acquire the freehold of 4,000 acres. Land speculation consequently became general, and
very considerable areas were taken up in 1839-40, the ruling desire of the people being
to acquire land. Mr. Murray, when in Scotland, had promised a distant relative, Sir James
Malcolm, to manage for 12 months a property the latter had acquired at Barossa ; and he
immediately set about fulfilling this engagement. He culled the sheep, cleared them of


scab, which was endangering the condition of the Hock, and got them into such fine order
that they took a prize at the first pastoral show in South Australia. This exhibition
was held at the Horseshoe, Noarlunga, under the auspices of the celebrated South Australian
Company ; and Mr. Murray, who personally brought the sheep from Barossa, won honors
against all the animals shown on that occasion.
In 1842 Mr. Murray proceeded to Sydney in the brig Lady Emma , and was
there married, by the Rev. J. Dunsmore Lang, to Miss Scott. Upon his return to South
Australia he decided to engage in agricultural pursuits, which, to correct the re-action
caused by the bursting of the boom in 1841, was vigorously advocated by Governor Grey
(afterwards Sir George Grey), who succeeded Colonel Gawler. Mr. Murray possessed
property on the Barossa special survey, where he was an original selector and part
owner, and thither he went to cultivate the soil. Fortunately for him, perhaps, his first
efforts were not very remunerative, for, although the yield was good, the ruling prices
tor wheat were absurdly low. There was very little money in the Province, and the
wheat returns had increased so rapidly that there was a consequent fall in price.
Mr. Murray’s crop was infested with “smut,” which so injured the sample that he could
only obtain is. 6d. per bushel for most of the grain, and 2s. for the best. The buyer was
Dr. Kent, the popular founder of Kent Town, where, near the present Kent Town
Brewery, he had erected a mill. What with the trouble of breaking the soil, and then
carting the produce to Adelaide in bullock-drays, Mr. Murray was not enamored with
wheat-farming. In partnership with his sister-in-law (afterwards the wife of Mr. P. M.
M urray), he now purchased some ewes from the late Mr. Duncan McFarlane, of Mount
Barker, and also secured a ram, which he selected from Mr. D. McFarlane’s own flock.
This ram was the sire of the late Mr. John Murray’s ram “ Champion,” known in the
family as “ Prizey,” and ultimately ending his days as the property of Mr. A. B. Murray.
These sheep—the nucleus of the Murray flocks—were brought overland from Victoria
by Mr. Lachlan McFarlane, and were the joint property of Messrs. James and Duncan
McF'arlane, of New South Wales, two of the earliest and largest pastoralists in the colony.
Mr. John Murray, who landed on September 5, 1841, from the City of Adelaide, purchased
part of his brother’s land at Barossa; and he and his brother each took a fourth, and
M iss Scott a half, of the progeny, and started on a long and famous career as sheep-breeders
on a large and successful scale. The Barossa special survey mentioned above was
selected after three days’ examination of the country by the late Mr. Robert Cock
(of Adelaide), the late Mr. John Warren (of Springfield), and Mr. Murray. It
was taken out in lieu of what was styled the Finniss special survey, which
was taken from them in favor of another applicant. From year to year the partners
improved the breed of their flocks, and took prizes at numerous shows. These sheep
were sturdy - framed, and bore good wool. To this day Mr. A. B. Murray retains
descendants of the original (lock, and has won with them numerous medals and certificates
At the Duke of Edinburgh’s Show he secured four gold medals and several money
prizes; and as late as the September Show of 1895 his entry took fourth prize in the
combing merino ewe class, his nephews being the other prize - winners. There were
fourteen entries, and the fourth prize was taken by Mr. Murray, beating sheep shown
by his three nephews and Messrs. J. H. and C. H. Angas.

Mr. A. B. Murray ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


For the last 20 years Mr. Murray has owned a cattle station near Warrina,
J J
where he has been a heavy sufferer by the recent droughts. He paid the late Mr. Richard
Holland, of Turretfield, A 25,000 for Bookpurnong, a large station on the Murray. After
he had improved the property, and obtained some profits from it, the rabbit pest compelled
him to give the property up. Says Mr. Murray, in a recent issue of the Adelaide Observer ,
“ I came out with nothing, and I was glad to get away.” At one time, also, he possessed
a station property at Myrtle Springs —now held by Mr. Leonard Browne, in connection
with Leigh’s Creek —but this likewise had to be relinquished. Those who go to the remote
country of this Province suffer many such buffets from fortune. Mr. Murray expresses
the opinion that the Northern country is most dangerous to touch. He says of it
A man must spend a fortune before he can get water and form a station fit
to go on to ; and my opinion is that he had better do something else with his money.”
He was one of the first Directors of Elder’s Wool and Produce Company (which afterwards
became Elder, Smith, & Co., Limited), and he retired from the directorate in March, 1898,
after 15 years’ service.
But Mr. Murray has not confined himself to engaging in the primary industries
of the Province. He has taken a quiet, unostentatious but useful interest in public affairs.
He is, perhaps, the oldest member of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society, and
was President as far back as 1866. In 1844 he was a member of the District Road
Commissions, the forerunners of District Councils. When the District Council of Pungkillo
was first formed, Mr. Murray having taken active steps to obtain its formation, he became
a member, and was its chairman until he left the district.
P'ive years after the inauguration of responsible government he was elected on
May 8, 1862, a member of the House of Assembly for the District of Gumeracha. This
was a by-election, caused by the retirement of Mr. Alexander Hay. At the general elections
of 1863 and 1865 he was returned for the same district. Resigning on June 27, 1867,
he entered the quieter arena to be found in the Legislative Council, being elected on March
19, 1869, and retaining his seat till P'ebruary 2, 1877, but was again returned on July
7, 1880, under the original electoral roll, when the whole Province voted as one constituency.
Mr. Murray finally retired from parliamentary life on April 14, 1888. As a member
of Parliament he did not speak often ; but when he did address the Chamber, it was
always with effect. In all matters concerning the development of the country and the
land laws he was able to render useful service. It cannot, however, be said that he w r as
fond of the glamour of public life ; though on one occasion he defeated the Government
when it brought in a Bill to put the South-Eastern District in quarantine because of the
fluke disease in sheen.
x
Por many years Mr. Murray has lived in retirement. At the special request of
Sir R. D. Hanson, late Chief Justice, many years ago he accepted the commission of a
Justice of the Peace. He has been twice married, his second wife being a sister of the
late Mr. George Tinline, one time manager of the Bank of South Australia.
I he facts already dealt with are sufficient to prove the extent of the obligations
which South Australia is under to Mr. Murray. He has greatly helped in building up
the pastoral industry, and from his energy thousands of people have gained benefit.

Mr. David Murray
IN each Australian Colony there are great commercial houses which are intimately
associated with its prosperity. Such houses carry on a wholesale trade, and they
have business connection in nearly every town and township in the Colony. They
are, indeed, immense depots whence the country parts receive their supplies, their customers
being the storekeepers throughout
the land. 01 such institutions in
South Australia, that of D. & W.
Murray, Limited, is one of the
chief. Since 1853 this house
has been in existence, and during
the intervening period it has
been gradually extending its
spheres of operations from north
to south, and east to west, and
even into the adjacent colonies
1 he biographies of great captains
of commerce in the colonies, there-
fore, have an especial interest,
inasmuch as the men themselves
largely contribute in enterprise,
wealth, and political sagacity, to
the growth of the country. They
have grown up, so to speak, with
the country, as well in wealth as
in importance.
David Murray was born at
Anstruther, F'ifeshire, Scotland, in
December, 1829, and came with
his brother William to South
Australia in 1853. Almost im-
mediately after their arrival, the
Murrays opened a small drapery business in King William Street, Adelaide. At that
time the population of South Australia was exceedingly small, lor the Province had not
recovered Irom the phenomenal exodus to the Victorian goldfields. Business was depresssed,
although there was a goodly amount of money in circulation, due to the South Australian
gold-diggers forwarding their winnings to their families, or returning to purchase property
and to enjoy a holiday in their own Province. The business of I). & W. Murray
obtained popularity, and it soon became necessary for them to remove to larger premises.
They chose a site at the corner of Grenfell Street. From thenceforth, as years went
by, and the Province increased in population and wealth, the business of the firm expanded


to very large dimensions, and improvements and enlargements were constantly made
necessary. Settlement was being extended over wide areas, and great buildings were being
erected in Adelaide, and in the townships. Ihe members of the house of D. &W . Murray
were large participants in the general expansion, and, confining themselves to the wholesale
trade, rose to importance with the growth of the community. In succession, they had to
obtain larger and yet larger premises, going from Grenfell Street to buildings in King
William Street, whence they again removed to still larger buildings in the same thoroughfare.
Eventually, in 1886, when the Province had attained a position of high importance, they
moved into premises specially built for them in Gawler Place, where their headquarters
still are. As has been already stated, the firm has flourishing branches throughout South
Australia, and in other colonies, and its travellers visit almost every township of any size
in South Australia. It imports from the world’s markets, and distributes broadcast. Ihe
annual turnover is consequently immense.
When the material conditions of the Province became more stable, and the
early struggles of the house were at an end, Mr. David Murray began to devote
attention to public matters. The country needed men of superior intelligence and some
experience to help it through the troubles of adolescence, and Mr. Murray’s shrewdness
and mental readiness of grasp proved of considerable value in the political arena. In
1870 he was elected to the House of Assembly for East Adelaide; but after two years’
service, he retired into private life for five years. In 1877 he was chosen representative
for East Torrens. With Mr. W. Gilbert, he was returned for Yatala in 1881, defeating
Mr. Cavenagh, who, however, successfully petitioned against his opponent’s return, and Mr.
Murray was unseated. At the new election which followed in July Mr. Murray again
defeated Mr. Cavenagh, but he held the seat for only a few weeks, when he resigned.
In 1882 he again decided, on earnest persuasion, to enter Parliament, and on this occasion
he was elected a member of the Legislative Council. Nine years later he retired finally
from public life.
P'rom the success which Mr. Murray attained in his business, it may be well
conceived that he was a useful, practical legislator. The high intelligence, carefulness,
discrimination, and foresight applied to his private affairs, proved also of service when
devoted to affairs of State. Mr. Murray was, however, not disposed to indiscriminate
speech-making, and he was none the less respected on that account. His speeches were
composed of sound commonsense and rational representation, and out of his experience
he was able to tender useful advice. He was thus able to largely influence legislation,
especially on all commercial and financial matters. On July 9, 1886, upon the retirement
of the Hon. J. B. Spence, Chief Secretary in the Downer Administration, he was offered
the portfolio, which he accepted. For the 12 months that this Government remained in
office, he performed the duties of the position with credit.
In his private capacity, Mr. Murray has proved a staunch friend of South
Australia. He is a very prominent man in the Presbyterian Church, and, in connection
with that communion—as well as in other ways —he has conferred benefits on his fellows.
In character he is unostentatious ; but his bright eyes and intelligent countenance bespeak a
man of quick and governing intellect. He is indeed a captain in South Australian industry.

Mr. Simpson Newland
SOME four or five years ago an Australian book by a new writer was published in
England, and attracted considerable attention and received flattering notices from
critics, both British and Australian. Mr. Newland, the author, with one effort,
achieved no slight fame with the pen. His was not an ephemeral production, a juggling
feat of imagination ; nor was it an
impossible narrative, as many such
Australian books have proved.
“ Paving the Way,” as the title
suggests, told the story of the wiry-
framed, staunch-minded veterans.
When accompanying Mr. Newland
through his various adventures, the
reader feels that he, too, is an Aus-
tralian pioneer ; that in him is the
restlessness of the explorer, the
strength of the forest-tamer, the
cunning of the bushman ; in him
the dim, mysterious spirit of the
lonely man hidden in that silence
and solemnity begot of remote
isolation. While there comes to him
a longing for the excitations and
luxuries of the cities, there is yet
something calmly satisfying in this
O J J
pioneer life. The bush, which
Marcus Clarke thought so melan-
choly, becomes sufficing in its being.
J’ O o
No doubt, in places the spirit of it
is gloomy and desolate; but there
is also song and brightness and
Nature’s industry. Mr. Newland,
in his stories of pioneer adventures,
voices the bright side of the Australian bush. It might almost be said that, by understanding
Mr. Newland’s character and the ramifications of his career, we can better appreciate his
books, which, indeed, are undoubtedly of a piece with his life and that of those among
whom he has lived. The descriptions of scenery are typical; the adventures have substantially
happened.
Mr. Simpson Newland was born 62 years ago, in Staffordshire, England, and
when quite a lad came to South Australia with his father. The latter became a pastoralist
at Port Victor, and in that district young Newland lived until he was about 20 years old.


In the earliest clays whaling stations were perched on the bluff headlands of this part of
South Australia; and inland were only a few isolated squatters, who must needs live
bold and precarious lives among frequently hostile natives. These latter at times were
treacherous; and at times, when treated firmly and kindly, as a discreet father would
J J 1
manage his child, they were faithful and honest. Mr. Newland imbibed the essential spirit
of his life under such conditions. There awoke in him the love of excitement which
whaling operations inculcate, also the bushcraft and quickness of perception which the
lonely bush and the presence of wandering tribes of natives called forth. He heard many
stories from the whalers, and he listened as eagerly to the tales with which old squatters
and bushmen are wont to regale themselves when smoking their pipes in their homes
or when on the track. Mr. Newland was impressionable and observant, and he did not
forget what he saw and heard. When 20 years of age he began to participate in what,
from a literary point of view, is the most attractive form of Australian life, namely, droving.
Impossible adventures have been attributed to drovers and stock-riders. Almost every
drover can tell some strange, romantic story, which may or may not be true, but which
has the semblance and mark of possibility. Even yet, though much has changed, there
is still excitement in this rambling occupation. But 50 or 60 years ago the bushman
had to mark out a new track over hundreds of miles of untamed territory, and he also
had to match the cunning or defy the strength of the prowling natives. He took herds
of cattle of great value sometimes a thousand miles and more, through unsettled country,
over desolate plains, into brooding forests, across rushing rivers—the while fighting the
aborigines on frequent occasions. His horse, his steady nerve, and his ingenuity were
constantly in requisition. He was lonely, and sometimes melancholy, and he centred his
most permanent affections on his horse, his dog, or even on his bovine companions. The
men who accompanied him were often desperate fellows, not long from a convict prison
- men who would not mind taking his life if anything could be mimed by the act. He
had, therefore, to be alert, and quick, and cunning, and masterful ; and he was driven
into thoughtfulness and manliness.
\\ hen Mr. Newland left his father’s station, he went overland to New South
Wales, a journey in those days fraught with difficulties and dangers. He was engaged to
drive cattle from the Goulburn pastures to South Australia, and he made several trips
of this kind. His herd usually comprised 600 cattle, and the distance to be traversed
was about 1,000 miles. It took many months to complete each of these trips, and the
risks on the way were not few. It was the variety of his experiences while so enmio-ed
' 1 OO
which enabled Mr. Newland to write so effectively of droving. As with all drovers who
wished to become something better, he watched an opportunity to branch out as a
pastoralist on his own account. In conjunction with Messrs. H. Field and A. Hav, he
took up a large area of country on the Darling River, in the west of New South
Wales, and kept sheep and cattle on it. Squatting in the Darling country is full of
possibilities. Ihe yield of pasture is often very rich, but rain is irregular. At times
the immense watershed of the river is covered with magnificent vegetation ; such, indeed,
as few other countries can produce. But at times a long and severe drought desolates
this expansive territory, and hardly a blade of grass can be seen for miles, while, in the
place of luxuriant herbage, are only white bones. The squatters in those times lived for


the most part remote from the world, and had to look within for any pleasure and relaxation.
Occasionally lehef was found in the marauds of the bushrangers, to catch whom many a
famous ride has been made, and to outwit whom provided reflective occupation for many
weeks.
hoi 20 years Mr. Newland managed his Darling run. He experienced fat and
lean years ; quick accumulations of wealth, and quicker disposals of it. He had to face
struggles and bitter disappointments, but, on the whole, the station proved profitable, and
eventual!), with some relief, he found himself able to appoint a manager and return to
South Australia to reside. 1 his closed another stage in his career; though he is still
part owner of the Darling run.
Parliamentary government now attracted Mr. Newland’s attention, and in 1881
he was elected to represent Encounter Bay in the House of Assembly of South Australia.
He thus became member for the district wherein he had spent his youth. For two successive
Parliaments he faithfully served his constituents. In Sir John Downer’s first Ministry he
held the portfolio of Treasurer, a position which he filled with credit for twelve months. He
was a gifted politician, but not one who would truckle to popular clamor or trim to win
a vote. His great forte was his political pamphlets, which—clear, incisive, and clever
carried weight with his party and the public. A good speaker, he was a better writer,
and his pamphlets were powerful and successful. In 1889 Mr. Newland visited England.
During all his many and romantic experiences he had been storing up a mass of information,
and slowly, in later years, he conceived the purpose of writing a novel. He had ample
data at hand, and he applied himself to reducing it to wholesome and attractive dimensions.
In the comparative inactivity of recent years he has devoted himself more and more to
his object, and thus, when nearly 60 years of age, he published one of the best of Australian
long stories. In 1893 he went to England a second time, and made the necessary
arrangements. The new book was particularly well received in the old country, and the
Australian edition was rapidly bought up. “ Paving the Way,” the title of the book in
question, combines an exciting narrative with lifelike descriptions of scenery, characters,
and adventures. It is the fruit of careful effort and personal experience, and is stamped
with truth. The story includes descriptions of shipwreck, struggles with natives, whaling,
squatting, droving, bushranging, and even love matters ! Mr. Newland has also written
a number of short stories, and all of them are pregnant with the same peculiar strain of
interest which distinguishes his first big effort. It is not often that a new author of nearly
60 years of age gains the support of a considerable proportion of the reading world. As
a record in part of his own life, Mr. Newland no doubt found as much pleasure in writing
“ Paving the Way ” as do his readers in perusing it; and it must be said that the work
has gained him a prominent place among Australian authors.
Since the above was written Mr. Newland’s new book, “ Blood Tracks of the
Bush,” has appeared. The reviews have been many and complimentary. We regret that
space will not allow us to devote more attention to the work now, but we have seen
enough to assure us that it will sustain the reputation the author has already gained. It
has been widely pronounced not inferior to his first book, “ Paving the Way.”

Mr. David Nock
IN South Australia many able men have espoused the cause of temperance, enforcing
their views as well by example as in Parliament and on the public platform. One
of the most earnest and constant advocates of temperance in the Province has been
Mr. David Nock. He is a native of Tipton, Staffordshire, England, and was born
in 1828. When he left school,
he worked with his father in the
building trade, and when 14 years
old accompanied his parents to New
Zealand. The familv arrived in the
South Island early in 1843, but
in consequence of Maori disturb-
ances and the attendant business
stagnation, they resided in the
island colony for only 18 months.
J J
They then left for Sydney, New
J JJ
South Wales, and three months
later moved on to South Australia,
settling in Adelaide in August,
1844. Several years were spent
in Adelaide bv Mr. David Nock
*
in following his trade, and in
acquiring colonial experience.
During, or about, 1858, he took up
his residence in Nuriootpa, and
opened a general store. After the
lapse of about two years, he pro-
ceeded to Kapunda, where he was
engaged in business for about 23
years. Eventually he retired from
j J
trade pursuits, and removed to
Glenelg. There he remained until
1894, when he went to reside in
Norwood. In the early part of 1897 Mr. Nock had to mourn the loss of his wife, who
had been his companion for nearly half a century.
In 1875 Mr. Nock was elected to the House of Assembly for the District of
Light, the late Judge Stow and the late Mr. James White being his colleagues. But
although he was successful as a member of Parliament, he was not in love with such a
career, and when asked to stand again, he declined. During his first session in Parliament,
he successfully urged the Government to introduce a Bill for the suppression of the Rabbit
nuisance, at that time causing serious loss to some of his constituents. He also strongly


supported Mr, Iviichauffs Bill for the preservation of forests. In the second session he
introduced a Bill for the amendment of the Licensed \ ictuallers Act, which provided that
where a new licence was applied for it should not be granted il petitioned against by at least
20 persons, being a two-thirds majority, residing within a quarter of a mile in the city,
town, or village of the house for which the licence was sought. The Bill also provided
tor the closing of public houses all day on Sundays, thus attempting to amend the existing
law, which allowed them to open on those days from 12 till 2, and from 8 till 10 o’clock.
Ihe fust reading was moved by Mr. Nock on July 12, 1876, and the third reading was
carried, after much opposition, on October 1 1 following, 20 voting for and 1 1 against it.
O o
Ihe measure passed through the Legislative Council with the alteration of the distance
within which the ratepayers should reside in city, town, or village, from a quarter of a mile
to 200 yards. The Sunday-closing clause was thrown out altogether. Early in the
following session Mr. Nock again introduced his Bill, mainly to ensure Sunday closing, and
to extend the area from 200 to 500 yards. After a hard struggle, he succeeded in getting
the measure passed, but his opponents succeeded in amending it to the extent of permitting
public houses to be open from 12 to 2 o’clock on Sundays. He then got a clause
inserted allowing any publican to close all day if he chose to do so, and carried the point
in regard to the distance. The first reading was moved on July 12, 1877, and the third
reading was carried on October 4. The Legislative Council adopted the Bill, with a few
minor amendments, in the same session, and it became the law of the land, and thenceforth
was known as “ Nocks Act. ’ For a new member, Mr. Nock was very active in Parliament.
Among other questions in which he evinced a vital interest was that of Bible-
reading in State schools. He pleaded for the retention of this course when the Act was
passed making the education of children compulsory. On another occasion he seriously
condemned as inconsistent the encouragement of lotteries at church bazaars. His “platform”
included the opening-up, where warranted, of the country by railway extension, and the
sale of Crown lands at cheap rates so as to induce bond Jidc farmers in larger numbers
to settle upon land fit for agriculture. He was also an advocate of water conservation,
believing, as he says, that “money wisely spent in such work would be a great blessing
to the country.” Since his boyhood Mr. Nock has taken great interest in religious and
philanthropic matters. He feels that life has its duties, as well as its pleasures, and he
acts up to the principle. He has been extensively associated with endeavors of the
kind, and modestly says that he “esteems it a privilege to be permitted to help others
in such useful work.” He has filled most of the offices open to laymen in the Wesleyan
Church, and is a local preacher, class-leader, and Sunday-school teacher. He has been a
total abstainer for upwards of 50 years. Since his retirement from business, he has been
an earnest charitable worker in the city. He is a member of committees of the Female
Refuge, Blind and Deaf and Dumb Institution, Industrial School for the Blind, Deaf and
Dumb Mission, Belair Retreat, City Mission, Home for Weak-minded Children, and
Young Men’s Christian Association. Mr. Nock has been a Justice of the Peace for over
30 years, and was at one time associated with municipal matters at Kapunda, where he
occupied the mayoral chair for two years. His work in temperance, religious, charitable,
and philanthropic causes ensures him a high position in public estimation.

The late Mr. David Ogilvy Palmer
THE commercial man of established reputation who has won his spurs in a fair fight
is often pressed to accept numbers of offices which have no direct relationship
with his business. His ripe judgment, his discriminative powers, his soundness and
acumen, are desired by various corporations and institutions; and, if he can spare the
time, his services are sure to be
highly useful to them. 1 hese
remarks applied in a large measure
to the late Mr. David Ogilvy
Palmer, who was born at Liver-
pool, England, in 1839, and re-
ceived an excellent commercial
education in one of the best
Liverpool houses. Over 40 years
ago (about 1858) he left England
for Australia, and landed in Mel-
bourne, and became associated
with the firm of Lorimer, Mar-
wood. & Rome upon its foundation
in iB6O. The name of this im-
portant house was afterwards
changed to Lorimer, Rome, & Co.
For 25 years in Victoria, Mr.
Palmer was associated with the
firm, and he thus gained a know-
ledge of Australian commercial
o
affairs which no other colony could
so well offer. He filled various
useful offices, and. 14 years ago,
came to South Australia to manage
a branch of the firm in Adelaide,
which he conducted with much
credit for some seven years, when
he purchased the local business. He was justly looked upon as one of the leading
commercial men of South Australia, and his opinion on commercial points always had weight.
Mr. Palmer invested considerable capital in the mining industry, and was on the Boards of
several well-known companies. With other astute commercial men, he brought much business
talent to bear on the supervision of the large interests at stake in these ventures. Combined
with his high abilities as a business man, Mr. Palmer was possessed of attractive social
qualities, which ensured him a wide circle of friends, while his soundness and inflexibility
won for him general respect. Mr. Palmer died on December 8, 1898, generally lamented.

1 he late Mr. William Parkin
ALI HOUGH several worthy pioneers continue with us, most of them are dead,
leaving behind but the memory of their respected names and the fruits of their
good works. One notable feature of such characters has been an admirable
charity, forming monuments which must be viewed with affectionate esteem. Not satisfied
with the good done during the
course of their lives, some of them
have left substantial bequests,
which earn the gratitude of those
who enjoy them and those who
love charity in any form.
J J
A man of such kind was the
late Mr. William Parkin, whose
life-work will remain green in the
memory of the people he benefited
so munificently. William Parkin
was born at Glastonbury, near
Barnstaple, England, on August
24, 1801, and reached South
Australia on September 18, 1839,
in the ship Recovery. He was,
therefore, one of the veteran
colonists of the Province. It was
his intention to enter into pastoral
pursuits, but, seeing a good busi-
ness for sale, he became a pioneer
business man instead. Soon after
his arrival he opened a drapery
store in Hindley Street, Adelaide,
on the site where Messrs. J. Miller
And erson & Co. are now estab-
lished. There Mr. Parkin
experienced all those seveie buffets which were the common lot of early residents-
but, being a man of substance, these reverses did not cause him to “go under,” as
was the case with most of the South Australian merchants of that period. From
Hindley Street he moved to Rundle Street, where he continued business on the site
now occupied by Messrs. James Marshall & Co. For many years the premises he built
there were prominent landmarks of the city. Mr. Parkin’s business increased greatly,
and, alter many years, he took a partner in with him. Finally he was able to
retire upon a comfortable fortune. Flc was one of the largest shareholders in, and
for years was Chairman of Directors of, the Wallaroo and Kadina Tramway
Company, whose affairs he managed with conspicuous success. He was also a


member of the syndicate which took over the Advertiser newspaper in 1864 ; and was
otherwise a very considerable factor in the local commercial world.
In his time Mr. Parkin was a well-known Member of Parliament. He was
elected to the House of Assembly in iB6O, and sat until 1862. On November 26, 1866,
he entered the Legislative Council, and retired on February 2, 1877, thus having
been in Parliament for 13 years. He carried out his political duties conscientiously,
and is best remembered in this connection for his “quaint, humorous, but intelligent
addresses.” His name was associated with some useful measures. During his latter years
Mr. Parkin lived in close retirement. He was widely and affectionately known for his
philanthropy, and was a prominent and liberal member of the Congregational Church
Freeman Street, under the pastorateship of the late revered Rev. I . O. Stow ; while for
20 years he was a member of the Glenelg Congregational Church, presided over by
the late Rev. C. Manthorpe. He founded the “Parkin I rust in 1876, by a gilt of
money and land estimated at to provide for the support and training of
Congregational ministers, for the erection of schools and churches, and benefactions tor
o o
the widows of ministers. On August 24, 1881, when he attained his 80th year, the
governors of this trust presented him with an address of congratulation. Mr. Parkin also
founded, in 1887, the “Parkin Congregational Mission of South Australia, the objects
of which are to maintain missionaries in unsettled portions of South Australia (and
particularly in the Northern areas), and to aid each year 20 widows over 60 years of age
who may be chosen by the governors as worthy of assistance, by giving them each
at Christmas. These are a small portion of Mr. Parkin’s philanthropic contributions, and
it is estimated that his benefactions altogether amounted to the sum of about ,£40,000. On
May 31, 1889, he died, being then in his 88th year. Many mourned his demise, and
numerous eulogiums were passed upon his life and character. He deserves an honorable
niche in South Australian history, for, whether in business, or in Parliament, or in
J 7
religious and philanthropic matters, he rendered good and faithful service. Two memorial
windows have been placed in the Glenelg Congregational Church -one by his widow and
I O o O
one by the Governors of the Trust and mission abovementioned.

Mr. William Johnstone, S.M.
MR. WILLIAM JOHNSTONE, S.M., is a native of this Province, having been
born at North Adelaide on March 8, 1843. After instruction in private schools,
he entered the Albert House Academy, Angas Street, Adelaide. He next went
to St. Peter’s College, and afterwards finished his education at Mr. J. L. Young’s school.
P'or a period Mr. Johnstone was in the employ of the Advertiser proprietary, and subsequently
gained a position in the office of the Official Assignee in January, 1866; and in December,
1870, the Chief Clerkship of that department was conferred on him. On April 5, 1882.
he was promoted to the Clerkship of the Local Court of Adelaide. His intimate acquaintance
with the practice of Local Courts enabled him to materially assist in their important w r ork
the Special Commission appointed to frame “The Local Courts Rules and Forms, 1887.”
In September, 1892, Mr. Johnstone was appointed a Special Magistrate for the Province,
and Stipendiary Magistrate of the Local and other Courts of Port Adelaide.

Mr, Herbert Angas Parsons, LL.B.
BESIDES the. greybeards among politicians and commercial men mentioned in these
pages, one or two biographies are included of the brightest vouncr Australians
who, judging by present promise, are likely to take a prominent part in promoting
the future prosperity of the Province. From the ability and patriotism of this younger
generation, some judgment may
be formed of the possible destiny
of South Australia. It is gratify-
ing to observe that among the
rising men of the Province there
is no lack of intellect, and that,
therefore, there need be no doubt
of the preservation of the country’s
interests and of the high repute
which the local people enjoy in
other colonies and countries.
Mr. Herbert Angas Parsons
will, in all likelihood, have some-
thing to say in the Parliaments of
the future. The descendant of a
family which has proved its
staunchness to South Australia,
he was born at North Adelaide on
May 23, 1872. His father, the
Hon. John Langdon Parsons,
M.L.C., is an influential Member,
of Parliament, has been a Minister
of the Crown, and a Government
Resident of the Northern Terri-
tory. Others of the family—Mr.
J J
G. F. Angas and Mr. 1. H. Angas
o J O
-have served the Province well.
Mr. H. A. Parsons was educated at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, after which he
attended the Roseworthy Agricultural College for some little time. It would seem that he
J O o
was intended to have a knowledge of the chief industries of the Province before devoting
o o
himself to a profession. With Mr. J. H, Angas, under whom he was engaged for some
time, he had the advantage of a superior training in pastoral and agricultural matters, as
well from the practical as from the theoretical and the commercial sides. In March,
1894, he entered the Adelaide University to study law, being meanwhile articled in the
office of the Right Hon. C. C. Kingston, P.C., Q.C. In December, 1897, the degree of


Bachelor of Laws was conferred upon Mr. Parsons, and in the same month he was
admitted a practitioner of the Supreme Court of South Australia.
In January, 1898, he entered into partnership with the well-known barrister,
Mr. P. McM. Glynn, 8.A., LL.B., M.P. Early in 1897, at a by-election consequent on
the death of Mr. George Ash, M.P. (the late partner of the Right Hon. C. C. Eingston),
Mr. H. A. Parsons was a candidate for a seat in the House of Assembly for the District
of Albert. He did not, however, go to the poll, having retired in favor of Mr. George
Riddoch. From speeches he has delivered, from the interest he takes in public affairs, and
from various indications of intellectual strength and judgment, the friends of Mr. Parsons
are exceedingly hopeful of his future. Upon him may devolve the duty of carrying on
the public work of a useful and influential South Australian family. As a speaker, he has
already made a reputation, and the present Minister of Agriculture recently, in replying to
the toast of “Agriculture,” which had been proposed by the subject of this sketch, is
reported to have said that “he had often listened to the eloquent speeches of the Hon.
J. L. Parsons, and it seemed that the mantle of eloquence had fallen on his gifted son.
Mr. William Kither
MR. WILLIAM EITHER was born at Bow, London, in 1843, and when 12 years
old in 1855 came to South Australia with his father. The latter opened a
butchering business in Adelaide, and the son embraced the same occupation. In
1870 Mr. Either hid a business of his own in Rundle Street, and from that time
to the present he Iras been one of the greatest food providers in the Province. Enormous
numbers of cattle and sheep have passed through the store of Mr Either to the
tables of Adelaide residents —the sum total would provide supremely interesting pabulum.
In 1881 Mr. Either entered the Adelaide City Council as Councillor for Gawler Ward,
and two years later he became an alderman. He has since pursued an even and
unostentatious career, being content merely to serve the ratepayers according to his lights.
He is not ambitious for high office, having repeatedly declined nomination to the Mayoralty
of Adelaide, a distinction lor which his training fitted him, and which his splendid services
merited. He carefully and sincerely performed the duties of Alderman ; he assisted
beneficently in the civic administration ; and as he knew his city thoroughly, he was a
model civic father. But though Mr. Either is not one who desires glorification, he has
o o '
yet obtained a widely respected name for his charity. Large numbers of people have
reason to revere him for his secret gratuities. His donations to public philanthropic
institutions have been large. In the winter of 1884, when South Australia was in an
extremely depressed condition, and poverty and privation were terribly common in Adelaide,
he afforded a great deal of relief to the hungry by providing soup kitchens where the
poor could obtain food at all hours, and his liberality was appreciated by many starving
families. He is a Life Governor of the Children’s Hospital, of the Deaf and Dumb
Asylum, and of the Institute for the Blind. He served for 10 years on the Board of
Management of the Adelaide Hospital.

Dr. Alexander Stewart Paterson
I A H E range of medical study is remarkably wide and varied, demanding almost unique
talent and persistence in its votaries. No profession is so prolific of specialists, for
almost every organ of the human body, almost every phase of human weakness,
contains its own history, whose unravelment demands a lifetime. Among the most interesting
branches of medical science is the
study of mental organism, where
the investigator is brought face to
face with the strange maladies
arising from a disordered condition
of mind. This special treatment
of insanity in elaborate institutions
set apart for the purpose is a
feature of modern civilisation. It
is conceded that mental disorders
are generally more difficult to
O J
diagnose than bodily diseases, and
their treatment is, therefore, more
vague and circumstantial. Besides
medical skill, keen perception, a
sympathetic nature, long expe-
rience, and other qualities are
required in the specialist to whom
is entrusted the care and attention
of the insane; and in Dr. A. S.
Paterson, who, for nearly 30 years,
has held such a post in South
Australia, all these conditions were
amply fulfilled.
Alexander Stewart Paterson,
M.D., was born at Edinburgh,
Scotland, in November, 1833.
After receiving some tuition at private preliminary schools, the future medico entered the
Edinburgh fdigh School, an institution which has numbered amongst its scholars some of
the finest intellects in Britain. Dr. Paterson spent six years in this academy, and in his
eighteenth year was in the proud position of dux ol the school, an honor secured in
previous years by such celebrities as Lord Brougham and Sir Charles Aitchison
(afterwards Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab). Obtaining the “ Heriot " bursary, he
went from the High School to the Edinburgh University. Being then undecided as to
the choice of a profession, he took the first year of the Arts Course, comprising Latin, Greek,
and Mathematics, and carried off the medal awarded by the Professor of Humanity, being


the fourth High School dux to achieve this distinction in so many consecutive years. Ihe
following year he entered on the study of medicine. In his twenty-third year he was
made a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, and in his twenty-fourth
year took the M.D. degree Equipped with these qualifications, the youthful medico
found no difficulty in securing a position as surgeon under the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company, serving in that capacity on various steamers to the
east of Suez for a period of about five years. Probably this apprenticeship in roving
created a taste for adventure in the young surgeon s mind, for in 1863 he was attracted
to Victoria, where, after spending some months on the Ovens Goldfields, he accepted
an appointment as Resident Medical Officer at the Yarra Bend Hospital for the Insane,
which was then under the superintendency of Dr. Paley, a nephew of the celebrated
Archdeacon. During his four years’ occupancy of this position, Dr. Paterson
established an Australian reputation; and in 1867 was offered, and he accepted, a
similar post in connection with the Adelaide institution. After a short time, the appointment
was supplemented by the Colonial Surgeonship, a post which implies the medical charge
of the Adelaide Gaol and superintendence of country hospitals. These positions Dr.
Paterson filled with credit for nearly 30 years, and it was only in consequence of failing-
health that he resigned them in 1895, after spending six months on leave in England, a
holiday due to him in accordance with the precedent established in the South Australian
Government service.
Dr. Paterson’s time has been entirely devoted to his multifarious duties, and to
the study and practice of his special branch of medical science, so that in general public
affairs his voice has not been heard. He has, however, exhibited considerable interest in
matters connected with the University and the Medical Board, having occupied the position
of President of the latter body for a number of years. He was awarded the ad eundem
degree in connection with the medical schools of the Melbourne and Adelaide Universities,
and was a member of the Council of the latter for several years. Dr. Paterson has also
been a member of the Central Board of Health for nearly 20 years. His views on the
J J
important branch of medical science which has formed his special study, have never
appeared in print ; but as a practitioner, his experience and skill command respect and
admiration throughout Australia. Since his return from England, Dr. Paterson has
resumed private practice.
Mr. John Felix Martin
MR. JOHN FELIX MARTIN was born in Cornwall in 1846, and came to South
Australia 39 years ago with his father. Mr. Felix Martin. Almost immediately
he engaged with his uncle, the late Hon. J. Martin, in his foundry at Gawler,
subsequently becoming manager of the business. Since his hand has been at the helm,
he has influenced the business largely. Its interests have been his interests, and he has
given to it the whole of his time and thought. He has, therefore, not found time to take
part in public movements, but a few years ago he was gazetted a Justice of the Peace.
With the control of an immense concern, Mr. Martin must be considered as one of the
leading and most able of the business men of South Australia,

The late Mr. Nathaniel Edmund Phillipson
T Hit RE are so many risks attached to sheep and cattle-breeding in the far north
country of South Australia, that it is almost exceptional to find a man who has
made such undertakings remunerative. This part of the Province has accomplished
the downfall of many men who hive staked scores of thousands of pounds on the chances
of a fortune. It is said that of
those who have made pastoral
pursuits a success in these remote
areas, the late Mr. Nathaniel
Edmund Phillipson and Mr. Peter
Waite were the most successful.
Mr. Phillipson was one of the
shrewdest of men, and a provident
and far-seeing manager. A man
of detail and persistence, he gained
wealth where other people about
him were beinn ruined. Born in
O
Adelaide in 1844, he was a son
of the late Mr. Montague Phillip-
son, and nephew of the late Mr.
Philip Levi, well known in
pastoral circles. In 1862 Mr.
Phillipson went to the distant
Umberatana Station, owned by
the late Sir Thomas Elder, and
there began his extensive con-
nection with the expansive, but
often illusive, north country. Pie
quickly gained the confidence of
his employer, and becoming his
representative, enabled that large
investor to obtain considerable
profit from his stations. In 1866, when Sir Thomas introduced Afghans with camels from
India, Mr. Phillipson studied the language of the former, and displayed considerable business
tact in connection with the camel trade. He had the management of immense interests,
and the trust confided in him bore fruit. In the early “seventies,” Mr. Peter Waite, who
subsequently became Chairman of Directors of Elder, Smith, & Co., became joint manager
with Mr. Phillipson, and the two together formed a powerful combination. The northern
holding's of that larg'c house were transferred to the Beltana Pastoral Company, of which
O O 1 *
Mr. Phillipson was the largest shareholder, and became the managing director. He spent
the main portion of his life remote from his fellows, and was thus a sort of advance guard


of civilisation. His knowledge of the country, and of the history of its climate, was such
that he was prepared for almost every emergency, to the advantage of the (locks and
herds under his control.
In 1892 Mr. Phiiiipson removed from the north and took up his residence at
Walkerville, Adelaide. He married, in 1880, Miss Levien, of Sydney, and left a family
of three daughters. His retirement was not for long, for on August 18, 1898, he died
after six months’ illness. His funeral was attended by representatives of the principal
South Australian pastoralists, by whom he was much admired for his abilities. Mr.
Phiiiipson is remembered for his almost unique, and decidedly beneficial, work in the
north ; for in his fight with Nature in a sullen and hostile shape he was victorious. He
was for many years a justice of the Peace.

Mr. Friedrich Eduard Heinrich V\ ulf Knchaufi
AMONG the prominent authorities on agricultural matters and on land legislation in
the Province, Mr. F. E. H. W. Krichauff takes a leading place. A J'euton by
education and birth, he has devoted the best years of his life in South Australia
to advancing the cause of agriculture, and is a native of Schleswig, Duchy of Schleswig,
where he was born on December 15, 1824. In consequence of the troubles of 1848, he
came in that year to South Australia, and first settled in the Bugle Ranges, and there
employed himself in cultivating the soil and in generally developing the land he had taken
up. In October, 1864, he came to Adelaide, and engaged in business as a land and
commission agent, which he carried on until 1893, when he retired. Besides his private
work, Mr. Krichauff early began to serve his neighbors as their representative in public
offices. He became a member of the Macclesfield District Council, and was its chairman
for many years; and he was also engaged in a similar capacity on the Strathalbyn District
Council. At the first general election after the granting of responsible government Mr.
Krichauff, in 1857, was returned to the new House of Assembly for Mount Barker. His
object in going into Parliament was to support Sir R. R. 1 orrens’ Real Property Act.
Artesian boring for water was then in its infancy, and Mr. Krichauff visited Honolulu
and inspected the bores put down there, as well as, afterwards, those by the United States.
On his return he advocated the system for South Australia. Prom 1858 to 1870 he was
out of Parliament, but in the latter year he was returned for Onkaparinga, which he
represented for 12 years. He resigned in 1882, and visited Europe, Great Britain, and
the United States. In 1884 he was elected to the House of Assembly for the Victoria
District, and served that electorate for six years. In 1891 he entered the Legislative Council
as member for the Southern District. He retired from the political arena in 1894.
Mr. Krichauff was practically the originator of the Forest Department. In 1874 he carried
a measure to prevent the introduction of phylloxera, and was one of five Commissioners
who enquired into the working of the Real Property Act. On the establishment of the
Agricultural Bureau in 1888 he was appointed a member of the Central Bureau. He has
been a member of the Council of Agricultural College since its foundation.

Mr. George Front
o
BORN at Camborne, Cornwall, on June 10, 1839, Mr. George Prout has. like so many
of his countrymen, for years been a mining man of influence in Australia. The county
in the south-western corner of England is the cradle of successful miners and restless
colonists who have scattered themselves over the globe, and, with the “ cross-grained friend ’
called experience, and hereditary
instinct, delved in every clime, or
become good husbandmen. The
comprehensive development of
Australian mining fields is largely
o o J
due to their knowledge and
thoroughness and enterprise.
Mr. George Prout, better
known as Captain Prout, came to
South Australia with his parents in
the ship Lady Bruce , in September,
1846. After working for a few
months, in 1847, in Foster’s Brick-
field, he became an ore-dresser at
Peach’s Mine, Glen Osmond, the
ruins of which can still be discerned
by the curious. At the beginning
of 1849 he proceeded to the Burra,
where he worked at the great
copper mine there until the early
part of 1852. Pie then returned to
his home at Kensington Park, then
known as “ Little Cornwall,” whence
he went with his father, the late Mr.
George Prout, to the Kchunga gold
rush. This field did not afford
much scope ; and the father, who
had previously been to the Victorian diggings, returned thither, taking his son with him. Ihe
pair started from Melbourne with a team conveying tools and provisions, and took the
Forest Creek track. When passing through Black Forest, heavy rains caused them to abandon
the team, and to tramp to Forest Creek through mud and slush often up to their knees. 1 hey
did not recover their possessions until three or four weeks later, when they were brought in
by teamsters. Although a mere boy at the time, Mr. Prout entered very thoroughly into
the work and spirit of the diggers, and while growing in stature, gained a splendid experience.
In the same year (1852), the first Wesleyan Chapel was built on the goldfields—at Forest
C re ek—and Mr. Prout was one of the first boys to attend the school attached to it. Fie was


tor some time engaged at Preshaw’s Plat, between Castlemaine and Campbell’s Creek,
with his residence at the latter place. He remembers seeing, at this place, 50 lbs. weight
ot gold taken from a bucket of washdirt obtained at a depth of 25 feet. In November, rBS
Mr. Prout temporarily left the fields for South Australia, returning to Victoria in a little
while with his mother, brother, and sister.
Although passengers by the fastest boat then on the coast, they were 14 days
accomplishing the distance between Adelaide and Melbourne. The passage was stormy, and
it was sometimes feared that the vessel would sink. In the eastern capital the family were
met by Mr. Geo. Prout, sen., who had purchased a horse and dray and a large tent for
After a six days journey the family arrived at Campbell’s Creek. At the Seventy-feet Hill
uish, the 1 ope by which the lad was descending his father’s claim -80 ft. deep—snapped, and
he fell a distance of 75 feet, breaking his ankle and splitting his leg upwards for 10 inches.
1 his claim proved rich, containing some five or six feet of washdirt, In 1854, after spending
his Christmas in bed, owing to his accident, young Prout went to the Tarrangower (Maldon)
rush on crutches ; but not being successful there, he went on to Avoca. He had by this time
discarded one crutch, and, although still somewhat impeded, was able to help his father, and to
do well himself on the latter field. Ihe first load of washdirt they obtained, at the bottom of
a shallow hole, went 13 ozs. of gold. Prom Avoca the pair journeyed to Mount Mologa,
Sandy Cieek, Adelaide Lead, Back Creek, and Dairy Hill. Between the two last places (now-
called Palbot and Amherst) the father boug'ht some land in 1854. The son, as with other
diggers, went from field to field, being successful in some and not in others. From Dairy
Hill he removed to Fiery Creek (Beaufort), Glenpatrick, Pleasant Creek, St. Arnaud’s,
1 iddler s Creek, and Scandinavian Crescent at Back Creek. He remained at the last place
tmm 1856 to 1863, and lost most of his accumulated money in speculating. As a consequence
he had again to assume nomadic habits. He proceeded to Chinaman’s Flat, thence to
dunes and Ballarat. In 1866 he returned to Talbot, and selected land on the Bet Bet Creek,
neat \\ oodstock Station, where for eight years he engaged in mining and farming ; but with
small rewards. He became a member of the Lilliam School Board, and opened a Sunday-
school, known as the United Sunday-school, for all denominations.
sold his land, came back to South Australia, and carried on business
lor five years in Adelaide as a rough carpenter. He next became agent for the Australian
Widows’ Fund Life Assurance Society, and canvassed through the Far North for 12 months
with a good deal of success. Tiring of this life, however, he returned to his proper
calling, mining, and was engaged to report on reef country at Mount Brown, New South
Wales. After completing this work in 1881, he became manager of the South Australian
1 respecting Association, on behalf of which he prospected through the Par North. It
was his intention to go through the Barrier country, but he was compelled to turn back
owing to a severe drought. He worked at Echunga until the latter part of 1882, when
he went to North Queensland to report on the Union Mine, Mount Davenport, which
he pronounced to be worthless. In company with three other gentlemen, he travelled
through Charters I owers and Ravenswood, and recommended an outlay in proving Kirker's
Reel, fie took charge ol this claim in 1883. While here he was gazetted a Justice of
the Peace, and he held that position until he left Queensland in 1886. He had for years


been trying to mature a process of dry gold amalgamation by the vapors of mercury, and
he now introduced the process to some gentlemen in Sydney. They were favorably
impressed with the principle, and, with Mr. Prout’s assistance, they erected a plant on
his plan at Mr. John Sands' Dockyard, Pyrmont. After three months it proved a success.
Mr. P rout was congratulated on all sides as having laid the foundation of a fortune. He
only lived in this state ol bliss for four days, when it was discovered that the principle
had been patented by Drs. Foster & F'eisman in America eight years before.
After this disappointment, Mr. Prout returned to Adelaide, and for four years
carried on mining in manganese, between Eurelia and Edeowie, sending thousands of tons
of the mineral to England. Being of an inventive turn of mind, in 1889 Captain Prout
went to England to secure patent rights all over the manufacturing world for a system of
welding copper to iron for ship-building purposes. Before securing the patent, a search
was made of the records over the preceding period of 40 years to see if the process had
been forestalled ; and as no previous registration of it was found, Captain Prout took
out the patent rights for every country but America, for which latter he was kept waiting
for two years. A syndicate had in the meantime been formed to purchase the process
after a successful trial had been made. This was carried out at Birmingham with great
<■>
success. It was arranged that as soon as the Captain secured the American patent rights
the syndicate was to give him £ 10,000 and 40,000 fully-paid-up shares in a company of
200,000 shares. But he was again doomed to disappointment, for, after much circumlocution,
it was learnt that the discovery had been patented 65 years before.
Captain Prout was not without honor in the old country. His qualities as a
mining expert were approved, and he was engaged to report on various properties. He
was sent to Sicily to inspect silver-lead mines, which he pronounced suitable ; to North
Wales to examine gold reefs, which he found unpayable ; and to South Wales to report
on a recent silver-lead discovery. He recommended that a company should be floated to
work the last, before doing which those interested called upon Captain Thomas, of the
Dalcouth Mine, for a report. This authority confirmed Captain Prout’s opinions, and a
company was formed ; and the mine has now been working for some years. Captain
Prout was also asked to report on the caustic soda smelting process at Newcastle-on-Tyne.
His report was favorable, and he was given sufficient interest to become a director of the
company. Upon the retirement of one of the directors, the Governor of the Bank of
Ivngland, chairman of the Board, nominated Captain Prout to the vacancy, which he
filled till he left England for South Australia once more in 1892. Late in that year he
was sent to Western Australia to report on mining property at Coolgardie. He made the
voyage and journey in company with Mr. S. W. Pearce and his son, William Pearce. Later
on, he was the second expert to report favorably on the Great Boulder group of mines.
Like so many immensely wealthy properties, these mines were at first reported on adversely
by many of the experts, and the subsequently-proved correctness of his report is a tribute
to Captain Prout’s knowledge. It is also a tribute to the mining acumen of Cornishmen
to record that the only other favorable opinion given by experts up to this time on the
Boulder Mine was that of Captain Oates, of Southern Cross, also a Cornishmen and an
experienced Australian miner. Captain Prout spent five or six days in thoroughly examining

the whole of the claims in the Kalgoorlie locality, and was so impressed with them that
he wired to Adelaide for as many shares in the syndicate as could be obtained. His
agent, however, took no action, because so many bad reports about these properties were
being published every day.
Captain Prout then returned to Adelaide for a few months, when, with Mr. S. \\ .
Pearce, one of the discoverers of the Boulder Group, on behalf of a syndicate, he made a
prospecting tour in the Dundas district, and discovered the Ladv Mary and other properties,
which were afterwards floated into companies. He had charge of the Lady Mary for
two years, and was first Chairman of the Progress Committee on the Norseman. He assisted
J o
in building the first Union Methodist Church on the Dundas fields (which was opened free of
debt) and was one of the speakers at the opening ceremony. He left the West in October,
1896, tor Adelaide. In 1897 he proceeded to England to patent an ore-crushing machine;
but, owing to certain proceedings in Adelaide, had to relinquish the idea. He witnessed the
Record Reign Celebrations, and then returned to South Australia. He has since resided in
Adelaide, and passes his time in watching over his mining interests, and as an investor.
Colonel Lewis George Mad ley
COLONEL LEWIS GEORGE MADEEY was born near Tintern, Monmouthshire,
in 1844, the main portion of his education being imparted at St. Mary’s School.
Cardiff, and at Highbury College, in London. Among the professions, he chose
that of teacher, and when about 21 years old, in 1865, he proceeded to Sydney, under
engagement to the New South Wales Government, to take charge of the St. James
Model and Training School. Almost immediately upon his arrival in the sister colony he
identified himself with the military movement, and in February, 1866, he joined the New
South Wales Volunteers. Late in 1873 Colonel Madley was appointed by the South
Australian Government, Head Master of the Model School. Grote Street. Three years
later he became Principal of the Training College, a position which he held until 1896.
While so engaged, Colonel Madley associated himself with the local volunteers. He attended
the inaugural meeting of the South Australian Rifle Association, and became its first secretary.
In June, 1877, he was the first to enrol as a private in the South Australian Volunteer Militia
Infantry, and he assisted as drill-instructor to the first recruits. In November, 1877, he
was gazetted Captain of the South Adelaide Company, and therefrom he rapidly rose.
He was promoted to the rank of Major in 1880, and in May, 1882, he was gazetted
Lieutenant-Colonel of the Ist Regiment, a position which he held until its disbandment
in 1895. When Colonel Owen retired, he was offered the high position of Commandant
of the South Australian Forces ; but at that time he did not see his way clear to accept
the command. He now holds the local rank of Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General. In
September, 1896, he was appointed Chief Commissioner of Police in South Australia, in
succession to the late Mr. W. J. Peterswald.

Mr. William Richard Randell
WHEN, during the second decade of the past century, the River Murray was
discovered by Hume and Howell, at Albury, New South Wales, curious
speculations were indulged in as to the probable magnitude of this central
water-way, and as to its importance to settlement. It was years later that any extent
of the Murray was surveyed ; and
J J
it was left to Sturt, in 1830, to
determine its outlet in Lake Alex-
andria. Even then doubts existed
as to the maritime importance of
the great river ; and in the follow-
ing year Barker and others were
despatched from New South Wales
to see whether the mouth afforded
passage for large ships. A negative
reply gave much disappointment to
the authorities, and so, for a few
years, no attention was devoted to
the great river. When the Province
of South Australia was founded, it
was the belief of some influential
pioneers that the capital should
have been established near the
mouth of the Murray, principally
because of the water-way ; but,
though several settlements were
made upon its banks in the three
colonies concerned, no serious effort
was made for many years to use the
J J
water for transit purposes.
Mr. William Richard Randell
(better known as Captain Randell)
has the distinction of being the first to run a steamer along the sinuous course of the
Murray, and since that time the river has assumed more and more importance in the
eyes of politicians. It has been the subject of many intercolonial disputes, and has
almost decided the fate of State policies of international importance.
Mr. W. R. Randell was born at Sidbury, Devonshire, on May 2, 1824, and was
one of the earliest arrivals in South Australia. He was educated partly at Exeter, England,
and partly in Adelaide, where he arrived with his father, Mr. W. B. Randell, in October, 1837.
The latter gentleman was one of the first sub-managers of the South Australian Company,


and subsequently engaged in pastoral pursuits on his own account. Ihe son, after
completing his education, assisted his father on his station property, and was for some years
engaged in the milling trade at Gumeracha. It was in 1853 that he began his eventful
connection with the River Murray. As he was but 13 years old when he arrived in South
Australia, he had imbibed into his mind the essentials of colonisation, and had acquired that
pluck, energy, and perseverance necessary for colonial pursuits. He apparently saw a
considerable future before water traffic on the Murray ; and, though he had never been on
board a steam vessel in his life, he in 1853 planned and built at his own expense, a steamer
tor this trade. This vessel, named the Mary Ann , was duly launched, and Mr. Randell
navigated her along several hundred miles of water, beyond the border of South Australia,
beyond the confluence with the Darling' and other considerable New South Wales rivers, as
J O
far as Maiden’s Punt, now known as Moama on the New South Wales side, and Echuca on
the Victorian banks.
When returning from Maiden’s Punt, he met the Lady Augusta (Captain Cadell),
with the Governor on board, and carried despatches from her to South Australia. This
was the beginning of the large steamer traffic which, in later years, was carried on the
waters of the Murray. Besides his enterprise, readers will admire the ingenuity of
Mr. Randell in constructing a river craft, inexperienced as he was. Travellers now-a-days
on the steamers which run over part of this course speak in glowing terms of the scenery
viewed- tortuous windings, overhanging gums, reaches of rich plains, paddocks of wheat,
flourishing gardens, commanding cliffs, engineering feats, and (in spring) magnificent
panoramas of wild flowers -and they can appreciate the sometimes wild and generally
uncultivated scenery seen by Mr. Randell before graziers, farmers, and gardeners had
built their homes on the banks. In his pioneer voyages Mr. Randell had many difficulties
to contend with, and not the least were those due to the presence of “snags” in the
stream.
Two years after thus opening up the trade, Mr. Randell built a still more powerful
steamer, the Gemini , with which he proceeded up the Murrumbidgee as far as the township
of Hay, then known as Lang’s Crossing. “In the following year,” says Mr. Heaton in
his “ Australian Dictionary of Dates and Men of the Time” (1879), “he took the Gemini
up the Darling, which had been previously navigated by Captain Cadell as far as Mount
Murchison (now Wilcannia). Mr. Randell went about 1,000 miles farther up the river
to where the township of Brewarrina now stands, where, the water being low, a rapid
prevented farther progress. The next trip, the river being higher, he was enabled to
go about 250 miles farther up (too by land) to Walgett, on the Namoi, a tributary of the
Darling, and then the farthest post town in Riverina.” By such courageous navigation
he secured a large share of the river traffic, and became possessed of a remunerative
connection. Provisions of every kind were taken to towns which sprang up in various
places, and timber, wool, wheat, skins, and other products were carried back. The trade
had many features of interest, and Mr. Randell has a large fund of entertaining anecdote
and experience on which to draw for the benefit of his friends. F'or opening up the river
traffic he received a bonus of from the South Australian Government, and was
presented by the public with a purse of A4OO and a testimonial.


In a lecture entitled “ Australia: What it is, and what it may be,” delivered
at the Metropolitan Hall, Dublin, on May 7, 1863, by Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell,
ex-Governor of South Australia, the lecturer said:- —“The most remarkable voyage,
J o
however, which has hitherto been made in Australia most certainly was one undertaken
by Mr. Will iam Randell. That gentleman has scarcely had justice done him ; for he
appears to me, from indubitable evidence, to have been the first navigator of the Murray
in a steamer. Yet, as he started in the year 1853, just before a trip made by the then
Lieutenant-Governor, accompanied by Captain Cadell one of the most enterprising,
useful, and, I may say, übiquitous of Australian pioneers - the official <*clat and general
importance of the latter somewhat obscured the more modest pretensions of Captain Randell.
Not merely, however, was he the first 10 start, despite of slender means and a frail
steamer —which, I believe, he had himself built but he actually persevered till he got to
Echuca, which is farther by several hundred miles than Swan Hill, the point then reached
by Captain Cadell.
“Again, in 1859, Mr. Randell made another ascent of the Murray, and from
it went up the Darling. I was myself at the time engaged in a pioneering voyage
up that river, with Captain Cadell, and we had succeeded in reaching a point at Menindie,
1,200 miles from the sea, when, as we were descending, Mr. Randell appeared with
apparently a rather crazy and broken-winded steamer, which vastly amused the natives
by its melancholy wheezing and puffing. Yet in that boat Mr. Randell not merely
succeeded in getting higher than our highest point, but, owing to a fortunate flood,
was enabled to reach Tort Bourke. He then passed on to one of the Darling’s
upper branches, called the Barwon and Namoi, and finally proceeded to a distance which,
after comparing notes with him on his return and examining the maps, I could not make
out to be less, if we include the extremely tortuous windings of the rivers, than 1,800
miles from the junction of the Darling with the Murray, and therefore 2,400 miles from
the sea-mouth of the latter. I remember at the time transmitting a report to that effect
to the Secretarv of State. Thus, in a country where drought and suffering from want
✓ J o o
of water are so common, Mr. Randell made a voyage of nearly double the length possible
on any European river."
In 1892 Mr. Randell relinquished his practical connection with the Murray River
trade, although his steamers are still running, and took up his residence on land he purchased
at Gumeracha. Here he has followed a quieter and less exciting occupation, but one not
less useful. He has taken great interest in the improvement of his property, and has
entered into public affairs. He was the first chairman of the Gumeracha Butter. Cheese,
and Produce Society. In April, 1893, he offered himself to the suffrages of the electors
of Gumeracha for a seat in the House of Assembly, and was returned—an honor that
was repeated at an election on July 10, 1896. As a politician, Mr. Randell showed
as much common-sense, intelligence, and courage as he did earlier in life, and proved a
useful representative of his constituency. He was, years ago, gazetted a justice of the
Peace. Mr. Randell has the characteristics of a large-hearted colonist, and in his time
has done excellent work for the Province, wherein he has resided for 60 years.

Mr. Charles Rasp
T 7()UNG mining towns supply magnificent examples of the irresistible energy of man.
X Anyone visiting Broken Hill to-day finds it difficult to believe that only 17 years
ago there were not a dozen regular residents in all the district. At that time its
mineral area was the site of a remote and not particularly remunerative sheep station. I o-day
great mines have been opened,
o
countless tons of precious metal
have been won, a pretentious city
has been built, and many
thousands of people have taken
up their residence on the one
time lonely sheep-run.
One of the most prominent
of the men connected with the
early development of Broken Hill
is Mr. Rasp, who has the credit
of havine been the first discoverer
< »
of mineral on the site of the
present world-famed Broken Hill
Proprietary silver mine. Charles
Rasp was born in Germany in
1846, and in 1869 took up his
residence in the colony of
Victoria. After being engaged in
agricultural operations for a couple
of years, he became associated
with pastoral pursuits in New
South Wales. Good fortune
eventually attracted him to the
Mount Gipps Station, on the
Barrier Ranges, which embraced
the country since become so
J
wealthy and thickly populated owing to the opening up of the Broken Hill mines. While
engaged on station work there, discoveries of silver were made at Silverton and Day Dream,
O «-> ’ J
not far distant ; a fact that led every station hand in the neighborhood to carefully
* o ✓
scrutinise the country for indications of the metal. In 1883, while thus employed, Mr. Rasp
found that on the rising ground of the station were outcropping argentiferous indications.
He was thus the founder of the famous mines. Losing no time, he. in conjunction with
Messrs, David James and James Poole, pegged out four blocks in this locality, in one of
which was the celebrated Proprietary Mine. As the original metal was believed to be tin.
the leases were taken out for silver, tin, and lead. Some time later three more blocks were


taken up, and Messrs. George McCulloch, George Urquhart, James Lind, and Phillip Charley
became partners with the three above-named.
There were now seven blocks pegged out, each of about 40 acres, and
probably no richer argentiferous group has ever before been selected by one party of
men. In Australia it has its parallel only in the selection by the Brookman
party of the Great Boulder group of gold mines at Kalgoorlie. After a certain amount
of work was done, the properties were taken Overby a company in Melbourne. As often
occurs in the case of immensely wealthy mines, some time elapsed before the public would
or could believe in the Broken Hill field. Developmental work proceeded ; but experts, as in
the Kalgoorlie episode, reported unfavorably of the prospects. The chlorides and other good
species of metal, however, enabled the group to pay its way and to actually force itself
into the confidence of investors. Hitherto few people in Australia knew anything about
silver mines, and they had not been aware that within easy access was an investment with few
parallels in the history of argentiferous mining. But when the initial stages were over, and
the richness of the new find could no longer be denied, an enormous “ boom ” was started.
Men invested in almost anything at Broken Hill ; mines are even said to have been floated
into largely capitalised companies, which possessed not even the indications of metal. The
excitement was universal in Australia. From half a score of people in 1883, the population
of Broken Hill rose to upwards of 20,000 in 1890 and enormous quantities of metal
were won every week from the Proprietary group of mines.
Mr. Rasp was prominently connected with Broken Hill for some years ; and the
circumstances of his find In 1883, and his great confidence in its wealth, led him to amass
a fortune. Lie was the owner of a large number of shares in the Company, and when
the dividend stagfe arrived he removed to Adelaide to reside, and at Willyama, in
the suburb of Medindie, he possesses what might be termed an ideal home, tastefully
furnished, and with well-laid-out grounds. Mr. Rasp has since been prominently identified
with mininp- in Western Australia, and is a Director of the Kalgoorlie Bank of England
Company, the Princess Royal, and the West Collie Coalfield Company, besides being a
shareholder in a number of others. As founder of perhaps the most celebrated silver
mine in the world, Mr. Rasp is a man of mark and interest. His present comfortable
circumstances are well deserved ; for, by his faith and that of his original companions,
South Australia and New South Wales, as well as Australia as a whole, have gained
very substantial advantages.
Mr. Arthur Lindsay
MR. ARTHUR LINDSAY was born in the west of Ireland in 1828, and in 1863
he came to this Province. In 1866 he became clerk to the Destitute Poor Board,
and since that time- 32 years —his energies have been devoted to the philanthropic
cause. In 1869 he became Superintendent of the Destitute Asylum and Secretary to the
Destitute Board; and in January, 1889, was appointed Chairman of the Board. He has
the responsibility of the destitute people throughout the Province of South Australia.

The late Mr. David Reid
THE late Mr. David Reid labored for many years in the Province of South Australia,
and, in his later days was one of the leaders of industry in Adelaide. He was
born in 1823 at Stirling, Scotland, within sight of the famous castle. Educated in
his native town, after leaving school, he became an apt pupil in the tanning business. In
1857 he came to the colonies,
spending his first two years ol
colonial life in Victoria, being
engaged in a large tannery
establishment at Richmond. De-
ciding to come to South Australia
in 1859. he quickly obtained a
position as foreman at the tannery
of Mr. Dench, a pioneer in the
leather trade of that Province,
He next launched, on a modest
scale, the “ Stirlingshire Tannery,”
an institution which, in after years,
assumed large dimensions. This
is situated at Hindmarsh, and now
regularly employs 60 hands. Its
beginning was unpretentious,
nevertheless, by a dailv conserva-
tion of forces and expansion of
facilities, Mr. Reid soon built up
a splendid trade. Well supplied
by machinery, at the time of his
J J
death the Stirlingshire Tannery
J
was regarded as one of the best-
equipped in the Province. Mr.
Reid had the knack of gathering
round him first-class employes, and
there are still men working in the
tannery who were with him at the start. The leather manufactured has always borne
J '
a high name for quality, which is not to be wondered at when it is remembered
that Mr. Reid- -a shrewd and observant man —learnt the art of tanning in the old country.
Mr. Reid, while always having the interests of Hindmarsh at heart, never engaged in
public affairs. Eor many years he resided at Torrenside, but afterwards removed to
Mills Terrace, North Adelaide, and it was there he died, on January 11. 1898, after
a short illness. His son, Mr. }. H. Reid, proved to be a valuable assistant in the tanning-
business, and, possessing good commercial acumen, is a worthy head of an institution like
the Stirlingshire Tannery, and ranks as a leading figure in local industrial matters.

Mr. Henry John Richman
THE heroes of Australian history are the pioneers, who, with life in hand, venture
into the lonely bush to fight with man and with Nature. The large slice of the
continent which was entrusted to the government of South Australia perforce
turned the thoughts of her people to exploration, and the Province thus became the
theatre of many tours of discovery.
J J
Perhaps the most valuable of the
pioneers is the enterprising settler
who ventures beyond established
boundaries and proves the quali-
ties of new soils and atmospheric
conditions. To such a class the
subject of this sketch belongs ;
and, though now ripe in years,
he still possesses all those stout,
fearless qualities of mind and
frame which are rightly associated
o ✓
with Australian pioneers.
Mr. Henry John Richman
was born at Lymington, Hamp-
shire, England, in January, 1826.
Arriving in this Province three
years after its foundation, he
completed his education under
the late Rev. T. O. Stow ; and
then commenced to climb the
ladder of fortune from the lowest
rung. He worked for some time
O
on farms and sheep-stations until
he had acquired sufficient capital
to stock a station with 1,400 sheep
at Mount Brown. He thus
embarked, in October, 1849, and the conditions in so remote a locality at that early date
were far from favorable. Ihe station was situated in what is now know nas Richman s
Valley, near Ouorn. It was surrounded by high hills, and infested with natives, who
proved extremely troublesome. Having a strong propensity for sheep - stealing, these
blacks employed the boldest methods to attain their object. Sometimes they would cut
numbers off from the flocks unobserved by the shepherds; and on dark, rainy nights
would even prowl into the yards, situated quite close to the hut, and carry off the animals.
The troubles with blacks were not confined to theft, for the natives showed that they


were capable of darker crimes on occasion, and old colonists well iccollect the murder
of Mr. Brown, whose station (Mount Arden) bordered on that of Mr. Kichman.
In the early “fifties” the discovery of gold in Victoria caused a general stampede
of shepherds and station-hands to the diggings in that colony, and in 1852 Mr. kichman
was compelled to sell his sheep at a low figure and follow his employes to the Eldorado
of the East. He remained at the diggings for a brief period ; but meeting with little;
success, returned to South Australia. It was then still impossible to procure hands to man
the station, and, having a little capital left, Mr. kichman purchased two teams ol bullocks,
with which he followed the occupation of a carter until the requisite supply of labor was
forthcoming. Then returning to the North, he shortly afterwards removed to the western
side of Port Augusta, in consequence of the resumption by the Government of the land
around Mount Brown. In those days squatters’ licences were issued, giving no definite
title to any distinct piece of ground ; and it was under one of these that Mi. kichman
had held his land at the Valley. The new property, now known as the Old Lincoln Gap
Run, was among the first selections taken up on that side of the Gulf, and here Mi. kichman
spent many years. He next took up a run called Pernatty, 100 miles north-west of 1 ort
Augusta, and subsequently acquired a property known as the McDouall Peak, situated 300
miles north-west of Port Augusta. For long years this hardy pioneer struggled against
droughts and bad seasons, holding heroically to his land till it was almost impossible to
retain it longer. Through the kindness of his brother-in-law (the late Sir Walter W . Hughes),
who gave him some shares in the Moonta Copper Aline, he was enabled to weather the
hard times, and has since succeeded in securing an independency.
Four years ago Mr. kichman was compelled to retire from the active management
of his stations owing to an affection of the eye, which, subsequently, caused the loss of
his sioTt. He is now living: in retirement in Adelaide, and is disposing of his Northern
o o
property. Though of ripe age, and afflicted with blindness, Mr. Richman retains full
possession of his faculties, and has a store of anecdote and reminiscence readily accessible.
He is indeed a striking figure in this newer generation.
The late Mr. Caleb Peacock
THE father of the late Mr. Caleb Peacock, the late Mon. William Peacock, M.L.C.,
arrived in the Province in the ship Glenalvon on December 28, 1838, and was
among the most prominent of the veteran pioneers. At the time of the financial
distress in Governor Grey’s term of office he was an earnest advocate of just treatment
from the Imperial Government. In 1842 he was elected an alderman of the City Council.
He supported the voluntary principle in religious matters, and spoke on the subject at
several meetings held in 1846. In 1848-9 Mr. William Peacock gave weight to the
agitation for a system of representative government, and, after that principle was granted,
was elected to the Legislative Council for Noarlunga in 1851. He retained his seat until
1856, but did not enter Parliament under responsible government until 1861, when he
resumed his place in the Legislative Council. He retired from Parliament in 1869. As
a politician he was a decided Liberal. He was for years a deacon in the Hindmarsh
548
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Mr. H, j. Ridm»n


Square Congregational Church, and died on January 21, 1874, aged 84 years. Mr.
William Peacock founded the firm of W. Peacock & Sons, tanners and wool scourers.
The late Mr. Caleb Peacock was born in Adelaide in 1841, and was one of the
first half-dozen students to attend the old educational establishment of the late Mr. J. L.
Young. Upon leaving school he was engaged in the office of Messrs. Beeby & Dunstane,
millers, of Grenfell Street, whence, after a few years, he proceeded to Blanchetown, on
the River Murray, and established an agency business. At an early age he manifested that
unselfish spirit which was ever his characteristic. Among his fellow-employes in Adelaide
was a young fellow who was in receipt of a higher salary than his. It was observed by
the firm that Mr. Peacock was a promising young business man, and they decided to dismiss
the higher-salaried man and to put Mr. Peacock in his place. This arrangement the latter
would not agree to ; and, rather than be the cause of the dismissal of his companion, he
severed his connection with the firm. At Blanchetown Mr. Peacock secured a large connection
in the transport of wool, wheat, Hour, etc. Upon the death of his brother, Mr. Joseph
Peacock, who for seven years represented the District of Sturt in the House of Assembly, Mr.
Caleb Peacock removed to Adelaide and took charge of the tannery business of \\ .
Peacock & Sons, with which he was associated to the time of his death.
Mr. Caleb Peacock first entered public life in December, 1875, when he was
elected to the mayoralty of Adelaide. He had the distinction of being the first native-born
J J
South Australian to occupy the civic chair. Among other matters which he supported
was the deep-drainage system. During his mayoralty the Adelaide and Suburban I ramways
were established, and the Adelaide Bridge over the I orrens was opened. He was chairman
of the South Australian Committee tor the Indian Famine Relief Fund, to which the
Province contributed £ 10,000. On behalf of citizens he presented farewell addresses to
Sir Anthony Muserave when that administrator left the Province to become Governor of
Jamaica, and addresses of welcome to the succeeding Governors, Sir \\ . \\ . Cairns and
Sir W. F. D. Jervois,
Notwithstanding his undoubted ability, Mr. Caleb Peacock did not have a lengthy
political career. He was elected unopposed to the House of Assembly for North Adelaide
on December 16, 1878, to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Neville Blyth,
but did not again contest the seat. But in other respects Mr. Peacock gave much of his
time and advice to commercial, charitable, athletic, and social movements. He was a
Director of the Adelaide branch of the National Bank, Chairman ot the South Australian
Board of Directors of the Mutual Assurance Society of Victoria, Vice-President of the
South Australian Cricketing Association, President of the Adelaide Rowing Club, life
member of the Adelaide Children’s Hospital, member of Committee of the Blind and
Deal and Dumb Institution, member of Council of the Zoological Society, and at one
time President of the Adelaide Club. He was a founder of the Lodge St. Albans
(Freemasons), and was its second Worshipful Master. He died on 1 tbiuaiy 1/, ißqo.
Mr. Caleb Peacock’s popularity was so great, his kindly character was so much
admired, that his funeral obsequies were attended with unusual gloom. One who had taken
so large a part in the life of the city could not but be missed, and remembered with regret.

1 he Seppelt Family
DESCRIPTIONS have been given in preceding pages of this work of the fertility
of the district of Barossa. In this congenial region are found the finest vineyards
in South Australia, and among the principal of these is that of the Seppelt family.
Mr. ). E. Seppelt, the founder, was a native of Silesia, Southern Prussia, and arrived in
this Province in 1849 with his
wife and his son Benno, the latter
then three years of age. Two
years afterwards Mr. Seppelt
settled in the Barossa district,
where he laid out and planted a
vineyard, which ever since has
borne the name of Seppeltsfield.
It had a modest beginning, but
increased with the years, till now
its name is known in many lands.
Mr. ). E. Seppelt launched
his vineyard on a firm basis ; but,
dying in 1867, just when the
industry was beginning to ex-
pand, the work of carrying it on
to its present dimensions fell on
the shoulders of Mr. Benno
Seppelt, then a young man, who
had just attained his legal
majority. A worthy son of a
worthy father, Mr. Benno
Seppelt has ably developed the
industry his father initiated, and
J
to his tireless energy and fruitful
inventive faculty is due the
J
proud position that Seppeltsfield
holds to-day.
J
The Seppeltsfield Estate proper comprises 1,500 acres of excellent land, through
which pleasantly meanders the Greenock Creek, at once a source of water supply and a
provision of natural drainage. Situated on the banks of this quiet stream is the homestead,
embowered in native eucalypts co-mingling with the greener growth of European forest
trees. Dotted round the homestead are many substantial buildings, with tall smoking chimney
J O’ O J
stacks, giving the place that air of bustling industry which suggests a miniature manufacturing
town. Though it has many auxiliary undertakings, wine-making is, of course, the first and
most important business at Seppeltsfield. The area of vines under cultivation is about 120


Stump & Co., Photo MR BENNO SEPPELT
acres ; but this would appear to be a mere bagatelle, seeing that Mr. Seppelt annually
purchases from 2,000 acres of vines and upwards for his capacious winery. Experience
has taught him that while it is well to have his own vineyard as a stand-by for the
<S> J J
manufacture of certain classes of wines, the judicious buying of grapes from surrounding-
growers means both economy and expedition in the manufacture. In 1890 Mr. Seppelt
found his plant insufficient to cope with the growing demands of his trade, and having
the inventive faculty highly developed, he set to work and designed the present winery,
which is 120 feet by 90 feet. An authority, “Mela Leuca,” a well known writer on these
subjects, referring to this establish-
ment, has said :—“ It is probably
unsurpassed for completeness, as
judged by the general design and
perfectness of the arrangements,
the finish and durability of the
fittings, combined with moderate
outlay of capital, ease and
economy of working and cleanli-
ness, by any similar structure in
J J
the world There is certainly
nothing equal to it in Australia.”
In establishing this winery Mr.
o J
Seppelt showed himself to be a
master of detail, and the authority
before quoted adds that it “is the
practical embodiment of the in-
genious, methodical, painstaking,
unassuming character of the
O
designer.” The present storage
capacity at Seppeltsfield is esti-
mated at 800,000 gallons ; but it
is proposed to increase the
cellarage accommodation to
1,000,000 gallons —truly a colossal
storage.
Of the subsidiary indus-
J
tries at Seppeltsfield, it may be mentioned that the distillery was erected in 1877 at
a cost of over The prejudice against Australian brandy is rapidly dying
out, and the pure grape brandy manufactured by Mr. Seppelt has slowly but surely
made its way into public favor. Connected with the distillery are several large cement
storage tanks for wine intended for distillation purposes, and a large cellar capable of holding
60,000 gallons, which is used as a bonded store, and kept under Government seal.
Here the brandy is retained and matured in wood for many years. Another auxiliary
establishment the vinegar manufactory —is situated on a sloping bank to the west
of the homestead, Mr, Seppelt produces two classes of vinegar white and brown;


and the output for the year is over 50,000 gallons. The cordial factory now
occupies the original cellars of Seppeltsfield, and it was here that the late Mr. J. It. Seppelt
first started his business in a humble way. Here are quaint, grey old vaults, reminiscent
of early Continental wine-making centres. In addition to the manufacture of many cordials,
liqueurs , such as Maraschino and Curacoa. are produced. The cooperage is an important
department, in which ten men are employed all the year round in the manufacture of
casks, etc.
Mr. Seppelt’s operations do not, however, end here, for he has a fine bacon-curing
establishment. For the purpose of securing the best bacon, he has blended Berkshire
and Essex pigs, large herds of which are always kept on the farm. Mr. Seppelt has
also about 1,000 pure merino sheep, which run on the pleasant pastures lound the
homestead. This description of Seppeltsfield would be incomplete without a passing
reference to the laboratory, which Is under the skilled supervision of Mr. Oscar Seppelt,
Mr. Benno Seppelt’s eldest son. As all the manufacturing processes are conducted on
scientific lines, the laboratory is a first necessity, with its apparatus for chemical microscopical
testing, examination, and experiment. Mr. Oscar Seppelt had a trained education in a
leading Austrian viticultural college, and the experience acquired in the Continental school
has made him a valuable lieutenant to his father. Mr. Camillo Seppelt is also a useful
assistant; and it is well that Mr. Seppelt has such sons to fill positions of responsibility
in connection with his large business. Mr. A. I). Bruce is Mr. Seppelt s Adelaide manager,
and when it is stated that the annual sales of Seppeltsfield wines alone amount to 300,000
gallons, some idea of the commercial work entailed on that gentleman is indicated.
Mr. Bruce has ably helped to make Seppeltsfield products known in colonial homes, foreign
exhibitions, and English houses.
Mr. Benno Seppelt has lived to see his fathers and his own efforts mature in
full fruition. A man of many parts, he leads a busy life, and bears the impress of that
stamp of enterprising colonists who tend to make history by expanding industries in all
their usefulness. Mr. Seppelt has never sought after public life. He prefers to attend
unrestrainedly to his own business.

Mr. Peter Dowling Prankerd
\ MONO the number who established an excellent reputation in South Australia for
enterprise and astuteness is Mr. Prankerd. He was born at Langport, Somersetshire,
England, on July 14, 1819. He took to the sea, and passed several years in the
South Sea Islands. In 1850 Mr. Prankerd came to South Australia, and for 22 years he
aided in developing the young country. He engaged in business as a land and estate
agent. After a time he entered into partnership with Mr. Peter Stuckey. He was
prominently associated with the Wallaroo and Moonta copper mines. So successful was
Mr. Prankerd in South Australia that he amassed considerable wealth, and in 1872
proceeded to England. He there purchased an estate called the Knoll, Sneyd Park, near
Bristol, where he now resides.

Mr. James Shaw
PERHAPS no better example of popularity won by homely deeds and disinterested
charity could be found among the leading commercial men of South Australia than
Mr. James Shaw. Born at Belfast, Ireland, in 1846, Mr. Shaw was educated
in that city of eminent engineers—a profession in which his father, Mr. Hugh Shaw, was
a practitioner. In his youth he
imbibed a longing for adventure,
and, when 18 years old, in 1864,
he sailed to Auckland, New Zea-
land. Before he had attained his
majority he launched out as a
contractor, and youthful optimism
and enterprise enabled him to take
a leading position. The power to
calculate to a nicety must have
been inherent in him, for, even at
this youthful age, he succeeded in
a notably risky occupation. He
built many substantial houses in
the North Island, and accumulated
a large connection. While he was
thus engaged, the Maoris made one
o o
of their many efforts to overthrow
the British. “ Their lands—as
great and lordly as themselves-
o J
had been theirs for centuries ; and
to regain them they, with sinister
o >
fierceness, occasionally visited the
might of their arm on the white
population.” Continues a Western
Australian biographer: —“ Mr.
Shaw went forth into the thickest
of the fight, and did good service.
o O
In dangerous positions enough, he came through them unscathed; and his pluck and
soldierly qualities were rewarded by a service medal. In 1866 the war was brought
to a close.”
Mr. Shaw remained in New Zealand for four years after the war, when, in 1871,
he came to South Australia. Adelaide was then rapidly becoming an important city. About
this time large areas in the Middle North were thrown open to agriculture, and magnificent
crops caused unparalleled expansion in the Province. I here was a general advance in the
value of city land, and new buildings arose on all sides. Mr. Shaw took advantage ot
J 7 o #
this animation, and established himself as a contractor in the metropolis. He carried out


large contracts, and some of the handsomest structures in the city were erected by him.
o ’ j j
Among them were the Houses ol Parliament, new Government Offices, Government
Workshops, large bank buildings, the Australian Mutual Provident Society’s buildings,
and many private offices and residences. He was probably the chief building contractor in
South Australia, and declined offers from other colonies to negotiate large works there.
As a large employer of labor, he showed that he was something more than a mere business
man. It a workman accidentally met his death while in his employ, the family was well
provided for. He paid good wages, and deported himself towards his men in a uniformly
considerate spirit. His business dealings were therefore attended with happy consequences.
During the years while thus engaged, Mr. Shaw became a popular citizen, as
well as a progressive one. His general conduct, and his unselfish spirit, endeared him
to his fellows. He was elected a member of the Adelaide City Council, and devoted to
his civic duties time that could be ill spared. He was associated with the Council for eight
years; for part of the period as Alderman. In 1889 he was elected to the Mayoral
Chair, and his hospitality in civic functions, and his liberality among the poor, won general
admiration. In addition, he made a close study of municipal matters, and did good work
J I 7 O
for the Corporation. But constant labor impaired his health, and Mr. Shaw was compelled
to forego for a time further municipal office. He proceeded to the sulphur springs of
New Zealand, and the good will and regret expressed at his departure was universal.
After a lengthy absence he returned to Adelaide.
o J
In 1893 Mr. Shaw visited the newly opened Coolgardie Goldfields of Western
Australia, only a few months after their discovery by Bayley and Ford. In the absence of
railway communication, and even of simple travelling facilities, Mr. Shaw’s task was a
formidable one. At the railway terminus at Northam, he and his companions en mimed a
J iOO
trap drawn by six horses for the journey. 1 hen followed a dreary drive of nine days
through lonely bush and sandy desert, under a torrid sun. Coolgardie was a collection of
a few tents, in the midst of which teamsters and camels camped to the detriment of public
health. Life was rough and ready, and it was only the hardy and the courageous who
could bear it under such conditions. Despite the weariness of such a tedious drive, Mr-
Shaw forthwith made a thorough inspection of the then known gold area, and invested
considerable capital in several mines. He decided to remain in Coolgardie; and his
investments proved highly remunerative ; he was one of the owners of the Londonderry
mine, floated in London for ,£700,000, and held shares in Bayley’s South Extended
Oroya, Ivanhoe, Lake View, Mount Charlotte, Golden Age, Crusoe, and many other
o j
companies. But though his time was largely occupied in supervising these extensive
interests, he threw himself very heartily into local public movements. He greatly helped
the Progress Committee elected by the residents to uphold the rights and advance the
claims of Coolgardie, and to improve the sanitary condition of the locality. Population
there Increased so rapidly that it became absolutely necessary to establish some order in
the community. The streets, from being the camping ground of horses and camels, were
in a wretched condition, and sickness became general. Mr. Shaw infused life into the
proceedings of the committee, and was an active agitator for the proclamation of a
municipality. After this was granted, and before the municipal machinery could be brought


into action, he caused many of the chief nuisances to be removed at his own expense,
and had other necessary work done. When the first Municipal Council was formed, he
became the first Mayor of Coolgardie, thus, in obedience to the wish and choice of the
people, being the first chief magistrate of the Western goldfields. But his election to this
office cut two ways ; it was a just tribute to his public spiritedness, and was greatly to
the advantage of the town itself. He threw himself with tireless enthusiasm into the
work of improving the town, and adopted advanced measures. At this task he worked
day and night, and quickly created excellent sanitary conditions. He remained in office
lor 17 months, and, in November, 1895, he retired. There was certainly no more
popular man on the goldfields than Mr. Shaw, upon whom was conferred the affectionate
title of “ Chief.” The “ Chief ” also rendered good service in placing Kalgoorlie under
municipal law.
So closely was Mr. Shaw engaged in disinterested service that his health again
broke down, and in December, 1895. he left the goldfields for the New Zealand sulphur
springs. The expressions of esteem announced on the occasion of his departure were
heartfelt, for the goldfields’ residents do not forget those who have done them service, and
banquets were tendered in his honor. While in Coolgardie he held office in different athletic
clubs, and was Vice-president of the Chamber of Mines and member of the Stock Exchange
from their inception. In 1896 he was asked to contest a goldfields' seat in the Legislative
Council of Western Australia, but declined. In Adelaide he has lived a retired life. He
is a life member of the North of England (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) Institute of Mining
Engineers.
Both in Adelaide and Coolgardie Mr. Shaw is noted for his charity. The biographer
before mentioned declares that in Western Australia “ hundreds of needy people have
cause to revere his name -the struggling prospector, the poverty-stricken unemployed, the
anxious business man who cannot pay his way : each has come within the range of his
benefactions. And the same could be said of the poor of Adelaide.
Colonel Makin
SOUTH AUSTRALIA for its population and the conditions of colonial life, possesses
a fairly large force of volunteers, officered by capable local residents, amongst
whom is Colonel Makin, who was born at Salford, Lancashire, in 1842, and educated at
Blackpool. In June, 1861, he received his first commission as ensign in the 56th
Lancashire Rifle Volunteers, now the 3rd Volunteer Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers.
In December, 1863, he was commissioned a lieutenant, and in 1867 a captain, in the
same regiment. In 1868 Colonel Makin came to South Australia, and began a successful
mercantile career in Adelaide. When the local volunteer movement was inaugurated in
1877, he received the commission of captain in the Adelaide Rifles, and commanded the
Gawler Company. During 1880, he commanded his regiment for some months. In
1882 he became lieutenant-colonel; in 1885 he was made an hon. aide-de-camp to
Governor Sir William C. F. Robinson, and again in 1889 to 11 is Excellency the Earl of
Kintore, also subsequently to Sir T. F. Buxton.

Mr. Alfred Muller Simpson
IF the motive springs of each individual life—no matter how high or low—could be
fathomed and analysed, the onlookers would learn something highly instructive and
edifying. Emerson repeatedly set fortli that each person has a predilection for some
sphere. Unconsciously, and often in self-delusion, the motive springs draw him to
the point for which his character
and attainments fit him. Those
inward impulses are as helms on
the sea of life.
Alfred Muller Simpson was
born in London more than 50
years ago. His father, Mr. A.
Simpson, founded the South
Australian firm of A. Simpson
and Son. In 1848 the family
came to the Province on the
John WoodhalJ Mr. A. M.
Simpson being then an infant.
Since that year his home has
been in South Australia, so that
to all intents and purposes he
may be considered an Australian
native. After leaving school
young Simpson entered his father’s
business house ; and, as in old-
established houses in England,
he worked his wav through its
J O
various departments to a partner-
ship. The transmitted qualities,
the proved and acceptable routine
established by years of experience,
explain much of the success of
a family house of business men. In course of years, Mr. Simpson’s aptitude for business
was abundantly demonstrated. He proved himself a worthy assistant and successor to
his father, and from a young- man fresh from school bent on learning a business, he graduated
J O O o
to a master who could decide large issues and departures. Mr. Simpson was gifted with
a business-like, shrewd mind, and his abilities have carried him into the first rank o(
Adelaide business men. As a matter of fact, the firm of A. Simpson N Son is known
as the largest business of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. Mr. Simpson was one of
the founders of the Adelaide and Suburban Tramway Company, of which he is still a Director
j v j <
and he holds a similar position on the Board ol the South Australian Gas Company.


A man with a wide experience of local commercial interests is eminently useful
in Parliament, and in June, 1887, Mr. Simpson was elected by the Central District
to a seat in the Legislative Council. His election was exciting, and suggestive of the
repute in which he was held. Lie came out on the very last day of the nominations, and
J J
was returned at the head of the poll. There were seven candidates, and the Hon. J. H.
An gas held a position on the poll next to Mr. Simpson. For over six years the latter served
his electors faithfully in Parliament. Of a Conservative nature in politics, he was a bold
speaker, declaring his earnest opinions whether they pleased or not. He would not curry
favor of his constituents by saying one thing and believing another.
Mr. Simpson took an active interest in tire Jubilee Exhibition in Adelaide in
1887. He was President of the Roval Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South
•> <2 j
Australia, and a member of the first committee of the Australian National Union- the
forerunner of the Australian Natives’ Association. He is an earnest student and disciple
of Preemasonry. In 1883 he took an active part in establishing the Grand Lodge of
South Australia. He is at present President of the Board of General Purposes, a Past
Deputy Grand Master, and a Past Master of the Mostyn Lodge, and of the lodges under
the old constitution.
Mr. Simpson has served a faithful stewardship in the Province. In business, in
politics, in semi-social functions, and among his friends, he is highly respected, not only
for his strength of character and judgment, but for his manliness and uniform kindness
Mr. David Lindsay, F.R.G.S.
FOR the past score or so of years exploration has been chiefly conducted by pastoralists
and private travellers. Only a few large and officially equipped parties have been
sent out. Of these latter, one led by Mr. David Lindsay has been the most
important. He was born at Goolwa, South Australia, in 1856. Moved by an adventurous
spirit, Mr. Lindsay determined to engage in exploring work; and in June, 1882, he
severed his connection with the Government, and conducted private mining surveys for
about 12 months. He was now given charge of a Government exploring party. Mr.
Lindsay set out in 1883, accompanied by three white men and two black boys, with 32
horses. The natives in the territory he traversed were particularly dangerous. Near
Castlereagh Bay a tribe of aborigines drove off all the horses of the party. About 300
blacks attacked Mr. Lindsay and party, but the use of blue fire and firearms secured the
safety of the explorers. A journey to the south-western districts of South Australia followed
this exploring expedition, and Mr. Lindsay succeeded in finding a road from the coast to
the Warburton Ranges. When the South Australian branch of the Australasian Geographical
Society accepted the offer of the late Sir Thomas Elder to equip a party to explore
certain unknown tracts in South and Western Australia, Mr. Lindsay was appointed leader
The season was unpropitious, necessitating several changes in plan of route, but ultimately
he reached the Murchison, where dissensions resulted in the disbandment of the party;
but Mr. Lindsay was exonerated from all blame as the result of an inquiry held in
Adelaide. After residing in Coolgardie for a short period, and paying two visits to
England in connection with flotation of mining properties, he has again returned to Adelaide.

Dr. William Ramsay Smith, B.Sc., M.8., C.M., etc.
A USTRAP I A is wealthy in the possession of men who have sacrificed the cultured
surroundings of the Old World to take their places as the exponents of art and science
in this continent. To the Universities of Great Britain and Europe she is indebted for
many of her most learned scientists. The hospitals bear eloquent testimony of their work ;
and the Universities, museums, and
other schools are stamped with the
impress of their talents
In South Australia a valuable
addition has been made to the
highest grade of medicine and
o o
science in the person of Ur. \\ illiam
Ramsay Smith, President of the
Central Board of Health, and Citv
✓
Coroner for Adelaide.
The subject of our sketch was
born in Aberdeenshire on Novem-
ber 27, 1859, and his career from
his boyhood has been an illustration
of Scottish ability, determination,
and pluck, combined with the most
indomitable energy. Prom the
O J
country schools he passed directly
to Edinburgh University, and for 1 3
O J
years he was connected with that
institution as student, graduate,
lecturer, examiner, assistant pro-
fessor, and acting professor. II is
career was one long record of
indefatigable hard work ; and there
was scarcely a subject he took up
in the whole courses of arts, science, and medicine in which he could not have taken a
foremost, permanent place. At the age of 18 he entered the University. With honors
in Natural Science, he passed the examinations in all branches of the Arts course, with
the exception of Classics. He sacrificed the Senior Classical Lectures for the sake of
attending courses of lectures in Advanced Metaphysics, Moral Philosophy, and the History
of Philosophy. In these subjects he took a high place, and became a prizeman in
Mathematics and Logic. From this he proceeded to the further study of Science, and
took the degree of Bachelor of Science in the Department of the Natural Sciences, embracing
the subjects of Botany, Zoology, Geology, and Physiology. During his Arts course he


was for two years President of the University Philosophical Society, a society which
has done much to mould the minds of many of the best-known Scottish thinkers and
writers of the present dav. In 188/ Ihe extended the already wide field of his learning-
* 1 J o
to Medicine. Upon entering that study he gained a Vans Dunlop scholarship of the
value of awarded for the highest total of marks at the Preliminary Examinations
for the years 1883-84, securing the scholarship in open competition with some of the
foremost graduates ot the Scottish and English Universities. Immediately afterwards
he was appointed Senior Assistant Professor of Natural History, one of the Chairs in
the Faculty of Medicine; and held for five years the post of Demonstrator of Zoology
in the University of which he had been so successful a student. The labor and honor of
re-organising and conducting the work of the largest biological laboratory in the United
Kingdom fell to Dr. Ramsay Smith, who soon became one of the best-known and most
< ’ J
highly appreciated lecturers on the staff of the University. He also, during that time,
lectured to the classes for women in connection with the Edinburgh University.
O J
In 1891 he was appointed to the post of Demonstrator of Anatomy in the
Edinburgh School of Medicine, and Lecturer on Biology; and in 1892 he was appointed
one of the Examiners for the Degrees in Medicine and Surgery of the Royal College
of Physicians, Edinburgh ; and the Faculty ol Physicians and Surgeons, Glasgow. In
J O J J O 7 O
addition to this work, he conducted a large number of scientific investigations for the
o o
Fishery Hoard for Scotland. His paper on the “ P'ood of Pishes,” read before the British
Association for the Advancement of Science in 1892, was reckoned the most complete and
comprehensive contribution ever made on that subject, embracing the results of four years’
investigations carried on for that Board. He graduated in Medicine and Surgery in 1892,
after completing his course of training several years previously. His interest in education
was not confined to University work, but extended to common school and secondary
school education ; and he was, at the earliest age on record, made a Fellow of the
Educational Institute of Scotland in appreciation of the services he rendered to education,
and especially to teachers in the matter ol fixed tenure of office. All this time his
interest in social problems took practical shape. For many years he was an active
office-bearer of Free St. George’s Church, Edinburgh, and there was associated with all
the foremost men of the time in the Free Church and other churches in Scotland. He
was an active member of various societies—the University Total Abstinence Society,
Athletic Club, and White Cross Society ; and although not a member of the Edinburgh
Social Pinion, which has gone far to solve practically the problem of the leavening of the
masses, he gave that society the greatest help possible by breaking up, by his intimate
knowledge of the intricacies of legal and sanitary procedure, extensive rings, and
combinations of rings, of slum owners that had defied both law and public opinion for
years.
In [892 Dr. Ramsay Smith engaged in private practice, and also in sanitary work
for the Local Government Board for Scotland. His services in this direction were recognised
bv the Board in the warmest manner; and it was admittedly through his exertions that
J
the Board was enabled to carry out sanitary reforms of a most extensive and thorough
nature. Dr. Ramsay Smith, on deciding to devote himself more exclusively to medical
Z 'y
DO J
Or. w. r. Smith ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


work and investigation, declined an invitation to take a highly-coveted post which was
open to him in the hospital where he had spent so much time and had done so much
work, preferring to gain experience in private practice as the best foundation for future
specialism. He conducted a large general and consulting practice for nearly three years
at Rhyl, the well-known seaside resort in North Wales.
In [line, 1896, he left Rhyl for South Australia. The Adelaide Hospital secured
his services, and he was appointed to the post of senior physician of that institution.
In physical as well as mental undertakings Dr. Ramsay Smith has been distinguished.
From his boyhood he has taken an active interest in military matters. He was one of
the original officers of the Medical Staff Corps in connection with the Edinburgh I niversity,
the second corps of the sort formed in the United Kingdom, and composed entirely of men
with special surgical and military training. On the reorganisation of the forces in South
Australia he was appointed surgeon-captain and attached to the Field Artillery. In addition
to this, he undertook the organisation and training of the Field Hospital Corps, and brought
it to a high pitch of efficiency. His military experience, however, always extended beyond
the non-combatant branch of the service ; and when the South African War ot 1899
claimed the services of every commissioned officer, as well as most of the non-commissioned
officers in the Field Artillery, he took over the command of this branch, at the request
of the responsible authorities, and set about the task of reconstructing the battery. 1 his
he accomplished in a most satisfactory manner.
Dr. Ramsay Smith, as Medical Officer to the Adelaide Gaol, has done a large
amount of important medico-legal work in connection with criminal investigations in this
Province. Since his arrival in the Province he has been engaged on every great criminal
trial ; and he may be said to have reduced scientific investigation in this department to a
fine art. One famous trial, the first of the sort in which a conviction was secured, Dr.
Ramsay Smith was complimented by Chief Justice the Right Hon. Sir S. J. Way, Part.,
for the excellent manner in which he gave evidence in such cases, and for the faculty he
possessed of making the most difficult and abstruse subjects perfectly plain. In connection
with the Streaky Bay murder cases, Mr. Justice Kundey said that Dr. Ramsay Smith’s
manner of giving evidence was “a pattern to all medical witnesses.”
n O i
As a writer, Dr. Ramsay Smith has also gained distinction. His intimate knowledge
j o o
in almost every department of medicine and science has made him a ready and accurate
scribe, and the many scientific works which he has published have gained the favor and
commendation of professors and lecturers in most of the Universities and Colleges in the
United Kingdom. It is worthy of record that some of his investigations have been
O J o
referred to in the reports of various European Governments as the most complete and
trustworthy work done in those subjects, and have been adopted as models for similar
investigations in other countries.
In his literary efforts Dr. Ramsay Smith has not, however, confined himself
exclusively to subjects belonging to his profession. A casual article sent to an Edinburgh
newspaper led the editor to write immediately that anything else from the same quarter
would be welcome ; and Dr. Ramsay Smith joined the small band of ardent young Scotch
560
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Dr.w.R. Smith


writers that the editor had gathered round him, the best-known of whom is ). M. Barrie.
Ihe combination was an advantageous one for paper and contributor; and for several
years Dr. Smith was a constant writer of articles, leaders, and reviews to the Scotsman
and its evening edition, the Dispatch , on sanitary, social, literary, and scientific subjects. In
ihpg he had the honor of being asked to join the staff of contributors to the “Medical
Annual.” an international year-book of medical progress the contributors being specialists
in different departments of medicine and surgery in the various countries of Europe and
in America. He was also an extensive contributor of articles, chiefly zoological, to the
new edition of Chambers’s Cyclopaedia. Among Dr. Ramsay Smith’s contributions to
scientific and medical literature are the following- : —“ Illustrations of Zoologv : Invertebrates
o o ✓
and Vertebrates ” ; “Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on Natural History “Handbook
of Practical Zoology ” ; a series of handbooks to the professional examinations in Edinburgh
University; Reports on the “Food of Fishes”; “Hermaphroditism in the Haddock”;
“Abnormal Arrangement of the Subclavian Artery”; “Hermaphroditism in the P'rog ”;
“The Muscular Mechanism of Walking”: “A Case of Abnormality of the Finger-nails”;
The Function of the Peroneus Tertius Muscle ” ; “ The Logic of Medicine ” ; “ Haemorrhage
from the Alveoli checked by Puff-ball”; “A Case of Acquired Umbilical Fcecal Fistula”;
“A Case of Bleeding by the Urachus ’ ; “The Course of the Recurrent Laryngeal
Nerve”; “A Definite Form of Skin Disease allied to Erythema and Urticavia”; “An
Over-driven Heart: a clinical study ” ; “ Angio-neurotic CEdema ” ; “On the Long Sensory
Root of the Ciliary Ganglion, as figured by Cloquet ” ; “ Hereditary Malformation of the
Hands and I 7 eet, with operation of one subject”; “Breathing in Singing”; “A Case of
Angio-neurotic CEdema”; “A Case of Labor with Cardiac and Renal Complications”;
“ The Treatment of Constipation in Typhoid Lever ” ; “A Study in Identity of the
Dead"; “Death in the Status Epilepticus ” ; “Some Notes on hirst Aid”; “Researches
into the Anatomy and Surgery of the Lower Extremity ” ; “A Clinical Study in Diabetes”;
“Heart Pain”; “Original Investigations into Diseases of the Vaso-motor System”; and
other works.
The Surgeon-in-Orclinary to Her late Majesty the Queen, when writing of Dr.
Ramsay Smith, said : —“ His scientific attainments, his ability as University Assistant, his
power of communicating knowledge as well as accumulating it, by a true and scientific
method, made him a man marked out by his native talents for the position of teacher.
His practical aims were, however, never lost sight of for a moment, and his stores of
knowledge in the practical departments of surgery and medicine were quite as remarkable
as his scientific attainments. His contributions to the literature of surgery and medicine,
commencing at an early period in his practical studies, point to a power far beyond that
of the ordinary student in grasping the important bearing of any practical observation
and of contrasting it with acknowledged results.” The President of the Royal College
of Surgeons, Edinburgh, also said:—“l regard Dr. Ramsay Smith as a very remarkable
man, and confidently anticipate for him a very great future, likely to add a lustre to any
public institution, whether as a teacher or as a practitioner, with which he may be associated.
I shall deem any medical school or hospital as indeed fortunate in securing for their service
a practitioner of such scientific attainments and a scientist of such undoubted practical
qualifications.” Without any disparagement to his medical work, it was as a sanitary
r
535
Dr. w. r. Smith ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


reformer that Dr. Ramsay Smith did his most permanent work in Scotland and Wales,
and it was as a pioneer in public health that his friends and associates expected most
from him.
His appointment to the Adelaide Hospital, whilst it gave him an opportunity of
extensively and thoroughly studying the diseases of the Province, had the effect ot withdrawing
J O J *
him from active administration in sanitary work. But his appointment as President of the
newlv reconstructed Central Board of Health for South Australia gave him the opportunity
he had been so long prepared for, and he turned to the task oi bringing the new Public
Health Act into operation. The completeness and foresight with which this work was done
soon evidenced when, at the end of the year 1899, the Board and Government were
called upon to deal with the first cases of plague that had appeared on the Australian
continent. South Australia was prepared to undertake the detection, isolation, and treatment
of cases in such a prompt and effective manner as scarcely any other colony could equal.
To a knowledge of the principles of sanitation and legislation he adds such personal
supervision and a mastery of detail that nothing is overlooked or unprovided for.
A strong Saxon clear sense of justice, inherited from one side by ancestry, and
a fervid Celtic philosophical spirit from the other, has formed a combination which makes
him an impossible man to those who follow crooked ways or practise oppression or injustice in
any form. Otherwise Dr. Ramsay Smith is the pleasantest and most sociable man possible.
Mr. Henry Scott
MR. HENRY SCOTT is a native of Boode, near Braunton, North Devon, and
was born in 1836. When 18 years old he came to South Australia, and in
1854 became clerk in the mercantile office ot his brother, Mr. Abraham Scott.
In 1866 he took over his brother’s business as a wool merchant. He is a commission
agent, and was attorney for the Cornwall hire and Marine Insurance Company until its
amalgamation with the Commercial Union Assurance Company, of which he is now a
director ; he is also the representative of the Eagle Life Assurance Company. He was
for many years a director of the National Bank, and took an active part in the
foundation of that institution in Adelaide. He has been a director of the Bank of
Adelaide since 1889, and also a director of the Queensland Investment and Land
Mortgage Company, as well as of the National Mutual Life Association. Lor 35
years he has been an important pastoralist. In 1877 Mr. Scott was elected Mayor
of Adelaide, and applied all his energies to the inauguration of an efficient system of deep
drainage for the city. In 1878 he was elected to the Legislative Council (before the
subdivision of the Province into electoral districts), and he sat in the Upper House
continuously from that date until 1891. He is Vice-president of the Adelaide Benevolent
and Strangers’ Friends’ Societv, Chairman of Committee Home for Incurables, member of
o J '
committee of the Blind and Deaf and Dumb Institution at Brighton, and President of the
Zoological and Acclimatisation Society. Mr. Scott has been a prominent all-round colonist.
He possesses the characteristic persistency and boldness of the Britisher, with his wisdom
in council and his charity to the poor. In Parliament and in the City Council he did a
good work, and one which is prominent in the annals of South Australia.

Mr. R. Barr Smith
MR. R. BARR SMITH was born in the parish of Lochwinnoch, in the County of
Renfrewshire, Scotland, in 1824. Emm school he proceeded to Glasgow University.
After leaving the University, he followed various commercial pursuits in the city
of Glasgow, and subsequently came to Melbourne. Early in 1855 he came to South
Australia, and joined the firm of
Elder & Co., then composed of
Mr. Th omas Elder and Mr.
George Elder. On the with-
drawal of Mr. George Elder in
1856, Messrs. Edward Stirling
and John Taylor were admitted
as partners, business being carried
on under the style of Elder,
Stirling, & Co., until 1863, when
Messrs. Stirling and Taylor
having retired, Mr. Thomas
Elder and Mr. R. Barr Smith
continued the business under the
name of Elder, Smith, & Co., until
1888, when it was transferred to
Elder, Smith, & Co., Limited.
In the early periods of the
Province’s growth there existed a
wide field for enterprise, of which
the firm of Elder, Smith, & Co.
availed itself. Its members,
seeing that careful operations
would give a remunerative return
to their capital, developed and
extended their business of mercan-
tile, pastoral, and financial agents.
Shipping agencies, charters, and imports became portions of their business undertakings,
and, with the capital thus accumulated, large financial operations were entered upon.
The history of the Wallaroo and Moonta Copper Mines is inseparably connected
with the firm of which Mr. Barr Smith was partner. When the Wallaroo Mine was
discovered, the prospectors needed money for development. They entered into negotiations
with the firm, who advanced capital for working purposes, and for this financial
assistance many of the shares of the company became the property of Mr. R. Barr
Smith and his partners. After a time, when the shafts had found their way deeper


into the bowels of the earth, operations got into full working order, a thousand men
were employed on the mines, and the claims became precious possessions, yielding
substantia] dividends for the shareholders. The original lease of the Moonta Mines from
the Government was for 14 years, and on the expiry of that period, a payment of
10,320 was required by the Government for a further 99 years’ lease.
In the year following the discovery of the Wallaroo Mines, the firm made
advances for the development of the Moonta Mine, which ultimately became one of the
richest copper centres in the world. As in the former case, the lease expired at the end
of 14 years, and was paid to the Government for a 99 years’ lease of the
mine. Extensive smelting works were erected at Wallaroo Bay. The firm performed
a good service for the whole Province in financing the development of these metallic
resources.
Mr. R. Barr Smith did not confine himself to mercantile operations, but entered
into pastoral pursuits in South Australia, and became also largely interested in pastoral
properties in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland.
His homes are I orrens Park, near Mitcham, and Auchendarroch, Mount Barker.
As a commercial man, his judgment is sound, and his word always to be relied
upon. As a citizen, he has identified himself with many public movements, and his gifts
to educational, patriotic, and philanthropic objects, have been large. Eor his many
services towards his adopted country and her institutions, and for the hearty interest he
has constantly evinced on behalf of local welfare, Mr. R. Barr Smith has won affectionate
esteem.
Professor Robert Langton Douglas, M.A.
THOUGH born in an English Midland county, Cheshire, Professor Robert Langton
Douglas is of Scotch blood. Whilst still a boy, when residing with his parents in
South Yorkshire, he came under the influence of Mr. Ruskin, who had then
recently established his museum at Walkley, near Sheffield. A year or two later he met
Mr. C. H. Firth, of Balliol College, Oxford, the distinguished historical specialist, who oave
Professor Douglas invaluable help in his historical studies in the two years preceding his
matriculation at Oxford. It was these two influences the influence of Mr. Ruskin,
and the influence of Mr. C. H. birth that helped to determine the direction of Professor
Douglas's intellectual activities. He graduated at New College, Oxford, in 1886, obtaining good


honors in Modern History. After taking his degree he was appointed a Lecturer in Foreign
History, and a Leader of Home-reading Circles in connection with the Oxford University
Extension Scheme. Professor Douglas was ordained in 1887, and worked for two years in
a South-East London parish. In 1889 he returned to Oxford, and remained there for six
years. During this, his second period of residence in the University town, he began to
apply himself more and more to the work of research, spending a considerable portion
of his time at the Bodleian Library, and making frequent visits to Italy. He adopted as
his special subject the history, literature, and art of the Renaissance. Subsequently he
determined to devote himself entirely to literary and historical work. Prom November,
1895, to March, 1900, Professor Douglas resided for the most part in Italy, working
in the archives and libraries there. He received great encouragement in his historical
o o
researches from leading historians, such as the late Bishop of London, Professor Villari
of Florence, and Dr. Thomas Hodgkin ; whilst his literary work won for him the friendship
of Mr. George Meredith and Mr. W. E. Henley, and of some P'rench men of letters. In
O j
1897 Professor Douglas edited Geoffrey P'enton’s “ Certaine Tragicall Discourses "an
Elizabethan translation of some talcs of Bandello —for Mr. Henley’s admirable “Tudor
Translations Series.” His introduction, which embodies the results of a good deal of
original research, deals with the influence of the Italian novel on the Elizabethan drama.
In 1900, Professor Douglas published his monograph on Fra Angelico, a
work which had occupied him for some years. The book was most favorably noticed in
the leading English, American, and Continental reviews, and the large first edition was
OO 4 ’
out of print in three or four months. As the season of 1900 was a bad one lor
all books except those dealing with subjects connected with the war, the success of
Professor Douglas’s volume was the more remarkable.
Professor Douglas is now completing a History of Siena, which was largely
written in the Italian town. P'or Messrs, Murray, he is editing Crowe and Cavalcaselle’s
o-reat work on Italian painting, the late Sir John Crowe’s manuscripts having been
1 y.J
placed in his hands. He is also writing a history of Savonarola’s Convent, the convent
of San Marco, Florence, which will be published by Mr. George Allen. The Renaissance,
its literature, art, and history, is not Professor Douglas’s only special subject of study, he
is also deeply interested in the American revolutionary period. He has been asked to
write a series of articles for a leading American review upon certain events in the War of
Independence. P'or some years Professor Douglas was a constant contributor to the
Bookman and the Daily Chronicle. Mr. Douglas has also contributed articles to the
Nineteenth Century , the Guardian , and other leading reviews.
Ever since taking his degree Professor Douglas has evinced a great interest in
elementary education. He has acted as manager of a public elementary school, as an
instructor" of pupil teachers ; and when residing at Oxford as a graduate, he might
himself have frequently been found teaching in a public elementary school.
Mr. Douglas was appointed Professor of Modern History and English Literature
at the University of Adelaide at the commencement of the year 1900, and at the close
of that year he was elected Dean of the P'aculty of Arts.

Tuttle & Co., Photo LATE MR. SAMUEL SMITH
The Smith Family (Yalumba)
LT P from the plains and among the hills about 50 miles from Adelaide lies the
J reposeful town of Angaston. Snugly ranged amid the sweetest type of Australian
hills and valleys, it bears a reputation unsurpassed in South Australia. Its soils
have lent themselves to the quiet toil of orchardists, vignerons, agriculturists, and
pastoralists, and it perpetuates the
name, honored throughout the Pro-
vince, of George Fife Angas, one of
the founders of South Australia. The
fame of some of the Angaston people
extends much farther than the limits
of the Province, and amongst them
are the members of the Smith family,
of Yalumba, who for nearly 54 years
have been developing the district in
their vineyards, and who have made
Angaston known not only in Australia,
but in other continents. The founder
of the family was the late Mr.
Samuel Smith, whose interesting
O
biography, with that of Mr. Sidney
Smith, is appended.
The late Mr. Samuel Smith was
born in Dorsetshire, England, in 1812,
and came to South Australia in the
year 1847 with his wife and family-
four girls and one boy, Sidney.
Mr. Smith was a passenger in the
ship C/i2na, and among others on
board were Mr. (afterwards Sir) John
Morphett, late president of the Legisla-
tive Council, and Dr. Bull, who
practised medicine for many years at the Burra. Mr. Smith, with his family, resided for
a few months on the Torrens, near Paradise, and he early recognised the vast possibilities
of the soil and climate for viticulture. In the old country he had been a brewer, and
the knowledge he gained in following this vocation became specially useful to him.
He determined to go to Angaston, and accordingly set off with his wife, family,
and belongings, in a bullock dray. The party managed to obtain amusement on
the journey, for they stopped en route at the historic “Old Spot,” Little Para, to enjoy
some rustic sports and races which were in full swing at the time. When nearing
Angaston, on a wet Saturday night, the bullocks became thoroughly spent, and were


i
Frilh Ling Photo mr. Sidney smith
unyoked. Mr. Smith and family sought refuge in a cottage hard by. The shepherd who
owned the cottage with its neighboring plot of land received the benighted travellers
with that cordial hospitality so characteristic of early colonists, and treated them to mutton
chops and damper. There was a hut near at hand in which the host directed them to
make themselves comfortable. This structure was built on the slope of a hill, and during
the night a heavy rain brought the flood waters rushing into the hut. Mr. Smith and
O J o o
family when they awoke just at daylight were astounded to see their household gods
floating round them. Such was their first experience in the Angaston district, and after
scrambling out, damp and miser-
able, they resumed the journey.
It is worthy of note that the
old hut still stands, and about it
flourishes one of the best kept
vineyards in South Australia—
J
owned by the Smith family.
When Mr. Smith arrived at
Angaston the town contained but
10 or 12 houses, and these were
occupied mostly by people con-
nected with the estate of the late
Mr. George Fife Angas. In 1849,
Mr. Smith took up a piece of
land, which he planted with vines
and orchard trees. This spot was
a pretty one, and such as lent
itself to the purposes of a charm-
ing Australian home. Great gum
trees grew over the land, and
these the pioneer and his family
had to hew down. The vines
grew; but the outlet for their
produce was so limited, that when
the Victorian goldfields were
discovered, Mr. Smith went to
Ballarat and Bendigo. Fie sank
16 holes without getting the color of gold, but he persisted, and in the seventeenth struck
the precious metal. With him in these adventures were men who afterwards passed quiet
and useful careers in the Clare and Kooringa districts. After his return, Mr. Smith
enlarged the orchard and vineyard, and the trees made excellent growth. He called his
place Yalumba, a native name, signifying “all the country around,” and it is of interest to
record that the nucleus of many of the gardens which now flourish in the neighborhood
of Clare, Penwortham, and Donnybrook, was obtained from the Yalumba orchard. The
first wine was made in 1853, in a small cellar, and from the start it was of good quality,
Mr. Smith’s knowledge of fermentation being such that he made no mistake. Ihe


vineyards were again extended to plant several acres in Shiraz, Albilleo, and Frontignac
grapes. As the trade increased, the grapes and cellarage accommodation expanded. But
Mr. Smith’s sphere of operations did not stay in a single groove. He induced people
in the neighborhood to grow grapes, which he purchased from them for wine-making
purposes. \ bus the industry in Angaston practically had its birth, and because of the
enterprise of the Smiths and others, the district is the chief wine producer in the Province.
In later years, when the wines were widely known, the demand increased. Ihe work so
J J
ably begun by the pioneer has been continued and extended by his descendants with
excellent results. There are now 120 acres under grapes, whilst the cellarage
accommodation covers an area of nearly two acres.
Ihe celebrity of the Yalumba Vineyards is not confined to the Province, but
extends over the seas. Hundreds of tons of grapes are bought by the firm annually and
converted into wine, the machinery (worked by steam) being capable of treating 50 tons
of grapes per day. In addition to the wine-making, there are extensive fruit-canning and
jam manufacturing plants at Yalumba, which manipulate a considerable quantity of fruit
every year. Ihe Yalumba wines are held in high esteem, and for the last 30 years have
carried off gold medals at Bordeaux, Paris, Antwerp, Calcutta, Melbourne, Hobart, and
Brisbane ; besides numerous silver medals and champion cups. A leading connoisseur,
speaking of Yalumba wines, said, “They are a credit to the maker, and an honor to the
Colony.”
Mr. Samuel Smith died in 1888, and he was succeeded in the business by his
son, Sidney, who since boyhood had taken a most active and intelligent interest in the
fortunes of Yalumba. Mr. Samuel Smith was a man of unsullied honor, and was respected
throughout South Australia. P'or many years he was superintendent of the Angaston
Congregational Sunday-school, and he won the earnest respect of hundreds of boys and
girls, since scattered in different parts of South Australia, who do not forget the kindly
face, the homely teachings, and the Christian example of this indefatigable pioneer.
Mr. Sidney Smith, head of the Yalumba proprietary firm of Messrs. S. Smith
and Sons, was born at Wareham, Dorsetshire, England, in March, 1837. He came to
South Australia with his father in 1847- and of that period he retains a very vivid
remembrance, few people in the Province equalling him in this respect. The appearance of
the towns, the condition of the country as it was being slowly tamed, and the circumstances
of development, are still bright in his mind. He can tell many stories of droll or pathetic
interest relating to the “forties” and “fifties” of South Australian history, and by-gone
periods on the outer stations, in rounding-up cattle and minding sheep among men of
whimsical character and wild adventure. He was nurtured in the Australian bush, and,
with all his predisposition to humor, there is in his character a strain of the melancholy
which comes from such rural associations and from an acquaintance with the strange men
of youthful promise and wrecked lives who gathered together on the earlier sheep-stations
and cattle-runs. From his boyhood Mr. Sidney Smith identified himself with his father’s
interests, and gradually acquired the knowledge of grape production and wine-making
which, in after-life, fitted him to succeed so worthy a forerunner. He eventually became
a partner in the business, and, on his father’s death, took charge of the estate.


Mr. Sidney Smith was married in 1862. For several years he has been
chairman of the Angaston District Council, and was associated with the volunteer
movement. His sons, who render him the best of help, are Mr. Percival
Smith, a committee-man of the Winegrowers’ Association of South Australia, who makes
the wine and manages the cellars at Yalumba; Mr. Fred. C. Smith, who resides at
Angaston, and has earned the gratitude of the Province by introducing the spraying system
for the destruction of fungi pests ; Mr. Sidney Osborne Smith, who looks after the canning
establishment at Yalumba ; and Mr. Walter Grandy Smith, who manages the Adelaide
branch of the firm, and travels in its interests through the East and New Zealand. The
youngest member of the family is Mr. Archibald Smith, who is a student in the Roseworthy
Agricultural College.
The residence at Yalumba is one of the prettiest in the Province. Situated in
one of the most charming country districts in Australia, it is surrounded by gardens rich
in flowers and fruits, and by lightly-wooded hills.
The late Dr. Horatio Thomas Whittell, M.R.C.S., iM.D.
THE late popular Coroner and Chairman of the Central Board of Health, was born at
Warwick, England, in 1826, and was educated at a private school in Leamington
until 1845, when he was entered at Queen’s College, Birmingham. Pursuing the
study of medicine, he gained his diploma as member of the Royal College of Surgeons,
and became House Surgeon at Queen’s Hospital, Birmingham. After his hospital
experience, the young medical man practised in the same city, and continued there for some
10 years, during which he obtained the M.D. degree at Aberdeen. He then left for
Australia, and about the year iB6O arrived in Adelaide. He practised in the capital alone
for some time, and then entered into partnership with the late Dr. W. Gosse. In 1879,
Dr. Whittell took Dr. J. D. Thomas as a partner, and after some time, sold his share in
the practice to that gentleman, and proceeded to Europe and Great Britain to recruit his
health. He remained away from South Australia for two and a half years, durino- which
✓ J ’ o
he made a close study of new medical problems. He lent himself specially to research in
bacteriology, and upon his return to Adelaide, he set up a well-equipped bacteriological
laboratory on East Terrace. He was appointed President of the Central Board of Health
in 1883; and in 1888 he became City Coroner, Vaccination Officer, and Inspector of
Anatomy. Dr. Whittell was a member of the Board of Management of the Adelaide
Hospital ; he was also Honorary Surgeon, and afterwards Senior Consulting Physician to
that institution. He was Examiner in Hygiene at the University of Adelaide, and was a
member of the Council in the days when it was constituted on the nominee principle. He
was one of the founders and an ex-president of the Microscopical Section of the Royal
Society of South Australia. P'or a brief period he was Registrar of Births, Marriages, and
Deaths. He was Chairman of the South Australian branch of the A. M. P. Society, and
in the P'reemasons, was a P.D.G.M. of the Grand Lodge of South Australia. Dr. Whittell
died on August 21, 1899, at the age of 73, shortly after resigning his important public offices.

Mr. Edward Spicer
MR. EDWARD SPICER retains a vivid recollection of what took place in South
Australia in 1838 and in the grey old years which have piled upon each other
his venerable career. He was born in London on January 1, 1817 —not two
years after Waterloo —and in earlv manhood came to the new Province of South Australia
to devote his bodily vigor and
mental energy to the furtherance
of British colonisation. He arrived
at Port Adelaide in 1838, with
the express object of entering into
pastoral pursuits. At this time
the early pastoralists of New South
Wales had brought Australia into
slight fame by proving the adapta-
bility of its grassy stretches to
sheep-breeding; and Mr. Spicer
believed that there would be little
difficulty in inaugurating such an
industry in the recently - formed
and well-advertised Province of
South Australia. But his first
experiences were not encouraging,
for immediately upon his arrival
he learnt that to obtain a nucleus
for his docks he would have to
pay from £2 to £3 P er head for
sheep landed at Holdfast Bay
from Tasmania. It would have
required a fortune to make any
beginning under such circum-
stances. With hopes slightly
diminished, he proceeded to
Adelaide—a cluster of a few rude
huts and tents—and erected, on a piece of land for which he paid £2O, a two-roomed
tenement, at the west end of where Currie Street now stands. Even the building of
such a modest residence as this was fraught with considerable difficulty, and, to obtain
water from the Torrens, Mr. Spicer had to draw it in a barrel. The whole of the work
was done by himself, and the total cost of land and materials was £4O. This dwelling
was used principally as a central residence. He did not, however, relinquish his intention
to start sheep-farming, but soon after sold his cottage, and settled on land four miles
bom town (now called Edwardstown) the whole of the country from the Cemetery to
the Stmt being then unoccupied and available as a sheep-run. In 1839 he and five


others went to Sydney, and purchased sheep at £i per head. To get to the capital
of New South Wales unhampered with stock was difficult enough ; but to travel sheep
over this immense territory entailed vicissitudes of which people to-day can have no
comprehension.
Readers of Mr. Simpson Newland’s excellent Australian novel, “ Paving the Way,”
will remember the stirring and romantic stories he tells of these overland trips, of dangers
from thirst and from the dreaded attacks by the aboriginal inhabitants near the banks of
the rivers. Mr. Spicer and his party had similar experiences. 'The track chosen by them
was by way of the Murrumbidgee and the Murray, and along it they pursued a lonely
and secluded journey of six months’ duration, arriving at the north-west bend of the Murray
in January, 1840. For months they needs must be on the alert against surprises by the
blacks, or exercise fine generalship to safely cover the long dry stretches. After leaving
the Murray, the worst trials began. Two or three days of fierce hot winds endangered
J’o J o
their position, and rendered it impossible to get the sheep in full wool to travel at all ; and
when these little quadrupeds do not want to budge, it requires more than human persuasion
to force them. There was no water between the Murray and the hills—about 30 miles.
The heat was so great, and their thirst so intense, that the men began to kill the sheep
in order to drink their blood ; and it was resolved to send the drays carrying the provisions
and water for the men on ahead to search for a supply. 1 hose who were left behind-
among whom was Mr. Spicer —suffered keenly. Ihe vehicles did not return as early as
was expected, and their anguish from thirst was so acute that they determined to abandon
the dock. Thev trailed along the track of the dray, and walked until they were overcome.
-OJ ’ '
At night they were still without water, but the coolness it brought served to slightly lessen
their pain. Next morning they again set forth ; and so severe had been Mr. Spicer’s
suffering that his eyesight was impaired, and he took the wrong track. He plodded on
with all his senses centred on the desire for water, and fortunately met two of his men,
who told him that he was going back. Kneeling down, he examined the bullocks’ tracks,
and found that the men were right ; and he at once turned round. After an hour’s walking
he was delighted to see the drays coming towards him; and when he found that they
carried a good supply of water, the reaction was so severe that he collapsed and fell
down, although before that he felt able to walk for miles. Within half an hour came a
violent thunderstorm, with torrents of rain flooding the whole country, and the danger
from want of water was abated.
The party then went in search of the sheep, and discovered that their instinct
had saved their lives, for they had made straight back to the north-west bend of the
Murray. The successful issue from the perilous situation caused deep thankfulness. On
gathering the sheep together, they were found to be about 600 short. Many had been
killed by the blacks, and their carcases were found lying on trunks of trees, ready to be
eaten. After several adventures and overcoming obstacles more or less heavy, the party
reached the River Light, where they soon sold 1,000 ewes for £2 a head. The parties
in the transaction divided the remainder among themselves, and Mr. Spicer took his share
over to his run at Edwardstown. Unfortunately for himself, the accession of population
caused the Governor to resume this land and throw it open to farmers for selection. It


was excellently adapted for such a purpose, and the loss was Mr. Spicers while the gain
was the Province’s and the individual farmer’s. Mr. Spicer, however, retains to this day
70 acres of his orioinal holdinof.
/ 00
From Edwardstown he moved his stock to the Willunga Ranges, but six months
later he proceeded to Middleton, half-way between Port PJliot and Goolwa. After three
years, the sheep having outgrown the run, Mr. Spicer once more moved, and drove his
flocks 200 miles to the south-east, where, on the north side of Maria Creek (now called
Kingston), he formed stations. On the south side was Mr. Stirling’s property. I his
run did not turn out to be healthy. The country, to use a pastoral phrase, was “coasty,
and six or eight months was enough to prove to Mr. Spicer that he must look farther
afield for suitable pasture. He now spent some little time on the south bank of the
Murray, and sold all his sheep. While one day riding in the bush at this place he
unexpectedly came upon a camp of about 200 natives surrounding a stage about six feet
high, erected on four posts, on which was the dead body of a woman in a sitting posture,
roasting on a fire. The natives were displeased at the presence of a stranger, and soon
indicated that he had better be off.
In those days, country now settled was practically a great uninhabited territory,
to travel into which required a good deal of courage, demanded very severe labor, and
produced numerous adventures, both exciting and depressing. Mr. Spicer was a pathfinder,
or, better still, was one of those bold and sturdy colonists who paved the way for the
more luxurious men who have since taken up much of the country he surmounted in the
“forties.” He has well earned a holiday.
Mr. Spicer next purchased a run at Port Lincoln called “ Poonindie,” and
stocked it with sheep, He also took up about 150 square miles of country. In 1851
he sold all his station property, and took a holiday tour to England. His subsequent
South Australian career has not been so exciting, albeit that it has been as useful. \\ bile
in England he received news of the gold discoveries in Victoria, an eventuation which
o o
was not anticipated by the vast majority of early Australian colonists. He learned by
letter from his wife that Adelaide was almost deserted of men, Twelve months after
leaving, he returned to South Australia, and became a merchant of Adelaide, and here
the wandering portion of his local experiences came to an end. His enterprise extended
as the Province expanded and the population increased, and in course of years ramified
over a large area. Year after year he passed in successful business. His early importations
were large, and he also did considerable indenting. In 1893 he retired from the business,
which is now carried on by his son (Mr. Edward Henry Spicer) in Adelaide, and by
his brother’s son (Mr. George Spicer) in London.
Mr. Spicer survives to witness the present expanding proportions of a city which
he knew as a group of a few rude huts. A host of memories must arise as he drives
through the well-kept streets lined with large buildings, and not the least pleasing must
be the reflection that he contributed to its uprising. Whether as a wanderer in the
untrodden back country, or as a city merchant, he has been as a father to South
Australia, and none in the Province is more respected and esteemed.

1 he late Rev. George Stonehouse
CJ
PHE work and character ot the late Rev. G. Stonehouse, for many years a pastor in the
I Baptist Church, are enshrined in the memory of old residents of South Australia.
He was ot the school of scholarly ministers, and he put his whole energy into
his task. Ihe Rev. George Stonehouse was born in Kent, England, on July 1, 1808.
He was, so to speak, cradled in
the ministry, for he was third
in a line of Baptist pastors.
His education was imparted at
Newport Pagnell College a
Union College for Baptists and
Independents—where the eminent
Dr. Bull was his tutor. Bor
five years he remained at this
institution, and when 25 or
26 years of age, he received
a call his first—to Middleton
Cheney, Northamptonshire, where
he remained for several years.
His labors in this circuit were
inspired with enthusiasm, and his
influence was so great that 30
years afterwards a few weeks
before he died —he received a
letter from its contemporary pastor
and four deacons, most of whom
were boys under his ministry,
couched in words of kindly
sentiment, concluding with the
following : —“ May we entreat an
interest in your prayers, such as
we believe you have in the
prayers of many who remember
your ministry here, some of whom, though you knew it not while you were with us, are
your spiritual children, and hence cherish your memory with much affection.” Such
expressions, after so long an interval, must have given consolation to the last days of
the aged minister.
From Middleton Cheney Mr. Stonehouse was removed to a larger charge at
Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, where he remained for seven years. In 1841 he was
admitted as a titular member of the African Institute, and received his diploma with
a highly complimentary letter from the then Secretary ot State. His zeal and earnestness


in the great cause gradually impaired his health. There were no half-measures about him,
O O J L
and whatever he applied himself to do he did with his whole might. His conception of
the ministry was of the highest. Weakness of voice and haemorrhage eventually compelled
him to relinquish his charge. Two opportunities were now afforded him. He was invited
to go to India to take charge of a college at Calcutta, but declined. Mr. G. F. Angas,
that enthusiastic helper in all religious work, was desirous of founding an undenominational
college in Adelaide for the training of young men ; and, upon his invitation, Mr. Stonehouse
and his wife came to South Australia, arriving in 1845. It was hoped bv his people
at Chipping Norton that he would soon be able to return to that pastorate, and, as a
consequence, they did not permanently fill the office for 12 months.
Owing to a commercial crisis in England, and to the fact that the Province was
too young for such an institution, Mr. Stonehouse did not establish the projected college.
He opened a large boarding school for boys at Angaston, which he conducted on his own
account for two years, at the same time preaching to a local congregation. He then
received a call from the Baptists at North Adelaide, where soon after, at Lefevre
Terrace, he founded the first Congregational Baptist Church in South Australia, in which
place, for about 19 years, he continued to officiate. It was here that his best work in South
Australia was done. The qualities which made him so successful in the old country were
applied with as much success in this Province, with the advantage that in a young country
the work of such men is bound to more widely affect the destinies of the Church. Pie
was able to increase the power and extend the influence of the denomination, and to
infuse some of his own vigor as a colonist into the work of his brethren. Year after
year he drew his congregation more closely to him, and year after year by precept, and,
better still, by example, he led them towards the higher life. Several years later he
formed the Baptist Church at blinders Street, Adelaide. He was recognised as an
influential minister outside of his denomination, and was associated with numbers of
movements which tend to the improvement of the community. On May 13, 1867, he had
the misfortune to lose his wife, who throughout his married life had been an amiable and
affectionate helpmate. “The Baptist Magazine” (January, 1868), referring to her long
illness and estimable character, said :—“ Her faith never wavered, her submission seemed
entire —not a single repining word was ever heard from her lips.”
Thenceforth the health of Mr. Stonehouse declined. Two years after his
bereavement, failing health caused him to retire from the ministry, especially because his
voice had become exceedingly weak. The Rev. J. L. Parsons succeeded him at Lefevre
Terrace, and, “through the generous help of Mr. G. F. Angas, the beginnings of a Baptist
College were started in Adelaide, over which Mr. Stonehouse was appointed resident
tutor.” This position he held up to the time of his death, which occurred on July
24, 1871, from acute bronchitis. The obituaries published in several newspapers praised,
in glowing language, the splendid work and life of the deceased, and funeral sermons
testifying to the greatness of his mission were preached not only in South Australia, but
also in far-away Middleton Cheney. The Church had just previously removed to new
buildings in Tynte Street, and on Wednesday, July 26, 1871, the funeral service was held
there, the church being draped in black cloth. The coffin, covered with beautiful


white flowers, was placed in front of the platform ; and the organist played the Dead
March in “Saul. Ihe Rev. J. L. Parsons conducted the service, the preliminary parts
being taken by the Revs. S. Mead (Baptist), James Lyall (Presbyterian), and ]. G.
Millard (Wesleyan), alter which an address was delivered by the Rev. Charles Manthorpe,
a highly valued friend of the deceased. In the course of his remarks, Mr. Manthorpe
said of Mr. Stonehouse: “ I think we are justified in thanking God for his consistent
and blameless lile. For more than 25 years he has gone in and out amongst us in this
land, and 1 have never once heard, in any way, a word disparaging his life, character,
or ministry.” The body was then conveyed to the North Road Cemeterv, where the
JJJ J ’
Church of England service was read by Dean Russell, who afterwards delivered an
appreciative address, during which he declared that all standing by the graveside would
say, “This was a good man.” On the following Sunday funeral sermons were delivered in
the late gentleman’s old church by Dr. lefferis and the Rev. J. L. Parsons.
To describe the Rev. George Stonehouse, we take the words of the Right Hon.
Sir S. (. Way, in a speech delivered during the Jubilee Services in connection with the
North Adelaide Baptist Church, May 11, 1898. Coming 27 years after his death, they serve to
illustrate the durability of the rev. gentleman’s ministry. The Chief Justice said: —“l
came to the Colony early in 1853, and it was my privilege to make the acquaintance of
the Rev. George Stonehouse, a cultured minister of the old school, with a keen, well-cut,
intellectual face, of benignant manners, and a catholicity of spirit which everyone who knew
him admired. The could not measure the value of the services which this man rendered
to the Church, nor could they sufficiently revere his memory. His had been a sweet
influence, which had lasted long beyond the term in which he officially served the Church,
and lon£ beyond his own life, and it would be a beneficent service for many years to come.”
Mr. Albert Henry Landseer
IV \ R. ALBERT HENRY LANDSEER is a member of an English family of high
reputation. His father, the late Mr. Henry Landseer, served in the Peninsular
War; his uncle, Mr. John Landseer, was engraver to the King; and his cousin
was the famous painter, Sir Edwin Landseer. Mr. Landseer was born in London on
February iB, 1829. After leaving school, he served for seven years under Matthew Johnson,
a sculptor. In 1848 he came to South Australia, and remained until the Victorian goldfields
began to attract adventurous spirits from all parts. Mr. Landseer joined the eager gold-
seeking throng, and was fairly fortunate. After his third journey to Victoria he returned
to South Australia, and opened in business at Port Elliot. Thence, in iB6O, he removed
to Milang. From 1875 to 1899 Mr. Landseer represented Mount Barker in the House
of Assembly; on five occasions being returned at the head of the poll. Mr. Landseer
has ever been an earnest and uncompromising supporter of liberal legislation. He sat on
the Murray Waters and several other Commissions, and is familiar with a considerable
portion of the important part of the history of South Australian legislation. In a quiet and
unobtrusive way Mr. Landseer has left the impress of his mind on our laws, and has
conscientiously served the best interests ol the Province.

Mr. William Strawbridge
BRISTOL, England, was the birthplace of Mr. William Strawbridge in 1843. He
came to South Australia in 1852. On June 1, 1862, he entered the Survey
Department as a cadet, and gradually rose in the estimation of his brother-officers
and in the service. In April, 1877, he became Chief Draughtsman, and in 1884-5 w;is
Acting Deputy Surveyor-General.
On July 1, 1886, he was appointed
Deputy Surveyor - General. In
this capacity he was called upon
to perform important duties, and
took a very substantial part in the
management of the Lands Depart-
ment. Upon the retirement of
Mr. G. W. Goyder, C.M.G., in
July, 1894, he became Surveyor-
General. He is an excellent
successor of the excellent men
who preceded him. He has a
most intimate knowledge of the
resources of South Australia, and
has travelled the length and
breadth of the land in official
capacities. It is highly necessary
that such an officer should possess
not only a close acquaintanceship
with the land laws of the Province,
but a knowledge of the whole
territory that he administrates.
This Mr. Strawbridge may be
said to have, He was Chairman,
in 1887, of the first Land Board
which sat in South Australia, and
was also for several years Chairman
of the Western, Northern, and Midland Land Boards. Lie has been Chairman of the Pastoral
Board since first appointment in 1893, and in the exercise of his duties with these bodies gained
considerable experience in land values. As an evidence of the extraordinary confidence in
his justice and judgment, the Legislature recently passed an Act allowing any Crown lessee
to apply to him for reduction in rent or purchase-money, and to fix rentals on all surrenders
for perpetual leases. Many thousands of leases have been dealt with by him. He is Chairman
of the Board of Examiners for Licensed Surveyors, Past-President of the South Australian
Institute of Surveyors, and has been President of the Public Service Association. He is a
justice of the Peace, and is very highly esteemed in South Australia.

The late Mr. Robert Stuckev
SOI 7 I H AUSTRALIA was but two years old when the late Mr. Robert Stuckey cast
in his lot in the good cause of colonisation. He was spared to live many years,
and saw the Province take immense strides. To Mr. Stuckey fell a share of the
vicissitudes inseparable from pioneering work. He was born at Muchelney Abbey, a famous
old building in Somersetshire, on
September 9, 1812. When he
was five years old his father died,
and Mr. Stuckey was taken in
hand by an uncle until he had
reached years of maturity. He
married in 1839, and immediately
set out for South Australia,
where he arrived in December of
that year. His brother, Mr. John
Stuckey, had preceded him, so that
he was not altogether a stranger
in a strano-e land. Mr. Stuckey
o J
took up his residence in Gilbert
Street, and, deciding to embark
in active business pursuits, opened
a shop in Rundle Street as a
grocer and draper combined. For
nine years he was in business in
Rundle Street, and his venture
was a financial success. He sold
out to Messrs. Parkin, Chinner,
Martin, and Bakewell. After
leaving Rundle Street, which
upon his advent he described as
a “ succession of mudholes in
which bullocks were frequently
bogged,” Mr. Stuckey entered
into partnership with Mr. P. D. Prankerd in land speculation. Mr. Prankerd retired in
1872, and went to England, but Mr. Stuckey continued in the same business until his
last illness, the executors of the estate being Dr. W. M. Campbell and Messrs, J. J. and
M. Stuckey. In his land investments Mr. Stuckey rendered considerable help to
struggling farmers. He enabled them to occupy and develop the land at a small deposit,
and eventually to become the proprietors of it.
Until 1858 Mr. Stuckey lived in Gilbert Street; after which he purchased a
very fine property on Montefiore Hill, adjoining the residence of the Chief Justice, the


Right Hon. Sir S. I. Way, Bart. Mr. Stuckey was largely interested in commercial
OJJ ' j *
matters in the Province, and early invested in the copper-mining industry. He was for
many years a director of the Wallaroo and Moonta Copper Mines, of the Hamley Mine,
and of the South Australian Mining Association (better known as the Burra Burra Mine),
and continued in those positions until his death. At one time he held a proprietary interest
in the Adelaide Advertiser. He was a trustee of the Port Land Company, and was
one of its founders; and was also a trustee of the Cottage Homes, North Adelaide.
A prominent man in religious circles, Mr. Stuckey was, during all his local
history, associated with the Congregational denomination in Adelaide. He was identified
J ' OO
with the first ConcrreQ'ational Church on North 1 errace, afterwards with the late Rev.
o o
T. O. Stow’s Church in Freeman Street, and more recently with the Stow Memorial Church,
of which he was a deacon, and also treasurer, at the time ot his death. He was frequently
selected as trustee by the various Congregational Churches throughout the Province.
JOO < *
Mr. Stuckey died on Monday, September 6, 1897. at ie r 'P e a g e °f 85 years;
and thus ended a life which had in every way been well spent.
Professor John William Salmond, M A., LL.B.
N' ORTH SHIELDS, England, was the birthplace of Professor Salmond, in the year
1862. In his boyhood he went to New Zealand, and received his general
education at the University of that Colony, obtaining his degree of Master of Arts
j j no
in 1882. Up to this time he had made no special study of law; but he now proceeded
to England to obtain a legal training and qualify for practising at the Bar. Entering at
University College, London, he devoted himself earnestly and exclusively to the study of
law, under the direction of the highly qualified instructors of that famous academy of
learning, with such success that he obtained his degree of Batchelor ot Laws in
1887. Thus qualified, he returned to New Zealand, where he was admitted to the Bar;
and for the next 10 years practised his profession with success in the Island Colony.
During this part of his career he published two legal works, “ Essays in Jurisprudence
and Legal History,” and “ First Principles of Jurisprudence,” which attracted attention in
legal circles, and were generally recognised as able expositions ot the subjects of which they
treated. Haxing thus gained a reputation for high legal knowledge, which spread beyond
the confines of New Zealand, Mr. Salmond was, in 1897, appointed Professor ot Law in
the University of Adelaide, the post he now holds; and his work in this new sphere has
been highly appreciated from the beginning. The Adelaide University confers degrees in
law (LL.B.), which are recognised, ad eundem, beyond the boarders ot South Australia;
and it also grants certificates of admission to the Bar of this State, the Examining Board
consisting: of its own Professors, acting: with outside examiners of high legal standing. It
o o 000
will be thus seen that in imparting instruction to students of law, Professor Salmond fulfils
most responsible academic duties. It may be added that he is a frequent contributor to
the “ Law Quarterly Review,” a standard English legal publication.

I he late Mr. William Robert Swan
ARRIVING in South Australia when pastoral pursuits were confined to the Middle
North, Central, and Port Lincoln Districts of the Province, the late Mr. \V. R. Swan
became one of the most energetic followers of the industry in the remote areas.
His acres and stock were not confined to one Colony, nor to a square mile or two of
country. He was born in
Northumberland, England, in
1821, and came to South Aus-
tralia in 1847.
Mr. Swan was engaged
by Mr. }. H. Angas, and
subsequently became manager for
Mr. Price Maurice, of the Port
Lincoln and Pekina Stations.
After this he travelled through
the unsettled country, and ex-
perienced quite a number of
dangers and vicissitudes. In one
instance, with two servants, he
encountered a native tribe, who
knew nothing of the white people
and their ways. The ignorant
j o
blacks might be accused of
imagining that the Centaurs had
settled in Australia, for they
believed Mr. Swan and the horse
on which he was mounted were
one. Their astonishment and
consternation were great when
he dismounted. He narrowly
escaped being murdered on
another occasion : he was at-
tacked by two blacks, and while one clung on his back, the other belabored him with a stick.
During these experiences Mr. Swan acquired considerable knowledge of South
Australian country, and also of the management of stock. He purchased Warungla Station,
and soon became an extensive pastoralist. Although he experienced severe ie\eises, he pioved
so excellent a manager, and so discreet a judge of country and sheep and investments,
that he got to be one of the principal followers of the industry in South Australia. \\ ith
Mr. R. Barr Smith he acquired the bowler Bay run, and conducted it until it was
resumed by the Government and cut up into agricultural areas. With the same gentleman,
K K


the late Sir Thomas Elder, and Mr. f. Fisher, he was interested in large properties on
the Darling, New South Wales; and, also, with the late Sir Thomas Elder and Mr. R. Barr
Smith, in sheep and cattle stations in Queensland. All these investments, extending to
th ree colonies, enabled Mr. Swan to aid considerably in the development of the back
country. It is for his work in this respect that he will be longest remembered.
Mr. Swan occupied positions of importance and influence in the commercial world
of South Australia. He was a large shareholder in Elder, Smith, & Co., director of the
Mortgage Company of South Australia, and local director of the Commercial Union
Assurance Company. His shrewdness and judgment were useful to all these institutions.
He was for many years a Justice of the Peace.
Mr. S wan reached the age of 72 years, and died on June 13, 1892. His illness
lasted for five months, and was borne with that stoicism that distinguished his whole
career. Mrs. Swan, his estimable wife, had returned with her only daughter, from a visit
to England, a few weeks before. The funeral of Mr. Swan was attended by many
influential people, who testified the respect they had for a man of superior worth, both
in talent and in conduct.
Professor William Henry Bragg, M.A., M.I.E.E.
TH K town of Wigton, in Cumberland, England, was the birthplace of Professor Bragg;
and he obtained his early education at Market Harborough Grammar School, and Kintr
\\ illiam College, Isle of Man, winning scholarships at both these educational
establishments. In 1880 he won a Minor Exhibition at Trinity College, Cambridge, and
in 1882 a Maj or Scholarship. At Cambridge he studied Mathematics under Dr. Routh,
the famous instructor in that branch of mental athletics, and was placed Third Wrangler
in 1884. He obtained a hirst-class in the succeeding examination for the second part of the
Mathematical I ripos. After a year spent in teaching at Cambridge and studying in the Caven-
dish Laboratory, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics in the University of Adelaide.
Professor Bragg is a member oi the University Council, of the Board of Governors of
the Public Library, and of the Council of the School of Mines. He is also President of
the 1 eachers Guild, and a member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers. He took an
active part in bringing about the present arrangement, made a year or so ago, by which
the I niversity undertakes the training of teachers for the State Schools. During his long
connection with the Adelaide University, a large number of students have passed through
his hands. It may be mentioned, as exemplifying the growth of the University, that when
Professor Bragg assumed his present office some 1 5 years ago, there were only two students
in the laboratory, whereas there are now over 200. This large increase of the alumni has
necessitated commensurate extensions and alterations from time to time ; and additions
have been made at the rear of the University building, which will give further room
for developments in the departments under Professor Bragg’s charge. In 1889 Professor
Bragg became the son-in-law of Sir Charles Todd, Postmaster-General of South Australia.

The late Mr. William Thomas
IN the south-western corner of England, where the natural ruggedness of the surroundings
is enhanced by the presence of the stormy Atlantic, has survived a branch of one of
the world’s oldest races, a people whose earlier history is enveloped in mystery and
romance, and whose later feats, performed mostly upon the perilous seas, have enriched
English story and poem, and
have largely contributed to the
greatness of a maritime power,
to which the recorded past fur-
nishes no parallel. A mining
industry, which has for a period
of 2,000 years or more yielded
J J
wealth to the hand of man, has
equipped the Cornish than with a
knowledge and practical skill that
makes him welcome in all new
countries where mining operations
are contemplated or are in pro-
gress. Thus it is that a large
o
Cornish element is found in the
population of South Australia.
It is worthy of note also that
the energy and the ambition of
o J
Cornishmen have found for them
prominence in colonial public
affairs and commercial life.
The late Mr. William Thomas,
miller, of Port Adelaide, was a
typical representative of this in-
teresting race. He was born at
St. just, West Penzance, Corn-
wall, in 1838; and his early years
were spent in that famous and romantic portion of his native county. He was the only surviving
child of Mr. William Thomas, of Trewellard, who sought fortune in the colonies in the
days of the gold rush, and found it. His education was obtained at private schools; and
at its completion he began the more serious business of his life in the mines which flourish
in the district. The late Mr. Thomas was possessed of talents and energy that at an
early age brought him into prominence in the occupation to which he had set his hands.
Thus when quite a young man (in his “twenties”) he had mastered not only the
*■ J 1 J
practical skill necessary to mining pursuits, but also the technical knowledge, which
qualified him for a post of command. The fame of the mining fields in Australia reached
K K 2


his Cornish home, and the ambitions of the young miner became directed to the opportunities
afforded to men of skill and training in this Province. Armed with guarantees of qualification
and competence as a miner, he set sail, in his twenty-eighth year, for Port Adelaide,
arriving there in the ship Peeress in 1865.
Soon after reaching: South Australia, however, Mr. Thomas’s original intention of
O ’ ’ o
following the mining industry was abandoned, other opportunities for advancement in the
young Province offering themselves. Accordingly, he became associated with the well-known
milling and wheat-buying business conducted by Messrs. John Dunn & Co. His energy,
industry, and business abilities soon attracted the notice of his employers, and he was
given the management of the office in the business at Port Adelaide, where the chief
trade centred. He retained that position for many years, conducting it to the high
satisfaction of his employers, and to the material advancement of the industry. In 1878
Mr. Thomas resigned his post with Messrs. Dunn & Co., having decided to commence
business for himself in partnership with his old schoolmate, shipmate, and brother-in-law,
Mr. Thomas Grose. He proceeded accordingly in that year to Fhigland, accompanied by
his son, Mr. Henry Thomas, and Mr. Grose. Some months were spent in the old country
in obtaining considerable insight into matters connected with the milling trade, and in
purchasing a plant with which the partners subsequently started their business in Leadenhall
Street, Port Adelaide, trading in the name of William Thomas & Co. Although the
industry was conducted at first on a small scale, the trade soon grew under competent
management, and in 1887 new premises were erected, a new plant obtained, and the
present improved roller-mills made their appearance. From time to time the firm has
watched the progress of roller-milling machinery, and has frequently added the latest
inventions in order that the high reputation of its “Standard Roller” P'lour might be
maintained. In spite ot bad seasons and other unfavorable circumstances, the business thus
established continued to flourish; and at his death in 1891, Mr. William Thomas closed
a career which had resulted in financial success, and had throughout been characterised by
integrity and ability.
The pioneer who fights in the forefront of colonisation, builds up industries, and
clears the way for his successors, is seldom able to spare time for public matters ; and
Mr. I homas was compelled to limit his exertions in the public interest. Yet his private
moments were not all devoted to the quiet rest and enjoyment to which he might justly
have felt himself entitled, but were given to the sacred cause of religion, and to the
generous support of philanthropy. From earliest boyhood he was associated with the
Wesleyan Methodist Church, and much interested in Sunday-school work. Before he had
reached his majority we find he was entrusted with the superintendency of a school of
over 400 children, and he maintained amongst them a kind but firm discipline that
characterised his own actions throughout his after life. He became a local preacher in connec-
tion with the Port Adelaide Circuit shortly after he entered the Province, and maintained his
position until failing health compelled him to retire shortly before his decease. His
sermons bore evidence of much study and strong religious zeal, to which he added a
practical sympathy, which took the form of liberal financial support. He had his social
recommendations also, and was widely revered as a cheery, courteous, intelligent, and
benevolent gentleman.

Mr. Henry Thomas
I T is gratifying to find, in the history of so young a Province as South Australia, the
sound old British traits appearing in Southern seas. Important though pioneer work
may be, it is productive of little unless it is maintained and extended in subsequent
effort by the young native-born population. To the credit of the latter, it has to be said
that they have not fallen short of
the example and traditions of
their fathers ; and the rapidity
with which they have assumed the
lead in politics and commerce is
decidedlv satisfactory.
J J
An example of the successful
young Australian is furnished in
the person of Mr. Henry Thomas,
who has for some years been at
the head of the large milling busi-
ness established by his father, the
late Mr. William Thomas (whose
deeds are also recorded in these
pages), and Mr. Thomas Grose.
Mr. Henry Thomas was born at
Port Adelaide on July 12, 1866, a
year after the arrival of his parents
in this Province, and almost the
whole of his career has been
identified with that district. Mr.
Thomas accompanied his father
on a trip to England in 1878, and,
on his return to Adelaide, com-
pleted his education at Prince
Alfred College. A commercial
o
career was chosen for him, and he
entered the Commercial Bank of South Australia in 1882. The young bank clerk showed
aptitude for the work, and rose step by step until he attained the position of accountant
J.
at Port Adelaide when he had been about four years in the institution, having previously
been manager of less important branches. About this time the Commercial Bank of South
Australia failed, and the services of Mr. Thomas were sought by the Commercial Bank
of Australia. In this institution he remained for several years, winning the commendation
of his superior officers. In 1891 the failing health of his father demanded the presence
of the son in the milling business at Port Adelaide, which Mr. I homas, sen., had
established and carried on in partnership with Mr. Thomas Grose. Mr. Henry Thomas


had then attained the post of assistant accountant in the Adelaide office of the Commercial
Bank of Australia, but he resigned that position and joined his father.
On the death of Mr. William Thomas, sen., which occurred a few months later,
the son stepped into his place in the partnership. The milling business with which he
thus became associated had a history of rapid progress behind it. Established on a limited
scale in Leadenhall Street, Port Adelaide, in the year 1879, it so flourished and expanded
that in 1887 the partners found it necessary to erect new premises and purchase new
plant, with the result that the present roller-mills were erected. The facilities devised in
connection with the mills to expedite delivery of wheat and flour are almost unique in the
Province. Besides having railway connection from the mills with all parts of the Province,
Messrs. Thomas & Co. are well equipped for maritime dispatch. A canal, connecting
with the Port River, has been excavated to the premises, giving facilities for loading and
unloading the lighters, which come right up to the mill-doors. Their mills are capable of
an outturn of 3.000 sacks per week, but even at this rate they have had the utmost
difficulty in keeping pace with the orders for the well-known “Standard Roller Brand.
They have shipped several thousands of tons to Africa since the Twentieth Century
began, and are working their mills day and night continuously, Sundays excepted, to
supply their customers. In almost every port in Queensland and Western Australia their
flour has established itself, and regular shipments are made to Java, Ceylon, and Fiji, the
flour being especially adapted for trying climates.
Although Mr. Thomas has been an extremely busy man for many years, he has
o j j j j y
played a useful part in a modest way in those matters which call for the private efforts
of citizenship. P'or some years he was Secretary of the Australian Natives’ Association.
He has also been a member of committee of the Port Adelaide Institute for several years,
and has followed the example of his father in his liberal support to the Wesleyan Church,
of which he is a member. He has been Chairman of the Corn Trade Section in the
Adelaide Chamber of Commerce, and was recently elected President of the Millowners’
Association of South Australia. Mr. Thomas is possessed of a generous heart and a ready
purse, and his name is known for charity throughout the district.
Mr. Thomas was united in marriage in 1899 with Miss Davey, elder daughter
of Mr. Edwin Davey, founder of the well-known firm of Messrs. E. Davey & Sons,
flourmill owners in South Australia, and Sydney, New South Wales.
Professor Archibald Watson, M.13., F.R.C.S., etc.
A I New South Wales, was the birthplace in 1850 of Professor A. Watson. He
X Studied medicine in the large continental schools under such noted masters as Hente,
Krausse, Meissner, Von Brunn, Kohler, Weber, Pappez, Faraheuf, Charcot, and Drola.
He passed through the London Hospital, Charing Cross Hospital, and Moorfields High
Hospital. Having taken the M.D. and E.R.C.S. degrees, he became Demonstrator of
Anatomy at the Charing Cross Medical School, and in 1885 Elder Professor of Anatomy
at the University of Adelaide, Lecturer on Pathological Anatomy, and Teacher of Operative
Surgery. In 1900 he rendered much surgical service to the wounded in South Africa.

AS remarked elsewhere, one of the most pleasant features in the eventful history of the
South Australian Register consists in the maintenance of the hereditary principle
in the proprietary. The character of a newspaper is necessarily greatly influenced by
those associated with it. Indeed, it may be said to reflect the personality and intellectuality of
its conductors, and the Register
owes no small share of the high
tone which it has always main-
tained to the presence in its
management during the greater
o 00
part of its career of representatives
of a family of sterling worth and
great and tried ability.
o J
Mr. Robert Kyfifin Thomas
is the eldest surviving son of the
late Mr. W. Kyfifin Thomas, and
grandson of the founder of the

Nailsworth, Adelaide, and
attended the Adelaide Educa-
tional Institute, presided over by
the late Mr. John L. Young.
Leaving school in 1868, he went
direct to the Register , with the
object of acquiring experience in
both printing and literary work.
He entered upon his train-
ing in the printing depart-
ment, and subsequently applied
himself to gaining a knowledge
OO O
of the literary branches. Even-
tually he devoted himself wholly to reporting work, and in due course took a seat in the
Parliamentary Gallery He became leader of the reporting staff, and had charge of the
J J
“Hansard” work until he left this department in 1882.
In 1887, upon the death of Mr. Andrews, he was admitted to the proprietary,
and his previous general training admirably fitted him for the duties incidental to the
production of a large newspaper. Shortly after entering into partnership he assumed an
active part in the supervision of the business, and particularly applied his energies to the
enlargement and direction of the Adelaide Observer , the weekly journal issued from the


Register office. In 1882 he relinquished reporting for the absorbing claims of management,
and whilst one of the three partners, Mr. Day, was absent in England he had charge
of the commercial work of the office. On the retirement of Mr. Day from the firm in
1890, Mr. I homas took over the permanent control of the business affairs of the partnership,
Mr. Pinlayson retaining the oversight of the literary department. This arrangement of duties
was a happy one, and was eminently successful. In 1899 the firm was extended by the
admission into partnership of Mr. William J. Sowden and Mr. Evan Kyffin Thomas, the
younger brother of the subject of this notice, Mr. Sowden taking the position of editor in
succession to Mr. Pinlayson, who is representing the Register and its allied papers in
London. Ihe firm has recently introduced improved machinery, notably a magnificent three
reel Hoe machine, capable of printing 24,000 twelve-page papers an hour, and has
equipped the office with the linotype, a modern invention that has, to a great extent,
revolutionised newspaper production. Ihe relations between the proprietary and staff are
most cordial, and the general management has proved so satisfactory, that it may safely
be said that the Register is in a stronger position now than in any previous period of
its career.
Mr. I homas is highly esteemed among all who know him for his geniality,
straightforwardness, and shrewdness, and among business men in South Australia he holds
a high and honorable position. In 1888 he was made a Justice of the Peace. He is a
PTeemason, and in 1898 was Worshipful Master of the Lodge St. Alban of Adelaide.
His two elder sons are engaged in the office of the papers of which he is a proprietor.
Ihe late Mr. William Everard
IN December, 1819, Mr. William Everard was born in London, and came to South
Australia in 1836. Ihe father, the late Dr. Everard, was one of the original 18 Legislative
Councillors elected on the establishment of responsible government. Lor many years
Mr. William Everard and his brother, Mr. Charles J. Everard, worked Myponga Station.
Eor nearly 20 years Mr. W. Everard was a director of the National Bank ; also of the Executor,
Trustee, and Agency Company, and was largely interested in the Payneham and Paradise
and Goodwood Tramway Companies. He was a member of the Council of the Adelaide
University from its commencement, and was a long time one of the Board of Governors
of the Public Library, Art Gallery, and Museum. In 1865, and until his death, he was
one of the governors of the Botanic Gardens. Dr. Everard had 12 years of political life,
and his son William followed in his footsteps, entering the House of Assembly in March.
1865, as member for Encounter Bay, being again returned at the general election in 1868.
Though elected again in December, [B7l, he was unseated in February, 1872, on a petition,
by the Court of Disputed Returns. Fourteen months later, however, he was elected to
the Legislative Council, when the Province voted as one constituency, and retired from
active politics on August 1, 1878. Mr. Everard was Commissioner of Public Works in the
Hart Ministry from September 24 to October 13, 1868; Commissioner of Crown Lands and
Immigration in the Blyth Ministry from July 22, 1873. to June 3, 1875; and Minister of
Education in Mr. Boucaut’s reconstructed Ministry of March, 1876. Mr. Everard died
in August, 1889, at his home, Ashford, Bay Road.

Mr. Henry William Thompson
Al‘ I‘AX years of seafaring- seem to supply an excellent training for colonial occupations
in general. Ihe young fellow with eyes to see, and ears to hear, and mind to
reflect and arrange and discriminate, who voyages to various countries, acquires a
knowledge and a training that is apt to prove very useful to him in after life. The
buffets with which he meets in these
journeyings to and fro and up and
down the earth may also be said to
give him a sensible, mental, and moral
balance. This theme has been well
worked out in many nautical novels,
and examples of its being true to
life are frequently to be observed.
Mr. Thompson, a respected citizen
of Port Adelaide, comes within the
category.
O J
Mr. Henry William Thompson
was born at Rotherhithe, on the
Thames. England, on March 2, 1839.
He was educated at Wick Hall
College, Hackney, and there won the
silver medal at Christmas, 1852. While
yet young, he decided to take to the
sea; and for several years he roved the
oceans, a type of the smart, intelligent,
British sailor. He was for some time
engaged in the West Indies mail
service, and also in the transport
service. In 1854 he volunteered
into the navy, and joined the Black
Sea fleet on board H.M.S. Queen ,
lying in the Bosphorus at the time
of the Crimean War. After the cessation of hostilities, he returned to the mercantile
marine, and voyaged to and fro, learning many things. In iB6O he arrived in South
Australia as second mate of the New Margaret , and served in the intercolonial trade.
Eor three or four years he was an officer on the Atrevida , Rialto , and other vessels. An
opportunity offering for shore employment, Mr. Thompson left the sea, and was engaged
by Messrs. Clarke, McKenzie, & Co., ships’ chandlers, etc., Port Adelaide, with whom he
remained until the business was sold in 1871. In that year, with Mr. William Russell,
he purchased the concern, but subsequently obtained sole control, and to this day owns


the business. Thus, for all his life, Mr. Thompson has been connected with shipping, and
to the pleasure of his friends, he retains his old nautical appearance.
P'or a long period of years Mr. Thompson has been associated with the municipal
affairs of Port Adelaide, and, as is well known in that town, he has conferred great benefits
on the locality. He was for some years Chairman of the Portland Estate District Council,
now a ward of Port Adelaide. Lie next became a member of the Port Adelaide Council,
of which, in 1880-1 and 1881-2, he was Mayor. Prom the first he was vigorous as a
councillor, and he strove his best to serve at once his own ward and the whole town.
Some of the greatest improvements made there were sponsored by him, and it was thus
that Port Adelaide was relieved of the ancient name of ‘‘ Mudholia. He introduced the
proposal of asphalting the footpaths so strenuously that he brought the motion forward
three times before the Council wmuld agree to it.
o
After vacating the mayoral office, Mr. Thompson was requisitioned to stand for
Parliament, but, desiring respite from public duties, he declined. At the following general
election, however, he was nominated and was defeated in a field of ten candidates. I here
was a ruggedness and vitality about his political views that would have been serviceable.
In the early “eighties” Mr. Thompson took a foremost part in forming the Naval Reserve
at a time when war with Russia was considered possible. He held the first commission
granted in South Australia, and served for eight and a half years under Captain Walcot,
R.N., rising to the position of senior officer. He is now on the retired list, with the
rank of Commander. He was commissioned a Justice of the Peace in 1880, and was
the second President of the State Children's Council. He is one of the most genial and
excellent of the citizens of Port Adelaide, and is esteemed as one of the most intelligent.
Professor Edward Henry Rennie, M.A., D.Sc, F C.C.
NEW SOUTH WALES was the birthplace of Professor Rennie, who is the son of
Mr. Edward A. Rennie, Auditor-General of the mother Colony. He received his
early education at Fort Street Public School, Sydney, proceeding thence to Sydney
Grammar School, where, after his pupilage, he became an assistant master. In 1876 he
was appointed Mathematical and Science Master in Brisbane Grammar School, whence, after
a year’s occupancy, he proceeded to England to enlarge his scientific knowledge generally,
and make a special study of Chemistry. He accordingly entered the Royal School of
M ines, South Kensington, London; and in 1881 he took the degree of D.Sc. at the London
University. Dr. Rennie officiated as demonstrator in Chemistry at the Medical School,
St. Mary’s Hospital, London. Returning to Sydney in 1883, he became assistant in the
New South Wales Laboratory. Two years later he became Angas Professor of Chemistry
at the University of Adelaide, which position he still holds, as well as Lecturer in Metallurgy ;
he is also an honorary lecturer to Adelaide School of Mines, and has been Government
Inspector of Explosives. Professor Rennie Is a Fellow of the Chemical Society of London
and Berlin, and a Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland. He
has been twice elected President of the Royal Society of South Australia, and is one of
the local secretaries of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science.

Mr. John Tidmarsh
THE richness of the alluvial goldfields of Victoria redounded to the advantage not
only of that colony, but of every member of the Australian group. After their
mining days, thousands of diggers scattered over the continent, established sheep-
stations and farms, or engaged in business of one kind or another.' Nothing but the
presence of a fabulously wealthy
goldfield would have attracted this
multitude to the colonies at that
time ; and though they generally
intended to return to their birth-
places when their mining days
were over, they changed their
J O
minds when they experienced the
salubrity of the Australian climate
and the diverse opportunities the
new country offered to those
possessed of industry and brains.
The Victorian goldfields, in
the prosperity which they brought,
substantially afforded Mr. John
Tidmarsh the opportunity of de-
veloping an industry in Adelaide.
He was born in the city of Cork,
Ireland, on January 17, 1824. He
was educated at Dr. Radcliff’s
school in that centre, and gained
a good deal of experience in the
old country as a land and railway
surveyor. At the age of 1 7 years
he entered the late Mr. Anthony’s
J
office in the City of Dublin, as
assistant draughtsman in architec-
ture. There he received such excellent instruction that he was soon able to secure an
appointment to the Ordnance Survey ol Ireland. While thus engaged he met the late
Professor Tyndall, and they lived together for two years. On the completion of the survey
of Ireland, Mr. Tidmarsh proceeded to England under the same service, where he engaged
in field work in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Cumberland ; and a very delightful time he
spent in these famous counties. This was in the period of the railway mania. Surveyors
and engineers were wanted everywhere, and splendid offers were made to Mr. Tidmarsh,
one of which he eventually accepted. He first assisted to make the Parliamentary surveys
of the West Riding Union Railway, now the Lancashire and Yorkshire line, with some


small branches therefrom. Considerable other railway work followed, and Mr. 1 idmarsh’s
last employment in the old country was to lay out the centre line of the “ loop ” between
Boston and Lincoln, and also to “get up” the contract surveys for that line, work that
was done under Messrs. Sherrard & Hall, civil engineers, of London.
In March, 1849, Mr. Tidmarsh left Plymouth for Australia in the ship Madawaska,
bound for Port Adelaide, Port Phillip, and Sydney. It was his intention to proceed to
Sydney, to which place his letters of introduction were addressed ; but he was so
taken with the appearance of Adelaide and its surroundings, that he remained there,
having arrived in July, 1849. He sought to obtain employment in his profession, but the
remuneration offered was so low that he determined to adopt some business or trade.
By accident, he met the late Mr. \V. M. Letchford, who gave him employment as a
candlemaker, then a simple occupation. In association with this engagement, he was
appointed surveyor and valuator to the first building society established in Adelaide- the
General Land and Build in <4 Society- it being- understood between him and Mr. Letchford
o y O
that he would be always at liberty to attend to the society’s work when called upon.
After a short interval he left Mr. Letchford and entered into partnership with the late
Mr. W. M core (of M oonta), under the style of Moore & Tidmarsh, candlemakers. They
were fairly successful from the start, and eventually purchased Mr. Letchford’s business in
J J 1
Sturt Street, Adelaide.
In 1852 Mr. Tidmarsh left his partner in control of the joint concern, and went
to the Victorian goldfields. He had not been there long, however, before Mr. Moore
joined him, having relinquished the business. Mr. Tidmarsh travelled to different rushes,
sank claims, roamed through the lonely bush, and gained all that unrivalled experience
incidental to such abnormal occasions. The herding together in one gully of representatives
of every civilised nation, cultured and illiterate together, taugfht manv lessons to the
J O O j
gold-seekers, and helped to fit them for their work as pioneer colonists.
In 1853 Mr. Tidmarsh returned to Adelaide, and reconstructed his candle and soap
making business. The partnership with Mr. Moore was in the course of time dissolved, but,
requiring more capital to extend the connection, he took Mr. Letchford in with him.
Under the style of 1 idrnarsh & Co., the firm made headway. Buildings were erected,
' J o
all necessary improvements were carried out, and a large trade with a good name was
established. Then Mr. Letchford’s state of health became indifferent, and the partnership
was dissolved. Mr. Tidmarsh thenceforth carried the business on alone. From time to
time he imported improved machinery ; and he was the first to introduce the manufacture
of stearine candles in South Australia. Years later his health failing: from excessive work,
O ’
the concern was offered, through an agency, to a Melbourne firm. Messrs. W. H.
Burford & Sons, hearing of this, made proposals, and eventually purchased the business.
In his residence at Glenelg, Mr. Tidmarsh has since passed a quiet career. He
has given little attention to active public affairs, although for two years he was a member
of the Corporation of Glenelg. Mr. Tidmarsh retains a vivid remembrance of Adelaide
during nearly 50 years of its history, and he has the satisfaction of knowing that he
contributed his full share to its progress.

Dr. William George Torr, M.A., B.C.L. (Oxon.), LL.D. (Dublin),
Barrister-at-law (London), etc.
The great arenas of academic life, on which many a douo-hty scholarly knight has
*■ 7 ' O J y O
crossed mental swords, are hallowed to the sons of Alma Mater by fond memories
of intellectual chivalry within the walls and rich associations of distinguished scholastic
J c~>
heroes. Many of Australia’s cleverest youths have won their first laurels in the examination
halls of universities, and Oxford and
Cambridge, the great twin-sisters of
learning, have had Australian names
on their prize-lists. It was a wise
divinity that urged Dr. Torr to go
home and test his valor in the British
halls of learning. The results of that
decision could never have been an-
ticipated even in the most sanguine
hours of youth. He fought, and fought
J O o
well ; and his victories in the field of
learning were sufficiently decisive.
1 ’ J
Dr. William George Torr was
born in Tavistock, Devonshire.
With his father he came out to
Australia early in the “ fifties,” and
proceeded to the Burra, where mining
discoveries and developments were
attracting notice. While sojourning
in that “ copper settlement ” he took a
great interest in religious matters in
connection with the Bible Christian
Church at Kooringa. He was placed
for a time under the tutorial super-
vision of Mr. N. D. Bennett and Mr.
F. R. White, whence he passed to the
Stanley Grammar School at Watervale,
conducted by Mr. J. S. Cole. His studious habits, which almost resolved themselves
at this early age into an omnivorous desire for reading and extending his information,
began to tell on his physical constitution. Had he continued much longer at his studies
it is highly probable an injurious collapse would have prostrated him. As it was, recuperation
was imperative, and he was sent for relaxation to Messrs. Bowman Brothers’ station
in Tasmania. Open-air exercise soon restored young 1 orr to a state of robust health,
and he returned fit and fresh for the work on which his heart and mind were set.
An appointment as master of a small country school at Ulooloo was assigned


him. Though the position did not allow him much scope for the exercise of his educational
skill, he succeeded in drawing attention to the higher code of instruction with which he
furnished his pupils. His spare hours were devoted to the study of those subjects
necessary for the elementary preliminary examination under the old Board of Education,
for which he entered, and which he passed. From the mastership of I 100100, the subject
of this sketch was promoted to the Grote Street Model School, which was under the
superintendence of Mr. E. G. Madley. This appointment took place shortly after the
institution was opened. When the Training College was brought into active operation in
connection with the school, Mr. Torr was entrusted with the management of the Practising
Department, a position of importance and responsibility. Though the duties attaching to
his new sphere were undoubtedly arduous, they did not prevent him from entering for the
University examinations, as well as other examinations made necessary by the Council of
Education. Through these ordeals he safely passed, and the credit of a first-class certificate
accrued to Dr. Torr’s diligence and ability. This success was capped shortly afterwards
by his being made the recipient of another first-class certificate from the Inspector-General
of Schools, and his passing the highest examinations prescribed by the Council of
Education. These achievements reflected the existence of mental gifts of an uncommon
order. A new school was opened at the Moonta Mines, and Dr. Torr’s high testimonials
were instrumental in gaining for him the headmastership. This position he retained for
several years. He now began to feel the need for a holiday. He had allowed himself
few of these refreshing intermissions; and though in no way debilitated, he considered
that a short vacation would benefit his health as well as his mind. Accordingly, in 1884,
ne took a trip, and spent a year of travel on the continent of Europe, studying the
various educational systems of the world. Many matters of absorbing interest to so keen
an educationist as Dr. Torr were earnestly enquired into and noted for future purposes.
On his return to his former sphere of labors, he found that endeavors were being
enthusiastically made to perpetuate the memory of the late Rev. James Way, one of the
first Bible Christian ministers in Australia. The most suitable form of a memorial was
finally adjudged to be the institution of a college, which it was accordingly decided to build,
and name the “Way Memorial College.’’ Dr. Torr was offered the headmastership of
this establishment; but only agreed to accept it on the understanding that he should be
permitted to spend a few sessions in the British residential universities before starting in
the new sphere. This proviso was allowed, and in June, 1886, he went to England and
matriculated at Oxford as a non-residential student in November of the same year. He
commenced his undergraduate career well, for in March of the following year he passed
the examinations for Responsions; and in December following, the examination for
Moderations. Dr. Torr then boldly set to work to cover the prescribed university course.
In June, 1889, he emerged successfully with honors in Theology, appended to the Arts
degree. During this time Dr. Torr was entered on the registration book of St. lohn’s
College. Oxford, as a resident. His name was also entered as a member of the Inner
Temple, London, having passed his examination as a Barrister in 1888.
From Oxford, Dr. Torr proceeded to Downing College, Cambridge, where he
was admitted ad eundem gradum to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He had for the last
592
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Dr - WG - Torr


two sessions been distributing his energies between two Faculties, Law and Arts—a
self-imposed task, which needed not merely a clear head, but a long memory. In June,
1890, he passed his first examination for Law Tripos in the University of Cambridge.
Alter this success he went to Dublin to study under Mr. John Dockrill, M.A., one of the
best “coaches” at Dublin University. During his sojourn there he was proposed for a
call to the Bar at the Inner Temple by His Honor Mr. Justice Bristowe, and his admission
to the English Bar followed on January 26, 1891.
Dr. Torr’s scholastic performances now shift their locality to Trinity College,
Dublin. There he began to earn fresh laurels among some of the brightest intellects
that Britain can claim. The certamen of the Bachelor of Law examination confirmed
once again his calibre. He headed the list, gaining an almost unparalleled advantage over
his next-down neighbor of 1 2 per cent. After this meritorious exhibition, it was a foregone
conclusion that the degree of Doctor of Laws would be added to his long list of attainments.
The results were as anticipated, with the addition that he stood alone in the list on this
occasion. The last few months of his British academical career were spent in Oxford ;
and here, in June, 1891, a year earlier than was required by the statutes, he took his
B.C.L. de gree with honors. Dr. Torr was fortunate in having Mr. T. Radford Potts,
D.C. L., of Lincoln College, Oxford, for his tutor for this high-grade examination.
The era of his university life closes with this last achievement. Dr. Torr was now an
alumnus of several universities, in each of which he had acquitted himself well. Many
perhaps have climbed to the same academic apex of degrees and distinctions, but few
have climbed more quick!}'. In five years he had passed from the rusticity of a freshman
to the dignity and learned gravity of the doctorial hood. Between these extremes his
perseverance had built up an edifice of knowledge, with well-fashioned corner-stones.
A few weeks of recuperation were warranted after this long spell of studious
activity. A brief visit was paid to several places ot interest in Switzerland and Italy, when
further travel was cut short by the information that his services in Adelaide were in urgent
J O
request. Accordingly in July, 1891, he left for South Australia by the western route
through America. Dr. Torr travelled through the new world via Niagara, the Canadian
Pacific Railway, and Yosemite, and reached Sydney in September, 1891. On his arrival
in Adelaide he proceeded at once to take up his new duties, and assumed the control
of Way College. With Dr. Torr’s advent to the principalship of this institution, a wave of
prosperity has been the gratifying result, due to his powers of organisation, combined with
his high scholarly attainments. The “Hoc unum facio" adopted as a motto for the school
well represents the aim of the college, namely, to inculcate in all pupils the doctrine that
the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord. The zealous founders of Way College
cannot but feel that in establishing so efficient an institution they were not only doing
justice to the memory of their respected but departed friend, but that they were also
conferring a valuable educational gift on the younger generation of the Province. Dr.
Torr is a Vice-president of the Young Men’s Christian Association in Adelaide. He was also
appointed an Honorary Commissioner by His Excellency Lord Tennyson in 1899 to report
on education in Great Britain and other countries. This report gained considerable attention
in England and throughout the Commonwealth of Australia.

_J
The late Captain John Treloar
CAPTAIN lOHN TRELOAR, well known in mining fields and circles in auriferous
Australasia, had his day of hard work and sparing yields. When the pendulum
of prosperity swung freely to his efforts, he could not ascribe its happiness to blind
luck. Lor well-nigh half a century he labored with diligent perseverance. He was born
at Helston, Cornwall, on October
25, 1832. In his very infancy he
breathed a mining atmosphere ; for
all around his native place are
numerous mines developed by
sturdy Cornishmen. The Captain
had hardly crossed the threshold of
boyhood when he engaged on the
j O < ’
Grovas Cliff Mine as a copper-
dresser. In this preliminary occu-
pation he served for ten months,
and then promotion to the under-
ground workings of the Wast-
walwoar Copper Mine gratified
his boyish ambitions. Deep down
in the caverns of the earth, Captain
Treloar began his mining educa-
tion- the best school for instruction
in the many departments necessary
to the knowledge of a practical
miner.
In 1849 he sailed in the
Ascendant , with his brother James,
lor Adelaide. A fellow-passenger
on this trip w r as the late Mr. George
Fife Angas, the “ Father of South
Australia.” For some time after
young Treloar’s arrival in South Australia he worked with his brother as a carpenter. But
this kind of industry had very little interest for him, and he awaited the first opportunity
that presented itself for mining operations. The Burra Copper Mine eventually attracted
him, and he became an ore-dresser there. While he was working: at the Burnt the g'old-
O o
diggings of Victoria were discovered. News reached the Burra of the marvellous wealth
of Ballarat one night, and at five o’clock next morning the Captain was on board the
coach en route for the scene.
From Adelaide he took vessel to Melbourne, thence to Geelong, and the


remainder of the journey to Ballarat was accomplished on foot. His luggage followed
after on a wagon, the freight being a lew shillings per lb. weight. A firm friendship
was established between the Captain and some companions who were travelling to
the same destination, and they decided to cast in their lot together. After working at
Golden Point for a time, where they had moderate success, they repaired to No. i
Pennyweight Hill, to which vicinity a rush had taken place. The alluvial in this locality
was fairly rich, and several ounces of gold were extracted by the company in a few
days. It was here that Captain Treloar made his first speculation. An adjoining claim
was being abandoned by its owners, and they offered it for sale. He requested them to
give him the first chance. They wanted 10 ounces of gold for the property ; but Captain
Treloar, on searching - his dust gleanings, could only rake together 4G ounces. Ihe
O OO 7 c ’ 7
vendors, however, were by no means exacting, and one of their number advised his
mates to sell it for that amount. The rest complied. When Captain 1 reloar s mates
learned of his transaction they were far from pleased, as they believed that the claim was
worked out. However, they all started digging on the purchased property, and unearthed
ounces of gold in the first afternoon. As they were dividing this unexpected but
appreciable yield, Captain Treloar, to give some zest to the proceedings and call to mind
their unpleasant condemnation of his investment the preceding day, remarked : “ Perhaps
lam not such a young fool now.” I 7 or five more days the party worked this claim ;
and the sum of was distributed to each man as his share. Prom that spot
the party proceeded to Winter’s Plat and prospected in that neighborhood, with varying
success. They continued their search at Sulky Gully and Buninyong. Ihe alluvial
orounds of Victoria by this time seemed to be nearly worked out ; and the returns from
the claims were diminishing. Attention had shifted to reefs and quartz, and only a few
prospectors remained on the thrice upturned and overturned ground in the hopes of
picking up stray grains that may have escaped the eyes ot former workers.
Hardly, however, had the excitement over the Victorian diggings subsided than
J *
reports reached the ears of the miners that gold was being found in quantities on the
Molyneux River, in New Zealand. A rush speedily followed, and Captain Treloar joined
in the migration thither that resulted upon this announcement. After prospecting
round Adam’s Flat in Otago, New Zealand, a few miles from the Wooished diggings, he
waited till the river waters subsided, and then began to search in its bed and channel for
deposits. In company with his mates he took up a claim 12 miles below Maneureka, and
shepherded it for 10 months. One night disaster overtook the party. A flood of water,
slush, and snow came rushing down the mountainside with all the fury of a cataract, and
completely submerged their encampment and the field of their labors, the miners themselves
barely escaping with their lives. Having remained 12 months in Maoriland, Captain
Treloar took a trip to Melbourne, but returned soon after to further exploit the gold-bearing
areas of the island colony. From Dunstan Peak to Invercargill, Captain Treloar prospected
over many miles of territory ; but during this tour no glittering outcrops met the gaze
of the pioneers. Around Arrowtown, Shotover River, Lake Wakatipu, and Mount Ida, they
wearily prospected for several months, with little remuneration. At the conclusion of the
Captain’s prolonged endeavors he accepted the management of the Carrick Range Mine
for nine months. Perhaps the most valuable acquisition he obtained during his mining
L L


tours in New Zealand was a practical knowledge of hydraulic sluicing, kor a long time
he studied the methods and effect of this highly successful treatment in a gorge tour
miles below Cromwell. He now returned to Adelaide. South Australia had made little
advance in mining development since his departure, and for the time being he decided to
turn to some other occupation. He procured a situation in the services of Messrs. John
Hill Co., and the miner was entrusted with the driving of coaches in different country
districts. Captain Treloar drove the second mail to Willunga ; and amongst other places
in the Province to which he drove coaches were Angaston, Clare, Saddleworth, and Mount
Pleasant. Gradually he felt that a little of this occupation was more than sufficient for
a man of pluck and restless daring, and he retired from the driving-box and proceeded
to the then newly-discovered Femora goldfields in New South Wales. His success there
J o
was very satisfactory, considering the short time he was on the field. He then repaired
to Mount Brown, whither he had been preceded by some sanguine prospectors. But poor
rewards met his skilful attempts at that place, and he retraced his steps to Adelaide. He
next went to Mount Pleasant, and started mining on the Scots Gold Claim.
When silver was discovered in the Barrier District of New South Wales, Captain
Treloar proceeded to that quarter and made an exhaustive prospect all over the field. An
influx of population followed the discoveries, and the Captain saw a lucrative opening in
establishing a general store. Hay, corn, and an accommodation yard comprised his venture ;
and the favorable results which he anticipated were agreeably reached, and even exceeded.
For 16 months he remained in this line of business, and the profits of his industry were
invested in the leading mines of the district. When gold was found at Teetulpa he
closed his store at Silverton and journeyed to the new field. But disappointment greeted
his anxious efforts, and the Captain had to content himself with puddling at 7s. per load.
To Captain Treloar falls the credit of having been the first to take out a mining-
lease in this Province. Phis was for a prospector’s claim at Mannahill. The development
of it was attended with very moderate results. But by this time Broken Hill had
become a promising mining centre, and Captain Treloar was quick to recognise unlimited
possibilities in this new sphere. Repairing as quickly as he could to the silver centre, he
at once utilised his experience to the best advantage. The management of the Blue Cap,
the Crown Point, and the Great Eastern silver mines, belonging to English companies,
was entrusted to his charge. Whilst in this responsible position he opened up an extensive
bismuth mine at Mount Gipps. After remaining for a long period on the Broken Hill
fields, he repaired to Adelaide, and was made manager of the Mount Bryan Ranges
Mining Association at Hallett. P'or 10 months he developed these properties, and then
proceeded to Western Australia. In 1893, some months after the news of Bayley’s find
at Coolgardie was circulated, Captain Treloar arrived on the scene, having walked from
Burracoppin. Travelling was extremely difficult at that early stage of the Colony’s growth,
for means of transit and conveyance were as rude as the country through which the
J J O
incomers were obliged to pass. Some time after reaching the golden areas, Captain
Treloar received an appointment as manager of the Agnes Mine at Kalgoorlie. He
resigned when the fields began to be developed and more scope for profitable investment
was possible, deeming that he had served a sufficiently long apprenticeship in the rough


pioneering work of mining. His opinion on mines was sought for and valued, and
reliance was placed on his conclusions and convictions. He was called upon to formulate
reports on many important mines around Coolgardie. Seeing the great future that lay in
store for several of the leading mines, he quickly invested his money in them. Ihe
Hannan’s Brown Hill Mine at Kalgoorlie was purchased by him, and resold at a
considerable profit. The Reefers Eureka was pegged out and developed by him ; and
was then floated in Adelaide with a large capital. In May, 1896, he journeyed to London
and sold the Lombard and Charing Cross Mines. The Blumberg and other mines of
o o
South Australia were also floated by the Captain successfully into the Talunga Goldfields
Development Company, with a capital of ,£350,000, with ,£50,000 guaranteed working
capital. Four hundred and forty-two acres of freehold land have fallen to the possession of
the company, and systematic developmental work was instituted under his supervision.
For nearly 50 years this able miner pursued his avocation over almost all
the known Australian mining fields. With copper, gold, silver, asbestos, nickel, and bismuth,
Captain Treloar had extensive experience; and few had as ripe and comprehensive a
knowledge of the nature of these metals, and the multifold conditions attaching to their
discovery and raising. His practical acquaintance with every detail of the complex operations
of mining was conclusively evinced in the successful development of the properties
he controlled. His knowledge was gathered from numerous mining fields with diverse
00
metalliferous capabilities. He died at his residence, Nicholson Street, North Eitzroy, on
April 3, 1901.
Rev. Henry Thomas Burgess, LL.D.
IN the village of Sandbach, Cheshire, a child was born on March 27, 1839, who was
destined to wield a great influence within the Methodist Church of Australasia. Henry
<■> J
Thomas Burgess' came to the Province in 1848 with his parents, and lived at the
Burra, then in the heyday of its prosperity. He entered the ministry in 1859, his first
circuit being Yankalilla. In no fewer than a dozen circuits in the Province he has
“travelled” as a Methodist preacher, and has been Chairman ot the District, Home
Mission Secretary, Conference Secretary, and Connexional Editor on several occasions. In
rBBO, 1890, and again in 1900, Dr. Burgess was called to the Presidency of the South
Australia Conference. After serving as Secretary to the General Conference of the
Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church for six years, Dr. Burgess was elected
President, the highest honor which it was in the power of the Church to bestow.
He proved himself equal to all the demands made upon him whilst occupying that
onerous position, and worthy to stand in the place of the great men who had preceded
him. As a preacher, Dr. Burgess displays a keen power of analysis, and as a thinker
and speaker, he is in the front rank of Australia’s public men. In November, 1898, the
degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by the Middletown University, PI. S. A. fie
is the author of several prize essays, notably “The Fruit of the Vine,” and is a frequent
contributor to many local and foreign periodicals. He is generally regarded as being the
leader in the movement for Methodist union, which was so recently consummated in
South Australia. L L 2

The late Mr. Nicholas Wallis Trudgen
THE good works of a man live after him. The truth of that time-honored aphorism
is frequently exemplified in everyday life, and whether a man is a founder of
dynasties, an initiator in commerce, or a quiet, unobtrusive mover in the humbler
spheres of life, his contemporaries and those who come after him remember him according
to his good deeds. South Aus-
tralia from her earliest days has
been the possessor of many
worthy men, who, though they
may not have left any inefface-
able marks on the pages of
history proper, have fought the
good fight of colonisation and
subsequent citizenship, and left
to their fellows the memory of a
life of honest purpose, good
service, and praiseworthy effort.
The late Mr. Nicholas Wallis
Trudgen was a man of this stamp.
In a life of busy organisation and
j O
commercial undertaking he found
O
some time to set apart for the
good of his fellow colonists, and
when he died on May 16, 1892,
general regret was expressed, for
he was on all occasions regarded
as a man of undoubted upright-
ness, strict integrity, and
unblemished reputation. He was
born in 1840, in Cornwall. The
early part of his life was spent
in London ; he was educated at
Westminster College, and at the age of 13 was made a pupil teacher in that school. He
came to South Australia in 1855, and, resolving to follow the trade of a builder, it was
not long before he made headway in the calling. The years 1861-2 he spent on the
Victorian and New South W ales diggings, principally in the Snowy Mountains and
Bathurst districts, where he travelled hundreds of miles on foot. Upon his return he
again became associated with the building trade, and was appointed foreman over the
works of the late Mr. Henry Codd. Not many years after this Mr. Trudgen determined
j j j o
to start on his own account as a builder and contractor. In a few years’ time he was
one of the leading men in the industry in South Australia. Many of the most important


buildings in Adelaide, and a large number of the ornate residences which adorn the
suburbs, were erected by him. He was president of the Builders and Contractors’
Association from the time of Mr. William Bundey’s death up till 1891. In presiding over
the deliberations of that organisation, Mr. Trudgen’s actions were marked by sincerity,
courteous firmness, and an evident desire to cultivate a conciliatory rather than an
antagonistic tone when debatable matters cropped up.
For many years Mr. Trudgen was a resident of College Town, and was largely
identified with the civic affairs of that place and its parent municipality—St. Peters. In
1886 he was requisitioned to stand for Hackney Ward, and, acceding, was unanimously
elected. His tenure of office as Councillor was a very successful one, and, when he
had completed his term, he was chosen Mayor. In that capacity he became noted for
his hospitality and unvarying urbanity, and the duties devolving on him were discharged
with much good taste. On vacating the mayoralty he was again elected to the Council-
this time for East Adelaide Ward. Soon afterwards he practically retired from municipal
matters, as the exigencies of a growing and flourishing business demanded all his time.
He was frequently asked to stand for Parliament, but as often declined for the same
reason. In civic deliberations he was a man of outspoken opinion and good debating
power, and regrets were expressed when he retired.
In the Methodist Church Mr. Trudgen was an earnest worker. He was well known
in the pulpit in the Kent Town Circuit, and few of those who heard him will forget the
convincing earnestness which he at all times showed in expounding Holy Writ. He was
a superintendent of the Sunday-school attached to the Kent Town Church. Taking a great
interest in the spiritual welfare of the young, his kindly actions and words made him greatly
beloved by the scholars and congregation.
When Mr. Trudgen died, the people of St. Peters and many personal friends felt
that they had lost a worthy man, and they desired to place on record in lasting- form
J J • J.
their appreciation of his good work. Accordingly, a committee was formed, subscriptions
came in freely, and a fine granite and marble drinking fountain was erected to his
memory in close proximity to the Council Chamber of the St. Peters Corporation. His
employes also erected to his memory a handsome tablet in Kent Town Church. The
funeral of the late Mr. Trudgen was very large, and as a mark of respect to the deceased
gentleman, 150 of his employes headed the mournful cortege. By his death South Australia
lost a good colonist and an earnest Christian worker, He was a Justice of the Peace.
Rev. Silas Mead, M.A., LL.B.
HAVING taken the M.A. and LL.B. degrees at the London University, the Rev.
S. Mead came to Adelaide, and commenced services in the Baptist cause on July
13, 1861, in White’s Rooms, King William Street, with a Church membership of 25.
Two years later the spacious edifice in Flinders Street was built. Shortly afterwards the
adjoining Manse was added, and the Church greatly prospered under Mr. Mead’s pastorate.
Resigning in 1897, he undertook educational work in England. He was first President of
the South Australian Society of Christian Endeavor, and a President of the Adelaide Y.M.C.A.


Professor Ralph Fate, F.G.S., F.L.S
ALNWICK, in Northumberland, England, famous for its castle, was the birthplace
of the subject of this brief notice, who first saw the light in i <S4O. He began the
study ol geology at the early age of 12, and in 1858 he won a tree exhibition of
ZjBo per annum to the Government School of Mines in London. In the capital he conducted
geological classes at the Royal Polytechnic. After filling, in succession, several important
00 J J . . .
scientific positions at home and abroad, he was, in 1876, appointed to his present position
on the Adelaide University staff—Elder Professor of Natural Science. At that eaily
period the duties of the post were many and various, and the Professor found himself a
kind of maid-of-all-work, the scientific instruction necessarily being discursive, and consequently
wanting of due full effect. Since then the instructive work has been bettei organised, and
now Professor Tate is able to confine his educative efforts to their legitimate sphere of
Geology and Mineralogy as principal subjects, with Botany as a subordinate pursuit. In
Geology (Part I.). 32 students; in Geology and Mineralogy (Part IP), 10 students; in
Botany, 32 students; and in Palaeontology, 4 students, form the present classes (Apiil,
1900) under Professor Tate’s tuition. The high quality of the essays on field-work submitted
by four of these students in competing for the Angas Scholarship in 1900 was made the
subject of special notice. A feature of Professor fates method of instruction is the
organisation of pleasant and instructive trips (some extending over several days) with his
students to parts of the country presenting interesting opportunities for geological and
botanical study.
Professor d ate is tin honorary member of the Royal Society of New South
Wales, the Natural History and Philosophical Societies of Belfast and Whitby, and the
Field Naturalists’ Clubs of Belfast, Melbourne, and Geelong. fie is a corresponding
member of the Academy' of Science, Philadelphia, U.S.A, of the Lin mean Society of New
South Wales, and of the Royal Society of Tasmania. He was an associate of the Lineman
Society of London from 1865 to 1885; and he is a Clarke Medallist of the Royal Society
of New South Wales. In connection with the Australasian Association for the Advancement
of Science, he was President of Section 1) in 1887, President of Section C in 1900, and
General President in 1893. He is a member of the Board of Governors of the Public
Librarv ; has served on the Council of the School of Mines from the beginning; and is
chairman of the Museum Committee. The following works are from his pen: —“ Ihe
Yorkshire Lias ” (in joint authorship with Professor j. P. Blake), (1876); “A Class-book
of Geology” (1872); “ British Molluscs ” (1866); “Flora Belfastiensis ” ( 1863); “Appendix
to Woodward’s Manual of Mollusca ” (1867); and “Handbook of the Flora of South
Australia” (1890). Professor Tate has been a prolific contributor to the leading scientific
publications, his record of papers published through these media standing at present as
follows Geology, 85; Botany, 34: Zoology, 46; making a total of no fewer than 165.
He is the sole survivor of the original four professors (appointed in England) ol the Adelaide
University. Outside his professorial duties, Professor Tate has rendered highly-appreciated
service to the cause of science in South Australia by re-organising the Royal Society of
the Province in 1887, thus extending its utility and field of action.

Mr. Walter Henry Wadey
TH. E reflection, that life fulfils itself in many ways, of the old Jewish singer, is
abundantly proved in any work of biography which claims to be representative.
Apai t from that particular professional or commercial sphere which a voung man
chooses as the work of his manhood, if he have the talents he usually employs them in
other subsidiary and less selfish
grooves. Thus he may become
a politician, an authority on civic
affairs, or he may devote himself
to the elevated cause of philan-
thropy. Ihe subject of this
sketch has directed considerable
attention to the work of friendlv
J
societies.
Walter Henry Wadey is a native
J J
of Adelaide, South Australia, where
he was born on July 29, 1848.
His father was a colonist of some
importance, and carried on business
in Currie Street for many years
J J •
Young Wadey was articled to the
legal firm of Matthews & Ander-
son, and subsequently, upon the
death of Mr. Anderson, to Messrs.
Matthews &R. B. Cox. Havino-
o
been admitted to practise at the
South Australian Bar, he entered
into partnership with the firm,
which became known as Matthews,
Cox, & Wadey. Mr. Wadey,
however, retired from this com-
bination, and practised alone until
1881, when a fellow-clerk in the old office, Mr. E. J. Cox, who had meanwhile been
practising at Kadina, moved to Adelaide and entered into partnership with him, the firm
being styled Wadey &E. f. Cox. This firm continues in existence, and possesses a substantial
connection in the city. Mr. Wadey’s standing as a lawyer is best indicated by the statement
that he has been tor many years solicitor to the Adelaide Corporation, an office of responsibility
and importance. He has been the solicitor to the Licensed Victuallers’ Association
(another strong local institution) ever since its formation.
Mr. Wadey has been identified with the Walkerville District Council for several


years, for a portion of the period as chairman. He has greatly helped in improving that
suburban centre, and its by-laws bear the imprint of his energy and foresight. In the
realm of friendly societies he has been especially active. It has been his endeavor to
render these influential bodies all the assistance in his power. Mr. Wadey has occupied
the highest positions in the M. U. I. O. O. P., the Eoresters, and the Druids. He has been
associated with such societies since he was 19 years old, and has filled the Grand Masters
chair of the M. U. 1.0,0. E. He was elected President of the South Australian Priendly
Societies’ Association in November, 1896, and re-elected in November, 1897. 1 his
Association comprises all the friendly societies of South Australia, and represents many
thousands of members. He is now on the Board of Directors of the Manchester Unity
Friendly Society.
J J
Mr. Wadey has been connected with the Australian Natives’ Association since
its inception, and has occupied the positions of President of the Adelaide branch, and
President of the Association in the Province. In January, 1890, he attended, as a delegate
from South Australia, the convention of the Association held in Melbourne to consider the
question of federation. It is now generally accepted that this conference of Australians sub-
stantially influenced the advancement of the cause. Being a man of large views and
o o
earnestness of character, whatever he undertakes is done heartily and well. Mr. Wadey
was made a Justice of the Peace in the year 1886. He is a Commissioner for taking
Affidavits in the Supreme Court of South Australia, and also a Commissioner for
Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, and New Zealand.
Mr. Thomas Noakes Stephens
Perhaps in no sphere can the citizen render such enduring and patriotic service
to his country as in the Civil Service. In this, as in other professions, talent
invariably rises to the top and assumes the place that it merits. Time service is not
everything, for competition rules there as everywhere. Mr. T. N. Stephens was born in
South Australia, and was educated at Mr. R. C. Mitton’s Academy, Waymouth Street,
Adelaide. After entering the Civil Service as a messenger, he rose to the highest and
most responsible offices under Government. On July i, 1864, he joined the Customs
Department of the Province. Transferred to the Treasury Department, he occupied several
positions in that branch of the service, including that of chief clerk, until January, 1877,
when he was appointed to succeed Mr. G. S. Wright as secretary to the Marine Board.
11 is knowledge of the detailed work of the department enabled the Government to leave
vacant the office of president, and to appoint Mr. Stephens head of that branch. In 18go
he became Under Treasurer, and in the following year he was appointed Acting Collector
of Customs and President of the Marine Board. His duties as Under Treasurer required
him to act as Comptroller of Imperial Pensions in the Province and Secretary to the
Minister having the direction of the affairs of the Northern Territory. On May 1, 1894,
he was appointed to the offices of Collector of Customs and President of the Marine
Board. He is also Registrar of Shipping under the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act,
Chief Inspector of Excise, and Chief Inspector of Eisheries. He is a Justice of the Peace.

Mr. William 1 Ware
THE leaders of different branches of commerce, however unconsciously, leave their
names on the pages of progress in colonial growth. Mr. W. L. Ware, who forms
the subject of this memoir, has long been favorably known in South Australian
business affairs. William Lawes Ware was born at Exeter, Devon, England, on
October 24, 1847, and arrived
with his parents in South Aus-
tralia in 1850. He entered into
business in the city as an
accountant and financial agent in
1872, and continues as such to the
present day. His office has
always been one of the largest
of its kind in Adelaide, and very
valuable work has been performed
there in connection with estates
and accounts of all kinds.
Recognising from an early date
how much it would mean to this
Province if mining could be
established on a large scale as a
permanent industry, Mr. Ware
has, since first entering into
business, invested much capital
from time to time in different
mining ventures in South Aus-
tralia, having been identified with
enterprises at Yorke Peninsula,
Echunga, Waukaringa, Reedy
Creek, Barossa, and many other
places. His courage deserved the
success which cannot always be
commanded.
Mr. Ware is a P'ellow of the Institute of Accountants in South Australia,
Incorporated, of which he has been president, is also Fellow ot the Incorporated Society
of Accountants and Auditors, London, and has held, and holds, important positions in
the local commercial, mining, and financial world. He is a Director of Luxmoore, R. J.
Coombs, & Co., Limited, one of the leading woolbroking firms ; also of the celebrated Great
Boulder Proprietary Company (Western Australia), of Henderson & Macgeorge, Limited,
forwarding agents (Western Australia), and other companies. Elected by the; citizens ot
OO \ '
Adelaide in 1878 to the position of City Auditor, he has continuously filled that position ever
since. He was one of the Liquidators appointed by the Court to wind up the Commercial


bank of South Australia in the financial crash of 1886, and is, amongst other things, Auditor
to the Bank of Adelaide, I). & \V. Murray, Limited, Harrold, Colton, & Co., Limited,
and D. dx J. howler, Limited. He represents in South Australia the Lake View South
and the Lake \ iew Extended Mining Companies (Western Australia), and is an Attorney
tor the Central Australian Prospecting Syndicate, formed for the purpose of opening up the
interior. I his list sufficiently indicates his business standing.
Mr. Ware has been closely connected with the civic affairs of Glenelg. In 1889
he was elected Mayor of the popular seaside resort, and for three years worthily discharged
the functions of that office. His intimate knowledge of accounts made his presence at the
Council chamber one of considerable value. Directly after assuming the robes of office he
1 ight royally entertained the Governor, the Earl of Kintore, together with a large number
of leading citizens and early colonists, on December 28, 1889, the anniversary of Proclamation
Day. In response to requisitions he became, in 1893, a candidate for the representation
of the Central District in the Legislative Council, and again in 1896 for the District of
Sturt for the House of Assembly; but, owing to the tone of politics at this period being
all in favor of the election of labor members, he was unsuccessful.
In 1889, Mr. W are was made a J.P., and in 1895 became President of the South
Australian Patriotic Association a body which was formed to foster the national
sentiment, and which led the way in opening its doors to women members. He is
prominent in Preemasonry, having joined the Lodge of Friendship in 1875, under the English
Constitution , and became Master of that Lodge lor three years. He was a member of the
Executive Committee which formed in 1884 the Grand Lodge of South Australia, of which
he wais the first Grand Freasurer; he is also one of the founders of Lodge St. Alban; is
Honorary I reasurer of the Freemasons’ trust property, in the acquiring of which by the
Craft he was largely instrumental some 15 years ago. He is an honorary member of the
Oddfellows Lodge, Glenelg, and is also both a Druid and Forester.
In yachting and all aquatic pastimes Mr. W are has been enthusiastic. He donated
the Ware Cup for yacht races in Holdfast Bay. As President of the Commercial
Rowing Club, and a Vice-President of the South Australian Rowing Association, he has
done much to stimulate friendly rivalry on the river. Mr. Ware’s connection with sport,
however, does not end here, for in addition he was Vice-President of the Adelaide
Cycling Club, Patron of the Glenelg Lacrosse Club, and is a Life Member of the Glenelg
Oval Association.
Mr. W are has always been able to find some time to devote to the welfare of
his fellow South Australians. Besides being a member of numerous societies and
associations of various kinds, he was Lion. Treasurer of the Federation League, which
did so much in South Australia to push into prominence the question now happily
consummated in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia. He has been from
1878 a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was for the years 1892 and 1893 one of the
officially appointed visitors to the Adelaide and Parkside Lunatic Asylums. He has been,
ever since its inception in 1893, actively concerned with the carrying on of ostrich
farming, an industry still in its pioneer stage, but which is admirably adapted to our
climate, and capable ot growing to large dimensions.

The late Captain William White
REARED, as it were, within the sound of clattering batteries, and wooed to sleep
by their thundering sounds, it is small wonder that Cornishmen make good miners.
And as so much Australian wealth has been extracted from her mineral deposits,
the presence of Cornishmen in her varied dominions has gone far in pushing forward the
mining industry. Indeed, Cornish-
men appear to be essential
factors in mining pursuits. Many
Cornishmen were attracted to
South Australia, and amongst the
number was the late Captain
\\ illiam \\ bite, a gentleman who,
long before he visited these shores,
played a part in the mining affairs
of Cornwall.
Captain William White was
born at St. (ust. Cornwall. His
father had been engaged in mining,
and, not unnaturally, the son
followed the same avocation.
At an early age the 1 ate
William White was “captain” of
the St. Just’s United Mine, and a
little while after became manager
of this big concern. A young man
with the world before him. he
resolved to leave his old-time
associations, and accepted a seven-
years’ engagement as manager of
the Currangarra Copper Mine,
New South Wales. He fulfilled
this contract satisfactorily, and then
went to Bathurst, whence, after a short residence, he proceeded to Sydney. From Sydney
he went to Tasmania, where he became manager of the West Bischoff bin Mines. Eight
years’ residence in the southern colony affected his health very considerably, owing to the
dampness of the air, and he was advised to come to South Australia by his medical
attendants. Following this advice, he arrived in Adelaide in 1889. His health benefited
by the chan are, and he soon gathered round him a large circle of friends, while in the
J O 1 O cj
mining world his opinion was valued as coming from an authority.
Captain White was appointed by a local syndicate to report on the Kuriowie


Tinfields, near Broken Hill. After making a careful examination of them, he tendered
an adverse opinion. In 1894 he paid a visit of inspection to the goldfields of Western
Australia, and, on his return to Adelaide, gave much valuable information respecting
them. He was an investor in mining stock in Adelaide up to the time of his death in
June, 1895; an d when he died there was much regret expressed, for he had won many
triends by his generosity of disposition and hearty goodwill to all.
The extension of Captain White’s connection in Cornwall may be judged when
we state that he signed testimonials for over 500 men before he left for Australian shores.
In his native land in 1865 he won a Queen’s Prize for mining—practical and theoretical.
He was a member of the Council of Mining Pingineers of Australia.
Captain White took an intense interest in horticultural matters, and in the lovely
gardens surrounding his home at Unley Park, charming tributes of his skill in this direction
O J o
were apparent. He left a widow, two sons, and four daughters. Mrs. White has largely
identified herself with the charitable affairs of the district in which she resides, and her
name is prominent in philanthropic affairs.
Professor Edward von Blomberg Ben sly, M.A.
BORN in 1863, Professor E. von B. Bensly is the son of the late Mr. R. L. Bensly,
M.A., I -ord Almoner’s Professor of Arabic in the University of Cambridge, and
one of the revisers of the Old Testament. He was educated at Eastbourne College
(Leaf Scholar, 1875) and at Haileybury College (Entrance Scholar, 1876; Leaving
Exhibitioner, 1881), under the late Dr. Bradby. He was elected to an Open Foundation
Scholarship at I rinity College, Cambridge, in 1881, before coming into residence. As an
undergraduate he obtained college prizes for Classics, Classical Composition and Greek
Pestament, and a cup for an English declamation. In 18S3 he was placed by the University
Examiners in the First Division of the First Class of the Classical Tripos (Part I.), and
in 1885 in the hirst Class of the Classical Tripos (Part II.) for Sections A (Translation
and Composition) and B (Language). He was “ honorably mentioned ”by the examiners
for the Chancellors Classical Medals in 1885. Prom 1885-7 Professor Bensly studied
Classics in Germany : matriculating at Tubingen in 1885, and at Leipzig in 1886.
On returning to Cambridge, Professor Bensly was engaged in giving private tuition
to candidates for classical honors, and in examining work for the University. In 1891 he
was appointed an adjudicator for the Members’ University Prize for an English Essay.
He also gained experience in collating MSS. From 1889-91 and 1893-4 Professor Bensly
acted as Lecturer to the Cambridge Local Examinations and Lectures Syndicate ; and in
1892 he accepted an invitation from the University of Chicago to assist in starting
P niversity extension work there. He was offered, and declined, an assistant professorship.
Prom January to May, 1895, he studied Grteco-Roman Art and Archaeology in Rome,
o J
having the personal advice and instruction of the late Dr. J. H. Middleton. In the
summer of 1895 Professor Bensly sailed to Australia to take up the duties of the Chair of
Classics in the University of Adelaide. In 1897 he revisited England, when he married
Mary Hamilton, daughter of the late Major-General D. J. Welsh, R.A.


Mr. G eoro-e Wilcox
o
THE standing and importance of a city is best judged from the dignity and integrity
of its commercial men, and according to their wealth and influence will that city
flourish. Mr. George Wilcox for many years conducted an extensive intercolonial
business, and brought much wealth to Adelaide. He was born at St. Neots, Huntingdonshire,
England, in 1838, and came to South Australia in 1857. Under the name of (. &G.
\\ ilcox he and his father launched a drapery and general merchandise business in Gawler
In 1858, and during the succeeding 17 years were successful in obtaining an important and
lucrative connection.
In 1875 Mr. George Wilcox removed to Adelaide and established himself as a
wool and produce merchant, paying particular attention to the hide and skin trade. While
originally the business transacted was small, it quickly grew as the public recognised the
integrity and acumen of Mr. Wilcox, and thus from year to year it expanded until at
present it is one of the largest houses of its kind in Australia. In course of time
branches were opened in Melbourne, Victoria, and in Albany, Western Australia. In
1886 a branch was established in Young Street. Sydney. The last assumed large and
remunerative proportions, and in order to devote himself more thoroughly to his interests
in the mother colony and South Australia Mr. Wilcox closed the Victorian and Western
Australian branches. Mr. Sidney Wilcox, a son, and Mr. G. G. Legoe, were taken into
partnership, in 1889, and in 1894 Mr. George Wilcox sought retirement, whereupon two
other sons, Mr. G. S. and Mr. M. Wilcox, joined the remaining partners.
Mr, Wilcox has lons' been recognised as among the shrewdest of Adelaide’s commercial
o o o
men. He has been for years a director ol the 1 lamley Copper Mine, and was one of the
liquidators of the Town and Country Bank. He erected the Apollo Soap Works at Hindmarsh
which, after a successful run of 3yd years, were purchased by Messrs. Burford & Sons.
Lately, Mr. Wilcox has pursued a quiet career. He resides at Eynesbury, Mitcham
Road, in a charming house situated in 14 acres of ground. His straightforwardness and
unassuming nature make him a popular citizen.
Rev David Paton, D.D.
DUNFERMLINE, Eifeshire, Scotland, was the birthplace of the Rev. David baton,
D.D. In 1864 he graduated M.A. at the University of Glasgow, and four years
later he took the H.D. degree. For a time he was in charge ol the Garelochhead
Free Church in Dumbartonshire. He was ordained at Dalton Free Church, in Dumfriesshire,
in 1873. He resigned his pulpit in Scotland on receiving a call to Chalmers Church,
Adelaide, and just prior to leaving for South Australia in September, 1877, he was married.
In 1886 he was elected to a seat on the Council of the Adelaide University, and in 1894, he
was made a Governor of the Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery.

Mr. Charles George Alexander Winnecke, F.R.G.S., F.R.A.S
scientific explorer is necessarily one of the most valued among colonial pioneers.
X He it is who supplements the results of undaunted effort by the descriptions,
locations, and distances which alter the record from a traveller’s tale to the traceable
and useful facts of geography. Adelaide has been a centre whence great exploring and
scientific expeditions into the
northern regions of the continent
have gone out; and it is to the
o
credit of the Province that some
of their leaders have been born
on her soil.
Notable amongst these is Mr.
Charles George Alexander Win-
necke, F.R.G.S., whose explora-
tions in outlying areas have added
much to the public knowledge.
Charles Winnecke was born at
Norwood on November 18, 1857.
His parents, who were German
colonists, appreciated the value of
education, and sent their son to
St. Peter’s College, where he ob-
tained an excellent training, which
in no small degree contributed to
<w*
the success of his after career.
Having completed his education,
in 1873 Mr. Winnecke entered
the Civil Service under Mr. Goyder,
then Surveyor-General, as a head
chainman. He rapidly rose to
responsible positions. Mastering
the surveying profession, he soon
received an appointment, and shortly afterwards was placed in charge of parties doing-
work in the interior. His travels in Central Australia now began. As a trigonometrical
surveyor and explorer employed on Government work and researches, he traversed nearly
the whole of the Northern Territory, and pushed his efforts at times beyond the borders
into Western Queensland and other colonies. Some years spent in this valuable exploratory
work spread the fame of Mr. Winnecke beyond the bounds ot his own Province, and
recognition of his efforts was given in his appointment to a Fellowship in the Royal
Geographical Society, which honor he has further justified by subsequent efforts. He is
also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.


Ihe confines of the Civil Service were, however, too narrow for the ambition
of Mr. Winnecke, who. in 1882, retired from the Government employ and commenced
private practice as a trigonometrical surveyor, explorer, etc. His fame having already
become established, Mr. W innecke found no difficulty in obtaining appointments. He
commanded several expeditions into the interior, and acquitted himself worthily of his
past reputation. Notable amongst these was the Horn Scientific Expedition into Central
Australia, which was promoted in 1894 by Mr. W. A. Horn. Mr. Winnecke had charge of
the party, which numbered several prominent scientists, and the trip was successful in adding-
much new data to the geographical, geological, zoological, and botanical sciences of Australia.
Highly eulogistic accounts of Mr. Whnnecke’s leadership appeared in the public Press,
and the testimony of his fellow scientists confirmed the opinions thus expressed. Altogether,
Mr. \\ innecke, who is yet a comparatively young man, has pursued a very creditable
career, and as a native-born colonist he thus deserves a high place in historic narrative.
The late Dr. Sylvan us James Ma^arey
I'' HE beloved physician "is a term that could well be applied to the late Sylvanus
fames Magarey. As President of the South Australian Alliance, Chairman of the
Hospital Board, in the Parliamentary arena, or at the bedside of the sufferer, his
integrity of purpose, fidelity to duty, high ideals, and kindness of heart were manifested to
all with whom he came into contact. He was the second son of Mr. Thomas Margarey, who
represented the District of West Torrens in the House of Assembly, and afterwards
occupied a seat in the Legislative Council. Sylvanus fames Magarey was born at
Adelaide, on .October 21, 1850. Educated at St. Peter's College, he afterwards devoted
two years to the millinef trade. He studied medicine and surgery for five years at the
J O J J
University of Melbourne, graduating as M.B. in December, 1873. He devoted special
attention to the diseases of children, and his brochure upon the subject attracted
considerable attention. In 1887 he took the degree of Bachelor of Surgery, and in
March, 1888, his M.D. degree, at the University of Melbourne. P'or some time he was
Honorary Medical Officer to the Adelaide Children’s Hospital. He also occupied a seat
upon the Council of the Royal Society, and took a great interest in the proceedings of
the Field Naturalists’ Society, of which he was a member. From 1888 to 1897 he
represented the Central District in the Legislative Council, and had the satisfaction of
seeing several of his political reforms carried. He was Chairman of the old Hospital
Board at a critical period of its history. For over 20 years Dr. Magarey was an elder
in connection with the Church of Christ, Grote Street, Adelaide. He died on March
24, 1901, and the large attendance at his funeral of representatives from temperance and
friendly societies, medical men, legislators, and the general public, proved the esteem and
affection in which he was held by all classes.

The late Mr. Gilbert Wood
IN the eventful “ fifties,” when most Australians were beside themselves with excitement,
begot of stories of gold finds, the late Mr. Gilbert Wood opened a small grocery
shop in Angas Street, Adelaide. In 1856 the Province was returning to life and
activity after the depression caused by the exodus of people to the \ ictorian goldfields,
and Mr. Wood took advantage
of the improvement to increase his
business. Almost from the incep-
tion the concern was a success,
and soon its locale was removed
to Rundle Street.
Mr. Gilbert Wood was born
in 1828, in the Shetland Islands,
whence, no doubt, he inherited
that adventurous and roving dis-
position which marked the earlier
years of his career. Wont to be
rocked asleep with the lullaby of
the sea-waves in his ears, he con-
ceived, as a youth, a wish to become
a sailor. He was gratified, and
spent several years voyaging from
countrv to country. Eventually,
j J *
after wandering to and fro, he
proceeded to Melbourne as chief
mate on the brig Seaton , of
Aberdeen, of which his brother,
Mr. Gifford Wood, was master.
He remained on the Australian
coast for some time in charge of
the schooner Grenada , trading
from port to port.
Mr. Wood was thus engaged at the time of the \ ictorian gold-rush, and on one
occasion evinced the possession of commercial talent, the results of which probably influenced
him to engage in shore competition. He carried a cargo of flour from a port in South
Australia to Victoria on behalf of the late Mr. S. \\ hite, of Aldinga. Ihe Hour was
sold to a Melbourne firm, who, after the contract was signed, Mr. Wood learnt was
hopelessly insolvent. By skilful and delicate management he succeeded in cancelling the
sale, and resold it to another house at a considerable advance in price. Ihe shrewdness
of this deal marked his commercial career in Adelaide.


While situated in Rundle Street the business rapidly grew, and in 1876 Mr.
Wood took his son, Mr. Peter Wood, and Mr. James Gartrell (his chief clerk for many
years), into partnership, and from that date traded under the style or title of G. Wood,
Son, & Co. At this time the business combined the retail with a wholesale trade, but
after a short lapse of time, the retail portion was sold.
But Mr. Wood was something; more than a staunch commercial man. He
<7
demonstrated a warm and earnest interest in Church and philanthropic matters, and was
for years a deacon in the Clavton Congregational Church. He also took a great interest
J • o o o
in friendly societies, particularly the Druids and Foresters, with whom he was more
closely connected, having attained to the rank of Past Arch in the former. His wife, who
survives him, materially assisted his efforts in a good deal of unobtrusive charity.
J O J
In 188 r Mr. Wood took a trip to England for the benefit of his health, but
gained no permanent good. He died on September 24, 1886, of heart disease, and the
eulogiums passed upon his character were numerous and heartfelt. Some time before
his death, Mr. Wood was made a (ustice of the Peace.
To-day the firm of G. Wood, Son. & Co. is foremost among the principal
wholesale grocery merchants in South Australia, with numerous travellers and resident
representatives in various parts of the colonies. The firm has now large premises at Port
Adelaide, Fremantle (Western Australia), Broken Hill (New South Wales), and offices in
London ; whilst their commodious premises at North Terrace is undoubtedly one of the
chief ornaments of our city. The credit for the earlier extension of the business was
largely due to Mr. Gilbert Wood, who, by shrewdness and straightforward dealing, won
the respect of the business world and the confidence of the public.
Hon. Richard Butler, M.P.
A LTHOUGH not a South Australian, the Hon. R. Butler was but four years of age
when he came with his parents to South Australia. He was born at Oxford,
England, on December 3, 1850, and educated at St. Peter’s College. Subsequently
he engaged in farming and grazing pursuits. He has represented the district of \atala
in the House of Assembly since 1890, and in 1898 became Minister of Education and
Agriculture in the Kingston Ministry. Upon the reconstruction of the Holder Ministry,
caused through the retirement of the Hon. b. W. Holder upon his election to the Pederal
House of Representatives, Mr. Butler became I reasurer and Minister of Agriculture.
Hon. Thomas Henry Brooker, M.P.
Minister of Education and Industry has much in common with his colleague, the
1 Treasurer. They were born in England in the same year, were the same age
when they arrived in South Australia, and both have continuously represented
their respective districts in Parliament since they were elected in April, 1890. Mr.
Brooker was educated by the late Messrs. (. Chambers and H. Davidson, at Hindmarshi
In 1897 he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Botanic Gardens,
a position he still holds. M M

The late Mr. Robert Woolnough
IN his smug complacency the shore man is apt to take little account of the contribution
of the sailor to the development of trade. He does not often recognise how important
a part of commercial business is coastal maritime transit. A railway looms large in
his eyes, but a sea trade is taken as a matter of course. He will agitate for privileges for
the railway magnate and his
employes, but he often forgets
all about the sailor.
In earlier years the coastal
trade of South Australia was a
very important feature in the
development of various districts
separated by long distances from
each other. The navigators who
conducted the sailing vessels up
and down the gulfs, and out into
the ocean to the southern settle-
ments, were therefore valuable
links in the industrial chain.
It is our wish to here Qfive the
biography of one of the most
important of these men. The
late Mr. Robert Woolnough was
born in 1823 in a small village a
few miles from Lowestoft, England.
Mr. Woolnough dreamt of the
sea as a boy. He was soon able
to follow it, and became engaged
on a coastal vessel which for years
J
sailed from port to port in Great
Britain. But there is not so much
attraction in coastal work as in sailing boldly over the ocean to other climes; hence Mr.
WTolnough joined the ship Sarah Sands , making several trips with her to America, and
to the Cape of Good Hope. Eventually he came in that vessel to Australia, and in South
Australia severed his connection with it. He was next engaged on the schooner Bandicoot,
O o
carrying supplies to the settlements along Spencer Gulf. In this manner he obtained a
very thorough knowledge of the navigation of South Australian waters, and on March
1, 1854, was appointed a pilot, serving under the auspices of what was called the Trinity
Board, since named the Marine Board. While most of the trading was carried on by
< » J
sailing vessels, he was an important factor in the Province, and there was probably no


more skilled seaman on the coast. P'or many years Mr. Woolnough served South Australia
in an adventurous capacity, meeting dangers by storm or rock with the calmness of a typical
British mariner. He was a skilful seaman, and no serious accident happened to a vessel
under his command. Those of the emigrants now livingf that arrived in the Electric in
O O
the early sixties will remember the pilot who risked his own life to save theirs, and the
successful manner in which he saved the ship from being wrecked on the Brighton
Rocks.
Mr. Woolnough was chosen by the President of the Marine Board on many
occasions for special duties, and when the members of the Royal Commission took evidence
on the Outer Harbor Scheme, he was selected as an expert to apppear before them.
When Mr. Woolnough retired from the pilot service, he spent his remaining
years at the Semaphore. Here he pursued a quiet career. Beyond being one of the
earliest members of the Semaphore District Council, he did not engage in public affairs.
He was trustee and treasurer for several years in the Oddfellows, and was a Mason. In
1854 his wife joined him in South Australia, and she now lives in a street in the Semaphore
which bears the name of the worthy old pioneer. Mr. Woolnough died on October 22,
1895, after spending nearly 50 years most usefully in South Australia. His eldest son,
Mr. Robert Woolnough, is shipping and insurance manager for D. & W. Murray, Limited,
and has been chairman of the Woodville District Council. Another son, Mr. C. Woolnough,
is harbormaster at Wallaroo, and a third, Mr. William Woolnough, is a naval architect in
Scotland.
Pastor Henry Hussey
r I A H E sturdy pioneers are fast passing away: but Pastor Henry Hussey, who arrived
| in the Province in the barque Asia on July 16, 1839, is still living at Hackney,
and is full of reminiscences of the time when Hindley Street was sometimes a
bog-hole, and bullock-drays were the only means of locomotion. Born at Kennington,
London, it was as a lad of 14 he arrived in South Australia with his parents. As office-boy,
sailor, postman, compositor, master printer, editor, preacher, bookseller, he has played
many parts in his long and active career of over 76 years. One ot his most useful acts
was the compilation, for the late Mr. G. F. Angas, of the materials for the “ History ot
South Australia” edited by the late Mr. Edwin Hodder; and subsequently he issued a
handy volume, “Colonial Life and Christian Experience,” which is a treasure-trove to the
seeker of information as to how the Province has developed. In 1873, upon the death of
Pastor Thomas Playford (father of the Hon. T. Playford), Mr. Hussey became pastor
of the Bentham Street Christian Church, Adelaide a position he occupied, as a labor
of love, for 23 years. He was also superintendent of the Sunday-school, editor ol the
“Australian Journal of Prophecy,” and for many years conducted a Bible Hall in blinders
Street. He was on the committees of the Adelaide City Mission, the Aborigines
Friends’ Association, and the Benevolent and Strangers’ Friend Society. Ile was ever
willing to help the poor and needy and give his assistance to charitable causes.

The late Mr. Thomas Worsnop, 8.A., LL.B.
IN the golden age of Rome, when municipal law had established itself firmly in many
of the larger cities and towns in Italy, certain officials held positions in connection
with the civic administration that closely resembled the modern office of town clerk,
rhouoh the duties then were less defined and elaborate than they are now, they entitled
o
the official to certain distinctions
and orders denied to many in-
fluential citizens, and invested the
office of the functionary with much
responsibility. The hands of the
town clerk of to-day keep the keys
to the municipal fortress, within
whose stronghold lie the safeguards
of the city’s rights and security.
He is the guide and friend, if not
the philosopher, of the councillors
who are charged with the duty of
promoting and preserving the in-
terests of the city. His knowledge
and acquaintance with municipal
affairs and law must be compre-
hensive enough to act as an epitome
for the use of civic legislators.
The choice of an individual to
discharge these manifold duties
often becomes a matter of diffi-
culty.
J
Adelaide, however, has been
fortunate in having the services
of the late Mr. Thomas Wor-
snop as its town clerk for many
years. He grew old with the
* o
Council, to whose work and progress he had been devoted for nearly 40 years.
Mr. Thomas Worsnop was born in Leeds on February 2, 1818. He was educated
at Cambridge, and graduated in 1843. The degree of Bachelor of Arts was conferred on
him in absentia in 1874, and at a later period the degree of LL.B. as a reward for his
attainments in law. He left for South Australia a few years after its foundation. After
following pastoral pursuits in the new country for some time, he came to Adelaide. He
received an appointment as clerk in the Town Clerk’s office in 1866—a step which proved
of advantage to him a few years later, when, in 1869, he was appointed Town Clerk to


the City of Adelaide, in succession to Mr. W. A. Hughes. His efficiency in his office
has been recognised far beyond the confines of South Australia. As controller of the
complex and often involved office work of the Corporation, Mr. Worsnop was, from the
first, accounted able, willing, and reliable. His long and varied experience was always at
the service of members of the City Council, and his place in the council-room has resembled
oftimes a regency rather than a clerkship. Mr. Worsnop was one of the best-known
municipal officers in Australasia.
d hough the City Clerk takes no share in the legislative discussions of the Council,
his role being more of an adviser, Mr. Worsnop gained high praise for his share in the
establishment of the Municipal Association. In 1879 a full syllabus of its aims and
provisions was drawn up, in the designing of which Mr. Worsnop was one of the
architects, and on this plan the organisation was founded and set in motion, he being
appointed secretary of the Association. Mr. Worsnop achieved some distinction as a
histographer and compiler. As a pioneer he had to collect his material from many sources
of information, and to trace their broken and scattered connection with due regard to
historical sequence. Ihe process was as laborious as it was hazardous. The written
collections of predecessors were few, incomplete, and faulty, and the faithful and truth-seeking
historian had to wander wearily through records with a persistence that would undermine
the courage of any save the diligent and enthusiastic historian. After infinite exertion and
trouble, the “ History of Adelaide” was completed by him, and published in 1878. Its
pages, replete with valuable and interesting information, clearly expressed, form a distinct
contribution to the literature and historical knowledge of the Province. This work was
followed in 1880 with the publication of “ Adelaide and its Environs,” a series of chapters
devoted to the growth of the municipality. As in the former work, no pains were spared
in amassing the material dealt with. The origin of the principal institutions and associations
of the city, their subsequent expansion and development, and the various governing bodies
of the municipality, were described in a clear and interesting fashion.
At other times during his busy career Mr. Worsnop contributed to the Press able
articles dealing with the Government and Constitution of the Province. A keen student
of Egyptology, Mr. Worsnop spent much time and money in acquiring information about the
ancient country of the Rameses and Pharaohs ; and his library on this and many other
J * J
subjects was a valuable one.
In 1890 the Council, as a mark of appreciation for his long and useful services
in its midst, presented him with a life-size portrait of himself. There were few officials
in South Australia who could lay claim to so worthy and lengthy a career as a public
servant. Time did not dull the vigor of his intellect, age did not lessen his endeavors to
discharge his duties as ably and satisfactorily as in the heyday of his manhood.
In December, 1897, Mr. Worsnop’s useful career terminated with his death.
The expressions of esteem, and the panegyrics of newspapers, abundantly testified to his
worthiness.


The “ Register ”
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN REGISTER may not inaptly be described as an
entity. In all local history no man, be he a Sir Henry Ayers in politics, or a Sir
Thomas Elder in Industrial development, has so vitally affected provincial interests
as the Register , and no public man can boast of so long, consistent, and progressive a
record. The virile quality in this entity has percolated through every branch of endeavor,
and no individual colonist has been so universal, so patriotic, so versatile in his service.
While men have governed for a little space, and have disappeared to make room for
others, the Register has continued as a pregnant force, a leader of thought, and a
stimulative agency to all departments of usefulness.
The history of the Register is, indeed, almost without parallel in newspaper
literature. Firstly, its age is greater than that of the Province it was founded to assist ;
secondly, it is the second oldest newspaper in Australia ; and thirdly, it takes rank among
the oldest newspapers in the British Empire, or in the world for that matter. Most of
the newspapers in existence in Great Britain at the time of its foundation have disappeared,
the innumerable journals of the present day being of a much more recent creation. Ihe
mere fact that the Register was published anterior to the proclamation of South Australia
is sufficient to prove its right to the name of unique, and to be considered, as the Review
of Reviews (October, 1893) says, “a complete, contemporaneous, unbroken record of the
birth and life of an important State.”
The initial number bears the date of June 18. 1836, under the name of the
South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register , and was printed by W. Clowes & Sons,
Dick Street, Stamford Street, London. Messrs. Robert Thomas and George Stevenson
were the proprietors, and both gentlemen afterwards assisted to a very considerable degree
in founding the Province. Mr. Thomas was esteemed as an influential pioneer, and Mr.
Stevenson, who had been associated with the editorial staff of the London Globe, did
much useful work as a journalist, and as Governor's Secretary and Clerk of Council. That
first number, issued 65 years ago, contains what information could be obtained
of the distant southern wilderness for which the pioneers were bound, and also certain
records relating to the arrangements that had been made for the establishment of a new
settlement. Six weeks later Governor Hindmarsh left England for South Australia in the
Buffalo , accompanied by Mr. Stevenson and other officials. Mr. Thomas and his
estimable wife had already sailed in the Africaine with a printing plant intended to be used in
producing the paper. In November, 1836, the Africaine arrived off Kangaroo Island, and,
in obedience to the instructions of the Surveyor-General (Colonel Light), was a few days
later riding at anchor in the Holdfast Bay roadstead. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas were among
that hardy band of men and women who waited on the beach at Glenelg for the arrival
of the Governor, and for the selection of the site of the capital city. They and their
family lived in tents and a rush hut in the midst of the camp, and, like the rest of the
new arrivals, had to spend many weeks chafing in idleness. Messrs. Thomas and
Stevenson were present at the official proclamation of the Province on December 28,

1836, and the latter had the distinguished honor of publicly reading the interesting
document to the 200 odd people assembled about the bent and ragged old gum tree
at Glenelg. Mrs. Thomas wrote an entertaining account of the celebration. Ihe Register
is thus six months older than the Province.
Ihe first actual work carried out in the Register Office in South Australia was
the printing of the document proclaiming the Province. One of the presses and the
type were transported to the reed hut on a truck, and there, after much difficulty, copies
were produced. This was the beginning of local printing. For many tedious weeks
most of the people waited at Holdfast Bay until it had been determined whether the
capital should be on the Torrens River or at Port Adelaide; and after this point had
been settled, until the city had been surveyed, so as to allow of the taking up of allotments,
d'he enforced idleness was galling to the spirits of the partners, and it was as embarrassing
as it was annoying ; the fact being that such important matters should have been decided
before the pioneers arrived. Discord was abroad, and parties, holding diverse views, were
formed.
In March, 1837, selections of city acres were made by lot, and the pioneers
removed to Adelaide. Owing to the scarcity of conveyances, Mr. Thomas found it
extremely difficult to get his printing plant to the city ; but it was after it had been
taken thither that his more acute troubles began. Part of the plant had been carried by
mistake to Tasmania ; and an experienced printer named Osborne, upon whose aid the
proprietors had very largely depended, perished in the bush while trying to cross
Kangaroo Island on foot. It was almost impossible to procure hands to print the paper,
and there was no reporter. But Mr. Thomas and Mr. Stevenson, with the aid of members
of the former’s family, did the best they could. The plant was erected in a pise hut in
Hindley Street, and on June 3, 1837, the second number of the South Australian Gazette
and Colonial Register was issued. It must have given pioneer residents peculiar pleasure
to have this old-world convenience produced in their midst. There is no record of the
number of papers issued, but, judging from the enormous difficulties of printing, it may be
imagined that it was very limited. The old demy Stanhope press is still preserved in the
offices of the Register, and constitutes a very interesting relic. This pioneer number is
perhaps the most valuable historical record existing in South Australia. The first page contains
all the proclamations made by the Governor up to May —such as the proclamation of the
Province ; appointment of Civil officers ; notices of the passing of a law to establish Courts
of General or Quarter and Petty Sessions in South Australia (January 2, 1837), and
of other ordinances; appointment of first Justices of the Peace; and official report of
meeting on May 23 of the Civil officers and most prominent landowners to determine
the street, terrace, and square nomenclature of Adelaide. Ihe second, with part of the
third page, contained the names of the first purchasers of city acres in the Province. Then
followed the editorial, noteworthy for the expressed determination of the paper to be
free of party strife or of leaning to any one side. There were no Quixotic professions ;
an effort was to be made to serve the Province as a whole, and, adds the editor, “every
step in its progress will be hailed and recorded with exultation ; the interests, worldly
and spiritual, of the hundreds, civilised and barbarous, involved therein, will meet with
zealous advocates in us, so far as our powers can be available to them.’ 1 his was the


keynote of the modest, independent, and manly editorial. A newspaper editor is human,
and only once or twice—notably in 1842, when Governor Grey was pursuing his career
of retrenchment —was there a suspicion of personal feeling. There was in this second
number of the paper nothing inconsistent with the professions of the editor, and, although
the little community was already rent asunder by personal squabbles, the succeeding
columns are free of bias and of all signs of party influence. There were six pages in
the newspaper, and all of them full of local matter. Mr. Stevenson and the members
of the Thomas family were the contributors indeed, the latter were as versatile in
accomplishments as a modern goldfields camp editor.
Were it possible to do so within a reasonable compass, it would be interesting to
recount in detail the gradual development of the paper. A journeyman printer in a new
settlement is almost proverbially irregular in his habits. During the infant struggles of a
colonial newspaper one or two printers have been the supreme factors. Ihe staff is
small, and publication is dependent on its tender mercies. Literary contributors can be
found without much trouble, but in an infantile settlement an experienced compositor is a
rarity ; and his movements are apt to be somewhat eccentric. These peculiarities chiefly
explain the precarious and spasmodic publication of the paper in its earlier days. The
intention was to issue it weekly ; but during ' the numbers appeared at such intervals
as June 3, July 8, July 29, August 12, September 16, October 4. October 19, and
November 11. The editor is reported to have thus indignantly delivered himself on
the last-mentioned date : “ The late appearance of the Register has been occasioned by
the misconduct of a journeyman printer, who has thought proper to desert his employment
at a moment when engaged in making-up or arranging the types for the present number.
There are a certain set who have not scorned to tamper in a most scandalous manner
with our printer’s servant, but if they have succeeded in enticing him away from his duty
they will not escape the exposure which awaits them for their pitiful and disgraceful
conduct." Alter this number there was a long gap, and again an “ ill - conditioned
journeyman" is blamed. The next issue was printed on January 6, 1838, with the
assistance of Mr. William Kyffin Thomas (then only 16 years old), who afterwards had
a lengthened and honorable association with the paper.
In 1839, several compositors having arrived from England, the Register became
a weekly paper in fact as well as in name, the day of publication being Saturday. In
April, 1840, the plant and copyright of another local paper —the Adelaide Chronicle—
were incorporated with the Register. The people of South Australia, as well as the
financial affairs of the Province, were just entering upon the most exciting phase of their
history. Through a concatenation of circumstances, Governor Gawler had, with the very
best intentions, succeeded in precipitating a “ boom," and this, like modern episodes of the
kind, had its re-action. Governor Gawler was superseded by Governor Grey when
the Province was on the verge of bankruptcy, the Colonising Commissioners and the
Imperial Government having refused to honor the bills of Colonel Gawler. In obedience
to instructions, and as the outcome of his own investigations and views, Governor Grey
proceeded to retrench with an unsparing hand, The process was a bitter one to
colonists, and naturally excited their opposition because it temporarily ruined thousands


ot them ; but the policy proved to be the best in the long run, in that it forced the
energies of the Province into legitimate grooves. The proprietors of the Register were
not exempt from the turmoil and the suffering. Sarcastic and even bitter paragraphs
against the Government were published, and the official advertisements, which, by long-
standing arrangement, had appeared in the paper, were withdrawn. Thereupon the titles
“ Gazette and “ Colonial ’’ were dropped, and the name was shortened to the South
Australian Register, under which denomination the paper was known until January
i, 1901, the date of the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia, when the
simpler and shorter title of “ The Register ” was adopted. During the financial
collapse of 1841-2 Mr. Thomas suffered severely. His journal had so denounced
the action of the Government that he was even deposed from the office of Government
Printer. He visited England, and appealed to the Imperial Government for redress,
but in vain. The affairs of the Register now became so entangled that the energetic
and deserving proprietors endured the mortification of seeing the paper pass out
of their hands. In August, 1842, Mr. James Allen took over the plant and copyright.
Mr. Allen, it is recorded, “had a great deal more of boldness and literary skill than of
money, and bailiffs were in almost constant attendance at the office.” Early in 1840 the
Register was enlarged to eight pages, and in August of the same year it assumed the
form of a broadsheet. Mr. Allen removed the offices from the west end of Hindley Street
to the corner of King- William and Rundle Streets—now the “ Beehive Corner.” In
February, 1843, the Register began to come out twice a week; and a year later an effort
was made to publish it as a “daily,” but the venture was premature, and die paper
resumed its original form and issue. These progressive and then retrogressive acts
practically completed the ruin of Mr. Allen.
And now another change took place. In June, 1845, Mr. John Stephens, who
had previously been associated with the editorial staff, became proprietor. Already the
legitimate occupations of the colonists had begot a more healthy condition, and the
Kapunda and the Burra Copper Mines were beginning to turn out wealth. From these
developments a newspaper was bound to obtain some advantages. Mr. Stephens carried
on the paper for several years. He was an able man, and had been closely connected,
on other papers, with the journalistic development of the Province. In 1843 he had
established the Observer , and now ran that journal in connection with the Register. He
was called a “literary Great-heart,” because of his courage and the effective means he
took to check abuses. His courage was so great and his pen so caustic that he was
frequently assailed with libel actions, and Mr. (afterwards Sir) R. D. Hanson held a standing-
retainer from him. Mr. Stephens thus entered the slough of financial embarrassment, and
on one occasion the Sheriff removed all the printing plant to an auction room. Mr. Stephens
got permission to use his plant, and the “ novel sight of an auction mart turned for the
nonce into a printing office was presented, with the compositors working hard and
probably incited to extra effort by the somewhat humorous side of the situation." Even
this energy was insufficient, and an order prohibiting work was received. Mr. G. Dehane,
a printer of standing and reputation, came to the rescue, and the Register was issued
from his office. Despite all his troubles, Mr. Stephens managed, in 1850, to firmly
establish the Register as a daily newspaper. He died, “a victim of worry,” in November,


1850, and his journalistic intrepidity was such that at one time “nine libel actions against
him appeared on the cause-list of the Courts.” The Register was serving its apprenticeship
in tribulation, but belter days were near at hand. In the interests of the widow and
family, Mr. John Taylor generously and manfully undertook the management of the
paper. After great striving against disheartening conditions, he established the paper on a
sound financial basis, and even rendered the widow and family comparatively independent.
On May 24, 1853, eight gentlemen, comprising a syndicate, took over the Register
and the Observer, one of them being the son ol the deserving founder. Four of
them —Messrs, f. H. Lucking, A. Hay (late member of the Legislative Council), F. H.
Faulding, and T. Magarey (father of the late Dr. S. J. Magarey) soon retired, leaving the
property in the hands of Messrs. A. Forster, F. W. Andrews, W. K. Thomas, and Joseph
Fisher. The editorial department was entrusted to such celebrated Australian journalists as
Mr. Forster, Dr. Andrew Garran (well-known in New South Wales afterwards as editor of
the Sydney Morning Herald and the writer of essays and publications bearing an Australian
reputation), Mr. W. R. Whitridge, and Mr. ]. H. Barrow. Under this control the rise of
the Register was rapid. The Province was entering upon an era of phenomenal develop-
ment, and the paper rose in the respect of the people. In 1864 Mr. Forster retired
from the firm, and in the following year Mr. Fisher sold his interest to Mr. John Howard
Clark —the firm becoming Andrews, Thomas, & Clark.
In 1868 the Evening Journal saw the light of day; and in 1870 the Register,
which for 16 years had continued in the broadsheet form, became an eight-page publication
of smaller size. Originally the paper was issued at 6d. a copy, from 1839 to 1841
is. was charged, then 6cb, then 4d., then (in May, 1864) 3d., and, on January 1, 1882, 2d.
In 1877, upon the death of Mr. Andrews, Messrs. Charles Day, J. H. Finlayson, and
R. K. Thomas, who had for years been prominently associated with the office, were
admitted to the proprietary. In May, 1878, Mr. J. H. Clark died, and the death of
Mr. W. K. Thomas occurred on July 4of the same year. These two gentlemen wielded a
very substantial inlluence over the destinies of the Register. The younger partners remained
in charge under the name of W. K. Thomas & Co. Mr. Day retired on June 30, 1890:
and the two remaining proprietors assumed the sole control, until in 1899 the firm
was extended by the admission of Mr. William ]. Sowden and Mr. Evan Kyffin
Thomas. In Mr. R. K. Thomas and his brother it is gratifying to record that two
grandsons ot the founder are still among the heads of the worthy paper. During the
year 1898 a fourth generation of the family entered the establishment in the person of
the eldest son of Mr. Robert Kvffin Thomas.
Before turning to the editorial branch again, it is worth mentioning that the
present land occupied by the Register, in Grenfell Street, was purchased in 1854. In
November of the following year the hand-machines were superseded by steam, and two
gasometers were erected; in iB6O the offices were lighted from these, this being the
first illuminating gas produced in the Province. In 1889 the electric light was installed.
On July 1, 1892, the price of the Register was reduced to one penny. The office is now
equipped with the latest machinery, including the linotype, and the most modern and
powerful printing presses from the celebrated works of Richard Hoe & Co.


Such is the historical record of this newspaper. It would be difficult to appraise
the full influence which the Register has had on the affairs of the Province in moulding
public thought, in leading the way for useful innovations, and in furthering the just rights
of all citizens, high or low. The Review of Reviews, in the Australasian edition for
October, 1893, says; —“In a broad generalisation, the Register may be described as always
having held itself aloof from and independent of political parties; and, in many cases,
instead ot acting as the official voice—the trumpeter before the throne —it has given to
some of the dominant politicians of the day the suggestions of and materials for many
of their edicts. It has ever been broadly liberal in its sentiments, and, whilst it has
championed collectivism in all cases where individualism would not so well conserve the
public interest, it has most stoutly contended for the exercise of personal freedom of
speech and of opinion. Sectional predominance it has discountenanced, whether regarding
industrial matters or anything else. It has been a fighting paper from the beginning, and
has steadfastly refused to be the organ of any party.” There is no doubt that it has;
frequently forced the hand of the authorities when they lagged, and there is equally no
doubt that it has so affected public opinion that important policies have been demanded
with a determined voice. It has been as a bulwark to the State from the beginning.
The editors of the Register have been celebrated in the Province. Mr. George
Stevenson, Mr. James Allen (author of a “History of Australia”), Mr. John Stephens,
and others, have already been sufficiently referred to. Mr. A. P'orster’s “ History of
J J J
South Australia ” obtained highly complimentary criticisms at the time of its publication ;
and the same gentleman rendered the Province considerable service in advocating, and
afterwards supporting, responsible government. It was he who piloted through the Legislative
Council that valuable measure the Real Property Act, which has been the model for
legislation in many parts of the world. The literary calibre of Mr. John Howard
Clark is well remembered by old colonists. Besides ably editing the Register, he
“conducted a literary column in which playful fancy and pungent satire were blended
under the heading of ‘ Echoes from the Bush,’ by ‘ Geoffry Crabthorn. Messrs. Richard
Wells, William Harcus, W. R. Lawson, and Moubray Morris were at one time connected
with the paper, and each acquired no moderate fame with the pen. Mr. J. H. Pinlayson’s
work in the editorial chair is so well-known that it is not necessary to remind South
Australians of its excellence. He is a splendid organiser, and his sensible leaders carried
great weight in the Province. In 1899 he proceeded to England, where he is acting as
London correspondent to the Register; and Mr. W. J. Sowden, for many years prominently
associated with the paper, now occupies the position of editor. Perhaps the most valuable
part of Mr. Sowclen’s work lay in his energetic and patriotic support ot the Commonwealth
Bill, and for the preponderating vote in favor ot that measure the Register claims a great
share of praise.
Mr. R. K. Thomas controls the commercial affairs of the Register, and is a
worthy descendant of a worthy sire and grandsire. In equipping the office with the
latest mechanical contrivances, he and his partners have shown much enterprise ; and, from
its present strength and popularity, it may be assumed that the Register in the future, as
in the past, will exercise a commanding influence in the Province now constituted a State.

The Bank of Adelaide
THE most flourishing of locally-founded financial institutions in South Australia is Ihe
Bank of Adelaide. Ushered into existence a few years previous to the opening
up of the Northern agricultural areas which brought the Province such wide-spiead
1 . • *ll
repute for its grain, and such gratifying prosperity, colonists have ever)’ right to be
thoroughly proud of its history and of its sturdiness. Substantially owned by local people,
and managed also by them, it is a conspicuous indication of the financial stability of the
country and of the legitimate nature of its pursuits. During the financial cataclysm
which swept over all Australia a few years ago, The Bank of Adelaide, to quite a
noteworthy decree, was unmoved amid the storm ; it stood as a house built upon a rock,
J O A
On this account not a few congratulations were showered upon each other by South
Australians at that period, and their good opinions concerning the Bank were heightened
so that its subsequent history, notwithstanding the depression in the Province, has been
as prosperous and successful as ever. The ability to weather storm and strife during
many years of life, is a just criterion for judgment of merit. In appraising a human
character, the philosopher observes how the subject appears when tribulation comes, and
how he wears under prosperity. And a banking institution at such periods is not unlike
a human being.
The Bank of Adelaide was promoted in 1865 by leading men of the time, among
them : The Hon. (afterwards Sir) Henry Ayers, Dr. F. C. Beyer, Messrs. John Dunn


C. 1 . Harris, 1. S. Henry, I homas Magarey, William Morgan (afterwards Knighted),
William 1 eacock, R. Barr Smith, R. A. I arlton, and T. G. Waterhouse. Except for the
historical Lank of South Australia, founded in March, 1837, three months after the
proclamation of the Province, under the auspices of the celebrated South Australian Company,
there had been no very important locally-owned institution of the kind, and the proposals
were welcomed by certain prominent commercial men, among whom the promoters were
not the least. Ihe subscribed capital of the Bank was ,£250,000, in 50,000 shares of
£(5 each, of which the sum of £75,000 was paid up. The trustees under the deed of
settlement were Mr. Joseph bisher, and the late Messrs. Anthony Hall and James Smith. No
trouble was experienced in getting the institution incorporated, and the incorporating Act
of I arliament was assented to on December 5, 1865. Men of high reputation and position
were appointed to the first Board of Directors, such as the Hon. Henry Ayers, Messrs.
I . (1. \\ aterhouse, R. Barr Smith, 1 homas Magarey, and G. P. Harris ; whilst Mr. John
Souttar was entrusted with the responsible duty of managing the concern.
«
On December 11, 1865, Ihe Bank of Adelaide formally opened its doors to
business. Under excellent management it quickly acquired a substantial connection, and
three years after its foundation it paid a dividend of 6s. per share. Important current
accounts were opened and encouraging deposits were received, and the popularity and
utility of the institution has increased year by year. It early became evident that the
expanding business of the Bank would demand an increase of subscribed capital. During
the three years following its projection the paid-up capital was increased to £(200,000, and
in 1872 it was deemed especially necessary to further add to the capital. An additional
lot of 50,000 ££ shares was accordingly issued at a premium of £ 1 per share, and was
readily taken up. By the year 1875 the paid-up capital had reached ££oo,ooo, at which
figure it has remained.
Mr. John Souttar managed the Bank until October, 1879, when he retired, and
in April, 1880, Mr. R. G. W ilkinson succeeded him. The latter gentleman was eminently
fitted for the onerous work, and for nine years he carried on the duties with marked
success. I he Bank took a firm hold on local industry, and extended its field of operations.
It filled a useful and very necessary place in the community and consequently increased in
popularity and power with its growth. Mr. Wilkinson was a financier of superior powers,
and he seemed to grasp the essentials of local business life. He was esteemed as a
strong force in the Province. He retired from the office of manager in August, 1889, and
was appointed superintendent, which position he held until 1890, when he retired from the
Bank’s service. In Mr. John Shiels an efficient substitute as manager was found. Mr.
Shiels possessed a long experience of banking matters in Victoria, and his expert
knowledge was bound to be advantageous to the local institution. This has been
abundantly proved during subsequent years, as a reference to the appended statistics
will show. During the financial panic of 1893, when so many banking institutions doing-
business in Australia collapsed, The Bank of Adelaide lived on in a dignified and quiet
security, and shareholders and depositors were consequently exempt from the annoyance
and loss caused by reconstruction or liquidation. The Bank continued to rise steadily in
public estimation, and it now occupies the leading position among similar institutions doing

business in South Australia. It was for some years the only bank, and is still one
of the banks, in the Province proclaimed by the Government under the Trustees Act
of 1893 as a bank in which trustees may deposit trust funds without liability to
themselves.
The head office of The Bank of Adelaide is situated at the corner of King
William and Currie Streets, Adelaide, where a handsome and commodious building
supplies one of the chief adornments to the central thoroughfare. 1 here are 17 branches
and is agencies in South Australia, and there is a branch in London, the Directors of
which are Messrs. W. Lund, Abraham Scott, and Frederic C. Dobbing, the manager being
Mr. Percy Arnold. The present directorate in South Australia consists of Messrs. A. G.
Downer (chairman), Henry Scott, James Harvey, H. C. E. Muecke, and Sir Jcnkin
Coles, M.P. Mr. Shiels continues to act as manager, and he is admirably assisted by
Mr. R. S. Young, the accountant.
The followino- statistics, taken from the balance-sheets, show in a concise form
the progress made by the institution since its establishment :
In connection with the above statement it should be noted that, in addition to
the coin and bullion shown, the Bank held from 1887 and onwards Government debentures

u The Advertiser ”
7*^ Dtk AD I ERIISh R was first published in Adelaide on Monday, July 12, 1858,
under the auspices of a company, the editor being the late Hon. J. H. Barrow,
then a member of the House of Assembly. By the articles of association Mn Barrow
was given absolute control over the editorial department, the prospectus being extremely
explicit on this point. He was a man of rare ability, great breadth of view, and large
experience. 'J'hc Advertiser, according to the desire of# its flj&hder, was to be “in
harmony with the spirit of the age, of independent tone, of constitutional liberalism, of
catholic sentiment, unfettered by party obligations, reflecting honestly the opinions of the
majority, and at the same time giving free scope for the exposition of the views and
wishes of the minority. Ihe new papers — The Advertiser and its weekly companion, the
Chronicle —will utter plain truths in plain language; will call the spade a spade ; will
enunciate a straightforward policy, whether popular or unpopular, but will at the same
time afford an open column for respectful criticism and generous opposition.” During the
16 years in which Mr. Barrow exercised his powers as managing editor these principles
were kept steadily in view, and there has been no departure from them in the more
prosperous days of the Province, and of the paper.
It is mentioned in the initial issue as a co-incidence that this date —July 12, 1858
was the fifteenth anniversary of the day on which was first published the earliest
Melbourne daily paper, afterwards bought by, and incorporated with, the Argus. The
introductory words of the first leader are as follow:—“ After many unavoidable delays
' J 1
much labor, and no small amount of anxiety, we are this day enabled to present our
opening number to the public. So far as relates to popular sympathy and support we
certainly have nothing to complain of.” The second sentence has been perennially true
of 'flic Advertiser , and could be as accurately written to-day as on the occasion when it
was first printed. In the beginning the paper consisted of four pages with seven wide
columns on each, the price being gd. per copy. The printing press then in use was a
small American machine capable of turning out 1,500 complete copies of The Advertiser
in an hour, but this proved quite equal to the demand of the subscribers. Telegrams
were unknown in those early days, except so far as some of the more important inland
towns were concerned, and it was not until a fortnight after the paper was started that
through communication was established between Melbourne and Adelaide, the first
messages exchanged being the usual complimentary greetings from Governor Sir Henry
Barkly, of Victoria, and Governor Sir Richard MacDonnell, of South Australia.
Though youthful compared with some of its Australian contemporaries, the
foundation of The Advertiser still ante-dates many events which now belong to ancient
history. For instance, it is, only 15 months younger than the establishment of Constitutional
Government in South Australia, and the first lines of its second leader show that it
preceded another great change—“ The question of Government officers, other than
responsible Ministers, holding seats in the Parliament of this Colony is one upon which

before long the decision of the local Legislature will have to be taken.” That decision
was taken so many years ago that the occasion for it is now forgotten. It is interesting
to know that the prospectus of the National Bank of Australasia is published in the first
number. Another item appearing in the earliest issue is the Gazette notice of the
appointment of Sir R. R. Torrens, the hero of the Real Property Act, as Registrar-General,
for the purpose of assisting in carrying out its provisions. The Act was then six months old.
The Chronicle was founded at the same time as The Advertiser, and has grown
• . y o
vigorously, increasing in size, in influence, and in circulation. Its first number was
published on Saturday, July 17, 1858, at the end of the week which was responsible
for the appearance of its daily coadjutor. On November 30, 1863, the Express, a penny
evening paper, was established by 7 he Advertiser proprietors to relieve the pressure
of competition from the Daily Telegraph, which had been started by Mr. E. Sinnett, a
very capable journalist, who
afterwards joined the staff
of the Melbourne Arens.
<z>
The Telegraph had the dis-
tinction of being absolutely
O J
the pioneer penny paper of
Australia, and The Adver-
tiser, by purchase, can now
claim that honor. The in-
fluence of the Express, which
had the advantage of being
o <->
able to reproduce all the
more interesting items in
The Advertiser, together
with much new matter,
soon made itself felt, and
on January 2, 1867, a
notice appeared announcing
the sale of the Daily Telegraph and the Weekly Mail to the proprietors of The Advertiser.
Whenever an opening for further enterprise has occurred, The Advertiser has
taken advantage of it, either by a reduction in price or an increase in size. On July i,
1869, when the paper was barely 1 1 years old, the cost was changed from qd. to 2d. ;
on July r, 1875. there was an advance from four to eight pages; on January t, 1877,
another column was added to each page; on July 1, 1878, the size of the paper was
enlarged ; on January 1, 1884, the price was dropped to id. ; and on September 26,
1892, facilities were provided for extending The Advertiser to eight or nine columns to
the page.
Some hint as to the rapid growth of the paper is to be found in the equipment
of the machine department at various stages of its existence. In the beginning, a small
press, printing one side of the paper at a time at the rate of 1,500 impressions an hour,
629
The Advertiser ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


was sufficient. Then came a two-feeder Wharfedale machine, with a capacity ol 3> 000
impressions an hour; this being followed, in 1876, by a four-feeder Hoe, equal to printing
8,000 sheets an hour. In 1881 a Prestonian perfecting machine, capable of producing and
folding 10,000 complete copies of The Advertiser each hour, was set in motion by the
then Governor, Sir W. F. I). Jervois ; and on September 24, 1892, his Excellency the
Earl of Kintore started a Marinoni machine with stereotyping plant, the Prestonian being
also adapted to the same method of printing. Each successive Governor has during his
term of office been called upon to honor by his presence the inauguration of some
further advance in the mechanical equipment of The Advertiser, I hus, on Saturday,
December 12, 1896. Sir T. Fowell Buxton set in motion a splendid new Hoe machine, and
on Saturday, June 9, 1900, Lord Tennyson turned on steam to a magnificent three-reel
Hoe machine, of the very latest design, with a capacity of 24,000 copies of The
Advertiser an hour. This machine will print a paper of 24 pages with nine columns to
the page. The Advertiser has now two of these mammoth machines, in addition to a
Marinoni similar to those on which the Paris Figaro —which has the largest circulation
in the world—is printed. It was the first daily in South Australia to print from
stereotype plates, and generally its mechanical department is equipped in a fashion
equal to that of any newspaper in Australia. The setting of the paper is done by the
marvellous linotype, which is acknowledged by all who have seen it to be a triumph
of inventive skill. The gas engine, which is available in time of emergency for driving the
whole of the plant, is the largest of its class within the confines of the Commonwealth ;
but there are also two steam engines. The establishment has been lighted throughout
by electricity for many years, and indeed it was one of the Adelaide pioneers of this
system.
Although many names were associated with the inception of 'The Advertiser
its real founder was the Hon. J. H. Barrow. He was born in England, and early
developed a taste for literary pursuits. Mr. Barrow came to Adelaide in 1852, and
accepted the pastorate of the Clayton Congregational Church. He soon joined the staff
of the only Adelaide daily paper then in existence, and subsequently succeeded
the late Dr. Garran, of Sydney, as principal leader writer. Just previous to the date
on which The Advertiser came into existence, Mr. Barrow had accepted an invitation
to stand for Parliament, and his popularity and reputation were so great and
widespread that he was elected unopposed. After a short period of service in the
Assembly he retired, and stood for the Legislative Council, to which he obtained entrance
at the head of the poll in March, 1861. There he stayed until 1871, when he again
entered the Lower House as member for the Sturt, a district afterwards represented
by his partner, the late Mr. T. King. During the whole term of his Parliamentary service
Mr. Barrow not only found time to conduct the paper over which he had control, but
for 18 months he filled, with advantage to the Province, the post of Treasurer in an
Administration of which the late Sir Henry Ayers was Premier. Mr. Barrow died on
August 22, 1874, in the 58th year of his age, and it was written of him by one who had
many opportunities of judging ; —“ Few men who ever came to South Australia obtained
such a large amount of personal influence, or exerted such a large amount of political
power on the people here. Soon after his arrival in the Colony he became connected
630
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY The Advertiser


with the Press as an able and powerful writer. He had a well-stored mind, a genial
humor, and a wonderfully ready pen. I hen he was a man of broad views in politics, and
ot warm sympathies in private life. He was patient and industrious, conscientiously
working out for himself those social and political problems which rise to the surface of
our daily life. 1 here was a time when Mr. Barrow’s name was a tower of strength and
a name to conjure with. But he was not only a facile writer, but a powerful and an
eloquent speaker. In a public meeting he was supreme. Wit, humor, playful banter,
combined with a hard and irresistible logic, were all prominent in his best speeches. He
was incomparably the best public speaker in South Australia, and in his palmy days his
reign was almost omnipotent in a great gathering.” Of him politically a contemporary
writer said :—“ Mr. Barrow’s influence on public thought and political action in the Colony
has been very great. He is one of the few public men of South Australia whom it is
most difficult to replace. W hen in the Ministry his colleagues bore willing testimony to
his great capacity and large industry. His power of grasping a subject in all its bearings,
discriminating between its weakness and its strength, was very marked ; and the lucidity
ot his exposition was equal to the keenness ot his grasp. He not only saw around a
question, but into it. He was never satisfied until he had ‘bottomed’ it; and having
made it his own, he had no difficulty in showing it in the clearest light to others. He
has left his mark on the page ot our colonial history, and his name will go down to
posterity as that of one who did something to build up the political life of South Australia
on the broad foundations which others had wisely laid. They who were brought into close
J J o
relations with him had a high respect, not only for his ability, but for his kindness of
heart. Such a man was the founder and director of the paper. He passed quietly
away in his sleep one August morning. Strange to say the same month was fatal to his
successor, a still further co-incidence being the fact that he also was a Congregational
minister and pastor of Clayton Church.
Mr. Will iam Marcus became editor in March, 1872, when Mr. Barrow accepted
office as Minister of the Crown. He was born in Northumberland in 1823, and was
trained for the Congregational ministry. He continued in charge of Clayton Church
until 1865. and when he died on August jo, 1876, his remains were buried in the pretty
little cemetery clustering about its walls. He became attached to the Adelaide Press as a
leader writer in 1862, and five years later Mr. Barrow attracted him to The Advertiser.
He was a poet of no mean ability, while he won a high reputation as a lecturer on
literary, religious, and historical subjects. His name is also associated with a very complete
and interesting handbook of South Australia, which was published with the authority of the
Government. As a newspaper writer he was facile, vigorous, and outspoken. His tendenev
was to see the good in men, and he commonly took a charitable view of politicians
even when he disagreed with their opinions, but still, when he conceived it to be his duty
to speak, mere personal considerations were set aside, and the arrow shot to its mark
without any nervousness or hesitation in the aim. There was a healthy tone in all Mr-
Harcus wrote, and he carried Christianity into the feverish activity of daily journalism,
without emasculating the latter or giving a worldly taint to the former. So it came about
that when he died business men spoke ot his religion without a sneer, and preachers
delivered eulogies in which there was no reservation because of suspected backsliding. A
good, upright, cultured, generous man was Mr. Harcus.

The Advertiser ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


The post of editor was next offered to the Rev. Dr. Jefferis, who was a valued
contributor to the paper, but he declined the position, his loyal objection being that so long
as he was able it was his duty to devote himself to his clerical duties. Ihe appointment
was given to Mr. Jefferson Pickman Stow, son of the Rev. I. O. Stow, whose memory in
Adelaide is perpetuated by the Stow Memorial Congregational Church. Mr. Jefferson
Stow arrived in Adelaide with his father in 1837, and his education and journalistic training
were both colonial. As everybody knows, he is an able man, and comes of a distinguished
family, for his eldest brother, after a most successful career at the Bar and in politics,
became a judge of the Supreme Court, while a younger brother at one time held office
as Chief Secretary of the Province. Mr. Jefferson Stow himself has had a stirring life.
In 1864 he went to the Northern Territory, and he was one of a party of six who in a
small ship’s boat, appropriately named the Forlorn Hope, made the hazardous voyage of
2,000 miles round the north-western coast of Australia, from Adam Bay to Champion
Bay, 300 miles from Fremantle. He wrote an account of this adventure for The Advertiser,
and this led to his joining the staff shortly after his return. In 1884 he accepted an
appointment as a stipendiary magistrate, which he still holds. Mr. Stow, like Mr. Harcus,
has written an excellent handbook on South Australia.
Sir Langdon Bonython, M.H.R., who from 1893 to the present date has been the
sole proprietor of The Advertiser and its associated papers, and, since Mr. Stow’s departure,
has taken the entire editorial responsibility in connection with them, speaks with enthusiasm
of his predecessors, and of the excellence of the training which he received from his
beau ideal of an editor, the founder of the paper.
As already stated, the paper was started under the auspices of a company, of
which Mr. Barrow was editor and manager, Sir Henry Ayers, Mr. G. C. Hawker, M.P.,
O ✓ J
Captain Scott, and Mr. J. H. Kearn being directors, while Mr. Thomas King was
connected with the commercial department. In 1864 The Advertiser , the Chronicle , and
the Express were taken over by a syndicate of eight persons (Messrs. J. H. Barrow,
Thomas King, C. H. Goode, T. Graves, {. Counsell, W. Parkin, R. Stuckey, and G. W.
Chinner), and it was in this year that Sir Langdon Bonython left school to join the staff. The
guiding hand of Mr. Barrow governed through these changes, and in 1871 he and Mr.
King acquired the proprietorship. Three years later Mr. Barrow died, and after an
interregnum, during which Mrs. Barrow held her late husband’s share of the business, Mr.
King purchased her interest, and took into partnership Mrs. Barrow’s son, Mr. F. B.
Burden, and Sir Langdon Bonython. This was in 1879, and the papers passed into the
hands of the two last-named when Mr. King retired in September, 1884. Mr. King was
connected with the company which started The Advertiser, and it was in recognition of
his able management that he was admitted as one of the proprietary who purchased the paper.
His enterprise and business foresight were great, as was also his faith in the future of his
journal. He took much interest in public affairs, and his genial nature made him very
popular, so that when Sir Samuel Way accepted office as Chief Justice in 1876 Mr. King
had no difficulty in winning a seat for the Sturt, in which district he lived. His personal
influence caused his rapid accession to Cabinet rank, and he was Minister of Education
with Sir William Morgan from October 7, 1878, to March to, 1881, when he resigned


in order to take a health trip through America and Europe. He returned to the Province
in 1882, and next year was again returned to Parliament for his old constituency, but
lack of strength caused him again to resign in March, 1885, for the purpose of taking
another sea voyage. Mr. King died in London, at the early age of 53. Mr. Burden,
who retired from the firm in 1893, a lso died in England.
In politics The Advertiser has always wielded a powerful influence. It has ever
been on the side of the people, and has initiated many important legislative movements.
The policy it advocates is one of liberalism. The statistics of circulation show that The
Advertiser, with its associated journals, reaches every family in the Province, and naturally
its courageous and independent treatment of all public questions has much to do with
forming popular opinion. Many legislators have stepped from The Advertiser office into the
arena of active politics, and five gentlemen who have been connected with its staff have
held portfolios as Ministers of the Crown ; while others who received their early training
there now hold prominent positions on the most influential dailies in the neighboring
States. As a medium for the publication of effective advertisements the paper is justly
esteemed by commercial men, and a glance at its business columns will prove its complete
popularity with this shrewd and far-seeing class of the community. As a newspaper, The
Advertiser ranks with the best of the world’s dailies, and there is a literary finish about
its articles which has won for it a high reputation in journalistic circles. Its progress in
all departments has been rapid and continuous, and it has always evinced a laudable
determination to keep in every respect well abreast of the times. More especially has
that been the case under the control of the present proprietor, Sir Langdon Bonython, M.H.R.
Mr. Charles R. Hodge
pHE Registrar of the Adelaide University is the eldest son of the Rev. Charles
| Hodge, Congregational minister. Born at Geelong, Victoria, educated at public
and private schools, and later under the tuition of the Rev. J. Hotham, he, at
the age of 15, became engaged in commercial pursuits. In 1884 he received the
appointment of Registrar’s clerk, under Mr. J. Walter Tyas, and subsequently was
promoted to the position of Deputy Registrar. On the retirement of Mr. 1 yas, in 1892,
Mr. Hodge was made Registrar. In 1899 he published a guide to the University of
Adelaide. For some years he was actively engaged in literary society work, being a
member of the Executive Committee of the South Australian Literary Societies’ Union.
Elocution, essay writing, and debates were the subjects with which he was particularly
identified, and he was successful in winning a prize lor elocution at the competition in 1885,
and a prize for novelette in 1890. He wrote an article on “ Literary Competitions,” being a
review of this branch of the Union’s work, for the; conference of Literary Societies’ I nions
held in Melbourne in 1890. In the wider realms of literature he has been a frequent
contributor of short stories for the daily press, under the noin de plume of L -no. “ Olive
Temple,” which ran through the Express some years ago, was revised and published last
year under the title of “ That Codicil,” which India and the Colonies describes as a
“ thoroughly interesting, highly original, and altogether wholesome story.”

Arthur Wellington Ware, C.M.G.
rH L late Mr. C. J. Ware arrived in South Australia in the early days. For some
years he carried on a brewery business at Kooringa, and owned a large station
property east of the Burra, named World’s End. He came to Adelaide in
1869 as proprietor of the Exchange Hotel in Hindley Street. Mr. Ware died two years
later, and Mrs. Ware continued
active association with the house
right up to the time of her death
in April, 1898. Of the Exchange
I lotel and its historical associations
much might be written, carrying
the reader back to the days when
it was no infrequent sight to see
several yoke ol oxen bogged in
Hindley Street. Those were times
before macadamised roads were in
vogue. Arthur Wellington Ware
was born at Burra. South Australia,
on February 25, 186 1, and received
his education at Mr. Young’s school
and Whinham College. After a
period spent in the Government
Locomotive Works and as an
employe of Messrs. Harrold
Brothers, he and his brother, the
late Mr. T. L. Ware, founded the
Torrenside Brewery, which, from
a small beginning, grew to a large
affair, and quite recently was
amalgamated with three other
breweries, under the name of the
Walkerville Co-Operative Brewing
Company. Mr. Ware carries on
a large stud and agricultural farm at “Craiglee,” Manoora, in connection with his brothers,
George J. and Charles B. Ware. Air. Ware has enjoyed several years’ experience of
municipal life. Entering the City Council in 1891, he served for two years as Councillor
for Gawler Ward and three years as Alderman. In 1898 he was chosen Mayor, being-
re-elected in 1899 and 1900. During the visit of H.R.H. the Duke of Cornwall and
York to Australia, in connection with the opening in Melbourne of the Federal Parliament
of the Commonwealth, the chief magistrates of the capital cities of the various States were
included in the list of honors conferred in celebration of the event, Air Ware being made
a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George.

APPENDIX H
Notes on the
Constitution of South Australia
the Hon. Sir R. C. Baker, K.C.M.G.,
President of the Legislative Council , etc., etc.
It is proposed to briefly formulate the legal theory of the Constitution of the Province of
South Australia, to indicate how widely different the constitutional practice is from such
legal theory, to examine the sources of such Constitution, and to consider some of its
most important aspects.
Preliminary
Most men, if asked what the political Constitution of South Australia was, would no doubt
think that they had enabled the questioner to ascertain for himself by stating that it was
to be found in the Constitution Act and its amendments, and the various electoral and
other local Acts relating to the election and constitution of the two Houses of Parliament.
Any such answer would be wofully incorrect. These Acts only partly define the constitution
and powers of the two Houses of Parliament; leave absolutely untouched the relation of
the Governor to the Crown and to the local Parliament; leave almost untouched the
powers and rights commonly called “prerogatives” of the Crown; only inferentially touch
upon the duties, powers, and functions of the responsible advisers of the Governor,
commonly called the Ministry ; and are, in point of fact, only alterations of and additions to
a pre-existing political Constitution which, as altered and added to, still exists.
No doubt the provisions contained in and the effects which have resulted from
our Constitution Act are of overwhelming constitutional importance, but that is an entirely
different thing to being “the Constitution of South Australia.”
To rightly understand a subject it must be studied from all aspects, and especially
so when the theory and reality are not only widely divergent, but absolutely contradictory.
It might be suggested that in such a case any review and study of the theory might be
safely neglected, and the reality alone considered ; but—as will be abundantly clear later
on to make the reality clear and understandable the theory must be also stated and
understood.
It may be pointed out in passing that in this Province, where every man and
woman has a share in the government and can rise to any position in the State, it is an
anomaly that our system of State education does not embrace, at all events, an elementary
J J J
study of our own Constitution.
J


Definition of the word “unconstitutional’
As it will be necessary to frequently use the word unconstitutional, and as that is a word
which has different meanings in different parts of the British dominions, it may be as well
to now define the sense in which it is used in these notes. Ihe best explanation or its
proper meaning in England is given by Professor Hearn, who says :
“ Whenever experience and the proved utility of any mode of exercising any
discretionary power are such as to raise a reasonable expectation in the
public mind that these powers will continue to be so used, any deviation
from the customary method which tends to defeat this expectation, and rests
mainly on the ground of actual ability to so deviate, is unconstitutional.”
But, as Professor Dicey shows, the word may have another meaning in the United States
J ' J o ' # #
and in the self-governing colonies. In those countries, when a law is passed in violation
of the provisions of their respective “Constitutions” it is an “unconstitutional law,” whilst
in Great Britain, where the sovereignty is vested in the Queen in Parliament, any such
phrase would be unmeaning.
The word will be used in the meaning defined by Professor Hearn.
An Act may be illegal and unconstitutional, but it is not necessarily illegal because
it is unconstitutional. As an illustration of the English meaning of this word, Lord Glenelg
once officially declared “ that British Parliamentary legislation on any subject of exclusive
local concern to any British colony possessing a representative assembly is, as a general
rule, unconstitutional.” There can be no doubt of the [tower of the British Parliament to
interfere by legislation in the local concerns of South Australia, but In our meaning of the
word it would be unconstitutional for the British Parliament to exercise that power.
Theory of government in England by King in Council
As our Constitution Act and all its results are grafts on a pre-existing Constitution,
and as that pre-existing Constitution —at all events as it existed at the time when
this Province was originally “ erected ” (that is the word used in the first Imperial
Act founding South Australia) —was the result of centuries of practice and political
evolution in Great Britain, it will be necessary, in order to grasp the fundamental principles
of our subject, to formulate the theory which underlies the Constitution of Great Britain,
especially of that branch of it which refers to the government of colonies acquired by
settlement.
For a long time after the Norman Conquest, the King in his Great Council
called the Parliament (of which the House of Lords is the historical survivor) was, both
in theory and in practice, the Sovereign of England. It was then not the duty, but the
privilege of the Crown to ask for advice; and the Great Council of the King was really
his adviser and not his dictator. He presided in and over this Council, and with its advice
was supposed to perform all the business of the realm legislative, judicial, and executive.
I his system (it it ever really existed in its entirety) must have soon become unworkable,
on account of the diversity and multiplicity of the business transacted, and there
must have been a tendency in the Great Council to differentiate itself into various
committees or sub-committees, each theoretically advising the King in various branches


of the government, but each practically transacting that part of the business in which
it was expert, subject to the power of the King to intervene. And not only did
this happen, but as the Great Council of Parliament, which was mainly comprised of the
“magnates” or “the great men” (the Lords), could not be continually in session, other
Councils of the King gradually developed themselves, and amongst them a small perpetual
Council arose, which contained the germ of what we now call the Privy Council, and
which, like all the King’s Councils in those days, exercised judicial, legislative, and
executive functions.
Ihe Great Council of Parliament, however, still retained its position as adviser
to the Crown in matters of legislation in England, and at a somewhat uncertain date
(fixed by Sir William Charley at 1275) bifurcated into the Lords and Commons, who still
in theory advise the Crown what new laws shall be made or old laws altered or repealed.
Ihe King’s Councillors in matters of judicature became the judges ; his Councillors in
the collection and management of the revenues of the Crown became the Exchequer
Chamber, which, by gradually devoting its attention to functions of judicature and
1 - . , r • ° J J
abandoning its function of executive, became the Court of Exchequer ; and his Continual
Council, or concilium ordinanum , gradually became what we now call the Privy Council, a
committee of which, “The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,” exercised, and still
exercises, jurisdiction in matters of judicature; and of which other committees, or
substitutes for committees, such as the Ministry, the Board of Trade, etc., exercised, and
still exercise, jurisdiction in executive matters.
Our ancestors were not possessed of the idea which we now so strongly hold,
that there should be a separation of legislative, executive, and judicial power —in fact, such
an idea would have been altogether foreign to their minds, and has been the growth and
result of centuries of experience.
We had an illustration of the old idea that all Councils should exercise both
legislative, judicial, and executive jurisdiction in our first South Australian Council, which was
both legislative, executive, and judicial; which made laws, acted as adviser to the Governor
in all executive matters, and, presided over by the Governor, sat as a Court of Local
Appeal. The two Houses of Parliament constituted under our Constitution Act have taken
away from this Council all power over matters of legislation, but it still retains its executive
and judicial functions.
Our courts of law are a further illustration of the survival of the theory that the
King in Council is the sovereign power and administrator in all matters both legislative,
executive, and judicial.
Her Majesty the Queen is still (in theory) supposed to preside in all the superior
courts of law in all her dominions ; the writs are still issued summoning the person
mentioned therein to appear in the name of “ Victoria, by the grace of God,” etc. ; and
the words “court" and “suitor" still remain as historical evidences of the time when the
King, surrounded by his courtiers, administered justice to his suitors. (Suitors or followers
originally meant and included all the followers who composed the court of the King
plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses, jurors, etc.)
The original title of the Court of King’s Bench was “ Curia Regis coram Rege
ipse" —“the court of the King before the very King himself.” At one time the King
actually presided in the court and administered justice by the advice of his advisers in
matters of judicature the judges ; and even as late as 1876, when the Appellate Jurisdiction
Act was passed regulating the appeals from all the courts of the United Kingdom to the
House of Lords (practically to a committee of that House consisting of the Law Lords)
this appeal was described as an appeal to “ Her Majesty the Queen in her Court of
Parliament.”

ConstotKlLW..™,* ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


“ Bills,” theory of
As an example proving that the two Houses of Parliament formerly were, and still
theoretically are, only legislative advisers of the Crown, and that the Crown, still in theory,
makes all laws, let us consider the past history and present practice of law-making.
Formerly, if it was, and at present, if it is, proposed to make a new law, or alter
an old one, what is called a Pill was or is introduced into one of the Houses of Parliament.
This word Pill was originally “ Pilla,” and one of its meanings was “a petition ; indeed,
its use to signify a petition survived in the Court of Chancery until a few years ago, when
petitions in Chancery praying for relief were called “ Pills.”
These Pills were originally what the word indicates —they were petitions presented
to the King by the Houses of Parliament asking him to make a law. I hese petitions did
not originally contain the words of the new law which the Houses of Parliament wished
made ; they simply stated the grievance which the King was asked to remedy, and the law
to remedy such grievance was supposed to be drawn up by the judges (who were then
officers of Parliament) and made by the King after the session of Parliament was
over. Sometimes, however, the King took no notice of these petitions, and sometimes the
law purporting to be made in answer to the prayer of the petitioners was widely different
from the wishes of the Houses of Parliament, and sometimes the King made laws which the
Houses of Parliament had not petitioned for. It was not until the time of Henry V. that
the Commons prayed that “no addition or diminution should in future be made, nor
alteration in them, which should change the true intent of their petition, without their
assent.” This petition was assented to by the King, but the King did not strictly adhere
to his promise, and consequently in the reign of Henry VI. the practice was adopted of
inserting in the petition the precise words of the law the King was asked to make. The
Bill or petition was then called Billa in se continens acta “ a petition containing in itself
the things which are required to be done.”
And that phraseology Anglicised and shortened into “A Bill for an Act” is still
used all over the world where British Parliamentary institutions exist.
Although, as time rolled on, the power ol the Crowm diminished, and the King
was constrained to pass the law in the exact words demanded by the Houses of Parliament,
the theory remains to this day that the Crown makes the laws ; the enacting clause of all
the statutes states that the statute is made by the Crown (or its representative the Governor)
with the advice and consent of the Houses of Parliament.
The original petition was, up to late years, always, and in many cases still
is, part of the Bill. The petition has survived as “ the preamble,” which recites the
reasons for making the law. Preambles have, in the course ot centuries, become shorter
and shorter, and now have almost ceased to exist, except in private Bills, in which Bills
Parliamentary practice requires that the petition or reason for making the law should be
fully set forth under the name of preamble, and should be proved before the Select Committee
to whom the Bill is referred. The Select Committee cannot consider the provisions of the
Bill until the truth of the statements contained in the preamble has been proved. In
public Bills the preamble is considered after all the clauses of the Bill have been gone
th rough.
In public Bills the Committee first decides what kind of a Bill it will ask the
Crown to make, and then gives its reasons for so doing ; in private Bills the reasons for
the Bill are first arrived at, and then the provisions of the Bill are made to fit with the
reasons which have been found to be proved.


Ihe expressions that the Queen assents to or vetoes a Bill, although accurately
describing the reality, are not correct if we consider the theory. The words used when a
Bill is assented to by Her Majesty are (in the old Norman-French still employed) “La Reyne
le veult —“ Ihe Queen wills it or, if she wishes to exercise what is miscalled her veto,
she says, “La Reyne savisera" —that is, “The Queen will think about it.”
1 his question of Bills illustrates how widely divergent theory is from reality.
Ihe reality is that the Crown has no real power at all in the making of laws. If tlie
two Houses ol Parliament agree, the Bill which results from such agreement becomes law
in England as a matter of course. The miscalled power of veto has never been exercised
thus since 1707, when the Crown refused to make the Scotch Militia Bill, which had
been agreed to by both Houses of the Imperial Parliament, into a law ; and in South
Australia there has not been since 1857 any instance of a local Bill passed by both Houses,
to which the Governor was clearly empowered by his instructions to assent, failing to
become law.
King in Council in theory governs settled colonies with no
Parliamentary Constitution
The King, however, had other dominions beside England, and as the King’s Council of
Parliament was originally his adviser for England only, he ruled and governed other parts
ot his dominions, such as Ireland, Normandy, or Jersey, either with or without the advice
of other Councils.
Lord Mansfield, in the celebrated case of Campbell v. Hall, said ;—“ Whatever
changes were made in the laws of Gascony, Guyenne, and Calais must have been made
by the King’s authority ; if by Act of Parliament, that Act of Parliament would be
extant, for they were conquered in the reign of King Edward III.”
There are no such Acts. That is to say, the King made laws for those countries
without the advice or consent of the Houses of Parliament.
No doubt there always has been a distinction drawn between conquered countries
and colonies acquired by the settlement therein of the subjects of the King, but this
distinction has no bearing on the fact that the English Parliament was not the King’s
. . .
adviser in matters ol legislation outside of England. Subject to certain rights of the
colonists themselves in reference to taxation, etc., it was settled and established that in
any of the dominions of the King which had been acquired by the settlement therein of
his subjects, and which had consequently no local civilised form of government except
such as was introduced by such settlement, the sovereign power was vested in the King
with the advice of his Privy Council.
So that originally in theory the King in Parliament was the Sovereign of Great
Britain, and the King in his Privy Council was the Sovereign of His Majesty’s colonies
acquired by settlement.
This statement is illustrated by the fact that, even to this day, the ultimate court
J ’ J
of appeal from all judicial decisions in Great Britain is to the House of Lords ; that is
to say, to the Queen in Parliament, which, even as late as the Appellate Jurisdiction Act
of 1876, is described as “ Her Majesty the Queen in her Court of Parliament,” and that
from all the colonies the ultimate court of appeal is to the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council -that is, to the Queen in her Privy Council.


But this statement must now be modified. Ihe gradual diminution of the power
of the King and the increase ol the power of the House ol Commons has, centuries ago,
resulted in the predominance of the British Houses of Parliament, which have acquired
the power of over-riding the King in Privy Council, so that now the theory must be stated
as follows
The King in Privy Council, subject to the King in Parliament, rules and governs
those of his colonies which have been acquired by settlement until such colonies have
acquired Constitutions of their own by virtue ol Imperial Acts of Parliament.
And it ol course follows that when the Imperial Parliament has once granted a
Constitution to a colony, the powers ol the Crown in reference to alterations ol the
Constitution of that colony are abrogated and disappear. It it were not so. the Crown
would be able to vary or over-ride an Act of the Imperial Parliament.
And the statement must be still further modified, because it has become settled
and determined by decisions of the highest courts ol Great Britain that, when a colony
has acquired a legislative Constitution by grant from the Crown, the Crown cannot take
away or alter such Constitution.
J
We have it on the highest authority that “after a colony has received legislative
institutions the Crown (subject to the special provision ol any Act of Parliament) stands in
the same relation to that colony or settlement as it does to the United Kingdom.
“ Crown colonies,” theory of government
The Imperial Parliament, in the early clays of British colonisation, did not interfere ;
in fact, it was then considered that the Imperial Parliament had no power to
interfere. When a Bill to legislate concerning; colonial matters was first introduced, the
o o
Ministry declared to the House of Commons “that this Bill was not proper for this House,
as it concerned America”; and the King, by the advice of his Privy Council, established
constitutions and made laws in British colonies acquired by settlement.
The first “deviation from this general usage” was made in 1791, when, in
consequence of the want of power in the Crown to impart to the Roman Catholic
population of the Canadas certain privileges which it was considered expedient they should
possess, an Act of the Imperial Parliament was passed imparting such privileges and
establishing a Constitution for that colony.
O J
The King appointed agents (generally called Governors) to rule in his name and on
his behalf, and generally constituted and established local councils to advise such Governors.
Sometimes these councils were nominated direct from England ; sometimes they were
O J
appointed by the Governor himself; and sometimes they were elected, either partly or
wholly, by the people of the new country.
The King established courts of justice (subject, however, to the qualification that
such courts must not be of a novel description, and must administer justice on the lines
of the recognised British courts). He regulated trade and commerce, and otherwise ruled
and governed these settlements. The Crown was the owner of all land, which it granted
to its subjects on such terms as it thought fit. No country could be settled without
authority from the Crown, and the lands of the colonies were considered part of the “ royal
demesnes.” Territories in North America were granted “as part of our manor of East
Greenwich in Kent,” and the proceeds of such land and of all the other revenues which
were received in such new country were the property of the Crown.


As has been before stated, the judges of Great Britain have established this
principle : that when once the Crown has granted a Constitution to a colony, and conferred
representative institutions on the people of such colony, the Crown cannot take away the
rights granted or alter such Constitution ; and in order to maintain and continue the right
of the Privy Council to advise the Crown, notwithstanding the appointment of local
councils, there is usually inserted in the Constitutions of such colonies a clause reserving
the power to legislate by “Order in Council,” that is to say, by order made by the Crown
with the advice of the Privy Council.
Pi ivy Council
J
In course of time the Privy Council (becoming unwieldy on account of the number
of its members, which continually increased, and the multiplicity of the business it
transacted) acted through committees ; and the King’s prerogative in respect to his
colonies was, and in fact still is, exercised through a committee of the Privy Council.
Perhaps some one may demur to the statement, and point out that the Crown’s colonial
adviser has sometimes in the past been the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, or the
Secretary of State for War, and that its present adviser is the Secretary of State for
the Colonies. I 7 or all that, the statement is correct. There may be a committee of one
as well as of several, and the officials I have mentioned have advised, and still advise,
the Crown in reference to colonial affairs as members of the Privy Council.
When this Colony was founded the prerogative was exercised in colonial affairs
through “the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies,” and it was not until 1854
(in consequence of the strain on the department caused by the Crimean War) that a separate
Secretary of State for the Colonies was appointed.
There was, however, then in existence (established in 1782) a Consultative
Committee of the Privy Council, who advised the Crown in colonial matters, commonly
called the “Committee of Trade and P'oreign Plantations,” and it was in pursuance of a
report from that body dated April 4, 1849, that we obtained our Constitution Act.
Laws in force on the settlement of a colony
The first charter to found a colony granted by a British Sovereign was granted in 1578
by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Humphrey Gilbert. He was given power to take possession
of “all remote and barbarous lands,” and to make laws to govern any lands he acquired;
but there was a proviso. It was provided that “all who settled there should have and
enjoy all the privileges of free citizens and natives of England, any law, custom, or usage
to the contrary.”
The law which was enforced in such country was the common law of England at
the time of settlement, and such part of the statute law as was applicable to its conditions.
As Mr. Chitty puts it:—“lf an unsettled country be discovered and peopled by
British subjects, they are supposed to possess themselves of it for the benefit of the
Sovereign but carrying their nationality with them the settlers claimed the right of
Englishmen ; they claimed to be governed by the law of England.


As Mr. Burge puts it : “Certain subjects of England, by consent of their Prince,
go and possess an uninhabited desert country ; the common law must be supposed to be
their rule, as it was their birthright. When they went thither they no more abandoned
their English laws than they did their natural allegiance.”
And as Governor Pownall puts it “ The plantations were settled on the King’s
lands by the King’s licence and grant. The Constitution and frame of government was
framed by the King’s charter and commission, and the colonials, understanding themselves
as removed out of the realm, considered themselves in their executive and legislative
capacity of government in immediate connection and subordinate to the King, their only
sovereign lord but “ the idea was that all their settlements were the colonial possessions
of England,” and that the King in his Privy Council was their Sovereign.
The Crown, on the advice of the Privy Council, could, prior to the grant of a
colonial Constitution, and after such grant, and on the advice of its local “ Council ot
Legislature,” either directly or indirectly by its agent the Governor, alter any of these
laws and make new ones, provided they w T ere not repugnant to the law of England.
It is curious to note that this maxim that no law should be repugnant to the law
of England which was originally regarded by colonists as the chief bulwark of their
liberties came in later years to be looked upon as an offensive curtailment of their rights
of self-Pfovernment.
Historical resume from foundation of the Province
to the Constitution Act (1836 to 1856)
It is hoped that these preliminary remarks are sufficient to enable the reader to understand
the position when South Australia was first “ erected and established ” as a Province or
Colony.
The King could probably have “erected and established” South Australia as a
Colony without the aid of any Act of the Imperial Parliament, but there v-ere several
reasons why it was expedient to invoke that aid, of which two only need be mentioned :
(a) There were grounds for contending that the land comprising the proposed
Province was under the jurisdiction of the Government of New South
Wales, and if that was so, inasmuch as New South Wales had been
established as a British colony long before 1834; and the British Parliament
had given a Constitution to that colony ; it would not have been competent
for the King to abrogate that Constitution and to grant a new Constitution
to and make new laws for South Australia.
The practice initiated in 1791 of obtaining Imperial Acts for the establishment
of colonies had become established.
Accordingly in 1834 an Imperial Act was passed authorising His Majesty, with
the advice of his Privy Council, to “ erect and establish ” South Australia into a British
Province, and to authorise and empower one or more persons resident in such Province
to make such laws and to impose such taxes and to constitute such courts as might be
necessary for the peace, order, and good government of the people of the Province.
I his Act also gave power to the King, with the advice of the Privy Council,
to appoint Colonisation Commissioners, who were to have the control of the lands of the
Crown in the Province.


In pursuance ot the powers given by the Act, this Province was in 1836 “erected
and established,” and a Governor, a Judge, seven Commissioners, and other officials, were
appointed. Ihe Governor, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice, the Colonial Secretary,
the Advocate-General, and the Resident Commissioners, or any two of them, was authorised
to make laws and impose taxes.
As all the land in the Province wxis the property of the Crown, and as sales were
to be made and the proceeds accruing therefrom managed by the Commissioners, there
was to a certain extent a dual authority. This did not work well, and in 1838 the
J ’ kJ
authority of the Resident Commissioners was abolished.
The Province of South Australia was governed pursuant to this Constitution
which I have so briefly indicated till January 21, 1843.
In 1842 the Imperial Parliament passed two Acts repealing the Act of 1834, and
authorising Her Majesty to constitute within the Province of South Australia either one of
three different Councils of Legislature. These were :
(c?) A nominated Legislative Council, consisting of the Governor and seven other
persons.
(< b ) A nominated Legislative Council, with an elected House of Assembly.
(r) A mixed House of Legislature, to be partly nominated and partly elected, in
such proportions as Her Majesty thought fit.
It was the first of these forms of Councils of Legislature which was brought into
operation by Her Majesty; and from June 15. 1845, to fuly 21, 1851, the Province of
South Australia was ruled by the Governor and a nominated Legislature, consisting in all
of eight members. As the two other alternative forms of Councils of Legislature were
never brought into existence, it is unnecessary to further refer to them.
In 1849 Her Majesty’s consultative advisers in colonial matters were a committee
of the Privy Council, called “ The Committee for the consideration of all matters relating
to Trade and Foreign Plantations.” This committee, on April 4, 1849, presented to Her
Majesty a long and able report, recommending that extended powers of self-government
should be granted to the Australian colonies; and in pursuance of such report (in 1849-50)
the Imperial Parliament passed an Act, commonly called the Enabling Act, Section VII. of
which authorised “ the Legislature then by law r established within the Colony of South
Australia” to establish a Legislative Council, to consist of such members, not exceeding
24, as should be thought fit, one-third of whom were to be appointed by Her
Majesty, and two-thirds of whom were to be elected; Section XIV. gave to the
Governor, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council so to be established,
authority to make laws for the peace, welfare, and good government of the Province.
A Legislative Council of 24 members constituted as indicated was established in
1851, which continued as the advisers of the Crown in matters of legislation until 1856.
But the Enabling Act contained further provisions in reference to the local Legislature.
It enacted by Section XXXII. that it should be lawful for the Governor and the partly-
nominated and partly-elected Legislative Council, after its establishment by an Act or Acts,
to establish in the Province, in lieu of such Legislative Council, “a Council and a House
of Representatives or other separate Legislative Houses, to consist respectively of such
members, to be appointed or elected respectively by such persons, and in such manner as
by such Act or Acts shall be determined, and to vest in such Council or House of
Representatives, or other Legislative Houses, the powers and functions of the Legislative
Council for which the same may be substituted.” Any Act passed for this purpose had
to be reserved for Her Majesty’s consent, and laid before both Houses of the Imperial
Parliament for at least 30 days before such consent was given.


In 1853 the Legislative Council, in pursuance of Section XXXII. of this Enabling
Act, passed a Bill for an Act constituting a bi-cameral Legislature for South Australia
a Legislative Council to be nominated by the Crown not being fewer than 12 in number,
and a House of Assembly of 36 members to be elected by the people.
This Bill of 1853 was reserved for Her Majesty’s assent, and disallowed on the
ground that the Legislature had exceeded its powers by regulating or limiting the Crown’s
right of disallowance of Bills which might thereafter be passed by the proposed bi-cameral
Legislature.
It will be seen (by the quoted words of Section XXXII. of the Enabling Act) that
the only thing which the Governor and Council were authorised to do by that section was to
establish two Houses instead of one, and to give to the two Houses the powers and
functions of the one House. They went beyond that power, and therefore their action
was invalid. A similar mistake was made in New South Wales and Victoria (for the
Enabling Act applied to those colonies as well as to South Australia) ; and it was only
in Tasmania that a Bill was passed within the scope of the powers given by the Imperial
Parliament.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies sent to the Governor a copy of the
Tasmanian Act, and our Constitution Act, drafted on that model, was passed and assented
to. This Act, it is true, does something (very little, however) beyond establishing and
constituting two Houses instead of one ; but it must not be overlooked that the Governor
and the old Legislative Council had authority by Section XIV. ot the Enabling Act to
O J J
make laws for the peace, welfare, and good government of the Province ; and the provisions
of our Constitution Act which are not within the authority given by Clause XXXII. were
J J
passed under and justified by Clause XIV. of the Enabling Act.
Epitome of Constitution Act
It was in pursuance of this dual statutory power (the Act itself bearing evidence of the
two sources of the powers under which it was made) that our Constitution Act was passed.
Its main object was to establish and constitute two elected Houses instead of one partly-
nominated, partly-elected House, and to vest the law-making power, which was formerly
vested in the Governor with the advice and consent of the old Legislative Council, in
the Governor with the advice of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly ; in
O ’
a word, to establish and constitute a bi-cameral Legislature instead of a uni-cameral
Legislature.
As to the vast importance of this alteration there can be no two opinions ; but
the Act did not establish, or purport to establish, a Constitution in South Australia- it was
a graft on an existing Constitution. The Act to a very small extent determined the
respective powers and functions of the two Houses so established and constituted. It did
not even fix electoral districts or provide any electoral machinery.
No law-making power was ever given to this bi-cameral Legislature except by
inference, and to this day our laws are made in pursuance of the powers given by the
Enabling Act, which enacts that the Governor, with the advice and consent of the old
Legislative Council, may make laws. In the bi-cameral Legislature, established instead of
the uni-cameral Legislative Council, are vested the powers and functions of that Council ;
therefore, the Governor now makes laws with the advice and consent of the Legislative
Council and House of Assembly,
J


In lact, the Act was never intended to be, and is not, even the skeleton of a
complete Constitution.
In addition, however, to the main object of the Constitution Act, viz., the
establishment and constitution ot the two Houses (including the definition to a small extent
ot their respective powers ; the qualification of the electors and the elected ; their duration
in time, etc., etc.), some other matters of great importance were enacted in pursuance of
the powers (given by Clause XIV. of the Enabling Act) to make laws for the peace,
welfare, and good government of the Province. These included :
(ct) Power to the bi-cameral Legislature to alter the Act itself, with a proviso that:-
“ It shall not be lawful to present to the Governor for Her Majesty’s
consent any Hill by which an alteration in the Constitution of the said
Legislative Council or House of Assembly may be made unless the
second and third reading of such Bill shall have been passed with the
concurrence of an absolute majority of the whole number of the
members of the Legislative Council and of the Assembly respectively :
Provided also that any Bill which shall be so presented shall be reserved
for the signification of Her Majesty’s pleasure thereon.”
(<£) The subordination of the power of the Governor to his advisers by providing
that :
1. All appointments of Government officers, except the appointment of
certain officers who it was enacted must be members of Parliament,
viz., the Chief Secretary, the Attorney - General, the Treasurer,
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration, and Commissioner of
Public Works, were to be made by the Governor’s advisers. This
was done inferentially by stating that the Governor was to make the
appointments by the advice of the Executive Council.
2. All control of the expenditure of the Province was to be taken from the
Governor. This was also done inferentially by providing that warrants
authorising expenditure were to be countersigned by the Chief Secretary.
(r) The formulation of those prerogatives of the Crown which vest in the Sovereign
(or his representative, the Governor) the power to call councils of Legislature
together, and to dissolve same (so far as they are liable to be dissolved).
(T) That Parliament should be called together once at least in every year.
( e ) That the judges should be independent of the Executive.
if) Inferentially that the Executive advisers of the Crown should be members of
Parliament, and positively that no one else holding any office of profit or
pension from the Crown, except such Executive advisers, should be members
of Parliament.
(o) That the old theory, now so rudely contradicted by practice, that the revenues
of the Province are the revenues of the Crown, and cannot be appropriated to
any specific purpose except with the previous consent of the Crown, should
still survive as a theory.


Section I. of the Constitution Act
There is a proviso to Section I. of the Constitution Act which is most important. It
runs as follows : —“ Provided that all Bills for appropriating any part of the revenue of the
said Province, or for imposing, altering, or repealing any tax, rate, duty, or impost, shall
originate in the House of Assembly.” This proviso was inserted because of an imagined
analogy between the Legislative Council and the House of Lords on the one hand, and
the Commons and the House of Assembly on the other hand ; and it formulated one of
the constitutional British maxims in reference to what are vaguely called Money Bills.
That there never was or could be any such analogy, the following considerations clearly
show :
1. The House of Lords is non-elective ; the members sit either by hereditary
right or by nomination by the Crown.
The Council is elected by the people.
2. The Lords represent only their own order.
The members of the Council represent their constituents.
3. The Lords are a Court of Record ; they have jurisdiction in cases of
impeachment, and committees of the whole body have jurisdiction in
other cases.
The Legislative Council is not a court, except as to questions arising concerning
its privileges, and, except in relation to such questions, has no jurisdiction of
judicature.
4. That part of the British Constitution which defines the relationship of the two
Houses to each other is unwritten, and consists of the accumulated practice
of centuries.
The Legislative Council is the creation of Statute law.
5. The British Constitution has always been, and is still, changeable and varying,
usurpations by one or other of the three bodies which compose it having
at different times altered the balance of power ; the predominant partner
has been at different times, the Crown, the Lords, the Commons.
The powers of the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly are fixed
by the Constitution Act, and cannot be altered except by an alteration of
that Act.
6. In the House of Lords the Church is represented by the Lords Spiritual.
The Church is not, and cannot be, represented in the Legislative Council, as
by Section XXXVI. of the Constitution Act, “no clergyman or officiating
minister shall be capable of being elected a member.”
7. The Crown cannot send back to the House of Lords a Bill which has passed
both Houses and been presented to Her Majesty for her assent, and request
the Lords to make amendments in such Bill.
The Governor can transmit to the Legislative Council, by message, “ any
amendment which he shall deem to be needed in any Bill presented to
him for Her Majesty’s assent.”
8. If any analogy can be or ought to be drawn (which is denied), the Legislative
Council is analogous to the House of Commons. It was, in 1857, elected
by the people on a considerably more extended franchise than the House
of Commons, and its constituents pay the great bulk of the taxation.


So far as relates to the relative powers and privileges of the tw r o Houses, if any
analogy at all could have been drawn, it should have been drawn between the Legislative
Council and the House of Commons.
Ihe number of registered electors for the Legislative Council in 1857 at the first
election was 10,092. Ihe estimated population in 1857 was 109,917 ; so that the
proportion of electors for the Legislative Council to population was 1 for every 12,
including women and children. In 1862 the number of electors for the House of Commons
was 1,187,897; the population was 29,204,983, or 1 in 24.
Ihe Council in South Australia represented, as did the Commons in England,
that portion of the population which paid the greater part of the taxation, and the Assembly
was not analogous to any existing body in the mother country. This, however, is perhaps
ot only historical interest. Ihe proviso to Section I. before mentioned was inserted, and
in 1857 a dispute arose as to its true meaning and as to the true meaning and
interpretation of the Constitution Act of 1855-6 generally. The Tonnage Duties Repeal
Bill was originated in the House of Assembly. It repealed a tax on the tonnage of
shipping and substituted a wharfage rate. Ihe Bill was amended in the ordinary manner
by the Legislative Council. When the amendments were received by the House of
Assembly a question of privilege was raised. The House of Assembly declared that it was
a breach of privilege by the Legislative Council to “modify any Money Bill passed by the
House.” To which the Council rejoined that it had “an undoubted right to make
amendments in all Bills whatsoever sent up to the Council by the House of Assembly.”
This dispute was, after many messages between the two Houses and protracted
debates, finally settled by a compromise, commonly called “The Compact of 1857.”
The dispute was whether or not the Council had the right to amend in the
ordinary manner Bills which the Constitution Act said must originate in the Assembly.
This “Compact” defines those Bills, which the Council cannot amend in the ordinary
way, as being “ all Bills the object of which shall be to raise money, whether by way of
loan or otherwise, or to warrant the expenditure of any portion of the same,” and provides
that “it shall be competent for the Council to suggest any alteration in any such Bill
(except that portion of the Appropriation Bill that provides for the ordinary annual expenses
of the Government).”
If the “ Compact ” was literally construed it would authorise the Council to amend
or alter all clauses in Bills which are not “ Suggestion Bills,” even though those clauses
impose taxes or appropriate revenue, and would prohibit the Council from making any
amendment at all except by way of suggestion in “ Suggestion Bills,” even though the
clauses proposed to be amended had nothing to do with money.
But it must, however, be read and considered as illustrated and modified bv the
messages between the Houses of which the “Compact” itself forms a part.
And its results, as construed in practice, are as follows :
(a) All Bills for appropriating (i.e., whose primary object is to appropriate) revenue,
or for imposing, altering, or repealing (as above) any tax, rate, duty, or
impost, must originate in the House of Assembly.
(, b ) Any other Bill can be introduced in either House.
(r) If a Bill is introduced in the Council, the primary object of which is not to
appropriate revenue, or to impose, alter, or vary any tax, rate, duty, or
impost, but which contains, or ought to contain, in order to carry same
into effect, clauses of that nature, such clauses should either be not inserted
or struck out in committee and inserted in the House of Assembly.
J


[(/) Bills to alter or reduce any tax, rate, duty, or impost must originate in the
House of Assembly, but can be amended by the Council in the ordinary
manner.
(e) The Council can make any amendments in any Bill received from the House
of Assembly, so long as such amendments do not touch the parts of the
Bill which raise money or appropriate revenue.
(/) Any clause in a Bill from the House of Assembly, or series of clauses, the
object of which is, or are, to raise money or warrant its expenditure, if
the same can be segregated from the rest of the Bill, may be struck out
by the Council by way of amendment.
Any clause or series of clauses which merely alter or repeal a tax, rate, duty,
or impost, and does or do not increase the tax, etc., can be dealt with by
the Council by way of amendment.
(/£) If the Council desire to alter any clause which raises money by way of loan
or taxation, or appropriates revenue, such alteration must be by way of
suggestion.
(/) If a suggestion is agreed to, the Bill is not taken out of committee, and the
committee has leave to sit again on receipt of a reply from the House of
Assembly.
(j) Hitherto amendments and suggestions have not been made in the same Bill,
but this is no reason why this should not be done, the message forwarding
the suggestion informing the Assembly that, in addition to the suggestion,
the Council reserves its right to forward at a later stage amendments to
the House of Assembly in those parts of the Bill which the Council has
a right to amend.
If the Assembly adopts the suggestions, and introduces them in the Bill,
the amendments would then be sent to the Assembly at a later stage,
viz., upon the third reading in the Council.
(/£) When the House of Assembly receives a Bill in which the Council has made
a suggestion to which the House of Assembly has agreed, the House of
Assembly treats the Bill as if it were a new Bill ; but the Council treats
the Bill as if the Bill had been amended by the House of Assembly, and
proceeds in committee as if the Bill had been originally sent from the House
of Assembly as amended.
(/) If the House of Assembly does not agree to the suggestion made by the
Council, and the Council refuses to give way, the Bill “shall be either
assented to or rejected as originally passed by the House of Assembly.”
Section 40 of the Constitution Act
This section provides that “it shall not be lawful for either House of the said Parliament
to pass any vote, resolution, or Bill for the appropriation of any part of the revenue, or of
any tax, rate, duty, or impost, for any purpose which shall not have been first recommended
by the Governor to the said House of Assembly during the session in which such vote,
resolution, or Bill shall be passed.”


If the words “tax, rate, duty, or impost” were intended to mean the “proceeds”
of any tax, rate, duty, or impost,” they are surplusage, because such proceeds are clearly
revenue. It is probable, however, that these words are an example of constitutional
atavism, and a survival from Act to Act of words referring to the old practice of the
British Parliament of appropriating specific taxes, etc., to specific purposes. When the
consolidated revenue first was established the House of Commons had to pass 4,000
resolutions in committee to get rid of these appropriations of specific taxes.
I he object and intention of this section was not to define the relationship of the
two Houses of Parliament.
A study of the history of the section, and the fact that a similar message was
required when we had only one House, clearly proves that its original and main object
was to preserve the rights of the Crown. It formulates the practice of the House of
Commons, in which the ancient theory that the revenue of the country is the revenue of
the Crown, and ought not to be appropriated without the consent of the Crown, is still
preserved as a theory. Parliamentary appropriation of the revenue is a comparatively
modern innovation, which has arisen by successive encroachments of the Commons on the
prerogatives of the Crown. Originally, in theory as in practice, the three estates of the
realm- the Nobility, the Clerics, and the Commons- —taxed themselves separately, and
granted scutages, aids, and supplies to the Crown, which the Crown expended in the
ordinary government of the country (or otherwise), undictated to and untrammelled by the
Houses of Parliament.
Ihe House of Commons has in England gradually acquired all power over the
expenditure of the revenue so raised, which, however, is still theoretically the revenue of
the Crown.
Prom this theory the necessity of requiring a message from the Crown recom-
mending any appropriation of its revenue arose, and the practice is still continued. The
practice has survived after the reality of the theory has died, because it fulfils an important
and essential purpose. It gives to that Executive Committee of Parliament called the
Ministry the primary initiative of, and great power over, all expenditure ; and very properly
so, too, because it is of the greatest importance that the responsibility of controlling
expenditure should vest in the same body which is primarily responsible for providing the
ways and means and controlling the expenditure of the Province.
Money Bills —New Zealand and Queensland cases
It has been supposed by some people that the relative power of the two Houses of the
South Australian Parliament has been declared and illustrated by two cases which have
arisen in Queensland and in New Zealand ; but this is not so.
In 1885 a question arose in Queensland in reference to the relative rights and
powers of the two Houses concerning Money Bills. The wording of the Queensland
Constitution Act is similar to the wording of our Act in reference to this question ; but
the Legislative Council of Queensland is a nominated body, and had agreed to the followin<>-
joint Standing Order: —“ In all cases not herein provided for having reference to the joint
action of both Houses of Parliament, resort will be had to the rules, powers, and practice


xvi ADELAIDE AND VICINITY ConJlitu £‘3 s"olau. ml :.
of the Imperial Parliament.” The dispute was referred to the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, and the following questions were asked :
1. Whether the Constitution Act, 1867, confers on the Legislative Council powers
co-ordinate with those of the Legislative Assembly in the amendment of
the Bills, including Money Bills ?
2. Whether the claims of the Legislative Assembly as set forth in this message
of November 12, 1885, are well founded?
To which the following terse answer was given : —“Their Lordships agree humbly to report
to your Majesty that the first of these questions should be answered in the negative, and
the second in the affirmative.”
The New Zealand Council is a nominated Council, and the two New Zealand
Houses had agreed to joint Standing Orders, which in effect declared that the practice
of the two New Zealand Houses in reference to Money Bills should be the same as the
practice of the Lords and the Commons. The question asked the Imperial law officers
of the Crown (Coleridge and Jessel) was : “What would have been the practice of the
House of Lords in reference to the particular Money Bill in dispute ? ” —and their very
guarded reply was ; —“ We think the Bill was a Money Bill, and such a Bill as the House
of Commons would not have allowed to be altered by the House of Lords.”
In both these cases the Upper Houses were nominated, and not representative
Houses ; in both cases they had agreed to accept the position of the House of Lords, so far
as Money Bills were concerned ; and in both cases the only question asked was what would
have been the practice of the Lords and Commons. These cases have no bearing whatever
on the legal or constitutional position of the elected Legislative Council of South Australia,
which has never agreed to accept any such position. In South Australia both Houses are
now constitutionally bound by the “Compact of 1857," which has worked extremely well,
and a violation of that “Compact” by either House would now be “unconstitutional.”
Alterations of the Constitution Act —How made
Section XXXIV
It is generally believed that the Constitution Act cannot be altered unless the Bill seeking
to make an alteration is passed on both its second and third readings in both Houses of
Parliament by absolute majorities.
This is not so. Any part of the Constitution Act which does not refer to “ the
Constitution of Legislative Council or House of Assembly,” il passed in the ordinary
manner, can become law.
Section XXXIV. provides that “the said Parliament shall have full power and
authority from time to time by any Act to repeal, alter, or vary all or any of the provisions
of this Act and to substitute others in lieu thereof : Provided that it shall not be lawful to
present to the Governor for Her Majesty’s assent any Bill by which an alteration in the
Constitution of the said Legislative Council or House of Assembly may be made, unless
the second and third reading of such Bill shall have been passed with the concurrence of
an absolute majority of the whole number of the members of the said Legislative Council
and of the House of Assembly respectively : Provided also that every Bill which shall be
so passed shall be reserved for the signification of Her Majesty’s pleasure thereon.”


It is difficult to give any clear and succinct definition of what is meant by the
w'ord “constitution” as applied to a legislative body, but it could never have been intended
to prohibit any alteration being made in what had not been fixed and determined.
i J o t t
The evident meaning and intention of the Act is that no alteration of the constitution 01
either House as fixed by the Constitution Act should be made unless concurred in by
absolute majorities of both Houses. This is not only evident from a common-sense point
of view, but also from the fact that the prohibition is contained in a proviso. Power is first
given to “repeal, alter, or vary all or any of the provisions of this Act," and it is then
“provided that” Bills which alter the constitution of either House shall be passed in the
specified manner. The proviso is a limitation to the power given, and indicates the class
of alterations to the Act, which must be passed in the specified manner.
The late Mr. R. I. Stow (afterwards Judge Stow), in an opinion given in 1861
(P. P. No. 23 of 1861), puts the point very clearly: “This prohibition is not a direct
enactment extending to all legislation on the particular subjects indicated, but is a limitation
of the powers assumed to be given in the first part ot the section. Ihe section gives
powers to repeal, alter, or vary any of the provisions of the Constitution Act, but prohibits
the Legislature from exercising that power in such a manner as to alter the constitution
of the Legislative Council or House of Assembly, unless with the concurrence of an
absolute majority of members ol both Houses on the second and third readings of the Bill
by which the alteration may be effected ; therefore no enactment comes within the prohibition
contained in Section XXXIV., unless it alters the Constitution Act and also the constitution
of the Legislative Council or House of Assembly.
Imperial legislation since the passing of the Constitution Act
Since 1856 various important alterations have been made: some by the Imperial
Parliament ; some by the colonial Legislature. Amongst the most important made by
the Imperial Parliament may be mentioned :
In 1855 an Imperial Act authorised the bi-cameral Legislature, which it was
then anticipated would be established under the provisions of Clause XXXII. of the
Enabling Act (so soon as such bi-cameral Legislature was established), to sell and dispose
of and to legislate concerning the waste lands of the Crown.
In 1865 the prohibition contained in the common law of England before referred
to prohibiting Colonial Legislatures passing any law repugnant to the law of England,
was by an Act known as the Validating Act to a great extent abrogated, and the meaning
of the word “ repugnant ” was defined.
The Validating Act also provided that no colonial law should be invalid on
account of the Governor having consented to same, contrary to instructions given to him
“by any instrument other than his letters patent or instrument authorising such Governor
to concur in passing laws.’
In 1873 the prohibition against passing any law providing for the imposition of
preferential Customs duties was abolished so far as other Australian colonies were concerned,
and this limitation on the powers of colonial Legislatures has been since then further relaxed.
From time to time the Imperial Parliament, at our earnest request, has validated
certain Bills of the local Legislature which have been passed, contrary to the provisions
of Imperial Acts forming part of our Constitution, or of our Constitution Act itself.


The Parliament
In England the word “Parliament” properly means the Crown and the two Houses of
Legislature, but Section I. of the Constitution Act enacts that the two Houses of Legislature
in South Australia alone, without the Governor, shall be called “1 he Parliament.’ I hese
two Houses consist of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, constituted as
follows :
The Legislative Council,
There were originally 18 members of the Legislative Council; the number has
since been extended to 24.
The only qualifications for a Legislative Councillor were, and still are, that he must-
(a) He 30 years old.
(/;) He a natural-born or naturalised subject of Her Majesty, or legally made a
denizen of the Province.
(r) Have resided in the Province for three years if a natural-born subject of
Her Majesty; or five years if a naturalised subject.
No property qualification is required. A Legislative Councillor need not even
have, or be qualified to have, a vote for either House.
Three classes of persons are disqualified from being elected Legislative Councillors,
even though they possess all the above qualifications. They are:—
( a ) Judges of any court of the Province.
( b ) Clergymen or officiating ministers.
(r) Government contractors.
Originally the whole of the Province was one electoral district, but in 1881 the
Province was divided into four electoral districts each returning six members, so
that now the Council consists of 24 members returned by four districts. Every three
years the two members for each district who have been longest in office retire, and
what is called a periodic election takes place to fill the vacancies, eight new members
being elected, two for each district. If there were no casual vacancies caused by death or
resignation, etc., or if a casual vacancy were filled by the election of a new member to
hold office during the remainder of the term of the member whose death or resignation
caused the casual vacancy, Legislative Councillors would be elected for nine years ; in fact,
they are theoretically elected for nine years ; but it is provided that anyone elected to fill
a casual vacancy pushes forward, so to speak, the other members for the district so far as
the dates of their retirement are concerned, and is himself theoretically elected for the
whole term of nine years. In practice it has been found that few Councillors hold their
seats (unless re-elected) for more than six years.
The voters or electors for the Legislative Council comprise all those who—
1. Are over the age of 21 years.
2. Are not in gaol for treason, felony, or other infamous offence.
3. Have been registered on the Electoral Roll of the Province six months previous
to the election for which they claim to vote.
4. Are natural-born or naturalised subjects of Her Majesty, or legally made
denizens of the Province.


And who have, in addition, either one or more of the following qualifications :
(a) A freehold estate in possession either legal or equitable situate within the
Province of the clear value of £SO sterling money above all charges and
encumbrances affecting the same.
(b) A leasehold estate in possession situate within the Province of the clear
annual value of £2O , the lease thereof having been registered in the
General Registry Office for the registration of deeds, and having three
O J o o
years to run at the time of voting, or containing a clause entitling the
lessee to become the purchaser of the land thereby demised.
( c ) Occupy a dwelling-house of the clear annual value of £25 sterling.
(a) As to qualification (a), it may be mentioned that no trustee is entitled to vote
in respect of land held by him as trustee ; the beneficiaries equitably entitled to such land
can claim to vote, provided they are entitled “in possession ” ; that is to say, are entitled
to be paid the rents or profits by the trustee. No person having a contingent interest
or entitled in remainder has any electoral right under [a).
(b) As one of the elements of this qualification [b) is the “clear annual value of
the leasehold estate,” the question arises, the annual value to whom? To the landlord or
to the tenant ? If to the tenant, then inasmuch as the less rent the tenant pays the
greater value the “leasehold estate” is to him, it would follow that if two properties of
equal value were leased at different rents, the tenant who paid least rent might have a
vote, and he who paid most have no vote; or, if a tenant paid £I,OOO per annum rent,
and could not make the rent out of the premises leased, he would have no vote, because
the leasehold estate would have no value to him ; various other absurdities might be
pointed out to which this construction would lead. On the other hand, it seems anomalous
to give a tenant a vote in respect of the value of his “leasehold estate” to someone else
the landlord ; yet this has been decided to be the true meaning of similar words in the
English Reform Act (Colville v. Wood and others). The value of the leasehold estate to
the' landlord is practically the rent, so that in effect the rental must not be less than £2O
per annum. It must be noted the lessee must be in possession of the land, and the lease
must have been registered and have three years to run, or the lessee must have a right
of purchase. The alternative or only refers to the length of the lease, so that a lessee
who has a right of purchase must also have a registered lease, and the annual value of
the leasehold estate must be over £2O.
(c) As to qualification (r), the only qualification necessary is to occupy a dwelling-
house of the annual value of £2 5. No rent need be specified in the lease or paid; in fact,
there need be no lease; the occupier of a dwelling-house of the annual value of £2 5 can
claim to vote simply because he occupies.
No occupier (who is not also owner) of a shop, a store, farm, or vacant land. etc.,
can claim to vote because of such occupation. He may be entitled because he is the
owner under (a), or registered lessee under (b) ; but he cannot claim as an occupier.
The Constitution Act itself granted the franchise for the Legislative Council to
males alone. It has since been extended to females possessing the specified qualifications.
At the first election in 1857 there were 10,092 registered voters out of a population
of 109,917 ; at the last election in 1897 there were 45,814 registered voters out of a
population of 355,286.
By the Constitution Act itself the Governor has no power to dissolve the Legislative
Council ; that is, to prevent the members from holding their seats for the full term of nine
695

Constitution or South Australia


years for which they were elected, but by Act No. 236 of 188r, the provisions of which
will be examined later on, this was altered.
The Constitution Act provides that the Legislative Council shall elect a President
to preside over its meetings, administer the Standing Orders, issue writs to fill casual
vacancies, etc., etc.
A casual vacancy can be occasioned in any of the following ways :
(a) Death.
(b) Written resignation addressed and delivered to the President.
(r) Failure to attend the sittings for two consecutive months without the permission
of the Council.
{d) Becoming a citizen of a foreign Power.
( e ) Bankruptcy.
(/) “Taking the benefit of any Act relating to insolvent debtors.”
(£') Becoming a public defaulter.
(//) Becoming attainted of treason or convicted of felony or of any infamous crime.
(/’) Becoming of unsound mind.
(y ) Acceptance of an office of profit or pension from the Crown during pleasure
except the office of one of the responsible Ministers.
(/f) Becoming a Government contractor.
In the event of a vacancy occurring from any one of these causes, the President issues a
writ to cause an election to take place to fill the vacancy.
The House of Assembly.
There were originally 36 members of the House of Assembly. Ihe members
have now been increased to 54.
The qualifications for a member of the House of Assembly were, and still are,
that he must-
(a) Be over the age of 21 years.
(b) Be a natural-born or naturalised subject of Her Majesty.
(c) Have resided in the Province for at least five years, if a naturalised subject.
No property qualification is requisite. Four classes of persons are disqualified from being
elected members of the House of Assembly, even though they possess all the above
qualifications. They are
( a ) Judges of any court of the Province.
[b) Clergymen or officiating ministers.
(r) Government contractors.
((/) Persons in gaol for treason or felony or other infamous offence.
The 54 members are now returned by 27 electoral divisions. W hen the whole
Colony elected the Council, the word “district” was used for the electoral divisions for the
House of Assemby ; but the word “district ” is now used to describe the area represented
by a Legislative Councillor, and the word “division” for the area represented by a member
of the House of Assembly. This alteration in phraseology has caused some confusion.


The members of the Assembly are elected for three years, unless in the meantime
the House is dissolved; that is to say, unless the Governor declares the seats of all the
members vacant and orders an election for new members.
I he voters or electors for the House of Assembly comprise all those who
(1) Are over the age of 21 years.
(2) Are not in gaol for treason, felony, or other infamous offence.
(3) Have been registered on the electoral roll of the Province for six months
previous to the election for which they claim to vote'.
(4) Are natural-born or naturalised subjects of Her Majesty.
The franchise for the House of Assembly was originally confined to males ; it
J % O # J
has, however, been extended to females. At the first election in 1857 there were 15,538
registered voters out of a population of 109,917 ; at the last election, 1899, there were 152,393
registered voters out of a population of 362,897.
Casual vacancies are occasioned by practically the same causes as in the Council,
but the wording of the two sections referring to this subject for the respective Houses is
somewhat different, especially as regards bankruptcy or insolvency.
A Speaker is elected, who issues writs to fill casual vacancies, and who has
substantially similar powers and performs similar functions to the President.
Parliament cannot proceed to transact any business unless summoned by the
Governor, who has the power not only of summoning and of proroguing Parliament, but
also the power of dissolving the House of Assembly, and, in certain cases, which will be
hereinafter mentioned, of also dissolving the Council. It is, however, provided that the
Governor must summon Parliament to meet once a year, “so that a period of twelve
calendar months shall not intervene between the last sitting: of the Parliament in one
session and the first sitting; of Parliament in the next session.”
Since the Constitution Act only three amendments of importance have been made
in the “constitution of the Houses”:-
(1.) In 1869-70 “The Contractors in Parliament Act” was passed, which prohibits
persons who have contracts with the Executive from being elected to or sitting in
Parliament. Certain contracts are, however, excepted from the operation of this Act.
They are :
J
( a ) Contracts made by incorporated trading companies consisting of more than 20
persons.
(7?) Contracts or agreements “in respect of any lease, licence, or agreement in
respect to the sale or occupation of any waste lands of the Crown or
Crown lands.”
(r) Contracts devolving upon members of Parliament as executors, legatees, etc., etc.
(2.) The “Female Suffrage Act” (613 of 1894) extended the right to vote for
members of both Houses of Parliament to women possessing the necessary qualifications.
This places women in exactly the same position as men so far as the electoral franchise is
concerned, and has one curious effect not generally known : it enables a woman to be
elected as a member of the House of Assembly, but not as a Legislative Councillor. This
results from the wording of the Constitution Act, which enacts that “ any person who shall
be qualified and entitled to be registered as a voter shall be qualified and entitled to be
elected a member of the House of Assembly.”


Inasmuch as women may now be qualified and entitled to be registered as voters,
they may, therefore, be qualified and entitled to be elected members of the House of
Assembly. The qualifications, however, entitling anyone to be elected a Legislative
Councillor are quite different ; they are (i verbatim ) as before stated. Ihe Constitution Act
itself only referred to male voters and male members ot Parliament. Ihe hemale
Suffrage Act ” refers only to voters, and although by implication it enables a woman to be
elected a member of the House of Assembly, it does not alter the qualifications necessary
for a Legislative Councillor.
(3.) By Act No. 236 of 1881 the Province, instead of being one electoral district
for the election of Legislative Councillors, was divided into four districts, h nder its provisions
“ whenever any Bill lor any Act shall have been passed by the House of Assembly during
any session of Parliament, and the same Bill, or a similar Bill with substantially the same
objects and having the same title, shall have been passed by the House of Assembly during
the next ensuing Parliament, a general election of the House of Assembly having taken
place between such two Parliaments, the second and third readings of such Bill having
been passed in the second instance by an absolute majority of the whole number of members
of the said House of Assembly, and both such Bills shall have been rejected by, or fail
to become law in consequence of any amendments made therein by the Legislative Council, it
shall be lawful for, but not obligatory upon, the Governor of the said Province, by proclamation
to be published in the Government Gazette , to dissolve the Legislative Council and House
of Assembly, and thereupon all members of both Houses of Parliament shall vac;, e :hc;r
seats, and members shall be elected to supply the vacancies so created ; or for the Governor
to issue writs for the election of one, or not more than two, new members for each district ot
the Legislative Council : Provided always that no vacancy, whether by death, resignation,
or any other cause, shall be filled up while the total number of members shall be 24 or more ’ :
“in the event of the Council being dissolved, six members shall be elected for each of
the said districts, and the names of such members shall be placed on the roll of members
for the said districts in the order provided for in Section XII. of this Act, and thereafter
the several periodical retirements of members referred to in Sections \ HI. and XIII. of
this Act shall date from the day of their election."
It will be seen that any Bill in consequence of which the whole of the Legislative
Council and the House of Assembly may be dissolved, or in consequence of which new
members of the Legislative Council may be elected, must fail to become law, because of
its rejection by the Legislative Council, or because of amendments made by such Council.
If the Legislative Council simply postpones the consideration of the Bill from time to
time until the end of the session no dissolution of or additions to the Council can take
place.
If, however, the Council so treats the Bill as to entitle the Governor to exercise
either of these alternative powers, and if the Governor causes the number of Councillors
to be increased by the election of additional members, there is some doubt as to
what the future results would be.
The words “ vacancy, whether by death, resignation, or any other cause, ’ are
capable of two constructions.
If we consider these words apart from the rest of the Act, and do not give full
weight to some of its main intentions, the words “any other cause" would (according to
the recognised rules for the construction of Statutes) refer only to vacancies analagous to the
particular words which they follow (“death” or “resignation”); that is to casual vacancies,
and the ordinary periodic elections would be held in due course, the Council being
gradually reduced to its nominal number by casual vacancies caused by any of the
11 causes mentioned in the preceding chapter.
698
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Cma6tM «i.


If this is the true construction of the words, inasmuch as all or nearly all the
casual vacancies may occur in one of the four districts, that district may for a long period
(perhaps to or 12 years) be almost unrepresented in the Council.
If, however, the words have the meaning which they would convey to any non-
legal mind, “any other cause” would include vacancies caused by the retirement of members in
consequence of effluxion of time, and assuming that eight new members had been elected,
no election could take place to fill the vacancies caused by the retirement in consequence
of effluxion of time of the eight members who had been longest in office ; or, to put it
in another way, there could be no next periodic election. As this would cause the enforced
retirement from the Council of the eight members who had been longest in office for three
years, they would probably resign and stand for the election to add to the number of
members of the Council. The President would have to issue writs to fill the eight casual
vacancies caused by such resignations, and such resignations would have the effect of
causing the eight members next longest in office to retire at the time fixed for the next
periodic election, at which election they could not stand again, because no election could
take place. In their turn they, also, would therefore probably resign, and so with the
remaining eight, so that practically the whole Council would be dissolved.
As the President would have to issue the writs to fill the vacancies caused by
resignations and fix the da.tes for the consequent elections, and the Governor would have
to issue the writs for the eight new members and fix the date for their election,
complications of a most embarrassing nature might arise.
There are grounds for holding either of these two constructions to be correct,
but probably a court of law would uphold the former.
Up to the present time there has been no dissolution of the two Houses, nor has
there been any addition to the number of Councillors in pursuance of the Act now under
discussion.
It has been suggested that if writs were issued to increase the number of
Councillors, any sitting member, instead of resigning his seat, might become a candidate,
and, on election, resign his original seat.
It has also been suggested that a member of one House, without resigning his
seat in that House, may be elected a member of the other House, and sit in both Houses.
There are no express words in the Constitution Act or its amendments prohibiting
either of these things being done, but they would certainly be against the spirit of our
constitution, to which the following fine words of Mr. Gladstone apply as strongly as they
do to the British constitution : —“ More, it must be admitted, than any other, it leaves open
doors which lead into blind alleys, for it presumes more boldly than any other the good
sense and the good faith of those who work it. The undoubted competency of each
reaches even to the paralysis or destruction of the rest. The House of Commons is
entitled to refuse every shilling of the supplies. That House, and also the House of
Lords, is entitled to refuse its assent to every Bill presented to it. 'The Crown is entitled
to make a thousand peers to-day, and as many to-morrow ; it may dissolve all and every
Parliament before it proceeds to business; may pardon the most atrocious crimes ; may
declare war against all the world ; may conclude treaties involving unlimited responsibilities,
and even vast expenditure without the consent, nay, without the knowledge of the
Parliament, but in reversal of policy already known and sanctioned by the nation. But
the assumption is that the depositaries of power will all respect one another ; will evince
a consciousness that they are working in a common interest for a common end ; and they
will be possessed together with not less than an average intelligence, of not less than an
average sense of equity and of the public interest of right.”

Constitution of South Australia


The powers and privileges of the Parliament
So long as “The Parliament” acts within the scope and limit of the powers given to it
by the Imperial Parliament it is in practice, though not in theory, supreme. \\ ithin these
limits “ The Parliament ” is the source and foundation of all power —legislative, executive,
and judicial. Its power to legislate is direct; it practically appoints the real Executive
(the Ministry), who, though nominally appointed by the Governor to advise him, is practically
a committee of Parliament, and exercises all executive functions within the Province. It
can establish or abolish courts of law, fix the number and remuneration of the Judges, and,
subject to certain limitations, control and regulate the position and duties of the Judges.
It is true that the Judges are not directly appointed by, and cannot be directly removed
by Parliament theoretically they are appointed by the Crown to hold office during good
behavior, and may be removed “by Her Majesty Her heirs and successors upon the
address of both Houses of the said Parliament.’ Practically this means that they are
appointed by that Parliamentary committee called the Ministry, and that one of the
means by which they can be removed is by Parliament.
The power to legislate (conferred by the “Enabling Act 13 and 14 \ ic., Cap. 59)
is given by the words “to make laws for the peace, welfare, and good government of
the Province.” This power was, however, qualified by prohibitions. Ihe Parliament
was forbidden to make any law —
(a) “Repugnant to the laws of England”;
Q) “ Interfering in any way with the sale or other appropriation of the lands
belonging to the Crown, or with the revenue arising therefrom ’ ;
(r) “Imposing differential Customs duties”;
{d) Dealing with shipping, import and export duties, etc., “contrary to or at
variance with any treaty or treaties concluded by Her Majesty with any
foreign power ” ;
( e ) Dealing with other specified matters of minor importance.
As has been shown in the preceding chapter, some of the most important of these prohibitions
have been repealed, others have been modified, but some still remain.
The power to legislate is also further curtailed by the commission and instructions
given to the Governor by the Queen. There are certain classes of subject matter, concerning
which it is obvious that legislation and practice ought to be uniform all over the British
Empire ; there are other classes of subject matter concerning which Imperial considerations
have to be weighed, as against local necessities or prejudices ; and the Governor’s commission
and instructions —that is, the power of attorney, so to speak, under which he acts for the
Queen -oblige him to refer Bills relating to any such subject matter for the consideration
of the Imperial authorities ; that is to say, in theory, the Queen herself will consider whether
she will or will not make the law petitioned for by the South Australian Parliament ; in
practice, that the Secretary of State for the Colonies will, after receipt of advice from the
law officers of the Crown in England, say whether the Bill shall or shall not become law.
Power is also reserved by the Queen in the pow r er of attorney given to the Governor,
to “disallow” any Bill within a period of two years, even although the Governor has
assented to such Bill. The theory of this is that the Governor has exceeded or misconstrued
the powers and instructions given by his power of attorney, and having exceeded his
authority, his acts do not bind his principal —the Crown.
700
ADELAIDE AND VICINITY Consti , ut S°'r f ?^A.su.ii.


Amongst the most important subjects concerning which even now local laws cannot
be made may be mentioned :—The relation of South Australia to foreign countries ; the
regulation of trade and commerce with other countries or colonies ; such prerogatives of
the Crown as have not been abrogated by the granting of a Constitution to South Australia ;
the limitation and definition of the powers given to the Governor by the Queen to represent
the Crown ; the control and regulation of ships owned by British subjects, etc., etc. Concerning
some of these matters the Parliament has no power to legislate ; concerning others, a
limited power.
Outside the boundaries of this Province (including its bays, inlets, estuaries, etc.)
South Australian law has no force or validity (except so far as the enforcement of contracts
made in the Province is concerned). As an illustration of this proposition, let us consider
the position of a ship owned and registered in the Province. One of the matters (except
within small limits as to certain details) concerning which the Parliament may not legislate
is “ British shipping ” ; there is no such thing as a South Australian or Victorian ship. All
ships under the British Hag are British ships registered, manned, victualled, and regulated
under British law. Although each colony possesses a Register for Shipping, a Vice-Admiralty
Court, etc., etc., these are branches of the British Register, the British Admiralty Court,
etc. \\ hen, however, a British ship is in this Province, the laws of South Australia are
in force on board of her concerning all matters not provided for by the British Merchant
Shipping Act; but immediately she departs from the Province, say on a voyage to Melbourne,
British law is the only law in force on board that ship, both in criminal and civil matters,
until she enters Victorian waters, when Victorian law, so long as she remains in Victoria,
takes the place originally occupied by South Australian law.
So far, however, as the subject matters on which Home Rule has been granted to
South Australia are concerned, the authority to make laws within the area of South Australia
is absolute if the law is within the scope and limit of the authority given. It is a maxim of
law that “ delegatus non protest delegare ”- that is to say, power which has been delegated
to any body or person cannot be handed on by that body or person to someone else (without
express authority from the principal). In a case which arose in New South Wales it was
argued that, inasmuch as the New South Wales Governor and Parliament only possessed a
delegated power to make laws (similar to that given to the Parliament of South Australia),
they could not give to the Governor in Council power to make regulations or by-laws
practically imposing a tax, as that would be a delegation of the power delegated to them.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, however, said that “within the limit of
subjects and areas a colonial Legislature is supreme, and has the same authority as the
Imperial Parliament.”
P'or a long time it was considered that colonial Legislatures had, by the common
law of Pbigland, the same privileges (of freedom of speech, power to punish either members or
strangers for contempt, etc.) as the British Houses of Parliament. This idea was originated
by Governor Simcoe, who informed the Legislature of Upper Canada that they were “the
image and transcript of the British• Constitution.” He granted or purported to grant to
them “all the powers, privileges, and immunities of the British House of Commons.”
Governor Simcoe was under the same impression as was Charles 1., that the
Sovereign had the power to grant those “privileges,” etc. ; but, as a matter of law, the
British Commons derive their privileges, etc., from part of the common law, generally
called the “ Lex et Consuetude Parliament id which gives and defines the privileges of the
British House of Commons; and that “ Lex et Consuetude Parliamenti" does not cross
the seas.
701
Constitution o^? 3 ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


“The law and practice of Parliament as established in the United Kingdom,
said the English law officers (Cockburn and Bethell), “are not applicable to colonial
Legislatures, nor does the rule of one body furnish any analogy lor the conduct of the other.
And as Mr. Chitty says “ With respect to colonial Assemblies, it is most
important that any idea that they stand on the same footing as the English House of
Commons should be excluded from consideration.”
This position was not fully realised in South Australia for a long time ; in fact,
in 1857, when the debates between the two Houses concerning Money Bills took place,
resulting in what is known as the “Compact of 1857,’ it was not realised at all; but
ultimately, in 1872, an Act was passed giving to our Houses of Legislature the same
privileges, powers, and immunities as the British House of Commons.
The word “privilege” is often used to denote the respective rights and powers
of the two Houses as between themselves ; and it must be distinctly understood that the
Act of 1872 has nothing to do with, and does not in any way affect, this aspect of the
privileges of either House. We have the authority of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council and of the law officers of the Crown in England for this statement.
Under the provisions of the Privilege Act either House of Parliament can by
resolution punish any of its members who are guilty of contempt or misconduct by expulsion,
imprisonment, fine, suspension, or censure ; and it may punish strangers who are declared
guilty of contempt of Parliament in a similar manner (except, of course, by expulsion).
The Governor
The Governor is commonly described as the representative of Her Majesty, and to a
certain extent this is true ; but he is not a Viceroy, and only represents Her Majesty to
a limited degree. The difference between a Viceroy and a Governor has never been very
clearly defined, but it may be safely stated that a Governor represents the Crown to a
more limited degree and in a more specified manner than does a Viceroy. I o each
Governor a commission or power of attorney is given, setting out either directly or by
inference what his authority is, accompanied by letters of instruction telling him he must
do certain things and that he must not do certain things.
Where Imperial interests are concerned, the Governor is the guardian of these
interests, and he cannot shelter himself behind the responsibility of his local advisers. He
should communicate direct with the home authorities. If they do not uphold his decisions,
he must give way or resign ; while if they do, the question becomes one between the
Province and the mother country.
The Governor occupies a dual position : he is both an Imperial officer and a local
Governor. In all matters of Imperial concern he must act on his own responsibility or
by direction of Her Majesty in her Privy Council, that is, practically, the Secretary of
State for the Colonies ; and it would be unconstitutional for him to consult his local
advisers. In all matters of local concern he now acts almost entirely on the advice of his
local advisers ; and the tendency of the British Government for many years has been to
grant us more complete autonomy by sweeping away any real power from the Governor
in local matters. As an example : Up to late years the Governor was bound by his
instructions in capital cases, after taking the advice of his Ministers, to exercise the
prerogative of mercy on his own responsibility. But when Sir Anthony Musgrave, in


Queensland, came into colli.sion with his responsible advisers by insisting on exercising his
own judgment, he was in effect told by them that the Ministry would order the gaoler and
the police to disregard his authority. As has always been the case when any Governor,
in attempting to obey the instructions given to him, has come into collision with the local
Ministry, the Secretary of State for the Colonies deserted Sir Anthony Musgrave, and the
instructions to Governors have since been altered, so that now the Ministry practically
exercises the prerogative of mercy.
Although a capable Governor by his position, knowledge, and experience may
exert great influence, there are few matters of purely local concern in which he can
constitutionally exercise his own judgment. Two examples are given : when a Ministry,
having lost the confidence of Parliament, advises a penal dissolution of Parliament ; or when
a Ministry has tendered to him, and he has accepted, its resignation and new advisers
have not been appointed.
In both of these cases the Governor must act on his own responsibility and
exercise his own discretion.
I here is no doubt as to the first-mentioned event ; and the position has been
very clearly put by Lord Normanby in a Minute in 1881 refusing to grant a dissolution
on the advice of his Ministry : —“ If the principle were admitted that a Minister had a
right to a dissolution whenever he saw fit to advise one, a vital blow would be struck at
the powers and independence of Parliament. The Minister would then become the master
of Parliament instead of the servant of the Crown ; and the knowledge that a vote against
the Government might terminate its existence would act as a constant drag on the
independence of Parliament and the exercise of that supervision over the actions of the
Government which it is its right and duty to exercise.”
It is no doubt a fact that the Governor sometimes asks the retiring Premier
whom he should send for to form a new Ministry; but if he ask such advice officially,
he is acting contrary to sound constitutional theory.
When the retiring Ministry has resigned, and the Governor has accepted its
resignation, he has no official adviser, and he is no more justified in asking his late advisers
for official advice than he would be in asking any private person ; he must act on his own
responsibility and use his own discretion, the incoming Ministry taking the responsibility
of his action.
No doubt in theory the Governor has the right to appoint and dismiss Ministers
when he pleases as they are (in theory) the “servants of the Crown,” but the exercise of
such right, except (as above mentioned) and in cases of grave emergency, is in constitutional
practice so curtailed by Parliament as to be almost nominal.
It must, also, of course, be clearly understood that the Governor is bound to refuse
to accept the advice of his Ministers if they advise him to do any illegal act. The law
is above both him and them, and he cannot shelter himself from any consequence which
may ensue by setting up the advice of his Ministers if he has done an illegal act. The
maxim that a King can do no wrong does not apply to a Governor. He is neither a
King nor a Viceroy ; he can sue and be sued in the courts of the Province for any private
debts due to or by him, or for wrongs done to or by him either in his public or private
capacity ; and after his return to England he is liable in actions brought against him there.
“If a Governor exceeds his authority, he is in the same position as any other
person who exceeds his authority- his acts are null and void”; and a Governor has been
expressly made liable for criminal acts by Statute.

"soutli Australia ADELAIDE AND VICINITY


Governor Wall was hanged for inflicting excessive corporal punishment, resulting
in death, during the time he was Governor.
General Picton was convicted of a misdemeanor for an act done in his capacity
of a Governor, and would have suffered imprisonment had he not been killed at the battle
of Waterloo ; and a few years ago our old Surveyor-General, Governor Eyre, was harassed
and ruined by actions brought against him in England for acts done by him as Governor
of Jamaica.
The Ministry
Bv the Governor’s Commission he is required to appoint an Executive Council, which is
to “consist of such persons as are now or may at any time be declared by any aw,
enacted by the Legislature of our said Colony, to be members of the said Executive
Council, and of such other persons as the said Governor shall from time to time appoint
and by his instructions he is directed and enjoined in die execution of the powers and
authorities committed to him to “in all cases' consult with our Executive Council,
excepting only in cases which may be of such a nature that in his judgment our service
would sustain material prejudice by consulting our said Council thereon.”
And he is authorised “ m his discretion, and it it shall in any case appear light,
to act in the exercise of the powers committed to him in opposition to the advice which
may in any such cases be given to him by the members of our said Executive Council.”
By the Constitution Act and its amendments it is provided that the persons holding
six specified offices, the appointments to which are vested in the Governor alone, shall be
the Chief Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown
Lands, the Commissioner of Public Works, and the Sixth Minister, and that the six persons
shall be ex officio members of the Executive Council, and shall all be members of Parliament
(except the Attorney-General, who may or may not be a member of Parliament'-.
This is the whole of the law of the “Constitution” in reference to the appointment
of the Ministry.
It is only by the force of constitutional maxims, which may not improperly be
termed congealed public opinion, that the powers, the functions, and the authorities of the
Ministry exist.
These constitutional maxims provide that
( a ) The Ministry shall possess the confidence and be in accord with the opinions
ot the majority (if not of both Houses ot Parliament, at all events ot the
House of Assembly).
(/;) That they shall be a quasi corporate body holding the same opinions on all
important questions, and advising the Governor through one of the body
called the Premier.
(r) That the Ministry shall be formed by the instrumentality of the Premier, to
whom the Governor shall entrust the task.
{d] That the Governor shall in all matters of local concern act on the advice of
the Ministry (except those cases indicated under the heading of Governor).
(A That the resignation of the Premier involves the resignation of all the Ministers.


It is evident that the enormous power exercised by the Ministry rests on a very small
legal basis, and it is curious to note that this system of “ Responsible Ministry,” that is, of
adviseis theoretically responsible to the Governor and constitutionally and practically
responsible to the Parliament, was introduced into Australia simply in pursuance of a few
voids contained in a despatch of Sir R. Peel to one ot our colonial Governors, and that
w^ s originally introduced into Canada simply in pursuance of a conversation between
Sir brands Head and a Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Vo doubt in both cases public opinion was not only ripe, but had for some
time clamored tor the change trom advisers holding the same opinions as, and responsible
to, Governor, to advisers holding the same opinions as, and practically responsible
to, 1 arliament ; but it public opinion were now to demand some other change, no alteration of
the law would be required.
Sources of Constitution
It I las often been stated that in South Australia we have a written Constitution, that in
Great Britain they have an unwritten Constitution ; and that therefore our Constitution is
rigid and indexible, whilst the Constitution of the mother country has a flexibility and
adaptation to the varying conditions and exigencies which time and evolution bring into
existence which is wanting in South Australia. This statement contains a germ of truth,
but little more, as a consideration of the various sources from which the two Constitutions
are derived will show.
The British Constitution is to be found- -
{a) In various Statutes, which partly formulate, define, and limit the powers of
the Crown and the Constitution of the two Houses of Parliament, etc.,
such as the Act of Settlement, which fixes the devolution of the Crown ;
the Septennial Act, which fixes the duration of Parliament; the various
Pranchise and Electoral Acts, which fix the qualification of the electors
and the elected, etc.
(b) In the common law (of which the “ Lex et Consitetudo Parliament /” is part),
which, when not altered by Statute, fixes and limits the prerogatives of
the Crown, and, in one meaning of the words, the powers and privileges
of the two Houses ot Parliament, etc.
(e) In various conventions or understandings which have not the force of law,
but which may be called constitutional axioms ; such as the axiom that it is
unconstitutional for the House of Cords to alter a Bill imposing taxes or
appropriating revenue ; that the Crown shall choose its own advisers (called
Ministers of the Crown) who are in accord with the majority in the
House of Commons, etc.
The Constitution of South Australia is to be found in—
(a) British Statutes referring to the subject ; some of which, though passed
anterior to our own Constitution Act, are still in force ; and some of which,
such as the Validating Act, have been passed subsequently to the passing
of our Constitution Act.


(As we are part of the British Empire, and subject to the sovereignty
of the British Parliament, these Acts are of greater force than, and in case
of conflict over-ride, our local Acts.)
(/>) The Constitution Act, which was passed by the local Legislature in pursuance
of powers given by the Imperial Acts to which I have referred, and other
local Statutes, either amending or supplementing such Act.
(r) The common law of England, which in South Australia as in Great Britain
defines and limits the prerogatives of the Crown, and, in one meaning o
these words (by the effect of the Privilege Act of 1872), the powers and
privileges of the two Houses of Parliament.
(c/) Those conventions or constitutional maxims which have not the force of law,
many of which are substantially similar to the British conventions.
(c) The commission and instructions from the Queen to the Governor, which,
inter alia , define and limit his power and duty in his law-making capacity,
by providing that certain classes of Bills must be reserved for Her Majesty s
consideration, and also to a certain extent indicate his relationship to his
Ministerial advisers.
There are grounds for asserting that the Standing Orders of the two Houses of
Parliament of South Australia are part of the Constitution of the Province, and that the
Standing Orders of the Houses of the British Parliament are not part of the Constitution
of Great Britain.
The Constitution Act of South Australia provides that Standing Orders may be
made, which, after approval by the Governor, “shall become binding and ot force" ; whilst
the Standing Orders of the House of Commons are only rules of practice compiled at the
commencement of each session by the Speaker, based in some instances on resolutions of
the House of Commons, and in others on the practice of that House, dhe consent of the
Crown is not necessary to their validity, and they can be altered from day to day by
new r resolutions of the House.
In both instances, however, important “constitutional conventions ” may be, and
in fact are, included in the Standing Orders, which, as in the cases which arose in
New' Zealand and Queensland, may have most important results. 1 his distinction is
somewhat fine, and, from a constitutional point of view, the Standing Orders may in both
cases be considered part of the respective Constitutions.
If we contrast these two systems we see that the rigid part of our Constitution
is not much greater than the rigid part of the British Constitution.
There are, however, two important points in which our Constitution cannot
theoretically be so readily altered as tire British Constitution .
Firstly We have been practically forbidden to interfere with the more important
prerogatives of the Crown. These are the same all over the British dominions, and the
British Parliament has in practice reserved to itself the power to make any alteration. I
do not say that this has ever been stated in so many words, but the Governor is forbidden
by his instructions to make (commonly called assent to) any law which curtails the
prerogatives of the Crown ; and Bills of this nature, if sent to England for the Queen’s
assent, are laid aside or disallowed. I will give two examples : The first Constitution Act
passed in 1856 was disallowed because it attempted to regulate the manner in which Bills


sliGiik l be submitted to the Crown ; and the Precedency Act, passed in 1870, was also
disallowed, because it interfered with the prerogative of the Crown to regulate the
precedence of all Her Majesty’s subjects.
Secondly— Any Bill altering the constitution of either House of the Legislature must
be passed by absolute majorities in both Houses, and reserved for Her Majesty’s assent.
As to those conventions or established maxims which form part of our Constitution,
they can be as readily altered in South Australia as in England. For example, if popular
opinion permitted him so to do, the Governor might to-morrow dismiss his advisers and
appoint advisers whose opinion co-incided with his own, and in whom Parliament had no
confidence , and it such advisers could not obtain funds to carry on the Government, or were
otherwise habitually thwarted by Parliament, he could dissolve the House of Assembly,
and rely on the public opinion to which I have referred to justify his unconstitutional action’.
T h ere is> hi fact, no such thing, so far as I know, as an entirely written Constitution—
it is only a question of degree. Even in the United States of America, where the whole
Constitution was supposed to have been set out in one document (which could not be altered
or varied except by the people of the United States acting in a specified mannerfi time,
practice, the United States judges (notably Judge Marshall), and evolution, have made
great alterations. As Mr. Woodrow Wilson says:—“ There has been a constant growth of
legislative and administrative practice and a steady accretion of precedent in the management
of federal affairs which have broadened the sphere and altered the formation of the
Government without perceptibly affecting the vocabulary of our constitutional language.
Ours, no less than the British, is a living and a fecund system.”
Conclusion
I here are many constitutional questions of great importance which have been left
uninvestigated, such as the authority for, and the effect of. “Orders in Council,” that is,
. fd tli tl*ie ad vice of the Privy Council or some committee thereof;
the position of the Judges of the Supreme Court; the electoral laws; the growing but
unconstitutional and pernicious practice of permitting the Executive to legislate without the
consent and approval of Parliament by means of regulations ; the reservation of Bills, etc., etc.
It is not, however, pretended that these notes contain either a complete history or analysis
of the Constitution of South Australia—they are simply notes on some of its most important
characteristics, and the theory of our Constitution has been mainly elucidated, and perhaps a
somewhat scanty consideration given to the practical reality. This has been done advisedly,
because it is essential in order to properly understand the whole subject that both the theory
and the reality should be known and understood. The former is known to and understood
by few, whilst the latter is known (and understood to a certain degree) by most.
