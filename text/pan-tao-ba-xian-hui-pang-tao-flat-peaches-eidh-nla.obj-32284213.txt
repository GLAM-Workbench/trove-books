heavenly abode, it was when Li was on one of there trips with Lao Tzu to the
countries of Hai�yu that he left: his material body in charge of of his disciple,
Lang Ling wifeh instructions to crembte it if he did not return within feeven
days. On the sixth day the disciple was mile home to visit bis sick mother
and decided to cremate Li ? b perishable body. According to his original plan
Li returned on the seventh day from his celestial journey, only to find that
bis body had been cremated and that he had no abode. On looking around
he found the body of a lame beggar who had just died, and Li took this for
his owd double or astral body. He procured an iron staff (tieh kuai) to
support the defoirned body which he ead rdopted as his ?vvn and from this
obtaine i the name of Li T,ieh-kuai. He is accredited with many be evolenfc
deeds, �acii as bringing to life the body of the mother of the disciple who
cremated his origioal body. In the from of an old men be sold drugs iu tbe
uarket place which con! cure any kind of disease, and while there he hung a
gou don the wall of the lnto this gcard he retired at night, going out
the following day to atteud to his sales. He preterred to associate with the
poor and needy thes aequiring a reputation for benevolence. The character-
i�iic of thig Immortal is the all shaped boay of a beggar, who carries antiron
in his hand, and a go a don bisback.
