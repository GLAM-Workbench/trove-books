FOREWORD.
Herman Gorter, the writer of this pamphlet, is a well
known Dutch poet and social-revolutionary. He has long
been a prominent figure in Socialist circles on the Continent,
and quite recently has been made Professor of Moscow
University. He well deserves the distinction that the Soviet'
Government has bestowed upon him. When so many
Socialists lost themselves in opportunism and patriotism,
he was one of the few whose vision was not blurred, and
whose devotion to the cause of Socialism was never in doubt.
He was one of the very few whose judgment was always
founded on knowledge and inspired by love. The light that
ho has held up so constantly and devotedly is now reflected
in the spirit of the advance guard of the Dutch proletariat.
And the light that Gorter has held up is the same light that
was held up by the Dutch poetess, Henriette Roland-Holst,
and by that brilliant writer on Socialism, Professor
Pannekoek.
May these “neutrals” create among the workers of
the world- that atmosphere of confidence, the absence of
which w r as one of the.causes of the division of the world-
proletariat into hostile camps—a division that made war
possible —a war whose burden was, is, and unless they are
united in revolution, will continue to be, thrown across the
shoulders of the proletarians of all countries.
With regard to the pamphlet itself, it is a continuation
of the pamphlet “ Imperialism, World War, and Social
Democracy.” The latter pamphlet, which has not yet
appeared in English, proved the necessity of the unity of the
world-proletariat in its struggle against world-imperialism.
This pamphlet shows that this struggle of the world-
proletariat will be the proletarian revolution for Socialism,


The first chapter, with, the exception of a few
was written in September, 1917. The last chapter was
written in July, 1918.
The official Trade Union leaders in the Anglo-Saxon
lands are becoming bolder in their Judas utterances, and
more base than Judas with the gold.
They are bold because they know that the worker has
not realised that he has been betrayed. And with the gold
they have doubtless been helping to. buy up the Joy Loans of
a Capitalist State.
Their protests against intervention in Russia have been
putrid with hypocrisies.
Citizen, armies.—the new Capitalist Militarism—are to be
formed in all countries. In the British Empire, too, and
yet who among these Labour leaders has taken action?
The Capitalists are about to recruit the middle classes,
yet who of these Labour men has uttered a word of warning
to these classes?
No, these Labour officials would delight to see Com-
munism in England become a cult for suburbia, whilst they
erected the most contemptible bureaucracy possible to
Imagine.
The. war has taught Socialists many lessons.
After four and a half years the patriots who were
clamorous for “no compromise” triumped completely, with
the result that the Ramsay Macdonalds could not tell where
they were or how r they stood,
So. it will be with these compromisers, these confusion-
Ists. That abyss into which they tell us we are leading the
world is their own inevitable death-trap. For it will be a
good thing if this present civilisation crumbles away. The
world-proletariat have it in them to. create a better; but not
to know what to do with an old and artificial civilisation, and
not to have the moral and spiritual power to create a new
one —is surely to be on the, edge of an abyss.
In spit© of these confusionists, real revolutionary
Socialists have reason to be hopeful.


There: is hope, because' there is a body of workers, in
England, in Scotland, in Ireland, in America, in South
Africa, in Australia—a body of workers whose thoughts are
as clear as mid-day, and who will never allow their minds
to be confused again. This body is growing in strength and
numbers.
It has already entered the workshop as an “ unofficial-”
movement.
These workers alone could assist Russia at the present-
moment. But they are a minority—a small minority.
And every move they make is followed by persecution
and imprisonment. One day, however, they will be assisted
by a great force —the idea that saw the light of day in
Russia will be once more triumphantly on the march.
Every British workman will then have: to be at his
post, and he. will have to know and feel his awful respon-
sibility. Until then—it might be said, the Russian Revolu-
tion has. awakened In the British workman an interest not
so- much in Russia as in himself as a workman. This new
knowledge is being accumulated and propagated. Intelligent
action will follow on amain.

The World Revolution.
CHAPTER I.
THE NEED FOR A WORLD REVOLUTION.
The world revolution approaches as a result of this first
world-war.
Just as a terrific storm passing- through an immense
forest bends the trees on every side, so has the world-war
bent the proletariat in all directions.
For years a misdirected propaganda had been carried
on, aiming only at reform, and therefore not recognising the
danger of Imperialism and of the approaching world-war.
The world proletariat, deceived by their Governments, and
betrayed by their leaders, were handed over to Imperialism
and to the war.
But they will overcome all their differences and will once
more in complete unity renew the struggle.
The war could only continue, and can only be carried
on now, simply because the workers of the world are not
united.
And the Russian Revolution, betrayed by the proletariat
of Europe and America, and in the first instance by the
German working class, shows clearly that every revolution
of the proletariat must ultimately fail if the international
proletariat do not present a united front to world Imperialism.
The revolution draws near as a result of this first world
war. The proletariat of Europe and America will rise against
Imperialism, and after a long and bitter fight will bring it to
an, end. But Imperialism, cannot be overthrown unless
Capitalism is also' overthrown.
The coming fight, the coming revolution, is also the
social revolution, the revolution for Socialism. f\nd the


revolution of the European and American proletariat will
finally establish Socialism throughout the whole world.
It is therefore not only a European and American revol-
ution, but a world revolution that approaches.
It is the duty of all true revolutionaries to investigate
the conditions of this revolution for Socialism, to prepare for
it in advance, and to set up an international programme of
our demands.
This will be done in the following pages
The proletariat as a whole stands opposed to Imperial-
ism. It stands, against all the Imperialisms in the world.
There are no. better or worse Imperialisms. The
Imperialisms of the two great groups, Germany on the one
hand, England and America on the other, are equally bad,
and equally hateful, to the workers of the world.
This is the first thing that ought to be shown, for only
when the workers realisei that there is no. choice between the
two, that they are seriously threatened from both sides, and
that there is no means, of escape from the two frightful
Imperialisms; only when the proletariat realise that, will they
understand that a world revolution against world Imperialism
is necessary for the workers of the world.
We will show in the first place the need of a world
revolution bv showing the need of Imperialism to suppress
and slaughter the proletariat, even after this war; and the
similarity of these suppressions and murders, by each and
all Imperialisms.
Secondly, there is no way out of this suppression and
slaughter, except by a world revolution. Thirdly, the prac-
ticability of a world-revolution and its programme. Fourthly,
that the Russian Revolution is an example of the world
revolution for the proletariat. In the sth Chapter we shall
review the whole.
The greatest opponents, the; leaders, in the fight for
world power —England and Germany—the only belligerents
who had the might, which means the right, to carry on
this struggle now stand face to face On One Front, from the
North Sea to. the Mediterranean, with all their forces. The
fight for world dominion has begun.
Russia, who. had a bureaucratic and militaristic, but no
strong Capitalist Imperialism, and who was therefore not ripe


for this war, has dropped out. Only a few of the little States
on both sides remain.
The United States of America have now entered the war,
and it has now become in earnest a fight for the domination
of the world.
If Germany wins she will rule Europe and a great part
of Asia and Africa, and she will have made the first step
towards world dominion. Should England and the United
States win, then they will rule the world.
'The United States realised this and therefore the}'
entered the war. Tike Rome and Carthage, Germany and
England (with the United States) stand opposed. Romo and
Carthage fought on the Mediterranean and its coasts; now
the fight extends over every sea and ocean, and the lands
between, And like the struggle of old, there is no hope; of
reconciliation; it must be l a fight to a finish, till one side or
the other is victorious.
This fight is for the domination of the world, and so
long as people have this object in view they will use every
means and make any sacrifice, even to the extent of sacrific-
ing half the nation’s young blood, in order to obtain it.
In the pamphlet, “ Imperialism, the World War, and
Social Democracy,” I wrote that German Imperialism is as
dangerous to the international proletariat as the English. I
should now say, ‘‘as the English-American. ”
The question arises; Is that exactly true? Or is it
simply a contention? Perhaps it is prompted by the wish
to class all Imperialisms alike in order to make it more easy
to secure the necessary unity of all the international prole-
tariats.
Now let us examine this for a moment. Because if fh©
imperialism of one power be more dangerous to the interna-
tional proletariat than the Imperialism of another, then the
proletariat ought to desire the defeat of the first and oppose
it with all its strength. Then could the welfare of the
proletariat be ensured bv the victory of one. Then would the
revolution perhaps be almost impossible or unnecessary.
In order to ascertain clearly whether the; victory of one
Imperialism would bring greater disadvantage to the work-
ing class than other, wc must picture to ourselves, what


would be the result of a complete victory of the one, and then
of the other*.
If Germany is victorious that means that she can impose
her own conditions. She will hold Belgium in her power;
she will seize: a still larger part of the coal-mining district of
France; she will retain possession of Lithuania, Esthonia,
Livonia, Courland, and Poland, and perhaps Finland. She
will make Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and Rumania, and
perhaps Greece, into dependencies of Austria. She will
give Turkey territory up to the-Persian Gulf. She will split
Russia up into parts, making them German dependencies.
She will rule lb© Balkans and Turkey; she will force France
and Italy into an alliance with her; she will take back her
Colonies, and some, of the Colonies of the others.
Germany is then master from the coast of Flanders and
Fmden to the Persian Gulf; and through Siberia into
northern and central Asia.
Germany has reached the goal for which she planned
and carried on the war.
Germany, through her military, political and economic
supremacy, and through the trade restrictions she can
impose, thus acquires complete control over Scandinavia and
Holland. Germany, then, rules Europe and a great part
of Asia-, up to the very gates of British India.
But although Eng'land and the United States have been
defeated on the Continent of Europe, they are not destroyed.
Their sea power is still unbroken.
Germany, in order to> have world power, must: have
sea power, and in order to get that, must forthwith prepare
for another war. Arbitration, disarmament, reduction of
armaments, are impossible; neither Germany nor England,
nor the United States, want it. That would kill world
power and stop the exploitation and domination of the
earth. That is not what they desire; thev want to maintain
Imperialism, and that can be done only by force.
Arbitration, disarmament : these watch-words arc merelv
lies which they, supported by confederates such as the
■'■'‘ln order to know how a thing - operates we must examine it
scientifically. We must do this here with both Imperialisms, and there-
fore must regard both as in possession of full power.


Reformers and the pseudo-Marxists, betray the workers
with and keep them quiet, and enable them to prosecute this
and the following war.
What, then, are the results of a 'Germany victory?
As soon as she has recovered in a measure from the
effects of this war, Germany will immediately prepare with
all her power for the next. To the numerous weapons,
invented during this war she will add others still more
terrible. By her political and military supremacy she will
force the same course on all her Allies : Turkey, Austria-
Hungary, Poland, the Balkans, Scandinavia, Holland, Italy,
France, and Russia. The German organisation of the
gigantic trusts, banks, factories, railroads, and shipping,
will bo imposed on Europe from Holland to Constantinople.
The Prussian-German spirit, that bastard born of
despotism and slavery, presses itself through and over all
Europe and rules everywhere. And the, people; of Europe
must obey unless they wish to be politically and economically
extinguished. This is, the German “ League of Nations,”
the German “ world-peace,” that Germany wants and which
through victory she will obtain.
The working class will then be oppressed and scattered
by the weight of militarism, trusts, and enterprising com-
panies, in every country in Europe. And at last the second
world war will break out, and It will be still more terrible
than the first: the world war for the control of Asia and
Africa. And 1 the; members of the working class will be sent
out once more to destroy each other.
These arc the results of a victory for German Imperial-
ism.
Now to the British-American. If Britain and America
win and are in a position to dictate terms, Germany will
have Alsace-Lorraine, Prussian Poland, and all her Colonies,
taken from her, and perhaps also German territory up, to the
Rhine. Austria will be divided into main 1 Stales. Poland
will receive a part of Prussia and Galicia. The Balkans will
come under British direction. The territory of Turkey will
be divided up.
That the United States have made a condition that
Austria, the Balkans and Turkey, must withdraw themselves
from German influence; and that Arabia, Mesopotamia and


Syria shall be “ independent,” only goes to show how much
the United States have made the policy of Britain their own
policy. For if these conditions are fulfilled, then the British
world Empire, from the Cape through Cairo to India, will
be established. To be sure for this Britain has promised
her help to the United States in the East Asiatic and Pacific
regions. Besides, Germany would be saddled with an
enormous war debt, under the name of “ indemnities ” and
“reparations,” which, in yearly payments, would continue
for a great; number of years. Her Fleet would bo reduced to
a number of small craft. Heligoland would become a
British fortress. Through the loss of coal mines in Lorraine
she would bo considerably weakened. She would then stand
absolutely powerless against England and America.
Russia will be in a like position if the Revolution is not
able to withstand the pressure of the victorious Imperialism
of the Entente. Weakened by internal troubles and counter-
revolutions there is no saying what may happen. The
United States would obtain great Influence there.
France and Italy would receive a large slice: of the boot}'.
France especially would soon rapidly develop by means of
her re-captured coal and iron mines. But these States are
not powerful enough to “ play the game ” with England and
America. There are only these two and Japan.
It can easily be seen what Japan is after. She makes
largo claims in China, Manchuria, Siberia, lower India, etc.,
and therefore her power must be broken. The colossal
British Fleet (almost doubled during the war), with the new
Fleet of the United States, dominates all.
We state hero in advance that these two Allies will
remain together. Their Capitalistic interests have been
welded together closely during the war, and it will certainly
be to their advantage to remain together.
What is, then, the, fate of the world? The United
States and Britain will do everything to prevent any other
State becoming as powerful as themselves. For this purpose
they will divide Europe: into a number of small States; and
in order to dominate and exploit them they will try to keep
them Weak. They will capture the markets of the world
while Germany and Russia are still weak.


Europe, France* Italy* and the small States will
Simply be their servants; It will be the same in Central and
South America; It will be as if two Emperors rode in one
Carriage followed by a crowd of vassals.
In all political differences in Europe and America they
Will play off one State against another; just as England in
the past (we are silent here concerning her many conquests
and deeds of violence) prevented .Russia, Turkey, the
Balkans, Asia Minor, Egypt, Persia, India, and therefore
the whole of the Near and Far East, attaining independence
and power, by either putting one against the other, or by
directly plundering them herself; so will England and the
United States deal with Germany, Austria, Poland, Russia,
Turkey and the Balkans. Similarly in America with Mexico,
Brazil, Peru, Argentina, etc.
The United .States and England will turn Central and
Eastern Europe into a perfect hell. The provinces cut off
irom Germany, Poland the new States formed from Austria-
Hungary, the new Russian States, the Balkan peoples and
the Turks, will be continually at.war with one another, and
during this time England and the United States will rule the
world. They will endeavour to make Germany economically
dependent on English-American capital. Russia will bo
flooded with it. They will establish everywhere branches of
their trusts and banks; and where they do not succeed in
doing so* will seek to destroy those in existence.
They will reduce Germany to such a condition of
weakness as to' compel her to act in conjunction with them
in the interest of their profits. For they are masters of the
sea and of the overseas markets.
Asia and Africa will be completely at their mercy, to
rob and exploit as they choose; especially China, which is
partly governed by themselves and partly by despots paid by
them. Now, Germany in her fight against a superior Power,
should at least be forced to develop and make powerful
Austria, Turkey, the Balkans, Asia-Minor, and other States.
England and America do not require to do so because they
have a monopoly, and also because' they are not threatened.
In Central Europe the principal Power has. fallen. —the
only Power that could venture to go to war with England


and America. She is politically, and in a great measure
economically, broken, and the other States are too' small and
too weak to fight, and are helpless and torn by their own
internal troubles. All are alike with the exception of Eng-
land. Europe is powerless. The political wars of nations,
a prime factor in the progress of Capitalism, are now
eliminated. In Central and South America the same condi-
tions prevail.
And the possibility of developing themselves or of
obtaining independence in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Arabia,
Egypt, Persia, India, China, etc., has disappeared! for a long
time to come.
A weak, broken Europe, a weak South America, Asia
and Africa, a weak, broken world—that is the aim of
American politics.
But the United States, England and Japan, do- not trust
one another, and apart from them there are France and
Italy, still great powers, and Russia and Germany still
gathering strength and becoming themselves again.
There are always powerful coalitions to be feared, and
people begin immediately to prepare for the new w orld w ar.
And this is the “ League of Nations ” and the “ world
peace” of the United States and England, for which Presi-
dent Wilson, Asquith and Lloyd George made so much
propaganda; and in which Germany, as soon as she became
democratised will also have a place! And for this purpose
they w-ant the self-determination of the peoples of Europe
(but not of those of Asia nor of Africa)—the self-determin-
ation that those peoples make who arc not strong but weak;
and which merely serves to prevent strong Coalitions under
Germany’s leadership, and enables them to rule Europe
themselves*.
This problem is a most serious- one, and it is fraught
with great danger. The national proletariat who are led
by the Reformists trust the Liberals and Democrats, and the
international proletariat trust the Imperialism of the Great
citizen democracies.
And so long as this trust continues, so long as the
French, English, American, Belgian, etc., workers believe
that the English-American Imperialism is one whit better


than the German; so long will there be no unity of the
proletariats, no new International, and no enthusiastic fight
by the world proletariat for the world revolution.
Therefor© another word or two about this.
Wilson’s aim: the independence and self-determination
of all European nations and a League of Nations, is im-
possible. For the interests of all those nations are different;
and there arc some strong ones and some weak ones among
them. This must, under Capitalism (divided into national
Capitalisms as it still is) lead to dictation and oppression.
It cannot be otherwise.
It is extremely hypocritical on the part of England and
America, after destroying the power of Germany, to grant
independence to all European nations. For the interests of
England and America make; it necessary that no single
Power on the Continent shall grow strong. Therefore this
independence is only an appearance. It is merely a means
to gain their end, and that is to make the European nations
political and economic vassals of both Anglo-Saxon nations.
Ihe truth is this: there can be no independence under
Imperialism. Should Germany win there would be set up
a League of Nations in which the nations would not bo
independent, but simply subjects of Germany. Should the
Allies win they would set up a League of Nations in which
all would be weak except England and America; and their
weakness would force them to submit to these two.
The aim of both Imperialisms is the same : the subjection
ot the nations, command of the world, world-power, world-
domination.
Germany murders independence openly and cruelly;
England and America allow it to. exist in appearance, but
kill it in reality.
The difference, is only apparent, not real.
The difference between German and Anglo-American
Imperialism is the same as that between Conservatism and
Liberalism, between Absolution and Republicanism, between
Aristocracy and Democracy.
There is only one difference between the Imperialism of
a reactionary absolutist autocracy and the Imperialism of
Liberal republican democracy, and that is in appearance; in
reality they are alike.


Real independence cannot be attained under Capitalism,
whether it be an autocracy or a democracy. Capitalism and
Imperialism tend inevitably to the subjection of the nations.
The reason is that the monopolistic banking interests
in Germany, England, and the United States, arc all-
powerful, and rule the whole world. It is characteristic
that, in regard to this matter, Capitalism is in a blind alley.
This question, as so many others, can only be solved by
Socialism.
It is true, then, that the German spirit of naked brutality
will not rule. German Imperialism has become powerless.
But into its place has stepped the powerful Anglo-
American monopoly, by which a great part of the world has
been brought to a standstill, and nearly the whole of it into
subjection.
And the spirit of this Imperialistic monopoly is the rough
brutality and corruption of American Capitalism, united with
the refined brigandage of the English, which makes their
victims powerless.
What a combination. Refined hypocracy and false
democracy !
And what will be the effect of this Imperialism on the
proletariats of the world? The American-English banks, the
American-English trusts, will rule the world. It will be very
difficult for other countries to compete with them. They
will often be forced to submit.
The struggle of the proletariats will also be made diffi-
cult, almost impossible, against this monopolv.
And this American-English Capitalism will do as the
English have always done—buy one part of the proletariat
and pit it against the other. That part will be a well paid,
well-organised, well developed proletariat. They will use
these well-fed, well-clothed, well-housed, well-educated pro-
letarians as bloodhounds and executioners of the remainder
of the proletariat and of the weak nations. On these people
ihev can always reckon in their fight against the poorer
proletariat, whom they will always be able to' stir up against
the weaker nations.
A paid army such as this constitutes the greater danger
to the international proletariat. It will raise an army of


traitors in all countries. It will be able to do this, for it wiM
have the monopoly since Germany’s fall. And it will be able
to oppress the “ unskilled,” the under-fed, the poorly-paid,
the badly-housed, the miserably poor workers, as much as it
likes; and the greatest number will belong to this category.
Besides, the workers will be pressed into the army.
This, then, is the ‘‘world peace” of American-linglish
Imperialism. And this is the world peace that a part of the
bourgeoisie of the neutral countries so earnestly desired !
But under this Imperialism war will 'break out again.
For Germany will gather strength again, Russia will again
rise, and China will not suffer herself to remain in slavery.
The world, will not remain patient. It cannot suffer the
absolute rule of Amcrican-English capital.
Capital itself is not international enough for that.
Besides, the predatory countries are still too numerous and
the noise of friction too audible. New coalitions will form
themselves against England and America. These two
Powers may disagree, and the proletariats of the world will
be thrown again into the blood bath and slaughtered whole-
sale.
These, then, are the results of German and of Anglo-
American Imperialism.
On the one side Germany all-powerful on the Continent
of Europe with German militarism everywhere, and in a
short'time a still more frightful world war.
On the other side England and the United States all-
powerful over the whole earth, with subjection or weakness
and stagnation everywhere. And after a little time another
bath of hlood.
If this first world war does not come to a real decision,
the struggle will soon be renewed and the two ‘‘ Leagues
of Nations ” will engage in another massacre.
On both sides subjection and slaughter of the working
people of the world.
And in any case slaughter and oppression for the prole-
tariats. That is the future.
Worker, choose! Both sides decoy you with their
I-eague of Nations. Both say: ‘‘We are not Imperialistic;
it is the others who are! ” But, indeed, both threaten you
uith subjection and destruction.


If one should ask the workers which they would prefer—
the despotism, the brutality, the carnage of German Imper-
ialism - or the brutality of the American, united with the
refined exploitation of Eng-fish Imperialism, through
which the blood bath always comes—the workers would
reply: “We don’t know; the results of both arc alike
frightful.”
So it is.
The German and the Anglo-American imperialisms are
indeed alike terrible for the proletariat.
The German, English, and American, and all other
proletariats on earth are threatened in the same manner and
in the same measure by German and English'-American
Imperialism.
But the workers can also unite. They can form a
League in which one national proletariat will stand up for
the other; a League like a Trade Union, or a Trust of
workers, who will fight together against world Imperialism;
for their interests are really the same.
Only the combined .English, German and Americim
proletariats, and therefore only the combined proletariats of
the world, can destroy German and English-American Im-
perialism—can destroy Imperialism generally, world
Imperialism.
Every national, and also the whole international, prole-
tariat must fight energetically against both. The workers
of all countries must have a united front. They will then
be able to attack and destroy both at the same time.
They must establish an International to destroy both at
the same time.
The two great Imperialisms are of the same stamp.
And since the Imperialisms of all nations in the world are
united with, or subject to, these two—Germany on one
hand, England and America on the other—so it is true that
for all the workers on earth, for the whole world proletariat,
the Imperialism of both groups, and Imperialism in general,
are alike terrible.
Therefore it is certain that the workers of the world will
again be oppressed and destroyed by Imperialism. And
because of more slaughter and more oppression by Imper-
ialism (for no matter how the war ends it is certain that the


proletariats of the world will be again oppressed and sacri-
ficed), therefore a revolt of the workers of the world is
necessary.
But international Imperialism cannot be overthrown
unless international Capitalism is also overthrown.
The Revolution, the social world revolution, against
Capitalism is therefor© necessary for the world proletariat.
We shall prove this in the first place.
All those who prefer one Imperialism to another stand in
a false position.
They divide the international proletariat and make its
victory over Imperialism impossible. They are all, whether
social-patriots, psuedo-Marxists, or parties in neutral
countries, playing the game of the German and English-
American Imperialists, and of the international Capitalist
classes, and Governments.
They stand on the side of these classes and Govern-
ments and assist Imperialism.
They divide and distinguish two groups of
Imperialism—the English-American under the mask of
democracy; German under the mask of .absolutism —for the
purpose of showing the proletariat that their own brand of
Imperialism has not come to stay; or that it is only out to
obtain peace, or that the enemy Imperialism is the only
Imperialism, or to show that it is much worse than their own.
This is done by Wilson, Bethmann-Holweg, von Kuhlman,
Lloyd George, Poincare, Czernin, Asquith. This is the
object of their speeches; by this deception alone are they
able to declare war and continue it; by this alone can they
support it; and these Socialists help them to do it.
But only by one united world proletariat can world
Imperialism be defeated.
The position is really similar to the internal politics of
the national ruling classes, who separate the workers by the
watchwords, Liberal, Clerical, Conservative, Democrat, etc.
—watchwords which, under Imperialism, are fast disappear-
ing. They are now being divided into more gigantic
masses, into world-masses —Imperialists and wwkers; into
supporters of the Workers’ International, and supporters of
this or that Imperialism.-
German Imperialism, as the cruellest and most brutal
run by an autocracy, takes the place of the Conservatives and
Reactionaries.


Englsh-American Imperialism, as more deceitful and
more hypocritical, governed by a so-called democracy, takes
the place of the Liberals.
In reality they are both alike.
The Great Imperialists—the Kaisers, the Kings, the
Presidents, the Governors,'of the English, American and
German banks; the Ministers' and Politicians—know well
what they are about. 'They know that, through these
divisions, and through these divisions alone (for the prole-
tariat is already so powerful that were it united inter-
nationally it would destroy the Imperialism of all States,
would destroy Imperialism itself), by splitting the proletariat
into two groups, will they be able to accomplish their aim.
That aim is a great and lasting victory for Bank Capital, and
the placing of the world under its control.
The proletariat as a whole must unite against Imperial-
ism as a whole—against all Imperialisms. This can only be
done if the proletariat realises that the German and English-
American international Imperialisms are the same; if it is
not to be as formerly, Liberal over Clerical; if one
Imperialism is not to be looked upon as a “ lesser evil ” than
the other, and set up over the other; if it is not to bo an
alliance with one, then there will not be a national, but ari
international reformism. In national politics, to set up
Liberalism over Conservatism, or' Conservatism over
Clericalism, is national reformism. In international politics,
tc set up Democratic Imperialism over Absolutist Imper-
ialism, is “international reformism.’’ It is a weakness of
mind on the part of the proletariat to hope that one part
of Capitalism, the democratic part, is in a position to make
“reforms” or settle questions that only Socialism is in a
position to do.
Just as those who, in the nation placed Liberal ovc
Clerical politics, prevent the national unity of the proletariat;
so those who place English-American Imperialism over
German prevent the unity of the international proletariat.
National and international reformism ought both to be
strongly opposed and destroyed.
The main thing for the proletariat is a realisation of the
fact that both Imperialisms are alike; that their aims and
their effects are alike destructive; and, realising this, to unite
for the destruction of both.


CHAPTER II.
NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE PROLETARIAT.
“ The Imperialism of both groups is alike terrible for
the proletariat.
It can only be destroyed by a united world proletari it.
The world revolution is therefore a necessity.”
This that we said in the first chapter should be suffi-
cient. It should be sufficient that all Imperialisms, that the
Imperialisms of both groups of all nations, are alike terrible
for the proletariat, and that therefore the proletariat of all
nations ought to unite to destroy Imperialism.
We should go on to prove that the destruction of
Imperialism, the world revolution, is possible for the prole-
tariat if the Governments, the bourgeoisie, the social-
patriots, and the pseudo-Marxists of all countries, the
Majority and Minority in France and Italy, the Majority and
the Independents of Germany, the Labour Party and the
pacifist Socialists in England, and all the great Socialist
parties of the United States.—in short, all Capitalists and all
Socialists in the world, with the exception of the real
revolutionaries, had not made it appear to the workers that
between Socialism and Imperialism there was still another
nay out.
They had told the workers that after the war
Imperialism and Imperialistic Capitalism would bring about
disarmament, compulsory arbitration, a League of Nations,
and a general peace. The Capitalists, the social-patriots, the
psuedo-Marxists, the Labour Party and the pacifist Socialists
in England, the Majority and the Independents in Germany,
the Majority and the Minority in France and Italy, and the
Socialists in the United States, said this in order to hold
back the world proletariat from revolution.
It was represented to them that if Capitalism was able
to stop the war, it would be able to develop peacefully, and
the world revolution would not then be necessary.
Since these representations have a powerful counter-
revolutionary significance, especially on account of the
number and the power of those who make them, it is the duty
of every revolutionary to prove again and again that they
are false.


Before going on to show the practicability of a revolu-
tion we shall state what will happen.
In all Capitalistic States, in all Capitalistic nations,
millions and millions of workers in their own countries and
in the Colonies will produce quantities of new surplus wealth
every year.
This mass of wealth will grow continually greater year
by year, and will be added to the old capital.
There are still many countries in the world with great
natural treasures and weak populations, from whom colossal
profits ('an be extracted.
New capital seeks these fields of exploitation.
This is the cause of Imperialism.
All the countries of the earth already have masters.
The earth is already divided up.
The nations must fight to get the best places.
This is the cause-of Imperialist: wars.
There are three particular Capitalistic States whose
mass of capital has grown so large that they quarrel with
each other in eveirv corner of the earth for profit.
These are England, Germany, and the United States.
The millions of workers in England, Germany, and the
United States of America, have worked so hard for so many
years with such unceasing energy that the Capitalists in
these countries aim at the monopoly of world power.
These three gigantic nations now fight really for the
domination of the world.
Do not sav that this picture is overdrawn, that no one
nation or group of nations will ever be able to succeed in
dominating the world. For the nature of capital is such
that it creates ever more surplus wealth, that it can produce
unlimited quantities of surplus wealth if it can only obtain
ever more: workers, raw materials, and machines. Every
powerful Capitalist State, every powerful Capitalist nation,
feels, therefore, that if it had only more countries subject
to it, the* existence of capital gives to it the possibility of
at last being able to conquer the world.
These three giants rise out of the struggle of all Capi-
talist: nations.
And two of them, England—and by this name we mean
the British World Empire, England with her Colonics and


dominions—and the United States have combined, perhaps
for a long time, perhaps for a short time, perhaps for ever,
in order to strive for the domination of the world.
And as in. the economic struggle, the most powerful
syndicates ultimately absorb the smaller companies, so also
these three great powers unite all the lesser ones in two
groups in order to carry on the world struggle*
The development of Capitalism has reached its highest
point. Only a few gladiators remain in the arena.
International Capitalism now approaches the struggle
through which it will be brought to an end.
And just as the struggles of the small cities in the
Middle Ages resulted in the formation of the little Medieval
States; and just as the struggle between these little States
resulted in the formation of great national States—so now
there is being formed, as a result of the struggle between
the great national States, the two groups, the great alli-
ances, the two I-eagues of Nations.
In and through the struggles of the medieval cities arose
the power of the small burgher or citizen.
In and through the struggles of the national ‘States
arose the power of the groat bourgeoisie. In and through the
struggles of the groups of nations arose the power of the
great Capitalists, of the monopolists of industry, of the banks
and of the trusts.
And just as the burghers and the bourgeoisie arose
through the struggles of the princes, the nobles and the
Church, so also will arise now, out of the struggle of all the
*\Vith the intention of making the problem of the world war and
disarmament perfectly clear, we have tried to simplify the struggle by
confining it to the three greatest nations. As a matter of fact, the
struggle is much more complex: it embraces all *the nations of the
world ; and on that account the settlement of the problem by peaceful
means makes it still more impossible. In the pamphlet, “ Imperialism,
the World War and Social Democracy ” (pages 119-142) we have made
this perfectly clear. There also we have shown the economic causes
that make a world peace and a League of Nations impossible. If in the
future England and the United States should become separated that
would not alter the fact that we are now subject to World-Imperialism.
Each of these States would then try to obtain world domination; each
would set about forming new groups and would arrange new alliances
(for example, say with Germany or Japan). They would then do just
as they are doing now.


Capitalist nations, out of the struggles of the monopolists who
wish to dominate all countries, another, a third power—the
proletariat of the world.
And whilst the two greatest powers of the earth, the
two groups of all the Capitalistic nations, and the mon-
opolists of all lands struggle for the domination of the
world, the world proletariat will rise up against them and
become masters of the world.
Capitalism, having attained its highest point, blossomed
into monopoly, and in its struggle for the monopoly of the
earth it shall be destroyed by the proletariat.
In its perfect bloom, its last and greatest
straining every muscle, developed to the highest pitch
to! struggle for the monopoly of world power, it is broken
in the struggle for its existence, and out of the last blaze of
its power a new world stands forth.
Capitalism began with private ownership.
The few Capitalists have grown through the, possession
of capital into, a numerous and powerful class. This has
developed into the posession. of all capital and its direction
by a few.
And it dies in full bloom. The blossoms fall and the new
world steps forth.
The workers at the end of the eighteenth century united
to fight their employers. The Socialists in the middle of the
nineteenth century united in national parties to fight the
national bourgeoisie. They now unite 1 internationally to
fight the international bourgeoisie.
And in this unity they will conquer.
Why do not the national Capitalists unite with each
other? Why do not Germany, England and the United
States unite? Why do they not work together for the,
exploitation of all the workers—and of all the world? For
then their power would be much greater; they would not
need to fight with one another, and they would bo able to
prevent the proletariat from fighting, perhaps, for the
revolution.
The answer is, firstly : Their capitals are national and
not international. The international capitals in comparison
with the national capitals are only a very small part of
capital.


And secondly: The national Capitalists have different
interests and different aims.
What arc their aims? What arc the aims of the three
great nations? As we have already said, Germany wants to
subjugate Belgium, Poland, France, Russia, Austria-
Hungary, the Balkans, Turkey, Asia Minor, Armenia,
Mesopotamia, Syria, Persia, perhaps Siberia, and other
parts of Asia, thus making the first step towards world
domination. Established on the coasts of the Indian Ocean
she is then ready for the second world war to capture India,
the Pacific Ocean, and all the countries bordering it; then
Africa, and the domination of the world.
England wants to spread her World Empire over Africa,
through Asia to India.
The United States want to rule on the Pacific Ocean, in
China, in the Indian Archipelago, in Polgynesia, in Central
and South America, and perhaps in the northern part of
Asia. Then England and the United States will rule almost
the whole world.
And by what means can the three reach their goal,
world domination?
As we have already said, Germany through the union
of Europe under her leadership: the United States and the
English World Empire through the breaking up of Europe.
And how will they obtain these means?
Bv fighting, bv war.
Just imagine to vcurselves, workers of Europe and
America, workers of the world, whom they want to deceive
and keep under Capitalism, and hold back from revolution
with the hope that world peace, disarmament, and a League
of Nations are possible—just imagine to yourselves that
the war is ended. Imagine that the slaughter of humanity
is over. Imagine in the first place that England and America
have won. Then are Africa and Asia, Central and South
America, and all the world markets practically in their
power; and the Continent of Europe is helpless.
Then Imagine to yourselves that Germany has* won.
Then Germany has a part of Africa and stands before the
gates of India, and probably also before those of China.
Then imagine to* yourselves that neither of them has
won. Then the situation is the same as before the war.


Place these three cases: —the only three possibilities —
clearly before vour eyes, and ask yourself then : Will there be
no more wars after this one?
If England and the United Stales win, will a weakened
and broken-up Europe suffer that ? Will Germany not place
herself at the head of Europe and try to rise again?
And now put the second case clearly before your eyes.
Germany at the end of the war, after “peace” has been
signed, stands at the gates of India and China, and within
the gates stand the Engdish and American powers.
What will happen? Think upon it, workers. Will
England and the United States not try to' drive Germany
back ?
Now place the third case before your eyes. The war
ends without a decision. There is no victor and no van-
quished. Then all remain as they were before the war —
Germany encircled by England and her Allies, and continu-
ing to arm and prepare for the world war. Will Germany
now disarm, and will England and America refrain from
pressing her ?
Consider how these great powers jostle each other now.
They stand on one another’s borders. Remember that on
the other side of their boundaries lie: countries that offer
splendld opportunities for Capitalist exploitation at the
highest possible profit. Remember that the two groups want
ttie same lands—Africa and Asia, and now Russia.
Remember that these countries' are abundantly rich, and yet
almost unexploited. Millions, nay, billions, there await the
exploiter. Worker, remember the nature of capital. Its
substance is spreading in ever greater quantities. Consider
that through your labour and through that of all the peoples
subject to, or allied with, the two groups, the power of
capital continually increases. The two groups stand facing'
earh other on the frontiers. Within their boundaries is the
ever-growing .mass of capital. And without lies the boo tv —
Profit.
What do you think, then? Will there be another war?
You can gi\c no other answer but yes.
So long as the Capitalists of Germany, England, and
the United States have different aims and want to possess


the same countries and to dominate the world; so long- as
they remain national and not international, there will Ire war.
The possibility of disarmament, of the League of
■Nations, of general peace, has been refuted. Enough has
been said lor any discerning- worker.
But si ace the blood-dripping Governments, the Capi-
talists, the- Social Patriots, and the pseudo-Marxists, still
seek by many arguments to belrav and deceive the. workers,
we tire obliged to attack and expose them.
The Governments and bourgeois parlies of all countries,
the Social Patriots and false radicals, the Majority and the
Independent Socialists in Germany, the .Majority and
Minority in France, the Labour Party and the Paeiiist
Socialists, in England, and all the great Socialist Parlies in
the United Slades who propagate the ideas of peace, dis-
armament, or the reduction of armaments, all those who
made the war, or permitted it, all must show- how these are
possible and in what way they can be accomplished. Thcv
ought to show, not by hollow phrases, but bv facts, what
thcv tit ink about the Peace arrangements.
Which parts of the earth ought England, Germans', or
tiie United Stales, to receive?
Which parts should go to the little nations, or to France,
Italy, japan, Austria, Hungary, Turkey, etc.? They ought
to show this on the map so that everybody can see that it
is right and just, and that no new wars shall come out of the
Treaty. They should show in what manner the territories
should be divided, and lto\v confidence can be. established
among the various nations, so that they mav discontinue
military preparations.
Workers, they- are unable to do this. When asked to
deal with concrete facts they refuse. Lip to the present lime
nobody has. been able to define boundaries on the map which
would give satisfaction to every Power. Their talk is
specious—empty words — hollow catch-phrases without sig-
nificance. President Wilson, the sanguinary humanitarian
o! the United States, and all the Capitalist Governments,
never cease to mouth the phrases, Justice ! Freedom ! Right !
The; Governments of the bourgeoisie, the reformists
dripping- with blood, say: “ Establish a political Trust of
Nations similar to the economic trusts formed hv the


Capitalists. This would obviate competition, and the
nations would work together, but in different spheres. In
this, way England, Germany,' and the. United States of
America, would divide up the world and establish a Trust
for their profit.”
This comparison with Trusts is misleading. There is a
most decided difference. One which has prevented States
in ancient times from forming a Trust for the exploitation
of the world.
The difference is this; The economic trust deals with
dead things; with gold and merchandise. These it can easily
rule nationally and internationally.
But States are living forms comprised of human beings,
and everything that lives develops. Thus it would happen,
even were a satisfactory division and regulation arrived
at, that after a short time conditions would alter. The
economic and capital power would change so that one o(
the. masters would be more powerful than the others; or (he
subject nation would become strong enough to shake ott the
yoke and become masters themselves. Then wc should have
another war.
Human beings cannot be united in such a Trust or
Teague. The nations of old, who aimed at world power,
tried it and failed. It cannot be done now . •
The hypocritical bourgeoisie and the German Govern-
ment, who have murdered thousands, yes, tens of thousands,
of sailors, give out the erv : ‘‘ ‘J he Freedom ot the Seas.
Give us that and war will end.” But in peace time the seas
were free. The war has made no difference in that respect.
The gory Capitalists and Governments, who began the
war on account of profit and trade competition, say: ” Free
Trade. —give us Free Trade, no preferential tariffs or taxes —
then shall we have peace.”
But how do they establish trade in primitive countries —
in Central Africa? By Force, by Murder and War!
This war only decides who shall carry the weapons;
who shall perpetrate the murders —Germany or England.
Business prospers best where the business people have
political power. If these primitive, countries are free to all
alike, a struggle for political power must ensue sooner or
later.


Trad©, however, is no longer the principal object TV ■
is now Capital Export; the making of new capital h
expresses itself in roads, harbours, factories and railways
How does this Imperialism realise itself in Asia ” and
Africa; how are the arrangements for Capitalist production
brought about, with its consequent expropriation and prole-
tarising of the natives? By force! And war alone will
decide which particular nation shall be the expropriator.
The tender pacifists and those Socialists who-, by their
pacifism hypnotised the workers and helped to cause the
war, they also are dripping with blood. They say; "The
costs of another world-war would be too great in money and
men.” But the millions for the conquest of Africa and Asia
will bring their fruit in the shape of billions of interest.
Italy, Roumania, and the- United States of America did
not enter the war before they knew what it would cost.
is not this demand for unity laughable so long as the
interests and strength of the nations arc so decidedly
different; when so many weak nations can be quite easily-
destroyed? Is it not ridiculous?
If England and the United States of America believe
they arc able to- seize everything, why shouild they ally
themselves with Germany? If Germanv wins, whv should
she not trust in the improvement of weapons of war to
obtain more? If the British Empire and the United States
of America possess within themselves almost inexhaustible
sources of wealth, why should they unite with others and
divide with them their profits, which may expand enor-
mously?
So long as Germany- believes she can shatter opposition
bv her military power, why should she share her power
with others?
So long as the-re remain such extensive territories for
Capitalism to conquer—as China, the Near East, Lower
India, parts of Central Asia, and of Africa —so long as
there remain so many weak nations to subject, just so long-
will States trust in their own power and worship the idol
of their own Imperialism.
Should Germany conquer England or the United States
ol America, those Stales would inevitably revolt again.


And if either of the former beat ’Germany, she, too, would
never endure it, but would rise again.
It is obvious that the opposing’ national interests will
prevent a League of Nations being anything but a sham.
There will, indeed, bo established “Leagues of Nations,"
but they will be but alliances of special groups, and will
have as their object the more vigorous exploitation of
weaker nations and to carrv on war against rivals.
The phrase-mongers, the Capitalist Governments, the
false Socialists in all lands, all those who for the sake of
their country betnived the cause of peace 1 —they say :
“ Establish an International Police Force from amongst the
nations, which shall punish all aggressors; and a High
Court of Arbitration which shall decide- who is- guilty."
This, is the most absurd proposal of all, for there is no
surer method of advancing competition in armaments than
this.
The Capitalist State, like man, is sinlul. It was born
o-l ambition, and gain and lust. These are the original sins
of Capitalism, to which it is predestined through the “ fall
of private properly.
livery Slate will be afraid to sin lor fear ol a united
attack by the others. Because of this it must prepare a
defence against all the others in order to attain its ambitions.
It must develop an army and navy capable of combatting
them all. They all know that “interests" will dominate
their judgment, and they know also that it is possible for
the decision to be in favour of an offender. They know that
their interests mav be on the side of an offender, and they
would then defend him and oppose the League. With this
eventuality before them they would prepare huge armies
and navies. 'They will arm and light as before, onlv includ-
ing the “ International Police” in their armourv of canl-
ph rases.
“ Self-Determination for Nations ” is another cry of
these complacent humbugs. “If only every nation were
independent or voluntarily united, then the prime cause of
war will disappear."
But the Great War shows that the opposite: is the case.
Existing small nations like Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro,
Greece, etc., or possible nations like Poland, Esthonia,


Courlan-d, and Finland —all would still be bones, of conten-
tion amongst the great Powers.
The Russian Revolution has surely made the right of
Self-Determination one of the bases of the Revolution; they
have made it one of their principles: but with this vital
difference —they introduce Socialism at the same time.
Without Self-Determination they could not have effected the
Revolution. But they showed also that Self-Determination
under Imperialism was impossible.
And if it be said that the Self-Determination promised
by Germany is only an appearance, even so can it be said
of England and America. It will separate the nations from
one another and perpetuate their weakness. This, sort of
Independence can be even worse for a nation than sub-
jection.
It will be shown in a most terrible way that Self-
Determination can only follow and not precede: Socialism.
Capitalism, and especially Imperialism, cannot settle
the question of nationality. Either they must grant the
small nations independence, in which case they become the
envy of the large nations, or subject and annex them.
Germany follows the latter method in Europe. .She
wants the whole of Europe under her domination in order
to fight England.
England and the United States of America follow the
first method. They want Europe to remain weak, with no
great Power on the Continent, and whilst small nations are
quarrelling amongst themselves,, to build up a colonial sys-
tem and world domination without hindrance.
Capitalism is here in a cleft-stick. It cannot grant
independence to small nations without making them objects
of war; it cannot unite them, without subjecting them; and
in either case it plants the seed of another world-war.
The Capitalist Governments and their underlings all
say: “Disarmament by degrees.” But how' can they dis-
arm whilst they continue to threaten one another?
How can Germany disarm when her enemies dominate
the world and have made Europe powerless ? It would be
suicide —it would ruin Europe.
As we are of a different opinion to some: of our com-
rades who belong to the Extreme Left, and as this question


is closely related to the whole problem of the liberation of
the workers from Imperialism and war, we would like to go
a little deeper into it.
Many Socialists propose as a means of bringing the
war to an end the formula: “No Annexations and no
Indemnities.” But these conditions cannot be put forward
by the proletariat of the world; for their fulfilment would
leave Capitalism exactly where it is, and could be followed
only by new arming and new wars.
But even revolutionary demands, as demands, which the
working class may put forward to upset the Government
and simplify the revolution; even thesei are of no avail, for
ns soon as a Government gets into' a tight corner it will
adopt these demands itself (as Germany did in 1917),
announce them as its own aims, and retort to the workers :
“See, our demands are yours,” and thereby break the
revolution.
“ No annexations and no indemnities ” does not provide
a way out.
That is the horror of the situation, and nothing shows
mono clearly the catastrophic nature of the crisis to which
Imperialism has brought society.
Capitalist nations cannot arrive at any peace: between
themselves, neither during the war nor 'after.
They are compelled at all times to wade deeper in tho
blood-bath. The proletariat under Imperialism can only
have Imperialistic peace or Imperialistic Avar; and every
Imperialist -war means a new and more dreadful Imperialism;
and every Imperialistic peace means a new and more dread-
ful war.
There is only one way out of Imperialism, and war:
the Revolution.
The Capitalist ■Governments of England, France, and
the United States of America, together with those pretended
Socialists who threw away their power and gave themselves
completely to the Militarv General Staffs; who made no real
attempt to secure peace —they are entirely responsible for tho
war; they are the servants of the General Staffs, and, like
them, reek with blood. They talk “Democracy.” If only
we had democracy established in Germany and Austria-
Hungary, the democracies of the world would make peace.


But the plutocratic Republic of France is a “ democracy,”
and world-dominating Britain is a “democracy,” and
America, land of trusts and monopolies, armed strike-
breakers who organise legal murder of -the workers’ leaders,
is also a “ democracy.” Have they done anything to pre-
vent war? No! England, through her policy under
Edward VII. of encircling Germany, helped to bring it on.
America joined in as soon as she discovered that it was a
fight for world-domination. And will these democracies
piake peace if they win? If Germany and a stricken Europe
threaten them with war, or if the Allies are beaten and
Germany at the head of all the nations of Europei threatens
.them still further, will they make peace? No!
In the making of capital abroad, absolute Monarchies
and democratic Republics are alike. In the greed of power,
the lust of profit, all nations are alike.
Monarchies and -democracies under Imperialism are
bells-, full of the same damnation: expansion over the world,
,the fight for world domination.
Monarchies, principalities, and democratic Parliaments,
AH are equally obedient servants of Imperialist Capitalism
and financial interests. Both of these want war, and the
institutions are tools in their hands. These two Interests,
'through their representatives on the Governments and
General Staffs, dictate to the Parliaments what must be
done. The Parliaments and other institutions only possess
power so long as they are obedient to the Capitalist forces.
This power will only be overthrown by the triumph of
the peoples, add until the workers themselves obtain con-
trol, world peace is impossible.
The best example of the truth of this assertion is to be
seen in President Wilson, the servant of the American
trusts and monopolies, which, in order to secure world-
power for themselves, are building armies and fleets powerful
enough to secure victory in all future wars.
These are the principal solutions which the Govern-
ments, Social Patriots, and pseudo-Socialists propose- to
lead Capitalism out of Imperialism.
We have shown them- to be false,'that none of them
stand a moment's investigation by a clear and searching
eye. Theoretically, the investigation shows no way out of


Imperialism for Capitalism. But the proletariat should not
depend upon theory alone, but also on realities.
Already the earth trembles under new wars. Germany
has Poland and Belgium and part of France in her power.
She has broken up Russia, taken possession of the Ukraine,
the Caucasus and Finland; annexed Livonia., Esthonia and
Courland, and reduced Greater Russia to helplessness. She
will do the same with (he rest of Europe. This has been
approved not only bv the Monarchists of Germany, but by
the Democrats and Social Democrats as well —at least bv
the Majority.
England and America -will not suffer this. Is ibis world
peace? Is this disarmament? This is an assurance, an
absolute assurance, of a new war.
If America and England are victorious they will make
all the nations of Europe independent. 'They have openly
stated their intention to do so.
This means Ihcv will break Europe up iulo small pin es
and allow internal jealousies lull plnv; dial they will ensile
internal hells in Germany, Austria-Hungary, Poland, the
Balkans, and Russia; and thus become l undisputed masters
of the world. That is the aim of their hypocritical Lloyd
George and President Wilson. All the Parlies agree with
them, not only the Conservatives, but also the Democrats
and the Socialist Majorities. Europe will never sullcr that,
it will rise under the leadership of Germany and fight. Is
this world peace? "World arbitration and disarmament?
No! It is an absolute assurance of a new world war —of a
succession of world wars.
Proletarians take heed! Notice only the realities about
you. Look at the war volcanoes blazing around you in
Europe, Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, Russia, the Balkans,
Asia, and also in Africa.
Imperialism remains, competition in armaments re-
mains, war remains.
Workers! Remember that the Governments and the
Social Patriots said all these things before the war.
Remember, proletariat of the world, that thev want
to deceive you again, and that after this war they will make
a new compromise, a new alliance with the bourgeoisie.
Remember, workers, that the great social democratic Parlies


at their Congress in Copenhagen and Basle spoke about
world! peace and general disarmament. What good has it
done? None; war has broken out again.
Remember, workers, proletariat of the world, that by
these watchwords., world peace, disarmament, etc., have
the bourgeoisie kept their power over you. Through these
watchwords, they held you back from revolution.
The bourgeoisie knew when you accepted these watch-
words that you agreed to. try peaceful means, and that you
had given up the only real means. —revolution: against war.
They also, knew that they could make, war without any
danger of your rising in revolt, and, therefore, they have
made this war. These watchwords enabled them to do. so.
Workers, will you continue to be befooled by such
catch-phrases? Will you be deceived again by the Capi-
talists. and their Governments, and their henchmen, the false
Socialists?
Txhe Czar of Russia and all' the Governments, held, a,
Conference at the Hague, and said they wanted to. found
a Court of Arbitration. That was, only to. deceive you.
By these devices, they have led you and kept you in the
grip of war.
Thfe Social Patriots have urged you to “fight for
world peace and disarmament.”
By this means they brought you into, the war, and in
Julv-August, 1914, held you back from revolution, because
you were not prepared for revolution; you had placed your
hopes in disarmament and world peace.
They have trapped you into the war by their watch-
words. Will you accept them again and go- to. war?
That is impossible, for by so doing you will be causing
a third war, and perhaps further wars.
It is the use of these 1 Watchwords which help to continue
the war and increase the slaughter. They restrain you from
revolution by promising disarmament, world peace, and a
League of Nations when once peace is established, and they
vote the war credits without opposition.
Trusting their promises you say; “Let us see it
through, for surely the better thing will come.” But: your
hopes are false, and, through these very hopes, is the
slaughter maintained and intensified.


During and after the war these, watchwords will be more
deceptive than formerly, for war has bred hatred deep into
the hearts of the nations, drawn them further apart, made
their interests more opposing and conflicting, and, as we
have already shown, created fresh causes of war.
The mass of capital grows; need for expansion in-
creases; the interest in new wars becomes more powerful
in all parts of the world. New world-wars are much more
certain than before this one commenced.
Will you allow yourselves again to be deluded by their
catch-phrases?
They have given you a false picture of the world peace.
Just because of that came the world war, and what is worse,
the war of the workers against one another. They gave a
false picture of the League of Nations, and as a consequence
have, split the proletariat into national parties.
Will vou allow yourselves to be deceived again? If
you do, another war will come, more frightful than was this,
with a fresh splitting of the proletariat.
There was but one way out of this war, and there is
but one way ol saving us from it—the working class
Revolution.
Workers, the Capitalists of the world have organised
themselves into gigantic groups. In these groups thev have
concentrated their whole strength ior the conquest of the
world for the purpose of lighting* each other for domination.
In this struggle between the Powers, you, the workers, will
be, oppressed and scattered, killed and maimed, for many
years to come. There is no way out for Capitalism from
Imperialism.
The Capitalists, who can only survive by war, now
organise in two groups to fight for the mastery of the
world—they can find no' way out, but stick fast in the mire.
W orkers of the world, the way out of war and Imper-
ialism does not lie, through "Justice," “Freedom of the
Seas,” “ Free Trade,” “Peace without Annexations or
Indemnities,” “ League of Nations,” “ Compulsory Arbitra-
tion,” or “The Right of Self-Determination.” 'these are
all lies and deceitful frauds used to bind you tighter to
Imperialism and to strengthen it.


There is no Justice for you or yours in Capitalism,
There is only one Justice for you.
There is only one Freedom—the freedom of the prole-
tariat.
There is only on© Peace —that is Communism.
There is no Capitalist path from Imperialism, but there
is a proletarian way; that is to overthrow Capitalism. You
can do this if you, the workers, are united in one great
World League; then you can destroy the Imperialisms of
the entire world.
The Revolution —the World Revolution—that, and that
only is the way out.
Imperialism cannot be overthrown except by the
destruction of Capitalism.
This is no prophecy—it is only the plain, unvarnished
truth —a truth verified in actuality by the Russian Revolu-
tion.


CHAPTER III.
THE FEASIBILITY OF THE REVOLUTION.
Socialism emerges from the seas of blood and lies in
which the world has been submerged by Capitalist
Imperialism.
Out of the struggle between the Great Powers of the
world comes the proletariat and pits its strength against
Capitalism.
The proletariat will win in this fight, and will establish
Communism, for Communism is the base of our existence,
the foundation on which rested for many generations the
existence of humanity.
The period of individualism, of private property, is as
a moment compared with' the centuries of Tribal Com-
munism. Now, the old foundation of human existence is
found again.
Communism, from which everything that is useful has
developed, all our wealth, all that is noble in. the hearts
of men, will be. set up again. Communism, of which (ho
great philosophers like Plato have dreamt; Communism
which was the seed and aim of the early Christians; Com-
munism whicch is described and depicted in the sacred
pictures of all great religions; Communism, for which all the
poor and oppressed classes have struggled throughout the
period of private ownership up to our own limes; Com-
munism which was imagined by our Utopists; for which our
comrades of all lands, have given their lives; the Communism
which our great leader, Karl Marx, foresaw, knew, and
understood, the modern Communism, based on scientific
knowledge, of which he laid the foundation stone; this now
comes forth in all its wonder and beauty.
And we. “blessed ones” can see it and fight for it.
Already it lives in one country —Russia, and like a golden
liamo spreads the light of revolution over all the' world.
If the proletariat is united; if the. proletariat of all lands
unite, and fight all Imperialisms as one, nothing can with-
stand them.


If, on the other hand, they do not now unite, the golden
flame will be extinguished and not re-kindled for many
years.
It is now our task as theoreticians of the proletariat to
examine with clear eyes, and to demonstrate the feasibility
of, the world revolution.
If a god had ordained the destiny of mankind, and if
he had prescribed the line of development, matters could not
be belter arranged by the victory of Socialism. ■
Capitalism itself has developed the necessary basis for
the victory.
How different everything has turned out from what our
great master, Marx, expected. Just as he had underesti-
mated the power of Capitalism to expand into monopoly and
Imperialism, so had he underestimated the mental, moral
and material power that the workers would have to use in
order to destroy Capitalism. Neither did he see the new
causes, of war.
He believed that Capitalism would break down
through an economic crisis, and be displaced bv the prole-
tariat. Indeed, capital in its spread over the world does
come up against poltical obstacles,* which it will only bo
able to overcome by curtailing its own power. This will
bring frightful sufferings to the workers, and these will lead
to the revolution —to the overthrow of Capitalism.
Everything is now at hand and in alphabetical order
that is necessary for the revolution. There are main- things
here which make the revolution feasible. Men and means —
material and spritunl power for its realisation, .and the
hunger need, the first and greatest —indeed, the one and
onlv maker of revolution —arc here.
Not in one country alone, but throughout the whole
world has suffering come through the war. Hunger creates
pain, revolt, and hate; pain on acount of loss and destruc-
tion, revolt against the Capitalist class, and hale against
Capitalism above all else.
‘"Really through economic causes, through over-production n
capital and the existence of rich countries with weak' populations to
which capital is exported, forcing colonial or imperial politics and so
dragging them into war.


The human and psychological factors that make for
revolution are here, and they will develop the longer the
war lasts.
The material moans are here because Capitalism has
centralised production, and the transport and distribution
of goods.
Miracle upon miracle. The material productive powers
introduced by Capitalism, during the war are no longer the
weapons with which Capitalism can reconstruct a Capitalist
State.
It is as though a god or wizard had touched them with
a magic wand, and transformed them from. Capitalist instru-
ments into proletarian instruments for an entirely different
state of society.
Capitalism, Imperialism, and the war have made the
necessary material and psychological conditions for
Socialism. They have done more—they have fleeced and
robbed each other, and the}' now confront the; proletariat
weaker than ever before; they can no longer govern. They
have placed weapons of war in the hands of the proletariat;
weapons which can be used to destroy Capitalism. The.
proletariat is armed.
One after another countries are being annexed,
oppressed, and robbed of their freedom. They can only
obtain a return of this freedom through the triumph of the
working class. These countries weaken Capitalism and
strengthen Socialism.
It has been shown during the war how quickly the
foundations of society can be changed, and if the most
reactionary power, Czardom, can be overthrown, that, more
than anything else, is a great moral example.
That example;—the Russian Revolution—stands before
the workers now. It has produced the first great proletarian,
revolutionary leaders.
It is now our task to examine, separately and closely,
these spiritual and material means in order that the inter-
national proletariat may see that the revolution is possible,
and may thus hasten it.
In speaking about the feasibility of the revolution, we
would remark that there is no difference between revolution
during} the war and after the war. So far as. it is possible


to judge by appearance, the revolution will come during- the
war; through defeat, through hunger, through the endless
bloodshed from which there is no escape.
In all countries the revolutionary proletariat must rise
against their own 'Governments, and demand and enforce
immediate peace. Secondly, they must have an international
understanding, and to have this they must establish a new
International.
If the representatives of the revolutionary workers in all
countries could meet together, and call a general strike in
the munition factories, and demand that the soldiers cease
fighting* against the external enemy —then, indeed, the
revolution would be an accomplished fact.
When we speak of the World Revolution, though we
mean all countries in the world, we have England and Ger-
many especially in mind, for there the material conditions
are most ripe for Socialism. In other countries thei revolu-
tion will break out and conquer; but it is certain if the
revolution in England and -Germany wins, the victory will
be made easier for the rest of the world.
And, thirdly, it should be said here that we do not
phophecy the duration of the revolution or its character; for
it is possible lhat the fight which Socialism will have to wage
against Capitalism, Militarism, and Imperialism, may last
for years. It is also possible that Socialism may win
speedily. The power of the contending classes is great, and
the incentive’ strong; but as to the duration of the fight we
will say nothing, simply calling the whole struggle the
revolution. As to the method of the revolution there is
nothing positive to say.
Karl Marx presumed it possible for the revolution to
take place without force in England. Who does not heartily
wish this, could be so every where ? Who would not hope
that an end could be put to all strife and suffering without
the spilling of a drop of blood? But in all countries, Eng-
land included, the opposing classes are armed, and a
forcible revolution seems inevitable everywhere*
* This was done in 1917 by the Zimmerwaldians in Stockholm.
if the English proletariat wished, and rose like one man
in revolt, it would at least be possible to establish the Revolution
without a long or bitter struggle.


We speak, then, of the revolution In a general sense,
including peaceable and forcible methods, nf long or short
duration, during or after the war.
Now, as to thci practicability of the revolution.
The Capitalist State, the better to conduct the war, was
forced to take over the control of the world production and
distribution —the coal mines, railways-, agriculture, shipping-,
banks, etc.
, It had the distribution of food supplies- and raw
materials in its hands.
This- was so in both belligerent and neutral nations.
That which people declared to be impossible, and which
the reformists - repudiated —one great mitral control of
wealth production and distribution in the Capitalist State—
is realised. It is with us.
Stern necessity has enforced in three years of war what
more than half-a-century of peace could not have accom-
plished—social control of labour.
Socialism rests on the social control of labour, of pro-
duction, of distribution. Therefore the foundations- for
Socialism arc laid. Capitalism in its highest development
has laid the foundation for Socialism —the central control
of world production and distribution.
The workers now find to their hands the means to
establish and build up Socialism. In proof of this there
stands clearly another fact. In all countries before th-e war
there were innumerable small businesses, each working
independently of the others; and many large establishments
did likewise.
During the war vast numbers of them, either voluntarily
or by State compulsion, amalgamated in trusts and com-
bines.
The proletariat must take control of thes-e now central-
ised means- of production. They must never allow industry,
trade, agriculture, transport, and the banks, to again re-vert
to the hands of Capitalist owners.
It must be said here that production and distribution
are questions of general economy, and they will remain so.
But during the war they have been taken under the control o-f
the State, although the instruments of production were not


the property of the State, these still belonging- to the private
owners —the Capitalists.
The State in the hands of the Capitalists is used as a
means of oppressing and exploiting the workers. If it
directs production and distribution in any way, then it does
so in the interests of Capitalists, and it is to them that the
profits will go. Its function is to rob the worker.
This must be altered. The proletariat of flic world, of
England and Germany in particular, must see to it that
private property and interests, whether vested in the Stale
or individuals, are overthrown.
But how can this be done if the Capitalists arc all-
powerful in the State; are, in fact, the State itself?'
There is no other way but to- conquer political power
and establish the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.
You must destroy the power of the old Stale, and in its
stead set up the new State-power of the workers. You must
change the dictatorship of the Capitalist States into that of
the proletariat.
That this is feasible we will show later on but we must
first recognise that the necessary material is here.
H aving- demonstrated that the material conditions are
here;, we have now to show that the proletariat must seize
political power, on personal, human, rind psychological
grounds.
Daring this war Capitalism has destroyed much of its
productive machinery. Millions of workers have been killed,
many more helplessly crippled, and widows and orphans
now form a large proportion of the population in all
countries.
Scarcely any goods are being- produced. There is a
shortage of raw material. Machinery stands idle or has
become useless. All industry is. diverted to war purposes..
The means of transport are in a wretched state; whole fleets,
of ships lie at the bottom of the sen. Fields are untilled or
badly cultivated, and are producing much less than formerly.
The supply of cattle is decreasing. The production of the
necessaries of life dwindles. Indeed, we are faced with a
world famine. Small business men are ruined by the
million, and farmers have lost everything. Nations arc


burdened with enormous debts, the interest on which
exceeds in some cases the total pre-war Incomes.
The State can repudiate these debts; but that would
ruin the Capitalists. It can endeavour to pay them; but then
they must bleed the peoples dry. In either case the w orkers
have a very poor outlook.
An economic and a financial crisis are approaching
together. General poverty will then como upon the whole
world.
The demobilised soldiers will be confronted with unem-
ployment. When there is no raw material, or factories
have been destroyed by war, where arc they to get work?
An, economic war will inevitably follow the war of
the military forces; but in no case will ihe raw materials be
available for industry, and high prices must be the order of
the day.
These terrible conditions will affect not only the work-
ing classes, but also the small tradesmen and farmers. And
along with these conditions wc shall have the new Imperial-
ism, the preparations for the new war, whose horrid spectre
I have already described.
The psychological and spiritual conditions favouring
revolution are not less than the palpable or material.
People say, however, that the general poverty, misery,
and scarcity of raw material, machinery, and capital, will be
an obstacle, not an aid, to Socialism.
They evidently think that Socialism can only be estab-
lished out of riches and abundance. This is a very mis-
leading argument, for out of this disorder, poverty, and
destruction, the Capitalist has to reconstruct and make
secure again its position. Capital and Labour are confronted
with the same material; and with so many elements advan-
tageous to revolution, and with the workers’ thoughts
always turning in this direction, the greater possibility is
on the side of Labour. If the destruction is no obstacle to
Capitalism, then it can be no obstacle to Socialism.
This, question, then, presents, itself; Who is best able
to establish a new society? The answer is that tho
proletariat can much better and more speedily establish
Socialism than can the Capitalists reconstruct the Capitalist
system.


How will Capitalism go to work in its task? How will
it deal with the difficulties? It has a new economic system
to set up. That means that it will simply revert to the: old
one and create; anew surplus wealth. It has to- produce 1 more
surplus wealth than ever in order to balance and exceed
its unproductive expenditure. At the same time it will have
huge armies to maintain, millions of unemployed to support,
a host of crippled and wounded from the war, together with
widows and orphans. It will have, in addition, an enormous
debt to pay, and the cost of new preparations for war to
meet.
The founding of a new economy; the restoration of the
old one; the making of new gains greater than their losses;
helping the crippled in the war; interest on National Debt
to pay; new armaments and military establishments to
maintain —all this Capitalism l has to face. And this is an
impossible feat for Capitalism. Why so? Because capital
helps capital and must save it. Because it cannot take from
itself the millions required for reconstruction, and thus
expropriate itself. Because production is for the few, not
for the many. Because it is not the duty of all men to
produce.
It cannot divest itself of its capital and wealth in order
to help the poor and workless. It cannot annul or repudiate
its debt or refuse to pay the interest. It cannot tax itself
to the extent now necessary. It cannot prevent preparations
lor war, and thus liberate the productive forces for useful
work.
It cannot even stop luxury and permit the labour thus
absorbed to l be diverted to l useful channels.
It cannot in this great crisis set its productive forces
going in a sufficiently active manner —just because it is itself.
It cannot establish itself on a new foundation —because it is
itself.
It follows from all this that Capitalism is in a quagmire
from which it cannot extricate itself. ft shows that the
destruction of its productive forces in the war has brought
it to a crisis out of which only a revolution can come, and
out of which crisis only a revolution can erect the necessary
productive power.
It is quite dear that Imperialism has put a shackle


around productive power from which it cannot free itself.
Only the revolution can do this.
Certainly Capitalism will struggle to survive. It will
attempt to gather from the ruins of war the materials for
building anew the Capitalist edifice.
It will be aided in its endeavours by the Reformists, the
Social Patriots, the false Marxists. An old form of society
docs not go under without a struggle.
By what method will it try to save itself?
Certainly by a method not pleasant for the proletariat—
the traditional, old-established way—by the vigorous ex-
ploitation, oppression, and enslavement of the proletariat;
by the extraction of abundant surplus wealth from their
labour. ,
Men like Scheidemann, Legien, Henderson, Vander-
velde, Thomas, Turati, Kautsky, will aid in this.
For Capitalism there is only one way —the way of
increased exploitation.
The new surplus wealth can have only one source —the
already over-burdened workers. 'They will be urged,indeed
forced, to toil harder than ever before*' They will be inade-
quately paid; the soldiers who remain in the armies, will be
also underpaid, and the unemployed will starve. All will
be heavily burdened with taxation.
By what means can the Capitalists enforce their will on
the workers? By the State.
The State will compel the workers, small tradesmen, the
crippled, widows and orphans, to live in misery and
poverty.
The State will maintain armed forces for the purpose of
keeping the workers in subjection —paying one section of
workers to browbeat the others.
It will regulate production in the interests of Capitalism.
It will retain conscription.
It will take industry under its protection —making the
proletariat State workers, industrial soldiers. It will turn
them into slaves of the companies, syndicates and trusts.
The State will he a house of correction. State Socialism
*l'or example, through the Taylor System, am] other speeding-up
methods camouflaged as “ welfare ” systems.


•will be introduced in the interests of Capitalism, in which
State Capitalism will be all-powerful, and the workers
reduced to complete slavery.*
The State will become the most relentless of exploiters;
the strike will be made impossible.
The Army will be used to enforce all this.
The same Army mobilised in 1914 to fight for Imperial-
ism and Capitalism, now' leavened with an introduction of
aristocratic and Capitalist elements, will be used to keep
the workers in subjection after the Avar.
During every economic. or political strike this Army will
be used, and the cannon and rifles, machine guns, aeroplanes
and bombs, manufactured by the Avorkers, Avill be turned on
them, in order to subdue them.
In short, the leaders of Capitalism will use the State and
the Army to sha-© Capitalism, and to obtain for themselves
an ever-increasing surplus Avealth, to be obtained only by
the most frightful forms of oppression.
But all these horrors Avill compel the dispossessed and
subject classes, the Avorkers, unemployed, demobilised
soldiers, etc., to rebel.
Since Capitalism has no other means of defence but the
State, then the fight aa“111 be against the State, this being the
embodiment of Capitalism itself. The fight against
Imperialism will have developed into a fight against Capital-
ism itself —a fight for the Social Revolution.
Can the proletariat accomplish Avhat Capitalism will fail
to do—build order out of chaos, give food and comfort to
millions of Avorkers? Can it at one and the same time save
humanity?
Most assuredly it can.
It can do this because many of the obstacles confronting
Capitalism Avill not be before the proletariat.
Ccrlainly.it Avill be a hard task to- build a new order from
such waste and ruin. It will be like taking over a bankrupt
business. Yet: the proletariat will do; it better and more
quickly than the- bourgeoisie, because it will not require to
haggle or negotiate to- please Capitalism.
*By State Socialism vve understand a system of society in -which
the State operates many businesses for the Capitalists, and protects the
Capitalists by laws and regulations against the workers.


In the first place, alt the wealth and means of produc-
tion to hand can be used for the benefit of all.
It would first assume control of industry, trade, trans-
port, banks and agriculture. These would be controlled and
regulated by a centralised authority a development much
advanced by Capitalism! itself. A vast amount of unnecessary
labour would thereby be saved and labour itself would be more;
equitably apportioned and unemployment thus avoided.
Kaisers, Kings, bankers, industrial magnates, junkers,
landlords, etc, —all on whose personal account special
groups of labour were ordered will disappear, and the labour
directed to productive channels.
The proletariat will not require to maintain an economic
war. It will be able to arrange, internationally, trade,
transport, and exchange, in a manner never possible to
Capitalism. Labour will be organised and centralised
internationally.
The proletariat will have no interest to pay, as it will
repudiate all national debts.
The proletariat will establish instead of Stale Capitalism,
■which only benefits the monopolists, real Socialism, which
is for the benefit of all. Owing to' the fact that production
and distribution will be regulated by the proletariat, only
really necessary goods will be produced; and the duty of
labour, which will be imposed upon all the able-bodied, will
result in a far greater production of all things needful.
The proletariat will thus be able to establish a new
Society better and more speedily than is possible by the
Capitalists.
We will not enumerate here the many other circum-
stances' which will enable the proletariat to achieve success.
The following, I anvever, will come by degrees: —
Education; the ban- sing and unification of productive
labour; the application of the highest technical knowledge;
to transport, industry, and agriculture;. These are a few of
the most important and necessary in the meantime.
We can now see that the material and physical condi-
tions, the spiritual needs and the material means; the possi-
bility and feasibility of the overthrow of Capitalism are here l .
Thq greatest incentive, the most encouraging fact for
the proletariat, is the knowledge that the whole future is


for the workers; that the workers alone can reconstruct
society.
In order to confiscate the wealth and means of produc-
tion, it will be necessary for the workers to capture political
power.
But people will say that the Russian Revolution has
partly failed; Germany has crushed it in many parts, and
that it is in danger of being entirely suppressed. Will not
the World Revolution also be, suppressed?
The answer to that is : The conditions of the Western
European Revolution, especially in Eng "and and Germany,
are entirely unlike, and cannot be compared with, those of
the Russian Revolution.
In the first place l the industrial workers in Russia were
very few in numbers compared iwith the whole population.
Russia is not a manufacturing country, but an agricultural
one.
The, Revolution could only be Avon bv the Bolsheviks
with the aid of the poor peasantry. This difficulty was the
greater for the Revolutionists, because they were at the
same time attacked from without.
England and Germany have a preponderance! of Indus-
trial workers. The Russian Revolution serves as an example
to Wesitern Europe. It is a symbol, a teacher, a forerunner.
It has shown the way. It has draAvn up a programme that
the proletariat of Western Europe must adopt as their own.
In the second place, we might say that the Revolutions
in the Ukraine and Finland Avcre only partly destroyed
because the Western European workers did not rise. If
they had risen, then the Social st Soviet Avould still be
standing there victorious.*
But, the Western workers, will revolt during or after
the war, and with the help of the Russian proletariat will
achieve complete! A-ictory. But it may be objected that real
revolutionaries amongst the Western proletariat are A - ery
few in number, and therefore will not be able to win.
Again, let us turn to Russia. The Maximalists there during
the war and before the Revolution were in. a minority.
*ln the fourth chapter we will deal more extensively with the
difference between the Russian and the Western European Revolutions.


Famine conditions converted them into a majority. The
same causes will operate to bring- about the. same result in
other countries.
It may be said that though the proletariat are more
numerous in Western Europe than any other single class,
yet they do not exceed in numbers all the other classes: put
together. In Germany the number of industrial workers is
estimated at 15 millions. In England their number, in
proportion to the population, is. much greater. To this must
be added the farm labourers, who will throw in their lot
with the revolutionary proletariat, as we shall show. Their
organisations, both political and industrial, are powerful.
In England they number five millions. In Germany between
three millions and four millions are organised. In other
countries like conditions prevail. In all of them a large
number of the population will act with and support the
revolutionaries in the coming struggle. They need only to
be exposed to the rays of,the sun of revolution to have their
latent strength quickened and made manifest in all its
grandeur.
The fight is now between “big business” and the
proletariat. The issue is, who shall receive the surplus
wealth, the Capitalists or the workers? Either the Capi-
talists: will continue to appropriate it by the oppression of
State Socialism, or the proletariat will take it by setting up-
real Socialism.
How the struggle will end depends largely upon what
attitude Is taken by the middle class, especially the lower
middle class; which in England and Germany is the most
numerous.
The Capitalists will be forced to tax themselves. But
the debts and requirements of the States are so great that
in order to provide for these, and! maintain and increase
their power, they will be compelled to oppress all other
classes, including the middle class. In addition to exploit-
ing the working class, they will lay the heaviest possible
burdens- upon the middle class, shopkeepers and farmers.
They will keep down the salaries of their officials and em-
ployees. All this, combined with famine, scarcity of raw
materials, andi of work, and high prices will drive the
middle class to the side of the workers*.


That part of surplus wealth that went to the middle class
was always small. After the war and under Imperialism
it will bo smaller still. To this class, or at least to. the lower
pottion of it, a Socialist society offers more than the Capi-
talist State. Real Socialism would be better for them than
State Socialism.
The patient, persistent propaganda of the last thirty
years has done its work. Millions in Western Europe now
know what Socialism means. They will realise ere long
that now is the time to decide. There is only one choice
possible: Imperialistic Capitalism or Socialism. The question
to be decided is : Which shall be: dictator of the worlds—
Capital or Labour, Imperialism or Socialism?
The terrible plight into which Imperialism has brought
the world has made possible the international unity of the
workers, and the adhesion to their ranks of the lower middle
classes.
And so' there rises before us the possibility of almost
immediately realising Socialism. Shall the workers conquer
the world? Shall they unite humanity in one great whole?
Shall the human race be freed once and for all from, the
shackles of Capitalism and Imperialism? It depends, upon
the workers themselves—upon whether they are sufficiently
brave, sufficiently educated, and sufficiently united.
There is one danger to be guarded against —the danger
of disunity. The Imperialists of the victorious belligerent
group will unite with those of the defeated nations, and with
the reformists and social-patriots, against the proletariat.
There will thus be formed one front: on one side the
Capitalist classes, reformists and chauvinists; on the other
the revolutionaries. If a national proletariat prefers, one
Imperialism to another; if it allows itself to be bribed by
its national rulers, or to. be deceived by treacherous Labour
leaders; if it accepts the State Socialism of its national
Capitalists; if the international proletariat remains divided,
one section betraying and deserting the others; if one part
after another is allowed to be smashed by international
Imperialism —then the success of the Revolution will be
impossible, and we shall have to endure a new era of
Capitalism, Imperialism, and Militarism.
But even if defeated at the first attempt, international


unity, even if it takes years to accomplish, must be estab-
lished 1 . It should, in any case, be the result of this first
world war.
In the beginning- of the great struggle for Socialism,
the proletariat of each country will, of course, fight against
its own national Capitalism:; but as the struggle progresses,
the necessary international unity will be established. There
will be set up an International like a Trade Union or a
federation of Trade Unions, in which the members will be
pledged to> support and defend one another. As in a Trade
Union when a member acts as a blackleg, or as la a feder-
ation when one of the affiliated bodies fails to strike in
sympathy with the others, so in the new International, when
the proletariat of a nation does not play its. part in the
emancipation of humanity, it will be considered a national
scab.
We shall now endeavour to sketch the programme
which such an Iternatlonal should endeavour to carry out.
International Programme of the Revolutionaries.

Explanation of Programme.
The first item gives the proletariat the means to destroy
the old Capitalist State by destroying its instruments of
power—bureaucracy, police, and army.
The second gives it the power to lay the foundations of,
and build up, the new society. These means and powers
must be given only to the proletariat, because it is the
only class that is capable of realising Socialism. But, of
course, it may allow other sections of the population to
share in, these privileges, if it considers them true to the
Revolution.
The third assures to the workers a sound basis of
existence through the equitable allocation of food, housing,
etc. This must also be guaranteed to the small shopkeepers,
poor farmers, disabled soldiers and sailors, .widows, and
orphans, and all who have not sufficient means of subsist-
ence. In short, help immediately, and complete liberation
in the future, should be promised to all who are oppressed.
The fourth point, together with the fifth—work for all—
is the only means whereby a Socialist society can be con-
structed from the ruins, of the old one.
Clauses 6 to 9 provide the means for carrying out the
third, and so consolidating the foundations of the new order.
It will be understood, of course, that in taxing capital
and income., a minimum will be fixed, below which no tax
will be imposed.
The tenth point —confiscation of large businesses—
covers iron and steel works, coal mines, foreign trade,
railways, shipping, etc.
It is not contrary to the fourth point; for in that it is
control and regulation of all production that is insisted upon.
The confiscation of small businesses cannot be carried out
right away on account of their great number.
So far as agriculture is concerned, the land will be
confiscated and the principle of common ownership estab-
lished; but in the case of the smaller holders this can only
be done,, by degrees. At first only the large agricultural
concerns ought to be taken over and worked bv the com-
munity itself, or co-operatively by the small farmers and
the labourers.
The Hoe dividing great and small concerns would be


different in different countries, provinces, and businesses.
There will be, in each case, different means and methods of
confiscation.
The wealthy landowner and the rich farmer can be
dealt with by taxation. The moderately wealthy farmer
will be hit sufficiently by the confiscation of the land banks.
The community, and not a landlord, will receive rent from
the farmer.
There is nothing- in these proposals that cannot be
carried out. On the other hand, if mooted and not carried
into execution, they would drive the farming class into
counter-revolution. By these measures, in conjunction with
the third point of the programme 1 , the small farmers and
farm labourers can be won over to the Revolution, and the
middle class farmers can be induced to become, if not
friends, at least not enemies.
The agricultural question is one of great difficulty.
The measures indicated above, coupled with the develop-
ment of productive power, provide the only possible settle-
ment.
The twelfth point —the vesting of judicial authority in
the proletariat —gives to that class alone the power in the
Socialist Republic by which it can defend the new society
from attack.
The last paragraph but one —the abolition of all tolls
and tariffs—has for its object the removal of one of the
greatest causes of enmity between peoples, and of one of
the most serious obstacles to the international regulation of
production and distribution.
The last demand Is. the crowning part of the programme.
It overthrows Capitalistic militarism, and puts an end to
Capitalistic wars. The second part of it—the arming of the
proletariat—puts, into the hands of the workers the means
whereby the.v can defend the Revolution, from enemies both
within and without, and establish the dictatorship of the
proletariat.
It is absolutely necessary that revolutionary international
Social Democrats should get their programme ready as
soon as possible —in fact, at once ! If the revolution does
not take place in the principal countries at the same time
and with the same intention; if a succession of unorganised


revolts takes place—failure will be the inevitable result, -awl
the revolution will be smothered in blood. ,
' The example of the Russian Maximalists shows us
clearly the advantages a clear-cut and well-defined pro-
gramme gives when it is ready and published beforehand.
It shows also what happens when the people of other nations
do not revolt at the same time and with the same programme.
The programme should be a revolutionary one, but
should l contain only those demands which the Revolution can
make possible of fulfilment. It ought to be as simple as
possible, so that every worker may understand what the
Revolution aims at. It should be of such a nature that all
Socialists can endorse it. Therefore it should not contain
any legislative details which might cause conflict between
nations with different lines of development.
Lastly, it is essential that it should unite only real
revolutionaries. It should, by its provisions, debar all who
are not prepared to fight for the Revolution.
The programme outlined above would- ensure all that.
There is still one other remark to make; which, is of
the greatest importance to the workers. They would do
well to- remember that after the war the strike^ —even the
general strike —cannot win them everything; because there
will be shortage of capital, shortage of raw material and
of machinery, and little demand for labour.
As soon as the workers are disarmed, the ruling classes
will begin to bind and gag them. This, coupled with
unemployment and hunger, and the sufferings that follow-
in their train, may goad the people into revolt. In such
an event the ruling classes will have, under arms and ready
for action, troops selected from the anti-revolutionary
sections of the population, and the proletariat will be
dragooned into submission.
If, on the other hand, the proletariat, before demobil-
isation takes place, puts forward these proposals, or a similar
general programme, the ruling caste, fearing the power of
the workers and the other classes which would support
them, will give way, and their demands will bei conceded
without bloodshed.
Therefore we insist on the necessity for getting the:


programme ready immediately. The one sketched above
is offered merely as an example. It would be well if the
revolutionaries of all countries would set about thei work
at once.
The necessity and the possibility of the Revolution in
West Europe! —which is a condition of the World Revolu-
tion—can be clearly seen. A proletariat strong in its organ-
isations and great in its numbers is here. A society ripe for
Socialism, which has already taken its first step into State
Socialism, is here. And the way to the new spciety, now at
last visible to the workers, lies through a revolutionary
programme.
Has the proletariat the physical and moral strength to
overthrow Capitalism in all countries and to conquer
Imperialism ?
It will have the power when it is united.
Will the workers be able to achieve unity?
In order that they may benefit by the example of the
Russian proletariat in its struggle for unity and victory, we
shall deal in the next chanter with the Russian Revolution.


CHAPTER IV.
THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION.
The Russian Revolution is, for thei European and Ameri-
can workers, who have it still before them, a splendid: and
clear example. This example is itself the result of the
development of Imperialism, from which the West European
workers can learn how they have to act, how they can
attain unity and win the victory.'
We will deal with the Russian Revolution in order that
the proletariat may see how far it can follow the same path,
and where it: must take its own course^.*
The Russian industrial proletariat is very small in
proportion to the whole population of the gigantic Empire.
The great mass of the Russian population are peasants,
and among these! a very great number are small farmers or
farm labourers. The poor peasantry form the majority of
the peasant population.
The old Czarism was supported by the great land-
owners, a powerful body in Russia, and also by the capital
of the big industries, which was, however, a weak prop
when one considers the extent of the Empire. Czarism
found if could not bear the: burden of the great war; and
when it: became apparent that the industries and transport
were not equal to the task, they were called upon to perform
and famine ensued, it was overthrown by the combined
efforts of the upper and lower bourgeoisie, the middle class
peasants, the poor peasants, and the proletariat. These
classes then attempted, with Russia as a bourgeois republic,
tO‘ carry on the war.
The peasants’ party, the Social-Revolutionists, the
reformists and the social-patriots (Mensheviks), all worked
hand in hand.
The: small party of real revolutionaries (the Bolsheviks)
opposed them. It was led by the man who had always
*The Russian Revolution is the first revolution to be undertaken
by Marxists, and in accordance with the Marxican theory. The
teaching's of the Anarchist, the syndicalist, the Reformist, and the
pseudo-Marxist (e.g., Kautsky), were proved in the Revolution to he
useless.


firm for revolution—the revolution for Socialism as
against any momentary success; and has thereby proved
himself to be the ablest politician the world-proletariat has
had since Marx. This man was Lenin.
As the Russian proletariat is the advance guard of the
world-proletariat, so Iwnin is the champion of this advance
guard.
Only later generations who will know all his words
and deeds, and who will b© free from passion and prejudices
will be able to compare him with his contemporaries, and
pass true judgment upon him. But lam convinced that he
surpasses all other leaders of the proletariat, and that he
alone deserves to be placed, side by side with Marx. If
Marx surpasses him in theoretical knowledge and dialectic
acuteness, he towers above Marx by his deeds.
His tactics, before, during, and' after the Revolution,
are far beyond anything that the proletariat had previously
accomplished in the sphere of politics.
And we are drawn towards him as we were towards
Marx. And the mind and the soul of the man inspire us with
affection. His simplicity, his sincerity, his courage, the
truth of his very are the causes of our affection.
He is the leader of the Russian Revolution. May he be the
leader of the World Revolution !
The Bolsheviks said that the workers- of Russia should
not start the bourgeois revolution with the bourgeoisie, the
landed proprietors and the rich farmers, but should begin
a proletarian revolution with the help of the poor peasantry.
They drew up a programme for the social revolution,
of which the chief points were: All power to the workers,
the land for the poor peasants, and peace.
The Capitalists, the landed proprietors, the rich
peasants, and the reformists, carried on the war till Russia
■was again nearing the abyss. None of the demands of the
workers- and poor peasants- was conceded.
Then the poor peasantry and the whole of the prole-
tariat drifted away from the reformists and social-patriots
and became united under the Bolshevik banner. The.
Bolsheviks- were able to- overthrow the- Government and to
seize political power. And they used this power to lay the
foundation for Socialism.


The same thing will have to be done by the Western
European and American workers.
They must either immediately overthrow their Capi-
talistic Government, whether it be monarchy or democracy;
or they must first deal -with the bourgeois Government and
then with the Government made up of elements taken from
the bourgeoisie and social-patriotic and reformist groups.
The Russian revolutionaries—the workers and the small
farmers—captured political power. And they took that
power solely for their own ends.
They gave the right to vote and the right to be elected
only to proletarians and poor peasants.
They divided Russia into districts, whose 1 Workers’
Councils (Soviets) elected the District Workers’ Councils.
These District Workers’ Councils elected the Central Council
of the Empire, and the congress of the Councils elected the
Executive Committee.
All members of the Local, District, and Central Councils,
and also' all officials and employees, are elected for a short
period only, and are always liable to be called to account for
their actions.*
As in general all officials have a low salary, and as all
the. Councils have to meet regularly and often, there will be
formed a flexible body as the first Socialist Government in
the world.
The light of the new world radiates from these Councils.
The working class of the world has found in these
Workers’ Councils its organisation and its centralisation, its
fdt)m and its expression, for the revolution and for the
Socialist society.
What Marx had foretold —that the working class could
not simply take over the Government machinery of the
Capitalistic State, but that it must find its own forms—has
actually come to pass. The organisation and the centralisa-
tion, the form and the expression of the proletarian revolu-
tion, the foundation of the Socialist society, are here.
The Russian revolutionaries! in these Institutions have
given an example to the workers of the world.
*This is to prevent the formation of a new bureaucracy, or a new
independent power, being raised above the workers.


With this example before its eyes the world-proletariat
can now make the world revolution.
The world-proletariat must erect "Workers’ Councils' —
councils of the locality, of the provinces or districts, of the
empires or nations, as a means to- the revolution, and as the
new form of its society. These Councils alone shall have
power.
Workers'’ Councils of the nations, of the peoples, in
place of Capitalistic Governments : that is the form of the
revolution and of the new society which the workers must
everywhere create;.
■ The Russian revolutionaries gave power only to the
workers, and to the poor peasants who are on a par with the
workers.
They gave the land to the poor peasants.
They made peace whilst Capitalists and Capitalism
slaughtered humanity and destroyed the earth.
They took over all the great industries, the banks, and
the means of transport.
They repudiated the National Debt.
They confiscated all property.
They introduced compulsory labour.
For the first time since modern Capitalism came into
being, the worker, the producer of capital, became its. owner.
The working class came into possession of its products:
the means of production. The whole capital came into the
hands of those who produced it, and who were its sole
legitimate owners. It left the hands of those who expro-
priated it, and went back into the hands of the real owners,
the people who created it.
The Russian revolutionaries introduced a uniform
standard of education with free instruction for everyone.
They threw open to everyone all the higher educational
institutions.
They introduced control of the factories and workshops
by the workers.
They brought the industries under the control of the
community of workers.
They began to exploit the great industries as communal
industries.


They allowed co-opeirative societies of poor peasants to
exploit the large estates*
They made a start with systematic barter, a systematic
transport, and a systematic production.
They began to make the whole social progress of pro-
duction into a great systematic entity. They did the same
with distribution.
Throughout the whole of Russia, communistic industries
are now springing up.
All banking institutions are in the possession of the
Soviets.
A number of industrial and transport undertakings are
in the possession of, and are controlled by, the Socialist
community.
A number of agricultural industries are run for the
Socialist community through Socialist and Communist,
peasants, among whom the land has been apportioned.
A beginning has been made with Socialist exchange and
Socialist trade. In short, the Socialist society has been
founded.
And is it possible that what the Russian workers can
do and have done, cannot be done by the English and l Ger-
man workers ?
The latter will be able to do it much better.
They will be better able to take over the banks, and the
means of production and distribution.
They will be better able to establish the Socialist society.
And then will follow suit the proletariat of all Europe and
North America —of the whole world. In their case the
great industries are far more powerful and more numerous.
Besides, they have the organisation which will enable them
to take over the means of life.
They have the power, the experience.
They have the intellectual strength.
They have a net of unions, in- all branches of industry,
oyer the whole land.
The Workers’ Unions in Russia rejoice over the begin-
ning of Socialism, over Socialist work, which is not done for
private Capitalism and masters, but for the community and
for equals.
The intellectuals* who in the beginning with the possess


ing classes resorted to sabotage, have now in great numbers
taken up Socialist work.
Socialist labour conditions are developing - . Of course
it is with difficulty, but they are developing - .
And with and through these conditions the Socialist
mind, the Socialist spirit, has come. The Communist char-
acter has. appeared. Through Socialist work the Communist
emotion is engendered : Communist joy, Communist desire,
Communist happiness, the Communist heart.
There is no longer any doubt that in a short time the
spiritual expression, the new and higher knowledge, and
the new and higher art, will burst forth out of this bud, out
of this first beginning of the Commune.
Contrary to' expectations a Socialist society was born
from the blood of the Russian workers, and it now stands
before us like a beautiful flower.
Through the struggles of the Russian workers and poor
peasants there appears for the proletariat, and indeed for all
exploited people, the dawn of a new era.
The Bolsheviks are holding aloft a torch which illum-
inates the whole of nature and society. They give to the
world-proletariat, in advance, in their own methods and
deeds, a picture of those that must be adopted and emulated
in order to attain success.
Thei unexpected has happened. In the infinite riches
of nature and society there lay something whose existence
was undreamt of. Neither England nor 'Germany made the
beginning in Socialism. That honour belongs to Russia.
Through a remarkable combination of circumstances, and
conditions the opportunity came' to set up Communism; and
there it stands to-day.
Communist society should soon spread over the whole
of Russia. In the hands of the workers it should' soon grow
to perfection. If not, then Socialism is only possible inter-
nationally.
The Bolsheviks realise that, and have therefore done
everything in their power to set in motion the proletariat of
all other lands in the direction of Socialism. They know
that their own revolution runs the greatest danger of being
defeated; and still the revolution in Europe and North
America hangs fire. The different economic and political


conditions in those parts of the world delay the advent of
the world revolution.
But that: does not prevent the Bolsheviks, from carrying
on their glorious work. They realise that the triumph of
the revolution in Russia would act as. a guiding star to. the
proletariat of the ,world. They realise that it is necessary
to set an example to 1 the workers of other countries. They
are determined to hold fast to. Socialism in spite of all
opposition. The workers of the world would be compelled
to recognise that Socialism, had come out of the great war
that had apparently destroyed it.
When Germany made peace with the Bolsheviks, it was
a peace in appearance only. In, reality it was intended to
destroy them. Just as the Bolsheviks expected, the Ger-
mans stole the Ukraine, the granary of Russia where the
Soviets were in power. They took Poland, Lithuania,
Livonia, Esthonia, Finland, and the Caucasus, and made
preparations, to- annex other parts of Russia.
The Bolsheviks, submitted to this in order to save the
Socialist society. They withdrew into the interior of the
country, and did all they could to develop and extend the
new form of society. They knew that only in this, way could
they keep in touch with, and remain united to, the German
and English-American proletariat. Their sacrifice of a part
of their country so that they might continue, the struggle
against Imperialism and maintain their solidarity with the
workers of other lands, was the first example of international
unity amongst the workers.
History does not furnish a greater or more sublime
act than this—great in its comprehensiveness, sublime in its
meaning, for the workers and for the whole of humanity.
The arrival of Socialism has been proclaimed by a
herald worthy of its, name.
There is no reason why the revolution could not have
succeeded, or why the Socialist society could not have been
gradually built up, if there had been no intervention by
other nations, although the establishment of Socialism in a
country that is mainly agricultural is contrary to orthodox
Socialist' science. The orthodox view is that only in a
highly-developed industrial country is it possible to achieve
Socialism. But the developments of nature and of society


are not all comprehended by science. They are always
bringing to light something new. In Russia there Mere
exceptional classes and class conditions. There was a fairly
numerous, very revolutionary proletariat, a large number
of whom, are, like the peasants, in great poverty. These
classes were stronger than all the others. There was a
degenerate class of bureaucrats and landowners, and a weak
Capitalist class. Why, then, could' not the first two classes
together establish a Socialist society? Why could they not
Socialise by degrees, banks, industry, trade, etc.? They
had the power. They were armed. Under these conditions
who could prevent them?
They would encounter, of course, great opposition from
the possessing classes, the richer farmers, the nobles, the
Capitalists, and a part of the middle class —even from some
of the poor peasants themselves who- still cling to individ-
ualist ideas. But these difficulties are not insurmountable.
Time and patience only are required.
The attempt will, at all events, be made.
In order -to give them a fair chance of success it is
necessary that no outside power should attack them, and
rob them of their food, and assist and strengthen the counter-
revolution.
Workers of the world! It was, is, and will be,
impossible to maintain Socialism in any country if it is
attacked by all other countries. It must be set up in
several —in all of the advanced countries, at least—at the
same time.
That is- the first -lesson we are taught by the Russian
Revolution.
Now the great drama proceeds. Germany tears the
body of Russia to pieces, and by cutting off the Ukraine
causes- hunger and scarcity. Prices- rise. The speculation
in foodstuffs assumes, gigantic dimensions. Some of the
farmers, dissatisfied with the prices- for their produce fixed
by the community, desert the workers. Hunger and want
bring the work of reform to- a standstill —especially the
division of the land and the communisation of agriculture.
Some of the farmers and the- Social Revolutionaries- break
away from the Bolsheviks and trv to persuade Russia to
re-enter the war against Germany that has caused so much


misery, and by that means overthrow the Revolution. At
the same time England, France, Japan, and the United
States force their way into Russia and endeavour to seize
large slices, of territory in Siberia and on the Murman
coast. They supply the counter-revolutionaries, with arms
and money, and assist them in any other way they can. On
all sides, enemies of the Revolution raise .their heads, but
they have no. chance of winning except by foreign assistance.
Attacked on ail sides by the minions of Capitalism, the
kernel of the Socialist Brotherhood struggles for existence—
endeavouring to> develop, or at least to live, and awaits the
European Revolution. But, as already stated, the Ameri-
can, the world revolution, is not coming to its. assistance;
and meanwhile the Russian Revolution itself stands in the
greatest danger. The world revolution will come, but later,
owing to different historical, economic and political condi-
tions that exist in other parts of the world.
We shall now indicate what these conditions are, so
that the proletariat may see why the world revolution can
come: only after the Russian Revolution.
The first great difference between the Russian and West
European Revolutions is this. The Russian revolutionaries
could only, carry through the Revolution with the help of the
peasants. The peasants, themselves were revolutionary.
Without their help the! workers could have done but little,
even with the most reckless courage. In Russia there were
a great number of large estates. These belonged to the
Royal Family, the State, the nobles, and the Church. These
estates could be divided. The peasant wanted the land.
The revolutionary workers wanted them to have it. The
peasants therefore joined forces with the workers.
Herein lies the great difference between Russia and
Western Europe. In the West, even in England and Ger-
many, there are not many propertileiss farmers or peasants;
and except in a few countries, and districts there are not
many large estates. On the contrary, in many European
countries. —Germany, France, Scandinavia, Holland, Bel-
gium.—middle-sized and small estates are the general rule.
The workers in Western Europe must: make the Revolution
without the peasants, or in comparison, with Russia, with
only a small number. There the proletariat hsd strong


Support; here they stand alone. That is the first reason why
thei Revolution here will come later.
The second reason is : The Government and the bureau-
cracy were weak; in, Europe, and especially in England and
•Germany, they are very strong. In Russia the organisation
of Capitalism was very defective; here (especially again in
England and Germany) .Capitalism is splendidly organised.
In Russia the opponents' of the revolutionaries were weak;
those of the West European revolutionaries are strong.
The Russian proletariat stood with a strong auxiliary behind
them and a weak Capitalism in front. In the West the
proletariat stand alone in opposition to a powerful Capitalism.
The w-'orkers in Western Europe are, in comparison with
the rest of the population, more numerous than in Russia,
but not so numerous as workers and peasants combined.
In the West the workers have a firm foundation on
which to build Socialism. Firstly, the banking system, the
principal branches of industry, transport and trade, were,
even before the war, ripe for socialisation. Secondly,
Imperialism has during the war centralised production and
distribution. This organisation is technically powerful and
can bei taken over by the proletariat as a basis on which
to rear the Socialist society. In Russia these organisations
either do not exist or are very imperfect.
In Russia society was technically unripe for Socialism
before the war, and its organisation has been greatly
weakened during the period of the war. In Western
Europe society was ripe for the change before the war; and
during the war its organisation and centralisation have been
greatly strengthened.
In Russia a small proletariat, helped by a great revolu-
tionary peasantry, stand before the task of building up a
new society with limited economic means at their disposal.
The proletariat of Western Europe stand before their task
alone, but they are powerful and well organised, and possess
great economic resources'.
The Russian proletariat, small in numbers but assisted
by the peasantry, struggle with slender means, against weak
opponents. The workers of Western Europe great in
numbers, but quite alone, fight with great resources against
powerful opponents. The organisation of the Western


workers has been thrown into confusion during- the war
through the separation of its members. The organisation
of capital, and especially of the Governments, has been
greatly strengthened in the same period Through these
causes, the Revolution will come later, and will b© more
difficult in Western Europe than in Russia. It will be
entirely diiferent from the Russian Revolution.
The peasants of the West are not revolutionary as
those of Russia are. This is true of the great majority of
the small farmers and of the shopkeepers, as. well.
Although the proletarians, stand alone now, if they adopt
the right tactics they will not stand alone when the crisis
comes. Because the material foundations of Socialism are
here they can reckon on the help of others in the Revolution.
With the right tactics and the right programme they wall
attract millions, of adherents. A real proletarian programme
aiming- at the establishment of complete Socialism will make
adherents and allies of all the lower working classes, the
small business people, the lesser Government officials, and
employees, and the small farmers.
Although these classes are not revolutionary of them-
selves they will certainly ally themselves, with the proletariat,
for they have been hard hit by the war and oppressed by
Imperialism. The small Capitalists have long been hesitat-
ing between the Capitalist and Socialist parties. Up to the
present the greater number of them have adhered to the
Capitalist parties. But as a result of the war they can be
won over to Socialism if the right policy is pursued. The
proletariat will then have a majority.
The war has pressed so. heavily upon these classes that
if they can only be made to realise that their only choice is
between Imperialism and Socialism, they w-ill choose the
latter. When the alternative is presented to them of being
despoiled by Capitalist Imperialism through high prices,
taxes and war, or being saved by Socialism, they will plump
for Socialism.
Let the proletariat say to all the working classes:
Imperialism and war destroy you. We assure you an
existence whether you have work toi do or not. You shall not
lack the necessaries, of life.
Let them say to the small Capitalists, and Government


minor officials and employees : Imperialism breaks you by its
wars, its taxes, low wages, hunger and poverty.' Socialism,
which will take all wealth and all big businesses and put
them in the hands of the community; which will centralise
production and distribution over the whole world—offers to
you low taxes, and later no taxes at all. It assures you
regular work and an honourable position. It gives you, in
common with all other citizens, peace, happiness, and
comfort.
To- the small shopkeepers let them say : Remain in your
places. You shall have wares to sell. We have all the
large businesses- in our hands. We will supply you with
wares and raw material. By degrees your businesses will
become part of our system, and you will ultimately, like all
other citizens, be employed in the production or distribution
of goods for the community.
To the small farmers and to- a part of the well-to-do
farmers let the proletariat say: Imperialism and Capitalism
break you through war, taxes, and high rents. They take
away your sons. They deprive you of your cattle. They
will continue to do after the war. The Socialist society, on
the other hand, .will allow you to carry on your work in
peace. It will relieve you, wholly or partly, from taxes. It
will free you from your landlords, and in many other ways
reduce ycur burdens. As for the large estates, it will
apportion them amongst you to be worked on a Communistic
basis for the benefit of the whole community. As soon as
the development of productive forces makes it feasible, it
will convert all your businesses into a co-operative Com-
munist concern, in which all workers will be equally g r reat
and powerful in, a free society of workers.
And finally, to all these classes let the proletariat say :
We can do all this- if you help us. In that event we shall
have in our hands control of all the great industries, of
wealth production and distribution. We shall have all, the
capital and all the riches of society at our command.
There can be no> doubt that those classes who are so
much oppressed by Imperialism will accept this offer. The
increasing pressure to- which they are being subjected will
make them range themselves on the side of the proletariat.


In England, if it is set about In the right way, it can quite
easily be done.
Here is seen again the great difference between Russia
and Western Europe. In the former the proletariat could
not make such an offer, because Russia was weak in pro-
ductive forces and poor in capital. In the latter there are
enormous masses of capital and gigantic productive power,
and a complete organisation of both. With such conditions
it is easy to> supplant Imperialistic Capitalism with its
inevitable results, death and destruction, by Socialism, and
in consequence, comfort, equality, and peace. The intelli-
gent members of the “ lower ” classes, who have no direct
interest in Capitalism, will be won over to the side of the
revolutionaries.
We may well take a lesson in this matter from the
Bolsheviks. How did they obtain the help of the peasants?
They put forward a programme which demanded “ All
power to the workers, “ the land for the peasants,” and
“Peace.”
No other party had a like programme. The Social-
Revolutionaries (in their first phase) and the Mensheviks
(the reformers) betrayed the people and the peasants by
alliances with the landowners and Capitalists.
If the Western proletariat make any compromise with
the Capitalists, or ally themselves with them in any way,
they will receive no' support from the shopkeepers, Govern-
ment officials or employees. These people are too intelligent
not to see that in that case the proletariat would bo power-
less to free them from, Imperialism.
There is no middle course. The toilers must doi as they
did in Russia —demand all power to 1 the workers, confiscate
all wealth and industries, concentrate production and distri-
bution in their own hands. They must, in short, establish
Socialism.
The Russian Revolution teaches us another lesson. The
Bolsheviks won not only by the help of the poor peasants,
but also, in the first instance, bv the absolute unitv of all
the working class. If they had not had that unity they
could not have induced the other classes to ioin them.
The working classes in Western Europe are threatened
with a great danger —a danger which has grown greater


during - the last twenty-five years. It comes from the
reformists, and social-patriots. Just as they held the prole-
tariat back from revolution, and effected an alliance with
the bourgeoisie and brought them into the war, so they will
endeavour with the help of the l bourgeoisie to bring the
proletariat of the world into State Socialism.
The Capitalists, in order to- escape the danger of bank-
ruptcy through disorganisation of production and National
Debts, will be forced after the war to nationalise many
undertakings, or to put them under State control. They will
then take away the right to strike, reduce wages, increase
he -working hours, and speed up work to the highest possible
pitch. In short, the workers- will be State slaves.
The programme of the German, English, Italian, and
French reformists, shows quite clearly that they will assist
the Capitalists to do this. Their assistance will be given
on condition that one part of the workers—the members of
the great Trade Unions —get advantages over, and prefer-
ences- greater than, the others —such as higher wages, better
conditions- of labour, etc.
The Capitalists would willingly buy at this price the
social-patriots and a part of the proletariat.
In England the danger is threatened by the Labour
Party and the Trade Unions; in Germany by the Majority
and the Independents, the Trade Unions and the Social-
Democrats; in France by the- Majority and Centre Parties
and the workers’ syndicates; and in America by the Trade-
Unions. Everywhere the danger appears.
If this plot succeeds, the division of the workers will
be effected. Some will go over to- Imperialism; others will
declare, for the- Revolution.. Then will the Revolution be
lost, for the working class 'will be powerless. It will be
impotent in itself, and will receive no support from other
sections- of the population—shop-keepers, small farmers, etc.
It will be at the mercy of Imperialism.
Only when the proletariat is absolutely united, and no
section of it agrees to State Socialism, will it have the power
to win. \
We repeat again, the perfect unity of the- proletariat
is- the second lesson of the Russian Revolution.


There is still another lesson the Russian example l affords
to the Western proletariat. Thja Russian workers are partly
defeated already because the German, English, and American
proletariat did not make a revolution at the same time.
The Russian revolutionaries are in constant danger of
defeat. If they are finally crushed we know the reason why.
Attacked by all the powers of Capitalism, by all the
forces of the 1 world, the Russian proletariat will hold fast
to. the Revolution to the last, and dying will give another
and greater example to the proletariat of the world.
Holding fast to the World Revolution, suffering for it,
dying for it: this is internationalism, indeed. This solidarity
of the workers of Russia with the workers of the world :
this is the last and greatest lesson the Russian Revolution
teaches to the world proletariat.
In the middle of the: Capitalist orgy of blood appeared
the unitv of the proletariat. In the midst of the world war
appeared the kernel of a new humanity.
The Russian Revolution, through its decision, its fore-
sight and its courage, through its form of organisation (the
Soviets) and through its deeds (through its deeds more than
anything else), its overthrow of Czardom and Capitalism;
the confiscation of capital, the initiation of the organisation
of Socialism, its union of the poor peasants with the other
workers, its fidelity to international unity —is a splendid
example to Western Europe, to America, and the whole
world.
There can be no doubt that the workers of the world,
with this brilliant example before them, will begin at once
to unite.
The struggle to establish Socialism all over the world
will then begin in earnest.


CHAPTER V.
SUMMING UP.
I«
The World Revolution is necessary.
The Imperialisms of all nations are alike inimical to the
workers.
Therefore the international proletariat must unite and
destroy World Revolution.
But Imperialism cannot be destroyed unless Capitalism
is destroyed.
Therefore the Revolution for the destruction of
Capitalism and the establishment of Socialism is necessary
now.
11.
There is no l way out of Imperialism l for Capitalism.
There is no salvation for the proletariat through
Imperialism.
Imperialist Capitalism has divided the nations of the
world into two groups to fight for the mastery of the earth.
Three powerful nations; —Germany, England, and the
United States;—have the leadership of these two* groups.
There is no; hope of a peaceful settlement of this
struggle, for all three nations, and all the countries allied
with them, want world power for one of themselves, or for
the group to which they belong.
There is no means of deciding the issue but war.
The bourgeoisie, the reformists, and the social-patriots
seek a settlement, but their solutions have no l real value,
and serve only to blind the workers and keep them in sub-
jection. A Court of Compulsory Arbitration, a League of
Nations, Disarmament, the Right of Self-Determination for
all nationalities, Democracy—neither these nor any of the
other petty little proposals put forward by these groups
can extricate Capitalism from the contradictions into 1 which
it has fallen. From the mass of surplus wealth which it
heaps up; from the desire for expansion which is the
result of this accumulation; from the conquest of foreign
markets which it must make; from the wars that must
result; from the self-destruction that will follow from: that
warfare: from these there is no escape for Capitalism.


The proletariat will not be able to bear the strain of the
struggle. They will be forced to revolt in order to escape
from the slaughter and oppression.
And they can only escape Imperialism by destroying
Capitalism.
Their revolt, then, is the necessary Revolution against
World Capitalism, the Social-Revolution of the World-
Proletariat, the World Revolution.
111.
This Revolution is possible and feasible.
It is so from the following reasons: —
Capitalism is ripe for Socialism.
The war has laid the foundations for Socialism.
Capitalism itself must go over to Socialism —State
Socialism, of course.
The proletariat is moving in the same direction with
natural evolution.
The material and moral results of the war are so
disastrous for the proletariat that it must come toi revolution.
The destruction of productive power, the pain, the hate,
the hunger, the never-ending slaughter, will drive the prole-
tariat to revolution during or after the war.
The proletariat is so strong in its organisation that it
is quite able to carry through the Revolution.
The following programme could, we think, be accepted
by the international proletariat.
Political power to be in the hands of the proletariat.
Legislation by the proletariat.
The guarantee of a decent standard of living to all
workers. All workers to be equal.
Control and regulation of all production and distribu-
tion by the proletariat.
Compulsory work for all.
Repudiation of the National Debts.
Confiscation of war profits.
Only capital and income to be taxed : the tax on the
former rising till it amounts to confiscation.
Confiscation of banks.
Confiscation of all large businesses.
Confiscation of the land. ,


Judicial rights to be vested in the proletariat.
Abolition of all tolls and tariffs.
Abolition of present military systems. Arming of the
proletariat.
On this programme the international proletariat can
unite and win.
On this programme it would win.
IV.
The workers of the world have a brilliant example to
guide them. That example is the Russian Revolution. It
has shown that only two things are necessary for success:
unity of the workers, national and international; and simul-
taneous revolt.
If the workers of a country are not united they will be
defeated by the international bourgeoisie.
If the proletariat does not go in for the complete over-
throw of the Capitalist system it cannot free itself nor any
other exploited class, and will not get the support from
those others it would, otherwise receive.
But the Russian Revolution has done: something more.
It has discovered the form by which the proletariat ran
achieve: victory : Workers’ Councils (Soviets). These it has
set up in every village and every province in the country.
These Councils have all economic and political power.
The Workers’ Councils, which will destroy Capitalism
and establish Socialism; which will expropriate Capitalism
and transfer all power and wealth to Socialism; which .will
build up Socialism politically and economically: these
Councils are the form and expression of the New Society, of
the New Humanity.
At present they embrace only the struggling, the
victorious proletariat; but in the coming time they will
comprise the human race.
The Councils of Labour—of Labour and nothing but
Labour —wall, in the days to come, be the highest and
holiest corporation of humanity.
Unity of the national proletariat; unity of the inter-
national proletariat; the uniting and organising of the
proletariat into- Workers’ Councils —these are the three great


things the Russian Revolution has taught the workers of
the world.
If the West European, the North American, the; world-
proletariat, were united; if they would establish the new
International; if they would all revolt at the same time; if
they would organise themselves in. Workers’ Councils and
take over all economic; and political power —then would the
World Revolution be accomplished.
Already we see in the not distant future the New
International, the great Workers’ Council of all the nations
of the earth.
Already we see the International Workers’ Council, the
forerunner of the new, free, Communist Humanity.
