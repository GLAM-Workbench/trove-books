RETROSPECT
With acknowledgement to C. R. Hodge, Esq., author of " Encounter Bay—
The miniature Naples of Australia.”
Congregationalism on the South Coast began in 1839 with the
coming of the Rev. Ridgeway William Newland, who had terminated
a long pastorate at the Congregational Church, Hanley, Staffordshire,
and journeyed South on the ” Charles Forbes ” to settle as the pioneer
pastoralist of Encounter Bay.
From the time of his arrival Mr. Newland regularly held Divine
Service in tent, hut, or his own home. In 1846 was opened the
Tabernacle at Yilki—the first Church on the South Coast—and from
this point the pastor’s activities radiated. His Christian zeal is shown
in the forming of Fellowships at Encounter Bay, Bald Hills, Port
Elliot, Currency Creek, Goolwa, and Milang.
The Tabernacle was a quaint little structure, measuring 28 feet by
19 feet, with French windows, which opened out upon a verandah
on either side. It also had a small belfry, and the bell that was
hung there in 1854 is the same which now calls worshippers to the
Newland Memorial Church.
Mr. Newland’s long ministry ended in 1864, when he suffered a
fatal accident. His remains for a while were interred under the
pulpit of the Tabernacle, but have since been removed to the Victor
Harbour Cemetery. The first Chairman of the District Council and
a J.P., he was prominent in all public movements, whether religious,
social, or political.
The Rev. Charles Hodge- -second pioneer pastor of the South —
began a twenty years’ ministry in 1866, and during his regime services
were commenced at Victor Harbour, sometimes in the dining-room
of the Crown Hotel, sometimes in a wool store where Pipiriki guest
home now stands. The first Newland Memorial Church—so named
in honour of the pioneer pastor —was opened in July, 1869, being
built and paid for during Mr. Hodge’s ministry. When in May,
1919, an annexe was added, it was named after the Rev. Charles
Hodge to perpetuate the memory of his valued services, the comprehen-
sive nature of which is indicated by the memorial tablet in the Church
whereon he is described as " pastor, teacher, physician, and friend.”
Thus, these two pioneer ministers laboured for forty-seven years,
during which they firmly established a high standard of community
service, which has been splendidly maintained during the remaining
years of the Century.


The Rev. T. S. Williams is now the senior Congregational minister
in South Australia, and we regret that through advancing years he
feels unable to be present at our celebrations.
The Rev. W. Penry Jones accepted our invitation to participate in
the Centenary meetings, but the Lord recently called him home to his
reward.
The Rev. D. J. Wellington returns in the august capacity of Presi-
dent of the Methodist Conference—a happy symbol of the cordial
relationships we have always enjoyed with our Methodist brethren.
The Rev. A. W. Gordon ministered during the war years, and him-
self left for " the front ” from Newland Memorial.
During the ministry of the Rev. A. C. Stevens, Churches were
built at Yilki and Newlandtown. These, with Lower Inman and
Waitpinga, are now under the care of the Parkin Mission, and enjoy
the leadership of the Rev. J. I. Loughhead. The latter Church was
born through the zeal and enterprise of the Rev. L. G. C. Pleass, who
was responsible for the formation of Fellowships in all four District
Churches.
The Rev. J. D. Northey’s name will always be associated with the
successful planning and erection of the present Temple at a cost of
nearly £lO,OOO.
The Rev. Charles Watts successfully guided the Church through the
period of world depression. He was largely responsible for the
present District Churches scheme. While here he served a term as
Chairman of the Congregational Union.
The present pastor is the Rev. C. Denis Ryan,
Were it possible to name all who deserve mention in this record,
there would be revealed a steady succession of effective witness, loyal
service, and steadfast faith. For these and every mercy we render
our grateful thanks to Almighty God.
" With memory dear, and hope aflame,
We dedicate to Thy Great Name;
Bless Thou this Church with peace and grace,
And make us worthy of our race.
(A. C Newbury.)


" The whole earth h the tomb of heroic men. Their story is not
graven only in stone over their clay, but abides everywhere as
an invisible symbol woven into the stuff of other men’s lives."
POINTS TO REMEMBER.
1. Please wear your name badge at all gatherings.
2. Please do not leave without signing the Visitors' Book. It will
be historical.
3. Please purchase a Centenary Souvenir Button (price, Is.). It
bears a picture of the Church.
4. Please remember —the Centenary Appeal Fund closes on Bth July.
We hope to install a new organ as a permanent mark of
the Centenary, and also to repay a substantial amount off
the existing debt.
HAVE YOU HELPED YET ?
5. Throughout the week—for your interest
AN HISTORICAL EXHIBITION
collected and displayed by C. R. Hodge, Esq.
THE FIRST FELLOWSHIP.
Formed in 1850, the first Church Membership consisted of Rev.
R. W. Newland, Martha Newland, Michael Wardle, Thomas Spry,
Ezra Robinson, Dorothy Robinson, Elizabeth Hunt, and Mary Ann
Truslove.
The cosmopolitan character of its membership (one English and two
Scotch Baptists, one Episcopalian and four Independents) is still a
feature of our Church.


We cordially invite you to every session of our meetings.
Your fellowship in re-union and in rendering thanks to God
for His goodness in the past will inspire us as we face the
future with high resolve to live and work for Christ in the new
century.
