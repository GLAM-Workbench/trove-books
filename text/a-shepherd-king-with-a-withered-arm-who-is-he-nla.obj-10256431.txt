A FOOLISH SHEPHERD-KINO WITH A
WITHERED ARM I
And the Lord said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the
instruments of a foolish shepherd. For, 10, I will raise up a shep-
herd in the land, which shall not visit—or miss (margin)—those that
be cut off-—or lost (margin)—neither shall he seek those that be
scattered—the young (margin)—nor heal that that is broken; neither
shall he feed that which is sound—standeth (margin)—but he shall
eat the flesh of the fat and shall tear their hoofs—or claws, in pieces.
Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock —his own people !
The sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm
shall clean dried up , and his right eye shall be utterly darkened."
(Zechariah xi. 15-17, R.v.).
A shepherd is a man employed in tending, feeding and guard-
ing sheep. In Scriptures, a pastor of a church, parish or congrega-
tion, is also called a shepherd, as in Ezekiel xxxiv. In Jeremiah xii.
10, and xxv. 32-38, kings, as rulers of the people, are called shep-
The reference in the prophecy of Zecharaiah, above quoted,
applies to a king. Christ is appealed to as a Shepherd-King of Israel
(Ps. Ixxx. 1). David was known as a shepherd-king.
Howl, ye shepherds (kings), and cry; and wallow yourselves
in ashes, ye principal—or chief ruler, of the flock; for the days of
your slaughter are fully come, and 1 will break you in pieces, and ye
shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no
way to flee, nor the principal—king or ruler —to escape." (Jer. xxv.
34-35. Read from verse 32 to 38).
These two passages of Scripture, I believe, refer to the same
king, in alliance with others. To enable us to know him, to whom
God refers as a foolish shepherd-king, a mark is put upon him—a mark
so distinct that all the world may know what it is, even if all cannot
see it. This mark is " a withered or clean dried up arm." There is
but one king ruling a great nation, who is in alliance with the dragon
—Rome, and the false prophet—Turkey (See Rev. xvi. 12-14), who
has a withered arm, and that is the Kaiser of Germany, who is called
the beast in text quoted, being a type of Anti-Christ—the beast of
Revelation xiii. 1-5
He is called " foolish," because, while the nation he ruled over
was prospering and held, vast possessions, and he personally was one
of the richest kings in Europe, yet he coveted the possessions of
others, and determined to take them by force. As in the case of
Ahab, king of Israel, who took by force a poor man's small plot of


ground, after killing him, judgment in his case quickly followed.
God's messenger (Elijah) was sent to the king, to whom he said,
11 Hast thou killed and also taken possession?" Thus saith the Lord,
" In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick
thy blood, even thine." (Read i Kings ch. xxi., xxii. 34-38). Com-
pare this act of the King of Israel with that of the Kaiser of Ger-
many, with regard to the people of Belgium. He has taken the lives
of tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children, and taken
possession of the whole land by force. Many millions of the inhabi-
tants have been left homeless, and made dependent on the bounty of
others to keep them alive. As surely as Ahab, King of Israel, lost
his life, for an offence which was as nothing in comparison to the
Kaiser's, he will come to an ignominious end. The prophet speaks of
the foolish shepherd-king's callous nature, " He shall not miss or
care for those that are cut off or lost." His wilfully sacrificing the
lives of millions of his own people, without a pang, and his_ killing
unoffending people on the high seas, and rejoicing over them, is proof
of this.
His indifference to the fate of young children is stated. " Neither
shall he seek (to save) the young sheep' that be scattered." This also
can be laid to the charge of the Kaiser in the sinking of the s.s.
<l Lusitania," with some fourteen hundred passengers —one-third of
whom were women and children —without a moment's warning. His
indifference to the fate or suffering of his wounded soldiers is also
stated, " Nor heal that that is broken." Thousands of his own
wounded have been trampled to death by the hosts of his own armed
men following after; it has been no uncommon thing to hear the
shrieks of wounded men lying under the dead; many were thus
trampled to death, and buried alive. His leaving his army to feed
themselves at the expense of others is also stated, " Neither shall he
feed that which is sound (or standeth)." It is proved that millions
of the inhabitants of Belgium have been deprived of all they pos-
sessed and left to starve, while the Germans were fed at their
expense. The luxurious living of the Kaiser's hosts of armed men,
when opportunity offered, and the wanton or wilful destruction of
everything which could, not be eaten or taken away, is stated, " He
shall eat the flesh of the fat," and " He shall tear their hoof in
pieces." The history of the German army in Belgium, during the
last twelve months, is written in blood, in fire, and in pillars of
smoke. The shepherd-king, called foolish at first, is called <£ worth-
less" at the end. Woe is pronounced upon him and his people.
(Read Jeremiah xxv. 32-38.) " The sword shall be upon his arm,"
" And there was given to him a great sword " (Rev. vi. 3, 4). By
the power of the sword the Kaiser hoped to overcome all nations and
to rule the world. He is reported to have said, " All these things are
valueless to me, unless, also, I am able to dominate and coerce the
whole world." This has been his great ambition, and for the attain-
ment of which he prepared his army ever since 1882, when he entered
into alliance with Austria and Italy.


"The sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye."
The sword upon his eye indicates that his mind or mental vision,
dominating his actions, was a determination to remove all obstacles
that stood in his way, " to dominate and coerce the whole world " by
the power of his sword or army. " His right eye shall be dar-
kened," means his mind's eye has been darkened by him who rules
the world of darkness—the devil (see Eph. vi. 12). This condition
of mental blindness is spoken of by St. Paul, " In the vanity of
their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated, or cut
off from the life of God." (Eph. iv. 17, 18). While the withered
arm is given as a distinguishing mark on the person of the shepherd-
king, it refers also to the clean drying up of the forces of the sword,
on which the Kaiser has depended; it becomes " worthless " for pur-
poses of aggression. Thus, in a few short sentences, we are shown
the rise and fall of him who is a type of Antichrist. That the Ger-
mans are being forced to fight and do things against their wills, by
domineering rulers, headed by the Kaiser, is clearly stated by the
German Humanity League in their bold address to their fellow-men.
GERMAN PROTEST AGAINST THE WAR.
See Argus (Melbourne), 6th September, 1915.
"An Indignant Nation Held Down by Force."
The following manifesto has been issued by the committee of the German
Humanity League to its associates and to friends in Europe and America
" Dear Comrades, —Although by base treachery Ernst Schuste was betrayed
at Magdeburg and met a hero's death, his work has not perished, and we shall
not cease to oppose by propaganda the iniquitous policy of the Imperial Gov-
ernment. By false declarations the press is compelled to deceive the Father-
land, and our compatriots continue to be slaughtered in the trenches. By golden
gifts the members of the Reichstag and publicists have been seduced to betray
the people's cause they had sworn to defend.
" We ask all our associates to enforce in their towns and communes the truth
which every wage-earner and toiler must be made to grasp —' Dunch die Geduld
Vernunst und Zeit wird moglich die unmoglichkeit.' We must not be dis-
heartened by the knowledge of the internal oppression which holds down by
force a restless and indignant nation. It should spur us on to proclaim with
renewed vigour that the true patriots are those who, loving and defending their
own homes and kinsfolk, respect and maintain inviolate the rights of all peoples
to a common measure of freedom and justice.
"We are convinced, therefore, that there has been no conspiracy by any
Government or nation against Germany, and that, on the contrary, it is only by
the victory of the Allied armies as the guardians of humanity that we shall be
emancipated from the accursed yoke of Prussian militarism. It is this yoke
which crushes us to slavery, and enlightened democrats in all countries must
assist us in breaking it before German States can regain the pathway of peace.
"We desire outraged Belgium, Luxembourg, and France to be restored to
tranquillity and the liberation of Poland and Bohemia from the fetters of servi-
tude. For nearly a year a devastating conflict has shattered our homes,
darkened our lives, robbed us of our bravest sons, and set the whole civilised
world against us. Our Government has, by foul corruption, deceived the
Turkish nation and compassed its ruin. Let us look facts plainly in the face.
No State coveted our land or menaced German integrity. Our ships were free
to sail, and were welcomed in every ocean. Our citizens enjoyed fullest civil
rights in all parts of the world. Our industrial output found a ready market in


every quarter of the globe. Commerce was increasing year by year. Every-
where the German flag was respected. To their last hours the Kaiser, Von
Tirpitz, and Bethmann-Hollweg will carry upon them the brand of shame for
the unparalleled ruin they have wrought and the misery into which they have
plunged the world by their barbarism on land and sea.
" Fortified by these reasons, we earnestly appeal to every democratic Saxon,
Bavarian, Hanoverian, and Wurtemberger to join hands with all who realise the
unspeakable crime of unprovoked war, and to persevere in demanding the
evacuation of Brabant, Flanders, and Luxembourg, and the cessation of bloody-
outrage in Alsace and Lorraine."
The manifesto is signed by Karl Bernstein, Conrad Schwabe, Emil Gost,
Gustav Ochs, Jacob Mamelsdorp, Franz Gaussen, Heinrich Glauert, Otto
Schlich, Frierlich Kohler, Adolf Ruppin, Eitel Blumenfeldt, and Albrecht
Zettel.
In this statement we hear the voice of the German nation, long-
ing to be delivered from the heavy yoke of a cruel master. I believe
that the nation will come out of this cruel and oppressive war, into
which their leaders have led them, a very different people. As they
pass out of the refining by fire, they will, I trust, shake off all de-
moniacal influences they are now under, and, in a humble and contrite
spirit, turn to Him Who does not forget that their forefathers, in the
days of Luther, proved steadfast and true to the Protestant cause,
against the Papacy. Many noble martyrs died in defence of the
truth. Rome's hatred of the Lutherans continues to this day as bitter
&S ever, and it is believed by many that the Jesuits are responsible
for this war. This could not be unless the head of the Church
approved. " Down with the Lutherans !" is the cry; in other words,
" Down with the Protestant Church and nation !" " Down with Great
Britain !" This was the devil's device, and by choosing a Protestant
king to do the work he prepares the way for the followers of Anti-
Christ to war against the King of kings and His chosen people (Rev.
xvii. i-i5). The doom of the harlot church is pronounced in verses
16-18 L


The Great War of the Nations Now
Proceeding (1914-5), and the Lessons to
be derived from the Same.
See Isaiah xxi. 1-10; Joel iii. 9- 11 ; Zeph. i. 14-18; iii. 6-8;
Luke xii. 51 ; Rev. xvi. 12-16.
The prophet Isaiah shows the first signs of the gathering storm;
Joel proclaims to the nations the great war, and the two sides taken;
jZephaniah shows that in consequence of the Christian nations sinning
against the Lord, by renouncing Him, and being prepared to follow
Antichrist, God's great wrath is being poured out. In St. Luke
we are told by our Lord that the nations of Europe would be divided
in manner we see it; in Revelation we are shown how the nations
represented by the dragon (Rome —Austria); the beast (the Kaiser —
Germany); and the false prophet (Turkey)—being demoniacally pos-
sessed, go forth to gather the nations together to war. The further
dismemberment of the Turkish Empire is shown under the symbol of
the drying up of the Euphrates.
A grievous vision is shown to the prophet
Isaiah xxi. 1= 10 (R.V.) —"The treacherous dealer dealeth trea-
cherously, and the spoiler spoileth." So
grievous is the vision to the prophet, that it fills him with anguish;
he could not hear of it without pain; it filled him with dismay, so
that he could not look at the awful scene, such ,as is being enacted
daily before us now. Can we wonder ? It is indeed a ghastly sight
to see the blood of millions of our fellow-creatures being poured out
like dust and their bodies thrown in heaps like dung out of, a stable.
What must have added to the anguish of the prophet was to see in
vision, at the same time, the rejoicing and feasting of multitudes
(verse 5).
Then came a message from the Lord, saying, " Go, set up a
watchman; let him declare what he seeth." The watch is set, and
directions given to the watchman as to what he is to look out for; he
is shown an assembly of troops preparing for war, and told to look
out for the first signs of a movement in the camp as going forth to
war. This faithful watcher watches day and night for years; and in
in 1914 he noticed troops moving in battle order, and announced the
fact in a loud;, clear voice, sounding like the roar of a lion, " Behold
here cometh troops of men (cavalry and infantry), and horsemen in
pairs" (artillery). There are two Babylons one in the East
(Constantinople), the seat of the little horn of Dan. viii. 9 ; and
the other in the west (Rome), the seat of the little horn of Dan.
vii. 8 ; both are to be destroyed. The one coming out of one
of the four divisions of the Greek Kingdom (Dan. viii. 9), will
be finally destroyed without hands (Dan. viii. 25); in manner
shown in Rev. xix. 19-21. The other, coming out of the Roman
Empire (Dan. vii. 8), will be destroyed by fire (Dan. vii. n); in
manner stated in Rev. xvii. 16-18.


In the present war we see Austria, representing the dragon'
power, at the right hand of Germany, representing the power of the
beast (Antichrist), and Turkey, representing the false prophet, at his
left. At the end, the Latin Kingdoms combined, will be at the right
side of the beast, and the false prophet at his left; Germany giving
place to Russia, out of which the real Antichrist will come. The
recent change in the name of its capital from St. Petersburgh to
P E T R O G R A D—666
80 8 300 100 70 3 100 1 4
is significant, as showing the centre out of which the great beast is to
come (Rev. xiii. 1-18). The last king —a great military leader, who
will succeed the present Czar —may assume this name, and thus
announce himself as " The Antichrist " (1 John ii. 18).
666 is the mark of Satan and of all blasphemers of God.

The prophet's closing words should be noted, " That which I
have heard from the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, have I de-
clared unto you." After saying this, the prophet speaks of a burden
of "Dumah," which means " silence." Silence, which has been a
burden up to a certain time, is broken; and that time was reached
in 1914, as shown in "A Voice of Thunder." The seals of judg-
ment then began to be opened.
Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for
the time (of the end) is
The Opening of the First Seal

This text (Rev. vi. 3, 4) ap-
plies to Germany.


We thus see how the burden of "silence," or uncertainty, with
regard to the appointed times, was removed, so as to warn the Church
of the coming Antichrist —the mystery of darkness (i John ii. 18).
All seven seals of Rev. vi. and viii. are judgment seals ; the sixth relates
to the casting down of Satan to the earth (1925), as shown in Rev. xii.
9. The seventh seal (Rev. viii. 1) announces silence in heaven for
the space of about half-an-hour, or seven years—(36o years —time,
divided by 48, gives 7! years). This is the last week of' years spoken
of in Daniel ix. 27, when the Apostate Jews will be in firm covenant
with Antichrist, 1927 + 7 = 1934-
After the silence was broken, the prophet saw in vision a messen-
ger coming out of Seir, approaching a " watchman " —a minister or
overseer doubtless, of one of the churches, and heard him askiing,
what time of the night it was. This watchman made no reply; he
remained dumb, having neglected his duty as a " Watcher," he was
unable to give a reply to this very important question at this time —
1914. Seir means a tempest raised by demoniacal power; such as is
working now in gathering the nations to war (see Rev. xvi. 12-14).
One coming out of Seir aptly represents a man coming out of the
tempest or war-storm now raging.
" His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge (of
the appointed times); they are all (like) dumb (silent) dogs, they can-
not bark (or sound the alarm), dreaming (of good things to come),
lying down (taking it easy), loving to slumber (remaining uncon-
scious of passing events, as they lead up to the time of great danger,
the whole church is threatened with). Rev. iii. 10 ; xii. ; Matt. xxiv.
15-22 ; Isa. lvi. 10-12. Read.
To the inquirer at this time of great trouble, when God's great
wrath is being poured out upon the nations of Christendom (Zeph.
i. 14-18; iii. 6-8); it is a matter of life and death, and he is deter-
mined to know how near we are to the end. It is now asked by many,
Can this be the last great war of the age —Har-Magedon? It is this
he wishes to know when he asks, "What of the night?" How near
are we to the end ? This second watchman being well informed on the
subject, promptly answers the question by informing the inquirer
that the morning (Christ —the bright Morning Star) ccmeth first, and
.that the night (Antichrist —the powers of darkness) follows after.
This watchman is so eager to satisfy the inquirer's reasonable re-
quest that he encourages him to come as often as he pleases (Isa.
xxi. 11, 12).
Let the reader note particularly the watchman's very clear state-
ment, made, as if at this very time (1914-15), when the powers of
darkness are let loose; that out of this hour of darkness the Church
—the watching Bride —is to be taken (Rev. iii. 10); and that it is
only after this that darkness (Satan and his angels—Rev. xii. 9-17)
will cover the earth; and gross darkness (Antichrist and his fol-
lowers—Rev. xiii.) the people. (Isa. lx. 2).
How very near we are to this time Rev. xvi. 12 to 14, now
fulfilling in its initial stages, shows. We will now consider the light
shown on this very important subject by St. John.


The drying up of the great river of Babylon the
Rev. xvi. 12 Euphrates, refers to the Turkish Empire. The war
now proceeding will deprive her of Constantinople,
Palestine, Macedonia, and I think Syria also. She has already lost
Egypt and Cyprus (see Ezek. xxxv.). Constantinople is spoken of as
Mount Seir, being the centre of all the abominations of the earth,
the avowed enemies of the Eord (Dan. viii. li, 12).
Refers to three devil-possessed powers uniting,
Rev. xvi. 13, 14 even as we see it, "unto the war of the great day
of God —the Almighty." These three powers are
shewn as possessed by unclean spirits. The nations are referred to as
(1) the dragon Rome (Austria); (2) the beast —the Kaiser (Ger-
many); (3) the false prophet (Turkey). These evil powers are to
lose one-third of their armies (men killed) before the war closes (see
Rev. ix. 14, 15). Germany is said to have entered this war with an
army of 8,000,000, Austria with 5,000,000, and Turkey with 2,000,000.
One-third of the whole would be 5,000,000. The unloosing of the
four angels who were bound at the great river Euphrates, shews that
the execution of their judgment by the sword is connected with the
evil powers, coming under the designation of " Babylon."
" Behold I come as a thief"—not to be seen ;
Rev. xvi. 15 comes for the purpose of removing his elect —not aP
Christians, but only such as are counted worthy (Luke
xx. 34-36). "Because thou didst keep the word of My patience—
patiently watched and waited for Me, I also will keep thee from the
hour of trial or temptation, that hour (Antichrist's, the twelfth) —(1925
to 1935) —which is to come upon the whole inhabited earth, to try
and to tempt them that dwell upon the earth " (Rev. iii. 10). The
trial and temptation of this time will be to 1 choose between Christ and
Antichrist (St. John v. 42, 43). After this promise of deliverance
our Lord said/, 1 1 I come quickly ; hold fast that which thou hast,
that no one take thy crown " (Rev. iii. 11). See 2 Tim. iv. 8, which
tells us for whom the crown is reserved.
"And they gathered themselves into the place which
Rev. xvi. 16 is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon." Here will the
career of Antichrist and his false prophet come to an
end, and all their hosts destroyed in one night by the angel of the
Lord (see Rev. xix. 19-21 ; Ezekiel xxxix.).
This sudden destruction of millions upon millions of armed men
is stated in a few words by the prophet Isaiah (ch. xliii. 16, 17),
" Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in
the mighty waters •' which bringeth forth the chariot and the horse, the
army and the power; they lie down together (as soldiers in camp and
trenches do), they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched
—their lives blown out, as a wick.
In comparing the two texts, Isa. xxi. 8-10, and Rev. xvi. 13, 14,
we are taught the same lessons. While the former tells us of the
war, the latter 1 tells us of the three great nations —Austria, Germany
and Turkey—which are responsible for the same. Again, comparing


Isa. xxi. ii, 12, with Rev. xvi. 15, 16, we are clearly told that our
Lord will come between now —the great war (1914-15) —and the
gathering together of the nations at Har-Magedon (1934-5). Once
the burden of silence (Dumah) was broken, as to the exact time we
are living in, as it was in August, 1914, on/ the opening of the first
and second judgment seals (see texts i. and ii.), the " Watchman "
was in a position to announce definitely that the morning—Christ
—cometh first, and then comes also the night—Antichrist. The
teaching is so plain as to leave people without the shadow of excuse
if they refuse to receive it; only the wilfully blind and deaf will be
left without understanding the message. These, like the foolish vir-
gins in the parable (Matt. xxv. 1-13), will not concern themselves
about the subject, and will occupy their time in buying and selling as
usual. Commercial matters absorb all their thoughts and energies;
but, as sure as the sun shines, a day will overtake these unawares
(Luke xxi. 34-36), and they will be shut out of the kingdom, and
will be obliged to go through the night of darkness, and suffer all the
horrors reserved for that time, when the devil and his angels will be
visibly present upon the earth (Read Rev. xii. 7-9, 17; xiii.).
Many Christians are under the impression that every believer
in the Lord will be removed from the earth at this time; this is a
great mistake. One, counted wise and worthy (Matt. xxv. 10 ; Luke
xx. 34-36), will be taken, and the foolish one left (Matt. xxv. 11,12).
At a later period, designated "The days of Lot" —judgment by fire;
one —the wicked, shall be taken or cut off, and the righteous left to
inherit the earth. See Matt. xxiv. 29-31 ; xxv. 31-46. Read Matt,
xiii. 24-30 ; 36-43.
1 have stated that in fulfilment of Rev. ix. 14, 15, one-third of the
armies of the three evil powers (Rev. xvi. 13, 14) are to be killed.
Taking the armies in order given—
1. Austria —Rome —the dragon —5,000,000-4-3 = 1,666,666
2. Germany—the beast - 8,000,000-4-3=2,666,666
3. Turkey—the false prophet 2,000,000-4-3= 666,666
The predominance of the devil's number speaks for itself. "1 "
and "2" heading the first two nations indicate that they were
Christian, but were overcome by Satan ; while the false prophet has
not one redeeming trait in his character. From the Sultan to the
lowest of his subjects, the race is wholly on the devil's side.
We will now consider other evidence bearing to this great war
of the nations.


The Alarm ! War Proclaimed!
(See "The Alarm Sounds," 190?, revised 1912)
Proclaim ye this among: the nations: Prepare War! Stir
up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let
them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your
pruning-hooks into spears; let the weak (or small nation —
Great Britain) say, I am strong (Joel iii. 9, 10).

The whole land (Europe) shall be devoured by the fire of His
jealousy: for He shall make an end, yea, a terrible end. of all them
that dwell in the land (Zeph. i. 14-18). The present conflict is but a
prelude of the greater judgments to follow (Rev. xix. 17-21), which
will centre in and about Jerusalem. Surely God is shewitg us that
His great wrath cannot be withheld any longer. Let each nation
examine its own attitude towards the Lord whom they are daring to
despise. Read Ezek. xxxv. and xxxix.


Once more Jesus —the Strong Man, crieth, not over Jerusalem
alone, but over the whole earth, because the inhabitants know not
the time of their visitation (Luke xix. 41-44). The acceptable year of
the Lord, or the year of the Lord's good pleasure, is fast closing in
(Luke iv. 18-21); and the people know it not. "The day of ven-
geance of our God " (Isa. lxi. 2) immediately follows, and the people
care not. (See Isa. xxxiv. 8; lxiii. 4). The nations, called " Chris-
tian," are mostly departing from the faith, and giving heed to
seducing spirits and doctrines of demons (1 Tim. iv. 1, 2). Can you
wonder at Jesus, Who died for the sins of the whole human race,
weeping bitterly now, when men and women in Christian lands are
being prepared to worship the devil and the beast—Antichrist ?
(Rev. xiii. 4). Let us show our sympathy for our dear Saviour by
doing all we can to enlighten our fellow creatures of these things
coming to pass in our time, God helping us to do our duty for His
name sake. Keep in mind Rev. xiv. 9-12.
The Division of the Nations of Europe into Two Hostile
Camps. 1882 to the End (1935). (Luke xii. 51.)
In referring to this text in 44 The
Think 89 rather: 215 Alarm Sounds " (1912), I said, 44 The
y e 5 r 1 7° text illustrates the condition of Europe

in 60 one 125 had been entered into, I made a note
the 14 house 481 under the text, as given at page 53,

division 160 * 119 from His place in mid-heaven (1882)
A.M. 6010 He said, 44 From henceforth the
A.D. 1915 nations of Europe shall be divided
into two hostile camps."
This is just what has come to pass. After sitting in judgment
on the Church for 32 years (1882 to August 1, 1914), and finding that
the Christian nations were really getting worse and worse (2 Tim.
iii. 13), this judgment by the sword has been sent for amendment.
44 The beginning of sorrows, and there shall be great mournings; the
beginning of famine, andf many shall perish; the beginning of wars,
and the powers shall stand in fear " (2 Esdras xvi. 18). The first three
judgment seals (Rev. vi. 1-6) are covered bv these events ; two we see
in operation now —war and great mourning; the third will bring


famine. " The beginning of evils (come under the fourth seal —Rev.
vi. 7, 8), when " Death " —the Antichrist, and " Hell " —the false
prophet, are seen ascending out of the bottomless pit), when all shall
tremble !"
The prophet then asks, (i What shall they do in all this when the
evils (Satan and his myriads of angels come down to this earth
—Rev. xii. 9, 10, 12) shall come?" What, indeed? The powers of
evil will have dominion over the people ; and vice, in all its most
hideous forms, will be indulged in without restraint. Need I say
more, the picture cannot be painted too black. This applies chiefly
to Europe, where the beast's power will be supreme (Rev. vi. 7, 8).
See Rev. xiii., which tells us of the only conditions under which
men and women will be allowed to live under Antichrist's rule.
To understand the present position clearly, so that we may know
exactly how near we are to the end of the age, we must consider cer-
tain appointed times; (1) Of the Jews, while under displeasure; (2)
the Gentiles, to the end of their dominion and rule; (3) Turkey's
existence as a nation.
1. The Jews. Their time is chronologically fixed, as beginning
from the year following the death of Josiah—their last independent
kin g> 593 B -C.
2. The Gentiles. Their time counts from the fourth year of
King Jehoiakim, when he became a servant of Nebuchednezzar, King
of Babylon, in 589 J B.C. This was to count the first year, or be-
ginning, of Gentile rule (Jer. xxv. 1; see Luke xxi. 24).
3. The False Prophet. The beginning of his rule began in A.D.
637, when the Saracens got possession of Jerusalem.
The first and second were to continue for 2520' years —seven
times. 360 x 7 (See Lev. xxvi. 27, 28 ; Dan. iv. 16). The third was
to continue for 1290 years, after which the Turkish Empire—one
abomination, will merge into, or become absorbed in Antichrist's
dominion—the abomination of desolation (Dan. viii. 13; xii. n).
A.—The Jews, 593 B.C. to 1927 A.D. =2520 years
B. —The Gentiles, 589 8.C. to A.D. =2520 ~
C. —The Turks, 637 A.D. to 1927 A.D. =1290 ~
The Gentile Times will be extended by 3^-years, x +
The Jewish Times will be prolonged for 7 years. 1927 +7 =1934
The treading down of Jerusalem will be extended
by 3i ye irs. 1930J + 3i= 1934
See Rev. xi. 2; xiii. 5; Dan. ix. 27. Revelation xix. 19-21 will
be fulfilled at the end of 1934, at Har-Magedon. Read Isa. x. 5-7,
and you will understand the position of the Apostate Jews at the
end, after the king breaks his covenant with them—l93ol to 1934.
Had the time of the Nativity not been revealed in 1898, in man-
ner stated in " A Great Revelation," Part 1., by converting the text
(Rev. i. 8, R.V.), into numbers, at the Lord's directions to " Count
the numbers," the beginning and closing of events just given could
A


never have been fixed. I have been accused of presumption as a fixer
of dates. I deny this emphatically. All that I have done is to de-
clare to the world the new things God has now revealed (Isa. xlviii. 6)
as to how all the appointed times were laid by measure in the Temple
of God (Isa. xix. 19, 20 ; Rev. xi. 1), and by number in the Word of
God (2 Esd. iv. 37). This evidence has been before the people for
over sixteen years, and has been rejected. Perhaps this war will be the
means of rivetting the attention of the Churches to the " appointed
times/' so that the people may be fully informed of the same.
1882—time of the end (Dan. xii. 8, 9); 1898—Revelation of the
time of the Nativity, in words of writing sealed in a book (Isa. xxix.
9-12, R.V.); 1914 —Revelation of him who is a type of Antichrist,
aspiring to have universal dominion ; 1930J —The Antichrist rules
absolutely over Europe—a fourth part of the earth (Rev. vi. 7, 8).
Note how sixteen years come between : 188 2+16 = 18 98+ 16 = 1914 +
16 = 1930.
To Nebuchadnezzar, the head of Babylon, it was said, " Let
his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given
unto him; and let seven times pass over him " (Dan. iv. 16). The
present Kaiser of Germany, to the horror and surprise of all nations
—Christians especially—has his nature suddenly changed. Human
life has lost its sacredness to him; he has now "the dasposition of a
beast, not caring even for the lives of his own people.
Great God, what do I see and hear:
Tlie end of things created !
The fudge of mankind doth appear,
On clouds of glory seated.
The trumpet sounds, the graves restore
The dead which they contained before :
Prepare, my soul, to meet Him.
O World ! so madly rushing on,
List to the clarion cry
Now sounding forth o'er hill and dale—
" Thy fudge is drawing nigh ! "
Escape for life whilst thou hast time;
As Saviour yet He stands,
With pleading Voice and love Divine,
And gracious out-stretched Hands.
Yea, disregard not, careless ones,
His tender, yearning cry—
" Come unto Me, O sinners, come:
Why will ye die ? O why ? "
Arise, O " foolish virgins " all,
Replenish whilst ye may
The " oil " of grace the Spirit gives
In this accepted day.
C.G.L.
Read carefully the Parable of the Tares (Matt. xiii. 24-30, 36-43),
and the sentence of the Judge (Matt. xxv. 31-46).

Although there are 26 letters in the
used, generally, for the purposes of writing, "
Greek
stigma
alphabet, only 24 have been
,"(6), and "koppi," (90), being
dropped. The letters F, H, J, Q, V, W and Y, in English, have no equivalents in
Greek, and therefore do not count numerically. T, joined to "h" as in "The,"
counts 9, when not so connected 300; E counts either sor 8; P joined to " h,"
as in " Phil," counts 500, otherwise 80; C is of no value, except when joined to
" h " as in " Christ," when it counts 600.

God graciously gives the inhabitants of the earth timely
warning. He shows us how He hath appointed the time for
the casting down of Satan and his angels to this earth.
Woe ! Woe ! ! Woe ! ! ! to the earth, for Satan is filled w r ith
wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time. Rev. xii. 12.
"I am God, and there is none like Me; declaring the end
from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not
yet done ; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will, do all My
pleasure : calling a ravenous bird from the East, the man of My
counsel from a far country —the East; yea, I have spoken, I
will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed, I will also do it."
—lsa. xlvi. 9-11. This prophecy has now been fulfilled after a.
period of twenty-five centuries: glory be to His Holy-Name.

" In many respects this is a work of great interest and import-
ance. The whole book is worthy of careful study." — The Morning Star.
"The spirit of v the book is unmistakable. It is rightly called
'A Great Revelation.' I trust God will bless it greatly."—(Mrs.) E.
MCHARDIE, Author Midnight Cry.
" I consider it the best and most important book on the subject of
which it treats that has yet been published."—(Rev.) W. C. HAWKINS.
rt I consider it the best and most valuable addition to what I call
Advent literature. But it is something more, and I cannot doubt the
fact that the Holy Spirit has enlightened you to discover the key
which opens the door to heavenly knowledge to those that seek; for it
is indeed 'A Great Revelation.'" —(Rev.) E. H. WRIGHT, M.A.
REV. P. CARLYON, M.A., Hebrew Scholar, Cambridge, says:
" It is in itself an astounding miracle that while the Holy Spirit
caused these things to be written in Hebrew and Greek, the future
language of His chosen people should have been in His mind, and by
and through it (English), He now makes this ' Wonderful Revelation'
to men."
PKRT 11.
" Of its kind, this is certainly the most remarkable book, and the
b.-st, we have yet read. Full of the import of number, and its import

way than Mr. Dimbleby's."— The Morning Star.
