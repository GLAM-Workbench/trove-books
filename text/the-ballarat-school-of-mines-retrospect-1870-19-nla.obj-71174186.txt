ANNUAL REPORT-1876.
The adjourned Annual Meeting of the Governors and Sub-
sei'ibers of The School of Mines was held on Thursday night, Ist
February, at The School, the Worshipful the Mayor of the City,
F. M. Claxton, Esq., J. P., in the chair.
The Annual Report was read as follows :
This special meeting has been convened in consequence of
the meeting of Governors and Subscribers, in accordance with
art. 2 cap. iv. of the Constitution, not having been called last
December. Unfortunately, there is not power to alter the
Constitution, or good reasons might be advanced why much
advantage could be expected to arise from changing the time of
the Annual Meeting from December to January. The Hon.
Auditor?s Report, with Statements of Receipts and Expenditure
for the past Year, are now submitted, from which it can be
gathered that the gross receipts of The School, exclusive of the
Government Grant, have amounted to no less a sum than �978.
On the estimates of expenditure for the year 1875-6 a sum of
�l5OO in aid of Mining Schools was submitted to Parliament, and
a Vote accordingly taken; out of that Vote a sum of �750 was
appropriated by Government to this institution. The Council are
glad to observe that for the financial year 1876-7, the Vote has
been increased by �5OO, but its distribution has not yet been
effected.
The expenditure for the year has been unusually large As
it was found absolutely necessary to increase the accommodation for
students in chemistry, a new laboratory capable of accommodating
eighteen students at one time, has been erected at a total cost of
about �350. Donations of museum specimens having also been
more numerous during the past year, new cases had to be
provided, involving an expenditure of nearly �22.
The number of different persons who have signed the Roll-
book during the year 1876 has been 132, of whom 61 were in
regular attendance during January Term, 47 during April Term,
61 during July Term, and 59 during October Term.
With a view of providing some instruction in Chemistry for
persons engaged in ordinary school duties, special elementary
classes in chemistry have been for some time past in operation, at
which tolerably good and regular attendance has been given. A


liberal donor has very kindly intimated his intention of presenting
funds for providing the fees of five students in metallurgy, assay-
ing, and chemistry, to be nominated from a list of State scholars
furnished by the Inspectors, such studentships to be tenable for a
period of three years.* In announcing the fact, the Council desire
to express their great satisfaction that a suggestion, made in the
last Annual Report, has been thus adopted to the extent named.
It would be very encouraging to the Council to be able at the
next Annual Meeting to report that additional funds have been
similarly provided, and that scholars from colleges and other
schools were included in such a scheme tor rewarding diligent and
specially apt boys, and which bids fair to produce very excellent
results.
Examinations in Mathematics, Geology, Assaying, Metallurgy,
Chemistry, Telegraphy, Mine management, and Engine driving,
have been held in the months of April, June, feeptembei, and
December of last year, and the Council on the reports of the
several Examiners, ?to whom they desire now especially to return
thanks for the labors they have so kindly undertaken ?have
granted the following Certificates, viz. As Assayers?Charles
Elude, a student; Matthew Dougald Hamilton; John Sharp, a
student. Engine-drivers?Thomas Proctor, second class, winding-
engines, Hervy Henry Kendrick, third class, other than winding-
engines ; Hugh Thomas Stevenson, third class, other than winding-
engines. In Geology as applied to Mining?Robert Malachy
Serjeant, a student. Telegraphy ?Jessie M?Phillimy, a student;
Emma Tulloch, a student; Jessie McLaren, a student; Mary Ann
Madden, a student; William Blanchard Griffiths, a student;
William Hughes, a student: Lucy Dora Montgomery, a student;
Thomas Harte, a student; Charlotte Elizabeth Collas, a student.
In connection with the Examinations of The School of Mines,
it may be well to mention that several of the certificate-holders
have in consequence of such proofs of their competency, obtained
good situations in tins Colony, and that steps are being taken to
obtain the recognition of these credentials in the neighboring
Colonies, from which occasionally students are sent to fhe School.
The question of the best system for the treatment of Pyrites
has frequently attracted the attention of the public, particularly
since June, 1873, when an appeal was made to the mining com-
munity for subscriptions to enable the Council to erect suitable
machinery for the purpose of treating pyrites. The Council also
applied to Government for assistance towards the completion of
the works which have been commenced, and on which a sum of
�2OO has been already expended, in building the chimney, arsenic
chambers, and foundation of furnace. These works, now at a
standstill for want of funds, would not only add considerably to
* See Note A, p. 35.


the instruction of the Students, but would supply a means of test-
ing the value of vast quantities of gold-containing mineral, the
proper treatment of which was recognised to be of sufficient
importance to warrant the action of Government in appointing a
Royal Commission to report thereon. Estimated cost of complet-
ing Pyrites works Engine and boiler, �180; triturator, �100;
hot-air pipes, �BO ; ironwork and gearing for furnace, �lOO ; sul-
phuric acid chambers, �l5O ; evaporating pans, lined with lead,
for sulphuric acid chambers, �l5O ; housing for buildings, �2OO ;
completing brickwork, and sundries, �200; total, �ll GO. A
generous offer has been made by Mr James M?Donald to give �25
towards a sum of �lOOO, if thirty-nine others will give similar
amounts.* This opportunity is availed of publicly to thank Messrs
Serjeant, Asr. 5.M.8., Elude, and Caselli, J.P., for their liberal and
unsolicited donation to The School of the patent rights and plans
of ? The Ballarat School of Mines Self-acting Pyrites Furnace,? the
extreme simplicity of the action of which is doubtless a guaranty of
its success. Mr W. J. Clarke, J.P., of Sunbury, presented a sum of
�5O towai'ds the expense of finishing the works?this, in addition
to a like sum contributed to the general funds of The School, and
in respect of which that gentleman has been made a Life-governor
of the Institution.
A large number of volumes have been received from H.M.
Commissioners of Patents, London. As soon as the volumes
requiring it (84) have been bound?and they are now in the hands
of the binder?the whole will be placed on the Library shelves.
It is proposed to make applications to other Public Bodies, both in
England and elsewhere, for similar grants of their publications.
There can be but little doubt that with a larger and better assured
income, whereby the efficiency of the teaching and examining
power of The School can be maintained, not only books, but
models, specimens, and manufactures may reasonably be expected
to be presented, the facilities for the transmission of all such dona-
tions being in no small degree afforded by the appointment of
gentlemen favorable to the development of science as Honorary
Correspondents of The School, a complete list of whom is given on
page 3.
It may be proper again to remind Governors and Subscribers
that as yet The School is not a corporate body. This matter has
been previously referred to in the Reports for 1873 and 1875, and
is, in the opinion of the Council, one of considerable importance.
At the present time it possesses peculiar significance, if only from
the fact of the Pharmacy Act almost pointing to this Institution,
as one of the schools to be authorised to examine persons in
Chemistry.
It is generally admitted that the technical instruction given
* See Note B, p. 35,


to students at The School of Mines, is a necessary part of the grand
scheme of education which the Colony of Victoria has projected.
Provision having been most liberally made by Parliament for the
poorest and richest, by the endowment of the State schools and
University?the most elementary and the highest education being
thereby brought within the reach of all?nothing seems now to be
wanting to perfect the scheme but to establish on a proper basis a
thoroughly effective School of Mines, where the middle class might
be taught the economy of scientific art. Considering the vast
majority composing that class, and the various spheres of useful-
ness in which its energies are constantly engaged, it becomes a
matter of surprise that so little has yet been done to supply this
manifest deficiency.
The thanks of the Council are gratefully presented to all
persons who have either, by presenting donations or otherwise
benefiting the institution, sought to aid the Council in their
endeavors to effect the public objects they have so much at heart.
To the press throughout the Colony, especially the Argus and the
local papers, for leaders and reprints of published statements of
The School; to the Honorary Solicitor (Honorable Henry Cuthbert,
M.L.C.). Honorary Auditor (R, Ford, Esq.), and Messrs Victor,
J.P., Serjeant, Asr. 5.M.8., and Elude (Lecturers), for public
lectures delivered on various subjects, the Council hereby record
their grateful acknowledgements.
Signed on behalf of the Council,
31st January, 1877. JOSEPH F. USHER.
The reports, &c,, were adopted without discussion, and the
following gentlemen were elected to seats on the Council rendered
vacant by effluxion of time: ?Messrs Caselli, J.P., Chauncy, J.P.,
Oddie, J.P., Serjeant, Asr. S.M.E., Usher, M.D., J. Elude, the
Mayor of the City, O. E. Edwards, # J. M. Bickett, and J. Campbell.
All but the last three being retiring members of the Council.
Mr S. L. Learmonth having resigned his trusteeship, his
Honor Judge Rogers was appointed in his place.
The registrar stated that Mr J. M?Donald had offered to make
one of forty gentlemen to give �25 each towards raising the �lOOO
necessary to finish the pyrites works, and hopes were expressed
that this excellent arrangement would be carried out.f
On the motion of Mr J. H. Wilson, a recommendation was
made to the Council anent establishing a Phonetic class in The
School, or at least providing a room where such a class could
meet.
A vote of thanks to the chair closed the meeting.

A FEW WORDS ON THE OBJECTS OF
THE SCHOOL OF MINES.
?To fit the miner by a general review of phenomena observed, and processes used in
various local ties, to adopt what is most suitable to the particular locality,?
to form links in the chain of improvements.?
WARRINGTON W. SMYTH, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.
There are persons who ask, Li Of what use is The School of Mines??
They do not see the practical bearing of the efforts put forth by the
Council to teach subjects with which the ordinary miner is unac-
quainted. M ining, say they, has been carried on from time immemo-
rial by men who had no scientific knowledge, and the success achieved
by them, would have been in no degree different, had they been
instructed in the Art of Mining. In their opinion the continuance
or stoppage of mining operations is dependent almost entirely on
the richness of the ground; in short, they hold to the doctrine of
the old Cornish saying, ? Where it is, there it is.?
Most people, however, are not content to allow matters to
take their course, but are constantly making attempts to improve
what has gone before, and so to direct the operations in which they
are pecuniarily, if not otherwise interested, as to insure the mini-
mum of loss, if not the maximum of profit; this they endeavor by
all legitimate means to accomplish. They possess themselves of
all known facts, and whenever science opens to them new paths to
success, they gladly avail themselves of such experience; and is it
to be supposed in a matter so intimately connected with science,
as is mining, that nothing is to be learnt but what comes under notice
bv the pick and shovel I?that1 ?that in the use of these alone, men are able
intuitively to determine the best methods of searching for, winning,
and turning to account the precious metals, to say nothing of those
substances found therewith, useless until converted into by-products
of commercial value 1 Doubtless, with the aid of science, many a
mine which has ? knocked ? might have proved remunerative :
works could have been carried on at far less cost; much greater
profit might have been made of the vein-stuff, and practical mining
generally, would have benefited had the mine managers been
educated in the Art of Mining. It is evident that a man whose


only knowledge is derived from his individual experience his
daily work?in the mine, will be advantaged by learning what has
been the experience of others similarly circumstanced; and the
meaning of scientific knowledge applied to mining is simply this,
that to the manual dexterity of the miner there shall be added an
acquaintance with those facts relating to mining, which have been
determined by miners and others. The really practical man is not
he who works with his hands only, but who knows how and what
to work.
Mining, also, like other industries, is dependent to a great extent
on the association of Capital with Labor; some assurance, there-
fore, should be given that ignorance shall not usurp the place due
to knowledge, and that the control of the works shall be given to
persons who are competent; although such competency cannot
be proved without trial, yet a manager?s knowledge and character
can be fairly judged of, after proper examination.
The objects of The School of Mines are, to provide means of
instruction in all things pertaining to mining, and to examine into
the qualifications of persons engaged in mining. The various
subjects taught are particularised, and the times and nature
of the examinations are set forth in pages 5 and 6: whilst
it has been the aim of the Council to help the mining
industry in the way proposed, it has been considered advisable to
adopt a standard of education, which may be thought by some per-
sons rather higher than the necessities of mining indicated. A
little reflection, however, will suffice to show that this is nol the
case; because Mathematics, for instance, are taught, it is not there
fore compulsory on persons coming up for examination as Mining
Managers to have passed in Algebra or Geometry. For the Mining
and Land Surveyor these are essential, and to become a Mechanical
Engineer one must be a mathematician first: a Mining Engineer
must in addition have a fair knowledge of Chemistry, Geology, and
Natural Philosophy.
An opportunity is now presented through the liberality of a
friend of The School of Mines, to invite State scholars to pursue
their studies beyond the limits of the course prescribed by Govern-
ment in the State schools ; and notwithstanding the premiums
held out by Government, in the way of Scholarships at the
University of Melbourne, it may reasonably be supposed that of
the thousands on the rolls of those schools, a large percentage
will be debarred, owing to want of means to reside in the metro-
polis, from accepting such scholarships, even were it desirable
for them to devote themselves to a lengthened University training,
with a view of adopting a professional career. In such an institu-
tion as The School of Mines, these young people would not only


receive a less expensive education, but one which would in short
time enable them to earn their livelihood, in a manner more con-
genial to their own tastes and more compatible with the feelings of
their friends and relatives.*
The foundation of a School of Mines on a basis sufficiently
broad, and complete in all its parts, is necessarily a work of time,
especially under circumstances so adverse as those surrounding
this Institution. The Council cannot authorise expenditure be-
yond the means at their disposal, and these so far have been
altogether inadequate to the requirements. Nevertheless, capacious
and well-appointed Metallurgical and Chemical Laboratories have
been erected and rendered available to Students, at a cost of
upwards of �l5OO, their maintenance involving at least �2OO per
annum.
To give some idea of the practical work done at the Labora-
tories of The School, it may be stated that during the years 1875
and 1876
66,403 oz. of Gold ) , . ~ f
bn er cim > were smelted in the furnaces
715 oz. of Silver j
and upwards of 2114 assays and analyses made.
The substances operated on comprised : ?Pyrites, Tailings, Quartz,
Alloys, Copper, Iron, Tin, Lead, Bismuth, Antimony, Nickel and
Silver Ores, Spurious Coin, Limestone, Freestone, Clay, Gold,
Mine Waters, Titanic Ores, Confectionery, Beers, Sugars, &c., &c.
The Pyrites works will form a portion of the Mining School,
and their cost to the present time has been �2OO, as stated in the
Report, page 8. Mr M?Donald, whose proposal for the completion
of the works was mentioned in the Annual Report, has deposited
with the Council the amount promised by him; the present, there-
fore, is a proper occasion to solicit Mining Companies and others
interested in the solution of that most interesting question ?What
is the best method of treating Pyrites?? to give their assistance
promptly, to enable the Council to have these works in full
operation at the earliest possible moment.f
Workshops and costly plant are essentially necessary for the
Students in Mechanical Engineering, and the services of a skilled
instructor must be obtained, for the successful teaching of this
most important branch of Mining Education. To carry out the
scheme as suggested by a late Lecturer at The School, will involve
an expenditure of from �lOOO to �l5OO, even although it may be
feasible to utilise the steam power required for the Pyrites works.
A beginning has been made with the Museums of Geology and
Mineralogy,J but already the want of accommodation, and the

services of a Curator, are making themselves felt Several hun-
dreds of specimens not being classified, and the whole of the avail-
able museum space, being occupied by cases of specimens.
The use of The School of Mines is therefore to be seen in the
objects of its Promoters and government, and the aid of all persons
whose sympathies may have been aroused by the perusal of this
paper, is earnestly and respectfully requested.

March, 1877. Sir,?l have the honour to inform you that Commandeur Giordano, Chief
Mining Engineer of the Kingdom of Italy, who had the pleasure to visit your School about
two years ago, on his return home, in fulfilment of his promise to send some specimens of
minerals to your School has forwarded to me two cases, one containing specimens of
marble, and the other various mineralogical specimens, and instructed me to deliver them
to you on his behalf. These cases are no win my possession at your disposal, and I request
you will have the kindness to favor me with your instructions h ,w to transmit them to
you. Each case has a list of the minerals in English. Commandeur Giordano expresses at
the same time the hope that you will kindly try to forward to his country something
characteristic of Australia in the way of friendly exchange, and of which I offer myself to
be the means of conveyance. I have, <fec., Le Marin uccj, Consul-General for Italy.?

28 th May, 1873.
? I have had great pleasure in visiting The School of Clines,
and in observing the provision made there for technical and
scientific instruction which are so necessary (as I remarked in
my reply to the address presented to me) to enable the workman
to become an artisan, and the artisan to become the manager ot
large and important undertakings.?
Hon. SAMUEL H. BINDON.
19 th June , 1873.
? Inspected The School with the very highest pleasure and
satisfaction.?
His Worship W. G. MURRAY, J.P., Mayor of St. Kilda.
15 th November, 1873.
!t The impression left on my mind by a hurried visit to The
School of Mines is one of admiration at finding that the youth ot
Ballaarat have such thorough means within their reach of becoming
better and scientifically acquainted with this wonderful district,
and also a feeling of regret that circumstances prevent my entering
myself as a Student.?
His Excellency F. A. WELD, Governor of Western Australia.
2C)th January, 1874.
I have inspected this Institution with the greatest pleasure
and interest.?
Sir. C. GAY AN DUFFY, M.L.A,

at Ballaarat, for the first time, and am much struck by its practical
usefulness.?


H. M. ANDREW, M.A., Wesley College, Melbourne.
13 th July , 1874,
? I have been exceedingly pleased with my visit to this
School. The evidences of honest and successful work are striking,
and the systematic arrangement of the appliances for Students
reflects the greatest credit on the officers of the Institution, The
School is a credit to the Colony.?
The Hon. Sir REDMOND BARRY.
23 rd July, 1874.
?On my hurried visit to this School to-day I was much
gratified to see the compact and adequate arrangements for the
Students, and the business-like, practical appearance which the
Laboratory and Metallurgical room presented. I remarked, how-
ever, that the room is much too small for the number of Students
now attending The School, and I am of opinion that efforts should
be made to increase the accommodation.?
The Honorable Sir JULIUS VOGEL, K.C.M.G.
\lth October, 1874.
?It has given me great pleasure to visit this Institution. I
was the first pupil under Dr. Percy in the metallurgical depart-
ment of the School of Mines, Jermyn street, London. Knowing as
I do how nobly that institution has vindicated the hopes of its
founders, the immense good it has done in spreading useful know-
ledge amongst those who' otherwise would have blindly followed
their various pursuits without understanding the meaning of the
very details that by mere routine they acquired, and the great
wealth it has created in giving to its pupils the means of acquiring
wealth in the subsequent pursuit of the occupations of their life, I
feel the greatest pleasure in visiting a young disciple of the parent
institution, destined, I hope, like that to do vast good. I hope
the other Colonies will follow the example set by Victoria through
the energy of the people of Ballaarat.?
JOHN FORREST, F.R.G.S., Western Australia,
'2& th November, 1874.
? Have enjoyed my visit to The School of Mines very much,
and think it a most useful institution. It well deserves, and I


have no doubt it will receive, the support of the colonists of
Victoria.?
DONALD CAMERON, M.A., Brisbane, Queensland.
Special Commissioner Queensland Royal Commission on Education,
10 th December, 1874.
? I have had the opportunity of visiting this School of Mines
and am simply astonished at what it has already achieved, with so
little support and with means so limited,?
JOHN WALTHEW, J.P., Stockport, England.
20 th February , 1875.
?I have well examined this Institution, and with all my heart
I wish it all the success it so richly deserves. It ought to take
deep root and flourish in this scene of mining operations.?
JULIUS von HAAST, Ph.D., F.R.S., E.L.S., F.G.S.
23rd March, 1875.
? Thanks to the officers of the Institution, I have been allowed
to make myself acquainted with its working, and if I may express
an opinion, I must confess that I have been exceedingly pleased
with what I have seen, including a Student from New Zealand;
this last proves that the Institution has already some reputation
outside the Colony. The practical value of such an institution can
only be seen after many years? work, although the excellent mode
of testing the abilities of those in charge of mines must be doing
immediate good.?

opinion it is such an institution as to deseiwe the support of the
Government as a National School.?


JOSEPH C. LAWS and R. E. PEAKE, London.

12 ih January , 187 G.
?Very much pleased with our visit.?
The Right Rev. Dr. THORNTON, Bishop of Ballaarat.
September , 1876.
This my first visit to The School of Mines has sufficed to
convince me of the immense practical value of such an institution.
So far as I am able to form a judgment, The School seems admirably
arranged and organised to the extent of the means at command. I
shall feel a very great interest for the future in watching its
development.?
The Honorable John RAE, Commissioner for Railways, Sydney.
7 th October, 1876.
?From a hurried examination I am much pleased with the
wonderful extent and beauty of the town and surroundings, and
the great privilege to the people of such an excellent institution as
this School of Mines,?
