Merits of the Ancel Mill
CHE principle upon which the “ Ancel ” Mill has been
constructed successfully combines many improvements
and gives results which have been sought for during
many years past by inventors of different varieties of
percussion pulverising machines, and a Mill is now placed
before the public,' for which, amongst other advantages,
the following can be claimed
i. The Ancel Mill will pulverise the hardest gold
quartz, base metal ores, or other materials of
commercial value, no matter how tough and
hard, consequently the Ancel Mill will pulverise
any granular or fibrous material.
2. The Ancel Mill gives a uniform product, either
coarse or a fine impalpable powder, as required
3. The Ancel Mill requires the minium of power for
a given output.
4. The Ancel Mill is very strongly constructed.
and perfectly simple in its mechanism.
5. The Ancel Mill is easily regulated, either while
working or standing still.
6. The Ancel Mill parts are all easily exchangeable,
are interchangeable, and can be replaced in a
very short time.
7. The Ancel Mill occupies very little space.
8. The Ancel Mill can be taken to pieces for easy
transportation.
9. The Ancel Mill Revolving parts being perfectly
balanced, require only a nominal foundation.
10. The Ancel Mill is the Ideal Prospector’s Mill, and
can be moved from place to place.
11. The Ancel Mill does not require a skilled mechanic
to run it.
12. Half-inch mesh and above for any grinding may
be passed through the Mill without grids.

The Australian Mutual Provident Society .
THE site upon which the Society’s palatial Melbourne
Offices stand, at the corner of Collins and William
Streets, has historic associations which are commemorated
in a tablet appearing on the Collins Street front and bear-
ing the following inscription: —‘‘John Batman, Founder of
Melbourne, built on this corner.” It is surely fitting that
the A. M. F. Society, which is the original Life Assurance
Society of Australia, should be connected in this way with
the pioneer of the great City of Melbourne. This Society,
whose name is now so inseparably associated with the
financial history of Australia, had a very modest origin in
Sydney in 1849, the business effected during that year
totalling 45 policies for ,£lO,lOO, with an annual premium
income of ,£361 9s. Bd. The most optimistic of the mem-
ders who listened to the reading of the first annual report
could scarcely have predicted the enormous success of the
Society, or foreseen that it would develop into the largest
mutual Life Office in the British Empire. For comparative
purposes it may be pointed out that in the year just closed
the new policies issued totalled i7>797> with sums assured
of ,£4,863,553, and annual premiums totalling £\ 62,183
17s. 6d.
The Society’s advertisement, appearing on page 48
gives further figures which will no doubt to
readers of this souvenir.

MOTOR GARAGES
The Tarrant Motor Co.’s Garage is situated very
centrally to the city, being by the corner of Collins Street
and Russell street, and within two minutes walk of the
Town Hall. A great variety of cars are to be seen here
and good cars are to be obtained on hire. If a nice after-
noon’s run is wanted, Beaumauris or Mordialloc (by the
Beach Road) 18 miles out of town, can be recommended.
Gisborne 32 miles out, is a good road, but the country for
part of the journey is rather flat and uninteresting. Past
Gisborne, however, to Woodend (43 miles) the country is
timbered and the outlook enticing.
A picturesque run is out through Heidelberg to
Greensborbugh and on to Eltham, where the main road from
Christmas Hills to Melbourne is met. Healesville, 41 miles
from Melbourne, is a run that wants to be taken comfortably
in about 2% to hours, the road in parts necessitating
very slow driving. The Black Spur about 15 miles further
on affords picturesque scenery and a stiff climb.
ELECTRIC TRAMS.
Full service from St. Kilda Railway Station to Brighton
Beach, connecting with trains ; to Keilor Road via Moonee
Ponds and Flemington Bridge, connecting with North
Melbourne Cable Trams.
Exceedingly pleasant and health-giving are these ex-
cursions, with a minimum of cost.
