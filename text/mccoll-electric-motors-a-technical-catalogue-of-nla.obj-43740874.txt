INTRODUCTION
sTJHORTLY after the termination of the first World War of 1914-18,
\ and in the period of turmoil which followed it, an enterprising group
of men established what is to-day the McColl Electric Works Proprietary
Limited. Against strenuous competition from imported and locally manu-
factured electric machines they built an Australian organisation which has
been tested in times of national stress and found able to bear its fair
burden of the country’s liabilities. Sound principles of engineering and
organisation always have been the basis for the direction of the Company
and now the soundness of its direction is shown in the quality and quan-
tity of the products manufactured for use by the defence services, and by
industries serving in their turn the National defence. It is because of
the wide use being made of McColl electric motors and the necessity for
quick reference by hard pressed men in industry to-day, that a seriously
depleted staff has turned to the formulation of this technical catalogue.
The first McColl Three Phase Electric Motor was marketed in 1922.
Since then the range of types has been expanded continually, McColl
pioneering the production of split phase and repulsion induction type
motors in this country, this step following closely the production of three
phase machines. McColl repulsion induction motors, a difficult type to
produce commercially, have given good lasting service on pumps, refriger-
ators and many other appliances essential in the national service, but in
1934-35 experimental work on capacitor start motors led to the satisfactory
development of production of this type to replace the Repulsion Induction
Motor in many fields. With these types McColl materially assisted the
countryman in the development of his lands and their products.
Alongside of this growth of output in purely alternating current
equipment McColl developed a range of miniature motors, a range in-
cluding drink mixer motors, typewriter motors, grinder motors and even
a twentieth horsepower three phase unit. Coincidental with this a study
of direct current motors brought further evidence of the enterprise of
McColl engineers and now the organisation is justly proud of the extent
to which it supplies the requirements of the Department of the Navy for
their own and allied services.


Concentration on the design and manufacture of only rotating elec-
trical machinery has given the McColl organisation an insight into, and
knowledge of, their product not found always in manufacturing today. The
McColl product is carefully designed, its production thoroughly checked
and backed with McColl service. It was the desire to see this essential
and necessary service in all phases maintained as best it can be in the diffi-
cult conditions applying today in industry that brought out the extra effort
required to complete this catalogue.
This technical catalogue has been produced by our staff of competent
engineers for use in the various defence services, departments and muni-
tions plants of the Government, and in industries and services essential to
the war effort. It was our idea that this catalogue would save the valu-
able time of purchasing executives, design and plant engineers, draftsmen
and others concerned with the selection, ordering and use of electric
motors. It does not attempt to cover the full range of types produced by
McColl Electric Works Pty. Ltd. Many special types, geared motors for
example, developed and produced in pre-war years and even to-day being
made from time to time upon individual requests have been omitted from
this volume, though our engineering staff is at your service to handle any
enquiry for special types. Enquiries from other States can be handled
promptly and efficiently by our competent agents in each State. It is
intended only to cover that range of motors included in our present pro-
duction schedules, and therefore all types and sizes of motors listed in this
catalogue can he supplied within reasonable delivery periods depending
on the defence priority allotted.
Ease of reference, consistent with the conservation of paper, has been
striven for throughout so that the engineer can find before him horse-
power, speed, frame sizes and types, dimensions, etc., of each motor type
by laying the book open at the appropriate page. To conserve both man-
power and material in the interests of national defence, a duplication of
printing has been avoided wherever possible, and only information which
we consider essential has been included.

SPECIFICATION
B.E.S.A. SPECIFICATION: Our
motors comply with the British Engi-
neering Standards Association Specifi-
cation Number I 68/ i 936, and the
specification of ‘he Standards Asso-
ciation of Australia.
TEMPERATURE RISE: All open
type motors have a temperature rise
not greater than 40” C. Totally en-
closed motors not greater than 50°C.
McColl motors up to and including 10 H.P. are suitable for direct on line storting where the supply
authorities permit.
In Victoria, consumers having a number of motors installed are allowed to switch directly on the line
motors having H.P. outputs up to one-tenth of the total H.P. load installed.
[Specification 3 Phase, AC/43]


REVERSING: The d irection of rotation of three phase motors can be reversed by inter-changing the leads
to any two of the terminals.
PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
EFFICIENCIES range from 75% to 90% at full load.
POWER FACTORS range from 70% to 88% at full load.
GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
Only the best of materials are used in the con-
struction, and the design gives an ample reserve of
power. Mechanically and electrically they are a
sound engineering job, designed to give long and
continuous service, freedom from breakdown and
trouble, and economy in operation.
STATOR FRAME AND CORE: The stator body or
housing is of cast iron with the feet integral parts.
It is accurately machined at both ends to take the
end bells, and bored internally to receive the stator
core.
This core consists of thin laminations of special
electrical steel, which have been stamped out by dies,
and are stacked into the body and rigidly keyed and
welded thereto.
ROTOR: The rotor consists of thin special steel
laminations, which are keyed and rivetted to the
shaft.
In the case of squirrel cage rotors, the rotor
conductors consist of bars of high conductivity copper
brazed to copper end rings, and are practically in-
destructible. It is possible to remove squirrel cage
rotors from the shafts without damaging the rotors.
Rotors are accurately balanced statically and
dynamically where specially requested.
SHAFTS: A tough mild steel of ample strength to
withstand the full continuous load and specified over-
loads is used. The bearing, pulley and rotor sections
are accurately ground to size on modern grinding
machines. For special heavy services, shafts con-
structed of high tensile steel can be fitted.
END BELLS: These ore made of cast iron, and
the body register and bearing housings are accurately
machined at the one "set up", ensuring the accurate
centring of the rotor in the body.
BEARINGS: Ball bearings of ample size are used.
Sleeve bearings can be fitted, but they are non-
standard and subject to special quotation.
LUBRICATION: Special grease holes are provided
on the bearing housings for quickly and conveniently
adding grease to the bearings. These holes are closed
by metal plugs which have to be unscrewed before
greasing can be carried out.
Special grease tubes are supplied, and these tubes
are screwed into the holes provided and grease
squeezed into the bearings as per the illustration.
The bearing housings are filled with the correct
amount of grease when they leave our factory, and
although in many cases they will run for very long
periods without the addition of extra grease, we main-
tain that some quick and efficient method should be
provided so that grease can be added when required.
For best results we advise the addition of a little
grease every 1 000 running hours.
[Specification 3 Phase AC/43]

WINDINGS AND INSULATION; Stator windings
consist of coils of cotton and enamel covered high
conductivity copper wire, former wound in groups, re-
sulting in o minimum number of joints.
Only the best insulation is used, and the coils
ore held firmly in the slots by fibre packing pieces,
and the insulation is subjected to high voltage tests
as specified in B.E.S.A, Specification and Australian
Standards Specification.
The windings are impregnated with varnish and
thoroughly dried out in an electric baking oven.
In the case of slip ring motors, the rotor windings
are held rigidly in position by steel binding wire.
PULLEYS; Cost iron pulleys are supplied accur-
ately machined and balanced.
SLIDE RAILS: For smaller sizes rolled mild steel
box sections are used; and machined cast iron rails
for larger sizes. Belt tightening gear and holding
down bolts are provided.
For frame ratings and dimensions of squirrel cage
induction motors, refer to pages 8 and 9. Dimen-
sions and ratings of slip ring motors will be supplied
on application.
INTERCHANGEABILITY: All parts are accurately
machined and rigidly checked, ensuring complete in-
terchangeability and the consequent quick and simple
replacement of broken parts.
TESTS: EVERT McCOLL motor is tested for
torque, current, etc., before it leaves our works, and
it must conform to a rigid test specification. Many
manufacturers test only a small percentage of a batch
of motors, but we believe every motor should undergo
a thorough test.
GUARANTEE: McColl motors are guaranteed
against failure due to faulty materials or defective
workmanship for TWELVE calendar months from the
date of despatch from our store.
STANDARD TYPES
PROTECTED: Holes ore provided in the end bells for
ventilation.
DRIP PROOF: Ventilat ion holes are arranged in the
bottom of the motor, and no dripping water can
enter the motor.
TOTALLY ENCLOSED: No ventilation holes are pro-
vided in the motor end bells or bodies. Thus
the windings are completely protected from grit,
moisture, ocid fumes, etc., which may be in the
surrounding atmosphere.
FAN COOLED: Windings are totally enclosed and a
fan fitted to the end of the motor shaft draws
cooling air over the body.

DIMENSION TABLE OF ALTERNATING CURRENT SQUIRREL CAGE INDUCTION MOTORS


McCOLL Single Phase SQUIRREL
CAGE INDUCTION MOTORS
SPLIT PHASE AND CAPACITOR TYPES
GENERAL
SPECIFICATION
These motors are designed to conform to British
Engineering Standards Association Specification for
Fractional Horsepower Motors No. 170-1939, and the
specification of the Standards Association of Aus-
tralia; temperature rises on continuous operation on
full load are therefore below the limits set in these
specifications, ensuring ample overload capacity.
1/3 H.P. Single Phase Split Phase Motor
ST ARTI NG CHARACTERISTICS IMPORTANT
SPLIT PHASE TYPE MOTORS. An inherent
characteristic of these motors is lower starting torques
and higher starting currents than other types of single
phase motors.
Storting Torques.—Approximately 1203 c, to
180% of full load torque.
Storting Currents.—Approximately six times
full load current momentarily.
To make these motors self-storting, the stators
are wound with two distinct windings having a phase
displacement —a heavy running winding and a light
starting winding which is only in the circuit at start-
ing. As this latter winding is light and carries a
heavy current at starting, it can be readily "burnt
out" if the starting load is too great and prevents the
motor from rapidly attaining full speed. Therefore
care must be exercised before selecting this type of
motor for various drives, as they are not suitable for
drives which exert a heavy load at starting, e.g., com-
pressors. Main applications are for driving fans,
mixers, etc., which have very light storting loads.
CAPACITOR TYPE MOTORS.- In orde r to over-
come the disadvantage of low starting torque in Split
Phase Motors, Capacitor Type Motors ore used. These
motors have included in the starting winding circuit
o condenser, which reduces the storting current and
considerably increases the starting torque.
Starting Torques..—Approximately 280% to
330% of full load torques.
Starting Currents. —Approximately 3 to 4
times full load currents momentarily.
[Specification No. SRC.43]


GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
The general construction of these motors is very
similar to the details given for Three Phase Squirrel
Cage Motors on pages 5-7, but certain important
additional features are necessary.
CENTRIFUGAL AUTOMATIC STARTING
SWITCH OR CUT-OUT: In order to open circuit the
starting winding when the motor is running at normal
speed, some type of centrifugal automatic switch is
necessary. As this switch operates many times dur-
ing the life of the motor, the design has a very im-
portant influence on the satisfactory operation or
otherwise. Great attention has therefore been paid
to the design of the centrifugal cut-out switch used in
McColl Single Phase Motors. The McColl cut-out
switch is robust and simple in operation and large
contacts are provided. This cut-out has been
thoroughly tested under actual operating conditions
over the last 12 years, and has given very satisfactory
service. An important feature is that replacement
parts can be supplied and readily fitted.
CONDENSERS: F irst quality condensers are used
with Capacitor Motors, and each condenser is
thoroughly tested before fitting. The condensers are
housed in stout metal containers, which also hold the
terminals, and a diagram of connections is glued to
the lid.
BEARINGS: Both Split Phase and Capacitor Type
Motors can be fitted with either ball or sleeve bear-
ings; sleeve bearings usually being used where quiet
operation is required.
SPE CIA L PIVO T MOU NTING CAPACITOR
TYPE MOTORS
McColl engineers hove specially designed a patent
rubber-mounted pivot base, which is ideally suited for
refrigerator compressor drives, as the rubber mount-
ing damps vibration, and consequently noise, and also
provides the tension on the driving belts.
The rubber is bonded to steel sleeves, which are
fitted to the body of the motor, and the pressed metal
base and belt tension is readily adjusted by releasing
one nut, as shown on the illustration, and moving the
body of the motor about its pivot.
MAIN APPLICATIONS
SPLIT PHASE TYPE.—For driving fans, small
bench drills, small lathes, grinders, tool post grinders,
small tapping machines, mixers, calculating machines.
CAPACITOR TYPE. For driving compressors,
worm gear reductions, pumps, floor polishers, band
saws.
Horsepower ratings and dimensions for present
manufacturing range are given on pages 12 and 13.

McCOLL Single Phase REPULSION
INDUCTION MOTORS
REPULSION INDUCTION
TYPE MOTORS are used on
drives having heavy starting
loads, and for single phase
operation at horsepowers higher
than the range covered by Split
Phase or Capacitor Type Motors.
¾ H.P. Single Phase Repulsion Induction Type Motor
GENERAL SPECIFICATION
These motors are designed to conform to British
Engineering Standard Association Specification for
Fractional Horsepower Motors No. 170-1939, and
the Specification of the Standards Association of Aus-
tralia; temperature rises on continuous operation on
full load are therefore below the limits set in these
specifications, ensuring ample overload capacity.
STARTING CHARACTERISTICS
Starting torques for this type of motor are very
good, and slightly higher than Capacitor Type Motors,
and starting currents are low.
Starting Torques. —Approximately 430% to
480% of full load torques.
Storting Currents.- Approximately 3 times
full load currents.
For self-starting these motors have a wound rotor,
with rotor windings connected to a commutator, and
brushes bear on this commutator at starting, short-
circuiting certain coils ond causing the motor to start
as a repulsion type. When the motor reaches normal
speed, all the commutator bars are short-circuited by
a short-circuiting necklace, and it is then running os
a Squirrel Cage Induction Type.
[Specification No. RI/43]


GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
Great attention to detail in design and care in
manufacture are required for the successful produc-
tion of these motors, as, although manufacture of
such parts os frames, end-shields, shafts, laminations,
etc., is similar to the description given for Three
Phase Motors on pages 5-7, these motors have a
number of extra special features, as follows:
COMMUTATORS: Vertical type commutators are
used, carefully assembled with copper and mica seg-
ments, which are punched out on presses to ensure
uniformity of outline. Copper segments ore punched
from special commutator section drawn to correct size,
and insulating micas are punched from first quality
mica sheet. The commutator bars and mica segments
are bakelite moulded to a bronze mounting sleeve.
Each commutator is subjected to a thorough insula-
tion test between bars and to earth.
BRUSH GEAR: Die -cast brush-holders accurately
machined are used, and brushes are of ample size
and made from first-grade carbon.
Typical Rotor —Repulsion Induction Motor
SHORT-CIRCUITING NECKLACE AND NECK-
LACE COLLAR: The short-c ircuiting necklace is as-
sembled from copper sections, stamped from hard-
drawn copper strip, and operates on a necklace collar,
THROW-OUT WEIGHTS AND PUSH RODS: Cast
iron weights pivoted on the motor shaft throw out as
the motor "runs up" to normal speed and through
push rods push the brushes off the commutator and
the short-circuiting necklace along to short-circuit
the commutator bars.
WOUND ROTORS: Rotor laminations are punched
from medium resistance electric motor steel, and are
stacked on to the shafts and held in position by stack-
ing washers, which are riveted to the shafts.
[Specification No. R.1./43]


Rotor coils are formed using single cotton enamel
wire. Adequate slot insulation is placed in the slots
of the rotor laminations, and then the coils are care-
fully fitted and wedged in position, leads being sol-
dered to the commutator. The rotor is then thoroughly
impregnated with insulating varnish and baked.
BEARINGS; Sleeve bearings are fitted in standard
motors, but ball bearings can be supplied at an extra
price if specially required.
MAIN APPLICATIONS
AlI types of drives, but specially suited for driving
refrigerator compressors, milking plants, air com-
pressors, etc.
McCOLL Single Phase VARIABLE
SPEED REPULSION MOTORS
GENERAL
SPECIFICATIONS
These motors are designed to conform to British
Engineering Standard Association Specification for
Fractional Horsepower Motors No. 170-1939, and
the Specification of the Standards Association of Aus-
tralia; temperature rises on continuous operation on
full load are therefore below the limits set in these
specifications, ensuring ample overload capacity.
The demand for a Single Phase Motor in which
the speed can be varied led to the design of the
McColl Repulsion Type Variable Speed Motor. These
motors are, in general, similar in construction to Re-
pulsion Induction Type Motors, except that the com -

mutator is horizontal, not vertical, and short-circuiting
necklace and throw-out gear are not required. Brushes
are in permanent contact with the commutator, and
speed variation Is obtained by altering the position
of these brushes on the commutator by means of an
external handle,
[Specification No. V.R.43]


SPECIAL FEATURES OF CONSTRUCTION
Commutators
Commutators are specially designed for this type
of motor and are of the horizontal type. Copper
and mica segments are firmly held together by steel
sleeves and mica insulating cones, and the insula-
tion between bars and to the steel sleeve is carefully
tested at high voltage after assembly.
Brush Gear
Brush rockers are accurately machined from bronze
castings and move on a sleeve which projects from
the commutator end shield. Brush holders are
machined from die castings and adjustable brush
springs are provided. Brushes are of large size and
ore manufactured from a grade of carbon specially
selected for this work. The brush gear is held firmly
in position at any point over the range of movement
by a strong spring which bears against the com-
mutator end shield.
MOTOR APPLICATIONS
When considering the choice of this type of motor
for a particular drive, the following important points
must be kept in mind:—
(a) Horse-power Rating.
The horsepower rating given is at the top speed
of the range, e.g.' a 1 H.P. 500 r.p.m. to 3000 r.p.m.
variable speed motor develops 1 H.P. at 3000 r.p.m.,
and lower horsepowers proportional to speeds at lower
speeds.
(b) Speed Characteristics.
The speed at any one setting of the brushes is
proportional to the load, and therefore it is essential
that the load be accurately determined if possible in
order to closely fix the required horsepower of the
motor. If too high a horsepower motor is selected,
then it will not be possible to obtain the full range
of speed variation specified, e.g., if a speed range of
500 r.p.m. to 3000 r.p.m. is required and a 1 H.P.
motor is specified, whereas the actual load at 3000
r.p.m. is i H.P., then it will not be possible to obtain
a speed, say, lower than 1200 r.p.m. with the brushes
in the low speed position.
(c) Period of Operation.
It must be remembered that Alternating Current
Commutator Motors have inherently poor commuta-
tion characteristics, and consequently sparking occurs
between the brushes ond the commutator, causing
wear to both, and therefore this type of motor is
generally not considered suitable for continuous
operation, except in cases where users are prepared
to give regular attention to the commutators and re-
place brushes from time to time. Usual application
of these motors are on drives requiring intermittent
operation, e.g., testing equipment.
(d) Main Applications
For use on test benches for checking armatures
from automobile and aeroplane generators and motors,
for driving equipment used in checking fabrics.
McColl Variable Speed Repulsion Motors have been
used with excellent results on both the above appli-
cations, and a large number of motors have given
very satisfactory operation over some years.

McCOLL Fan Body Type MOTORS
In order to meet the demand of ventilating en-
gineers for an electric motor which can be mounted
in the centre of ventilating ducts, and have the fan
directly mounted on the motor shaft, the McColl Fan
Body Type Squirrel Cage Induction Motor was de-
veloped.
Single Phase, Split Phase and Three Phase Squirrel
Cage induction and Direct Current Types, are manu-
factured and conform generally to the specification
and details of construction given for these types on
pages 10, 11, 5-7, 28 and 29 respectively.
Special features of these motors are that they
have a round body on which are three or four mount-
ing pads in which mounting holes are drilled and
tapped and the shafts are screwed at the end, and
a nut and locking washer are supplied for holding
and locking the fan in position.

McCOLL Round Body Flange
Mounting Type MOTORS
Geared Motor Unit illustrating Typical Application of
Round Body Flange Mounting Type Motor
In the range of squirrel cage induction motors
McColl have designed a round body flange mounting
type, built with the same care and precision and
to the same specification as McColl standard Squirrel
Cage Induction Type Motors, general features of
which are described on pages 5, 6, 7.
Flange end shields have been designed with ample
strength to carry the weight and torque of the motor,
and have a machined register and holes drilled for
mounting to the driven machine.
This type of motor has been developed where
compact and direct drives are required and their
use in many cases avoids complicated belt drives or
bed plate mounting with flexible coupling.
General applications are for driving machine
tools, washing machines, pumps, fan runners, etc.,
and for use in self-contained geared motor units as
illustrated. These motors are designed for satis-
factory operation with the spindle in either a hori-
zontal or vertical position, although it is necessary
to indicate when purchasing whether a horizontal or
vertical mounting is required.
A table of frame sizes corresponding to horse
powers and speeds covering the standard range of
these motors manufactured at present appears below
and dimensions of these standard machines are shown
on the opposite page.
NOTE: Frames 3524, 4230, 5060 hove the same external dimensions as frames 3520, 4221 and 5030
respectively.

McCOLL Round Body End
Mounting Type MOTORS
McColl End Bell Mount Motors are made in Single
Phase Split Phase, Direct Current and Three Phase
Types. With general robust construction as for stan-
dard motors, described on pages 10, 28 and 5 res-
pectively, these motors carry a specially machined
register and mounting holes, drilled and tapped on
one end bell.
All motors in the full range from i H.P. to 6 H.P.
are suitable for vertical mounting. The plain round
body and the end bell mount are valuable in arrang-
ing a compact drive on machine tools, and in direct
drives for blowers, fan runners, mixing machines, etc.
A table of frame sizes corresponding to horse-
powers for our standard range appears below, and
dimensions of the motors appear opposite.

McCOLL Miniature MOTORS
Prior to the concentration of our effort on pro-
duction essential to the war effort, a considerable
range of types of small output motors, classified by
us as Miniature Motors, was manufactured. Included
in these were series wound motors for darning mach-
ines, drinkmixers, hair-dryer units, typewriters, arc
lamp controls and multifarious duties. Shaded Po'e
Fan Motors in two sizes were produced and met with
success in small domestic and commercial heating
and ventilating units. Direct Current Motors and
Converters also were supplied in quantities.
Now, however, concentration is given to produc-
tion of a bigger type series wound motor for tool
post grinders and mainly to production of Squirrel
Cage Induction Motors in our Frame Number 2412,
Series Wound Miniature Motor
sketches and dimensions of which appear opposite
on page 27. Into this frame we build: —
Following the some general principles of con-
struction in stator and rotor stampings, stacking and
winding as the Squirrel Cage Motors described on
pages 5-7; the frame nevertheless is a lighter rolled
steel body construction, giving a robust yet light-
weight motor suited particularly to such work as
tool and cutter grinders, watchmakers' lathes, small
ether pumps and other work demanding an induction
motor of small output in o confined space. With a
separate casting for the feet the motor can be
adapted for use in many places where a small com-
pact unit is desired. In the Single Phase Units the
starting switch used is similar in construction to that
described on page 11, so that reliability of service
characterises all types in this frame.

McColl Direct Current Motors are now being
manufactured from 1 /25 H.P. up to 6 H.P. at various
speeds and for operation on various voltages. Over
the past five years a large proportion of our output
of Direct Current Motors has been supplied to the De-
partment of the Navy for incorporation in Naval

for all Direct Current machines.
end of the alternator end shield, the armature being
carried on an extension of the main alternator shaft
is included in our manufacturing range.
Motor generator sets mounted on channel iron
bed plates are also manufactured.
[Specification No. DC.43]


GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
The same careful procedure for machining and
checking of parts is carried out as for our standard
Alternating Current Motors, but there are certain
fundamental differences in construction.
MOTOR BODY: The body is constructed by roll-
ing and welding mild steel plate to the diameter re-
quired, a process which ensures a uniformity in the
magnetic yokes. Feet and terminal boxes are welded
to these bodies, and then after annealing the frames
are turned and drilled on our precision machine tools.
END SHIELDS: Cast iron or cast steel (for Naval
work) end shields are used. Commutator end shields
are carefully designed to give the maximum possible
openings for ease of access to the brushes and brush
gear.
FIELD SYSTEM: Pole pieces are built up from
laminations punched from steel sheet, and interpoles
are fitted where necessary to ensure satisfactory com-
mutation. Field coils are former wound, using double
cotton covered, single cotton enamel or enamel wind-
ing wires. Ample insulation is provided, and the
coils are carefully impregnated with insulating varnish
and baked.
ARMATURE:
Shafts are machined from first quality mild steel,
and bearing, pulley and core sections are accurately
ground to size.
Armature Core consists of laminations stamped
from medium resistance electric motor steel, stacked
and keyed to the shaft. Cast iron coil supports act
also as supports for end laminations.
Commutators are assembled using segments cut
from hard drawn copper section and insulating seg-
ments of mica; segments are held together by steel
commutator sleeves, mica cones being used for insu-
lation. Insulation resistance between bars and to
earth is carefully checked.
Armature Coils are former wound, using double
cotton covered or single cotton enamel winding wires.
Ample slot insulation of first quality insulating mate-
rials is used, and the armature coils, after being con-
nected to the commutator, are securely banded in
position, using twine and steel banding wire. Arma-
tures are vacuum impregnated with varnish and then
baked, and great care is paid to this process, ensuring
freedom from breakdown in armature insulation in
service.
BRUSH GEAR: Brush rockers are accurately
machined bronze castings and brush-holders are
bronze die castings, great care being taken in finish-
ing where brushes are held in the holder. Adjust-
able spring tension is provided for altering pressure of
the brushes on the commutator. Particular attention
is paid to the selection of brushes suitable for the
varied types of machines and work required, and
brushes are of ample size to carry full and overload
currents. Only first grade carbons are used in the
manufacture of brushes.
BALL BEARINGS are fitted on standard machines,
and sizes are selected which have a high safety fac-
tor for the loads to be carried. Lubrication is carried
out in the same manner as described for standard
aiternating current motors.
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
Owing to the variety of applications of Direct
Current machines, ond wide requirements in regard
to voltages and speeds, we only list a few standard
horse powers and speeds for standard voltage of 230,
but we welcome your enquiry for motors or generators
not covered by our standard list, and our design engi-
neers can design machines to suit your special re-
quirements within the capacity of our existing frame
sizes.
TYPES: In addition to the standard open pro-
tected machines, other types, namely, totally enclosed,
drip proof, end mounting and fan mounting can be
supplied.

SPECIAL TYPES OF McCOLL MACHINES
STATORS AND ROTORS
Where clients desire to build the electrical power
unit integral with their machines, wound stators and
rotors only can be supplied. As the stator is stacked
from standard laminations, the diameter of a unit
is controlled with the minimum diameter of the stator
that of the laminations used or that of the lamina-
tions with a thin steel plate welded round them, de-
pending on the type of machine required. The
maximum power available from any diameter is con-
trolled by the maximum stacked length of stator
which can be wound. Equipment for which stators
and rotors have been supplied include wood-working
machines. Sudds pumps, surface grinders, tool 'post
grinders, pumps, etc.
MULTI-SPEED MOTORS
McColl manufacture squirrel cage induction type
motors which have been specially wound for 2, 3
or 4 speeds, although the main demand is for two
speed motors. In considering the use of this type of
motor, it must be remembered that the horsepower
at the slowest speed will invariably fix the frame
size, and therefore when ordering it is necessary to
advise the horsepowers required at all speeds. Motors
of this type are particularly useful for machine tool
drives.
SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS
Also manufactured are 1/60 H.P., i H.P. and i
H.P. 4-pole self-starting synchronous motors. These
motors run at a constant speed depending on the
frequency of the supply, and have wide applications
for timing mechanisms, large clocks, recording and
reproducing turntables, etc.
FREQUENCY CHANGERS
McColl Electric Works have also specially designed
a range of frequency changers from 21 KVA up to
25 KVA at various frequencies. These sets consist
of a squirrel cage driving motor and the frequency
changer direct coupled and mounted on the one bed
plate, forming a compact unit. The main applica-
tions are for providing high frequency supply for
operating small hand tools, wood-working machinery,
high frequency heating ovens, etc.

Information to be given with an Enquiry for
Quotation and Order for Electric Motors
In order to assist prospective purchasers and users in
making their enquiry for quotation and placing orders for
electric motors we have scheduled below essential informa-
tion required with your enquiry and order —
TYPE OF SUPPLY may be either Direct Current (D.C.)
or Alternating Current (A.C.). The main electric
power supply in Australia is Alternating Current.
2. SUPPLY VOLTAGE.— The usual Alternating Current
power supply is 230/240 volts Single Phase, or 400/
415 volts Three Phase.
3. PHASE AND FREQUENCY (for Alternating Current
supply).—Wherever possible it is desirable to use
Three Phase power supply as Three Phase electric
motors are much simpler in construction and more
reliable in service than Single Phase. The usual
frequency of supply in Australia is 50 cycles per
second, but in some parts of Western Australia the
frequency is 40 cycles per second.
4. HORSEPOWER. —lf the purchaser has difficulty in
ascertaining the horsepower required we, or our
agents, will do everything possible to assist him in
obtaining the correct horsepower for his work. Owing
to the necessity of conserving raw, materials wherever
possible in the interest of the national war effort,
machines should not be considerably overpowered,
and therefore motors of horsepower outputs as close
as possible to the actual power required should be
selected.


5. SPEED IN REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE.— Here it
must be remembered that Alternating Current
Squirrel Cage Induction Motors have certain fixed
speeds depending on the number of poles and the
frequency of the supply, and that it is not possible
to obtain intermediate speeds with this type of motor.
6. TYPE OF ENCLOSURE. —For electric motors operating
under cover in normal conditions, open protected
type are usually specified, but if atmospheric con-
ditions are moist or very dusty, totally enclosed
motors are required. If the purchaser is in doubt
as to the type of enclosure it is desirable to supply
full information of the conditions under which the
motor will be operating.
7. RATING. —Unless otherwise specified, it is assumed
that continuously rated motors are required. There-
fore for applications which do not require continu-
ously rated machines, full details of the type of drive
and the period of operation of the motor on load
should be indicated.
8. DIRECTION OF ROTATION. —Specify the direction
of rotation either clockwise or anti-clockwise looking
at the shaft end of the motor.
9. POSITION OF THE MOTOR. —Unless otherwise stated
it is usually assumed that the shaft of the motor will
be operating in a horizontal position, and it will
therefore be necessary to indicate if any other
position of operation is required.
10. STYLE NUMBER . —Where replacements or duplicates
of existing McColl Electric Motors are required, if
the style number, which is stamped on the name
plate is quoted, we will know exactly the type of motor
required.
Considerable time and many telephone calls and letters
will be saved if as much as possible of the above information
can be supplied with your enquiry or order, and therefore
particularly at this time, when all staffs are working short
handed, we would ask for your assistance and co-operation in
this matter.
