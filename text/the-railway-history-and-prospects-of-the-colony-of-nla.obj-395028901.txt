THE RAILWAY HISTORY AND PROSPECTS
OP THE
COLONY OF QUEENSLAND
“Prove all things; hold fast that which is good”
In these days of political apathy railways
-seem likely to occupy the largest share of what
public attention will be given to public sub-
jects. It has been apparently convenient to
raise a cry for large public works as tending
to bring population and promote settlement.
There was something of the same kind set in
motion seven years ago, but the projects were
less ambitious in extent, and the moving spirits
being then ministers of the Crown it was not
found difficult to hurry immature plans into
an unexpectedly costly and deceptive opera-
tion. How little was understood upon the
subj ct, and what slight importance was at-
tached at the time to the acquirement of the
linformation necessary for understanding it,
will by-and-bye be apparent. And the exposi-
tion cannot be valueless, even if it does
no more than teach the propriety of careful
enquiry before hurrying the colony into in-
creased debt or wasteful appropriation of terri-
tory. In 1863, mere assertion was taken as
proof by the dominant party while the oppo-
sition to the railway projects was too often
petty in its scope and uncertain in its guidauce.
The subject was a troublesome one, and the
industry required to watch the singular incon-
sistencies which betrayed themselves at every
advance of the scheme was early wanting.
Time has shown how much was lost by the
haste with which the then plans were pushed
forward, and how baseless were the calculations
relied upon. Retrospection is never useless:
and, even to the gentleman who took so promi-
nent a part in initiating our railways and who
propounded the magnificent suggestions an-
nounced a few days ago, may be of service in
reminding him that caution is sometimes of
value, and that the weight of authority is not
always in exact proportion to the dogmatism
with which an opinion is laid down.
In a narrative of this kind there is, of course,
no small difficulty. Contemporary history is
always held to be dangerous. “ A man,” says
ancient Fuller, “may hold a candle to lighten
posterity so near as to burn his fingers there-
with.’’ And the whole of our railway history
is so clothed and wrapped in assertion and
counter assertion, misstatement, contradiction,
and inconsistency, that it is not possible to
get in every instance to a satisfactory solution
of the questions presented. The absence from
the colony of the engineer principally affected
does not lessen the complexity. There were
many accusations against him, to which he
might possibly have replied and did not reply,
and there are not a few apparent discrepancies
in his published reports, of which he alone
could furnish an explanation. It does not
seem fair to one not at hand to defend himself
to bring forward matters affecting his truth or
his competency, unless absolutely indispen-
sable to the connection and understanding of
the subject; and thus much that might even
legitimately be considered to concern the main
discussion it would appear proper to leave un-
touched. The professional technicalities which
assumed so prominent a place in the disputes
which have been waged from time to time in
Parliament and out of it are of a kind which
to unprofessional minds convey very little in-
formation, and yet are so interwoven with the
subject that it is not easy to avoid them.
Under these circumstances .it seems desirable


to indicate at once the course proposed for “ gibbon. It -would appear that Mr. Tooth
adoption here, and the reader will thus ho “ contemplated, either through himself or a
snared unnecessary expectation, and, it is "company, introducing the project of con-
. “ , .11 • 1 1 • • 1... «« nlimAlino> o lino nf roilnraW frt fnft DflrlinO l '
hoped, will avoid disappointment.
The history of the existing railways is one
of fact. The incidents can nearly all be
gathered from the parliamentary documents of
the time supposing the dispute as to the cir-
cumstances of Mr. Fitzgibbon’s original ap-
pearance in the colonies—his imputed business
connection with Sir Charles Fox —and the
technicalities as to the three feet six guage—
to be as far as possible avoided. By taking
the votes and proceedings of parliament, the
pages of Hansard, and the official registers
and reports as our guides, there will be at once
authority given for, and a check afforded upon,
every statement. The great mass of private
abuse, reflection, and recrimination which
marked almost every stage of the railway
progress will thus be shut out, and, indeed, in
a grave discussion like this.it would be singu-
larly out of place. What is wanted is the
history as it affects the colony—and no more.
That history will naturally divide itself into
three separate portions :
1. The inception and carrying out of the
railways by the Government of the
day.
2. The working of the contracts and its
result as compared with the expecta-
tions originally held out.
3. The working of the lines, and the ad-
vantages or losses that have followed
from it to the community.
These being completed, the ground will be
clear for considering
1. The prospects of the existing lines.
2. The propriety of any —and of what —
extensions.
Concerning the first procedure in the rail-
way movement there have been many and con-
flicting statements. Probably the most con-
nected of the whole was that made by Mr.
Macalister on the Bth October, 1867, in a
debate in the Assembly on Ways and Means.
And, although it may bo subject to correction
on some points, and on others does not state
all that truth required should have been said,
it is still authoritative as far as it goes. From
that it would seem that Mr. Herbert, Colonial
Secretary in 1863, had returned from a visit to
England with information touching some
alleged cheap lines of railway in Sweden and
in India, and that, therefore, the Government
were desirous of seeing what could be done
here by way of imitation. "At the period I
“ refer to this colony was visited by a gentle-
“ man who had large possessions on the
“ Darling Downs at that time —a gentleman
" well known to members of this house —Mr.
“ Robert Tooth, accompanied by Mr. Fitz-
“ company, introducing the project of con-
“ structing a line of railway to the Darling
"Downs, and the object of the visit on that
•* occasion was to go over the country and
“ report upon it. And here I would observe,
“ Sir, that an impression did prevail in this
“ colony at that time that it was impossible to
“ take a railway across the Main Range, . .
‘•The difficulty we had in approaching the
“ range was being obliged at once to get over
“ it. Some time after this the Government
“were informed that Mr. Tooth had given up
“ his project. What his reason was tor adopt-
ing that course—unless that he found that the
“ expenditure would be too great —I am notin
“ a position to say, but the then Government
“ felt that it was desirable to get from the en-
" gineer who had examined the country, and who
“ had, on his first arrival with Mi. Tooth, satis-
« fied the Government as to his character and
“ professional ability, a report of the country
“over which he had gone. This was done on
“ the understanding and arrangement that the
“ Government relieved Mr. Tooth of the obli-
“ gation he incurred in bringing Mr. Fitz-
“ gibbon from New Zealand. These are the
“facts connected with the introduction of Mr,
“ Fitzgibbon into this colony.”(a) But these
were not all the facts, Mr, Tooth had been
shown the Dun Mountain mining tramway by
Mr. Fitzgibbon, and brought him here to see
if such a line could be carried over the Little
Liverpool range as well as over the Main
Range. Mr. Fitzgibbon, in a letter to that
gentleman, gave an affirmative opinion, and
stated a very low sum—not more (b) than £4OOO
per mile as"the cost. On this letter the then
Government attempted to get the concurrence
of the Assembly to their carrying out some
such system, but. being defeated, resorted to a
dissolution, when a general election in the
winter of 1863 resulted in their securing a
majority pledged to railway views, although,
probably, the greater number had the most
indefinite notions upon the subject. With
respect to the crossing of the Main Range, Mr.
Macalister was, as will by-and-bye be shown,
also somewhat in error. And it does not
appear that Mr. Fitzgibbon made any careful
examination of the country until the arrange-
ment transferring his charges from the shoul-
ders of Mr. Tooth to those of this colony had
been settled. As to his testimonials, the facts
material to this narrative will furnish the best
evidence of the value that really attached to
them, and there that part of the question may
be vt ell left.
(a) Hansard, 2nd Series, Vol. 5, p, 349.
t (b) Writing here from recollection.


The Government lost no time upon the open-
ing of the new Parliament in pushing forward
their railway schemes. The Houses assembled
,on the 21st July. On the 24th Mr. Macalister
gave notice of a Bill to make provision for the
construction by Government of railways, and
lor the regulation of the same, and on the 28th
the Bill was brought in. On the 30th the
same Minister laid on the table of the Assem-
bly a report, dated July 9th, from Mr, Fitz-
gibbon upon the proposed line from Ipswich to
Dalby and to Warwick via Toowoomba. This
report was in itself so remarkable a document
that before proceeding with the narrative
it is desirable to present a synopsis of its
contents.
Mr. Fitzgibbon divided his discussion of the
questions involved into four parts. 1. The
routes of the lines. 2. The mode and cost of
construction. 3. The traffic and working ex-
penses. 4. General observations,
In his first division he claimed to have made
a careful examination of the country, acknow-
ledging the assistance derived from Mr. W.
Haunam, who accompanied him on his ride
over the suggested line, and from whom "I
received considerable information.” For vari-
ous reasons he preferred the route as at present
adopted for approaching the Main Range.
There he could “ see my way to making the
ascent at a moderate outlaybut still he
affirmed that “this portion of the line will
“ require much study and patient investigation
“ in order to decide upon the route which will
“ afford the best gradients and curves with the
“ minimum of works; so that Ido not think it
“ will be possible to have the finished surveys
“ and plans of it completed under twelve
“ months from the time of commencing the
“necessary field work,” The line from Too-
woomba to Dalby he saw no difficulties in, but
on the Warwick route “ a careful and detailed
“examination of the country will have to be
“made in the neighborhood of Warwick, in
“ order to determine the best mode of approach-
ing the town.” Altogether he gave as his
deliberate opinion that “ the necessary surveys
“ and finished plans for the several divisions
“of the proposed railway may be completed
“ within the following periods, provided a suffi-
“ cient number of properly qualified and ex-
perienced engineers accustomed to railway
“ field work can be secured, and enabled to
“ commence and carry out the required opera-
“ tions in a systematic manner, viz., Ipswich
“to the Little Liverpool Range six months;
“Ipswich to Toowoomba twelve months;
“ Ipswich to Dalby eighteen months; Ipswich
“to Warwick eighteen months.” There could
be no doubt in the minds of any one reading
this report and unacquainted with all that had
gone before, that its writer had simply made a
reconnoitreing tour —that he had no surveys
—and that in fact all his work was before him.
It is indispensable to a just conception of the
character of all these proceedings that this
should be carefully borne in mind.
On the mode and cost of construction he
was dogmatic and precise. “ Believing that
“ perhans for the next twenty years only a com-
“ paratively moderate amount of traffic may be
“ looked for,” and that the minimum outlay
should be kept in view, he recommended the
three feet six inch gauge. Thus he would get
10 to 12 ton engines, 30 to 35flbs. rails, and
five chain curves. He had in a previous part
of his report stated that he would get over the
Little Liverpool Range at 1 in 45 or 50, and
that on the Main Range he could avoid steeper
gradients than 1 in 50, and get over it in
fifteen miles. His estimate for these lines is
quoted in his own words.(a)
“Ipswich to Toowoomba, say 69 miles,
“ £617,349 13s. This sum includes £150,000
“ for the ascent of the Main Range, fifteen
“ miles in length, and £BO,OOO for the crossing
“of the Little Liverpool Range, seven miles
“in length, with tunnel at top. The average
“ cost of this division of the lino is therefore
“ £8,951 per mile.
“ Toowoomba to Dalby, say fifty miles,
“ £279,349 11s, giving an average cost per mile
“ in this division of £5,587.
“Toowoomba to Warwick, say fifty-five
“ miles, £329,467 13s. giving an average of
“ £5,990 for this division.
“ These estimates I believe to be liberal and
“ are such as I have no doubt competent con-
“ tractors will be found to undertake the works
“ for.”
And that there should be no misunderstand-
ing him he reiterates, “In submitting my
“ estimates for the consideration of the
“ Government I do so with the full conviction
“ that they will be found ample. And I am
“ further of opinion that they may in all proba-
“ bility be somewhat reduced after a careful sur-
“ vey of the line shall have been made, especi-
“ ally at the Little Liverpool and Main Ranges,
“ I append in detail the items of which the esti-
•* mates upon each division are composed , with
“ the amounts set opposite each.’’ Is it not
singular that the inconsistency of a detailed
estimate before a single part of the survey
had been made—the shortest division of some
twenty-one miles of flat country requiring six
months to take ij competent men could be got
—did not strike the Government? Upon
what sort of basis could a detailed estimate
be formed with no survey to work on ?
When we turn to this detailed estimate we
(a) Votes and Proceedings, second session of 18G3, p,
589, Legislative Assembly of Queensland.


find that it does not include in its items either Douglas thereafter gave notice of some spocu*
the crossing of the Little Liverpool or of the lative resolutions, which, with characteristic
Main Range. Items are given for only the
flatter country between Ipswich and the other
termini, the crossings are set out at lump sums.
The reason for this may be found by-and-bye.
The Warwick extension estimate could have
been only guess work, for there had been
nothing approaching to a survey in the proper
sense of the term in that direction.
The traffic estimates were as extraordinary
as the rest. He had, as we have seen, be-
lieved that only a comparatively moderate
amount was to be looked for when considering
mode and cost of construction, but in this part
of his report he expressed himself as thinking
“ it cannot be doubted that railways will pay
very large returns.” Putting his certainties
into figures he estimated the traffic from Ips-
wich to Dalby at 10,000 tons per annum and
the passengers on that line as 383 per day 1
He did not go into details with respect to the
Warwick extension, but he did this instead —
he affirmed in general terms that “it is to be
“ supposed that a much more favorable return
“ will be obtained from the proposed line from
“ Toowoomba to Warwick” than on that to
Dalby, and this last he assumed as estimated at
“ below what it will be in reality upon the
“ opening of the line in 1868. and very much
“ below what it will be a few years after-
wards.” He finally concluded that the yearly
income on the main line would be £113,000
and the working expenses on the traffic
assumed £60,000, leaving a net profit of
£53,000 to pay about six per cent, upon the
estimated cost of £897,008.
His general observations it is not necessary
to notice: there was nothing new and very
little apposite to the subject in them. How
his calculations have been realized we have
yet to see.
But upon such a report, and on that alone,
the Railway Bill was advocated in the Assem-
bly, and carried through all its stages. On
the motion for its second reading on the 4th
August, an amendment for referring it to a
select Committee, and affirming “ that no
“ works of such magnitude, and involving
“ such a large expenditure should be enter-
•' tained until actual and proper surveys have
“ been made, and the necessary specifications
“ and estimates have been furnished, in accord-
“ ance with the practice of the Imperial
“ Parliament” was debated with great heat and
acrimony. The Assembly sat on till three the
following morning, when the amendment was
rejected by 14 to 11. Those who voted with
the Ministry were Messrs. Royds, Taylor,
Cribb, M’Lean, Groom, Coxen, Ohallinor, Bell,
Sandeman, and Wienholt, some of whom now
see reason to regret their procedure. Mr.
fidgetiness, he afterwards withdrew. When
the Bill came before the Legislative Council
they examined Mr. Fitzgibbon and several
other witnesses —Mr. Gregory and Mr. Plews
amongst them—the former of whom was
against the whole plan. But, instead of
examining the inconsistencies and exaggera-
tions of the report, the Council fell into an
engineering bog, vented their distrust in a
resolution urging the Government not to adopt
the three feet six guage without further
inquiry, and then passed the Bill, which practi-
cally left their resolution inoperative. Such,
at least, seemed to be the opinion of the
Assembly, who, when the propriety of concur-
ring in it came before them, quietly shelved its
consideration by the previous question.
But in the meantime a somewhat odd cir-
cumstance occurred. On the 28th August Mr_
Lilley asked the Government whether they
proposed to adopt Mr. Fitzgibbon’s estimate;
whether they had made any arrangement with
him; and when the plans of the line to the
Little Liverpool would be ready. The answer
was, that the matter was under consideration,
but would not be finally decided until the
Railway Bill had passed ; that no arrangement
with Mr, Fitzgibbon had been made; and that
the plans “in all probability” would be laid on
the table of the House on the following Tues-
day. On that day, the Ist September, they
were.
Here then it is proper to notice the first set,
so to speak, of the many suspicious inconsis-
tencies connected with these railway proceed-
ings. Mr. Fitzgibbon deliberately, and twice
in his written report of the 9th July, affirmed
that he could not get the plans to the Little
Liverpool ready before the expiration of six
months from that date. The 10th clause of
the Railway Bill, introduced nineteen days
afterwards, provided that the plans sections,
and hooks of reference, should be laid before
Parliament on the then next session. Yet Mr.,
Macalister laid those plans on the table of the
House a little more than seven weeks after his
engineer had declared they would not be ready
for six months, and two days before the Bill
finally passed. In the face of this he told the
House that “ until the Railway Bill has become
“ law the Government will make no final deci-
sion as to either adopting Mr. Fitzgibbon’s
“ cost of surveys or engineering superintend-
“ ence,” and “ the Government have not made
“ any arrangement with Mr. Fitzgibbon either
“ one way or another,"(a) i.e., either for survey,,
or superintendence, or employment at all.
How such contradictory statements, and pro-
(a) Votes and Proceedings, 2nd Session, 1863, p. 111.


ceedings utterly in the teeth of them, can be Government.(a) Defective, however, as this
reconciled with truthfulness or straightfor- so-called copy was, it appears from it that
wardness is one of the questions which Mr.
Fitzgibbon might be legitimately asked to
explain. A thoroughly satisfactory solution
is perhaps impossible, but as this narrative
proceeds more than one will probably suggest
itself.
The session of Parliament closed on the
22nd September, a loan of £250,000 having
been authorized for the “ formation of rail-
ways, Ipswich to Little Liverpool including
survey.” Between then and its next meeting a
contract was taken by Messrs. Peto, Brassey,
and Betts, for the construction of the first por-
tion of the line—from Ipswich to the Little
Liverpool Range. The amount, as stated by
Mr. Macalister,(a) was £86.900. When Par-
liament was re-assembled on the 26th April,
1864, the Governor’s speech referring to the
railways, contained the following passage: — ,
“ The construction of our first railway has
“been rapidly proceeded with under circum-
“ stances which will not fail to satisfy you
“ that the system recommended by my respon-
“ sible advisers was well chosen, and that
“there should be no delay in carrying it to
“ the principal centres of traffic in the interior.
“ You will be invited to confer a similar ad-
“ vantage on the northern districts by the con-
“ struction of a railway to connect the town
“ of Rockhampton with the rich pastoral and
“ mining territory that lies to the west-
“ ward."(b )
On the 28th of April copies of the plans
(whether the same as put before the House in
the preceding session does not appear) of the
“proposed line of railway from Ipswich to ihe
Little Liverpool” were laid on the table of the
Assemblj' by Mr. Macalister. On the 10th of
May (the House not having sat during the in-
terim) the further plans of the line from the
termination of that section to Dalby were also
laid upon the table. On the 13th Mr. Mac-
kenzie moved for copies of correspondence
with Sir C. Fox and other engineers on the
subject of light railroads, “ and also copies of
all contracts which have been entered into,
connected with the survey and construction of
the Southern and Western Railway.” With
considerable dexterity Mr. Macalister avoided
the contract part, but professed to lay on the
table the whole of the correspondence.(c) This,
however, he did not, for one letter from Sir
Charles Fox, dated 26th Nov., 1863, is dis-
tinguished by a line of asterisks just when its
details get important, and there is not a single
letter either of Mr. Fitzgibbon’s or of the
( a) Hansard, Vol. 1, first series, p. 67.
(b) Votes and Proceedings, Legislative Assembly, 1864.
(c) Hansard, Vol. 1, first series, p. 50.
on the 18th September, 1863, a letter
was forwarded by Mr. Macalister to Sir
Charles Fox in which that engineer was ap-
pointed agent to the Queensland Government,
(and as it seems from facts which transpired
subsequently without a single stipulation as
to terms) for the purchase and shipment at
home of railway materials. (b) In a subsequent
letter trom Sir Charles Fox he forwards lists
of tenders received and contracts entered into
by him in pursuance of indents forwarded by
Mr. Macalister on the 30th of September,
1863, the sums involved amounted to nearly
£40,000. The indents seem to have been de-
tailed and lengthy.
When, however, we take up Mr. Fitzgib-
hon’s progress report dated 4th April, 1864,
(included in the correspondence) we find this
statement. “ Immediately after the last ses-
sion upon receiving your instructions I made
arrangements for proceeding with the surveys.
. , , . By the end of December the
centre line was set out and the plans, section,
working drawings and specifications for the
first section of twenty one miles in length
from Ipswich to the Little Liverpool Range
were ready. . . . Indents, specifications,
&c., having been sent to Sir O. Fox, 0.E., the
Government agent in London in October and
November last for the necessary rolling stock,
rails, &c., that gentleman immediately sought
for tenders,” &c., &c.
Now, here we are presented with fresh com-
plications. On Sir Charles Fox’s own state-
ment, orders were forwarded to him at least
two days before —according to Mr. Fitzgibbon
(a) It was in the discussion on this motion that Mr.
Macalister said “He thought it right to mention that it
was within the knowledge of the Government that Sir
Charles Fox possessed the highest confidence of the British
Cabinet, and it was through a member of that Cabinet
that the Government had anything to do with him or their
present Engineer-in-Ghief” / / Hansard, Vol. I, p. 50.
Compare this with Mr. Macaiister’s statement of 1867
before cited. A comparison would seem to show that Mr.
Herbert had been aware of some connection between Sir
Charles and Mr. f itzgibbon, or why did the “ member of
the British Cabinet” influence the selection of both. Then
what becomes of Mr. Tooth’s introduction. He was not a
member of any Cabinet. On a subsequent occasion (the
25th May) Mr. Macalister on being pressed for farther in-
formation on the point by a motion for the production of a
copy of the testimonials given to bir C. Eox by a distin-
guished member of the British Cabinet, decared that
motion to be unintelligible ! Did the Queensland Governor
and Cabinet think that their Secretary had let too much
out already and so became obtuse in their perceptions ?
(6) Legislative Assembly, Votes and Proceedings f0r1864,
p. 1188. “I will take every precaution to prevent any
delay in the preparation and shipment of the plant and
will insert penalty clauses in all my specifications. But I
do not think that the Government would be justified in
calculating the rolling stock and engines now ordered to
be prepared can possibly be despatched” &c., &c. Extract
flora Sir C. Fox’s letter 26th November, 1863.


—(he surveys on which those indents could p. 62, et seq.) officially recounted what has
alone have been properly founded were even been before stated—that the contract for
directed, much less commenced. Mr. Macalis-
ter laid plans and sections of twenty one miles
of line on the table of the Assembly on tbe
Ist September, 1863, three weeks before the
termination of the session after whose close
Mr. Fitzgibbon says that he received orders
for their preparation. Mr. Fitzgibbon refers
positively to the fact that indents and specifi-
cations were sent home to Sir 0. Fox in Octo-
ber and November, 1863, for the necessary
rolling-stock, rails, &c.; and Sir Charles Fox,
in November, 1863, writes to say that he has
got those indents, and actually receives tenders
for nearly £40,000 worth of material before—if
Mr. Fitzgibbon’s statements were true —he
could have received the letters of instruction
sent from herei for the November mails would
not at that time have reached home before late
in December or early in January. With all
this before us we have as well Mr. Macalister’s
assurance to Mr. Lilley that no arrangement
had been made or would be made with Mr.
Fitzgibbon until the Railway Bill had passed
—and it did not pass until the 3rd September,
two days after the first set of plans were laid
on the Assembly’s table, and only a fortnight
before orders for nearly £40.000 worth of mate-
rial were sent home. Are we really to believe
that by some unexampled exercise of engi-
neering prescience Mr. Fitzgibbon foresaw
not only that all this stock would be wanted,
but the exact quantity of fencing, switches
and crossings, rails, fishing pieces, bolts, nuts,
spikes, and fangs ; and then, by equally unex-
ampled dexterity, had all his plans and sec-
tions ready before he had, to use his own
words, “made arrangements for proceeding
with the surveys?” Any one who can credit
this will also be able to credit that such an
extraordinary exhibition of generosity was
displayed by him as the performance of all
those miraculous operations without a particle
of arrangement for either present payment or
future employment as a reward. And in this
curious development of engineering clairvoy-
ance was Mr. Macalister victim, accomplice,
or part director, in connexion with the gentle-
man in communication with that distinguished
member of the British Cabinet who appeared
as a shadow, and, as a shadow, left no trace
behind ?
Leaving the reader to answer these ques-
tions as he may determine, we now come to
another portion of the procedure, connected
with this first division of the line. On the
17th May, 1864, Mr. Macalister, in moving the
Assembly for approval of the plans, sections,
and books of reference for the extension of the
line from the Little Liverpool range to Dalby
via Toowoomba ( Hansard , Vol. 1, Series 1,
the first section had been taken by Messrs.
Peto. Brassey, and Betts for £86,900. He left
the House to infer that this sum covered the
cost of all the works included in the plans and
sections (officially described as “the plans,
sections, and books of reference relating to the
proposed line of railway from Ipswich to Little
Liverpool range.”)(a) laid on tbe table on the
28th April. The Assembly might naturally
enough suppose so, because Mr. Fitzgibbon’s
estimates of July, 1863, included bridges and
station buildings, (in all £83,450) and that
engineer, in his report of April, 1864, says :
“ As you are aware, tenders for the construe-
“ tion of the first section of twenty-one miles
“ of this railway were received on the 31st of
“January last. ... I may state that
“ Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts’ tender for
“ the construction of the first section of the
“ line is lower than my approximate estimate
« for the same work.” And to ensure certainty
as to what this first section of that line was,
in his description of it in the same report he
says : “ The line commences at Ipswich. .
“ The Bremer is crossed close to the ferry by a
“ wrought iron girder bridge, in three spans of
“ 150 feet each; the height of the roadway
“ from the bed of the river being about 90
“feet." In the total absence of a single word
to the contrary, would it not be supposed that
this first division, thus described, included the
bridge and station, and that the contract of
Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts included them

But what are the facts ? The contract with
Messrs. Peto and Co. was signed on the 26th
of the preceding February, and that contract
did not include either the bridge over the
Bremer or the Ipswich station. In a Parlia-
mentary paper—Report from the Commissioner
of Railways, dated 16th January, 1868—the
contract for the bridge with Messrs, Peto, is
described as for £12,000, and as dated the 14th
July, 1864, And in another report of Mr.
Fitzgibbon’s, in which he alludes to the great
increase in his estimates, he accounts for one
portion as follows Extension of line to
“ river bank at Ipswich, construction of
“ wharf, Bremer bridge, and approaches and
“ forming and levelling station ground at
" South Ipswich, £35,000.”(c) Hence it would

seem that we are driven to one of two hypo- “be introduced, will, I have no hesitation in
theses, (1) either the plans and section did not “ stating upon the authority of the engineer,
include the station and bridge, and the sum of “ itself pay the interest of the money bor-
£86,900 was stated as covering what it did not
cover —all the works required in the first sec-
tion —or (2) there has never been any real
legislative authority for the construction of
either the bridge or the station indicated, the
plans for them having never been submitted
and approved. Neither hypothesis is in any
way creditable to the engineer or to the
Government of the day, but one of them must
be true. There was either the suggestio falsi
or the suppresio vevi , which, as to the integrity
of the transaction, is scarcely of importance
enough to discuss.
The more the nature of these earlier trans-
actions is investigated, the more puzzling are
the complexities which thicken around the
enquirer. When in the speech on the 17th
May, 1864, before referred to, Mr. Macalister
supposed himself to have sufficiently vindi-
cated Mr. Fitzgibbon and Sir Charles Fox and
the system of railway adopted, he came to the
payment of the former. “ The terms of Mr,
“ Fitzgibbon’s contract for surveys are as fol-
“ lows: —‘ Ipswich to foot of Main Range,
“fifty-four miles, £BO per mile, the incline.
“ without reference to mileage, £3OOO. Too-
“ woomba to Dal by £7O per mile, Toowoomba to
“ Warwick £7O per mile. Engineering super-
“ intendence, Ipswich to Toowoomba £320 per
“mile, Toowoomba to Dal by £2BO per mile,
“ Toowoomba to Warwick £2BO per mile.’ ”
And in the same debate speaking of tenders
for the construction of the line from the Little
Liverpool to Toowoomba, he went on. “ With
“ regard to the contract with Peto and Brassey,
“ I stated that they had taken a contract for
“ making the first section of the line and I will
“ now state what I intended to have mentioned
“ before, that they have sent in a tender for
“ the construction of the whole line from Ips-
“ wich to Toowoomba, and the Government
“having consulted their Engineer-in-Chief
“ upon that offer are, if the House does not
*• dissent from the arrangement, prepared to
“ accept it. It has been found that by accept-
“ ing their tender for the whole line the cost
“ of construction will be within the estimated
“ cost, and with such a firm as that of Peto and
“ Brassey, the Government have full confidence
“that full justice will be done the country.
“. . . The narrow gauge railway, about to
Fitzgibbon the order to prepare the indent or whatever
was required 1 It must have been sent with the first in-
structions if any, The plans were taken up and approved
by the Executive Council but I cannot state the precise

finite shape or avowed amount before parliament until
long afterwards. Was this honest by the Executive to the
Legislature?
“ rowed to construct it.” (Votes and Proceed*
ings, Legislative Assembly, 1866, p. 78.)
It becomes necessary now to refer to Mr.
Fitzgibbon’s report of April, 1864, as to what
the line was for which this satisfactory tender
had been received, and whether the plans and
sections on the table of the Assembly repre-
sented that line or some other.
In that report Mr. Fitzgibbon says, that by
the end of the month he hopes to have “the
“ centre line of the proposed railway pegged
“and marked out as far as Dalby, and the survey
“plans and sections theieof in readiness for
“ submission to Parliament at its approaching
“session”—the session which commenced on
the 26th of the same month, and in which
these plans were submitted. It would appear
then that theie need be no question that they
were the plans and sections referred to in the
report.
Again, he congratulates himself thus; —“7
“ have not had occasion to vary the route of
“ the railway from the line described in my
“ report of July, 1863. ... I am happy
“ to be able to say that the gradients upon the
“ Little Liverpool and Main Ranges as men-
“ tioned above will be much better than those
" calculated upon in my former report referred
“to.” The gradient “ mentioned above” was
thus described: —“ The average rise will be
“ about seventy feet per mile, or one foot
“in seventy-five, and the steepest gradient
“ will be one in fifty. Of the fifteen miles of
“ incline there will not he in the aggregate
“one mile of straight line.” And again—
“ The total length of the incline will be fifteen
“ miles, the height to be ascended being about
“ 1100 feet-” Taking the reference to the com-
pletion of the plans, with the fact that the
plans were laid on the table on the 10th May,
and the report presented on the 13th, their
connection with each other may be considered
as established. And also taking the positive
assertion that the route had not been varied,
and the identity of the terms used in the
reports of 1863 and 1864 to describe the same
incline,(a) there seems no room left for doubt-
ing that the impression intended to be con-
veyed to the Assembly was that the plans
presented involved no increase upon the ori-
ginal estimate. And this presumption is not
weakened by Mr. Macalister’s own language
with reference to Peto and Co.’s offer—“ the
Government are, if the House does not dissent
from the arrangement, prepared to accept it.”
What pertinence had those words if not bear-
(a) It will require a length of line of nearly fifteen
miles in order to get up the Main Range.”—Report 1867.


ing upon the plans which the House were asked “department by this date, but no communi-
to approve? (See the whole debate, Hansard, “ cation of any kind has yet reached this from
Yol. 1, 62 to 81 inclusive.)
But what are the real facts? That Messrs.
Peto and Co.’s tender bore no reference to the
plans before the House, and that those plans
did vary the route very considerably—increase
the length of the line and indicate an enor-
mous additional cost to the sura fixed in Mr.
Fitzgibbon’s 1863 estimate. Mr. Wilcox, re-
presentative here for the contractors, says that
when he made the offer to construct the first
section of the line for £86,900, he also " made
“ a kind of offer for the second portion between
“ Bigge’s Camp and Toowoomba * * * not
“ in the same letter but about the same date.”
This offer he states to have been based upon
an inspection of the line as pointed out, and
the figures supplied by Mr. Fitzgibbon, but
“ when I came here I found that the Main
“ Range, instead of being some sixteen miles
“ in length, was nearer twenty-eight, and that
“ the line to Toowoomba, instead of being
“sixty-eight or seventy miles, was seventy-
“ eight and a quarter, consequently I refused
“ to carry out the terms accompanying my
“offer for the first section.’’ (Evidence to
Legislative Council, Report on Railways.
1866, p. 74) Now, how did he first discover
this?
Mr. Macalister, when asked in 1866 at what
time he was first told of the alteration just
referred to, replied—“ It must have been before
“ the preparation of the plans—before the
“ plans were submitted to Parliament; the
“ plans which we laid before Parliament were
“the plans showing the decreasing gradient;
“ the additional nine miles and the reduced
“ gradient were both shown.” And again—
“No doubt I was aware —l must have been
“ aware —that if theline were extended nine miles
“ there would be an additional expenditure.”
(Evidence to Legislative Council, Report on
Railways, 1866, p. 52.) The question naturally
enough occurs why the Assembly were left in
ignorance of the fact.
But, pursuing the inquiry, we find that on
the 19th July, 1864 —about two months after
the approval of these plans—the then Com-
missioner for Railways—Mr. Fitzgibbon—
wrote thus to Mr. Wilcox (Evidence to Legis-
lative Council, Report on Railways, 1866,
p. 80) : —
" I am directed also to remind you that when
“ the Secretary for Lands and Works last saw
“ you in Ipswich he informed you that he had
“ no desire to bind you to the offer for the line
“to Toowoomba without first knowing that
“ you were still satisfied with that offer; and
“ he then requested you to state what your
“ wishes were on the subject.
“ Then you promised to communicate to this
“ you. I have to observe, therefore, that unless
“ a definite and distinct answer is obtained on
“the subject within fourteen days from this
“date, tenders in small sections will be called
“ for. You cannot well complain should the
“ Government adopt this course; for with the
“advantages which, on all hands, have been
“ accorded to you, the Government expect to
“ be met with promptitude and fairness, and
“ nothing less will satisfy them.”
Mr. Wilcox replies (Evidence to Legislative
Co'uncil, Report on Railways, 1866), on the Ist
August:—
“ I have the honor to acknowledge the
“ receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo,
“ which arrived here during the time I was
“ absent, making an inspection of the route
“ now finally decided upon for the railway
“ between Bigge’s Camp and Toowoomba.
Since my return 1 have been occupied in
“ going over and revising the notes I took
“ when making this inspection, to enable me
“ to arrive at a definite conclusion with respect
“to the magnitude of the work comprised in
“this section, and the advisability of under-
“ taking its construction upon the terms men-
“ tioned in my letter of the 28th January
“ last.(a) This second inspection has been
“ necessitated by the altered course of the line,
“ its increased length, and unmistakeable in-
“ dications of considerably heavier works than
“ were originally contemplated, which I imme-
“ diately noticed upon looking over the work-
“ ing section. ... In the first place the
“ total length from Bigge’s Camp to Too-
“ woomba is now 8 miles 12 chains longer than
“ was originally represented, In the second
“ the heavy works over the range were not to
“ exceed 18 miles; now the distance cannot be
“ considered less than 32£ miles, in addition to
“ which the works are greatly increased
“ throughout the entire length.
“ For these reasons I am constrained to de-
“ dine the execution of the work except upon
“ a schedule of prices.”
It will be observed that Mr. Willcox was
absent on a lengthened and careful inspection
of the line on a route then previously indi-
cated to him, which route involved an ‘ altered
course of the line,’ increased length, and
heavier works, and which, if Mr. Macalister’s
statement last cited be true, must have been
the one shown on the plans approved on the
17th May, but which, according to Mr. Fitz-
gibbon, did not vary from the original route of
18631 And the session did not terminate
(a) It is clear from this date that that offer could not
refer to the plans or report laid on the table the April and
May following.

Main Range .. .. .. £7,320

until the 13th September, but not a syllable
dropped to inform the Assembly of the real
state of the railway affairs. But what was
done was to pass a Loan Bill, in which the sum
of £647,000 was allotted for the “ Extension of
Railway—Little Liverpool range to Dalby, via
Toowoomba.” It is a striking and instructive
commentary on the whole that the contract
subsequently entered into on the 25th of the
following February with Messrs. Peto & Co.
for the line to Toowoomba only, was for
£515,500. Add to this sum £86,900, the
amount of the contract for the first section,
and £12.000 for the Bremer Bridge, and we
have a total of £613,900 for the works to be
executed here for the line to Toowoomba. Mr.
Fitzgibbon’s original estimate for everything
connected with the line —imported as well as
colonial-being, exclusive of his own charges,
£598,850. And the question fairly arises—
Would the Assembly have voted the Loan Bill
had they been fully informed of the peculiar
circumstances and irreconcilable statements
which distinguish this remarkable transaction ?
Was it a dim glimmering of the difficulty that
might have resulted which prompted the
silence under which they were so carefully and
—for the time—so successfully hushed. ?
An examination of the payments agreed to
be made to Mr. Fitzgibbon, and of the circum-
stances connected with them, will probably
serve to throw a little more light on the good
faith which pervaded every dealing of the
Executive on this question with the Parlia-
ment, and the intelligence with which the pro-
cedure of the day was watched. It is neces-
sary, in the first instance, to quote the terms
of remuneration for surveys, as enumerated by
Mr. Macalister in his speech of the 17th of
May before quoted
Toowoomba to Warwick, 55 miles
at £7O per mile .. .. 3,850
£14,670
And it may be as well here to direct attention
to the surveys only. The charge for superin-
tendence may be looked at when its results
have been seen.
In before referring to the discrepancies ex-
hibited at the very commencement of these
transactions, the remarkable rapidity with
which plans and sections were prepared by Mr.
Fitzgibbon were alluded to. In order rightly
to apprehend this portion of the subject, it is
necessary to recur once more to his statements
touching that point.
In his report of 1863 he asked for the follow-
ing times in which to prepare his plans and
sections, startihg from the date of instruc-
tion ;
Ipswich to Little Liverpool, six months.
Little Liverpool to Toowoomba, twelve
months.
Completion to Dalby, eighteen months.
Do do Warwick, do do
In reality his plans were laid before Parlia-
ment as follows:
Ipswich to Little Liverpool, first set, two
months after the report and without
instructions-
Ipswich to Little Liverpool, second set,
seven months after instructions.
Complete line to Dalby, seven months after
instructions.
Complete line to Warwick, (a) twenty
months after instructions.
Mr. Fitzgibbon indulges in his 1864 report in
no small self laudation over the celerity with
which he had got through this portion of the’
work. The egotism would have been pardon-
able had the tact been true. But by some un-
happy fatality connected with these railways,
concealment or misrepresentation seems more
or less mixed up in every one of their trans-
actions.
In the year 1862 the Government had pur-
chased from a company previously formed for
the construction of a tramway from Ipswich
to Dalby a set of surveys on the valuation of
Mr. H. T. Plews. By what process that gen-
tleman was able to value 110 miles of work
of which he only saw thirty, and the most
difficult part he never saw at all, it is needless
to inquire. There was a good deal of second
sight in those days. But he did value them
at £3,140.
In his examination before the Committee of
the Legislative Council on Railways in 1866,
Mr. Fitzgibbon was asked a question as to
whether he used these plans, but his memory
was treacherous. The absent-minded philo-
sophers of Laputa could not have stood more
in need of their flappers than he did when
before that Committee. The first question and
answer referring to this point ran thus, with
reference to how he arrived at his first esti-
mates :
18. And you were assisted to a certain ex-
tent by the estimates for the tramway ? Not
at all, because 1 did not take the same route
taken by the tramway.
But his examiners remembered certain pre-
vious evidence of his in 1863, before referred
to, and the examination went on. He was re-
(a) In August, 1864, the Government had not got these
pi ans. See Hansard, Yol. 1, debate on Warwick Railway
—Mr. Macalister’s speech.


minded that one question and answer at that
time ran thus :—“ In the survey of the line
“between Toowoomba and Dalby had you
“any plans or sections of the Tramway Oom-
“ pany to guide you? Yes. there are the
“ plans and sections between Toowoomba and
“ Dalby of a preliminary survey,” and so he
at last admitted. “ I saw the tramway plans
hut I didn't base my calculations upon them."
Then came the questions and answers upon
the former examination. “ I should like to
“ know how it is, if you made no survey, that
“ you have estimates involving an expenditure
“of £617,658 13s for 69 miles of railway from
“ Ipswich to Toowoomba ? As I stated before
“ I took out all the quantities from the Tram-
“ way plans from Ipswich to Dalby and then I
“ worked upon those quantities. It has taken
“ me about twenty years to know how to make
“ an estimate of that kind, and it would take
“ a long time to explain it to honorable mem-
“ bers. But I give you the basis of my calcu-
“ lations which was the quantities of the
“ Tramway plans. —How do you know the
“ Tramway plans are correct ? The levels are
“ checked by one of the Government engi-
“ neers.” When these were quoted he ad-
mitted the correctness of the report—he could
not help it. But his invaluable habit of—say
explanation—stands him on good stead, he re.
plies, “ Yes, that has escaped my recollection,
“ I know the quantities of the Tramway
“ plans were taken out, but I would have done
“almost as easily without them, because, as I
“ said before, I scarcely required a plan to
“judge of the work between Toowoomba and
“Dalby,’’ (See the whole examination, p. 13,
of Evidence appended to Report of 1866.) which
was not the only country referred to, but as
stated immediately above, from Ipswich to
Dalby.
Between two such conflicting statements
emanating from the same person.it might not
be easy to decide, but fortunately Mr. Fitzgib-
bon is not without corroborative testimony to
the truthfulness of at least one. It will be
recollected that in his 1863 report he speaks
of Mr. W. Hannam as accompanying him on
his so-called preliminary surveys. In the ex-
amination of this gentleman before the Select
Committee of the Assembly on railways in
1867, the following evidence may be found •
87. How far was the Tramway line in the
main apart from the line selected by Mr. Fitz-
gibbon? With the exception of the Little
Liverpool and Main Ranges it was nearly
identical.
95. And the Tramway surveys were in fact
the basis of a great part of the work ? Yes.
96. Did Mr. Fitzgibbon have the use of
them ? I believe he had the use of the Tram-
way plans.
97. Do you know that he had ? Yes, I do.
98. Can you state whether the Tramway
surveys from Ipswich were complete to Grand-
chester when the railway was first initiated ?
Yes, they were set out as far as Laidley Creek.
99. And they were mainly adopted? Yes,
with the exception of the Little Liverpool
Range.
217. What was the distance on the whole
over which the Tramway route was followed ?’
I should think about seventy-five miles, that
is, from Ipswich to Helidon and from Gowrie
to Dalby. (Progress Report of Select Com-
mittee, Evidence p. 61, et seq.)
So far then, we see that the use of the-
Tramway plans by Mr. Fitzgibbon may be
supposed to have occurred, but to set the mat-
ter beyond doubt, it may be desirable to quote
the evidence of Mr. Macalister before the
Legislative Council Committee in 1866. Ex*
amined touching the Bremer Bridge and the
section towards the Little Liverpool, the fol-
lowing questions and answers occur :
“ 102. Are you aware whether there was
any survey made from Ipswich previous to
the present one? In which direction.
103. Towards Grandchester ? There was the
old tramway survey.
104. It is the tramway survey we have the
line upon now, is it not? Yes; I understand
so. I undei stand that Mr. Fitzgibbon followed
that line from the commencement as far as he
could.
That is on the first section, but again Mr.
Macalister says, in answer to Question 13, (p..
53) “ when the Government gave him (Mr.
Fitzgibbon) his instructions they had deter-
mined to follow the line adopted by the tram-
way.”
It might be amusing, but it would not be
instructive to quote further from Mr. Fitzgib-
bon’s curiously elaborate mystifications.(a)
Sufficient has been cited to show that the
tramway plans were the basis of bis calcula-
tions in 1863, and the tramway route the route
he did not vary for seventy-four miles, and we
may now see why it was so much easier to get
the surveys from Ipswich to Dalby finished
quickly than it was those from Gowrie to
Warwick, where there was no previous work
to help him.
But the question now arises—why was the
money paid for the tramway surveys wasted,
and why was no corresponding reduction, or
(a) For instance, 54. Did you ever examine any other
part of the country ? Yes, I examined the part where Mr.
Coote proposed to take up the tramway, but that was quite
impracticable at a reasonable cost. Compare this with
Mr. Hannam’s evidence. 91. Did Mr. Fitzgibbon ever ac-
company you over any portion of the tramway line in that
direction 1 [to the south.] Not on the Main Range.”—
Without Mr. Hannam or Mr. Wakely, he could not have
found it, and he di d not go with the last.


even one proportionate to Mr. Fitzgibbon’s own
valuation of surveys made? We have seen
that he was to have £10,820 for his surveys to
Dalby. Take out of his length of 130 miles
the crossing of the Main Range and we have
104 miles. For these he was to receive
£7,820(a). Out of these 104 miles seventy-five
had been previously surveyed and were ready
to his hand. Whether the country were easy
or difficult is nothing to this part of the ques-
tion (although the lacility so dwelt upon by
him is not without importance in estimating
the propriety of his charge) which is' —If the
Government had decided on that line—and we
have it in evidence that they had—why did
they not at least economise to the extent of the
value of the work ready for use, and deduct it
from his payment? It might be as easy to
answer that question as to discover how in-
dents for iron-work and rolling stock could be
sent home to Sir Charles Fox, and he be left
free to charge his own commission, before the
trusting and hard-worked Mr. Fitzgibbon, who
must have done the prior work necessary, had
—if he is to be believed—either instructions
given or arrangements completed, for doing
it.
It is easy to commence a downward course
—very difficult to stop it. The next process
of that scattering, which does not increase,
was on a larger scale, but it is unnecessary to
anticipate.
Reverting to the Parliamentary history we
find that the system and its chief advocates
were gaining ground, while the opponents were
gradually dwindling away; partly from the
hopelessness of opposition, partly from an idea
that as the colony was in their phrase, com-
mitted;to the railways, they might as well go
on. And the Minister could besides always
count upon the absence and occasionally on
the vote of some disinterested personages —
open to conviction —and who, however loud
might have been their denunciations in the
House of his proceedure, rushed eagerly to
plunge into the profits derivable from it out-
side. In the Council only three members were
found to vote against the adoption of the plans
to Dalby, Mr. Fitz taking occasion to avow
his own conversion with much self-congratu-
lation. In the Assembly, on the 2nd August,
Mr, Douglas brought in a bill, the main prin-
ciple of which he described as, “that railways
“ should be constructed by local land trusts or
“ corporations, the cost to be defrayed by the
“ sale of lands in the several districts.” It
(a) Mr. Ilannam stated of his own knowledge that the
actual cost to Mr. Fitsgibbon of 98 miles, almost half of
the whole, would be about £25 per mile. See his evidence
p. 62, Legislative Assembly Progress report before alluded
to. It is deeply to be regretted that that committee was
not reappointed.
was negatived without a division. Little
more than three weeks after this, the plans
and sections for the line from Rockhampton to
Westwood —to which line Mr. H. T. Plews had
been appointed Engineer—were approved by
the Assembly, and on the same day Mr. M'Lean
moved for a supplementary loan estimate for
1864 for £329,467 13s for the making of a rail-
way between Toowoomba and Warwick, al-
though the plans were not then finished. In
the course of debate he altered the year to
1865, and on a division only three were found
to vote against him. Mr. Brookes (then a
member for North Brisbane) having now be-
come one of the converts before alluded to.
Another bill of a merely departmental charac-
ter, enabling the Government to appoint a
General Commissioner of Railways was car-
ried. and finally, a motion of a farcical nature
by Sir R. Mackenzie for a loan of £400,000 for
a railway between Maryborough and Gayndah
was negatived without a division. The session
closed with great jubilation. The railway
atmosphere seemed serene and without a cloud.
Yet even then a little one, the size of a man’s
hand, might be discerned on the verge of the
horizon.
And that cloud arose in this wise.
It will be remembered that in considering
the discrepancies between the plans laid on the
table of the Assembly and Mr. Fitzgibbon’s
report of 1864, a letter dated Ist August 1864,
from Mr. Wilcox was quoted, in which he de-
clined to hold by his first offer for the exten-
sion to Toowoomba on the ground of the mag-
nitude of the additions made subsequently to
the date of that offer. It is now desirable to
quote further.
“ For these reasons I am constrained to de-
“ dine the execution of the works except
“upon a schedule of prices, and should your
“ Government think proper to negotiate with
“ my firm on such terms, I am willing on their
“ behalf to accept the schedule of prices, upon
“ which contract No. 1 is based, a copy of
“ which is annexed to the agreement.
“Allow me, in justice to myself, to observe
“ that this schedule formed the basis of my
“ first offer, which the data supplied to me
“ will substantiate,”
Mr. Fitzgibbon, on the Bth following, re-
plied.
“ Mr. Macalister will have acquainted you
“ that the Government will not let the exten-
“ sion of the railway on the schedule of
“ prices j so if you intend tendering in lump
“for work to Toowoomba you had better do so
“at once. The Loan Bill will be passed this
“ week, and should an arrangement be not
" made with you before then, tender. . ,
“ I am fully borne out in my estimate on this
“ and all other points by Mr. Latouche’s opin-


“ ion and am quite satisfied that the whole of
“the work can be sub-let at prices averaging
“ twenty-five per cent, under the estimate.”
But Mr. Wilcox was not quite satisfied.
On the 13th he replied :
“ Since the receipt of your letter of the Bth
“ instant I have again gone most carefully
“over the cost of constructing the lino from
“ Bigge’s Camp to Toowoomba, and very much
“regret to find I cannot at all approach your
“ estimate. In investigating the matter I have
“ taken your quantities, although in these,
“ allow me to observe, there are several omis-
“ sions. . . . Still by far the most serious
“ difference is with regard to prices, and in
"these I am positive you are much mistaken.
“ I have as a check compared my estimate
“ with the cost of the lines I constructed in New
“ South Wales; and with the exception of the
“earthwork and ballast all the works on this
“line are generally in excess of anything in
“ that colony. The saving in earthwork 1 find
“ is about 12,000 cubic yards per mile, and in
“ ballast some 1500 cubic yards per mile, but
“ as I have before observed, all other works are
“ greatly in excess. ... lam of opinion
“ that you will find it necessary to make many
“ alterations in the section and works now pro-
posed, and for this reason believe that a

“ hie both for the Government and contractors;

Here was the first serious impugnment not
only of the estimates but really of the efficiency
of the plans, and thus the little cloud began to
rise above the horizon.
It would seem that Mr. Wilcox was not to
be moved, for ultimately tenders were called
for in four sections from Grandchester to Too-
woomba. Mr. Wilcox, it is to be presumed,
adhered to the practice of his firm, and did not
tender but made an offer. The result is told
by Mr. Fitzgibbou himself, in terms of such
sorrowful simplicity as to invest his narrative
with the attributes of actual truth:—
“ I can state how things occurred. The
“tenders came before the Board of Works.
“ The Board of Works on that day consisted of
“ Mr. Macalister, Mr. Austin, and myself. Mr.
“ Herbert was there at the opening of the
“ tenders, but he went away afterwards. Mr.

before Mr. Higginbotham. Presented to Parliament, 1867,
p. 145-6.
“ R. G. W. Herbert, then subsequently Mr,
“Austin went away, leaving Mr. Macalister
“and myself; and then when I saw that Mr.
“ Wilcox’s tender was so much beyond the
“ others, I stated that 1 considered his tender
“ was too high: because it was not only
“ £60,000 beyond the others, but it was more
“ than that beyond my own estimate that I
“ made ; when Mr. Macalister said that the
“ others he considered were not men of suffi-
cient standing to give so large a work to;
“ and that therefore Messrs. Peto, Brassey and
“ Betts would be by far the most preferable. I
“said seeing there was so much difference as
“£60,000 between them and the lowest(a)
“ tender, that before giving the contract to
“ them he ought to make an effort to get Mr.
“ Wilcox to reduce his tenders by some £30,000
“ or £40,000. in order that he might approach
“ more nearly the tenders that were below him.
“ Mr. Macalister’s answer to this was, that he
“ was not so solicitous about the money as
“ about the time, and as the Government could
“ not be so certain about any other people con-
“ structing the line within the time, he thought
“the Government ought to give it to them.
“ Well, I saw then that his mind appeared to
“be made up about it, and therefore I said
“ nothing more, and Mr. Macalister requested
“me to call again the next morning, I went
“ the next morning, and Mr. Austin was sent
“ down for below stairs. Mr. Macalister drew
“up a recommendation from the Board of
“Works recommending that Messrs. Peto,
“ Brassey and Betts should get the contract,
“ and asked Mr. Austin to sign it. He did so.
“We all signed it. That was how it occurred.
“ I think it you ask Mr. Herbert he will cor-
“roborate me as to the drawing up of the re-
“commendation from the Board of Works to
“ the Government; but I must say that I think
“ that Board of Works is a farce alto-
gether.” (Legislative Assembly Committee
Report. 1867-8, Evidence, p. 19.)
It was not a farce ; it was simply in thea-
trical language one of the properties in a con-
sistent comedy of errors.
But on another occasion and with a dif-
ferent object, Mr. Fitzgibbon amplified and
supplemented this statement. From that we
find that when the Engineer discovered that
his line would have to be increased from
sixty-nine miles to seventy-eight he recom-
mended the Government to allow Mr. Wilcox,
to withdraw his first offer, based on the first
line, and they did so. And then we get their
statements that Mr. Wilcox’s second tender
brsed on his actual prices for a portion of the
line, (Sec. 4). and his first offer should have
been £399,800. But the Government accepted
(a) lie had previously explained—next lowest.


one for £5l-5,000. So the contractor got in Mr.
Fitzgibbon’s opinion, and no doubt to his very
genuine disgust, £115,000 more than he ought
to have had. In Mr. Fitzgibbon’s own language
the contract was “absurdly profitable.” (Evid.
on award of Mr. Higinbothom, 1867, P- 88.)
However that may be these things are certain :
—The 1863 estimate for the line from Ipswich
to Toowoomba was, as we have seen, in all
£617,658, from which we have to deduct for
engineer, landing, rolling stock, stations, and
other items, £lOB,OOO, leaving £509,658, for Mr.
Wilcox’s portion. Instead of that, adding the
Little Liverpool contract, £86,900, to the
£515.000, in February, 1865, the contracts had,
without the Bremer Bridge, or the Ipswich
station, got to £601,900, and there was the
black cloud of ‘ extras,’ for the ‘ many altera-
tions’ spoken of by Mr. Wilcox, hovering on
the Main Range mountains ( a ) and darkening
the prospects of completion.
The contract, however, was signed on the
25th February, 1865, and the works went on.
Parliament met on the 2nd May. The Gover-
nor’s speech referred to the construction of
railway lines as having made satisfactory pro-
gress, and at a cost considerably le:-s than that
of similar undertakings in other parts of Aus-
tralia. On the 9th the plans for the Warwick
extension were laid on the table, and on the
same day Mr. Macalister announced that the
Government would not apply for any further
loan for railway purposes during the session—
a course also alluded to in the Governor’s
speech. On the 25th May he moved the ap-
proval of the plans for the Warwick extension.
Mr. Douglas, who seems to have seen through
the illusive prosperity of the time, and to have
had some glimmering as to the little value for
protective purposes of the plans and sections,
proposed as an amendment “ that the exigencies
“ of the colony are such as to call for the ex-
fa) And mark that Mr. F. says that when he discovered
his increased length of line, “ I recommended the Govern-
ment to allow Mr. Wilcox to withdraw his first offer, and
they did so.” He must have made that important dis-
covery before Parliament met —for the plans declared by
Mr. Macalister to have included the addition, were laid on
the table of the Assembly on the loth May, fourteen days
after the meeting—a space of time not sufficient for the
preparation of the drawings after the survey was completed.
Again Parliament sat till the 13th September, Mr. Wilcox
on the first August finally declined the contract on the
first offer, and Mr. FiUgibbon’s letter of the 1 9th July,
shows that he was aware even before that, of Messrs. Peto,
Brassey and Co.'s determination not to be bound by it.
And yet during the whole session not a word was said in
correction of Mr. Macalister’s statement of 17th May,
that “ the cost of construction will be within the estimated
cost,” and that Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts intended
to take the works at such a price. Was this fair towards
the Legislature on the part of the Executive of the day ?
As to Mr. Fitsgibbon recommending, (fee., the letters prove
the contrary. Long after the discovery was made we find
him pressing Mr, Wilcox not to vary his amount . See his
letter of the Bth August quoted in the text.
“ tension of railways that are calculated to be
“of a productive character, and that this
•• House cannot accept any plan, section, or
“ book of reference of a proposed line of rail-
“ way as a sufficient warrant for expending
“ upon a new line of railway, sums of money
“ which have been voted for other lines.”
(Legislative Assembly, Votes and Proceedings,
1865, p. 52.) After much debate this was with-
drawn in favor of another amendment by Mr.
Fitzsimmons, member for Rockhampton, to the
effect that “ pending the surveys now being
“ made of a proposed line of railway from
“ Westwood to the Dawson, and having in
“ view the desirability of an extension of the
“ railway from Dalby to Condamine, together
•• with the expressed intention on the part of
“ the Government not to apply during the pre-
“ rent session for the authorization of a loan
“ for the construction of a railway from Too-
“woomba to Warwick, it is not expedient to
“ approve of the plans, sections, and book of
“ reference of the said line from Toowoomba to
** Warwick." The debate was principally
noticeable for the strong declaration of Mr.
Macalister that the resolution approving of
the plans would “not put the Government in
“ possession of funds to carry on the works ;
“ the only effect it could have would be to
“ authorise the Government to construct the
“ railway when the House voted the money for
“ the purpose.” Mr. Lilley spoke warmly in
favor of the approval of the plans, and, in his
speech, brought into full prominence the
“ magnificent project” of a line to the Gulf
of Carpentaria. On a division 15 voted for
tlie Government, 11 for the amendment.
Messrs. Stephens, Lilley, and Pugh were
among the majority ; Mr. Brookes reverted to
his original opposition.
It had now been for some time a race as to
what constituency should first partake of the
railway shower; and on the 13th June Mr.
Miles, member for the Maranoa, moved three
resolutions in the Assembly, affirming (1) the
desirability of extending the railway surveys
on the South-Western line, (2) that those to
the Condamine should be finished within
twelve months and laid before the House at its
next session, (3) that the necessary loan should
thereafter be authorized. The first was carried
by a majority of 19 to 6, the others
without a division. The practical result of
this vote, was merely that Mr. Fitzgibbon ob-
tained an order from Mr. Macalister to go on
with the survey of a line from Dalby to Roma
and got £14,448 for it, and there so far the mat-
ter ended. When, on the same day, Mr. Blake-
ney’s motion for a vote of £2OOO only for sur-
veys of a line between Brisbane and Ipswich
came on, only the members for the metropoli-
tan districts (7) were found to divide against


17. Ou that occasion Mr. Macalister was
more than usually emphatic and clear in de-
fining the railway policy of the Government.
“The object of the railway policy introduced
“ by the Government, was the substitution of
“ railway communication for the mud tracks
“ that existed throughout the interior. It was
“ to provide for the internal communication of
“the colony, and not to compete with water
" communication where such moans of com-
“ munication might be found More than that,
“ in the Railway Act that was introduced, it
“ was recognised that the head of the naviga-
*• tion was the point at which railway commu-
nication should commence.” (Hansard, Ist
series, vol. 2, p. 170). As he did not say any-
thing of the circumstances connected with the
real contract with Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and
Betts, he was spared the necessity of explain-
ing in what branch of the Government policy
his action on that was included.
On the 4th July, Mr. Mackenzie, asked
whether tenders had been called for for the War-
wick extension, and was answered iu the nega-
tive; and on the 12th Mr. Macalister invited
the members to the opening of the first sec-
tion of the line which he fixed for the 31st.
On the day following the Assembly adjourned.
The reciprocity of compliment usual on such
occasions necessarily deprives what was said at
that opening of any great importance. But it
is worth remarking that the Premier, Mr. R.
G. W. Herbert, with whom what is called the
instinct of self-preservation was something
more than an instinct, took occasion with
great dexterity of compliment to Mr. Macalis-
ter to fix him as far as he could with the whole
responsibility of both scheme and execution.
It was not unnatural, for he had seen the ten-
ders, he knew of the increased contract, and
he shrank from the first indications of the
coming financial storm. He took good care
therefore to secure for himself as far as possible
a retreat. The worth of the professional and
non-professional eulogies we have yet to appre-
ciate. Mr. Fitzgibbon, however, had admirable
tact. He took advantage of the prosperous gale,
and instead of the usual and proper annual
report from his department, he sent in an
eulogistic advocacy of the three feet six guage
to Sir George Bowen, ending with an elaborate
comparison to show the enormous superiority
of his system over that adopted to New
South Wales. But in that paper, laid on the
table of the Assembly on the 4th August, are
two paragraphs worthy of extract.
“ Contracts for the lines from Ipswich to
“ Toowoomba, 78 miles, and from Toowoomba
“to Dalby, 52 miles, have been let, the former
“ to Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts, and are
“ now in rapid course of construction.
“ The first section of these railways—2l
“ miles—is now open for public traffic, and it
“is placed beyond doubt that in carrying
“ capabilities for goods and passengers, and in
“ other essential points it fully bears out the
“statements contained in the report of July
“ 9th, 1863, already referred to; while, as re-
“ gards the quality- and durability of the
“ works, of the rolling stock, and of the equip-
“ ment of the line, nothing is left to be
“ desired.”(a)
Here, again, nothing is said to induce even
a suspicion of increased cost in the line to
Toowqpmba, or that anything but the utmost
harmony prevailed between himself and the
contractors. Yet muttered grumblings mingled
with the music of the railway opening ball,
and in a few weeks engineer and contractor
were no longer even ostensibly at accord, while
their subordinates were at no pains to preserve
even the appearance of cordiality in their
mutual communications.
In spite, however, of the mollifying effects
of banquets and speeches, some suspicion
seems to have arisen that all was not right.
On the 15th August Mr. Pugh asked what was
the cost of the first section of the Southern and
Western line per mile, exclusive of the
Bremer Bridge, the cost of that bridge,
the amount expended to date on rolling
stock, and whether any, and what, timber
had been imported from England. Mr. Mac-
alister replied that the cost per mile was
£5,951, of the bridge £19,700, of rolling stock
£20,000. and that only linings of station build-
ings had been imported. No further notice,
however, was taken, and in Parliament mat-
ters went on with their accustomed quietude.
Tenders had been called for for the com-
pletion of the line to Dalby, and Mr.
Bourne’s for £149,117 was accepted, and
the contract signed on the 4th August.
On the 14th September Parliament was pro-
rogued, Sir George Bowen invoking feelings
of honest pride and devout gratitude for the
position and progress of the colony. About
the same date the Railway Commissioner and
Mr. Wilcox were exchanging angry letters on
the subject of the Little Liverpool tunnel.
The small cloud was spreading over the sky.
And here it is necessary to draw attention to
another of the singular inconsistencies which
mark the history of those times. The strong
opposition of Mr. Macalister on the 14th June
to any continuation of the railway from Ips-
which to Brisbane has already been seen.
Even £2OOO for surveys he considered a waste
of public money. On the 22nd September fol-
lowing, instructions were given to Mr. Fitz-
gibbon to survey a line between the two towns,
(a) Memorandum for His Excellency Sir George Bowen
Legislative Assembly, Votes and Proceedings, 1863, page
1238.


and for that survey he subsequently received
£lBOOl
Reverting to the Northern lines it has been
already stated that these had been placed under
the charge of Mr. Henry Taylor Plows, for-
merly Engineer of Roads for the Northern
division of the colony. In 1867 Mr. Macalis-
ter described this gentleman as a young, care-
ful. and painstaking engineer, deficient in ex-
perience, but then recently somewhat subser-
vient. ( Hansard , vol. 5, series 2, p. 851.)
Thus when men’s opinions serve our purposes
they are honest and painstaking—when other-
wise, they become “ subservient." Mr. Mac-
alister’s memory doubtless reminded him of a
previous convenient acquiescence in direction
which was similarly rewarded. In April,
1864, Mr. Flews received his instructions for a
survey trom Rockhampton to Westwood, a
distance of 31 miles. This be contracted for—
being allowed to retain his place as Engineer
of Roads at half pay—and seems to have re-
ceived £2805. (Report from Commissioner of
Railways, Jan. 1868, p. 6). He himself stated
it at £2550, or thereabouts. This was for sim-
ply, in his own language, a preliminary survey
and a rough plan of it. (Evidence before Legis-
lative Council Committee on Railways, 1866,
p. 35, question 40, et seq.) His mileage pay-
ment he set at about £B5 per mile.(a) On the
25th October, 1864, he was appointed Engineer
of Railways for the Northern districts, at
£lOOO a year. I’he working plans and sections
of the line to Westwood were ready in April,
1865, and his estimate for the work seems to
have been about £230,000. A contract for the
construction was taken by Messrs, Barry,
Rourke, and Munro, in October, 1865, at
£153,000,
At the beginning of 1866 the rumors of
difficulties on the Southern and Western line
began to acquire consistency; but the Minis-
ter’s energy in pushing on contracts never
slackened. Tenders had been called for late
in the preceding year, firstly for tne line to
Allora, and subsequently for the completion to
Warwick; and on the 15th February, a Con-
fa,) “ The working survey and sections I found had only
“been made, and the line staked and trenched for a dis-
“ tance of twenty-nine miles forty-nine chains. . . .
“ The remaining eighty-two miles have only been surveyed
“ very roughly for Parliamentary purposes. ... I
“ estimate the value of the say thirty miles of permanent
“survey, including all plans, sections, cross sections, esti-
“ mates, specifications, field and level books, to be not more
“ than ,£5O per mile.” The Parliamentary survey he esti-
mated at £2O per mile. And it was upon this “ rough”
survey that from Laidtey to Helidon and from Gowrie to
Dalby—say seventy miles —Mr. Fitzgibbon's line was car-
ried out. (See ante and appendix 1, Legislative Assembly
Progress Report, p. 91, which compare with Mr. Han-
nam’s and Macalister’s evidence before cited). It would
really seem in Mr. Plews own evidence, that the survey
contracts of himself and Mr. Fitzgibbon were, to use Mr.
Fitzgibbon’s language, “absurdly profitable.”
tract was entered into with Mr. D. Williams
for the construction of both for the sura of
£267,565 18s, 9d. That contract contained a
rather singular recital;—“Whereas the Gov-
“ eminent of Queensland have at present
“ authority from Parliament to expend upon
“ the railway from Toowoomba to Warwick
“ only such an amount of money as enables
“ them to devote the sum of one hundred thou-
“ sand pounds, and no more, to this contract;
“ but it is anticipated that, in the next and
“ subsequent sessions of Parliament, further
“ sums will be voted for the purpose.’’ Thera
wore consequent provisions for notice to stop
if the sums available were not equal to the
contract amount, and for compensation to the
contractor in the event of such a stoppage.
The £lOO,OOO had been authorised by resolu-
tion adopted by the Assembly 6th September.
1865, to be advanced out of funds in hand
pending a Loan Act in 1866.
About this time a great change was at hand.
Any one accustomed to look over the field of
Queensland politics will be aware of the
curiously absorptive powers of what is called
the Cabinet how profession, and indepen-
dence, and patriotism, and every other virtue,
are gradually drawn and enclosed within its
doors. Sir George Bowen and Mr. Herbert
were, when they chose, both masters in the
art of political attraction. And the history of
those times brings to mind irresistibly the
magnetic toy with which chil Iren draw empty
birdsh and hollow fishes around a miniature
lake. The closer the magnet the stronger the
adhesion, although withdrawn, repulsion is
tolerably sure to follow. Thus, after the close
debates on the Land Bill of 1861. one opposi-
tion member became Auditor-General; an-
other accepted the Immigration Agency; a
third slid into a Police Magistracy; and a
fourth, one month retired in disgust from poli-
tical life, denouncing the “ adventurers’’ who
had foiled him, to become only the next their
favored colleague and almost their master.
Here a share in the profits of a contract
sweetened the acerbities of a democratic ora-
tor ; there adroit flattery converted an oppo-
nent into a representative. The cushions of a
Judgeship eased the exit of the loudest de-
claimer on the Opposition benches of the As-
sembly, but not until he had had the satisfac-
tion of denouncing the assumed apostacy
which permitted Mr. Lilley to wrap himself in
the abandoned and silken habit of Mr. Bring.
And now there were to be more shillings in
the political kaleidoscope. It is now known,
although it was not then, that the facilities
for official advancement at home were superior
in attraction to Mr. Herbert, the then Premier,
than any that could be offered to him here.
And besides, times of difficulty and contest

were at hand. He was glad of what he termed
his political decease, which to him was with-
out doubt preliminary to a serener life else-
where, His retirement necessitated a change,
and Sir R. Mackenzie and Mr. Douglas were,
so to speak, operated upon. The former gen-
tleman became Colonial Secretary, while a
new political department was created, and a
translation to the Legislative Council arranged
for his friend. The Postmaster-General be-
came a political officer, and the then holder
of the office was with scant notice and scant
courtesy bowed out. Mr. Macalister was now
Premier, and with colleagues whose warmth
of adhesion could only be inferred from the
recent heat of their opposition, prepared to
meet Iho Parliament of 1866. The railway
errors of past years were supposed to have
been condoned, and the future administration
to be kept free from those defects which had
beforetime alternately puzzled and exasperated
his new colleagues.
The session commenced on the 10th of April
with the usual speech by the Governor. As
to the railways, he informed the Legislature
that the Northern and Southern railways had
been pushed on with all the energy that the
Government had at command, and that the
success which had hitherto attended the work-
ing of the first section afforded an ample gua-
rantee of still greater reproductive results as
our railways progressed towards the interior.
But nothing was said indicating any attempt
at the fulfilment of the promise made to the
Northern districts in the Governor’s speech of
1864. On the contrary, in the new Premier’s
ministerial statement he deprecated any fur-
ther extensions, and intimated that Westwood
must, for the present, be the terminus of the
Northern line.
In the meantime the disputes on the South-
ern and Western line were increasing in aspe-
rity and importance. Both sides had their
partisans in Parliament, and considerable
anxiety was felt as to the real state of affairs.
On the 26th April Mr, Fitz moved in the
Legislative Council for returns, understood to
be preliminary to a full inquiry, but was in-
duced to withdraw his motion on the ground
that their publication might prejudice the
Government in an arbitration then imminent.
On the 3rd May it was elicited in the Assembly
that the cost of the Ipswich station had been
£16,827, and on the 10th Mr. Macalister laid
on the table reports from the engineers of both
the Northern and Southern lines. The former
excited little attention. The tender of Messrs.
Barry, Rourke, and Munro had exceeded the
engineer’s estimate by £8,400. The contract
was being carried on well. The surveys were
proceeding towards the Expedition Range.
The working expenses of the line in hand were
anticipated to nearly equal the receipts, and
that was all. But the report of Mr. Fitzgib-
bon astonished and alarmed the members, and
they began to suspect that the country had
not, by any means, got tire bargains in either
him or his plans that they had been repre-
sented as being.
report, dated the 2nd April, did,
indeed', disclose some extraordinary facts and
propound some more extraordinary theories.
It began with insinuating discontent with, and
deficiency by Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts.
On the Dalby and Warwick extensions, on the
contrary, everything was described as not
merely satisfactory, but almost perfect. The
object of the contrast was apparent. But both
Houses were astounded when they found that
a sum of £422,860 was to be added to Mr.
Fitzgibbon’s original estimate of £1,226,475,
an increase of more than thirty percent. And
if this were the case already, what might not
be expected when the disputes then pending,
and others possibly to come, were adjusted?
The items of which these additions were com-
posed were not calculated to strengthen confi-
dence. The lines themselves they found
lengthened in all by eighteen miles. This
caused an estimated addition to the Warwick
line of £42,000 for seven miles ; of £lO,OOO to
the Dalby line for two miles ; and of £lOO,OOO
to the Toowoomba line for nine miles. Then
came the singular item —the Houses not know-
ing what the reader knows—“ Excess of Mr.
Wilcox’s contract amount over my estimate for
No. 1 division, £lOO,OOO, and extra work
required in lining tunnels, £66,600.” The flood
of March, 1864, appeared to have washed away
the motes from Mr. Fitzgibbon’s eyes; he saw
then that £31,400 more was wanted to meet
such an exigency, and he says so. Then came
the Bremer bridge and the station, £35,000;
additional accommodation at stations, £10,000;
and increased cost of land, of which more will
be said by-and-bye, £12,800. And this not
being enough, they were presented with the
following apology: —
“ The following are the items of expendi-
“ ture which could not have been foreseen be-
9 miles additional length of line
near Main Range .. .. 100,000
“ Proportion of extra work re-
quired in lining tunnels on ditto 30,000”
He was not, indeed, to forsee, but to ascer-
tain, and what had been his efforts that way ?
An unacknowledged appropriation of previous

plans and a guess at what he did not appro-
priate. Where he followed his predecessors
he made no blunders; where he was left to
himself he went astray ; what was good was
not his own ; what was his own was not good.
“ It would have been reprehensible in me" ho
says “ not to have recommended for adoption”
—the improved gradient(a). And why? Mr.
Doyne, a civil engineer said to be by Mr. Fitz-
gibbon of high eminence, supplies the answer
—“ I know that Mr. Fitzgibbon’s first inten-
tion was to use an average gradient of one in
50, but I think he was right in making the al-
teration. He consulted me, and I strongly
advised him to make it. i may say that I
have committed myself professionally in-ad-
vising him to do so, (Legislative Council
Report, 1866, cv. p. 65), and again “ 1
think an average gradient of 1 in 50 would
have been almost unworkable, taking into
consideration the 5 chain curves, {lbid. —
compare the original report of 1863 with this),
and the 5 chain curves were the crowning
glory of Mr. Fitzgibbon’s peculiar mode of as-
cending the Main Range.
Having, however, to his own apparent satis-
faction accounted for the increase in the cost, Mr.
Fitzgibhon then institutes a comparison of the
expense of his lines with that of the railways
in N. S. Wales, of course much in his own
favor, and finishes his report with some parti-
culars of the survey to Roma. A memoran-
dum upon traffic is appended, and there we
are given his estimate of traffic per annum
on the three lines when finished:
And as a finale we have this original and
striking paragraph—after he had estimated bis
working expenses at 50 per cent, arriving at
that by a process peculiarly his own,
“ Then taking the remaining 50 per cent, of
“the gross receipts, (viz., £137,318) as the
“ amount of the nett earnings of the three lines
“it will give 8 32 per cent, on the total capital
“expenditure of £1,650,000, so that after
“ paying 6 per cent, interest on the same the
“ Government will have the remaining 232

“ ally to the general revenue of the colony.”(c)
(a) What sort of gradient it would have been without
the improvement may be imagined, when we find from the
report. “ Steepest gradient, 1 in 50, of which 91 chains
(about a mile and an eighth) are continuous. Total
length of 1 in 50 4 miles 14 chains.”

(c) Report, p. 7. His estimate in 1863 was £113,000
per annum, gross receipts from Ipswich to Toowoomba.
Although at that time increasing monetary
pressure and anxiety were driving men out
of their senses over the whole civilised world,
it is difficult to believe now that any one could
have thrust such preposterous nonsense before
a Legislative body, and still have expected
them to believe him either competent or sin-
cere. When, hereafter, we compare these pre-
dictions with actual results, the contrast will
be so great as to leave us in doubt whether
ever any such predictions could have been
uttered.
But Mr. Fitzgibbon still found both believers
and supporters. The Colonial Treasurer cal-
culated in his budget speech of the 9th May
that if the line were opened to Helidon in
1867, he would get £88,400 receipts, that the
working expenses would be £23,374, and that
the profit to go to revenue would be £65,023,
while the Premier went beyond his engineer,
and boldly asserted that the New South Wales
lines cost three times the amount of those of
Queensland. There was great diversity of
opinion, however, but all were agreed upon the
necessity for a fresh loan, and on the 21st May
a Bill authorising the issue of debentures for
£1,170,950 passed through all its stages in the
Assembly. In the discussion in the Council
very severe censures of the manner in which
the railways had been carried on were passed
by the leading members, and it is clear that,
had it not been tor the financial strait in which
the Government was placed the Bill would
have been thrown out. On the 23rd it received
the Royal assent. In that sura was included
£432,350 for the line to Dalby, £388,700 for
the line to Warwick, and £54,900 for the Great
Northern Railway.
The financial embarrassments and the diffi-
culties of the land legislation were, by this
time, pressing upon the Government, but occa-
sionally a question in Parliament elicited a
fact worth recording—thus, on the 15th May,
in answer to Mr. Pugh, Mr. Macalister stated
that the cost of the railway from Ipswich to
Brisbane was estimated at £291,492. At
length, on the 23rd, Mr. Wood moved in the
Council for a select Committee to enquire into
and report upon all matters connected with the
railways of the colony, which, after a feeble
opposition from the Postmaster-General, was
carried, it being understood that the committee
would not be called together until after the Ist
June, on account of the arbitration before
alluded to. On the same day the business
paper of the Assembly exhibited three notices
of motion for the 12th of June—one by Mr.
Walsh for a Committee of Inquiry, another by
Mr. Macalister for a similar purpose, and a
third by Mr. Stephens, affirming that steps
should be taken to ensure the completion of
the lines for the amounts already voted. On


the 19th of June Mr. Walsh’s motion came on.
On the ground that the Council were now en-
gaged upon a similar enquiry, Mr. Herbert
moved the previous question, which, after a
warm debate, was carried by 15 to 13, all the
metropolitan members who had been, at the
commencement, strenuous opponents of the
railway scheme, now voting against enquiry.
Upon this Mr, Macalister postponed his
motion, and it may be as well to say here that
ultimately, in the political complications of
the day, it lapsed. On the 27th Mr, (Stephens
moved the resolution of which he had given
notice. The debate which followed travelled
over a great variety of topics, Mr. Herbert at
last admitting that the repm ts of the Engineer-
in Chief “ did notread very well together,” but
eventually the resolution was altered to a mere
assertion “ that steps should be taken to secure
“ the proper completion of the lines, and to
“ obtain a reliable estimate of the probable
“amount required for that purpose,’’ a lame
and impotent conclusion leading to, and which
led to, nothing. However, in that shape it
passed. After that nothing of any importance
took place in either House relative to the sub-
ject until the legal tender note topsy-turviness
suspended Parliamentary action for some
weeks. Of the various intrigues and combi-
nations which then disgraced the political
annals of the colony it is not necessary to
speak here. When, at their termination, a new
Ministry met Parliament, Mr. Bring had lost
bis seat, Mr. Macalister was Premier and
Colonial Secretary, the late Mr. M’Lean Trea-
surer, Mr. Bell Secretary for Lands, Mr. Watts
Secretary for Works, and Mr. Lilley Attorney-
General. Messrs. Mackenzie and Douglas
were not included in the ministerial arrange-
ments, and Mr. Gore was at last provided for
as Postmaster-General and the Government
representative in the Council. It is worthy of
notice that a few weeks before, Mr. Watts in
the Assembly, had expressed very high admi-
ration of Mr. Fitzgibbon. Closer acquaintance
did not increase that feeling, for, on the 27th
December Mr, Fitzgibbon piteously asks “ how
“ is it possible for me to work with a man who
“ stigmatizes me as a swindler, a vagabond, a
“scoundrel, &c.” (Evidence Legislative As-
sembly Report, 1867, p. 25.) But Mr. Watts
had been Secretary for Works for a few months
then.
Pursuing the Parliamentary history, we find
that on the 25th September Mr. Walsh ob-
tained from the Colonial Treasurer informa-
tion that the sum of £31,053 had been paid on
account of the Warwick line. The same mem-
ber asked for the plans, sections, and other
documents connected with the Ipswich and
Brisbane Railway. These were promised
for the next day. On the 27th, plans are
reported as being laid on the table, but not
estimates. On the same day, in answer to Mr,
Fitzsimmons, the Government stated that they
intended to carry out existing contracts, but
not to enter into new ones; that the cost of
construction of the line over the Main Range
would be £369,840; and that the estimate was
based upon the engineer’s estimate. The
Dalby line was expected to be opened on the
Ist January, 1868 ; the Toowoomba one on the
Ist July, 1867. During this time the ma-
chinery necessary for the increased taxation
following the heavy expenditure, and for the
temporary loans by way of Treasury bills and
Treasury notes,iad been getting into gear.
It was quite evident that the colony had got
as many burdens as it could well bear. The
debentures were selling at a very heavy loss,
and there were a few who believed the Trea-
surer’s anticipations of revenue to be far too
sanguine, and that his receipts would, as they
ultimately did, fall very short indeed of his
estimate. With these convictions, and looking
at the peculiar nature of the contract for the
Warwick line, it seemed to them desirable to
discontinue the work upon it, at least
until the ultimate cost of the main line was
ascertained. Accordingly, on the 2nd October,
1866, Mr, Walsh moved :
1. That the present condition of the financial
and mercantile affairs of the colony requires
from the Government and Parliament a re-
consideration of those Acts and Votes which
authorised and provided for the carrying out
of extensive unfinished public works.
2. That to relieve the country from some of
the authorised expenditure which it is now
proved it can ill afford to incurr, so much as is
practicable of the railway line under construc-
tion between Toowoomba and Warwick, and
can be agreed upon with the contractor, ought
to be discontinued.
3. That the construction of a line of railway
from Brisbane to Ipswich shall be entertained
as a basis for negotiating with the said con-
tractor.
4. That it is desirable to stop further expen-
diture on the works for improving the naviga-
tion ol the river between Brisbane and Ips-
wich.
5. That the foregoing resolutions be trans-
mitted to the Legislative Council for their
concurrence by message in the usual form.
(Legislative Assembly, Votes and Proceed-
ings, 1866, p. 233.)
A lengthened and somewhat angry debate
followed. It then came out that not only had
£31,053 been paid to the contractor of the
Warwick line, but that Mr. Fitzgibbon had
already received £9,768 for surveys and super-
intendence, while, that Sir Charles Fox might
be in an equally good position, indents for


£66,381 worth of material had been sent to
him. It was not, however, contended that
much of the last item would not be available
for the Brisbane and Ipswich line* When the
resolutions were put seriatim , the first was
carried without a division ; on the second, the
votes were twelve and twelve, Mr, Brookes
voting against it, when the Speaker gave his
casting vote in its favor. The third was
negatived, and the fourth and fifth were agreed
to without a division.
On their discussion in the Legislative
Council on the 9ih October, a short but sharp
debate arose. In the course of his remarks
Mr. Gore observed that “at present there was
“ no intention of carrying the railway further
“ than Allora.” Tire resolutions as transmitted
were agreed to and returned to the Assembly.
But on the previous day the committee of
the Council had brought up their report upon
the railways of the colony, and in the order of
narration, it becomes neoessafy to revert to its
character and recommendations.
The committee sat in all eighteen days, one
of which was given to the consideration of
their report. They examined sixteen wit-
nesses, and the evidence obtained forms a
valuable contribution—but only a contribu-
tion—to the history of our railways. It was
utterly impossible for five gentlemen with
little engineering knowledge, and having to
grope their way in the dark, as it were, to
bring out from interested witnesses all the
facts indispensable to arrive at a just conclu-
sion, and that in less than a score of examina-
tions, each lasting three or four hours at the
outside. As a preliminary to further enquiry,
the evidence they collected was exceedingly
useful and suggestive but no more. Accord-
ingly the report brought up was moderate in
tone and cautious in its recommendations.
They admitted that there “ was reason to be-
lieve” that the narrow gauge was a success,
but thej’ regretted that fuller information had
not been sought by the Government before
committing the colony to such an expense
resulting “ in such disastrous financial conse-
quences.” Believing that the colony may be
fairly satisfied with the engineering skill of
Mr. Fitzgibbon, they clearly perceived that
“ a decided mistake was committed in allow-
“ing the surveying and engineering superin-
tendence to be contracted for, instead of
“being conducted by a department,” and they
gave their reasons—reasons to which in a sub-
sequent division of this pamphlet it will be
proper to advert at length. They regret that
they are compelled to believe that grave devia-
tions have been made from the original esti-
mates, and that “ there is very great cause to
fear that on those sections not yet completed,
a still greater discrepency will arise”—a fear
the justice of which, as we shall see subse-
quent events abundantly proved. In . ex-
ceedingly mild terms they censure the opening
for land jobbing left by the non resumption
of the lands through which the lines ran,
and specially refer to “a purchase of land at
Dalby by Mr. Bernays.’’ They intimate a
wish for a discontinuance when possible, they
recommend that the importation of materials
for stations shall as far as possible be avoided,
that the contract with the engineer be termi-
nated and he placed in the position of a sala-
ried officer, and finally insist on the necessity
of economy of working and moderation of
charges.
It is not necessary, nor indeed is there space
here to analyse the evidence, much of it is of
opinion on matters on which we have now re-
sults to guide us. The facts presented have
been, in some cases, already referred to, and
in others will fall more naturally in another
section of this narrative. There is nothing so
pleasing or so creditable in any of them as to
induce the labor of a twice told tale.
Returning to the parliamentary record we
find that on the 10th October. Mr. Mackenzie
asked the Secretary for Works whether the
Government intended to stop the railway
works on the Warwick line. The answer was
“ the Government are unable to act on the re-
“ solution in question, inasmuch as the reso-
lution proposed as the basis for entering on
“ the necessary negotiations with the contrac-
“ tor was negatived by the house and conse-
“ quenfly the resolution to put a stop to the
“ works was inoperative.” On this Mr. Raff
immediately gave notice of motion that in
consequence of the expression of opinion by
the Government it was necessary for the As-
sembly to re-affirm the proposition, and “ that
in the opinion of this House it is desirable to
discontinue said works, and that the Govern-
ment should forthwith make arrangements in
terms of the contract for such discontinuance.”
On the 13th in the course of answering some
questions of Mr. Harris in the Legislative
Council, Mr. Gore announced that the continu-
ance of confidence in Mr. Fitzgibbon by the
Government depended upon the result of the
arbitration with Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and
Betts ; and on the 16th Mr, Raff’s motion came
on for debate in the Assembly. The debate
was languid. The division was equal, ten
voting on each side. The casting vote of the
Speaker was in favor of the resolution. The
works went on nevertheless. This debate
ended the parliamentary railway procedure,
and on the 23rd October the session closed
with a speech from the Governor in more
apologetic and less laudatory tones than usual.
As time went on the course of the Engineer-
in-Chief became less smooth. The arbitration


had gone greatly against him, and there was
left to him then only to dispute over the mea-
surements directed by it—a dispute which
rendered another reference to Mr. Higinbotham
necessary. Suspicions as to the safety of the
bridges on the Main Range began to be enter-
tained, and the necessity of strengthening
them was freely discussed, while the relations
between him and Mr. Watts, the Secretary for
Works, became the reverse of friendly. Mr.
Affleck, at the time Assistant-Engineer on the
Northern line, was called in to assist in deter-
mining the justice of the course pursued by
Mr. Fitzgibbon with respect to the completion
of the work by Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and
Betts, and on December 18th Mr, Fitzgibbon
addressed a letter of complaint to Mr. Macalis-
ter as “ Colonial Secretary and Vice-President
of the Legislative Council,” stating his wil-
lingness to resign, but at the same time his
intention to claim compensation for breach of
contract. On the 27th of the same month he
wrote a second letter to Mr Macalister, com-
mencing “ Dear Sir,” and addressed to him as
“The Hon. A. Macalister.” in which the fol-
lowing curious paragraphs occur :
“ It is with the utmost regret I have to say
“ that I find it out of my power to work in
“ accord with the present Secretary for Works.
“ How is it possible for me to work with a man
“ who stigmatizes me as a swindler, a vaga-
“ bond, a scoundrel, &c. ?
“Under the conditions of my agreement
“with the Government I suppose I have no
“alternative but to follow the Secretary for
“ Works’ instructions, however dangerous they
“ may be, as I wish for no conflict with the
“ head of my department or the Government.
“ I have absolved myself of all responsibility
“respecting the result of carrying out such
“ instructions. It may be well that you, on
“ behalf of the Government, see that you are
“not compromised.’’
And he offered to give up charge of the
Toowoomba line on being paid for his services
up to date. In the meantime evidences of
failing confidence thickened around him. Mr.
Affleck was further directed to report upon the
possibility of a line from Toowoomba to War-
wick via Drayton: and Mr. Brady was sent to
examine and inform the Government upon the
disputes with the contractor for the Dolby
line, and upon the Bremer Railway Bridge,
which was giving unmistakeable signs of set-
tlement in the north abutment. In no one
instance was a report elicited favorable to Mr.
Fitzgibbon ; and Mr. Affleck’s, on the Drayton
alternative line, was preci-e and damaging.
He did not find any great difficulty in the way
of running the line by way of Drayton, but he
reported that such a line would have reduced
the distance between Warwick and Toowoomba
by nine miles and a half, and the length of
construction by two miles and a half, and that,
without reference to saving of working ex-
penses, a saving of £l2OO per annum in main-
tenance alone would have followed from
a line via Drayton, instead of the present
circuitous route. There need be no won-
der that, with all the perplexities engen-
dered by this conflict of opinion, and
by the generally hostile character of Mr. Higin-
botham’s award(a) the Secretary for Works
drifted daily into greater antagonism to his
engineer. But he was a man of great firm-
ness of character, sometimes degenerating into
obstinacy, and overriding and disregarding the
remonstrances of Mr, Fitzgibbon he succeeded
in having the line to Toowoomba opened for
traffic on the 28th April 1867, and however
dangerous might have the character of his in-
structions, no harm has resulted from compli-
ance with the directions he gave, notwith-
standing Mr, Fitzgibbon’s predictions to the
contrary. Being about to leave the colody for
England, he shortly afterwards resigned. He
was succeeded after an interval, by Mr.
Douglas, whose self-reliance was inclined to
be feeble and whoso indecision was at times
almost weakness.
But Mr. Fitzgibbon was, if anything, per-
sistent. On the 11th May he addressed his
annual report to the Commissioner for Rail-
ways. The document was characteristic.
“ I may here state that the result of the
“ working of the Main Range section since
“ its opening fully justifies the course pursued
“in reducing the gradients from one in fifty
“throughout, (as contemplated in my report
“of July 3, 1853,) to an average gradient of
“ one in seventy, as stated in my report of the
“ 2nd April, 1866. Experience shows that
“ economical working of the line demands that
“no gradient steeper than pne in sixty-six
“ should be worked on the 3ft. 6in, gauge,
“ where it is possible to avoid it at a moderate
“ expense or by a moderate increase in the
“length of the line.”
It might be remarked here that the increase
of the crossing over the Main Range from six-
teen miles to twenty eight miles (Mr. Will-
cox’s Evidence, Legislative Council Report,
1866, p. 74), or even from fifteen to twenty-
four, according to Mr. Fitzgibbon, does not
seem very moderate as to length. And as to
expense his 1863 estimate for the incline was
£150,000. His 1866 report admits an increase
of £lOO,OOO on that. The award for section 5
(the Main Range) was £381,256 5s sd, (G. C.
Watson, evidence Legislative Assembly,
Report, 1867, p. 86) to say nothing of outlay
after. One is driven to inquire what would be
(a) This will be considered in a subsequent section.


extravagance when an increase of more than
one hundred and fifty per cent, is impliedly
referred to as evidencing moderation.
Then, after a comparison between the Dalby
line here and the Ecbuca line in Victoria a
comparison, as usual, incorrect in its basis of
figures, he concludes :
“ A careful retrospect of all that has oc-
*'currred since the date of ray first report to
“ the Government now nearly four years ago,
“on the subject of this railway leaves me
"nothing to report, but much to congratulate
“ myself upon, in having tendered the advice
" I then gave.”
If his retrospect was confined to his own
profit, his congratulations were no doubt sin-
cere, and ought to have been just, but he goes
on to say :
“ And I am quite confident that the Govern-
“ ment will be equally satisfied with the re-
“ suits consequent upon having acted
“ thereon
A confidence as singularly ill grounded as
his retrospection was self-satisfying. A per-
sonal profit of from £lO,OOO to £15,000 per
annum, on a single line of railway could not
but be a cause of pleasurable reflection to an
engineer. A continuing annual Joss of more
than £lOO,OOO to a colony will hardly be so
satisfactory a subject for meditation to its
Government.
Whatever might have been Mr. Watts’
opinion of the report, Lis resignation of office
prevented his leaving any expression of it on
record. His successor seems to have been
actuated by one overpowering desire—and
that was to get rid of Mr. Fitzgibbon, even at
a sacrifice. On the 11th July he wrote to Mr.
Fitzgibbon, stating the willingness of the
Government to relieve him of his contract, but
stipulating for his assistance on their behalf
in any action they might have to defend
against Mr. Bourne on account of the Dalby
line contract, and insisting upon his responsi-
bility for defects in the Bremer Bridge con-
struction— which last, however, might be
referred to arbitration. Substantially these
terms were those acted upon. From the
reports of debates in the Assembly it does not
seem that all the plans were given up that
should have been, and that a sharp dispute
arose, but it may be as well to refer hereto the
Bremer Bridge. The question of Mr. Fitz
gibbon’s responsibility was referred to Judge
Sheppard, and was decided upon the legal con-
struction of the contract with Mr. Fitzgibbon.
and apparently without reference to the merits
of the case. On that construction Mr. Fitz-
gibbon was not responsible for the Bremer
Bridge or any other blunder. This decision
seems to have guided the Government in other
matters relative to their disputes with their
late Engineer; and accordingly when, in the
language of Uncle Toby, he evacuated Flan-
ders, he did so not only with the honors of
war, but took all his baggage with him.
Before bis withdrawal the differences on the
Dalby line had culminated in the final cancel-
lation of the contract with Mr. Bourne on the
12th July, and it was then placed in the hands
of Mr. Brady for completion, he receiving a
salary, and a bonus being added for opening
within a specified time. The line became
available for traffic in March, 1868. The
Great Northern line was finished in August of
18G7.
While these matters were in course of ad-
justment, and on the 7th May, Parliament was
again called together. There was an absence
in the Governor’s speech of congratulation
upon our railway enterprise, which contrasted
oddly with the grandiloquent flourishes upon
the same subject, in which he had been wont
to indulge in a year or two before. During
the recess the non-compliance of the Govern-
ment with the resolutions of both Houses
in the first instance, and of the Assembly in
the second with reference to the Warwick line
had excited the anger of a number of mem-
bers, and a memorial largely signed and since
ascertained to have been concurred in by a
majority of the Legislature was presented to
the Governor praying that Parliament might
be immediately summoned. This had been re-
fused in terms more forcible than courteous,
and great discontent existed. Accordingly on
the meeting of the Legislature amendments
to the address in reply to the speech were
moved in both Houses and angry debates fol-
lowed. But the Government had a majority
in both, the ill-feeling towards the Ministry,
however, only smouldered, and on the 21st of
May the removal of Mr. Douglas from the
Treasury to the Works without going to his
constituents for re-election, afforded an open-
ing for an outburst. On the question of his
having vacated his seat, the Government were
left with only two supporteis against nineteen
opposing votes. A dissolution was the conse-
quence.
When the Houses met on the 7th August,
nothing was said in the speech about the
Railways, but they, as usual, occupied no small
portions of the opening debates. It would be
only tedious to recapitulate the opposing state-
ments and arguments, more especially as
the official documents, already referred to
afford nearly all the facts necessary for the
full understanding of the transactions in-
volved. And, moreover, all that was said at
the time is accessible to the general reader
without repitition here. It is therefore only
necessary to notice that the Macalistcr Minis-
try being left without a working majority in


the division on the address, resigned, and
Sir R. Mackenzie became Premier, with
Messrs. Palmer, Lamb, and Pring, as his col-
leagues, Mr. Prior representing the Govern-
ment in the Upper House. Parliament ad-
journed until the 17th September to give time
for the re-election of the Ministry. After it
assembled the railway policy was frequently
discussed, but not formally as with direct re-
ference to itself until on the 16th October. Mr.
Pugh moved that the House —
“ Will to-morrow resolve itself into a com-
“ mittee of the whole for the purpose of sum-
“ moning to and examining at the bar of the
“ House the lateEuginoer-in-Chief of the Sout-
h“ era and Western Railway and such other
“ officials or persons as to the said Committee
“ may seem fit in reference to the construction
“ of the said lino of railway, and any other
“ matter in connection therewith.” Upon this
Mr. Sandeman moved by way of amendnient
that a select committee should be appointed
for like purposes. A very angry debate arose,
one or two of the friends of Mr. Fitzgibbon
defending him upon the tu quoque principle
and attacking Mr, Plews, who_ had recently
been appointed Engineer-in-Chief, with great
bitterness. But the result was that Mr. Pugh’s
motion was rejected by 22 to 4, and the select
committee was carried by 20 to 7. The mem-
bers of that committee were Mr. Palmer, Mr.
Stephens. Mr. Archer. Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr.
Lilley, Mr. Douglas, Mr. Clark, Dr. Challinor,
and Mr. Sandeman.
The Committee commenced its sittings on
the 24th October, sat on nineteen days, and
examined ten witnesses. On the first day it
was moved by Mr. Lilley, seconded by Mr.
Stephens, and agreed to “ that it would be
“ desirable to obtain the services of an Engi-
“ neer of standing from one of the other colo-
“ nies, to examine and report upon the works,
“ and that application be made to the Minister
“ for Works, to procure such a gentleman.”
There can be no doubt that this proposition
was made, and acceded to, in a spirit of the
most perfect fairness : but that may still have
consisted with a thorough misapprehension of
the real object of the Committee. Of profes-
sional and technical clatter, and the worse din
of amateurs professing to handle technicalities
there had already been enough to deafen a
score of committees. The evidence upon
which to judge of the real value to the colony
of the railway scheme was uithin the colony
itself, the opinions of opposing engineers
could add little to it in substance and neces-
sarily embraced points upon which the com-
mittee were wholly incompetent to decide.
From the witnesses examined, however, a
very great mass of facts was obtained. Some
of. those had been indeed anticipated in the
evidence taken by the committee of the Legis-
lative Council before alluded to, but there were
others which had occurred since 1866, which
materially assisted the committee in apprecia-
ting the circumstances attendant upon the
origin, progress, and result of the railways so
far as their immediate history was concerned.
Their value to the colony the committee
seem not to have had time to enter upon, and
when Parliament was prorogued on the 4th
March, 1868, they had simply brought up a
progress report. In that they stated that the
acting Engineer-in-chief of the colony of New
South Wales would examine and report upon
the Queensland railways, and they recom-
mended the re-appointment of the committee
at the next session, that that report might be
duly considered and the committee enabled to
inform the House as fully as was to be desired
on the subject under investigation. Nothing,
followed in Parliament, but in time Mr. Mason,,
the engineer referred to, came to the colony,
made a flying inspection of the lines, and on
his return transmitted a strong and sweeping
condemnation of the whole. His report was
more the vehement speech of an advocate than
the candid testimony of a witness, or the im-
partial summing up of a judge, and may bo
dismissed without consideration as one of those
documents whose evident animus deprives it
of even the authority which it might have
been otherwise supposed to have derived from
the standing and knowledge of -its author.
It is necessary to notice here that the sub-
ject of the cancellation of Mr. Bourne’s con-
tract on the Dalby line was mooted in the
Assembly during the session, but with incon-
clusive results. Since then there has been no
Parliamentary movement, save a scattered
motion or two which led to nothing, and no
action has been taken to continue the enquiry
commenced in 1867. The history of the rail-
ways as to their initiatory stages may bo con-
sidered as ended; henceforth it will be of their
influence upon the condition and progress of
the colony. Some facts have not been eluci-
dated, and now probably never will be, as to the
manner in which they were originated and
carried on; but still there are sufficient extant
to enable the inquirer to come to a decision
upon the spirit which pervaded, and seems to
have guided, the whole of the attendant trans-
actions.
We have now arrived at the second division
of the subject, viz., “The working of the con-
tracts and its results as compared with the ex-
pectations originally held out.”
The first contract with which we have to do
is that with Sir Charles Fox.
Mr. Fitzgibbon, in his examination before
the Legislative Council, stated that he recom-
mended Sir Charles Fox to the Government,


and thought his appointment was in Novem-
ber, 1864, hut did not know which was his first
communication with the Government. The
first indent he made out was, he thought, at
the end of October or in November —he could
not speak from memory—but he made the
indent out and sent it to the Minister. He
did not know the rate of commission agreed
upon then, but knew the eventual agreement,
and that there was correspondence on the sub-
ject. He did not know of his own knowledge,
but was informed that Sir Charles Fox was to
receive 3i per cent. (Evidence, Report, Legis-
lative Council Committee, 1866, p. 18, 19)
Before the Assembly Committee Mr. Fitz-
gibbon was a little more circumstantiallt
was just after the line from Ipswich to Bigge’s
Camp had been directed by Parliament the
Government promised in the House that they
would make enquiry, and send home to Sir
'Charles Fox for his opinion, to satisfy them-
selves as to the sufficiency of the 3ft. Gin.
guage for the requirements of the colony.
About two months after they ordered me to
prepare an indent for the twenty-one miles of
railway from Ipswich to Bigge’s Camp, I
sent it in, and with it this memorandum for
the London Agent. (Memorandum respecting
the London agency for railway purposes) (Evi-
dence Legislative Assembly Committee, Report
18G7, p. 10).
Mr. Macalister We did take the advice of
other engineers. . . . We obtained some
from Sir C. Fox. I cannot be sure (whether
the first indent for our railway material was
not sent at the same time). I fancy not. Pro-
bably there was not much time lost between
the two, and I think, in writing to Sir Charles
Fox, it was mentioned that his employment as
agent was entirely dependant upon the view he
took with regard to the undertaking(a).
Mr. A. O. Herbert, Commissioner for Rail-
ways in 1866, produced the following corres-
pondence:—
Minister for Lands and Works to Sir 0. Fox
and Sons: enclosing “certain documents,”and
(a) Evidence Legislative Council Committee Report,
p. i’’. Mr. Macalister’s ideas upon Sir Charles Eox’s posi-
tion seem to have been hazy. He says that with reference
to the French contracts which turned out so badly—“ I be-
lieve all that was thoroughly cleared up; ho (Sir Charles
Fox) was knighted I believe after that. I have always un-
derstood so, and I believe that to be the case.” He could
not have inquired beyond Mr. Fitzgibbon, whose recollec-
tion of dates was extraordinary. Sir Charles Fox tvas
knighted at the time of his connection with the great exhi-
tion of 1851. The firm of Fox; Henderson, and Co. were
mechanical and manufacturing engineers at Birmingham
and not contractors in the general sense of the term. After
the great exhibition they went into railway contracting and
the firm broke down with such a crash that they never
could resume business. The result of the French trials
in 1857 was understood at the time to have precluded
that.

Compare these letters with the following
paragraphs in the letter of Sir 0. Fox of 26th
November, 1863, as printed in the “corres-
pondence on light railways” Legislative As-
sembly papers. (Votes and Proceedings, 1864.
p. 1152-3.) “ I am proceeding to complete
“ specifications for the whole of the materials
“ comprised in the indent enclosed in your
“despatch, and hope to be able by the next
“ mail to inform you that contracts have been
“ entered into for their supply.” And again,
“ I have given the question of the proper
“ gauge for your railways my very careful
“ consideration and reported thereon by the
“ last mail to your engineer, Mr. Fitzgibbon,”
and he enclosed a copy of that report. It was
October , 1863, and commences “ I
have given the subject of your very able and
elaborate report dated July 9, 1863,” &c., &c.
From a comparison of the evidence and the
correspondence it would appear that Mr. I itz-
gibbon sent a copy of his report of July, 1863,
to Sir 0. Fox, by the first mail available after
its preparation(a) and before Parliament could
have decided anything; that Sir C. Fox sent
him at once a report in favor of his report;
that the Government sent Sir C. Fox his ap-
pointment and the first indents at the same
time ; that is on the 18th September, 1863,
leaving the question of remuneration open;
and that Mr. Fitzgibbon reported that Sir
C. Fox ought to have 5 per cent, directly after
ho had received Sir Charles’s letter of the
26th November, in which one precedent for
that heavy commission was furnished.
These being facts Mr. Fitzgibbon’s state-
ment in his 1863 report and in his evidence,
that the indents were not sent until October
and November and after the alleged time of
his instructions for surveys were received
must be considered as untrue, and the worse
fa) The mail of July would not reach England until
September. Then, allowing for time to consider “ care-
fully,” and we have the 26th October letter.


for being deliberately so. But it is clear that
private communications passed between him
and Sir Charles Fox prior to the date of any
known correspondence between that engineer
and the Government. The value of Sir C.
Fox’s opinion under all the circumstances may
* be subject to as much doubt as the veracity of
his friend and correspondent. But what is to
be said of Mr. Macalister, under whom these
things were done, and by whom, he well.know-
ing the facts, the very opposite statements
already narrated were made to Parliament?
Subsequently and after the execution of the
indent upon the first section the commission
to Sir Charles Fox was reduced to per cent.,
and at that it stood till the termination of the
agency.
What did Sir Charles Fox do for this com-
mission besides lending his authority to the
gauge and generally to the system adopted ?
He designed or got others to design the iron
bridges, and the rolling stock, and such of the
plant as required design, and he cither modified
Mi. Fitzgibbon’s plans or got others to make
plans principal stations. He inspected
and certified to the value of all that he sent
out, and performed generally the duties of
“ designer as well as agent. (Mr. 1' itzgibbon a
evidence, Legislative Assembly Report, 18G7,
p. 10, questions 14 to 18, and see the evidence
generally). Altogether the system of delega-
tion seems to have been thoroughly carried
out from Mr. Fitzgibbon to Sir C. Fox, and
from Sir 0- Fox to the contractors with whom
he dealt(a). As to responsibility that van-
ished immediately it was looked for.
Under these circumstances there need be
no surprise when we find that under these
triune auspices, the original estimates were
enormously increased. That of Mr. Fitzgib-
bon for bridging, viaducts, station buildings,
workshops, engine houses, sidings, rolling
stock, plant, and machinery, for the whole of
the Southern and Western lines was—exclu-
sive only of the bridging required on the
Main and Little Liverpool Ranges— £232,000.
Let it be admitted that the cost of work in
the colony for all these items on 162 miles of
line would pay for the imported material for
bridging and viaduct on the two ranges, and
the allowance will be sufficient and not ex-
treme. But the Southern and Western Rail-
way figures in Mr, A, O. Herbert s elaborate
and valuable report of expenditure up to the
Ist January, 1868—under the head of London
indents— for £375,091 16s 8d of which £11,210
9s 8d formed a pleasant little extract in the
shape of commission to Sir Charles Fox. And
there was still £ll,OOO of Sir Charles Fox’s
orders to meet.
(a) lie advertised for plans and designs as well as mate-
On the Northern line there was also excess,
although not to so great an extent, Mr. Plews'
estimate for indents in 1866 was £59,606. Mr.
Herbert's report before cited shows that they
ran up to £74,488 13s 9d. The commission
paid up to the date of that report to Sir C.
Fox had been £1,668 14s 4d. The increase
was considerable, but when one has become
accustomed to Mr. Fitzgibbon’s monstrous
addenda, Mr. Plews’ additions appear moderate.
It is necessary too to remember here, in
fully appreciating Mr. Macalister s administra-
tion quantities, that the orders for all this ex-
traordinary excess of nearly £16,000 on the
original estimate of about £‘282,000 had neces-
sarily to pass through his office and under his
own eyes before they acquired validity. He
must be considered to have deliberately
adopted them. But we find not a single ex-
pression of surprise, protest, or question
touching any portion of this vast increase in
any statement of that Minister s—verbal or
written—that has yet received publicity. On
the contrary, until after the great bulk of these
orders were in course of execution, parliament
was left under the delusive impression that
the original estimates would not be increased.
We now come to Mr. Fitzgibbon. He held
no office under the Government. “ No, lam a
contractor” was his answer to a question
before the Legislative Council Committee in
1866 as to whether he was in the Government
employment. What was the contract?
The contract is dated 18lh September, 1863.
For the whole of the Southern and Western
lines he was to receive £14,670 for surveys,
and at the rate of £320 per mile for superin-
tendence between Ipswich and J oowoomba,
and £2BO per mile on the lines to Dalby and
Warwick. The only clause touching on power
of dismissal by the Government is the follow-
ing one: —
“Provided also that if the said Abraham
“ Fitzgibbon should fail to make such progress
“ with the works, or any of them, as shall be
“ insufficient to insure their completion within
“ the time specified for each respectively, or
“ that the same, or any portion thereof, have,
“or has been executed in an improper ruan-
“ ner, or that the said Abraham Fitzgibbon
“ has, through negligence or default, couj-
“ mitted a wilful breach of his contract, it
“ shall be lawful for the Government, by a
•• notice delivered to the said Abraham Fitz-
“ gibbon, or left at his usual or last known
“ place of abode or business, absolutely to
“determine this contract, and from and after
“the delivery of the said notice this contract
“ shall be absolutely determined, saving, how-
“ ever, to the parties hereto all rights accruing
“ prior to such determination.”
The value of this was shown by the circum-


stance that the Government were unable to incomplete and not in accordance with their
extract from him a single sixpence, or to resolution. Was it inconvenient to supply this
deduct a single sixpence for any default or any
negligence—even for the failure of the abut-
ment at the Bremer Bridge. The omission of
any provision for a consulting engineer was
most culpable.
With respect to the rates of payment, the
enquiries made as to their propriety bore a
curious analogy to the Sir Charles Fox pro-
cess. Everybody seems to have had a pecu-
niary interest in testifying on behalf of every-
body. “We took” says Mr. Macalister in
1866 “ the necessary steps to ascertain whether
“ the contract was a fair and reasonable one,
“The Government submitted it to the only
“railway engineer we had then in the colony
“ —Mr. Plews— who is admitted on all sides
“ to be a thoroughly competent railway engi-
“ neer, and upon whom a very.high encomium
“ had been passed in this House, and Mr.
“ Plews, after examining every item and fill-
“ ing up all the blanks, stated that the con-
“ tract was a fair and reasonable one.” And
then, with charming simplicity he adds : “In
“ proof of that, I may mention to the Com-
“ mittee that when the Government deter-
“ mined upon making railways to the north,
“ they at the same time determined upon
“ establishing a department at Rockhampton,
“ with a view of testing the economy of the
•“ system,” (Evidence Legislative Council
Committee, 1866, p. 44) That department
was placed under Mr. Plews, and was not
more economical than Mr. Fitzgibbon’s con-
tract. But when Mr. Plews so kindly filled in
the blanks, was he himself expecting that con-
tract for surveys in the North at about £BO per
mile in addition to his half pay ? It was quite
.natural that, with such anticipations, he should
see nothing extravagant in Mr. Fitzgibbon’s
demand for £BO and £7O, and forget bow
recently he had valued permanent working
surveys at £5O. No doubt Mr. Fitzgibbon was
quite as ready to testify at that time to the
economy of Mr. Plews, although subsequently
they said some very harsh things as to each
other’s incompetency. And Mr. Macalister, in
another twelve months or so, described Mr.
Plews as “ a young, careful, and painstaking
engineer without any great amount of expe-
rience'' whence we derive the conclusion, com-
fortable to incompetency, that “a thoroughly
competent railway engineer” may be without
any great amount of experience.
And what was Mr. Fitzgibbon to do? This
cannot be detailed, for the “ schedules for sur-
veys” and “ schedules for works” which con-
tained the particulars of the services he was
to render are omitted from the copy of the
agreement supplied to the committee of the
Legislative Council, and without them it was
information ?(a) It is therefore necessary to
adopt an opposite method of inquiry and to
ask, in the first place, what he did not do ?
He did not, in the proper sense of the term,
survey or design the line from South Ipswich
to Grandchester, with very trifling exceptions.
He did not find the crossing of the Little
Liverpool. He did not survey and design the
line from the Little Liverpool to Helidon, and
ho did not survey and design the line from
Gowrie to Dalby, All this he found ready to
his hand as has been shown before.
He did not design the iron bridges on his
lines, and he did not design the principal sta-
tions. These, as we have seen, were left to
Sir Charles Fox or to those persons to whom
Sir Charles Fox in turn delegated his work.
But he directed the approaches to the Little
Liverpool crossing, and the crossing of the
Main Range to be laid out to given gradients;
that is lie fixed starting points at top and bot-
tom and then running round every spur
except some that he tunnelled through, and
crossing every gully on the sides of them he
connected the summits with the plain. This
was running a route, but it was not engineer-
ing. And he moreover chose the route from
the main line to Warwick, a route which
engineers of at least equal standing to him-
describe as unnecessarily tortuous and
certain to be ultimately necessarily expensive,
both in maintenance and working. He was
responsible for the working section of the
whole Southern and Western line, and he
superintended its construction from Ipswich
to Dalby and some portion of the Warwick
extension as well.
In connection with these works he made
estimates of cost and estimates of traffic, and
by them the Government of the day assumed
to be, and the majority of the Legislature un-
doubtedly were, guided in their adoption of
his plans.
We commence with the verification of his
contract plans by their ultimate carrying out,
Into an examination of the conflicting opin-
ions as to the judgment with which he acted
in his surveying and engineering operations,
it is unnecessary to enter ; engineers differ at
different times, and it would bo idle to revive
a technical controversy when we have results
to guide us. It is therefore proposed to cite
only those facts which it is impossible to con-
(а) It was a singular circumstance, that at the time the
evidence was in course of printing, the Colonial Secretary,
then Mr. Macalister, interfered and ordered that a number
of the appendices should not be printed. Why? See
Legislative Council, Hansard, Yol, 4, series 2, “Breach of
Privilege.”

trovert and those opinions in which all seem
unanimous.
“ I find,” says Mr. Wilcox, speaking of sec-
tion 5, “ the line has been altered in gradient
“ for a length of five and a half miles, the
“ centre line for four and a quarter, nine and
“ three-quarters miles out of eighteen of the
“ line have been changed, either in height or
position.” And again speaking of the whole
line. “ out of the two hundred and forty-seven
“ works of art specified in the first instance only
“ seventy-nine remain as originally intended,
“ one hundred and sixty-eight having been
“ altered. With regard to the bridges—which
“ of course are included in the works of art—
“ according to the original plan, the contract
“ plan, there were nineteen, whereas now we
“ have forty-two or forty-three.” (Award
papers, p. 82.)
And in positive confirmation of the first part
of this statement, the language of Mr. Higin-
botham’s award ran thus :
He directs that the Government took the
section No. 5 wrongfully out of the contrac-
tor's hands, and shall therefore pay £l9OO for
loss of profit, and then he goes on;—“I award
also that the alterations made in the works
“of this section since they were contracted
“ for by Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts, are
“ so numerous and extensive , that the bulk sum
“ at which the said contractors undertook to
•* execute the works of this section as origi-
“ nally proposed, will not apply to the works
“as they have been executed. And I direct,
“ therefore , that for the purpose of ascertain-
“ ing the amount due to the contractors on
“ this section, a measurement and an account
“be taken." (Award papers, p. 6.) And upon
this the contractors were to be paid at a
schedule of prices.
The alternative is clear. Either the original
section and plans were grievously defective or
the alterations were unnecessary: we are to
presume that they were necessary, as well
“as numerous and extensive.” What then
becomes of the value of Mr, Fitzgibbon’s
original and careful survey, and the section
that “ it would have been reprehensible not to
have adopted?” Had he any section really
decided upon at the date of Messrs. Peto and
Company’s contract?
When we take up the report of Mr. Mason
to which allusion has been previously made,
and collate it with those of the Queensland
Engineers, we find that these gentlemen
although naturally annoyed at the wholesale
vituperation with which the railway and all
connection with it had been assailed, are still
at accord with Mr. Mason on some important
points. Mr. Plews agrees with him that the
embankments are too narrow. Mr. Stephens
entirely coincides with his condemnation of
the station arrangements as “intrinsically bad’’
and far too costly, and adds “ It is useless to
attempt to defend them.” Messrs. Mason,
Plews, Stanley, and Stephens all censure the
sleepers as too short, and three out of the four
fall foul of the sharp curves which seem to
have been to Mr. Fitzgibbon the acme of en-
gineering attainment. In short between as-
sailants and defenders, he seems very much in
the predicament of iEsop’s old man with two
wives:—the elder picked out all the black
hairs from his head, the younger all the white,
and between the two his pate at length became
bald.
We come next to the natural result of the
defective nature of the working section and
the insufficient surveys on the range in the
enormous addition to the estimates. It will
be remembered that Mr. Fitzgibbon laid great
stress on his original estimates being made
“ before survey.” But their detailed nature
prevented any such supposition on the part of
the Legislature. He did not then say they
were so made, and in his 1864 report he con-
gratulated himself upon the fact that those es-
timates would be maintained. In 1866, as we
have seen, he enlarged them and gave his
reasons—reasons which have already been ex-
amined. But the actual results were again
very greatly in advance of these. The follow-
ing table will place the reader in possession of
the whole:—
Ipswich to Toowoomba, 1863, £617,658;
1866, £973,518; 1868, £1.234,206.
Toowoomba to Dalby, 1863, £279,349 ; 1866,
£289,349; 1868, £331,153.
Toowoomba to Warwick, 1863, £329,467;
1866, £386,467 ; 1868, £450,896.(a)
The actual cost of the first exceeded the
estimate of 1863 by £616,458—5ay a hundred
per cent.; and of 1866 by £260,688 —say nearly
twenty-seven per cent. ; of the third, the esti-
mate of 1863, by £121,429, or nearly forty per
cent.; and of 1866 by £64,429, or more than
twenty per cent, With the full knowledge of
how his contracts were going on, his estimates
were still most unjustifiably in error. Only on
the Dalby line, where the country was flat and
there were no difficulties was bis original esti-
mate exceeded by so small an amount as nine-
teen per cent. On Mr. Fitzgibbon’s varying
apologies for this progressive maintenance of
error it is unnecessary to comment further
than has already been done.
There is, however, one matter connected
with these surveys which it would be wrong
to omit remarking. The Bailway Act of 1863
provided for the preparation of a book of refe-
rence, as well as of plans and sections of every
line. This book of reference was described in
fa) Mr. Herbert’s estimate, Ist January, 1868.


that Act as one “ in which shall be set forth a
description of the said several lands and the
“ names of the owners and proprietors thereof,
•• so far as the same shall be known, or can,
“ with reasonable diligence, be ascertained,
“ with a description of the said lands, setting
“forth the bearings of such railway as the
“ case may require, and the nature and quality,
“state of cultivation, the enclosures (if any),
“ and the quantity of, such land which may be
“ required for the purpose of making such
“ railway.” When the plans and sections and
book of reference had been approved by the
Executive Council notice was to be issued in
the Gazette “ setting forth generally the extent
and direction of the intended line of railway,”
and the plans and book were to be available for
inspection at the office of the Commissioner in
Brisbane. The English requisite that notice
should be served upon all the persons inte-
rested was, and doubtless for good reasons,
omitted.
By a railway is supposed a line with its
stations and termini. A railway without a
terminus is an absurdity. But says Mr. Mac-
alister,—“As a rule I think it will be found
that the terminal stations were not shown
upon any of the plans either on the Toowoomba,
Dalby, Warwick, or Ipswich line.” It follows
that as special Parliamentary sanction was
never obtained for these, the terminal stations
not having been shown on the approved plans,
are without Parliamentary authorization, and
it also follows that no book of reference was
ever submitted. But it resulted besides that
certain of Mr. Fitzgibbon’s friends somehow
found themselves possessed, at the proper time,
of lands either required for the stations, or in
immediate contiguity to them, and reaped a
large profit on the transactions. Land at Dalby
previous to the site of the terminus being gene-
rally known, but in its locality, fetched £33
per acre. The plans of the line (without the
terminus) were approved on the 17th May,
1864. Within a short period of that date Mr.
Bernays, the Clerk to the Legislative Assem-
bly, purchased at Dalby between fifty-two and
fifty-three acres of land, afterwards in imme-
diate contiguity to the station, at an average
price of £35 per acre. In December of that
year he says he received an application from
the Commissioner of Railways for five acres.
For these he asked and got £lOOO, being at the
rate of £2OO per acre. And it is not the least
remarkable fact connected with these station
arrangements, that out of the sum of £26,294
18s 8d paid for land from Ipswich to Dalby,
Mr, James Taylor, the member for Western
Downs, received nearly £6,500 for his own
share. Had the Minister for Works followed
the usual course of having correct plans pre-
paied in the first instance, of giving notice
of the land required to the parties whose pro-
perties would be affected, and of preventing
their using the improvement resulting from
the railway to enhance the value of what was
taken, this wholesale jobbery would have
been prevented. Mr. Bernays and Mr. James
Taylor would have got £35 an acre for their
Dalby land, instead of £2OO and £250, and the
beneficial effect of a railway paid for by the
country could not have been made a pretext for
fleecing the public to the extent of the improved
value its own work created. (See evidence, Mr.
Roche, Mr. Taylor, and Mr. Bernays : Legis-
lative Council Committee report, 1866.) But
then Mr. Bernays had been useful, and Mr.
James Taylor still was, and there is such a
thing as gratitude for past services, when
there is a good chance of new ones being
rendered.
Leaving, however, the surveys and superin-
tendence, and what came of them, the traffic
estimates and revenue from the lines are next
to be looked at. Of these also Mr. Fitzgibbon
gave two estimates as each likely to be realised
on the opening of the lines, one in 1863 and
one in 1866. It will be convenient to give
them, and the actual results in 1868 in a tabu-
lar form.
1863. 1866. 1868-
Estimate. Estimate. Actual.
Goods, mails, &c.... £43,000 £122,276 £40,336
Passengers ... ... 70,000 87,880 13,232
Total, ... £113,000 £210,156 £53,568
T(ie total absence of anything like fixity of
principle in Mr. Fitzgibbon’s estimates, will
be apparent from a comparison of that of 1863
with its fellow of 1866. In 1863 the passenger
receipts figured as seventy per cent, in excess
of the goods. In 1866 the goods were assumed
as being nearly fifty per cent, more productive
than the passengers. It is curious that his
first estimate of goods was based on the old
tramway estimate, and is nearly correct.
We next come to the working expenses.
In 1863 he estimated them at £60,000, on a
traffic of £113,000; in 1866 at £105,000, on a
traffic of £210,000 ; in 1868 they were actually
£48,348 on £53,568. The nett revenue is of
course far below what was predicted. In 1863
he calculated it would be £53,000, in 1866
£105,000; and in 1868 it really was little more
than £7,000. The Warwick line has been ex-
cluded from these comparisons, no official
statement of its earnings being yet available.
Mr. Fitzgibbon calculated its receipts when
opened at £64,480, upon which absurdity it is
unnecessary to comment. And it would savor
of impertinence to the common sense of the
reader, to dwell upon the utter want of reflec-
tion displayed by those who accepted the base-
less extravagances which have just been re-
capitulated. One hundred and forty thousand


passengers a year, or 383 per day-including
Sundays as travelling days—each passenger
travelling forty miles, derived from a scattered
population of twenty thousand souls in the
districts north and south of the railway, is one
of those propositions which one can hardly
believe to have been ever seriously made ; that
the Warwick line should supply 170 such pas-
sengers per diem was a fitting cap to the whole.
Yet these were as distinctly stated by Mr.
Filzgibbon in 1863 as they now are here, and
on these estimates was the colony plunged
into a debt of nearly two millions sterling. It
is an ominous fact that in 1870, taking the
revenue and expenditure return as a basis—the
Allora extension being open too— the receipts
for the first six months are hardly beyond the
average of 1868, while the working expenses
are more.
Of Mr, Fitzgibbon’s surveys to Roma, and
between Ipswich and Brisbane, it is. unneces-
sary to say more than that in their conduct he
was more indebted to his assistants for results
than they were to him for suggestions. For the
former, however, he received £14,448, and for
the latter £lB2O. The value of both, if we are
to reason from the fresh surveys and examina-
tions since made, seems problematical. Mr.
Thornloe Smith’s recent survey of the latter
has cost the country scarcely one-half of Mr.
Fitzgibbon’s charge ; while in economy of
construction, judging from the quantities fur-
nished and Mr. R. report, his line
appears to be infinitely superior.
Let us sum up the whole. He brought a
system and supplied an authority to approve
of it, who, in due time, developed into a paid
agent. He adopted other men’s labors and
took credit to himself for a rapidity which
they bad rendered practicable; Ha sent in
plans and sections before be received instruc-
tions, or could, according to his own statement,
have ever made preparations, for commencing
the survey, without which for him they had no
basis. He sent in others of the same line
after the ostensible instructions had been
given him, and he furnished indents for the
Home Agent before, according to himself, he
had even started on the survey from which the
information necessary to the preparation of
those indents was to be-derived. In the report
contemporaneous with the presentation of the
second set of plans he took credit for the first
contract being within his estimate, but forgot
to state that, to make the line available at its
commencement, another £35,000 would be
wanted. With the full knowledge that the
lino to Toowomba was lengthened by at least
nine miles in its most expensive part, he not
only omitted to state this explicitly in the
report, but he conveyed to Parliament the im-
pression that Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts
were willing to contract for its construction
for an amount within his original estimate,
although aware that their offer was for the
railway on its original length, and was made
in ignorance of the extension. When that
offer was withdrawn in consequence of that
extension he was silent; and when the contract
for completion to Toowoomba was taken at a
very large sum beyond that which he had
led the Legislature to believe would be
the extreme cost, he omitted to report upon
the subject and wrote an eulogy upon the
three feet six inch gauge instead. He so pre-
pared his own and principal section of the line
that it could not be carried out without altera-
tions which invalidated the contract for its
construction, and for the necessary alterations
and amendments here and elsewhere the
colony had to pay £234,747. In place of
£617,658 for the whole railway from Ipswich
to Toowoomba, the cost was £749,747 for con-
struction alone, and for the line in all £1,234,206.
In no one estimate of either expenditure or
traffic or revenue was he right, and in most
hopelessly wrong. And even when two years
experience had shown him how the extras were
striding on, he sat himself down to excuse the
past and blunder again as to the future. For
his estimate in 1866 of final cost was far below
the eventual result, and'his calculations of
traffic more fallacious than those of 1863. And
he finally left behind him a railway which in
no case has fulfilled his promises, either of
cheapness of construction or economy of work-
ing ; and a series of official records, which in-
delibly testify to his skill in contriving a scheme
—in concealing its defects until exposure burst
in of necessity—in palliating and excusing its
deficiencies —and in escaping any damage to
himself from either deficiency or disclosure.
And having done all this he could naturally
enough say he “had nothing to regret but
much to congratulate himself uponfor it
would be hardly possible to find in the whole
history of railways another engineer who had
accomplished so much in very little more than
three years and been paid nearly eighty-six
thousand pounds for the achievement.(a)
The Northern line, or rather the fragment of
a line, so termed, comes next in the order of
inquiry. For this the original estimate, as
stated by Mr. Macalister in moving the ap-
proval of the plans, was £198,000. Mr. Flews
in his evidence before the Legislative Council
stated his original estimate to have been
£211,723 6s. (thirteen thousand more). This
estimate was made upon a preliminary
survey—from which the plans laid before
(a) The Bremer Bridge failure is not discussed here.
Purely technical argument would be out of place, and it is
sufficient that it did fail. Besides, what was two or three
thousand out of half a million’s worth of errors.

Parliament for approval seem to have been
made. When the working survey was com-
pleted, the real estimate was £254,900. _ The
actual expenditure charged to the line in the
return of 1868 is £289,442—but from this
should be deducted £5,565 for extension sur-
veys. The amount would then be £283,9/7.
Mr. Plews’ second estimate, therefore, was
exceeded by about £29,000, and his first by
£72,000. Such a fact shews the absurdity of
proceeding with any line of railway until
definite information based upon actual and
working sections has been received—and riot
only received, but well and intelligently con-
sidered.'
Mr. Plews’ estimates were for the first six
months of traffic goods, £4,817, passengers,
£1,875; and of expenses £6,300 (Legislative
Assembly papers, 1866, p. 1501). Thus his
annual traffic receipts should have been
£13,400.
The actual results have been :—1867, four
months* receipts £3,871: expenses. £5,496. : -
1868, year’s receipts, £3,871; expenses, £5,496,
In his traffic estimates he was more unfortu-
nate than Mr. Fitzgibbon, although in his
strictly engineering* operations ho was more
successful.
Mr. Plews’ payment for the preliminary
survey has been before noted. There remains
only to say that, when a salaried officer, in the
economy of his surveys he adhered to the then
orthodox standard. He was never below Mr.
Fitzgibbon, and generally above. But there
is this to be remembered. What he professed
to survey, he did: he had no previous help.
There was one circumstance connected with
this northern line which deserves notice. Two
steamers—the “ Platypus” and the “ Leonie”
were purchased for the purpose of conveying
rails and rolling stock from Brisbane to
Rockhampton. The expenditure on the two
to the 31st December 1867 was £24,268. The
total amount of the London indents (the goods
to be conveyed) was £74,488. Why arrange-
ments were not made for their direct shipment
from England to Rockhampton is a question
that it may not be easy to answer.
Taking the official statistics of the year 1868
—the last available—the general result from
the construction anid working of the Southern
and Western line, and of the Great Northern
line may be thus stated.

The total deficit in 1868 may be taken at £6OO
per mile on the lines then in actual working
and exclusive of interest on the cost of the
Warwick extension. Since then, and with the
Allora line open, we see that the- annual loss
is not diminishing, but, if anything, is on the
increase.
The cost per mile on our single lines —the
gauge being 3 feet 6 inches, and great economy
a special attribute —has been as follows;
Bearing in mind the lighter character of
the works generally as compared with those
of the railways in other colonies, there does
not seem that any remarkable economy has
been shewn in the construction of our lines,
while they would not without additional cost
be available for the heavy traffic which the
others are calculated to carry.
It can hardly be pretended by the most
enthusiastic admirers of our railway system,
that it has realised the predictions made in
1863, or the promises made as late as 1866 and
1867, both by the Gbvernment and Mr. Fitzgib-
bon. A loss of £6OO per mile is in sad con-
trast with the assured two per cent, on the cost
of construction contribution to the general
revenue after the interest on that cost had
been paid. Bdt it was in vain that in 1863
the fallacious nature of the report and esti-
mates on which all the expenditure that has
been detailed was based, was pointed out. The
absurdity of the traffic estimates was then
emphatically insisted on. It was shewn that
the great bulk of the population in the dis-
tricts affected was not a travelling one—that
the nature of the people’s avocations militated
against such an assumption—that even in
England branch lines constructed at so low a
cost as £B,OOO per mile in agricultural districts
far more thickly peopled than any rural por-
tion of Queensland, had been closed for lack
of traffic, or carried on only at a heavy loss.
The impossibility of a reliable estimate of cost
under the circumstances —especially over the
Range—was dwelt upon, and the necessity for
enquiry into the merits of the peculiar system
itself and its alleged advantages, was urged.
For a narrow gauge and light engines, were no


novelty—their application to the railway
traffic and speed assumed was. But fact and
argument were alike whistled down the wind,
and their most earnest exponents became
marks for that malevolence of suppression,
which was characteristic of Sir George
Bowen’s government, while his Ministry
seemed too strong to be shaken. That it did
seem so strong may be assumed from the
course it pursued on this very question.
For whatever may have been Mr. Fitzgib-
bon’s offences, either of commission or omission,
he found willing patrons, and it may be willing
tools. If he conceived the idea of that singu-
lar request to Sir Charles Fox, to report upon
his system under the implied promise that if
his report were favorable he would be the
gainer by the proceeds of the agency, the min-
istry—or the Minister—flew faster than he
could run. The request and the appointment,
and the profitable order all tumbled out of the
same envelope on Sir 0. Fox’s table. It was
not Mr. Fitzgibbon who in parliament pro-
mised an enquiry already made, and its answer
secured, and its payment provided for. It
was the Minister of the day who dinned the
recommendations of Sir Charles Fox and Mr.
Fitzgibbon from a distinguished member of
the British cabinet in the ears of an astounded
opposition. It was the Executive and Minis-
ter of the day, who standing in the Legislature,
declared that the works would be executed
under the estimated cost, with the full know-
ledge that they neither could nor would.
They knew of the increase of nine miles on
the range : they knew of the Bremer bridge
and Ipswich station: they knew of that ex-
traordinary scene in which Mr. Macalister by
a stroke of his pen added £60,000 to a contract,
and according to Mr. Fitzgibbon gave to Mr.
Wilcox £115,000 more than he ought to have
received. But although their financial mea-
sures for 1865 were before Parliament up to
nearly the middle of September 1864, and Mr,
Wilcox had distinctly shewn on the Ist
August, that if he took up the line it must be
at greatly increased cost, they’ were silent on
this most important matter, and left Parlia-
ment to suppose that nothing had been done
to impair the certainty of the lines being com-
pleted within the estimates. Whatever might
have been the extent of Mr. Fitzgibbon’s
craft in deluding the public they were still
more culpable. They endorsed his state-
ments, they insisted on his authority, they
provided and paid for one assumed to be
greater than his own, and they concealed his
errors and the alterations and expenses they
involved. And that they were successful we
know from the fact, that until the disputes
between engineer and contractor forced the
unwillingly given and apologetic report of
1866 from Mr. Fitzgibbon, both Parliament
and public were under the delusion that
nothing had been done to interfere with the
original arrangements. When the disclosures
came, they instituted no enquiry, they called
for no examination; but they affirmed his
absurd predictions of traffic to be correct, and
that the lines, to quote Mr. Macalister, would
“pay double that amount of interest,” that
amount being three-and-a-half per cent. Even
in June, 1866, that Minister declared that
unless Mr. Higginbotham’s award went against
the Government, the sums already voted
would cover the expenditure, and that Mr.
Fitzgibbon had “ discharged his duty faith-
fully and well, and carried out his contract to
the letter.” (Hansard 1866, p. 308.) Yet
allowing the £244.747 extra to Messrs. Peto,
Brassey, and Betts to be deducted from the
ultimate £1,234,206, for which the Toowoomba
lino figures, there is still an excess of £371,801
on that 78 miles of railway due to this faith-
ful and good engineer, and to the Government
by whom he was shielded, and in verification
of the literal discharge of their duties by both.
In truth, the Government either did not
know their duty or did not care to do it, and
by their contract with Mr. Fitzgibbon they
had erected a shelter for him against his own
default. There was indeed a great show of
energy, and quickness, and bustle, but it
went for very little in the end —just as a
badly placed log crackles and smokes, and
blazes up the chimney, while half the fuel
placed with judgment will throw out three
times the heat. And what was worse, there was,
until concealment availed no longer that sort
of misrepresentation, and withholding, and
illusion, which are more mischievous in their
consequences, and more discreditable to their
authors than downright falsehood. From the
engagement of Sir Charles Fox, to the final
division on the Warwick line, the railway
history of Queensland is a disgrace to the
colony, and a dishonor to the principal actors
in its transactions.
In considering the working of the lines, and
the advantages or losses that have resulted to
the community—which, almost of necessity,
includes their prospects—we start with
a repetition of the statement just made—
that the annual monetary loss may be
taken at £6OO per mile. When this fact is
adduced, what may be called the indirect
benefit argument is brought forward. The
increased facility and economy of transit for
passengers and goods is dwelt upon, increased
settlement is presumed, and then there is the
saving in the maintenance of common roads,
and in the conveyance of mails and prisoners.
And there appears great weight in the argu-
ment.


But it may bo that this increased economy
and facility of transit is more apparent than
real, and that, in fact, the burden has simply
been shifted from the district immediately
benefitted, to the shoulders of the community
at large. Let this be investigated. Take
the line from Ipswich to Dalby in 1868, the
last year of our official statistics. On that
line the passenger fares were £12,232, and
the receipts from the goods traffic £40,336,
in all £52,568. The interest on the loan for
that portion was £93,921, from which deduct
the surplus of £7,111 receipts over working
expenses and we have £86,810 to add to the
charges made to the passengers, and for goods
to make up the real cost of their conveyance.
This gives an increase of 165 per cent, to
these nominal fares. Take these for passen-
gers then as they were about that time—£l
second class to Toowooomba, £1 10s to Dalby.
They become £2 13s to Toowoomba, and £3
19s 6d to Dalby. If goods are charged £2 10s
to Toowoomba, and £3 15s to Dalby, the per
centage due to interest brings the cost up to £6
12s 6d per ton to Toowoomba and £9 18s 9d
to Dalby. Clean wool charged 11s from Dalby
to Ipswich becomes £1 9s 9d and charged 7s
6d from Toowoomba becomes 19s 10d, the
reader can pursue the calculation for himself.
But this fact is clear that of the cost of con-
veying goods and passengers on the line, 165
parts out of 265 are paid by the community at
large for the benefit of a comparatively small
portion. Thus the indirect benefit to those who
enjoy the advantage of the South Western
Bail way is compensated by a direct loss to
every other portion of the colony. By how
far the actual cost of transit has been lowered
if at all, those acquainted with the locality
can tell.
Pursue the inquiry a little further, and let us
see how this traffic of 1868 divides itself. The
number of passengers was 15,984. Take half
up and half down, and we get 7,992, which,
again divided by the 313 working days of the
year, gives us an average of say 26 down and
26 up per diem. Two Cobb’s coaches each
way would have carried the whole. Then
take the tonnage of g00d5—19,920 tons. Sup-
pose this to be divided into three parts, and
give one to the up traffic and two to the down,
t.e„ 13,280 tons down and 6,640 up. Again,
divide these quantities by the 313 working
days, and there results a traffic of little more
than 21 tons up and 42 tons down. How
many compact Victorian goods wagons would
it have taken to convey this very moderate
amount of traffic. What would Messrs. Cobb
& Co. take a contract for it for on a road in
moderate order now ? Would they ask, in
short, nearly £140,000 a year for doing so
moderate an amount of work ? The locomo-
tives sent out for the Main Range weigh thirty-
five tons. Were such ponderous engines really
wanted to drag 21 tons up and let 42 tons roll
down behind them? And, moreover, for this
small amount of traffic seventy-five managers,
clerks, and porters were employed, and ninety-
two mechanics and laborers kept. To what do
these facts—for facts they are—point ? Simply
that the Government began at the wrong end
—that they set about enquiring into the merits
of different railway systems, instead of care-
fully ascertaining whether our traffic required
any, or was likely for years to come to require
any; and how much different locomotives could
draw, when the real question was whether
we should have work enough for the least
powerful of the lot. “ Locomotive engines,
“ such as I propose to use,(a) capable of pass-
“ ing round curves of five chains radius will
“ draw, upon a level railroad, a gross load of
“ 160 tons at a speed of fifteen to twenty miles
“ an hour, a gross load of sixty-five tons up an
“ incline of one foot in a hundred, and of thirty-
“ five tons up an incline of one foot in forty.”
So said Mr. Fitzgibbon in 1863. In 1868 there
was not enough traffic to justify the employ-
ment of any one such locomotive. And if we
are not taught by the results of past procedure
to reverse its direction, and to find out what
there will be to carry before we discuss the
means of carriage we deserve to suffer as
severely again as we are doing now.
But we .are told that one of the indirect ad-
vantages of a railway is that it stimulates
settlement, ... It has done so in some
cases—has it done so in ours? What has the
Southern and Western Railway done towards
that end ? We turn to our statistics and we
find that settlement in the districts affected
by it has not increased more rapidly than in
districts altogether beyond its influence and
has not in fact kept pace with the average
progiess of the colony. From 1866 to 1868,
the agricultural settlement throughout
Queensland increased 43 per cent. Take the
districts of Dalby, Drayton and Toowoomba,
and Warwick, and the average of increase is 26
per cent.; while Warwick, the least affected by
the line of the whole, shows by far the great-
est advance. In the Logan, the district of
Woogaroo, and that of Maryborough, settle-
ment has increase from fifty to one hundred
per cent, and these have no railway. If we
take the value of property as far as it can be
ascertained, that seems to have been as little
influenced. In Dalby in 1866 the assesment
was £12,400, in 1868 £13,641 : in Drayton in
1866 £8,655, in 1868 £lO,OOO : in Toowoomba in
(a) They were to weigh II to 12 tons. The lightest on
the line is 16 tons. Besides these three goods locomotives
were purchased weighing either 350 r 38 tons. What for,
is not known, except to Sir C. Fox and Mr. .fitzgibbon.


(1866 £38,400 in 1868 £28,800, and in Warwick
in 1866 £13,742 as compared with £16,197 in
1868. And here again Warwick has been
least affected by the line, and Toowoomba of
all places, should have been most benefited.
All the declamation in the world won’t destroy
these facts. They stare us in the face and
they force upon us again and again the ques-
tion, for what does the country lose £6OO per
mile by its railways ? And the answer is,—to
benefit a few leading men who made use of
their political position to perpetrate a gross
political job, and found in Mr. Macalister a
willing coadjutor and leader as they might
very possibly do again for a similar object if it
suited his purpose. The exporters of wool
holding stations in contiguity to the lines are
those who profit by the facilities and economy
of transit on the railways—the community at
large pay the piper(a).
It has, however, been urged that the income
on the Southern and Western lines is increas-
ing fast—that the total receipts of 1868 were
more than those of 1867, and of 1869 more than
of 1868. If this he granted, the working
expenses have increased too. These last
bore a proportion to the receipts in 1866 (when
the navvies on the works had to be supplied
and only the line to Orandchester was open) of
thirty per cent. In 1867 they were eighty,
seven per cent., in 1868 nearly ninety per cent,,
and in 1869, calculating from the revenue
returns, eighty-three per cent. Take even the
working expenses at eighty per cent., and
when will the Toowoomba and Dalby line pay
the interest on the cost of its construction ?
When the receipts are £469,605 per annum,
for then the twenty per cent, of the total would
equal the amount of the loan. They must, in
fact, be at least six times what they now are;
and for the first six months of 1870 the re-
ceipts have declined to about those of 1868.
Population and trade are the bases of traffic,
but what prospect is there of the population
and trade of the districts through which the
Southern and Western linos run increasing
seven-fold. With all the pressure that could
be applied to stimulate immigration from 1861
to the close of 1866—and Queensland was
popular at home then—we could only add
about fifty thousand souls to our numbers.
How long may we be expected to take in add-
ing from five to six hundred thousand? And
(a) There seems indeed to have been some who have pro-
fited besides these gentlemen, as in the railway returns no
monies arq placed as received on account of what are
therein termed “ excess tares.” It is to be presumed that
they represent passengers with free tickets. In 1868 out of
14,016 second class passengers, 3187 were “excess fares;’*
in 1867 outof 14,974 there were 2,695. Of what may have
been done in the same way in the first class there seems no
record. But surely some explanation should be afforded
in this head.
that is the number we should want, assuming
the Southern and Western districts to take
their fair share of the increase.
It may be urged that the working expenses
will diminish as the traffic increases. Unfor-
tunately the line is not one which admits of
small working expenses. Its curves and its
gradients are never-ending sources of renewing
cost. But let it be admitted that they were
at once reduced to sixty per cent,, (and that all
who know the line know is as liberal a view as
can be taken of the matter) what then ? The
receipts must reach, even when that economy
is attained, nearly £235,000 a year, or at least
three times their present sum. How long
will the colony be in adding some two hundred
and fifty thousand to its numbers? And
besides, at present we see that the profit is
only seventeen per cent., and not forty. As to
any hope of great addition to be derived from
the existing population or its natural increase,
or any derived from their pursuits, that may
soon be disposed of. The rate of increase of
the staple product of the districts most affected
—that is of the sheep and cattle in the districts
of Condamine, Dalby, Drayton and Too-
woomba, Leyburn, Warwick, and Nanango—
has been gradually falling. In 1867 sheep in-
creased twenty five per cent, on their number
in 1866. In 1868 the rate of increase on 1867
was only eight. Cattle decreased ten per cent,
in the two years. And we have the testimony
of Mr. Miles that the system of fencing now
in fashion is reducing the population by one
half. These facts are not suggestive of a
three-fold or six-fold increase in stock or of a
three-fold or six-fold trade or population, or of
a large amount of agricultural and exportable
produce. All this may be very disagreeable,
but then it is true. There are the facts, and
they are not to be got rid of.
And they again point to the folly of making
costly provision to-day for wants which may
not be experienced for the next quarter of a
century. Every year that the debt of the rail-
way exceeds its earnings, by so much have the
general resources of the colony been lessened,
and its power of progress in other respects and
in other districts destroyed. Eor the interest
on the capital goes out of the colony and
every sixpence taken by taxation and sent
away from us is so much taken from our savings
and so much deducted from our capital stock.
If we had communication between Ipswich and
the Downs at half the cost the system adopted
has involved, we should not have to squabble
over the best substitute for the ad valorem
duties to find money to pay interest in London
on loans wasted here.
When we come to consider the propriety of
extensions we are met by four proposals :—l,
the extension of the existing line to Brisbane :


2, further extension to Roma : 3, an extension
of the Northern Railway to the Dawson; and
4, an idea, rather than a proposal, of a line
commencing somewhere and ending at the
Gulf of Carpentaria.
With regard to the first three, it would seem
that if the state is to take any monetary re-
sponsibility in connection with them, the same
conditions may be applied to all. Would they
of themselves be remunerative? or would the
extent to which they would increase the
revenue of existing lines be such as to justify
risking the probability of loss arising from
their own construction ?
The Cost of a line from Ipswich to Brisbane
ought not to exceed £150,000. The evidence
of skilled and experienced engineers—men of
experience gained in the construction and
Working of similar lines before the Com-
mittee of the Assembly of New South Wales
this present year proves that that amount
should be ample for a line not more than 22
miles or 23 miles long. The annual interest
on that sum at five per cent.—and more ought
not now to be offered—would be £7500. To
pay itself, if its working expenses could be
maintained at sixty per cent., it should have a
traffic receipt of £18,750 per annum. If, on
the contrary, the working expenses were
eighty per cent., the traffic receipt should be
£37,500. What are the probabilities ? If
20,000 tons—the amount carried on the main
line in 1868 —were carried on this at similar
rates, the}' would yield £lO,OOO. If as many
passengers travelled on the line as did on the
main one in 1868, that at a fare of 4s. each
would give £3OOO. There is then to be con-
sidered what the local traffic would be as well.
And, lastly, comes the question how far the
extension to Brisbane would increase the
traffic on the main line. These are all points
on which no one parson could give a reliable
opinion. The facts bearing upon each would
have to be collected from many and diverse
quarters ; and before any line was finally re-
solved upon, it would be prudent to take evi-
dence, not only upon them, hut on the probable
engineering cost and the working expenses.
The navigable river argument and the head
ot the navigation quibble may be tossed into
the same waste paper basket. The Brisbane
River is not navigable in the general sense of
the term beyond a short distance above Bris-
bane itself, and the head of the navigation is
unapproachable by what in these days are
ordinarily spoken of as seagoing vessels.
Those who have studied the history of steam
travelling know, moreover, that a very common
result from the construction of railways along-
side a river is, that the traffic on the river in-
creases. There is not a navigable river of any
importance in England that has not from one
to half-a dozen railways running in the samfe
direction.
The proposed Roma extension has been
already surveyed, and Mr. Fitzgibbon gave
the length of the line at J6B miles. The
lightest locomotive system, of which there are
reliable estimates, gives the cost at from £3OOO
to £4OOO per mile, not including rolling stock.
At £3500 per mile the outlay would be
£588,000, the interest on this sum at -5 per
cent, would be £29,400 per annum. If the
working expenses were as high as they now
are on the main line, this would require ah
annual traffic receipt of £147,000. If the
working expenses were only sixty per cent,,
the required receipt would be reduced to
£73,500. Which would be most likely, and
what probability is there of either being real-
ised? The whole of our existing railways
—north and south —hardly produce the latter
sum. Will the Western Maranoa and that
portion of the Warrego whose traffic might be
caught, yield as much ? It would be a long
line running through and into a very thinly
populated country, and the probability is that
the working expenses would be high. As to
the promotion of settlement that result may
be questioned. The tendency of settlement as
shown by the working of the Land Act and
the increase of agriculture, is to concentrate
population nigh existing centres. And, more-
ovet, remote occupation is far from a certain
good, especially when there is room for more
beneficial settlement in the nearer districts ( a)
The extension to the Dawson would be 30
miles in length. Assuming it to be con-
structed on the most economic plan and at
about £5OOO a mile, that would involve a capi-
tal of £150,000 and an interest of £7500.
Would that extension secure the whole of the
downward traffic, and would that convert the
loss of £l6OO a year on the present line into a
gain ? The present total receipts are about
£4OOO per annum. Add to the £7500 the
£l6OO and there would be wanted £9lOO a year
profit on the Whole line to pay interest on the
new construction and stop the annual loss on
the old one. This Would demand, if the work-
ing expenses are taken at 80 pet cent., a traf-
fic receipt of £45,500 per annum, if at 60 per-
cent. £22,750. The probability of such a re-
sult can only be ascertained by taking the
evidence Of those well acquainted with all the
circumstances.
The advocates of immediate extension some-
times talk of land grants to capitalists to
induce them to construct the lines. Mrs.
Glasse’s recipe immediately springs to rec 'l-
(a) The suggestion of guarantee is practically one to
borrow money. Whether interest is paid to a contractor
on his capital, or to some one else to pay him, is simply the
difference between tweedledum and tweedledee.


lection —first catch your capitalist. The great
bulk of the land available would not be worth
ten shillings an acre for gradual governmental
and classified sale. A capitalist taking it
would deduct from its assumed present value
a sura equivalent to the loss he would sustain
by loss of interest in the interval between
taking and realization. He would, of course,
not forget the competition from the working
of our land laws. At ten shillings an acre the
Roma line, costing £588,000, would require one
million one hundred and seventy-six thousand
acres. Is that quantity of good land conti-
guous to the line, and how is it to be taken?
If all of it is to be given to the contractor the
state will not be able to sell any until his
reserves are disposed of. If the proposition is
for alternate blocks there will inevitably be a
contest between the tendency of our land laws
to keep prices low and the contractors interest
to keep prices high. And, after all, it is set-
tlement that renders land valuable, and settle-
ment cannot be forced. Emigrants may be
brought to Queensland, but they cannot be
compelled to go to a particular district. As
to the laborers on a railway forming a popula-
tion, experience furnishes two difficulties in
the way of that result. Those employed on
the Southern and Western line did not settle,
and navvies do not make good farmers, and
are generally averse to change of employment
and to fixity of abode. Agricultural laborers
are expensive navvies. Thus there will either
not be the class likely to settle ; or, if they
come then the cost of construction will be
increased from their want of skill. In fact,
the farther the inquiry is pushed the greater
the difficulties become, and equally so the
necessity for extended and rigid investigation.
And the necessity for this course in all the
instances enumerated is the more insisted
upon because of the common tendency of
members of parliament to suppose and to act
upon the supposition, that in themselves they
comprise all that is required. To hear some
honorable members, one would imagine that
they were competent to become at once wit-
nesses, advocates, and Judges. In reality
they place themselves in a very false and a
most indefensible position. The position of a
legislator is a deliberative one. When ques-
tions of technical and local fact are involved
of the precise nature and bearing of which he
must necessarily be primarily ignorant it is
his duty to seek for information, and when
that is obtained he has grounds on which to
form a judgment. Without the adoption of
such a course, every decision oi the legislature
is a leap in the dark. Hence, in so momentu-
ons a matter as our railway procedure has
become, it is surely as necessary for the protec-
tion of the parliament itself as well as of the
interests of the whole colony that no step be
finally resolved upon without full enquiry and
the eliciting of those facts which are indispen-
sihle to the formation of a just and honest
and intelligent decision. The Imperial par-
liament will not permit a company of pro-
prietors to risk their own capital without full
and stringent enquiry into every particular
connected with a proposed railway. Our
legislature are the trustees of our monies.
What the home legislature do as a matter of
duty to protect others we may surely and if
right insist upon our public trustees doing to
protect ourselves. That they have scanda-
lously failed in this hitherto supplies no argu-
ment for future dereliction ; nor need we, with
the experience recorded in the narrative, be
very reticent in insisting that we do not from
like negligence suffer like losses again. Why
should our representatives squabble for an hour
over the salary of a pound a week to a forlorn
messenger and refuse time to consider of and
direct the honest and necessary detailed ap-
propriation of a million sterling to a railway ?
The railway to the Gulf of Carpentaria con-
cerning which so much has been said and
written, can scarcely be treated as a proposal,
for nothing has yet been put forward to take
it beyond what in modern phraseology is some-
times called “ an idea.” As such it is no new
thing; Dr. Lang long ago suggested it. Five or
six years since Mr. J. Watts alluded to it in the
Queensland Assembly, and Mr, Lilley ex-
pressed his hope of seeing such a “magnifi-
cent project” realised. The shape in which it
is now presented is somewhat altered, but the
alteration or addition is as much wanting in
novelty as the main suggestion. Grants of
land in alternate sections along a railway as
inducements to a Company to undertake its
construction originated, in the United States,
and have been tried in these colonies but
without success. And the objections urged to
the grant system as applied to the Roma
line apply with ten-fold force to this. Were it
not that Mr. Macalister is a gentleman subject
more than most men to spontaneous conversion
it would be difficult to conceive him an advocate
of any such procedure. Speaking of such a plan
in 1864, he observed, that experience proved the
application of the principle to have resulted in
entire failure in America, “The piinciple
had also been proved to be a bad one on the
railway in South Australia,” and “as to rais-
ing a loan on the land reserved, no capitalist
would advance a sixpence.” ( Hansard , 1864.)
Presuming the line to run through the
Queensland territory and to be connected
with the main lines to the three capitals.
Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, there would
not be less than 2000 miles of railway. Now,
whatever, might be the economy of one near


the coast, a line commencing three or four hun-
miles from a port, and running, for the most
part, through almost uninhabited country,
must necessarily be subject to the extra ex-
pense which conveyance of all imported mate-
rial and most of the necessaries of life for long
distances would involve. For anything in the
shape of an ordinary railroad £5,000 per mile
on such a line would be a moderate estimate.
Two thousand miles at £SOOO a mile amounts
to ten millions sterling, and ten millions ster-
ling is a formidable sum to provide for a single
object, no matter what money market may be
applied to or what security may be tendered.
The interest on that amount would be half a
million per annum—who is to guarantee that ?
For as to the revenue from the land providing
it, any one offering such a scheme would find
that Mr. Macalister was correct—“ no capital-
ist would advance a sixpence.” And where
is the traffic to come from that would produce
a clear profit to so large an amount ?
The answer to that question at once shows
the impossibility of the suggestion being taken
up in any other shape than as an intercolonial
project. If by the opening of the Suez Canal
the trade routes from Europe to these colonies
are diverted to the North, and a port on the
Gulf of Carpentaria becomes that of arrival
and departure for the Australian trade, with
whom will that trade be principally done?
There is but one reply—with the older and
wealthier communities of Victoria and New
South Wales and South Australia. It is not
to be supposed that these colonies, or either of
them, would lend a helping hand to any scheme
which, having brought the traffic in a line with
Koma, coolly turned it four or five hundred
miles out of its course to Brisbane, there to
await transhipment to the Southern capitals.
With the Queensland trade alone, the railway
to the Gulf is an impossibility, for admitting
that the length would be shortened to some
eleven or twelve hundred miles, there would
still be from five to six millions of capital to
provide, and between three and four hundred
thousand a year interest to meet. Our trade
would do literally nothing towards such a re-
quirement, The concurrence of our neighbors
is at least as important to us as ours is to them,
but that concurrence will never be obtained
without an adequate share of control. As an
intercolonial scheme the railway to the Gulf
may at any rate obtain serious discussion—as
a purely Queensland enterprise it will scarcely
get beyond what it now is—an idea, and
nothing more.
The imaginative facilities of ex-ministerial
engineers are not precisely those which find
credence with the British capitalist, and the
day of prescient surveys before instructions
and estimates before surveys have gone by—
at least for all practical purposes. But a reli-
able survey for a railway through the country
over which one to the Gulf would pass would
be no very cheap process. There would be
great difficulty, no small privation, and not a
little danger. The price which Mr. Fitzgibbon
demanded and got for his comparatively easy
work would scarcely tempt competent engi-
neers to run trial lines across the interior of
Australia. On the Queensland portion alone
a hundred thousand pounds would not more
than meet the cost. And that is a sum of
money not to be expended upon a chance.
Besides are we so sure that in the Queensland
portion ten or twelve millions of acres of
really good land, available for profitable settle-
ment and free from floods will readily be found ?
Undoubtedly the time is approaching for the
consideration of the matter—that is, if the
Suez Canal proves a permanent success, and
if the economy of freight by its use proves so
great as to counterbalance the cost of over-
land conveyance from the Gulf to the chief
centres of population, and to defy the com-
petitive efforts of an existing and powerful
shipping interest besides—a question of the
highest importance in the discussion of this
subject, but one which being practical has
seemingly escaped the attention of the pro-
phetic railway mongers of the day. Moderate
railway charges are practicable only with a
very large amount of traffic, and European
fares demand European trade. Colonial rates
would be prohibitive. What would he the
traffic? And here again we are driven back
to real and accurate investigation—to enquiry
which is in fact beyond our power, and in
which the assistance of our neighbors is indis-
pensable ; for we can decide neither upon their
requirements nor their opinions as to the best
mode of supplying them. Viewed in what-
ever light it legitimately can be, the project—
if project it can be called—depends for its
realization upon the united action of the colo-
nies. It has perhaps arrived at a stage which
might justify correspondence between the
colonial governments, beyond that indispensa-
bly initiatory step we have no means to go.
The Pacific line of railway affords no appo-
site precedent. A railway with a population
of millions at one end, and a State numbering
already more than all the Australias at the
other, and which has a traffic described (with
what truth we know not, but still described) as
already very great and remunerative, is
opposed, in almost every preliminary condition,
to that proposed from the Gulf to the South.
And, moreover, it is to be remembered that all
these American railways were necessarily in-
struments of settlement. They resulted from
the pressure of an incrowding of immigrants,
upon the earlier and closely peopled states. It


was a necessity to pass them on. But even so
the list of failures from unadvised haste
was long and grievous. Who does not re-
member Sydney Smith’s pungent appeal to the
** drab colored men of Pensylvania” and the
repudiation and loss and dishonor and suffer-
ing which these failures involved ? In Ame-
rica, the railways have been the effect of popu-
lation—a population which they simply distri-
buted. Where is ours to distribute? Have
fifty of the men who came to be employed on
the Southern and Western line settled in its
vicinity? Where are they ?
Equally applying to all these proposed exten-
sions are other and essential considerations.
In our anxiety to extend the boundaries of
settlement we are apt to overlook the just
rights of those who have already settled.
There is a duty due by the state to those who
have taken up lands and are industriously
occupied in bringing them under profitable
cultivation—a duty beyond and above that of
hastening a multitude into the wilderness, to
shake themselves as they best may into a con-
dition foreign to their habits and their powers.
We have within our settled districts and along
the coast hundreds of families who have
entered anew upon the struggle of life, and
under new and hard conditions. The small
capitalist has taken the axe in his hand and
become a laborer—his laborers are hewing
their way to the acquisition of means where-
with to render their homestead selections
something more than a name. In West More-
ton. in East Moreton, along the Mary, on the
fringes of the coast, on the outskirts of our
gold fields, on the western slopes of the Main
Kange the smoke of the clearing and the crash
of falling timber tell the traveller that men
are grappling with their allotted task, to
replenish the earth and subdue it. Many a
field will wave white with cotton in the autumn
that is to come. Many a farmer now counts the
minutes for the warmth of the fading winter sun
on his sugar, and new industries fill his reveries
while waiting for the harvest that shall
give him means to try their value. These
men form a very large portion of our popula-
tion ; they are multiplying day by day; they
are proving to an important and valuable sec-
tion of the emigrating community—the class
of small means and moderate aspevatives and
untiring industry—what good things small
means aided by untiring industry can achieve.
Why are these men to be taxed to supply
railroads in districts with which they have,
and can have, no more than a very general
interest, and still to be left without a passable
track their own doors. Surely when men
talk of population as the basis of representa-
tion they might recollect too that represeuta-
t tion is, or should be, for the good of those re-
presented, and that the provision of non paying
railroads to accommodate one-fifth of the com-
munity at the cost and to the injury of the
other four-fifths is not one calculated to serve
the real purposes for which representative
Government is supposed to exist. What is,
after all, the most efficient promotion of settle-
ment? —Proof that it is profitable. What is
an essential to profitable settlement?—Ease
and cheapness of communication. Who are
most entitled to have this?—They who provide
the most means. Who provide the most means ?
—They who furnish the bulk of our taxation.
And who are left most destitute of this essen-
tial facility ?—The settlers and agriculturists
of our settled districts who are rapidly be-
coming the main stay of our towns population,
and who as yet have recognised the footsteps of
Government by the sound of the tax-gatherer’s
tread. We have one railway at an annual loss
of £6OO per mile, and hardly a mile of cross
country road on which £6OO has been spent.
Undoubtedly gross injustice was done to the
northern districts, when the means of the
whole colony were exhausted in the provision
of a costly work, from which they can never
derive a halfpennyworth of benefit. But the
great bulk of the settlers in the districts east
of Ipswich and north and south of the South-
ern and Western line of railway are, as yet, in
like evil case. The railroad to Toowoomba
makes itself felt by the sugar grower of Pim-
pama and the cotton farmer of the Peak Moun-
tain in the shape of ad valorem duties. That
is an injustice which should not bear repetition
and need not. We may close the account of
general loans and arrange future ones on an
equitable principle If there is to be a railway
between Ipswich and Brisbane and losses arise
upon it, tax the districts benefitted. If feeder
lines are required, let it be known that the
people who will gain the advantage, must be
prepared to contribute towards its provision.
Economy and prudence will then go hand in
hand. The very certainty that the loss aris-
ing from unwise expenditure will fall upon
themselves, w ill make men careful in both in-
curring and supervising outlay. Thus provis-
sion will not run ahead of want, and settlement
will concentrate around convenience: the cost
of Government will be less and its efficiency
greater than could possibly be the case where
population is widely spread and communica-
tion between the scattered atoms difficult and
uncertain.
It is, however, necessary to close these obser-
vations. Something might perhaps have been
said on the different and economic schemes
of railways and tramways which have been
and are being daily suggested. But this
would have involved a technical investigation
more tedious than beneficial. Here, however,


as well as in the matters just referred to, the
necessity for full inquiry, and, if need appears,
even for experiment cannot be too strongly
insisted upon. What may be suggested by
anxious contractors to a receptive minister
can properly have no effect on the ultimate
decision. The legislature is the only autho-
rity by which expenditure can be made.
Power implies responsibility. It is their duty
to see that expenditure efficiently applied.
And they can only do this by in the first in-

stance carefully sifting both the wants alleged
and the means proposed formeeting them; and
in the second, vigilantly watching the faithful
appropriation of what they provide. That is
a duty they cannot honestly delegate. Had
these things been done at the initiation
and during the progress of the railway
system of 1863, the colony would not have
been burdened with debt, and the history
that system compels, could never have been
written.
