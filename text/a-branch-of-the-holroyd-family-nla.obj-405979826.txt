TO EDWARD DUNDAB HOLROYD, ESQ.. Q.C.
AT MELBOURNE, IN THE COLONY OF VICTORIA.
Wimbledon, August 1879.
My dear Edward,
Having resided, like yourself, for many years in
the East, I can quite understand your desire to preserve the
remembrance of your elder English relatives, and to know
something of the generation which has arisen since you
quitted the old country. I have endeavoured to assist you
by drawing up a short sketch of the history of the family,
and collecting a few particulars which seemed to me worthy
of being recorded, concerning several of its members. At your
request, I have introduced some incidents of my own life,
which I should otherwise have omitted. I trust the pamphlet
may prove useful as a family chronicle, and may enable you
to transmit some interesting memorials to your descendants
in Australia.
I am
My dear Edward,
Your very affectionate Uncle,
THOMAS HOLROYD.

{Appendix A)
MR. JUSTICE HOLROYD BY LORD BROUGHAM.
Extract from “ The Edinburgh Review lB39.
Mr. Justice Holroyd was one of the most able, most learned, and most
virtuous men that ever in any age adorned the profession of the Law.
Endowed with feeble spirits, and having never cultivated the gifts of
fancy, and probably not possessing any range of imagination, he chose
for his study the severer branches of forensic exertion; and by assiduous
labour long bestowed upon that dry study, became possessed of all the
knowledge of our jurisprudence which industry can acquire, and the
greatest natural sagacity marshal. Until the Practice is added to the
study of the law, the most diligent student cannot be said to have made
himself a good lawyer; nor can he even ascertain whether or not he is
destined ever to attain that eminence. After he began to plead below
the bar, which is the particular branch of the profession that tends more
directly than any other to unfold and to improve the faculties leading to
this most desirable station, he soon became known for the conscientious
application of his powers and his knowledge to the business he was en-
trusted with • and both his pupils benefitted largely by his instructions,
and his clients were comforted with a full and ready assistance in all
their difficulties. When he had attained considerable reputation in this
walk, he entered Westminster Hall; and soon rose to the first eminence
upon that great circuit which distributes the streams of justice from the
centre of the judicial system, through the vast counties of York and
Lancaster, and the four northern provinces.
It was soon found that this distinguished person was far indeed from
being a mere special pleader. He possessed a clearness and quickness
of apprehension, a vigour and firmness of understanding, a just and be-
coming confidence in his own opinion, that shone through his natural
modesty—a modesty singularly graceful, and allied to a most amiable
and gentle nature, which neither the contentions of the forum could
roughen, nor the severest of studies harden. To whatever branch of in-
vestigation he had devoted his life, in that he would have eminently


excelled; and as in the stricter sciences lie would have been a great dis-
coverer, so he might be truly said to have a genius for law. His views
were profound, and they were original. He saw points in a light that
was unexpected and felicitous. But he reasoned, and he decided upon
no affected conceits, such as Westminster Hall terms crotchets, or fancies,
or whims. His admirable judgment always maintained its sway ; and
his opinion upon all matters submitted to him was still more remarkable
for being sound than his reasonings were for being learned and ingenious.
A result of all this great merit, which did more honour to him than to
the other branch of his profession, was, that although no one enjoyed so
high a legal reputation, few gained their professional income with harder
labour. Whenever a difficult and important question arose, Mr. Holroyd’s
opinion was eagerly sought upon all the cases which grew out of it, or
became connected with it; and when ordinary matters of easy solution
came into dispute, or where opinions upon questions of course were to
be taken in point of form, or where causes were coming into court of
which any one could settle the pleadings, or conduct the minor depart-
ments of the suit after it came into court, others were selected to per-
form the easy, every-day, lucrative work; the love of a little patronage
operating on the attorney’s mind more than a sense of justice. Nothing
was more common, therefore, than to see this great lawyer answer eight
or ten questions upon the construction of a cramp and obscure will; or
the course of action fit to be pursued in seeking for the establishment
of complicated rights; or the course of pleading most safe in defending
nice positions; while ordinary men were in the’ same time reaping the
golden harvest of ordinary business, presenting no kind of difficulty, and
level to the most humble capacity.
In Court, he of course shone less than in Chambers. His figure was
low, but his voice was pleasing; until interrupted by an affection of the
trachea, which gave him a kind of constant cough for many years, and
at last terminated his valuable life. His delivery was, if not striking or
commanding, perfectly correct and natural. His style of argument was
of the very highest order, although somewhat less venturous in topics
than it ought to have been with so great a jurisconsult, or rather steer-
ing too near the defined and bold coast of authority. But his language
was choice; his order lucid; his argumentation close; his discussion of
cases, and his application of them, masterly;—showing an easy famili-
arity with all principles and all points, whether recondite or of common
occurrence; and a profound judgment in weighing differences and re-
semblances, and tracing analogies and consequences, which was in vain
sought for elsewhere. His famous argument in the case of Parliamentary


Privilege * is truly a masterpiece. The history of the law is there
traced through the stream of cases with a superior hand, while the
bearings of all authority in favour of the argument are given, with a
felicity only equalled by the dexterity with which the adverse cases are
got rid of, and their force dissipated. The taste, withal, considering the
exciting nature of the subject, is throughout severely chaste; nor can
the most fastidious critic descry a spot whereon to fix for blame ; while
the most zealous enemy of Parliamentary oppression cannot find any
ground for complaint in the strenuous exertions of the advocate.
Arguments like these at once control the judge, as if they came from a
higher authority ; edify the party in whose cause they are urged ; diffuse
the useful light of information among the profession; and conserve pure
and untainted the most refined taste in composition.
Although the habits of this illustrious lawyer did not often place him,
and never voluntarily, in the position of a leader, it yet would occasion-
ally happen that he might conduct some cause of importance before a
jury; and then his admirable judgment, ready knowledge of his subject,
and all its legal relations, correct taste, and inimitable suavity of temper,
united all voices in his praise. His arrangement of the subject, and his
diction, were alike perfect; what he wanted in the vigour of declamation,
to which he made no pretension, was amply supplied by the combined
force of his reasoning and by his luminous statement of facts; nor was
he ever engaged in causes which demanded resources of wit or of pathos,
the only portions of the rhetorical art to which he neither laid any
claim, nor could find substitutes in his own proper stores.
In his conduct at the bar, whether at consultation or in court, whether
as a leader or a junior and pleader, he was perfect. No man was more
respectful to his leaders when a junior; none less assuming when he
led. But though never wanting in courtesy, whichever station he filled,
he never failed firmly to assert his own opinion, whether as to the law
of the case or the discretion of conducting it, when he had a leader; nor
to act with the entire resolution that belonged to his responsible position
when he led himself. In every instance, however, the cause and the
client were observed to be his sole object. To advance them was always
his aim; to put himself forward, never. The most happy illustrations,
the most sound legal topics, were suggested by him quietly, almost
secretly, to his leader; from whose far less learned lips came forth, as if
they had been his own, the sense of Mr. Holroyd; who, so far from
giving the least indication of the sources whence the point had come,
only said a word in its support when absolute necessity required.
* See Burdett v. Abbot, East 14.


Having long adorned the bar, he was raised to the bench, chiefly, it
was believed, through the exertions of Lord Ellenborough, who had
known him intimately, and had always felt for him unbounded respect
and esteem. As a Judge, he fully sustained the high character which
he carried with him from the forum. When he sat at Nisi Prius, it was
delightful to see the familiar ease with which he handled all points that
could be made before him, come they ever so unexpectedly upon
him, or be they ever so much out of the everyday course of business.
The manner, too, in which he dealt with them attracted especial
admiration. ‘Sir,’ said Mr. Sergeant Hullock, captivated with this,
‘he is like one of the old men, the great fountains of our law.’—‘But
with a good sense and a just taste, rather belonging to our age than
‘to theirs,’ was the proper and correct addition of one to whom
the Sergeant’s remark had been addressed. The only defect which
any one could charge on his judicial performances, was that from
which it is so difficult for any one to be free who has been raised to the
bench from behind the bar, and without the experience of leading causes.
He cannot well take the larger and more commanding view of cases,
which the leader naturally adopts, and to which he confines himself
rather than to details. Hence, at least before experience of trying
many causes has lent such lawyers expertness, they feel some difficulty
in grappling with large and complicated cases ; are apt to lose them-
selves in particulars ; and are found unable to dispose of more than a
very limited number of causes, however well they may try those which
they are able to dispatch. To this remark Mr. Justice Holroyd formed
no exception. While no man tried a great case better, few so well, he
would suffer a heavy cause paper to fall into arrear, from not apportion-
ing his labour justly amongst the more important and more trivial
matters. Indeed, except Lord Tenterden, and one or two of the latter
judges raised to the bench before the habits of the pleader had been
formed, there are hardly to be found any exceptions to the rule which
we have stated, as deduced from long experience of the profession.
Than this eminent and excellent person, no man was more beloved in
private life, or could be more justly prized in all its relations. Of the
strictest integrity, of unsullied professional honour, of the most sweet
and equal temper, whether amidst the cares of private life (nor was he
unacquainted with both its sorrows and difficulties), or in the discharge
of his public duties as a magistrate, exposed to the wranglings of the
bar, or in the part which he so long took as an advocate among all the
contentions of the forum, his good-humour was constant and unruffled ;
so much so, that it seemed to cost him no effort at all either to exercise


unwearied patience on the bench, or to command his suavity of temper
at the bar. Of his valuable arguments, and of his learned and luminous
judgments, the monuments remain in the ‘Term Reports’ for the last
thirty years of his life; of his eminently expressive countenance, at once
sagacious, thoughtful, and mild, a likeness remains in Reynolds’ portrait
and print. It is only speaking the sense of all Westminster Hall to add,
that, as his loss was deeply felt by the profession, so it will be very long
indeed, in all probability, before such a great luminary of the law shall
arise to shed a light over its dark precincts, and to exalt the glory of the
bar. (See also Foss’s Lives of the Judges.)

Rough as two pines without, as sweet within,

And Wood * a neat compendium of the Law.
Fashioned with feet of clay—but head of gold,
A compound image he, like that of old,
True as the season came, “paired off” from town,
And here in friendly union posted down.
So as is sung in verse or prose,

.Sacreh to the JRemorg of
MARY ANNE, Wife of Captain CHARLES COURT,
Marine Surveyor-General, and Eldest Daughter of George Sowley
Holroyd, Esq., Barrister of Gray’s Inn, who departed this life on the
14th May, 1813, aged 24 years.
If worth were to he estimated by the unspeakable grief of a discon-
solate Husband, and the deep and unfeigned regret of all who had the
happiness of her acquaintance, hers would rank high indeed, but, alas !
she has fled from erring judgment to that Tribunal which alone can
duly appreciate the mild and gentle virtues which adorned her amiable
mind.
Extract —“ Madras Government Gazetted the 18 th October, 1821.
On Sunday, the 9th of September, about half-past four o’clock, at his
house at Ballygunge, departed this life Captain Charles Court, of the
Honorable Company’s Bombay Marine Establishment, and Marine
Surveyor General of India; and on the following day his remains were
removed under a discharge of Minute Guns from the Honorable Comp-
any’s Surveying Ship “ Meriton,” and were received and escorted to the
place of Interment by a large Detachment of His Majesty’s 87th Regi-
ment, Commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Shaw, C. 8., and interred with the
Military Honours due to his rank.
The early services of the beloved and lamented Officer in question,
are best described by the following testimony borne to his merits by the
able and justly respected late Superintendant of the Bombay Marine,
W. T. Money, Esq., (now one of the Honorable Court of Directors,) in
his address to that Government under date of the 15th July, 1809.
“Upon this occasion, Honourable Sir, I have to discharge a very
“ pleasing part of my duty in bringing to your notice the services and
“ merits of a very respectable Officer.
“ Lieutenant Court after acquiring a knowledge of his profession in
“ the East India Service was appointed to the Honourable Company’s
“Marine in the year 1790, and served as second Lieutenant of the
“ ‘Panther’ on a cursory Survey of the Red Sea, under Lieutenant


“White, and in the same station on hoard the Bombay Frigate ‘Com-
“ modore Pickett,’ he was actively engaged in the reduction of Colombo
“ and its dependencies.
“As first Lieutenant of the same ship he gallantly served at the re-
“ duction of Manado on Celebes, and was appointed to the Command of
“Fort Amsterdam, which he held for nine months under the most
“ critical circumstances, in a hostile country.
“In reward of his distinguished merits in this trying situation, he
“ was appointed President at Manado and Commandant of all the British
‘ Troops on Celebes.
“ During the period of his Command in this important post which he
“ held for seven years he completely succeeded in conciliating the vast
“population of that valuable Island, and attaching all ranks to the
“ British Government; having by the personal influence which his own
“ conduct had acquired for him, accomplished a treaty with all the chiefs
“ by which very considerable advantages were secured to the Honourable
“ Company, and many barbarous customs, which tended to render a
“people, naturally mild and inoffensive, cruel and vindictive, were
“ solemnly abandoned.
“ Had peace not restored to the Dutch their possessions to the East-
“ ward, Manado would have been rendered by Mr. Court’s prosperous
“administration a valuable acquisition to the East India Company.
“ Upon the restoration of the Malaccas Lieutenant Court returned to
“the active duties of his profession, and in Command of the ‘Princess
“ Augusta ’ with a small squadron he blockaded Severndroog where he
“ captured thirty-six vessels, seven of the largest of which he cut from
“ under the guns of the fort, and obtained restitution of a Dow laden
“ with Company’s coffee to a considerable amount.
“ From this Station he was recalled and selected to command the
“Honourable Company’s Ship- ‘Ternate’ in pursuit of ‘La Fortune,’
“‘Monsieur La Meme,’ who had recently captured the ‘Fly,’ but upon
“ his arrival at Bombay he found that the enemy was a prize to his
“ Majesty’s Ship ‘ Concorde.’
“Lieutenant Court was then, at particular request, appointed to
“Command the ‘Panther,’ and proceeded with Lord Yalentia to the
“ Red Sea where he prosecuted a tedious, an arduous, and a difficult
“ survey of the Abyssinian Coast with great credit to himself and perfect
“ satisfaction to his Lordship.
“Soon after his return to Bombay in 1807, he was selected to be my
« Assistant, and from his attention, assiduity, and ability, I have derived
“ such valuable aid in the discharge of my public duties, that I part


“ from Mr. Court’s services with the utmost regret, and shall ever hold
“ them in thankful remembrance.”
Captain Court, while in England, married one of the Daughters of
the present Sir George Holroyd, a young lady whose personal attractions
were only surpassed by her unassuming virtues and superior mental
attainments.
In the year 1810, Captain Court was appointed by the Honourable
Court of Directors Marine Surveyor-General of India, for which import-
ant office his superior abilities rendered him particularly qualified, and
he arrived at Calcutta in the following year.
In the year 1813, he had the misfortune to lose his inestimable
Partner, and from that period to the day of the termination of his own
earthly career he shrunk from the world’s observation, and never re-
gained the wonted serenity of his mind nor the vigour of his faculties.
The above inadequate sketch of the virtues and worth of the deceased
are humbly recorded as an unfeigned tribute of affectionate regard for
his memory, by those who revered him while living and who will never
cease to deplore his loss.

Account of the Action of the 3rd July, 1810, between the Ceylon,
Windham, and Astell, East Indiamen, and two large French
Frigates and a Corvette; copied from the Log of the llcfaour-
ahle C S. Astell, by G. C. H.
At day-light three strange sail in sight bearing N.E. close hauled on
the larboard tack. Called the hands out, beat to quarters, and cleared
ship for action. At four minutes past seven signal to prepare for battle,
shortened sail, Commodore (Ceylon) under top sails ; at eighteen minutes
past seven signal to keep in the Commodore wake, bore up to get in the
Commodore wake ; at half-past seven signal to haul the wind on the
starboard tack ; at thirty-five minutes past seven land bearing E. half N.
the three strangers on the larboard tack bearing N.E. by N. distant
seven miles; at twenty minutes past eight Ceylon made the private
signal; at thirty-five minutes past eight signal to number strange sail
seen; at Bh. 40 m. signal to wait the attack of the enemy; at 8h.45 m.
signal that the strangers are enemies ; at 9 h. 16 m. two of the strangers
were bearing W. by N. distant six or seven miles; at 9h. 30 m. the


third stranger wore and loosed top gallant sails; at 9h.55 m. blowing
fresh, took in main top gallant sail, and made signal to Ceylon that we
were over-pressed with sail and not able to keep company on that ac-
count; at 10 h. 15 m. signal to continue our course under easy sail; at
10 h. 35 m. took in main sail; at 10 h. 37 m. the Commodore telegraphed,
77, 942, 137, 546, 336, 85, 9, 864, 942, 354, 113, 337, 911, 243, 756,
61, 248, 875, 125, 865, 873, 37, 106, 539 ; at 11 h. 15 m. in third reefs
blowing; at 11 h. 25m. the Windham telegraphed the Commodore,
397, 942, 144, 51, 756, 942, 483, 335, 396, 940, 911, 866, 864, 437, 61,
251, 873, 507, 44; at noon, two of the strangers astern on the starboard
tack coming up, the smallest a Corvette, about three miles distant, car-
rying twenty-two guns, reconnoitring the fleet, the other six or seven
astern a very heavy frigate, and the third stranger bearing IST. by E.,
nine or ten miles, to appearance a frigate of the same description; at
12 h. 10 m. the Ceylon telegraphed in the following numbers, 308, 396,
456, 29, 531, 874, 800, 77, 873, 113, 99, 80, 760, 872, 25, 396 ; at 12 h.
30 m. the Ceylon bore up to come near us, at the same time the Corvette
about one mile distant wore to join the frigate that was astern, the
frigate about five miles off; at 12h. 36 m. signal to hoist same colours
as the Commodore with a pendant; at Ih. sm. the Corvette, three or
four miles astern, wore again; at Ih. 15 m. the frigate, on the starboard
tack, bearing ISLE, half N. nine or ten miles distant, tacked and stood
towards us under all sail; at Ih. 30 m. the Commodore hoisted the red
ensign and pendant, which we did also, the largest Frigate and Corvette
nearly two miles astern; at Ih. 45 m. the Ceylon made signal to keep
in close order closing towards the leading ship or van ; at 1 h. 55 m. the
Frigate on the larboard tack bearing N.ISLF. hoisted English colours, and
when she bore about S.S.W. tacked again to join her Consort; at 2h.
10 m. the largest Frigate and Corvette, on our weather quarter, distant
half-a-mile. The Frigate, after firing a gun to leeward, .hoisted French
colours, and immediately opened her fire upon us (the Ceylon and Wind-
ham ahead), which we returned, and continued in close action. The
Commodore and Windham firing upon her at the same time; about 3
the Corvette came into action, bore up under our stern, and raked us,
and took her station on our lee quarter, returned her fire with our after
larboard guns; at quarter-past 3 the Corvette bore up to get without
reach of our shot, we still continuing closely engaged with the Frigate.
The Ceylon and Windham still ahead, the Ceylon engaged and the
Windham firing as her guns would bear; at half-past 3 the red ensign
was shot away and gaff brought down, hoisted the blue ensign; at 3h.
40 m. p.m. Captain Hay was carried off the quarter deck severely


wounded in the thigh. At 4h. 15 m. the Ceylon dropped between us and
the enemy, and kept up a spirited fire. Ceased firing and backed the
main top sail to get clear of her, when we renewed the action. The
Frigate then made more sail and shot ahead firing into the Ceylon and
Windham as she passed, directing most of her fire on the Windham, and
after engaging her for a short time and getting a little ahead of her, the
Frigate wore right athwart our bows ; bore up with the intent to board,
but could not effect it, she haying too much way. When about half a
ship’s length from us we poured in a broadside and commenced a spirited
fire of musquetry fore and aft, which completely cleared her upper deck
and silenced her. She then hauled her wind on the larboard tack and
engaged the Ceylon as she passed. When astern of the Ceylon, the
Frigate tacked, and in stays her main and mizen top masts went over the
side. As soon as we saw this, hove all aback with the intention of board-
ing her a second time, but the Commodore and Windham drawing
ahead as we thought with a view of diverting the attention of the
Frigate that had not been into action and also the Corvette from the
disabled one, and of concentrating the whole of our force against her,
filled again to get into our station, and when abreast of the Commodore
gave him three cheers, which he returned and got into our station astern
and got all ready to renew the action with the fresh Frigate. She, in-
stead of going to the assistance of her consort, made sail, and at 5 h.
45 m. we being the sternmost ship, brought us to close action, pouring
in a heavy fire of round and grape shot, and also from musquetry and
swivels in her top, which we returned and continued for nearly an hour
closely engaged, the Commodore and Windham a little ahead keeping
up a heavy fire on the enemy as they could bring their guns to bear,
the Corvette on our starboard quarter keeping up a cross fire at us. At
6.45 the Frigate shot ahead of us, ceased our fire when she was abreast
of the Ceylon, and after engaging her a short time closely, the Ceylon
bore up, as we supposed, with the intention of boarding her, bore up to
support her. The Ceylon passed under the Frigates stern, and observing
she did not fire we luffed up under his lee quarter and asked him what
were his intentions, he replied that he had struck to the Frigate, that
Captain Minton and his chief officer were shot, and the ship completely
disabled, to continue the contest longer would be sacrificing lives to no
purpose; the Frigate was then a short gun shot from us on our star-
board bow, and the Windham about a mile astern. Our ship being
completely crippled in masts, yards, rigging, and sails, many guns being
rendered useless by the long continuance of the action, and making three
feet water per hour; at 7h. 20 m. put our helm up and stood to the


westward. The Frigate perceiving this again opened a tremendous fire
upon us, which we returned as long as we were within shot. When
without gun shot ceased firing and stood to the Kd. and Wd. At 7h.
50 m. two of the enemy in chase ; at 8 h. the enemy gained on us ; got
the ship in as 'great a state of readiness as circumstances would admit,
to defend her to the last extremity, and threw the Honourable Company’s
dispatches over-board.
Memo. —G. C. Holroyd was appointed Captain of two guns on the gun
deck, exactly opposite the main-mast, which the sailors term the slaughter
house, a very honorable station. A ball came through the side of the
ship, the splinters knocked him down senseless for a few moments, he
got a cut on his forehead over his left eye, and a small one close under
his eye. After five hours close action, being favored by the darkness of
the night, the Astell got off and arrived at Madras on the Ist August,
1810. It is very remarkable that this action happened on the Cambridge
Commemoration Day; at that time last year G. C. H. was feasting away
most sumptuously in Trinity Hall. E. H.
The result of the Action was the Capture of the Ceylon and Windham
and Escape of the Astell.
1810.
Copy of the Certificate sent in hy The Commander of the ‘Astell ’
to General St. Leger, which was not published at the time, as
that Officer did not forward, it to Government.
I do hereby certify that the undermentioned Gentlemen Cadets, who
were on board of the ‘Astell’ in the action of the 3rd July, behaved on
that occasion with the most exemplary gallantry, and contributed as
much as lay in their power to the defence of the ship. Being an eye-
witness to their youthful ardour, and undaunted intrepidity, I am con-
fident they will prove shining ornaments to the honorable profession
which they have embraced, and I cannot refrain from expressing my
high admiration of their correct moral conduct and gentlemanly deport-
ment during the passage from England.
Where the conduct of all is so deserving of encomium, it may appear
invidious to select individual merit, but I am irresistiby’led to mention
a circumstance that redounds to the honor of Mr. G. Holroyd. This
gentleman having the command of a gun on the main deck, four men


belonging to it were disabled at the same moment, and himself wounded
in the face. The remaining four (Foreigners) were seized with a panic,
and quitted their quarters, but Mr. Holroyd instantly brought them
back, and under his animated example the gun was fought during the
remainder of the action with the greatest ardour and bravery.
Signed, Robert Hay, Commander.
The Gentlemen Cadets : Henry Lawrence, William Dew, H. B.
Henderson, D. P. Wood, James Easson, J. R. Leigh, John Cartwright,
George Hanbury, E. P. Gowan, John Colvin, and D. P. Meikle, Assistant
Surgeon.— A true Copy. R. Hay.
Mr. Gr. Holroyd was also a Cadet. (Ed.)
An interesting and full account of this gallant action may be found
in James’s Naval History, Yol. 5, p. 262, from which it appears that
the East India Company presented each of the Captains with the sum
of =£soo, and bestowed a handsome remuneration upon the remaining
Officers and Men. A pension of =£46o a year was settled on Captain
Hay of the Astell, who was desperately wounded, and =£2ooo presented
to the Officers and Crew. The Colours of the Astell were three times
shot away; Andrew Peters, one of the seamen nailed the pendant to
the main-top mast-head, and was killed as he descended the rigging.

George Holroyd entered the East India Company’s Military Service
Ist March, 1838, and became Colonel Ist March, 1869, he served
throughout the operations of the Candahar force in 1838-42, (wounded
at Barree Raban, 15th September, 1842,) including the advance on
Ghuznee and Cabul, and taking of Istaliff (Medal) Gwalior Campaign,
and present at the battle of Maharajpore (Bronze Star) Sutlege Cam-

1828, he was appointed by Lord Lyndhurst one of the Commissioners
of Bankrupts under the old system, and on the 21st October, 1831, he
was appointed by Lord Brougham a Commissioner of the Bankruptcy
Court then established, and held the position of Senior Commissioner
on the abolition of the Court in December, 1869, having been in office
longer than any Judge then on the Bench. On his retirement he was

George Frederic Holroyd was sent to Winchester College as a
Commoner in February, 1837. While at Winchester he gained the
second Heathcote prize, and also the Duncan prize for Mathematics on
its first institution, as well as other prizes. He was entered at Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he went to reside in October, 1842. In
January, 1846, he graduated B.A. a AVr angler and second class in the
Classical Tripos, and M.A. in 1849. AATiilst at Cambridge he was dis-
tinguished as one of the best oarsmen of the Trinity Boat Club, rowed
stroke at the head of the Liver for a year, and number two in the
University Crew of 1845, who were victorious. He also rowed in other
successful Matches, particularly at the Thames Eegatta, when a four-
oared Crew of the T. B. C. defeated the Oxford University four. He
passed an examination in Hebrew after he had taken his degree, and
continued at Cambridge for some years taking pupils. In 1865 he came
forward as a Candidate for the representation of the Town of North-
ampton in Parliament, at the invitation of the Conservatives, and
though defeated succeeded in polling a larger number of votes than any
Conservative Candidate had previously obtained. He was called to the
Bar at the Inner Temple in Hilary Term, 1873, and devoted himself to
Parliamentary practice. His career at the Bar, commenced so late in life,
but already full of promise, was cut short by his sudden death in 18/4.
He was a Magistrate for the County of Northampton, and held a Lieut-
enant’s Commission in the Militia for that County.

‘‘Para. 3.—Of the diaries submitted for October 1858, that of Lieut.
Holroyd, Inspector of Amhalah Circle, does alone convey complete in-
formation on the points alluded to in your letter above referred to. It
gives in detail the nature of the work disposed of by the Inspectors,
shews the state in which he found the several schools he visited, and
gives proof that his examinations are conducted in a very searching
manner.


4. Of the diaries submitted for the month of November, that of
Lieut. Holroyd is very much more complete than those of the other
Inspectors, and, as remarked by Mr. Arnold, it appears to be the in-
telligent record of a month actively and usefully spent. The perusal
of the diary proves that Lieut. Holroyd has been most active in his

59. “In concluding this review of the state of the first circle, I beg
to record my high appreciation of the sound judgment, zeal and activity,
which Lieut. Holroyd brings to hear on his work, and which, even in
the few months that have elapsed since my transfer to the post of
Director, have been eminently conspicuous. Throughout the cold
weather he has been constantly in the field, and in spite of failing health,
has completed a very satisfactory tour through all the districts under his
supervision, with the exception of Ludhiana and Thanesar.
I regret extremely that his valuable services will be lost to the
Department for a while, as he is compelled to take furlough to England
on medical certificate for fifteen months, and relinquishes his charge early
in May 1860.”

4. “Very great credit is, in my opinion, due to Lieut. Holroyd as
Inspector, for carrying out the scheme of Branch schools at Dehli so
thoroughly, and for organizing them on so efficient a basis, with the
limited funds that I have from time to time been able to place at his
disposal. When the Annual Statements of expenditure have been made
up for each school, I feel convinced that in no city of India can edu-
cation of the same standard be shewn to be imparted at any thing like
the low average cost it bears in Dehli.”

those schools of the other circles where circumstances seem to afford a
prospect of success.”

“ I deem it incumbent on me, in submitting the results of our pro-
ceedings, to point out how largely the Commissioner has been indebted
to Lieut. Holroyd for the exceedingly effective aid he has afforded them,
whereby their labours have been very greatly lightened and expedited.
Being the only Military member of the Commission, and at the same
time presiding as an Officer in the Educational Department over an
important circle, including within it the City of Delhi which may be
regarded as the fountain head of the Hindustani language, he was most
favourably circumstanced for the prosecution of enquiries such as those
devolving on this Commission. And no sooner did he learn that he had
been selected as a Member, than he proceeded to Delhi, and there,
associating with himself some of the scholars of that place, who from
their combining something of European enlightenment with an appreci-
ation of the language and literature of Hindustani, appeared best suited
for his purpose, commenced upon the preparation and collection of
material for meeting the requirements of the Commission.”


Copy of letter No. 8045, dated 24 th September 18G3, from the Adjutant-
General, to Lieut. W. R. M. Holroyd, Bengal Staff Corps, and
Inspector of Schools, Ambalah Circle.
Sir, — In consequence of the statements made in your letter dated
27th June 1862,* it became necessary to institute inquiries into the
circumstances under which Private Pearson late of the 86th Regiment
obtained the Victoria Cross.
2. This led to correspondence with the Bombay and Home authorities,
and necessitated reference to Lieut.-Colonel Stuart, C. 8., 86th Regiment.
3. The papers thus obtained were submitted by order of the Com-
mander-in-Chief to the Board of Officers who assemble at Army Head
Quarters to investigate claims to the Victoria Cross.
4. This board has recorded an opinion that you behaved with great
gallantry in rescuing, with Private Pearson’s assistance, a wounded
soldier before Calpee, but that the act, however gallant, was not, under
the circumstances, deserving of the high honour of the Victoria Cross.
5. In this opinion His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief concurs.
6. You will perceive from the accompanying correspondence, that
Private Pearson obtained the Decoration principally for his gallant con-
duct at Jhansi; that displayed by him at Calpee being of a secondary
character.
I have the honor to be,
Your most obedient servant,
E. HAYTHORNE,
Adjutant General.
* It must not be inferred from this that Lieut. Holroyd applied for the Victoria
Cross, he simply pointed out that in the General Order by -which the V. G. was con-
ferred on Private Pearson for his gallantry on two occasions, the whole credit of
rescuing the wounded soldier before Calpee was assigned to him, whilst Lieut.
Holroyd’s name was entirely omitted, although Private Pearson was, on that oc-
casion, acting under his orders, and a promise had been made to Lieut. Holroyd,
without any solicitation on his part, that he should be mentioned in despatches.


(Appendix L.)
Thomas Holroyd was educated at Harrow, which, however, he left
early to go into the office of a Solicitor, and became afterwards a pupil
of the celebrated Conveyancer, Mr. Brodie. Mr. Holroyd was in the
Light-Horse Volunteers, and did duty at the Coronation of George the
Fourth in 1821, when disturbances were apprehended in consequence of
Queen Caroline’s claiming the right to enter Westminster Hall, which
was refused to her. The Light-Horse Volunteers (composed entirely of
Gentlemen, and admitted by ballot) were originally established in 1779,
and did duty in the riots of 1780, for which they received the thanks of
His Majesty George the Third, of The Lord Mayor and Magistrates of
the City of London, and of their fellow Citizens, and were presented by
His Majesty with his Standard of Light Dragoons and by the City
with two other Standards. At the peace in 1783, the Officers resigned
their Commissions, hut in May, 1794, again offered their services to the
Government, which were accepted.
During the War this Corps had some 1000 Members, all splendidly
mounted, and in those riotous days, particularly during the Spa Fields,
Bread Riots, &c., when there was no Government Police, their services were
most valuable. They had large Barracks, Stabling, and two large riding
Schools in Gray’s-Inn Lane, and from the top of the Arch entering their
Barra,cks, (now the premises of Messrs. Cubitts, the Builders, where the
L. (f.Y. “Lion Rampant,” may still be seen,) they commanded a View of
the “ Spa Fields,” where the riotous meetings of the day were held, and
from these Barracks they kept the Government, at the Horse Guards,
constantly informed of all that was going on.
Mr. Holroyd abandoned the Law in 1827, and spent some time on
the Continent, when he had the good fortune to give important aid in
saving the Town of Spa from destruction by fire, as shewn in the
following correspondence—

Monsieur Le Bourgmestre,
En vous priant d’agreer mes Eemerciments pour le rapport
que vous avez fait de ma conduite dans les derniers Incendies je vous
supplie en memo temps de rendre graces de ma part a Monsieur le
President et aux Membres du Conseil de la Compagnie des assurances,

que j’accepte avec beaucoup de plaisir ces objets de la bienveillance de la

utilite, car, dans une calamite si terrible, nos efforts ne naissent que
d’un sentiment tres ordinaire, c’est a dire, le devoir sacre de secourir les
malheureux.
J’espere, qu’en commun avec une foule de vos concitoyens, je n’ai pas
neglige cette impulsion, et voila tout ce que j’ai fait, et tout le merite
que j’en reclame. J’ai I’honneur d’etre,
Monsieur le Bourgmestre,
Yotre tres oblige et tres obeisant serviteur,
Thomas Holroyd.
Mr. Holroyd was also present during the disturbances in Belgium
previously to its separation from Holland in 1830-31.
On the death of his Father in 1832, Mr. Thomas Holroyd proceeded
to Calcutta, where he was employed in winding up several of the large
Agency Houses which had failed about that time; and after joining a
Mercantile House there became High Sheriff of Calcutta in 1837, when


her Majesty Queen Victoria came to the Throne, and had the satisfaction
of presiding at a Sheriff’s Meeting and signing the Address to Her
Majesty from the Inhabitants of Bengal, an event thus reported in the
Calcutta Papers of the day—
Report of the proceedings of a GENERAL MEETING of
Inhabitants of Calcutta, held at the Town Hall, on the 29 th Sept.
1837, for the purpose of voting an ADDRESS to the QUEEN.
[ FROM THE CALCUTTA COURIER. ]
The Meeting at the Town Hall to-day was very numerously attended,
but the proportion of natives was small in consequence of the holiday.
We annex a copy of the Resolutions and Address
A little after ten, the Sheriff ( Mr. Ilolroyd ) appeared in the chair,
and, having first allowed the half hour to elapse, he rose and addressed the
Meeting to the following effect:
Gentlemen, —This is the first time that I have been called upon to
preside, officially as Sheriff, at a Public Meeting of my fellow citizens,
and were I not supported by a consideration of the object for which it
has been convened, as well as by a conviction that your proceedings
this day will be characterized by the most cordial unanimity, I should
feel too much embarrassment and discomposure to venture upon address-
ing you. In fact upon any ordinary occasion ray inclinations would
carry me no further than to read the Requisition • but, on an occasion
of unexampled interest like the present, when we are assembled for the
purpose of congratulating a youthful Queen on her accession to the
throne of her ancestors, and manifesting our loyalty and attachment, I
am impelled by a mingled feeling of pardonable pride and exultation to
indulge the privilege, which will be conceded to all of you, of avowing
my individual devotion to her royal person. A beautiful and accomplish-
ed woman, thrown suddenly into circumstances of trial and difficulty,
before maturity of years has given confidence to her judgment, is at all
times an object of interest, but how intense becomes that interest, when
to her other claims upon our sympathy, can be asserted the right of a
Queen to our fidelity and best affections. Here, Gentlemen, we have a
Sovereign, in whom youth, beauty, intelligence' and moral excellence
mingle their attractions, passing, at the earliest moment that the laws
of her country permit her to assume the diadem, from the comparative
seclusion, to which maternal solicitude and her own passion for improve-
ment had restricted her, to the Council Chamber of a mighty empire,
where, though surrounded by men of the highest civil and military


attainments, slie has already exhibited a degree of good sense and self-
possession far beyond her years. There is an old maxim, Gentlemen,
which is no doubt familiar to most of you, that “ where men reign,
women govern,” and that “ where women reign, men govern.” Whether
the truth of this aphorism be equal to its antiquity, it is hardly worth
while to enquire, since to all rules there is an exception, and I shall be
much mistaken, Gentlemen, if our most gracious Sovereign do not, ere
many years elapse, furnish that exception in her own person, by
"V becoming, no matter who her Ministers may be, the real director of
t- their most momentous deliberations. Educated as she has been in the
~~ I expectation of filling the exalted station to which time has called her, it
cannot be doubted that she will sustain the weight of empire with
dignity and glory; and that under her fostering rule measures will be
multiplied for the diffusion of knowledge, religious and moral, and for
the spread and consolidation of social and political liberty and happiness.
In the career of improvement, Jndia too, under her auspices will, I hope,
move on pari passu with the mother country, and among other means
devised for ameliorating the condition of our native fellow subjects, we
may live to see the day when our sovereign’s influence may be exerted
in such a way as to lead to a more extended scheme of female education
when the philanthropist may enjoy the luxury of liberating the female
mind from its living tomb, and elevating it by cultivation to something
like the level of the western world. But I will not longer occupy your
time, Gentlemen, by dwelling on anticipations of this nature, pleasing
though they be. We are assembled here to offer homage to a Sovereign,
who is at this time an object of intense interest to the whole civilized
world, and right cordially and enthusiastically will it, I am sure be ren-
dered. Before I conclude, allow me to call upon the good sense of this
Meeting to refrain from all political allusions of a character to disturb
the harmony of the meeting. We ought all to be, and I dare say we all
are, animated by one common impulse, to proffer fealty to a Queen who,
whether Her Ministers be Whig or Tory, will, I am satisfied, govern
both wisely and constitutionally—
“ With a firm and skilful hand
May she uphold the laws, and keep them ever
Above the proud man’s violence and within
The poor man’s reach.”
I will now, Gentlemen, for form’s sake, read the Requisition, after
which I shall be happy to bespeak attention for any gentleman, who
may desire to address the Meeting.


At a Public Meeting of the Inhabitants of Calcutta, held at the Town Hall,
on Friday, the 29th day of September, 1837, pursuant to the advertised
Requisition to the Sheriff.
The following Resolutions were unanimously adopted :
Resolution , —Moved by James Rattle, Esq., seconded by Major-
General Sir William Casement, K.C.B.
Resolved, —That the accession of Her Majesty to the Throne must
excite the best and most patriotic feelings, and was an occasion on which
the inhabitants of the Metropolis of British India ought to tender to
Her Majesty their heartfelt congratulations, assuring their Sovereign,
that, distant as they are from the seat of Empire, they yield to none of
Her subjects in loyalty to Her government and attachment to Her
person.
2nd Resolution, —Moved by R. H. Cockerell, Esq., seconded by M. M.
Manuk, Esq.
Resolved, —That a dutiful and loyal Address from the inhabitants of
Calcutta, of all classes, be presented to Her Most Gracious Majesty,
congratulating Her on Her accession to the Throne of the British Empire.
3rd Resolution, —Moved by Theodore Dickens, Esq., seconded by
Baboo Dwarkanath Tagore.
Resolved, —That the following Address, signed by the High Sheriff of
Calcutta, on behalf of the inhabitants, be adopted.
THE ADDRESS,
TO THE QUEEN’S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.
Most Gracious Sovereign, —We, your Majesty’s subjects, of all classes,
residents of the Capital of British India, beg leave to tender to your
Majesty our heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of your accession
to the throne of your illustrious ancestors.
In the records of their private worth and public bearing, in times of
warfare and in times of peace; and in the living example of the parent,
who has been mercifully spared to guide your footsteps with safety and
honour to the exalted station which you occupy and adorn ; we discern
our guarantee that what we hail, with all our best affections awakened,
will prove to us, to our children, and to our country, a blessing and a
pride.
Distant as we are from the object of our homage, that homage will
necessarily follow, at a long interval, the welcomes of our more fortunate
fellow-subjects, assembled round you; but we doubt not your Majesty
will graciously accept our tribute in the spirit in which it is proffered ;
and, at the moment of such gracious acceptance, we would humbly


invite a benignant sympathy towards the land whence Ave address you.
The vast extent of its varied population ( comprehending eighty millions
of your subjects, and forty millions of your allies and tributaries,) with
the many and magnificent plans and projects, in operation, or in prospect
towards their improvement ; its indigenous treasures, and its commercial
wealth; its infinite capabilities, and the increasing frequency of their
beneficial development; and finally, its intrinsic value, and acknowleged
importance to the British Crown ; are no unworthy subjects of your
regard. It is the land, which has enriched, by turns, the most civilized
nations of the earth, and, though not cherished hitherto with the warm
sympathy which it merits, has maintained its vigour and its resources,
and shines, as it has long shone, the brightest jewel of your diadem.
The dominion, established in British India by the arms and wisdom
of your ancestors, although it may not claim to be the most perfect of
human institutions, has nevertheless brought prosperity and security,
Avhere anarchy and violence had reigned without control; and, when we
turn from the history of the past to look upon the present, we cannot
but be deeply impressed with a grateful consciousness of the vast benefits
which have accrued from the Union, through which we enjoy the
blessings we acknowledge. -
Uo season can be more appropriate to the expression of such
sentiments, and the assertion of our attachment to the Crown and
Constitution, than that of the accession of your Majesty to the seat of
empire; and Ave nothing doubt—Heaven seconding our prayers—that
the name of Victoria shall become associated in our hearts and in our
annals, Avith all that is noble, great, and dignified.
May the Almighty Disposer of all events grant that your Majesty
may long remain the chosen instrument of maintaining the honour and
interests of the great Empire, which it has pleased Him to commit to
your sovereignty; and of preserving to the nations, which He has
entrusted to your rule, their safety, their freedom, their civil rights, and
their religious liberties.
Calcutta, September 29th, 1837.
4 th Resolution, —Moved by H. M. Parker, Esq., seconded by Eustomjee
Cowasjee, Esq.
Resolved, —That the High Sheriff be requested to forward the Address
to Her Majesty in the most suitable manner.
sth Resolution, —Moved by James Pattle, Esq., seconded by the
Venerable Archdeacon Dealtry.
Resolved, —That the thanks of the Meeting be voted to the Sheriff for
his conduct on the present occasion.
T. HOLROYD, Sheriff.


TV ken in Calcutta Mr. Holroyd was invited to accompany Sir H. Fane
the then Commander-in-Chief in India to the Court and Camp of
Runjeet Singh, where he was present at all the Reviews given by
Runjeet Singh of his grand Army, under the Command of General
Ventura, exhibiting on one occasion 100,000 Infantry, 100 Guns, and
35,000 Cavalry, (the latter under the Command of General Allard, a
French Officer). After the death of Runjeet, the Seikh Army (as is
well known) crossed the Sutlege in December, 1845, in great force,
which resulted in the hard fought battles of Moodkee, Ferozeshuhur,
and Sobraon.
Extracts from The Bengal Sporting Magazine of December, 1838.
“It was reserved for a Gentleman of Calcutta to turn out a regular
“drag, and astonish the Natives with noble Coachmanship. Of this
“ Vehicle we have given a sketch which represents the Owner springing
“ his Team up the rise leading to Kidderpore Bridge. The Vehicle
“ represented was a regular Brighton Coach, brought out for the Owner,
“ Thomas Holroyd, Esq., by Captain Owen of the Zenobia. As soon as
£ it was hoisted out of the Ship, and the Wheels put on, a party was
“made, and the Coach started with the licensed number of twelve out-
“ side passengers, five of them ladies.”
“ The astonishment of the Baboos was prodigious; they could not
“comprehend the use of the two large boots, but were quite satisfied on
“being informed that these were the ‘ Babakannahs,’ where the English
“ Ladies put their Children when they travel! ‘ Wah, Inshallahwonder-
“ ful were the exclamations.”
In January, 1839, Mr. Holroyd left Calcutta and settled in Gloucester-
shire, where he held a Captain s Commission in the Yeomanry of the
late Duke of Beaufort, and was a Member of his Grace’s Hunt. Un-
fortunately for him he became a sleeping Partner in a large Ship Build-
ing Firm at Bristol, which failing he was obliged to revisit India; The
Creditors sympathising with Mr. Holroyd’s position unanimously re-
stored to him much valuable property, comprising Diamonds, Pictures,
and Books. Mr. Holroyd returned from India for the second time in
1847, and afterwards at the solicitation of an eminent Mercantile Firm
proceeded to the Indian Archipelago, and travelled as far as was then
permitted over the Islands of Java, Balli, Lombock, Sumbawa, Timor,
Borneo, and the Celebes, cruising among those Islands for some eighteen
months in 1847-48, and gaining very valuable information as to their
capabilities.


(.Appendix M.)
William Charles Chamberlain entered tlie Eoyal Navy June,
1831,. as a Volunteer of tlie Ist Class, with Lord James Townsend, in
H, M. S. “Dublin.” Served as Midshipman in “Acteon,” Lord Edward
Eussell, and passing out of “ Excellent,” Gunnery Ship, and through the
E.N. College at Portsmouth, in 1840 he was appointed Mate of “Stromboli.”
At the storming of Acre Mr. Chamberlain evinced great coolness and
judgment in steering the first Boat of the landing party through a
dangerous and intricate passage, and for the conspicuous gallantry he
displayed whilst leading the storming party,—being himself the first
man to- surmount the Walls—he was recommended for, and obtained,
his promotion to Lieutenant 7 4th November , 1840. After serving for
short periods in “Impregnable,” “Howe,” “Caledonia,” “Eoyal William,”
“Hyacinth,” and “Yolage,” Lieut. C. was appointed to the Command
of “Dwarf,” (tender to the Eoyal Yacht,) March, 1844 to February,
1845, and had several times the honor of taking the Queen and Prince
Consort round the Fleet at Spithead. The “ Dwarf ” was also employed
on special Service off the coast of Ireland —(Commander 1845). After
Commanding H. M. B. “ Britomart ” and H. M. S. “ Cormorant, on the
West Coast of Africa (Capturing Slavers), and in the Pacific, where he
was for a time Senior Officer off Eio, ill health obliged Commander C.
to go on half-pay, when he visited Malta for the sake of the Climate,
and acted as Private Secretary to the Governor, Sir W. Eeid, G.C.8.,
E. E., during the first period of the War in the Crimea, but as soon as
his health was sufficiently restored he sought for employment and was
sent to Command “Conflict” in the Baltic towards the end of War, and
was promoted out of her to Post Rank , 21 st February, 1856. The failing
health of his first Wife, (Eliza, eldest daughter of Captain Basil Hall, E.N,
the well-known traveller and writer—see Burke’s Baronetage,) prompted
him at this time to seek for the Post of Chief Constable of Lincolnshire,
and there was every reason to believe that his efforts—aided by the very
flattering testimonials he obtained from Admirals -Sir B. Eeynolds, Sir
Houston Stuart, Sir William Bowles, Sir William Martin, Eanshawe,
and other Flag Officers under whom Captain C. had served—would have
been successful, when the death of his Wife caused him to withdraw
from the contest, and to again seek active Service afloat. In May, 1860,
he was appointed to “ Eacoon ” for special Service on the Coast of Syria,
and was thanked by Lord J. Eussell for the tact and fairness with which
he negociated several vexed questions during the disturbances then
existing between Turks and Christians. In July, 1862, Captain C.
Commissioned the “ Eesistance ” (one of the first Iron Clads) at Sheer-


ness, and whilst in Command of her in Mediterranean, in 1865, he
received, by Telegram, the flattering offer, from the Duke of Somerset,
First Lord of the Admiralty, of the Command of Steam Reserve at
Portsmouth, which he accepted. In 1868, Mr. Corry, then First Lord,
selected him for the important post of Captain Superintendent of Chat-
ham Dockyard, the arduous duties of which office he discharged to the
entire satisfaction of two successive “ Controllers ” of the Navy, and four
successive “ First Lords,” the Admiralty testifying their confidence and
approval in numerous Letters, and by retaining him in office until he
attained Flag Rank in January, 1874. He was spoken of as the prob-
able future “ Controller ” of the Navy—or, as one of the Junior Lords,
but he asked for, and obtained, the first next vacant Dock Yard, and
was appointed, by Mr. Ward Hunt,(first Lord) to be Admiral Superintend-
ent of Devonport and Keyham Yards. Admiral C. hoisted his Flag 12th
August, 1875, and devoted himself with his characteristic thoroughness
to his professional duties, but his health rapidly gave way under
the wear and tear of official life. On the 30th January, 1876, he was
struck down by Paralysis, and finally resigned Iris Post in June of the
same year.
(Died 27th February, 1878, at Brighton, and is there buried. Her
Majesty was pleased to grant his Widow apartments in Hampton Court
Palace.)

of last week, was born in 1800, and was the fifth son of that eminent
Judge, the late Sir George Sowley Holroyd, for many years one
of His Majesty’s Justices of the Court of King’s Bench. The late Mr.
Holroyd was educated at Harrow School, and afterwards entered Christ
College, Cambridge, where he obtained a Scholarship; ho took his B.A.
degree in 1830, when he was Captain of the Poll, and proceeded to M. A.
in 1835. He was presented to the Rectory of Abberton by the late
Lord Lyndhurst, in whom as Lord Chancellor the patronage was vested,
and continued the faithful Pastor of the parish for the long period of 46
years. He was a scholar ; he excelled in modern languages—especially
German ; his opinions in matters of religious faith were firm, but moder-
ate ; he was a ready speaker, courteous in demeanour, and not unmind-
ful that the office of a Clergyman ought to be filled by a gentleman.
He married, in 1833, Sophia, eldest daughter of the late Samuel Tyssen,


Esq., of Narborough Hall, Norfolk, who pre-deceased him. Of a numer-
ous family, two sons, Captain Tyssen Holroyd and Captain E. H. G-raham
Holroyd, and two daughters (one married to Lieut.-General Street, C.B.
and the other to Lieut.-Colonel Emilius Delme Eadcliffe of the 88th
Eegiraent,) survive him. He died on the 3rd February, and was buried
at Abberton on Tuesday last. The mourners were confined to the im-
mediate members of the deceased’s family • but many old friends at-
tended at the grave as a mark of respect to his memory, while several
were prevented from being present. —(From an Essex Paper of the day.)
