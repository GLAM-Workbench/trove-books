ON GOLD WASHING.
If we look back to the period in 1851, wlien it was ascertained
by the most unquestionable evidence, that we possessed in our
Australian Colonies, the richest Gold Fields in the world; we
have reason to be surprised at the phases which the English
Public have been led through up to the present time. For a long
period, from the first announcement of Mr. Hargreaves? discovery,
the capitalists in the City, who generally lead the Public in specu-
lative enterprise, seemed indifferent or sceptical, and the Aus-
tralian Gold Pields, with their wonderful wealth, appeared to be
considered unapt to form a basis for associated enterprise. This
Was the first phase, succeeded however by the Gold Companies
Mania, by which multitudes of schemes were projected and ger-
minated under the influence and management, ?in too many
instances of men, who cared little for the ultimate success of the
schemes, provided their Company?s shares were forced to a pre-
mium in the market. All the Gold Companies were not however
of that character?and yet, what has beep the result of the large
outlay of capital, the costly machinery for Quartz-crushing, even
of those Companies who proceeded with the most honourable
intentions? Not one has been successful. Indeed, Quartz-crush-
ing for Gold, may be pronounced to be a speculation of very
doubtful success, even in the land of Gold at the Antipodes. In
England, such mining schemes are now looked upon as chimerical.
We are not, however, to conclude unreservedly that, because
these Australian Companies have failed of success, that the same
failure must attend every project, particularly if it can be shown
satisfactorily that the elements of success were wanting in all
schemes, ?and that therefore failure was certain to be the result*


In order to appreciate the causes of failure, we must remember
that the Gold in Australia is obtainable from three sources, viz.?
First, it is disseminated in the surface soil or drift, or a few feet
below it, and is obtained by washing. This constitutes properly
the Field of the common Gold-washer, who uses his tin-dish,
cradle, or dolly-tub. The second is, where an approach to mining
is necessary, the aim of the Gold-seeker being to hit upon accu-
mulated deposits of Gold, which are found at various but con-
siderable depths from the surface, sometimes in the cavities of the
bottom rocks; sometimes on old deposits ot clay or gravel. Both
these sources present the gold detatched from its original matux,
from which it has been borne and deposited by powerful water
currents. The third source is different. The Hocks in which it
was formed such as Quartz and Conglomere are its matiix, from
which it has to be obtained by powerful stamping or crushing
machinery, and amalgamation with mercury.
Of these three sources the two last are speculative. Quartz-
crushing is always an expensive process. The Quartz has to be
crushed to an impalpable powder, requiring powerful and costly
machinery, and inevitably entailing great wear and teai, whether
the rock be rich or poor in gold. But this would be of little con-
sequence, if the richness of the Quartz rocks could be relied on.
Hitherto experience has proved that no reliance can be placed in
a Gold-bearing reef, but that the Gold is very irregularly distri-
buted in it. Quartz-crushing for Gold is, therefore, at best a
hazardous speculation, even with the best constructed ciushing
machines, and a perfect system of amalgamation (if such has been
discovered), which is extremely doubtful.
The second source, or deep digging, or mining for the chance
of hitting upon a deposit, is avowedly speculative, and seems
hitherto to have been unsuited to any but the independent miner
and his mates. Balerat is the great field for this source of Gold.
Mr. Spence tried this for the Colonial Gold Company, and having
failed, abandoned the plan.
The first source or surface washing, has, however, nothing spe-
culative in it to the private or individual gold-washer. He seeks
the spots where Gold is disseminated in the alluvium, and obtains
it with ease by washing even with his rough and unscientific
methods, the tin-dish, the cradle, the equally wasteful dolly-tub,
and long-tom,?and yet he has thus supplied the money market
with millions of Australian Gold-dust.
It would be next to a miracle, nevertheless, to obtain a remu-
nerative return to a company using such imperfect and insecure
modes of Gold-washing; exposed to the men employed, and re-


quiring a supervision over free men which, it would be impossible
to exercise in the wild Gold-fields of Australia. The want of a
safe, perfect, and economical system of Gold extraction, capable
of strict supervision on the part of a superintendent, without the
risk of either tempting or offending the men employed, and secur-
ing all the Gold, may be considered to be the chief cause of failure
to those Companies who have hitherto attempted Gold-washing;
nor can we feel surprised at the failure of even the best managed
Gold Companies, for success was impossible to them. Quartz-
crushing and deep-mining 'were too speculative and uncertain,
and surface-washing wanted a more perfect and secure plan, as
well as one which could effect a saving of water, the want of
which frequently puts a stop to the washing in many districts.
Although it may be considered unnecessary by many persons,
to show how rich and extensive are the Gold-field of Australia,
because the quantity of Gold produced from them is so well
known; still, as the Gold produced arises as well from deep dig-
ging for rich deposits, as from surface washing (for Quartz-crushing
has contributed but a trifling portion to the annual yield of Gold
in Australia) it is as well to shew from authentic reports, that
the Gold-fields which are suitable for surface washing, may be
called almost unlimited in extent, of unquestionable richness, very
accessible, and to be worked with great facility.
The total produce of Victoria, in 1855, amounted to �11,856,292
sterling, of which only �BO,OOO was obtained by Quartz-
crushing.
These views respecting Quartz-crushing for Gold, are in ac-
cordance with the opinion of Sir Roderick Imfrey Murchison,
from whose work Seluria, published in 1854, the following
extract is taken.?
? Crushing Machines and the improved application of Mercury
? may indeed liberate a notable quantity of ore from a matrix of
? apparently slight value, and thus set at nought the experience of
? ages. _ Not pretending to enter into this mercantile part of the
? question, I cling to the belief expressed throughout the text,
?that in the long run, Gold will mainly be found in the rocks
? indicated, and will be worked to great advantage only , as during
? past ages, in the natural debris of those rocks.?
The following extracts are made from the Blue Books presented
to Parliament by command of Her Majesty, respecting the Gold
discoveries in the Australian Colonies.
The extracts selected are from the Reports made to the Govern-
ment, by the Rev. W. B. Clark, a high authority and distinguished


Geologist: by Mr. Strutclibury, the Geological Surveyor to the
Government of New South Wales; by Mr. Hardy, the Chief
Commissioner of the Gold-fields: by Mr. Hargreaves the dis-
coverer of Gold in Australia; and by Mr. Latrobe, Ex-Lieut.
Governor of Victoria.

of the Gold-fields.
? Office, Sydney , June 20,1852.
? Ophir. ?The Gold of Ophir has scarcely been touched, the
? diggings having been exclusively confined to the Banks of the
? Creek, the bed having never been attempted. The universal
? opinion among intelligent diggers as well as my own is, that a
? very extensive and rich Gold-field is untouched at Ophir. I
<� have seen the working of a few scattered parties in the tributa-
? ries and adjacent streams, sufficient to make me certain that
? there is in that quarter an immense area highly auriferous and
? enough to give profitable employment to thousands. In fact,
? my observation has led me to conclude that, wherever there is
? a creek in that neighbourhood, there is sufficient gold to pay
? for working. I may add, that as the working has been confined
? to the banks of the creeks alone, there has been no search made
? for dry diggings. These undoubtedly exist as they do in other
Gold localities, but these as well as the water holes, and the bed
of the creek remain to be found and worked by future diggers.
? In the months of May, June, July, and August, 1851, there
were from 600 to 800 persons at work, earning with few excep-
? lions �1 per day each. The unusually wet season, and the dis-
? covery of many other auriferous localities, have, however,
? reduced the number to about 100 in the last month.
? Turon. ?The Turon River was occupied in June, 1851, and
?in October there were about 4000 diggers there. These men
all found profitable employment. The few unsuccessful diggers
? meeting with ready employment at thirty shillings per week
? and rations. The effect of a large population on an auriferous
River was soon seen in the discovery of very large, rich, and
? numerous deposits of Gold, not only on the banks, but on the
? higher flats, and at some considerable distance from the River
? and on the neighbouring hills. Above �1 per day was the
? average of the earnings for some months after its occupation.
?Up to this time, however, the River bed has been scarcely
? worked. The long continuance of the wet season made all such
? attempts very difficult and expensive. Whenever this has been
? done by parties with greater means and more system, the re-


? suit has shown that the Riverbed is much richer than anything
? hitherto known in our Gold-fields. I have known parties of
? three and four to obtain twenty ounces a day frequently from
? the bed claims. In fact, there is no doubt that a most rich and
? abundant Gold-field remains comparatively untouched in that
? quarter. In the adjacent hills, new dry diggings of great
? yield are being constantly found, and though the population in
? that locality has dwindled dow T n to about 1500, that has arisen
? solely from the prevalent fashion of rushing to Mount Alexan-
? der, and in no degree from want of a remunerative Gold-field
? there.
? Meroo River. ?The Meroo diggings is the most scat-
? tered of the Gold-fields, and comprises not the Meroo River,
? but various tributaries and the table land of the high Range,
?at the foot of "which the Meroo runs. There are about 800
? persons at work in the various places, but there is space enough
? for as many thousands. My repeated observations in this quar-
? ter convince me that there is no creek for a great many miles
? about that part of the country that does not produce Gold in
? abundance. The Meroo River runs into the Cudgegong River,
? and the Cudgegong into the Macquarie. Within a few miles of
? this is the Mackensie Creek, running into the Macquarie. Many
? persons have -worked at times in these different places, and in
? all of them Gold has been found most abundantly. In fact, the
? great basin of the Macquarie has been only sufficiently worked
? to show that its production is very great, and that it may al-
? most be called unlimited in extent.
? Tambo�OU�A. ?The Tamboroura Creek runs parallel to the
? Turon, and empties itself into the Macquarie. It lies about
? midway between the Turon and Meroo Rivers. There are about
? bOO persons at work in this Creek and its tributaries, both of
? which greatly resemble the Meroo and its tributaries in geolo-
? gical characters and productiveness. There is room for thou-
? sands of diggers in this quarter, every small creek producing a
? large quantity of Gold, and the dry diggings of the Table land,
? (which extends about twenty miles in length by ten in breadth)
? are apparently to be found wherever they are looked for.?
Extract from the Report of Mr. Strutchbury, Geological Sur-
veyor to the Government.
? October 1, 1852.
? Having carefully examined the Cudgegong River, from its
? confluence with the Macquarie, I have no hesitation (notwith-
? standing its having been but slightly worked, and at different
? points up to the present time,) in stating my belief, that the


? whole course of it is replete with Gold, ?that very many of its
? smaller tributaries, together with the dry diggings and the
? accompanying flat lands and swamps, will supply room for
? thousands of adventurers for many years to come.?

? On the Country along the Bendoc and Delegate Rivers.?
? The whole of this region is auriferous. I cannot say what may
? be the ultimate result of multiplied labour, but I am justified
? by my own observation, and by the testimony of others in assert-
ing that, in every spot in which a spade has been inserted over
? a very considerable portion of this region, Gold has been pro-
? cured. In other localities it is found from six to ten feet below
? the surface, but I myself have found it in the surface drift, in
? accumulated alluvial earth, filling up ancient channels when the
? water w T as still more abundant than now, in the rotten slate
? under gravel, at the level of rivers, from that level to the top
? of the banks, as high as twenty-five and thirty feet above the
? water, in all excavations in the flats along the Bendoc water,
? after reaching a depth of from five to six feet. Excluding
? Maharatta Creek, in which the indications are inconsiderable,
? we still have an area of 400 square miles in which Gold occurs
? along the drainages which now water the Country.?
? Mitta. ?Mitta River, and Creeks on the left Bank.?Gold
? very abundant in the decomposed and decomposing Granite.
? The auriferous character of the alluvium had been ascertained
? by a party of four persons, but they were about to abandon it,
� because the Gold is fine. They expect to obtain it in lumps,
? but I explained to them the improbability of such discovery.
� It is an astounding fact, that taking into account other localities
? in which I know it to exist beyond, though near to the limits
(t of the Maneiro District. Gold is distributed in variable quan-
u titles over a region which may be said to embrace 16,000 square
? miles.?
December 28, 1852.
? I now, therefore, endeavour to show how far these conclusions
? are borne out by facts observed by myself. Gold occurs at
? Dungowan Creek. In all the Creeks falling into the Cockburn,
? Gold is readily obtained. Gold in small particles was found in
? the upper part of Moonbe Creek in granitic detritus.
? Above Bendemer, and below the junction of the granite with
� the transmuted rock, scale Gold was procured by me at every
? ?accessible point which I tried in the Biver Bed. AVe may there-


? fore anticipate that auriferous veins will be found occasionally
? distributed amidst the slates and altered rocks, and that there
? are various auriferous patches amidst others that contain no
? gold. The success, therefore, of the digger, must depend on
? various contingencies. But I feel sure that in the granite coun-
? try there is far more probability of success, for the Gunpowder
? Gold of the Rocky River, is found more or less all the way to
? the Cockburn.
? On the Western Range there is Gold in all the Creeks and
? River channels at the head of the Gwydyr.
Extract from the Report of Mr. Hargreaves.
? Spring Creek. ?The Gold there is very fine, and found in
? a blue clay underlying beds of shingle, at an average depth of
? eight feet. I have taken a handful of this clay weighing about
? one pound, which has produced about one half-ounce of fine
? Gold.?
Extract from the Report of Mr. Latrobe, on the Mount Korong
district.
? Indeed, throughout the country, the question seemed less to
? be, where Gold should be looked for, than where the water re-
? quired to turn the labour of raising it to account, might be
? readily obtained.?
The Reports from which these extracts are taken, relate prin-
cipally to the Gold-fields of New South Wales, which do not
present the prizes which the deep mining of Victoria have yielded
to adventurous diggers, but in default of such accumulated
deposits, they are proved to give a steady and rich return for the
labour bestowed on them, and as such, are perhaps, best suited to
the successful working of a perfect and scientific system of Gold-
washing. Sloper?s Patent Gold Washing Machine, is capable of
rubbing down the stiftest, most adhesive clay, such as the London
and plastic clay. It separates the finest grained Gold from the
soil of whatever kind with which it is mixed, and is constructed
to retain the Gold so separated within the machine, under lock
and key, and out of the sight and reach of the men employed,
until the manager withdraws it at intervals, which are determined
by the average produce of Gold obtained from the alluvium.
Six Machines may be fully worked by a small portable locomo-
tive Engine, and as each machine will rub down from seven to
ten tons of stiff alluvium per day, a set of six Machines with
their Steam Engine will extract the Gold dust from forty or fifty
tons of auriferous alluvium daily.


In estimating the produce in Gold dust which may he expected
to result from such a quantity of auriferous soil, it is necessary to
take an average product.
It is a fact admitted by all Gold-washers?that by all the pre-
sent methods a large quantity of fine Gold is washed away m the
tailings; indeed, it has been found at the Gold works in the
Brazils, that the first washing only separates about one halt the
Gold contained in the stuff washed, the other half being left in
the tailings, which at those works are repeatedly rewashed.
Sloper?s Patent Machine avoids this waste of time and labour,
one washing being sufficient to separate and secure the finer grains
of Gold which (as mentioned by the Rev. W. B. Clark in one of
his Reports) often form a great proportion of the Gold found in
the alluvium.
From these considerations and the average profit reported by
Commissioner Hardy?obtained by 4000 Gold-washers at Ophir,
it may safely be estimated that an average of one ounce of Gold
may be obtained from one ton of alluvium washed by this
Machine. The wood for fuel to work the Steam Engine is every
where abundant in Australia, costs nothing but the labour of cut-
ting and gathering, and can be used and will burn immediately
it is cut.
It is making a very liberal estimate of the expenses of working
B ix machines, to allow 20/00 of the gross produce of Gold.
Therefore if the minimum quantity of Gold obtained daily
4O ounces.
and 20/00 be allowed for expenses 8 ounces.
The daily net product from six machines *.. 32 ounces.
The Capital required for such an operation need not exceed
�l5OO, and a proportionate increase of return may be relied on
according to the capital invested, which may be increased to any
extent.
