To Remove and Replace the Radiator
1. Remove the two screws from the hinge bracket
at the rear end of the bonnet, and remove the
bonnet by sliding the hinge pin from the forward
hinge bracket towards the rear.
2. Disconnect the radiator badge wire at the near
side bottom of the radiator.
3. Remove the two bolts connecting the stay rods
to the radiator,
4. Unscrew the clips on the top and bottom hoses.
5. Remove from under the chassis front member,
four nuts (two locking) which secure the
radiator on its mounting.
6. The radiator, with shell, can now be removed by
tilting it slightly forward. (Take care not to lose
the washers from the mounting).
NOTE: Replacement of the radiator is carried out
in the reverse order to its removal.
IMPORTANT: Do not invert the radiator or lay
it flat on the ground, as this will cause any sedi-
ment in the bottom tank to pass into the cooling
spaces. Always store the radiator in an upright
position.
To Adjust the Fan Belt
The adjustment of the fan and water pump belt
tension is effected by slackening off slightly the two
bolts on which the dynamo pivots, releasing the set
screw (at the top front end of the dynamo) securing
it to the slotted link and pulling the dynamo bodily
outwards until the belt tension is correct. Then
tighten up the set screws with the dynamo in this
position.
Note: Gentle hand pressure only must be exerted
on the dynamo, or the belt tension will become
excessive and cause rapid wear,
B
To Dismantle and Reassemble the Water Pump
(Single Bearing Type)
The water pump is fitted to the front face of the
cylinder block, and is driven by a belt from the
crankshaft. (This belt also drives the dynamo).
The pump is fitted with a special carbon gland ring
which provides an efficient water seal and needs no
lubrication or adjustment. When a new ring is
fitted a slight leak may occur, but this will auto-
matically cease as the carbon ring beds itself down.
When the pump is dismantled, it is advisable -to
renew the rubber seal for the carbon ring in every
instance. To do this, drive out from its thin end
the taper pin securing the impellor to the shaft,
draw off the impellor, spring and flat washer, be-
neath which are the rubber seal, and carbon ring.
Note the peg which rotates the carbon ring. Now
proceed as described for the assembly of the pump.
Care should be taken not to damage the carbon
ring, which is brittle.
The pump spindle is carried on a single ball
bearing and bush which should give no trouble un-
less neglected.
Access to the bearing is obtained by releasing the
impellor, seal and carbon ring in the manner already
described, and then proceeding as follows:
Remove the attachment nut in the centre of the
drive pulley, withdraw the pulley, remove the dust
excluder together with its cover, and extract the
circlip securing the ball bearing for the spindle to
the pump body. The spindle, complete with ball
bearing, small felt dust excluder and its cover, cap
be removed by gently tapping the impellor end of
the wmoden surface of the bench.
The circlip retaining the ball bearing in the body
and on the shaft can be extracted by inserting a
sharp instrument, such as a thin screwdriver, be-


tween the circlip and the groove in which it fits.
Then by progressively moving the screwdriver
around the circlip it can be removed.
Reassembly is the reversal of the above, but the
following points should be observed;
(a) The face of the water pump body against which
the carbon gland bears, must be flat and at
right angles to the bore of the bush for the
spindle. Machine marks should be removed,
but without affecting the flatness of the face.
To ensure the carbon gland makes contact with
the machined face of the body, polish its face
with emery cloth.
(b) The hole in the rubber seal is smaller than the
diameter of the spindle. This ensures that
when in position the seal will grip the spindle
tightly. DO NOT ENLARGE THE HOLE
BEFORE FITTING. See that the parts of the
spindle which contact the seal when it is in
position are smooth and free from sharp edges.
This will prevent it from being bruised or
damaged, while a smear of Lockheed brake fluid
will help it to slide down. DO NOT USE OIL
ON THE SEAL AS IT HAS A DAMAGING
EFFECT.
(c) When the bush for the spindle is replaced, posi-
tion it as shown in Figure 3, one millimetre
below the machined surface of the pump body.
DO NOT drill an oilway in it, as lubrication is
supplied from the oiler fitted in the pump body.
It is important that this oiler is kept full with
a light lubricant such as engine oil.
To Dismantle and Reassemble the Water Pump
(Double Bearing Type)
When the pump is dismantled, it is advisable to
renew the rubber seal for the carbon ring in every
instance.
To do this, drive out the taper pin securing the
vane of the spindle, draw off the vane and spring
and washer beneath which are the rubber seal and
the carbon seal. Note the peg which rotates the
carbon ring. Now proceed as follows for the dis-
mantling of the pump.
Care should be taken not to damage the carbon
ring, which is brittle.
The pump spindle is carried on two ball bearings,
which should give no trouble unless neglected.
Access to the bearing is obtained by releasing the
vane seal and carbon ring in the manner previously
described.
Remove the securing nut from the centre of the
drive pulley, withdraw the pulley, remove the felt
and dust excluder. Remove the bearing and dis-
tance piece. Remove the circlip holding the rear
bearing in position.
The spindle, complete with bearing, dust excluder

and felt washer, can now be removed by gently
tapping the vane end of the spindle on the wooden
surface of the bench.
The small circlip on the spindle can be removed
by inserting an instrument, such as a screwdriver,
between the circlip and the groove in which it fits,
and by progressively moving the screwdriver around
the circlip.
Reassembly is the reversal of the above, but the
following points should be,* observed :
(a) The face of the water pump body against
which the carbon gland bears must be flat and
at right angles to the bore of the spindle.
Machine marks should be removed, but without
affecting the flatness of the face. To ensure
the carbon gland makes contact with the
machined face of the body, polish its face with
fine emery,
(b) The hole in the rubber seal is smaller than
the diameter of the spindle. This ensures that
when in position, the seal will grip the spindle
tightly. DO NOT ENLARGE THE HOLE
BEFORE FITTING.
See that the parts which contact the seal
when it is in position are smooth and free from
sharp edges. This will prevent it from being
bruised or damaged, while a smear of Lockheed
brake fluid will help it to slide down. DO NOT
USE OIL ON THE SEAL AS IT HAS A
DAMAGING EFFECT.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The six cylinder o.h.v. push rod operated engine
is built in unit construction with a single plate dry
clutch and four speed gearbox.
It has a robust six-throw crankshaft carried in
four main bearings, with renewable white metal
lined bearings dowel located.
The thrust is taken by the rear bearing, which is
flanged for this purpose.
The connecting rod big en’d bearings are of white-
metal, run direct on to the rod. The little end is
slotted and fitted with a clamp screw and spring
washer, which locks it to the gudgeon pin.
The pistons are of aluminium alloy, wire wound,
and fitted with three rings.
The camshaft is driven from the crankshaft by a
duplex roller chain, and has four bearings in the
cylinder block, which are fed with oil direct from
the main galley pipe.
The camshaft operates the valves through the
medium of mushroom type tappets, Avhich are
secured in three detachable guide blocks.
The main oil supply is carried in a removable
pressed steel sump.
A gear type of oil pump, driven from a helical
gear on the camshaft, draws the oil through a sub-
merged filter in the sump and delivers it to the
various parts of the engine via an external oil filter.
The cylinder head is detachable.
The cooling water is circulated by means of an
impellor mounted on the front Avail of the cylinder
block. It is driven, in conjunction Avith the dynamo,
by a V-belt from a pulley on the forward end of the
dynamo.
Carburation is by tAVO doAvndraught S.U. car-
burettors fitted with a combined air cleaner,
silencer and a special manifold system.
The 14/60 choke is hand controlled and the 18/85
is controlled by an electric switch.
Fuel supply is by S.U. electric pump mounted on
the engine bulkhead.
The engine power is transmitted to the gearbox
by a dry single plate clutch.
THE LUBRICATION SYSTEM
The main oil supply is carried in a remoA r able
pressed steel sump.
A gear type of oil pump, driven from a helical
gear on the camshaft, draAvs the oil through a sub-
merged filter in the sump, and delivers it to the
various parts of the engine via an external filter
fitted on the left side of the engine.
From the main gallery pipe fitted along the left
side of the engine the oil is fed direct to the cam-
shaft and crankshaft main bearings. The big end
bearings are supplied Avith oil from the main bear-
ings through tubes in the crankshaft Avebs, and the
oil splash from the big end lubricates the cylinder
Avails, pistons and gudgeon pins.
A pipe connects the rear end of the main gallery
pipe to the rear end of the cylinder head, and sup-
plies the oil to the overhead valve rocker mechanism
via the holloAv rocker shaft and the vertical and
horizontal oilways drilled in each rocker. The oil
from the cylinder head is returned to the sump
through the push rod chambers.
IMPORTANT: The oilways to the crankshaft
main bearings pass in a direct line Avith the left
side studs securing the main bearing caps. These
studs ha\ r e annular grooves machined in them to
alloAV the oil to pass.
The studs must be removed and the grooves
cleaned in all cases when oilways are receiving
attention.
NOTE: When the engine is first started up and
the oil is cold, a considerably higher oil pressure
than normal will be indicated on the gauge. It is
mainly for this reason that a gauge covering a large
range of pressure reading is provided, and the risk
of damage to the instrument thus reduced to a
minimum.
In the event of the oil gauge being damaged, or
ceasing to function correctly, it must be replaced as
soon as possible.
Maintenance
The attention Avhich can be given to the poAver
unit while in position in the chassis is the folloAV-
ing:

page 1, Section F.
To Remove and Replace the Sump and
Clean the Oil Intake Float
Remove the drain plug and drain the sump.
Remove the dipstick.
Remove the twenty-four set screAvs securing the
sump to the crankcase, and lower the sump from
the engine. Note that the anchorage for the engine
fume pipe is located on the fifth set screw on the
left side of the sump.
Remove the oil intake float and clean it thor-
oughly; also Avash out the sump.
Replace the sump drain plug and refit the sump.


Care must be taken to see that the cork joint is
undamaged. (Fit a new joint in a doubtful case).
Refill with pints of neAV engine oil.
To Remove the Oil Pump
C
Remove the oil pipe that connects the oil pump
to the external oil filter and also the banjo bolt
securing the pipe to the filter.
. Remove the eight bolts securing the pump to the
crankcase.
Remove the pump by gently tapping the side of
the pump body and withdrawing downwards. Use
an extractor to draw the idler gear shaft from the
crankcase.
To Dismantle, Reassemble and
Replace the Oil Pump
Remove the base cover from the bottom of the
pump. This will release the idler gear, which can
easily be withdrawn.
Drive out the peg which secrues the helical
driving gear to the shaft, and withdraw the gear.
Fig. 1.—Exploded view of oil pump.
Remove the driving shaft complete with driven
gear and circlip.
The oil pump is assembled and replaced on the
engine in the reverse order to its dismantling and
removal. Care should be taken to see that the
abutting faces of the crankcase and that of the
pump are clean before replacement.
Distributor
The ignition distributor is provided with an auto-
matic mechanism which varies the tiring point
according to the requirements of the engine.
This is effected by weights fitted in the distribu-
tor below the mounting for the contact breaker. As
the speed of the engine varies, these weights move
under the action of centrifugal force and spring
pressure, and so advance or retard the cam which
operates the contact breaker.
IMPORTANT: The tension of the springs must
not be altered.
The distributor is also provided with a micro-
meter adjustment by which the ignition setting can
be altered to suit local or temporary conditions.
Adjustment is made by rotating the knurled knob
in the required direction, moving the zero mark
towards the “R” or “A” positions on the scale.
To Remove and Replace the Distributor
Remove the distributor cover and wires.
Remove the locking wire from the retaining screw
and remove the screw.
Withdraw the distributor from its bush in the
crankcase.
Fig. 2. —Fan pulley and timing mark.


The replacement of the distributor is a direct
reversal of the above.
It is always advisable when removing the distribu-
tor to set the engine so the No. 1 or No. 6 piston is
at the top dead centre, and note the position of the
rotor arm in relation to the distributor body.
Top Centre Mark
An indication arrow is stamped on the timing
chain case and a hole is drilled in the inner side
of the crankshaft fan pulley. Turn the engine until
the hole in the pulley is in line with the arrow
stamped on the cover, for top dead centre No, 1 or
No. 6 cylinder.
To Retime the Ignition —Order of firing 1,5, 3,6,
2, 4.
Having set the contact points to .012 and the
micrometer adjustment to zero, turn the engine so
that the hole in the crankshaft pulley coincides
with the arrow marked on the timing cover, the
contact breaker points should now be just com-
mencing to open. Should this not be the case, re-
lease the clamping bolt at the base of the distributor
and turn the distributor anti-clockwise until the
points are fully closed, and then turn it,carefully
clockwise until the contact points just commence
to open.
Securely tighten the clamp bolt. Recheck the tim-
ing to make sure that tightening the clamp bolt has
not altered the setting.
Any minor adjustment can then be carried out on
the micrometer adjustment while on the road.
To Check the Valve Timing
Set No. 1 cylinder inlet valve to .028 clearance
when cold, and turn the engine until No. 1 inlet
valve is about to open. The hole in the fan pulley
should then be opposite the arrow marked on the
timing cover.
NOTE: The clearance of .028 is necessary to bring
the opening position of the valve to T.D.C. Do not
omit to reset the clearance to the running dimension
of .015 when the adjustment is completed.
To Remove and Replace the Carburettors
Remove the air cleaner.
Remove the two wire connections from the car-
burettor solenoid. Care must be taken not to dis-
turb the solenoid clips (18/85 only).
Remove the balance pipe nut from the solenoid
casing (18/85 only).
Remove one end of the throttle control rod. Re-
move the flexible petrol pipe (carburettor end).
Remove the four nuts (two on each carburettor)
securing the carburettor body flanges to the mani-
fold.
IMPORTANT: Remove the spring washers under
these nuts before the carburettors are lifted off
and so avoid the possibility of the washers falling
into the inlet manifold.
The carburettors, complete with air cleaner pipe,
can now be lifted and withdrawn.
Replacement of the carburettors is the reversal of
the above.
NOTE: Before replacing, it is advisable to check
the faces of the carburettors with a short straight
edge to ensure that they are not distorted. Correct
if necessary by filing to a surface plate.
To Remove and Replace the Water Pump
Open the radiator cock and drain the water from
the cooling system.
Release the fan belt tension and remove the belt.
Release the clips from the pump connecting hose;
remove the hose.
Remove the two set screws from the thermostat
elbow.
Remove the two set screws and two nuts securing
the water to the cylinder block.
Remove the water pump assembly.
Replacement of the water pump is the reversal of
the above.
To Remove and Replace the Cylinder Head
Drain the water from the cooling system.
Remove the carburettor.
Remove the cylinder head cover.
Remove the exhaust and inlet manifold.
Release the dips and remove the top water hose.
Remove the cooling water thermostat.
Remove the oil feed pipe to the cylinder head.
Remove the sparking plugs; also the high tension
wires with the carrier tube complete.
Hold each rocker down in turn, thus depressing
the valve springs, and remove the push rods. (A
special tool is needed for this purpose).
Release the eighteen cylinder head stud nuts a
partial turn at a time, until they are free for com-
plete removal by hand.
Remove the cylinder head.
NOTE: To facilitate breaking the cylinder head
joint, tap each side of the head smartly with a
Fig. 3. —Correct order of tightening cylinder head nuts.


hammer, with a piece of wood interposed to take the
blow. When lifting off the head a direct pull
should be given, so that the head is pulled evenly
up its studs.
The cylinder head is replaced in the reverse order
to the removal procedure.
To Tighten the Cylinder Head
The cylinder head nuts must be tightened in the
correct rotation to ensure a satisfactory joint on the
gasket face. The nuts must be tightened again
when the engine is hot and finally when the engine
has been tested.
IMPORTANT: Whenever the cylinder head nuts
are tightened, the rockers must be reset to .015.
Tappet Adjustment
If the engine is to give its best performance and
the valves their maximum useful life, it is essential
Fig. 4. —Exploded view of valve, springs, oil seal and retainers.
that the correct rocker clearance be constantly
maintained.
Accordingly, it is recommended that, the clearance
be checked at regular intervals, and any necessary
adjustment made.
The clearance for both inlet and exhaust valves
is .015 when hot. The engine has been designed
to operate with this clearance, and any departure
from it is likely to cause trouble. It is important
to note that while the clearance is being set, the
tappet of the valve being operated on is in the cen-
tre of the neutral portion of the cam.
. Since the camshaft, however, is out of sight, to
obtain the above position use the following adjust-
ment table:
TAPPET SETTING TABLE
Set No. 1 rocker with No. 12 valve fully open.
Set No. 8 rocker with No. 5 valve fully open.
Set No. 9 rocker with No. 4 valve fully open.
Set No. 2 rocker with No. 11 valve fully open.
Set No. 6 rocker with No. 7 valve fully open.
Set No. 10 rocker with No. 3 valve fully open.
Set No. 12 rocker with No. 1 valve fully open.
Set No. 5 rocker with No. 8 valve fully open.
Set No. 4 rocker with No. 9 valve fully open.
Set No. 11 rocker with No. 2 valve fully open.
Set No. 7 rocker with No. 6 valve fully open.
Set No. 3 rocker with No. 10 valve fully open.
To Decarbonise
Having carried out the removal of the cylinder
head and the valves, the remainder of the decarbon-
ising operation is straight-forward.
Care must be taken with the following operations":
1. DO NOT score the top of the pistons when re-
moving the carbon, or use any form of abrasive
material for this purpose.
2. DO NOT attempt to grind in a valve which is
badly pitted. This will only give rise to a wide
seat, which is detrimental. The valve should be
trued up.
3. DO NOT allow wide seats to develop.
4. DO NOT leave the grinding compound on the
pqrts after grinding,
5. DO NOT tighten the cylinder head nuts uneven-
ly. Follow carefully the procedure detailed.
To Grind and Test the Valves and Beatings
The valves and seatings should be carefully in-
spected, and if only slightly pitted or rough, ground
in by thinly coating the valve faces with a good
quality fine valve grinding compound, and twisting
each valve to and fro on its seating until a perfect
seating is obtained.
Use a special tool for this* operation.
A good plan is to place a suitable light spring
under the head of each valve in turn as it is being
ground in. The spring, when the pressure is
released, will lift the valve off its seat and allow it
to be moved into various positions during the grind-
ing in.


On no account must badly pitted valves and seats
be ground together, as this will produce wide seats,
which are detrimental. If the valves and seats are
too badly scored to grind in quickly, and suitably
by hand, the valves must be faced true to their
stems and the seatings recut true to their guides.
Finally grind in by hand.
When all the valve faces and seatings appear
perfectly smooth, clean off both valves and
seats with petrol to remove all traces of grinding
paste. It is advisable to check each valve for cor-
rect seating after grinding in. Do this by applying
a little marking on the valve face, then fit the valve
into the cylinder head, taking care not to twist
the valve on its seat when doing so. Now use the
special grinding tool and press down, giving the
valve a half turn only. Then if the valve is cor-
rectly seated, the marking should be reproduced on
the seating of the cylinder head, on removal of the
valve. A final rub in with oil is recommended.
To Replace the Valves
When refitting the valves and springs, it is advis-
able to smear the valve stems with oil and to pour
a few drops into each valve guide. This will pre-
vent the valves sticking or squealing before ade-
quate lubricant reaches them.
IMPORTANT; A small rubber seal is fitted to
each of the valves, and care should be taken when
fitting: to see that they do not split or break. The
seals are slipped over the valve stems and into the
annular grooves for the split cotters before the split
cotters are fitted. The valves must always be fitted
into their original positions. To facilitate this oper-
ation the valves are numbered 1 to 12, starting at
the front of the engine.
To Remove and Replace the Valve Guides
Remove the cylinder head and valves.
Press out the valve guides, using a suitable sized
tool. I 1 ;j jj
When fitting the new valve guides, press them
in until 24 mm. is protruding above the machined
surface of the cylinder head.
Use special tools.
To Remove and Replace the Engine
Remove the battery lead terminals.
Drain the cooling system.
Remove the bonnet.
Remove the radiator.
Remove the air cleaner and carburettor.
Remove the nuts from the exhaust manifold
branch pipe and break the joint. (Care must be
taken not to misplace the two sealing washers).
Remove the two front seats.
Disconnect the dipper switch from the floor-
boards.
Remove the floorboards with gearbox cover. (These
are removed in two sections left side and right
side). Remove the right side board first.
Disconnect the speedometer cable.
Uncouple the front end of the propeller shaft
from the gearbox driving flange. (Move the car
backwards and forwards to bring the coupling bolts
into position for easy removal)).
Remove the starter motor.
Remove the clutch pedal pull off spring from the
chassis.
Remove the nine set screws securing the gearbox
flywheel housing. Two of these bolts are on the left
side front of the flywheel housing).
Remove the gearbox.
Uncouple the oil gauge pipe from the top of the
external oil cleaner. (Move the pipe into a safe
position)).
Remove the dynamo wires.
Remove the dynamo.
Release the Jackall supply tank from its bracket
on the left side of the frame.
Move the Jackall tank downwards below the level
of the chassis without disconnecting the pipe lead-
ing to the Jackall distributor. This will avoid
draining the system and rebleeding.
Remove the wires from the coil.
Remove the coil from its securing bracket on the
left side of the chassis.
Remove the distributor cover and wires.
Remove the high tension wires and carrier.
Place the lifting sling round the engine.
Remove the four engine mounting bolts.
Raise the engine slightly with the lifting gear,
and when just off its mountings, pull the rear end
slightly to the near-side to allow the right-side
engine foot to clear the steering column as the
engine is raised. When the engine sump is just above
the front cross member of the chassis, the engine
can be disengaged by slowly pushing the vehicle
backwards.
The engine should be placed on a stand for fur-
ther attention.
Replacement of the engine is the reversal of the
above.
To Remove and Replace
the Crankshaft Damper
Remove the eight set screws securing the damper
to the driving pulley.
Remove the starting handle dog nut.
Tap off the damper.
Replacement is the reversal of the above.
To Remove the Timing Cover
Remove the crankshaft damper.
Remove the fan belt.
Remove the starting handle dognut.
Remove the crankshaft fan pulley.
Remove the crankshaft pulley distance piece.
Remove the eleven set screws securing the timing
cover to the crankcase.
Remove the timing cover.
To carry out this schedule with the engine in the
frame, it is necessary to remove the radiator.


To Replace the Timing’ Cover
To ensure an oil-tight joint, it is essential that
the cork washer fitted between the cover and the
front plate is in good condition.
Check that the oil thrower is in position on the
crankshaft.
Place the timing cover in position, locating it
loosely with two or three fixing bolts. Place the
distance piece in position and then fit the remainder
of the securing bolts and tighten up.
Place the fan driving pulley on the crankshaft
and push it home.
Replace the fan belt.
Replace the crankshaft damper.
Replace the starting handle dog nut and locking
plate.
To Remove and Replace the Timing Chain
Remove the fan belt.
Remove the crankshaft damper.
Remove the fan driving pulley.
Remove the timing cover.
Remove the bolt securing the camshaft sprocket
to the camshaft.
Lever off the crankshaft and camshaft sprockets,
complete with the chain, by means of short flat
levers, taking care not to damage the crankshaft
and camshaft front bearings.
Replacement is, in the main, the reversal of the
foregoing operation, but note that there are two
bright links on the chain.
Double the chain, placing the two bright links
together; this will give a long and a short part of
the chain.
With the shorter part of the chain on the left
(the bright links forward) and the longer on
the right, engage the camshaft sprocket tooth
marked “T” with the top bright link, and the crank-
shaft sproket with the tooth marked “T” with the
other bright link.
Turn the crankshaft until the keyway is at the
top and lying on a vertical line. Turn the camshaft
until the keyway is approximately 15° before top
centre.
Then place the sprockets complete with chain into
position, and push them home.
Replacement of the oil thrower, distance piece,
fan pulley, damper starting dog nut and the rediator
is the reversal of the above.
Check the valve timing.
To Remove and Replace the Flywheel
Remove the clutch.
Cut and remove the locking wire from the six
securing bolts.
Remove the six bolts securing the flywheel to the
crankshaft.
Remove the flywheel.
When refitting the flywheel, it is important to
make sure that it is running true. The joint faces
must be perfectly clean before assembly and the
accuracy of the assembly must be checked with a
dial gauge.
The maximum permissible error on the flywheel
face is .003 when it is rotated through one complete
revolution.
IMPORTANT: When reassembling it is essential
that an oil-tight joint is made between the oil
thrower and the flywheel. This can be effected by
applying a light sealing compound to the faces
before fitting, and which will prevent any tendency
for oil to pass along the flywheel bolts and into the
clutch housing.
If the oil should find its way on to the frictional
c
Fig. 5.—Correct method of fitting timing chain


faces of the clutch, it will produce either fierceness
or slipping.
Replacement of the flywheel is the reversal of
the above.
To Remove and Replace a Piston
and Connecting Rod
Remove the engine sump.
Remove the oil intake float.
Remove the nuts from the big end bolts.
Remove the connecting rod bearing cap.
Remove the connecting rod from the crankshaft.
Draw out the piston and connecting rod down the
right side of the engine.
It may be necessary to rotate the crankshaft
slightly to give the required clearance for the piston.
Replacement of the piston and connecting rod is
a direct reversal of the above.
IMPORTANT: It is essential when replacing the
pistons, that they are fitted to the same bores and
the same way round as when removed; also the
same connecting rod, complete with bearing caps,
must be fitted to the same crank journal from which
it was removed.
To Dismantle and Reassemble
the Pistons and Connecting Rods
Each gudgeon pin is a push fit in its piston, and
is locked in position by the small end clamp bolt, the
diameter of which “picks up” the small groove in
the gudgeon pin.
Before a gudgeon pin and its connecting rod
can be dismantled, from the piston, it is necessary
to remove the clamp bolt. The best method of hold-
ing the gudgeon pin is to insert in each hollow end
a plug, and then secure the assembly in a vice.
Remove the clamp bolt.
Push out the gudgeon pin.
IMPORTANT: Care must be taken when replac-
ing the piston to the connecting rod to ensure
(1) that the clamp bolt will screw down readily
into its threaded hole in the small end of the con-
necting rod;
(2) that the spring washer has sufficient tension
to make it effective;
(3) that the gudgeon pin is positioned in the pis-
ton and rod so that the groove formed in its peri-
phery is in line with the threaded hole for the damp
bolt in the connecting rod;
(4) that the clamp bolt, which should now be
screwed in with the same ease as in (1), is tight-
ened firmly with a box spanner.
To Fit the Gudgeon Pins
When the gudgeon pins are fitted to the pistons,
a certain amount of selective assembly may be nec-
essary, and the following points should be observed:
With aluminium alloy pistons, the gudgeon pins
must be a double thumb push fit into the pistons.
Never attempt to ream out a gudgeon pin boss, as
oversize gudgeon pins are not permissible.
Piston Sizes and Cylinder Bores
When fitting new pistons, selective assembly is
necessary. To help, the pistons are stamped with
distinguishing figures on their crowns. These figures
should correspond with those stamped, to indicate
each bore size, on the top front left side corner of
the cylinder block. The pistons are also graded for
weight and stamped accordingly on their crowns.
It is advisable to fit pistons of the same weight
grading to an engine to ensure correct balance.
The symbols used for the 14/60 and 18/85 cylin-
der bores are:
AOK, indicating the standard size and having
the .actual measurement of (14/60), 2.4213 and
(18/85) 2.7362.
A -f- 1, indicating an oversize of .0004 approx, on
the standard size and, having the actual measure-
ment of (14/60) 2.4217 and (18/85) 2.7366 and so on
through the range.
While the cylinder head and the pistons are with-
drawn, the cylinder bores should be measured for
wear.
Indication that reboring of the cylinders is neces-
sary is given by the loss of performance, oiling up
and loss of compression.
The pistons supplied are graded as above, and
those marked AOK should be fitted to bores marked
AOK, and so on throughout the range.
Attention to Main Bearings
The main bearings fitted to the engine are of
the full-ring butted non-adjustable type, and are
supplied in sizes giving the correct clearance for
standard and reground crankshafts. On no account
must these bearings be closed together by filing
their butting faces or those of their caps. This
will render the bearings and caps useless for future
reconditioning.
If the bearings are found to be worn or scored,
they should be replaced by new bearings of the
correct size for the crankshaft journals when these
have been reground to one of the permissible sizes.
The following are the permitted sizes for standard
and ground crankshafts;
Standard .. .. .. .. 2.1653
R.l 2.1535
R. 2 2.1456
R. 3 2.1259
The crankshaft size is clearly marked on the large
diameter between Nos. 3 and 4 crank journals. The
correct crankshaft end float is .003 and is governed
by the width of the rear main bearing, which is
flanged.
Attention to Big End Bearings
The big end bearings of the connecting rods are
of the full-ring butted non-adjustable type. The
bearing metal is run directly into the rods. The
halves make contact with each other at their butting
joints without leaving a gap and without packing
shims.
On no account must these bearings be closed


together by filing their butting faces or those of
their caps. On new rods, the diametrical clearance
is .0015 and the side clearance .003.
To test the connecting rods for alignment, two
shafts about 6 inches long may be used; one an
exact fit in the small end and the other an exact fit
in the big end bore.
With the rod set centrally on the shafts, measure
on either side of the rod, the distances between the
extremities of the two shafts. The measurements
must be the same.
The following are the permitted sizes for standard
and undersize bearings:
Standard . . . . . . .. 1.8897
R.l ' .. 1.8779
R. 2 1.8700
R. 3 1.8504
The size of each rod is marked clearly on the
shank, i.e., R.l, R. 2, R. 3,

To Remove and Replace the Petrol Tank
Drain the tank by removing the drain plug fitted
in the bottom of the tank.
Remove the petrol pipe from the front side of
the tank.
Remove the wire from the petrol tank unit fitted
on the front side of the petrol tank.
Unscrew the clips on the hose connecting the tank
filler to the tank. These are situated inside the
spare wheel compartment. Remove the filler and
hose.
Remove the four nuts from the petrol tank sup-
porting straps.
The tank can now be withdrawn.
The Construction of the Petrol Pump
The pump will give prolonged service with the
minimum of attention, but the filter must occasion-
ally be removed and thoroughly cleaned in petrol
with a stiff brush to remove any foreign matter
which may accumulate.
The pump consists of three main assemblies: the
body, the magnet assembly and the contact breaker.
The body is composed of a hollow brass stamping
(8), into the bottom of Avhich the filter (12) is
screwed. The pump inlet union (29) is screwed
m at an angle on one side. The outlet union (1),
which is screwed into the top, tightens down on the
delivery valve cage (5), which is clamped between
two fibre washers (2) and (6). In the top of the
delivery cage is the delivery valve, a thin brass disc
(4) held in position by a spring clip (3). The suc-
tion valve (7) 4s a similar disc to (4) and rests on
a seating machined in the body. Holes connect the
space between the valves to the pumping chamber,
which is a shallow depression on the forward face
of the body. This space is closed by a diaphragm
assembly, (9), which is clamped at its outside edge
between the magnet housing (27) and the body, and
in the centre between a brass plate (11) and the
steel armature (15). A bronze rod (16) is screwed
through the centre of this and passes through the
magnet core to the contact breaker, which is located
at the other end.
The magnet consists of a cast iron pot having an
iron core (17), on which is wound a coil of copper
wire which energises the magnet. Between the mag-
net housing and the armature are fitted eleven
spherical edged brass rollers (10). These locate the
armature centrally within the magnet at all times,
and allow absolute freedom of movement in a longi-
tudinal direction.
The Contact Breaker Mechanism
The contact breaker consists of a small bakelite
moulding carrying two rockers (25) and 26),
which are both hinged to the moulding at one end
and are connected together at the top end by two
small springs arranged to give a throw-over action.
A trunnion is fitted into the centre of the inner
rocker, and the bronze rod (16) connected to the
armature is screwed into this.


The outer rocker (26) is fitted with a pair of
tungsten points which make contact with a further
pair of tungsten points on a spring blade (24). This
spring blade is connected to the terminal (20). A
volute spring (28) is interposed between the arma-
ture and diaphragm. A short length of flexible
wire is connected to the outer rocker and to the
other terminal. The rocker mechanism is insulated
by fibre bushes. Two fibre ‘bushes are fitted, to one
of the spindles of the “throw-over” mechanism in
order to silence the operation of the contact breaker.
The Petrol Pump Action
The action of the pump is as follows:
When the pump is at rest, the outer rocker lies in
the outer position and the tungsten points are in
contact. The current passes from the terminal,
through the coil, back to the blade, through the
points and to the return terminal, thus energising
the magnet and attracting the armature. This
comes forward, bringing the diaphragm forward
and sucking petrol through the suction valve into
the pumping chamber. When the armature has
advanced nearly to the end of its stroke, the “throw-
over” mechanism operates, and the outer rocker flies
hack, separating the points and breaking the circuit.
The spring (28) then pushes the armature and
the diaphragm back, forcing the petrol through the
delivery valve at a rate determined by the require-
ments of the engine. As soon as the armature' gets
near the end of this stroke, the “throw-over”
mechanism again operates, the points again make
contact and the cycle of operation is repeated.
If the magnet is removed from the body for any
reason, care should be taken to ensure that the roll-
ers (10) do not drop out. If the armature and
centre rod have been unscrewed it will be necessary
to reset these.
In order to do this, the magnet should be held in
the left hand and the first finger used to hold the
spring blade out of contact with the rocker. The
armature should now be screwed in as far as pos-
sible and then screwed back gradually and pressed
in and out until, when pressed in, the “throw-over”

mechanism operates. It should then be turned back
a further four holes. The setting is now correct.
The six screws which hold the magnet to the body
may then be screwed into place, but before tighten-
ing these down, the hinge pin (19), on which both

components on the terminal screw.
rockers pivot, should be pulled out, thus allowing
the inner rocker, the armature and the diaphragm
assembly to move further back. The screw may
now be tightened and the hinge pin replaced.
Tracing Troubles
Should the pump cease to function, disconnect
the lead from the terminal, switch on the ignition,
and strike the terminal against the body of the
pump. If a spark occurs, it indicates that the neces-
sary current is available at the terminals and that
the trouble is arising from the pump mechanism. If
Fig. 3.—The method which should be employed to check the
correct setting of the armature.
no spark can be detected, then it is an indication
that the current supply has failed and that attention
should be given to the wiring and the battery. If
current is present, remove the bakelite cover, which
is retained by a terminal nut, touch the terminal
screw with the lead, and if the contact points are
in contact and no spark can be struck off the ter-
minal it is probable that the contact points are dirty
and require cleaning. On the other hand, if the
points are not making contact, see that the tips of
the inner rocker (25) are in contact with the mag-
net housing. If they are not, it is an indication
that the armature has failed to return to the end of
its normal travel. To cure this, loosen the six screws
which attach the magnet housing to the pump body
and make sure that the diaphragm is not sticking
to the face of the magnet housing, by carefully pass-
ing a penknife between the two.
The hinge pin (19) should then be removed and
the six retaining screws tightened up again. The
tips of the inner rockers will probably now be found
to be making contact with the face of the magnet
housing, but if they are not, remove and dismantle
the whole magnet assembly in order to ascertain if
any accumulation of foreign matter has caused a
jam.
Remember that whenever the magnet housing is
removed, care must be taken to see that the guide
rollers (10) do not drop out.
A Noisy Pump
If the pump becomes noisy and works rapidly, it
is usually an indication that an air leak is taking
Fig. 4. —The use of a forked wedge to keep the armature in
the correct position for fitting the diaphragm.


place on the suction side of the pump. Check the
level of the petrol in the tank and see that it is not
too low.
If the connections to the pump are in order and
the trouble persists, then it is probable that an air
leak has developed somewhere in the petrol feed
pipe between the tank and the pump.
The best way to test whether this is so, is to re-
place the feed pipe by a short length of temporary
piping, the mouth of which can be inserted in a tin
of petrol, then switch on the ignition. Then, if the
pump functions properly, it is obvious that a leak
has developed somewhere in the feed pipe between
the tank and the pump. Check all connections for
looseness, and pipes for fractures.
Failure to Deliver the Petrol
Should the pump continue beating without de-
livering petrol, it is probable that some dirt has
become lodged under one of the valves, in which case
they should be dismantled by unscrewing the top or
delivery union, and lifting out the valve case, when
they can be cleaned and reassembled. If, however,
the pump struggles to the pump and becomes very
hot, it is probable that the filter has become clogged.
The filter is readily removed for cleaning by un-
screwing its retaining plug at the bottom of the
pump.
Adjustments to the Petrol Pump
The Contact Breaker
The contact breaker should be assembled on its
pedestal in such a manner that the rockers are free
in their mounting without appreciable side play.
Any excessive side play on the outer rocker will
allow the points to get out of line, while excessive
tightness will make the action of the contact break-
er sluggish and interfere with its action. To obtain
the required freedom in case of tightness, it may be
necessary to square the rocker up with a pair of
thin-nosed pliers. The hinge pin is case-hardened
and on no account must a piece of ordinary wire
Fig. 5. — The correct setting for the contact breaker points is
clearly indicated in this illustration.
be used as a replacement. Always use the correct
hardened pin.
Should the spring contact breaker blade be re-
moved, it should always be replaced bearing
directly against the bakelite pedestal—that is to
say, underneath the tags.
When properly fitted, the blade should rest
against the ledge formed below the opening in the
pedestal for the contact points when the points are
separated, and it should not be so stiff as to prevent
the outer rocker from coming right forward when
the points are in contact. The points should make
contact when the rocker is in its mid way position.
The most simple way to check this is to hold the
blade in contact with the pedestal, taking care
not to press on the overhanging portion, and see
that you can get a .030 feeler between the white
rollers and the cast iron body of the pump. If
necessary, the tip of the blade may be set to give
the correct clearance.
NOTE: The spring washer on the 2 B.A, screw,
to which the “earth” connection is made, should be
fitted between the tag and the pedestal. The reason
for this is that the spring washer is not a reliable
conductor, and the brass tag must therefore, bear
directly against the head of the screw.
All four connections, namely the two ends of the
earthing tag and the two ends of the coil, should
be soldered. The coil end leading to the terminal
should be soldered to its tag and not to the retain-
ing nut. In the case of the terminal screw which
holds the bakelite cover in position, similar consid-
erations apply, the assembly being: spring washer,
wiring tag, lead washer, and recessed nut. Under
no circumstances must the spring washer be omitted
or the assembly short-circuited in any way. Any
attempt to do so is likely to lead to breakage of the
pedestal when the nut retaining the cover in position
is tightened up.
To Adjust the Magnet Assembly
.. Under no circumstances should any attempt be
made to disturb the core of the magnet. The core
can only be located into position correctly with
special press tools, and in any case should not need
to be interfered with. The armature return spring
should be fitted with its large diameter towards the
coil and its small diameter resting against the arma-
ture. This spring must not be stretched, or other-
wise interfered with, or the action of the pump will
be disturbed.
The correct adjustment for the armature, if it
has been removed, is carried out as follows:
1. Spring the contact blade on the pedestal to one
side.
2. Fit the impact washer in the recess of the arma-
ture.
3. Screw the armature into position.
4. Place the eleven guide rollers into position round
the armature.
5. Hold the magnet assembly in the left hand in an
approximately horizontal position.


6. Push the armature in with the thumb of the
right hand, pushing firmly but steadily.
If the contact breaker throws over, the armature
should be screwed in further until it ceases to do so.
It should then be unscrewed one-sixth of a turn at
a time, until a position is found where the contact
breaker just throws over, care being taken to avoid
jerking the armature. It should be pressed in
steadily.
The armature should be correct. UO NOT FOR-
GET THAT THIS SETTING MUST BE CARRIED
OUT WITH THE POINTS OUT OF CONTACT.
When the new diaphragm is fitted it is probable
that considerable pressure will be required to push
the armature right home. If there is any doubt
concerning the point at which the contact breaker
throws over, come back one-sixth of a turn.
7. Place the cast iron body in position on the brass
body, taking care to see that the drain hole in
the cast iron body is at the bottom, in line with
the filter plug of the brass body, and that all the
rollers are in their correct positions. If a roller
drops out of position, it will get trapped between
the two ports, and this will cut a hole in the
diaphragm. Make sure the cast iron body is
seating properly on the brass body, and insert
the five coupling screws and the earth terminal
screw. These screws should not be screwed up
tightly in the first instance as it is absolutely
necessary at this stage to stretch the diaphragm
to its outermost position. This is best effected by
using a special forked wedge to keep the arma-
ture in its extreme position. The wedge is in-
serted between the white rollers of the outer
rocker and pressed under the tips of the inner
rocker, until it lifts the trunnion in the centre of
the inner rocker as far as it will go. If this
wedge is not available, the diaphragm may be
stretched by holding the points in contact by
inserting a matchstick under one of the white
fibre rollers, and passing the current through the
pump. This will excite the magnet, actuate the
armature, and so stretch the diaphragm when
the screws may be tightened down fully.
8. The pump should now be placed on test, using a
cut away cover to enable the contact breaker
action to be observed, and at the same time pre-
vent the rocker hinge pin from falling out.
The pump should be mounted three feet from
the tank for testing, and for which either petrol
or kerosene may be used. The use of a glass
tube and rubber connections between the pump
and the test tank is advisable.
When switched on, the pump should prime
itself promptly and the fluid should flow from
the pump outlet.
NOTE: There are three important points which
are repeatedly overlooked by operators. These ser-
iously affect the functioning of the pump. They
are:
1. To keep the contact breaker blade out of contact
while obtaining the correct diaphragm setting.
2. To press firmly and steadily on the armature in-
stead of jerking it while obtaining the setting.
3. Not stretching the diaphragm to the limit of its
stroke while tightening the body screws.
The 18/85 Carburettors
Type: The carburettors fitted to this engine are
twin down-draught S.U. thermostatically controlled,
with air cleaner and silencer. The construction of
these carburettors can be followed in detail by ref-
erence to the illustration.
The petrol flow to the jet is governed by a float
mechanism of the “top feed” type. Petrol from the
float chamber is led to a jet, the size of which is
regulated by means of a tapered needle attached to
the end of a piston controlled by suction from the
engine. As this suction increases, the needle is grad-
ually withdrawn from the jet, enlarging its effective

opening and permitting it to pass more petrol. The
jet is so mounted that it may easily be moved in or
out relative to the taper needle, in order to weaken
or strengthen the mixture over the whole range.
To Adjust the Carburettors (With the
Thermostatic Starting Device)
1. Run the engine until normal temperature has
been attained.

2. Unscrew the throttle lever adjusting screws as
far as possible and release the pinch bolts securing
the universal joint to the forward carburettor.
3. Remove the brass nuts sealing the adjustable
jets and screw in the jet stops to their full extent
to set the jets in their weakest positions.
4. Screw in the throttle lever adjusting the screw
of the rear carburettor until it is just touching the
stop. From this position give the screw one turn.
This will maintain a relatively fast idling speed
for the rear carburettor and leave the forward car-
burettor out of action.
5. Unscrew the jet adjusting screw of the rear
carburettor until even firing of the engine is
obtained.
NOTE: A fixed jet arrangement is used v since a
thermostatically controlled starting carburettor is
fitted, and care must be taken to see that the jet,
which is spring loaded, moves out with the adjust-
ing screw when enriching the mixture. If the
adjusting pin appears to be quite loose, it
would indicate that the jet is not forced on to the
screw by its return spring; the jet housing nut
should be released slightly, and the assembly
oscillated to centralise the jet.
6. Close the throttle of the rear carburettor by
unscrewing the throttle adjusting screw as far as
possible and then repeat the adjustments of (4) and
(5) on the front carburettor.
1: At this stage, it is necessary to synchronise the
carburettor throttle valves. Fully close both throt-
tles by unscrewing the throttle adjusting screws as
far as possible. Slacken the universal joint.
8. Hold both throttle valves in the closed position
and tighten the front universal joint pinch bolt.
Fig. 7.—Jet of thermostatic carburettor.
9. Screw in the adjusting screws until both are
bearing evenly against the stops and yet not open-
ing the throttle. From this position give each screw
half a turn. This will set the slow running position,
10. Make a final check by noting whether the
beat of the exhaust is even. If it is not so, recheck
the adjustment. Further adjustment is seldom
required, but if this proves necessary, fine read-
justment (no more than £ of a turn either way) of
the jet adjusting screws will prove sufficient. If
there is any need for alterations of the throttle
adjustment, both adjusting screws must be moved
an equal amount.
The Thermostatic Controlled
Starting- Carburettor
This consists of an auxiliary jet (42), controlled
by a tapered needle (45), and fed from the main
float chamber (33). Fuel emerging from the main
jet passes upward between the shank of the needle
(46) and the bore formed in the body through which
it passes. Air at the same time enters through the
passage (40) and mixes with the jet discharge. The
emulsion thus formed is mixed with a further supply
of air which passes downwards between a clearance
provided between the disc (47) fixed to the needle
(45) and the bore surrounding the disc. The assem-
bly comprising the disc and the needle can move
vertically, and is normally spring-loaded upwards
by means of the spring (46). The mixture thus
formed passes between the valve (36) and its seat-
ing, and is drawn through the tube into the induc-
tion pipe of the engine. It will thus be seen that
an additional amount of mixture is drawn directly
into the induction pipe, irrespective of the main
throttle position, and serves to provide the starting
mixture and also enrich the mixture generally, so
long as the device is in action. The moveable parts
(47) and (45) are normally held in the position
shown. Thus when the engine is first started and
the suction created in the induction pipe is low, a
rich mixture will be provided, since the needle
(45) will be withdrawn from the jet. Immediately
the engine starts, a high degree of suction will be
obtained in the induction pipe, and consequently a
strong flow through the auxiliary carburettor.
The high velocity of the air passing between the
disc (47) and the bore surrounding this will be
sufficient to draw the assembly downwards against
the action of the spring, and the needle will enter
the jet (42) to a greater extent and diminish its
effective area. Under these conditions, only a
moderate enrichment will be provided. In this way
an excess of petrol, which will otherwise to obtained
under these conditions, will be avoided.
Immediately the throttle is opened, the induction
depression will be diminished and the velocity of the
air past the disc will fall and so permit the assembly
to rise again and provide a greater discharge from
the jet.
The valve (36) is held off its seating by means .of
solenoid (38), which raises the iron core (37) to


which the valve disc is attached. As long as the
current is flowing through the solenoid, this valve
will be opened and the auxiliary carburettor will
be in action.
To Set the Auxiliary Carburettor
The only adjustment provided consists in setting
the stop screw (48) which limits the movement of
the needle (45). Screwing this down weakens, and
screwing it up strengthens, the idling mixture. The
engine having been allowed to attain its normal
working temperature, the auxiliary carburettor
should be brought into action by short circuiting
the thermostatic switch.
A convenient way of doing this, while the adjust-
ment is being made, is to connect the switch ter-
To Adjust the Carburettor
There are four troubles which may affect the cor-
rect functioning of the S.U. carburettors.
1. A piston may be sticking and not working
correctly.
2. There may be dirt or water in the carburettor,
3. The end float mechanism may have become der-
minal to the body of the switch with a screwdriver,
and momentarily flick open the throttle to release
the valve. The stop screw should now be adjusted
upwards to an extent just short of that which will
make the engine run unevenly; in other words, the
engine should be given the strongest mixture possi-
ble upon which it will fire on all its cylinders. If
on the next occasion upon which the engine is
started from cold, difficulty is experienced, the stop
screw should be unscrewed by another half a turn.
NOTE: Should difficulty at any time be exper-
ienced in starting the engine when hot, a start can
usually be achieved by holding the accelerator down
while the starter motor is operated.
Fig. 8.—Details of the thermostatic starting device.


ranged and one of the carburettors is in consequence
flooding or cutting off the petrol supply.
4. Incorrect setting of the two carburettors.
Given below are details of the adjustments neces-
sary to overcome these troubles.
1. Sticking pistons:
The suction piston assembly comprises the piston,
the suction disc formed in one casting with the pis-
ton, the hardened and ground piston rod which oper-
ates in the bearing in the suction chamber, and
finally the needle which is inserted in the end of the
piston rod. The contact between the piston rod and
the bearing in which this operates is the only con-
tact which should occur between the moving assem-
bly comprising the parts mentioned above and the
stationary assembly comprising the body, suction
chamber and the jet. If contact occurs at any other
point, or the piston becomes dry and sticky in its
bush, the piston may fail to return to its closed
position under the influence of the spring. Remove
the air silencer pipe assembly, and check the piston
by inserting a finger in the air intake and moving
the piston. The piston should move quite freely.
Sticking of the piston is usually caused by lack of
oil between the piston rod and its hub and can gen-
erally be cured by introducing, through the lubrica-
tor provided, a few drops of kerosene, after which
the piston should be operated up and down several
times and finally a few drops of thin oil inserted
through the lubricator.
Fig. 9.—Carburettor in section, showing its internal
construction.
NOTE; In no circumstances should a heavy lubri-
cant such as engine oil be used for the purpose.
If the piston is found to be sticking through some
cause other than lack of lubrication or friction at
this point, the suction chamber and piston assembly
should be removed by unscrewing the two brass
securing screws, and the bore of the suction cham-
ber together with the outside of the suction disc
and piston, carefully cleaned. Under no circum-
stances should any lubricant be introduced between
theSe parts, as the presence of oil between the suc-
tion disc and the chamber will seriously interfere
with the working of the carburettor.
Great care must be exercised when doing this, to
see that the delicate tapered jet needle is not dam-
aged or bent.
2. Water or Dirt in the Carburettor:
This trouble is not a frequent one with S.U. car-
burettors, owing to the size of the jet and the petrol
passages. If, however, water or dirt is suspected,
the piston should be moved away from the jet, so
that the jet orifice can be clearly seen. Switch on
the ignition and flood the carburettor by holding
down the tickler pin in the top of the float chamber.
If, after holding the tickler pin down for some time,
a free flow of petrol is not observed through the
jet, some blockage is indicated. This may usually
be corrected by starting the engine, opening the
throttle and momentarily blocking up the air inlet
by placing the hand over it and at the same time,
keeping the throttle well open. Foreign matter can
usually be cleared by this method, but on no account
must this method be overdone, or damaging quan-
tities of neat petrol will be sucked into the cylinders.
Should this treatment fail to clear the obstruc-
tion, the jet and its assembly must be removed by
unscrewing the nut at the bottom of the carburettor
body.
When refitting the jet great care must be taken
to centralise it, for unless the jet mounting assem-
bly is thoroughly understood, this process presents
some difficulty. To ensure a free flow of petrol to the
float chambers, the filters situated behind the union
nut at the junction of the petrol pipe to the float
chamber top should occasionally be removed (every
6,000 miles) and thoroughly cleaned. The filters are
released by unscrewing the petrol pipe unions, and
must be cleaned in petrol with a stiff brush (never
use rag to clean a filter). When replacing the filter,
remember that the helical spring is first introduced
into the filter housing, and that the thimble-like
filter has its open end in contact with the hexagon
union piece.
3. Flooding of the float chamber:
This fault is generally caused by the presence of
grit between the float chamber needle and its seat.
It can usually be corrected by depressing the tickler
pin which permits a flow of petrol past the needle
and seating sufficient to wash away the foreign mat-
ter. Should this not remedy the fault, the float


chamber cover should be removed and the needle
twisted on its seating a few times. The seating
should on no account be ground in.
The general cleanliness of the fuel and the petrol
tank should be checked.
4 Float chamber empty:
When this is not caused by the floating needle
sticking on its seating, thus cutting off the petrol
supply, it may be the result of gummy or resinous
matter in solution in the petrol adhering to the nee-
dle and making it stick on its seating.
Trouble of this nature is corrected by removing
the float chamber cover and carefully cleaning and
freeing the needle. The needle should be given a
few turns on its seating before replacing the cover.
The general cleanliness of the petrol and petrol tank
should be checked.
Electrical Connections
One lead is taken from the ignition switch to one
of the terminals and the other terminal is connected
to a thermostatic switch on the cooling system at a
point on the right side rear of the engine.
This switch is so arranged that when the cooling
water of the engine is cold, a circuit is provided
from the terminal to earth. Immediately the water
attains a temperature predetermined by the thermo-
stat, the points will open and no return circuit will
be provided. The circuit through the solenoid thus
having been broken, the core will be released and
the valve will return to its seating, so putting the
whole device out of action.
NOTE: All adjustments must be made with the
engine warm and at its normal running temperature.
The thermostatic switch oomtrol was altered to a
push-pull manual switch on later cars. This is sit-
uated to the right of the centre of the instrument
panel, and adjacent to it there is also a warning
light which glows when the starting carburettor is
in operation.
Electrical Connections
(For Hand Control Choke Switch)
In place of the direct connection from the ignition
switch to the solenoid, the hand switch is connected
in series in this circuit. A wire is taken from the
ignition switch to the hand switch and a second
wire is taken from the other terminal of the hand
switch to the terminal of the solenoid.
The other terminal is connected to earth. Two
more wires are used, one from the second terminal
°f the hand switch to one terminal of the warning
light and one from the other terminal of the light
to earth.
NOTE: The process known as “warming up” is
not necessary and should be avoided. The car
should be driven straight on to the road and after
three or four minutes the choke switch returned to
the “off” position. Should the engine then show
signs of hesitating, bring the choke switch into use
again momentarily,
14/60 Carburettors
The construction of the carburettors can be fol-
lowed in detail by referring to “The Thermostatic
Controlled Carburettor”.
The petrol flow to the jet is governed by a float
mechanism of the “top feed” type. Petrol from the
float chamber is led to a jet, the size of which is
regulated by means of a tapered needle attached
to the end of a piston controlled by suction from
the engine. | \
As this suction increases, the needle is withdrawn
from the jet, enlarging its effective opening and
permitting it to pass more petrol.
The jet is so mounted that it may be moved in
or out relative to the tapered needle, in order to
weaken or strengthen the mixture.
To Adjust the 14/60 Carburettors
1. Run the engine until the normal running
temperature is reached.
2. Disconnect the connecting rod between the jet
actuating levers.
3. Unscrew the throttle adjusting screws as far
as possible and release the pinch bolts securing the
universal joint to the forward carburettor.
4. Screw in the jet stop nuts to their full extent
to set the jets in their weakest position.
5. Screw in the throttle adjusting screw of the
rear carburettor until it is just touching its stop.
From this position give the screw one turn in.
This will maintain a relatively fast idling speed
for the rear carburettor and leave the front one
out of action.
6. Unscrew the jet adjusting nut of the rear-
carburettor until even firing of the engine is
obtained.
7. Close the throttle of the rear carburettor by
unscrewing the throttle adjusting screw as far
as possible and then repeat the adjustments 4, 5
and 6, on the front carburettor.
8. At this stage it is necessary to synchronise
the carburettor throttle valves in their closed
position and tighten the front universal joint
pinch bolts.
9. Screw the throttle adjusting screws until both
are just bearing evenly on their stops, and not
opening the throttle. From this position give each
screw half a turn, this will set the slow; running
position.
Make a final check for even firing by noting the
beat of the exhaust.
Further adjustment is seldom required, but if
this proves necessary, fine readjustments no more
than turn either way on the jet adjusting nuts
will prove sufficient. If there is any need for
alteration on the throttle adjustment, both adjust-
ing screws must be moved an equal amount.

To Locate the Cause of Uneven Firing
1. Start the engine and set it to run at a fast
idling speed.
2. Short circuit each plug in turn by placing a
blade of a wooden-handled screwdriver between
the terminal and the cylinder head. No difference
in engine performance will be noted when short
circuiting the plug which is not firing. Shorting
the other plugs will make uneven firing more
pronounced.
3. Having located the plug which is at fault, stop
the engine and remove the cable and terminal from
the sparking plug. Restart the engine and hold
the end of the cable about from the cylinder
head.
4. If the sparking is strong and regular, the fault
probably lies in the sparking plug. Remove the
plug, clean and adjust the gap to the correct setting,
or alternatively fit a replacement plug.
5. If there is no spark, or if it is weak and
irregular, examine the cable from the sparking plug
to the distributor. After a long period of service,
the rubber insulation may be cracked or perished
and the cable should be replaced. Finally, examine
the moulded distributor cap, wipe the inside and
the outside with a clean dry cloth, see that the
carbon brush moves freely in its holder, and
examine the moulding closely for signs of
breakdown.
After long service it may have become tracked,
that is, a conducting path may have formed between
two or more of the electrodes or between one of
the electrodes and some part of the distributor in
contact with the cap. Evidence of a tracked cap
is shown by the presence of a thin black line in
the places indicated. A replacement moulded cap
must be fitted in place of one that has tracked.
To Test the Low Tension Circuit
1. Spring back the securing clips on the distribu-
tor and remove the moulded cap and rotor. If
the rotor is a tight fit it can be carefully levered
off with a screwdriver.
2. Check that the contacts are clean and free
from pits, burns, or oil or grease. Turn the engine
and check that the contacts are opening and closing
correctly and that the clearance when the contacts
are fully opened is .010 to .012. Correct as
necessary.
3. Switch on the ignition, and whilst an assistant
turns the engine with the starting handle, observe


the ammeter reading. This should rise and fall
with the opening and closing of the contacts.
If the reading fluctuates in this manner, the low
tension circuit is in order.
4, If the ammeter reading remains steady, locate
the fault in the low tension circuit.
5. Another method of testing is to remove the
cable connecting the “CB” terminal on the coil to
the low tension on the distributor, and connect a
test lamp between these two terminals. Switch on
the ignition, and if the lamp lights when the con-
tacts close and goes out when the contacts open,
the low tension circuit is in order.
To Locate Faults in the Low Tension Circuit
1. Should the test show that the fault lies in the
low tension circuit, switch on the ignition and turn
the engine until the contact points are fully opened,
2. Refer to the wiring diagram and check the
circuit with a voltmeter (0 to 20 volts) as follows;
Note: If the circuit is in order, the reading of
the voltmeter should be approximately 12 volts.
3. .Starter switch to ammeter (black and yellow
cable):
Connect the voltmeter between -the terminals
and a good earthing point. No reading indicates
a damaged cable or loose connections at the
starter switch, junction box or ammeter.
4. Ammeter:
Connect the voltmeter to the ammeter terminal
and earth. No reading indicates a fault in the
ammeter, which must be replaced.
5. Ammeter to control box (purple and white
cable):
Connect the voltmeter to the control box terminal
and earth. No reading indicates a damaged
cable or loose connections at the ammeter or
control box.
6. Control box to lighting switch (black and white
cable):
Connect the voltmeter to the switch terminal
and earth. No reading indicates a damaged cable
or loose connections.
Fig. 1. —High tension terminal.
7. Ignition switch:
Connect the voltmeter to the other terminal of
the ignition switch and earth. No reading
indicates a fault in the ignition switch.
8. Ignition switch terminal to control box terminal
(white cable):
Connect the voltmeter to the control box ter-
minal and earth. No reading indicates a
damaged cable or loose connections.
9. Lighting switch to ignition switch (black and
white cable):
Connect the voltmeter to the ignition switch
terminal and earth. No reading indicates a
damaged cable or loose connection.
10. Control box to ignition coil terminal (white
cable):
Connect the voltmeter to the ignition coil
terminal and earth. No reading indicates a
damaged or loose connection.
11. Ignition coil:
Disconnect the cable from the terminal of the
coil and connect the voltmeter between this
terminal and the earth. No reading indicates
a fault in the primary winding of the coil. If
a correct reading is given restore the original
connection to the terminal.
12. Ignition coil to distributor (white and brown
cable):
Connect the voltmeter to the distributor low
tension terminal and earth. No reading indicates
a damaged cable or loose connection. Discon-
nect the cable from the low tension terminal of
the distributor and connect the voltmeter to the
end of this cable and earth. No reading indi-
cates a damaged cable or loose connections on
the coil. If a correct reading is given, restore
the original connection.
18. Contact breaker and condenser:
Connect the voltmeter across the contact breaker
points. No reading indicates a fault in the
condenser.
To Examine High Tension Cables
1. The high tension cable must be carefully
examined, and any which have the insulation
cracked, perished or damaged must be replaced.
2. To fit the cable to the terminals, thread the
moulded terminal over the cable, bare the end of
the cable for about thread the wire through the
copper washer removed from the original cable and
bend back the strands. Finally screw the terminal
back into the distributor cover.
3. The cable from the distributor to the sparking
plugs must be connected in the correct firing order.
The firing order for this engine is 1, 5, 3,6, 2, 4.
No. 1 cylinder is nearest the radiator.


Care of the Sparking Plugs.
The sparking plugs should be cleaned in a special
plug cleaner, but if this is not available, a stiff
brush dipped in petrol is the best substitute.
Set the plug points to a gap of .018 to .020.
Care of the Contact Breaker Mechanism
1. Turn the engine until the contact breaker
points are fully opened, and check the gap with a
gauge .012 thick. To adjust the setting, keep the
engine in the position to give the maximum opening
of the contacts and then slacken off the two screws
securing the fixed contact plate. Adjust the position
of the plate until the gap is correct to the gauge;
then tighten the two locking screws.
2. If the contacts are dirty or pitted, clean by
polishing them with a fine carborundum stone, and
afterwards wiping away the dirt with a petrol-
moistened cloth. The moving contact can be
removed from its mounting to assist cleaning. Check
and adjust the contact breaker setting after
cleaning.
3. Check that the moving arm is free on its pivot.
If it is sluggish, remove the arm and polish the
pivot pin with a strip of fine emery cloth. Then
apply a light smear of thin lubricating oil to the
pin.
Distributor Lubrication
To be carried out after servicing the distributor
and at intervals of about 6,000 miles.
1. Give the cam a light smear of clean engine
oil and apply a slight trace of oil to the top of the
pivot on which the contact breaker lever operates.
2. Lift the rotor arm off the top of the spindle
and add a few drops of thin machine oil through
the lubricator hole provided in the spindle. (Do
not remove the screw in the top of the spindle as
there is an oil way provided). Refit the rotor arm
correctly and push it on to the shaft as far as it
will go.
3. Add a few drops of thin machine oil through
the hole in the contact breaker base through which
the cam passes, in order to lubricate the automatic
timing control.
Fig. 2.—Contact breaker.
To Remove and Replace the Distributor
When removing the distributor from the engine,
it is advisable to set the engine so that it is firing
on No. 1 or No. 6 cylinder and the hole drilled
in the inner side of the crankshaft pulley is opposite
the arrow marking on the timing cover. Next
mark the position of the rotor arm on the distributor
body. Release the distributor by removing the
retaining bolt underneath the distributor body and
then withdraw it from the bush in the cylinder
block. On no account disturb the clamp and pinch
bolt at the base of the distributor, or the timing
will be lost. To replace, put the rotor arm in the
correct position—that is, in line with the mark on
the distributor body. Then slide the distributor into
its bush in the crankcase body, the driven gear on
the distributor will automatically fall into the
driving gear on the camshaft. Replace the retaining
bolt and tighten. The timing should always be
checked after this operation.
Ignition Timing
It will be necessary to reset the ignition if the
distributor body clamp bolt has been loosened and
the distributor turned on its mounting, also follow-
Fig. 3. —Exploded view of the distributor.


ing any repair or overhaul which has involved the
disturbing of the driven and driving gear.
The following procedure should be taken: —
1. Set the gap between the contact breaker points
to .012 when in their maximum open position.
2. Set the vernier scale on the distributor to zero.
3. Turn the engine until it is in position for firing
No. 1 cylinder (No. 1 cylinder is next to the
radiator) and the hole drilled in the inner side of
the crankshaft pulley is in line with the arrow on
the timing chain coVer.
NOTE: When the inlet valve of No. 6 cylinder
is just opening, No. 1 piston is on its firing stroke
and vice versa.
4. Release the distributor body by unscrewing the
clamp bolt of the bracket securing the distributor.
First rotate the distributor body anti-clockwise
until the points are fully closed, and then in a
clockwise direction, i.e., against the direction of
rotation of the arm, until the contact points just
commence to open. Secure it in this position by
tightening the nut of the clamp bolt.
IMPORTANT: Check that the cam commencing
to open the contact points is the correct one for
the cylinder that is on the firing stroke.
5. To obtain an accurate setting, some method
which does not depend on the accuracy of the eye
should be used to determine the actual position at
which the points break contact. The following
procedure can be used. Disconnect the centre high
tension wire from the distributor cap and hold it
to form a small gap with some nearby metal part.
As the head of the distributor is slowly moved
clockwise, there will be a spark across the gap
immediately the points open; this is the exact
position in which the distributor body should be
locked. Finally recheck the timing to see that no
movement has taken place.
To Dismantle the Distributor
1. Spring back the two securing clips and remove
the moulded cap.
2. Lift the rotor off the top of the spindle. If
it is a tight fit, it should be carefully prised off
with a small screwdriver.
3. To remove the moving contact, slacken the
terminal nut and lock nut on the terminal post,
lift the end of the spring off the post and remove
the contact breaker lever from its pivot pin. Take
out the two pins complete with spring washers and
flat steel washers from the base plate carrying the
fixed contact, lift the insulating washer off the
pivot pin and remove the plate.
4. Take out the screw from the condenser band
clip. Unscrew the terminal nut, lift off the spring
washer and remove the condenser.
5. Take out the two screws from the low tension
terminal block and lift off the block complete with
terminal post and insulating plate.
6. Undo the two screws fitted at the edge of the
contact breaker base and lift them out, together
with the spring washers. The contact breaker base
can then be removed from the body of the
distributor.
7. Remove the driving gear from the shaft, by
driving out the pin securing the gear to the shaft.
8. Lift the cam, automatic control and shaft
assembly from the distributor body. Before dis-
mantling, carefully note the positions in which the
various components are fitted in order that they
can be replaced correctly. Take out the screw from
inside the top of the cam spindle; the automatic
timing control is then accessible.
To Replace the Bearing Bushes
1. In order to ensure easy running of the
distributor shaft when the shank has been rebushed,
the new bushes must be fitted so that they are in
correct alignment. The bushes must be fitted by
means of a vertical drilling machine or hand press,
using a mandrel and packing block. Before fitting
the new bushes, they should be allowed to stand
for 24 hours with | of their length immersed in
thin machine oil.
2. Fit the mandrel in a drilling machine or hand
press and place the distributor body in an inverted
position on the table below it.
3. To remove the bushes, a sleeve must be fitted
over the mandrel to build it up to the required
size. With this sleeve in position, force the old
bushes out of the shank by applying a steady
pressure.
4. Take the sleeve off the mandrel. Place one of
the longer bushes on the mandrel, then the
distributor body in an inverted position, and finally
one of the smaller bushes.
5. Locate the end of the mandrel through the
packing piece and press the mandrel downwards,
taking care that both the bushes enter the
distributor shank squarely. Continue forcing the
bushes into the shank until the mandrel reaches
the end of its travel.
Fig. 4. —The method to use when fitting a distributor bush.


6. After fitting, the bushes must NOT be opened
out by reamering or any other means, as this would
tend to impair their porosity, and so prevent
effective lubrication from being obtained.
To Reassemble the Distributor
1. Assemble the automatic control, taking care
that the parts are fitted in their original positions
and that the control springs are not
Place the cam on its spindle, locate the pins of its
base plate in the holes in the toggle arms and
secure by tightening the locking screw.
2. Fit the shaft in its bearings and replace the
driving gear, making sure that the securing pin is
driven in tightly.
3. Place the contact breaker base in position on
the distributor body and secure it by replacing the
two screws. A spring washer must be fitted under
each of the screw heads and the screws must be
fully tightened.
4. Assemble the insulating plate, terminal post
and moulded terminal block and secure them in
position on the contact breaker base. Secure the
condenser connecting strip under the head of the
terminal post.
5. Insert the terminal post of the condenser
through the hole in the connector. Replace the
spring washer and tighten the nut. Secure the
band clip by replacing and tightening the fixing
screw.
6. Position the plate carrying the fixed contact
on the breaker base and secure it by replacing
and lightly tightening the two screws, first placing
a spring Avasher and flat steel washer under the
heads of the two screws. Place the insulating
Avasher over the contact pivot pin and position the
contact breaker lever over the pivot pin. Locate
the end of the contact breaker spring over the
terminal post next to the condenser connector strip,
and secure them both in position by tightening
the lock nut. Adjust the contact breaker setting
to give a gap of .012 Avhen fully opened.
NOTE: If it becomes necessary to reneAV the
contacts, a replacement set comprising fixed and
moving contacts must be fitted.
7. Place the rotor on the spindle, locating the
register correctly, and push it home.
8. Fit the moulded cap and secure it by means
of the two spring clips.

Running Adjustments
The only adjustment necessary throughout the
life of the driven plate friction facings, is to restore
free movement to the clutch pedal. As the driven
plate facings wear, the free movement of the clutch
pedal will gradually decrease. When it is reduced
to i inch (measured at the pedal pad) adjustment
must be made to restore the correct amount of free
movement, i.e., 1 inch. For correcting this clearance,
proceed as follows:
There are two points to cheek:
1. FREE MOVEMENT OF THE PEDAL SHOULD
NOT BE LESS THAN 1 INCH,
2. TOTAL TRAVEL OF THE CLUTCH PEDAL.
This is measured between the stop pad on the clutch
pedal and the lower stop screw on the fulcrum
bracket. This should be not more than inch.
If the free movement is less than 1 inch, slacken
the adjusting barrel nut on the adjusting link by
the clutch lever. This nut is spring-loaded and no
locknut is required.
If the total travel of the clutch pedal is more
than \ inch, slacken off the lock nut on the bottom
stop screw on the pedal fulcrum bracket and adjust
the stop screw by the requisite amount. Tighten up
the lock nut and recheck.
NOTE: Over-travel of the release bearing leads
to close coiling of the thrust springs and brings
undue stress on the internal parts of the clutch
and the graphite release bearing, which will wear
rapidly.
To Remove the Clutch
1. Remove the gearbox. The gearbox should be
supported during this operation to prevent strain
on the shaft and distortion of the driven plate
assemblv.
2. Insert L-shaped spacers between the release
levers and cover. Hold them firmly in position,
slacken the holding screws a turn or two at a time
by diagonal selection until the spacers are gripped
firmly between the levers and the cover (this
relieves the spring pressure on the holding screws).
3. The holding screws can now be removed and
the clutch complete lifted away from the flywheel.
To Dismantle the Clutch
1. Suitably mark the cover and release levers in
such a manner that they can be reassembled in the
same relative positions to one another, and so
preserve balance and adjustment.
Fig. 1. —Sectional view of the clutch.


Fig. 2. —The clutch spacer fitting.
2. Detach the release lever plate and place the
cover assembly under a press with a pressure plate
resting on wooden blocks so arranged that the
cover is free to move downwards.
3. Place a block of wood across the top of the
cover, resting on the spring bosses. ,
4. Compress the cover with the spindle of the
press and, holding it under compression, remove
the split pins and the adjusting nuts, also the
L-shaped spacers previously inserted to hold the
springs from flying out.
5. Lift the cover off. This will expose all the
components for inspection.
6. Remove the release levers by holding the
levers and eye bolts between the finger and thumb,
so that the inner end of the lever and the eye bolt
are as near together as possible, keeping the eye bolt
pin in position in the lever.
7. The strut can be lifted over the ridge on the
end of the lever, making it possible to lift the eye
bolt off the pressure plate.
To Assemble the Clutch
1. Thoroughly clean all parts and replace any
which show appreciable wear.
2. Place the pressure plate on blocks under the
press and place the thrust springs vertically on it,
seating them on the bosses on the pressure plate.
3. Assemble the release levers, eye bolts, and eye
bolt pins, holding the threaded end of the eye bolt
and the inner end of the lever as close together as
possible. With the other hand insert the strut in
the slots of the pressure plate lug just sufficiently
to allow the plain end of the eye bolt to be inserted
in the hole in the pressure plate. Move the strut
upward into the slots in the pressure plate lugs,
and over the ridge on the short end of the levers,
so that it drops into the grooves formed in the
levers.
4. Lay the cover over the assembled parts, taking
care that the anti-rattle springs are in the position
shown and that the springs are directly under the
seats in the cover. Also make sure, if using the
original parts, that the eye bolt nuts, eye bolts,
pressure plate lugs and cover are fitted in their
relative position as marked when dismantling, to
ensure correct balance being maintained.
5. Lay a bar or wooden block across the cover
and compress it with the press spindle, taking great
care to guide the eye bolts and the pressure plate
lugs through the correct holes in the cover. Make
sure, also that the thrust springs remain correctly
in their seats.
6. Fit the eye bolt nuts on the eye bolts and
secure them with the split pins.
7. Holding the cover under compression, place
the L-shaped spacer washers between the release
levers and the cover. Maintain them carefully in
this position while the pressure plate is released
and until the spacers are gripped between the
levers and the cover.
8. Fit the release lever plate on the tips of the
levers by means of the retaining springs.
NOTE: If new parts have been fitted which may

affect the adjustment, the levers should be adjusted
by means of the Borg & Beck service gauge, before
final assembly.
To Replace the Clutch
1. Place the driven plate assembly in the flywheel
with the chamfered end of the hub facing away
from the flywheel.
2. Centralise the driven plate by means of a
dummy shaft which fits the splined bore of the
plate hub and the pilot bearing in the flywheel.
3. Fit the cover assembly to the flywheel by the
holding screws, tightening them a partial turn at
a time by diagonal selection. Do not remove the
dummy shaft until the holding bolts are securely
tightened.
4. Remove the L-shaped spacers directly they
become free which will be as the holding screws
become tight.

Fig. 7.—Setting the release levers with the gauge plate in
position.
5. Remove the dummy shaft.
6. Refit the withdrawal bearing and the gearbox.
NOTE: The weight of the gearbox must be
supported during refitting in order to prevent strain
on the shaft and distortion of the driven plate
assembly.
To Adjust the Release Levers
Satisfactory operation of the clutch is dependent
on the accurate adjustment of the release levers.
This must be carried out before the clutch has been
assembled to the flywheel and should only be
necessary if any new parts have been fitted. The
maximum allowable difference in the height of the
release levers is .015. To obtain this accuracy most
easily, use the special gauge plate CGr.l92 in
conjunction with the flywheel. The flywheel may
be mounted on the engine or lying on the bench,
proceed as follows:
1. Place the gauge plate centrally in the flywheel
in the place of the driven plate.
2. Fit the cover assembly to the flywheel by the
holding screws and tighten them a partial turn at
a time by diagonal selection, until the L-shaped
spacers can be removed. Then fully tighten the
holding screws.
3. Place a short straight edge across the gauge
plate boss and the tip of one release lever. If
necessary, turn the eye bolt nut until the tip of the
lever is exactly level with the top of the boss.
4. Adjust the other levers in the same manner.
If carefully carried out, the setting should be
within .005.
5. Insert the L-shaped spacers between the release
levers and the cover, and slacken off the holding
screws a partial turn at a time by diagonal selec-
tion, until the spacers are gripped tightly to relieve
the spring pressure. Then remove the holding
Fig. 8. —Gauge plate.
screws fully and lift the clutch complete from the
gauge plate.
6. Remove the gauge plate.
7. A hole should then be drilled through each
adjusting nut and eye bolt and the corresponding
size split pin inserted. Take great care not to
disturb the position of the nut, as this would upset
the adjustment.
NOTE: If the gauge is not available, arrange for
a distance of Iff between the tips of the levers and
the face of the pressure plate.
To Reface the Driven Plate
1. Drill out the rivets, using a drill. DO NOT
PUNCH OUT.
2. Rivet one new facing in position, using a
blunt-ended centre punch to roll the rivet shanks
securely against the steel plate if a proper tool
is not available,
3. Rivet the second facing on the opposite side
of the plate, with the clearance holes over the
rivet heads already formed in fitting the first
facing.
4. Mount the plate on a mandrel and check the
run out as near the edge as possible. If the error
is more than .015, press over the high spots until
it is true within this figure.

axle flange, carefully mark the flanges to assist
in refitting them to their original position.
Remove the bolts and nuts securing the propellor
shaft to the gearbox flange and gently lower it
on to the frame crossmember. Then remove the
bolts and nuts securing the shaft to the rear axle
flange and slide the shaft out towards the rear
of the car.
Fig. 1.—Propeller shaft, showing lubrication nipples.
To Dismantle the Propellor Shaft
Unscrew the dust cap at the rear end of the
sliding joint and pull the joint off the splined shaft.
Remove the enamel and dirt from the snap rings
and the bearing races. Remove all the snap rings
by pinching their ears together with a pair of
thin-nosed pliers and prising them out with a
screwdriver.
If a ring does not slide out of its groove readily,
tap the end of the bearing race lightly to relieve
the pressure against the ring.
Holding the joint in the left hand with the splined
sleeve yoke on the top, tap the radius of the yoke
lightly with a copper hammer. The top bearing
should begin to emerge; turn the joint over and
finally remove it with the fingers. If necessary,
tap the bearing race from inside with a small dia-
meter bar, taking care not to damage the bearing
race. Keep the joint in this position so as to avoid
dropping the needle rollers. Repeat this operation
for the opposite bearing.
The splined sleeve yoke can be removed. Rest
the two exposed trunnions on wood or lead blocks

stage of dismantling the universal joint after removing the
retaining circlip.

to protect their ground surfaces, and tap the ears
of the flange yoke to remove the bearing race.
Turn the yoke over and repeat the operation.
Reverse the assembly and repeat the operation.
Wash all the parts. Reassemble, with replace-
ments where necessary.
To Examine and Check for Wear
The parts most likely to show signs of wear after
long usage are the bearing races and the spider
journals. Should looseness, load markings or distor-
tion be observed, the affected parts must be renewed
complete, since no oversize! journals or bearing
races are provided.
It is essential that the bearing races are a light
drive fit in the yoke trunnions. In the event of
wear taking place in the yoke cross holes, rendering
them oval, the yokes must be renewed. The fixed
yoke, which is part of the tubular shaft assembly,
Fig. 4.—When the needle roller bearings have been withdrawn
from opposite sides of the spider the joint can be separated
as shown.
Fig. 5.—When dismantling the universal joint it is permissible
to tap out the bearings with a small diameter rod from the
inside as shown, provided care is taken not to damage the
roller face.
Fig. 6.—When replacing the gasket retainer use should be
made of a hollow drift to tap it into place without damage.


Fig. 7. —The correct method of assembling the universal joints.
should only be replaced in cases of emergency. It
should normally be replaced by a complete tubular
shaft assembly. The other parts likely to show
signs of wear are the splined sleeve yoke or splined
stub shaft, A total of .004 circumferential move-
ment, measured on the outside diameter of the
spline, should not be exceeded.
Should the splined stub shaft require renewing,
this must be dealt with in the same way as the
fixed yoke, i.e., a replacement tubular shaft fitted.
To Reassemble the Propeller Shaft
See that all the drilled holes in the journals are
cleaned out and filled with oil. Assemble the needle
rollers in the bearing races and fill with oil. Should
difficulty be experienced in assembly, smear the
walls of the races with grease to retain the rollers
m position while reassembling.
Insert the spider in the flange yoke. Using a
soft-nosed drift about in. smaller in diameter than
the hole in the yoke, tap the bearing into position.
It is essential that the bearing races are a light
fit in the yoke trunnions. Repeat this operation for
the other three bearings. Replace the circlips and
be sure that the trunnions in the sliding and fixed
joints are in line. This can be checked by observing
that the arrows marked on the splined sleeve yoke
and the splined stub shaft are in line. It is always
advisable to replace the cork gaskets and gasket
retainers on the spider journals, using the tubular
drift. The spider journal shoulders should be shel-
lacked prior to fitting the retainers to ensure a
good oil seal.
When the needle roller bearings have been with-
drawn from the opposite sides of the spider the
joint can be separated.
To Replace the Shaft Assembly
Wipe the faces of the companion flanges clean,
ensure that the register engages and that the joint
faces bed down correctly all round.
Insert the bolts and see that all the nuts are
evenly tightened all round and securely locked and
cottered. The sliding joint is always placed towards
the gearbox.

To Remove the Rear Hub
Jack up the rear axle and remove the hub cover
and road wheel. Remove the five screws securing
the brake drum to the hub. Withdraw the brake
drum. Withdraw the driving shaft. (This will
expose the large hub retaining nut).
Tap back the tabs of the locking washer and
remove the nut.
NOTE: The left side nut is a left hand thread.
The hub, complete with its bearing and oil seal,
can now be withdrawn. Use a claw extractor.
To Remove and Replace the Plate Assembly
Remove the wheel, brake drum, driving shaft and
hub.
Disconnect the brake pipe from the back of the
wheel cylinder. (Take care of the two copper joint-
ing washers).
Disconnect the front end of the hand brake cable
from its balance link (inside the vehicle).
Release the cable from its front abutment bracket
(this is situated on the frame directly under the
hand brake lever), also remove the bolt securing
the centre abutment bracket to the frame.
Remove the six bolts and nuts securing the brake
back plate to the axle tube flange.
The brake plate can now be withdrawn complete
with brake assembly.
Replacement is the reversal of the above.
NOTE .• Replace all spring washers before tight-
ening the securing bolts. Care must be taken to
clean and replace the copper washers on each side
of the brake pipe banjo unions.
The brakes must be bled whenever the above
°peration is carried out.
To Replace the Rear Hub
Check the hub oil seal for damage or wear and
replace if necessary.
To be fitted correctly, the lip of the sealing edge
of the seal should face towards the bearing. Replace
the hub complete with bearings and oil seal.
The bearing is a tight sliding fit on the a'xle
extension, so it must be gently tapped into position
by means of a tube large enough in diameter to slide
over the centre tube of the axle.
Place the lock washer and nut into position and
tighten the nut.
Finally tap over the lock washer tabs on to the
flats of the nut.
NOTE : The hub retaining nuts have right and left
hand threads. Right side is right hand, left side
is left hand.
Replace the driving shaft.
Replace the brake drum.
Replace the wheel and hub cover and lower the
car to the ground.
To Remove and Replace the Differential Unit

Raise the rear of the car until' the wheels are
clear of the ground.
Remove the wheels, brake drums and the driving
shafts.
Disconnect the propeller shaft from the axle driv-
ing flange.
Remove the ten nuts securing the differential
housing to the axle casing.
Lift out the unit.


Replacement is the reversal of the above schedule.
NOTE; Care must be taken to see that the joint
faces are dean and free from burrs. Coat both
faces with a jointing compound and use a new
joint.
To Dismantle the Differential Unit
Hold the unit securely in a vice, and to avoid
damaging the flanged face, which is the most con-
venient point for holding, use clamps made of lead
or other suitable soft material.
Remove the lock screws from both the differential
adjusting nuts, and unscrew the nuts half a turn.
Remove the two differential bearing caps, which
are held by four bolts two to each cap.
NOTE: These caps are machined with the carrier,
and it is most important that they should be fitted
in their correct positions when reassembling. They
are marked to show correct assembly, and any dif-
ficulty arising from loss or exchange will be avoided
if the caps are replaced and bolted into position
immediately the crown wheel is removed.
Remove the crown wheel assembly from the car-
rier.

flange and withdraw the flange, using an extractor
or press.
Remove the two countersunk headed screws secur-
ing the housing cap to the housing, and withdraw
the housing cap from the shaft.
Press the housing complete with bearing off the
shaft, and press out the bearing from the housing.
Remove the spacer and press the bearing off the
shaft.
To Examine the Parts for Wear
Each part must be in a serviceable condition and
must be examined before assembly. To carry out
this examination correctly, the parts must be per-
fectly clean, and it is important that they should
be kept clean as the assembly proceeds.
1. Crown wheel bearings: These bearings are of
the radial type. They must spin freely without
signs of harshness or excessive play between the
inner and outer races. If there is any doubt about
their condition, they must be replaced,
2. Pinion shaft bearings: The bearing nearest the
pinion gear is a double roller, and that by the driv-
ing flange a double journal thrust ball bearing.
These should be replaced if they do not roll freely
and smoothly.
3. Crown wheel and pinion : These are lapped in
pairs and are marked with corresponding numbers
—the pinion on its end face, and the crown wheel
on its back face.
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE
WHEELS AND PINIONS BE STORED AND
USED IN PAIRS, OTHERWISE SATISFACTORY
RESULTS CANNOT BE OBTAINED.
4. If the inner races of the roller bearings are
loose on the pinion shaft as the result of wear on
the shaft, brought about by the races revolving
independently of the shaft, a new pinion, together
with a crown wheel, must be used. If the original
bearings are loose on the replacement pinion shaft,
new bearings must be fitted.
5. Fractures in the teeth and hollows or rough-
ness on the surfaces of the teeth will render both
the crown wheel and pinion unserviceable. Replace
in pairs.
6. Carrier: The outer races of the roller bearings
must be a light drive fit in the bores machined in
the carrier. Should a new replacement bearing fail
to remove any excessive looseness, a new carrier
must be fitted..
Similarly, when the differential bearing caps are
held tightly by their bolts, the crown wheel bear-
ings must be a light drive fit in the bores machined
for them in the carrier. Any looseness of the bear-
ings should be dealt with as above.
7. Differential Cage: This should be replaced if
wear is excessive in the bores in which the differen-
tial gears revolve, or if, when the halves are bolted
together, the differential pin is not held securely.
8. Differential gears, pinions and spiders: The
function of these parts is such that rather more lati-
tude of wear is permissible than in the case of the
crown wheel and pinion. But if there is any doubt
about the condition of any part it should be re-
placed. After examining all parts and replacing
any that are not serviceable, the axle should be
reassembled as follows:
To Assemble the Crown Wheel Assembly
Place the differential gears in the cage, fit the
pinions on to the spider and place the spider in
one half of the cage. Assemble the other half of
the cage into position numbers correspond fit
the bolts and tighten.
Insert an axle shaft, securely held in a vice, into
one of the differential gears and check that the
pinions and gears will turn freely, by revolving the
complete cage assembly.
Should it not do so, strip the unit and examine
for the cause, such as the incorrect fitting of the
cage halves.
Fig. 2.—Exploded view of crown wheel assembly.


Fig. 3.—Exploded view of pinion assembly.
If correct, turn up the tabs of the lock washers.
Press the bearings on to the spigots of the differ-
ential cage, making sure that the bearings are
fitted correctly against their collars on each side
of the cage.
Note: Each bearing must be fitted Avith the
THRUST facing ontwards.
The crown Avheel must iioav be tested for truth.
Place the two bearings on “vee” blocks and check,
with the aid of a clock gauge, the crown Avheel
for running true laterally and diametrically. The
maximum permissible error is .003. Should the
Avheel fail to run true within this limit, replace
the cage and recheck.
To Assemble the Pinion Assembly
' -3BP
Press the inner race of the bearing on to the
pinion shaft, making sure that the race is right
home against the shoulder of the pinion shaft. Place
the spacer on the shaft.
Assemble to the housing the bearing and the cap,
care being taken to see that the joint is not damaged,
and press the assembly on to the pinion shaft. Press
the flange on to the shaft, fit the nut, tighten and
replace the cotter pin.
To Assemble the CroAvn Wheel Assembly
to the Carrier
Place the croAvn Avheel assembly into position and
replace the bearing caps. Tighten the bolts par-
tially in order to place a small pressure on the
bearings. Assemble the Avashers and the adjusting
nuts and steadily pull the bearings into position,
keeping the nuts an equal distance from the ends
of the differential cage until the outer races of
the bearings are against the shoulders of the
housing.
Replace the adjusting nut lock screAvs Avheu the
gears have been correctly meshed.
Note: These lock screAvs must protrude through
the nuts and engage Avith the holes provided in
the Avashers.
To Assemble the Bevel Pinion Assembly
to the Carrier
Press the outer ring of the bearing into the carrier
and replace the inner circlip.
Tap the pinion assembly into the carrier with a
sufficient number of shims to allow the inner faces
of the teeth of both the pinion and the crownwheel
to be flush.
To Mark and Set the Gears
Cheek the meshing of the teeth by using some
marking compound on the working faces of the
crown wheel teeth.
A mixture of finely powdered lead and engine oil
form a suitable compound. Turn the bevel pinion
gently by hand in a clockwise direction and observe
carefully how the markings show on the face of
Fig. 4.—Sectioned view of the pinion assembly,


the teeth. The various markings that can be obtain-
ed are clearly indicated by the diagrams.
When the meshing of the teeth is correct, the
gears should roll smoothly and silently when
rotated. Approximately .008 backlash must be
maintained after each adjustment.
Important: Cleanliness must be maintained when
assembling or dealing with the rear axle gears,
as the slightest trace of foreign matter, either in the
gears or ball races, will cause rapid wear.
To Remove and Replace the Axle
Most of the necessary repairs can be carried out
with the rear axle in position in the vehicle, but if
its removal from the vehicle is required, proceed
as follows:
Lift the rear of the car with a hoist and remove
the wheels.
Disconnect the propellor shaft from the rear axle
driving flange (it is advisable to mark both the pro-
pellor shaft flange and the driving flange to enable
the shaft to be replaced in its original position).
Release the rubber brake hose from its bracket
on the left side of the chassis.
Remove the Jackall hose from its bracket on the
left side of the chassis.
Remove the two nuts securing the shock absorber
links to the spring plates and release the links.
Fig. s.—Method of adjusting crown wheel and pinion.


Remove the bolts and nuts securing each check
strap to the spring plates.
Disconnect the hand brake cables from their
balance link (inside the vehicle).
Release the cables from their front abutment
brackets. (These are situated on the frame directly
under the hand brake lever). Remove the bolts
securing the centre abutment brackets to the frame.
Place supports undeb the axle. Slacken off the
lock nuts of the spring “IT” bolts, then remove both
lock nuts and attachment nuts together.
Withdraw the “U” bolts from the axle.
Remove the bottom shackle pins from both the
rear spring rear shackles and carefully lower each
spring.
Slide the axle to the rear and remove for further
dismantling.
Replacement is the direct reversal of the above
operations.
Important: The brakes must be bled after reas-
sembly of the axle.

Using an extractor, withdraw the hub complete
with its two bearings and oil seal.
Should the inner bearing remain on the stub
axle, it can be removed with the extractor or by
carefully tapping off with a suitable drift.
Examine the oil seal, and if damaged it should
be renewed. Replace with the plain side facing
the steering knuckle flange and brake back plate.
Replace in the reverse order, after the original
grease has been cleaned out of the hub and repacked
with new lubricant.

Disconnect each hose assembly from its attach-
ment on the chassis by first unscrewing the small
union nut on the copper pipe, and then unscrewing
the large nut retaining the brake hose assembly
junction union to the support bracket.
Detach the steering draglink from the steering
arm by removing the split pin from the ball pin
retaining nut, slackening off the nut (do not remove
it), supporting the draglink with a block of wood
or similar support, and, using a hammer, loosen
the ball pin from its taper seating. The seating nut
can now be removed and the pin withdrawn from
its housing.
Disconnect the shock absorber links by unscrew-
ing the securing nuts from the axle beam.
NOTE: It is not necessary to remove the shock
absorber bodies from the chassis.
Disconnect the Jackall pipe unions from their
securing brackets on the frame.
Fig. 2.—Showing the hub and swivel pin.


Remove the two jacks complete with copper pipes
and flexible connections from the axle by unscrew-
ing the eight bolts and nuts from the securing
brackets (four bolts to each bracket).
Place supports under the axle, slacken off the
locknuts for the spring bolts, then unscrew both
attachment nuts and locknuts together. Withdraw
the bolts from the axle.
Lower the axle gently to the ground and remove
for further dismantling.
To replace the front axle, the procedure for dis-
mantling should be reversed.
IMPORTANT: The brakes and jacks require
bleeding after reassembly and before taking the
vehicle on the road.
To Remove and Replace the
Steering Knuckle Bushes
Remove the swivel pin and steering knuckle.
Drive out the original bushes, using a punch.
Press in the new bushes until the end of each
bush is flush with the faces between which the axle
beam, cushion and leather washers are fitted.
If available, use a hand press to carry out this
operation.
Ream the bushes when in position. (Use a special
reamer).
Swivel pins must be a push fit in their bushes.
To Check and Set the Toe-in
The correct alignment for the front wheels is
toe-in.
Check the tyre pressures.
Fig. 3.—Steering knuckle.


Turn the front wheels to the straight ahead posi-
tion.
Position the trammel pointers to the wheel centre
height.
Place the trammels behind the front wheels and
adjust them longitudinally so that both pointers
register against the outside rim of each wheel,
Mark the position of the pointers on both wheels
with chalk, withdraw the trammel and then push
the car forward half a wheel revolution.
Place the trammel in front of the wheels so that
the pointer registers with the chalk mark on one
of the wheels. For the alignment to be correct, the
other pointer should stand away from the mark on
the other wheel by
Should it not do so, adjust by slackening the pin
bolts of both the track rod ball ends and turning
the track rod in the required direction until the
correct toe in of is obtained. (The track rod is
made with right and left hand threads to enable this
operation to be carried out without the removal of
the ball ends).
IMPORTANT: Uo not omit to retighten the pinch
bolts and so ensure that the top surfaces of the ball
joints are in the same plane. Should they not be
so, cross binding and stiffness will occur on locks.
From car numbers 314/6470 and 318/3828, the
arrangement of the front hubs and swivel pins is as
shown.
NOTE: The hub retaining nuts are as on earlier
cars. Left side, left hand thread and the right side
right hand thread. In addition, there are locking
rings securing the inner ball races which are
threaded left hand and right hand.
IMPORTANT: IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE
LEFT HAND THREADED HUB IS FITTED TO
THE LEFT SIDE.
SWIVEL PINS are parallel and the thrust wash-
ers are fitted on the underside of the axle beam.
TRACK ROD ENDS: The track rod ball pin is
fitted above the steering arms on the later ears.

arm, taking care not to damage the threads on the*
rocker shaft.
Replacement is the reversal of the above.
IMPORTANT; When replacing the drop arm on
the rocker shaft, it is essential that it is fitted to
the correct spline. The end of the rocker shaft and
the face of the drop arm boss are marked for this
purpose.
To Take up Backlash with the
Steering Gear in Position
Turn the steering wheel until the road wheels are
in the straight ahead position.
Disconnect the draglink from the drop arm.
Slacken off the lock nut and screw up the adjust-
ing screw until all play is taken up when the drop
arm is in the central position.
NOTE: This screw must be only finger tight.
Test for slackness by holding the lower end of
the drop arm with the forefinger and the thumb,
while exerting a light pressure alternately in both
directions, as the steering wheel is turned from lock
to lock. It will be noticed that the amount of
slackness is not the same in all positions, there
being less slack in the centre than on the locks. If
slackness appears at ALL positions of the drop
arm, further adjustment must be made. Test again
in the same manner. When the necessary adjust-
ment has been made, a high spot will be noticed as


the steering wheel is moved past the central posi-
tion. At this high spot no backlash can be felt
on the drop arm. When this high spot can be felt,
as a very slight drag on the steering wheel, the
gear is correctly adjusted and the lock nut must be
tightened up.
Replace the drag link on the end of the drop arm.
To Remove and Replace
the Steering Gear
Detach the central control and steering wheel,
also slacken the support bracket clamp bolt.
Disconnect the steering draglink from the drop
arm.
Remove the bolts securing the steering box
bracket cap to the frame bracket. The steering box
unit, with bracket cap, can now be withdrawn
downwards and out between the front axle and the
chassis.
Replacement of the steering gear is the reversal
of the above.
To Dismantle the Steering Gear
Remove the side cover and drain off the oil.
Remove the steering wheel.
Withdraw the bottom end cover.
Extract the inner column by pushing it down-
wards. The ball cup will be forced out of the steer-
ing box, and the inner column with the cam can
be removed complete with one of the ball cups and
one of the ball cages.
Fig. 1.—Showing adjustable steering wheel.
Examine the Parts for Wear
Thoroughly clean the box and look for wear in
the rocker shaft bushes. These bushes can be pressed
out of the box from either end after removing the
cork gland and retaining disc. The latter is held in
position by peening on the edge of the casing. New
bushes can then be pressed in and reamed in line,
the cork gland and retaining disc fitted, and the
end of the steering box tapped over to secure the
disc.
Examine the rocker shaft for wear on the shank.
Renew if it is badly worn. If the splines are
twisted, the rocker shaft should be renewed. At the
end of the rocker shaft arm is a conical roller
mounted on anti-friction bearings. If worn, the
bearing must be replaced by a new unit.
Examine the cam for excessive wear in the
grooves, and also the ball tracks formed at each
end of the cam for any signs of pitting. If the cam
is defective for any of these reasons, the cam and
steering column must be renewed.
Examine the ball cups for pitting in the ball
tracks. Renew if necessary. Replace the ball cages
if they are defective.
To Reassemble the Steering Gear
See that all parts are clean and dry.
Insert the ball cup in the inner end of the steer-
ing box.
Hold the box in the vice so that the cam and the
column can be inserted vertically.
Place the ball cage inside the inner ball cup, and
insert the steering mast and cam into the steering
box and place the other ball cage over the cam.
It is important that the two ball cages are fitted the
correct way round.
Replace the second ball cup, the shims and the
bottom cover. Then fit the four bolts and tighten
them down.
Hold the steering box in the vice so that the
column is horizontal, fit the steering wheel tem-
porarily and test for end float. Remove the shims,
if required, to eliminate end float. After finally
tightening the bolts, the column must be free to
rotate but must have no end float.
Insert the rocker shaft complete with the roller
unit.
Replace the side cover, leaving the adjusting
screw slack.
Fit the drop arm temporarily without the nut
by lightly tapping it on to the tapered splines.
The gear can now be adjusted by the screw and the
lock nut tightened up. Fit the drop arm nut.
Remove the steering wheel and refit the felt
bush into the top of the column. If the shaft is ex-
cessively slack, the felt bush should be renewed.
Fit the steering gear to the chassis.
Refit the steering wheel and central control,
taking .care that the olive is not damaged. Tighten
up the gland nut.
Refill the steering box with oil.


Bishop Cam and Lever,
Model K on the 14/60
To Remove and Replace the Steering Wheel
Remove the central control by removing the wires
from the junction box and loosening the two grub
screws in the hub of the steering wheel. The control
complete with wires and short section of the wire
carrier tube can then be withdrawn.
Release the lock lever from the steering wheel
and press the wheel down to its lowest position,
then spring off the circular clip.
Remove the wheel from its splines by pulling it
upwards.
Replacement is the reversal of the above
procedure.
To Remove and Replace the
Outer Tube Top Bush
This is carried out as detailed under “To Remove
and Replace the Top Bush” in the section dealing
with the 18/85 steering gear.
To Remove and Replace the Drop Arm
Remove the split pin, slotted nut and washer.
To pull the drop arm off the splines use an ex-
tractor. If an extractor is not available, remove the
steering box side cover on the opposite side of the
steering box, and drive the rocker shaft through the
drop arm, taking care not to damage the threads
of the rocker shaft.
Replacement is the reversal of the above
procedure.
IMPORTANT: When replacing the drop arm on
the rocker shaft, it is essential that it is fitted to
the correct spline. The end of the rocker shaft and
the drop arm boss are marked.
To Take up Backlash with the Steering-
Gear in Position
Turn the steering wheel until the road wheels
are in the straight ahead position.
Disconnect the draglink from the drop arm.
Remove the required amount of shims from be-
tween the steering box and the side cover until all
play is taken up when the drop arm is in the central
position.
Test for slackness by holding the lower end of
the drop arm with the forefinger and thumb and
then exerting a light pressure alternately in both
directions, while the steering is turned from lock
to lock. It will be noticed that the amount of slack-
Fig. 2.—Exploded view of steering gearbox.




ness is not the same in all positions, there being
less slackness in the centre than on the locks.
When the necessary adjustment has been made,
a high spot will be noticed when the steering wheel
is moved past the central position, and at this high
spot no backlash can be felt on the drop arm.
When this high spot can be felt as a very slight
drag on the steering wheel, the steering is correctly
adjusted.
The high spot must coincide with the straight
ahead position of the front wheels.
Replace the draglink on the drop arm.
Refill the steering box with oil.
To Remove and Replace the Steering Gear
Detach the central control and wheel, also
slacken the steering column support bracket (inside
the car).
Disconnect the steering draglink from the drop
arm.
Remove the drop arm.
Remove the bolts securing the steering box
bracket cap to the frame bracket. The steering box
unit can now be withdrawn downwards and out
between the front axle and the chassis.
Replacement of the steering gear is the reversal
of the above procedure.
To Dismantle the Steering Gear
Remove the side cover and drain off the oil.
Withdraw the drop arm and rocker shaft.
Remove the steering box bottom end cover.
Extract the inner column by pushing it down-
wards. The ball cup will be forced out of the steer-
ing box, and the inner column with cam can be
removed complete with ball cups and upper ball
cage.
To Examine for Wear
Thoroughly clean the steering box and examine
for wear in the rocker shaft bush. This can be
pressed out of the box after removing the cork
gland and retaining disc, which is held in position
by light peening on the edge of the casing. A new
bush can then be pressed in and reamed in position,
the cork gland and retaining disc fitted, and the
end of the casing tapped over to secure the disc.
Examine the rocker shaft for wear on the shank.
Renew it if it is badly worn. Check the splines.
Should they be twisted, the rocker shaft must be
renewed-
At the end of the rocker arm is a conical peg.
If this is worn it should be tapped out and a new
one flitted.
Examine the cam for excessive wear in the
grooves and also the ball tracks at each end of the
cam for signs of pitting. If the cam is defective
for any of these reasons, the cam and steering
column must be renewed.
Examine the ball cups for pitting in the ball
tracks.
Renew them if necessary. Replace the ball cages
if they are defective.
To Reassemble the Steering Gear
See that all parts are clean and dry.
Insert the ball cup in the inner end of the steer-
ing box.
Hold the steering box in the vice in such a posi-
tion that the cam and column can be inserted
vertically.
Place the ball cage inside the inner ball cup and
insert the steering column and cam into the box
and place the other ball cage on the end of the cam.
It is important that the two ball cages are placed
in the correct way round.
Replace the second ball cap shims and the bottom
cover. Fit the four bolts and tighten them down.
Now hold the steering box in the vice so that
the column is horizontal, fit the steering wheel
temporarily and test for end float. Remove
shims if required, to eliminate end float. After
finally tightening the four bolts, the column must
be free to rotate, but must have no end float.
Insert the rocker shaft complete with its peg.
Replace the shims and the side cover. Fit the four
bolts and tighten them.
Fit the drop arm temporarily without the nut,
by gently tapping it on to the tapered spline and
test for end play.
Remove the shims, if required, to eliminate end
play.
Remove the steering wheel and replace the felt
bush. If the shaft is slack, a new bush should be
fitted.
Fit the steering gear into the chassis.
Refit the steering wheel and central control,
taking care that the olive is not damaged.
Tighten up the gland nut.
Replace the nut securing the drop arm and fit
the cotter pin.

HYDRAULIC DAMPERS
SECTION K
Shock Absorbers
Make .. .. ~ .. .. .. Luvax,
Type .. .. .. .. .. .. Double acting.
Model P 5 (14/60). P 6 (18/85).
To Test the Hydraulic Dampers
If the hydraulic dampers do not appear to func-
tion satisfactorily, an indication of their resistance
can be obtained by carrying out the following
check; ' i
Remove the dampers from the chassis.
Place a damper in a vice (hold it by the fixing
lugs to avoid distortion of the body).
Move the lever arm up and down through its
complete stroke. A moderate resistance throughout
the full stroke should be felt. If the resistance is
erratic, and free movement in the lever arm is
noted, it may indicate lack of fluid.
If the addition of fluid (added as described) gives
no improvement, a new damper should be. fitted.
Too much resistance, i.e., when it is not possible
to move the lever arm slowly by hand, indicates
Fig. 1 .—Assembling bearing to boss end.
a broken internal part or a seized piston. In such
cases the damper should be changed.
To Top up with Fluid
Before removing the filler plug (located on the
top of the damper), carefully clean the exterior of
the damper. This is most important, as it is vital
that dirt or foreign matter should not enter the
operating chamber.
Use only thin piston type fluid.
While adding fluid the lever arm must be worked
throughout its full stroke to expel any air that
might be present in the operating chamber.
Fluid Level
Fluid should be added to the bottom of the filler
orifice.
Fig. 2. —Method of fitting tube.


To Replace the Damper
When handling dampers that have been removed
from the chassis, it is important to keep the
assemblies upright as far as possible, otherwise air
may enter the operating chamber, resulting in free
movement.
NOTE: Before fitting the link to its attachment
to the axle it is advisable to work the lever arm
a few times up and down through its full stroke.
4 • * .
To Replace the Bearings
Tight rubber bearings are used between the lever
arm and connecting link, and the link and axle.
Special tools, are necessary for fitting bearings,
A hand press or equivalent apparatus such as a
drilling machine should be available.
Before dismantling the link from the lever arm,
and the eyebolt (in the case of the front dampers)
from the link, it is necessary to note the method
of assembly, otherwise the links may be incorrectly
assembled and it will not be possible to refit the
dampers to the chassis. In the case of the front
linkage, one end of the IJ-shaped link is fitted IN-
SIDE the lever arm and the other to an eyebolt.
With the rear dampers, the cranked end of the L-
shaped link is fitted from the outside of the lever
arm, with the assembled pin at the other end of
the link, facing towards the damper movement.
Fig. 3.—Method of fitting pin.
Fig. 4.—Method of fitting the connecting link.
To Dismantle the Linkage
Disconnect the link from the lever arm by pres-
sing out the end of the link from the rubber bearing
of the arm.
With the front damper, press out the end of the
link from the eyebolt.
Press out the rubber bearings of the lever arm
and eyebolt.
To Fit New Bearings to the Lever Arm,
Link and Eyebolt
Clean all the housings for the rubber bushes to
remove any dirt or grease.
Rest the end of the lever arm on the base block,
place the guide funnel in position on the lever arm
link or eyebolt, damp the outside of the rubber
bearing in benzine (if this is not available, petrol
or kerosene may be used) and insert the bush in the
open end of the guide funnel.
With a quick action, force the bearings through
the tapered bore of the guide into position in the
boss end, using the pinch or pressure tool.
To Assemble the Connecting Link to the
Lever Arm and Eyebolt
Place the boss end of the lever arm, or eyebolt,
with the assembled rubber in position, on the base
block.
Smear the bore of the rubber with petroleum
jelly.
Fit the guide pin to the connecting link and insert
the assembly guide first into the rubber. Then with
a quick action force the guide tool, together with
the pin, into the bearing.
Remove the guide through the base tool.
To fit the pin to the connecting link (rear) and
to the eyebolt (front) the method is as described
for assembling the link to the lever arm.


JACKALL SYSTEM
SECTION L
To Operate the Jacks
The indicator dial should be turned until the
appropriate lettering, i.e., “Front”, “All”, or “Rear”
is opposite the pointer. In selecting “front” or
“rear” the dial should be turned as far as it will
go without using undue force.
Screw down the release valve and then place the
handle over the lever at the side of the pump and
work it to and fro. As the pump has a ported inlet,
the handle mnst be moved the full extent in both
direction to charge the cylinders with oil. To lower
the ear, the release valve should first be opened
very slightly to control the drop of the car to the
ground, after which it should be opened two or
three complete turns and left open until the next
jacking operation.
How the Distributor Box Operates
When in operation, the fluid passes from the tank
into the pump body through the filter (A), which
is mounted in the cover. By reciprocating the lever
(E) its full stroke in both directions, fluid is drawn in
Fig. 1. —Jackall distributor box.


through the ports (D) and forced along the pas-
sages (P), into the valve chambers (Gr) and (H) via
duplicated non-return ball valves (I) and (K).
These valves have been duplicated to avoid any
possibility of dirt rendering the pump inoperative.
The top ball in each valve chamber is kept on its
seat by a washer (L), which is lightly spring
loaded by the spring (M).
The valve chambers are interconnected by means
of cross holes (N) into the release chamber (0).
By this means the fluid delivered into either valve
chamber can pass via the cross holes and release
chamber into the opposite valve chamber when one
or the other of the selector valves and the release
valves are closed. Each valve chamber is sealed at
its top end by a gland (P) through which passes
the selector valve (Q). Each selector valve is de-
pressed on to its seat as the indicator dial is rotated
to the “front” or “rear” positions, the fluid then
being fed through the other selector valve port
to the rear or front jacks. The cam surfaces on the
underside of the indicator dial depress the appro-
priate valve through the medium of the rocking
plate (R), which by a fulcrum action uses the fluid
load in that side of the system which is being
operated to further depress the selector valve on to
its seat and thus cut off the operated side.
From the valve chambers the fluid thus passes
through whichever selector valve is open, through
the filter (U) and into the delivery line of the jacks.
When the jacks are fully extended, excess pres-
sure developed in the pump passes through the
holes (V) which are connected with the passages
(F) and escapes into the pump body through the
spring loaded relief valve (W). No adjustment is
required to these springs, as when the return valve
(X) is screwed firmly home, the spring resistance
obtained gives the correct pressure.
When the release valve is opened to lower the
car, the fluid from the jacks again passes through
the filter (U) (thus trapping any dirt from the
jacks) into the valve chamber and via the release
chamber through the return flow valve (X) into
the pump body and then back to the tank.
Fig. 2.—The jack.
Fig. 3. — Position of rear hose bracket on rear axle.


The return flow valve (X) is fitted with a rubber
sleeve around its reduced diameter which covers
the outlet hole and thus prevents the head of the
fluid in the tank standing on the jacks.
To Service the Jackall Distributor Box
When it is necessary to drain the fluid from the
system for the purpose of repairs, dose the release
valve, set the indicator to “all”, disconnect one of
the delivery pipes—either at the bottom of the dis-
tributor or one of the jacks—and pump the fluid
into a suitable receptacle. The fluid should be care-
fully filtered when refilling the system.
After the system has been refilled, the pump
should be cleared of air by opening the “bleed”
screw (B) two turns and then pumping. When the
fluid flows freely from the vent hole (C) the screw
must be tightened down firmly.
Whilst filters have been incorporated, both
on the inlets and outlets of the pump, every care
should be taken to prevent dirt getting into the
system, either through the tank or dirty connections.
During repairs the end of the pipes should be
plugged to keep out the dirt. The pump may be
cleaned out, if necessary, with thinners, and the
parts smeared with Red Jackall Fluid on
reassembly.
How the Jack Works
The pressure fluid from the pump is introduced
through the elbow fitting (A) and causes an ex-
tension of the inner tube (B) from the outer tube
(C) ; the fluid being sealed inside the jack by the
gland (D) which is carried inside the housing (E).
The copper washers (F), (G) and' (H) are also
high pressure seals. The inner tube with its foot (J)
is retrreted by the coil spring (K) when the release
valve 'n the pump is opened.

If no defects are apparent on the valve seats, and
there is no external leak, the casting is faulty and
should be replaced.
Unscrew threaded sleeve nut and inspect conical
faces of nipple. Replace this if necessary. When
re-making joint with a new nipple, see that pipe
is as far into the receiving hole as possible.
This ensures that, when tightened up, the nipple is
not peened over the end of the pipe.
In order to fill the cylinders it is essential that a full
stroke be given to the pump in each direction.
This is sometimes prevented by an adjustable
seat or other obstruction, which fouls the handle.

NOTE: —In resetting the indicator dial, make sure,
by adjusting the lock nuts “Y”, that in selecting
“front” or “rear” there is enough angular move-
ment on the dial to bring the centre of the words
“front” and “all” opposite the pointer.
Tighten screws.
Do not disturb the cover unless absolutely neces-
sary. If it is removed, a new washer must be used
and all faces thoroughly cleaned. Soak the washer
in Red Jackall fluid before reassembling.
Dismantle jacks, prise out the gland from its hous-
ing with a blunt tool. Examine the recess in
which the gland sits for dents, distortion and
foreign matter.
Change gland and/or gland housing if faulty in
any way, and in replacing the gland, make sure
the lips are not damaged.
If tightening up will not cure the leak, dismantle
and re-make the joints with new copper washers.
Grip the jack in a vice, using shaped hardwood or
copper-faced clamps. Unscrew the elbow and the
gland housing, when the ram can be withdrawn
and checked. Use new copper washers when
reassembling.

The Master Cylinder
The master cylinder is mounted on the right side
of the chassis, next to the brake pedal. It is of the
integral type, i.e., the cylinder and the supply tank
are made as a combined casting.
Figure 1 clearly indicates the construction.
In the head of the master cylinder is a combina-
tion inlet and outlet check valve (L), The function
of this valve is to cut off the return to the master
cylinder of the fluid pumped into the pipe line
during the bleeding operation, thus ensuring that
the fluid is delivered into the pipe line at each
stroke of the pedal, and a -complete purge of air
from the system. Directly in front of the main cup
(H), when the system is at rest, is a by-pass port
(N). This ensures the system being maintained full
of fluid at all times, and allows full compensation
for expansion and contraction of the fluid due to
temperature changes. It also serves to release ad-
ditional fluid drawn into the cylinder from the
annular space, formed by the reduced skirt in the
piston, via the small holes in the piston head, as
a result of the vacuum created by the rapid return
of the master cylinder piston after each brake
application.
Brakes will drag or bind if the by-pass port is
covered by the rubber cup, due to an incorrect
adjustment of the push rod, which is attached to the
brake pedal.
To Adjust the Brake Pedal
The correct amount of free movement between
the push rod (A) and the piston (E) is set during
the erection of the vehicle and should not be
altered. In the event of the adjustment having been
disturbed, adjust the length of rod connecting the
cylinder to the pedal until the pedal pad can be de-
pressed approximately \ inch before the piston com-
mences to move. The clearance can be felt if the
pedal is depressed by hand. A mat or floorboard
fouling the pedal, and so preventing the complete
return to the “off” position, may take up the free
movement when the adjustment is correct.
To Remove the Master Cylinder
Uncouple the pipes from the master cylinder.
Remove the cotter and pin securing the push rod
to the brake pedal.
Detach the cylinder from its mounting by re-
moving the four securing bolts, nuts and spring
washers.
Withdraw the unit and drain the master cylinder
supply tank by removing the filler plug.
To Dismantle the Master Cylinder (See Figure 1)
Remove the push rod (A) complete with the
rubber boot (B).
Push the piston (F) down the cylinder bore,
remove the circlip (C). The remaining internal
parts (D) to (L) can then be withdrawn.


Fig. 1.—Sectional view of master cylinder.
To remove the secondary cup (H) from the
piston, carefully stretch it over the end flange
using the fingers only.
To Assemble the Master Cylinder (See Figure 1)
Clean all parts thoroughly, using Lockheed
Hydraulic brake fluid for all rubbers. All traces
of petrol, kerosene or trichlorethylene used for
cleaning the metal parts must be removed before
assembly.
Examine all the rubber parts for damage or
distortion. Usually it is advisable to renew the
rubbers when rebuilding the cylinder.
Dip all the internal parts in brake fluid and
assemble them wet.
Stretch the secondary cup (E) over the end
f ange of the piston (F) with the lip of the cup
pointing towards the opposite end of the piston.
When the cup is in its groove, work it round gently
with the fingers to make sure it is correctly seated.
Fit the check valve (L) in one end of the return
spring (K) and retainer (J) in the opposite end,
and insert it valve first into the cylinder.
Insert the main cup (H), lip first, taking care
not to damage or turn back the lip, and press it
down on to the spring retainer.
Insert the brass disc (G) and follow with the
piston (F), taking care not to damage or turn back
the lip of the secondary cup (E).
Push the piston down the bore slightly, insert
the piston stop (D) and fix the circlip (C)’ in the
groove in the cylinder.
Test the master cylinder by filling the tank
and by pushing the piston down the bore and allow-
ing it to return; after one or two applications fluid
should flow from the outlet.
To Replace the Master Cylinder
Insert the push rod (A) and refit the boot (B).
Check the boot carefully, and replace it if it is
damaged or distorted.
Replace the master cylinder on its mounting
bracket on the frame, refit the four securing bolts
spring washers and nuts.
Replace the pin securing the push rod to the
pedal and fit the cotter pin.
Check the adjustment of the push rod.
Connect the fluid pipes and bleed the system.
Check the system for leaks with the brakes fullv
applied.


Fig. 2. —Sectional view of wheel cylinder.
Front and Rear Wheel Cylinders (See Figure 2)
The front and rear wheel cylinders are mounted
rigidly to the brake shoe plate inside the brake
drum, between the brake shoe tips.
The opposed pistons act directly on to the tips of
the brake shoes. Each piston (B) is backed by a
rubber cup (C) within which is a crown spring
expander (E). These are held in position by the
coil spring (D) which also keeps the rubber cups
(C) in contact with the piston head. The ends of
the cylinder are sealed by a rubber boot (F) against
the entry of dust, mud and water which may find
its way into the brake drum. At the topmost posi-
tion the bleeder screw (G) is located through
which the air is expelled during the bleeding
operation.
To Remove the Wheel Cylinder
Jack up the vehicle and remove the wheel and
brake drum.
Remove the flexible hoses by withdrawing the
banjo bolt from the inlet fitting.
Unlock the brake shoe pull off spring and turn
the brake shoe adjusting nuts until the brake shoes
are fully extended.
Remove the two set screws securing the cylinders
to the brake plate, and withdraw the cylinder.
To Dismantle the Wheel Cylinder
Remove the rubber boots.
Withdraw the internal pa-rts, piston, rubber cups,
spring, complete with crown springs.
To Assemble the Wheel Cylinder
Clean all parts thoroughly, using Lockheed
Hydraulic brake fluid for the rubber parts. All
traces of petrol, kerosene or trichlorethylene used
for cleaning the metal parts, must be removed
before assembly.
Examine the rubber cups for damage or
distortion.
Dip all parts in brake fluid and ASSEMBLE
WET.
Insert one piston (B), flat face first.
Insert one rubber cup (C), flat face first, from the
opposite end of the cylinder.
a
Insert the spring (D) complete with crown spring
expander (E),
Insert the second cup, lip first, taking care not
to damage or turn back the lip of the cup.
lusert the second piston, flat face first, and press
it down on to the rubber cup.
Fit the rubber boot into the grooves on the end
of each piston, and then over the end of the
cylinder.
To Replace the Wheel Cylinder
The wheel, brake drum and brake shoe pull-off
spring must be removed when fitting the cylinder.
With the brake shoes fully extended, fit the wheel
cylinder between the shoe tips and secure it with
two set screws from the outside of the brake plate.
Turn the brake shoe adjuster to the fully “off”
position.
Fit the banjo bolt connecting the hose attachment
to the cylinder, using new copper washers to ensure
a pressure-tight joint.
Fit the brake drum, and bleed the system.
Adjust the brake shoes.
Check the system for leaks with the brakes fully
applied.
Refit tbe wheel.
Fig. 3. —Here are shown the two shoe adjusting nuts to be
found on each brake plate. The small arrows indicate the
direction in which they should be turned to bring the shoes
closer to the drums.
To Adjust the Foot Brake
When lining wear has reached a point where the
pedal travels to within 1 inch of the floorboards
before the brakes come into action, it is necessary
to adjust the brakes. Proceed as follow^;
Jack up the car until the wheels are clear of the
ground. When adjusting the rear wheel brakes,
the hand brake should be in the “off” position.
Adjust each shoe separately by means of the ad-
juster bolts. Rotate the adjuster in the direction
indicated by the arrow (only a part turn) until the
brake shoe prevents the wheel from turning.


Turn the adjuster back the slightest possible
amount until the wheel revolves freely again.
Repeat the above operation on all four wheels.
Brake Assembly
The brake shoes are mounted on a single anchor
pm and each is held against the steady pad on the
back plate by a spring-loaded steady pin, which
passes through the brake shoe web. The trailing or
real shoe in each brake is of the normal fixed type
pivoted at the anchor end, while the front shoe is
of the hooded slot type.
Within the slot is an abutment washer which
locates on the anchor pin, but allows the shoes to
rise and fall, and gives a certain amount of servo
action when the brake is applied. Incorporated in
the rear wheel brakes are the hand brake levers,
which are mechanically operated.
The lever to which tbe cable is attached is pivoted
at the tip of the trailing shoe, and hangs down
behind it. A little below the pivot point and loosely
riveted to the lever, is a cross strut which bears
against the leading sho-e. On applying a pull to the
lever, the cross strut forces the 'leading shoe into
contact with the brake drum. At this point the
pivot pin between the lever and the cross strut
becomes the fulcrum and causes the lever to force-
the trailing shoe into contact with the brake drum.
To Bleed the Line
Bleeding the system is not a routine maintenance
job and should only be necessary when some portion
of the hydraulic equipment has been disconnected
or the fluid drained off.
b ill the supply tank with Lockheed Hydraulic
brake fluid and keep it at least half-full throughout
th operation, otherwise the air will be drawn in,
necessitating a fresh start.
Attach the bleeder tube to the brake cylinder
bleeder screw and allow the free end to be sub-
merged in a small quantity of fluid in a clean glass
jar.
Open the bleeder screw one full turn.
Depress the brake pedal quickly and allow it to
return without assistance, repeat this pumping
action with a slight pause before each depression
of the pedal.
Watch the flow of fluid into the glass jar, and
when all the air bubbles cease to appear, hold the
pedal firmly against the floorboards whilst the
bleeder screw is securely tightened.
Repeat on all wheel cylinders.
NOTE; Clean fluid bled from the system should
be allowed to stand until it is clear of air bubbles,
before using it again. Dirty fluid should be
discarded.
To Remove and Replace the Brake Shoes
Remove the wheel and brake drum.
Unhook the brake shoe pull off spring from the
brake shoes, and in the case of the rear shoes, re-
mo\ e the split pin and nut attaching the rear shoe
to the fulcrum pin of the operating lever of the
hand brake mechanism.
Remove the circlip and spring from the brake
shea steady pin.
Withdraw the circlip from its groove in the shoe
anchor pin. This will enable the flat washers to be
withdrawn, together with the spring washer which
is located between them.
The shoes are now free and can be pivoted clear
of the hand brake operating mechanism (in the
case of the rear brakes) and withdrawn from the
anchor pin.
When refitting the shoes, the reverse sequence
of operations is employed, and care must be taken
to seo that the washers are in the dorrect position on
the anchor pin before the circlips are replaced. Do
not forget to replace the castellated nut and split
pin on the fulcrum pin of the hand brake operating
mechanism in the case of the rear brakes.
To Refine the Brake Shoes
Owing to the need for brake linings to be finished
perfectly concentric with the brake drums, in order
to obtain the best results, relining of the brake shoes
is not satisfactory without special equipment, and
should not be carried out except in an emergency.
Where brake linings become worn, new shoes,
complete with linings fitted by the makers, should
be employed.
If replacement of the brake shoes and lining is
necessary on account of excessive wear or other
cause, it is most important that the material used
for the lining is as specified by the manufacturers.
Fig. 4.—Rear brake assembly.
WOLSELEY 14/60 AND 18/85


Fig. 5. —Front brake assembly.
Any variations from this will give an unequal
braking performance.
When new shoes and linings are fitted it must be
appreciated that considerable adjustment has to be
made to both hand and foot brake mechanism, and
it will become necessary to return both hand and
foot adjusters to their normal position before
attempting to refit the brake drums over new lin-
ings.
When new brake linings are fitted, they should
have the following dimensions:
Length .... 11^
Width .... If
Thickness ..
Rivet 9/64 x hollow countersunk
head (brass).
To Adjust the Hand Brake
Should the hand brake lack power, or the lever
show signs of reaching the end of its travel on the
ratchet before the brake shoes come into operation,
readjustment is necessary. Proceed as follows: —
Jack up the rear axle until both wheels are clear
of the ground. The hydraulic jacks should be used
for this purpose.
Set the hand brake lever to the “off” position and
see that the two wheels rotate quite freely.
NOTE: A slight resistance will be felt from the
differential mechanism when turning the wheel by
hand.
Apply the hand brake until the pawl engages
with the fifth notch on the ratchet, and adjust until
it is possible to rotate the wheel by hand under
heavy pressure. Both wheels must offer equal re-
sistance to get the full power of the brake.
Return the lever to the “off” position and check
that both wheels are perfectly free. If they are not,
remove the brake drums of the brake that tends to
bind and check that the shoes move freely on their
fulcrum and guide pins. Remove any stiffness pre-
sent, readjust and check.
Braking irregularities and their causes.
Note: —ln cases where brakes are not function-
ing correctly, the foliowing information is given
which should enable the cause of the trouble to be
diagnosed and remedied.
1. Should the pedal reach the end of its travel, or
should two strokes of the pedal be required to oper-
ate the brake, the following are the most likely
causes and they should be checked over in the order
stated: —
(a) If the pedal reaches, or nearly reaches, the end
of its travel before braking is evident, it is a
sure sign that the brakeshoes require adjust-
ing. This adjustment should be made in
accordance with the instructions given.
(b) Should the brake pedal give a spongy or
springy feeling, it may be taken as a sign that
air is present in the system. If this is the case
the system should be bled as detailed.
(c) Should the pedal go down to the stop and by
pumping it is found that the pressure cannot
be created, it is an indication that either there
is no fluid in the supply tank or that there is a
leak at some point on the pipe line. To cheek
this it will mean •examining all joints for sign
of leakage.
If a leakage is located, it should be rectified,
the system filled with Lockheed Hydraulic
Brake Fluid, and the system bled.
(d) Under sustained pressure, should the pedal
move slowly towards the end of its travel, it is
an indication of a leak in the system, either at
one of the cylinders, or in the pipe lines. To
check this, maintain pressure on the pedal while
the leak is traced by examination of the pipe
lines and the cylinders.
2. Should the brakes appear sluggish iu coming
“on” and in addition have a tendency to stop “on”
and not come “off” promptly, the following are the
most likely causes, and each should be checked
ever in rotation until the cause is found.
(a) Unsuitable fluid in the system such as min-
eral oil causing sluggish operation.
Only Lockheed hydraulic brake fluid should
be used. ((A sure indication of incorrect fluid
being used is that rubber cups and valve rub-
bers iu the system are swollen and sticky, and
in this case all the cups and valve rubbers of
the whole system must be replaced after thor-
oughly flushing out the system with the correct
fluid).
(b) Brake-shoe adjusting cams should be v checked
to see that the shores arc just free of the brake-
drum when the wheel is jacked up and rotated.
(c) It may be found that the hand brake is adjusted
too closely, causing the cam to expand the
sho>es on to the drum. In this case the hand
brake cables should be slackened off when the
car is fully laden, to give the clearance for the
brake-shoes.


(d) Pull-off spring weak, thereby not pulling the
shoes off when the pressure is released. As a
check on this, the drum should be removed and
a screwdriver inserted between the hub and
hub a i ld I th6 u llO6 levered awa 7 from the
üb. The brake-shoe return spring should re-
V f S^ e U P a^ain st its stop on
removal of the screwdriver. If the spring tends
to give a sluggish return of the shoe, this should
oe renewed.
(e) Seized or tight shoes on anchor pins preventing
reiease when pressure is “off”. This can be
checked in the same way as above, by levering
the shoe away from the hub. If the shoes are
seized or tight, they will not return promptly
and the shoes should be removed from the
anchor pins, the bushings of the shoes cleaned
the anchor pins cleaned and the shoes refitted
with a lubricant on the pins.
(t) Pi f l e !, peda i , pla y should b e about halt an
inch at the pedal Up. This is to allow the pis-
ton in the master cylinder to go right back
into the off” position and so release 'excess
fluid pumped into the system when the brake
in the “Iff” If *v re no .f. ree P« dal p!ay when
, ! it will prevent the release
ot the fluid, thereby keeping the brake-shoes
on. An incorrect adjustment of the pedal link
gear may be the cause.
3. Should one wheel drag or the car pull to one
shoulPbe^checkedPver C ;—° n ' **“ fol ‘°™ g poi " ts
(a) nndt No a 2(dt° e retU ™ Bprin *- gee remed y
(b) Hand brake Lever operating mechanically—see
remedy under No. 2 (e). *
(c) lz ed ( Or tight brake-shoes—see remedy under
(d) Brake-sho-es not in correct adjustment see
remedy under No. 2 (b).
(e) Wheel cylinder cups distorted. Should an un-
authorised fluid have been in contact with the
rubber parts of the system, the cups would
swell and distort, and the return action of the
wheel cylinder cups will be retarded, so caus-
mg the shoes to stay “On” and produce drag.
t this is the case the system should be thor-
oughly flushed out with Lockheed hydraulic
brake fluid and all rubber parts renewed. When
cleaning, use only brake fluid for rubber parts.
All traces of petrol, etc., used for cleaning parts
must be removed before assembly.
(f) Oil or grease in contact with brake-sho-e lining
This will reduce the coefficient of friction of
the lining and cause unequal braking or pulling
to one side on applying the brakes. If the lin-
ings are found in this condition, they should
be cleaned thoroughly with methylated spirits
or petrol and slightly roughed up. Should, how-
ever, the linings be badly soaked in grease, it is
useless to try and clean this off, and the shoes
must be relmed.
(g ) J^ 068 with different grades or makes of
nnng fitted to each shoe would also give un-
equal braking or a tendency for the car to pull
to one side when the brakes are applied Lin
must be fltS fied manufact "«s only
(h) Distorted brake-drums,
4. On inspection, should the level of the fluid in
the master cylinder be found to have dropped con-
siderably, tins will indicate that there is a leak at
some Point in the system, which should be traced
and rectified. Should the loss of fluid be small, this
may be due to a very slight evaporation, and the
suppiy should be brought up to its correct level
with the recommended fluid.
IMPORTANT.
1)0 NOT use any substitute for Lockheed hydraulic
brake fluid, as a substitute will seriously affect
the working of the system.
DO NOT allow grease, paint, oil or brake fluid to
come in contact with the brake linings.
DO NOT clean the rubber parts with a fluid that is
not Lockheed hydraulic brake fluid All traces
of petrol, kerosene, etc., used for cleaning metal
parts must be removed before assembly
DO NOT reline brake-shoes with liners different
from those recommended as this will give
unequal braking. s
DO NOT make tubing joints with packing com-
pounds, clean metal-to-metal joints only should
be made. J u
DO NOT allow the fluid in the master cylinder and
supply tank to fall below half full.

Cable Terminals
Cable terminals should be kept free from cor-
rosion and bolted tightly on the terminal posts and
coated with vaseline, not grease. If corrosion has
taken place, disconnect the terminal from the bat-
ery, and Wlp ® p clean with a rag moistened with
weak ammonia or bicarbonate of soda solution
When removing the cable, do not use undue force

THE BA?TERY TY THE ELEC ™OLYTE FROM
Charging from an External Source
Before starting the charge, the battery should be
opped up with d,st.lied water to * inch above the
top of the separators. ine
The charge should be at the rate of 5 amps and
continued until the specific gravity of the electro
lyte in each cell shows no further rise during four
hours continuous charging, and all cells gas freely
It the specific gravity of the electrolyte in anv cefi
or cells fails to rise whilst on charge and gTssinj
does not take place, the cells should be tested fo?
internal short circuiting. or
The maximum permissible temperature of electro
lyte during external charging is 120°P., and if this
is reached, the charge should be suspended to allow
the temperature to fall. If charging from an ex
nal source has to be carried out at temperatures
WOL S E LEY 14/60 AND 18/85


above 100°F., this should be done at half the re-
charge rates given, to avoid exceeding the maximum
permissible electrolyte temperature of 120°F. If at
the end of the charge, the specific gravity varies by
more than .005 from the figures shown in Table
“A”, the specific gravity must be adjusted. It can
be raised by tbe addition of electrolyte, the specific
gravity of which at 60°F. would be 1.350, or lowered
by the addition of distilled water. When adjusting
the density care must be taken not to leave too
much electrolyte in the cells; any surplus over \
inch above the top tbe separators must be re-
moved.
To Test a Suspected Cell
To test a cell suspected of being short circuited,
take the individual voltage of each cell of the bat-
tery while it is on charge, and also while it is not
on charge. If possible, also arrange to discharge
tbe battery.
If the battery is fitted in the car, the discharge
can be effected by operating the starter motor, with
the engine switched off.
In any case, the voltage of the bad cell will be
much less than that of others. If it is confirmed that
the cell or cells are shorted internally, the battery
must be replaced.
Limit of Discharge
The state of charge of the battery must not be
allowed to fall below the condition indicated by the
following specific gravities:
1.200 specific gravity at O°F.
1.245 specific gravity at 21 °F.
1.265 specific gravity at 30°F.
Otherwise the electrolyte may freeze and the bat-
tery be damaged through cracking of the cell con-
tainers. Never allow a battery to stand in a dis-
charged condition.
THE DYNAMO
Type
The dynamo is a Lucas Model C45PY.3, Type Ll-1,
Service number 238186. These identification marks
are stamped on the yoke. When ordering replace-
ments always quote these numbers.
To Test the Dynamo on the Vehicle
Check the dynamo driving belt for correct adjust-
ment.
There should not be more than \ inch slack when
tested with the fingers at the centre of the belt run.
Check that the dynamo and control box are con-
nected correctly. The dynamo terminals are acces-
sible after the removal of the moulded terminal
cover (N), shown in Fig. 2, which is secured to
the terminal block by a hexagon-headed screw. The
dynamo terminal (D) should be connected to the
control box terminal (+D) and the dynamo ter-
minal (F) connected to the control box terminal
(F).
After switching off all lights and accessories, dis-
connect the cables from the terminals (D) and (F)
of the dynamo.
Connect the two terminals with a short length of
wire.

sides by lightly polishing them with a smooth file.
Replace the brushes in their original positions.

the commutator is unnecessary.
To Remove and Replace
The Dynamo Commutator
A commutator in good condition will be smooth
and free from pits or burnt spots. Clean the com-
mntator with a petrol-moistened cloth. If this is
ineffective, carefully polish with a strip of fine £?iass
paper while rotating the armature. To remedy a
badly worn commutator, mount the armature with
or without the drive end bracket, in a lathe. Rotate
it at high speed and take a very light cut with a

WOLSELEY 14/60 AND 18/85


Failure of the bulb to light indicates an open
circuit in the field coil windings, while if the bulb
lights with full brilliance, the field coils are pro-
bably either shorted or earthed to the pole shoes or
dynamo yoke. In either case the complete dynamo
assembly should be replaced by a new unit. If, how-
ever, a pole expander and wheel operated screw-
driver are available, it is possible to replace the
field coils. A pole shoe expander is necessary in
order to ensure that there will not be any air gap
between the pole shoes and the inner face of the
yoke.
Replace the field coils as follows:
Remove the insulation piece which is provided
to prevent the junction of the field coils from touch-
ing the yoke.
Mark the yoke and the pole shoes in order that
they can be fitted in their original positions.
Unscrew the two pole shoe retaining screws by
means of the wheel-operated screwdriver.
Draw the pole shoes and coils out of the dynamo
yoke and lift off the coils.
Fit the new coils over the pole shoes and place
them in position inside the yoke. Take care to
ensure that the tapping of the field coils is not
tapped between the pole shoes and the yoke.
Locate the pole shoes and the field coils by lightly
tightening the fixing screws.
Insert the pole shoe expander, open it to the fullest
extent and tighten the screw.
Finally tighten the screws by means of the wheel
operated screwdriver, and lock them by caulking.
Replace the insulation piece between the field coil
connections and the yoke.
To Remove and Replace
the Dynamo Bearings
Bearings which are worn to such an extent that
they will allow approximately .015 total side move-
ment of the armature shaft, must be replaced.
To replace the bearing bush at the commutator
end, proceed as follows:
Press the bearing bush out of the commutator
end bracket.
Press the new bearing bush into the end bracket,
Fig. 4.—To fit the pole shoes correctly an expander of the type
illustrated is necessary.
using a shouldered mandrel of the same diameter
as the shaft which is' to fit in the bearing.
NOTE: Before fitting the new bearing bush it
should be allowed to stand 24 hours immersed for
approximately | of its length in thin engine oil.
This will allow the pores of the bush to be filled with
lubricant.
The ball bearing at the driving end is replaced
as follows:
Knock out the four rivets which secure the bear-
ing retainer plate to the end bracket, and remove
- the plate.
Press the bearing out of the end bracket and
remove the corrugated washer and the felt washer.
Before fitting the replacement bearing, see that it
is clean and pack it with a high melting point
grease.
Place the felt washer and corrugated washer in
the bearing housing in the end bracket.
Locate the bearing in the housing and press it
home by means of a hand press, using a tool locat-
ing on the outer journal.
Fit the bearing retaining plate. Insert the four
new rivets from the inside of the end bracket and
open the rivets by means of a punch to secure the
plate rigidly in position.
To Reassemble the Dynamo
In the main the reassembly of the dynamo is a
reversal of the operations for dismantling, bearing
in mind the following points:
The field coil lead coloured green and provided
with the eyebolt must be connected to the terminal
on the brush box, which is in metallic contact with
the end bracket.
The second field coil lead must be connected to
the terminal (F) on the end bracket. The short
length of cable from the insulated brush box must
Fig. 5.—The use of a wheel-operated screwdriver is necessary
to remove and replace the pole shoe attachment screws.


be connected to the terminal (D) on the commutator
end bracket. The connections must be made by
soldering, using a non-corrosive (resin) flux.
Unscrew the lubricator from the commutator end
bracket, lift out the felt wick and spring and refill
the cap with mineral jelly. Replace the wick and
spring and screw the lubricator in position in the
end bracket.
THE REGULATOR .
To Adjust the Regulator.
1. Withdraw the cables from the terminals
marked “A” and Al” in the control unit and join
them together.
2. Connect the positive lead of the voltmeter to
the “D” terminal on the dynamo and connect the
other lead from the voltmeter to the dynamo and
bracket or some other convenient chassis earth.
3. Slowly increase the speed of the engine until
the voltmeter needle “flicks” and then steadies;
this should occur at a voltmeter reading between
the limits given below for the particular tempera-
ture of the regulator.
Temperature Regulator setting.
10 deg. C. 16.9 to 17.3 volts.
20 deg. C. 16.6 to 17.0 volts.
30 deg. C. 16.4 to 16.8 volts.
40 deg. C. 16.1 to 16.5 volts.
If the voltage at which the reading becomes steady
is outside these limits, the regulator must be
adjusted. Switch off the engine, release the lock
nut holding the adjusting screw, and turn the screw
in a clockwise direction to raise the setting, or in
an anti-clockwise direction to lower the setting.
Turn the adjustment screw a fraction of a turn
and then tighten the lock nut.
h ell adjusting do not run the engine up to more
than half throttle, as while the dynamo is an open
circuit, it will build up to a high voltage if run at
a high speed, and so a false voltmeter reading would
be given.
Fig. 6. —Control box, showing air gap settings.
To Clean the Regulator Contacts.
After long periods of service it may be found
necessary to clean the vibrating contacts of the
regulator. These are accessible if the top screw
securing the fixed contact is turned back and the
bottom screw slackened to permit the fixed contact
to be swung outwards. The contacts can be polished
with a fine emery cloth.
Mechanical Setting of the Regulator.
The moving contact of the regulator is accurately
set and should not be removed. If, however, it does
become necessary to reset the contacts, proceed as
follows
1. Insert a .018 feeler gauge between the back of
the fixed contact and the regulator frame.
2. Insert a .020 to .028 feeler gauge between the
top of the bobbin core and the underside of the
movable armature (not under the stop rivet).
3. Press the armature back against the yoke and
down on to the top of the bobbin core with the
feelers in position, and lock the armature in position
by tightening the two fixing screws.
4. Adjust the gap between the regulator contacts
when the armature is pressed down on the bobbin
to between .006 and .017. This is done by inserting
or removing shims at the back of the fixed contact.
5. Finally check and, if necessary, reset the elec-
trical adjustment of the regulators.
To Clean and Set the
Cut-out Contacts.
If, after setting the open circuit voltage of the
regulator and reconnecting the cables to the termi-
nals marked “A” and “Al”, no charge is registered
on the ammeter, check the cut-out contacts. Ascer-
tain that they are clean and making good contact
when closed. Check the voltage at which the cut-out
contacts close by connecting a voltmeter between
the terminals marked “D” and “E”, slowly raising
the engine speed. When the voltage reaches about
12.3 to 12.7 the contacts should close. Adjust the
cutting-in voltage by means of the adjustment screw
in a manner similar to that described for the
regulator.
THE STARTER
The starter is a Lucas model M4IBG, Type AA49-
0. These identification marks are stamped on the
yoke. When ordering replacements always quote
these numbers.
To Test the Starter on the Vehicle.
Switch on the lamps and operate the starter
control. If the lights go dim but the starter is not
heard to operate, an indication is given that current
is flowing through the starter but that the starter
pinion is meshed permanently with the geared ring
of the flywheel. This has probably been caused by
the starter being operated while the engine is still


moving. In this case the starter must be removed
from the engine for examination.
Should the lamps retain their full brilliance
when the starter switch is operated, check that the
switch is functioning. Next, if the switch is in order,
examine the connections at the battery and starter
switch and also examine the wiring joining these
units.
Corroded battery terminals should be scraped
clean, and coated with mineral jelly. Continued
failure of the starter to operate indicates an
internal fault in the starter, which must be removed
for examination.
Sluggish or slow action of the starter is usually
caused by a poor connection in the wiring, which
causes a high resistance in the starter circuit.
Check the wiring as described above.
The Commutator and Brush Gear
Remove the starter cover band “A” (Fig. 7)
and examine the brushes “B” and commutator “C”.
Hold back each of the brush springs “D” and move
the brush by gently pulling on its flexible connector.
If the movement is sluggish, remove the brush from
its holder “E” and ease the sides by lightly
polishing on a smooth file. Always replace the
brushes in their original positions. If the brushes
are worn so that they do not bear on the
commutator, or if the brush flexible connector is
exposed on the running face, they must be
replaced.
If the commutator is blackened or dirty, clean
it by holding a petrol-moistened doth against it
while the armature is rotated.
Secure the body of the starter in a vice and test
by connecting it with heavy gauge cables to a
battery of the correct voltage. Connect the one cable
to the starter terminal and hold the other against
the yoke or end bracket while the switch is
operated by hand.
Under these light load conditions the starter
should run at a very high speed. If the operation
of the starter is still unsatisfactory a replacement
unit should be fitted, and the defective starter
dismantled for detailed inspection and testing.
To Dismantle the Starter
(a) Remove the cover band “A” (Fig. 7),
hold back the brush springs “B” and lift the
brushes “C” from their holder “D”.
(b) Remove the starter switch.
(c) Unscrew the nut “E” securing the field coil
lead to the contact plate in the end bracket.
Unscrew the two through bolts “F” and remove
them from the commutator end bracket and with-
draw the end bracket “G”. Remove the driving end
bracket complete with armature and drive “H”
from the starter yoke “J”.
To Remove and Replace the Starter Brushes
(a) Test the brush spring with a spring scale.
The correct tension is 30 to 40 oz. Fit a new
spring if the tension is low.
(b) If the brushes are worn so that they do not
bear properly on the commutator, or the flexible
connection is exposed to the running face, they
must be replaced. Two of the brushes are connected
to the terminal eyelets “A” (Fig. 8) attached
to the brush boxes, “B” (Fig. 8) on the
commutator end bracket, and two are connected
to tappings on the field coils. The flexible connectors
must be disconnected by unsoldering, and the
connectors of the new brushes secured in their
place by soldering. The brushes are pre-formed so
that bedding to the commutator is not necessary.
To Remove and Replace the Starter Drive
(a) If the pinion “A” (Fig. 9) is tight on the
screwed sleeve “B” wash away any dirt with
Fig. 7.—Exploded view of the starter.


kerosene and afterwards give the sleeve the merest
trace of thin machine oil.
(b)) If any parts are worn or damaged they
must be replaced.
NOTE : Pinions and sleeves are carefully paired,
and must be replaced as a pair, not separately.
Remove the cotter “C” from the shaft “D” at the
end of the starter drive. Hold the squared end of
the starter shaft at the commutator end by means
of a spanner and unscrew the square shaft nut
(left-hand thread). Lift off the main spring “E”,
screwed sleeve with pinion, collar “F”, pinion
restraining spring “G” and the sleeve “H” on
which the restraining spring fits. The drive should
be reassembled by reversing the order of
dismantling.
The Starter Commutator
A commutator in good condition will be smooth
and free from pits or burned spots. Clean the
commutator with a petrol-moistened cloth. If this
is ineffective, carefully polish with a strip of fine
glass paper while rotating the armature. To
remedy a badly worn commutator, dismantle the
starter drive as described and remove the armature
from the end bracket. Now mount the armature
in a lathe rotate it at a high speed and take a
light cut with a very sharp tool. Do not remove any
more metal than is necessary, and finally polish
with very fine glass paper.
To Remove and Replace the Field Coils
The field coils can be tested for an open circuit
by connecting a 6- or 12-volt battery, having a
bulb of the correct voltage in one of the test leads,
to the tapping points on the field coils at which
the brushes are connected. If the lamp does not
light, there is an open circuit in the wiring of the
field coils.
Lighting of the lamp does not necessarily mean
that the field coils are in order, as it is possible
that one of them may be earthed to a pole shoe
or to the yoke. This may be checked by removing
one of the test leads from the brush connector and
holding it on to a clean part of the starter yoke.
Should the bulb now light it indicates that the
field coils are earthed.
Fig. 8.—The starter end cover.
Should the above test indicate that the fault lies
in the field coils, a replacement starter must be
fitted. If, however, a pole shoe expander and wheel-
operated screwdriver are available it is possible to
replace the field coils. A pole shoe expander is
necessary in order to ensure that there will not be
any air gap between the pole shoes and the inner
face of the yoke.
(a) Remove the two insulation pieces which are
fitted beneath the field coils to prevent the inter-
coil connectors from contacting with the yoke.
(b) Mark the pole and yoke shoes in order that
they can be fitted in their original positions.
(c) Unscrew the four pole shoe retaining screws
by means of the wheel-operated screwdriver.
(d) Draw the pole shoes and field coils out of
the starter yoke and lift off the field coils.
(e) Fit the new field coils over the pole shoes
and place them in their original positions inside
the yoke. Take care to ensure that the taping of
the field coils is not trapped between the pole shoes
and the yoke.
(f) Locate the pole shoes and field coils by
lightly tightening the fixing screws.
(g) Insert the pole shoe expander, open it to
its fullest extent and tighten the screws.
(h-) Finally tighten the screws by means of the
wheel-operated screwdriver.
(i) Replace the insulation pieces between the
field coil connections and the yoke.
The Armature
Examination of the armature will in many cases
reveal the cause of failure, e.g. conductors lifted
from the commutator due to the starter being
engaged while the engine is running and causing
the armature to be driven at an excessive speed,
A damaged armature must in all cases be replaced,
no attempt should be made to machine the
armature core or to true-up a distorted armature
shaft.
To Remove and Replace the Bearings
Bearings which are worn to such an extent that
they will allow approximately .015 total side play
of the armature shaft must be replaced. To replace
the bearing bushes proceed as follows:
(a) Press the bearing bush out of the end
bracket.
Fig. 9.—Components of the starter drive.


(b) Press the new bearing bush into the' end
bracket, using a shouldered mandrel of the same
diameter as the shaft which is to fit in the bearing.
NOTE: The bearing bushes are of the phosphor
bronze type. Before fitting, the bushes should be
allowed to stand for twenty-four hours immersed
for approximately seven-eighths of their length
in thin engine oil, in order to fill the pores of the
bush with lubricant.
The reassembly of the starter is a reversal of the
operations described.
Testing the Starter Switch in Position
Test the switch with a battery provided with a
pair of test leads. The voltage of the battery should
be the same as that of the switch. Connect one
test lead to terminal “A” on the switch and
connect the other lead to the cas>e of the switch.
The switch should be heard to operate when the
circuit is completed. If the switch fails to operate
there may be a breakdown on the winding and a
replacement must be fitted. If the switch operates
but does not complete the main circuit to the
starter it is possible that the contacts are badly
damaged due to misuse of the starter switch, and
the switch must be removed for examination and,
if necessary, replacement of the contacts.
Fig. 10.—Focussing a headlamp.
To Remove the Starter Switch
(a) Disconnect the earthing cable from the
battery terminal to avoid any danger of causing
short circuits,
(b) Unscrew the bolt “B” clamping the starter
cable to the switch, and also disconnect any other
cables.
(c) Take out the four screws “C” securing the
switch to the starter end bracket. One screw is
positioned under the rubber insulator “D” but is
accessible when the insulator is held back.
(d) Pull the complete switch away from the end
bracket. If examination shows that the contacts are
badly burned, they must be replaced.
The contacts must be replaced as a complete set
comprising two fixed contact plates for fitting in
the commutator end bracket and the moving
contact disc for mounting on the switch plunger.
The new components must be accurately fitted
and a replacement must not be made unless the
contacts can be set to the dimensional limits shown.
To remove the old fixed contacts “A” from
the starter end bracket, remove the nut “B”
securing the connection from the starter and
withdraw the three screws “C” and insulating
brushes “D ,, < Fit the replacement contacts in
position, taking care to place the insulating plate
“E” beneath the contacts and to place the insulating
brushes “D” over the securing bolts before screwing
them home.
After fitting the two fixed contacts, the faces of
the contacts must be machined in order to obtain
a flat surface. The diameter of the machined portion
must be 1.00 and the depth of the machined surface
must be .245-.005 from the edge of the starter end
bracket.
To remove the original contact disc “F” withdraw
the jump ring “G” from the end of the spindle.
The correct position of the contact disc relative
to the switch fixing plate must be obtained by fitting
shims behind the disc.
Replace the spring “H” with its end caps “J” on
the spindle, and secure by means of the jump
ring “G”.
Finally fit the switch to the starter end bracket
and reconnect the leads to the switch.
Do not attempt to adjust the switch by means of
the locking nut under the rubber cap at the end of
the starter switch, as this may impair its action.
TRAFFICATORS
About every 3000 miles, or if the arms become
stiff, raise each arm and, by means of a brush or
other suitable article, apply a drop of thin machine
oil to the catch pin between the arm and the
operating mechanism. Only very slight lubrication
is required; an excess may affect the working of
the operating mechanism.


To Remove and Replace a Trifficator Bulb
If the arm fails to light when in operation, raise
the arm and examine the bulb. Replace it if
necessary by a 12-volt 3-watt festoon bulb, (Lucas
No. 256). To gam access to the bulb, withdraw the
Fig. 11.—Trafficator lubrication.
screw on the underside of the arm and slide off the
metal plate. To replace the metal plate, slide it in
an upwards direction so that the side plates engage
with the slots in the underside of the spindle
bearing.
Finally secure the plate by the fixing screw.
To Remove and Replace the Trafficator Assembly
The trafficator assemblies are fitted inside the
door pillars. To remove the assembly, proceed as
follows;
'(a) Remove the pillar casing by unscrewing the
securing screws.
Fig. 12.—Dip and switch reflectors.
(b) Remove the tacks from the trimming and the
two screws securing the board covering the
trafficator.
(c) Remove the two set screws securing the
trafficators in the pillar, and also the two wire
connections.
(d) The trafficator assembly can then be
withdrawn for further examination.
NOTE: On the right-side trafficator, in addition
to the above operations, remove the wires from
the interior light switch.
(e) Replacement of the trafficator takes place in
the reverse order to their removal.

Care must be taken to fit the two thrust washers
to each shackle pin. The shackle pin nut should be
tightened and then slackened off one-sixth of a turn
and the split pin inserted.
To Remove and Replace the Rear Spring
Lift the rear of the car by means of a hoist.
Remove the bolt securing the check strap to the
spring bracket.
Remove the shock absorber.
Remove the two ‘IT bolts securing the spring to
the axle.
Remove the shackle pins, nuts and shakeproof

The spring can now be withdrawn.
Replacement of the spring is the reversal of the
above.
See the following note.
NOTE; It is important that the ‘Silentbloc’
bushes are not given an initial stress. It is therefore
advisable to tighten the shackle pin nuts with the
weight of the car and two passengers on the
springs. By this method the bushes are made to take
up their correct position for operation under normal
conditions.
To Dismantle the Springs
Tap back carefully the leaf clips just far enough
to remove the spring leaves.
Remove the centre bolt.
The spring leaves are now free to be withdrawn.
In the case of the rear spring the dismantling is
as the above schedule, with the additional removal
of the two set screws which secure the top and
bottom clamp plates.


Fig, 2.—The front spring.
To Inspect the Springs
Clean each spring leaf thoroughly and examine
for cracks and breakages.
Check the centre bolt for being bent or worn.
(This bolt forms the location of the spring on its
axle pad).
IMPORTANT: When fitting new leaves it is
necessary that they are of the correct length and
thickness and have the same curvature as the
remaining leaves.
It is advisable, even when no leaves are broken,
to fit replacement springs when the originals have
lost their camber due to settling.
To Reassemble the Springs
Liberally grease each spring leaf, using a
graphited grease.
Place the leaves together in their correct order,
locating them with the centre bolt.
(The dowel head of the centre bolt fits under
the front spring, and on top of the rear spring).
Press the spring clips back firmly.

THE BODY
SECTION P
To Adjust the Doors
When correctly adjusted, the door, when closed,
will be a tight fit on the rubber surround. Should
it be necessary to adjust, proceed as follows:
Slacken the two screws securing the striking
plate and move the plate inwards one serration.
Tighten the screws and check. Repeat if
required.
Check also that the peg is a correct fit in the
socket of the peg plate; that is, the peg should fit
in the socket approximately f of its length.
Adjust, if necessary, by slackening the two
screws holding the plate and moving it the
required amount. Tighten the screws.
Check each hinge for slackness and, if necessary,
adjust by slackening off the hinge pin lock nut,
tighten up the main nut as required, then
retightening the lock nut.
To Clean the Body Drain Tubes
A periodical check of the body drain tubes is
necessary. The drain tubes and outlets provided are
of ample proportions, and if kept clear will cope
with all the water they are called upon to deal with
under the most severe conditions. If, however, they
become choked and the water is not drained away
Fig. 1. —Door and fittings.
it will remain behind the panels and corrosive
action will take place.
When an outlet becomes choked, the foreign
matter in it may set hard; this can be removed by
means of a rod with a blunt end.
Care must be taken when carrying out this
operation or the tube may be punctured or forced
back into the interior of the body. A considerable
amount of work would then be necessary to restore
it to its normal position or to replace it. A few
turns of adhesive tape wound round the projecting
end of the tube will avoid this risk.
The roof drain tubes and the quarter-light drain
tubes are liable to become choked at the lower ends,
and the boot lid trough tubes at their lower and
upper ends.
Do not overlook the water outlet hole in the
centre of the body rear panel immediately below
the spare wheel locker, and also those holes in the
doors.
To Disconnect the Wiring for the Removal
of the Body
Remove the battery connections.
Open the spare wheel compartment, and
disconnect the wires.
Slide the wires through the hole in the spare
wheel boot to the underside of the body.
Disconnect the petrol tank unit snap connection
from the chassis harness under the spare wheel
boot.
Disconnect the body connections (three snap
connectors) from the right side centre of the body,
also the earth wire, removing the clip at the same
time.

Disconnect the wires (body harness only) from
the control and junction boxes, and slide the
harness back through the holes in the scuttle and
dashboards.
NOTE: There are no wires on the instrument
panel to be disconnected, but the oil gauge pipe
and speedometer drive and outer cable must be
disconnected from the engine and gearbox
respectively.
To Remove and Replace the Body
Remove the wiring.
Remove the front seats from their runners and
also the rear seat cushion.

chassis at the left side and right side rear (two
each side). These are situated under the spare
wheel boot.
Remove the three bolts which secure the rear of
the body to the rear cross member of the frame and
are situated inside the spare wheel boot.
Remove the oil gauge pipe and speedometer
cables from the rear of the instrument panel.
Attach the lifting sling to the door top hinges.
