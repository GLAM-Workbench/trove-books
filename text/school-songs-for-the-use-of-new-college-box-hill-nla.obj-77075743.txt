SONGS.
THE FIRST NOWELL.
The First Nowell the angel did say, [lay ;
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the East, beyond them far ;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so continued both day and night.
And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the North-west,
O’er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Then let us all with one accord,
Sing praises to our Heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.
—Thaditiokal.
GOOD CHRISTIAN MEN REJOICE.
Good Christian men rejo’ce
With heart and soul and voice,
Give ye heed to what we say :
News! News!
Jesus Christ is born to-day !
Ox and ass before him bow,
For he is in the manger now.
Christ is born to-day.
Good Christian men, rejoice
With heart and soul and voice ;
Now ye hear of endless .bliss :
Joy! Joy!
Jesus Christ was born for this !
He hath ope’d the heavenly door,
And man is blessed evermore,
Christ was born for this !


Lo ! within a manger lies
He who built the starry skies ;
He who throned in height sublime,
Sits amid the cherubim.
Say, ye, holy shepherds say,
What your joyful news to-day :
Wherefore have ye left your sheep
On the lonely mountain steep ?
“ As we watched at dead of night,
Lo ! we saw a wondrous sight;
Angels singing peace on earth,
Told us of the Saviour’s birth.”
Sacred infant, all divine,
What a tender love was Thine;
Thus to come from highest bliss
Down to such a world as this!
Teach, 0 teach us, Holy Child,
By Thy face so meek and mild,
Teach us to resemble Thee
In Thy sweet humility !
—Rev. E. Caswall
GOOD KING WENCESLAS.
Good King Wenceslas looked out,
On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even ;
Brightly shone the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gath’ring winter fuel.
“ Hither page and stand by me.
If thou know’at it telling,
Yonder peasant who is he ?
Where and what his dwelling ? ”
“ Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain;
Right against the forest fence,
By St. Agnes’ fountain.”
‘‘•Bring me flesh and bring me wine,
Bring me pine-logs hither:
Thou and I will see him dine,
When we bear them thither,”
Page and monarch forth they went,
Forth they went together ;
Through the rude wind’s wild lament
And the bitter weather.
“ Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger ;
Fails my heart I know not how,
I can go no longer.”
“ Mark my footsteps, good my page ;
Tread thou in them boldly :
Thou shalt find the winter’s rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly”


In his master’s steps he trod,
Where the snow lay dinted;
Heat was in the very sod
Which tile saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing.
—Dr. Neale.
WASSAIL SONG.
Here we come a-wassailing
Among the leaves so green,
Here we come a-wandering,
So fair to be seen.
Love and joy come to you,
And to you your wassail to, [year,
And God bless you and send you a happy new
And God send you a happy new year.
Our wassail-cup is made
Of the rosemary tree,
And so is your beer
Of the best barley.
We are not daily beggars
That beg from door to door,
But we are neighbours’ children
Whom you have seen before.
Good master and good mistress,
As you sit by the fire,
Pray think of us poor children
Who are wandering in the mire.
We have a little purse
Made of ratching leather skin ;
We want some of your small change
To line it well within.
Call up the butler of this house,
Put on his golden ring ;
Let him bring us a glass of beer,
And the better we shall sing.
Bring us out a table,
And spread it with a cloth ;
Bring us out a mouldy cheese,
And some of your Christmas loaf.
God bless the master of this house,
Likewise the mistress too ;
And all the little children
That round the table go.
—Traditional.


VICAE OF BE AY.
In good King Charles’ golden days,
When loyalty no harm meant,
A zealous high-churchman was I,
And so I got preferment.
To teach my flock I never missed,
Kings were by God appointed ;
And lost are those who dare resist
Or touch the Lord’s anointed.
And this is law that I’ll maintain
Until my dying day, sir ;
That whatsoever king shall reign,
I’ll be the Vicar of Bray sir.
When royal James possess’d the crown,
And Popery came in fashion,
The penal laws I hooted down
And read the Declaration ;
The Church of Borne I found would fit
Full well my constitution ;
And I had been a Jesuit
But for the Revolution.
When William was our King declar’d
To ease the nation’s grievance,
With this new wind about I steered,
And swore to him allegiance.
Old principles I did revoke,
Set conscience at a distance ;
Passive obedience was a joke,
And so was non-resistance.
When royal Anne became our Queen,
The Church of England’s glory,
Another face of things was seen,
And I became a Tory ;
Occasional conformists base,
I blam’d their moderation ;
And thought the Church in danger was
By such prevarication.
When George in pudding time came o’er,
And moderate men looked big, sir,
My principles I chang’d once more,
And so became a Whig, sir ;
And thus preferment I procur’d
From our new faith’s defender ;
And almost every day abjured
The Pope and the Pretender.
Th’ illustrious house of Hanover,
And Protestant succession,
To them I do allegiance swear—
While they can hold possession;
F'or in my faith and loyalty
I nevermore will falter,
And George my lawful King shall be—
Until the times do alter.
—Old English Song.


BRITISH GRENADIERS.
Some talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules ;
Of Hector and Lysandcr, and such great names as these ;
But of all the world’s brave heroes, there’s none that can
compare
With a tow row row row row row row, to the British Grenadiers
These heroes of. antiquity ne’er saw a cannon ball,
Or knew the force of powder to slay their foes withal;
But our brave boys do know it, and banish all their fears ;
With a tow row, Ac.
Whene’er we are commanded to storm the palisades,
Our leaders march with fusees and we with hand-grenades;
We throw them from the glacis, about the enemies’ ears ;
Sing tow row, Ac.
And when the the siege is over, we to the town repair,
The townsmen ery, “ Hurra, boys, hero comes a Grenadier,
Here come the Grenadiers, my boys, who know no doubts or
fears ! ”
Then sing tow row, Ac.,
Then let us fill a bumper and drink a health to those
Who carry caps and pouches, and wear the looped clothes ;
May they and their commanders live happy all their years.
With a tow row, Ac.,
—llith Century,
SCOTS WHA HAE Wl’ WALLACE BLED.
Scots wha hae wi’ Wallace bled !
Scots wham Bruce has aften led !
Welcome to your gory bed,
Or to victorie!
Now’s the day and now’s the hour :
See the front of battle lour;
See approach proud Edward’s power—
Chains and slaverie!
Wha will be a traitor knave?
Wha can fill a coward’s grave?
Wha sae base as be a slave ?
Let him turn and flee ;
Wha for Scotland’s king and law
Freedom’s sword will strongly draw,
Freeman stand or freeman fa’,
Let him follow me !
By oppresions, woes an’ pains,
By our sons in servile chains,
We will drain our dearest veins,
But they shall be free.jj
Lay the proud ursurpers low !
Tyrants fall in every foe !
Liberty’s in every blow !
Let us do or die!
—Burns.


MINSTREL BOY.
The minstrel boy to the war is gone,
In the ranks of death you’ll find him;
His father’s sword he has girded on,
And his wild harp slung behind him.
“ Land of song ! ” said the warrior bard,
“ Tho’ all the world betrays thee,
One sword at least thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee.”
The minstrel fell! but the foeman’s chain
Could not bring that proud soul under ;
The harp he loved ne’er spoke again,
For he tore its chord asunder,
And said, “ No chain shall sully thee,
Thou soul of love and bravery!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free,
. They shalll never sound in slavery,”
—Moobe.
YE BANKS AND BRAES.
Ye banks and braes o’ bonnie Doon,
How can you bloom sae fresh and fair?
Flow can ye chant, ye little birds,
And I sae weary, fu’ o’ care ?
Ye’ll break my heart, ye warbling birds,
That wanton through the flow’ry thorn ;
Ye mind me o’ departed joys,
Departed never to return.
Oft ha’e I roved by bonnie Doon,
To see the rose and woodbine twine,
And like a bird sang of its love,
And fondly sae did I o’ mine.
\Yi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,
Fu’ sweet upon its thorny tree ;
But my fausc lover stole my rose,
And ah ! he left the thorn wi’ me.
—Bunns.
MEN OF HARLECH.
Harlech’s sons, whose dauntless sires
Burn’d with patriotic fires,
Swift in wrath that never tires,
Be a foe but nigh.
Say 1 will ye in peaceful dreaming,
When the foeman’s spear is gleaming,
When at hand his pennon’s streaming,
Flush your battle-cry ?
No ! from hill rebounding,
To rock again resounding,
Be heard that cry afar on high,
Tho’ foes be now surrounding ;
Men of Flarlech, on to glory,
Thro’ the foeman’s path before ye,
On, your deeds will live in story,
Die but scorn to yield.


Sec the arrows swiftly Hying,
Heap the ground with dead and dying,
Saxon foemen thickly lying,
Stark and grim in death !
And before night closes o’er us,
Saxon churls shall liy before us,
While we raise the exulting chorus,
With triumphant breath ;
The woods and rocks rebounding,
The echoes far resounding,
That God on high hath heard our cry,
Defeat the foe confounding.
Men of Harlech live in glory,
Ye have driven the foe before ye,
Ever shall ye live in story,
Cambria scorns to yield !
—C. J. Rowe.
COMICAL COURTSHIP.
John. One day while working at the plough,
Eal lal lal la lal lal lal la,
I felt just here, I can’t tell how,
Eal lal la lal lal lal lal lal la;
I turned my head just round to see
Who ’twas I heard when there stood thee,
Like Wenus corned out of the sea,
Eal lal lal lal lal lal lal la la.
Nan. La! John, you Hatters now I’m sure,
Eal lal, Ac.
I looked like I, and nothing more ;
Eal, lal, &c.
I’d walk’d across a Held or two,
And might look rosy cheek’d or so,
Besides I met a charming beau !
Eal lal, etc.
John. I knows the chap you mean, I trow,
Eal lal, Ac.
He’s at the squire’s here below ;
Eal lal, Ac.
Be careful Nan, take heed in time,
Here’s honest John just in his prime,
If you’d be his’n he’d be thine.
Fal lal, Ac.
Nan. Why John you’re sartain well to do,
Fal lal, Ac.
You’ve got a cow and pig or two;
Eal lal, Ac.
But mother’s magpie talks to I,
She calls me angel of the sky.
John. Then mother’s magpie tells a lie.
Fal lal, Ac.
Nan. Tell lies ; the bird does no such things.
Fal lal, Ac.
For I’m an angel.
John. Where’s your wings ?
Eal lal, Ac.


Nan. That gemman, sir, all sweet pelftimk,
Said, “ Oh, you goddess from the moon.’’’
John. He meant a witch upon a broom.
Pal lal, &c.
Nan. Well, time will shew, and John you’ll find.

COME LASSES AND LADS.
Come lasses and lads, get leave from your dads,
And away to the maypole hie,
For every fair has a sweetheart there,
And the fiddler’s standing by.
For Willie shall dance with Jane,
And Johnny has got his Joan,
To trip it, trip it, trip it, trip It,
Trip it up and down.
“ You’re out,” says Dick ; “Not I,” says Nick,
“ Twas the fiddler played it wrong ” ;
“ ’Tis true,” says Hugh, and so says Sue
And so says every one.
The fiddler then began
To play the tune again,
And ev’ry girl did trip it, trip it,
Trip it to the men.
Then after an hour they went to a bow’r,
And play’d for ale and cakes ;
And kisses too—until they were due,
The lasses held the stakes.
The girls did then begin
To quarrel with the men,
And bade them take their kisses back,
And give them their own again.
“ Hood-night,” says Harry ; “ good-night,” says Mary ;
“Good-night,” says Poll to John;
“ Good-night,” says Sue to her sweetheart Hugh ;
“ Good night,” says ev’ryone.
Some walked and some did run,
Some loiter’d on the way,
And bound themselves by kisses twelve
To meet the next holiday.
17tii Century.


SEE THE CONQUERING HERO COMES.
See the conqu’ring hero comes,
Sound the trumpets, beat the drums.
Sports prepare, the laurels bring
Songs o£ triumph to him sing.
See the conqu’ring hero comes
Sound the trumpets, beat the drums.
See the godlike youth advances,
Breathe the flutes and lead the dance ;
Myrtle wreaths and roses twine
To deck the hero’s brow divine.
—Handel,
SINCE FIRST I SAW YOUR FACE.
Since first I saw your face I resolv’d
To honor and renown you ;
If now I be disdain’d I wish
My heart had never known you.
What! I that lov’d and you that liked,
Shall we begin to wrangle ?
No, no, no ! my heart is fast,
And cannot disentangle.
The sun, whose beams most glorious are,
Rejecteth no beholder;
And your sweet beauty, past compare,
Made my poor eyes the bolder.
When beauty moves, and wit delights,
And signs of kindness bind me,
There, oh there, where’er I go,
I leave my heart behind me.
—J. Fobd.
THE HARP THAT ONCE.
The harp that once through Tara’s halls
Its soul of music shed,
Now hangs as mute on Tara’s walls
As if that soul were fled.
So sleeps the pride of former days,
So glory’s thrill is o’er ;
And hearts that once beat high for praise
Now feel that pulse no more.
No more to chiefs and ladies bright
The harp of Tara swells ;
The chord alone that breaks the night
Its tale of ruin tells :
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes ;
The only throb she gives
Is when some heart indignant breaks
To show that still she lives.
•—Moore.


DRINK TO ME ONLY WITH THINE EYES.
Drink to me only with thine eyes
And I will pledge with mine,
Or leave a kiss within the cup,
And I’ll not ask for wine ;
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine ;
Rut might I of Jove’s nectar sip,
I would not change for thine !
I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much hon’ring thee
As giving it a hope that there
It could not withered be ;
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And sent’st it back to me :
Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,
Not of itself but thee !
—B. Jonsox
GAUDEAMUS IGITUR.
Gaudeamus igitur,
Juvenes dum sumus ;
Post jucundam juventutem,
Post molestam senectutem
Nos habebit humus.
Übi sunt, qui ante nos

Vadite ad superos,
Transite ad inferos,
Übi jam fuere.
Yita nostra brevis est,
Brevi finietur,
Venit mors velociter,
Itapit nos atrociter,
Nemini parcetur.
Vivat academia,
Vivant professores,
Vivat membrum quodlibet,
Vivant membra (piaelibet,

Vivant omnes virgines
Faciles fonnosae,
Vivant et mulieres,
Vivant et mulieres,
Bonae laboriosae.

Et quae illam regit
Vivat nostra civitas,
Maeccnatum caritas,
Quae nos hie protegit.
Pereat trislitia,

NANCY LEE..
01 all the wives as e’er you know,
Yo ho ! lads ! ho ! yo ho !
There’s none like Nancy Lee, I trow,
Yo ho ’ lads ! ho ! yo ho !
See there she stands and waves liendhand upon the quay,
And ev’ry day when I’m away she’lll watch for me,
And whisper low, when tempests blhnv, for Jack at sea,
Yo ho ! lads ! ho ! yo ho !
The sailor’s wife tho sailor’s; star shall be,
Yo ho ! lads ! ho ! yo ho !
The harbour’s past the breezes blow,
’Tis long ere we come back, I know,
But true an’ bright my home will be,
An’ all so neat, an’ snug, an’ sweet, for Jack at sea,
An’ Nancy’s face to bless the place and welcome me.
The bos’n pipes the watch below,
Then here’s a health before we go,
A long, long life to my sweet wife and mates at sea,
An’ keep our bones from Davy Jones where’er we be,
An’ may you meet a mate as sweet as Nancy Lee.
THE HAIIDY NORSEMAN.
The hardy Norseman’s house of yore,
Was on the foaming wave!
And there he gathered bright renown,
The bravest of the brave !
Oh ne’er should we forget our sires,
Wherever we may be!
They bravely won a gallant name,
And ruled the stormy sea.
What though our pow’r be weaker now
Than it was wont to be,
When boldly forth our fathers sailed
To conquer Normandie.
Wo still may sing their deeds of fame
In thrilling harmony ,
For they did win a gallant name
And ruled the stormy sea.
— R. L. Du Pearsall.
YE MARINERS OF ENGLAND.
Ye mariners of England,
That guard our native seas ;
Whose llag has braved a thousand years
The battle and the breeze !
Your glorious standard launch again,
To match another foe !
And sweep through the deep
While the stormy tempests blow,
While the stormy tempests blow,
While the battle rages loud and long,
And tiie stormy tempests blow.


The spirits of your fathers
Shall start from ev’ry wave !
for the deck it was their field of fame,
And the ocean was their grave ;
Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell,
Your manly hearts shall glow,
As ye sweep thro’ the deep.
Britannia needs no bulwarks,
No towers along the steep ;
Her march is o’er the foaming waves,
Her home is on the deep.
With thunders from her native oak,
She quells the floods below ;
As they roar on the shore.
The meteor flag of England
Shall yet terrific burn:
Till danger’s troubled night depart,
And the star of peace return.
Then, then, ye ocean warriors!
Our song and feast shall flow.
To the fame of your name.
—Campbell.
THE POWDEK-MONKEY.
A yarn I’ve got to spin as how I’ve heard my old dad tell,
Of a gallant little hero who aboard the Vict’ry fell;
He was brimmin’ full o’ courage, an’ was just the sort o’ lad
To make the sort o’ sailor that our Navy’s always had.
As powder-monkey little Jim was pet of all the crew,
With his flaxen hair so curly, an’ his pretty eyes o’ blue;
An’ the bo’s’un always said as how that what got over him
Was the chorus of a sailor’s song, as sung by little Jim.
Soon we’ll be in London town, sing my lads yo ho
An’ see the King in a golden crown, sing my lads yo ho !
Heave ho ! on we go, sing my lads yo ho !
Who’s afeared to meet the foe ? Sing my lads yo ho !
In ninety-eight we chased the foe right into Bourky Bay,
And we fought away like niggers all the night till break o’’ day.
The foeman’s flagship Orient was blow’d away sky-high,
With the Admiral an’ all his crew, an’ sarve ’em right, says I.
Now little Jim was in the midst o’ all the fire and smoke,
An’ he seemed to think that fightin’ hard was nothing but a
For he handed up the powder from the magazine below, r joke,
An’ all the while a-singin’ like as if his pluck to show. ’ 1
But little Jim was book’d, for as the fight was just on won,
A musket bullet picked him off afore his song was done.
They took him to the cockpit where a smilin’ he did lie,
And the sailors—well there warn’t a man but somehow piped
Says Jim, “ My lads, don’t fret for me, but if the shore ye see,
Give a kiss to dear old mother, an’ say it came from me.”
, , , [King
An there never was a braver heart that serv’d our gracious
Than the little powder-monkey who so gaily used to sing.
—M. Watson.


THE OLD FOLKS AT HOME.
’Way clown upon de Swanee ribber,
Far, far away,
Dere’s wha my heart is turning ebber,
Dere’s wha de old folks stay.
All up and down de old creation
Sadly I roam,
Still longing for de old plantation,
And for de old folks at home.
All de world am sad and dreary
Eb’rywhere I roam.
Oh darkies how my heart grows weary
Far from de old folks at home.
All round de little farm I wander’d
When I was young,
Den many happy days I squander’d,
Many de songs I sung.
When I was playing wid my brudder,
Happy was I,
Oh ! take me to my kind old mudder,
Dere let me live and die.
One little hut among de bushes,
One dat I love,
Still sadly on my mem’ry presses
No matter where I roam ;
When will I see the bees a humming
All round de comb ;
When will I hear de banjo tumming
Down in my good old home.
THE CUCKOO.
The cuckoo now is calling,
And bids us all rejoice,
The sound of coming summer
Is ringing in his voice.
Sweet fields and glowing sunshine
His welcome music brings,
So gladly will we greet him
As cheerfully lie sings.
Send forth a song of triumph,
The spring, the spring is here.
The herald of his coming
Be-echoes far and near.
Sweet harbinger of blessing
Bright hopes to thee belong,
All nature stirs and wakens
Besponsive to thy song.


TO ALL YOU LADIES NOW ON LAND.
To all you ladies now on land,
We men at sea indite,
But first would have you understand
How hard it is to write,
The Muses now and Neptune too,
We must implore to write to you
With a fa, la, la, &a.
In justice you cannot refuse,
To think of our distress,
When we for hopes of honour lose
Our certain happiness ;
All these designs are but to prove
Ourselves more worthy of your love.
And now we’ve told you all our loves
And likewise all our fears,
In hopes this declaration moves
Some pity for our tears.
Let’s hear of no inconstancy,
We have enough of that at sea.
—Calcott.
JOHN ANDERSON, MY .TO.
John Anderson, my jo, John,
When we were first acquent,
Your locks were like the raven,
Your bonnie brow was brent;
But now your brow is bald, Jolin,
Your locks are like the snow—
Yet blessings on your frosty pow,
John Anderson, my jo.
John Anderson, my jo, John,
We clamb the hill thegither,
And mony a can tie day, John,
We’ve had wi’ ane anither;
Now we may totter down, John,
But hand in hand we’ll go,
And we’ll sleep thegither at the foot,
John Anderson, my jo.
—Buens.
TOM BOWLING.
Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling,
The darling of our crew ;
No more he’ll hear the tempest howling,
For death has broached him to.
His form was of the manliest beauty,
His heart was kind and soft;
Faithful below Tom did his duty,
And now he’s gone aloft.


Tom never from his word departed,
His virtues were so rare;
His friends were many and true hearted,
His Poll was kind and fair.
And then he’d sing so blithe arid jolly,
Ah ! many’s the time and oft;
But mirth is turned to melancholy,
For Tom is gone aloft.
Yet shall poor Tom iind pleasant weather
When He, who all commands,
Shall give, to call life’s crew together,
The word to pipe all hands.
Thus death, who kings and tars despatches,
In vain Tom’s life hath doff’d,
For though his body's under hatches,
His soul is gone aloft.

BAY OF BISCAY.
Loud roar’d the dreadful thunder,
The rain a deluge sliow’rs ;
The clouds were rent asunder
By lightning’s vivid powers.
The night was drear and dark,
Our poor devoted bark,
Till next day, there she lay,
In the Bay of Biscay, 0 1
Now dash’d upon the billows,
Her opening timbers creak ;
Each fears a wat’ry pillow,
None stop the dreadful leak.
To cling the slipp’ry shrouds,
Each breathless seaman crowds,
As she lay, till next day,
In the Bay of Biscay, 0!
At length the wish’d for morrow
Breaks through the hazy sky 1
Absorbed in silent sorrow,
Each heaves a bitter sigh.
The dismal wreck to view
Strikes horror to the crew,
As she lay till next day,
In the Bay of Biscay, 0 !
Her yielding timbers sever,
Her pitchy seams are rent;
When heaven all-bounteous ever,
Its boundless mercies sent:
A sail in sight appears,
We hail her with three cheers,
Now we sail, with the gale,
From the Bay of Biscay, 0 !

HEARTS OF OAK.
Come cheer up my lads, ’tis to glory we steer,
To add something more to this wonderful year ;
To honour we call you, not press you like slaves—
For who are so free as the sons of the wave ?
Hearts of oak are our ships,
Jolly tars are our men ;
We always are ready ;
Steady, boys, steady;
We’ll fight and we’ll conquer again and again.
We ne’er see our foes but we wish them to stay,
They never see us but they wish us away :
If they run, why, we follow, and run them ashore.
And if they won’t fight us, we cannot do more.
We’ll still make them fear, and we’ll still make them flee,
And drub ’em on shore as we’ve drubbed ’em at sea ;
Then cheer up my lads, with one heart let us sing, ’
Our soldiers, our sailors, our statesmen, our King. ’

THE HUNTING DAY.
What a fine hunting day, ’tis as balmy as May,
And the hounds to the village will come;
Every friend will be there, and all trouble and care
Will be left far behind them at home.
See servants and steeds on their way,
And sportsmen their scarlet display ;
Let us join the glad throng that goes laughing along,
And we’ll all go a-hunting to-day.
We’ll all go a-hunting to-day.
All nature is smiling and gay
So we’ll join the glad throng that goes laughing along
And we’ll all go a-hunting to-day.
Farmer Hodge to his dame says I’m sixty and lame,
Times are hard and yet my rent I must pay,
But I don’t care a jot, if I raise it or not,
For I will go a-hunting to-day ;
There’s a fox in the spinney they say,
We shall find him and get him away,
I’ll be first in the rush, and ride hard for the brush,
So I must go a-hunting to-day.
There’s the doctor in boots, with a breakfast that suits
Him of strong home-brew’d ale and good beef,
And his patients in pain say “We’re come once again
To consult you in hope of relief.”
To the poor he advice gave away,
For the rich he prescrib’d and took pay,
But to each one he said you will shortly be dead
If you don’t go a-hunting to-day.


As the judge sits in court he gets wind of the sport,
For the lawyers apply to adjourn ;
As no witnesses come, and there’s none foiund at home,
They have followed the hounds and the; horn.
Says his Worship great fines they muist pay,
If they will not our summons obey,
Yet it’s very finesport, so we’ll break up tlhe court
And we’ll all go a-hunting to-day.
Then the village bells chime, there’s a wedding at nine,
And the parson unites the fond pair ;
Then he hears the sweet sound of the honn and the hound
And he knows it is time to be there ;
Says he for your welfare I’ll pray,
And regret I no longer can stay,
Now you’re safely made one I must quickly be gone,
For I must go a-hunting to-day.
None were left in the lurch for all friends at the church
With beadle and clerk and all near,
Soon determin’d to go and to shout “ Tally Ho,”
And the ringers all joined in the rear.
With bridegroom and bride in array,
One and all to each other did say,
Let us join the glad throng that goes laughing along
And we’ll all go a-hunting to-day.
There is only one cure for all maladies sure
That reaches the heart to its core,
’Tis the sound of the horn on a fine hunting morn,
And where is the heart wishing more;
It turneth the grave into gay,
Makes pain unto pleasure give way,
Makes the weak become strong and the old become young,
So we’ll all go a-hunting to-day.
—W. Williams.
JOHN PEEL.
D’ye ken John Peel, with his coat so gay ?
D’ye ken John Peel at the break of day?
D’ye ken John Peel when he’s far, far away,
With his hounds and his horn in the morning ?
For the sound of his horn brought me from my bed,
Aud the cry of his hounds which he ofttimes led,
Peel’s “ View Halloo ” would awaken the dead,
Or the fox from his lair in the morning.
Yes I ken John Peel, and Ruby too,
Banter and Ringwood, Bellman and True,
From a find to a check, from a check to a view,
From a view to a death in the morning.
Then here’s to John Peel from my heart and soul,
Let’s us drink to his health, let’s finish the bowl,
We’ll follow John Peel thro’ fair and through foul
If we want a good hunt in the morning.


D’ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay ?
He lived at Troutbeck once on a day,
Now he has gone far, far away,
We shall ne’er hear his voice in the morning.
—Old Enolisii Song
A.HUNTING WE WILL GO.
The dusky night rides down the sky,
And ushers in the morn ;
The hounds all join in glorious cry,
The huntsman winds his horn.
Then a-liunting we will go.
The wife around her husband throws
Her arms, and begs his stay :
“ My dear, it rains, it hails, it snows,
You will not hunt to-day? ”
"A brushing fox in yonder wood,
Secure to find we seek;
For why? I carried, sound and good,
A cart-load there last week.”
Away he goes, he flies, the rout
Their steeds all spur and switch ;
Some are thrown in and some thrown out,
And some thrown in the ditch.
At length his strength to faintness worn
Poor Reynard ceases flight;
Then hungry homeward we return,
To feast away the night.
—Fielding
HERE’S A HEALTH UNTO HIS MAJESTY.
Here’s a health unto his majesty,
With a fa la la la la la la ;
Confusion to his enemies,
With a fa la la la la la la ;
And he that will not drink his health,
I wish him neither wit nor wealth,
Nor yet a rope to hang himself.

THE WREATH.
Ye shepherds, tell me, tell me have you seen,
Have you seen my Flora pass this way ?
In shape and feature beauty’s Queen,
In pastoral, in pastoral array.
Shepherds toll me, tell me, tell mo have you seen,
Have you seen my Flora pass this way?
A wreath around her head, around her head she wore,
Carnation lily, lily rose,
And in her hand a crook she bore,
And sweets her breath compose.


The beauteous, the beauteous wreath,
That decks, that decks her head,
Forms her description, her description true.
Hands lity white, lips crimson red,
And cheeks of rosy, rosy hue.

HARVEST TIME.
Thro’ lanes and hedgerows pearly,
Go forth the reapers early
Among the yellow corn,
Good luck betide the shearing,
For winter-tide is nearing,
And we must till the barn.
Tral la la la, tral la la la
The busy harvest time.
At noon they leave the meadow,
Beneath the friendly shadow
Of monarch oak to dine,
And ’mid his branches hoary
Goes up the thankful story,
The harvest is so fine.
The blesied harvest time
And when the west is burning,
From shaven field returning
Upon the wain they come.
When all their hamlet neighbours
Rejoice to end their labors,
With merry harvest home.
The joyous harvest home !

YOUNG CADETS.
Here’s a pretty set of us, Young Cadets!
Here’s a pretty set of us,
Making quite a mighty fuss !
Surely none can rival us, Young Cadets.
Our uniforms look new, Young Cadets!
But we’ll make our rivals chew,
For this fact is very true
That we are a martial crew of Young Cadets.
Once upon the shooting ground, Young Cadets,
There we fired round on round
And we made the target sound,
For our shooting did astound, Young Cadets.
Homeward then we came again, Young Cadets,
Shoulders aching with the pain,
Eucalyptus all in vain,
But we’d like to go again, Young Cadets.
Now I bid you all to join, the Young Cadets,
For they all declare its “ foine,”
And they really do a “ shoine,”
Therefore surely all will join, the Young Cadets.

BOABDEBS’ WAR SONG.
Buck in boarders, rouse around now ;
Thrash the day-scrags black and blue ;
Don’t funk Robbie ; on the ball Piggy !
Now then Johnnie, put it through.
Up she goes and down she goes
Here she is and there she is,
Boot it while you may !
Let the umpire wave the flags,
One’s a behind and two’s a goal;
Won the game ; hooray !
Come now, boarders ; last quarter now !
Up for a mark, there, Pat and Roof !
Well done Bcelze ! toddle on Jeers 1
Now then, Tinny, there’s a goal!

Here’s a health to all good lasses,
Here’s a health to all good lasses,
Here’s a health to all good lassos
Pledge it merrily, till your glasses,
Let a bumper toast go round,

May they live in tranquil pleasure,
Without mixture, without measure,
For with them true joys are found,
For with them true joys are found.
All good lasses ! Here’s a bumper,
Fill your glasses ! Here’s a bumper,
Here’s a health to all good lasses,
Pledge it merrily, fill your glasses,

0 WHO WILL O’ER THE DOWNS WITH ME.
0 who will o’er the downs with me,
0 who will with me ride ;
0 who will up and follow me
To win a blooming bride.
Her father he has locked the door,
Her mother keeps the key,
But neither door nor bolt shall part
My own'true love from me.
I saw her bow’r at twilight grey,
’Twas guarded safe and sure ;
I saw her bow’r at break of day,
’Twas guarded then no more.
The varlets they were all asleep,
And none was there to see
The greeting fair that passed there
Between my love and me.


I promis’d her to come at night,
With comrades brave and true ;
A gallant band with sword in hand
To break her prison through.
I promised her to come at night
She’s waiting now for me,
And ere the dawn of morning light,
I’ll set my true love free.
And ere the dawn of morning light,
I’ll set my true love free.

GLOBIOUS APOLLO.
Glorious Apollo from on high beheld us,
Wandering to find a temple for his praise,
Sent Polyhymnia hither to help us
While we ourselves such a temple might raise.
Thus then combining, hands and hearts joining,
Sing we in harmony Apollo’s praise.
Apollo’s praise, Apollo’s praise.
Here every generous sentiment awaking,
Music inspiring unity and joy,
Each social pleasure giving and partaking,
Glee and good humor our hours employ.
Thus then combining, hands and hearts joining,
Long may continue our unity and joy,
Our unity and joy, our unity and joy.

AILEEN AEOON.
When like the early rose, Aileen Aroon,
Beauty in childhood glows, Aileen Aroon,
When like a diadem
Buds blush around the stem,
Which is the fairest gem ? Aileen Aroon.
Is it the laughing eye ? Aileen Aroon.
Is it the timid sigh ? Aileen Aroon.
Is it the tender tone,
Soft as the stringed harps moan ?
No, it is truth alone ; Aileen Aroon.
I know a valley fair, Aileen Aroon.
I know a cottage there, Aileen Aroon.
Ear in that valley’s shade,
I know a gentle maid,
Flower of the hazel glade, Aileen Aroon.
Who in the song so sweet ? Aileen Aroon.
Who in the dance so sweet ? Aileen Aroon.
Dear are her charms to me,
Dearer her laughter free,
Dearest her constancy. Aileen Aroon.
Youth must with lime decay, Aileen Aroon.
Beauty must fade away, Aileen Aroon.
Castles are sacked in war,
Chieftains are scattered far,
Truth is a fixed star. Aileen Aroon.

AN AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM.
Maker of Earth and Sea.
Maker of earth and sea,
What shall we render Thee ?
AH things are Thine:
Ours but from day to day,
Still may we ever pray,
“ God bless our land ahvay,
This land of Thine.”
Mighty in brotherhood,
Mighty for God and good,
Let us be Thine. .
Here let the nations see
Toil from the curse set free,
Labour and liberty
One cause—and Thine.
Here let glad plenty reign,
Here let none seek in vain,
Our help and Thine —
No heart for want of friend,
Fail ere the timely end,
But love for ever blend
Man’s cause and Thine,


Here let Thy peace aliidle ;
Never may strife divide
This land of Thine.
Let us united stand,
One great Australian baand,
Heart to heart, hand im hand,
Heart and hand Thime.
Strong to defend our riight,
Proud in all nations’ sijght,
Lowly in Thine—
One in all noble fame,.
Still be our path the srame,
Onward in freedom’s mame,
Upward in Thine.

HULK BHITANNIA.
When Britain first, at heav’n’ss command,
Arose from out the azure main,
This was the charter, the charter of the land,
And guardians angels sang this strain:
Buie Britannia, Britannia rules the waves !
Britons never, never, never shall be slaves !
The nations not so blest as thee
Must in their turn to tyrants fall;
While thou shalt flourish great and free,
The dread and envy of them all.
Still more majestic shalt thou rise,
More dreadful from each foreign stroke;
As the loud blast that tears the skies
Serves but to root thy native oak.
Thee haughty tyrants ne’er shall tame,
All their attempts to bend thee down
Will but arouse thy generous flame,
But work their woe, and thy renown.
The Muses, still with freedom found,
Shall to thy happy court repair ;
Blest Isle ! witli matchless beauty crown’d,
And manly hearts to guard the fair.
NATIONAL ANTHEM.
God Save the Queen.
God save our gracious Queen,
Long live our noble Queen,
God save the Queen,
Lend her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the Queen,


D, Lord our God arise,
Scatter her enemies,
And make them fall;
Confound their polities,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all.
Thy choicest gifts in store,
On her be pleased to pour,
Long may she reign 1
May she defend our laws,
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the Queen.
