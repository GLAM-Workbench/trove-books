TWO OLD JOURNALS.
Being the Diaries of Major H. C. ANTILL on the Voyage to New South
Wales in 1809, and on a Trip Across the Blue Mountains in 1815.




Major H. C, Antill.




Prefatory Note.
Nearly one hundred and five years ago when Major (then Captain) H. C.
Antill came to Australia as A.D.C. to Governor Macquarie, he kept a diary
of the voyage, and when in 1815 he accompanied the Governor on the trip
over the just completed road to Bathurst, he again kept a journal. The
party included John William Lewin, A.L.S., the water-colour painter, who
made some twenty sketches of the scenery, &c., on the trip.
The diaries and some of the drawings are now in possession of Major
Antill’s grandson, H. E. Antill, Esq., of Jarvisfield, Picton, and it is by his
kind permission that an exact transcript of the diaries, and reproductions of
some of the drawings, are now published.

Journal of the Voyage from England to New South Wales in 180°
By Major H. C. Antill, 73rd Regiment.
Henry Golden Antill, son of Major John Antill. Born at New York,
N.A., Ist May, 1779. Entered the army as ensign in H.M. 7‘ird Highland
Regiment, 15th August, 1796. Served in India against Tippoo Sahib, and
carried the regimental colours at the storming of Seringapatam, -Ith May,
1799, when he was severely wounded. Promoted to captain, lltli January,
1809, and came to Australia with his regiment and Governor Macquarie,
his colonel, in the same year, and was A.D.C. till the year 1815, when he
was appointed Major of Brigade. In 1825 he retired on half pay, and went
to reside on his military grant at Jarvisfield, Picton [named after Governor
Macquarie’s estate in Scotland], where he died on 14th August, 1852.
His father, Major John Antill, and his uncle, Edward, were both in the
army in America, and fought on opposite sides in the War of the Indepen-
dence, Major John Antill being with the British troops.


On board His Majesty’s ship “ Dromedary ” at sea—latitude
39'21 South ; longitude 63 24 East. November 7th, 1809.
These sheets I dedicate to two of my sincerest friends I have in the world;
to my sister, and my dear Mary, nor can I begin them on a better day than
this day, being the united birthday of both; and though tossed as I am at
the present moment on the wide troubled ocean, I will endeavour as far as
my memory will assist me to collect and record the events that have
happened to me since the beginning of the present year, and during our
long voyage thus far, and I hope to be able from time to time to carry
them on till I have the pleasure of seeing you both again; in the meantime
take the wish of my heart, sincerely do I hope you both may enjoy many
and happy returns of this day, may the Kind Providence who ruleth over all
His works, guard and keep you in virtue, health and happiness.
You know, my dear Eliza, I have long promised to keep a journal for your
amusement, but until now have neglected to do so, since I am. therefore
likely to be deprived of the happiness of seeing you for some years to come,
I will now endeavour to fulfil this promise, and should these sheets afford
an hour’s amusement to my friends, the end I have in view will be fully
answered, and will recompense me for any little trouble I shall have been
at in writing them.
In the peaceful retirement of the City of Glasgow in Scotland where I
had been stationed for some time on the recruiting service, and where I
was enjoying the delights of friendship in the company of a few select
families, I received an order about the latter end of December 1808, from
the Head-Quarters of the Kegiment then quartered at Perth, to hold myself
in readiness, with the party under my command, to join my Corps at the
shortest notice as intimation had been received of its being ordered on
foreign service, this order as being wholly unexpected created not a little
surprise and some anxiety in my mind, as I fully expected we should have
been exempted from foreign duty for some time to come as the regiment
had had but two years before returned from the East Indies where it had
been for the last seven and twenty years, and I well knew we were still
very weak and unfit for service, and was uncertain what destination they
could intend us for, besides I had promised myself the happiness of a long
leave of absence in the spring that was commencing, for the purpose of
crossing the Atlantic to pay my long wished for visit to those relatives so
dear to my heart, but as I had made the resolution of murmuring as little
as possible at the events of this life, convinced with Pope that “ Whatever
is, is right,” I went to work with all haste to prepare to obey the order I
had received, and on the 3rd of January, 1809 having paid what small debts
I was due, and taking leave of my friends, I sent my trunks by the carrier’s
waggon, and took a seat in the coach for Edinburgh, 'to which place I had


previously sent my party, and where I arrived the same evening, a distance
of forty-two miles. I found the regiment had arrived two days before me,
and were in barracks in the Castle till the small vessels that were to carry
us to England could be got ready for our reception.
I shall not dwell on the regret I felt at leaving Glasgow. It is needless
to describe to you the pangs of parting with friends we love and esteem;
mine were sufficiently acute to draw a tear even from the eye of a soldier:
you may both smile at the idea but let me ask you why a soldier should be
denied the luxury of a tear; is his heart to be harder than another because
his way of life are so? I trust neither of you are of this way of thinking,
for, after the kind attention I have received from those friends, it must
have been a hard heart indeed that could have parted from them with
indifference.
As I stated before, on my arrival at Edinburgh I found the regiment
expecting to embark every hour on board four Berwick smacks, which had
been provided for us, and was informed that our destination was the distant
Colony of New South Wales, that upon arrival in England two large ships
of war would be in readiness to receive us, and that we should sail as soon
as arrangements could be made for that purpose.
You may naturally suppose, my dear friends, that my reflections were not
the most agreeable at the prospect of so distant a voyage of upwards of
sixteen thousand miles to a place so little known; my regrets were, I think,
in some degree natural, but as I was determined to dwell upon the subject
as little as possible, I was resolved to be thankful it -was no worse, and to
look forward with hope to a future day however distant, when I might
return to my Native Country, where retired from all my toils and troubles
I might “ weep o’er my wounds and deeds of valour done,” and with a small
competency enjoy for the remainder of my days the society of those friends
I have been so long separated from —this hope, my dear Eliza has taken
full possession of my mind, and by the blessing of God I trust I may see
it realised. But to proceed, after remaining for a week or two at Edin-
burgh Castle, we embarked at Leith, and after a tedious and stormy passage
of upwards of a month arrived safe at Portsmouth.
At the season of the year we embarked from Scotland, the passage is
very dangerous, and tho’ our ships were very excellent ones, we were twice
very nearly lost, the wind blowing mostly from the S.W. in strong gales with
very cold weather, we changed our ships at Gravesend, and were removed
to two transports, which, though larger vessels, were not such good sea boats
as those we had quitted.
On our arrival at Gravesend we learnt with much satisfaction that the
Government had thought proper to give us a Second Battalion which pro-
moted me and two other brother subs to Companies, so the old proverb
was verified in this instance “ that evil seldom happens without some*
good attending it,” to add to my good fortune on my arrival at Ports-
mouth I received a letter from my commanding officer Colonel Macquarie
stating that the Governor appointed to New South Wales had applied to


him to recommend an officer to be his Aide-De-Camp from any of those of
the Regiment he thought capable of filling the situation, and that in conse-
quence of this application he had mentioned me as one he thought would
answer, that if I had no objection to the situation, I had his permission to
•come up to Town to pay my respects, and return thanks to General
Nightingall for the honour he had done me.
In this instance I had once more to admire the good fortune, or more
properly speaking the Kindness of Providence that had attended me through
life; I was here without any merit of my own, taken by the hand and
promoted to a situation every way to my wish, how thankful ought I to be,
and indeed I am to those friends who had been so kind and attentive to my
interests. I immediately wrote a suitable reply to the letter I had received,
and prepared to proceed to London as soon as the regiment should be landed,
which they were in a few days afterwards in the Isle of Wight, and
arrived without any accident worth mentioning by nine o’clock the next
morning in London.
In the course of the day I called upon Colonel Macquarie and was by
him taken and introduced to General Nightingall, who received me with
much politeness, and was told by him that as his appointment to the
■Government of New South Wales had not yet taken place, mine of course
would not either. I was however permitted at my own request to remain
in town by leave from the Commander-in-Chief and I immediately took
lodgings in Suffolk-street, Charing Cross.
From this time till the latter end of March I remained in town occa-
sionally visiting my friends at Black Heath, where I always met with the
kindest reception; of this my dear Mary you need not be told, as you
so largely contributed to the happiness I there enjoyed, and I hope you
and your amiable family will not refuse in this place the tribute of a
grateful heart.
These visits I generally made on foot walking down to the Ileath on
the Sunday morning to breakfast, and returning to town on the Monday to
attend to any little business the General might have for me to do. I made
it my duty to call upon him every morning but except a few trifling
commissions he gave me to execute I had nothing to do, as he had not
yet received any further intimation from the Government respecting his
appointment; this delay appeared strange as the ships had been reported
some time back ready to receive the troops, but I afterwards understood
that this delay was occasioned by the desire Government had of
receiving accounts from the Colony which they were in daily expectation
would arrive. During the interval General Nightingall was attacked with
so violent a Rheumatism that when the expected accounts did arrive and
we were ordered to embark and proceed with all expedition, he found himself
under the necessity of applying for a short delay, which as it could not be
granted, he was obliged from the ill state of his health to decline the
situation altogether as no person was immediately nominated to succeed
"him, I had every reason to suppose there was an end to all my bright
•(Prospects and that I should be obliged to put up with my loss I had


incurred in making up staff uniform. I therefore with a heavy heart took
leave of the General and the rest of my friends in Town and took my
departure to join the Regiment but before I left London I was desired by
the friend who had recommended me not to despair and was led to hope
from these words that I might expect to regain the situation I had lost under
General Nightingall under the person who should succeed him, little did
I think that he would be that person himself. I of course the moment
this was made known to him which was after I had returned to the Isle
of Wight received notice of it with the fulfillment of the promise he had
made but that it could not take place till our arrival at our destination,
with this you may be sure I was well content, and again returned to town
to make a few arrangements, where I remained a few days and then joined
my regiment once more.
In this place, my dear Mary, I think it necessary to give you my reasons
for taking leave of you and my friends at the Heath as I did by letter
instead of personally.
Just before I left London, I received a letter from my dear aunt and
though I be ever thankful to her for her kind approbation of my conduct
yet I thought from some part of the contents it was her wish I should take
my leave in the manner I did, perhaps it was better I did so, and I hope
you have long ago forgiven me any seeming neglect. I generally find I
can make mes adieux better on paper than by word of mouth; on these
occasions I have seldom a word to say for myself.
It was a considerable time after I returned to the Isle of Wight before
the Regiment embarked, there were so many things required for so long a
voyage that a long time was required to supply them; during the stay
of the regiment at Colville they were so scattered about and uncomfortably
accommodated that I was glad for many reasons when I saw the two ships
arrive in which we were to embark on the sth of April off Yarmouth, and
orders issued to prepare to go on board.
On Sunday May 7th, the Regiment being assembled on the Parade at
Colville Barracks marched down to Yarmouth, where 15 officers, 451 rank
and file, 90 women and 87 children embarked on board H.M. ship
Dromedary, Mr. John Pritchard master; and 10 officers, 400 rank and
file, and 97 women and children on board H.M. ship Hindostan, Captain
John Pasco—both large roomy ships—the two following days were em-
ployed in receiving the baggage belonging to the officers and men, which
done we weighed and made sail for Spithead but had hardly got half way
before we struck on a place, Old Castle Point, but fortunately soon got off
again without receiving any damage, and came to anchor in the evening;
the next day weighed and anchored at Spithead in 16 fathom water about
4 miles from Portsmouth; we remained there till the 19th, when we again
moved our station down to St. Helen’s and receiving here Colonel
Macquarie the Governor, his Lady, Mr. and Mrs. Bent, the Judge Advocate,
with their servants and baggage, and in company with two transports
bound for the Cape of Good Hope took our departure from Old England,
perhaps to be absent from it for some years.


During our stay at St. Helen’s we found from the number of men
women and children on board that we were too much crowded. Applica-
tion was in consequence made, and 31 men were sent on board the
Hindostan, and two officers, 50 privates, and 41 women and children were sent
on shore at Portsmouth to follow in the first Convict ship; we likewise took
down all the standing berths which had been fitted up for the troops and
issued out hammocks as being both-better calculated to keep the ship
sweet and clean, and affording considerably more room. Every day during
the voyage before 8 o’clock in the morning every man’s hammock was
brought upon deck and stowed away in the netting, the decks were washed
and scraped and no person permitted to remain below when the weather
would allow their remaining upon deck, we regulated the men likewise into
three watches commanded by an officer who took his rotation of duty on deck
with the watch he belonged to.
Wednesday, 24th May.—Light breezes and pleasant weather; the Hart
Point about four leagues, exchanged numbers with H.M. Ship Amethyst,
and likewise with H.M. Ship Swallow.
Thursday, 25th. —Exchanged numbers with H.M. Ship Hero. Lat. 48°
32' N., long. 8° W.
Friday, May 2(>th. —At 4 o’clock p.m. two strange sail in sight, bore up
towards them, signal from Commodore to prepare for battle, shortly after
another strange sail in sight, as they continued their course without taking
any notice of us, we did the same; we thought we observed a signal from
one but was at too great a distance to make out what it was. Lat. 48° 6' N.,
long. 9° 47' W.
Saturday, 27th. —The wife of William Monogan was delivered of a
son; punished six privates of the regiment for sleeping on watch; par-
ticular orders had been given to prevent this dangerous practice and it
was necessary to make an example at the beginning of the voyage to pre-
vent a repetition of it in future; a strange sail in sight; signal from the
Commodore for us to give chase and examine her. As we had much the
advantage of her in sailing, soon gained on her and fired three guns to
bring her to—hoisted French colours and fired four more guns shotted;
at 5 p.m. being come up with the chase, shortened sail, hauled down French
and Hoisted English colours when Chase struck hers, French over Swedish,
lowered the boat and sent 2 midshipmen and 10 privates on board; she
proved to be the Gustavus, from Charlestown, bound for Liverpool, J.
Bartlett, master, captured by a French privateer five days before. Sent
prisoners on board the Commodore.
Thursday, May 30th.—Chased a strange sail, fired 3 guns to bring her to;
at 6 o’clock p.m. came up with and boarded the chase; she proved to be
the Prozzle, schooner, from Guernsey, bound to Malta, laden with sugar
At 3 o’clock this day parted with the prize taken yesterday, sent her to
England in charge of an officer from the Hindostan, wrote letters by her
to my friends to tell them we had got thus far in safety.


Thursday, June Ist.—Strong gales with rain, chased and brought to
an American, the sea too high to board her. She said she was from
Madeira, bound to Gottenburg.
Saturday, June 3rd. —Exchanged nos. with H.M. Ship Ocean. Strong-
gales and a very heavy swell which is generally the case in crossing the
Bay of Biscay.
Sunday, June 4th.—Commemorated the Birthday of our Gracious
Sovereign. Eresh breezes and cloudy with a heavy sea. Exchanged numbers-
with H.M. Ship Magician, the sea running very high and blowing very
hard; in her endeavouring to communicate with the Commodore her boat
was upset and the Boatswain and one man lost. A man of the Hindostan
behaved in the most gallant manner; on seeing the accident he jumped over-
board, and through his exertions saved two men; he was rewarded by a
subscription raised on board the Hindostan. Departed this life, Mr. Donald,
seaman. Lying to under the Mizen and storm staysail. Lat. 42° 38' N.,
long. 11° 14' W.
June sth. —Gale still continues; lying to as before, strange sail in sight,
fired a gun to bring her to, proved to be a sloop from Gibraltar. Lat.
42° 38' N., long. 10° 51' W.
Thursday, June Bth. —Showed our number to a cutter. Chased a strange
sail, came up and boarded an American from Teneriffe bound to Cannes.
Lat. 38° 25' IST., long. 11° 36' W.
Sunday, 11th.—Twenty minutes after 10 a.m. saw the land of Porte
Santo.
Monday, 12th at 5 o’clock a.m. came to anchor with the small bower in
Funchall Boads, Island of Madeira, in 45 fathoms water. In the evening
arrived H.M. Ship Magician. On making the land the morning before,
we mistook the Island of Disertis for that of Madeira, in consequence
of which we got so much to leeward before we found out our mistake that
we were obliged to beat up all night.
The town of Funchall, in the island of Madeira, is in lat. 32° 37', long.
17° s', and has a most beautiful and romantic appearance from the Hoads,
being situated at the bottom of the Bay; the ground rises behind at first
with a gradual and afterwards with a very steep ascent in the form of an
amphitheatre, and is covered with vineyards, villas and convents. The town
loses much of its beauty in a nearer approach, the streets being narrow
and dirty.
This being too early in the season for fruit, very little was to be had;
this was a great disappointment to those who expected to feast on the
grapes for which the Island is so famous; the cultivation of the vine
depends much upon the soil exposure and supply of water; one or more
walks a yard or two wide intersect each vineyard and these are enclosed by a
stone wall two feet high along the walks which are arched over with
laths about seven feet high, they erect wooden pillars to support the lattice
work of bamboos which slope down on each side; the vines are in this
manner supported from the ground, and the people have room to weed


underneath and likewise to cut the grapes. The gardens produce peaches,
apricots, quinces, apples, pears, etc., etc., together with some tropical fruits
such as bannanas, guavas and pineapples.
All the common domestic animals of Europe are to be found in Madeira
and their mutton and beef though small is very well tasted. Report says
there are no snakes on the island, and that if brought to it they immediately
die. Our stay here was too short to Tnake many observations for after
watering and procuring what little refreshments could be had, we sailed
on the evening of the 19th June, but made little progress through the night,
as the island could be plainly seen the next morning from the cabin
windows.
Tuesday, June 20th. —Strange sail in sight, sent in chase proved to be
a Portuguese from Oporto bound to Brazil. Moderate breezes and cloudy.
Lat. 31° 46' K, long. 17° 20' W.
Wednesday, 21st.—Palma, one of the Canary Islands, in sight this morning
at daybreak. Passed it about 10 o’clock distant 15 or 20 miles. Robert
Watt, a man of my company, departed this life during the night; this
poor fellow was perfectly well a few days before and died of a fever.
Strange sail in sight, sent in chase she proved to be a Spanish brig from
Malaga bound to Vera Cruz.
Sunday, June 25th. —Fresh breezes and cloudy. Performed Divine ser-
vice for the first time. The service read by Mr. Bent, the Judge Advocate.
Passed the Tropic of Cancer, in longitude 20° 1' W., with a tine steady
trade wind, going at the rate of seven knots under 2, and sometimes
3 topsails, our usual number, and obliged to keep under this easy sail
to avoid going ahead of the Commodore, who, with one and twenty and
sometimes four and twenty sails, could scarcely keep pace with us. Lat.
20° 58' N.
Wednesday, June 28th. —Light breezes and cloudy. Saw the island of
Sail at daylight on our larboard quarter, distance 5 or 6 leagues, and at
11 the island of Bonavista bearing S.S.W.
Thursday, 29th. —At 8 o’clock a.m. saw the Island of Mazo and at 2 p.m.
came to anchor in Port Prays Roards, Island of St. Jago, with the small
bower, in a quarter less 7 fathoms, about a mile from the shore.
This part of the island has a most barren appearance, tho’ I was told
the interior is fertile; the Capital is about 12 miles inland, and is called
St. Jago, but the port where the shipping anchor is called Port Praya and
is a most wretched place. The Town, if it can be called tuch, consists of
one wide street, with a row of miserable huts on each side, situated on the
brow of a steep bank leading down to the sea. The appearance of the
inhabitants corresponds with the Town, and partakes of the battered con-
dition of their habitation; they are so badly off for all kinds of clothing
than you can have here an excellent market for all your old cast-off clothes,
preferring this kind of barter to money. For an old coat, hat, or sword
you can procure fruit, vegetables, and poultry. The military appear in


little better condition than the Town or inhabitants they have to defend,
and have to perform the duty with muskets, some without barrels and
others without locks; with old cocked hats and tattered regimentals make
a most ludicrous turn out. We only remained here 24 hours, and of course
could procure but little refreshments in that time, and were not sorry to
leave a place that had nothing striking or interesting about it.
Friday, 30th.—In the evening weighed and stood out of the harbour.
Sunday, July 2nd. —Performed Divine Service this day and every other
Sunday when the weather was fine.
Monday, 3rd. —Calm weather and cloudy. Departed this life, Mrs. Ann
Murray and a child of Evan Davis’s.
Tuesday, 4th. —Light airs and squally, with thunder, lightning and rain.
Wednesday, sth. —Strange sail in sight to windward, gave chase and fired
two guns to bring her to, she appeared suspicious at first in not hoisting
her colours, stood to our quarters, on coming up with her she proved to be
an American from Philadelphia bound to Canton.
Wednesday, 26th. —The wife of Thomas Miller delivered of a daughter.
Signal from the Commodore for seeing land —the Island of St. Paul’s,
not seen by us, suspected he must have seen Cape Flyaway,* as we were
distant from it more than 100 miles.
Saturday, 29th at 1 o’clock crossed the Equator in longitude 34° T
with a fine steady breeze. Captain and Mrs. Pasco, of the Hindostan,
Captain and Mrs. Murray, and Captain Glenholme dined on board yesterday.
Tuesday, August Ist fell in with and gave chase to a small Portu-
guese sloop from Buenos Ayres hound to San Salvadore.
Thursday, 3rd chased another strange sail, she proved to be a
Portuguese brig from the coast of Guinea bound to Rio de Janeiro with
436 female slaves on board. These poor wretches we were told were con-
fined in the hole of this small ship and were dying by dozens, and the
master who commanded frequently threw them overboard the moment they
were taken ill, that the infection might not spread to the rest; this I
should hope for the sake of human nature was not true.
Friday, 4th. —Moderate breezes and clear weather; drawing towards the
American coast. Sounded but found no bottom with a line of 75 fathoms.
Lat. 22° 31', long. 30° 53' W. Thermometer, 75°.
Saturday, sth. —Light airs and cloudy. Sounded in 95 fathoms, sandy
bottom. At 5 p.m. saw the land bearing W.N.W., and on the 7th came to
anchor in the Harbour of Rio de Janeiro in 20 fathoms of water about 2
miles from the town.
Rio de Janeiro, a Portuguese settlement in South America, lies in south
latitude 23° 31' west, longitude 43° 51'. St. Sebastian is now the Capital
of their settlements in this part of the world and the residence of the
Prince Regent of Portugal. The Bay of Rio is very extensive and secure,
the entrance is between two forts about i mile across, on passing which
* Cape Flyaway—Applied when imaginary land is seen by a landlubber.


the harbour opens to more than 4 miles, and extends upwards of thirty, and
is large enough to contain the whole Navy of Britain, and perhaps of the
world. It is interspersed into Islands and surrounded with lofty mountains,
which give it a most romantic appearance. At the foot of one of these, on
the left after you enter, is the Town of St. Sebastian; it has a very good
landing-place built of stone and one also for watering and shipping;
abundance of fruit and other vegetables are to be had here, especially
oranges, which abound in such plenty that they can be purchased for little
or nothing and afford a most grateful refreshment to the ships; the beef is
poor and not very good, but there is plenty of most excellent fish. The Town
is large and pleasantly situated, but like all other Portuguese settlements,
the streets are narrow and dirty. The palace of the Prince Regent is
near the Landing Place and forms three sides of a square, but has nothing
in its external appearance to deserve notice.
On Sunday the 20th the Jollyboat of the Dromedary was missing in
the morning at daybreak, having been taken by two men of the 73rd Regi-
ment, who had taken the opportunity of deserting. In the evening the boat
was brought back by some Portuguese, who reported they had found her
on the beach some way up the harbour but had seen nothing of the
soldiers.
Wednesday, 23rd.—Early in the morning weighed ana stood out of the
harbour after remaining here 16 days; sent Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Macquarie’s
maid, on shore at her own request. We had a fine breeze which carried
us out of sight of land before next morning, course S. by E.
Sunday, 27th. —This day was married Mrs. Watts, widow of the late
Robert Watts, Private in the 73rd Regiment, to one of the sailors of the
ship. This woman’s husband had not been dead more than two months.
We experienced a severe gale of wind that lasted the whole of this day and
part of the day following.
Friday, Sept. Ist. —At 2 p.m., hove to having lost Chas. Tompkins over-
board, lowered the boat but without any success, as nothing could be
seen of him. The alarm was given that he was missing, as he had been
sent over the ship’s side not half an hour before to calk in one of the
scuttles; he refused to be secured by a rope and it was supposed he had
dropped from the ship’s side; the ship was going nine knots through the
water at the time. This is a melancholy instance of the uncertainty of life
and a warning to us how necessary it is to be prepared to meet that death
which in a moment like the present instance may overtake us. This poor
fellow went merrily over the ship’s side not a quarter of an hour before
and little thought of the awful summons that awaited him—he was, I
believe, a quiet well-behaved man.
Sept. 9th. —Steady breeze, the wind nearly aft; running down 3 degree*
of longitude a day; very cold, sometimes rainy.
Sept. 13th.—Wind shifted to the Eastward against us, much hard motion
in consequence. Latitude 35° 52' S., long. 2° 43' E. Thermometer, 51°..
Sept. 18th.'—Sent a boat on board the Hindostan. All well on board.


Sept. 19th.—Wind ahead, very great swell and much motion in coii&e*
quence. Within 10 miles of the Latitude of the Cape, steering N.E. by E.
Made a small stand for my writing desk and fitted it up near one of the
cabin windows. Eound it answer very well.
At daylight on the morning of the 23rd of September came in sight of
the Cape of Good Hope, the land distant about 30 miles and came to
anchor at noon with the small Bower in Table Bay in 7 fathoms water about
2 miles from the town. Found H.M. ship Charwell, a small Ship with the
Admiral’s flag on board, here; moored ship.
Table Bay is situated in latitude 34° 29' south, longitude 18° 27' east.
The Town is handsome, regular and well built and kept remarkably clean,
the streets wide and airy; it is built at the foot of Table Mountain, with
the Devil’s Mountain on the right, and the Lion’s Head and Rump on the
left; the bay, though spacious, is not safe at all times, one half of the
year blowing with violence from the N.W. into the bay and the other half
from the S.E. out of it. The latter is, of course, the safest, as a ship
can always cut and run out to sea with it. With the other, should a ship
drag her anchor she must go on shore; ships therefore at the commencement
of that season generally go round to Simon’s Bay, about 60 miles to the
Northward, where they can ride in safety. Between the Town and the Table
Mountain are scattered over the plain a number of neat houses surrounded
by plantations and gardens, fruit of all kinds is extremely scarce and the
article of fuel still more so, a single Cart load of it will sometimes sell for
seven dollars, —in most families slaves are kept for the purpose of collecting
firewood; they ascend the Table Mountain in the morning and return in the
evening with two small bundles of faggots, the produce of six or eight
hours, swinging at the end of a bamboo carried across the shoulders. The
Mountain is directly behind the town, is a horizontal line of about 2 miles
in length, and is reckoned to be 3,502 feet above the sea.
Monday, Sept. 25th. —Fresh breezes and cloudy, with a heavy swell into
the Bay; on shore, not able to get off to the ship; dined on shore with Genl.
Wetherall, a very pleasant and agreeable family. The Vice-Admiral hoisted
his flag (blue) on board H.M. ship Hindostan, as the Charwell w r as to sail
the next day with provisions for the Squadron off the Isle of France.
Wednesday, October 4th. —Fresh gales and cloudy, with squalls and
showers of rain; hoisted in the launch, being stove alongside during the
night. Struck lower yards and lower topgallant Masts on deck, braced the
yards to the wind and made all snug; blowing very fresh.
Thursday, sth. —Received 115 live sheep on board for the troops and
sailors, went on shore and took a walk with Mr. Shepperd the gunner, to
the top of Table Mountain. We found it a most fatiguing undertaking
being three hours ascending, the pathway up very steep and rugged.
Overtook one of the slaves going for his daily allowance of firewood and
he undertook to be our guide; this man was accustomed to mount the
hill almost every day and from custom thought nothing of it, while we
were toiling and labouring and obliged to stop every ten or dozen yards
to rest. When we reached the summit we were fully compensated for our


labour by a most delightful prospect of the Country and the Town lying at
our feet. We amused ourselves for a few hours, took a biscuit and a
glass of grog and returned to the ship in the evening quite knocked up
with our walk. We were the only two belonging to the ships that would
venture the journey.
Friday, 13th. —Having completed our watering, etc., weighed and stood
out of the bay, received here a Mr John Thos. Campbell, whom the
Governor had promised to do something for in the country we were going
to. He had the appearance of being a gentlemanly well-informed man —
we remained here twenty-two days.
Sunday, 15th. —A strange sail in sight, sent in chase of her; she appeared
to be a large ship; she hoisted all sail going before the wind; we kept in
chase till after dark, and was nearly out of sight of the Hindostan, and
evidently gained upon the stranger, but the Commodore burning a blue
light, the Captain mistook it for a signal of recall, not being over anxious
I believe to come to close quarters, we gave up the chase and shortened
sail to wait for our consort, who gave our brave Commander a good
rowing for mistaking a blue light, to show us where he was, for a signal
to give up the chase, when a couple of hours more would have made her
our prize. At 10 o’clock the next morning, in consequence of sailing so
much N.W., found ourselves in sight of Table Mountain, and not being
able to double it, tacked and stood to the Southward, fine healthy weather
November 10th.—Calm; made little or no way.
November 11th. —Fine steady breeze and clear weather. From this date
to the end of the month we had in general fine weather with a steady
breeze, with occasional gales of wind. With a moderate wind we could
keep up with the Hindostan with 3 sails only, she having generally 15 or
more set; our carrying so little sail made us labour much more than we
otherwise would have done. The weather evidently getting warmer as we
approached the Coast of New South Wales. Frequently sounded, found no
bottom with a great extent of line.
December 9th. —Light airs. Sent ahead this morning to look out for
land. Governor King’s Island at the mouth of Bass’s Straits at 12 o’clock.
Thick weather; could get no observations. Lay to in the evening till the
Hindostan came up, who spoke us in passing. Found that the current
had carried us twenty miles more to the Eastward than the log gave us.
Sunday, Dec. 10th. —Wind against us all day; both ships lay along-
side each other; the Commodore sent his boat on board for spirits and
other articles that we wanted.
Monday, 11th.—Fine weather and clear, the wind blowing from the very
point we wanted to steer.
Wednesday, 13th. —Thick misty weather all the morning—not able to
see two lengths of the ship. Lost sight of the Commodore about 7 o’clock.
Fired a gun to let him know where we were, supposed by the one returned
in answer that, he was about 2 miles off; at 11 fired another which not
being answered fired another about half an hour after Commodore fired


4 guns and shortly after two more, a signal to bear away two points S.E. In
the evening it cleared up on a sudden and the Commodore was seen upon
our larboard bow about a mile to windward; made the signal to bear up a
point more to the Eastward.
Thursday, 14th.—Fine clear weather with a steady breeze. About 8
o’clock sent ahead to look out for land; saw something like it about 2 p.m.,
but at too great a distance to be certain; a signal of recall was made by
the Commodore, and we lay to till 6 for him. Some large whales seen
about the ship yesterday and to-day. Our latitude was 39° 38' S., long. 80°
27' east. Thermometer was at 50°.
Friday, 15th.—A fine steady breeze and cloudy weather. Sent ahead at
daylight to look out; at 7 hove to and sounded, no bottom with a line
160 fathoms. At i past 10 saw the land bearing nearly ahead, sup-
posed to be the South Point of New Holland. It is impossible to describe
the sensations this sight occasioned to all hands on board after a passage
of seven months from England and nine weeks from the Cape, thus to have
the hopes of a speedy termination to our long voyage in health and safety.
I can venture to say that I believe there was not a sad countenance on
board out of 600 souls, and I trust we all had thankful hearts. Hove to and
sounded, found bottom at 77 fathoms, Coral and sand. The Commodore
passed close alongside and congratulated us on the first sight of our
destination.
December 15th.—-At i past four the Commodore hove to being some
distance astern, and lowered two boats; in about three hours when he had
come up with us, we learnt. the melancholy circumstances of his having
lost one of his best men overboard; the poor fellow had been sent up to
the masthead to look out, where it is supposed he had fallen asleep, and
as he fell from the top the ship must have gone over him, as he was never
seen after; it is serious to think how frequent these accidents happen,
and it is from their frequency I suppose that so little is thought of them.
I know of nothing that could give a more serious cast to the mind of a
thinking being than to see a poor fellow-creature one moment alive and
well and the next launched in eternity with all his imperfections on his
head. May I ever be reminded of these circumstances, when about to
commit a wrong action and reflect upon the consequences.
Friday, 16th at 10 o’clock came in sight of the South West point of Van
Dieman’s Land called de Witt’s Island, the next land we passed was the
Meco Stone, then Pedro Blanco, and the Eddystone, where we could see
the sea break over them in a dreadful surf; the last land in the evening was
St. Adment’s head, the south-easternmost part of Van Dieman’s Land,
and we sailed past it with a fine breeze, and the evening being clear could
easily see the mainland behind. Sounded at 10 o’clock, 77 fathom Coral.
Course E.N.E.; our latitude was 43° 27' S., longitude 148° 40' E.
Thermometer 65°.
December 17th.—Rainy weather—the wind more ahead. Steering North
not far from Cape Pillar, which was discovered when the weather cleared


up, about 5 miles astern. At i past 8 wore ship and stood off from the
land S.E. Stood on till one a.m. this evening. A bird like a dove but
larger flew aboard and a man attempting to lay hold of it, pulled out the
whole of the feathers of the tail and it escaped. Signal to steer north;
going before the wind with a fine breeze.
Wednesday, 20th.—7 o’clock, fresh breezes and cloudy; going about 7
knots under two topsails lowered down on the caps, the Commodore astern
having carried away his topmast and studding-sail boom. Made sail again
at 11 o’clock, fine clear weather the rest of the day. Had one good observa-
tion and found we had made ourselves 46 miles nearer Sydney than by the
observation. Latitude 39° 32' S., longitude 152° 15' E. Thermometer 60°.
Distance from Port Jackson 337 miles.
Thursday, December 21st. —About 10 o’clock saw Cape Howe, N.W.
distant about 25 or 30 miles. Displayed the Colours of the Regiment on
the poop, the band playing God Save the King. Fine clear weather and
steady breezes.
Friday, 22nd. —Calm with clear weather. We evidently find it getting
warmer as we approach the land and have regular land and sea breezes.
Very busy in preparations for landing, issuing Arms, Accoutrements and
Clothing. Got up the awning and sent a boat to the Hindostan with
Clothing, etc. Land in sight all day; passed Cape Dromedary.
Saturday, 23rd. —About 10 o’clock the wind came ahead which obliged
us to stand off and on all day and part of the night, when the wind changed
again in our favour. Much vivid lightning in the evenings but attended
with no thunder.
Sunday, 24th. —At 7 o’clock the weather pleasant and going before a fine
breeze. In the early part of the morning the clouds looked heavy and
threatened rain but it cleared up. At night observed a large fire on shore
distant about 25 miles, the first sign of inhabitants we had seen since our
arrival on the Coast. The breeze increased during the day to fresh gale',
going under topsails at 12 o’clock, 136 miles from Port Jackson.
Monday, 25th. —Fine steady breeze and clear weather, no land in sight.
Paraded at 10 o’clock in Complete Marching order. Found the men in good
order. This being Christmas Day served out an extra allowance of grog
to the Soldiers and Ship’s Company. The Ladies and Gentlemen of the
Cuddy dined with us. Ouz fresh provisions being quite expended for some
time past nothing to give them for dinner but salt beef and pork and part of
an old goat which was killed for the occasion.
Tuesday, 26th.—At 8 o’clock in the morning close in with Botany Bay,
the wind against us. A fine bold shore with high tableland. Fine weather;
stood close in to the shore and wore ship about 12 o’clock—stood off and on
the rest of the day and towards night it grew perfectly calm and very hot
and close thick weather.
Wednesday, 27th. —A fine fair wind which sprung up about one o’clock.
Sailing some distance from the land about 3 knots an hour. Spoke the
Commodore, and sent a boat on board- Mr. Worthington, the 3rd officer.


sent before the mast for insolent and mutinous behaviour to his Commander,
Mr. Cleaveland and Mr. Gray; the Ist and 2nd officers in arrest for the
same crime.
Thursday, 28th Dec. —The wind shifted yesterday evening to all points
of the compass, blowing a hurricane, with very severe thunder and lightning
and heavy rain. Stood off and on all night, sometimes very near the
land. About 7 o’clock in the morning saw the flagstaff at the Head of
Port Jackson; made signal for a pilot. Blowing a fresh gale and at 10
o’clock came to anchor within the Heads. The wind being against we could
not work up the harbour.
Thus have I brought the Journal of our Voyage of seven months and six
days from leaving the Land’s End, and within a few days of a twelve-
month from leaving Scotland, to a conclusion. We remained at the Heads
till the 30th,. the wind being against. On the morning of the 30th it
changed and we weighed and stood up the harbour, and soon after anchored
in Sydney Cove. The Governor landed the next morning with all due
ceremony, the Regiment being drawn up both on board and shore, and
the Ship firing a salute. The next day the Regiment landed, and there not
being room in Barrack for them they marched out to Grose Farm, about
three miles from Town and encamped and remained there till the 102
Regiment embarked for England.

Journal of an excursion over the Blue or Western Mountains of
New South Wales to visit a tract of new discovered country, in
company with his Excellency Governor and Mrs. Macquarie,
and a party of Gentlemen.
Tuesday, April 25, 1815.—This day fixed on by his Excellency
the Governor for commencing his tour over the Blue Mountains to visit
a new tract of country lately discovered, to the westward of them, left
Sydney at half-past 6 o’clock in the morning, in company with Dr. Redfern
(one of the Governor’s suite going with him), and arrived at Parramatta
at half-past 8. The morning cool and pleasant prepared breakfast for the
Governor and Mrs. Macquarie, who arrived in their travelling carriage
about an hour after. Our baggage-carts, five in number, had been sent off
from Sydney some days before, and had been directed to cross the River
Nepean and await our arrival at the Ist depot. After breakfasting and resting
our horses, left Parramatta at 1 o’clock for Mrs. King’s farm, on the South
Creek, in company with Dr. Redfern, Mr. Watts, and Mr. Hassall. We
followed the carriage, and arrived there a little after 3 o’clock, a distance
of 16 miles, a good forest road the whole of the way. Found the kind
hospitality of Mr. Hassall had provided a good dinner for us, which was
served up on our arrival. Mr. Cox, who was to be our guide in our journey,
was waiting for us here, and we sat down to dinner with a good appetite.
On our leaving Sydney in the morning, signal had been made for a ship
being in sight, and before we arose from table an Orderly Dragoon arrived
with despatches from England brought by the Indefatigable, convict
ship. At 9 o’clock retired to rest. There being more guests than a small
farm-house could conveniently accommodate, beds could not be provided
for all; I therefore got the cushions of the carriage, and with my boat
cloak, lay down before a good fire, and slept soundly till morning.
Wednesday, April 26. —Got up at daylight, and as I had not taken off
my clothes, was soon ready to move, which, however, we did not do till 7
o’clock. Sir John Jamieson, who had been invited by the Governor to
make one of his party, had requested we would breakfast at his farm, which
we had promised to do, and arrived there about 8 o’clock, distance of 6
mile's from Mrs. King’s. We found Mr. Secretary Campbell, Mr. Oxley,
Surveyor-General, Mr. Meehan, his deputy, Sir John, and his breakfast
waiting for us. Sir John’s farm being situated on the banks of the Nepean,
the horses and carriage were sent round to the ford while we were at
breakfast, about a mile down the river, where they crossed and came up to
the Government stockyard opposite to Sir John’s, and after allowing them a
sufficient time to rest and take some corn, we all crossed in a boat, and at
11 o’clock started from Emu Plains, proceeding westward and along the
Plain till we came to the third mile tree. The ascent of the first range of
mountains begins here. The country is much like that around Sydney,
but larger and better timbered. About 5£ miles, came to the first depdt


Csfablishfed by Mr, Cox, when making the road, as a place of safety for his
provisions for his working party. A small guard of soldiers ore stationed
here in a good log’ lmt with two rooms, one of which answers as a store. It
is placed about 100 yards on the right of the road, near a small lagoon of
fresh water. The soldiers had enclosed a small piece of ground for a garden,
and one of them had displayed some taste in laying it out in little arbours
and seats formed from the surrounding shrubbery, which gave the place an
appearance of comfort and simplicity. After riding 71 miles further, we
arrived about 0 o’clock at our first encampment, the road tolerably good the
Emu Ford.
whole woy from Emu Ford, mostly a gentle ascent. We found all our
baggage, caravans, and servants safely arrived before us, and drawn up in
regular order to receive us, which they did with three cheers. Our dinner
being ready and a table spread in the open air, we soon sat down to partake
of it, and enjoyed our meal very much. After dinner served out a dram of
rum to every man, which they were to receive every day, and all appeared
happy and contented. After tea, took a short distance in the woods to enjoy
the novelty of the scene around me, and, this being our first encampment, it
may not be amiss to describe our situation. We were encamped in an
extensive forest of large lofty trees mostly of stringy and iron bark. Our
party was formed into different groups, each having a large fire of its own.

the background whore I was. a very beautiful effect, and enabled me to

were smoaking; making their huts, or cutting down timber for fuel, and
reminded me by their various occupations of what I had read of a camp of
gypsies or the birotmes of a. Continental army. I remained here a short
time, and then retired to rest for the night in my hammock, swung between ,
two poles, and covered with a tarpaulin, by the side of a comfortable tire
large enough to roast an ox.
Sprtngwooi.
Thursday, April 'll.-- Aflcr sleeping tolernhl.t well, 1 rose at daylight,
and Ivgmi to net part of the baggagt off, which. however, eon Id not be
effected before !) o'clock, as the bullocks and horses went to be collected
and fed and their drivers to breakfast before they started: the remainder
of the baggage wa~ not off about tin hour after. Before we left the ground,
the Governor and Mrs. .Macquarie and a few more walked down to the
spring l where we had been supplied with water, situated about a mile down
a deep glen. In rainy -easons the water might be had much nearer, as
there appears a watercourse at the hack of the encampment, which extends
down to the spring issuing from a rock, The water is good, but something


of a mineral quality. From this spring and the surrounding forest, the
Governor gave the name of Spring Wood to this station. We did not leave
this place till 12 o’clock, the day cool and pleasant. Our Boad was stony,
and some very severe and short hills for the loaded carts. About 5 miles
further on we came to a very extensive prospect from a lofty spot, where
we found a heap of stones, supposed to have been placed there by an
adventurer, who had penetrated thus far with much difficulty in his
endeavour to cross the mountains. He had arrived at it from a different
direction from the one we had now taken, and much more difficult, but
finding from this place no end to the mountains, and the country looking
most unpromising around him, and his provisions being nearly expended,
he gave up what he thought a fruitless attempt, and retraced his steps,
after erecting this pile of stones, to which the Governor gave the name
of Keely’s* Eepulse. About half a mile on we prepared a bridge
extending from one rock to another across a chasm, which we named Bluff
Bridge, and 8£ miles further brought us to another grand and extensive view
of the country we had left for many miles, from a flat elevated land, which
we named the King’s Tableland. Two miles more brought us to our resting-
place for the night, making the whole distance 16 miles. We came late to
our ground, and some of the carts were not up till long after dark. At this
place is situated the second depot; 28 miles from the ford was made another
station for provisions for the working parties on the road. A good store has
been built here, in which we dined. Very little feeding for the cattle at this
place; only a kind of coarse grass such as generally grows in swamps, but
plenty of excellent water. Found this station a very cold one; during the
night the wind blew across the swamp in our rear, which made the night
uncomfortable, and obliged me to get up frequently to mend our fires.
Friday, April 28. —Eose before daylight; the morning very cold and
threatened rain; but as the sun rose, the clouds and fog cleared away, and
we had a fine morning; breakfasted before we moved and sent off the
baggage. About 4J miles on our road this morning, we emerged on a
sudden from a most dreary waste to a small rising ground on our
left, where one of the grandest views that can be imagined was opened
to our sight. In the foreground was a deep glen, part of which we had
seen yesterday, and around it an immense amphitheatre of lofty
hills crowned with rocks, upon which the sun was shining affording a
variety of tints. In the distance' were lofty mountains as far as the eye
could reach, forming a grand circumference, and background—the whole
coup d’ceil grand beyond the power of my pen to describe; and until now
most likely unseen by the eye of civilised man. Called it Pitt’s Amphi-
theatre. Our party remained here about half an hour admiring the
grandeur and beauty of the scenery, and then moved on, leaving behind us
one of our party who had volunteered his services to accompany us as an
artist, to take a sketch of the noble prospect, and whose pencil, I have no
doubt, will do ample justice to it. On our leaving Sydney this gentlemanf
and myself had made a promise to each other that I was to give him a copy
* Caley’s.
t J. W, Lewin,


of my remarks, and he in return was to let me have a copy of his sketches,
and to him am I indebted for some beautiful views of the interesting
country we were now passing through. This day’s journey was found a
severe* one for the cattle, the road very stony and a number of severe
hills for the loaded carts. Passed one which we called Pulpit Hill, from
a large rock on its summit resembling a pulpit. A little before 2 o’clock
came to our resting-place, 41 miles from Emu Plains and 13 from
our last ground. The country wo passed over this day was the most
barren possible, and abounded with bold romantic scenery, which we opened
occasionally as we wound round the hills. We found here a spring of most
excellent water a little to the right of the road, hut the grass was the
same as yesterday. Altered the plan of my bed, and made a small tent of
the tarpaulin, and slept better than I hud done since I had been out.
Cox's Pass.
Saturday, April 29. —A foggy morning, which cleared off as the sun
rose; a slight shower of rain during the night. The baggage moved off
about eight o’clock, and the rest of the party about an hour after. Two miles
on the road this morning we came to another view of Pitt’s Amphitheatre,
seen to better advantage, in my opinion, than the one of yesterday; the
country around still very barren, and rocky, but little or no feed for
cattle. About 31 o’clock, at the 49-mile tree, we came to the pass down
the mountain into the new country below, which could be seen to great


advantage from the projecting rock on the left just before descending the
pass, and forms a very beautiful and pleasant contrast to the one we had
been travelling over, appearing to be an open forest land with fine grazing.
This pass had been made with great labour down a very steep mountain of
upwards of six hundred feet, and the way the road is made traversing the
face of it makes it nearly a mile long; it was with much difficulty and
exertion we got the carts by fixing drag-ropes behind and holding on
with the people; it was so perpendicular in places that the cattle could
Cox’s River.
scarcely keep their footing. We, however, in about two hours’ hard work,
got them all down in safety, and after allowing the cattle to rest for half
an hour at the foot of the pass, we moved on five miles further through a
plain open forest land to our station on the banks of a small stream, which
the Governor called Cox’s Kiver. The pass was likewise named Cox’s Pass,
in compliment to the gentleman who had superintended making the road
and pass—a piece of work which certainly reflects great credit on his
..exertions and perseverance. The hill itself was called Mount York, a


deep and extensive glen to the left extending several miles to Prince Regent’s
Glen, and the valley which we rode through to Cox’s River the Yale of
Clwydd, through its resemblance to a place of that name in Wales. At the
river where we encamped was plenty of excellent grazing with abundance
of water running over a rocky bed of black granite with a bridge thrown
over it. We arrived at this station a little after 3 o’clock, a good deal
fatigued with our day’s work.
Sunday, April 30. —This being Sunday, it was made a day of rest for
ourselves and cattle —and they indeed required it after the exertion of the
last week. Rose early and took a walk over the hills on the other side of the
river; the morning delightful and the country looking beautiful —gently
rising hills bounded by distant and lofty mountains, clothed with wood and
herbage to their summits. Returned about eight to breakfast, which done,
the people were collected together and Divine service was performed. The
men were attentive and orderly; and thought no doubt with myself how
proper it was thus to acknowledge the blessings we were receiving, and return-
ing thanka for our preservation thus far. After the service was over, some of
the party mounted their horses and took a ride to Mount Rlaxland, and
another gentleman and myself took a sober walk up the river for about two
miles, where we met with a waterfall extending across the river. It was at
this time very low, but in the rainy season must be considerable, the force
of the water having made large excavations in the solid rock —a hard, black
granite. Having collected some seeds and plants along the bed of the river
on the way up, we crossed over at the fall, and returned to the camp by
a shorter route, very well pleased with our walk. The day was fine, but
warm.
Monday, May 1. —Rose before daylight, and, having shortly after called
the Governor, prepared to send off part of the baggage, which I did about
seven o’clock, breakfasted and sent off the remainder of the carts, and set
off ourselves a little after eight. This day proved the most fatiguing and
trying for the cattle of any we had yet experienced. The road lay over a
succession of steep hills for nearly sixteen miles. One hill in particular
about 3 miles on the road was very steep and obliged us, after one cart
was up, to send back the horses to help up the other, two carts remaining
together to help each other, which they were constantly obliged to do the
whole of the way —the Governor denominated these hills “ Clarence’s Hilly
Range.” We met with very little good soil on them, but the pasture was
tolerable, and plenty of water supplied from little streams running from
the hills. About 2 miles from our encampment passed Mount Blaxland,
and a little further on Wentworth’s and Lawson’s Sugar Loaves. These
hills had been named after three gentlemen who had been the first to
penetrate thus far, after much labour and fatigue, and had been the first
discoverers of a passage over and down the mountains, but, their provisions
being nearly expended, they were obliged to return. We afterwards passed
Evans’ Peak, a very remarkable hill, with a round rock crowning its
summit, and had been named by and after the Deputy Surveyor-General, who


had "been -sent by the Governor after the return of the three other gentlemen
to make further discoveries. All this range is clothed with thick timber,
and has good feeding for cattle. We arrived at our night’s station on the
banks of a small river, called the Fish River, about 4 o’clock, much fatigued
with our day’s march —especially the cattle. The Fish River is now a small
stream running_through a valley, but, like the others we had passed, must be
'Considerable when swoln by the rains, which was the case when Mr. Evans
Evan’s Peak.
first passed it. Two men who had been stationed here had caught a fine
fish, which we had dressed for dinner, and one of our party got a few more
smaller ones all of the same kind. They were excellent eating, something
resembling cod, and were peculiar to the rivers in this part of the country.
The feed for the cattle at this station is good and plentiful along the banks
of the river, with plenty of good water.
Tuesday, May 2. —Started this morning at 10 o’clock, after taking a
comfortable breakfast. We did not move off as early as usual, as we
intended to make but a short march of seven miles to a place called
Sydmouth Valley. The first mile of our road was up a considerable ascent,
Tvhen we got to the top of a very high hill, and from it had an extensive


view of the hills around us and the river we had left beneath. Evans’ Peak
bearing due north. From this spot Mrs. Macquarie and Mr. Lewin took
sketches of it. We appeared to be completely surrounded and hemmed in
by a range of hills. The country from Cox’s River abounds with red and
black granite, which is not found on the other side of the mountains, and
the whole aspect of the country appeared as if it had undergone some great
convulsion of nature, hills heaped upon hills and rocks upon rocks, with
Sydmouth Valley.
deep gullies between, some with streams running through them, and all
clothed with wood to their very summits, forming altogether the most wild,
but at the same time the most romantic country I had ever seen. It
seemed, however, well calculated to give those passing through it a good
appetite—at least, it had this effect upon us, as we were always ready for our
dinnersi as soon as the day’s march was ended, and our early breakfast at
six o’clock in the morning was always welcome. Our encampment this day
was picturesque and beautiful, situated in a valley with a chain of ponds
running through it, a high hill bounding each extremity, and very good
grass and water for our cattle. After passing the first three or four miles
we seemed to be leaving the hilly country behind us, and to be fast


descending into a more open one. A duck was shot on our arrival in one
of the ponds, which appeared so tame as almost to be taken with the hand,
and unconscious of the danger that threatened him. An hour and a half
brought us from our last ground, where we had left one of our party
fishing. He had a guide with him, and was to walk down the river and
join us by dinner-time. We waited an hour for him, and as he did not
then arrive, we sat down without him; but when it grew dark and he had
not arrived, we began to be fearful he had lost his way. We made some
fires on the hills and fired a few shots which he fortunately heard just as
he had given up all hopes of finding us, and was making up his mind to
collect wood to make a fire and remain stationary for the night. Directed
by the report of our guns, he soon found his way to the camp, was not
sorry to exchange the prospects of a hard bed on the cold ground for his
own caravan and a good dinner. He brought with him a good string
of fish, which served us for our breakfast the next morning. One of the
men we sent out to look for “ the lost sheep ” killed and brought in a
native dog.
Wednesday, May 3. —The morning foggy. Hose at daylight and sent
off part of the baggage. One of the carts not yet come up but which
arrived just before we left our ground. It remained at the station to follow
us to-morrow, after taking out of it some things that we wanted. After
keeping the road this morning for six miles, we struck off to the right due
north, the Governor leaving the carriage to pursue the road, and mounting
his horse; and about two miles we made the first river, riding along which
for a short distance we came to an extensive plain, called by Mr. Evans,
who first discovered it, O’Connell Plains, in honour of the commanding
officer of the 73rd Regiment; a considerable tract of land without a tree, fit
for both pasture and cultivation. Continuing along the banks of the river
about two miles, we came to another extensive plain called Macquarie
Plains after our worthy Governor. This is the most extensive of the two, and
equally good for pasture and cultivation. Riding along this plain for two miles
we made the junction of the two rivers—the one we had been riding along
and the Campbell River; these two then form the Macquarie, which takes a
westerly direction, but does not appear from this place, after receiving
the waters of the other two, to be larger than either. We then proceeded
up the bank of the Campbell River for about 3 miles, upon the banks
of which we were to encamp near a bridge made over it, and arrived there
in about half an hour, where we found our baggage before us. The face
of the country we rode over this day, after quitting the road, was beautiful
and open, large tracts of land, without timber or underwood, and in the
spring when grass is green, must be delightful. At present we saw it to
a great disadvantage, the greatest part of the herbage of the plains having
been destroyed by fire, which gave them a barren and desolate appearance.
The grass, however, at the place of our encampment had escaped, and we
found abundance for our purpose. A little fatigued with our ride, owing
more to the heat of the weather than the length of the road, it being the


warmest day we had experienced since our departure from home. The dis-
tance was only 13 miles, and two miles more by the round road we had
taken.
Campbell River.
Thursday, May 4. —Rose this morning just as the day began to dawn.
After dressing took a walk along the rising ground behind the camp to
contemplate the beauties of the surrounding' country, and hail the rising
sun. The fog continued in the valley I had quitted, and here and there a
hill was seen peeping through it, appearing like so many islands and a long
line of coast forming a deep and beautiful bay, the fog having the
resemblance of water. This day was to be our last march to arrive at the
grand depot and Bathurst Plains. The baggage was sent off, and at eight
o’clock, crossing the bridge over the Campbell River, the Governor and some
others of the party set off on horseback to visit another plain called
Mitchell Plain, which did not lie in our route. I remained behind to see
the rest of the baggage off. We saw three kangaroos yesterday, but having
no dogs near, could not come up with them. hTo emues were to be seen,
though we were told there were plenty of them. I suppose the burning of
the grass had driven them away to seek for food elsewhere. The Governor
and his party overtook me on the road, and a little after, about 7 miles,


we descended the hills, to an extensive plain, which, in honour of the
Minister for the Colonies, was called Bathurst Plains, being the most
extensive of any we had yet seen, of many miles in length, with the
Macquarie running through it, upon the banks of which the Grand Depot
is situated. Mr. Evans, the Deputy A-M-tant Surveyor-General, met us
as soon as we descended into the plain. He had hi on MUit over fiom Van
Diemen’s Land to attend the Governor, as lie had already explored this part
of the country, and had been sent forward a second time to make further
discoveries, and was now returned but a day or two to Bathurst before our
Bathurst Plains.
arrival, and reported that he had endeavoured to trace the river, but found
that it was not navigable for any distance. He had met with a very broken
and fine grazing country to the south-west for fifty miles, and fit for every
purpose of cultivation. On our approach within half a mile of the settle-
ment, the Governor and Mrs. Macquarie got out of their carriage, and
mounted their saddle horses, and the remainder of the party, which had
straggled behind, coming up, we drew up into line, twelve in number, and
advanced in this order towards the huts, situated on a little rising ground
on the banks of the river. We were received by the party stationed here
with presented arms and three cheers, and, to add to our satisfaction, we


discovered several of the natives of this new country among them, who
were made spectators of the novel sight. At first they appeared very much
astonished at us, and not a little alarmed at our reception, but in a short
time by kind treatment, they became more reconciled to us, and seemed to
cast off all fear. Our people received strict injunctions to treat them kindly,
to put no restraints upon their movements, but to let them come and go
when they thought proper. They had jiothing with them but a couple of
rude spears, which they threw down near one of the huts, and seemed perfectly
careless about them. One old man was blind of an eye, which the people
stationed here said was frequently the case both with men and women;
but this man and an old woman, we one day met in the woods, were the
only instances we saw of the kind during our stay. They resembled the
natives about Sydney, but did not speak the same language; they ap-
peared, however, to be one degree more advanced towards civilisation than
our old friends, possessing some art in manufacturing themselves cloaks of
skin, very neatly sewed together by the sinews of the kangaroo and emue,
and carved on the inside with a variety of figures. These cloaks were for
the sole purpose of keeping themselves warm, and not out of any regard
for decency, for in the middle of the day, when the weather was warm they
threw them carelessly over their shoulders. What little I saw of them
during our stay, they appeared to be a harmless and inoffensive race, with
nothing forbidding or ferocious in their countenances. On the contrary,
they are perfectly mild and cheerful, and laugh at everything they see and
repeat everything they hear. As I had sent on a man the day before to pitch
one of the tents for the Governor, we found it ready for us, but we pre-
ferred dining in the store, which was very neatly made and well thatched.
Triday, May s.—After breakfast was over, the Governor and the rest
of the party set off to visit some of the country on the other side of the
river, crossing at a ford a little below the huts. I remained at home to see
the tents pitched and the things put in order, as we proposed staying here
a week; employed at this the whole of the day till dinner-time. The spot
which was chosen for the Governor’s large tent was upon a little rising
ground about three hundred yards from the men’s huts; a small tent was
placed on each side with a clear space in front upon which a small flagstaff
was erected. This wa3 a delightful spot for a town, commanding a view
of the surrounding country for a considerable extent; the soil excellent,
fitted for every purpose of cultivation, with abundance of good water near
at hand, but the wood is scarce, being obliged to send upwards of a mile
for it. A native dog was killed as I was pitching the tents, by our dogs.
These animals fight very fiercely; the natives domesticate them, and make
use of them in hunting their game, the kangaroo and the emue, and in their
tame state (when accompanied by their masters) often get the better of
our dogs. They very much resemble the fox, and seem to be a bread between
that and the wolf; but as none of these animals are found in the country,
it is difficult to say how these dogs have become inmates of it.
Saturday, May 6.—After breakfast this morning, mounted our horses
and rode through the country for a few miles to the northward to a small


stream running through a pretty little valley, which we called Winburndale,
giving the creek the same name. The ground we rode over was good, both
for grazing and cultivation, plentifully watered, and very thinly wooded;
gave chase to some kangaroos, and killed a small one with the dogs; the
ground bad to gallop over, being full of holes and tufts of grass. Yesterday
a black swan was shot and brought into the camp, weighing ten lbs; it was
the largest one of the kind I had ever seen, measuring six ft. 2 inches from
the tip of each wing, and was four ft. three inches long, including the neck,
which was two ft.; there was another with him at the time he was shot,
which was afterwards seen flying over the camp, and I heard him again
crying for his mate. They seem to show great feeling, and seldom live long
after losing their companions. A gentleman at Sydney had a couple of these
birds. One of them died, and being skinned by his servants, the skin was
put in the garden to dry; the other found out the remains of his companion,
and laid down beside it, where it remained without moving, refusing all
sustenance, and in a day or two was found dead stretched out on the skin.
We had another visit from the natives this day, who came in with the
utmost confidence, and slept in the camp, getting as close to the fire as they
could without burning. The nights were very cold, and the mornings foggy,
and they seemed to feel the cold very acutely. They came into the tents while
we were dressing, without any ceremony, but seemed, after the first surprise
at the novelty of the surrounding objects, to be totally devoid of curiosity.
They took everything that was offered them, but asked for nothing. If
you put a question to them, or held up anything to find out its name in
their language, they only repeated the words you made use of, following,
however, very accurately the sound. One word they soon learned and
seemed to understand, “ Good-bye,” which they repeated at night when
they quitted the tents.
Sunday, May 7. —A thick foggy morning, which soon cleared away as
the sun got a little power. A little after breakfast, assembled the whole of
our inhabitants, civic, naval and military, 75 in number, and drawing
them up in line, in front of the large tent, the British flag was dis-
played for the first time in this new country, the troops saluting it with
three vollies, and the rest giving three cheers. The Governor then delivered
a short speech to Mr. Cox and Mr. Evans as having through their exertions
been brought to so fine a country, thanking the latter for having explored
it with so much perseverance and success, and the former for having with
considerable labour made so good a road for upwards of a hundred miles
in so short a time and so difficult to perform. He then named the place
and new town to be marked out, “ Bathurst,” and each drank a bumper,
some in wine, and the rest in rum, to the King’s health, and success to the
town of Bathurst —an era in my life, which at some future day I hope I
shall look back to with pleasure and satisfaction. We then adjourned to
the Governor’s marquee, where Divine service was performed, a suitable
ceremony at the close of so interesting a one we had just been witness to.
’Tis pleasing to look forward and think that perhaps at some future period
not far distant, a flourishing town may arise on the very spot we are now


occupying on the banks of the Macquarie River, which may hand down
the name of our worthy Governor with honour to posterity, as its founder;
and where Divine service has now been performed to the great Dispenser
of events, some future church may be erected to His name and worship.
The men were orderly and attentive and the day was spent with cheerful-
ness, and good humour, and was closed by giving the men another dram.
Monday, May B.—Rose this the dawn of day, and having
called the rest of the party, prepared breakfast, it being intended to start
early to visit a part of the country lately discovered by Mr. Evans, to the
south-west. As I did not ride out this day, I employed myself in preparing
and sending off one of the carts loaded with the heaviest of the baggage.
A mild, pleasant day. The Governor returned from his ride about 3 o’clock,
having gone about 50 miles through a fine grazing country, and was much
pleased with his ride.
Tuesday, May 0. —Intending to ride this day to a place called Pine Hill
about 15 miles off, rose early, and having breakfasted, set off imme-
diately after, going to the westward —a pleasant morning, little or no fog.
After riding five miles through an open country, to a hill called Mount
Pleasant where we left Mrs. Macquarie and the carriage, we proceeded
10 or 12 miles to Pine Hill, so called from the quantity of pines of a
peculiar kind growing on and around it. The country we passed through
was very well watered and fit for cultivation, and we made a circuit and
returned to Mount Pleasant, which we ascended, and found a fine tableland
on the top about half a mile long, and a good rich light soil, but covered
with a great quantity of loose stones of a peculiar kind not seen in any
other part of the country we had visited. And what was still more remark-
able, a number of them were thrown into heaps, as if placed there by the
hands of men. Supposing something might be placed under them we had
one or two taken to pieces, but found nothing but the same kind of stone
on the surface, of a solid and hard bed which we could not penetrate. We
had from this hill a beautiful and extensive prospect of the river, and
Bathurst Plains, and after staying about half an hour descended the mount,
and having regained the carriage, returned to Bathurst very well pleased
with the day’s ride.
Wednesday, May 10. —A very thick foggy morning, which did not clear
away till late. We made this a resting day for our horses, and I took
a walk up the river about 4 miles to try for some fish. Could not get
a bite; crossed over the river and returned to the camp, where I found
some of the natives who had arrived during my absence, and shortly after
my return, some more came in. There were three men, and a number of
fine lads, but no women, nor had we seen one since our arrival, except the
old lady we met in the woods. They submitted very quietly to have their
hair cut, and we clothed them with some shirts and jackets and trousers,
and gave each a leather cap, and a tommyhawk; the latter present appeared
to please them most. To one of the best-looking men of the party the
Governor gave a piece of yellow cloth in exchange for his skin cloak. They


stayed with us the whole of the day, and left us in the evening to return:
to their encampment over the hills, but did not seem to wish us to follow
them, which we did not attempt to do.
Thursday, May 11. —This morning was likewise very foggy, which the
sun had not power to clear away till nearly ten o’clock. This being the day
we were to commence our journey back, sent off some of the carts at 9
o’clock. And after breakfast, when most of the baggage was ready, and the
saddle-horses standing around the carts, those men who it was intended
should remain behind, were assembled before the Governor when he exhorted
them to conduct themselves peaceably towards the natives, to treat them
kindly whenever they met with them, and endeavour to keep the friendly
intercourse which then subsisted; which the men promised to do and in
testimony of their thanks for the kind treatment they had received, and their
acquiescence in the order, they gave three cheers, when immediately, as with
one consent, away started all the carts, and some of the saddle-horses, going
off in different ways full gallop. In a moment all was confusion and
dismay, expecting every instant to see the carts overturned and everything
in them dashed to pieces. Fortunately however, they were all stopped
without sustaining much damage. Two caravans belonging to the gentle-
men were upset, and the shaft of one broken. We soon collected our
scattered forces together, and moved off, bidding adieu to Bathurst and
its inhabitants, not without a feeling of regret and sincere wishes that the
town we had established might flourish and become a thriving settlement.
We marched ten miles, and arrived at our former Station at the Campbell
River, in 2 hours and encamped on the same spot. We found this day
one of the warmest we had experienced. Our road was very good, mostly
on the descent. On our arrival at our ground we found most of the grass
burned up, owing I suppose, to the fires we had left behind us. It had not,
fortunately, spread to any distance, and we found quite enough for our
horses. One emue was killed yesterday and we had.some of it cooked for
breakfast this morning. It was very good eating, tasting like beef, a little
dry and tough; it weighed eighty-six lbs., and was a very large bird.
Friday, May 12. —Got up this morning an hour before day; could not
sleep, the night very cold. After breakfast moved off, and at 12 arrived
at Sydmouth Yalley, halted there for about an hour to give the horses
a mouthful of grass and a little water, and then moved on seven miles
further to the Fish River, and encamped near our old station; distance
20 miles. On mustering our followers yesterday evening we found one man
missing. He had come with us with the idea of becoming a settler in the
new country, and as we suppose, he had remained behind at Bathurst, a man
was this morning sent back for him, he returned in the evening and
reported the last time the poor fellow was seen was with some of the natives.
He had been at Bathurst the morning we left, and being a little in liquor,
had insisted upon going with them to their camp, where it was supposed
from his own imprudence he had fallen a sacrifice, as no trace could be
found of him by the parties which had been sent out; and the natives with


whom he had gone away, had not since been seen. I am told he has left
a wife and four children to lament his loss, which likewise threw a damp
upon all our spirits, and considerably diminished the pleasure of our
journey back.
Saturday, May 13. —Eose this morning before daylight, called up the'
servants in order that they might get their breakfast before us, and sent
off the baggage early. This was a very fatiguing march, retracing Clarence’s
Hilly Eange. Went on ahead to Cox’s Pass, and got out some wine from
one of the carts, which had been sent on in front, and on returning to Cox’s
Eiver, found the tent pitched and dinner ready.
Sunday, May 14. —Up this morning a little before daylight to enjoy a
most delightful morning. After breakfast assembled the people together
and had Divine service performed, no sermon was read, as it was late
before we began, and the gentlemen were impatient to ride out.. When this
duty was over the people began to pack up two of the carts, and they were
sent off up the Pass to ascend the mountain, which was what I did not
approve of, as there was no immediate occasion for doing so. Took a walk
up the river, and remained absent till near dinner-time. We had a very
mild night, but a high wind made it unpleasant, coming down the vallies
in gusts, and driving the smoke about in all directions.
Monday, May 15.—Eose early this morning, and sent off what re-
mained of the baggage to the Pass, intending to breakfast there before we-
ascended. Arrived there at 9 o’clock, found most of the carts had got
up safe, but with much labour and difficulty. During our breakfast, the-
carriage was taken up and by 12 o’clock, we were all safe at the top without
any accident whatever, which was more than I expected. After arriving:
at the top, I walked on for a few miles, when a very thick fog came on,,
which at first I took for the smoke of a large fire in the woods, it continued
so for the remainder of the day, and obliged us to dine in the tent. Our
march this day was six miles, to the foot of the Pass; one up, and eight more
to our ground. The fog continued the whole of the night, and the weather
was much milder than we had found it for some nights past. Prom the
appearance of this Station, it being a kind of heath, but a very wild and
dreary scenery, the Governor gave it the name of Blackheath, though to my
eye, very unlike its namesake.
Tuesday, May 16.—Breakfasted early, and got all the baggage off before
nine, the morning was foggy, but the sun soon cleared it away, and having
a tolerably good ride this day, we got to our ground at the second depot by
1 o’clock. The Governor changed the name of this station to Jamieson’s
Valley, in compliment to Sir John Jamieson who was one of our party.
The night proved very cold, the wind blowing from the same quarter as it.
did when we were last here, but with greater violence.
Wednesday, May 1Y. —As this was to be a tedious march of 16 miles,
rose early, and after breakfasting, sent off the baggage. We did not, how-
ever, find the road so difficult returning for although it was rocky, it was
mostly down hill, the carts, therefore, arrived at Spring Wood in very gocd


time. Lent my horse to one of the servants as I was inclined to walk,
turned off the road at the King’s Tableland, and went down to visit a
waterfall. The height of the fall was great, but there being very little
water, the stream was very inconsiderable. The whole of the tableland next
to the chasm appeared as if it had undergone a violent volcanic eruption,
the stones seemed to have been in a state of fusion, forming all manner of
shapes, and having the resemblance of molted sand and even ironstone, and
the place altogether formed a wild and picturesque scene of nature. I remained
here with most of the party for nearly three hours, and then returned to
Jamieson's Valley.
the road and pursued my walk to the cam]), where I arrived at ■ ! o’clock.
I partook of a good dinner and went early to bed. As this was (lie last night
of our being together, served out an extra allowance of grog to the men, and
had some very good songs from them, and all around us appeared contented
and happy.
Thursday, May 18. — Eose this morning at the usual hour of daylight,
and having breakfasted, started from our ground at Spring Wood at 10
o’clock, our road was descent the whole of the way to the i'ord, 12 miles,
where we arrived in two hours, and after crossing the Nepean, our party
began to separate, Sir John Jamieson, Mr. Oxley, and Mr. Cox going to


their farms, and Mr. Campbell to follow us to Sydney. The rest of the
party went on with us to Mrs. King’s farm, where we were met by Mr.
Hassall, who provided a dinner for us on our return. In thus taking leave
of the friends who had accompanied us on our expedition, I cannot help
mentioning with satisfaction, the unanimity and good understanding which
subsisted between every individual composing our small society. Not a
word of ill-humour passed the whole time; on the contrary everyone ap-
peared to use hi 3 endeavour to make the time pass as pleasantly as possible.
As I was resolved not to indulge in the luxury of a bed till I arrived home,
I wrapped myself up in my boat cloak, and notwithstanding the hardness
of the boards, slept very well till morning.
Friday, May 19. —As this was to be our last stage, set off at seven o’clock
from Mrs. King’s farm in company with Mr. Hassall, and after a pleasant
ride of sixteen miles, arrived at Parramatta, where we breakfasted, and
resting our horses till 11 o’clock, returned to Sydney, after an absence of
twenty-four days. We had the happiness to find all well at home, and I
hope were grateful for the protection which had been afforded us on our
journey, no accidents having occurred the whole of the way but the loss
of a few horses, and the loss of the poor fellow at Bathurst.
