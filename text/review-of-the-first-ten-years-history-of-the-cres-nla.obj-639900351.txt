REVIEW
OF THE FIRST TEN YEARS' HISTORY OF THE
Creswick Branch, No. 3, A.M.A. Of Sustralasia,
BY W. G. SPENCE, SECRETARY.
To the Members.—
Gentlemen, —Having completed our first decade of ten years’life as an
organisation, it may be interesting to look back over the past and briefly
review the rise and progress of the branch, noting such incidents as are
indicative of the spirit of the members at the time, the immense benefit
derived by members and the community generally, together with the
general improvement in the position of the working-miner.
Like many other branches this Association was called into existence
to resist a reduction of wages. On the first discovery of gold at Spring
Hill, very fair wages were paid. However, when the Ballarat influence
controlled some of the mines, wages were brought down to Ballarat rates,
viz., two guineas per week. For some time the two rates of 7s and 7s 6d
per shift were paid, the higher rate ruling in the mines managed by local
directors,the Ballarat mines paying Ballarat rates. When Bunyan’s Freehold
was in operation, and were working on a somewhat poor gutter, the
wages were cut down to 7s per shift. An attempt was made at this time
to establish a Miners’ Association, but it did not succeed, as men were led
away by the statement that unless they agreed to a reduction the ground
would not be worked, and they would be thrown out of employment. The
reduction was accepted with an undercurrent of grumbling, and soon two
guineas per week was the rate ruling in all the mines. In 1878 a second
attempt to reduce the miners’ wage was made, as the condition of mining
prospects was considered favourable to its acceptance by the men. The
Ristori Company were just beginning to open up in wash, and was the
leading mine on the one lead, whereas Dyke’s Freehold was in a similar
position on the other. The next mine (except Ryan’s Junction) to Dyke’s,
Cameron’s Freehold, was almost worked out. The plan was well conceived,
as it was thought that the men in the latter would not resist, seeing that
they had but a few week’s work before the mine finished, and the promise
of a long job in Dyke’s was expected to tempt the men in that mine to
accept rather than strike. Only one miner was employed on wages in the
Ristori, the other men being on contract with the hopes of long and steady
employment. Ryan’s Junction was not interfered with, and the directors
informed the workmen that they had no intention of reducing the rate. In
July, 1878, notice was given to the men employed in Cameron’s and Dyke’s
Companies’ mines that on the following fortnight wages would be reduced
to 6s 8d per shift, or two pounds per week. Some excitement ensued in
consequence, and Cameron’s men being careless as to whether they lost


their employment or not, determined upon opposing the reduction,
particularly as one mineowner was reported to have said that wages would
be further reduced to 6s per shift. An active interest was also manifested by
the Ryan’s Junction men and a few in the De Mur ska. A meeting was
called for Thursday, 11th July, 1878, and was held in Mr. Dibdin’s
Speculation hotel, then in the corner of the Baron paddock, at the head of
Broomfield Gully. The meeting was largely attended by the men directly
concerned, and every man on the day shift in Ryan’s Junction mine except
two were present, and one of their number, your present Secretary, was
voted to the chair, Mr. T. J. Dibdin acting as secretary. The chairman
suggested that a strong protest should be entered against the proposed
reduction, and that miners in other districts should be warned by
advertisement that a strike was pending—one shilling per man
to be subscribed to defray expenses. These proposals were
adopted,, and it was further resolved that a union be established.
The chairman was appointed secretary, a position he has since retained,
Mr. Dibdin treasurer, and a committee consisting of one man from each
shift in mines where men took an interest in the movement and would
elect one to represent them. Every man enrolled, and several volunteers
from the shifts in the various mines agreed to lay the matter before their
mates and secure their co-operation. A meeting of the committee was
held at the close, and it was decided that a public meeting
should be held in Creswick on Saturday, the 13th July. The Secretary
was instructed to visit Clunes the following day, with a view of securing
speakers in the persons of the officers of the Clunes Miners’ Association.
A meeting of committee was held on the 12th in same place, and the
question of who was to take the chair presented a difficulty. Messrs. J.
Sampson and E. Alexander were named as likely men, and it was decided
to. ask them. Two members of committee went to the Kingston Park
mine, where Mr. J. Sampson was at work on night shift, and another
agreed to call upon Mr. E. Alexander. A very large meeting was held in the
Temperance Hall, Creswicx; Mr. Sampson in the chair. Addresses were
given by Messrs. Taylor and VVheary, President and Vice-President
respectively of the Clunes branch. The meeting was an enthusiastic one,
and resolutions were passed that the miners of the district bind themselves
together to oppose the reduction of wages. Subsequently a sub-committee
was appointed to draft bye-laws. Three members only, however, including
the secretary, met, and the rules drafted by them were the first adopted
by Victorian miners, which included the principle of an Accident Fund
together with that of a Trades’ Union. It was found to work so
satisfactorily that it was afterwards made compulsory on all branches of
the A.M. A.
. The first general meeting of the branch was held on the 29th July, at
which the rules were adopted, and following officers elected :—President,
Mr. John Sampson; vice-president, Mr. Edward Alexander; treasurer,
Mr. Joseph Moore; secretary, Mr. W. G. Spence ; trustees, Messrs. R.
Falla, J. T. Lennon, and Geo. W. Thompson. At this meeting it was
reported that fresh tenders for driving had been let at the Ristori mine,
and the new hands would start on the 31st July. As the drives had only
been let a fortnight previously, and the men had not made wages, it was
resolved that the president and members visit the mine on the 31st, and
endeavor to induce the new contractors to give up their contracts, and the
Association would pay their expenses back to Ballarat. The action taken
at that time was the first step towards doing away with the evils of the
contract system. At this meeting two resolutions of great importance
were carried, of which the following are copies:—
“ That we, as members of the Association, pledge ourselves to stand
man to man and resist the proposed introduction of Chinese labor in this
district.”


“That a petition be sent to the Minister of Mines protesting against
the employment of any Chinese labor in mines to which any portion of the
Prospecting Vote has been granted, and also that a proviso be inserted in
all mining leases prohibiting any company from employing Chinese labor
in connection with such leases. ”
The necessity for the first resolution was because of the fact that
Cameron’s Company were making efforts to let the mine on tribute to a party
of Chinese. Strong feeling was manifested against the introduction of the
Mongolians into the mines, a “boss John” being on one occasion driven
back by some women in Broomfield whilst on his way to inspect the mine.
Owing to the strong feeling and the action of your secretary, who had
notices written in Chinese explaining the position of affairs, the directors
were unsuccessful in letting the mine, and gave way on the wages question.
An exciting event occurred at the Ristori mine on Wednesday, 31st July,
two days after our first general meeting. It was not anticipated that there
would be any difficulty in getting the new men to give up their contracts,
which had been taken at ridiculously low rates. Nevertheless, it was
understood that as many as possible should attend and support the president
in endeavouring to induce the contractors to leave. The president,
however, would have been left to fight the battle almost single-handed but
for the action of the company who, fearing disturbance, had invited the
attendance of the police, two members of the force putting in an
appearance. This did good in the following way—Between 7 and 8
o’clock in the morning, the workmen in Ryan’s Junction mine were about
getting ready for underground when one of their number, Mr. Thomas
Ryan, rushed into the changing house in an excited state and announced
that the “ Troopers had gone to the Ristori to force the men down ! ”
adding “ It’s now or never boys, we must stop them ! ” A moment’s parley
decided that if Dyke’s men would go, Ryan’s were prepared to rush to the
Ristori to stop the mine. Away went Ryan, and he was watched entering
the “shanty,” or changing room at Dyke’s. Opposition was manifested
by two in particular in that room, but Ryan was soon seen, followed by
Messrs. E. Russell and John Reed, who were the first to volunteer; the
other men followed, and soon the workmen of the day shift in each mine were
off to see what was meant by the presence of the police. Amongst the foremost
leaving Ryan’s Junction were Messrs. W. Pavarno, B. Toohey, and your
secretary. A smart run of a mile or over brought them to the Ristori
shaft, where President Sampson was parleying with the mining mananger,
the new men who had caused the trouble standing ready to go below. The
troopers were standing at the blacksmith’s shop, and had just been asked
to arrest the president, and had pointed out that they could not, and that
he could only be summoned for trespass, when the body of men came.
Within a few minutes after 8 o’clock several hundred men were on the
ground, the mine was stopped, and the men who were to have been
displaced by the new contractors were put on strike and picketed to watch
the mine. About 10 a.m. the day shifts at Ryan’s Junction and Dyke’s
Freehold returned and went below, the managers with commendable tact
being out of sight, and thus a disturbance was avoided. The Ristori strike
only lasted a week, as on the sth of August the directors decided to concede
the terms asked by the Association. In the meantime, steps had been
taken to maintain the 7s per shift rate in Dyke’s Freehold. A letter was sent
by the workmen, at the instance of the Association, to the directors, giving
reasons why the wages should not be reduced and requesting them to
re-consider their decision. A reply was received, that owing to there not
being a full board meeting the consideration of the question was postponed,
and in the meantime the old rate would be paid. It is needless to say
that the question remains in that position. On the sth August a
monster meeting in connection with the inauguration of the Association
was held in the Town Hall, addressed by the then President of the A.M. A,,


the late Hon. R. Clark, M.L.A., the members for the district and others.
The wage rate had then been gained, and the meeting was one never to be
forgotten, owing to the enthusiasm displayed in consequence of the
settlement of the strike &c. The A.M.A. at this time was at a very low
ebb, there being only 4 branches and less than 300 members. Creswick
joined as a branch, with 600 members, in September, 1878, and therefore
infused new life into the organisation. Creswick afterwards sent officers
to assist at the opening of Ballarat, Egerton, and Waterloo branches.
Ballarat in turn opened Haddon and Buninyong ; hence good work was
done in helping others.
Previous to the opening of the branch there were five accident funds
in operation, in connection with Dyke’s Freehold, Ryan’s Junction, De
Murska, Cameron’s, and Kingston Park mines respectively. In the
face of considerable opposition from some of the official holders of these
funds they finally handed over to the Association, which thus had a
sum of £145 to start with, provision being made that such sum should only
be used for payment of accident benefits.
( _ About this time the Seamen’s Union in N.S.W. were fighting against
Chinese labor, and £25 was sent to help them, a committee being also
appointed to canvass for donations, and secretary instructed to stir up the
societies in Ballarat to assist also. In December, 1878, action was taken to
stop Sunday work, and the evil was effectually checked. In January, 1879,
the land held by the New Australasian Co. was gazetted for sale, and at
the half-yearly meeting on the 25th of that month action was decided upon
with a view to stop the alienation of the 500 acres held by them and which
was originally a portion of borough common. A strong protest was sent
to the Minister of Mines on the 28th, and within three days a reply was
received to the effect that the land would be withdrawn from sale. The
resolution carried at the first meeting of the branch re Chinese was
followed up by securing the co-operation of the other branches, and
petitions were followed by a deputation, which waited upon the Hon.
Major W. C. Smith, at Ballarat, on the 9th August, 1879. Major Smith
was then Minister of Mines, and he promised to grant the request of the
deputation, that a clause should be inserted in all leases issued to
Europeans, prohibiting the employment of Chinese ; this promise he carried
out, and miners were thus placed in a better position than other workers
in regard to competition with Chinese. Of numberless questions dealt
with about this period were the following:—The hours of starting work on
Sunday night, which in some cases had been 12 midnight, was changed at
our request to 1 a.m., and on Saturday the hours were reduced by knocking
off work at 10 instead of 11 p.m. In October, 1879, a rise of wages was
secured for the bracemen in the Lone Hand, and the machinemen in the
Australasian mines.
About this time the attempt was made to reduce miners’ wages in
Bendigo, and £SO was immediately sent to assist them in holding out
against the reduction, and a levy of 2s per member also made and
forwarded, which made the amount up to £lO2. In November, 1880, an
increase of wages was secured for the enginedrivers at the Loughlin mine,
after their having made a stand for the rise from 7s to 7s 6d per shift. On
December 4 same year, the bracemen at the same mine had stood out for
an increase at the instance of the Association, and, owing to their being
afterwards discharged, a strike would have taken place but for the directors
agreeing to arbitration. Latter took place and resulted in their reinstate-
ment. On December 11, 1880, the Secretary reported that the rate of 7s
6d per shift had been gained for all the drivers except those in the Home
Paddock and Spring Hill Freehold, also that the machine men in Lone
Hand had secured an increase. During same month a strike took place at
the Spring Hill Freehold in support of the president, Mr. J. Sampson, who
was engaged as sluiceman, but whose wages the Company wished to


reduce. A second strike took place on the Bth January, 1881, owing to
the manager having put on a new hand in place of one of those off through
the previous strike. Over 100 men from other mines mustered at the
mine, and all works were stopped, the after result being that the mining
manager was called upon to resign, and a new manager was appointed, the
strike only lasting a week and Mr. Sampson receiving his wages. In
April, 1881, a Chinaman (Ah Sing) was refused permission by the
Association to take any of the mines on tribute; hence, Chinese were kept
out. In May following, Sin Lu, another “boss,” wished to take the
“ Baron, ” but was told he would not be allowed. On the 14th of same
month a monster anti-Chinese meeting was held in Creswick, after which
the Hon. Graham Berry,Chief Secretary,promised to bring in a Bill restricting
Chinese immigration. During this year several important actions were taken,
such as successfully opposing the sale of the reserve at Wheeler’s Bridge ;
securing a rise of 2s per shift for a number of men engaged boring;
forwarding petition to Minister of Mines, asking for 8 eight hours for
engine drivers,and notably the sludge difficulty, which caused the stoppage
for a time of the two largest and most important mines. A joint deputation
from the mining companies and the Association so influenced the
Government that a Bill was passed through the Assembly in less than a
fortnight, which action had the effect of causing a settlement of the
difficulty.
In December, 1881, an attempt to reduce wages of engine-drivers and
braceinen at Ryan’s and Harrington’s was successfully opposed.
At the half-yearly meeting of the branch, held on 29th July, 1882, the
advisability of asking for an increase of wages was discussed, and it was
agreed that the directors of the various mines should be asked to grant an
increase of sixpence per shift. Messrs. W. G. Spence, J. Sampson, W.
Tainsh, T. Phillips, and B. Q. Richards were appointed delegates with
instructions to meet the directors in Conference, lay the request before
them and the reasons for it being submitted, and report their reply to the
committee. At the time there was no intention of enforcing the wish for
an increase by anything in the nature of a strike, and it was understood
that if nothing was gained there would be no loss. The directors of the
various mines met, and the delegates from the branch laid the case before
them. Subsequently the directors again met and appointed the following
gentlemen as a sub-committee to meet the representatives of the Association
in Conference, viz., Messrs. H. Gore, J. English, J. Randell, J. Parkin, J.
Magor, J. Anderson, and T. J. Dibdin. These met on the 28th August,
and the following offers were submitted by the representatives of the
mineowners :
1— They asked for alteration of Rule 47, so that contracts could be
entered into.
2 They conceded 45s per week to facemen.
3 To be two classes of truckers—full wage, 5s 6d per shift; boys of
15, 4s 6d.
4 Head machinemen, 7s per shift; other assistants to be classed as
labourers.
5 Leading bracemen to get 7s per shift; others and those in progressive
mines, 6s 6d.
6 Leading platmen to get 6s 6d; others as assistants.
7 Enginedrivers —Shafts in full work, 8s; in progressive mines and
pumping, 7s.
8 — Truckers and labourers may be employed as facemen in proportion
of one to four miners for 6 months; wages to be 6s 6d, and the facemen he
works with to get 6d per day extra as an inducement and as compensation
for teaching the trucker his business.
Suggestions were also made that the Association should adopt a clause
admitting only competent men as members; also providing for old men by
allowing, them to work at lower wages.


It will be seen that had the above been accepted there would have
been a great gain to the majority of the members. The branch delegates,
however, entered into a discussion with the representatives of the mining
companies, and, after a conference lasting over three hours, succeeded in
gaming the following concessions:—No blocking to be done on contract.
Shafts and main drives, when let, to be by public tender only, and distance
to be defined. Facemen, 7s 6d per shift; truckers, 5s 6d; machinemen, 7s
bd; head bracemen, 7s 2d; platmen, 6s 6d. Enginedrivers—Mines in full
work, 8s; progressive mines, up to 4 parties of men, 7s 6d. These
concessions were very heartily accepted by the members of the branch, and
a erwards the secretary wrote to the boards of the progressive mines on
behalf of the enginedrivers and secured the 8s rate for nearly all. The
question of improvers (Clause 8) was submitted to the members by ballot,
when the plan was rejected, only 11 votes being recorded in its favor. This
conference, and the good spirit exhibited towards the Association by the
mineowners, together with the raising of the wages, established amicable
relations between employers and workmen, and put an end to the slight
feehng of bitterness engendered at the time the Association was first
established. 1882 was also rendered memorable in our history by the
deplorable accident in the New Australasian mine, whereby 22 members
were drowned. The value of the Association as a benefit society was
an/.,"’ 1 ' * hls case > as a sum of £1365 was paid to the relatives of
the 21 deceased who were good on the books. Other branches nobly assisted
to make the dram upon the funds lighter, Ballarat donating £lOO, and
Egerton and Gordon £25. 6
In July, 1883, the question of permitting the enginedrivers to sever
from the Miners Association was forced upon the consideration of members,
and owing to the very peculiar action of certain of the drivers, notably—
Mr. K. Allen, the then secretary of the newly formed Enginedrivers’
Association, the branch was almost drawn into what would have been a
very serious disturbance. By very great care and tact the difficulty was
overcome, a ballot of the drivers proving that a majority of them were
opposed to severance. In February following, the drivers were asked to
fu P ° l ?- J a Spe< i lal comm ittee of their own class to watch their interests, but
they did not do so, and in 1886 the question of severance was again brought
to the front. A ballot of the members, taken on October 23rd, 1886,
resulted m a majority of 192 deciding against compulsion being used to
retain them,and it was therefore left optional with them to be membersor not.
During the period under review, 3159 cases of accident to members have
occurred 44 of which were fatal. The total amount paid in relief of these
cases is £13,104 11s lid.
This necessarily brief notice omits many matters of more or less
importance, only the most salient being mentioned.
Ihe branch has been guided by the principles of conciliation through-
out scores of cases which had in them the germ of serious disputes, having
been settled quietly without the public being aware of the existence of the
t reatened trouble. The officers have, before acting, invariably tried to
understand both sides of every case, and would decline to take up one in
which justice was not clearly on the side of the Association. The policy
followed ha,s been to members to self-reliance, and to understand
that the first step towards seeking a remedy for any grievance must be
taken by those who were suffering from such grievance. Members thus
realise that the Association is not something outside themselves, but is
rf a “y themselves, and its character just what their aggregate actions make
it. those who have watched its progress must have observed that members
are less selfish, are more liberal and broadminded, and take more interest
m their fellowmen than those do who, though in otherwise similar circum-
stances, are not associated in unionism.
Ihe immense benefits the Association has conferred upon members
must be patent to all; but with a view of making the fact more clear, I


have carefully gone into the figures, and find that no less a sum than
£129,480 in wages has been gained directly to members. I have taken
the average number of men employed during the first four years, and
the two shillings per man received amounts to £20,280. Taking the
average since the second rise was gained 6 years ago at 5s per member
per week, the gain is £109,200, the total for the ten years being as before
stated, £129,480. This calculation is based on the assumption that without
the Association having been established, wages would have remained at
two pounds per week. In all probability the average wage would have
been less than that; hence the gain to the miners of this district alone is
considerably more than the amount given.
Taking again the direct benefits paid, I find that members or their
families have received £13,221 11s lid, made up as follows :—Accident pay,
£9,969 12s 8d; funeral allowance, £2,609 19s 3d. Accident pay bought oft,
£575; incidental fund, £473 7s 6d; strike pay, £67. This amount added to
wages will make a total, in round numbers, of £142,701. The total amount
paid in contributions and levies is £19,773, taking round numbers in every
case. Deducting credit balance, we find that members have paid £18,013
only, which leaves them a clear gain in hard cash of £124,688, or about
£IOO per man clear of all cost. That the community generally has largely
benefited by the distribution of this large sum is self-evident, and business
people especially should be warm supporters of the institution which has
secured and maintained the privilege enjoyed by the miners of the
district.
Since banding themselves together, a sum of £IBOO Is has been given
away in donations by members, £630 11s of which has been voted to the
district hospital. The balance includes votes to kindred organisations in
time of trouble £1362 17s 6d has been paid to the A. M A., a large portion
of same (£705 15s) being in support of others in the maintenance of union
principles.
In addition to these, I estimate that about £2OOO has been paid by
members to the many subscription lists brought before them. This will
make a total sum of £4505 16s, paid to help others, many of whom were
outside the colony.
The branch was not brought into successful operation without many
of its prominent members being made to suffer in the cause of unionism,
more than one or two having been “boycotted” and denied employment in
the district because of their having taken a leading part in establishing
the association. These have the satisfaction of knowing that their unselfish
efforts, though it brought temporary suffering to themselves, have done
much for the cause of labor.
In view of the immense good effected, great credit is due to those who
in the face of many difficulties, so firmly established the Creswick branch,
and members have reason to be pleased, rather than otherwise, that the
attempt was made to reduce their wages, and thus force them into action.
The result has been the establishing of friendly relations between employers
and workmen. Had the latter been working as independent units their
condition would in the natural order of things have been worse, and whilst
on the surface there would appear to be harmony underneath,
there would have been grumbling and discontent. Organised,
a balance of power has been created, which gives members
a feeling of manly independence that dignifies labor and makes it respected.
Occasional points of difference may arise between capital and labor, which
necessarily bring one side into contact with the other, and each
becomes acquainted with the other’s difficulties and are led to respect each
other’s rights. The result naturally is to cause workmen to take a more
intelligent interest in all that affects the welfare of capital, and when
outside dangers threaten the calling with which both are connected, miner
and investor heartily unite in dealing with it. The workmen demands, as
he has a right to do, a “fair day’s pay,” but let him not forget that he


contracts to give in return a “ fair day’s work,” so that the labor he gives
may produce that which adds to the wealth of the community in which he
lives. The worker should remember that if his labor fails to yield a profit
he will eventually suffer loss, no matter how indirect that loss may appear.
If a mine turns out a failure the capital invested and expended in working
it is a loss not only to the investor, but to the whole community. It is
wealth destroyed. The part of the community most interested is the
miner himself ; hence it becomes not only his duty but his interest
to become an intelligent and efficient workman. The greater his skill and
energy, the greater will be the result from its exercise. For instance, in a
mine employing 100 men, a few shovelsfull of wash extra per shift bv each
mail will aggregate a very considerable difference in the weekly output,
and may turn the scale between, loss and profit. It is time we got rid of
the old and erroneous idea, that it matters not to the workingman whether
the industry in which he was employed paid the employer or not, so Ion o'
as he (the workman) received his wages. By all acquiring a more inteb
ligent acquaintance with the important principles involved in economic
questions, a nearer approximation to a just and equitable adjustment of the
relations of each to the other will become possible. We have each a part
to perform in hastening the work of accomplishing the desired result; let
us do it with earnestness and intelligence, and our hopes will be the sooner
realised.
Yours in unity,
Creswick, July, 1888.
