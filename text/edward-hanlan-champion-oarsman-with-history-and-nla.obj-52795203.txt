INTRODUCTION.
The wonderful victories of Edward Hanlan, the champion oarsman, both in
America and Great Britain, have created quite a sensation in sporting circles
all over the world. On behalf of the distinguished champion, we present to the
public a book which contains a faithful picture of the great oarsman, and a com-
plete and authentic history of his life from the time he first learned to paddle a
“ dingy ” on Toronto Bay until he won the proud title of Champion Oarsman of
the World.
Included in this biography are the likenesses and biographies of all the best
known oarsmen in the world, likewise a tabulated account of the leading boat
races that have taken place from A.D. 1831, and other interesting aquatic
information, rendering the whole a highly pleasant readable book as a record of
all matters connected with rowing. It has been printed and published for the
proprietor by Albert S. Manders and Co., 30 Oollins-street East, Melbourne,
Victoria, Australia, who have been obliged, in some instances,to collate the con-
tents from various sources, namely newspapers, &c. All the latest events have
been included.
Melbourne, June 7, 1881.

EDWARD HANDLAN.
WHY HE EXCELS OTHER OARSMEN—HANLAN’S STYLE OF
ROWING.
Hanlan’s, the champion oarsman, great victories have been rung on the
changes and chronicled throughout the sporting world. All the champion oars-
men and wielders of the “ spruce ” have been compelled to succumb to his
wonderful prowess at the oar.
Wallace Ross, Charles E. Courtney, John Hawdon, William Elliott, James
Riley, Trickett, Lay cock, Hosmer, Teemer, Hamm, Morris, Coulter, Louther,
McKee, Driscoll, McOan, Loudon, Conley, Lee, and others—United States,
Canada, England, and Australia have all been compelled to acknowledge
Hanlan’s supremacy over them with the oar.
The question arose were all these wonderful victories the result of skill, dex-
terity, and muscular development, or have models, systems and methods played
an important part. Hanlan’s victories over oarsmen who were in many cases his
superior physically have created universal wonder and surprise.
The secret is, Hanlan is one of the most finished scullers that ever sat in a
shell. By constant practice and invention he has become master of a style
which it will take years for oarsmen to copy. He rows without the least appa-
rent fatigue or exertion ; and although an opponent may do twice as much work,
and strain himself to a pitch of muscular tension, his shell will fail to travel as
fast as Hanlan’s.
Hanlan’s style, practice, and his knowledge of the oar from long and tried
experience, has been the means of his success.
English oarsmen, prior to Hanlan’s invasion of England, boasted that their
style was the best, Joseph H. Sadler, in 1870, went to America from England,
and easily defeated every oarsmen who dared meet him. Trickett then visited
England, and by slight improvements in his shell, combined with muscle and
extra strength, defeated Sadler. Since that time a great advancement has been
made in boat-building in America. Sliding seats, invented by Walter Brown,
one of America’s champion oarsmen, have been improved, patent out-riggers and
swivel rowlocks have been invented and also added to racing shells. By a more
liberal use of these advantages Hanlan has gained in a measure the proud title
of champion of the world, and created a revolution in the building of racing
shells and the style of rowing among boating men in England, America, and
Australia.
Hanlan claims that any oarsman, to become an expert, must row as follows :
■ —“ A full, long reach out over the toes, with both arms straight; a sharp, clean
‘ catch ’ of the water ; a powerful, steady, horizontal stroke, with an application
of the whole force at the moment of immersion ; a clean feather and a low, quick
recover, shooting out at the moment of the finish. Good form is especially desir-
able, and this can only be gained by steady practice. Some professionals claim
that the long slide to the seat is the best. It is of the greatest importance in a
long race that the lower part of the chest should be as free as possible, otherwise
the wind will not last. It has been shown that the best way to hold out in a


long race is to keep the back straight, head erect. Oarsmen should bend from
the hip, and not double themselves up; if one does, he is certain to lose
the action of the lower part of the lungs. The head should be up and eyes
in the boat; nothing is so bad as to have any member of a crew turning
or looking round. The knees should be well apart, to allow them to come up
under the arms, so as to be in a natural position when rowing, and
thereby giving the loins an easy and more powerful action. In commencing
a stroke, the arms should be straight and at full length. There
are many faults to be avoided in handling the oar, one of the
most important being the dropping of the hands too low at the
end of the recover. Another fault is that of dipping too deep,
very common in beginners, and caused partly from raising the hands in the
middle of the stroke instead of pulling the oar straight through the water. The
oar should be put on its face, the inner part slightly turned toward the water.
In this way only the blade of the oar will be immersed, and at the finish will
come out cleanly without lugging or danger of crabs. Of the forward reach and
dip, the best authorities on rowing say : When the forward reach is taken, the
blade of the oar should travel backwards in the air after the dip, horizontally, at
a distance of a few inches from the water ; of course the distance depending
whether the water is rough or smooth. As regards the dip, the blade should
descend to the proper depth before any force is applied, otherwise the stroke will
cut. To effect this the hands must be raised sharply, and the stroke must com-
mence at once.”
HISTORY OF THE CHAMPION.
Edward Hanlan was bom in Toronto on July 12th, 1855; but while he was
still an infant his parents removed to the Island, which has continued the home
of the family ever since. Prior to his coming out as a professional sculler,
Hanlan occupied his time looking after the hotel which his father had
opened on the Island not long after he first moved thither. From his
childhood the Canadian champion, though very fond of manly sports, has always
been industrious, temperate, and very correct in his habits and conduct. He
stands five feet eight and three-quarter inches, and has rowed most of his races
at from 148 to 1541b5., though perhaps 152 or 1531b5, would be considered his
best weight for a hard race. From his childhood Hanlan was very much on the
water, and when quite young became ambitious to win fame as an oarsman. His
first attempts at rowing with outriggers were made in a very novel craft of his
own design and construction. It was a two-inch plank sharpened at both ends,
and furnished with a slightly elevated seat and outriggers. Though uniformly
successful in his earlier engagements, Hanlan was singularly slow in obtaining
the fame and reputation that his abilities as an oarsmen fairly merited. His first
appearance in a race was made when he was sixteen years of -age, he forming
one of a crew composed of fishermen. In the following year he figured as a
successful competitor in a couple of skiff races, and in 1873 first rowed a race in
a shell, the contest being for the amateur championship of the bay. He was
again victorious, defeating Sam Williams and McKay. Next year he met Thomas
Louden in a race for the championship of Burlington Bay, this being his initial
professional engagement. The result added another to his list of victories.
Louden challenged him to row another race over a mile course for 100 dollars
a-side, in the summer of 1875, and they met on Toronto Bay, Hanlan again
showing himself to be the better man, he winning by nearly two lengths. During
the same season he w-on a medal offered by the Governor-General, in a two-mile
pull at Toronto, defeating Louden and James Douglas. In the spring of 1876 he
vanquished Douglas and Wm. McKay, and on August 12th following became
possessed of the belt emblematic of the champfenShip of Ontario, offered by the
6


Toronto Rowing Club, his only opponent being MoKen. At this regatta Hanlan
likewise won a fishermen’s race, three pair of sculls, his partners being McKen
and A. Elliott, and the craft engaged being boats actually in use that summer.
All of these races were of minor importance, however, and the reputation they
brought was but local.
Hanlan at this time became ambitious, and he decided to enter the Inter-
national Centennial Regatta held at Philadelphia in 1876. Among the United
States oarsmen entered to row in the single scull race, which was for the Cham-
pionship of the World, was Patrick Luther of Pittsburg, F. A. Plaisted of New
York, and Harry Coulter of Manchester, Penn, the ex-ohampion of America.
Higgins, ex-champion of England, Wm. Spencer of England, Thos. Green,
England, E. Morris, Pittsburg, H. Thomas, ex-champion Thames, Besides,
Halifax also sent Alexander Brayley, their champion, who was confident of success.
Hanlan quietly went to Philadelphia, and without the least pomp or display
entered into training for the race; The great event was decided, and Hanlan
won easily, rowing the three miles in 21m. 9 l-25., beating the fastest time on
record. After this great victory, Hanlan’s name became famous all over the
world, and he was looked upon as a wonder.
In the trial heats of the regatta Hanlan defeated Harry Coulter, Pat Luther,
Plaisted, and easily disposed of Alex. Brayley in the final heat. When Hanlan
left his native city for the Centennial Regatta, both he and his friends were
heartily laughed at for their temerity in starting an unknown callow boy against
a lot of seasoned professionals. When he came back, however, a great change
had come over public opinion concerning him, and a torchlight procession and a
very ,handsome testimonial awaited him. In March, 1877, the Secretary of the
Ontario Rowing Club forwarded one hundred dollars in gold as a deposit for a
proposed match between Hanlan and Billy Soharff (then champion) to row three
miles, for 1,000 dollars a side, on Toronto Bay ; but as Soharff had just made a
match with Eph Morris, the challenge from the Canadian was not accepted.
Hanlan next appeared at the regatta held on Silver Lake, near Boston, Massa-
chusetts, June 13, when he was defeated by Fred. Plaisted, Frenohy Johnson and
others, he meeting with a mishap in the shape of an injured outrigger. On June
25th another regatta was held on the same water, when Hanlan won first prize,
beating Johnson and Driscoll, Plaisted not starting.
Hanlan then visited Boston, Mass., and on July 4th, 1877, he participated
in the single scull race at the Citizens Association Rowing Regatta held on the
Charles River, Boston, and was ruled out for fouling Plaisted, whom he ran into
at the turning-stake. His conduct upon this occasion gave great offence to the
regatta officials, who subsequently passed a resolution recommending that in
future Hanlan be debarred from participation in all races under municipal man-
agement. This action was, however, upon appeal from Hanlan himself, and
through representations of gentlemen who had taken him in hand after his return
to Canada, reconsidered, and the bar against him removed. After the victory
of Wallace Ross over Alexander Brayley in the fastest time on record for four
miles, the Toronto sculler published a challenge to Ross, whose backers were not
prepared to talk business on this basis. However, Ross’s defeat of F. A. Plaisted,
of New York, coupled with the indifferent performances of Hanlan at Boston
and vicinity, inspired them with greater confidence, and about the middle of
August, Ross came out with a challenge to row any man in the Dominion, Hanlan
preferred, afive mile race for 1,000 dollars a side, offering to give or take 300 dollars
for expenses, to row at St. John, N. 8., or Toronto; or to row at Springfield,
Massachusetts, each paying his own expenses. This suited Hanlan, and articles
were signed to contend for 1,000 dollars a side.
This race was the real turning point in Hanlan’s career. True, his perform-
ance at the Centennial had for the time placed him very high in public estima-
tion, but his want of success in Eastern regattas had done much to shake public


confidence in his abilities. Though supported by good men for this contest with
Ross, he did not receive anything like that care and attention which he has since
come to regard as a matter of course, The boat he had was a very indifferent
sort of craft, manufactured by George Warin, of Toronto, and whatever attention
it required he had to bestow upon it himself. In those days, instead of having
his food carefully selected for him by a thoroughly competent trainer, he used to
walk out to the butcher stalls and select his own steaks. He had good friends
who stuck by him, though on the very day of the race, October 15th, 1877, a
majority of those who had placed their money upon him weakened and hedged
out as much as they could, gladly giving 100 dollars to 7 5 dollars in favor of Ross.
In spite of all these discouragements, however, Hanlan’s matchless pluck and
coolness never forsook him. He took his work regularly as clock-work, ate
heartily, and actually took such a satisfactory siesta after an early dinner on the
day of the race that he had to be waked out of a sound sleep to go out upon the
water and row down the man who was selling in the pools at 100 dollars to 75
dollars, and this at a time when Hanlan well knew that many who had been his
staunchest supporters were hedging out what they had invested on him just as
fast as they could find takers at the odds just quoted. When the word “Go”
was given, Hanlan was determined no mistakes should occur so far as he was
concerned. He shot right to the front, and drawing away from Ross with the
utmost ease, won without any trouble, making a melancholy exhibition of Ross,
who was evidently in no kind of shape for the contest.
At Toronto Bay, on May 15, 1878, Hanlan met E. A. Plaisted, of New York
city, in a two mile race, straightaway, for 2,000 dollars.
Hanlan won so easily, and made such a laughing stock of Plaisted’s abilities
as an oarsman, that the judge did not take the time.
Hanlan’s next race was for the championship of America, for which he had
challenged the then famous sculler Evan Morris, of Pittsburg. This race took
place on the Hulton course, Alleghany River, near Pittsburg. This was perhaps
the hardest race Hanlan ever had in a match. It was five miles with a turn,
that is, they rowed two and a half miles down the river and then back to the
starting point against the current, which was a very stiff one. Morris came far
short of being as good a man as Hanlan that day, but the course was very much
in his favor. Of course any novice might run down to the turning buoys with
the current easily enough, but it took a pilot to creep along close to the bank
and take advantage of all the little inshore eddies on the way back to the start-
ing flags. Hanlan had the race won, however, before the turn was made, for,
contrary to the expectations of the Hanlan party, Morris made his grand effort
when pulling down with the current, and he was dead beaten before he turned
his buoy. He struggled on gamely to the finish, andmade such a terrible effort
to retrieve his fortunes that it is very doubtful if he has ever been the same man
since.
Hanlan did not rest long after his championship victory. On July Ist,
1878, he won the first honors at Brockville, beating Plaisted, Riley, Ten Eyck
Pat Luther, John A. Kennedy, McKen and Elliott, in a race of four miles with a
turn.
On the 4th of July following he beat nearly the same lot of scullers in a
regatta at Cape Vincent. In both these regattas Hanlan had it all his own way
from start to finish.
Withoutreturning to Toronto after winning first moneyinthetworegattasjust
mentioned, Hanlan crossed over from Gape Vincent to Kingston, and thence
made his way eastward to St. John, N. 8., where he was matched against his old
rival, "Wallace Ross. The race was to take place on the Kennebeccasis, some
seven miles above the city, and Hanlan was soon quartered close to the water
side in the cosy and comfortable old Claremont House, Torryburn, the very house
in which the great Renforth breathed his last.


Here Hanlau had just the climate, food and accommodation that appeared
to suit him best. He had plenty of time to put himself in perfect trim, as (not-
withstanding the two regattas in which he had rowed) he had been enjoying an
almost entire “ let up ” since the race for the Championship. It was while he
was at the Claremont House that the Canadian champion could do almost any
amount of work, eat incredible quantities of the very best food, enjoy absolutely
perfect digestion and sleep sound, dreamless sleeps. Here, when “ pointed ” for
the race, he was as “hard as nails,” though he weighed somewhere about 154 or
155 lbs., while at Pittsburg he only scaled 148 lbs. when in rowing trim. Though
no pains were taken to time Hanlan during his stay on the Kennebeocasis, his
friends accidently learned enough of what he could do to make them think
from that time forward that when right and fit he could row down any man that
ever lived.
After numerous postponements on account of rough water, the race finally
came off on July 31st, 1878. The distance was five miles with a turn, for
2,000 dollars. At the start Wallace Ross went away with the lead, but held it
for barely a quarter of a mile.~ They both went a tremendous clip, however,
but when they had gone a little over a mile, and when Hanlan was leading by
fully two lengths, Ross rolled out of his boat, and it only remained for Hanlan
to paddle over the course and claim the money.
Haitian's next appearance was at the Barrie Regatta, August 12, 1878,
where he won first money, Wallace Ross coming second, and Hosmer third.
The other contestants were Evan Morris, Harry Coulter. Pat Luther, Fred.
Plaisted, Wm. McKen, Alex. Elliott, and Edward Ross.
Hanlan was then matched to row five miles against Charles Courtney, of
Union Springs, N. Y., for 2,000 dollars and a purse of 6,000 dollars
by citizens of Montreal, Canada. Considerable interest was manifested
in this contest, as Courtney had won numerous races, and was credited with
rowing three miles in the unprecedented time of 20 m. 14 1-2 s. The race was
rowed at Lachine, Canada, on October 3rd, 1878. Thousands of sporting men
from all parts of the United States and Canada assembled to witness what they
anticipated would be a close and exciting struggle. Large sums were wagered
on the race. The betting, which was at first in favour of Courtney, all of a
sudden changed to 100 dollars to 60 dollars on Hanlan. The race, as far as a
contest was concerned, was a farce. Courtney rowed at a lively pace for two
miles and a half, and then he was no company for Hanlan, who won as he
pleased. After the race, there were numerous rumors that the race was a fixed
up affair, but the truth of the matter is, Courtney was outrowed and fairly beaten.
After Hanlan had defeated the great overrated Courtney, there was no oars-
man in the United States eager to meet the invincible Champion, and Hanlan,
like Alexander, looked for new worlds to conquer.
A noted sporting man of Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, was authorized to
match Hanlan against John Hawdon, of Deleval, England, who was at the time
looked upon as the coming champion oarsman of England. The match was
made for £4OO, both oarsman agreeing to row over the Tyne Championship
Course.
At the time the match was arranged, English boating men both on the
Thames and Tyne generally laughed at Hanlan’s ambition in crossing the Atlantic
to row Hawdon. And from the time the match was made the boating men
backed Hawdon heavily, being confident that he would defeat Hanlan. English
boating men little knew that Hawdon w r as only selected by Hanlan’s backers as
a test before he met the best man in England. After the Canadian began to
train on the Tyne every possible means were taken by his backers to keep the
Champion’s advantages, rig and form from Hawdon, but in spite of their efforts
Hawdon’s friends became afraid of Hanlan’s rig, and refused to bet any amount
unless the Hanlan party would give good odds.


The race was rowed on the Tyne, from the Mansion House to Scotswood
Suspension Bridge on May 8, 1880. Betting was seven to four on Hanlan, and
was pretty freely accepted early in the evening; but later, fifty to twenty-five
was freely laid. An excellent start was obtained ; but the Toronto, bearing
Hanlan, soon forged ahead, in spite of Hawdon’s desperate rowing. Hanlan,
with his long sweep, away over his toes, soon gained more and more on Hawdon,
with his exhausting thirty-eight to forty-two stroke, with quick recovery, but
without much forward reach. When Skinnersburn was reached, Hanlan was
two lengths ahead. Hawdon was rowing with wonderful energy at thirty-eight
strokes to the minute. As the two men sped on towards Redheugh Bridge
Hawdon had the misfortune to deviate considerably from his correct course.
Meanwhile Hanlan was pulling steadily, and looking around to see that there was
no danger of his running into any craft that might be ahead of him. He looked
composed and sure of victory. Meanwhile the wind, which was blowing down
stream, was increasing in force, and the water becoming rougher and rougher.
In spite of this disadvantage, Hanlan steadily increased his lead, till it had
grown to three lengths. From this point it was evident that he had the race
well in hand. He now slowed his stroke from thirty-two to thirty. Hawdon,
who was beginning to show signs of exhaustion, also moderated his strokes from
thirty-eight to thirty-two. Hawdon was again guilty of bad steering. Hanlan
was watching him as a cat does a mouse, and playing with the Tyne oarsman.
It was evident now that Hawdon had no chance. The betting was 100 to lon
Hanlan, barring accidents. The champion’s boat flew through the water, he
keeping well in the middle of the stream. The water was meanwhile breaking
over Hanlan’s boat, and as he stopped to bail out the water, he nodded and
laughed to the spectators, who were running alongside the river’s edge. The
spectators shouted themselves hoarse. This scene occurred when the meadows
were reached. Great laughter and fun followed. Poor Hawdon was manfully
struggling along, hut he was in a piteous plight, thoroughly exhausted. When
Crane’s was reached Hanlan led by two boats’ lengths, apparently reducing his
lead for the fun of the thing, for he saw that Hawdon was badly out-rowed.
Hanlan soon after put on a spurt, and, as he approached the goal, was rowing at
25 to 28. At BenwelTs boat-house Hanlan enjoyed some more laughter, and
nodded pleasantly do those on shore. “ Hurrah ! Hurrah ! ” was the deafening
cry which was heard at this time. Hanlan bowed and smiled. When Scotswood
Bridge was reached Hanlan was four lengths ahead, winning by this distance.
Cheer after cheer rent the air as he was proclaimed winner. The correct time
of the winner is 22 minutes 5 seconds. Hanlan could have beaten Hawdon
by half a mile if he had wanted to do so.
While Hanlan was training to row Hawdon, Mr. Ren wick published a chal-
lenge, offering to match an unknown to row William Elliott, the English
champion of Great Britain, for ,£2OO, and agreed to be present at the Beehive,
Newcastle, at an appointed time to arrange the match. Both parties met at
Chris Barrass’s Beehive Inn, Newcastle. Joseph J Walton, sporting editor of
the Newcastle Chronicle, was voted to the chair, on taking which he addressed
the meeting at length, saying he considered the most judicious and straightfor-
ward way of getting to business was for Mr. Renwick to name his man at once.
A discussion ensued, the result of which was that Mr. Renwick said he would
bind himself to limit his choice of a sculler to Robert Watson Boyd, of Gates-
head, or Edward Hanlan, of Toronto. Preliminary articles were then and there
signed. .
At the second meeting, May 5, at Brownlee’s Oxford Back Bar, Clothmarket,
Newcastle, Mr. Whitefoot, of the Sportsman, presided, and among the company
were Colonel Shaw, Mr. J. Davis, Mr. 0. J. Starling, and Mr. Samuel Wallace,
who represented Hanlan. There were also present—W. Elliott, champion; James
Taylor, Mr. Richard Thompson, Mr. Chris. Barrass, Mr. S. Brownlee, Mr. Richard


CHARLES COURTNEY.




Renwick, Mr. George Peel, Wallace Ross, F. A. Plaisted, Mr. Jonathan Cooke.
Mr. Ren wick named Edward Hanlan as the unknown to row Elliott. After much
discussion about a match between Hanlan and Wallace Ross, which finally ended
in all parties agreeing that a race between the two provincials ought more pro-
perly to be rowed in America, and in Mr. E. Sterling, one of Hanlan’s backers,
offering to stake 5000 dollars to 4000 dollars for a race between the two on
Toronto Bay after their return to America.
At the close of the meeting, £SOO to £4OO, £IOOO to £BOO, and various
other sums were offered on Hanlan, who was a strong favourite. Bets on him
were made at £6O to £4O and £5 to £2O. During the meeting, Christopher
Barrass offered to back Robert Boyd to row Ross on the Tyne for from £IOO to
£SOO a-side. Ross declined this challenge. Hanlan, after a tour through Scot-
land, returned to his old training quarters, and went through a regular routine
of training for the race. The final deposit was made in accordance with the
articles of agreement, and the final arrangements made.
THE TYNE COURSE—THREE MILES AND 760 YARDS IN LENGTH
—ITS FAULTS AND THE DANGERS OF FOULING.
The course, measured in the centre of the channel, is 3 miles 760 yards, but
by keeping well to the north shore, this may be reduced about 30 or 40 yards. The
start was from the Mansion House, 150 yards above the High Level bridge,
leaving the distance to be covered 3 miles and 570 yards. The course is com-
paratively straight. The river inclines southward from the High Level
bridge, and just above Low Elswick—one and three-quarter miles from the
bridge—it curves gradually, and takes a slightly northward direction. The great
blemishes of the course are the long gangways of the Tyne General Ferry Com-
pany, which run far out into the river, and to avoid which, and the steamboat
landing stages, scullers have to veer out from the north shore into mid-channel.
Such manoeuvres being rendered necessary, imminent risk of fouling are run-
The man having the outside station naturally keeps as close as he can to the
north shore, without venturing into his opponent’s water, with the object of
shortening his journey, and can scarcely be expected to be able always to divine
when his antagonist may choose to begin pulling out so as to row clear of the
gangways.
Many fouls have occurred at these spots, and on various occasions the um-
pire has had the greatest difficuty in deciding which to blame. In other respects
the Tyne course possesses many merits. However, it is more exposed than the
Thames, and a comparatively slight wind from certain quarters renders it very
choppy. At the High Level bridge the width of the channel is about 600 feet.
Then it begins gradually to widen till Grindstone quay is reached, then gradu-
ally contracts, and off Cooper’s stairs is very little wider than at the High Level
bridge. From this point the channel expands very considerably, until at Low
Elswick it is nearly 1,200 feet across. Two and a half furlongs further on the
bottom of a long, narrow island, precisely in mid-river, is reached. This obstruc-
tion, known as King’s Meadows, is three-quarters of a mile in length, and on
either side the channel is rather less than 200 feet wide at the narrowest part.
From the top of the King’s Meadow the breadth of the channel is about TOO feet.
This is a capital stretch of water, though the banks on either side, being remark-
ably low and bare, afford no protection whatever from the wind. From the High
Level bridge the scullers have a nearly straight run of five furlongs to the lead
works.
Then comes a bend in the river, which is rendered all the more difficult to
pass without accidental collisions in consequence of a contrivance known as the
coal staith putting out a long way from the shore. For three furlongs the soul


lers have to manipulate the curve, taking care to avoid the. extremely awkward
Dunn street gangway, and if they succeeded in reaching Mile point without a
mishap, the worst of their perils are over. They then enter upon a capital reach
of water extending right up to the foot of King’s Meadows. Sir William Arm-
strong’s hydraulic crane marks the mile and a half stage of the journey, and the
great crane, or, as it is now called, the platform, the two-mile limit. The head of
King’s Meadow is two miles and 350 yards from the starting point, hut the best
landmark for reckoning is the crane at the east end of Paradise quay, precisely
two miles and a half from the High Level bridge. Benwall ferry is 305 yards
higher up the river, and thence the scullers coast along Scotswood Haughs right
to the Suspension bridge and the end of the course.
The great race was rowed on June 16th, 1879. A tremendous crowd con-
gregated to witness the contest. Elliott’s cutter was first seen making its way
down towards the High Level, and the crew disembarked at the logs in front of
the Mansion House, where Elliott was in waiting. Hanlan’s ten-oar followed
down on the Gateshead side, and she carried his boat the “ Toronto,” the crew
proceeding below the High Level to Boyd’s boatyard, where the Canadian was
ready to meet them.
At 11.50 Elliott was seen on the Mansion House Quay almost ready for
action, and he looked brimful of confidence. James Percy, Taylor, and Ralph
Hepplewhite launched the fragile “ England ” upon the waters as tenderly as if
it had been a baby, and the Blyth man was not long in getting afloat. His
adversary, however, did not embark until nearly ten minutes later, and as both
men made their appearance on the river they were repeatedly cheered in the
most enthusiastic manner, and Hanlan removed his cap in response, while a band
on one of the steamers played “ Bonny Pit Lad,” in the north countryman’s
honor. As soon as it was known that Elliott had won the toss for choice of
stations, the men proceeded to their stake boats, but the commencement of hos-
tilities was delayed until 14 minutes past 12 o’clock. The greatest excitement
prevailed amongst the thousands of visitors on shore and afloat, and the scene
was such as is seldom witnessed even on Tyneside. Elliott selected the northern
or Newcastle station, and the men began to perform their racing toilets, the
Englishman stripping to the buff, while the Canadian, as on the previous
occasion, rowed in dark blue sleeveless jersey and blue drawers.
THE RACE.
All were on the qui vive for the start, and there was almost breathless
silence while the sterns of the men’s boats were being held, Mr. Ward, of
Toronto, doing duty for Hanlan, and a friend for Elliott, Jas. Taylor being in
the head of the latter’s cutter, and Bright in that of Elliott’s opponent. Hanlan
who won the toss for stations when he rowed Hawdon, lost on this occasion,
although there was little to choose in this respect, as the boats were well out
in the centre of the tide, which, owing to the weight of land water, was moving
very slowly.
Elliott chose the Newcastle or northern side, and after the Tynesider’s boat
had once or twice drifted away from his station they got off on pretty even
terms. Hostilities had hardly commenced, however, before Elliott appeared to
be going unsteadily ; he dug his sculls deeply, and his style already bore un-
favourable contrast with that of his opponent, who was rowing in beautiful
form, although putting his sculls in at the rate of 42 to the minute against 40
on the part of Elliott. As they ploughed along at this terrific rate the excite-
ment was beyond all description, more especially that for 150 yards or so the
Canadian had not taken more than a lead of half a length, and Elliott’s thou-
sands of admirers on Tyneside began to congratulate themselves that their man


was not going to be so easily beaten after all. He, however, was evidently not
au fait with the long slide and swivel rowlocks; he splashed very much ; more-
over, he seemed anxious, and passing Wylie’s Quay he looked over his right
shoulder to see how far Hanlan was in front of him. Finding that the latter
was fully a length in advance, he set to work again in the most determined
manner, but it was of no avail, for Hanlan, still rowing at 40 strokes to the
minute, and Elliott at the same rate, was still increasing his lead. At the
Skinner Burn there was nearly a length of daylight between the boats, but from
that point to the Redheugh Bridge Hanlan was unable to increase the distance,
owing, probably, to his deviation from the course slightly, and that Elliott was
working his sculls more evenly than when he started. The bridge was reached
in 2m. 355., and both scullers kept well out in mid-stream, neither relaxing the
slightest in his efforts. Presently it could be seen that Hanlan had the race in
hand, for he was evidently not rowing at his fastest pace, and still improving his
position. Between the Lead Works and Cooper’s stairs Elliott once more got
very deep with his left-hand scull, and his boat was almost brought to a stand-
still, which enabled Hanlan to get further away, and at Hall’s Quay corner he
was four lengths in advance. The American Champion was now rowing with
comparative ease, and occasionally he looked over his shoulder to see if all was
clear. As they approached the Dunn-street gangway Elliott improved very much
in style, and he came up a little, the cheers upon the water and on land being of
the most deafening kind.
The mile, less 150 yards, was reached in 6 minutes 11 1-2 seconds from the
time of starting, which is considered to be exceedingly fast, and although Hanlan
was beginning to show his usual indifference, Elliott strained every nerve
to alter the aspect of affairs, the race proceeding in this way to the High Sheer
Legs at Armstrong’s Works, where Hanlan led by three lengths, rowing 32
strokes to the minute against Elliott’s 37. Half way up the meadows, where
there were immense crowds on either side of the river, Hanlan took Elliott’s
water, and then rowed on in front of him, both in mid-stream, but from here
to the two mile post the leader improved his position, being as nearly as pos-
sible five lengths in advance. The time was 12m. Bs. for the distance, less 150
yards, and, as they were rowing on to the Paradise Quay, Elliott went across
into Hanlan s water, but the umpire’s boat, which had been a very long way
astern all the time, was now shut out from a view of the race by some of the
steamboats, and it became impossible to see how far Hanlan was leading. It
was evident, however, that, bar accident, all was over, for Hanlan seemed to be
doing just as he pleased ; sometimes he appeared to be half a dozen lengths in
front, then only half that distance, but he must have considerably increased his
lead after passing the ferry above Paradise, for the judge, Mr. Swaddle, stated
that he had won the race by 11 lengths. Time, 21m. Is., just one minute faster
than when Elliott beat Higgins.
Hanlan, after his victory, was pronounced a wonder, and the English press
acknowledged him to be the most speedy and finished oarsmen that was ever seen
on the Thames or Tyne. Hanlan returned to America. He received a grand
reception in New York, and Toronto, his home, received him with open arms. Of
course Hanlan was received by his fellow-citizens and countrymen in the warmest
manner when he came home.
Hanlan was doomed to meet with something very like a reverse soon after
his return to his native city. On the 18th of August he was foolish enough to
start in the professional race at the Barrie Regatta, though he knew very well
that he was far from being in condition for anything like a hard contest. His
trip to England had certainly done him no good, and he did not improve after his
return to Canada as he ought to have done. He was not high in fiesh, and out
of condition in that respect; but on the other hand he was thin and light enough
for a hard race, but at the same time comparatively soft and flabby. Indeed, at


this time it was feared by many of his friends that the Champion was breaking
up altogether, and that, young as he was, he was already passing into physical
decadence. Their great anxiety was to induce him to put on flesh again with the
same surprising rapidity that had been his wont in 1878 ; but it seemed as
though this could not be done. For a time he had almost quit rowing, and
devoted himself as nearly as possible to absolute rest, and it was during this time
that he suddenly made up his mind to start at the Barrie Regatta.
In the race there were numerous starters; but the dangerous men were
James H. Kiley and John O. Kennedy. Hanlan was placed near the outside of
the course, and Riley more in shore. Now, it happened that the scow which
constituted the judges’ stand at the start and finish had dragged anchor some-
what the night before the race, and, as the starting line was an imaginary one
drawn from a flag on this scow to one on a corner of one of the piers inshore, the
course drawn by Hanlan must have been a length or more longer than Riley’s,
while the score for start and finish was not at right angles to the course, as it
was supjiosed to be.
When the word was given Hanlan struck off at a great rate, and was soon
so far ahead that he looked like a sure winner. He lost some time at the turn,
however, and as they were on their way home Riley gained upon him rapidly.
While they were yet some distance from the finish Riley secured a lap on him,
and then Hanlan struck out more vigorously, though he was evidently pretty
tired. As he neared the finish Hanlan kept his eye on the inshore flag, and he
could sight this easily across the prow of Riley’s shell. Looking at right angles
to the course, he felt sure he had won the race when the gun was fired ; but from
the scow the judges saw the finish differently, and declared it a dead heat. Han-
lan declined to row the race off the next day, and first money was accordingly
awarded to Riley.
Hanlan’s next appearance in public was at Chatauqua Lake, where he was
to row Courtney a race of five miles, with turn, for a purse of 6,000 dollars. The
circumstances attending this attempt at a race did much to weaken the hold
which aquatics had taken upon the esteem of the Canadian people. The whole
truth of the case may never come out, but this much is pretty certain : Courtney
was funking, and did not want to start unless the race could be fixed for him to
win. Hanlan’s friends promised that he would be allowed to win, without any
intention of keeping to their agreement. In other words, they proposed meeting
fraud with fraud, making Courtney’s supporters, and not Hanlan’s, the victims.
On the day before the race one of Ward’s most intimate friends made a play or
pay bet of 1,000 dollars on Hanlan to 700 dollars on Courtney. The thing was
done very quietly, and the man who backed Courtney was a total stranger to the
Canadian party. Unfortunately for the “ little game ” that was being played,
however, the stranger was only betting 200 dollars of his own money, the other
500 dollars being put up for Courtney’s friend and adviser, J. H. Brister. When
Brister learned the name of the gentleman who had put up the 1,000 dollars, he
knew that he and the rest of the Courtney party were getting what is known in
sporting parlance as the “ double cross.” That evening Courtney’s boats were
.sawed, and very few are now found who doubt that the sawing was done with the
knowledge and consent of both Brister and Courtney. This closed the season of
1879 so far as Hanlan is concerned.
On the 19th of May, 1880, Hanlan defeated Courtney with ridiculous ease
on the Potomac at Washington; and on the 26th of the same month he defeated
Riley over the same course, without ever being compelled to exert himself. A
few weeks later Hanlan rowed in the regatta at Providence, R. 1., June, 1880.
The distance was four miles with a turn. The following started :
Wallace Ross, St. John, N. 8.; Geo. W. Lee, Newark, N. J.; James H. Riley,
Saratoga, N.Y.; Horatio Delano, Chelsea, Mass. ; James A. Ten Eyck, Peeks-
kill, N.Y. ; F. A. Plaisted, Boston, Mass.; Jacob Gaudaur, Toronto, Can. ; Jas.


BOYD .
J. HIGGINS.




H. Dempsey, Geneva, X.Y. ; R. W. Boyd, Middlebro’, Eng.; Edward Hanlan,
Toronto, Gan.
Of those who had entered the following withdrew :
John A. Kennedy, Geo. W. Weisgerber, Erenchy Johnson, and G. H.
Hostner.
Kot within our recollection were so many high-class scullers previously
started in a race, and the stillness which fell upon the vast throng, and the eager
intensity of their gaze as the men sat with oars poised and teeth set awaiting the
signal, showed how deeply concerned all were in the contest between these giants
of the oar. All eyes were fixed on Hanlan and his next-door neighbour, Boyd,
and when it was noticed that the champion at once began to draw away from the
Englishman, the manifestations of satisfaction were unmistakable. Fast as Han-
lan went, however, Plaisted travelled still faster, jumping away with the lead ;
but he was early called upon to resign it to Ross, who was putting in long,
powerful strokes, which proved more than Fred could withstand, and he quietly
fell back to fourth place as Riley dashed past after Ross, who at the three-
quarters was a little in advance of Hanlan.
For a mile and a half the race between Ross, Hanlan, and Riley was
terrific; but the former’s vigorous stroke had by that time forced him almost a
length ahead—not much to gain ordinarily in that distance, but a lot for anybody
to snatch from the champion. At this time the fourth man was Gaudaur, and
he was followed by Dempsey, Lee, Ten Eyck, Plaisted, Boyd, and Delano—the
fast work done by Plaisted and Boyd at the start having tired them badly, and
thus sent them to the rear. About a quarter of a mile from the turn, Hanlan,
who had been rowing in front of Riley, was observed to cease pulling long
enough to lose several strokes, and when he resumed he did not put the life
characteristic of him into his work, and Riley managed to get around his stake
ahead of the Canadian, who seemed to be in difficulties from some cause.
Ross turned both his own buoy and the one next to it, by which he didn’t gain
anything, although, as the sequel proved, he didn’t need more than he already
had to make his election sure. He had pulled a magnificent race so far, and the
pace was all the way very fast—faster than the Xew Brunswick sculler had ever
before carried an opponent along, and it was not to be wondered at that there
should be tired men in the ranks. Gaudaur was fourth man to make the turn,
his followers being, in succession, Lee, Ten Eyck, Delano, Plaisted and Boyd, the
last-named seemingly distressed, and as he fouled his buoy in turning, whei eby he
lost valuable time and distance, he evidently now regarded his case as hopeless,
and did not afterwards make an effort to win anything, although continuing on
down the river. Dempsey did not go to the stake at all, having had enough of
it before reaching that point.
The'pull back taxed the strength and skill of the oarsmen to the utmost, as
soon after rounding the buoys the wind increased greatly in force, breaking the
water up into good-sized hillocks, surmounted with white caps, and it was a diffi-
cult matter to keep one’s shell from swamping, while all were obliged to carry
water home with them. It was astonishing to see the way in which Ross, who
had earned the title of “ champion smooth-water man,” made his shell travel
through the young sea; but then he was the only man who had taken the pre-
caution to fit his boat with a wind-sail, which, with that wind to contend against,
was a really necessary article, and would have materially helped all who tried
it. When about two and a quarter miles had been rowed Hanlan was
again seen to quit rowing, and an inquiry from those on the press-boat elicited
a reply by signal, he placing his hand to his side to indicate that the trouble was
there. He did not persevere, merely paddling down to the boathouse, arriving
long after the winner had been made known. Ten Eyck succeeded in wrestling
the third prize from Gaudaur. Time : Ross, 29m. 545. ; Riley, 30m. 30 l-25.;
Ten Eyck, 30m. 58s. A roar of applause greeted Ross at the finish, and then the


people hurried back to the city, surprised but not displeased at the result of the
race.
Hanlan’s trouble was stated to be a severe pain in the side, which first at-
tacked him in Washington, and on account of which he for some time wore a-
plaster over the affected part, this bringing him the desired relief, when he dis-
pensed with the plaster. The reason given for Boyd’s failure to do better is that
he was not in as good condition as such a hard race required, The prizes were
presented at the Oolliseum, a mammoth pavilion at Rocky Point. After the pre-
sentation a number of invited guests were entertained by the E. R. A. at the hotel
at the Point.
In the meantime Hanlan had, after numerous endeavors, been matched to
row Edward A. Trickett, of Sydney, Australia, who claimed to hold the title of
Champion Oarsman of the World. A match was made for the rival oarsmen to
row over the Tyne Championship Course for £4OO, Championship, and the Sports-
man Challenge Champion Cup that Hanlan had won from Elliott. All the pre-
liminaries for the match were quickly and satisfactorily arranged.
Trickett arrived in England in company with his Australian backers, and
Laycock. a noted oarsman. He went directly into training, and displayed great
form. Hanlan arrived on the Thames soon after, but rowed his trials well within
himself, so that the Australian sporting men were confident that Trickett would
defeat Hanlan.
The race was rowed over the Thames Championship Course on November
15th, 1880, a day long to be remembered in the history of international aquatic
contests.
Hanlan used his white cedar boat built by George Wharin, of Toronto, and,
rowed in his well-known suit of blue. Trickett used a boat built at Newcastle
and rowed stripped to the waist. On account of the crookedness of the course,
it is customary in England to allow to each sculler a pilot, who sits in the bow of
an eight-oared cutter, follows closely behind the contestants, and steers his man
by shout and gesture.
The weather was unpleasant. During the early morning an unusually cold,
thick, clammy fog enveloped London, and during the forenoon this mass of mist
seemed to melt into a steady, drizzling rain. About noon the fog became so
thin that the assembled crowds could see across the river, and when the race was
started, at 12.14 p.m.. the weather was cool and damp, but without actual rain,
the tide almost full and flooding slowly, a very light wind from northwest, and
water as smooth as could be wished.
The race, if race it can be called, hardly merits description, and was a farce
of the broadest sort. From numerous independent despatches we arrange the
following account:
The start was made from boats moored 25 yards apart, opposite the Star and
Garter hotel. Trickett won the toss, and chose the Middlesex, or right hand
side, but there was little choice in the actual condition of wind and tide. Han-
lan seemed in perfect condition—cheerful, confident, and even playful. Trickett
appeared to be a trifle overtrained, and looked sallow, careworn, and anxious.
Each man, however, expressed himself as in good health, well-trained, satisfac-
torily equipped, ready to row the race without excuses, and to acknowledge the
winner as the best man. Trickett’s backers also were satisfied with his condi-
tion, and invested their money freely, even after the men were in their boats. It
is, therefore, probable that Trickett’s appearance was due to his personal habits
and physical characteristics, and that his anxious, careworn looks were usual to-
him, and not significant of poor condition.
At the moment when the struggle commenced there was an easily observable
contrast in the demeanor of the men. Trickett had evidently braced himself up.
Some moments before he shipped his sculls into the water for his initial stroke
his legs were firmly set, and there was a brave look of determination about him-


His face was careworn, as he had appeared when preparing for the contest: the
lines in his countenance were now much more prominent, and he seemed posi-
tively haggard. Hanlan, on the contrary, maintained a cheerful, almost rollick-
ing demeanor. The air of bravado with which ho had gambolled to the stake-
boat had not deserted him, and he did not look as though embarking on a race
concerning which so many interests were at issue. At the very moment when
he got under way he was apparently engaged in criticising his rival, and it was
not until the contending boats were well on the move that he turned his eyes
toward the stern of his skiff and devoted the whole of his energies to the busi-
ness in hand.
During the first minute Hanlan rowed 35 strokes, Trickett 40, and it was
evident, thus early, that the Canadian had the race at his mercy. He was scul-
ling easily, and plainly within himself, while Trickett labored heavily, and was
clearly exerting himself to the utmost limit of his powers.
At the mile post the time was not taken, as the press boat was too far be-
hind. Hanlan was about a couple of lengths to the good, and this advantage he
did not seem to care to increase. At the Crab Tree (time 6m. 45. ) about the same
distance separated the boats, nd immediately afterward Trickett improved visi-
bly. He not only held his , but had the best of the pace up to the Soap
Works, at which point (time .. 46sec.) he was about a length and a half in the
rear. Hanlan nodded affably to the applauding multitude, and devoted so much
attention to them that he steered right out of his course, veering over for the
northern shore. But a single vigorous stroke with his left put the boat straight
again, and he now demonstrated that he considered he had a comparatively easy
task before him, for he sculled in a literally lazy style. However, he braced up
again at Suspension Bridge, with throngs of excited onlookers, was neared, and
treated the assemblage to an exhibition of his marvellous skill, passing''beneath
the structure with a couple of lengths in hand. His time to this point was 9m.
315., and Trick ett’s, 9m. 345.
He kept on at his smart pace until off Biffen’s Boat-house, where he treated
the onlookers to a dose of those remarkable manoeuvres which created such
intense astonishment among the multitudes who saw him contend with Hawdon
on the Tyne. Ceasing to row for a moment, he leaned back in his boat and
indulged in a leisurely survey of the scenery, and when he once more got to
work it was in a half-hearted way, as though he would prefer to linger, did
not circumstances compel his progressing. Before he had gone thirty yards,
however he stopped again, and having thoroughly got his hand in at this game
he continually repeated it.
Trickett was rather cut up from the start. He had kept his eyes on his
mentor, Kelly, and no one can accuse him of neglecting his task for a single
instant, but there was a painful lack of power about his manipulation of the
sculls, and it was evident before Hammersmith was reached that the exertion
he had made had told upon him very seriously. His face had assumed a leaden
hue, and it grew well-nigh livid as he approached the Doves. With fast
decreasing energy he kept on, and the wild expression of his countenance mat-
vellously contrasted with the demeanor of his opponent.
About the Oil Mills a large flotilla of small craft encumbered the river, but
they kept fairly out of the way, though Hanlan seemed to entertain suspicions
that he might come into collision with one of them, as he constantly looked
around. Having apparently satisfied himself that all was right he dashed in
half a dozen vigorous strokes and was quickly four lengths ahead. He now
attempted a piece of harlequinade, the like of which was never before witnessed
in a race. Dropping his sculls clumsily into the water, he fell right forward
upon his face and lay there for a second or two. So long did he remain in a
recumbent position that a kind of groan came from the spectators, who imagined
something terrible had befallen him, but before they could find their voices to


shout and inquire what was the matter, he had sprung up, suddenly resumed
the sculls, and was at work again, laughing merrily. A roar of laughter greeted
this feat, and it was some minutes before the intense excitement occasioned by
it had abated.
Trickett had meanwhile approached within two lengths, but he had no
power left to draw nearer, and Hanlan apparently went away again with con-
summate ease. He had a spell of rowing with alternate sculls, stopped
repeatedly, looked everywhere but at his pilot, dawdled in every conceivable
style, and generally was as full of antics as a clown. His time to Chiswick
Church was 15m. 345. Trickett was three lengths behind. A little further
on Elliott was observed ahead, pulling in the direction of Barnes. Hanlan
pulled towards him and the pair went on in company, maintaining an animated
conversation.
All along the Duke of Devonshire’s meadows this farce was kept up.
Hanlan and Elliott rowing leisurely' side by side, talking, and Trickett, with
blanched face and labored breathing, toiling in the rear. As the Bull’s Head,
at Barnes, was neared, Hanlan bore away from the Middlesex shore once more.
Some of the inspired ones in the press boat burst into prophesy. They observed
that Hanlan had threatened to beat Trickett out of sight, and they imagined
he was about to commence that effort. Really there seemed some ground for
the supposition, for the Canadian had squared his shoulders, and was skimming
along at a rapid pace.
This newly developed energy was evanescent. In a second or two he
dropped his sculls, dipped his right hand in the river, and scooped up the
water, nodding genially in the direction of the approaching steamers. He pre-
tended to drink, then smoothed his hair, passed his palm across his brow, and
once more resumed work in a languid fashion. By this time Elliott was once
more alongside, and the political or social discussion was resumed.
In the vicinity of Haitian's training quarters, the Bull’s Head, an immense
concourse had assembled, and they applauded lustily as he was seen with a com-
manding lead, and progressing at his ease. He ceased to work, and drawing
forth a white handkerchief, waved it gracefully in the direction of his admirers,
while peals of laughter and rounds of cheers greeted him time after time. He
passed beneath Barnes Bridge in 21m. 40s. from start. Trickett, utterly jaded
and worn out, passed under 9 seconds later. Thenceforth the pair plodded on
steadily, Hanlan gazing about him with supreme indifference. A cannon shot
announced the arrival of Hanlan at the winning post in 26m. 12s. Trickett’s
time was 26m. 19s. Trickett stopped exactly opposite the flag-staff, and
apparently was not sorry that the journey was over. Mr. Moore, the distance
judge, gave the verdict that the race was won by three lengths.
For a month before the race Hanlan was hard at work on the same course
with Trickett, and the Australian party had every opportunity to watch his daily
practice, to see him row his trial spins, to time him over measured fractional
portions of the course. But nothing that they thus saw and heard could shake
their blind confidence in the Australian giant. They backed him freely and per-
sistently, from the day of their arrival to the day of the race, and all sensational
stories about Trickett’s ill health, poor condition and over-training are swept
away by the simple fact that his backers were full of confidence and betting their
money freely up to the very moment of starting.
Not only were the Australians deceived, but many of England’s aquatic
experts backed Trickett freely; and no one of them all, after seeing the men at
their work, doubted that the race would be close and severe. It is almost incom-
prehensible that so many intelligent men could have been so strangely wrong,
and it would seem that acquatic knowledge and experience are practically useless
in judging the abilities of individual scullers.
Perhaps in the history of boating there never was so much excitement over
a race, or such a vast amount of money wagered as on the great contest between


Hanlon and Trickett. Trickett’s backers wore the Thompson Brothers, well-
known bookmakers, of Melbourne. One of them, Barney, left Sydney on April
22nd, duly authorised to make a Hanlan-Trickett match in America. He arrived in
New York early in June, and attended the Providence Regatta. After seeing Ross,
Hanlan, Boyd, and all the other scullers at practice and in the actual race, he
felt assured that his man could easily row away from the whole fleet. Alas !
The losses of Thompson were enormous.
Hanlan has abandoned the cross-handed style. He has shortened his sculls
inboard considerably, and what he has taken off at the handles he has put into
the blades. His style of pulling, too, is different to anything hitherto seen, and
it is wonderful with what clock-like regularity lie swings backward and forward,
impelling his boat through the water with a force that seems truly marvellous
when compared with the apjcarently small amount of power. In Trickett’s row-
ing the case is very different. There the motor can be clearly traced, and a
novice can tell where the power is being put, and, great sculler as Trickett un-
doubtedly is, he evidently lacks the knowledge of how to equalise his enormous
strength like Hanlan. There is a lack of that harmony of the members which
the casual beholder cannot fail to perceive when Hanlan reaches fomvard or
swings backward with the finish of the stroke.
After Elias 0. Laycock, of Sydney, won the first prize in the International
Thames Regatta, his admirers authorised him to challenge Hanlan to row for
£2OO a-side. Hanlan refused to row unless he was allowed six weeks to train,
he having gained over ten pounds since he beat Trickett, on November 15, 1880 ;
besides, he had sold his racing shells. Hanlan finally decided to meet Laycock
and row for £SOO and the championship of England, and the race was fixed for
January 17th, 1881. Hanlan would have rowed for the Championship of the
World ; but he desired to row any man in the world for that title on Toronto
Bay during 1881.
Hanlan’s speed in a shell is amazing. He is not a very big man, nor all
over a powerful one, though he is exceptionally well developed, not only where
an oarsman always wants it—in the loins—but where one who rows as he does
absolutely must have it—in the extensor muscles of the legs. For he does not
kick his stretcher, or shove his feet against it with anything like a jerk ; but he
sets them against it, and pushes with the heaviest and mightiest force he can
possibly apply, much as a man pushes with his legs and feet upon the floor when
he bestrides half a ton and lifts it—if he can. This supreme push, far more
forceful than any sudden kick could be, throw's every ounce of pressure against
that fulcrum that he can possibly impose. Hence he gets more power into his
work than any less effective pusher could get, and it rushes him forward accord-
ingly. This is largely why thirty-six of his strokes send him faster than forty-
one of Trickett’s, and put him two good lengths to the front before either is off
the Crab Tree, and while both are comparatively fresh. It is hard work, and
accounts for Hanlan’s many stops for rest ; but it does the business. It looks
about hopeless for a rower on the old method to try to cope with him. It really
need not be so ; for at least to the more intelligent among the rowing men it must
seem astonishing that a man like Trickett, a professional, who has for years been
champion of the world, has not sense and judgment enough to let such a rusher
go on about his business, and instead of trying like a freshman to catch him by
crazy spurts at the start, so distribute his strength and wind as to carry him his
fastest, whatever that may be, over the whole four miles and three furlongs, not
over a paltry half-mile. For, as usual in Hanlan’s races, the time over the whole
course is slow, though marvellously fast for a little way as long as it is
necessary. If on that dead flat water, and with the current as it was, Trickett
and his friends had not thought before the fight he could have done the distance
in less than twenty-five minutes, they would probably have never let him leave
Australia. And yet his little rival thrashes him hopelessly, and makes a laugh-
ing stock of him in twenty-six minutes and twelve seconds.


Hanlan resides at Toronto, Canada. He has been made a freeholder, and the
Canadians presented him with a free lease of the island opposite Toronto, and
they also presented him with his home, which cost over 20,000 dollars. Hanlan
has a large circle of social friends. He is gentlemanly in his manners, and
wherever he goes boating men honor him. “While in London, England, he
gained a host of friends. It will be a long time before another oarsman crosses
the Atlantic and wins the honors and laurels for his country as Hanlan did.
Hanlan is one of the greatest oarsmen that ever appeared. He is in his
golden prime, and what may be done with a pair of sculls and a racing boat he
can do. He is a man of very symmetrical build, muscular and strong without
being clumsy ; his wind is good; his constitution excellent. He abounds in
resolution, and he is conformable to the wishes of his trainer. At the same time
he weighs more, when in condition, than many think. When he beat Courtney
a sage reporter described him as a boy, the fact being that he was bigger and
heavier than Tom Sayers, champion of England, had ever been, in fighting con-
dition, in his life.
Hanlan’s victories, or rather his series of victories, teaches a lesson, of course.
He is not nearly so powerful-looking- a man as Trickett, or as half-a-dozen oars-
men whom he has defeated. A man, however, is like a machine. He is just as
strong as his weakest part. Great muscles are of little use if there are not lungs
equally good to back them ; and powerful lungs are next to nothing in a race if
the heart and other organs are not fully as able to bear their part of the strain.
Hanlan is like the deacon’s celebrated “ one-horse shay.” All his parts are
equally balanced. Every muscle seems to be just as strong as its fellow, and
probably when Hanlan gives way he will go altogether, as the “ one-horse shay ”
did.
Hanlan hears the same relation to the art of rowing that Rowell does to
that of walking. As in Rowell,s case, his victories have always left the extent
of his powers a matter of conjecture. Neither of the athletes have ever been
pushed to his utmost, and each has been satisfied to merely win his event, and
leave the definite measure of his abilities undecided.
Hanlan was bom of Irish parents at Toronto on 12th July, 1855, so that on
the 12th July next he will be 29 years of age.
He is sft. B|in. in height, and scales, in condition, from 150 to 1551 b. He
is compactly built, muscular, and strong, without being clumsy, and has a good
constitution.
His idea of good rowing is—“ A full long reach-out over the toes, with both
arms straight; a sharp, clean ‘ catch ’of the water ; a powerful, steady, horizontal
stroke, with an application of the whole force at the moment of immersion ; a
clean feather, and a low, quick recover, shooting out at the moment of the finish.
The lower part of the chest should be kept as free as possible by keeping a
straight back, erect head, shoulders thrown back. The knees should be apart,
to give easy action to the loins.”
Those who know Hanlan best describe him as a quiet, unostentatious man,
and in proof of this the following anecdote goes some distance. Some of the
members of a rowing club in the States went out for exercise, and, just as they
were getting into a boat, they noticed a 11 dude ” standing on the bank, fault-
lessly attired. “ Boys,” said the stroke, “let’s take the dude down.” Stranger
was accordingly put into the boat and told to keep time as near as he could with
the stroke, and that the exercise would do him a world of good. Away the boys
went, the “ dude ” sawing along, but managed to keep good time for a novice.
Faster and faster they went, but still the “dude” hadn’t even doffed his vest, while

with the others, though in boating costume, it was a case of “ bellows to mend.”
The stroke kept piling it on till something like 46 was reached at the finish,
but they couldn’t knock “ dude ” out. Then the boat stopped, and as the crew
looked round the “ dude” asked in a quiet tone; “ Well, gentlemen, when do
you reel on to do your final spurt?” For a moment they were speechless, and
then the , .coke asked ; “ Who in the name of Jehosophat are you 1” “ Well,
gentlem o, my name is Edward Hanlan; I’m from Toronto, and at present on
my way to Australia. Good day ?”
Hanlan avers that Laycock was the best man he had ever met. “ If,” said
the champion, “ I can row as well when I reach his age I shall be more than
satisfied.” Hanlan states that he has never, except on one occasion, had to row
harder in a match than he and on the Nepean. This was when he met Trickett
on the Thames, and the explanation is not that Trickett is a better man than
Laycock, but that he (Hanlan) was never in worse form for a race than on that
particular occasion. He explains that when Trickett “ went to pieces ”in the
race he was very near doing the same thing, but lasted a little longer than the
Australian, and won.
The style in which Hanlan moves his oars-when recovering from the stroke,
although having no effect on his rowing, must attract notice. The, broad blades
skim so close to the surface of the water that they are scarcely seen, and it is
one of the neat actions which in combination give such a finish to his rowing.
Feathering is one of the strong points with amateurs. Some oarsmen give con-
siderable attention to this minor point while calmly ignoring all rules for getting-
extra pace from the boat. Some of the Sydney scullei s put plenty of power into
their strokes, but recover in a slovenly' way that mars their style, while perhaps
in no degree interfering with effect. Hanlan, however, combines grace with
power, and unites the tasteful feathering of the amateur enamoured of fancy row-
ing with the long powerful strokes of the champion.
“ I have never yet feused to meft any man in the world,” says Hanlan,
“ on his own water when the inducements were strong enough, but if there are
two rivets available, one of which places me under a disadvantage while the
other is equally fair to both of us, I shall always row on the latter river if I
can.”
In lesser details Hanlan’s actions are marked by the same caution. On the
morning of the race, while Laycock wak lodging about amongst the spectators,
Hanlan was inspecting and testing every separate portion of a boat which he had
used up to the day of the race. Not an item in the fittings of that shell escaped
observation. On the water Hanlan and his boat are as much in harmony as an
animate and inanimate object can be. His sliding is as methodical and regular
and as free from apparent effort as the motion of the driving shaft of a locomotive
engine when running at the regular rate of speed. His oars strike the water and
leave it af the same rate of speed; and here, again, his action reminds one of a
machine that may be slowed or quickened to certain rates of speed, but which
neve# otherwise varies its action. It is only in “spurting”—an effort seldom
required in his contests—that Hanlan loses his mechanical action. Then he
seems to double himself as a greyhound does for a spring, and the way the oars
dash through the water, and the light shell answers to those powerful sweeps is
a treat to witness. That spurt was only seen twice during the late race, and then
more by way of an exhibition than because there was any real necessity for it.

HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH CHAMPIONSHIP.
The history of the Championship of England, is briefly as follows;—The
title was first claimed in 1831, by the winner of a match race, and for 45 years
thereafter it passed from man to man by matches made and rowed by the holder
and some ambitious challenger. There was no trophy to represent the champion-
ship, and when a new sculler came to the front he received the name and nothing
more. The record of these races is given below.
Sept. 9, 1831, "Westminster to Hammersmith—C. Campbell, Westminster,
beat Williams.
Aug. 19, 1846, Putney to Mortlake—R. Coombes, Vauxhall, 26m. 155.; 0
Campbell, 2. All subsequent matches on the Thames were over this course.
May 24, 1852—T. Cole, Chelsea, 25m. 155.; E. Coombes, 2.
Nov. 20, 1854—J. A. Messenger, Teddington, 24m. 255.; T. Cole, 2.
May 12. 1857—H. Kelley, Fulham, 24m. 305.; J. A. Messenger, 2.
Sept. 29, 1859—E. Chambers, Newcastle, 25m. 245.; H. Kelley, 2.
Aug. 8, 1865—H. Kelley, 23m. 265.; R. Chambers, 2.
Nov. 22, 1866—R. Chambers, 25m. 45.; H. Kelley, 2.
May 6, 1867, on the Tyne, from High Level Bridge to Leamington Point—
H. Kelley, 31m. 475.; R. Chambers, 2.
Nov. 17, 1868, Putney to Mortlake. —J. Renforth, Newcastle, 23m. 155.;
H. Kelley, 2. Renforth died without another race for this title.
April 16,1874 —J. H. Sadler, Surbiton, 24m. 155.; R. Bagnall, Ousebum, 2.
Nov. 15, 1875—J. H. Sadler, 18m. 11 l-25.; R. W. Boyd, Gateshead, 2.
June 27, 1876—E. Trickett, Sydney, New South Wales, 24m. 355.; J. H.
Sadler, 2.
Trickett soon afterwards sailed for his far-off home, carrying with him this
championship, and, as no English sculler wished to travel so far for a chance to
win back the lost title, innumerable disputes arose as to who was the resident
champion, and where the race should be rowed. To bring order out of this
chaos, the proprietors of the Newcastle Daily Chronicle offered a beautiful silver
cup as an emblem to represent the Championship of England, to be rowed for
first in an open regatta, and subsequently by challenge, in the same manner as
the old championship, and to become the of any sculler who
should win it in three successive races* *
The regatta was held March 17 and 19, 1877, on the Tyne, from the Mansion
House to Scotswood Suspension Bridge. First heat, W. Nicholsonjl Stockton,
30m.; W. Elliott, Pegswood, 2. Second heat, R. W. Boyd, Gateshead, 30m. 135.;
W. Lumsden, Blyth, 2. Final heat, Boyd, 25m. 455.; Nicholson, 2.
May 28, 1877, Putney to Mortlake—E. W. Boyd, 29m.; J. Higgins, Shad-
well, 2. 0f
Oct. 8, 1877, same course—J. Higgins, £4m. 10s.; R. W. Boyd, 2.
Jan. 14, 1878, Tyne course—J. Higgins, beat R. W. Boyd on a foul.
June 3, 1878, Putney to Mortlake—J. Higgins, 24m. 385.; W. Elliott, 2.
Higgins now became the permanent owner of this cup, and to promote and
encourage sport, the proprietors of the London Sportsman gave a cup on similar
conditions.
The regatta was rowed Sept. 16 and 17, 1878, from Putney to Mortlake.
First heat, W. Elliott, 25m. 355.; J. Higgins, 2. Second heat, R. W, Boyd,
28m. 225.; T. Blackman, Dulwich, 2. Final heat, Elliott beat Boyd on a foul.
Feb. 16, 1879, Tyne course—W. Elliott, 22m. Is.; J. Higgins, 2.
June 16, 1879, Tyne course—E. Hanlan, Toronto, Out., 21m. Is.; W.
Elliott, 2.
Nov. 15, 1880, Putney to Mortlake—E. Hanlan, 26m. 125.; E. Trickett,
Sydney, New South Wales, 2.


Laycock would have the lead at any time during the race. By reason of the
slight bend in the course the first mile and a half of the race was rowed out of
sight and under the shadow' of the high wooded hills rising from either side.
This part of the contest could only be seen by those in the steamer. There were
many false alarms from the crowd as different boats appeared at the far-away
bend, four-oared skills even being mistaken for the light sculling shells. The
starting gun was not heard, and when first noticed the boats appeared coming-
round the bend close together, within a mile and a half of the post. Haul an
was leading by about a length, hut this fact could only he estimated by watch-
ing the oar-blades as they rose from the water. All doubt on the matter w r as
soon settled by the hoisting of the red flag (Hanlan’s colors) from a bare point
near the turn, although a white handkerchief waved in the wind caused some
confusion. As seen through a field-glass, Hanlan appeared to sit rigidly erect
in his boat, and was the more conspicuous figure as he retained his jersey, w'hile
Laycock was nude to the waist. The Sydney oarsman could he seen bending
backward and forward in his boat, and the broad blades of his sculls as he
recovered after each stroke were distinctly visible ; he splashed a good deal, too,
while from the Canadian craft there was scarcely a ripple.
THE RACE.
Arrived at the George, both men landed, and had a few minutes’ rest and a
rub clown. Having been made cool and comfortable, Laycock was the first to
step into his boat, attired principally in “huff” and blue trunks. He then.went
for a short preliminary to make sure that all was right and tight. Being satis-
fied, he took up his position at the starting-point, where he was shortly joined
by Hanlan, dressed in his neat dark-blue rowing suit and red cap. Having-
placed himself in a line with Laycock, not many seconds elapsed before both men
dipped their sculls for the start. They got away beautifully well together, Han-
lan pulling his sculls through at the rate of 30 per minute, without the slightest
flurry or splash. Laycock, on the other hand, went away at the rate of 32. He
seemed by no means so much at home in his boat as his opponent, and knocked
up a good deal of water. Laycock steadied himself, and began rowing in much
better form, hut he was now half a length to the had. Nearing the mile post
both slowed down to 30 per minute, Hanlan leading by almost a clear length, and
rowing in an easy style as if it were no exertion whatever to him The same order
was maintained to the second mile, except that Hanlan had increased his lead to
two clear lengths.
The pace from the start was now telling on Laycock, who had reduced his
strokes to 28, Hanlan rowing about the same. Although the latter appeared
quite unconcerned and cool, the Australian was bathed in perspiration, and began
looking anxiously over his shoulder. By the time the third mile was reached
Laycock, by a little extra pressure, managed to reduce the gap between them to
a boat’s length. Approaching the bridge the excitement of the spectators grew
intense as Laycock was seen to he gaining on Hanlan, and a hundred yards from
the winning post they were almost level. Hanlan did not allow affairs to remain
in this state long. With three or four powerful strokes he shot away from Lay-
cock, and won by a bare length, amid the greatest excitement, in 22m, 455.
We cannot do better than quote the following ; —“ Hanlan in 1873 competed
in a wager boat race for an amateur championship, and defeated two pullers
named Williams and M‘Kay. He commenced his professional career in 1874
and 1875, when he rowed and heat Thomas Louden, and in the latter year won
a gold medal given by Governor-General of Canada, beating Louden and
Douglass. In 1877 he heat J. Douglass and W. M‘Ken, and in August of the


THE SCULLING CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD.
HANLAN V. LAYCOCK.
The aquatic dream of Sydney was realised, and lovers of rowing in Now
South Wales had the privilege of seeing one of their best scullers chase the cham-
pion of the world, Edward Hanlan, on Thursday, May 22nd, over a three miles
course on the Nepean River. A good many patrons of rowing in Sydney resented
the transfer from the usual champion course on the Paramatta River, and the
attendance was not so great as was anticipated. The race had evidently been
made the means of a big speculation, on the chance of a great crowd visiting Pen-
rith to see the contest. A large space on either bank of the river was enclosed
with a corrugated iron fence, and a long grand stand, with an admission of half a
sovereign, was thrown together close to the winning post. On the night before
the race there was very little betting on the result, and those who had taken the
long odds offered when the match was first arranged, on the chance of Laycock
becoming a stronger’favorite before the day of the race were disappointed. The
short odds had an existence only in popular gossip, and not in actual wagers at
Tattersall’s. The betting was sto 2 against Laycock, and before the race a ■well-
known Melbourne bookmaker offered odds of £4OO to £IOO on Hanlan, without
anyone caring to accept the wager. Practically, there was no betting on the
event. Hanlan’s preference for the Nepean rather than the Paramatta was not
difficult to comprehend on getting a fair view of the river—a beautiful stretch of
water, with only a single bend, and 150 yards in width for nearly the whole
journey, with not a single obstruction throughout. Hanlan’s objection to the
Paramatta was that an oarsman acquainted with its winding course had a decided
advantage over a stranger. The Paramatta is also subject to tidal influence, and
on that account local knowledge of the river was also likely to be of great value
in a race. Here, however, there was an almost straightaway course, and as the
weather was fine and clear the water was only disturbed by the slightest ripple.
As there was only one small steamer on the river, and this was much too slow to
follow the race, there was no chance of getting a complete description of the
tussel but as it afterwards turned out none was required. Arrangements were
made, however, for signalling with differeht coloured flags at various points along
the course, but this was merely to indicate who was leading at this particular
spot. THbse who had come provided with field-glasses were fortunate, but with
the naked eye it was only possible to distinguish the colors when the men were
within half-a-mile of home.
Hanlan was first on the water, having at the last moment chosen his
Canadian boat for the race. He was dressed in dark blue, with a red cap and
stockings. As he shot out into the centre of the stream, and took a trial spin,
he was warmly cheered, and as he pulled about for some time there was every
opportunity*of noting his style. His rowing is the perfection of mechanical
grace ; but if, as so frequently stated, Hanlan is able to keep the way on his boat
between the strokes, there was no evidence of it on his trial pull. The cham-
pion was in the best of spirits, and chatted gaily with his friends on the bank-
while waiting for his opponent. In reply to inquiries, he said that he felt very
well indeed, and looking at him, very few doubted it. Laycock, in Cambridge
blue, then paddled out from the bank and was warmly cheered from both sides
of the river. In his preliminary pull he sent his boat, “The Joker,” along at a
remarkable pace, and altogether sculled so neatly and vigorously that those who
had taken the odds against him were if anything reassurred by the slight spurt.
Both men pulled quietly side by side down to the starting point, chatting sociably
on the way. At this time the interesting point with the onlookers was whether


same year won the Championship of Ontario, and was also in the crew that won
a fisherman’s race (three pairs of sculls) at the same meeting. These were hut
local races, however, his great victories commencing from the date of the Centen-
nial Regatta at Schuylkile, where he won the first prize, heating the renowned
H. Coulter, Luther, Plaisted, and Green, of London, in the trial heats, and easily
defeated Brayley in the final. At the regatta on Silver Lake, Boston, Mass.,
in 1877, through his outrigger getting injured, he was defeated by Fred. Plaisted
and others. In a regatta at the same place a few weeks afterwards, ho won the
first prize, for which Plaisted entered, but did not start. On October, 15, 1877,
Hanlan rowed Ross a five mile race for the championship of the British Provinces
and a stake of 2,000 dollars, winning easily. His reputation now’ became fixed,
and he found friends among some prominent gentlemen in Toronto, into -whose
hands he placed himself, with the object of their making all arrangements for his
events in the year 1878, their intention being to make matches with the leading
scullers of England and Australia. Among those to whom the challenges were
directed were Edward Trickettt, Evan Morris, W. Scharff, of Pittsburgh; and
John Higgins and R. W. Boyd, of England; the result of these challenges being
that Hanlan rowed and easily defeated Plaisted on Toronto Bay in a two mile
race for 1,000 dollars aside. He next beat Evan Morris for the championship of
America and 1,000 dollars aside at Hulton, Pa., on June 20. On July 1, at
Brookville, he won the first prize of 500 dollars in a regatta open to all but
Courtney. In this contest he defeated Plaisted, Kennedy, Riley, Ten Eyck,
M‘Ken, Luther, and Elliott. On July 4he defeated Plaisted, Kennedy, and
M‘Ken for a 200 dollar first prize at Cape St. Vincent, N. V. On July 31, he rowed
Wallace Ross at St. John, N. 8., for 1,000 dollars aside. In this race the watcr-
was extremely rough, and Ross got capsized. Hanlan next appeared at a regatta
on Kempenfeldt Bay, Ontario, when he won the first prize of 500 dollars, Ross
being second, Hosmer third, Plaisted fifth, M‘Ken sixth, Morris seventh, Elliott
eight, and H. Coulter last. Following this great match, he rowed C. Courtney
on October 3, for the championship and 2,5000 dollars aside, defeating him by a
length and a quarter. On May 6, 1879, he beat John Hawdon on the Tyne for
2,000 dollars, In the following June he beat Elliott for the Sportsman’s Chal-
lenge Cup 2,000 dollars, and the English championship, on the Tyne. Returning
to America, he rowed a dead heat with Riley for a 500 dollar prize. Hanlan
not being in condition refused to row over again, and allowed Riley to take the
prize. In May next he beat Courteney in a match for 6,000 dollars at Wash-
ington, and on the 26th of the same month defeated J. Riley at the same place
for a stake of 2,000 dollars. At Providence, Rhode Island, he could not gain
first honors for the Hop Bitters Prize, which was won by Ross, with Riley
second. On the 15th November he beat E. Trickett, in a match for £2OO a-sido
the Sportsman's Challenge Trophy, and the championship of England, and on
February 14, 1881, beat Elias Laycock, of Sydney, in a match for a £I,OOO.
His next victory was on the 3rd April on the Tyne, when he beat Boyd for a
stake of £I,OOO. He met Trickett once more on the Ist May following for
£SOO, and won easily, and within the next twelve months in America he succes-
sively beat Kennedy, Hosmer, and Ross. At the time of his race with Laycock
he had not rowed since August last, when he competed at Massachusetts with
several oarsmen, but his boat was swamped by a passing steamer, and Teenier
won.


William Elliott.
William Elliott was bom at Hay Farm, Northumberland, November 28,
1849. He stands five feet seven and one-half inches in height; untrained he
weighs 176 pounds; trained, 167 pounds. He began his rowing career in 1875,
when he defeated William Martin, of Blyth, and afterwards J. Hogarth, the
champion of the Wear. His third race was with J. Finnegan, who defeated him
after a desperate race. In August, 1875, he entered the Manchester and Sanford
regatta. He rowed in the handicap single-scull race and won the first heat, de-
feating Oobbett, to whom he conceded five and a half lengths; but in the second
series J. Anderson, of Hammersmith, beat him easily. In the final Nicholson
and Smith (“ Biscuits”) came together, and the former was the winner. In March,
1877, Elliott had displayed such form and made such fast rowing on the Tyne that
he was entered to compete for the championship cup and £250, open to all comers.
The race was rowed on the Tyne, distance 3 miles 713 yards. Robert Watson
Boyd won. and Elliott, with Nicholson and Lumsden were defeated. Elliott’s
first match of importance was against George Tarryer, of Bermondsey, which he
won easily. Having beaten so good a man as the Thames sculler, who is credited
with having rowed from Putney aqueduct to the Ship at Mortlake in the fastest
time on record, his friends became jubliant, consequently they soon cast about
for a fresh opponent, and on the Tyne, Robert Bagnall, of the Ouseburn, and
William Nicholson went down before him.
On March 4th, 1878, Elliott again competed for the champion cup and £2OO
on the Tyne course, 3 miles 713 yards straightaway, his opponent being William
Nicholson. Elliott rowed a grand race, rowing in high wind and rough water,
and winning easily. These successes led the Newcastle people to think that they
had another champion at hand ready to do battle for the championship, which
had vanished from their sight by the last defeat of Boyd by Higgins, and there
is little doubt at that time they really had got the best man in the north. With
commendable spirit they issued the defi to the champion, and they also made a
match with Thomas, of Hammersmith, to row on May 6th, 1878, for £2OO. Hig-
gins, who was then champion of England, accepted the challenge to row Elliott,
and the match was made. Thus it will be seen that in the short space of five
months Elliott had scarcely been out of training, and he had to row four
matches. For this most recent event Elliott, after beating Thomas, went home
to James Taylor’s, at Newcastle, when he was sent to Whitley, journeying to the
Tyne each day for his rowing exercise. The race took place on the Thames, from
Putney to Mortlake, June 6, 1878, for £2OO and the championship, The course
was four and three-eighth miles. The Tyne boatmen were confident he would
win, and £SO to £4O was readily offered hy his backers.
On the day of the race Elliott looked big, and did not take so well in the
preliminary spin as Higgins, who never appeared in such good trim for a sculling
race before, and the offers of 7 to 4 on Elliott, which were then current, found
more takers. Elliott gained two lengths on the First mile ; then Higgins took the
lead, and reached Barnes’ railway bridge in 20 minutes 13 seconds, Elliott then
being 1 minute 13 seconds in the rear, and finally Higgins passed the judge (Mr.
Moore, of the London Rowing Club), opposite the ship, a winner by about 600
yards, his time for the whole course being 24 minutes 38 seconds, nearly two
minutes before Elliott. There was never a North v. South struggle in which
more money was speculated in Newcastle than on this occasion. The coin was
fairly piled on Elliott, until at one time as much as two to one was laid on the


Blyth sculler. Bookmakers, however, did not tire of accepting the odds, and
were enabled to reap a slight profit through telegraphing to Putney to be on at
starting price. This might possibly account for the position which Elliott occu-
pied when the race was begun. Immense interest was manifested in the struggle
by the inhabitants of the metropolis of the north, and at 3 o’clock on Monday
afternoon there could not have been less than 5,000 persons assembled in front
of the offices of the Newcastle Chronicle to learn the result. The most lively ex-
citement prevailed in the crowd, and as much as 5 to 1 was laid on Elliott by
one sanguine individual. When the telegram, “ Higgins won easily,” was ex-
hibited, therefore, the people were perfectly paralysed, and for a long time they
treated the thing as a practical joke. Elliott was not satisfied with his defeat,
for he issued the following challenge : —“ William Elliott, of Blyth, will row any
south country sculler a match over the Tyne championship course, in two month’s
time, for £2OO a side. Higgins w-anted to row on the Thames, and no match was
then made.
On August, 31st, 1878, Elliott entered the single-scull race at the Thames
International Regatta, against J. Higgins, and defeated him easily over the
Thames championship course; and, with Nicholson, Boyd and Lumsden, 'won the
four-oared championship. After this race Elliott accepted a challenge from
Higgins to row for £2OO and the championship, and the race took place on
Eebruary 17th. Elliott victorious, and since he has held the title of cham-
pion. Elliott is a well-formed, muscular athlete, and the fastest oarsman in
Great Britain, and boating men both on the Thames and Tyne were confident
he could outrow any one.
John Hawdon.
This noted oarsman w 7 as born in 1852, is five feet seven inches in height,
and weighs, in condition, 150 lbs. He commenced his career as a sculler at the
Tyne Regatta in 1876, when he won the prize for scullers under tw 7 enty-one
years of age. In that year he defeated H. Atkinson and Ralph Forster. He
w 7 as taken in hand in 1877 by James Percy, under wffiose care he was carefully
trained. He competed at the Thames International Regatta in 1877, in the
junior scullers’ competition, and in the final heat was beaten by J. Anderson, of
Hammersmith. He also competed in the open scullers’ handicap at the same
regatta, and succeeded in winning the first prize. He remained quiet until
March, 1878, when he row 7 ed J. R. Hymes, of Stockton, over a two mile course
on the Thames, and defeated him ; and three w r eeks later the pair met again on
the Tyne, when Hawdon was again the victor.
In April he had an easy victory on the Tyne over Robert Bagnall, who at
one time w 7 as thought good enough to be matched for championship honors.
He took part in the Thames International Regatta, when he w 7 on the seoond_


class sculls. A match was now made between him and Joseph Sadler, ex-
champion, who was not satisfied even to quit after Harry Kelly warned him.
The race took place September 14th, 1878, for £2OO, but the ex-champion was
out of all form, a mere shadow of his former self, and the north countryman won
all the way. Comment, therefore, is unnecessary.
By this easy victory the winner’s race with Joseph Cannon, of Kingston, on
October Ist, did not look such a rosy affair as it was considered in some quarters,
and the parties who had Cannon in hand lost no opportunity in training up their
man. The race was an event of considerable importance, and the greatest
interest was manifested by the “ talent,” who were on the qui vive as to the real
ability of the north countryman, he never having been extended in any of his
previous matches. From the excellent form shown by Cannon in his latest races,
it was considered that Cannon would surely make Hawdon “ spin,” and many
were of opinion that he would win, especially when it was noticed, on Hawdon’s
making his appearance at the Aqueduct, that he looked rather stale. In con-
sequence, 70 to 40 was readily taken, but the men had not long started on their
journey before 20, and then 30 to 1 was offered upon Hawdon, who won with
the greatest ease in the excellent time 22m. 57s.—a performance which at once
carried him into the front rank.
After Hawdon’s easy victory over Sadler and Cannon, it was only natural
that he should become a great favourite when matched against William Lumsden,
whom it was supposed had lost a great deal of the form he at one time possessed.
As the affair had been decided upon before Hawdon had so decisively proved his
title to a place in the front rank, it was not looked upon as a bad match for
Lumsden ; nevertheless, every means was adopted to bring him to the post in
good condition, and, perhaps, he was never seen to better advantage. They had
to row on the Tyne, for £IOO aside, from the High Level to Scotswood Suspen-
sion Bridge, November 11th, the race creating a great amount of excitement in
Newcastle and in the vast mining districts adjacent thereto ; but as it had been
reported that Lumsden had failed when an important question was asked, betting
on the event came almost to a standstill. On board the accompanying steam-
boats, just before the start, however, some speculation took place, but not before
3to 1 was offered on Hawdon, and then it was only of a limited character. To
the surprise of most people who saw the race, Lumsden made a far better fight
than had been expected, and headed his opponent right up to the Elswick Col-
liery Staithes, nearly two miles, a most desperate race having taken place from
the start. The water had been very rough for Hawdon, who had the outside
berth, but he was in no way deterred, and, as soon as the chances became
equalized, he showed a decided superiority, and went clean away. A foul
occurred, which Lumsden claimed, but was disallowed, and the Blyth man
acknowledged that he had been beaten by a better man.


WALLACE ROSS.
EDWAR TRICKETT




Edward A. Trickett.
The Australian sculler certainly has not such a meteor-like record as the
Toronto representative, but, at the same time, his biography is worth record-
ing. He is a fine specimen of the human race, standing, has he does, six feet
four inches in his stockings. He is broad in proportion, and of fairly pleasing
features, though he has at times a somewhat aged and careworn expression. His
weight varies very little, and may be put down at 13 stone 8 lbs. He is a man
of “ very few words,” most reticent as regards himself, and it is at ail times
difficult to got any information out of him. Like many of the most famous
English oarsmen, he began his life on the river early, and at the age of fourteen
rowed his first race—a small event of little importance. For five years he continued
steadly at practice, occasionally varying his life with a match with one or other of
his local rivals. On the day after Christmas, 1868, by which time he had reached
his eighteenth year, he brought off his first contest of any moment. Tempted by
his success in a home regatta, he challenged William Hickey, who was then
champion of Australia' The young aspirant for fame had, however, cause to rue
his temerity, for he was beaten hollow by Hickey. This defeat seemed to have
thoroughly knocked the conceit out of him, for he did not again tempt the fates
for some time. When he next emerged from his shell it was to meet a promising
sculler named 11. Pearce, whom he rowed in Sydney Harbor for a stake of =£2s a
side, the distance covered being four miles amongst the islands. In this instance
he went away at a rattling pace, and came out of the fray an easy victor. His
opponent was, however, not satisfied, and again challenged him. A second match
was made, and the pair once more met, the betting being in favor of Trickett,
who merited the confidence placed in him by literally knocking his opponent
“ into a cocked hat.” These victories gave the Sydney man a lift up in
the world, and from that time he was looked upon hs a man of promise, and
one who must not be neglected. The year 1874 next saw him in a racing skiff’;
in this instance his rival was Michael Rush. The scene of the struggle was
the Clarence River Regatta, and as Rush had earned the somewhat ambiguous
title of champion, and had the credit of being a first-class man, the event was
awaited with perhaps more interest than any previous bout at the Antipodes,
Trickett in this instance was not successful, his opponent holding to the end.
The backers of the loser, however, were not disposed to let the matter drop, but
Rush would not again come to the mark, and the match fell through. Trickett
thereupon immediately assumed the title of champion of Australia, and for some
time no oarsman was found clever enough or plucky enough to dispute his title
to the same. The deadlock continued until the month of January, 1876,
when a man named R. Green was found bold enough to try his luck with
Trickett for the championship scull prize, value £25, an event which came off
in Sydney Harbour. Here Trickett once more came to the front, for he had
things virtually his own way. A proof of his stamina was also given in
the fact that, in company with his elder brother, William, he won a double
iscull race for fifteen guineas on the same day. And now came a turning point
in Trickett’s career. No one—not even Laycock, who was then coming forward
in public estimation—could be found bold enough to challenge him. At this
juncture, Mr. James Punch took Trickett in hand, with a view of trying the oars


man’s skill against foreign talent. The Australian was matched to row Joseph
Sadler, then champion of the world, and won rather easily. After this William
Lumsclen, of Newcastle, forfeited to Trickctt.
Trickett then resolved to come back to Australia, but before doing so de-
livered a parting shot by offering to row any one who had heart enough to go to
the Colony for £SOO a side, and to allow £l5O for expenses. This tempting offer
was not accepted, and, so far as English scullers were concerned, Trickett went
home with flying colors.
Arriving there he was received by the Colonials with open arms, treated like
a hero, feted and presented with testimonials, and was for a time the “ lion ”of
Sydney But the aquatic party did not seem disposed to let him rest, for his old
rival of the Clarence River, Rush, challenged him to prove his title to the cham-
pionship of the world, or throw it down at the feet of a better man. Once more
Trickett put on the “ swenkes,” and went into training steadily and unostentati-
ously as usual. The day of the race again saw Trickett’s colors in the ascendant,
for he rowed in winner as he pleased.
Entering in the annual regatta in Sydney Harbor, he was beaten hollow by
his present champion, Laycock. Every excuse, however, must be made for
Trickett, as there is no doubt that at the time of the race he was unwell, besides
which he was still feeling the effects of an accident by which he had lost one of
his fingers. Once more he met Laycock. This time on the Paramatta River,
and then Laycock had to succumb. The match was for £6OO, and the victory
undoubtedly placed Trickett at the head of the oarsmen in the Colony.
Trickett then rowed in the International Regatta and was beaten in the trial
heats. On November 29, 1880, he rowed "Wallace Ross, of St. John, N. 8., over
the Thames championship course, from the Aqueduct to the “ Ship ” at Mortlake
The betting just before the start was in Ross’ favor, but there were no takers.
In drawing for position Ross secured the Surrey station. A capital start was.
effected and the Canadian immediately went to the front a length or more, where
he remained until Hammersmith was reached. Here a foul occurred, Trickett’s
scull touching Ross’ boat. They quickly drew apart and Ross again pulled ahead
a little. The race to the top of Oheswick Eyot was a good one, the men being on
almost even terms most of the way. At Chiswick Trickett took his boat in hand
and rowed away from Ross as he liked. The Canadian was thoroughly beat at
Barnes’ Bridge, where Trickett was several lengths ahead and pulling a fast, easy
and graceful stroke. He slackened his pace before reaching the goal, and landed
an easy winner by 4 lengths in 30m. 235.
Ross immediately put in a claim of foul, and the umpire, after hearing both
sides, decided that the race must be rowed over on December 4th, over the same
course. The race was won by Wallace Ross with the greatest of ease. Ross’
portrait appears in this work.
This race was the fifth International Single-Scull Match in which America
has sent out a representative to meet the champions of the Thames and Tyne.
In July, 1866. James Hamill, having defeated Joshua Ward, was sent to England
to row Harry Kelly, the English champion. Hamill was a Pittsburg fire lad-
die, and in numerous contests had proved himself a wonder in a shell. Two
races were rowed, and Harry Kelly, who was then in the zenith of his prime,
easily won both races, which were for three and five miles. In 1869, Walter
Brown, having won the Championship, went to England to row Sadler and Ren-
forth, the English champions. Brown made a match with Sadler, but had to
forfeit through being afflicted with boils. Brown, however, met Sadler’s brother
on the Tyne, and, although he met with anything but fair play, he ■won easily.
During the race, Joe Sadler tried to swamp his shell by running a steamboat close
to him. Brown put on spurt after spurt, and his opponent, being pressed so
hard, fainted in his shell. Joseph Sadler afterward made up for his losses by
attacking Brown, with a gang of roughs, near Putney. Brown, however, was;


treated with great kindness by Newcastle boating men. and received handsome
testimonials.
The next International race was between Edward Haul an and J olm Hawden,
The race took place over the Tyne championship course on May 6, 1879. Haulau
won easily, rowing the course in 32m. 2s. During the race Hanlan stopped fre-
quently and bailed his boat out. The next great international race, America
against England, was between William Elliot, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and Ed-
ward Hanlan, for £4OO, Championship of England, and the Sportsman Champion
Challenge Cup. It was rowed over the Tyne championship course on June 17, 1879,
and created great interest all over the world. The distance of the Tyne cham-
pionship course is 3 miles 760 rods. America was again triumphant, for Hanlan
won as he pleased, and rowed the course in faster time than it was ever rowed
before. Hanlan’s style of rowing created a revolution in boating circles in Eng-
land, and he was looked upon as a wonder.
The English sporting press published the following after Hanlan’s victory.
The Standard said :—■
“It proves Hanlan to be one of the greatest scullers, if not the greatest,
that has yet appeared. His victory to-day is a victory of perfect style over sheer
force. By what distance Hanlan would have won if he had pulled his best
throughout the race is impossible to say, but he probably would have passed the
‘ Ship ’ at Mortlake somewhere about half a mile in advance of his gigantic
opponent. From the very first, judging from Hanlan’s manner, he must haw;
felt confident of victory. Before a quarter of a mile had been rowed Hanlan’s
face wore a cheerful look. Indeed, at times one could see him smiling to his
mentor in the cutter, while, on the other hand, Trickett looked haggard and
anxious. Considerable interest was taken in the race, judging from the crowd,
which assembled in great numbers at Hammersmith and Barnes. Hanlau’s
victory, too, was evidently very popular, loud cheers invariably following the
announcement of the result on the return journey home.”
The Sportsman thus explains Trick ett’s defeat: —“We believe, first, that
Hanlan is superior as a sculler to Trickett, and second, we do not think Trickett
was at all well as could be hoped for. Weeks ago, when he made the trip to the
Isle of Wight and France, he was overtrained. He had worked himself to a
pitch of muscular tension which nature refused to sustain long and relaxation
ensued. Probably he was suffering from one of those relapses yesterday. It
must also be remembered that Trickett has always a bronchial affection, but we
do not hesitate to say that he would never beat Hanlan, even if in the best of
health. With regard to Hanlan, probably many years will elapse before such a
perfect sculler again appears.”
Trickett thinks Hanlan a steam engine in a shell, and was greatly surprised
at his opponent’s great turn of speed and easy style of propelling his shell over
the water. It is estimated that over £IOO,OOO changed hands on the race.
He returned to the colony in 1882, and subsequently received a well-merited
testimonial. He competed in the Punch Trophy race in October, winning the
second heat from Beach and H. Pearce; but in the final he finished last, behind
Rush, Beach and Laycock. The next month he rowed a match in waterman’s
skiffs against Clifford, the latter winning easily ; and at the Balmain Regatta was
second in the wager boat race, won by Laycock. Last January Largan forfeited
to Trickett, who since beat Laycock in the champion race at the National Anni-
versary Regatta. At the same gathering he and Laycock suffered defeat in the
double scull race in skiffs by Laycock and Largan, but were awarded the prize on
a foul. He is at present in good health, and resides on the Queensland coast.


Elias C. Laycock.
Elias 0. Layoook was born in May, 1846, in Pitt-street, New South
Wales, near the spot where Trickett’s hotel now stands. He is 6ft. l-|in. in
height, and rows at 1751b5. His father was the son of Capt. Lay cock, one of
the first of colonial pioneers, and in true English style we may claim for
Lay cock a good old ancestry dating back to the “ conquest of the island.”
One day Mr. Laycock found himself a ruined man, his losses being esti-
mated at £40,000. Young Laycock then commenced life on his own account.
First on a station in the Clarence district, where he was soon initiated into the
arts and shifts of rough country life. Then as a sailor to England ; as a gold
miner away upon'the Gilbert diggings, Gulf of Carpentaria. Then as a stockman
with cattle to Gippsland, Yictoria. Then he returned to Sydney to ship as
second mate on a coasting schooner, making trips to Adelaide, Melbourne, and
New Zealand. He again tried his hand at gold mining, but gave it up to com-
mence rowing in 1874, at a time in life when most rowers think of retiring and
making way for younger men ; his idea being that as he could “ ride a buck-
jumper, or work in a saw-pit or gold claim with most people, he should be able
also to hold his own on the water with most fellows.”
His opening engagement of importance was in 1874, when on the Clarence
River at Grafton, a regatta was organised, in which a prize of £2OO was offered
for a champion sculling race. Success did not crown Laycock’s efforts on this
occasion, the victor being Rush, who was followed home by the now celebrated
Edward Trickett, Laycock getting third place, and beating Hickey and Green,
both of whom had been Australian champions, and the latter well known by his
trip to England several years before. His next appearance as a sculler was at
the Balmain Regatta in 1874, when he again followed Trickett round the course.
We next heard of Laycock on the Queen’s Birthday, 1875, when he won the wager
boat race in the regatta on the Clarence River at Grafton, beating Rush, who
gave up on being collared. The colonial was after this matched against his for-
mer opponent, Trickett, for £lOO a side, the match being decided in September,
1875, on the Parramatta River at Sydney. Laycock suffered clef eat, ? and both men
were nearly swamped by the action of the following steamers. In November of
the same year Laycock had to put up with second place behind the same oppo-
nent at the Balmain Regatta.
He rowed at Balmain, in 1876, against Green and Mulholland, and, as might
have been expected, won easily.
January 25th is held as a fete day in Australia, that being the anniversary of
the colonization of Australia, and a regatta is usually held at Sydney on the
occasion. In this event, in 1877, he again pulled second to Trickett, who had
just returned from his victorious journey to England. In the Regatta at
Balmain, on the Prince of Wales’ birthday, in the same year, he was more
successful, however, winning the Champion Sculls, his nearest opponents being
Green and Mahalam. About this time he obtained his present position in
charge of the Quarantine Station at Shark Island, and shortly afterwards became
a married man.


S. EDWARDS.
E . LAYCOCK.




In July, 1878, he rowed G-. Solomon in heavy boats for =£6o. Asa previous
race between the two scullers resulted in a draw, consequent upon a foul, con-
siderable interest was centred in the event. Laycock, however, led from the
start and won easily. On Sept. 14, in the same year, Laycock was matched
against 0. Messenger, son of the well-known builder, for £IOO a side. The con-
test came off on the Paramatta River, and Laycock secured the verdict after a
close race. This race will long be remembered, in consequence of the disgraceful
scene of confusion caused by the steamers at the finish. Visiting Newcastle,
New Year’s Day, 1879, he was beaten in the watermen’s skiff race, principally
owing to his being handicapped by a very heavy boat.
At the National Anniversary Regatta, Jan. 26, 1879, in the professional
sculls, he beat Trickett, and created considerable consternation by showing the
champion of the world the right direction to the winning post. The crushing
defeat the champion then sustained has been variously accounted for, but, not-
withstanding all the excuses offered for Trickett, the result of the contest em-
boldened Laycock and his friends. The outcome of this success was a match
with Rush, which was brought to an issue on the Paramatta River in the fol-
lowing April. The stakes were £IOO, and Laycock won a good race by a length
and a half. Trickett now determined to have another “ go” at his late conqueror.
A match was accordingly arranged between the pair for £2OO a side. The scene
of action was again the Paramatta River at Sydney, and the date Aug. 30, 1879.
Once more the champion of the world left his rival in the rear, Only a week
later Laycock again tried conclusions with Rush, and again succeeded in van-
quishing that redoubtable oarsman after a capital struggle. The 9th of No-
vember ensuing witnessed the annual aquatic reunion at Balmain, in which, as
usual Laycock took part. ■On this occasion, in the professionel sculls, he met
W. Trickett arid Edwards, and he had to put up with third place, the other two
finishing first and second in the order named.
We now come to the Anniversary Regatta of the following year, which took
place on January 26th. Laycock, it will be remembered, won the Champion
Sculls at this meeting in 1879, and he again entered to compete for the silver belt
and gold medal which gives the title of champion of Australia, For the second
time he was successful, in defeating, amongst others, McLeer and Sullivan, who
finished 2nd and 3rd. The Colonial Sculler next went in for a novelty in boat-
racing. He was challenged by Pearce, a professional waterman, to row over the
Championship course on the Paramatta River, at Sydney, for £IOO a side. The
innovation consisted in the stipulation that the race should be contested in ordi-
nary waterman’s skiffs. In the clumsy craft he found his skill at fault, and
after rowing a plucky race under adverse circumstances he had to submit to de-
feat. This encounter took place in March, and Laycock only fulfilled one other
professional engagement prior to his visit to the old country. The date
of this event was May 29, and the scene Melbourne. The race was the inaugura-
tion of a Sculling Championship of Victoria, and was got up by the Victoria
Rowing Association. The prize was a £SO Challenge Cup and a sum of money.
The trophy had to be won thrice in succession, being held for two years against
all comers. Six of the best scullers in the colony entered for the event, and Lay-
cock’s opponents were S. Edwards, W. Greenland, J. Miller, O. Messenger, and
R. Edwards. Great interest was taken in this contest, and every yard of vantage
ground was occupied by ardent spectators. The struggle, nevertheless, was con-
sidered such a certainty for the Sydney representative (Laycock), that odds of
3to 1 offered on him went almost begging. A number of steamers followed the
race, which was started by Mr A. D. Michie. The men were sent off to a capi-
tal even beginning, S. Edwards at once cutting out the work, Messenger going
on second, Half a mile from the outset R. Edwards had taken the front place,
then came S. Edwards and Messenger, and Laycock next, about five lengths be


hind the leader. The last named began to draw up rapidly. S. Edwards kept
in Laycock’s water, and a bad foul occurred, which nearly settled Laycock’s
chance. He got away at length, having lost fifty yards. Once more the Sydney
sculler began to close up the gap, and rounding the long bend he passed Mes-
senger and quickly collared R. Edwards. A good race ensued for some distance
after which Laycock headed R. Edwards, and passed the judge a winner by a
length. Messenger did not finish, and none of the others were placed.
Soon after Laycock sailed for England, and lost no time in arranging several
races over the Thames Championship Course, from Putney to Mortlake, Octo-
ber 5, he easily beat T. Blackman; November 2, he conquered G. H. Hosmer with
equal ease ; November 6, he fairly romped away from J. H. Riley, and November
13 he received forfeit from J. Hawdon, with whom he had arranged his fourth
match on English waters. He returned to Sydney a few weeks before the Punch
Trophy was decided, and in that event he beat D. M‘Donald in the first division,
rowed second to Rush in the second trial, and rowed behind Beach in the fin al
his next appearance was in the champion race at the Anniversary Regatta, when
Edward Trickett finished in front of him, it is said that his boat was partly
swamped. In March last year he defeated Rush at Grafton for £ 1,000. He
broke his leg in September, but his splendid constitution and great care resulted
in a speedy recovery, and the development of fine form for the contest he was
matched to row with Hanlan, full particulars of which match appears in an-
other part of this work. His rowing weight is I2st 121bs.
Laycock is a more compactly-built man than Trickett, He has a fine, fair,
bearded Saxon face, bearing on it the stamp of courage and determination.
When in his ordinary attire he has by no means so neat an appearance as his
rival. He is careless of his looks, and is so deliberate in his movements that
one on cursorily meeting him would not be inclined to credit him with the vigor
and energy he undeniably possesses. It is only when seen in his jersey, ready
for a row, that his splendid proportions become strikingly apparent. In the
words of one of his most intimate friends, he “only wakes up when he gets into
his boat.”
Michael Rush.
Michael Rush’s performances on the water are so well known to nearly all
who take an interest in aquatics, it will be unnecessary for us to go into minute
details concerning the local champion, who has always endeavoured to uphold the
manly sport of rowing throughout his career. In a record written by Charon, of
the Sydney Mail, last year, that writer says : —•“ Personally Rush is one of the
best of good fellows. Possessing a fine, manly face, with cheery, pleasant ex-
pression, and being able to boast of just enough of his native brogue to swear by,
he is a worthy specimen of a genial, good-hearted Irishman. His height is 6 feet
1 inch, and as he will be only 38 next birthday, he may be considered com-
paratively a young man. His style of rowing is anything but taking to the eye ,
but, notwithstanding, he gets the pace out of his boat, What he lacks in skill is
fully compensated for by the powerful frame and strong muscular development.
He has not had the experience of his opponent, nor has he travelled the world
wide in search of foemen worthy of his steel, yet patiently and perseveringly he
has entered the lists ; and, lacking the skill and knowledge of his celebrated ad-
versary with alternate success he has battled with him.” To this we would add
that his rowing weight is about 12st 71bs to 12st lOlbs. His first match was
against the late P. Ooloun, whom he beat, but afterwards met with defeat several
times from that sculler. Thirteen years ago, he rowed for the first time in Syd-


BEACN




ney, at the regatta when he won two events ; and the following month, he and
Coloun defeated the brothers Trickett in a double sculling race, in skiffs. He
was next beaten by the then champion, W, Hickey, in skiffs, who refused to row
again in the same class of boats. But a match was rowed between Rush and R.
Hickey, ending in a victory for the first named. Rush then learnt to row in out-
riggers, and on the 19th November 1870, was beaten by 10 lengths, by W. Hickey,
for =£2oo a side and the championship. A month later, the same two rowed a match
in skiffs, Rush winning. In 187 3, they again met on the Parramatta, in out-
riggers, when Rush won by six lengths. The following year, at Grafton, he beat
Trickett, Lay cock, Hickey, Green, and others; but at the Grafton Regatta, 1874,
was beaten by Laycock and Solomon. In 1875, no response was made to a chal-
lenge of Rush’s, to row any man in the world, for £SOO a side, on the Clarence.
When Trickett returned from England, after beating Sadler, Rush threw out
another challenge, which resulted in the men rowing for the championship of the
world, the event being witnessed by 50,000 people. Rush led for about a mile,
when Trickett went to the fore, and finished 10 seconds in front of his opponent.
In 1879 he was beaten by Laycock, on the Paramatta, in outriggers, but the
finish was so close that the umpire’s decision was questioned, Five months later
Laycock beat him easily, over the same course. It was then said that Rush was
not in good rowing form. After Laycock’s return from England, Rush issued
another challenge, and the pair met on the Paramatta, in 1881, for £2OO a side
when the Clarence man won by 6 lengths, in 21 minutes—the fastest time re-
corded over the champion course. It was immediately following this that his
friends in Sydney presented him with plate to the value of £2OO, and entertained
him at a banqueji. He then rowed in the Walker Whiskey race, in which he was
beaten by Pearce and Power—his defeat being attributed to some defect in the
boat used by him. Rush and Power again met, the former staking £2OO to
£IOO with a similar result; but on the following Saturday Rush “ turned the
tables ”on Power. Then on the following Monday, he also defeated Pearce; but
two days later again succumbed to Laycock. At the Grafton regatta in May,
1882, he won the outrigger race very easily from Power, and his last appearance
was in the Punch Trophy race, in which he won both his divisions, beating
Pearce, Laycock, and I). M‘Donald; and the final heat from Beach, Trickett,
and Laycock.
William Beach.
William Beach was born in the county of Sussex, England, in 1861, and
came to this colony with his parents two years after. They setttled down at
Dapto, in the Illawarra district, where Beach followed the same profession as his
father, that of a blacksmith, About 16 months ago he came out as a sculler in a
handicap skiff race, rowed at Wooloomooloo Bay. This he won, carrying lOlbs.,
and beating P. W 7 ard, and J. M'Clerken in the final heat. At the Pyrmont re-
gatta, 1881, three weeks after, Beach, with 151bs handicap, rowed second to H.
Pearce, with 401bs. At the Anniversary regatta he was defeated by Neil
M‘Donald in the skiff race. In a match against the last named, for £IOO aside,
over the champion course, Beach came in an easy winner. He also defeated
George Solomon, same boats for £IOO aside. His next essay was to pull in a
light skiff, against Gascoigne in an outrigger, but he was easily defeated. After
this he met Charley Reynolds, the champion light skiff rower of Australia, On
the first day a foul took place, and the race had to be rowed over again, when
Beach proved the victor, after one of the grandest struggles ever seen on the Para-
matta River—Reynolds rowing on till he fell out of his boat exhausted. Beach


then for the first time, made his appearance in an outrigger, on the occasion
of the Punch Trophy, when ho. secured second place to Rush, Layoock and
Trickett being beaten, Returning to the light skiffs, he was matched against
Thomas Clifford, another Hapto Sculler, between whom several private races had
taken place before Beach came to Sydney. The match was for .£4OO, over the
champion course, and a good race ended in favour of Beach. At the anniversary
regatta, on the 26th January, this year, he started in the outrigger race, but his
boat swamped. Beach is sft. lOin. in height, and his rowing weight 12st, and
since his arrival has been under the care of the well-known trainer, T. Kelly,
Good judges announce him to be the “ coming champion sculler.” but we have
not seen him do any exceptionally good work.
C. Messenger
Hails from London, where his family are well-known in connection with aquatics
His father was a noted sculler and boatbuilder, and in 1854 won the champion
ship from T. Cole, which title he held for four years, when he was beaten by the
well-known sculler Harry Kelley. 0. Messenger, we believe, came to Victoria
some few years ago, where he frequently competed in regattas, and also in
matches. His principal performances in Sydney are:—ln a waterman’s skiff
race, at the Sydney National Regatta, he (with feather) rowed third to Power
(151bs) and Pearce (551bs). In the third division of the Walker Whiskey race,
he finished third to Rush and R. Edwards. At the Grafton 1881 regatta, he
started in the outrigger race against Rush and Laycock, and was badly beaten.
At the Mercury Bay (New Zealand) regatta he beat A White in an outrigger
race. At the late Anniversary regatta held in Sydney, he won an outrigger race
from Beach and Largan, after a “ chapter of accidents.” His rowing weight is
list.
Donald M'Donald
Was born at Ballarat, Victoria, but now hails from the Clarence River, and is a
worthy pupil of Michael Rush. He is 28 years of age, about sft Sin in height,
and rows at most lOst. 61b. It is only latterly that he has demonstrated his
real abilities, and there is not the slightest doubt that at the present time he is
the champion light-weight sculler of Australia. Though not what is usually
termed a muscular looking man, he is made of the right metal. He can row as
plucky a race as it is possible to wish, and he has the reputation of being a
“ sticker,” Already he has taken part in a number of races, the following of
which are the principal. His first appearance was in a race for youths under 18
years of age, at a regatta on the Clarence, in which he finished second. On the
same day, however, he and another won a double scull race for amateurs. He
then rowed in a farmers’ race, at Grafton, and finished second. The same day
in company with J. M‘Millan, he beat Elias Laycock and Gregory in a pair-oar
race. Then the same two won a double-sculling race at Rocky Mouth; and row-
ing over to Harwood Island, where a regatta was held on the same day, he won
with his mate a pair-oar race. Immediately after finishing they rowed back to
Rocky Mouth, to row a third race; but the news of their victory preceding

them, they were protested against and not allowed to start. At Lawrence re-
gatta shortly after, he won single and double sculling races. Rowed a match in
skiffs with J. Greenless and was beaten. Afterwards he and J. M'Kinnon won
a double-sculling race at Rocky Mouth regatta, beating Laycook and Gregory,
and on the same day beat Elias Layoock in a race in watermen’s boats. Next
won a single race at Harwood At the following Grafton regatta M‘Donald won
the single sculling on a foul from Lyons ; and at same regatta with J. M‘Millan
beat Lyons and Solomon. In a four-oared crew with M. Rush, M'Kinnon, and
M‘Millan, for £IOO prize, was beaten by Laycock, Pearce, Solomon, and Lyons.
Then M'Donald competed at the Balmain regatta in a double sculling race with
M'Millan, but was beaten by Lyons and Solomon. At the same regatta he
rowed in a four-oar gig race, and won. Taking a trip south, he rowed at the
Shoalhaven regatta, and won a single sculling race, beating Armstrong and
M‘Lean. At this regatta he was beaten with W. Connors in a double sculling
race. Returning to Sydney he rowed Lynch for £25 a side, and won. When
he came back to the Clarence he won a scull race, and with his brother Neil, a
pair-oar race. The same two started at Lawrence in a double sculling race ;on
which occasion their skiff filled and sank. Donald next beat Prank Hughes at
Rocky Mouth for £3O a side. Visited the Richmond, and was defeated by
Colone. At Rooky Mouth, beat his brother Neil and M. Black in two races, the
same day. That year at the same place, was beaten by M. Rush, though he
rowed a dead heat with W. Triokett. His next performance was against the
Victorian sculler Edwards, by whom he was beaten. At the Richmond River
regatta, a couple of months later, he was beaten by his brother Neil in a sculling
race on the same day. Next beat M. M‘Mahon on the Clarence, for £ls a side,
and at Grafton, he and Neil defeated Rush and M‘Mahon. Then at Rocky
Mouth beat Rush and his brother in a handicap; and the same day, the
M‘Donald’s pulled off the double sculling race. At the last Grafton regatta he
won the handicap sculling race (carrying 251bs) from M‘Mahon (feather), Rush
(401bs), and two others; and at the same gathering, with his brother, won the
double sculling race from Rush and Armstrong (of the Richmond). Next started
in the second heat of the “ Punch Trophy,” finishing behind Rush and Laycock.
Afterwards, also at Sydney, beat Perkins, for £75 a side. At the Balmain re-
gatta, the same month, carried 201bs to the front in the handicap sculling race,
Clifford (401bs) second, Solomon (201bs) third. His last performance was against
Largan, whom he defeated, for a stake of £IOO a side.
Robert Edwards
Of Victoria, who was born on the 2nd September, 1860, is the second son of
James Edwards, of Princes Bridge, Melbourne. His first race of any conse-
quence was at the age of seventeen, when ho defeated A. Titler for £5 a side.
On the Ist June, 1878, he beat W. Greenland of Melbourne over the Victorian
champion course for £25 a side. A match was arranged for the sth March of
the following year, with S. Sullivan of Sydney for £IOO aside; the Victorian led
from the start and won easily. On the 22nd of the same month, R. Edwards
and his brother Sydney started in the all-comers’ race at the Melbourne regatta,
against C. Messenger, then champion of Victoria, and three others; Messenger
led for the first mile when he was passed by the Edwardses, Sydney finishing
first, Robert second. In the following November R. Edwards won the pro-
fessional race for all under 21 years of age at the Balmain Regatta, and two
hours after started in the race for all comers, but after rowing two hundred yards


broke a scull. On June sth, 1880, Edwards started for the Professional Sculling
Race over a four mile course, for a trophy given by the Victorian Rowing As-
sociation; Elias Laycock, S. Edwards, 0. Messenger, W. Greenland, and J. Miller
also competed; R. Edwards took the lead for the first mile, when Laycock went
to the front. Laycock finished first, R. Edwards second. On the following
Monday Messenger and Edwards met over the same course for £SO a side. The
latter won easily. Laycock through the win he had, was enabled to visit Eng-
land, and he left three days after the last race.
His next performance was when he had turned 21 years old in September
1881, he competed for the Walker Whiskey Trophies. In the first heat he
finished second to Michael Rush, and defeating Messenger for the fourth time.
On the following Wednesday Edwards finished second to Elias Laycock, Wil-
liam Trickett third in the second series of heats. The final heat took place two
days later, when Edwards saving himself for his match race with Donald
M‘Donald on the following Monday, finished fourth. In the match for £IOO
aside with M‘Donald, Edwards, after *one of the severest races ever seen on the
Paramatta River, won by a length.
The Victorian took a trip to Launceston early in the next year, and won the
all-comers’ sculling race at the Tamar regatta. Rowing in the open pair and
four-oared races he was unsuccessful.
The Victorian next went with Mr A. W. Fittes to Sydney, and piloted him
through the Ist and 4th Krug contests, but on neither occasion did he get a
match made, although he on the last trip started in the open sculling race at
Balmain Regatta, but had to give up through want of condition. In March last
Edwards joined Edward Hanlan as trainer for the Laycock race, and rowed with
the champion at the Manly Exhibitions. Edwards started at scratch with Pearce
in the Nepean handicap race but was fouled by the latter and lost all chance of
success.
Fragmenta.
Hanlan says of the Yarra, that it is like a crooked tree, and he will ever
remember it for the sunken rock that took a piece out of his boat.
When rowing on the Nepean, in training for the match with
Laycock, he was paddling up and stopped opposite a certain part, from
which he was going to row to another, a half-mile distance; as
a boat previously to him reached the first post, Laycock and his
brother were rowing up at a good pace. As Hanlan was fixing his
watch to time himself, he perceived two men sitting on the bank, when the
following dialogue took place. Broad Irish on bank : “ And be sure who is that
as is just gone up 1 ” Hanlan; “That’s Laycock of course.” B. I. : “And what time
will Hanlan be out V’ Hanlan: “He is out, and where I am.” B. I.: “You,Hanlan!
to blazes with you ! what, are you gammoning us; that be blowed, you are not
Hanlan.” “ Well gentlemen if you don’t believe me I cant help it;” and with that
Hanlan went off at a rattling pace like a shot from a gun, doing the half-mile in
2.45 min.
Hanlan says that the best photos he ever had, were those from the studio of
the celebrated Tuttle & Co., Melbourne.

AN ADVERTISING AGENT,
A DVERTISING is the business man’s breath. If the Adver-
tisements are prosy and never changed, you can be sure his
pulse is low and needs attention.

Improve each shining hour.
And gather honey all the day
From every opening flower.
Advertising is to business what food is to existence ; it should
be regular, adequate, and varied.

The CALIGRAPH WRITING MACHINE
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?
What P. T, Barnum thinks of the Caligraph.
Waldemere, Bridgeport, Conn., April 27th, 1883.
My friends complain that my writing is unintelligible, but I can
print so plainly with the Caligraph that “he who runs may
read ” provided he can read when he stands still! Besides, the
Caligraph is used with more ease and comfort than the pen and with
little practice it will accomplish vastly more than anything in this
line, which this wonderful age has produced,
P. T. Barnum.
