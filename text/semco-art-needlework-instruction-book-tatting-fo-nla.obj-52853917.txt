Introduction
This No. 7 Semco Instruction Book completes
the series of Semco Text Books, which serve as
reliable guides to Art Needlework in the more
familiar types of Embroidery and Crochet.
The increasing interest in Tatting and the lack
of an up-to-date book dealing with this work will
render this book of great value and interest to
those desiring to adopt an art of great beauty,
simplicity, and utility.
"Modern Tatting” is more dainty and varied
than that practised by previous generations, and
by its use the beauty and value of any article can
be greatly enhanced more quickly and easily than
by the better known crochet.
The materials required are a shuttle and
suitable threads. For the latter we recommend
Semco Mercer Crochet Cotton ,
made in Australia.
To a novice the quick deft movement of> a
skilled worker may appear to be very complicated,
but in reality Tatting is one of the simplest of all
handicrafts, as there are only two stitches to be
learned.
Work of individual character always shows to
advantage, and the original designs and practical'
hints in this book will, we hope, be of real value
to workers.

The Art of Tatting
HOW TO MAKE
THE STITCHES
The only materials required for
crochet hook and cotton to suit the
thread for practice.

of the thread through the hole in
the centre, tie firmly, and cut off the loose end. Wind the thread
around the block by pressing the thread through the points. Wind
firmly, and do not allow the thread to project beyond the edges of the
shuttle, as this causes the points to open.
The Stitches.
The stitches are composed of the first half stitch and the second half
stitch. These are called a double stitch. Although the right hand is
more active, it is really the left hand which forms the stitches.
The whole secret of tatting is in the flexibility of the second finger
of the left hand which draws the loop or stitches along the shuttle
thread.
First Half of Double Stitch.
Having filled the shuttle, hold it lightly between the thumb and the
first and second fingers of the right hand, with the thread coming from
the lower end (the right side when held horizontally). Take the end
of the thread between the thumb and -first finger of the left hand and
pass thread around all the fingers. Bring it forward and cross it with
the end, under the thumb, where it is held firmly. (Fig. 1.) The first
and second fingers of the left hand must be two inches apart, as the
shuttle passes over and under the thread between these fingers. It is
this thread with which the stitches are formed, so that they will slide
along the shuttle thread. Do not have more than five inches of thread
between the hands.
Now commence to form the stitches. Slide the shuttle forward
over the thread between the first and second fingers of left hand, then
bring it back niider the thread. (This is where the trick of tatting
comes in.) Draw the shuttle sharply towards the right horizontally.
Hold it quite tight, at the same time relax the second finger of
the left hand, so that a loop or stitch is formed on the shuttle thread
(Pig 2) by the thread that is around the fingers. (If the stitch
is formed by the shuttle thread it will not draw up.) Then with a little
jerk of the second finger draw the loop along the shuttle thread and
hold it firmly under the thumb. This completes the first half of the
double stitch. Practise this stitch (called a single stitch) until several
have been made (Pig. 3) without any knots, and draw up into a ring
(Pig. 4) by pulling gently on the shuttle thread. Do not draw the
stitches up too tightly, but hold firmly. A little practice with this
stitch, before going further, will aid in acquiring the even tension
necessary for neat and accurate work.


The Art of Tatting.—How to Make the Stitches (continued)
Second Half of Stitch.
Hold the shuttle as before, but with the thread around and over the
fingers of the right hand (Fig*. 5.)
Slide the shuttle forward under the thread between the first and
second fingers of the left hand. Bring it back over the thread and
through the loop formed by the thread around the right hand. Slip
the thread off the right hand. Draw the shuttle thread tight and at
the same time relax the second finger of the left hand, to form a loop
or stitch on the shuttle thread as before. Then with the second finger
draw the stitch close beside the last stitch. This completes the double
stitch.
Practise the two stitches separately, and then alternately as they
are used in working. When several double stitches have been made
(Pig. 3) draw up into a ring. Make a number of rings with double
stitches, to gain proficiency, before going on to the next step. The time
spent in practice will be well repaid.


The Art of Tatting.—How to Make the Stitches (Continued)
Picots are loops of thread around the edges of rings of tatting. They
add much to the beauty of the work, making it light and lacy. Picots
are used for joining the rings and sections of tatting, and make a great
variety of designs possible. Very long picots are not desirable: short
ones are neater and firmer, and wear better, than long ones.
To Make a Ficot.
Merely leave a little space (J inch) on the thread between two double
stitches, which when drawn up will form a little loop. Practice will
soon produce regularity in the size of picots.
How to Join, the Bings.
This is done with the last plcot of the previous ring. With a crochet
hook (or pin head) draw the thread on the left hand up through the plcot
in a long loop through which pass the shuttle, from right to left, and
draw tight; ease the loop along the shuttle thread with second finger
of left hand, as in making a stitch. When the join is complete pull the
shuttle thread to make sure that the rings will draw up. Sometimes it
helps if the lower part of the loop of thread around the fingers (between
thumb and little finger, is gently pulled. Do this also when more thread
is required for working.
Tatting with Two Threads.
One thread only is used when a design is composed entirely of rings,
but two are required when there are chains as well in a design. Tie
the ends of thread from shuttle and ball together. Make a ring with
the shuttle thread (say 5 ds 1 p 10 ds 1 p 5 ds). Turn it downwards
and hold firmly between thumb and first finger of left hand. Place the
ball thread across the fingers (first and second two inches apart) and
twist the thread twice around the little finger to keep it firm (Fig. 6).
Make the stitches with this thread by passing shuttle over and under
it as before, always making the stitches with the thread on the left
hand. Make about 10 ds, and draw them up as close as possible to
the ring. Turn the ring upwards and make another, joining it to
second p of first ring. Picots are formed on chains in the same way
as on rings.
Practise a length of rings and chains to gain proficiency in the use
of two threads.


The Art of Tatting.—How to Make the Stitches (Continued).
To Join the Thread.
When new thread is required tie a neat firm knot as close as possible
to the last ring, but do not cut off the ends until several rings have
been made, as the strain is apt to loosen the knot. Should a knot occur
in the thread, cut the thread and tie a knot close up to the last ring.
Knots prevent the stitches from running- smoothly.
Semco Mercer. Cottons and Pearl Cottons are so smooth and free from
knots that the stitches slide along the thread almost of their own accord,
thus making the work quicker to do.
Foundation Units from which designs are made.
These figures illustrate the various units described in the foregoing pages.
A, a ring half closed.
B, a ring completely closed.
C, a ring with picots.
D, rings joined together with picots.
E, a clover leaf formed by making three rings joined as

Some Helpful Hints
The thread used in tatting is a very important factor in
the appearance of well finished work. .For best results use only
the best thread.
It must be firmly twisted and smooth and even. Semco
Mercer Crochet Cottons and Semco Pearl Cotton No. 12 are
ideal for tatting, as they are so beautifully smooth and even.
These threads may bo obtained in all colors as well as in white.
Colored Tatting is charming when it harmonises with colored
embroidery.
Dainty Clean Work. Much of the daintiness of tatting
depends on its perfect freshness. Even the best work loses
much of its charm if it is at all soiled. As the work is held
so firmly, it very soon becomes soiled, unless the hands are per-
fectly clean. To ensure this, always rub the fingers with
pumice stone before starting to tat. To test the whiteness of
the work, place it against the ball of thread.
To Wash Tatting. This must be done very carefully.
Soak the work in warm soapy water, to which a little borax has
been added. Rub very gently any spots or marks. Do not
wring with the hands, but squeeze the soapy water out. Pass
through a wringer in a folded white towel, and rinse in two
clear waters. Fold in a towel and pass through wringer again.
Spread on a white towel to dry.
To Iron Tatting. Tatting should be ironed when nearly
dry. With tips of fingers gently pull the work into shape.
Place on a well-padded ironing board, cover with a thin cloth,
and press carefully. Never rub an iron over unprotected
tatting.
finishing Edges of linen.
Always use Semco No. 12 Pearl Cotton, white or colored,
for double crocheting the edges of all linen before sewing on
the tatting. The appearance of the work is greatly improved
if the linen is soaked for half an hour in water to which a
little borax is added, and ironed when wet. This gives both
linen and crochet a beautiful gloss.
Embroidery and Tatting.
When a tatted border or edging is to be applied to embroid-
ered linen It is advisable to first work the embroidery and
buttonhole or crochet the edges of the linen, and then wash in
lukewarm water and rinse in clear water to which borax has
been added. Borax lends sufficient stiffness to the work.
Embroidered linen should never be starched. When half dry
iron the work on the wrong side only, on a well padded table.
Sew the tatting to the edge of linen by the picots, and always
join the work so that the pattern is continuous. When finished
press the whole article again on the wrong side under a damp
cloth. Iron until quite dry.

Medallion Border for Lace D’oyley


Tatted Border for Table Mats
Table mats with tatted borders have an airy fragility which enhances
the beauty of the table appointments. This border is most effective and
is easily made, one thread only being 1 used. It is 15 inches wide, and
is worked in three rows, each row consisting of a double row of rings,
round and long.
This edge is suitable for use in preparing table sets consisting of six
small mats for goblets or glasses, six mats for dinner and dessert mats,
and a table centre. The centres of the mats should be spoked and
finished with double crochet, or they may be buttonholed.
Use Semco Mercer Cotton No. 60 for larger mats and No. 70 for the
smaller mats.
