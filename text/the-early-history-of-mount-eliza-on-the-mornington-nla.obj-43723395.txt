Mount Eliza
Its Early History and Settlement
CHAPTER I.
In 1770 Captain Cook hoisted the Union Jack in Botany
Bay and proclaimed New South Wales a British possession.
After he left nothing was done about esablishing a colony
until 1787, when a fleet under Captain Arthur Phillip brought
out a large number of convicts and settled them at Botany
Bay.
In 1795 Captain John Hunter was made the Governor of
New South Wales, as the whole eastern side of the continent
as far south as Bass’s Strait was still to be called for half a cen-
tury. During his administration Surgeon Bass and Lieuten-
ant Flinders, sailing from Sydney in a small boat, first entered
Western Port, on 4th January, 1798. They remained only a
short time and returned to Sydney, but two years later, 1800,
Lieutenant Grant in the brig “Lady Nelson,” explored the
coast as far as Cape Schank, which he so named after his
friend, Capt. John Schank, who had designed the “Lady Nel-
son.”
The following year, 1801, Grant again visited this coast,
and, entering Western Port, planted a small garden.
In 1802 Grant was succeeded by Lieutenant Murray in
the command of the “Lady Nelson,” and in February of that
year he sailed the brig through the “rip” and anchored in what
has since been known as Port Phillip. Murray landed some-
where near where Sorrento lies, and the huge headland along
the shore reminding him of Arthur’s Seat, near Edinburgh,
he so named it. He also saw, and named, Swan Island.


Murray spent three weeks there exploring the Peninsula,
where he saw many natives, and he then returned to Sydney.
Two months later—April, 1802—Flinders, who had been ex-
ploring Bass’s Strait, arrived again off the coast and entered
Port Phillip, mistaking it at first for Western Port, which, as
before stated, he had visited with Bass in 1798.
Murray and Flinders both made such favourable reports
of the country round this new harbour of Port Phillip that the
English Government decided to form a settlement here, and
they sent out two vessels, the “Calcutta” and “Ocean,” carry-
ing about 300 convicts and a few settlers, under the command
of Lieutenant-Governor Collins. The “Calcutta” arrived in
Port Phillip in October, 1803, and the party landed near Sor-
rento, where they made an encampment. After fifteen weeks,
however, during which he caused an exploration to be made
round the coast of the harbour, Collins decided that the place
was unsuitable, broke up the settlement, and re-embarked for
Tasmania—or, as it was then called, Van Diemen’s Land
We may perhaps be thankful for this decision of Collins,
which prevented this locality from becoming a permanent con-
vict settlement. During the fifteen weeks that the encampment
was on the Peninsula, three events of historical interest took
place, namely, (Ist) the birth of the first white child on 25th
November, 1803, who was named William James Hobart
Thorne; (2nd) the first marriage, on 28th November, 1803, the
contracting parties being Richard Garratt, a convict, and
Hannah Harvey, a free woman; and (3rd) the escape of three
convicts. Two of these were never heard of again, and pro-
bably perished, but the other was the famous William Buckley
who, making friends with the blacks, lived with them on the
shores of the harbour for about thirty years before he was dis-
covered.
We can now skip to the date of January, 1827, the inter-
vening years yielding nothing of much interest, although a few
vessels had straggled in and out of the Bay, but without es-
tablishing any settlement. In January, 1827, however, Messrs.
Gellibrand and John Batman came over from Van Diemen’s
Land and applied to the authorities in Sydney for a grant of
land on Western Port for a pastoral settlement. This was re


fused, but Batman was not discouraged, and in 1835, he char-
tered a vessel in Launceston, landed in Pt. Phillip, and, ne-
gotiating with the native chiefs, purchased from them 600,000
acres in exchange for a few blankets, axes, knives, and other
articles. Although this gigantic transaction was not sanc-
tioned by the Home Government, Batman’s enterprise was the
means of establishing a small settlement in Pt. Phillip, and
from it eventually sprang the City of Melbourne. After
about a year, namely in 1836, Captain Lonsdale arrived to act
as Lieutenant-Governor of the new settlement. He came in
the ship “Rattlesnake,” Capt. Hobson, and from these two
gentlemen the names of Pt. Lonsdale and Hobson’s Bay were
derived. The total inhabitants around Pt. Phillip were then,
at the end of 1836, only 177 white people, and about 700 blacks.
Hobson thoroughly surveyed the harbour, and in course
of this undertaking named the two prominent heights on the
east side Mt. Martha, after the wife of Capt. Lonsdale, and
Mt. Eliza, after the wife of John Batman.
Thus comes in 1836 the first historical recognition of that
landmark in the Peninsula, the character and growth of which
it is the object of this booklet to relate.


CHAPTER II.
At the present time the name Mt. Eliza has come to be
used in more than one sense, and not only denotes the highest
peak of the eminence but also the whole locality, the Shire
Riding of that name, and, in a restricted sense, the little settle-
ment immediately surrounding the store and post office. Geo-
graphically speaking, the Mount, though of very modest height,
has a considerable area, and really extends from Oliver’s Hill
on the north for about 4 miles along the coast, from which it
gradually rises in more or less uneven elevations for a couple
of miles inland when, upon reaching its maximum height, it
abruptly drops, almost precipitously, to flat, low-lying land.
While the greater part of this area is incorporated in the
Shire Riding of Mt. Eliza, a considerable portion is in the Mor-
uington Shire, the division, of course, being at Boundary Road.
The accompanying map shows approximately its full ex-
tent ; and also indicates by the darker shading where it reaches
its greatest elevation. The highest point is where the
cross appears, and is about 600 feet above sea level.
In the following pages the whole area thus shown is cov-
ered by the general term Mt. Eliza, the attractions, early his-
tory, and gradual development of which they aim at recording.
From a geologist’s point of view the Mount presents many
features of interest, and serves to bear out the remark that is
sometimes heard that Australia, instead of being a young con-
tinent, is really one of the oldest. The bedrock of the country
forming the eastern slope of the Mount, to the 3-chain road, is
that known as of Ordovician age —the second oldest series in
the stratified rocks of the earth. From the 3-chain road, east-
ward and southward, this strata extends to an unknown dis-
tance, and is overlain by later tertiary deposits.
During the period when this Ordovician and the subse-
quent Silurian beds were being laid down, the earth’s crust was
undergoing many and violent changes. Rapid cooling of the
interior caused many shrinkages, and the crust had to adapt
itself to a smaller compass, producing much crumpling. This


strata, and the next succeeding strata, show traces of many
contortions. During that period, too, the strata was frequently
intruded by granite from below, and here is the explanation,
largely, of the formation of the Mount. An examination of
the rock face in the large quarry near Moorooduc station shows
the strata so tilted as to be almost perpendicular. The rock
there is mainly fine-grained yellow sandstone, with bands of
bluish-grey and black shales and quartzites. Granite dykes
have penetrated through these here and there, and the heat
from the contact changed the character of the sandstone in
many places, and to a depth varying with the thickness of the
intrusive granite, hardening and vitrifying the sandstone.
The stimmit of the Mount consists of a granite mass, here
and there exposed through the overlying detritus, which forms
the surface soil. The granite is of good quality, a typical
granite-quartz, felspar, and black (biolite) mica, closely re-
sembling the celebrated Harcourt stone. This granite mass
extends out to, and beneath, the floor of Port Phillip, and is ex-
posed in the beds of all the creeks draining the Mount, as well
as in parts forming sharp headlands on the Bay. At some of
the latter places its decomposition into clay can be readily ob-
served.
On the N.E. slope of the Mount, near the Sweetwater Creek
in the neighbourhood of the reservoir, there is an outcrop of
blue slate. This appears to be identical with an outcrop on
Mount Martha, near Pt. Nepean Road, which is highly fossili-
ferous and of Lower Ordovician age.
The country between the summit of the Mount and the
coast is covered with later Tertiary deposits, and forms a pic-
turesque undulating surface, broken here and there by the
valleys of several watercourses, which drain into the Bay.
The soil everywhere being of a light and shallow nature,
it is not to be expected that trees of any great size should be
found, but there was, nevertheless at one time no lack of good,
useful timber on much of the ground, and though repeated
fellings, to say nothing of frequent bush fires, have greatly
thinned them, there are still well represented many species of
Eucalypt, Casuarina (sheoak), Banksia, Acacia, and other
trees, while as for the smaller vegetation the native heath and
innumerable wild flowers can favourably compare in quantity
and variety with those of almost any locality in Victoria.


CHAPTER III.
In the year 1836 the small community of Englishmen at
Eearbrass—as the settlement on the Yarra was then called, but
which was to develop into the city of Melbourne—thought it
desirable to establish a Mission station for the blacks, and this
was put under the control of Mr. G. Langhome, who had as
assistant a young man named John Thomas Smith. A man of
many parts was this Mr. Smith, who was in after years to be-
come widely known in connection with the municipal and other
affairs of Melbourne, of which he was for seven years the
Mayor. Among his many attributes he must have possessed
a discriminating eye for picturesque scenery and desirable lo-
calities, for, notwithstanding the wide choice of land at his
command, it was at Mt. Eliza that he made extensive acquire-
ments. Visiting the neighbourhood, doubtless in connection
with his duties, the delightful prospect from the summit of the
Mount and the many natural advantages and beauties which
this locality possessed must have duly impressed him, as he
very early selected considerable areas. The exact date when
he first came here and the nature of his first tenure are not
known, as until Victoria was proclaimed a separate colony, in
August, 1850, no actual sale of Crown lands was made on Mt.
Eliza. The new Government, however, at once had proper
surveys made, and a surveyor named Permein compiled the first
Government map of the Peninsula, surveying the lands into
lots of approximately 640 and 320 acres. Where roads, or
tracks, already existed the subdivisions were often necessarily
of rather more irregular areas. This plan of Permein’s was
approved by the Government in June, 1854, and in Septem-
ber of the same year the first auction sale of Crown lands at
Mt. Eliza was held. At this sale, Mr. J. T. Smith bought for
£1 an acre the two blocks he had previously selected. One
of them was 280 acres on the coast, known since as “Nyora,”
on which he put up a small cottage near the sea and let the
property to a tenant named Knight. In 1859 this tenant was
succeeded by Mr. Henry Cabdy Wells, the father and grand-
father of the many well-known residents of that name in
Frankston. Mr. Wells was a Wiltshire man from the town of
Devizes, where his father, well known in the coaching world
as Dick Wells, drove the four-horse coach across Salisbury


Plain in the days when encounters with highwaymen were not
uncommon.
Mr. Henry Cabdy Wells had a family of thirteen children,
of whom the eldest, Mrs. Kelly, who was born at Pt. Nepean
in 1845 , died only recently (1926). Of the others, Mr. Charles
Wells, now an octogenarian, and Messrs. Frank Octavus, Ben-
jamin, Decimus, and Richard, are all alive and resident in the
district. Upon leasing the property from Mr. J. T. Smith, Mr.
Wells, with the help of his elder sons, then only lads, began to
grow wheat and to plant a vineyard. Considerable work was
done in preparing the land and planting vines. Cartloads of
crushed bones were brought from Schnapper Point as a fer-
tilizer, and the young vines themselves were obtained from
near Flemington, where Mr. John Thomas Smith at that time
had a good garden and vineyard. The enterprise, however, had
to be abandoned for lack of capital to carry it on, although
while it lasted some very excellent grapes were produced.
Shortly after the Wells family had become his tenants, Mr.
Smith started to build the house “Nyora” for his own use, and
young Charles Wells carted the firewood with which to burn
the bricks for the chimneys. The clay was obtained from the
foreshore of the little adjoining bay, called Canadian Bay, and
the bricks were made by a man named Sandy McCoy. “Cana-
dian Bay” derived its name from the fact that three Canadians
were camped there, engaged in cutting and shipping firewood.
They were J. Hodgins, McCurley and Jones, whose families
have remained in the vicinity of Mt. Eliza and Somerville.
Great quantities of firewood, principally sheoak, were cut and
carted to the beach of Canadian Bay, where it was taken out
in boats to the schooner “Liverpool,” anchored half a mile
from the shore, and by her shipped to Sandridge.
When the bungalow at “Nyora” was finished, Mr. Smith
often resided there during the rest of his life, but at his death
it passed into the hands of Mr. J. L. Purves, the well-known
Melbourne barrister, and still later was bought by Mr. Henry
Slaney. It is now being subdivided as a community settle-
ment under the name of “Ranelagh.”


The other of Mr. John Thomas Smith’s purchases at
auction in 1854 was about 400 acres of the highest part of the
Mount. This land extended for over a mile along the Boun-
dary Road, right down to where Moorooduc Railway Station is
now, and included the whole of what used to be known as the
“ Lower Paddock.” The old erection from which the Tower
Paddock derived its name was made for the purpose of a very
early trigonometrical survey of the district. It was already
there when Permein did his work, and was one of four similar
erections on Mt. Dandenong, Mr. Eliza, Mt. Martha, and
Arthur’s Seat respectively, all four being almost in the same
straight line. It consisted of logs of timber laid crossways,
and it rose to a height of some 30 feet, the top being accessible
by means of three flights of ladder. Although bush fires, and
age, have long ago destroyed it, its actual site can still be seen,
where one or two of the old logs lie embedded in the soil. Many
of our older residents remember it well, and, as children, have
often climbed it. From its top, as indeed from anywhere near
its site, one of the most delightful panoramic views imaginable
was obtainable. Across ten miles or so of undulating country
Western Port can be traced, with French Island stretching
along it, and the Gippsland mountains on the horizon. To the
south is a wide vista of open country, terminating in Arthur’s
Seat and the hills near the ocean beach, while along the whole
western side Port Phillip sparkles and glitters with a blue-
ness which matches even the Mediterranean. It is in this
Smith’s, or “Tower,” Paddock that the great outcrop of granite
occurs, and which has been, to some extent, quarried for local
requirements.
It must be borne in mind that within a year after the pro-
clamation of Victoria as a colony, the discovery of gold was
made, and was quickly followed by a great influx of people
from Europe and elsewhere. The inhabitants of Melbourne
increased rapidly, and it is therefore not surprising that the
Mt. Eliza land sale attracted a good many buyers. Next to
“Nyora” on the coast a section of 290 acres was bought by a
sea captain named Lintot, who built a house there and named it
“Earimil.” The Lintots retained this estate for nearly 30
years, after which it was purchased by Mrs. T. J. Sumner, but
when her daughter married Dr. Charles Ryan (now Sir Charles
Ryan) they took it over and retained possession until a few


years ago, when it, too, passed into the hands of a land specu-
lator for subdivisional purposes.
The Lintots were widely known in these parts and were
everywhere very popular. The captain still preserved some
connection with his old profession by keeping a small yacht,
anchored in the cove near his house, and in this he delighted
to go out for a day’s fishing. Fish were very plentiful in those
days, and it was an everyday matter in the season to get a
boat-load of schnapper off Lintot’s reef. Larger fish came into
the Bay more frequently also, and Mr. Charles Wells, who used
sometimes to accompany the captain, recounts how he helped
one day as a boy to land a schnapper which, when cleaned and
decapitated, turned the scale at 30 lbs. The delight of that
catch has remained with him for 65 years!
from the southern boundary of “Earimil” down to Gun-
yong Creek lies the property of 250 acres now known as
“Moondah.” It was first owned, in the fifties of last century,
by a Mr. Thos. Fulton and others, and it was not until 1888
that Mr. James Grice bought the land and built the large house
which he has occupied ever since. The name “Moondah” was
taken from the blackfellow’s name for a creek running through
a station in Queensland belonging to Mr. Grice, and it means
“black snake.”
On the other side of Gunyong Creek, and extending nearly
to Manmangah Creek a, block of land, 280 acres in extent, was
first purchased from the Crown by William Robertson who sold
it in 1860 to Mr. Richard Grice, the father of Mr. James Grice,
of “Moondah.” Mr. Richard Grice had come out to Australia
first in 1839, and when he bought this land, was living at
Schnapper Point. He immediately set about building the
large residence which still adorns the property, but it was not
finished until a couple of years later, when he gave the place the
name of “Manyong,” taking for the purpose the first and last
syllables of the names of the two creeks near by. For some
time past this well-known estate has been owned and occupied
by Mr. Thomas Baker, who has further improved it.
All the foregoing properties are bounded on the east by the
Pt. Nepean Road, which was allocated in its present course
under the original survey, though for many years and until


the estates became properly fenced the actual track by which
coaches and other vehicles travelled often deviated to the right
or left. Opposite them on the eastern side of the road and ex-
tending back to the Tower paddock the same Thomas Fulton
already mentioned obtained a Crown grant to 210 acres. This
embraces what is now (1926) being made into a golf course in
connection with “Ranelagh,” and also extends on to the Gun-
yong Creek. Fulton soon sold the land in various areas, one
of the first purchasers being Mr. John Cahill, who came to the
colony in 1841, and after trying other districts settled down
on this spot in 1854. He bought the end of Fulton’s paddock,
opposite where the church was afterwards built, and he erected
a comfortable double-fronted house near the road. The house,
and the garden surrounding it, in which were willows, poplars
and other English trees, besides vines and fruit trees, have long
since disappeared. There Mr. Cahill’s family was brought up,
the eldest son who is still living being now 82 years of age.
Two of the daughters are the Miss Cahills residing in Franks-
ton.
Beyond the creek the place now known as Mitchell’s was
bought and built on by Mr. West, whose family long lived
there. They had a good vegetable and fruit garden, all of
which was worked by spade alone, and the son, Jim West, oc-
casionally drove a spring cart-load of produce all the way to
the Melbourne market. It may seem strange to us now that
excellent grapes were among the fruit grown, vines being
planted generally by the early settlers.
A little further still, opposite the entrance to the lane divid-
ing “Earimil” and “Moondah,” can be seen to-day a few old
exotic trees and a mound of old, broken bricks. In the mid-
fifties those trees were planted around the cottage in which
lived Mr. and Mrs. James Wood and their young family. Mr.
Wood was a cripple and died soon afterwards, but his widow
lived on there until 1880, universally known and respected in
the district. In 1866 one of her sons, John Thomas Wood,
bought part of the same paddock in which was his mother’s
cottage, built a house just below the Totver paddock, which
he called “Hartley Cottage,” and planted the fine rows of pine-
trees which to-day surround it. Two of his children, Mr. C.
E. Wood and Mrs. J- Smethurst, still live in the neighbour-
hood with their children, who thus represent the fourth genera


tion of a family always identified with Mt. Eliza, and held in
esteem by its inhabitants.
Close to Mrs. Wood’s was another cottage owned and
lived in by Mr. W. H. Hobson, who was the Government
Ranger, an office equivalent to Shire Secretary. He also owned
land higher up the Mount, where he afterwards lived, his first
cottage becoming the vicarage of the Rev. Mr. Thompson, the
first clergyman in the district. Lower down, towards Schnap-
per Point, lived Mr. Henry Martin, who came there first in
1861, and whose son still lives near by.
It will be seen from the foregoing list of settlers that quite
a little community existed in that locality fifty years ago, and
it was much more cultivated then than it is now. They were
comfortable little homesteads, each with its orchard and gar-
den; a great part of the land was under cultivation, wheat-
growing being not uncommon; a few cattle grazed, and every-
one had horses. Although more or less isolated and lacking
nearly all the present-day luxuries which are now considered
essential, the inhabitants lived a happy and contented life, hard
working and self-reliant. The passing of Cobb and Co.’s coach
down the coast, the arrival of a bullock team to rest for a day
on its journey from Western Port to Melbourne, the occasional
camping of a few roving blackfellows in one of the paddocks,
and, very rarely, an expedition to Melbourne itself, were about
the only diversions apart from intercourse among themselves.
On Sundays there was a religious service in one or other of the
houses, after which the young people would take a walk to the
Tower or the beach, and occasionally riding parties explored
further afield. In the present days of hurrjr and noise it doubt-
less reads like a very simple and Arcadian existence, but that
it had its charm, as w r ell as its strenuous work, all those who
remember it agree in testifying.
The only remaining land not yet dealt with on the Mor-
nington side of Boundary Road was the open country between
John Thomas Smith’s two properties, comprising about 122
acres, and long known as Fitz’s paddock. This was bought
from the Government in 1854 by three Melbourne residents
named Hodgson, Burnley and Kent, but about ten years later
was acquired at £3 an acre by Mr. E. G. Fitzgibbon, after-
wards Town Clerk of Melbourne and later on the first chair


man of the Metropolitan Board of Works. It was from him
that it derived the name of Fitz’s paddock.
When Captain Lintot had been living at “Earimil” for
about eight years he gave 3f acres at the corner of his property
as a site for a Mt. Eliza church and school, and the other resj
dents near by subscribed the funds for the building. Of these
the most prominent were Messrs. Richard Grice, of “Many-
ong,” Thomas Moseley (of whom more will be said presently),
W. H. Hobson, Henry Martin, and Rev. James Glover. By
1864 the building was finished, all the bricks having been made
on the spot with clay given by Mr. Cahill from his paddock
just opposite, and the whole property was vested in trustees
for the Church of England.
An interesting ceremony had taken place when the foun-
dation stone was laid, at which a paper giving particulars of
the gift, a copy of the Melbourne newspaper of that date, and
specimens of the coins then in currency, were all enclosed in
a large bottle, sealed up, and built in behind the stone. In
the year 1913, when repairs were being effected at the church
and the wall was being strengthened, this bottle was discovered,
but was accidentally broken. The contents, however, were
collected in a new bottle, and it was replaced in the former
position. A photograph of the chief document was taken before
it was replaced, and a copy of this is here reproduced. The
figures shown on the scrap of paper pinned to the corner re-
present the numbers of the hymns sung on the occasion.




CHAPTER IV.
Having briefly described all the land on the Mornington
side of Boundary Road, we now turn our attention to that on
the other, or north-eastern, side. Between Boundary Road and
Humphreys Road, which run parallel to each other about a
mile and a quarter apart, all the land amounting to 2,278 acres
was originally disposed of by the Crown in six separate blocks,
one being of 640 acres, four being of 391 acres each, and an
odd lot of 74 acres. The plan opposite will show at a glance
how these lots were surveyed, and what were the names of the
original buyers. The largest of these blocks, representing a
square mile on the best part of the coast, was the very first land
taken up in Mt. Eliza, and by one whose name and family are
more closely associated than any other with the history and
settlement of this locality.
In the year 1839, Mr. William Davey, a Cornishman from
Penzance, and his son, James Davey, then aged 21, came out
to Australia in the ship “Argyle,” and after living for a while
in South Australia came across to Phillipsland and settled on
Mt. Eliza.
The New South Wales Government had a system in those
days of granting the early settlers what was called a pre-
emptive right to a square mile of any land they wished to ac-
quire. This gave them, for a nominal fee, the right to occupy
such land for a number of years, and then to buy the freehold,
if they so desired, at the upset price of 12/6 an acre. Later
on this upset price was raised to fl an acre. Mr. James Davey
thus obtained a pre-emptive right to the square mile of land
above mentioned. Beginning at Boundary Road it extended
north along the shore of the Bay to the Kackeraboite Creek, and
for nearly the same distance inland. Mr. Davey built his first
small residence on this land at the spot where the “Marathon”
homestead used to be, and where Mr. Ben. Cousins, the pre-
sent manager of that property, and himself an old identity, now
lives. While residing there Mr. Davey set about building a
larger home on the top of the cliff overlooking the picturesque
little bay which bears his name. This house was exactly on
the site of the present residence of Mr. Sargood, “Denistown,”




and many of the trees, including a couple of very large mul-
berry trees, which he planted in his garden, are still there. The
house was finished, and Mr. Davey moved into it, in 1851, and
gave it the name of “Marysville.” He then built a jetty with
piles (cut from Eucalyptus cinerea growing on the Mount), for
the protection of a couple of ketches, which he bought and
sailed down from Melbourne. This jetty ran out from the
western side of Davey’s Bay, where several of the original
piles still withstood the storms and marked the place until
about two years ago. Now no sign of it remains. From his
jetty Mr. Davey carried a wire rope to the top of the cliff, near
his house, and by this means slung his freight up or down be-
tween the boats and his farm. At first the shipments to Mel-
bourne consisted chiefly of timber and firewood cut on the
Mount, but afterwards included live stock and tallow, derived
from the cattle which he grazed over his selection and other
lands near by, which he gradually acquired. He also bred
horses for India. The country in his time was less cumbered
with undergrowth than it became thirty years afterwards, and
all of his 640 acres was good grass land with sheoaks and a few
gum trees. The coast tea-tree, which is now so prevalent, had
in those days made but slight headway along the shore, and
there was none of it at any distance inland. Mr. Davey bought
a variety of exotic plants and seeds for his garden at “Marys-
ville,” and it is interesting to note that the pretty purple
flowered Polygala plant which is now widespread for miles in
this neighbourhood, originated from six seedlings which he
bought for his garden at 2/6 each, and planted there about 70
3'ears ago. It is an African plant, but has now become so firmly
established as almost to rival the native tea-tree in its profusion.
When Mr James Davey moved into “Marysville,” he al-
ready had a young family, having been married in Melbourne
in 1843. His wife was Miss Williamson, and their marriage
in Scots’ Church, Collins Street, is the sixth celebration re-
corded in the early register of that church. In the summer
of 1851 a great part of Victoria was ravaged by the terrible
fires of “Black Thursday,” and this district did not escape.
When the bush fires came alarmingly near, Mr. Davey’s young
sons were entrusted to some blackfellows to seek safety in the
sea, while their father and other adults succeeded in checking
the advance of the flames.
By 1854 Davey exercised his right to buy the freehold of


his pre-emptive right, and gave £1 an acre for the 640 acres.
Had he foreseen that to-day it might easily realise £2OO an
acre he would hardly have parted with so much of it as he
did at a comparatively early date. His first cottage on the hill
and about 40 acres he sold to Mr. Frank Stephen (to whom
reference will be made later), and that valuable frontage pro-
perty of some 20 acres known as “Beachleigh” he gave for a
nominal price to Mr. Thomas Watts, the well-known Melbourne
architect, who later in 1878 built the house and lived in it for
many years. As was the case in most of the early buildings
the bricks for the house were made on the place from the ex-
cellent clay procurable everywhere about. Mr. Watts’s daugh-
ter who lived there as a child is now Mrs. McFarlane, the wife
of the esteemed vicar of Frankston. The contractor for Mr.
Watts’s house was named Freeman, and when in 1878 he was
working there he became so attracted by the locality that he
bought 13 acres close by for himself and built the house known
as “Studley,” now owned by Mr. and Misses Wrede.
A little earlier than this Davey also sold about 15 acres
adjoining his homestead to a friend named B.C.Harriman,of the
Crown Law Department, who built “Cliff House’’ upon it and
lived there for years.
On the other side of Mr. Watts’s land Dr. George Teague
bought the land as far as Canadian Bay, but resold it about
1890 to Mr. James Paterson. It is now the well-known resi-
dence, “Rubra,” of Mr. Henry Masterton. Dr. J. P. Teague,
at the same time as his brother, bought the large area known
as “Trawalla,” where he has resided for over 45 years.
In 1884 Mr. James Davey died, and the remaining lands
of which he was possessed were subdivided and sold. His
second son, also named James, bought the old homestead of
“Marysville” and continued to live there with his family till
shortly before his death nearly twenty years later. He had
seen great and rapid changes take place during his life-time,
and what he remembered as a boy as being open country and
bush for many miles in nearly every direction, without fences,
roads, or houses, had become settled and built upon, more or
less, as it is to-day. One may gather some perception of those
earlier conditions of life and of the great and pleasing contrast
they must have presented in many ways to the early pioneers


from the old country, from the following extracts from a letter
written in 1857 to James Davey, junior, by a cousin of his
mother’s who had paid them a visit at “Marysville,” and then
returned to Melrose, in Scotland. After the usual greetings,
he wrote: —
“We are all well here, but the intense cold is enough to
“make one ill. You would wonder if you saw the snow and ice.
“The men play a game on it with large stones with handles on
“them, they call it Curling, and the boys slide on it. But I
“prefer kangaroo hunting any day, and I wish I was back
“again among the kangaroos. This is not a country like Aus-
tralia. You can’t fish here, you would be sent to gaol or have
“to pay a fine of £lO, and you can’t shoot or hunt, there are
“gamekeepers and water bailiffs wherever you go, and. when
“we ride out we pay a toll every six or seven miles. • . . This
“is a land of oatmeal, they make stuff they call porridge, and
“I believe the poor get very little else; they cannot afford meat.
“If you had some of your fat bullocks over here you would
“get £2O for them instead of only £4 in Melbourne. I expect
“you will have seen a railway by this time. Our minister, Mr.
“Campbell, left last week for Australia, and goes to Brighton,
“so you majr hear him preach.”
The Rev. Mr. Campbell mentioned here was the father of
Mr. Campbell, of Davies and Campbell, solicitors, who subse-
quently acquired from James Davey about 80 acres on Canad-
ian Bay and built “Glen Shian.”
Reverting to the plan on page 19. it will be seen that the
second block of land, 393 acres, was bought by the same James
Davey in conjunction with William Wooley. This was in
1854. Wooley also bought other lands in the vicinity, and
lived in the house which he built on the coast (about which
more will appear later.) Mrs. Wooley’s brother was Mr. Hum-
phrey, who bought 200 acres of this block from Wooley and
Davey, and built a house upon it close to the site of the pre-
sent house of “Carbrook.” That was in the fifties, and he
was the first to reside on the road, which consequently took
its name of Humphrey’s Road from him. A little later Hum-
phrey sold half his land, 100 acres, with the house to a pur-
chaser named Heron, and the other half of 100 acres to T.
Frame, a box-maker, of Melbourne, for £3 an acre. Frame


built the house, and planted the orchard on the property, which
afterwards changed hands several times, and is now known as
“Ashheld,” and owned by Mr. S. Ross.
The Boundary Road end of this same block of Wooley and
Davey’s was sold by them in smaller areas, and at various
times, in the early sixties. Part of this land, 30 acres, Mr.
Leland Davey, a grandson of the original owner, James Davey,
and a great-grandson of William Davey, repurchased in 1907,
and established his well-known orchard of “Cowrie.” As Mr.
Leland Davey married a daughter of Mr. Thos. Moseley, two
of the oldest families on the Mount are represented in their
children, who are the fifth generation of Daveys living in the
district.
Isaac’s allotment of 390 acres began at J. Smith’s cottage
and ran for 40 chains along Boundary Road, with a similar
frontage to Humphrey’s Road. Isaacs gradually divided it
up in various-sized blocks, and ran a road down the centre of
it. Among the purchasers were John Taylor, E. G. Savage
(who was schoolmaster in Frankston, and whose wife was
postmistress), Thoms Ritchie, T. Frame (referred to above),
S. Winter, and George Milne. Of these purchasers, Winter was
the first to build a cottage on 100 acres at the Humphrey’s Road
end, and a few traces of its ruins may still be found. The
next to arrive on the scene was George Milne, a Scotsman, who
bought 30 acres, a little behind Winter’s, for his sister and
brother-in-law, Mr. Henry Walker. It was in 1859 that Mr.
Milne came down from Melbourne in James Davey’s ketch,
landed at Davey’s Bay, and walked up the bush track known
as Humphrey’s Road to inspect the land. Humphrey’s and
Winter’s were then the only buildings on the whole 390 acres.
The following year Mr. Milne and Mr. and Mrs. Walker took
possession of their property, lived in a tent, and built their
first house. This house was destroyed by fire some years after-
wards, when a second one was built a little higher up, and has
been the well-known residence of the Walker family ever since.
The sons, Robert, Henry, and Andrew, as they grew up all
bought other land round about, and are among the best known
residents on the Mount. Mr. Robert Walker was the first
Shire Councillor elected to represent Mt. Eliza when it was
created a separate riding.


In 1860 S. Winter sold 40 acres to Mr. Lawry, who later
on built upon it and sold to T. Frame (before mentioned), who
sold it to Mr. Fulton, from whom it passed to his daughter, Mrs.
Broomhead, the present owner.
John Taylor, Savage, and Richie, all bought blocks at the
Boundary Road end of Isaac’s land, and it was from them
that Mr. Thos. Moseley purchased 55 acres at £1 an acre in
1862. He afterwards sold 15 acres to Mr. J. Smith who lived
on it till his death in 1925. Mr. Thos. Moseley came to Vic-
toria in 1853, and long before he bought this land in 1862 had
lived in the neighbourhood, where he continued to reside till
his death in 1915. His son, Mr. J. Moseley, now lives on the
property.
Mr. Thos. Moseley took a prominent part in all the early
interests of Mt. Eliza, was a stanch churchman, and was one
of those largely instrumental in building the church in 1864.
The same John Taylor above mentioned also sold another
block in 1862, near Walker’s, to a man named William Hast-
ings, who afterwards committed the one sensational crime
which has blotted the history of the Mount. He had lived
there for ten years with his wife and children, when one day
he reported among the neighbours that his wife had disap-
peared, and he feared had got “bushed.” A search was or-
ganised, and no traces of her being found, the police and black-
trackers were requisitioned; but it was some time before her
murdered body was found about two miles away, hidden in
the Gunyong Creek. Notwithstanding his protests of in-
nocence, Hastings was arrested, found guilty of her murder,
and was subsequently hanged.
The next block of 390 acres was first taken up in 1854 by
W. M. K. Vale, who was Attorney-General in Melbourne, but
who only purchased it as. a speculation. He disposed of part
of it on Boundary Road to Mr. George Baxter, who built on it
in 1860 and lived there for many years. The house still re-
mains, and so do several of the trees which he planted, notably
some fine specimens of blue gum. The property forms part
of that now owned by Mr. H. M. Collins.
Here Mr. “Bill” Baxter, so universally known on the Pen-
insula, spent his boyhood, and acquired his knowledge and pro


divity in field sports of all kinds. Kangaroos were particularly
numerous in this district, and there was plenty of other game
of various sorts to occupy the attention of youngsters with in-
clinations in that direction. To show how plentiful the kan-
garoos were, it is recorded by a hunter who spent two seasons
here in shooting kangaroos for their skins, that in that time
he shot over 2,000, all in the near neighbourhood of Mt. Eliza.
It was not only for their skins, however, that the kangaroos
were valued, for in the early days of the diggings, when meat
was scarce, pickled kangaroo hams were readily purchased, and
the hunters’ camps generally contained a good supply of these
in course of preparation to be forwarded to Melbourne, where
they realised up to 6d. a lb.
Although rabbits had not yet been introduced, to prove a
universal curse, there were a few wild animals of an objection-
able kind. The little spotted native cat was not uncommon,
though it has now altogether died out; a few wild dogs existed,
and there were plenty of snakes. Mrs. Walker, the mother of
Mr, Robert Walker, was walking through the scrub one morn-
ing between her place and Baxter’s when she trod on, and was
bitten by, a snake. People were their own doctors in those
days, and with great fortitude she immediately cut the flesh
away with a sharp knife and so prevented more serious effects.
Beyond Mr. Baxter’s lived for a time a family named Hart,
and “Hobson’s clearing” is still so called where Mr. H. Hob-
son moved after leaving the cottage on Pt. Nepean Road.
The freehold of the last section of 390 acres was pur-
chased from the Crown by Craig and O’Grady. Most of this
is now known as the Quarry paddock. It was for a time in
the possession of an early settler named Stenniken, who ran
stock on it, and who cleared a portion on the east slope of the
hill and built a homestead there. The house has long ago dis-
appeared, but the clearing can still be traced.
On the other side of Humphrey’s Road, near the sea, Wil-
liam Wooley and the Davey family again owned the pick of the
land. Wooley had 162 acres, the whole property known as
“Yamala,” where he built the house and lived until he sold it
to Dr. (afterwards Sir John) Madden. The name of Wooley
is perpetuated in “Wooley’s Reef,’’ a mud bank in the Bay
about a mile off “Yamala,” well known to the patient schnapper


fishermen, and marked by a moored buoy. This buoy was put
there by the Government as a warning to vessels after Lord
Brassey had run his famous yacht “Sunbeam” aground upon
it, when trying to sail in one day to visit Sir John Madden.
Beyond “Yamala” all the frontage between the sea and
Point Nepean Road down to the foot of Oliver’s Hill, 30 acres
in all, and now dotted with many charming seaside residences,
was owned by James Davey, and was known as his “horse pad-
dock,” though it could never have provided much in the way
of feed!
On the opposite side of Point Nepean Road, and extending
to Sweetwater Creek, was a paddock of 85 acres belonging to
Mr. William Davey, the father of James Davey. Mr. William
Davey himself lived on part of this land, where he built a
wattle and dab cottage near where Plummer’s Avenue now be-
gins. He had by that time married again, and his second
family was reared there. Mrs. O. Wells, of Frankston, is a
daughter of this marriage, and a brother of hers years after-
wards built “The Grange” and planted a good orchard on part
of the 85 acres. The hill now called “Oliver’s Hill ’ was
known in the early days as “Old Man Davey’s Hill” after Wil-
liam Davey.
On the top of this hill, in a portion of Davey’s 85 acres,
lived for a time Mr. Thomas Ritchie, one of the earliest resi-
dents on the Mount. In the year 1852 Mr. Ritchie, then a
young man of eighteen, and the youngest son of Captain Colin
Ritchie, of the 10th West India Regiment, left England to try
his fortune in the recently-discovered gold fields of Victoria
He sailed in the ship “Isabella Watson,” having put what capi-
tal he had into a stock of boots and shoes which he hoped to
turn over at a good profit on the diggings On arrival off Port
Phillip, the “Isabella Watson” was wrecked at the Heads, and
young Ritchie only saved his life by clinging to a broken spar,
on which he was washed ashore, but he lost everything he pos-
sessed, including his stock of boots. Having tried his luck at
the gold fields without success, Mr. Ritchie, two years later,
1854, came to Frankston, married a Miss Kennedy, who lived
near Thomas Moseley’s, and settled on “Old Man Davey’s
Hill,” about the spot where Mr. Anderson’s house now stands.
There he continued to reside, working at various employments
about Mt. Eliza, and acquiring a little property, until the year


-1863. By that time he had five children, the eldest a boy of
eight years and the youngest an infant of nine months old.
Early one morning Mr. Ritchie set off to walk to Mr. Richard
Grice’s, where “Manyung” house was then being built, and
his wife left their cottage for a while to seek the cow which
had strayed down Sweetwater Creek. The eldest boy was up
and dressed, but the other children were still in their beds. As
Mrs. Ritchie was returning from the creek she observed smoke
coming from among the trees, but thinking that perhaps some
one was doing a little clearing off, she did not at first feel any
alarm, until as she drew nearer she realised that it was her
homestead which was in flames. The poor mother’s state of
mind can be but faintly imagined as she rushed forward to the
burning house. A bullock wagon was coming up the road,
and the driver hastened with her to the spot, but the roof at
that moment fell in with a fresh roar of flames, and it was im-
possible to approach. There was no sign of the poor children,
and it was only when the fire had somewhat abated that the
charred remains of the four elder ones were discovered in the
ruins. The oldest boy, as was apparent from his attitude, had
evidently been overpowered when in the attempt to carry out
his eldest sister, and the two other boys were still in their beds
when the fire overtook them. The infant’s body could not be
found, and it was only some time later that the poor little mite
was discovered, still alive, though badly scorched, in a bush in
the garden. It was evident that when the kitchen fire, which
Mrs. Ritchie had left burning, fell out and set the wooden
building in a blaze, the plucky little boy had first carried his
baby sister to safety and placed her in the bush, and was in
the act of similarly rescuing the other when the smoke and
flames overcame him. That little baby, rescued by her heroic
brother, fortunately recovered, and is now well known to every-
one in this district as Mrs. Deane, of Frankston. She still bears
the scars, however, which she received during the occurrence
af that terrible tragedy.
During the nine years that Mr. Ritchie had been living
on “Old Man Davey’s Hill” other people had come there and
built their homes. The first of these was James Oliver, a fish-
erman and carpenter, who kept his boat below in the little bay
and whose cottage was on the turn of the old steep road which
ran up the hill. It was through his frequent presence on the


point of the cliff, gazing out to sea for signs of fish, that the
name of the hill gradually changed to Oliver’s Hill, by which
it will now probably be always called.
The sand had not yet silted up Oliver’s little bay, and he
was able to sail his boat right into the Sweetwater Creek and
anchor it there. When James Oliver died his son, also James,
continued in the same place and occupation until he in turn
died as an old man a year or two ago.
1 he road in those days, and until the new curve was made
about 1915, was a very steep and rough ascent, as many an
unfortunate team of horses with heavy loads found it, after
their long journey from Melbourne.
Behind Oliver’s cottage, where the Boys’ Home is now
established, lived for a time another gentleman who was long
and widely identified with the Mount, Mr. F. J. S. Stephen.
Always known as Frank Stephen, and being as well known in
the Melbourne Courts of Justice as in this neighbourhood,
there might seem to be some grounds for the belief that is
sometimes held that a contraction of the name Frank Stephen
gave rise to the name of Frankston, which the village at the
foot of the hill early assumed. This only shows, however, how
easily error can creep into history, as the authentic origin of
the name dates before even his time. About the first place to
be built near the mouth of the Kananook Creek was a little
public house for any wayfarers along the coast, and this was
erected by a man named Stone. When it was finished the
question of a name arose, and his little son being christened
Frank, he called it Frank Stone’s Hotel. Round this pub. the
little settlement gradually grew, and from “Frank Stone’s” be-
came Frankston. The site of the pub. is where the Bay View
Hotel is now.
Mr. Frank Stephen transacted all the legal business of the
settlers, and there are few conveyances, or other law docu-
ments of those days, which do not bear his name. It was in
connection with some such transaction with Mr. James Davey,
of “Marysville” that the latter, in settlement of a bill of costs
for about £4O, gave Stephen some 40 acres out of his land in
the pre-emptive right, and Stephen thus acquired the since well-


Known property of ‘‘Marathon.” There he built a commodious
nome and there his family grew up. He planted all the slope
oi tne Kackeraboite Creek with a line orchard, long afterwards
Known for its good fruit, and a few' old trees of which still
struggle amidst the tea-tree and gums that now overwhelm it.
it was to “Marathon” that the rising young barrister, John
Madden, came a-courting, and when he married a daughter of
tne nouse, he purchased William Wooley’s place “Yamala” ad-
joining his father-in-law'. There, as Dr. Madden, the leading
advocate, and then as Sir John Madden, Chief Justice and
Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria, he continued to reside when
nis duties in town would permit, and there he laid out and
planted with trees and hedges one of the most attractive sea-
side estates on the Mount.
Another young man in Melbourne, who was making his
mark there, named Andrew Rowan, also married a daughter of
Trank Stephen, and shortly afterwards took over ‘‘Marathon’’
from his father-in-law. He also bought a large portion of
Davey’s land across the road, running along Kackeraboite
Creek, which he fenced and partially cleared. When Rowan
bought “Marathon” Mr. Stephen moved over to “Cassiobury”
where he built the house, now more or less in ruins, and con-
tinued to live for some years. After Mr. Rowan’s death the
“Marathon” estate was acquired, in 1912, by General H. W ■
Grimwade, who built the new residence and improved the pro-
perty into the present state of beauty for which it is so justly
celebrated.
It was at the back of “Cassiobury,” across the creek, that
about forty years ago a certain amount of prospecting for gold
was carried out. Misled, no doubt, by the prevalence of mica
in the creek, some gold-seekers put down several small shafts,
with rough windlasses, but beyond getting a touch or two of
“the colour,” they were unsuccessful. The shafts, 15 to 20 feet
deep, were to be seen for a long time, but have now fallen in.
During Frank Stephen’s occupation of “Marathon,” and
about the year 1861, the granite bridge over the Kackeraboite
Creek was built. The steep gully, which was then known as
Davey’s Gully, and afterwards as “Rowan’s Gully,” or some-
times as “The Devil’s Elbow,” was not traversed, by the road
to Point Nepean along which coaches and others travelled. They


always swung off along a track on the eastern side of Kackera-
boite Creek, practically where the Country Roads Board made
the deviation recently, and only a rude bridge crossed the creek
to “Marathon” and “Marysville.” The road, however, had al-
ways been surveyed as running past the “Marathon” gate, and
as the other land became sold and fenced off, the Government
found it necessary to make a proper crossing. In 1860, there-
fore, a contract was let to Messrs. Hutchinson and Proudfoot,
of Melbourne, and that very fine example of stone work was
constructed. The granite was quarried from the Tower pad-
dock by a man named Ned Sullivan, a well-known identity, and
was carted to the slope above the creek, where the blocks were
then dressed ready for laying. Innumerable fragments of
granite lie about in the soil at this spot to-day, and will doubt-
less puzzle geologists of the future to account for their presence
in such an unlikely place. Most of the settlers in the neigh-
bourhood, Moseley, W alker, Wood, and others, took a hand in
the work, and they had every reason to be proud of the result.
Such structures are not built nowadays, and the bridge only
needs to be seen to be admired. One of the men engaged on
the masonry, named Etheridge, brought his wife to live in camp
with him, and they pitched their tent half-way down Davey’s
Gully. WTile there she gave birth to twin sons, who, there-
upon, were christened Davey Etheridge and Gully Etheridge
respectively. Gully Etheridge was still heard of in the Penin-
sula quite lately.
Upon the completion of the bridge the road over it soon
became the general highway, and early in the sixties a shoeing
torge was erected on the rise of the hill near “Marathon” gate.
This was conducted by a blacksmith named Williamson, and it
was a favorite stopning place for teamsters on the road. Though
all vestige of the building has long ago disappeared, a strata
of old broken bottles which can still be discerned peeping from
the accumulated dirt and leaf-mould of half a century show's
whereabouts it stood, and lends color to the legend that in ad-
dition to the forge was the more profitable business of a sly
grog shop!
Reverting to the subject of original Crown grants, it will
be seen that most of the land on the Mount has now been ac-
counted for. The part that remains consists of the consider-
able area of about 1,700 acres on the northern side of Hum


phrey’s Road, and extending over the Mount to the three-chain
road, which skirts the foot of it. The whole of this area was
acquired originally from the Crown by G. W. Cole, and has
always been known as “Cole’s paddock.” Mr. Cole was the
well-known proprietor of Cole’s Bond and Free Stores in Mel-
bourne.
Broken by several deep ravines and water courses, and
consisting of much rough country, this paddock nevertheless
contained many choice spots, with magnificent views in all
directions. Cole himself never did much with the property,
beyond sometimes grazing a few stock or leasing it for agist-
ment, but he, and his executors, gradually disposed of it to
various purchasers. In the land boom days, Thomas Bent and
a syndicate of speculators acquired most of it. but the boom
burst before it was resold, and it long remained in the hands
of mortgagees. One land-owner, Mr. M. Clements, and his
son, Mr. Norman Clements, thoroughly improved their hold-
ing and now graze considerable numbers of stock there. It
may safely be predicted, however, that the time is not far dis-
tant when most of it will be sought after for summer residences
at rapidly increasing values. Quite recently four or five
wealthy Melbourne citizens have acquired portions of from 20
to 50 acres, commanding extensive views, and have set about
the erection of modern bungalows.
Right in the centre of Cole’s paddock the State Rivers and
Water Commission has within the last ten years acquired a
considerable area and constructed the large Reservoir by a
dam across the bed of the Sweetwater Creek.
With water laid on from this supply, with the extension
of electric light and power to all who need them, with tele-
phones, motor cars, and other conveniences, the old, primitive
conditions are now a thing of the past, and will soon be even
forgotten. It was with this in mind that the Mt. Eliza Pro-
gress Association, the activities of which are directed to guid-
ing, and restraining, the modern conditions along lines of
greatest benefit and convenience, conceived the commendable
idea of putting together the foregoing facts of bygone days for


tine perpetuation of the memory of those who are no more, and
for the information and interest of their descendants and
successors.
Threefold the stride of Time, from first to last.
Loitering slow the Future creepeth,
Arrow-swift the Present sweepeth,
And motionless for ever stands the Past.
