I The' Princess’ Theatre was crowded to the doors at each representation.
« Mr. Barrett’s rendition of Hamlet was immediately endorsed by thoughtful
playgoers, but his new readings created a tremendous controversy, which

A man in Parramatta was present at the
funeral of a neighbour, of whom no good could
honestly be said. But everybody was saying
something, and this man, not wishing to appear
singular, but being incapable of lying, remarked
that it was “ a nice, quiet corpse. 1 ' He then
turned to s friend and confided in him that the
only medicine he ever kept in the house was
Watson’s Worm Nuts, which never failed yet.

Many years have elapsed since this quaint remark was made, but it is tolerably certain
that
The Farmers’ & Dairymen's Milk Co., Ltd.,
HARRIS & THOMAS STREETS, ULTIMO,
can lay claim to the fact that children who drink their PURE FRESH MILK laugh and
grow fat. The most important fact of all is, that the prestige gained by the Company for
fair and legitimate trade has been the means of garnering in a harvest of first-class con-
sumers throughout this city and suburbs, that any Company might well be proud of.

are suffering from ANiEMIA. The greatest
ANAEMIA cure is
S-Oft PALE
Marvellous of a New Zealand Girl.
HI
“lam 19 years of age,’’writes Miss
Petrea Peterson, of Featherston,
North Island, N. Z., “ and ever since
I was 15 I have been suffering more
or leas.” Palpitation of the heart
was herprincipal trouble,she states,
and this was induced by anaemia,
or poorness of the blood. ‘ 4 When,
for instance,” she continues,“ I ran
up-stairs my heart used to thump
most frightfully against my sides
and so bad was it that on these
occasions I was unable to talk for
some time afterwards. This was
naturally a source of considerable
anxiety to my family and friends.
Night after night I tossed, weary
and worn-out, on my bed, trying
vaiiiy to sleep. At times, too, I had fearful attacks of cramp in my legs,
and so great was the agony that frequently it caused me to scream out in very
desperation, to the despair of those around. I was always in a weak, low
state, and, of course, never felt fit for my work. My legs, too, would at times
swffl up to a considerable extent, and this naturally occasioned myself and my
mother great suspense. Thus, as I grew older I became worse and worse, being
subject also to periods of giddiness which many a time caused me to almost
fal down. I tried plenty of medicines and I had several doctors, one after the
otker, but they gave me no relief. I also consulted three doctors regarding
ar affliction of the eye from which I suffered. In June, 1897,1 commenced
taking your pills. After the third dose I found a change for the better. I
c ; L inued with them until I, bit by bit, improved so much that four months
n 0.1 left them off altogether. I have taken a total of nine boxes, and am
new in the most x perfect of condition. Insomnia, weakness, giddiness, heart
palpitation, cramps, and swellings in the legs have all disappeared, and the
affection in my eye has likewise ceased. My mother thinks the world of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and she has tried several boxes herself.
I am awfully thankful to them, and I have recommended them to all my
friends. Pour of them cannot praise them too highly T . shall always
recommend them.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are blood builder and
a nerve restorer, curing such diseases as rheumatism, neuralgia, partial
paralysis, locomotor ataxia, St. Vitus’ dance, nervous headache, general
debility, nervous prostration, the after effects of la grippe, influenza, dengue
aid typhoid fevers, and severe colds, diseases depending on humors of the
bibod, such as scrofula, chronic erysipelas, etc. Pink Pills give a healthy
glow to pale and sallow complexions, and are a specific for all troubles
peculiar to the female system, such as anaemia, poor and watery blood, female
irregularities, etc. In the case of men, they effect a radical cure in all cases
arising from mental worry, over-work, or excesses of any nature.
Experiencing any difficulty in obtaining the genuine Dr. Williams', send
dijfect to the Dr. Williams Medicine Company, Sydney, who will forward
(post paid, on receipt of stamps or post order) one box for 2s. 9d., or half-a-
dUzen for 15s. 3d.

It is calculated that the aggregat
annual income of the working-classes of the
United Kingdom is about .£300,000,000.
Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby,”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also show
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
chief models were his wife and daughters.
Mama (after she had punished Tommy)
—“ Stop making such dreadful faces.”
Tommy (bursting into tears) —“ I ain’t.
I’m trying to keep a stiff upper lip.”
Her Mother —“ Edith, don’t yon think
you are getting too old to play with little
boys F ” Edith (aged seven) —“ Ho,
mamma; the older I get the better I like
them.”
“ Do you hear that whining in the next
room ? ” “ Yes ; who is it ? ” “ That’s
the football rusher who got off those
manly utterances at the end of the game ;
his wife is rubbing his lame shoulder.”
A man recently drank a pint of yeast
in mistake for buttermilk. He rose three
hours earlier than usual next morning.
He—“ Just think of it. They say
man descended from a monkey.” She —
“ $ A come down, indeed.”
There are two violet farms in the
United States, both managed entirely by
women.
Hitherto Patient Boarder “ Mrs.
Starvem, I can stand having hash every
day in the week, but when on Sunday you
put raisins in it and call it mince pie, I
draw the line.”
‘The dear, dear girls,” exclaimed Mrs.
Pawkins, looking at her fashionable
daughters enthusiastically. “ Yes, the
dear, dear girl,” muttered Mr. Pawkins
despondently.
At the Party. — Mr. Boresley (amateur
hypnotist) — “Now, Miss Spicer, I want
you for a moment to concentrate your
mind upon absolutely nothing.” Miss
Spicer—“ Would it make much difference
if I concentrated it upon you, Mr.
Boresley P ”
Society is divided into two classes
the fleecers and the fleeced.
Encouragement. —Her Papa — “Has
my daughter given you any encourage-
ment, sir I ” Mr. Loveday—“Well—er
—yes. She said you were an awfully
generous parent.”
O’Doolan’s Hew Waistcoat. —O’Doolan
(furiously) —“ By the powers, no more
home-made weskits for me, Mrs.
O’Doolan! Wan button too much at the
top, an’ wan buttonhole too many at
the bottom! ” Mrs. O’Doolan —Why, ye
auld phule, ye’ve buttoned it up wrong.
It’s a strait weskit would suit ye ! ”
Family friend: “I congratulate you,
my dear sir, on the marriage of your
daughter. I see you are gradually getting
all the girls off your hands.” Old Olive-
branch : “ Off my hands —yes ; but the
worst of it is, I have to keep all their
husbands on their feet.”
Boy or Girl ? —Wife (reading a letter
from a distant friend) —“ How strange !
Elfrida doesn’t say whether her baby is
a boy or girl. But she states it’s already
beginning to talk.” Husband—“ Oh,
well, ihat decides it; it’s a girl, of course.”
Teacher —“Where do the Arabs live ?”
Boy —“In the desert.” Teacher —“What
do they call those pious men who flee to
the desert ? ” Boy—“ Deserters.”
Culture is dangerous when it reaches
the point of taking a woman’s mind off
the thing she has in the oven.
Lost Child (to policeman)—“Please,
sir, have you seen a man without a little
boy ? ’Cause if you have, I’s that lifctl
boy.”
Eishmonger (to thrifty housewife)
“ Fish is dear, mum. Hit’s a-gettin’ worry
scarce in consekence o’ these ’ere aque-
riums.”
An impecunious Irishman said he liked
being asked out to dinner because it was
flattering and nourishing.
A country clergyman recently officiated
for a brother clergyman. Being anxious
to know what impression he had made
he asked the clerk : “Was my discourse
too long ? ” “Ho ; but it was long
enough.” “ I am glad of that; for to
tell you the truth, the other day, as I
was getting this sermon ready, my dog
destroyed four or five pages, and, clerk,
that made it much shorter.” “ Oh, sir,”
said the clerk, “ could you let our vicar
have a pup o’ that ’ere dog p ”
Reserved. — Lawjmr — “ I must know
the whole truth before I can successfully
defend you. Have you told me every-
thing ? ” Prisoner—“ Except where I
hid the money. I want that for myself.”
The poet enters timidly. “ Here are
a few verses, Mr. Editor,” he says defer-
entially. The barbarian, without looking
up, says, “ Please throw them in the
basket, yourself—l haven’t time just
now.”
Truthful Tommv. — Mr. Cumso — “This
is a very bad report to bring me from
school, Tommy.” Tommy—“ I know,
papa ; but you said if I’d bring you a
good report you’d give me half-a-crown,
and .{ wanted to save your money.’’
Temperance Advocate —“ lam sorry
to hear you have been drinking of late ;
remember that there is a limit to the
pleasures of a public-house.” Hardener—
“ Very well, sir ; I’ll go to a brewery.”

To the Bile Bean Manufacturing Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have been for some years (-object to Biliousness ami
Headache, and, seeing Bile Beans were so extensively advertised, I
decided to give them a trial, and accordingly put myself under a short
course. I can truthfully state that I experienced relief tr m the
beginning, and to-day I feel in perfect health. I can conscientiously
recommend Bile Beans to anyone suffering from Biliousness -and
Constipation. You are at perfect liberty to publish this statement
when and where you please.
Yours truly.

Are manufactured m one of the largest and best-equipped laboratories
in the world at Detriot, Michigan. U.S.A. They have been used
throughout that country for years by the most eminent medical men.
Every pill is a dose, and their great worth lies in the fact that they
act directly on the bil« ducts, and do not purge or strain the bowels,
therefore avoiding all vile after-effects that follow the using of nearly
all purgative medicines sold to-day. They are an undoubted specific
for Headache, Inmgeetion, Constipation, Debility, Dyspepsia, Idles,
Pimples, Female Ailments, Sallow Complexion, and all Liver Troubles.
.They may be obtained at all Chemists, price 9|d per box, small
size, or 1/1 regular size ; or direct from the Australian Depot,
Bile Bean Manufacting (Jo., 19 Macquarie Place, Sydney.

The sale of Gilbey’s Dry Gin in New South

brand, and it is daily increasing in popularity.

doctors for kidney and allied maladies. Taken

Beer, it is a most refreshing and wholesome
stimulant.
