COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA
GENERAL INFORMATION.
In the year 1901 the separate dependencies of Australia,
Introductory, together with the Island of Tasmania, became federated
and formed themselves into the Commonwealth of
Australia.
The Commonwealth comprises the States of New South \\ ales,
Victoria, South Australia. Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.
Some idea of its vastness may be gathered from the fact that it contains
2,972,906 square miles, which is nearly twice the area ot Great Britain
and the Continent of Europe?exclusive of Russia and twenty-five times
as large as the whole of the British Isles together. Still the whole
Continent has many features in common and it will be well, therefore,
before dealing with the various States separately, to give some general
particulars which are applicable to all of them.
In all this vast territory there are at present only
Population. 4,053,000 inhabitants, being a little more than one person
to the square mile. The room for expansion will be
better appreciated when it is remembered that England has 606, Scotland
150 and Ireland 140 inhabitants to the square mile.
The Commonwealth constitution provides that every
Government, man and woman over 21 years of age who has resided
in the State for over 12 months has a vote and no one has
more than one vote. Parliament is composed of a Senate and a House of
Representatives, and the same men and women vote for both Houses. In
addition to the Commonwealth Parliament, each State has its own legis-
lature consisting of two Houses?a Legislative Council and a Legislatix e
Assembly. Municipal or Local Government also obtains in the States.


A new country, such as this is, offers great opportunities to
Attractions the worker. There can be no doubt that given health and
for Settlers. the will to work, a man finds there far greater possibilities
of making a home for himself than in the long settled
countries of the old world. Australia offers peculiar attractions to the
British settler. It is, purely and simply, a British Continent, with this
qualification, that in the greater part of Australia severe winters are
unknown. There are practically only three seasons in the year?spring,
summer, and autumn, the short spell of winter being wedged in between the
latter end of the autumn and the beginning of spring. Out-of-door life with
its work and its amusements can therefore be carried on all the year round.
The climatic conditions of the country are very varied,
Climate. ranging from sub-tropical in the north to temperate in
the south. Every class of European farmer can find, in
some part of Australia, the conditions both as regards soil and climate
suited to his particular experience. Though many parts of Australia are
hot, it is mostly a dry healthy heat which is not at all unpleasant, while
the great extent of territory and its varied climate ensure that when dry
times come the ill effect is not universal. The fact that 45 per cent, of
the land in the Commonwealth is within the 15 inches annual rainfall
area must not be overlooked. In the coastal divisions heavy falls are
general, the mean average ranging from 35 to 70 inches. So it will be
seen that in addition to a fertile soil, Australia offers the new settler a
favourable climate, while, as will be shown, every assistance is given to him
by the Government to make a secure and comfortable home for himself.
Australia possesses a great advantage owing to the fact
The Opposite that its seasons are precisely opposite to those in the
Seasons. old world. As a result harvests are being reaped at the
time when European supplies are shortest. For example,
Australian butter arrives just when the price of that commodity is at its
highest in Europe, while consignments of apples from Tasmania reach
Great Britain at a time when few other apples are obtainable.
Australia is distinctly a healthy land. No endemic
Health. diseases are known, while small pox and other scourges
of the older countries are also non-existent. The great
attention that is paid to health and sanitation is well exemplified in the
falling death-rate, which has been continuously improving for some years.
In 1891 the death-rate for the whole of Australia, including Tasmania,
was i4?63 ; in 1901 it had fallen to i2?io ; while in the last four years it


had still further receded to the very satisfactory figures of 10-83 P er I )���
of the population, the death-rate for Great Britain being 19.
Perhaps in its amusements more than in anything else
Outdoor Life. Australian life is typical of ail that is best in the Old
Country. In many of the settled areas the rivers are
teeming with English trout, perch, and other useful fish which have been
imported. Every township has its cricket and football clubs, while on the
vast plainlands golf links are almost ready made. But amusement is not
the Australian?s only recreation ; his intellectual side has not been
neglected. Almost every town has its mechanics? institute and its
technical colleges, while the educational system is one of the best in the
world.
Education throughout Australia is compulsory, undenomi-
Education. national, and practically free. Every child up to the age
of 14 must attend school for a stipulated number of days
in each year.
There is no State Church, hence all religions are treated
Religion. upon the same footing, and there is no denominational
teaching in the public schools. At the same time, a very
high importance is put upon the religious training of the young people.
At stated times religious instruction may be given in the schools, while
the various religious organisations have their churches and institutions
scattered broadcast throughout the land, and the attendance at the Sunday
Schools is very large.
Turning to the question of emigration to Australia, it
Scope for may be at once pointed out that it is for settlers who
Settlement, will go to the land that the best opportunities offer. The
towns are already comparatively overcrowded, but
millions of acres of fertile lands await the settler, and this is the class
of emigrant to whom the respective governments hold out the most
inducement. It is true that in the populated districts of Australia land is
not generally to be obtained for nothing, but in most of the States the
governments are resuming and sub-dividing large areas of high-class farm-
ing land often ready for the plough, and by easy payments spread over a
number of years a new settler can obtain a good homestead on very
reasonable terms. There can be little doubt that this settlement of the
people on improved land is a distinct advance on the old system of taking
up virgin land, for even though the unimproved tract could be acquired at
a lower cost, much time was lost in clearing the land before it was fit for
cultivation. Large holdings are now being divided up into smaller


settlements, and for farmers and fruit-growers with a small capital of, say,
?� 2oo, excellent opportunities are afforded for securing good land at
reasonable cost and with assured prospects of success. It may interest
intending settlers to know that Australia has no savage animals among its
native fauna. Few deaths are caused by snakes, the danger of which has
been much exaggerated.
Taken as a whole, Australia may be said to be only just
Agriculture, emerging from the first phase of agricultural settlement,
the great industries of the country having been until
recently chiefly confined to pastoral pursuits. Nevertheless, in ten years
the area under wheat has been nearly doubled, and the production of the
whole Commonwealth amounts now to about 80,000,000 bushels. The
total area under cultivation of various crops in the Commonwealth in
1905 reached 12,315 000 acres.
But the sheep is Australia?s greatest source of wealth,
Sheep. and in 1905 the export of wool alone amounted to
the sheep depastured numbering 75,000,000,
or a quarter of the total in the world
The Commonwealth Immigration Laws provide that no
Common- barrier of any sort is to be put in the way of any
wealth desirable British subject seeking to enter the Common-
Immigration wealth, and British subjects born in the United Kingdom or
Laws. their descendants born in any part of the British Empire
are freely welcomed to the Commonwealth terrritory.
The law debars from admission :
[a] Any person likely in the opinion of the Minister for External
Affairs to become a charge upon the public or upon any public or
charitable institution.
{b) Any idiot or insane person.
I*o Any person suffering from an infectious or contagious
disease of a loathsome or dangerous character.
(d) Any person who has within three years been convicted of
an offence, not being a mere political offence, and has been sentenced
to imprisonment for one year or longer therefor, and has not received
a pardon.
( e ) Any prostitute or person living on the prostitution of others.
Immigrants under contract are admitted, providing such contract is
not made with a view to affecting an industrial dispute, and that the
conditions and remuneration are as advantageous as those existing in the
Commonwealth for the same class of labour.


The Immigrants Act, 1905, of the Commonwealth of
Immigrants Australia provides that every contract immigrant, unless
Act, 1905. otherwise prohibited by law, may land in the Common-
wealth if the contract is in writing, and is made by or on
behalf of some person named in the contract and resident in Australia,
and its terms are approved by the Minister for External Affairs of the
Commonwealth. In the case of alien immigrants coming to Australia
under contract, it must be shown that there is difficulty in the employers
obtaining within the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and
ability, but this does not apply where the contract immigrant is a British
subject, either born in the United Kingdom or descended from a British
subject there born ; and the remuneration and other terms and conditions
of employment must be as advantageous to the contract immigrant as
those current for workers of the same class at the place where the contract
is to be performed.
As some of the States give assisted passages and some do

chapters dealing with the respective States.
Passengers? personal effects are admitted free. Passengers?
Customs furniture and household goods up to the value of

use of such passengers for at least one year, and if they
arrive within three months before or after the arrival of the passenger. A
liberal view is taken in favour of immigrants as to the value of their
second-hand furniture and goods.
It would be well for newcomers to obtain some expe

Newcomers. especially desirable in the case of young men with capital
who propose to work the land. With the object of
providing facilities for acquiring experience, the Governments of most of
the States are now in touch with a number of reliable farmers who are
willing to take new arrivals and give them a practical insight into
Colonial conditions, while in most of the States Government farms have been
established where instruction is given at a low cost in agricultural pursuits.
Skilled agricultural labourers can readily obtain employ-

garden or orchard, or who are used to handling stock,
may always be sure of ready employment at good wages.


Several of the States have Information Bureaux for the
Information purpose of bringing into touch new arrivals and farmers
Bureaux. requiring labour. It is advisable for all emigrants to get
into touch with these Information Bureaux on their
arrival. No formal introduction is needed, as it is the business of the
bureaux to furnish information to all enquirers. A fair average wage for
agricultural labourers in Australia may be put down at 16s. to 20s. a
week and everything found. At harvest and shearing time wages are, of
course, higher.
The great desire of the Australian Governments at the
Mechanics, present time is to settle people in the country districts,
and while the chief demand is for skilled agriculturists,
mechanics in most trades who are willing to go into the country districts
may rely upon obtaining work and good wages. There is a good demand
in many of the States for skilled miners, but as a general rule the local
supply is well up to demand for ordinary labourers or navvies.
In the chief manufacturing centres the most recent
Manufactories, records show that the average earnings per week are
�2 2s. to �2 ss. for men and 17s. 6d. to 20s. for women.
In speaking of wages, however, it must not be forgotten
Cost of Living, that in Australia the cost of living is very cheap. The
housing and clothing problem is not aggravated by a
long and severe winter, while a house in the bush can be put up at almost
nominal cost.
Clerks, shopmen and warehousemen are specially recom-

be mentioned that the average consumption of meat is
239 lbs. per head per annum, as against 150 lbs. in the United States,
90 lbs. in Canada, 109 lbs. in Great Britain, 77 lbs. in France, 51 lbs.
in Russia, and 26 lbs. in Italy.


The Railways in the Commonwealth are, as a rule,
Railways. owned by the various States. They have been built
with the idea of opening up the country and promoting
settlement, and the fares, both for passengers and produce, are low.
There are no shareholder-capitalists? interests to be studied ; the railways
of Australia are conducted for the benefit of producers as a whole, and,
provided they pay the interest on the capital expenditure, that is all that
is required of them. There are nearly 17,000 miles of railways, and these
are being added to yearly.
Australia?s bright prospects are largely due to the fact that the
facilities for export, due to good railways and excellent ocean steam
service, are advancing as rapidly as the increase in production. The
respective Governments have expended �134,000,000 on the construction
of railways, and these, last year, earned �12,000,000, or per cent,
interest, after paying all expenses.
It is a not uncommon impression that the gold digging
Mining. days of Australia are past. This is entirely erroneous.
The gold mining industry is in a state of greater
prosperity than ever before. Methodical mining is being carried on, and
though for some years past alluvial mining has fallen off, gold is being
obtained in far larger quantities than was the case in years gone by. For
instance, in 1893, the value of all the gold won in Australia was only
about �6,000,000. Last year it had risen to over �17,000,000. In 1904,
Australia produced more geld than any country in the world, and in 1904
and 1905, contributed nearly one-quarter of the world?s total output.
Perhaps, in concluding these general notes, it may be of
Commercial interest to state that in 1905 the volume of Australian

other country.

NEW SOUTH WALES.
The early history of New South Wales, the oldest of the
History. States of the Commonwealth, is the early history of
Australia as a Colony. Captain Cook, in 1770, explored
the eastern shores, which he named New South Wales. The first Colony
was established at Botany Bay in 1788 ; but the settlement was quickly
removed to Port Jackson, where Sydney Cove was occupied and the site
of Sydney itself decided on. In 1851 Victoria was separated from the
older Colony, and a further partition took place in 1859, when Queensland
was constituted a separate dependency, and New South Wales was allotted
the boundaries which confine it to-day.
New South Wales lies on the eastern side of the
Geography. Australian Continent, and is bounded on the north by
Queensland, on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the
south by Victoria, and on the west by South Australia. The total area of
New South Wales is 310,700 square miles, or about 199,000,000 acres,
being a little over two and a-half times the size of Great Britain and
Ireland, or about the size of Great Britain and France joined together.
There is considerable diversity of physical aspect in this
Mountains, large extent of country. At a distance varying from 25 to
120 miles from the seaboard, a range of mountains (called
the Dividing Range), from 3,000 to 7,000 feet in height, stretches from
north to south, throwing out spurs in every direction. Between this range
and the ocean lies the eastern division. On the western side of the range
lie the central tablelands, which again further west develop into the vast
western plains.
AGRICULTURAL DIVISIONS.
Stretching from the sea to the mountain range lies an expanse of
country which is as a rule very fertile. The rainfall varies from 40 to
70 inches. This is the great dairying and maize growing portion of the
State. On the river flats yields of 100 bushels of maize to the acre are
not uncommon, while six or seven cuts of lucerne are obtained annually.


On the table lands mixed farming is practised, and it is an ideal
country for sheep and cattle. Leaving the tablelands, and as the country
extends westward, the cattle and mixed farming give way more and more
to sheep, though within the 20 to 24-in. rainfall wheat growing is very
profitable, and wheat and sheep are the staple products. The finest
merino wool in the world is raised on these lands.
Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, picturesquely
Sydney. situated on the shores of Port Jackson, resembles in many
ways an English town. Much of the land near Sydney
is fertile, and that suitable for agriculture and fruit growing costs from
�lO to �2O an acre ; while for small areas suitable for poultry farming
near the Metropolis fairly high prices must be paid. In December, 1905,
the population of Sydney numbered 529,600, being an increase of 11,030
during the year.
Port Jackson, on which Sydney stands, is unrivalled as
Ports. a harbour, both for beauty and convenience. The rocky
coast of the Pacific is suddenly broken, and the cliffs
form an opening to an estuary of sufficient capacity to shelter all the
navies in the world, and of sufficient depth for the largest ships afloat.
From the Heads to Sydney is a distance of four miles, beyond which the
harbour extends for eight miles further. The breadth varies from three-
quarters of a mile to over two miles, and the foreshores of the harbour
extend more than 200 miles. Sydney has 66 per cent, of the shipping of
the State.
Assisted passages are given by the Government to persons
Assisted skilled in rural industries, domestic servants, or others
Passages. who satisfy the Agent-General that they will make
suitable settlers. Such persons must be of sound mental
and bodily health, of good moral character, and must not exceed fifty
years of age. They will be taken out at from �6 to �8 per head, but,
except in the case of farm hands and domestic servants, must deposit �6
with the Agent-General to draw when they land in Sydney. Domestic
servants and farm hands need deposit �2 only.
Such emigrants are given letters of introduction to the
Aids to Head of the Intelligence Department in Sydney, who
Employment, puts them in touch with those who need labour, or helps
them to acquire the class of land they desire.


Several routes are available, but the two generally taken
Fares. are round the Cape or through the Suez Canal. The
former is available to only first and third-class pas-
sengers, the unassisted fares being from sad upwards
respectively. The Suez Canal fares range from �l7 third class,
�3B second, and �65 first. Assisted settlers may travel for from �6 to
�8 third class, and � 26 second class.
Any time of the year is suitable for arriving in the
Best time State, May to September being perhaps the best months
for Arriving, of all. December to February are the summer
months
About the middle of February ploughing is started, and the sowing
of wheat begins in March ; but ploughing and sowing are kept going
until the end of May, and in some cases even later. Hay harvesting
commences early in November, after which the maize is cut, and
December is the month for the wheat harvest. The chief shearing
season is in October and November.
A new settler has the opportunity either of taking up
New Settlers, partially-improved land or of commencing on virgin soil.
In the latter case he must fell the timber and burn it off.
In the North Coast districts, where settlement is now proceeding rapidly,
the contract price of felling the timber is about 255. per acre. After the
burning off, grasses sown grow rapidly, and some cattle may be put on the
land at the end of the year. Young dairy cattle may be obtained for
from �6 to The profit from a cow should run into about �8 to
�lO per annum.
There are still immense argas of Crown lands to be
Crown Lands, thrown open for settlement when the present short
leases expire. Crown lands can be taken up at very low
cost. The usual price may be set down at about �1 an acre, payable
over a number of years.
A popular system for new settlers on arrival is to take up
?Shares? farming on the ? shares ? system. Large land holders
Farming. are glad to get their land put under wheat on this
plan. As a rule, the landowner provides the plant, teams,
seed, and land ; in some cases, however, the tenant has his own plant


and teams. Usually the tenant takes the first bag to the acre, after which
the balance is divided, though in many cases the crop is halved all through.
Dairy farming on the ? shares ? is also popular, the landowner giving
the land and stock, and the tenant the labour, the proceeds from the milk
being divided.
On large sheep stations the average wage paid is about
Wages. �i a week, with rations for stockmen and others
permanently employed. Shearers receive �\ a hundred
sheep and shed-hands �i ss. per week during shearing time.
The usual wage for a ploughman is 18s. to {1 a week with keep,
ordinary farm hands averaging about 16s. a week with keep.
The climate of New South Wales varies greatly accord-
Climate. ing to locality, and depends less upon latitude than upon
height above the sea-level; it resembles generally that of
Southern France and Italy. Sydney and the coastal districts have a more
equable and moist climate than that of the interior. Snow is almost
unknown, except at high levels, and the frost is never severe. The
climate is very healthy, especially in the hilly parts. The mean tempera-
ture of Sydney is 63 deg., the mean summer temperature being 70 deg.,
and that of winter 56 deg., so that the range is very small. On the New
England tableland the climate is very pleasant and healthy ; the average
heat in summer is about 3 deg. less than in Sydney, and the winters are
10 deg. colder, but the extremes of cold and heat are greater. In the
western districts the range of temperature is much greater than at Sydney,
the winters being colder and the summers much hotter. New South
Wales is, like the rest of Australia, remarkable for the amount of
sunshine it enjoys.
The rainfall varies considerably ; the greatest amount is
Rainfall. found along the coast-line, ranging from an average of
36 in. south of Sydney to 50 in. at Sydney itself, 63 in. at
Port Macquarie, and 74 in. on the Tweed in the extreme North. The
24-in. rainfall extends on an average about 300 miles inland and


covers over 100,000,000 acres of land. Within this area dry seasons are
seldom experienced, but West of this line the annual rainfall in New
South Wales gets less and less, until finally on the Darling the average
is only about 10 in.
The population of New South Wales at the end of 1906
Population. was 1,600,000. The death-rate for New South Wales
has fallen steadily from the year 1876 to the present time,
and has declined most largely during the last 14 years. In 1905 the rate
per thousand was 10-13, being -70 under the mean rate for the
Commonwealth.
New South Wales has an excellent educational system,
Education. which is free. Children going to school travel on the
railways free ; the compulsory school age is 6 to 14.
Public schools are erected wholly at the expense of the Government.
Denominational schools are not supported by the State, but religious
denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day in the public
schools for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective beliefs,
such instruction to be given in a separate classroom by a minister of the
denomination. With the exception of the Church of England, however,
this provision has not been taken advantage of to any great extent. In
addition to the public schools there are a number of excellent private
schools, while the Sydney University, which was established in 1852, is
worked under a charter modelled on the lines of the University of London.
There is a very large Technical College in Sydney open to both sexes,
while Technical Schools have been established in most of the leading
towns in the State.
The Government provides exceptional facilities for the
Agricultural agricultural education of young men who desire to take
Education, up farming pursuits. There is an Agricultural College
about 30 miles from Sydney, where 150 students are
received and given a thorough practical and scientific training in farming
pursuits. In each of the leading districts, too, the Government has also
established farm schools, where' young men are thoroughly instructed in
agricultural methods suited to their particular district. The Government


is also in touch with a number of agriculturists who take young men
for training as practical farmers. By these latter a small wage may also
be earned.
There are about 3,400 miles of railway in the State which
Railways. traverse most of the leading agricultural and mining
districts. The railways, with two small exceptions, as
well as the majority of the tramways, belong to the Government. The
first object of the railways is to open up the country and to give people an
opportunity of getting their produce conveyed to the markets at as low a
cost as possible.
Hence the freights are very reasonable, the railways being

Charges. them, and no big dividends have to be paid as in the
case of private railways.
Most of the wheat is carried at distances varying from 200 to 400 miles,
the freight per ton in six-ton trucks being ns. Bd. for the former, and
13s. 6d. for the latter distance. So grain carried from, say, Narromine,
306 miles from Sydney, only costs ifd. per ton per mile.
LEADING INDUSTRIES.
The pastoral industry is still the chief factor in the wealth
Pastoral of New South Wales, and the annual export of wool
Industry. amounts to nearly 000,000. With a view to
encouraging settlement, the Government is gradually
providing for the resumption of some of the large sheep stations situated
within the good rainfall area, and is cutting them up into comparatively
small farms, ranging generally from 300 to 500 acres. These are sold to
settlers at nominal rates, and the payment is allowed to extend over a
great number of years.
Under the Closer Settlement Act, a settler may obtain
Closer Ttooo worth of partially improved land by the payment
Settlement, of �"55 per year, the final payments being made at the
end of 38 years, when the land becomes his own. Hence
mixed farming is progressing y�ry rapidly; the area under wheat last
year was upwards of 2,000,000 acres.


The wheat farmer has peculiar advantages in New South
Wheat Wales. Not only is the land cheap, but the cost of
Growing. putting in a crop is very low, compared with the older
countries of the world. Disc- ploughs are often used;
the ploughing of the land costs about 3s. per acre with discs, and
ss. to 6s. with furrow ploughs. With a disc about 5 acres is done per
day. Harvesting also is cheap, what is known as a complete harvester,
which strips, threshes and bags the grain, being used at a cost of about
2s. per acre. The harvester will gather in about g acres a day.
The coastal districts are largely given up to the dairying
Dairying industry, and of all the districts, perhaps that of the North
Industry. Coast has made the most rapid progress. Ten years ago
but little butter was made in that district ; last year
the output amounted to over 16,000 cwt.
Creameries and butter factories have been established in all the
dairying centres of the country, at which milk or cream is delivered by
the farmers and cash paid for the produce. In 1905 worth of
butter was exported to Great Britain.
New South Wales offers peculiar, advantages for either grazing or
dairying pursuits. Cattle and sheep can be run and fed in the open,
largely on the natural pastures all the year round ; pastoralists, there-
fore, have a great advantage over persons in other lands who have to
house and feed their stock for months in the year, and where also expen-
sive and warm houses have to be erected for the men and women who
look after them.
There is always a ready demand on the dairy farms for
Dairy Wages, milkers, wages running from ss. to 10s. a week with
board and lodging for a lad, to 15s. and 20s. a
with board and lodging for men ; the latter must be thoroughly competent,
careful milkers able to separate the cream, feed the stock and do the
necessary ploughing and cultivation.


Large areas are devoted to orchards and vineyards, also
Other to the growing of maize, barley and other crops. Taking
Industries. New South Wales as a whole, there are few classes of
farming that may not be successfully followed in one
part or another of the State.
On the North Coast of New South Wales the sugar-cane
Sugar-Cane, industry is an important one. In 1906, 10,313 acres
were cut, with a total yield of 201,998 tons. The
majority of farmers cultivate sugar-cane in addition to other crops or in
conjunction with dairying. The number of holdings in which sugar-
cane is cultivated is about 1,130. Until recently the field work in the
plantations was performed entirely by white labour, and at the present
time the amount of black labour employed is not large and is not likely
to increase as a bounty of about 4s. 3d. per ton of cane is paid by the
Federal Government for all sugar grown by white labour. The cost of
growing cane may be set down as about 3s. 3d. per ton where white
labour is employed. Sugar manufacturers purchase the cane standing
and cut it at their own cost, the price varying from Bs. to 13s. per ton.
The sugar planter is further protected by an import duty on cane
sugar of �6 per ton, while the excise duty is fixed at �$ per ton.
Fruit and vine growing are both carried on to a
Fruit Culture, considerable extent in New South Wales; all classes of
fruit may be grown. Apples and pears thrive in the
colder districts and pineapples and bananas in the North Coast. Large
areas are under citrus fruits?oranges especially coming to great
perfection.
Among the most profitable callings is that of wine
Wine. production. The settler has a variety of soil and climate
to choose from. The class of wine varies with the natural
conditions. On the Hunter River the lands produce delicate light hocks
and claret, while the dryer district of the Murray River produces sweet
wines from crops containing a higher percentage of sugar. About
30 acres is considered necessary for a profitable vineyard in New South
Wales. A vineyard may be expected to yield from 330 to 400 gallons
per acre. The wine is usually sold in bulk to proprietors of wine cellars


at an average cost of about is. per gallon. About �8 to �lO per acre
must be expended in labour before the vines begin to make a return?this
in addition to the cost of the land.
MINING.
The mining industry is a very prominent one, and coal
Coal. mining is one of its most important branches. There
are immense coal deposits around Newcastle, in the
Hunter River district, and on the South Coast near Bulli, while on the
western railway line extensive deposits of coal, closely associated with
large iron ore deposits, are found near Lithgow and at other places.
Coal miners earn good wages, but the supply of men is, at present,
nearly equal to the demand.
Wheelers receive 7s. to Bs. per day ; shiftmen, gs. to 10s. ; overmen,
12S. to 155.; and deputy overmen, gs.,to 10s. The maximum working
hours are per week.
Gold mining is still an important industry in New South
Gold. Wales; the output in 1905 was valued at
Quartz gold mining is now largely succeeding the
alluvial washing, and has undoubtedly an immense future before it.
A miner?s right is-obtainable for ss. for 12 months. This entitles the
holder to enter upon Crown lands and to search for gold and other
minerals. The Government also expends considerable sums of money
annually in encouraging prospecting for gold and other minerals, in
addition to offering a reward of �5OO to any person who discovers a
new payable field.


Of late years the production of silver has become of
Silver. great importance. Silver deposits are found to extend
over an area of about 2,500 square miles in the Barrier
Range District beyond the River Darling, upon the borders of South
Australia. The great bulk of the silver produced in New South Wales
comes from these fields.
The aggregate amount of silver and lead produced in 1905 was valued
at 2 >494>�5 2< The various silver mines employ over 7,500 hands.
Tin mining is also carried on in several districts of the
Tin, Copper, State, while the copper mining industry has a great future
etc. before it. Kerosene Shale is found in several districts,
and opals are found in great quantities near Wilcannia.
There is an abundant supply of various kinds of stone.
Stone. Marble limestone is found near Bathurst, Tamworth and
at several other places. Granite is found near Goulburn,
etc., and Sydney itself has an inexhaustible supply of building sandstone.
Clays, for brickmaking purposes, abound throughout the country.
The manufacturing industry grows steadily. Last year
Manufactories, the number of hands employed was over 72,000, being
a considerable increase on the figures of the previous year.
Having regard to the cheap cost of living, wages com-
Mechanics? pare very favourably with those prevailing in other parts

as the ruling standard for mechanics Bricklayers,
rs. per hour ; carpenters, is. 3d.; masons, is. q^d.; plasterers, is. 3d. ;
painters, is. 2d.; boilermakers, is. 3d. per hour; blacksmiths, 9s. to 10s.
per day; and unskilled labourers as a rule receive about 6s. per day. In
factories wages are as a rule good. A few may be mentioned, such as
the following:?Tanners, average 435. per week; bookmakers, 405.;
cabinet-makers, 50s. ; iron moulders, 40s. ; iron turners, 50s. ; and
bootmakers, 38s.


When considering the cost of living it must be
Cost of remembered that owing to the genial and healthy
Living. climate much expense necessary in colder countries is
done away with. Rents in Sydney are about the same
as in most other cities in Australia, and workmen?s dwellings may usually
be secured at about 2s. 6d. per room, while a four-roomed cottage may
be obtained for about ns. a week. In the suburbs a good five-
roomed dwelling may be had at about ios. per week.
It must also be remembered that food is cheaper in New South
Wales than in England. As a rule mutton may be obtained at about
a pound, beef at about 3-Jd., 2-lb. wheaten loaves butter Bd.,
cane sugar 2*d. and eggs 6d. to pd. per dozen ; while clothing, which
is always considered more expensive in Australia than in Great Britain,
certainly does not show on an average an advance of more than 10 per
cent, on British prices.

VICTORIA.
The State of Victoria forms the south-eastern corner of
Situation. Australia. Its extreme length from east to west is about
420 miles, its greatest breadth about 250, and its extent
of coastline nearly 600 miles. Its area is 87,884 square miles, or
56.245,760 acres, being somewhat less than the combined areas of
England, Scotland and Wales.
Settlement in Victoria dates back only to 1835, although
History. an abortive attempt was made to form a Colony at Port
Phillip as early as 1803. The first encampment on the
site of Melbourne took place on August 29th, 1835. In the following
year the first magistrate was appointed from Sydney, and in March, 1837,
Governor Bourke visited the Colony and fixed the site of the township,
which he named after the then Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. Until
1850 Port Phillip, as the Colony was then called, formed part of New
South Wales, but in that year an Act of Parliament was passed making
it a separate Colony, under the name of Victoria.
From its earliest beginning the Colony prospered, but in
Discovery of 1851 a sudden impulse was given to it by the discovery
Gold. of gold mines of extraordinary value near Ballarat.
What this impetus meant is seen from the fact that while
in 1850 the population of the State was only 70,000, five years later
it numbered 350,000. The population is now upwards of 1,219,000.
Victoria is the most settled of all the Australian States,
Conditions of having 13-86 persons per square mile of territory, as
State. well as more roads, railways, telegraphs, churches,
schools, post offices, etc., than any other State. The
Government, however, recognises that /for the continued progress and
development of Victoria, a steady increase of desirable population is
essential.


To settlers from Great Britain, Victoria has much to
respects for offer. There are no extremes of heat and cold, and
Settlers. work can be carried on in the open air all the year
round - Land can be obtained on easy conditions from
e Government, while for good workmen wages are high, and the
population is practically all British. That the general health of the
community is good may be gathered from the fact that the death-rate is
ess than 13 per thousand, which compares most favourably with the
death-rate in European countries.
The climate of Victoria is, from its geographical position,
Climate. more temperate than that of other parts of the continent
of Australia, the annual mean temperature at Melbourne
being about 57 deg. On a few days during the year the thermometer
rises above 100 deg. in the shade, and on a few nights it falls below
freezing point. The number of days with rain at Melbourne is 102 to
165 a year, the average being 132 ; and the yearly rainfall ranges from
16 to 44 inches, the average being 26.
Over the greater part of the State frost is not uncommon in July and
August, but in South Gippsland and the neighbourhood of Melbourne it
is very slight. More than 4 deg. of frost are rarely known.
In a climate like that of Victoria any time of the year is
Best time for suitable for the arrival of immigrants, but perhaps
Arriving. May to September is the best time. December to
February are the summer months, the seasons
the reverse of those experienced in England. The shearing time is from
September to December, and the harvest is in December and the
beginning of January.
The Government is not granting any assisted passages
Steamer Fares, to the State, so the fares vary from �n third class
via the Cape, to �3B second class and �65 first class
via Suez.
Three routes may be chosen?either via Suez, Canada or the Cape.


GENERAL DIVISIONS OF THE STATE.
Victoria is divided into five distinct divisions. The Western
Division contains about 6,240,000 acres and has an average rainfall of
from 26 to 27 inches. Around Geelong stretches a rich farming and
dairying district, where numerous central dairies have been established.
Around Colac the natural grasses are so rich that a cow will be maintained
on acres, giving a return of �\o per cow. Warrnambool, also in the
Western Division, is 166 miles from Melbourne, and the fertility of its soil
is probably exceeded nowhere in the world.
The Central District is another important division and
Melbourne, includes the County of Bourke, in which is situated
Melbourne, the capital of the State. Melbourne vies
with Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, in being the most important
and populous city of the Southern hemisphere. It contains within a
radius of 10 miles from the Post Office about 501,500 inhabitants, and
is built with broad streets running East and West and North and South.
It has a number of beautiful and extensive parks and reserves, notably
the Botanical and the Fitzroy Gardens.
Immediately around Melbourne there is a large area of land devoted
to small farms for market gardening, fruit culture, etc.
The Wimmera District stretches away to the South
Wimmera Australian border. This is one of the great wheat-
District, growing divisions. - The climate is also ideal for stock
raising, and the pastures are rich. It is only just
developing its agricultural resources, and though the average rainfall is
only 17 to 18 inches per annum good results are being obtained. In
addition to general farming, the cultivation of vines is an important
industry here and some of the most noted vineyards of Australia are in
this portion of the State. The area of Wimmera is 5,695,000 acres.
The North-Western Division of the State is the driest
The Malice. part of Victoria. It covers about 11,000,000 acres, and
is known as the Mallee country. Although the average
rainfall is only from 10 to 14 inches the district is becoming an important
wheat-producing one. The soil is loose, free and light, and labour-saving
appliances and fallowing the land have shown that good crops may be
raised at a very slight cost. Sheep also thrive well on the Mallee farms,
the mild winters being conducive to their welfare. At Mildura, in the


Mallee district, the most important irrigation scheme in
Successful Australia has been established. An irrigation colony,
Irrigation Mildura, has been founded on the banks of the Murray
Colony. River, and, now that the initial difficulties have been
ercome, is a great success. Over 4,000 people are
settled there, and something like 9,000 acres are under raisins, fruits
and other crops.
The Northern Counties are watered by the Goulburn
Qoulburn River, on the banks of which are the rich lands of the
Valley Goulburn Valley, a vast plain covering 1,000,000 acres
Irrigation. of land of great fertility. The rainfall varies from
19 to 24 inches, but the plain has been irrigated and
is peopled by prosperous settlers on farms of about 300 acres. All
classes of agriculture are carried on with great success in this district.
The North-Eastern Division of the State also contains
North-Eastern large areas of wide fertile plains. The rainfall varies
Division. from 26 to 35 inches, and the district is well fed by
railways. Dairying, cattle and sheep farming are the
chief industries here. Creameries and butter factories are frequent
throughout the district, and farmers have no difficulty in disposing of
their produce.
Among the most beautiful portions of Victoria is what is
The Qippsland known as the Gippsland district, which occupies the
District. S.E. portion of the State. The scenery around its lakes
is very beautiful, and the waters abound with fish. Its
area is about 14,000 square miles, or nearly 9,000,000 acres. The Melbourne
winter markets are largely supplied with cattle from Gippsland, where also
great attention has of late years been given to the fattening of sheep
and to horse breeding. The climate and soil are well suited for oranges,
limes, tobacco and other like crops. In West Gippsland pig farming and
dairying are carried on, and yield good profits. A large portion of the
total hop crop of the State is grown in this district.
Gippsland enjoys a good rainfall, the average being from 32 to 40 inches
per annum. Here are found some of the biggest eucalyptus trees in the
world. Many of them run to 250 feet high, with huge trunks growing
straight as a gun barrel.


The State education is free and compulsory. A child
Education, not going to a State school must attend another school,
or the parents must show that the child is taught at
home. The course of instruction in State schools is elementary, but
extra subjects are taught on payment of a small charge. The prescribed
school age is from 6 to 13 years. There are 2,000 public schools in
Victoria.
An Agricultural College has been established by the
Agricultural State at Dookie. The instruction is free, but fees of
College. per annum are charged for the maintenance, etc., of each
student. The course of studies comprises scientific and
practical agriculture, viticulture and wine making; dairy management,
breeding of stock, agricultural chemistry, botany, entomology, veterinary
science, surveying, book-keeping, etc. Practical work upon the farm is a
marked feature of the course, every alternate day of the student?s time
being devoted to field work. The Dookie farm has an area of nearly
5,000 acres, some of which is devoted to experimental culture.
There is a School of Horticulture at Burnley, near
School of Melbourne, where instruction is given to both male and
Horticulture, female students for an annual fee of �5. There are also
a number of Technical Colleges scattered throughout the
State.
Although the agricultural resources of Victoria have been
Agriculture up to the present only partially developed, the State has
in Victoria, taken a position among those countries which contribute
appreciably to the world?s food supply. The annual out-
put of cereals is very large, the pastoral industry is a source of great wealth,
and the export trade in dairy products has developed by leaps and bounds.
The exports of frozen and canned meats, wine, poultry, fruit, and other
products, though still small in comparison with the capabilities of the
countr}. have assumed notable dimensions.
CEREAL CROPS.
Victorian wheat is the finest in the world, and brings a
Wheat. higher price on the London markets than the English,
American, Indian, or other countries? products.


The area at present under wheat in Victoria is about 2,000,000 acres,
yielding from 22,000 000 to 25,000,000 bushels. The average yield is
about 11 bushels per acre, although far higher yields are obtained in the
best wheat-growing districts of the State. Oats, barley and other cereals
also thrive.
Labour-saving appliances have been brought to such perfection that
uith the combined harvester a man with a change of horses will reap
9to 10 acres of wheat a day. Given a 20 bushel crop, this means 45 to
50 bags of clean grain standing in the field ready for the market, and
placed there at a cost for harvesting of about per bushel.
PASTORAL RESOURCES.
There is no need to enlarge upon the value of the pastoral resources
m Victoria The merino wools produced in the State are the finest in the
world, and fetch the top prices in the European markets. The average
quantity of wool produced annually is from 60,000,000 to
70,000,000 lbs.
The improvements in the methods of shipping perishable
The Dairying produce have resulted in a remarkable expansion of the
Industry, dairying industry in Victoria during recent years. The
fact that Victorian butter is made from the milk of cows
fed upon natural pastures gives to it a special value on the London
market. The State enjoys the advantage of being able to ship supplies
of butter to Europe for winter consumption. This advantage is not
shared by European butter-producing countries, or by Canada, the
United States or Siberia. With such advantages of position added to
her natural facilities, Victoria must find an ever-increasing market for her
dairy products.


Creameries and factories are found in every dairying centre. At
these a uniform product is turned out and an ever-increasing export trade
is being established. Butter-making is now nearly all done by machinery,
and cash payments for the milk or cream supplied are obtained from the
factories monthly, so the dairyman has always a ready return for his
produce.
Fruit culture is followed profitably, and recent develop-
Fruit ments in the shipment of apples, pears, and other fruits
Production. have rendered this one of the most promising of Victorian
industries. In certain places, especially at Mildura, the
production of dried fruits is an important industry, the warm sunshine
doing away with the need for artificial evaporation. Indeed, the climate
and soil are in every way suitefd to this industry, and the raisins and
currants from Victoria are very favourably looked upon in the markets of
Great Britain.
Other crops such as onions, tobacco, hops, maize, etc., also thrive
well in different parts of Victoria.
Pig keeping is such a source of profit to the Victorian
Pigs as a farmer, that it is a matter for surprise greater attention
Side Line. has not been devoted to this branch of industry,
but even as it is, Victoria plays an important part in the
output of pork and pork products.
Frozen and canned meat is also an important item in the export trade
of the State.
The production of wine is destined to become one of the

Industry. made it apparent that the home consumption could not
absorb great quantities, and that an export market would
have to be sought. The superiority of Australian wine soon brought it
into prominence in Great Britain, and the demand at the present time is
greater than the supply. There is an excellent opening in Victoria for


an extension of the wine-growing industry. Vineries have been established
in the chief centres, where growers get a ready sale for their must.
These central vineries ensure a uniform product, and it is a better system
than that of each grower making his own wine.
NEW SETTLERS.
The State of Victoria offers peculiar advantages to the

In 1904 a Closer Settlement Act became law in Victoria.
It pro\ ides for re-purchase of private lands, allotments, workmen?s home

The State is a liberal landlord to the bond fide settler. Its motto is
permanent settlement, not pecuniary gain, and its motive the improvement
and prosperity of its people.
The Government gives liberal financial assistance towards
Liberal the improving of properties secured under the Closer
Assistance Settlement Act. Persons must be over 21 years of age
given. to apply for land under this Act. Farmers may be
granted ,�1,300 worth of land for agricultural purposes,
agricultural labourers �2OO worth for a home, and workmen �lOO worth
for the same purpose, the payment being on very easy terms. The
Government assists workmen and agricultural labourers pound for pound
U P t0 � 5 O towards fencing and building, the settlers being granted
16 years to pay these advances, in half-yearly instalments, with 5 per cent,
interest added.
Under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act,
Agricultural 1906, of Victoria, the Agent-General is empowered to
Lands. offer and finally allot to applicants in Great Britain and
Ireland land in Victoria available for being taken up on
conditional purchase leases, with permits entitling such applicants to
enter into immediate occupation of the land.


Powers are also given to advance amounts up to repayable
in twenty years, for the purposes of building and effecting improvements
on the land.
The Land Act of 1898 provides that any person aged 18 can hold
from 200 up to 640 acres of first-class land and 1,000 acres of second-
class land. In the third and fourth class larger areas may be held. The
title obtained is an agricultural licence with a currency of six years,

balance in reduction of principal. Loans to farmers under the Credit
Foncier system have been very successful. The amount advanced to
farmers from the date of Act in 1896 is the average rate
of interest being per cent.
Every encouragement is given to the Victorian producer
Markets. to export his produce under the best possible conditions
and at the lowest cost. The Government provides
facilities for the export of frozen produce, and a carcase of mutton is now
dressed, frozen and put into cold chamber for 2s. id., while the freight
from Melbourne to London is only 2s. yd- About half-a-million frozen
sheep and lambs are exported annually. Apples can also be exported in
cold store for less than 3 s. per case, so that Victorian apples can reach
London in good condition and at a time when few other apples are in the
market.
All the railways in the State are owned and
Railways, worked by the State ; 3,39� ni il es are open for
traffic. They are spread like a network over the
productive area of the country.


MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES.
From an industrial point of view the State of Victoria offers many
advantages. Well favoured as it is in regard to the primary sources of
production, the State has also for a number of years taken a lead in the
direction of its manufactures. The capital invested in factories amounts
to over T 2 �ooo,ooo sterling.
About 73,000 workers are employed annually. Of these
Hands 36,322 work in factories which employ from five to fifty
Employed, hands. The male workers number 49,434, and the
female workers 23,795. The increase in the total
number of workers in a period of ten years was 21,500. Taking the
leading trades, there are 26,136 hands engaged in the manufacture of
textile fabrics and clothing, and the men employed in the manufacture
of machinery and in metal work number 10,350.
There are 10,602 hands engaged in trades connected with the supply
of food and drink and 6,525 find their means of subsistence in printing,
engraving, and kindred occupations. The number of wood-workers is
3,713, and 2,973 people are engaged in the manufacture of vehicles,
saddlery, etc.
The rates paid for skilled labour in Victoria are such as
Rates of to enable the recipients not only to live comfortably, but

GOLD AND MINERALS.
It seems scarcely necessary to call attention to the

the State, the total value of the production up to the
end of 1905 was Although 56 years have passed since
the first discoveries, the annual gold yield in Victoria is still a magnificent
asset, and there are a number of auriferous areas which have as yet
scarcely been touched, and in which there are great possibilities of develop-
ment. Nor is gold the only underground asset of Victoria. The State
contains coal deposits which so far are merely in the initial stages of their
usefulness ; and tin, silver, and other precious metals are also found.
A total of 25,369 men found employment in gold mining

Aid. Boring operations are conducted by the Mines Depart-

batteries treated 3,187 tons of ore, which yielded 1,525 ozs. of gold, or an
average of 9 dwts. 13 grs. to the ton. A special provision has been made
for the advancement of money to companies and to prospecting parties
where it is considered that service will be done in the way of developmental
work. The total amount thus devoted to encouragement of the industry

QUEENSLAND
The State of Queensland occupies the whole of the
Description. North-Eastern corner of Australia, and is bounded on
the East and North by the sea, on the West by the
Northern part of the State of South Australia, and on the South by
the State of New South Wales. The first settlement took place in
Queensland in 1823, and thirty-six years later the Colonists, feeling the
inconvenience of being governed from so distant a point as Sydney, asked
for separation from New South Wales. The new Colony was established
under the name of Queensland, on December 10th, 1859.
The length of Queensland from North to South is
Extent. 1 ,300 miles, breadth 800 miles, and coast line about
2,250 miles. Its area is 668,497 square miles, or
nearly 428,000,000 acres, almost twelve times the area of England and
Wales, nearly eight times as large as Victoria, and more than twice the
area of New South Wales.
A range of mountains called the-Dividing Range extends the whole
length of the country from South to North and divides the Eastern districts
from the Western.
In the coast districts the rainfall varies very con-
Rainfall. siderably ; Brisbane has a yearly average of 58 inches,
and the Darling Downs, which lie from 80 to 120 miles
from the coast, have generally a good rainfall. Further North, along the
coast, the region of tropical rains begins at Mackay, in South Kennedy,
and extends to Cooktown. The average rainfall at Mackay is 77 inches a
year. In the south part of Cook a very large quantity of ram falls,
amounting sometimes to more than 160 inches in the year. But even
in the rainy zone there is much variation. The rainfall at Rockhampton
averages about 49 inches a year, and Townsville, in the North, has less
than the above averages.


The population, which is mostly settled on the sea-board,
Population. only consists of 536,000 persons, or less than one per
square mile of territory. Queensland, therefore, urgently
needs population, and offers many opportunities to the pioneer with a
little capital to make a prosperous settlement.
The Government is democratic. Every man and
Government, woman, either by birth or naturalisation, who is a British
subject, is given a vote.
Education is free and compulsory. Religious instruction
Education. is given in some of the schools out of school hours by
ministers of religion, and in numerous Sunday schools.
Higher education is also assisted, the Government granting sums of
money for the formation and maintenance of grammar schools, and for
providing for scholarships and exhibitions at universities. There are
boys? and girls? grammar schools and technical colleges in most of the
principal towns.
Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, has a population of
Towns in 126,000, and is situated upon a pretty river of the same
Queensland, name. Rockhampton, Townsville, Bundaberg, Mary-
borough and Cairns are also important distributing
centres, through which flow the chief commerce of the State. They are
also the starting points of the railway systems into the interior.
Almost every town of importance has its School of Arts.
Mechanics? where there are evening as well as day classes, and where
Institutes, etc. classes are held for technical instruction as well as for
drawing, painting, science, etc. There are also mechanics?
institutes, miners institutes, free libraries and museums.
Over 3,400 miles of railway have been opened in the
Railways. State, nearly all of which belong to and are worked by
the Government. P'ares are low both for passengers and
produce, it being the policy of the State to utilise the railways for the
development of industry.
The Cairns Railway cuts over rugged mountains and through
beautiful tropical scenery, and is one of the grandest in the world.


THE PRODUCTS OF THE STATE.
The State extends over 18 deg. of latitude, thus offering a variety
climate equalled by few other countries. This diversity of climate
accounts for its great variety of products. Its fruits comprise those
grown in Northern Europe, apples, pears, strawberries, etc., an
tropical and semi-tropical fruits, such as pine apples, mangoes, bananas,
grapes and oranges, while the sugar and coffee and rice of the tropics are
included in its products with wheat, oats and barley. The mam products
of Queensland are wool, pastoral produce, butter, gold and sugar. er
important items of production are meat (all kinds, including extract), hides
and skins, tallow, pearl shell, cotton and tobacco.
The pastoral industry, from the number of people
Pastoral engaged in it. the area of country devoted to it, and the
Industry. value of its produce, ranks as the first of the *
producing industries of the State. The exported produc s
derived from stock last year reached the total of �\, 221,780. Of this the
largest item was wool, which was valued at �2,649,751.
The sugar industry is one of great importance to Queens
Sugar. land, and in 1905 there were 121,000 acres under cane.
Fifty-live mills were in operation and near y 150,000
tons of sugar were manufactured. Of the area under cane 83.000 acres
were crushed, yielding 1,327.000 tons of cane. A bounty of �2 - ton �
paid by the Commonwealth Government on all sugar manufactured
cane in the production of which only white labour is employed. Specia
facilities are given to persons desirous of growing sugar by the la g
holders of lands in the sugar districts, when good cleared and can
obtained on sale or rental on easy terms. In .906 the production of sugar
in Queensland amounted to 175,000 tons.
While the pastoral industry still ranks first m wealth
Agriculture production, the agricultural and dairying industries are
and Dairying, the most remarkable for the progress made In dairying
and Dairy g remarkable . The butter export
trade has so expanded during the past few years as to afford promise
of more important development.
In 1889 so little butter was made in Queensland that over
ii million lbs. had to be imported.


Last year, not only did Queensland meet her own requirements, but
over 10,000,000 lbs. were exported. In 1905 the export of butter to
Great Britain alone was valued at �269,077.
At present about 160,000 acres are under wheat in Queensland, but
the industry is only in its infancy, a new rust-proof wheat having been
discovered which will grow anywhere on the Western plains. The chief
advance is shown in the Darling Downs district, where the Government
has purchased several pastoral properties, and divided them into small
farming areas, which are being disposed of to settlers on easy terms.
These Downs are in area about half the size of Victoria, and comprise
some of the finest agricultural lands in Australia.
The repurchased lands are sold by the Government at
Lands from 30s. to �4 per acre, payable over 20 years. It is
Available. here that the new settler finds an excellent opportunity for
an assured living. Numbers of estates also are
being cut up and sold by their owners on easy terms.
Special facilities for the acquisition of the freehold of
Settling on agricultural homesteads not exceeding 640 acres are given

, . acre a y ear > anc * has spent from 2s. 6d. to 10s. an acre

near it owned by him in fee simple), and finally pays a sum which, with
the rent already paid, makes up 2s. 6d. an acre, he is entitled to the
freehold.
Most of the lands near railways are set aside for agricultural
selection. The maximum area to be taken up as an agricultural farm is
1,280 acres. The price as a rule varies from ios. to �i per acre. Twenty
years is allowed in which to complete the purchase.
The co-operative system not only applies to sugar farming

?System. The terms are fair both to the owners of the land and
cattle, and also to employees, and the necessity for
capital, often a difficulty with the new immigrant, is dispensed with.
enerally the facilities offered in both the sugar and dairy industries
are considerable.


The Government affords beginners an excellent oppor-
Agricultural tunity of acquiring practical experience of the farming
Education. conditions of the State. At Gatton, a fine Government
College and Farm have been established, where young
men for �2*] per annum obtain an excellent knowledge of the science and
practice of farming. This fee includes board and lodging. There are
also several experimental farms in the State.
The Government makes advances to farmers for the
Advances to following purposes, viz,;?
Farmers. (a) Payment of liabilities already existing on the
holding ;
[b) Agricultural, dairying, grazing, horticultural or
viticultural pursuits on the holding ;
(c) Adding to the improvements already made on
the holding;
[d) Purchase of stock, machinery or implements.
The borrower has to repay the advance within twenty-five years by
half-yearly iustalments of �3 ns. for every �lOO advanced, this sum
including principal and interest.
MINING.
Payable gold was first discovered in Queensland in 1858,
(j o ld. and since that time over worth of gold has
been won.
The present gold output of Queensland generally reaches nearly
annually. The chief fields are at Charters Towers, Gympie,
Mount Morgan and Croydon.
This industry supports a population of about 75,000 people, though
only about 10,000 miners are at present actually engaged in it.
Tin, copper, iron, wolfram and other minerals are found in large
quantities, while extensive deposits of anthracite coal are now being
opened up at the back of Rockhampton and Gladstone, on the Dawson
River. The principal coal fields opened up are near Ipswich and
Maryborough.
The earnings are good, miners in the temperate parts of

for Arriving, down before the summer season comes on, and the
shearing and harvest begin. December to February are
the summer months.
Money can be transmitted by the emigrant as follows : He can
deposit it with the Agent-General in London (1, Victoria Street, S.W.),
and will obtain a receipt, which, when presented at any Government
Savings Bank in Queensland, will entitle him to receive the amount with
interest at 3 per cent, on an account up to �2OO ; if the deposit is more
than no interest is paid on the excess. If desired, the money can
remain in the bank, bearing interest on the � 2OO.

of his purchase money on land taken up. The prices of the farms are
from 10s. per acre upwards, payable in 21 years, the annnal payment as
rent being one-fortieth of the purchase price.
There are excellent openings for farm labourers and
Demand for female servants. There is also demand for miners,
Labour. carpenters, blacksmiths, stonemasons, bricklayers and
wheelwrights, especially in the country districts. By
hiring on to a farm or a station, new arrivals will save money and gain
experience, which will be of the greatest use to them if, after a time,
they take up land on their own account. Men with a little capital are
advised to do this. Clerks, shopmen and warehousemen are warned
against emigrating, unless they have situations to go to.

Queensland Government, in addition to the passage, undertakes to take
care of such persons until they are safe on the farms where work has
been arranged for them. Notification has already been given by the
Government to intending employers that farm labourers will not be
indented except the wages offered are considered satisfactory by the
Executive Government of the State, and of which sum information can
be obtained at the Agent-General?s Office.
? f U ] VIU . probabl y save many applicants time and trouble to be
m ormed that as the Government is indenting this labour for employers


in the Agricultural industry, there is an implied premise that the labour
will be up to the standard of an ordinary agricultural labourer, and that
for the concession of a free passage and constant employment on arrival,
applicants must come strictly within these conditions and must be what
is generally known as farm labourers, i.e., healthy men who have been
accustomed to work at some form of farming operations.
Assisted passages are also offered to all families whom

The Agent-General will in the exercise of his discretion and as a principal
consideration ask the head of the family to deposit �so with him, which
will be returned with Savings Bank interest on the emigrant reporting
his arrival in the State. With that sum as a minimum, a family, with
the aid of the Agricultural Bank and private credit, can successfully start
farming operations on their own account, and the Government will afford
every assistance and opportunity to enable them to secure and settle on the
Crown Lands of the State in most suitable localities and near to a market.
As in recent years a large quantity of excellent land has fallen in to
the State, and as unquestionably there is abundance of good arable land
in a moderate climate and within the rainy belt, the facts point unmistakably
to a great increase in land selection, and the present seems to offer most
favourable opportunities to intending selectors to acquire good farms on
easy terms. Numbers have done so from all parts of the world, and
all appear to be well and prosperous.
Samples of Queensland?s exportable products can be seen at the
Imperial Institute or at Queensland City Office, Portland House,

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The nomenclature of this vast territory of South
Area. Australia is somewhat misleading, as it stretches right
from the North to the South of Australia, and is
really two distinct countries. It contains 578,361,600 acres of land, and
is four times the size of France.
South Australia was first independently colonised by
Population. British settlers in 1836, and after 70 years the territory
has a population of 375,000, and an annual trade of
about ;�T8,000,000. When it is realised that in this great territory
there is less than one inhabitant to every 1,500 acres, it will be seen
that there is ample land awaiting the settler. It would be difficult to
estimate the vast future before this enormous territory, where, with its
innumerable and varied resources, wealth promises to abound.
The climate of South Australia is very healthy and no
Climate. serious epidemic has ever visited the State. Searchers
after sunshine will find ideal conditions in this central
State of the Commonwealth. In the southern portion the climate
corresponds closely with that of Italy, while in the northern part tropical
conditions prevail. Valuable stud stock graze in open paddocks all the
year round, and to the worker there are no long periods of enforced
idleness owing to extremes of cold. Even when the heat is greatest the
air is so dry that it is quite bearable and healthy. The hottest and
driest period is between December and March. The remaining months
of the year are very pleasant, the weather being brighter, drier and
warmer than in England. The Winter is the wet season, but there is
no cold weather as in England.
There is no Established Church, but the various denomi-

the State. At the census of 1901 out of a total population
of 362,604, 30 per cent, were members of the Church of England, 25 per


cent, were Methodists, 14 per cent, were Roman Catholics, 9 per cent,
were Congregationalists, 7 per cent, were Lutherans, 6 per cent. Baptists,
and 5 per cent. Presbyterians.

Advantages. scholarships and the power of conferring degrees on
both men and women. There are, besides, many
excellent private educational establishments.
An Agricultural College is situated on the Government
Agricultural Experimental Farm at Roseworthy, about 30 miles from
College. Adelaide ; the fees are a year including everything.
The course covers the principles and practice of
agriculture, stock-keeping, fruit-culture, book-keeping, veterinary, physical
and natural science, surveying, wool-classing and viticulture. Practical
work in the fields is also taught.
Adelaide, the capital, is situated on the River Torrens,
Adelaide. in the middle of a large plain, partly surrounded by
beautiful hills, and has a population of 39,345, or
including the suburbs within a radius of 10 miles, 165,723. It possesses
handsome buildings, churches of many denominations, clubs, libraries,
and all the conveniences of a modern city; while the drainage system
is excellent. Market gardens, full of all manner of fruits and vegetables,
abound in the neighbourhood, and a little further out are extensive
farming lands.


A State Bank is established for the purpose of
State Bank, supplying a credit fonder ? for producers. Money
is advanced on very liberal terms, the maximum interest
being five per cent.
There are nearly 2,000 miles of railways in South
Railways. Australia which tap the chief agricultural districts.
Most of the important wheat-growing lands so far
opened up have only a railway carriage to the seaboard of about fifty
miles.
The Murray, the chief river in Australia, which is
Rivers navigable for nearly 2,000 miles, flows through South
Australia to the sea.
LAND FOR SETTLERS.
One of the most striking features of South Australia is the large
area of land waiting to be opened up by new settlers. The conditions
of tenure are very favourable. The Government offers new settlers
good agricultural land on the rent purchase system, the terms being easy
and convenient.
The disposal of Crown lands, other than those in the
Crown Land Northern Territories, is administered by the Corn-
Laws. missioner of Crown Lands. These lands are either let
under perpetual lease or disposed of under agreement to
purchase by payments extending over 30 years ; or, if the tenant so desires,
the purchase-money may be paid off at the end of six years. In each case
the Local Land Board fixes the price, having regard to the carrying
capacity of the land for stock, the value of the land for agriculture, or its
proximity to the railway. The Land Laws of the State are worked on a
liberal basis ; elasticity and sympathy with the settler characterise their
administration. There is a genuine desire to encourage settlement.
In order to meet the growing demand for partly improved agricul-
tural lands, the Government has recently repurchased some large estates
within good agricultural districts, which they are disposing of to
settlers on very easy terms. Small annual payments are made, and
4 per cent, interest is charged on the unpaid balance. About 250,000 acres
have, during the last few years,,been resumed for such purposes.


Improved agricultural land costs from �3 to �6 an acre,

costs �\ to �5 an acre to buy, or 4s. to 6s. to rent; land near Gawler
recently sold at �7 10s. to �\o 12s. an acre; for good land close to
Adelaide the prices are higher. An ordinary farm suitable for general
farming, with fruit growing, would be 150 to 200 acres, and the capital
required to work it would be If the farm is for wheat growing and
grazing only, the area should be not less than 500 to 1,000 acres, and the
capital not less than 15s. an acre, exclusive of the price of the land ; but
the addition of fruit growing would make the farm more profitable. Good
dairy farms in the south-east cost from /loan acre. Clearing timber land,
where needed, costs from �1 an acre, and scrub land 10s.
The best time for arriving in the State is from May to
Best time for October. Speaking generally, the immigrant would

before the hot weather comes on and the shearing and

The Government does not grant free passages, assisted
Passages. passages, or nominated passages ; but unassisted
passages from England to Adelaide are generally as
follows : ?By steamer from London (from 38 to 44 days), third class,
to second class, �3BlO T42 ; first class, �44 to From
Liverpool, by steamer, one class only, �l4. to /21. As a rule, in steamers,
children from three to twelve years of age travel half-price ; one child
under three years, free (no berth provided) ; other children under three
years, quarter fare.
There is no Government depot for emigrants, but a
Arrangements Government Labour Bureau has been established for
for Reception the purpose of facilitating the obtaining of employment,
on Landing, The Bureau is situated in Victoria Square, Adelaide.
Labour Registers are kept of all persons applying for employ-
Bureau, etc. ment and of employers applying for labour. There is a
Y.M.C.A. at Adelaide in Gawler Place, and a Y.W.C.A.
in Hindmarsh Square, but it is best for emigrants who have friends in the
State to communicate with them beforehand.


Demand for There is a great scarcity of female domestic servants,
Labour and especially of general servants. The demand for shop-

For farmers with capital the prospects are excellent.
Farmers. Fruit growing and wine making offer to men of capital
and experience especially favourable opportunities, which
are capable of unlimited extension. Experienced fruit growers with a
capital of T5OO to should do well, but it is better to work at
wages, or to help a friend for a time, than to plunge at once into farming
in a country where soil, climate, seasons, and the mode of farming are
different from what the new settlers have been accustomed to. The
delay incurred in learning these differences will be more than compensated
by the experience gained.
THE COST OF' LIVING.
The rent of a house of say four rooms and offices,
House Rent, in Adelaide and other towns, varies from 6s. to 12s.
a week; in the country the rate is from ss. to 10s. a
week. Large numbers of residents, however, live in their own freehold
cottages.
Retail prices per lb. are roughly as follows ; Bacon,

agricultural and mineral products.
South Australian wheat is much prized in Great Britain,
Wheat. and the quantity available for export from the last harvest
was 18,000,000 bushels. Nearly two-thirds of the tilled
ground is under wheat. Barley, oats, and peas are also grown in
considerable quantities. Owing to the favourable conditions of soil and
climate, the cost of raising and harvesting wheat in South Australia
is the lowest in the world. For the State, as a whole, the use of
modern machinery has brought the cost down to between Bs. and 9s.
per acre, as compared with probably �2 an acre in Great Britain.


Sowing is begun in April, May or June, according to
Mode of the locality, and, as a rule, is completed by July. In
Farming. recent years sowing has been done by mechanical seed
sowers, which are largely manufactured in the State.
Artificial manures, the cost of which is small in South Australia, are
being used more extensively each year, and in the chief agricultural
areas a general improvement is yearly taking place in farming methods.
As the month of November approaches the crops begin
Harvest Time, to come into ear. Hay harvest is generally in full
swing by the middle of November, the grain harvest
following immediately afterwards. By the beginning of December, \\hen
the summer has set in, reaping operations have fairly commenced, and by
Christmas harvesting is general throughout the State.
There is an excellent prospect for dairy farmers, and a
Dairy large export trade in dairy produce, especially in butter

States. A trade with England, which is capable of
unlimited expansion, is also being opened up by means of the cool
chambers on the mail steamers. The value of the export ot butter in
1904 was The export value of eggs grew from in
1893 to in 1904. Butter and cheese factories have greatly
developed in the State of late years, and now number 47 as against 26
in 1893 ; there are, in addition, a number-of creameries.
Wool is one of the staple industries of the country, the
Industries. annual production reaching about while the
average number of sheep depastured is about 6,000,000.
There is also a growing trade in the export of frozen sheep and lambs,
Adelaide lambs being specially prized in the London market.
The principal articles of export are ; Butter, eggs,
Exports. fruit (fresh), flour, wheat, hay and chaff, live stock,
meat (frozen lamb and mutton), copper, gold, skins
and hides, wine and wool.
About 100,000 cases of apples are exported annually, reaching the
London market at a time when other fruits are scarce.


Nature has endowed South Australia with a climate and
Fruits. soil peculiarly adapted to the successful cultivation of the
vine, the fig, the olive, and fruit of all kinds Millions of
acres await the man with industry, experience and capital to develop
these resources. The soil generally is deep alluvium or calcareous,
and the vine especially flourishes luxuriantly upon the limestone
formation.
The production of olive oil and the cultivation of currants, grapes
for raisins, and fruits for drying and canning are growing industries,
while the date palm is found to thrive in many places.
The soil and climate are very suitable for the production
Wine. of all sorts of wine. The area under vines has greatly
increased ; in 1904 there were 23,210 acres as against
4,590 in 1865. Out of the total area under vines, over four-fifths are
found in the Central Division, mainly in the Counties of Adelaide and
Light. Stanley and Hamley (Renmark) Counties are the chief wine-
growing districts in other parts of the State, In many good parts land
may be bought for �6 to �8 an acre, but in some districts it costs as
much as �l5 to �"3O an acre. Two tons of wine grapes, or from
three to five tons of table or raisin grapes to the acre, is a fair average
return. There are great possibilities in this industry, which in time
will no doubt be one of the main industries of the State. Ten or 20
acres are quite enough with which to start vine-growing. To bring
\ ines into full bearing costs �2O to �3O an acre.
It is believed that the mining potentialities of South
Mining. Australia are great, but so far, with the exception of
copper, little has been done to develop them. The
total mineral output in 1905 was �*568,000, of which �*435,000 was
copper.
There are a number of natural salt lakes in South
Salt. Australia, and several well-equipped refineries have been
established. The annual output is about 40,000 tons.


The manufactories, although not extensive, are quite up
Manufactories, to date; the total number of hands employed on 3*st
March, 1905, was 16,000 males and 4,000 females. At
Gawler there are important engineering works for the manufacture of
agricultural implements, locomotives, and machinery.
An irrigation settlement at Renmark, on the Murray,

was about 1,000, and there were 2,875 acres under lucerne, vineyards and
fruits. The principal fruits grown are apricots, grapes for raisins,
currants, pears, sultanas, peaches, nectarines, figs, oranges, almonds,
olives, grapes and lemons, and most of the orchards are excellent.
Attention is also being given to dairying.
THE NORTHERN TERRITORY.
The Northern Territory comprises 335,116,800 acres,
Awaiting and in this vast area there are at present only 3>7��
Development, inhabitants, exclusive of Aboriginals. Yet in such
districts as the Victoria River grass grows more
luxuriantly than in, perhaps, any other part of the world. The
country is rich in minerals, and only awaits the prospector to open it up.
The climate in the Northern Territory is tropical, except
Climate. on the table lands, where the temperature is lower.
There are two seasons, the dry and the wet. The wet
season last from November to April, with an average rainfall of 63 inches
at Palmerston, but the rainfall further South is far less. During the wet
season the heat is tropical, but at other times of the year the days are
bright and clear, and the weather equable.


Although variable the fertility of the soil is unquestion-

true of the land on the banks of the numerous rivers.
Maize grows in profusion, and plaintains, bananas, cocoa-nuts and pine-

vated.
The grasses of the country are rich and nourishing,

Of the country around the Victoria River very favourable
accounts have been received. A recent writer says the country contains
some of the finest pastoral lands in Australia. The country is well watered
back from the river and its tributaries, which are permanent. At the present
time there are only about 350,000 head of cattle, 16,000 horses and 50,000
sheep in the Northern Territory, but by careful selection of land in
suitable places it is likely that in the near future considerable progress
will be made there in the pastoral and agricultural industries. The land
within about 80 miles of the coast and along the banks of the rivers
appears at present most likely to give good results. This area comprises
nearly 100,000 square miles.
Comparatively little is known of the mineral resources

experienced geologist states it to be his belief that the
country is exceptionally rich in minerals, and he looks for important

WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
The State of Western Australia was first settled, as a
Description. Crown Colony, in 1829. In 1890 it was granted responsible
Government, and in 1901 it became one of the Federated
States of the Australian Commonwealth. It is bounded on the east by
South Australia, on the south by the Southern Ocean, and on the west
and north-west by the Indian Ocean, and extends from Fat. 13 0 30' N. to
35 0 8' S., and from Long. 112 0 52' W. to 129 0 E.
The area of Western Australia is 975,920 square miles,
Area. or 624,588,800 acres ?about a third of the Continent of
Australia. Its greatest length is 1,480 miles, and
breadth 1,000 miles. It is more than 16 times as large as England and
Wales, and eight times as large as the whole of the British Isles.
The land is divided into the south-west, western, north-
Divisions. west, Kimberley, Eucla and eastern divisions. The
principal division is the south-west, which contains the
leading coastal cities, including Perth, the capital, and the chief settled
districts of the State. In this division, with its 77,980 square miles, are
some of the finest agricultural and fruit growing lands in the world.
The climate varies according to latitude and distance
Climate. from the seaboard, but is generally healthy throughout,
and is suitable for agricultural and pastoral operations
all the year round. In the north there is an absence of the malarial
fevers common to many tropical or sub-tropical countries, while in the
south and south-west the climate is akin to that of the Riviera. The
seasons are, in the main, the reverse of those in Europe, the summer
being from December to March and the winter from June to August.
The mean average temperature for the south-west, taken at Perth, for
1905 and 1906 ranged from 70 to 75 degrees for December to March, and
from 54 to 58 for June to August ; while the readings for the six years
ending December, 1905, give a mean yearly average of 64 degrees.
The rainfall varies, as the climate, according to latitude
Rainfall. and distance from the seaboard. In the south-west
division the readings at Perth for the last 30 years give
an average of 33 inches per pnum, but the average of the whole
division is about 23 inches. In the Report of the Royal Commis-
sion on Immigration (1904), referring to the agricultural lands of the


State, it is stated that ? Regular rains spread over about seven months
of the wheat-growing period.? No drought has ever been known in the
south-west division, although there have been occasional dry seasons.
The population of the State on the 30th September,
Population. 1906, was estimated at 262,999 ? l males and
108,243 females. The total increase during the nine
months of 1906 was 9,347, of which 5,250 were the excess of immigrants
over emigrants, and 4,097 the excess of births over deaths. The number
of females to 100 males af that date was
The total mileage of Government railways to 30th June,
Government 1906, was 1,612. The net financial result for that year,
Railways. taking interest on cost and result of working traffic
conjointly, shows a profit of �84,224. Arrangements
have been made for a considerable development of the railway system of
the State, in the interests of the goldfields and of the increasing demands
for agricultural settlement. On the 31st December, 1906, there were
162 miles of railway under construction, for the development of agricul-
tural centres. In addition to the Government lines, there are 627 miles
of railway owned privately?277 miles by the Midland Railway of
Western Australia, and 350 miles by the various timber companies.
The Revenue of the State for the year ending 30th June,
Revenue, �Scc. 1906, was �3,972,778, being at the rate of �l5 10s. nd.
per head of mean population. The Public Debt at that
time amounted to �18,058,553, of which �14,693,891- ?nearly five-sixths
of the whole debt ?was expended on railways, tramways, harbours, water
supply and sewerage, &c.?all reproductive public works. Provision is
made for the redemption of this debt, by a sinking fund, which at date
amounts to over �1,320,000. The instalments of this fund are placed in
the hands of trustees in London to be invested and from time to time
applied to the redemption of loans falling due. The net indebtedness of
the State represents �64 3s. Bd. per head of mean population.
The total trade (value of exports and imports combined) for the
year ending 30th June, 1905, was �16,352,893, or �65 7s. 2d. per head of
mean population. Of this amount �14,738,930, or about 8/gths of the
whole, represents the trade done with Great Britain and her Depen-
dencies.


State schools are established wherever an average
Education attendance of 20 children, between the ages of six and
and 14 years, can be guaranteed. The State school system
Religion. is compulsory and free. The Bible is read without
comment, half-an-hour before the school begins, to
children whose parents express no objection to their attending the same.
The Government seeks in every way to develop a sound system of
education throughout the State, even in the sparsely-populated districts,
and has also adopted a scheme of technical education suited to the
requirements of the mining and agricultural districts.
The State possesses large areas of land suitable for agri-
Lands culture, fruit growing, and sheep and cattle raising,
Available. besides great stretches of mineral bearing country. It
is estimated by the Royal Commission on Immigration
that there are 180 million acres of land in the southern portion of the State
on which wheat may be profitably cultivated, while there are over 300,000
square miles of territory suited to the pastoralist and stock raiser. Much
of the land open for selection in the south-west is within comparatively
easy reach of the coastal towns or of the railways, which are being rapidly
extended throughout the division.
PRODUCTS.
The leading products of the State consist of gold and other minerals,
sheep and cattle, wheat, grapes, oranges, apples and other fruits, timber,
and pearls and pearl-shell.
The chief product at present is gold. The value of the
Gold. output for the year ending 31st December, 1905, was
�8.305,652, the dividends paid by the gold mining com-
panies for that period being �2,167,639. The total yield to 31st December,
1905, was �63,170.911, and the total amount of dividends paid �13,739,842.
The output of 1905 was equal to 47 per cent, ofthe total gold yield of Australia
for that year. Though there has recently been some falling off in the
returns of the larger and richer mines, especially those at Kalgoorlie, on
account of the exhaustion of the higher grade ores, the excellent results
obtained in treating refractory and low grade ores, and in economising the
methods of treatment, and the opening up of new fields, assure the growing
prosperity of this great industry. The Coolgardie water supply scheme,
one of the greatest engineering feats of the day, has proved of great
service to the eastern goldfields, and has fully realised the object of its
promoters.


Other minerals, coal, copper, tin, lead, silver, iron ore, graphite, &c.,
are being exploited, and will, in the near future, be a source of consider-
able revenue.
The sheep industry of the State is practically in its
Sheep and infancy ; but seeing that the pastures in the western
Cattle. divisions are good, the rainfall ample, and that abundant
feed is available for stock, the prospects are excellent.
At present the number of sheep depastured is about 3,000,000.
A recent consignment of 422 frozen lambs to the London market,
averaging 32 lbs. to 34 lbs. per carcase, fetched top prices, and indicates
a promising development of this industry. The ranches of the north-west
are among the finest cattle stations of Australia, while dairy farming on a
large scale may be carried on with every prospect of success in the
agricultural districts, where pigs and poultry also thrive well.
Wheat promises to be another ? gold-mine ? to the State.
Wheat. Whereas only 244,000 bushels were produced in 1897,
some 2,500,000 bushels were raised last season. The
chief wheat fields are in the eastern part of the south-western division.
Most of the land here is of a gently undulating character, and, being lightly
timbered, is cheaply and easily cleared. Oats, barley, and other cereals
also thrive in these districts. The area under crop in 1899 was 35,515
acres. Last year the acreage was 215,930,
English and sub-tropical fruits of every kind flourish in
Fruit. the State, particularly grapes, oranges, apples, pears,
and all classes of stone fruit. Speaking at the Australian
Fruitgrowers? Interstate Conference recently, Mr. Piesse, a delegate
from Western Australia, referring to the progress made in the fruit
industry in that State, said : ?For many years most of the requirements
in that direction have been supplied by imports from the Eastern States;
but that position has now been altered, and it may not be long before
West Australia will be conducting an export trade. Whereas ten years
ago the area under fruit was 3,393 acres, this year it has increased to
11,026 acres. Again, the imports last year amounted to 142,000 cases,
but for the first seven months of this year they have totalled only 24,700
cases, and are falling off rapidly.? The soil and climate are specially
suited for the production of grapes and oranges. Excellent wine is
being made, and, with the extension of the industry on sound lines,
should command a ready market outside the State. Consignments of
oranges and apples sent to Europe last year were highly commended, and
in the latter case realised highest market prices in London and Hamburg.


Bee culture, market gardening, and other small agricultural
industries may be earned on most successfully in many parts of the
State.
The question of markets for his produce is one of the
Markets for most important for the agricultural settler. At present,
Produce. those provided in the State itself are ample. The
coastal towns and the goldfields districts are large con-
sumers, and, with the development of the gold-mining industry, will
become an increasing market, since agricultural production in the area
of the goldfields themselves is not practicable on a large scale. The
annual value of farm products at present imported, all of which can and
will be locally produced, is one-and a-half million sterling (�T,500,000).
But in addition to the home market, there is the certainty of a large
export trade in cereals and fruits with South Africa, the British Isles,
and the Continent of Europe, for Western Australia is the nearest of all
the States of the Commonwealth to the markets of the Old World.
Forests are an important physical feature of the south-
Timber. west portion of the State. They cover an area of some
30,000 square miles. The export value of timber has
increased from �63,000 in 1889 t0 �689,960 in 1905.
There has been a considerable trade done during the last two or three
years in mallet bark for tanning purposes. Other forest products are
being exploited with very promising results.
The pearling industry, which is carried on along the
Pearls and
north-west coast, especially at Shark?s Bay, Broome, and
Pearl-Shell. n , ~, , r a
Cossack, yielded �266,832 in 1905.
THE LAND.
The most valuable asset of the State consists of its land,
Liberal of which 459,185,158 acres are neither alienated, in
Concessions. process of alienation, nor leased. While a considerable
portion of this immense area may be regarded as unsuited
to settlement, there are millions of acres which may be occupied and
profitably worked. In order to induce settlers to take up such areas
the Goverrnent is prepared to grant the following Liberal Concessions
in the agricultural districts :
1. A Free Homestead Farm of 160 acres for�i. Conditions:
Personal residence for 5 year's; habitable house (value �3O) to be


erected; boundaries to be fenced, a quarter of the area to be cleared
and cropped within 7 years. In case of very heavy clearing, nature
or situation of land, or composition of soil, the Minister may allow
easier conditions for improvements.
2. Conditional Purchase Lands. ?From 100 acres to
1,000 acres at 10s. per acre, payable in 40 half-yearly instaments at
the rate of 3d. per acre. Conditions : Personal residence for 5 years,
one-tenth of boundaries to be fenced within 2 years, the whole within
5 years, and improvements to the full value of purchase money to be
made within 10 years. Half the value of boundary fence may be
allowed in estimating value of improvements. Conditional purchase
lands may also be selected without the condition of residence, in
which case double the value of improvements is required.
3. Lands for Orchards, Vineyards or Gardens, from sto
50 acres, from 20s. per acre, payable in 3 years. Improvements,
including fence, to be completed in 3 years.
4. Half Cost of Survey must be paid in two instalments?
the first being paid with the application and the second within
12 months.
5. The Agricultural Bank renders monetary assistance to
enable settlers to effect improvements when the land has been
substantially fenced.
6. On a selector proceeding to any district for the purpose of
selecting land, the nearest Land Agent will supply all information,
plans and pamphlets, as well as a guide to conduct him to available
land free of charge. In the event of an application for land being made,
with the necessary deposit, a refund of railway fare may be obtained,
if the deposit on land selected is equal to 50 per cent, more than the
amount of the fare, and provided the application for refund is
supported by a certificate from a Government Land Agent stating
the place from which the selector proceeded for the purpose of
selecting.
7. The Railway Department grants a special concession in the
way of fares and freights for a new selector?s family and goods on
production of a certificate of bona fides from the Lands Department.
Any selector of an area of not less than 500 acres first-class land may
obtain from the Lands Department an order for railway tickets and


freight for his family, goods and chattels, from the station nearest his
present or late residence to the station nearest the land selected, the
amount to be repaid to the Department by the selector by bills at
12 or 24 months, with 5 per cent, interest added ; until the bills are
paid the land cannot be transferred or mortgaged except to the
Agricultural Bank.
8. Any new selector residing on his land can arrange passages
for his wife and family to the State through the Colonial Secretary?s
Department.
9. Duty on imported stock, &c., owned by new settler, may, in
the discretion of the Minister, be paid by the Department, to be
repaid by the owner in a manner to be arranged.
EXPERIMENTAL FARMS.
The West Australian Government has established two experimental
farms; one is four miles from Narrogin on the Great Southern Railway
(162 miles from Perth), and the other at Chapman, nine miles from Bowes
siding on the Northampton line (337 miles from Perth).
Students are instructed in the cultivation of cereals, root
Instruction, crops, the handling and breeding of stock, including
horses, cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry, and in dairying.
Lectures are given in the evenings, so that both the practical and
theoretical sides of agriculture are taught.
The course extends over two years, but students are not
Fees, &c. compelled to remain the full term. They are expected,
however, to stay at least six months.
The fee is two guineas per annum (which includes board and
lodging, but students have to find their own bed linen, &c.). In return
for their instruction and maintenance they are required to do all kinds of
farm work and to observe the necessary regulations by which the farms
are governed.
The establishment of these farms offers to new comers

and experience of the highest value.
Students availing themselves of the unique opportunity here offered
are expected when leaving the farm to be in a position to take up land on
their own account.

TASMANIA.
Tasmania, the Garden Island State of Australia, is often
Description. called ?The Pearl of the Southern Seas,? or ?The
Halcyon Isle.? Alike in the air apd the scenery of this
favoured land, there is at all seasons of the year during fine weather?
and, excepting on the west coast, fine weather is a delightful and pre-
vailing characteristic?a sense of happy and peaceful tranquility which
speaks indeed of ?halcyon? days, a sense of brightness and peace
enhanced by the surpassing loveliness of the scenery. Tasmania has been
singularly favoured by Nature not less in her position than in the varied
fertility of her soil and her wonderful scenic attractions. All who are
fortunate enough to know the island soon learn to love it.
Emigrants of all kinds to Tasmania are cordially welcomed,
both those who are going to work and earn a living or those who settle
there with a small income or competence in order to avail themselves of
the climate and the many advantages offered. A number of visitors
from the Old Country and the adjoining States of Australia and from
New Zealand visit Tasmania every year.
The island has an area of 26,215 square miles and is
Area, nearly as large as Ireland. It is situated at the southern
extremity of Australia from which it is divided by Bass
Strait of 120 miles wide. It was discovered by the Dutch navigator
Tasman in the year 1642, and by him named Van Diemen?s Land. At
the end of the next century it was visited by Cook and other voyagers, but
was not inhabited by Europeans till the year 1804, when some colonists
from New South Wales settled in the south of the island. The name
Van Diemen?s Land was subsequently changed to that of Tasmania in
honour of the original discoverer.
Tasmania, with its 55 adjacent islands, comprises
Crown Lands, altogether about 17,000,000 acres. Nearly 5,000,000
acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown,
leaving in the hands of the Government over 12,000,000 acres, of which
a portion is leased to settlers for sheep-runs or other purposes.
The estimated population on the 31st December, 1905,
Population. 0
1 was 182,000.
The whole surface of the island is diversified with forests,
General rich valleys and plains, and mountains rising to 4,000 and
Features. 5,000 feet, while running streams abound in all parts.
With the exception of some of the western parts of the
island, which are for the most pant densely wooded, and where the coast


is rugged and exposed to frequent storms, the country is more or less
dotted with settlers. In some parts, notably in the north-west, the soil
is very rich, and when the timber is cleared, becomes excellent agricul-
tural land.
The best agricultural districts are in the north and north-west of the
State. The State produces apples and fruit of all kinds in perfection and
great abundance. The midlands are given over to sheep, Tasmania
sending to the other States of the Commonwealth annual draughts of
studs of the best blood to be found in the world.
There are 618 miles of Government and private railways
Railways. open. The principal line runs from Hobart to
Launceston (133 miles), passing through the centre of the
island (see Map).
It may be taken generally that, where there are no
Coaches. steamers or railways, most of the towns are connected
with Launceston or Hobart by coach, so that there is a
fairly complete network of intercommunication throughout the island.
GENERAL CONDITIONS.
Tasmania has a Governor appointed by the Crown,
Government, usually for a term of six years, and a Parliament con-
sisting of two Houses ?the Legislative Council with 18
members, and a Legislative Assembly with 35 members. Electors for the
House of Assembly are both male and female of 21 years of age, and are
qualified by having been resident in Tasmania for a period of 12 months.
Justice. Laws are for the most part identical with those of England.
The climate is an admirable one, very healthy, congenial
Climate. and bracing. The winter is of course cold, with rain and
frost and occasional snow, but it is much warmer than in
England, and on most days there is a period of bright sunshine. Snow
seldom falls or remains on the ground more than a few hours except on
high levels. The summers, though rather hotter than in England, are
not so hot as those in Australia, and the air is dry and seldom sultry.
At Hobart, the mean maximum temperature for a month is about
62 degrees, and the mean minimum 45 degrees; the temperature ranges
from about 30 degrees to too degrees, but such extremes are infrequent ;
the mean daily range is only 19 degrees. At Launceston, the mean
maximum is about 64 degrees aud the mean minimum 44 degrees.


Many diseases which in England are often serious are in this
climate comparatively slight, and the rate of infant mortality is particularly
low. An excellent testimony to the geniality and salubrity of the climate
is the large number of persons who retire to Tasmania from all parts of
the Empire, there to spend the evening of life in peace and comfort, and
the vast number of tourists who annually visit Tasmania. In Tasmania,
as in the other States of Australia, the time of the summer and winter
seasons is the reverse of the time of the seasons in the Old World.
Tasmania is one of the healthiest countries in the world.
Health. In one year its death-rate was as low as io - 88 and it has
never been higher than 14-17 per thousand. This com-
pares very favourably with such countries as Great Britain, where the
death-rate reaches ig per thousand.
The rainfall is variable, though plentiful, in all parts of
Rainfall. the State; that at Hobart is from 18 to 30 inches a year,
each month having some rain. Launceston and the North
Coast have more rain. In the interior there are, on an average of years,
about 21 inches at Oatlands and 18 at Hamilton. On the East Coast,
Swansea has 27 inches, and Southport, on the South Coast, has about
40 inches. The West and South-West Coasts are always very wet, Mount
Bischoff having about 79 inches a year, Zeehan gi, and Mount Lyell 116.
The City of Hobart is the. capital of Tasmania and the
Hobart. seat of Government, and is situated at the south of the
island, on the lovely River Derwent, about 12 miles
above the river?s junction with the sea. It possesses a magnificent harbour,
easy of access, well sheltered from all winds and capable of receiving the
largest ships afloat. Any battleship of the British Navy or the largest
leviathan of the Cunard Company can be berthed alongside one of the
wharves at Hobart. The city is picturesquely situated at the foot of
Mount Wellington, which towers above it more than 4,000 feet high. The
city contains excellent hotels, fine churches, extensive and fine public
buildings, including a good public library, and all the up-to-date appoint-
ments of a modern town.
The City of Launceston is beautifully situated at the
Launceston, north of the island on the River Tamar, and is a con-
siderable shipping port. There are several small ports
on the North-West and West Coasts.


There are occasional sailing ships which go from
External England direct to Hobart and Launceston. There are
Communica- also direct lines of steamers from England to Hobart,
tion. viz., the Shaw, Savill and Albion Company and the New
Zealand Company, Steamers by one or other of the
above lines go direct to Hobart via the Cape every fortnight. Passengers
may also go by many lines of steamers via the Suez Canal and Melbourne,
or via the Cape and Melbourne, such as the Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company, the Orient-Royal Mail Line, and White
Star Line, the Aberdeen Line and the Federal-Houlder-Shire Line, &c.
Passengers going by these lines are booked through to Hobart or
Launceston from Melbourne. There is a first-class service of steamers
between Melbourne and Tasmania, and the voyage does not extend to
many hours if a passenger goes to a northern port. He can then proceed
by rail if he wishes to go to Hobart.
There are at present no free, assisted, or nominated
Fares. passages to Tasmania. The fares by steamer vary
according to the line and class of steamer from about
to for the first saloon, from to second saloon and from
�l5 to third class. The White Star Line carries one class of
passenger only, and charges a rate from �l9 up to according to the
accommodation.
Summer commences in December, and the best months
Best Time in which to arrive are from December to May inclusive,
to Arrive. but any time of the year is suitable. Emigrants should
write to their friends, if they have any, beforehand,
mentioning their trade and the ship they are coming by, and should
obtain advice from the Agent-General for Tasmania at No. 5, Victoria
Street, Westminster, S.W. Emigrants will receive information and
advice from all public officials, and they are recommended in the first
instance to apply to the Office of the Under-Secretary, Public Buildings,
Hobart. Women should also apply at the Young Women?s Institute,
Goie House, 104, Murray Street, Hobart.
Various religious bodies have their churches and chapels
Religion. as in England. There is no State Church, but each body
manages its own affairs. According to the census of
1901, 50 per cent, of the population were Church of England, 18 per cent.
Roman Catholics, 15 per cent. Methodists, and the remainder other
Nonconformists.


Great attention is paid to this matter, and a splendid
Education, system of education obtains. Education is compulsory
in the public schools for children not less than seven or
more than 13 years of age, unless the child is being properly educated
otherwise. Fees of 4d. and gd. per child per week are charged according
to the number of children in the family, but special exemption is made on
the ground of poverty, and in Hobart and Launceston schools may be
established for poor children in which no fees shall be charged. The
teaching in the State schools is entirely unsectarian, but opportunities
are given for religious instruction, according to the parents? religion,
where desired.
Private and Besides the State schools there are many grammar,
Technical private and technical schools. There is also a School of
Schools. Mines at Zeehan, Queenstown and Beaconsfield.
There is a well-equipped University at Hobart, with
University, competent professors. There are several exhibitions
and scholarships to be competed for.
A very good system of postal, telegraphic and telephonic
Postal and communication exists. There are banks, building
Banking societies, libraries, mechanics? institutes, hospitals and
Facilities. charitable institutions. There are also various savings
banks, including post-office savings banks, and the aggre-
gate deposits and the number of depositors are increasing every year;
about one out of every five persons is a depositor. The total amount
of deposits held by the banking institutions in Tasmania at the close
of 1905, including ordinary banks and savings banks, amounted to
T5A59,4 2 3-
PRODUCTS.
The soil and climate of Tasmania are favourable to the
Produce. cultivation of all the English cereals, fruits, trees and
plants, and on account of the mildness of the winters and
the greater amount of sunshine, their growth is more rapid and the pro-
duction of fruit especially is much more certain and abundant than it is in
England. Many plants, such as the geranium, which would not survive
a winter in England, grow luxuriantly without any protection. Good
crops of wheat, oats, barley, peas .and hops are produced ; potatoes are
the chief root crop; turnips, mangel wurzel, carrots and onions are also
grown. Three-fourths of the potatoes and nearly half the turnips are


raised in the north-west division of Deloraine, Emu Bay, Latrobe,
Mersey, West Devon and Russell, where the land is extremely suitable.
The rich lands of Tasmania often produce phenomenal crops ; in a recent
potato growing competition the winning paddock topped the poll with
more than 20 tons to the acre, but the normal crops of potatoes grow
from three to six tons per acre.
All English fruits grow excellently throughout all the
Gardens and settled regions, and the acreage of gardens and orchards
Orchards. is steadily increasing. Apples, pears, plums, peaches,
apricots and small fruits, such as strawberries, rasp-
berries, currants and gooseberries ripen in luscious perfection. The soil
and climate is splendidly adapted for the growth of the choicest apples and
pears. The supply of this fruit may be made practically unlimited.
Apples are now being sent in large quantities to the London and Liverpool
markets ; some consignments are also forwarded to Germany. The annual
export of Tasmanian apples to Europe will very soon total 600,000 cases.
Tasmania also exports apples and fruits to New Zealand and the neigh-
bouring States.
The annual total apple and pear harvest is now estimated at
about 1,000,000 bushels. The fruit industry continues to support
hundreds of families and to be one of great and growing importance to
Tasmania, and is chiefly responsible for Hobart being made a port of call
by the Peninsular and Oriental, Orient, White Star and other companies
during the months of February to April. Apples are shipped to London
and other European ports and arrive when the markets there are bare,
thus commanding a ready sale at remunerative prices. There are large
jam factories; fruit pulp is also made and exported.
Dairying is being extensively developed throughout
Dairying - . the island. The beginning was slow, but being
favoured with a suitable climate and rainfall, together
with other natural and favourable conditions, a rapid expansion of the
industry may now be confidently predicted, and a surplus of high-class
dairy produce be made available for export annually. Farmers are
learning to combine, and many dairy companies and well-equipped butter
and cheese factories have been started, all of which carry on a lucrative
business. A dairy expert is employed by the State, whose services are
available for the farmer. The proprietary and co-operative dairying
factories are becoming fairly numerous; they are all equipped with the
most modern machinery and managed by expert men.


Tasmania now not only supplies herself with eggs and
Poultry. poultry, but is becoming an exporter of those articles.
The State farm supplies eggs of the most approved
utility breeds for hatching purposes, and a great many agriculturists
have availed themselves of this means of improving their flocks. The
climate is specially adapted for the raising of poultry, for while it is not
too cold to retard egg production the heat is not of such strength as to
diminish the vigour of the birds. There is a Government expert who
travels through the State lecturing upon the raising of poultry and
advising farmers upon the subject.
It should be mentioned, however, that poultry farming pure and
simple does not, as a rule, appear to yield a good profit in any part of the
world. It must be combined with some agricultural pursuit, and then
with good management it may be made a paying concern.
Tasmania has almost unsurpassed climatic conditions for
Sheep the breeding of high-class stud pedigree sheep. Stud-
Farming. sheep breeding has made marvellous strides, and the
pedigree flocks of Tasmania are known and prized all
through the adjacent States of the Commonwealth. The following
figures bear convincing testimony to the stud-breeding possibilities of
Tasmania. From the year 1871 to 1901 inclusive 114,224 stud sheep
were exported and sold for the value of �1, 114,729. One of these sheep,
the celebrated merino ram called President,? bred by the Honourable
James Gibson, of ? Belle Vue,?? Epping Forest, was sold at the Sydney
sheep sales in 1896 for 1,600 guineas, a record price.
The breeding of merino sheep having been so successful, attention is
now being also turned to the Shropshire. The pick of some of the best
Shropshire flocks in England has, during the last few years, been
bought by Tasmanians, and the breeding of stud Shropshire sheep
will no doubt soon become a great industry.
It may be mentioned that breeders do not go in for a fat stock export
trade because the limited extent of country with the value per acre upon
land for feeding purposes precludes as yet a profitable competition with
New Zealand and the Australian States of the mainland, possessing as
they do extensive areas of open fatting country, which cost a com-
paratively small expenditure of capital, whereas in Tasmania much of
the unimproved Crown Lands would cost from �3 to per acre to
convert them into a similar condition.


Tasmania is wonderfully rich in timber resources.
The Timber Among the ornamental and decorative woods to be found
Industry. in the forests, the most useful is blackwood, much
resembling red cedar, some trees of which have a wavy
or figured grain and show an exceedingly handsome sheen when polished.
Blackwood is extensively used for the better class of furniture, panelling
of railway carriages, &c. The well-known billiard-table makers of
Melbourne, Messrs. Alcock & Sons, have for many years used blackwood
largely in the manufacture of billiard tables. Messrs. Collard & Collard
have also used this very valuable timber for pianos.
The Tasmania myrtle tree is well adapted for panelling cabinet work
and fret work.
The principal timber trees from a commercial point of
Giant view are the genera Eucalyptus, of which there are
Trees. about 18 distinct species, and to these may be added
18 varieties. Many of the eucalyptus giants of the
Tasmanian forests reach a height of 250 feet, with a clean barrel of
100 feet to the first limb, a circumference of over 20 feet measured three
feet from the ground, and contain upwards of 30,000 superficial feet of
marketable timber.
It is from the leaves of the Blue Gum (Eucalyptus
Eucalyptus Globulus) that the famous eucalyptus oil is distilled,
Oil. large quantities of which are exported. A similar oil
extract is also obtained from these leaves, which is used
to prevent the corroding of boilers and other machinery.
The Blue Gum is an exceedingly durable timber for shipbuilding,
wharf construction and decking, piles, jetties, floor-boards and paving-
blocks, and for the manufacture of agricultural implements of all
descriptions. It is one of the best timbers for railway sleepers. The
average life of blue gum sleepers is reported by the local railway
authorities to be 14 years. When dressed the wood takes a good polish,
and is well suited for interior fittings. The wood from young trees up
to 2 feet in diameter is used for cart shafts, spokes, felloes, tool handles,
and for anything requiring toughness, spring and elasticity. The con-
struction of the great harbour at Dover by the Admiralty authorities
has been the means of directing special attention to the wonderful
properties of the Tasmanian blue gum. It is at once one of the
strongest as well as one of the most durable timbers in the world.


The timber known as stringy bark much resembles blue gum, but is
not so heavy. It is a strong and durable wood, and in common use for
general construction and building purposes, also for railway sleepers. It
is especially suited for flooring and paving blocks.
Timber is exported from Tasmania to the adjacent Australian States,
England, India, South Africa and the East. The value of timber
exported for the year 1905 reached nearly but the timber trade
is increasing by leaps and bounds, and a largely increased amount was
exported during 1906.
There are approximately 90 sawmills, of various cutting powers, at
work in the State, but a number of these are small appliances with
portable machinery, which are moved from place to place, where timber
is found to be most accessible. Saw-milling operations are carried on all
over the Island, but by far the most of the mills are situated in the
southern portion, where the timber is in greater quantity and of better
quality.
The larger mills are chiefly employed in cutting timber for the local
market and for export, while the smaller ones are principally engaged
supplying box material required for the export of fruit and jam. The
demand for this class of timber has increased year by year, 7,000,000 super-
fcial feet being now required annually for cases, and there is every prospect
of a continued increase in the quantity of timber that will be required for
this purpose.
A very interesting and instructive pamphlet, entitled ? Tasmanian
Forestry, Timber Products, and Saw-milling Industry,? has been published
by the Department of Lands and Surveys, Tasmania, and may be obtained
free upon application to the Agent-General for Tasmania, 5. Victoria
Street, Westminster, S.W.
It may be mentioned that the best of the agricultural
Lands Crown Lands have passed into private ownership, and that
Available. much of the available good land is still heavily timbered.
The cost of clearing the land is considerable, and this
kind of work should only be tackled by an old and experienced pioneer
and his family. Land, however, partially cleared, with a homestead upon
it, may be bought at a reasonable price.
There is still a considerable quantity of good Crown Land, well
adapted for fruit growing and other purposes, which may be bought
from the Government upon very easy terms.


Any person of 18 years of age and upwards may select an

advances to the selector of any first-class land four-fifths

ments, mode of selection, &c., &c.
MINING.
Tasmania possesses almost every known mineral and
Every known metal, and is, for its size, perhaps richer in mineral
Mineral. deposits than any equal area of any part of the world.
Much of the mineral bearing land is for various reasons
still imperfectly developed, but in localities where mining has been
energetically carried on, works of world-wide importance have been
established.
The tin produced from the Mount Bischoff Mine approximates to
the value of �4,000,000, over �2,000,000 of which has been paid away
to shareholders in dividends. Then there is the famous Mount Lyell
Copper Mine, so ably managed by Mr, Sticht, whose name is a household


word among mining experts. The shares of this profitable venture are
largely held not only in Tasmania and Australia, but in England and other
parts of Europe.
Tasmania produces gold, silver, tin, copper, and lead in profusion.
1 here are also large seams of excellent coal. Coal mining is now becoming
more developed. Iron exists in large quantities in different parts of the
State, and sooner or later will be recognised as an enormous national
asset. The value of minerals raised in Tasmania during the years 1880
to 1904 inclusive amounted to �"21,097,802. The value of minerals raised
during 1905-6 was as follows:?Gold, �"326,125; Silver-lead, �372,243 ;
Copper, �"866,022 ; Tin, �"462,323 ; and Coal, �"42,625.
MANUFACTURES.
Woollen manufactories have for many years been
Woollen successfully carried on. and an opportunity is thus given
Industry. of utilising the magnificent wool grown in Tasmania.
The chief manufacturers are Messrs. James Aiken and
Sons, of Hobart, and the Waverley Woollen Mills of Launceston, The
excellence of the goods turned out at the Tasmanian mills was quickly
made apparent to the public, and to-day the locally-made blankets, serges,
skirtings, rugs and tweeds, are preferred to any imported materials. The
stamp of the Tasmanian woollen manufacturer has come to be regarded
as a hall-mark of quality and a guarantee of excellence and purity.
In addition to the woollen factories, other industries are
Other carried on, such as sawmills, brickyards, potteries,
Industries, tanneries, fell-mongeries, flourmills, barkmills, jam
manufactories, breweries, soap and candle manufac-
tories, boot factories, &c., &c.
Tasmania offers a splendid field for the manufacturer
Water Power, with capital, having regard to the water power which is
available. A report was presented to the Tasmanian
Parliament a few years ago, drawn up by Mr. Rabbek, a Danish engineer
employed by the Government, estimating the water-power available
from certain sources. It appears from this report that the force probably
available from the three central lakes, Lake St. Clair, Lake Echo, and


the Great Lake would be 82,000 actual horse power. Mr. Rabbek, in
the course of his report, says :
? Judging by the rapid strides which have been made during the
last few years by electrical engineers and manufacturers, it is more
than probable that within a few years it will be profitable and
practicable to run all the Tasmanian railways, to supply light all
over the island, to run all motors as well in the mines as anywhere
else within the island by electric power derived from water.?
The water power here mentioned does not by any means exhaust the
water power available in other parts of the island. Already the action of
the Launceston Corporation in harnessing the water of the South Esk is a
striking example of what can be done. The Municipal Council of the
northern City not only works tramways and light in the City by means of
electricity, but is now in a position to supply cheap power.
WHAT TASMANIA OFFERS.
Tasmania offers very good inducements to emigrants,
Prospects for especially those experienced in farming and agriculture,
Emigrants, with some amount of capital. For farming on a small scale
about �5OO would be advisable, but so much depends
upon circumstances, upon the capacity of the farmer, and whether he has a
family who can assist him. Given a steady, intelligent and hard-working
man of experience and of some business aptitude, he ought to succeed in
making a good living ; much, of course, depends upon the individual.
There is also an opening for men with, say, �?.200 or T3��> if they
are prepared tor some time to undertake the work of agricultural labourers
for wages, and gradually become small freehold proprietors. Having
regard to the resources of Tasmania, its soil, climate and markets, there
seems no doubt that such a man would find the life there infinitely
preferable in many ways to life as a small farmer in England.
Anyone who can command a few hundred pounds and has had some
experience on a farm will find in the Island State of Tasmania possibilities
far beyond those of the Old Country.


Tasmania offers many advantages to a man of small income in search
of a comfortable home, an equable and temperate climate, and pleasant
society. There is no such poverty there as in England. The necessaries
of life are cheap, wages are high, and a man with a family will often have
a much better chance of placing out his children well than he would have
at home.
Experienced and steady agricultural labourers would also do well even
without any capital.
Capital should not be invested until after the expiration
Investment of about two years? of practical, local experience,
of Capital. Experience alone will enable a man to decide what kind
of farming to go in for, and in what direction he feels
likely to succeed For instance, there is dairying, which includes butter and
cheese making, with the utilisation of skim milk for bringing out dairy-fed
bacon and porkers, and in connection with which, provided the farmer
starts with a good milking strain of cattle, he may frequently have an
excellent animal to sell for stud purposes to his neighbour, or a milch cow
to dispose of.
Then there is fruit growing. A newly planted orchard would take
seven or eight years to come into full bearing, but a beginning may be
made by the purchase of land partially cleared and planted. Given a
suitable farm, dairying combined with pig keeping, poultry raising
and an orchard, may prove a sufficient number of lines to make a paying
business in good hands, or one line alone may be followed, according to
circumstances.
Again there may be a lot of rough land on the place on
Useful which a few sheep may run, or a young horse or two be
Hints. brought out. The emigrant could specialise or try mixed
farming, having regard to the situation of his farm and the
means at his disposal. Of course, he should begin in a stnall way in the
first instance, and gradually increase his operations whenever possible.
He should watch an opportunity for buying cleared or partly cleared
land with a small homestead upon it, and these opportunities occasionally
occur. This is a far better plan form beginner than taking up uncleared
Crown land. The bush and forest lands are expensive to clear, and this
work is better undertaken by an old and experienced hand. Crown lands


are sold so cheaply that the emigrant by degrees and with experience
could buy a few acres and gradually clear it, and in time he would reap
some return from it.
Many opportunities for sports and pastimes of all sorts
Sports. are to be found in Tasmania ; indeed, as a matter of fact,
there is probably no country where a man with limited
means can get more enjoyment in the way of out-door sports and pastimes
than in Tasmania, For instance, the case of yachting may be regarded
as a national and all-the-year pastime. Many of the young men employed
in the shops and offices of Hobart, and whose salaries run from 30s. to
a week, own small yachts or have a part share in one. There is no capital city
in the world which has a finer yachting ground at its very doors than Hobart.
The yearly holiday and other holidays which many young men secure is
often spent in a week?s or a fortnight?s cruise among the many sheltered
waters which reach either way from Hobart for many miles. Such expedi-
tions, besides being a delightful variation in the year?s work, cost practically
nothing. A few necessary groceries are put on board ?bread and other
supplies can be purchased at any of the picturesque townships which dot
the banks of these inland seas ?while the larder can generally be
replenished at any time by the fish which are so abundant along the coast-
line, For sportsmen there are kangaroo, opossum, wild duck, quail,
wattle-bird and black swan. Fishing offers great attractions. There is
the salt water and deep sea fishing along all the coasts of the Island, while
the rivers and lakes afford excellent sport for the English trout and salmon
trout which have been thoroughly acclimatised ?and for mullet and
bream.
The great advantage of trout fishing in Tasmania is that nearly
all the waters are free to any person who pays a small Government
licence. In the Huon River some time ago a salmon trout weighing
29 lbs. was caught, while in the Great Lake, which has been termed ? The
Angler?s Paradise,? 53 acclimatised English trout were caught by three
rods in 12 days, the average weight per fish being 9 lbs.
For young men there are, of course, the ordinary English manly
sports of cricket, football, &c., and it should be mentioned that at
Hobart there is a Royal Tennis Court ?such as the courts at Lords and
at Hampton Court, &c. The golf links at Hobart, overlooking the River
Derwent, would delight the heart of any enthusiast in the game; and
there are other links in various parts of the State.


THE COST OF LIVING.
The cost of living compared to earnings is low, especially
Rent. if no house rent is paid. Small cottages in Hobart,
Launceston, and suburbs, with three rooms, cost per
week 4s. to 65., or with garden also, 4s. to 75.; those with four to five
rooms cost 7s. to 125., or with kitchen and garden, Bs. to 155.; larger
houses cost to �&� a year ; in country districts the rent is about 3s.
to 7s. a week for four rooms, and Bs. to 12s. in mining districts.
Board and lodging in towns cost 15s. to 30s. per week, and about
12s. to 225. 6d. in the country.
The average retail cost per lb. of provisions, &c., at
Provisions, &c. Hobart is as follows : Bacon, gd.; beef, 3d.; bread, 3d.
per 2-lb. loaf; butter, rod. to is.; candles, 4d. ; cheese,
Bd.; coals, 20s. to 255. per ton; coffee, is. gd. ; egg s, is. a dozen; fire-
wood, 14s. per ton ; gas, 7s. 6d. per 1 000 cubic feet ; kerosene oil, is. 2d.
per gallon ; milk, 4d. per quart ; mutton, ; pork. ; potatoes, 4s.
per cwt.; sugar, 2-|d. ; tea, gd. to 2s. ; tobacco, ss. to 6s.
Clothing. Clothing is a little dearer than it is in England.
Wages in the State are approximately as follows. As
Wages. wages are liable to change, these rates must not be relied
on too strictly :
1. ?Without board and lodging. (1) Per day of 8 to 10 hours:
Bakers, ss. to gs. ; bootmakers, 6s. to 75.; bricklayers, 7s. to 125.;

In some mining districts the wages are higher and the cost of
necessaries more expensive.
Note. ?Farm labourers in Tasmania are usually boarded and
lodged; and single men are, as a rule, preferred to
married men with families, unless the latter can work also.
A high rate of wages does not necessarily imply a demand
for labour. No beer or beer money is given to servants,
and the cost of keeping them is much less than it is in
England.
THE DEMAND FOR LABOUR.
In a comparatively small community, particular branches
Mechanics, of industry are easily overstocked for a time, and mechanics
must be prepared, if necessary, to do occasionally other
work than that to which they have been accustomed. Trades are not
so sharply defined as in England ; a carpenter, for instance, will often be
called upon to act as a joiner, wheelwright, cobper, &c., and a bricklayer
as mason or stonecutter.
Emigrants should accept the first fair offer of work, even though
it may be outside their own particular trade. Competent country
blacksmiths, farriers, and other mechanics can generally do well, but at
the present time there is no special demand for them. They can buy land
cheaply, and advantageously employ their spare time in poultry-raising or
butter-making. The best opening is at Zeehan, Queenstown and other
mining towns, which are gradually rising on the West Coast, where the
demand for men, such as fitters, increases as the mines develop; but
incompetent men are not wanted.


Farm and , ,
General is not much demand for general labourers, but
, , skilled farm labourers should do well.
Labourers.
There is an opening for a limited number of
Miners. experienced miners at the various gold, silver, tin and
copper mines.
There are plenty of fish around the coast and islands, and
Fishermen, a man who could combine fishing with the cultivation of a
plot of ground would generally make a good living, but he
would require a little capital at first for fishing tackle. &c. A sea-going boat
costs about � too, and nets and lines �o.o. There is plenty of good timber
on the spot for building boats.
There is a fair demand for women and girls as domestic
Women and servants, sempstresses, dressmakers, machinists, Ac., but
Girls. not for shop assistants, or those unaccustomed to work at
a trade.
Clerks Clerks, shopmen and warehousemen are warned against
emigrating.
TASMANIA?S AMENITIES.
Not by any means the least attractive feature in Tasmania
The Social is its social life. People are sociable and hospitable in a
Side. quiet and unostentatious manner. Newcomers are
esteemed for what they are rather than for the extent of
their banking account. In the summer months there is quite a gay
? season,? especially in Hobart. During this season the Admiral of
the Australian Station generally anchors his fleet in the noble harbour
of the Derwent, the ships lying within a short distance of the shore.
Naval officers and visitors from the Old Country and the neighbouring
Australian States always enjoy their stay in Hobart.


Having regard to the many and varied attractions of
For People Tasmania, its climate, the opportunity offered for sport,
of Moderate the system of education for children and students, and
Incomes. the cheerful and homely life of its people, there can be
no doubt that the island is much to be desired as a place
for families with small incomes to settle in. The conditions of life are
very pleasant; there are no extremes of riches or poverty, and it is
possible to live as economically as one may wish.
Take the case of Indian pensioners, whether military or civil.
Some of these families find it better to proceed to 1 asmania to form
fresh associations in a new country with a genial climate than to return
to England to find their old associates and friends departed, themselves
forgotten, and nothing left to do than to sit shivering over a fire and
(metaphorically speaking) curse the decline of the rupee.
Then there is the case of many people who, from circumscribed means,
are obliged to live in England in a small suburban villa, unable to take
part in all the expensive social life of London. For families such as these,
with a small certain income, Tasmania is an ideal place. Taking one
thing with another, the cost of living upon the whole is not greater than in
England, for although the high tariff of the Commonwealth prevails, there
are yet many of the comforts and necessaries of life which may be obtained
more cheaply than in the Old Country. Then the life is a freer one with
less ostentation than obtains in England, and therefore less calls upon the
pocket.
His Excellency Sir Gerald Strickland andthe Lady Edeline Strickland,
who so graciously preside at Government House, do much for the people
of Tasmania and their visitors.
For further particulars respecting the State of Tasmania apply to the
Agent-General for Tasmania, 5, Victoria Street, London, S.W., where
Tasmanian newspapers, Acts of Parliament, books and reports on the
State may be seen. The Agent-General distributes pamphlets and
reports of various kinds free of charge and he is always pleased to see
personally anyone desirous of emigrating to Tasmania, so as to answer any
enquiries and to give all possible information.

NEW GUINEA. .
British New Guinea, which was included in the jurisdiction of the
Australian Commonwealth in 1901, has a territory of upwards of 90,000
square miles, so it is a little larger than the State of Victoria. In the
matter of its vegetation and animals it resembles Australia.
Its rainfall is abundant, with an average of 40 inches in the driest
regions, and upwards of 120 inches at the eastern end.
The island, which will now be known as Papua, is of volcanic origin,
and in many parts is likely to produce excellent crops of sugar, coffee,
tobacco and other tropical plants. At present the island does not come
under all the provisions of the Constitution, and so trade and intercourse
with the Commonwealth is not as free as between the various States.
The natives are as a rule a law-abiding race, and crime
Natives. is rare. There are four Missionary Societies at work,
scattered along the coast but though the Government
has now established its authority over practically the whole of its coast
line it is undesirable for white settlers to attempt to penetrate beyond the
controlled regions, unless under Government supervision.
At present the country is looked upon as somewhat
Climate. unhealthy for Europeans to settle in, but, as with other
tropical countries, it is likely that as settlement proceeds
the island will become healthy.
Gold is found in considerable quantities, and last year
Gold. the exports were stated at about but to engage
in mining in New Guinea a man requires some capital,
the work being carried on by natives whose wages vary from 10s. to �1 a
month, with keep.


NEW GUINEA.
Other Cattle and horses do well in New Guinea, but so far
Industries. not much has been attempted in this line.
Great attention is paid to the cultivation of cocoa-nuts, the export of
copra being very profitable.
Government land is leased for cocoa-nut plantations for
Land Grants. 60 years. The first five years rent free, second five
6d. per acre, and is. per acre is charged for the balance
of the period.
The island also offers excellent opportunities for the successful
cultivation of rubber and cotton.
The British possessions in the Island lie to the South East. The
rest of the Island belongs ?69,000 square miles to Germany, and 95,000
square miles to Holland.
