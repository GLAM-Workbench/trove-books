I THE
Beal Sir Eager
I would take h'm by the nose,
-uid souse hm in the river,
i have got in a mess,
The truth to you I will state.
They took poor Wagga Wagga,
And they?ve shoved me into Newgate
And there I shall be tried ?
Till the sessions I am stopping?
They called me a butcher?s son,
And father sold sheep?s heads at
Wapping.
Oh poor Wagga Wagga,
They?ll find me an artful dodger,
And I will let them see,
That I shall be Sir Roger.
I had a mother once,
Unfortunately I lost her.
They swore through bars and walls,
And called me an imposture ;
Tim cove who questioned me,|
Was a very artful dodger.
But I will let them see,?
That I will he called Sir Roger,
The chaps in gowns and wigs,
Were naught but jaw and jabber,
There?s one of them I wish
Was sent fo Wagga-wagga ;
And feed him seven years
On old Orton?s bullock?s liver.
You London pretty maids.
Do you want a .young man lodger.
Or will you marry me,
And be the lady of Sir Roger ;
Titchbourne is my name,
I have been to Deal and Dover,
If you saw me in my skin.
You would find me tattooed all over
I never lived at Wapping,
I was never a coal porter,
My father was not a man
That dealt in fat and trotters ;
Why they swore so hard at me,
With their big brains and jagga,
You might hear them frcr.i Tower Hill,
All the way to Wagga-wagga.
Oh did I not stand it well,
Against the rum old codgers.
But never mind my boys,
I yet shall be Sir Roger ;
And when I have a son,
He shall be a gentleman of Tichbourne
He shall have houses, pigs, and cows.
Yes,the glorious Sir RogerWichhonme
Oh ! did net they rail at me,
I am sure they did like fury,
I?ceuld swaiiOv a I the wigs,
Counsellors, Judge, and Jury
Weil I suppose awhile.
lu quod I must he stopping,
And when 1 get discharged.
I?ll haveja butcher?s shop at Wapping
Disley, Printer, London.
