EMANUEL PHILLIPS FOX (1865 -I9IS)


EMANUEL PHILLIPS FOX was born on March 12, 1865, at
Fitzroy, Melbourne. At an early age he showed such an aptitude for
drawing that he was placed under the guidance of an art teacher.
When fifteen years of age he passed his matriculation examination,
being at the same time a pupil under Mr. Campbell, at the National
Gallery, Melbourne. He later held the position of drawing master
in several schools of design, studying painting meanwhile under G. F.
Folingsby who was appointed Director of the National Gallery,
Melbourne, and master of its school in 1882.
In 1885, when twenty years of age, Phillips Fox won first prize
for landscape painting, and two years later left for Paris where he
studied at Juliens Academy and, under Bougereau and Gerome, at the
Beaux Arts. After exhibiting in Paris at the Salon des Artists Francais
in 1890, he returned to Australia and, in December, 1892, held an
exhibition in Melbourne.


M lombS,
In the following year he established the first Australian Summer
School at Chartersville, Victoria, and, with Tudor St. George Tucker,
the Melbourne School of Art: in 1894, Fox was awarded a Gold Medal
for “MY COUSIN ” (now in the National Gallery Collection, Mel-
bourne), being the first Australian to receive that honour.
Portraits, landscapes and teaching occupied the next few years:
in 1901, the Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria commissioned
him to paint “ The Landing of Captain Cook, Botany Bay, 1770,” now
in the possession of the Public Library and reproduced in colour in
this catalogue. After making the preliminary studies he left again
for London in 1902, where the picture was painted and afterwards
exhibited before being sent to Australia.
The years 1903-4 were spent painting portraits in London and
in May, 1905, he married Miss Ethel Carrick a former Slade School
Student, and went to Paris where he lived and worked on the left
bank of the Seine, fifteen minutes from the City.
Fox was now a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy and
each year went to London for the Exhibition. At this time also he
was exhibiting at the Salon des Beaux Arts where he was elected an
Associate in 1908.
Nineteen hundred and six and 1907 were spent in travelling,
working, and seeing the great collections in Spain and Venice; in 1908
he was again in Australia but, after an important exhibition of his
work in Melbourne, was back in Paris by the end of the year.
Full Salon Honours were conferred on him in 1909, he again
being the first Australian to be so honoured.
In 1913, after painting in the south of France, he re-visited
Australia where he executed a number of important portrait commis-
sions, including that of the then Prime Minister, the Right Honourable
Andrew Fisher, now hanging in Parliament House, Canberra, A.C.T.
Phillips Fox was in Tahiti at the outbreak of the 1914-1918 war
and on his return to Australia, organised a large Art Union in 1915,
the proceeds being used in purchasing a Red Cross Lorry which was
sent to France from “ the Artists of Australia.”
Soon after finishing the portrait of Lord Forrest, now in Perth
Gallery, he died on October Bth, 1915.


EMANUEL PHILLIPS FOX, although a teacher of art in Melbourne
for many years after his return from Paris in 1892, in his work possessed none of the
pretentiousness or labour of the academies. His canvases include some of the finest
in Australian painting. He possessed a French love of his craft; there is a delicate
tactile sensuousness about his handling of pigment that makes his work as modern
as when it was painted. His nudes are living creatures possessing the vibrancy of life
in their flesh tints. It is his attitude to his art and his fine realization of colour
sensations, rather than any superficial likeness in technique, that makes Fox the
Australian Renoir. He exploited the technical resources of broken colour to the full
and, although his colour harmonies are rich and varied, they are always admirably
restrained. Fox was able to achieve that indefinable lyrical quality that makes the
colour of a first-rate Impressionist painting sing even in its lowest registers. “ The Art
Students ” in the Sydney Gallery, “ Rest,” “ The Arbour,” and “ Reverie ” are
some of the most notable of his many fine compositions. Streeton will be remembered
for his contribution to an Australian vision in Landscape, but in the realm of values
Phillips Fox was, without doubt, one of the greatest of Australia’s Impressionist painters,
and the most gifted of her colourists.
