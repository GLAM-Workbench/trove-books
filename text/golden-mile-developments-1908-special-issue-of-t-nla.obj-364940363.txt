THE “ GOLDEN MILE ” DEVELOPMENTS , /po*.
PREPARATORY.
There is no need for apology for this special number
of the West Australian Mining, Building and
Engineering Journal, for it is the second —the first
was “ A Golden State’s Mines : Ore Treatment and
How it is Done : chiefly on the Golden Mile,” on
August 8, 1903 —and in that publication we placed
on record, in a small way, the first description of the
gold recovery processes in operation on the world’s
most valuable sulpho-telluride area, a gold bearing
block, which to-day is probably of just as much
prospective value for industrial purposes as it was
about five and a half years ago.
This time we have endeavored, within the space at
our disposal, to tell shareholders, investors and the
mar.y others who are interested in mining, not only
in the State but in Australia and beyond its borders,
what was done at Kalgo rlie in 1908, a year which
it is believ.d did more to cement and consolidate faith
in the future, not only of the Golden Mile, but of the
goldfields of Western Australia as a whole ; and what
may be said to be equally important the baser metal
propositions—copper, tin, iron, lead, and antimony —
which are located in various districts within the
metalliferous zones of this territory. If the matter,
plans of underground workings at the Kalgoorlie mines,
and other data which the Journal, through the courtesy
of the managers at the mines and the executive of
the Chamber of Mines of W.A., has obtained serves
to emphasize the object aimed at, then something will
have been accomplished towards assisting industry
in this country.
The Government of Western Australia, the Depart-
ment of Mines in particular, has in past years been
and is still a great factor in aiding and encouraging
the pioneer, the prospector and the small mineowner,
and we would not be giving credit where it is due if
some mention was not made of the part played by
the State, and particularly by the Minister for Mines,
and his executive officers—the Secretary for Mines
(Mr. H. S. King), the State Mining Engineer (Mr. A.
Montgomery, M.A., F.G.S.), the Government Geologist
(Mr. A. Gibb Maitland, F.G.S.) —who are the respon-
sible permanent officials under the Minister, the Hon.
H. Gregory, M.L.A., who, as an administrator, is
easily first among the men who have been entrusted
with the portfolio of Minister for Mines, and besides
his practical and commonsense knowledge, gained by
experience in his constituency at Menzies, on the
North Coolgardie Goldfield, has enabled him to steer
the middle course as between the conflicting interests
of the mineowner and the mineworker in asking the
Legislature to enact laws or to amend existing ones.
Mr. Gregory, in the discharge of his duty as one of
the responsible advisers of the Crown, has displayed
in the political arena greater strength of will and
tenacity of purpose than many stronger men —it is
difficult to draw the line in this matter, as between
administrator and politician, when the State plays
such a big part in the development of the mining
industry.
When one takes a glance at the history of the
year’s work, at Kalgoorlie and at several of the other
camps, the impression left is one of confidence in the
future, provided the same self-reliance on the part of
the operators of the mines and those who direct the
mining policy, either in London or Australia, is forth
coming and we see not the slightest reason for thinking
anything to the contrary. West Australia in the past
has produced gold to the value of over 85 millions
sterling. Why should she not in the next decade
repeat that history ? The opening up of the North-
West by giving transport facilities from Port Hedland
to Marble Bar, the extension of railways on the Mur-
chison fields, in different directions from the trunk line,
the development of the Phillips River field, for copper
and gold, the probable reopening of the Northamp-
ton lead mines, the great possibilities for working
immense iron deposits in the North-West and the far
North, in the event of further coal measures being
found, and the advance of metallurgical knowledge —
discovery of new processes to cheapen the cost of
treatment and to win from refractory ores the metal
contents —may all be accepted as factors in support
of the query put in the preceding sentence.
There is evidence from many sources which goes
to warrant the conclusion that 1908 has been a fore-
runner for 1909 as a progressive and prosperous year
in West Australian mining.

The Outlook.
Western Australia can look with pride on the
wonderful advance made by its great gold industry
during the past year. It is, of course, at Kalgoorlie
where the big stride forward has been made, but on
many other fields there has been an improvement
that few were prepared for, and the extent and im-
portance of which has not yet been fully realised.
To-day the intrinsic value of most of the established
mines stands higher and in some cases much higher
than it did twelve months ago. Several properties
which were silent at the beginning of that period are
no longer inarticulate, and encouraging reports of
activity are coming in from all quarters. An out-
standing feature of the past year’s development
has been the opening up of big payable ore bodies
on the southern fringe of the “ Golden Mile,” the ex-
istence of which was not known previously. Something
like £40,000 worth of bullion has already been extracted
above the 90ft. level from a portion of the lode in the
Chaffers lease, and although developments are a bit
on the poor side at 200 ft. there is no reason to suppose
that values will not improve both in driving and in
depth. It is not an uncommon thing on Hannan’s
Belt to encounter poor zones now and then. The
Gt. Boulder Proprietary has had its share of them and
if the company had got the scared feeling and stopped
development when it met with the first one where
would this mine, with its vast ore reserves and splendid
prospects, be to-day ? Poor zones are expected in
the Kalgoorlie mines, and when they are met with
the managements make the best of them and go on
sinking for better ore.
Dealing with the position of the individual mines at
Kalgoorlie and elsewhere it may be stated that taking
the January operations as a guide the current
year gives promise of going one better than 1908 in the
matter of gold output, dividend distributions and all
round prosperity. The Gt. Boulder Proprietary’s
developments are still the deepest, and for that reason
perhaps the most important, but average values are
being maintained in deep ground at several other
of our leading mines. The Ivanhoe Gold Corporation’s
development work has demonstrated that the main
ore chute —the East Lode—more than maintains its
size and value at the deepest level yet reached
(1,820 ft.). The last issued yearly report of the
Golden Horseshoe Estates Co., Ltd., shows that mine
to be on an exceptionally sound footing and to have
fully borne out the management’s expectations. The
Kalgurli G.M., Ltd., has put on weight intrinsically
by consistent good discoveries in the lower levels.
The Gt. Boulder Perseverance G.M. Co., Ltd., has
proved, by opening up a splendid run of ore on what
is known as the west lode, that it is not the dying
proposition pessimists have been freely asserting for
the past year or two. The Lake View Consols, Ltd.,
which has had the same or worse things said about its
historical mine, has caused the bears to be careful
through the discovery in the latter half of the year
of some good patches of ore at 1,900 ft. The Associated
Gold Mines, Ltd., and the South Kalgurli G.M., Ltd.,
have, as a result of vigorous prospecting, shown a
general improvement in values and besides these
mines have added considerably to their tonnage of ore
reserves; while in the “ North Country ” —on the Mt.
Margaret Goldfield —the Sons of Gwalia, Ltd., and
the Gwalia South Co. supply two notable instances
of mines which have taken a decided turn for the better
during the period under review. In face of these
facts it would be rash, as the London Financial Times
pointed out in a recent issue, to say that other mines,
which until recently were prominent among the
dividend paying mines in the State but which are now
proving a bit disappointing to shareholders, must
come to an end within the next few years. It is for
the companies at work on these properties to follow
the lead of the Gt. Boulder, the Ivanhos, and other
big mines, and go on sinking. If this is done the
W.A. Mining Journal opines that, in nine cases out
of ten, successful results will follow and lead to more
confidence in the future of the industry. As time goes
on other goldfields will for a certainty be discovered,
and in the same ratio, as additions are made to the
established mines, so will the gold production increase
and also the number of those who depend upon it
either directly or indirectly for a living.
It must be remembered, however, that mines do
not get richer in depth ; they get poorer, and
because this or that mine has turned out a
lot of high grade ore it does not follow
that it is going to do so for ever. It only sig-
nifies that so much rich stuff has been extracted to
date, and the more that is taken out the less there
remains. The moral to be drawn from this is that
the future of the industry lies in the successful exploita-
tion of low grade mines. The proportion of the gold
distributed in dividends would in the case of this
class of mine be small compared with what is paid
away at present, but on the other hand it would mean
the bringing within the payable limit large deposits
which fall just short of the payable limit at present ;
and, what is of more importance still to the country,
it would mean a big increase in the number of men
engaged in mining. A further reduction in costs
would bring about the desired end and that is probably
how it will be reached. One cannot tell in what shape
or form the reductions of a year ahead will be achieved,
but it may be safely assumed that they will be brought
about without injuring the worker in any way

GOLDEN HORSESHOE ESTATES, LTD.
The Golden Horseshoe, which is the property of
Golden Horseshoe Estates Co., Ltd., was the premier
mine of the year as a gold producer —milled 274,894
tons for 145,470 fine oz. and worth £620,527.
Just about a year ago it was recorded in the Journal :
“ There are few mines, if any, in Australasia that
exceed the Golden Horseshoe for richness and aggregate
output of the precious metal. Although the leases
owned by the company comprise 109 acres it is the
original lease of 24 acres (No. 35iE) from which
practically all the company’s wealth has been won.
As a mine, taking one consideration with another, the
Golden Horseshoe has probably not been exceeded by
any other in Australasia. To-day it is the largest
monthly producer of gold in Western Australia ”
The position is the same in this year of grace, with
these additional figures :
1908 (from inception to end of that year), 1,689,065
tons, bullion yield worth £6,856,180.
The main shaft was sunk to a total depth of 1,699 ft.
at the end of December last, and the management
opened out at 1,650 ft. The depths of the other shafts
of the company at the time stated were :
No. 2 shaft 632 feet.
No. 3 shaft (Ivanhoe South Extend-
ed lease) feet.
In the No. 2 shaft it was opened out at 600 ft., while
in the No. 3 the management opened out at 2,000 ft.
and drove to the boundary of the original lease, after
which the work was continued with the results which
are stated below. The most important developments
during the year were at the 2,000 ft. level of the No. 3
shaft when crosscutting under the main workings :
At 500 ft. north and 580 ft. west of main shaft a
lode was cut one foot wide assaying lodwt.
At a further distance of 70ft. north and 50ft.
west the lode was cut sft. wide and assaying
I3dwt. After crosscutting a further 205 ft.
north and 113 ft. west pay ore was encountered
for a width of 3ft. of an assay value of i3dwt.
At a point 169 ft. west the ore was cut again
4ft. wide and assaying sdwt. (The sectional
plan shows the position of the lodes in section
No. 4.)
There can be no question about the importance of
these four discoveries, for they add considerably to
the prospective value of the mine.
The ore reserves as computed to December 31 last
are :
Lode. Tons of Average Contents
2,2401 b. Value, dwt. (fine gold)
No. 1 Lode 1 3. 1 79 7.91 5,210.12

It should be noted that Mr. J. W. Sutherland, the
general manager, has been conservative in the above
estimate as no ore in the mine has been taken into
account below the 1,650 ft. level. During the year
stoping was as previously confined to the main workings
on the original lease.
On the surface several important additions to the
power and process plant have been made, and at the
time of installation were fully described in the weekly
issue of the W.A. Mining, Building and Rnginkfr-
ing Journal. Summarised they were as follow :
One 1,000 H.P. Ingersoll Rand air compressor.
An additional duplex Edwards roasting furnace
for concentrates.
One 500 K.W. turbo-generator, transformer,
switchboards, motors, superheaters, also con-
densers and pump for compressor and turbine.
A new change room with large plunge bath, sur-
gery and ambulance room were also built.
During the year there was, however, practically no
alteration made in the method of treating the ore.
In the New Year the managemnt began the installation
of 15 additional Wilfley tables in order that there may
be less pyritic matter in the pulp for slime treatment.
OUTPUT. 1908: Tons treated, 274,894; 145,470
oz.; value,
GREAT BOULDER PROPRIETARY.
The Gt. Boulder Lode is the backbone of the Kal-
goorlie mines. This is on the property of the Gt.
Boulder Proprietary Mines, Ltd., situated at Kal-
goorlie, in the East Coolgardie Goldfield, consisting of
five leases with a total area of 85 acres. The main
workings of this mine are on lease 16E (24 acres),
where are located the main shaft and the Edwards
shaft. Both are sunk on the main lode and connected
at the 1,200 ft. level for ventilation purposes. The
drive at this level also extends to the northern lease
(102 E) where is sunk the Hamilton shaft, to a depth
of 1,872 ft. —this portion of the property is prac-
tically an independent mine save for connection which
has been made for ventilation purposes, and it is
proposed to continue the 1,900 ft. level through the
same way as has been done at 1,200 ft. The plan which
accompanies this description of Western Australia’s
deepest and most methodically opened up mine shows
the:,ore in reserve as blocked out below the 1,200 ft.
level in each of the leases previously mentioned. It is
significant that the year 1908 recorded what was the
most important increment to the mine, when at
2,200 ft. the main lode was proved to extend from
the Main shaft at that depth in a southerly direction
for a distance of 1,020 ft. and averaged for the full
length ioz. I3dwt. gold per ton. Work below this
level was in progress at the end of the year from both
the Main shaft and the Edwards shaft and as far as
blocked out in each working there is payable ore.
The plan shows the ground still to be proved between
the two points indicated.
Geologically speaking the ore of the Gt. Boulder is
of a “ greyish color and has generally a schistose
structure but at the deep levels becomes more massive,
where it contains about 75 per cent, silica, 7 per cent,
carbonate of lime, 5 per cent, magnesia, 3 per cent,
carbonate of iron, 2 per cent, alumina, and 6 per cent,
iron pyrites.” The ore is hard and tough and con-
sequently its extraction and crushing is slow and
costly.
According to the present trend of the Gt. Boulder lode
the management expect that the Edwards shaft will
virtually become the main ore way from the deep
workings to the surface. With that object in view
the surface equipment has been supplemented with
three rock breakers, one of which is a Hadfield of large
size into which will be dumped three tons of ore at a
time after it has passed over a grizzley. This breaker
will reduce the ore to about 5-inch cubes and from it
the stuff is discharged into two more grizzlies. The
coarse material, when it has passed the grizzley, falls
into two ore breakers, which reduce it to 2-inch cubes,
and from these crackers it is taken on a conveyor
belt to the storage bins at the mill. The Edwards
shaft in addition is equipped with self-dumping’skips.
Last year a No. 8 Krupp ball mill, with conveyor and
ore bin, was erected ; also a new Edwards duplex
furnace, capable of roasting 100 tons per day. The
shed has been extended to cover this furnace, which
is equipped with the usual connecting conveyors, etc.
The spitzkasten has also been extended to deal with the
extra ore tonnage, which will mean that the plant will
deal with 16,000 long tons per month
A feature of the surface work during the year was
the installation of an electrical signalling apparatus,
which has been installed at the Main and the Edwards
shafts, and it is satisfactory to find this improved
method of communication between the surface and
the workings is answering well. It may be noted that
the installation was a costly one, owing to the necessity
of providing extra well insulated cables to counteract
the effects of water corrosion. The management in
1908 commenced work in connection with equipping
the Edwards shaft with the new vertical winding engine
which was made in a Victorian engineering works for
the company. This is a twin tandem compound
engine, capable of hoisting two tons of ore as a load
from a depth of 4,000 ft. This machinery is enclosed
by a lofty engine shed, which is fitted with a 10-ton
travelling crane. In addition there is installed a
condenser, with cooling tower, etc., and two large size
Babcock and Wilcox boilers. A breakage in the main
shaft winding engine caused a stoppage of six weeks,
during which time the ore for the supply of the mill
had to be lifted by the auxiliary engine and a temporary
hoist. This stoppage to a certain extent dislocated
the usual work below ground and prevented progress
with the development work in the deep levels.
On the northern lease in 1908 the first ore was
stoped in November and December in consequence of
the breakage to the main winding engine, but Mr.
Hamilton stated that the Company had no intention
to continue it from those workings, as it was only done
on account of emergency. The ore in this mine, as
it may be called, is therefore practically intact. The
plan demonstrates this. The Gt. Boulder No. 1 Co.,
Ltd., which is practically an offshoot of the parent
mine and also managed and worked in conjunction
with it did little work on their Kalgoorlie lease during
the year except tributing. This lease, which is 24
acres (50K), adjoins the Gt. Boulder’s northern lease
on the west and was formerly known as the Gt. Boulder
Extended. A lode was traced into the property by
borehole at 1,385 ft. depth and is being proved by the
Gt. Boulder Prop. Co., from its northern lease under
agreement. Portions of the No. 1 have from time to
time been let on tribute with advantageous results to
the tribute parties and the Company, and during the
year under review there were several parties (5) at
work, the royalty from whom paid for all supervision,
etc. A 10-stamp mill, along with a cyanide plant,
are in work on the lease for public crushing, etc. In
1907 the Gt. Boulder No. 1 Company acquired the
St. George and New Chum leases at Mt. Magnet, on
the Murchison, and after a considerable amount of
development work had been done a crushing plant
was erected thereon and was in full work last year.

Hamilton shaft

feet.
The St. George shaft should now be at 200 ft., and
the mine where worked to 100 ft. averages gdwt.
There was a difficulty for a little while in the treatment
of the ore on account of the kaolin affecting the sliming,
but this has been overcome. The strange fact in
connection with this was that more gold was contained
in the kaolin. There is every likelihood that the
current year will see the expectations of the manage-
ment more than realised in connection with this
enterprise of the Gt. Boulder No. 1 on the Murchison
The plan, as alieady stated, shows the amount of
work that has been done to the end of the year, and
gives the values of the ore at the different levels below
1,200 ft. Mr. Hamilton, the general manager, stated,
after reference to the 2,200 ft. rich values of 33dwt.,
that at the next level (2,350 ft.) the ore will be reduced
in value as driven on southwards, as at the time of
writing the face in that direction was of considerably
less value—the level so far has averaged about lojdwt.
—but he is hopeful that better values will be met with
as the drive is continued at the level. At the close
of the year the following were the three deepest
points in the Gt. Boulder mine :
OUTPUT, 1908: Tons treated. 185,280; 154,81502
gold, value £579> 2 73-
ASSOCIATED GOLD MINES OF W.A., LTD.
This mine, like the Lake View Consols, has made
history in gold mining in Western Australia. It is
located to the north of the bonanza mentioned and is
in good company with such neighbors as the Gt.
Boulder Perseverance, the Kalgurli, and the Oroya
Brownhill (Oroya lease), and consists of the following :
Australia North 71 E (18 acres), Australia East 72E
(18 acres), Australia 38E (18 acres), and Adelaide
101 E (24 acres). The total area held by the Associated
Gold Mines of W.A., Ltd., is therefore 52 acres.
“ The ore is of a greyish color, schistose in structure
as a rule, of a felsitic character, carrying most of the
minerals common to Hannan’s Belt. An analysis of
an average sample of the sulphide ore extracted gave
the following :
Iron bisulphide 11.45 Ferric oxide . 4.65
Alumina 2.40 Magnesia 5.51
Calcium oxide . 6.70 Insoluble.... 65.10
Alkalies, water,
etc 4.19 100.00
ORE REDUCTION : In milling the ore it is broken
by Gate’s breakers, crushed in ball mills, roasted in
Merton furnaces, fine ground with mercury in Forwood-
Down pans, agitated with cyanide solution, and finally
filterpressed. The gold solutions are precipitated on
zinc in the ordinary way. The gold is thus recovered
partly by amalgamation and partly by cyanidation.
When received from underground in trucks the ore is
taken to and dumped into the hoppers of two No. 5
Gate’s breakers, the broken ore being collected in rough
ore bins, the capacity of each 180 tons, of which 100 tons
is live ore. The breakers are usually in operation 17
hours per day, during which time 350 tons are broken.
Each breaker when in work requires 35 h.p., and when
not crushing 12.5 h.p. The heads are of steel, the
concaves are of hard white hematite iron, the total
cost of wearing parts at the time this official report
was given being 0.93 d. per ton broken. A rope
geraring from the mill engine main countershaft drives
the crushers which are thrown in and out of action
by a friction clutch gear on the umbrella type.
“ The broken ore is removed from the bins through
shoots, and fed, by means of two Challenge feeders,
on to two 14m. inclined belt conveyors, set at 23 deg.
to the horizontal, and delivering through shoots into
four 80-ton ball mill bins. Mr. G. M. Roberts, the
general manager, stated that the belts were usually
operated 12 hours per day ; each is 78ft. 3m. between
centres, is driven at 219 ft. per minute, and requires
2.8 h.p. when loaded, and 1.5 h.p. when empty.”
That describes the rock breaking.
MILLING : At the mill the ore is delivered from
the ball mill bins through shoots to 10 bumper feeders
of the usual type, which are used to feed 12 Krupp
No. 5 ball mills, each feeder tray is 6ft. 6in. long,
2ft. wide at the top and ift. 3m. at the bottom, is set
at an inclination of 12 deg. to the horizontal, and is
given 41 2in. strokes per minute. The mills are driven
at 25 r.p.m., each requires 16.8 h.p. and has a capacity
of 40 tons per day, with 30 x 30 screens of agate steel
wire of 30 i.s.w.g. The horsepower is ascertained by
differences on indicator cards between load and no
load, and therefore does not include engine friction
and power absorbed by line shafting, etc. Each mill
has a load of 1 long ton of Krupp’s pressed steel balls,
the consumption of which averages 0.251 b., and costs
1.843 d. per ton milled, the balls costing at the time
this report was given £26 per ton on the mine. To
keep the weight approximately constant 1 sm. ball
is fed into each mill per day, the liners, hunch-plates
and scoops are of Krupp steel, a set lasting five months.
The hunch plates cost £1 12s. each, the perforated
scoop plat s£3 17s. each. A set of these consists of
40 hunch plates and 10 scoops. The wear and tear
of liners, hunch and scoop plates, cost 4-64 d. per ton
milled. The consumption of bolts cost 0.6 id., that of
the scoops and screening o.sgid. per ton milled. The
ball mills are belt-driven from the main line shaft.
“ The milled ore falls from the mills through shoots
to 4 Krupp’s loin, diameter and Sin. pitch, spiral,
screw conveyors, making 27.5 r.p.m., and delivering
to four belt and bucket elevators, travelling at a speed
of 259 ft. per minute, each of height 48ft. pin. between
centres, and consisting of a loin, balata belt, with
52 buckets each loin, by bin. by sm. These elevators
deliver the milled ore to two milled-ore bins, each
holding 175 tons. Dust from the ball mills and from
the elevators is exhausted through zig-zag pipes by
means of a Sturtevant fan, and delivered to a dust
house 100 ft. long, 14ft. wide and 14ft. high to the eaves,
having a hopper bottom the sides of which slope to a
central longitudinal line (at an angle of 32 deg. to the
horizontal) where there are shoots for emptying the
dust into trucks.
With regard to ROASTING at the Associated, it
is probable that the description about to be given
-will be full of interest. Mr. Roberts in his official
statement puts it thus : From each of the milled-ore
bins the contents are removed by a screw conveyor
delivering to a double push conveyor, which is used
to keep full the feed shoots of the double row of Merton
furnaces. The overfeed from these push conveyors
is removed by another screw conveyor, and returned to
one of the belt and bucket elevators. The ore in the
feed shoots of the furnaces is delivered horizontally
on to the uppermost hearths by means of automatic
screw feeds driven by chain and sprocket wheels.
These furnaces are of the three-hearth type (each
hearth being supplied with four solid rabbles), having
also a finishing hearth with a water-cooled rabble
provided with stirrers. The hearths are all 6ft. 6in.
wide, the areas of them being respectively 130, 1391.
130, and sq. ft. Each furnace is capable of
roasting from 19 to 22 tons per day, which corresponds
to from 23.4 to 20.2 square feet per ton roasted per
day, and requires 2 h.p. About 60 gallons of water
are passed through each water-cooled rabble per hour,
being raised through a temperature of 60 deg. F.,
on an average. The heated water is sent by a three
throw belt driven plunger pump to a cooling tower.
The fuel consumption amounts to 10 per cent, of the
weight of the ore milled The residual sulphur am-
ounts to 0.37 per cent, as sulphide, and 2.20 per cent,
as sulphate. The gaseous products from the furnaces
pass through steel uptakes to two main flues (of
internal dimensions 6ft. by 4ft. clear of the settled
dust), the end of each of which is a steel stack 7ft.
in diameter and 100 ft. high. Dust from the main flues
is discharged by being raked through a series of
openings, usually closed by drop doors, in one side of
each flue. The roasted ore is discharged from the
furnaces through shoots leading to two push conveyors,
which discharge into two Krupp chain and bucket
elevators. Each of these elevators is 34ft. 3m. high

between centres, is driven at a speed of 270 feet per
minute, and is made of fin, chain, to which are attached
32 buckets each loin, by Sin. by Sin. Dust from
these elevators is exhausted through cyclone settlers
by the Sturtevant fan, and settle in the same dust
house that received the raw ore dust exhausted from
the ball mills, the contents of which are removed
and sent to one of the belt and bucket elevators. The
fan which is used for exhausting the dust is 55m. in
diameter, makes 750 r.p.m., and requires 3 h.p.
FINE GRINDING and AMALGAMATION is
thus described : “ The two chain and bucket elevators
deliver the roasted ore, which is then at a temperature
of 200 deg. F., to two closed-in mixers, sft. in diameter,
and 2ft. bin. deep, where it is formed into a pulp by the
addition of ‘ plant water ’ of cyanide strength equiva-
lent to 0.02 per cent. KCN. The temperature of the
pulp formed is about 94 deg. F. To correct the effect
of the presence of small amounts of alkaline sulphides
and thiosulphates in the roasted ore, lead acetate, in
amount from 0.7 to 1.30 Z. per ton, is added to the
pulp in the mixers. The pulp is equally distributed
among twenty sft. diameter pans, of the ordinary type
used on the fields, by means of a system of launders,
the overflows from the mixers being 4ft. nin. above
those of the pans. The pans are set out in one row,
and are driven in fours from separate countershafts,
each driven from a main countershaft. Each pan
is thrown in and out of action by clutch gear. The
quantity of pulp, which has a consistency of 23 per
cent., of solid matter, fed into each pan, amounts to
loolb. per minute, so that the solution which passes
through the pan per minute amounts to yf gallon.
Each pan is driven at 47 r.p.m. and requires 5.2 h.p.
The pan shoes and dies, which are made on the mine,
are of hard white hematite, and are worth 18s. per cwt.
A set lasts four months. Compensating rings are used
to keep the grinding pressure approximately constant.
About 3olb. of mercury is fed into each pan per month,
the loss amounting to 0.32902., and costing 0.q86d.
per ton milled. The amalgam produced contains 32
per cent, of bullion.
“The ‘SLIMED ’ PRODUCT from the pans is
sent to a large settler 48ft. wide and 24ft. long, con-
sisting |of 32 pyramidical spitzkasten, each 6ft. by
6ft. and 7ft. deep, and having the sides vertical for
ift. then sloping to the apex. The pulp is distributed
carefully over the full width of the settler, and the
clear solution overflows also over the full width. The
sludge, which is thickened, on an average to about
46 per cent, of dry slime, is drained off through i-|in.
c.i. plug cocks. The overflowing solution is pumped
back to two overhead storage tanks by two centrifugal
pumps (two other similar pumps being in reserve),
and ample provision is made for the thorough aeration
of the solution.
AGITATION BY CYANIDE : “The sludge,
collected by the settler, is sent to a row of 12 agitation
vats, each 17ft. sm. in diameter and sft. sm. deep
and holding 51.13 tons of pulp containing 25.52 tons
of dry slime. Each vat is provided with a mechanical
agitator (which can be raised or lowered by a windlass),
driven by worm gearing, rotated at 8 r.p.m. and
requiring 2.8 h.p. The agitator is thrown in and out
of action by a friction clutch gear. It takes two hours
to fill a vat, the charge being subsequently agitated for
13 hours, during which time the strength of the
solution drops from 0.044 P er cent. KCN to 0.034
per cent. KCN. Sodium cyanide is used in the plant,
its total consumption averaging i|lb. per ton. The
contents of each vat are discharged into a pump sump
by lifting a plug, the contents of the sump being
prevented from settling by means of a jet of air.
FILTER PRESSING: The pulp is pumped into
the filter presses from the sump by means of a 3-throw
belt-driven geared Pearn pump, having 10-inch
diameter plungers and a 12-inch stroke, the crank
shaft making 26 r.p.m. There are seven Dehne filter-
presses of the angle lever closing type, each having
900 sq. ft. of filtering area, making 3-inch cakes, and
holding 4.2 tons of dry slime. The filling of a press
takes 10 min. and is effecetd at a maximum pressure
of 651 b. The subsequent washing is effected at 751 b.
pressure. The first wash takes 10 minutes, the
effluent, mixing with the charge solution, being sent
to the precipitation department. The second washings
of the charges take 15 minutes each, the effluents being
used for subsequent first washings. The cakes are
given a water wash for three minutes, and are finally
air-dried for five minutes with air at qolb. pressure,

the residual moisture amounting to 20 per cent. Dis-
charging and closing a press takes 30 minutes. The
washing is effected by a 3-throw belt-driven, double
acting, geared Pearn pump, having gin. plungers and
a loin, stroke, the crank shaft making 35 r.p.m. The
gold solutions are pumped to two overhead storage
vats by a 3-throw belt-driven, geared pump, with Bin.
diameter plungers and a gin. stroke, the crank shaft
making 43 r.p.m. All pump work is controlled by
electric signals from the filterpress floor. Filter cloth
costs 2.886 d, per ton milled.
THE PRECIPITATION work is done thus; “ The
gold solution from the storage vats gravitates through
two Dehne clarifying presses, used alternately, to a
collecting tank at the head of the extractor boxes.
Filterpress cocks are dispensed with. The extractor
boxes, seven in number, have a total zinc capacity of
igo cubic ft., and precipitate about 600 tons of solution
per day, the gold value of the head solution averaging
g 6 grains, and that of the tail solution 5 grains per ton.
An eduction pipe is fitted to each extractor box
delivery pipe to introduce air into the solution, which,
by a small cyanide drip at the head of the box, is
raised to a strength of 0.046 per cent, KCN. The
zinc consumed costs 1.333 d. per ton milled. The spent
solution is elevated to either of the tanks over the
pans or to those over the presses as required, by means
of a Forwood-Down 3-throw belt-driven geared pump,
with gin. plungers and an iBin. stroke, driven at
35 r.p.m.
“ When CLEANING UP the precipitate, which is
removed from the extractor boxes in buckets, is
treated in an acid tank, with a conical bottom, above
which is a cylindrical shell surmounted by an ordinary
conical hood through the pipe of which the acid fumes
escape. The shell is provided with an opening through
which the precipitate and acid are introduced. The
opening can be closed by a slide door, and the tank
locked up when necessary. The contents of the tank
upon the conclusion of the treatment, are discharged
after dilution, into a monteju, which is used to charge
a Dehne lead lined cleaning up chamber press, having
18 leaves, 14m. square, and forming lin. cakes. The
acid-treated precipitate is roasted in two c.i. muffles,
after which it is fluxed with 40 per cent, of borax
and 20 per cent, of sand, and run down in two tilting
furnaces. Two circular melting furnaces are used to
smelt the bullion for running into bars. A circular
retort is used for the pan amalgam.
The A.Z. Clark’s patented zinc precipitate REFIN-
ING PROCESS was (at the time this description of
the method was written) being tried in this department,
a special fusion furnace having been built for the
purpose. In brief this is the way it is done : “ The
moist slime, after removal from the extractor boxes,
is thoroughly moistened with a solution of nitre cake
dissolved in sulphuric acid, not more than one part
sulphuric acid being added to each five parts by weight
of slime. The mass is heated in a w 7 hite cast-iron tray
at a low red temperature, when, owing to the evapora-
tion of moisture, the sulphuric acid condenses and
attacks the metals. The presence of the salt cake
enables this to be effected, without fear of loss of gold
by dusting, at a higher temperature than could be
carried on with sulphuric acid alone. The mass
beccmes caked as the water is driven off, and the first
stage of the fusion is completed, when the cold mass
is of a reddish or brownish color, without black patches
indicating the destruction of cyanide compounds,
sulphides and reducing compounds, and the conversion
of silver and base metals into sulphates. In the
second stage, nitre cake is added in instalments after
all sulphuric acid fumes have been expelled (the
amount being determined by preliminary experiments),
and continuing the heating, at dull redness, till the gold
collects in spongy patches in the mass, and the color
of the mass, when cooled upon an iron rod, is greenish
white. The action is then completed and the fused
mass is poured into an iron tray and broken into lumps.
These are placed in the upper compartments of a
washing box—built like a zinc extractor box —and hot
water (which removes the silver sulphate and prac-
tically all the basic material) is passed through the box.
The silver can be precipitated from the issuing solution
by means of iron or copper in a second box.“ To
avoid slag production, the sponge gold, freed from
sulphate of silver, is amalgamated with mercury in a
suitable stoneware vessel to avoid contact with iron
or other metals, which would reduce small amounts of
impurities. The amalgam is retorted and the retorted
gold melted in clay pots.
DISPOSAL OF RESIDUES: “The filter press
residues are discharged on to a ibin. horizontal belt
conveyor, beneath the presses, 130 ft. between centres,
requiring 3.5 h.p. when loaded and 2.5 h.p. when
emptied. This belt discharges on to a second horizontal
belt, iBin. wide, 146 ft. gin. between centres and
requiring 4.5 h.p. when loaded and 3 h.p. when running
empty. This second belt discharges on to an iBin.
elevating belt at an angle of 12 deg. to the horizontal,
175 ft. long between centres, and requiring 6.5 h.p.
when loaded and 4.5 h.p. when unloaded. The elevat-
ing belt discharges into trucks from which the residues
are discharged on to the dump by hand.”
In igoB the mill was extended by the addition of
two Krupp ball mills, a duplex Edwards roasting fur-
nace and other details which enabled the company to
make an increase in the output of ore from the mine
to 12,000 tons monthly. The only other alteration
to the plant on the surface worthy of note was the
adaption of five of the old agitators to the “ A.Z.”
type, it having been found that the more energetic
agitation produced by this idea resulted in a quicker
and better extraction of the gold contents.
The POWER PLANT at the beginning of the current
year was being improved by the addition of a central
surface condensing plant by Thompson and Co.,
Castlemaine, Vic., which is designed to economically
deal with 50,0001 b. of steam per hour.
THE MINE.
Although the Associated was steadily developed in
the year under review in a satisfactory way there was
not any strike made in the mine of special importance.
The depth of the main shaft at the close of the year
was i,Bs7£ft. and the bottom (or No. 17) level was-;at
i'B2oft., or 500 ft. below sea level, where the company
is now driving for the Australia East lode, which it
may be remarked is practically the principal ore channel
of this great mine. With regard to the work of the
year it is probable that the ore found at No. 11 shaft
(towards the Kalgurli boundary) may be regarded as
of most interest. Work there to date has proved a
body of average grade ore to a depth of 200 ft., in
length* 170 ft., and width 15ft. ; driving at the time
of this report was still in progress. This discovery
has not yet been definitely identified with any
known body, but a connection may, after further
exploratory work, be proved with the main chute of
the Australia East lode, now being worked from the
Nos. Bto 16 levels. A lens of ore at the No. 15 level,
of comparative recent discovery and known as the
west lode, is being worked about 60ft. from the Gt.
Boulder Perseverance boundary, almost due west of
the Associated main shaft. The drive shows two
lengths of ore, respectively about 100 ft. and 80ft. in
length, with, an apparent^blank of 70ft. between, and
the management considered that it was probable that
stripping would show them to be one continuous chute
—the average width was about 16ft.
As showing the amount of underground work done
in the Associated it lis observed that \in all' about
ig miles of development has been done upon the
property.
ORE RESERVES: The ore in reserve in the
Associated upon a conservative estimate was practically
the same as that given in the last annual report (which
showed an increase of 100,000 tons) :
430,414 tons, average value 10.21 dwt. ; 2ig,7ggoz.

IVANHOE GOLD CORPORATION, LTD.
This mine is second to the Gt. Boulder when one
takes into consideration the mainstays of the Golden
Mile. It is the property of the Ivanhoe Gold Cor-
poration, Ltd., located on lease 31E (24 acres), but the
total area owned by the company is 75 acres —the
Crescent Extended and the Crescent North, along
with a water lease, make up the balance of the area
stated. The rough sketch plan which accompanies
this, showing from the 1,200 ft. level downwards,
indicates what the East lode has done for this property.
At the 1,669 ft. level it has been driven on north and
south for a total distance of 1,205 ft. in pay values.
The year under review proved the East lode at 1,820 ft.,
where it was opened up for 103 ft. north and 109 ft.
south, and the average width was 44ft. and the average
gold contents on assay worked out at 465. 3d. per ton.
The whole of the driving done at the level stated was
in good payable ore, and none has gone to the mill
save that extracted in extending the workings men-
tioned. This is an asset which the company and its
general manager, Mr. R. B. Nicolson, have every
reason to be pleased over.
The Ivanhoe, owing to its position as a neighbor of
the Gt. Boulder and the Golden Horseshoe, in point
of output ranked as the third great mine of the State.
There are three principal lodes in this lease and each
have been worked to great depth —the East lode, the
New lode, and the Middle lode, but it is from the
first mentioned that the work in 1908 has further
proved the permanency of the mine. It is true that
the average gold contents of the ore extracted during
the half decade has diminished in value, but that
has been more than compensated for by the improved
methods of treatment and the efficiency and organisa-
tion of the underground work. While the 100-head
battery, the first of that power to run in the West,
has pounded away month in and month out at the
rate of 19,500 tons per month, yet it is satisfactory
to see recorded an increase in the tonnage of the ore
in reserve, the value of which exceeds two and a half
million sterling. The Ivanhoe ore contains more
silica than is found in most of the great mines of
Hannan’s Belt. The bulk of the gold is free, some
being combined with tellurium, while the refractory
ore may be put down at 15 per cent, of the whole.
It is harder in the deep levels, more slicious and gives
less free gold than in the shallow workings.
There was little alteration to the plant during the
year, as it did not require it, for, in addition to paying
the proprietors £240,000 a year (this has been done
for five consecutive years), revenue has all along
been sufficient to give the mine more than it wanted
in modern appliances and methods for the recovery of
gold. Two Wilfley concentrators, bringing the number
up to 33, were installed in the mill, and a few extra
settling vats were put in to catch the fine concentrates.
The management are so satisfied with the mill results
that it has been reported officially that no alterations
or additions for the current year were in view. It
may be added, however, that the practice pursued

at the Ivanhoe is ordinary battery work for the re-
covery of the bulk of the gold, and summed up in a
couple of sentences or so, the reduction process is ;
The ore on being lifted automatically from the mine
“is coarse-crushed by breakers, milled in a
stamper battery with amalgamation, and the
sands separated from it into concentrates,
coarse sands, fine sands and slimes. The
concentrates are roasted, fine ground, and
amalgamated, agitated with cyanide solution
and filter-pressed. The coarse sands are ground
finer in Wheeler pans; the resultant pulp
(separated into sands and slimes) is treated
with the main bulk of the sands and slimes
previously eliminated by ordinary cyanide and
bromo-cyanide treatment respectively.”
The Crescent leases, which were previously men-
tioned, were acquired as a dumping ground from the
Southern Development Co. for £5,000. In the event
of there being any indications on these leases there
would of course be no delay in active exploration work.
At the end of December last the main shaft, as
indicated on the plan, was sunk to a total depth of
2,126 ft. At 2,120 ft. preparations were being made to
open out a new level with the object of getting the
East lode at that depth.

LAKE VIEW CONSOLS, LTD.
THE 1,900 ft. AND THE I,Booft. DEVELOPMENTS.
The Lake View Consols mine—what a name to
conjure with ! —in December reported a remarkable
development in the deep levels. This set the quid
nuncs agog, while the men whose opinion is worth
having became hopeful that the mine would repeat
history. Be that as it may, there is not the slightest
doubt over this fact —the mine has several years of
useful work before it, and in the meantime it will
distribute regular dividends, although on a small scale
as compared to the profit made out of the bonanza
won from the mine in 1899 and 1900. The encouraging
outlook of 1909 may be attributed entirely to the
careful way in which the mine has been handled —
during the past seven years —by Messrs. Bewick,
Moreing and Co., the engineers and general managers
to the company ; and the policy inaugurated, at the
beginning of their control, has been steadily pursued
by the superintendents who preceded Mr. O. B. Ward,
who is the present representative of the firm —Messrs.
W. A. Prichard, H. A. Shipman, Bigelow, and J. A.
Agnew (now Messrs. Bewick, Moreing and Co.’s
general manager in W.A.). The directors in London,
it is true, have, with the large capital at their disposal,
practically turned the company into an organisation
for financing mining enterprises, etc., but the mine,
the origin of the wealth, is still there and we, as
Westralians, may be optimistic in standing by it, for
after all, the Lake View Consols, Ltd., is a company
which with the Gt. Boulder Proprietary and the
Golden Horseshoe Estates has done more to advertise
to the world the permanency of the gold mining
industry at Kalgoorlie. There are other mines which
to-day have eclipsed the record of the Lake View
Consols —such as the Ivanhoe, the Kalgurli, the Oroya
Brownhill, and the Gt. Fingall Consolidated —but the
company’s big asset is the location of the Lake View
Consols, along with the unexplored extent of ground
that remains within the boundaries of the original
leases —Lake View (32E) and Gt. Boulder East (25E),
an area of 48 acres. The Golden Link (2,326 E, 9 acres)
and the Gt. Boulder East Extended (2325 E, 15 acres)
which were purchased in 1906 from the Golden Links,
Ltd., for £lO,OOO, may possibly provide a surprise
packet similar to what came to the Chaffers share-
holders. There is a 75-head wet crushing mill, in
addition to which the Diehl process for gold recovery
is installed, and further a vacuum filter plant was
started in April, 1908, and gave handsome returns
when working on a large tonnage at a minimum of cost.
The power plant, which has been in operation for
many years, is capable of a little improvement, and
when revenue gained from mining profits will permit
no doubt no time will be lost in keeping it up to date.
THE MINE.
The plan which accompanies this report shows the
development work done at the 1,900 ft. level, also work
done on other lodes which have been further explored
and developed in 1908. At the level stated, at a
point 255 ft. west, a winze was started on November 23
which work at the end of December had reached a
depth of 44ft., and the average width of the ore exposed
in this working was 4ft. pin.—the average values from
oto 44ft. down was 695. per ton. At the I,Booft. level
the management opened up a third ore body on the
east side of the shaft. This was found by following
from the stope above, and at the eastern leg pay ore
was proved. This discovery practically means that
another ore body is in behind it. The management
this year started a rise up to this find in preparation
for stoping out this new block of ore. In this portion
of the property, on which over £200,000 has been
expended in prospecting and development work, from
the No, 7 level down to the No. 19 level, there has been
practically speaking no payable ore for the mill apart
from a few dabs here and there. The importance of
this strike in the deep ground of the mine, with high
values, should therefore be appreciated by shareholders
and investors.
On the surface the vacuum slimes plant, mentioned
above, was designed to treat the residues from the
big dump and the fine ground product from the mill.
When erected the plant handled between 3,000 and
4,000 tons monthly, but it has become so efficient that
the capacity late in the year was raised to 9,945 tons
and it is expected to be maintained at 10,000 tons, at
a working cost of about 2s. 6£d. per ton.
From the Golden Links leases (Eclipse and the
Golden Link) about 3,600 to 3,800 tons are treated
monthly at the L.V.C. mill, of an average approximate
value of 40s. per ton. The tributors on the Eclipse
lease cart their ore to the Lake View battery for treat-
ment. They had a length of about 50ft. at the time
of this report, in which values had improved, and it is
located on the eastern side of the North Kalgurli.
This was come on to by the party after they had done
a lot of dead work and good wages have resulted to
them for their perseverance. Several other parties
have been let ground and are engaged prospecting.
Returns from this mine by tribute parties were as
follow for the months stated :
Ore milled. Gold.
The once famous Lake View mine has of late again
come into prominence (Mr. Frank B. Powell says in
the Financial Times, London, series of articles on
“ Kalgoorlie’s Golden Mile,” published in January)
owing to a rich development in a winze below the
1,900 ft. level. It is a very noticeable fact that in
practically every mine in Kalgoorlie where the lodes
have been opened below the 1,700 ft. level a decided
improvement in values has been recorded. This im-
provement is very noticeable in the Lake View, for,
although one of the richest mines in Kalgoorlie down
to the 400 ft. level, below that point it has proved a
more or less low-grade proposition. Sufficient work
has not yet been done in any of the lower grade mines
below the 1,700 ft. level to demonstrate whether these
improved values are going to continue or otherwise,
but the improvement is very encouraging and holds
out a brighter prospect for developments in the deeper
levels, especially in those mines which have been rich
on the surface, for in these, more especially, there is
the probability of getting into a rich zone in the lode
again at any time. The Lake View Consols Co. is on
a sound footing financially, and at the present time is
making from £1,200 to £1,500 a month profit from the
retreatment of old tailings, of which it has about three
years’ supply. The Lake View Consols also treats the
Golden Link Co.’s ore, on which a clear profit of ss.
per ton is made. The mill is being kept running on
low-grade ore, from which small monthly profits are
made, but these profits could be considerably increased
in the event of the lower levels developing sufficient
high-grade ore to raise the head value of the ore milled
a further 2dwt. per ton. The latest information re-
garding the developments at the 1,900 ft. level is that
the winze 255 ft. west of main shaft is now down 28ft.,
the value in bottom over a width of 48 inches being
435. per ton. This winze has averaged over 100 s.
(excluding “ specimens ”) for the depth sunk. The
Secretary of the Company writes :—“ It is hoped that
the ore exposed is the cap of another lens, but the

HAINAULT GOLD MINE, LTD.
The Hainault Gold Mine, which is located on a lease
(3643 E) of 20 acres, was acquired from the Gold
Discovery Co., Ltd., at the time of the formation of
the company in Edinburgh in May, 1895, the con-
sideration being £50,000, payable £lO,OOO cash and
£40,000 in fully paid shares. The authorised capital
is £150,000 in 150,000 shares of £1 each, all of which
are issued fully paid. The capital was originally
£70,000, but subsequently in the year stated 40,000
shares were offered for public subscription, 30,000
being taken up ; in 1897 the capital was increased to
£lOO,OOO and 14,000 shares were offered to shareholders
at par, the issue being guaranteed. In May, 1900, the
capital was increased to £130,000, when 10,000 shares
were offered to shareholders at par, the issue being
guaranteed for a call of 5,000 at 255. In 1904 11,000
shares were issued to the public at par, and the
guarantors of the issue have since taken up the re-
maining reserved shares at par, under an option.
In August, 1906, the capital was increased to present
amount, 20,000 shares being offered to shareholders
at 28s. 6d. each. The payment of dividends was begun
in December, 1904, with a shilling distribution, and
similar amounts followed: June, 1905 ; October,
1905 ; March, 1906 ; June, 1906 ; October, 1906 ;
and January, 1907.
The reference as above to the capitalisation of this
company is made on accouut of the mine being a
low grade one and the management, to cope with the
demand for an increased output of ore in order that
the margin of profit might be maintained, was com-
pelled to call for additional working capital during
the dividend paying stage of the mine and subsequently
too. The property is now equipped on a basis which
it is confidently expected will endorse the policy laid
down by Mr. A. L. Hay’s predecessor in the control.
There has been a good deal of discussion, both in
and Western Australia, in regard to this
proposition. The outlook is now a good one.
At the end of last year the main shaft had reached
a depth of 1,014 ft. The levels opened up were as
follows ; at 130 ft., 200 ft., 300 ft., 400 ft., 500 ft., 650 ft.,
750 ft., 850 ft., and 950 ft. In the intermediate workings
over the 950 ft. level sulphide ore 12ft. wide of an
assay value of 7dwt. was reported to be standing at
the beginning of the New Year (1909). The manage-
ment during 1908 and up to the end of the year was
engaged in the extraction of ore from all the levels
previously mentioned and at date of the last computa-
tion of the ore in reserve there were approximately
100,000 tons valued at 28s. per ton in sight. The
Hainault lode approximately strikes N.W. and S.E.,
with a more or less easterly underlay. Prospecting is
in progress at the lower levels for the ore channel
coming north and at present being worked by the
South Kalgurli Co. to the east of Morty’s shaft. Ex-
ploration work is also in progress at the 500 ft. level
by means of a crosscut eastwards from the main shaft.
This crosscut, it is of interest to observe, follows on
the course of a diamond drill bore which recently
intersected some low grade ore. At the northern end
of the lease there is further exploration work in progress
which is being carried out from prospecting shafts to
pick up veins of ore which come in from the North
Kalgurli.
On the surface the equipment may be briefly des-
cribed :
Rough crushing and sorting plant at the shaft.
Mill of 40 stamps (each weighing 1,2501 b.).
6 grinding pans.
Concentrates and cyanide plant.
An Edwards roaster was in course of erection at
the time of this report.

OROYA BROWNHILL CO., LTD.
It is seldom in the world’s mining that a venture,
from one pipe of ore, in four years approximately, has
a yield of four millions sterling. This is practically
what the bonanza, known as the Iron Duke lode, gave to
the shareholders of the Oroya Brownhill Co., Ltd. This
company is by no means one of the past, for it has a
cash balance of over £200,000 —to either buy a new
mine, or to further exploit the 125 acres, in three blocks,
which it holds on Hannan’s Belt. A 50-stamp sulphide
mill which embraces what is known as the Diehl
process is at work. During 1906, probably the most
successful and economical year in the history of this
company, 128,180 tons were treated and produced
gold to the value of £630,318, or 98s. 46. per ton, at
a cost of 21s. 1 id. and a profit of 765. sd. per ton ; while
for 1907 133,395 tons yielded gold to the value of
£434,057 ; cost (excluding development) £130,077.
It was stated in one of Mr. G. P. Doolette’s addresses
to the shareholders of this successful company that
the Hannan’s Brownhill, the original 12 acres, was
like unto the “ widow’s cruse,” for the workings seemed
to be almost inexhaustible when submitted to system-
atic search for continuation of the runs of gold bearing
rock. The company has another asset, in addition
to the prospective value of its mines at Kalgoorlie,
in the 60,000 shares in the Oroya Black Range, Ltd.,
at Sandstone, which it promoted and financed into
one of the best of the mining companies at work beyond
Kalgoorlie.
It may be said parenthetically that the 0.8. H. in
its search for a new mine has left no stone unturned,
and, in view of the strength of its cash reserve, the
decision of the directors in looking further afield than
the State for another property is to an extent approved
of by those who have hitherto strenuously contended
for re-investment of profits in the opening up and
development of Westralian propositions as against the
acquirement of what are regarded as foreign mines.
Of course, the factor which has inclined them to this
view is the financial strength of the company and that
alone is the reason for this concession, or leaning
towards investment of capital in a foreign venture,
which, to make it successful, has to be financed
out of money made from gold won in this country.
The sketch plan which accompanies this reference
to the Oroya Brownhill shows the work done in the
Oroya South Block at the following levels : At 879 ft.,
1,096 ft., 1,295 ft., and 1,495 ft. At the 1,295 ft. and
the 1,495 ft. crosscuts were pushed out east to prospect
the Iron King lease at depth ; also a west crosscut at
1,495 ft. right across the Central and West Boulder
lease. This work was in progress at the time of writing.
It is of interest to observe that Messrs, Bewick,
Moreing and Co., the engineers and general managers,
have in addition to other exploratory work been
engaged in following up possible branches of the Iron
Duke lode. It is officially reported that a considerable
amount of work has been done on the Oroya North
Block with this object in view. It has taken the form
of prospecting in the fringes of the ore pipe for wings
of ore branching off the main ore body or any indep-
endent ore bodies that may exist adjacent thereto.
This exploratory work consisted of driving, crosscutting
and rising from an intermediate level at a point about
60ft. below the No. 6 level in the footwall of the ore
pipe, crosscutting east at the No. 7 level underneath
the ore body, and the extension to a total distance of
104 ft. of the east crosscut, at a point 121 ft. north of
the shaft at the No. 8 level. There was also an east
crosscut at the No. 9 level, starting at a point 237 ft.
north of the shaft. This work however did not prove
successful, the results placed on. record being of a
negative character —no wings of ore, or small but

rich ore bodies, were located. The history of this
famous ore pipe —which in the past had been prolific of
such rich returns and was practically a continuous
body of ore from the old Hannan’s Brownhill leases
on the north, through the Associated Northern Blocks
Co.’s mine (Iron Duke lease) and through the Oroya
North Block into the Associated G.M., Ltd., on the
south —has, as has been so frequently recorded in the
Journal, been one of many surprises. The record
shows that, continually, after the supposed limits of
the pay ore had been reached, prospecting in the winzes
of the original body has resulted in the discovery of
rich lenses of ore lying adjacent to the main ore pipe.
The engineers for the company consider that the most
recent work on the Oroya North Block however, as
stated previously, seems to indicate that the limits of
this body have been reached at this point. It may be
that further work followed by further discoveries may
upset all present theories and the many surprises of the
past be repeated.
Perseverance mine. What followed afterwards under
company control is a matter of history, but a brief
reference to it is of interest. The consideration given
by the present company to the then holders of the
property was £42,000, payable £6,000 in cash and
£36,000 in fully paid shares. After the formation of
the company the mining rights of the adjoining lease
of acres were purchased for £5OO. The authorised
capital is £200,000 in 200,000 shares of £1 each. All
the shares are issued and fully paid. The capital was
formerly £60,000 but £24,000 was privately offered for
subscription in August, 1895. In July, 1897, a further
increase to £BO,OOO was made, 15,000 shares being
issued to shareholders at 30s. each. In December,
1898, it was increased to £150,000, 16,000 shares being
offered to shareholders at 255. each. A further 7,000
shares were issued at £4 each in J uly of the subsequent
year ; 8,000 at £5 each early in 1900 ; 12,000 at £2 ss.
in February, 1901 ; and 18,000 at 225. 6d. in May,
1903. In June of 1903 the capital was increased to
the present amount, and the 50,000 new shares were
offered to shareholders at 225. 6d. each, this issue being
guaranteed. In April, 1900, a reduction plant was
started. A Riecken process plant, which was installed
upon certain terms and given a trial run, was taken
over by the company in February, 1901, and four
months later it was enlarged. In May, 1903, milling
was suspended to effect alterations to the plant, etc.
The treatment of the accumulated tailings was com-
pleted in June, 1904. The present general managers,
Messrs. Bewick, Moreing and Co., took charge of the
property and erected in June, 1905, a plant which
gave admirable results —it was certainly a model which
has been followed by other low grade mines. The new
plant was enlarged in 1907 by the addition of a further
ball mill and two furnaces. Dividends have been paid
as follows : 1905-6—2 s. per share on April 5, and 2s.
The company has a valuable asset in its big residue
dump for the treatment of which a Cassell’s treatment
plant capable of handling 15,000 tons of residues
monthly has been installed. When this plant is in full
work it is estimated by Messrs. Bewick, Moreing and
Co. that the total cost for the re-treatment of these
residues will not exceed 2s. 4d. per ton. It is but a
matter of calculation to see what a handsome profit
will be derived from this work. This estimated profit
should give the Company sufficient funds to further
develop its mine, besides adding to the already strong
reserve in sovereigns. In reference to the Oroya Black
Range, the shares of which are standing at about par,
the last official statement of the ore reserves gave an
estimated supply as equal to two years’ mill work
on present output, which it may be noted is yielding
about £4,000 profit per month over and above all mine
costs.
Mr. John Morgan, who is superintendent of the
Oroya Brownhill Co., Ltd., it may be noted, worked
in Wales and Cornwall in mines which his principal,
Mr. C. Algernon Moreing, was also employed upon,
but it is not known whether they were there at the
same time. This may be a coincidence, but it is a
singular one. The 0.8. H., with its large area of auri-
ferous ground, as has already been noted, still has an
outlook on which it is certain will return dividends, but
of course not on the marvellously rich scale of the
past, for who can tell what is beyond what the pick
head has broken down in the face of the working ?

SOUTH KALGURLI GOLD MINES, LTD.
The year has been an eventful one for this mine.
It is the property of the South Kalgurli G.M., Ltd.,.
which was registered on August 1, 1905, to acquire
the Gaelic and Gaelic Extended claims, area 14 acres.
As a matter of fact this block was created through an
overlap in the survey on the Gt. Boulder Perseverance
and to keep the twenty-four acre blocks of the Golden
Mile in conformity with one another the owners of
the Perseverance Syndicate decided to make it an
independent area for mining purposes. Mr. M’Phail
and his party were the originators of this and the
October 9, 1906 ; and is. May 7, 1907, 6d. November
11, 1907 ; and regular dividends were paid in 1908.
The financial position of this company in view of the
low grade character of the ore is certainly one to be
commended.
THE MINE
This mine in the course of development work at
deep levels showed a remarkable improvement at the
I,oooft. and 1,200 ft. levels. At the first mentioned
level the No. 2 north and the No. 3 south drives were
put in on what is presumed to be the El Oro lode,
about 94ft. east of Morty’s shaft —which is the main
lift of the mine—for distances of 169 ft. and 197 ft.
respectively. Going south no values of importance
were located, but the No. 2 north drive encountered
high grade ore at about 67ft. north of the crosscut.
From that point to the present face (December 31,
1908) at 169 ft. the ore exposed has averaged over
lodwt. per ton, values as high as 3fidwt. being obtained.
On the Morty lode at the I,oooft. level the main
south drive was started off the west crosscut at 105 ft.
from Morty’s shaft. The ore exposed at this point, by
driving and stripping, extends to about 140 ft. south
of the crosscut and has an average of over 7dwt. for
15ft. wide.
At the 1,200 ft. level work has consisted of the ex-
tension of the west crosscut from the main shaft to
the west boundary of the lease, for a total distance of
301 ft. The Morty lode was cut at 745 ft., or 167 ft.

west of Morty shaft. At this point the ore proved to
have a width of 31ft., carrying an average of over
6dwt. gold per ton.
The superintendent of this mine is Mr. C. Hope
Nicolson, who, as has been stated in the W.A. Mining,
Building and Engineering Journal, has circum-
scribed space on the surface owing to the accumulation
of the residues dumps. The plant will in the ensuing
year have added to it two Merton’s furnaces (44ft.),
with a capacity of 30 to 35 tons per day, making 10
SOUTH KALCURLI
furnaces in all—capacity 300 to 350 tons per day.
Also a No. 8 Krupp mill, making 3 No. 8 and the rest
of the crushing power in No. 5> capacity 100 to 120
tons per day each for No. 8 and the No. 5 will do
about 40 tons each per day. A new winding engine
was installed during the last quarter of the year to
lift from 3,000 ft. The power plant had one Babcock
boiler added, making six.

Situated as it is in the heart of the Golden Mile,
the Gt. Boulder Perseverance from time to time has
probably evoked as much interest from the mining
investors’ point of view as any one of the big mines
of Western Australia. In area it is 24 acres, the lease
being numbered on the register as 66E. The main
shaft at the close of the year was approximately sunk
to a depth of 1,930 ft. At 1,900 ft. the management put
out a crosscut east and west to intersect the lode.
The former has been extended 71ft. bin. and the
last named crosscut was out 83ft. bin. from the main
shaft. This represented 155 ft. of crosscutting. The
lode was cut at a point 56ft. west of the shaft. A north
drive was put in off No. 1 west crosscut and had reached
a distance of 21ft. bin., the value being per ton,
while the south drive was in sft. bin., values being
per ton. This is a work of some interest,
owing to the fact that there is a length of about 400 ft.
before the Associated boundary is reached and no
lodes the management know of have hitherto been
met with and therefore it is regarded as practically
virgin ground. At 1,750 ft., which is the next lift,
they have driven north and south on the Lake View
lode. The north drive from the No. 1 west crosscut
was extended 300 ft., while the south drive was put out
220 ft., the total amount of driving being 520 ft. The
values were about sdwt. for most of the distance in
the north drive except about 70ft., which averaged
2odwt. over a width of 12ft., whilst the rest of the drive
averaged 7ft. in wddth. The south drive was in
payable ore for the greater portion of the length stated.
An east crosscut was pushed out from the main shaft
for a distance of 350 ft. towards the Associated bound-
ary and this work picked up a few veins showing low
values. This may lead to something when driven upon.
The next level at which exploration work provided
interesting results was at the 1,450 ft., where a winze
was sunk on the Lake View lode at a point 150 ft. north
of No. 1 east crosscut from the main shaft. This work
has been done with the idea of coming on to the rich
chute at the 1,750 ft., and this winze, it may be added,
is going down in a pipe of good values, and further the
winze at this level should assist to locate the lode at
the intervening 1,600 ft. level. At 1,300 ft. it is also
proposed this year to gain further knowledge of the
Lake View and the Perseverance lodes at this depth.
All the developments of 1908 are a continuation of the
previously known lodes in the mine.
On the surface there has been progress in making
alterations to the process plant, in order that an
increase might be made in the tonnage handled, it
being raised to 18,000 tons a month and it is satisfactory
to see that the plant has retained its efficiency. A
trestle tram was erected to connect the No. 6 and No. 4
(main) shafts and an endless rope truck system in-
stalled to convey ore from the No. 6 shaft to the treat-
ment plant ore bins. The lift is direct from the bottom
of the mine and saves underground trucking.
There was a change in management last year, when
Mr. G. W. Borrowe handed over control to Mr. E.
Hogan Taylor, the metallurgist, who was appointed
acting general manager by Mr. Speak, of Messrs.
Hooper and Speak, consulting engineers to the com-
pany, who came out from London in April to inspect
and report on the mine. In February of the current
year Mr. Ernest Williams arrived from London to re-
lieve Mr. Taylor, who had accepted an appointment
on the staff of Messrs. Bewick, Moreing and Co., to
become Superintendent of the Lancefield, at Laverton.

KALGURLI GOLD MINES, LTD.
The Kalgurli had an eventful year, inasmuch as
there was a change of management early in 1908,
when Mr. R. S. Black succeeded Mr. F. A. Moss as
general manager and attorney. The last named un-
doubtedly during the long period he was in charge of
the property raised the Kalgurli into the first rank
of dividend payers on the Golden Mile, and when he
left it the future of the mine was assured for a long
time to come, for the shares in this company are
regarded from the industrial standpoint in mining
investments.
The main shaft was sunk during the year from 1,350
ft. to 1,550 ft. It will be observed from the progress
reports which have been published from time to time
in the period under review that no great amount of
development has yet been done at 1,440 ft. and 1,530 ft.
levels, but at the latter depth, on the west side of the
shaft, drives have been carried north 81ft. and south
77ft. on good grade ore in which both telluride and
free gold were at times visible. The ground plan which
is shown in connection with this reference to the work
on the Kalgurli mine in 1908 shows the extent to
which the ore bodies have been taken out on 1,350 ft.
level. It is significant to learn that beyond leading
stopes over 1,350 ft. and the 1,250 ft. levels the ground
is intact from 1,350 ft. to 1,150 ft. levels. In the other
levels sloping is being carried out on the eastern and
western ore bodies, the width of ore varying from a
few feet to as great as 120 ft.
At the time of this report prospecting was in progress
in the company’s southern lease, in which little work
had been done for some years, and recently at the 100 ft.
level a chute of rich ore 50ft. in length was located,
and it is hardly necessary to state that further ex-
ploration is being pushed ahead at this part of the
company’s property.
The winding plant on the Kalgurli is capable of
carrying the shaft to a depth of 2,000 ft. and it is the
intention of the management to continue sinking below
the 1,550 ft. level at an early date.
The treatment plant underwent no material change
during the year. It is of interest, however, to note
that the main features of the process for gold recovery
are :
Crushing in No. 5 Krupp ball mills (9) through
700 mesh.
Roasting in Edwards Simplex furnaces (15).
Separation of sand from slimes.
Regrinding in Forwood-Down pans (17).
Air agitation. And
Filterpressing the whole product.
The residues are now sluiced away to a tailings area
ij- miles distant. The work of the plant gives some
interesting figures. The average value of the residues
for the year 1908 was 3s. 7.83 d. per ton, showing an
extraction of 93.85 per cent.
From a statistical point of view the record of the
Kalgurli shows the following:—Operations of the
Company to December 31, 1908, have resulted in a
yield of gold of a value of £2,011,553 from 639,2 a
tons and dividends amounting to £795,000 have be7s
paid on a capital of £120,000. The West Australien
Government has received £39,781 17s. 6d. as tax on
the profits.
The Kalgurli has upheld its reputation for most
consistent development by the location of a good run
of high values at the 1,550 ft. level (Mr. Frank B.
Powell remarks in his articles published in London on
“ Kalgoorlie’s Golden Mile ”). When work was stopp-
ed at this point on October 15, 1908, the north drive
on the lode had been extended 38ft. in ore worth 100 s.
to 1455. per ton, and the south drive 24ft. in ore
worth 565. per ton. Work was recommenced in
December, the north drive being extended to 66ft. in
ore worth from 365. to 160 s. per ton, and the south
drive to 46ft. in ore worth 655. per ton. The position
of this lode would indicate that it is not the main ore
body, but owing to the conditions of working not
being satisfactory, all work was stopped in October
until the shaft was skidded, plats cut at 1,450 ft. level
and the cages fixed and running right through to the
surface. Now that this work is completed the manage-
ment is continuing development in the western ground
to demonstrate the exact position of the main ore
body. At the 1,350 ft. level 400 ft. in length of ore has
been proved west of the shaft. Values and widths
were good over the whole area exposed. The manager
estimates that there are at least five years’ ore of the
present output and grade in sight above the 1,350 ft.
level. A development which adds a good prospective
value to this mine occurred at the 100 ft. level, 500 ft.
south of the main shaft, during October of last year.
In going through the old workings south of the main
shaft, the management located a big lode formation
which old assays showed to be worth about 7dwt. per
ton. A start was made to drive on this north and
south. In the south drive for the first 20ft. the
values were 200 s. per ton, and from 20ft. to 30ft. the
value was 120 s. per ton, and from 30ft. to 37ft. the
value was 12s. per ton. A winze in this drive was
sunk 20ft. in ore worth 200 s. and 9ft. in ore worth 365.
In the north drive for the 16ft. driven values were
645. per ton, with the same values in the face. At a
point about 150 ft. south of where the ore body was first
located in the early days, a diamond drill located 30ft.
of ore worth 325. per ton, with two smaller seams of
higher grade ore in the lode. On the plans the lode
located in the diamond drill hole looks to be the same
as the one the Company drove on and also the same
as the Associated are developing in their property near
the Kalgurli boundary with very satisfactory results.
The fact of getting highly payable values over a good
length in this southern end of their property, which
has been practically neglected to date so far as develop-
ment work is concerned, is exceptionally encouraging
and must eventually add greatly to the proved value
of the Kalgurli, for very little work should add very
considerably to the ore reserves. All the ground at
this end of the property is intact to the surface.

CHAFFERS AND HANNANS STAR MINES.
WORK ON WINTER’S LODE DESCRIBED.
The event of the twelve months’ work at Kalgoorlie
was undoubtedly the Chaffers find. Here is a lease of
12 acres (352 E) which, one might say, is right in
the thick of the great mines of the Mile, and in which
mining operations had been carried on for many
years —in fact, from almost the early days of the Belt,
and seven years ago the main shaft had been sunk to
1,000 ft., in one part of the property, but leaving a big
blank of virgin ground quite unexplored and regarded
as one of the blanks of the field. Chance, however,
might have come to the assistance of the company
had a working from the main shaft been extended
a little distance further, for it is now reckoned that it
would have penetrated ground now thought
so highly of in connection with the 1908 discovery.
The find of April last came about as unexpectedly as
mining discoveries usually do. The telephone wire
to the Westralia Block bureau, which crosses the
Golden Horseshoe dump conveyor, became fouled and
to relieve the wires of further interference permission
was obtained by the Postal Department from the
Chaffers management to move the posts on to their
lease. This was done, with the result that in sinking
one of the holes the workmen uncovered a formation
which on examination proved to be oxidised ore.
This led to three sections of the ground being let on
tribute on the line of what was early seen to have
something more than royalties in it. Three parties
obtained terms from the company which on their face

were all that could be wished for —either for the
company or the tributors. The parties who obtained
these tributes and the areas of each block were ; No.
1 party, an area of about 320 ft. in length north and
south by about 290 ft. east and west, and the term
of the agreement will expire on April 13, 1909 ; No. 2
party, a block adjoining No. 1 on the south, with an
area of about 200 ft. in length north and south by
260 ft. in width east and west, and the term will
finish on the same date ; the No. 3 party’s area is
immediately south of No. 2 and extends to the southern
boundary of the company’s lease and will expire on
the same date as the other tributes. The tributes
were let on agreements, the principal clauses of which
were :
The company receives the following royalties on the gross
yields:—On ore up to rodwt. per ton, 5 per cent.; isdwt,,
per cent.; aodwt., 10 per cent.; 3odwt., per cent.; 40
dwt.. 15 per cent.; over 4odwt., 175 per cent. The depth of
the workings are not to exceed 150 ft. from the surface. The
tributors are at no time to have less than two or more than
eight men working in one day, the work of each man being
reckoned at eight hours per day.
When the present manager took charge of the mine
in October he recommended the board in London to
sink a new shaft on the ground held by No. 2 tribute
party in preference to crosscutting from the old shaft
to get under the ground let on tribute. This was
approved of by the directors and the work was put
in hand without delay. In the meantime the theory
that the same formation was in Hannan’s Star, at a
depth of 82ft., on the Chaffers southern boundary.

February 27, 1909.


was confirmed by work done in prospecting for the
lode. This was proved in a prospecting shaft which
was sunk on the line of the lode as disclosed by the
tributors in Chaffers. There is an intervening business
area known as the Westralia Block, which is within
the boundary of the Hannan’s Star and numbered
4433 E, but the mining rights to work underneath the
area had not been applied for up to the time of the
find on Chaffers. The company’s attorney, Mr. C. W.
Cropper, however, acquired the right from the Govern-
ment for the company to mine under the area. It was
decided that the new shaft, in the event of the oxidised
lode proving as strong at depth as it did near the
surface, should become the main shaft, and it was
accordingly designed to meet that work. The power
for the winding engine at the new shaft is a makeshift
arrangement, as the steam is partly generated from the
boilers for the compressor at the old power station.
This will no doubt be remedied when the overhead
equipment, as proposed, is installed. Otherwise the
management is displaying not only enterprise but
economy in office, etc., expenditure. When the
Journal’s representative viewed the workings in
January the staff consisted of the manager, Mr. J.
Boyd Aarons, and an assayer, with an underground
foreman. The office is in a hessian covered structure,
while the quarters for the foreman consisted of hes-
sian and corrugated iron covered camp—each of the
usual dimensions and primitive style seen on the
W.A. fields.
When this oxidised lode was first sampled it went
2dwt. gold per ton. On that showing application was
made to Mr. F. W. Cape, who was then manager, for
a tribute. At the same time, Winter, another of the
men who subsequently obtained ground on tribute,
found floaters which carried gold. He really found the
first gold but he allowed Boeree to take first pick of
the blocks which Mr. Cape agreed to let on tribute.
Fortune, however, favored Winter, as he won as the
result of his party’s work better gold —his early
crushings averaged 26dwt. per ton, as against Boeree’s
iqdwt. per ton. Up to the end of December the
crushings taken out by the tribute parties indicated
that the lode was fairly perpendicular and the stopes
averaged 10ft. of pay ore. At 90ft. the depth to
which the stopes were then taken from, the lode ap-
peared to-widen underfoot, but the values were not
so good. The new shaft was sunk by contract to
200 ft. in January of the current year, all in country,
and a crosscut was started to intersect the lode at
that level. It may be here stated that had the west
crosscut from the old No. 1 shaft been continued
another 50ft. or so this rich formation would have
been cut. It is estimated, if the distance be taken
between the No. 3 tribute workings and the boundary
of Chaffers and 150 ft. in the Hannan’s Star (where
they are driving on the No. 3 ,or west lode), that there
is at least a length of 700 ft. of oxidised ore. This
length may be interrupted, probably somewhere near
the boundary between the two leases (Hannan’s Star
and Chaffers), by a junction of the three parallel
formations which compose the lode matter in the
Star workings at 90ft. At that depth in the Hannan’s
Star the west lode (as it is called) is sft. wide and the
assays taken from 50 to 55ft. showed the following :
iq.Sdwt. per ton, I2.7dwt. per ton, and iq.Sdwt. per
ton. A prospecting shaft which was sunk in the
Hannan’s Star was down 175 ft. in January when the
workings were viewed for this report. It is intended
to crosscut from that level to Donoughmore shaft.
It is estimated that at a point about 240 ft. S.W. from
the shaft the west lode will be cut. This working
would approximately give the Chaffers lode a length
of 660 ft. in Hannan’s Star ground. The west lode,
which is being explored in Hannan’s Star, has an
underlay of about 80 deg. towards the Golden Horse-
shoe.
At the time of this report Winter’s party had sunk
the No. 4 shaft to 93ft. They put in a crosscut for
17ft. in ore which averaged i4dwt. gold per ton.
The north drive on the lode was 40ft., and it had
been stripped for a width of 15ft. for an average
value of 10 dwt. gold per ton. The south drive was
extended to 28ft., but not stripped, and the ore av-
eraged Isd\vt, gold per ton. They were engaged
stoping at the 60ft. when we viewed the working.
Boeree and party, who sunk their shaft to 80ft.,
were breaking ore at the 50ft. They followed the
lode by driving on it for 95ft, until they reached the
boundary of Prosser’s tribute block, and the average
width of the formation stoped was 9ft. Prosser and
party sunk the No. 9 shaft to 90ft., and opened out
for 52ft., on an average width of ore of 10ft.
The Chaffers Co., after the new shaft had been sunk
to 200 ft., as previously stated, started a crosscut, and,
after they were in about 40ft. a formation was entered,
carrying low values of about 2 to 3dwt. gold. The
management at once started to drive on it, but the
general opinion of those who inspected the ore and
knew the country was that the lode had not been
entered at all, and that the crosscut should have been
extended till it was well under the tribute party’s
workings before any opinion could be definitely ex-
pressed as to whether it was Winter’s lode or not.
The sulphide formation cut may be an independent
chute altogether. At any rate the shareholders in
Western Australia have been critical, not only in
regard to the non-continuation of the crosscut, but also
in reference to the wording of certain cablegrams
which were despatched to London when the crosscut
first intersected the sulphide. Of course, as is generally
the case, the onlooker reckons he knows more about
the mining game than those actually engaged in it.
Experience and training in his opinion carry no weight,
for he (the onlooker) knows what should have been
done and what should not have been done by the
management. It is quite likely that by the time the
tribute agreements expire in April that the company
will have resumed work at the crosscut, and the proof
of whether this lode lives at depth and in pay values
will be on record. In the meantime it would be more
reassuring to investors and others who are interested
in the Chaffers and the Hannan’s Star Companies if a
settled policy of exploration had been determined on
and carried out right from the start.
It is certain that in the event of Chaffers lode being
exposed further south than already found in Hannan’s
Star that it will prove part of Morrison’s lode as it is
striking almost due south. In the opposite direction,
at the other end, the Golden Horseshoe will have a
good length of it to the north.

BOULDER DEEP LEVELS.
One of the mines to the south of the big gold pro-
ducers is the Boulder Deep Levels, a property which
has something more to recommend it than the poppet
legs and winding engine, etc., if the people in control
would only see it. There is a fair-sized block of Isdwt.
ore, not so very deep, and then again at depth the ore
proved at time Mr. Ralph Nichols was in charge is a
further asset. When Messrs. Bewick, Moreing and
Co. were general managers further development work
was done which contributed to the ore reserves and
yet the company would not make up its mind and
erect a treatment plant. Consequently the control
changed and up to early last year the last state of
affairs was practically worse than the first. However,
the find on the surface of Chaffers cheered up those
responsible for the mark-time policy, but the Journal
would like to know what policy for future has been
decided upon. Discussion on possibilities of the ex-
tension of this formation certainly embrace this mine.
If the company will not “ get a move on,” then why
not sell out to others who will ? At the 900 ft. the
“ north drive has entered the Hannan’s Star lease and
is being carried along the lode, with not very encourag-
ing results up to the present. There are no connections
on the lode between the 1,100 and 900 ft. levels and
none between the 900 ft. level and the surface, so that
in the event of stoping being started on the known
runs of ore the initial expenditure to make arrangements

for getting mullock into the stopes, ventilation, etc.,
would not be a light one. At the 900 ft. level there is
a run of ore about 280 ft. long and Bft. wide. A leading
stope was taken off this run of ore and crushed with the
other ore, which was paddocked when the drive was
being carried through the chute. The whole of the
material broken, about 500 tons, was crushed, and
showed a gross value of bos. per ton. The last official
estimate of ore reserves was 50,000 tons, with an
extractable value of 385.”
NORTH KALGURLI CO., LTD.
This group of leases is let on tribute, along with the
mill and cyanide plant. The company was formed
in August, 1901, and acquired the properties of the
North Kalgurli G.M. Co. and Brookman Brothers’
Boulder G.M. Co., Ltd., the leases of which comprise
66 acres:—Golden Gate (281 E), Pearce’s prospecting
party (287 E), and Genevieve (444 E). The 10-head
mill and slimes plant is comparatively speaking new
and for a time was leased to the Brownhill Extended
Co. In 1908 there was considerable activity on this
property by the tribute parties who are at work, and,
in consequence of the good returns, a new agreement
was made by the general manager, Mr. D. D. Sinclair,
in which an increased royalty to 15 per cent, was
provided for and the tribute was allowed the free use
of the mill instead of a rental of £6O per month. For
the year which ended October, under the new manage-
ment, there had been crushed approximately 14,660
tons for 3,73802. ; and a profit of £BOO Bs. 6d. was
made on the company’s financial year which needed
August 31, and for the two months after (September
and October) the company received in rent and
royalty £524. Under the tribute system of work the
management hold that a revenue can be derived from
the oxidised ore which was previously discarded as
useless. It is hoped that operations into the sulphide
zone will also be extended with profit to the company
and to the tribute parties. Up against the Associated
Northern boundary, where the North Kalgurli has a
narrow strip of ground, some interest was caused early
in the year through a working in the Associated
Northern cutting a dab of pay ore, but it was of no
extent and it petered out before the North Kalgurli
line was reached.
HANNANS REWARD, LTD.
The irony of fate has probably caused this company
—the holders of the ground which constitutes the
original find of Hannan and Pearce, and which has
led to the recovery of gold worth about 45 millions
sterling at Kalgoorlie—to have the distinction of milling
at a small profit, a large tonnage of ore, which yields
about 3dwt. gold per ton. The economical work of the
tributors, combined with the open cut system of mining,
enables Mr. D. D. Sinclair to manage so well for the
Hannan’s Reward, Ltd. Ore is broken in this way
down to the 200 ft. level and then lifted to the mill.
The area of the company’s ground is 95 acres and
made up as follows : —Hannan’s Hill, 97E ; Hannan’s
Reward, 160 E; Mt. Charlotte, 211 E, 212 E, 213 E ;
and Brilliant, i,653E. The mill has 30-head of stamps
and there is a cyanide plant, the mine, mill, etc.,
being let on tribute. The Reward Lode has been
opened up at the south end for 493 ft. by the tribute,
and the ore has given an average yield of 15s. 6d. per
ton, out of which royalty and all costs have been paid,
after giving the tribute party fair wages .It is esti-
mated that to a depth of 80ft. there is practically
several years’ profitable work ahead if the present
values in the ore be maintained.

GT. BOULDER MAIN REEF, LTD.
This company, in view of the fact of its great pros-
pective value in getting the southerly continuation of
the Gt. Boulder lode at or about 3,000 ft., has been the
centre of considerable interest and discussion among
mining engineers. The trend of this lode, according
to the most recent plans of deep work in the Gt.
Boulder, certainly lends color to this conclusion. The
property of the Gt. Boulder Main Reef, Ltd., consists
of lease No. 873 E (24 acres in extent) and adjoins the
Gt. Boulder Prop, on the south. The mine has been
worked for over twelve years, and, like one or two
of the smaller companies on the Golden Mile, has had
ups and downs, at one time distributing profits, at
another doing next to nothing, and subsequently going
through the reconstruction process. The men who
have stood behind it from the first deserve the highest
commendation, for it is to their credit there was no
reorganisation for further capital till February, 1905 —
the company therefore practically worked for ten years
after its registration in August, 1895. The present
venture, which was registered in October, 1907, has
an authorised capital of £65,000 in 260,000 shares of
ss. each. There was a calling power of is. on the
130,000 shares issued at 4s. paid. The form of the
reconstruction of the second scheme was this :—One
share credited with 3s. paid was offered for each old
fully paid ss. share, the liability being payable 6d. on
application, and the balance in calls not exceeding
6d., at intervals of not less than two months. In 1908
when working capital was again short further re-
construction was threatened, but this was averted by
a timely discovery in the vicinity of the main shaft,
enabling the board to put out a large block of the
unissued shares to a group in London, who had become
seized of the importance of the property, as a deep
level proposition. There is evidence that the enterprise
of the capitalists who came to the rescue will receive
due reward —provided, of course, the theory advanced
by engineers at Kalgoorlie that the continuation of
the Boulder lode will be payable when it is intersected
in Main Reef ground. The policy of the company is
now entirely centred upon sinking the main shaft to
a depth of 3,000 ft. or more, with the object previously
referred to. The year saw good progress made in that
direction.
Treatment plant. —The reduction plant on the
Gt. Boulder Main Reef consists of three No. 5 ball mills,
two of which are of the Krupp pattern and one is a
Humbolt. There are four Edward’s roasters, single
hearth ; seven Forwood-Down sft. grinding pans.
The filterpresses consist of four 42m. Dehne, while
the power pumps are of the Pearn type, assisted by
the Evans and Forwood-Down’s. The agitation vats
are of steel.
Power Plant. —There are four Lancashire and one
Babcock and Wilcox boilers. The winding engine is a
Ruston Proctor and is duplex direct coupled, while
the mill engine is a Fraser and Chalmers compound
tandem. The air compressor engine is by Thompson,
of Castlemaine, Vic., and is a cross compound. The
condenser plant consists of one machine by Allen and
Son and one by Knowles.
THE MINE.
As previously stated, the Gt. Boulder Main Reef
has in view the cutting of the rich Gt. Boulder lode
which had such high values at 2,200 ft., and in sinking
the shaft in the Main Reef there were during the
year two strikes of ore, which discoveries galvanized
the main work with a degree of activity which in
other circumstances would not have been expected by
either those operating the property or the people
who give attention to the market. In 1908 Mr. Albert
Wauchope, the general manager, succeeded in deepen-
ing the main shaft 289 ft. —took it down from 1,760 ft.
to below 2,000 ft. It will be observed from the plan
which is given that the management did not waste any
time in exploring the makes of ore which were passed
through. In May, 1908, a lode was met with in the
shaft, but the management could not say what it was.
The values on assay averaged B|dwt. It came in at
1,930 ft. and left the shaft at 1,980 ft., lying to the
west. At 2,000 ft. in cutting the plat (west) there was
encountered the same lode, which was disturbed and
broken, owing to the presence of a slide. This lode
is now being followed by a drive north, on which a few
feet had been done at the time of this report. This
work, in consequence of the need for progress in deep-
ening the shaft, proceeded slowly, as the management
was determined to keep work going under full pressure
at depth. In crosscutting east at 2,000 ft. and at a
point 29ft. in, a very well defined lode, five feet in
width but with low values (3dwt.), was cut and has
been driven on north for about 15ft-, a little gold being
visible in driving. As previously stated the shaft was
below 2,000 ft., and at that depth the last mentioned
lode matter has come in and is covering the full width
of the shaft, with gold visible in the stone —width
4ft. and values 4dwt. It is going down strong under
foot. The other work on the property during the year
was done by a party of tributors who sunk 90ft.
This work is at a point about 300 ft. south of the main
shaft, where a tribute was let, when they picked up a
small vein carrying values after going down 50ft.,
and it widened out to between three and four feet ;
they then drove south 70ft., after which work there
was a fair body of ore opened out for the mill. A bulk
crushing showed this formation to have a gross assay
value of iBdwt. per ton.
The improved prospects of this well situated mine
practically began below the 1,900 ft. level, owing
to the proximity of the lease to the Gt. Boulder and
Horseshoe mines, and, as already noted, to the fact
that the Gt. Boulder’s main ore chute has shown a
decided pitch to the south from the 1,200 ft. downwards.
“ From data supplied at the Main Reef mine office a
borehole put out at the 1,400 ft. level located a run of
ore about 20ft. in width and carrying high values at a
point 60ft. below the 1,750 ft. level, and 60ft. south
of the Gt. Boulder boundary in the Main Reef Co.’s
ground.” This is a recent London view on the outlook
as regards the getting of the continuation of the Gt.
Boulder lode. It is added ; “ The development work
now in progress at the 2,000 ft. level in the Main Reef
is to prove the section of ground indicated to be
carrying high values by this borehole.” It is hoped,
according to what the directors state in London,
that as the result of a deep level scheme of development
that shaft sinking will progress at the rate of 70 to 80ft.
per month until the 3,000 ft. is attained.
With regard to the future work at depth, the manager
is of opinion that it will be 3,300 ft. before the Gt.
Boulder lode can be cut at a depth which will give
the company a chance to make extraction of ore pay.
Of course, this is taking it for granted, but there is not
much doubt about it, if the records of the Gt. Boulder
be referred to, that the Gt. Boulder lode will be there
alright. The next level in the Gt. Boulder Main Reef
will be at 2,300 ft.
NEW REEFERS G.M. CO., LTD.
This is a Kalgoorlie company, in which townsmen
have shown their faith in local ownership and manage-
ment of a mine. It is located at the extreme North
End of the field. The leases comprise No. 4,284 E,
containing 12 acres, and application has been made
for lease No. 4,i3iE, containing 24 acres (next to the
Hannan’s North G.M.), 31 chains along the line of
lode, and 14 chains in width. The capital is £lO,OOO
in 100,000 shares of 2S. each, of which 50,000 went to
the vendors to purchase the mine, etc. In the early
days the Reefers mine was worked to some advantage,
but high working costs, dear water and obsolete machi-
nery and methods, eventually gave no profit. Levels
are driven at 200, 400 and 500 ft. At the 200 ft. there is
estimated to be 350 ft. of ore still standing. The mine has
been equipped with a 10-head mill, self feeders and ore
bin and driven by electric power. Mill is to be paid for
within twelve months out of gold won. Mr. J. F.
Hokin, Hannan’s-street, is secretary to the company,
and among those interested as shareholders are Messrs.
A. E. Sharland, J. J. Dwyer, J. D. Stowell, T. Mullis,
and F. H. Rickarby. Between March, 1907, and
October, 1908, 142 tons of sulphide ore and 83 tons of
oxidised ore gave 2250 Z. i7dwt. The dump, which is
estimated to contain 6,000 tons oxidised ore worth
Bdwt. over the plates, will be treated by the mill.

ASSOCIATED NORTHERN BLOCKS (W.A.)’LTD.
This Company, working the Iron Duke lease (49E),
is an off-shoot of the Associated Gold Mines
Ltd.,* and owns in addition : Iron Monarch (52E),
Medindie Hill (53E), and Medindie Hill Extended
(263 E). It is under the same management as the
Associated, with Mr. G. M. Roberts as general manager.
The main shaft has been sunk 1,045 ft. and the lease
crosscut at that level. At present work is confined
to the 550 ft. level and upwards.
No new ore was discovered during the year 1908,
and no important alterations made to the plant in
that period. The process of reduction and treatment,
which was at the time of its erection the most modern
at Kalgoorlie, is briefly : The ore is coarse-crushed,
milled in ball mills, roasted, completely silmed in
Wheeler pans, agitated with cyanide, and filterpressed,
some of the gold being saved by amalgamation in the
process of fine grinding. The ore is elevated to the
brace, where the trucks are tipped by means of a kick
up on to a grizzly, the oversize being crushed by a
No. 5 Gate’s breaker, the whole being distributed by a
Robins belt conveyor over a 400 ton bin. The whole
of the ore, after having been milled by the ball mills,
is delivered to five feed openings. These lead to five
Merton roasting furnaces. This furnace is a modifica-
tion of the Edwards roasting furnace, over which it has
some advantages. It has three hearths, all level, and
connected with one another at alternate ends, and
occupies a floor space of 34ft. x 10ft. In agitation with
cyanide the pulp is usually treated about 24 hours,
but the time varies from 16 to 20 hours. The greater
part of the gold is dissolved during the first four hours
of the treatment. Average tonnage handled, 3,370
tons, at a cost of ns. Bd. for dry crushing, roasting and
cyaniding.
OUTPUT, 1908; Tons treated, 44,221 ; value,
£106,215.
SONS OF GW ALIA SOUTH G.M., LTD.
This mine is located, as its title indicates, south and
adjoining the Sons of Gwalia, Ltd. (the solid mine
of the Northern Fields, in the year under review),
and it has a total area of 86| acres, including water
right—leases are 198 C, 1,082 c, ,1,257 c, 1,258 c,
The company is one of the successes of the year, as
regards locally controlled ventures, and has its head
office and directorate at Kalgoorlie, with Mr. C. W.
Cropper as Secretary.
A concentrates treatment plant was added to the
surface equipment during the year and it was in full
work in the closing months of 1908. It gave good
results, but to effect an improvement, by the saving
of time, a small vacuum filter was installed, as time
was lost in allowing the pulp to settle after agitation
before the solution could be decanted. The Cassels
slimes treatment plant, also installed in 1908, is quite
equal to the tonnage of 60 tons per day it was built
to cope with and officially it is satisfactory to learn
that the results are up to expectations.
THE MINE.
The main shaft at the time of writing had been
sunk to a depth of 349 ft. vertical and they were still
sinking. At the No. 4 level (400 ft.) a winze had
been sunk 83ft. (all in ore), and values in this averaged,
as work proceeded, 355. per ton for a width of 72
inches, and at bottom reached the Sons of Gwalia
boundary. At that point a start was made to open
up the No. 5 level of the mine by drives north and
south from the bottom of the shaft, and ore of high
value was being driven on in the north drive. V alues
in the south drive were not so high, but there is
every promise of opening up ore of good average value
in this direction.
In connection with the work at the 300 ft. level, an
incline shaft has been sunk iooft t to No. 4 level, and
a further 83ft. (on the incline) to the Sons of Gwalia
boundary. It is intended to sink the main shaft to
about 450 ft. and crosscut to the lode, and get under
it close to the Gwalia boundary and draw all ore,
from below No. 3, from this new level. In addition
to the main ore body (known as the Sons of Gwalia
South chute) a new and payable lode was recently
located at the 300 ft. level, at a point in the west
crosscut 285 ft. west of the main level.
Where driven upon to the Sons of Gwalia boundary
the ore was of considerable width and payable values,
the last 50ft. averaging over 80s. per ton for a width
of 6ft. As the trend of the ore chute is to the south,
as depth is attained, the Company will get a longer
length of the rich chute. A rise to the surface is
being put up in the ore body, and also a winze is
being sunk on it.
In the old No. 4 shaft—originally sunk by the
prospectors and recently deepened by the Company —
at a point 475 ft. west of the Company’s eastern
boundary, at a depth of 80ft., another lode was cut,
the average width of which is 7ft. and values bos.
per ton. The discovery of this lode, which is under-
lying east and dipping south, should further enhance
the value of the property, as it had not previously
been worked elsewhere in the mine.
Ore reserves : The ore in reserve above the 400 ft.
was estimated at 25,150 short tons, of an assay value
of 58s. per ton. The probable ore below that depth
can safely be reckoned at 15,000 tons and value
bos. per ton. These were given in the last half-yearly
report at 40,150 tons, but the steepening of the new
incline shaft points to the conclusion that more ore
will be available in the future than anticipated.

PH'LLIPS RIVER.
KUNDIP MINES—ONE COMPANY AT WORK.
The progress of mining at Kundip, Phillips River
field, during 1908, has been continuous. About a
dozen mines are within the group —all have opened
out fresh ground and most of them have produced
good values. Four batteries, belonging to the Flag,
the Harbor Lights, the Gem, and the Two Boys,
were kept on crushing stone which was high in gold
and contained little copper, while the Hillsborough,
the Christmas Gift, and other mines had occasional
parcels put through. Besides this a large quantity
of copper ore has been sent to the Phillips River
G. and C. Co.’s Ravensthorpe smelter. All the
Kundip mines (except the Flag) are in the hands of
private parties, and little if any information of their
progress is available, and rarely even is the result of a
crushing, or the value of a parcel sent to the smelter,
published. That, no doubt, is the reason why shafts
have not been sunk below water level, which is about
100 ft.
With the Flag, however, the case is different, as
full progress reports have been published regularly.
This company was formed nearly two years ago, and
started a main shaft to exploit the deep ground.
Heavy water delayed operations for a time, but the
difficulty was overcome and the lode has been opened
up for over 600 ft. at the 200 ft. level, where large
quantities of rich gold and copper ore have been dis-
closed. The best stone worked on the mine, at the
upper levels, was from the Iron Cap chute. From
the surface to below the 100 ft. level high values were
consistently obtained. At the 200 ft. level the Iron Cap
chute is 100 ft. long, and between 3ft. and 4ft. wide,
and contains throughout fully as much gold and copper
as formerly. Even with the present low 7 price of copper
the management estimate the gross value of the ore
at £lO per ton, and they are conservative in that
valuation. The other chutes of stone do not appear
to be so consistent, but wherever struck they furnish
good copper ore for the smelter, and the balance of
the stone is treated at the battery on the mine. Several
rises are now being put up to enable stoping to proceed
on an extensive scale. At the 100 ft. level about 300 ft.
of payable stone was worked for an average width
of nearly 3ft. At the 200 ft. level gold values are
higher and copper contents continue as before, while
the width of lode and length of the chutes seem
to increase. So far the lode has been chiefly
oxidised, and it is intended to sink to the
300 ft. level, where in more solid country, sulphide ore
will be certain to rule the ore contents of the formation
and a large addition to the reserves will be made.
On the surface the mine is fairly well equipped.
On the main shaft there is a 60 h.p. boiler, winding
engine, pumps, cages, and baling tanks —80,000 gallons
of water a day are produced, and this is easily handled.
Much of the water is used at the company’s battery
and also at the battery of the Two Boys mine, which
is a short distance away. The mill on the mine consists
of 5 head of stamps and extra stamps will shortly be
erected, as a large quantity of free milling ore is now
available. The battery is driven by a 14 h.p. oil
engine.
The company has over 7,000 tons of tailings con-
taining some copper and from 7dwt. to qdwt. gold
per ton. The Phillips River Co. has purchased a moiety
of the heap. The balance should show some good
profits when the sands and slimes are treated.
Up till recently copper ore when sent to the smelter
cost to the mine—including cartage, smelting charges,
deductions, etc. —about £7 per ton. This cost is now
considerably reduced. The reduction works out at
between £2 and £3 per ton. When the railway is
continued to the smelter another 9s. or 10s. will be
saved. Battery treatment has not till lately been
satisfactory, as about 50 per cent, of the gold was
saved over the plates. In consequence of the eopper
content the cyanide process was not applicable to the
tailings. Now, however, the new oil engine having
lowered surface costs and a much higher extraction
of gold is obtained. Hitherto the bulk of the stone
has come from development work, but owing prac-
tically to unlimited stoping being available the under-
ground costs are now low. During a part of the last
half year these new conditions obtained, and for that
period the company made a gross profit of nearly
£2,000. Only 3801 tons of copper ore were then sent
to the smelter. It may be noted that in the month
of January, 1909, about 200 tons were delivered and
arrangements have been made for continuing a large
weekly supply.
The Flag mine is owned by a Westralian Company,
with an issued capital of £9,000, £4,000 of which had
to be paid to the former owners. The comparatively
small available balance has enabled the mine to be
equipped and well developed. Probably other mines
at Kundip would be in a similar healthy position if
they had been assisted when the water level was
reached. But with one exception even the 100 ft.
level has not been opened. Now, however, with the
advent of the railway and the reduced smelting costs
the higher margin of profits may allow the present
owners to prospect the deeper ground.
Between July 1 and December 31, 1908, the Flag
crushed 935 tons stone for 886 oz. 6dwt. gold over the
plates, worth £2,879 (£3 Is - P er ton ore treated)
and sold to the Phillips River Co.’s smelters 340.5 tons,
containing gold and copper worth £3,604 (£lO 12s.
per ton of ore smelted) —a total of 1,275.5 tons for
£6,483. Since its inception the company has crushed
2,211.5 tons for 1,85702. ndwt. gold, worth £5,672 17s.
(£2 ns. 3d. per ton of ore treated), and sold to the
smelters 746 tons, containnig gold and copper worth
£8,631 17s. (£ll ns. sd. per ton of ore smelted) —
a grand total of 2,957.5 tons for £14,304 14s. In
addition, the tailings from the stone milled still
contain about Bdwt. gold per ton. Owing to the large
reserves now available, and the reduced smelting costs
about 200 tons per week will be sent to the smelter
during the current year.
SANDSTONE DEVELOPMENT G.M. CO.
This is an Australian company, the greater part of the
working capital having been raised in Sydney, N.S.W.,
to operate a group of eight leases, at Sandstone, on
the Black Range field, and having a total area of about
192 acres. The principal workings are on the Juno
lease, which is on the west side of the Oroya Black
Range Co.’s mine, which is the leading British owned
enterprise on this comparatively speaking new field.
The Sandstone Development G.M. Co., Ltd., has a
nominal capital of £62,500, divided into 250,000 shares
of ss. each, of which 4s. was the amount paid up
as the result of four calls of is. each. The office of the
company is at Egan-street, Kalgoorlie, and the manag-
ing director is Mr. C. F. de Jersey Grut.
On the Juno lease the main shaft, at the end of the
year, had been sunk to 370 ft. vertical, to cut the
underlay of one of the ends of the Oroya Black Range
lode which was reckoned to have left their ground
at 183 ft. vertical. The lode is not yet cut in the No. 1
shaft, but the company expect it to come in at 350 ft.
According to the official report of this company, the
lode from which the bulk of the ore has been sent to
the State battery for treatment, gave an approximate
value per ton of 121 s. —2,300 tons were treated for
£13,935, to the middle of October, 1908. This, it is
announced, was mainly the result of development work
which has given 200 ft. in backs. A winze has been
sunk on the underlay which shows that the ore is
dipping west of north at an angle of 28 to 30 deg.
Work has been concentrated there, as the company
has ample funds to carry on development work. A
crushing early in the year (1909) replenished the
exchequer. This was the result of a parcel of 735 tons
of good grade ore, which was on the surface at the end
of the year and was treated at the State battery sub-
sequently. The bulk of this came from the winze r
which is at a depth of 300 ft. vertical. With regard to
the equipment of the property, it has been decided
that a wet crushing mill will be installed, when the
lode is cut in the No. 1 shaft. So far as can be ob-
served, as a result of work on this mine, pay values
lie to the north end of the lode. Mr. E. Whitfeld is
in charge of the mine.

WEST AUSTRALIAN COAL FIELDS.
THE COLLIE PROPRIETARY MINE.
The Proprietary Collieries, Ltd., is the pioneer con-
cern of the West Australian coalfields. It has been
established about 11 years and is situated at Collie,
being 25 miles (on a branch line) from the south-
western railway, at Brunswick Junction, and 124 miles
distant from Perth. Bunbury is about 40 miles from
the coalfield. Some seven years ago the Company
acquired the property of the Westralia Wallsend Co.,
and the whole was merged into one proposition. The
area of the leases is 5,000 acres. The surface workings
are situated in an angle or V, between the connections
of the Cardiff and Narrogin lines and the Brunswick
branch. The Company has about a mile of private
sidings, which are in constant use, and have the largest
and most important colliery in the district. The
tunnel system has been used in the development and
the working of the property, and the general principle
of operating will compare very favorably with the
most up-to-date mines in New South Wales. The
tunnel has a grade of 1 in 7, and haulage is effected by
means of an endless wire rope which was installed
immediately after the amalgamation of the two pits.
This is fed by main and tail ropes along the main levels,
the whole being worked with two large drums on the
surface. To instance the extent of the company’s
operations it may be stated that a few years ago the
total length of workings was approximately 60 miles,
but the removal of pillars and the consequent collapses
in the old workings has reduced this. At the present
rate of output the company has sufficient coal under
lease to continue its operations for over 100 years.
All the underground mechanical work is accomplished
with electricity-pumping (and something like half a
million gallons are put out daily), coal cutting, boring,
ventilating, and a portion of the haulage. The genera-
ting plant consists of two 85 K.W. dynamos (Parker
and Crampton) and engines, capable of transmitting
200 h.p., and in addition supplying light to the town
of Collie. The engines in use are : An Austral Otis
and a Ransome, Sims and Jeffries, also a Morrison
winding engine of about 200 h.p. for working the
endless rope and the underground main and tail rope
haulage. These give employment to four Cornish and
two multitubular boilers, besides an extensive black-
smithy, fitters’ shop and an electrician’s department.
About 150 men and 13 horses are employed in the
pits. There are three electrical coal cutting machines
(2 Jeffrey and 1 Sullivan) in use, and two boring
machines. The power for these machines is transmitted
about a mile and a half underground, and the coal
won has to be hauled that distance to the surface.
The coal cutting machines are capable of undercutting
5 bords to a depth of 6 feet in one shift (8 hours), or
equal to the work of twelve men under the old pick
method. Frequently 200 tons of coal are cut in this
way in one shift, but the average is about 150 tons
under all circumstances.
The coal seams are semi-bituminous and markedly
hydrous, some of them entirely and others indefinite
layers, bearing a strong resemblance to the “ glance ”
coal of central and southern Europe. The coal meas-
ures resemble the oligocene coal measures of Croatia.
For many years the Company has supplied the bulk
of the coal used by the Western Australian Government
Railway Department, and under the recent redistribu-
tion of the Government order they are supplying 38
per cent. Only 70 per cent, of Collie coal is used by
the Department in summer time and 80 per cent, in
winter, so that the Government estimate of Collie
Proprietary coal is easily seen. It was only last year
that an opportunity occurred, through the N.S.W.
coal strike, of testing the value of Collie coal for
bunkering purposes, as the result of which the Company
has cultivated a very large shipping connection and
have current contracts with over forty of the leading
maritime houses. Previous to this time it was gener-
ally throught that Collie coal was particularly liable
to spontaneous combustion, though there was no valid
reason for this assumption. Such has been the ap-
preciation of the merits of the Proprietary Co.’s coal
that over 8,000 tons were bunkered in 1908, the
average for the past six months being 1,000 tons a
month. The private trade of the company is therefore
growing very rapidly.
From the mouth of the tunnel the coal is hauled to
a gantry 30ft. high, where it is weighed, and then
tipped on to the various screens before loading takes
place. All the coal passes over a screen with | inch
openings, and the small which escapes is re-elevated
and passed over a jigging screen where it is washed
and turned into nuts for use in the automatic stokers
at the W.A. Government Railway workshops, Midland
Junction. From the jigging screen the coal dust is
carried off to the dump.
The mine is in every way opened up and operated
on modern lines, being well lighted and ventilated,
and it has enjoyed a remarkable immunity from
accident. Mr. R. C. Young is the present lessee of
the property and he also acts in the capacity of general
manager. The rates of wages paid by the company
are as follows :
The pays are made fortnightly. As can be gauged
from the work of the pumps, which has already been
referred to, the mine is in close proximity to the
Collie river and work is carried on directly under the
bed of the Collie river, yet withal the mine is compara-
tively dry and the working conditions are good. In
winter time, when the river has been running a banker,
the pumps have ejected a million gallons of water daily.
Fire-damp is unknown and naked lights are used by
the pitmen.
ENGINEERING WORKS FOR MINES.
HOSKINS & CO, LTD.
The works of Hoskins and Co., Ltd., at Wellington-
street, Perth, are probably the best equipped for
general engineering work in the State, and the orders
executed since the opening of this establishment speak
for the quality of the material and thoroughness of the
labor put into it. Messrs. Cable and Wallace are di-
rectors for the firm, with the assistance of a works’
manager.
It is of interest to record that when the S.s. Manx
Fairy was rebuilt as the s.s. Westralian; Hoskins and
Co., I td., were the builders. The whole of the plates and
frame were made in Wellington-street, and the parts
were assembled and put together at the river side,
Perth, where the vessel was launched. The engines
of the original steamer were overhauled and the new
boilers constructed by the firm. This work was design-
ed and carried out under the supervision of Mr. J. F.
Allen, C.E., of Henry-street, Fremantle. Large orders
for castings for pipes in connection with the metro-
politan sewerage scheme' and government contracts
for water mains, etc., also show the capacity of the
plant.
The boiler shop, which has a floor space of 9,000
sq. ft., is equipped with the following tools :—A set
of plate rollers for boiler plates, rollers to take plates
up to 14ft. between the standards for shipbuilding,
also another set of rollers for light plates and funnel
work. There are two shearing and punching machines
capable of dealing with steel plate and angle iron
croppers, a planing machine for heavy boiler work
(which is claimed to be the largest in the State),
special boiler shell and flue drilling machines
are also in operation. A large number of hydraulic
machines are at work, and include a plant
for rivetting Lancashire boilers up to 30ft. x 10ft. in
diameter, a powerful multiple punch for pipe-making
which punches 50 diameter holes through 5-i6in.
plate at once. There are also a number of rivetting
machines for rivetting pipes up to 48m. The boiler
plate and angle iron furnace cover a floor space of
240 sq. ft. Another machine installed at the works
41

is a girder straightening machine, which is capable of
exerting a pressure of 75 tons. A centre lathe with
double geared bed, three large drilling machines, shap-
ing machine, shaft sawing machine, and two emery
grinding machines complete the equipment of the
boiler shop. In the pattern shop, which covers about
I,ooosq. ft., there are fitted up bandsaw, wood turning
lathes for column and wheel patterns, and small lathe
for brass pattern work ; also circular saw, a Fox’s
universal trimming machine and pattern benches.
In the foundry department there are two large
cupolos 32m. in diameter, which can melt 5 tons per
hour. There are also in this division of the works a
small cupolo of 2J tons capacity per hour, a ibolb.
brass furnace, and a large vertical pipe stove equipped
with a vertical carriage. A2O ton and a 3-ton travell-
ing crane find employment here. For the testing of
water pipes there has been installed a machine capable
of testing flanged and spigot socket pipes from 3m.
to I2in. This machine will exert a pressure of qoolb.
per sq. inch. Another machine used in the pipe
department is a vertical plant for making 48m. dia-
meter flanged pipes up to tons in weight. There
are a number of hand and crane ladles from J to 6
tons capacity. Three travelling cranes of 4 tons, 10
tons and 5 tons are installed to deal with the various
kinds of work for which each is adapted.
In the blacksmiths’ department there is a steam
hammer and six blast forges, a faucet pipe welding
furnace and rivet heating furnace. .Saws for cutting
both hot and cold iron are at work and also a bar, angle
and plate straightening machine. There is a heavy wheel
turning lathe, which has turned out for one of the
State’s big mines a rope driving wheel weighing 12
tons, with 16 grooves for 2in. ropes. The same machine
has turned a wheel 12ft. diam., 3ft. bin. wide on face,
and crank shafts up to 4 tons. The other lathes in
use in the engineers’ shop includes two centre bed
double geared lathes.
The Wellington-street works of Hoskins and Co.,
Ltd., make a speciality of pipe work, having installed
a large plant to carry out work for the Government and
various municipaliteis throughout the State, which
consisted of cast iron specials for various purposes.
The pipe plant is capable of turning out 2,376 3m.
pipes per week. The firm make all sizes of spigot and
faucet pipes on a Banks’ machine specially constructed
for this kind of work. Sluice valves from 3m. to ibin.
have been made at the works, as also have steam stop
valves and boiler fittings. The firm have a most
up-to-date stock of battery and filterpress parts and
boiler requirements in stock. The plant at the works
is capable of dealing with castings up to 6 tons in
weight. For those mines which use rope driving the
firm have machinery which will turn out pullies up to
Bft. in diameter and of all widths and bores. There
is also a large assortment of Plummer block patterns
from lin. to Sin. Work in gunmetal and magnolia
metal is also done. The foundry stands on two acres
of ground and gives employment to a large number of
men.
THE KALGOORLIE FOUNDRY.
It cannot be too widely known that at Kalgoorlie,
the centre of mining in this State, there are appliances
and men ready to undertake and execute any reasonable
order which mechanical engineers may require. For
instance, at the Kalgoorlie Foundry, with its spacious
machine and fitting shops, casting floor and furnaces
and pattern shop, there are works which cover an area
of 4 acres. A brief inspection of Messrs. Silverthorne
and Adair’s, works well repays the time devoted to it.
After leaving the chief office the visitor is conduct-
ed to the machine shop. There is a powerful steam
hammer which is a striking feature of this part of the
works. The lathe, which is capable of turning any
work up to 15ft. in diameter and weighing up to 10
tons, recently turned the shaft of the main winding
engine of the Gt. Boulder Prop. Gold Mines, which
piece of steel had a weight of 8 tons when forged in
Victoria. This is an example of what can be done at
the foundry not only in a case of emergency, as this was,
but also in the ordinary course of the business of
these works. In the moulding shop, as one passed along
was observed an intricate casting for the Associated
G.M. The furnaces are very completely equipped, and
one of which is capable of treating 30 tons per diem.
There is an overhead hydraulic crawl, used which is
capable of lifting 20 tons, for boiler rivetting work,
and is claimed to be second to none in Western Austra-
lia. It was observed that two Cornish boilers 26ft.
x 6|ft. and 28ft. x y|ft. respectively had just been
completed to order of one of the leading mines on the
Northern fields, the working pressure of these boilers
being 1301 b.
To facilitate the receipt of material for the works
and the despatch of executed orders, there is a private
siding from the Government railway line of about one
mile in length. There are also loading and unloading
facilities, which consist of cranes capable of lifting 20
tons. In addition there is a Marshall traction engine
which is used exclusively for transport purposes from
the foundry to the mines. It is capable of drawing
7 tons and its use has already demonstrated that it
effects a big saving on the cost of similar work perform-
ed by horse power.
These works it may be noted were established in
1898 and have therefore been running for a decade,
and now comprise what was the outfit of four separate
foundries in operation at Kalgoorlie and Boulder.
There is a steam saw milling plant to shape the timber
for the pattern shop. The patterns are stored in a
separate two-storied building where, it was stated,
had been accumulated 4,000 models in various forms.
A feature of this department of the Kalgoorlie foundry
is the complete arrangements that exist for giving
careful attention to work which comes under the eye
of the draughtsman. Over 100 men find permanent
employment on the works.
WESTRALIAN MACHINERY CORPORATION.
The Westralian Machinery Corporation, Ltd., may
fairly be described as a firm too well known and too long
established to require special reference to possibly
draw the attention of seekers after machinery and mine
equipment to them ; still, in the continual progressive
march forward, which is so noticeable on Westralia’s
goldfields, it is well that the fact that the Corporation
have kept well ahead of the times should be chronicled.
It may be said that no machinery yards offer a better
selection of high class mining machinery and plant.
High speed direct-coupled engines and dynamos, and
30-head stamp batteries of the latest design are to be
seen daily in stock, and the machinery purchaser who
could not fill his requirements by half-an-hour’s in-
spection of the yards would be hard to find. Mr. C.
de .Bernales, the managing director of the Corporation,
is doing all in his power to give satisfaction to the
firm’s clients and his success in this direction can be
well judged by the large number of orders executed
recently : —Callion Gold Mines —complete 10-head
battery, ore bin, rock crushers, driving engine, 2
winding engines, plunger pump, pipes, Cornish and
vertical boilers, etc. McKenna, Jordan and Party —•
io-head battery, pumps, piping, etc. Fenian Gold

tanks. Bull Oak Mine (Sandstone) —winding engine.
Havilah Mine (Sandstone)— winding engine, Cornish
boiler, driving engine, etc. It is reported as well that
almost endless quantities of piping, tram rails, pipe
fittings, etc., have been sold, amounting to a sum
nearly double in value to the turnover for the same
period last year. The Corporation are erecting new
head offices at the corner of Hanbury-street and the
Boulder-road, Kalgoorlie. New show sheds, fitted
with large travelling cranes, are also in course of
construction.
The fitting shops are equipped with the latest
machine tools and electrically driven. The Corporation
carry large stocks, having in hand hundreds of heads
of battery stamps, piping of all sizes, and engines,
winders, pumping plants, air compressors, boilers, etc.
There is a branch office and depot on the Murchison at
Cue for the convenience of the firm’s numerous clients
in that part of the State’s gold-bearing territory.
COPPER AND GOLD MINES.
PHILLIPS RIVER G. & C. CO., LTD
The year 1908, although a dull one for copper market,
was full of work at the mines and the Ravensthorpe
smelting works. Development work at the Elverdton
group was pushed forward vigorously and the mine
deepened on the lode, which is maintaining its width
and values. The Mt. Desmond, too, will be a valuable
auxiliary to the Elverdton mine. The feature of the
year, however, was the completion of the railway from
Hopetoun (port to the field) to Ravensthorpe, which
is the centre for trade and office work of the mines.
While waiting for the advent of the locomotive, Mr.
M. Hochschild, managing director of the company,
who came out from London and relieved Mr. G. C.
Klug of the control at this end, busied himself in
adding to the smelting plant the machinery to con-
vert the matte into blister copper before shipment
to market. A concentrating plant to deal with the
silicious ores of the Mt. Cattlin was also ordered at
Gawler (S. Aust.) and is now being installed, this idea
being the outcome of tests made by Mr. Klug and
confirmatory tests made, at home on parcels of ore
from the mines. A fully trained man was appointed
from the United States to supervise the concentrator
and he is at his post. Mr. Richard, metallurgist, who
came from the Mt. Morgan mine (Q.), is in charge of
the smelting plant. A revised tariff to treat customs’
parcels from the mines of the field, or buy straight out,
was drawn up, and according to report this will be of
advantage to the small mines. Mr. C. Kaufman is still
chairman of the company.
MT. CATTLIN COPPER MINING CO., LTD.
At the Mt. Cattlin mine, the property of the Mt.
Cattlin Copper Mining Co., Ltd., the No. 4 level was
opened up and work at the No. 5 (500 ft.) level is well
forward. The main shaft was sunk to 513 ft. Tonnage
of ore and values were maintained at the levels de-
veloped and opened up in 1908. The outlook for this
company is a good one. Mr. S. Hochschild, owing to
the resignation of Mr. Goldstein, arrived from London
to take charge of the property. As will be observed,
this company, along with the Phillips River G. and C.
Co., Ltd., has been enterprising at Phillips River, for
in an official statement made to one of the Ministers
at Perth it was recorded that £273,000 had been
invested in the bringing of these enterprises to present
stages of production and operation of the equipments
which have been installed at Ravensthorpe and Elverd-
ton. It should therefore be patent to those engaged
in mining in this country that Mr. Kaufman’s com-
panies have faith in the mines and have backed that
confidence with capital.
At Cassidy’s Hill, on the Paringa lease (4E) a tribute
party is on a vein which is fairly rich, though small.
Haddon, who let the tribute, has decided to erect a
Huntingdon ball mill to treat small parcels from the
ground in the vicinity.
THE CONDITIONS OF MINING AT BOULDER
FROM A LABOR STANDPOINT.
By J. E. Dodd.*
In reviewing mining conditions, from a Labor
standpoint, in a short article of this kind, it is necessary
to condense one’s opinions into a limited space.
The last few years have not added much to the
comfort and well-being of the miner of Kalgoorlie and
Boulder. Mines are getting deeper, and, as a con-
sequence, ventilation is becoming poorer, the dust
is every day assuming a worse aspect, the contract
system is gradually reducing wages, whilst the law
relating to compensation for injuries is most un-
satisfactory. Further than this, the conditions under
which leases are manned by tributors are a disgrace
to the administration of the Mines Department.
Most of the big mines are down to the 2,000 ft. level,
the Gt. Boulder reaching 2,394 ft. I am not in a
position to say at what depth stoping is going on,
but when stopes are opened out at the 2,000 ft. level
the mines of Hannan’s Belt will not be desirable
places to work in, unless a more improved system of
ventilation prevails. There are more explosives used
in our mines per man than in any other mining camp
in the world. The larger the quantity of explosives
used, the greater the need for ventilation. Fumes and
smoke hang about for hours in a badly-ventilated
place, carrying the germs of all kinds of diseases with
them. Foul, vitiated air is responsible for half the
ills incidental to a miner’s life, and when he is com-
pelled to work at high pressure the trouble is ac-
centuated tenfold. I do not for one moment say
that the mines on the Golden Mile are any worse
ventilated than mines in other parts of the world,
but I do assert that the pressure under which men
have to labor is rendering it imperative that we
should not be content with the old method of ventila-
tion, if a more efficient system can be adopted which
would provide a supply of pure air to all parts of a
mine. Not only is the lot of the underground worker
likely to become worse from a health point of view,
but the surface employee, be he laborer or mechanic,
has a hard battle to retain his health amid the clouds
of dust which continually envelop the mines. Huge
dumps resembling miniature mountains —composed of
the finest dry sand—may be seen on the majority of
the mines. Let there be the slightest breath of wind,
and clouds of dust will immediately rise. Not only
is this a menace to health, but a risk to the costly
machinery of the mines.
Two companies appear to have grappled with the
problem —the Associated Gold Mines, Ltd., and the
Gt. Boulder Proprietary Gold Mines, Ltd. From at
least two of the others, great clouds of dust resembling
the darkest duststorms almost continually arise when
there is agitation in the air. Surface employees,
therefore, breathe an atmosphere laden with fumes
generated by a highly chemical treatment. In con-
sequence “ miner’s complaint ” will soon become as
common to them as to underground men. Co-
existent with the dust evil is another source of health
danger arising from the unrestricted distribution of
waste water through the Kalgoorlie Roads Board’s
and the Municipal Council’s territories. This water
has been found upon analysis to be highly charged
with deleterious matter. Why cannot the water be
used in abating the dust evil ? A spray of mineralised
water is the most effective layer of dust, and, to a
layman, the cost of installing a pump and sprinkler
would not appear to be great. It is only fair to state
that the mine managers who all live on the leases
have a very trying time from the dust, and to no
people would the abatement of the evil be a greater
blessing.
The contract system is a course of continual dis-
satisfaction to the majority of men on the belt. The
breaking of ore in stopes is usually let by the cubic
fathom. The methods of measuring are so complicated,
owing to stopes being filled with ore or sand, or by
reason of falls of ground, that in many instances

measurements are pure guesswork designed to give
wages, or about wages, to men who have exerted
every nerve to earn a little more. It is also a source
of danger to miners, inasmuch as risks are taken in
the effort to earn a living which otherwise would be
guarded against. Many of the alleged contracts are
simply piece work, by which the maximum amount
of work is secured at a remuneration a little above day
wages. The employer reserves the right of placing
any men in a party ; he may terminate a contract at
any time ; he may discharge any member of a party
without assigning any reason (should a man be absent
one shift without leave he may be discharged) ; and
the measurements of the mine surveyor are final.
Contract work underground has always tended to
reduce wages, and to increase the high rate of pressure
under which men work. There is in my opinion only
one efficient remedy —its abolition.
The law relating to compensation for injuries re-
ceived in the course of employment is far from satis-
factory. Much of the blame for this state of affairs
must be borne by the Minister for Mines. He un-
doubtedly showed anxiety to relieve employers from
all liabilities under the Mines Regulation Bill which
was introduced and carried by him through Parliament.
The publication of the files relating to the action of
the Minister in cabling to London mineowners, assuring
them of the absence of all cause of action for injuries
received by accident under his Bill, for ever dissolved
any sentiment of political good fellowship between
him and the trades unionists. The interpretation of
the doctrine of common employment by our judges
has to all purposes placed the worker outside the pale
of the common law. All employees from the manager
downward have been held to be in common employ-
ment with one another, and compensation is not
recoverable at common law for an injury received as
the result of the neglect of a fellow employee however
incompetent that worker may be. One of the worst
phases of this doctrine is that the small employer
(who personally superintends his own business) is
liable at common law, whilst the large company
(which employs a manager) is not. In the Mines’
Regulation Act of 1895, and in the Amending Act of
1899 certain provisions were embodied which removed,
to a certain extent, the disabilities of the miner in this
respect. The Workers’ Compensation Act of 1902
repealed those provisions, and although several cases
have been decided at common law, whereby the
worker was defeated each time, the _Minister not only
refused to re-enact them in the 1906 measure, but
took special pains to make abundantly clear that no
possible loophole should exist whereby an injured
worker could recover under that enactment. The
existing Workers’ Compensation Act suffers materially
from a worker’s standpoint, when compared with the
British, Queensland and New Zealand measures. The
restrictions are more numerous and the benefits less
in the West Australian law. • The tendency of the
conservatives appears to be in the direction of limiting
all damages to the Workers’ Compensation Act.
Trades unionists would not object to that so much,
provided the law was amended in accordance with
their wishes, or in accord with a desire to give the
worker a modicum of fair play.
The tribute regulations of the Mining Act, as
stated at the commencement of this article, are
useless to tributors, but are useful to holders of mining
leases, by allowing them to hold their ground by
paying half wages to the men employed. Many men,
at the present moment, are thoroughly prospecting
properties for holders, and receiving half wages only,
under the tribute regulations. Should they by good
luck strike anything rich, the scale of royalties is so
arranged that the tributor does not receive a great
deal from his tribute. In the opinion of the various
miners’ unions all men working by tribute, and fulfilling
the labor conditions of a lease, should be paid not
less than £3 per week. This would enable men to
live whilst opening up new ground. A great deal is
heard to-day of aid to prospectors, erection of State
batteries, etc., and there is no doubt the prospector
needs and deserves all the assistance the Government
can give. It appears to me, however, that the tributor
is equally as much a prospector as many of those who
search for new fields. Tributors saved the Westralia
mine at Bonnievale, they have opened up Chaffers,
Hannan’s Reward, North Kalgurli, Kalgoorlie Amal-
gamated, Croesus, Mt. Charlotte, Boulder No. 1, part
of the Lake View Consols, Burbanks, and many other
mines. In some instances they have done well ; in
most cases only part wages have been earned. The
Minister for Mines has an opportunity to help this
deserving class of prospector by amending the regula-
tions governing their employment on leases.
I cannot conclude this article without drawing
attention to the great need of the establishment of a
“ Worn Out Miners’ Fund.” The Minister for Mines
has been approached several times and he has promised
to give the question his earnest consideration. Up
to the present, however, has anything been done ?
In the meantime “ miners’ complaint ” has been
rapidly increasing—men at the age of 45 have to
leave mining in search of more congenial employment,
and many of them cannot work at all, and their
existence has become merely a living death. It would
require the space of a page to picture the horrors of
this dread disease, and it is not my mission to do that.
Rather is it to draw attention to the urgent necessity
of something being done to alleviate the distress caused
by its ravages. The Kalgoorlie and Boulder mines
have earned millions of money in dividends, and
have made many men wealthy. Surely it is a reason-
able request to ask, that —as in the case of the late
Mr. J. B. Watson, of Bendigo —a little of that wealth
might be devoted to the inauguration of a fund or
trust which would provide for the maintenance of
those who have lost their health in creating this great
wealth ; or, is it too much to expect the Government
of a country —which has reaped such enormous ad-
vantages from the goldfields —to subsidise any money
so raised ? If this were done an equal amount might
be obtained from local sources towards the principal
of the fund which would at least place the poor un-
fortunates beyond the reach of actual want and prove
something more than a pittance or an old age pension.

NOTES ON THE MINING LAWS OF WESTERN
AUSTRALIA.
By A. C. Veatch.’"
Introduction.
The mining laws of the several Australian States
and New Zealand rest on the same general principles.
The law of Western Australia represents one of the
most carefully matured and well balanced enactments
and may well serve to give a general idea of the details
of the several mining laws of the Australasian States.
Besides differences in rental charges and terms of leases
certain distinctions may be specially mentioned. No
other State except South Australia has carried the
doctrine of mining on private property for the un-
reserved minerals to the extent it has been carried in
Western Australia. In Tasmania the law permits the
expression of the development conditions in money
per acre per year instead of men per acre per year
as is generally required.
The present mining law of Western Australia, with
the exception of a special clause in the Mining on
Private Property Act of 1898, which still remains un-
repealed, the Sluicing and Dredging for Gold Act of
1899, and certain Mines Regulation Acts, is contained
in the Mining Act of 1904 and the regulations there-
under.
The Mining Act of 1904 is, in effect, the codification
and amplification of the preceding mining law and
practice and was passed just after the boom days of
the great Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie finds. An am-
ending bill, to be known as the Mines Amendment
Act of 1907, is now being prepared by the Minister
of Mines. The proposed amendment, however, if
passed, will not in any way affect the fundamental
provisions of the Mining Act of 1904, which indicates
that after three years’ trial the law here discussed
has as a whole been found quite satisfactory. Indeed,
the leasing principle, which is to Americans the most
important feature of this law, receives the hearty
endorsement of the piining men of Western Australia.
During a recent visit to the great gold mining camp
of Kalgoorlie I received from the principal mining men,
including the President and Secretary of the Chamber
of Mines of Western Australia, a most united and
emphatic opinion that mining development is un-
doubtedly promoted more by a leasehold than by
a freehold tenure.
The proposed amending bill is, for the most part,
concerned with the incorporation in the body of the
law of certain regulations which have been found
effective and with making several changes in details
which are described below. A new section is added
which has for its object the prevention of gold stealing
by employees in the mines and further provisions are
made for preventing mining swindles.
Among the factors which make these laws important
for comparison with the statutes of other countries are :
(1) In Western Australia the population is largely made
up of those interested in mining. (2) Western Australia
is a country of great mineral wealth, having produced
in each of the last eight years between 1,500,000 and
2,000,000 oz. of fine gold or several times that pro-
duced by Alaska, and has for the same period had
a greater total annual mineral production than any
of the other Australian States or New Zealand, except
New "'South Wales, which surpassed it in 1906 and
1907. (3) It contains enormous areas yet undeveloped,
the State having an area of almost a million square
miles, —more than the combined areas of California,
Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,
Wyoming, and Montana —and a total population of
less than one-twentieth of that of all these states, or
less than that of the single State of Utah. (4) It is
a country in which mineral lands were sold outright
and its mineral laws have therefore been evolved
from a basis similar to that which now is, and for
many years past has been, commonly accepted as
the rule and practice in the United States. (5) The
* Geologist U.S. Geological Survey, Washington. He visited Western Aus-
desire of the Government to promote and encourage
the development of its mineral wealth in every way
is emphatically shown by the policy of Government aid.
This policy in the past has involved enormous ex-
penditure in connection with water supplies for the
mining districts ; the Coolgardie Water System alone
(built to pump 5,000,000 gal. a day, 351 miles to an
elevation 1,200 ft. above the supply point) involved
an expenditure on the part of the Government of
over $18,000,000.
The policy of the Government in this regard is
strikingly shown in the Mining Development Act of
1902, which provides for ; {a) Government loans at
5 per cent, to aid in development work. ( b) Govern-
ment loans to miners to aid in prospecting, (c) The
erection of public crushing, ore dressing, cyaniding
and smelting works and the subsidising of persons or
companies that will erect such works for testing or
treating ores for the public. ( d) The conduct of ex-
ploratory boring operations for water and minerals
either entirely at the cost of the Government or in
connection with individuals, (e) The direct expendi-
ture or the loan of money for constructing drainage
tunnels, sinking shafts to great depths and trans-
porting miners to undeveloped regions.
The provision for Government loans to aid miners
in prospecting is not regarded by the Mines Department
as having yielded entirely satisfactory results. Loans
are now made to working miners only on the security
of machinery. The money invested in public batteries
and exploratory boring is, however, believed to have
been well spent.
The Mining Act of 1904 must, therefore, be regarded
not as a theoretical attempt of political economists
but as the matured law of a State which has had
large practical experience in mining matters, in which,
in fact, mining is the principal industry, and in which
vast areas await settlement and development —a
State which has, moreover, in many ways conclusively
demonstrated its desire to permit and encourage the
development and settlement of its territory.
Underlying Principles.
The Western Australian Mining Law of 1904 rests
on two rather closely related and interlocking prin-
ciples ; (1) That land shall be utilized for that purpose
for which it is most valuable ; and (2) That no man
may hold any mineral rights without development,
without, in fact, so far as can be reasonably demanded
the constant employment of labor and expenditure
of capital.
While encouraging and protecting individual de-
velopment, there is no indication of the idea that each
person who wants it is entitled to a small portion of
the public domain, just so much and no more, such
as is included in the coal land law of the United
States, nor does it endeavor to curb monopoly, if indeed
such was ever the intent of the United States coal
land law, in any such clumsy fashion. There is
no limit, other than that which may be fixed at the
discretion of the administrating officers to the amount
of land any person or-persons may hold, provided they
develop it, the provision that no mineral rights can
be held without constant development being con-
sidered a sufficient guarantee that capital will be
expended and the country’s prosperity thereby pro-
moted ; and as regards injuirous monopoly or com-
bination the executive officers’ discretionary power to
refuse to issue a lease, the requirement of the executive
officers’ approval to all transfers, mortgages and the
like, and the fact that all leases will some day expire
give sufficient guarantee or protection.
This law in respect to the ownership of minerals by
the Government reasserts the principle that “ gold,
silver, and other precious metals on or below the
surface of all land in Western Australia ” whether
alienated or not, and if alienated, whensoever alienated,
are the property of the Government, and that all other
minerals which were not alienated in fee simple before
January 1, 1899, are the property of the Government.
These lands in effect belong absolutely to the local
Government, and no revenue derived from them is
paid to England or to the Crown. This assertion of
47

the Government rights to the precious metals is of
interest to Americans because of the still legally
undecided point whether the right to all gold and
silver mines is not vested by common law in the
Government in the United States.
In accordance with the doctrine that all land must
be utilized for that for which it is most valuable, this
law provides: (1) That after January, 1899, all
minerals shall be reserved to the Government in lands
alienated in any way. (2) That where minerals are
found in lands where the surface rights have been
alienated the Government may either ( a ) resume the
land, paying the owner its value other than for the
minerals contained or ( b) permit mining provided
the surface owner is indemnified for any damage
resulting from such operations. (3) That as regards
unreserved minerals in lands that were alienated
before January 1, 1899, the Government may permit
mining therefore under certain conditions.
In order to secure the entire enforcement of the
doctrine that no man may hold any mineral rights
without development, this law provides, in effect, that
none of the minerals to which the Government has
title shall be sold, but the Government may authorise
the working of the mineral deposits by those willing
to develop them continuously.
The enforcement of this requirement for continuous
development is incompatible with the state of freehold.
This is but the logical carrying out of the fundamental
principle of American mining law —the possessory
right. In the early history of mining in the United
States, in the absence of any general law, the local
mining customs and regulations recognised the right
of a man to a mining claim so long as he worked it.
If he abandoned his claim any other person could
assert his rights thereto. This principle in a consider-
ably distorted form has been incorporated in that
makeshift composition, the Mining Law of the United
States, in which the possessory right, instead of being
based on continuous development, is allowed to rest
on “ annual assessment work ” of the most meagre
description, necessitating in practice only a few days’
work a year, though the expenditure is supposed to
amount to $lOO per annum, and requiring this only
until a total expenditure of $5OO has been made,
when freehold title is given on payment of a nominal
price per acre.
The Western Australian Mining Law for some time
previous to 1904 held in respect to minerals on public
lands and reserved minerals on private land that only
those who would continuously develop could hold a
mining tenement of any description ; the law of 1904
goes a step further by applying this doctrine to all
the lands in the State. It now declares, as regards
private lands, where the title to certain minerals
under some pervious grant or law is vested in the
owner of the surface, that if the owner will not work
the minerals the Government will permit anyone who
desires to work them to do so, will assess and collect
rent or royalty or both and pay the proceeds to the
owner of the fee simple less 10 per cent, for admini-
strative expenses.
Mining Tenements.
The various kinds of mining tenements which are
now possible in Western Australia are : 1. Claims ; 2.
Prospecting areas ; 3. Mining leases ; (a) for gold ;
(b) for minerals other than gold or coal ; (c) for coal ;
(1 d ) for minerals on private lands ; 4. Holdings in
connection with mining : [a) residence and building
areas ; ( b ) machinery, tailings and washing areas ;
(c) market garden areas ; 5. Water rights ; 6. Miner’s
homestead leases ; 7. Reward claims and leases.
Claims. —The miner’s claim, like the miner’s claim
under the United States law, may be taken up on any
public land not otherwise appropriated or reserved.
It is essentially the old possessory right mining claim
which may be held only on the condition of continuous
development ; the Government, however, in this case
guarantees possession by registering the claim and
goes further in the protection of the miner by giving
the executive officers power to relieve, for limited
periods, the holder of a claim from the required de-
velopment work, for any good and sufficient reason.
The condition of continuous development which is
interpreted to mean the work of one man every
working day in the year for each two men’s ground
contained in a lode claim until payable and for each
one man’s ground in all other cases, is a much more
exacting requirement than the “ $lOO assessment
work ” required each year by the United States law.
In practice this would mean, if applied to the United
States, that the continuous work of eight men (because
eight men’s ground is contained therein) would be
required to hold a 160-acre placer petroleum claim,
or an expenditure, estimating labor at only $2 per day
(in some of the States the value of a day’s assessment
work has been fixed by law at $4), or between $4,000
and $5,000 per year. A claim can, moreover, be held
only by the holder of a miner’s right, which may be
obtained at a cost of ss. and is good for one year,,
but is indefinitely renewable at that same cost per
year.
As originally drafted this law contained a specific
provision that only one claim could be held for each
miner’s right (any person or company can obtain any
number of miner’s rights) and so involved an automatic
declaration at the end of each year of the condition
of each claim. If the miner desired to hold a claim
he would take out a new miner’s right in respect
thereto ; if not, the claim lapsed and the records
clearly showed that it had lapsed. This specific pro-
vision was, however, opposed in Parliament by the
Labor members and was omitted, but the act as
passed contains several clauses which would permit
the enforcement of this sort of a provision by regula-
tions. The Mines Department, however, has not
availed itself of the powers conferred by these clauses.
In order to clear the matter up, provision for only one
claim for one miner’s right is to be incorporated in
the Amending Act now being prepared.
Claims must be rectangular except where existing
boundaries interfere. The areas considered one man’s
ground in the different kinds of ordinary alluvial
claims are ; For gold, silver and platinum, 25 by 100
yards ; for non-metallic minerals, 125 by 100 yards ;
for precious stones, 50 by 50 yards. One man’s ground
in the case of lode claims may be of the following
dimensions : Gold, silver and platinum, 20 by 130
yards ; all other metallic minerals, 50 by 130 yards ;
non-metallic minerals, 75 by 130 yards ; precious stones
50 by 130 yards. Provision is made for alluvial claims
called “ Extended alluvial claims ” and for “ river
claims,” two to three times the size of ordinary alluvial
claims, where unusual conditions are encountered.
Any number of men, not exceeding 10, may take up
the proportionate multiple of one man’s ground.
By a supplementary regulation issued July 25, 1905,
ground which has been worked and abandoned, or
is suitable only for dredging, may, with the consent
of the Warden, be taken up as dredging claims. A
single dredging claim may not exceed 300 acres, but
a union of claims under certain conditions is permitted.
Claims must ordinarily be not less than 15 chains in
width, but the only condition as to river claims is
that they shall not exceed 6 miles in length. In a
dredging claim one man must be employed for every
100 acres, or machinery whose value is not less than
£l,OOO per 100 acres must be kept constantly in
operation and in no case shall the total value of the
machinery be less than £3,000. This provision re-
garding dredging is to be incorporated in the proposed
Amending Act under a special clause providing for
dredging leases. The only changes made are that
the area allowed is 320 instead of 300 acres and a
rental of 2s. 6d. per acre per year is to be charged.
The existing dredging enactment (the Sluicing and
Dredging Act of 1899) referred to below is to be
repealed.
Neither claim nor any other form of mineral tene-
ments gives any extra lateral rights in Australia in
the case of lode deposits, and the numerous expensive
law suits which have hindered the development of the
West have thus been avoided.
There is no provision compelling the holder of a
claim to take out a lease in case he developes a paying

mine, but in practice it is found that under such
conditions most miners prefer to convert their claims
into leases. For minerals other than coal the rent is
greater per acre under a lease than the annual cost of
a miner’s right per acre of claim, even where only one
claim is taken out, but the labor requirements on a
lease are relatively much less than on a claim, and
hence in case of misfortune it offers a more secure
tenure. Moreover, the Government may at any time
by published notice exempt from further occupation
by the holder of a miner’s right any specified portion
of the Government lands, in which case the holder of
the claim is entitled to damages only for the values of
any substantial buildings he may have erected on the
claim. Mr. H. S. King, the Under-Secretary for Mines,
states : “ Though this power is given I know no case
in which it has been exercised.” It is opposed to
the general tone of the legislation, and it is doubtful
if it would ever be enforced. One the whole, the
preference for a lease rather than a claim seems to
be more imaginary than real. The opportunities of
getting exemption for cause are just as good in a
claim as in a lease, the rent is much less, and there
is no limit to the period of tenure so long as the con-
ditions are complied with. While under this legislation
it is possible to take out coal claims there is no ad-
vantage in doing so in projects involving extensive
development and in practice, coal operators will take
out either prospecting areas or leases.
Such a system of mining claims largely prevents the
staking out and holding of large areas, such as is now
possible in the United States, by one or more local
speculators who have no intention of developing, but
who stake out and hold these claims only for the
purpose of levying tribute on the bona fide developer.
As these speculators can in the United States hold
the claims for a year without any expenditure of
capital, the practice must be regarded as permitting
a serious retardation of development. It certainly is
not in line with a Government policy which has for
its object the encouragement of actual development
and settlement.
Prospecting Areas. —The prospecting area seems to
have been particularly designed to meet the needs of
the prospector for coal and oil, for which the mining
claim is in no wise suited. The holder of a miner’s
right may, with the approval of the Warden, acquire
exclusive right to prospect for coal or oil over an area
not exceeding 3,000 acres for 12 months from date of
registration of his area. This period may be extended
six months but no longer. The holder of a prospecting
area may not remove any mineral from the area,
except samples not exceeding 501 b., without the
consent of the Warden or Mining Registrar. On
discovery of mineral in paying quantities, he can
obtain, according to circumstances, either an ordinary
or a reward lease.
As applied to gold and minerals other than coal the
prospecting area offers a tenement intermediate be-
tween a claim and a lease. It permits an area varying
from 18 to 48 acres, according to circumstances, and
as a rule somewhat smaller than a lease but very
much larger than a claim, to be held for no more
labor requirements than a claim and at very much
less cost than a lease, but the holder has no right to
mine and sell minerals as on a claim or lease and his
rights expire absolutely in 18 months. As a means
of holding a piece of land until by careful exploration
an operator can determine whether he desires a lease,
this tenement, however, offers several decided ad-
vantages and has a very definite place in the scheme
of mining development.
Mining Leases. —No miner’s right is required in
taking out a lease, and this form of tenement may
therefore be acquired without prospecting, but it is
specially provided that no land held as a claim can be
included in a lease without the claimant’s consent.
The maximum term for mining leases for all substances
is 21 years, but provision is made for renewals for
further periods of the same length “ subject to the
provisions of the acts and regulations in force at the
time of such renewal.” The area allowed in any lease
varies according to the substance and conditions, but
the dimensions must be such that the length shall not
exceed twice the width except in the gold dredging
leases provided for by the Dredging Act of 1899.
MAXIMUM AREAS WHICH MAY BE COVERED BY A
SINGLE LEASE.
Acres.
* Under the proposed legislation, silver, platinum, and precious
stones are classed with gold and dealt with under the provisions
which now apply to gold alone.
f This was a special enactment (The Sluicing and Dredging
Act of 1899) passed under the supposition that certain alkali
lagoons and swamps in the goldfields would prove dredging
propositions. There has been no development under this Act
and in the proposed amendment it is to be repealed and pro-
visions similar to those now in the regulation regarding dredging
claims enacted therefor. The proposed rental charge is 2s. 6d.
per acre per annum and the area of a single lease 320 acres.
\ The conditions which now apply to all minerals except
gold and coal are under the proposed act made to apply to
tin, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, bismuth, arsenic, antimony,
nickel, cobalt, wolfram, scheelite, chromite, molybdenite, tan-
talite, stibiotantalite, monazite, bauxite, kaolin, asbestos, mica.
minerals containings earths used in the manufacture of in-
candescent light mantles, minerals containing radium, phosphor-
ite, gypsum, marble, ornamental stone, roofing slate, infusorial
earth, graphite, iron pyrites. In this class amalgamation up
to 192 acres is to be permitted.
§ Under the amending act the following minerals are classed
with coal : carbonaceous shale, oil shale, petroleum, iron and
manganese ores, building stone, ironstone, clay, fireclay, and
common salt. But provision is made for a rent of 2s. 6d. in
all cases except for coal, and in substances other than coal the
maximum amalgamation permitted is to be 1,280 acres. Pros-
pecting for minerals of the first two classes in the land covered
by leases of this class are to be permitted under certain con-
ditions.
Leases, the property of the same lessee, may be
amalgamated under certain conditions. As to minerals
other than coal the Minister may in general permit
amalgamation up to 96 acres, but in special cases he
may permit amalgamation to any extent he may deem
necessary for the proper working of a reef or lode
to a depth of 3,000 ft. ; such exceptional amalgamation
is, however, subject to any conditions which the
Minister may from time to time impose and is also
subject to such restrictions of areas as he may decide
is advisable if subsequent development shows that
the separate working of any lease included in the
amalgamation is desirable. The Minister may likewise
allow the amalgamation of coal leases provided the
aggregate does not exceed 2,560 acres when the seam
is of ordinary depth and 5,120 acres when the seam is
at a depth of over I,oooft. Amalgamation permits
the satisfaction of the labor conditions for a group of
adjacent leases at one point and is hence subject to
cancellation on the transfer, surrender or forfeiture
of any lease included in the amalgamation.
The rent and royalty assessed are as follows : In
ordinary gold leases, ss. or £1 per acre per year for
the first year, as may be determined by the Governor,
and £1 per acre per year thereafter ; i,n a gold dredging
lease, 6d. per acre per year and a royalty of is. per
ounce of gold won ; in an ordinary mineral lease, ss.
per acre per year, and in mineral lease of the second
character, 2s. to 55., as may be determined ; in an
ordinary coal lease 6d. per acre per year and a royalty
on every ton of coal raised of 3d. for the first 10 years
and 6d. thereafter ; in a reward coal lease at 6d.
per acre per year, no royalty for the first 10 years and
then a royalty of id. per ton. There is no limit
expressly fixed to the number of leases any person or
company can hold, but the law provides that the
Governor may refuse to issue any leases and that

no lease shall be transferred, sublet, mortgaged, en-
cumbered, or otherwise dealt with without the written
approval of the Warden or Minister.
Under the conditions of continuous development it
is required that a lease granted for coal or oil shall
be worked every working day by not less than one
man for every 60 acres or fraction thereof for the first
12 months, two men for every 60 acres for the second
12 months, and three men for every 60 acres thereafter ;
gold leases and mineral leases in which double area is
allowed must be worked by not less than two men
for every 12 acres thereafter. Ordinary gold and
mineral leases must be worked by one man for every
six acres after the first 12 months. Provision is made,
however, for exemption from labor conditions if the
holder has made reasonable efforts to work and
develop the mine and is prevented from doing so by
conditions beyond his control. Exemption may also
be demanded as a right for certain periods by the
expenditure of a given amount of capital in a certain
length of time. The executive officers are in this
respect given very wide discretionary powers and are
able fully to protect any bona fide developer from loss
through forfeiture due to no real fault of his own.
In some of the earlier Australian enactments in which
no provision was made for exemption from the de-
velopment conditions, the labor covenant was used by
labor organizations as a lever to accomplish their ends.
Specific provision for exemption in case of general
strikes is made in the last enactment. It also provides
for exemption for six months as a right on the ex-
penditure of £1,500 and in the same direction of
rendering the tenure more secure, permits the Warden
in cases of breach of labor covenants either to re-
commend forfeiture or to impose a fine not exceeding
£5OO from which the complainant may be compensated
for expenses and loss of time. In the proposed mining
bill a new and very far-reaching cause for exemption
is proposed in the clause which allows exemption when
“ owing to existing conditions it is impossible to
dispose of the product of the leasehold to a profit.”
The Chamber of Mines of Western Australia has for
several years strongly recommended, and in this
recommendation they have the concurrence of the
present Minister for Mines and the Mines Department,
that the condition of continuous development be
expressed in money instead of men. They feel that
while they have no complaint to make on the administ-
ration of the law thus far and that while under existing
law the executive officers have sufficient discretionary
power to enable them fully to protect the bona fide
developer, there is always the danger that the labor
party, which is now greatly in the minority, may
become more powerful, and of the country having a
labor minister for mines who might be arbitrary and
unreasonable in the granting of labor exemption.
This change, it is thought, would render the tenure
more secure, without in any way affecting the under-
lying principle that all mining tenure must rest on
development.
Leases authorising the removal of any of the reserved
minerals on or under private lands and mining claims
to any portion of such lands may be obtained at the
discretion of the Minister of Mines and subject to the
payment of compensation for damages to the owner
and occupier of the surface, the amount or amounts
to be fixed by agreement, or, if the parties can not
agree, by the Warden. The area, rent, and royalty
of such leases are the same as those on the public
domain. If the Government desires it may resume
any such private lands on payment of fair compensa-
tion, no allowance to be made for the value of the
reserved minerals. When land is resumed in this
manner the rent and royalty are not subject to the
general provisions of the law but may be fixed at
will by the Governor.
In respect to the unreserved minerals on alienated
lands, this law, carrying out the doctrine that all
lands should be utilized for that for which it is most
valuable and that no one can hold mineral rights
to the exclusion of another without development,
declares that any person may petition that such land
be declared open to mineral development. If on
investigation the Government decides that there is a
reasonable probability that the land contains minerals
in paying quantities, the Minister may, in his discretion,
by the publication of a formal notice, declare that
at the expiration of six months from the date of such
notice the land specified will be considered mineral
land. If within this six months’ period the owner
registers with the Department a declaration that he
desires exclusive right to mine on such land or any
portion thereof, the area indicated by the owner will
be surveyed into lease areas of the regulation size, and
the owner shall, so far as development is concerned,
be held to hold the land subject to a mineral lease or
leases and it shall be obligatory for such registered
owner to work the land in accordance with the re-
quirements of the mineral acts and regulations, but no
rent or royalty shall be payable. If this owner does
not within the six months’ period register his exclusive
right to mine on the area, the Government proceeds
to lease the same in the usual manner, but during the
currency of the lease pays all rent and royalty to
the owner less 10 per cent. Thus while giving the
owner a preference right in respect to mining on his
own property it effectually prevents him from hindering
the general development of the region.
Holdings in connection with Mining. —In a mining
region certain tenements are required which do not
necessitate anything more than surface rights. The
proper conservation of the interests of all parties
concerned demands that special provisions be made
for such holdings, which will at the same time guarantee
the occupier thereof against damage to his improve-
ments and yet will not allow such holdings to interfere
with the removal of minerals, on which the prosperity
of the whole settlement ultimately depends. The
holder of a miner’s right is therefore authorized to
take up the following : A residence area, not exceeding
\ acre ; a business area, not exceeding one acre ; a
market garden area, not exceeding five acres ; a machi-
nery area for erecting machinery for extracting gold
or minerals, not exceeding five acres ; a washing area,
for washing any earth containing gold or minerals, not
exceeding five acres ; a tailings area, for stocking and
treating tailings, not exceeding five acres. For all
these, except the market garden area, for which the
rent is ss. per acre per year, a rental of £1 per acre
per year is charged. These areas are registered and
may be held so long as they are actually used for the
purpose for which they are registered. Any portion
of such holding may be granted as a lease or claim,
but only subject to payment of compensation for all
damages. In the proposed legislation all these holdings
are treated as leases for a period of 21 years instead
of registered holdings under a miner’s right. The
rentals range from to £5 per acre per year. A
new form of lease, “ the tramway lease,” is added.
Water Rights. —In a semi-arid region such as that
containing the most important of the Western Aus-
tralian mineral fields the matter of water supply
largely controls the possibility of development and the
mineral law and regulations practically provide for
Government control of this subject. In the first place,
practically all permanent water is reserved by the
Government. Water may be obtained (except from
one of the public or private systems) only by the
holder of a water right. Water rights are divided into
(1) stream water rights : (2) lagoon, lake, spring or
swamp water rights ; (3) watershed or stormwater
rights ; (4) dam, tank or reservoir water rights ; (5)
subterranean water rights ; (6) race or pipe track
water rights. In the first two cases the amount of
water that can be used is limited. Provision is made
in all cases for the sale of water by the holder of a
water right but the Minister reserves the right to fix
prices. For a stream water right there is no rental;
for a watershed water right the rental is 6d. per acre
per year of the area of the watershed ; for a dam,
tank, or subterranean water right the rental is £1
per acre per year ; for a lagoon, lake, swamp or spring
water right, the rental is 6d. per 1,000 gallons.
Miners’ Homestead Leases. —The Governor by pro-
clamation may create gold or mineral fields with such
boundaries as he may decide, may alter the boundaries

off such fields, or may abolish the fields entirely. No
land in any such gold or mineral field may be disposed
of under the general land laws except with the consent
of the Minister of Mines. The provision in the mining
law for miners’ homestead leases seems to indicate
that in a gold or mineral field the ordinary homestead
laws are generally not operative, for it provides for a
kind of tenure which is very similar to the conditional
homestead purchase, and which is evidently intended
as a substitute for it. The holder of a miners’ home-
stead lease, however, acquires no title to the soil,
although after paying rent for 20 years he acquires
the right to hold the same indefinitely at a rental of
is. per year for the whole area, if the rental is demanded.
This form of tenure is evidently intended to provide
for the acquisition of larger areas than are authorised
for the holdings above described.
Any holder of a miners’ right (either an individual
or a company) may take up any number of homestead
leases provided that the aggregate area taken up in
any goldfield shall not exceed 20 acres, if the land is
within two miles of the nearest boundary of any
town site and 500 acres if beyond that distance. The
rent for the first 20 years is 2s. per acre per year if
the area is less than 20 acres, and 6d. per acre per
year if the area exceeds 20 acres. The lessee must
within three years from the date of lease fence the
whole of the land and within five years make improve-
ments to the value of 10s. per acre. Such a homestead
is, however, open to mineral lease or claim and is in
part or whole subject to resumption on six months’
notice, but in any of these cases the holder of the
homestead lease is compensated for the improvements
effected.
Reward Areas and Leases. —As regards coal, the law
provides that the discoverer of payable coal more than
16 miles from the nearest known payable coal or at
a depth exceeding 600 ft. shall be entitled to a reward
lease of 640 acres free of royalty for 10 years, after
which the royalty shall be but id. per ton. In regard
to the other mineral discoveries there is a general
provision that the Minister may grant reward areas
by way of lease or otherwise to the discoverer of
minerals. Under this provision the discoverer is at
present allowed by the regulations either to take a
reward claim, which varies in area from 1 to 16 acres
according to the minerals found and the distance
of the discovery from other mines, or to take a reward
lease, which is of the same size as an ordinary lease,
but in which the rent is omitted for a period not
exceeding five years, the period varying according
to the distance of discovery from other mines.
Administrative and Judicial System.
The administration of the provisions of the mineral
law is vested in a Minister, under whom are Wardens
for each gold or mineral field, Mining Registrars,
Mining Surveyors, Inspectors, Geologists, and such
other officers as the Governor may deem necessary.
The Wardens are both executive and judicial officers
and command salaries of from $2,600 to $4,200 per
year and quarters. It is this judicial portion of this
system that is of the greatest interest to Americans
because of the evident expedition which is possible
thereunder. The Warden’s court has in effect juris-
diction over all matters relating to mining tenements
and mining ; its proceedings are similar to the local
courts and its judgments enforced in a like manner ;
it may order mines or minerals seized by bailiff or
other officer until further order of court; it may inspect
any mine or mining tenement and “ may take judicial
notice of anything observed ” or it may order such
inspection, may issue injunctions, may procure wit-
nesses by means of subpoena, may punish for contempt
by fine or imprisonment, may order sale under writ
of execution, etc. Appeals, from the decisions of the
Warden’s court lie to the Supreme Court, but no appeal
is permitted : (1) If the parties agree that the Warden’s
decision shall be final. (2) If the value of the matter
or interest in dispute does not exceed £2OO, except
by permission of the Supreme Court or a Judge. (3)
From any decision, order, or recommendation of the
Warden upon any application for a mining tenement,
the forfeiture thereof, or exemption from labor or
other conditions. (Except to the Minister of Mines
in case the final decision rests with him, as it usually
does.)
This gives ample and effective judicial powers to
the officers who are charged with administration of
the law and who are on the ground. Under the
American system a limited amount of judicial power
is vested in the Land Office under the Secretary of the
Interior in respect to lands so long as they remain
in the hands of the United States, but this is very
different from the judicial powers here vested in the
officers of the Department of Mines. The intricate
relation of State and Nation, of state courts and
federal courts, of course, greatly complicate the situa-
tion in this respect in the United States, but it must
be conceded that the effective and rapid judicial ad-
ministration of any extensive mineral leasing system
in the United States is certainly not one of the least
matters deserving earnest consideration in connection
with any adequate mineral land legislation
Conclusion.
The Western Australian mining law is, in short, a
wonderfully symmetrical and carefully balanced enact-
ment ; and while one may not regard it as applicable
in all its features to Amerfcan conditions, it contains
many suggestive provisions, all of which merit careful
consideration. They can not in any way be considered
the idle visions of the theorist, but are the mature
enactments of a legislature whose members are entirely
chosen by voters of a great democratic mining State
—a State which ranks among the great mining states
of the World, and which has, as recently as 1904,
reorganised and revised its mining laws to meet the
practical workaday conditions of that region.
