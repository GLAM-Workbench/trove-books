1. Expirations in South Australia. By Messrs. Babbage, Warburton,
fi fy 1 ' Stuart, and others.
Communicated by the Eight Hon. Sir E. Bulwer Lytton, Bart., Her Majesty?s
Secretary for the Colonies.
The papers submitted to the Society contain the results of numerous
explorations made in Southern Australia during the season of 1858.
In order to obtain a general idea of their extent, it will be sufficient
to refer to a map inserted at page 194 in Yol. 11. of the Proceedings,
which contains all that had been discovered up to the close of the
VOL. hi. o


preceding year. Not only has the large vacant space corresponding
to the Avestern and northern portions of that map been traversed in
several directions, but the path of one explorer, Mr. Stuart, has
attained even to about lat. 30� 30', long. 137� 30', according to his
careful dead reckoning. The horse-shoe bed hitherto ascribed to
Lake Torrens, has now given place to a representation of a chain
of lakes, between two of which a well-grassed and well-watered
country has been found to exist: a communication has been made
across it by Major Warburton from the neighbourhood of Mount
Serle to the district lying to the north-west of the lakes. But the
most important discovery is that of Mr. Stuart, who traced a line of
water parting from the division between the above-mentioned lakes,
extending as far as he was able to follow it in a north-westerly direc-
tion, and having its slopes towards the interior of the continent, of a far
more grassy and more promising character than those to the seaward.
A large expedition had been started under the charge of Mr.
Babbage at a great expense to the colony, but it was hampered by
its own weight, and did not attain any very considerable distance,
although the country it passed over was thoroughly examined,
both to the right and to the left of the line of route, and carefully
mapped by its leader. The minor explorations of Mr. Barry to the
N.N.W. of Mount Serle, of Corporal Burtt to the W.N.W. of the
same place, and of police-trooper Geharty to the N. and N.W. of
Streaky Bay, have helped in a considerable degree to fill up the
space within the curve of Lake Torrens, or rather of the chain of
lakes by which its course is now represented.
The whole of the country that has been explored affords numerous
districts capable of supporting sheep. Its character is thus described
by Major Warburton at the close of his numerous journeys, during
which he traversed the principal part:?
? Most of the country I have visited seems admirably adapted for
pastoral occupation. It is one that would be greatly improved by
being stocked, the surface would become firmer, and the thin coating
of small stones would be just sufficient to prevent rapid evaporation,
but not to interfere with the growth of grass, which would soon
spring up under sheep. There is no scrub. I saw very few wild
dogs, no kangaroos, and no natives. Sheep might be run in flocks
of several thousands; and I believe that for every single sheep the
country could carry the first year, three might be put upon it the
third season. The ground is high, would be dry under foot when
made firmei by the treading of sheep, and it is clean for the wool.
A little rain would leave plenty of temporary surface water. The
water-holes are generally good, and would last all the year if that


country were blessed with periodical rain; but it is doubtful whether
it is so or not. Then there is an abundailt and sure supply of water
from the springs. The country generally is very deficient in
useful timber, but the reeds and mud would make good huts.?
The following extract of a despatch from Governor Sir E. G. Mac-
donnell to Sir E. B. Lytton shows in a prominent manner the
remarkable extent of the discoveries of Mr. Stuart:?
? Unfortunately for Mr. Babbage it became more than ever evident
that exploration should precede the mapping of a country, when a
private explorer, Mr, John Macdougall Stuart, returned only in Sep-
tember from a very extensive and successful exploring expedition,
conducted entirely at the expense of private parties. Mr. Stuart,
who had been with Captain Sturt as draughtsman in his second
great expedition, and who was accompanied by only one white com-
panion and a black?with five horses, and a scanty supply of pro-
visions, but with a moral courage and hardihood of the highest
description ?managed literally to describe an immense circle round
the contracted movements of Mr. Babbage and his party; having
penetrated in a straight line nearly 240 miles to the north-west of
Mr. Babbage?s camp at the Elizabeth, and having traversed in
various routes nearly four degrees of longitude west, and three of
latitude north of that position.
These points will be more evident to you on examining a map
which I have caused to be compiled for your information, and which
not merely gives Mr. Stuart?s track as in the chart attached to the
enclosed Council paper, but also shows the position of Mr. Babbage?s
camp, together with the general aspect of the country in the vicinity
of Lake Gairdner, as laid down by Major Warburton, Mr. Babbage,
and others. You will thus see at a glance the great extent of Mr.
Stuart?s discoveries, and the importance of their character, as it
seems probable that at least from 12,000 to 18,000 square miles of
country, available hereafter for pastoral purposes, have been opened
by Mr. Stuart?s exertions ; and I am glad to say the House of
Assembly have presented an address to me, requesting me to take
the necessary steps for giving Mr. Stuart a fourteen years? lease of
1500 square miles of the new country, to be rent free for the first
seven years.
? I would suggest that the labours and discoveries of Mr. Stuart
might with propriety be brought under notice of the Eoyal Geogra-
phical Society, on account of the extreme interest attaching to some
of them. I allude more especially to his discovery of the range
which I have called Stuart Range, and which appears to have been
traced in a N.W. direction; broken more or less here and there, but'


still forming on the whole a continuous dividing water-parting
from along the west shore of Lake Torrens (about lat. 30� 30',
long. 137� 30') to lat, 28� south and long. 133� east, being the
farthest point on Mr. Stuart?s map. The fact of the waters flowing
from that range to the north-east and north, together with the ap-
parently feasible tale of the natives of large bodies of water existing
still farther to the north and north-west, as well as the improved
country generally existing at the north side of that range, con-
trasted as it is with the extremely barren and desert country
south of it towards Lake Gairdner and the sea ?to which region
the journeys of former explorers were principally confined?all
form a strong body of evidence tending to invest the hitherto
supposed interior desert of Australia with a character at once novel,
important, and interesting.
? At the same time, whilst admitting the great results attained by
Mr, Stuart with comparatively insignificant means, but by the
exertion of a courage, energy, and judgment scarcely paralleled in
the previous history of Australian explorations, it is necessary to
bear in mind that the chart of his track has been constructed with
the aid only of a compass, and the dead reckoning which he kept.
Under such circumstances I shall not be surprised to learn here-
after that his distances are over-stated, as is so often the case when
travellers rely entirely on dead reckoning. Nevertheless, although
there may be considerable room for improvement of his chart in this
respect, it will under all circumstances be a great monument of
what can be achieved by the indomitable pluck of one man, imbued
with a thorough spirit of self-reliance.?
The President.?We return our thanks to the Secretary of the Colonies
for sending to us these voluminous and interesting communications, and also
to the gallant explorers of these hitherto unknown tracts of South Australia.
The gentleman who in the first instance most distinguished himself in these
researches, and to whose merits 1 adverted last session, is Mr. Herschel Bab-
bage, who had undertaken his journey with a fair prospect of success. He
had zealously prepared all the requisites to enable him to get through the
southern saline district from Port Augusta, and 1 give him credit for the enter-
prise, zeal, and talent he exhibited in getting out of a most difficult position.
No sooner was he free of his heavy drays, than, taking to horses, he went
forward to the north, and fixed with more accuracy than any other person
the latitude and longitude of various places, giving us a clear account of the
chief fresh springs, the nature of the rocks, and of the natural productions of
the country, and delineating the form of the saline sheet of water named by
him Lake Gregory as separated from Lake Torrens. It was when he reached
his northernmost point on Lake Gregory that he was recalled, Major War-
burton taking the command of the expedition. All that tract of country
which extends 100 miles inland has now been determined, first by the dis-
coveries of Mr. Babbage, and secondly by those of Major Warburton and
others; and the results quite coincide with the original observations of that


most adventurous traveller Eyre, in proving that all this zone is more or less
saline. This salt country has been crossed by that remarkable man, Mac-
dougall Stuart, who beyond it explored a vast fertile and well-watered region,
with a great many watercourses descending from a chain of hills, to which the
Governor of the colony has very properly assigned the name of the ? Stuart
Range.? This new geographical discovery is indeed one which we might
have expected from the former observations of that most distinguished explorer
of Australia who now sits on my left hand, Captain Sturt. This gentleman,
let me remind you, was truly the discoverer of South Australia. It was he
who, advancing from the north-east, discovered the course and embouchure of
the Murray River, and who indicated what South Australia was likely to
become. Revisiting that tract at a later period, and after a colony had
been established there under the government of Sir George Grey, Captain
Sturt went boldly northward into the interior?much farther than any traveller
who preceded him or has followed him?his progress being arrested by
that great saline desert. Now Mr. Macdougall Stuart was one of Sturt?s
men, and learned from him that, whilst all was saline to the north, yet that
probably towards the north-west there would be found a fertile country?a con-
clusion partly based on the flight of birds from that quarter.
Captain Sturt has come this day from Cheltenham to attend our meeting,
and I rejoice to welcome him ; whilst I am peculiarly gratified to see amongst
us the Bishop of Perth in Western Australia, who has just arrived from that
colony, and who previously to his becoming a dignitary of the Church
was for some years at the head of an educational establishment in Western
Australia.
Captain Sturt, f.r.g.s. ?You may suppose that I have read with very
great interest the different accounts which have been recently sent home with
regard to the discoveries in South Australia, more "particularly that which
refers to my old follower Macdougall Stuart, of whose courage and perseve-
rance I was well assured. He attended me on my second attempt to cross the
stony desert; and it was on that occasion that he and his companion expressed
their readiness to follow me wherever I should lead them, when (after having
been two days and a half without water, our farther advance into the desert
would almost inevitably have cost us our lives) I left it to them to decide
whether to push on or not ?? Sir,? said Stuart to me, ?we will do as you
please; we will go on or turn back as you may direct us,? thus showing their
devotion to the service on which they were employed. I turned back, how-
ever, and in doing so gave up every hope of further success. I may state that
in retreating we lost three horses, and that on arriving at the little water-
hole we had last quitted (on which I had calculated for relief), we found it
had dried up!
The effect of such a discovery may be imagined, where life or death hung
on our procuring water. We had not at that time seen a living animal of
any kind in those fearful solitudes for days, but suddenly a pigeon passed us,
and pitched for a moment only on the stony plain beyond us. Knowing from
his flight that he was going to water, we went to the spot, and there found a
supply of it that lasted us for two days, and which we should never have dis-
covered but for the timely appearance of this bird. This was one of the many
instances we had on that journey of the -goodness of Providence, which can
only be appreciated by those who have been placed in similar circumstances.
So unexpected a deliverance melted my companions into tears. The kind of
country which Stuart has discovered in his recent journey, and which he
describes, is similar to some portions of that which I passed over myself,
particularly near Cooper Creek, where there are slightly elevated ironstone
ranges, with a certain portion of good land on each side of the creek which


flows between the ranges, and which gives a value to this locality as to that
which Stuart has discovered.
In reference to Mr. Babbage?s journey, I have been much surprised at
the altitude he gives to the lakes which he discovered, because I take the
interior to be much lower. At my depot, whence I started into the interior,
and which was only 340 feet above the sea-level, I descended very consider-
ably as I neared the great stony desert, which I consider to be the lowest
part of Central Australia, since the rivers, so far as I could judge, fall into it
both from the south and from the north, and appear to meet in it as a central
channel, for the main channel of Cooper Creek on the one side, and Eyre
Creek on the other, certainly do run into it; but Mr. Gregory having traced
the western arm of Cooper Creek (which, after overflowing a large plain, re-
forms as my Strzelecki Creek) into Lake Torrens, 1 have now no doubt but
that the other creeks which I crossed, equally owing their existence to that
arm of Cooper Creek, water the country immediately to the north of the lately-
discovered lakes, and ultimately flow into them.
I think the most important part of Stuart?s discoveries, independently of the
available country which he has opened out, is the key which his large creek
opens to the farther penetration of Central Australia. If the ranges he
mentions continue to the north-west, as we have every reason to hope, water
may be found near them, so as to enable explorers to go farther into the interior
with every prospect of success from so advanced a position. Stuart, at his
farthest point, was 700 miles from the position which I occupied in the centre,
in lat. 24� and long. 138�. Mr. Gregory, at his farthest distance south from the
Victoria of Stokes, was 4� of latitude higher to the north and 11� of longitude
farther to the west than I was, and, therefore, he was about 700 miles to the
west-north-west of my central position. At that point the country was exactly
the same as the country which I had traversed?the same kind of sand-ridges
and the same kind of vegetation; but there was this remarkable difference in
the two localities, that where Mr. Gregory was, the sand-ridges ran east and
west; and where I was, they ran north and south. How far the same kind of
country may continue to the westward of his point, which would be nearly
due north of Stuart?s farthest point, and about 700 miles distant (our positions
thus forming an equilateral triangle), it is impossible to say. I still believe that
there is a large basin of water in the interior, and that there may be a good
country yet found round about it. A black, who came to our depot, certainly
described water and fish as being to the west of us in so energetic a manner
that we were all convinced there must be a mass of water in the direction to
which he pointed. The motions he made and the indications which he gave
naturally led every one of us to believe and to hope that we were within 50 or
60 miles of an inland sea. I believe now, when the country is farther ex-
plored, that the central channel will be found to lead into or be connected with
some large basin of water.
The President (addressing Captain Sturt). ?How far from west to east do
you suppose the region containing fresh water may extend ?
Captain Sturt. ?l should say it would run to the meridian of 138�.
The President.?l apprehend that Captain Sturt does not wish you to
infer that any part of the region between his farthest north and Gregory?s
farthest south when he proceeded from Tropical Australia can be occupied by
fresh water lakes, rivers, or springs.
Captain Sturt. ?No, no.
The President. ?You see, gentlemen, that all that low region is considered
by Captain Sturt to be sterile.
Captain Sturt. ?That must necessarily be a dry and barren country. It is
to. the westward altogether that my observations point ?to the great western half


of the unexplored portion of the country ; and my view is rendered still
further probable by the flights of fowls which Stuart mentions as going to the
westward over his head.
Mr. Trelawny Saunders. ?The discovery of the interval between Lake
Torrens and Lake Gregory should teach us to beware of assuming, from a
similarity of country at distant points, that the intervening space presents a
continuation of the same nature. But for a deduction ol this kind, the dis-
coveries of Babbage and Stuart on the west of Lake Torrens might have been
forestalled by Eyre nearly 20 years ago. In penetrating at that time into the*
country at the head of Spencer Gulf, Mr. Eyre found his course at
four different points by the impenetrable basin of a salt lake ; and having
been thus repeatedly obstructed by identical features at no great distance apart,
he concluded that these features were continuous. Consequently a long lake
of horseshoe shape has ever since invariably appeared on maps under the name
of Lake Torrens. Mr. Herschel Babbage has, however, how discovered a
tract of practicable country extending nearly the whole distance between two
of the points reached by Mr. Eyre; so that the length of Lake Torrens has
to be curtailed, and a separate basin has to be recognised under the name of
Lake Gregory. Into Lake Gregory falls a permanent stream containing fish,
and some others which Mr. Macdougall Stuart discovered during the admirable
exploration which he has just accomplished with such remarkable success,
A well-watered country was therefore opened to Eyre?s research, if he had
steadily persisted in tracing the limits of the muddy barrier which had barred
his progress three times in this direction, instead of trusting to a tempting
generalization.
The mode of argument which led to the horseshoe extension so long attri-
buted to Lake Torrens, on the basis of four distinct observations not very wide
apart, is now proposed to be adopted in the following case ?one of equal or
greater importance. Captain Sturt was stopped by desert at the northernmost
point of his famous expedition into the interior from the south. Augustus
Gregory also found a similar desert at the southernmost point of his recent
journey from the mouth of the Victoria. Therefore it is supposed that the
interval of about 700 miles is also desert. It must be kept in mind, however,
that a few ranges of no greater height than that discovered by Stuart, and
named after him, would probably suffice to attract and retain the moisture which
the arid air of a stony or sandy plain might absorb before it could descend to
moisten the parched ground. Such ranges would render the connection be-
tween the north and south coasts practicable; and Stuart has indicated the
extension northward and westward of those which he has lately made known,
while it may be considered highly probable that similar features, like the
Stanley and Grey ranges, exist between the waters terminating in Cooper Creek
and the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Mr. John Crawfurd, f.r.g.s. ?l have been charged here more than once with
being a kind of objector-general; to-night I have not a word to say in the shape
of objection. 1 approve of the conduct of all the gentlemen who make these
most important discoveries ; the greatest praise is due to all of them. They
have conferred great obligations upon the colony itself, obligations upon
ns who have been listening to what they have done, and obligations upon
the country at large. They are true Englishmen, countrymen of the dis-
coverers of the steam-engine, the locomotive, the electric telegraph, and of
the only people who could have performed the feats they have done. Cap-
tain Sturt, now here, but with whom-I have not the good fortune to be
acquainted, is, according to my judgment, the greatest of all Australian dis j
coverers. We are heartily obliged to him for coming up here in his rather
delicate state of health: at the same time lam sorry to see him ? here, for
another reason, that he ought to be employed in some high office elsewhere,


as, for example, governor of South Australia or of Victoria, or some equally-
important office, for he is assuredly most eminently qualitied, I have in my
time read several books on Australia, and fear I have forgotten most of them.
Not so those of Captain Sturt, which no one that has perused them can ever
forget, for they make truth more interesting than fiction.
The President. ?These despatches are full of interesting anecdotes, which,
when published, will be read with great interest.
(Here the President read two passages ; one regarding the natives, another
describing the habits of the emu.)
Captain Stdrt. ?l quite agree with our worthy President that such is the
case. The features of the country are such as to lead to that conclusion. I
cannot but think that the desert extended for hundreds of miles beyond where
I was at my extreme north. Its features were altogether on too large a scale
for me to suppose that they would speedily terminate or change, for notwithstand-
ing that the distance between Mr. Gregory?s position and my own is so great as
700 miles, not only is the character of the country the same at both points,
but the vegetation is precisely the same also. Probably a better country than
either I or Gregory found, exists in the central portion of the great western
half of the continent, which has never yet been approached. 1 was in great
hopes that Mr, Gregory would have found that Sturt Creek, the creek he
traced south, either ran farther to the south, or that it terminated in a basin ;
but he found that, like all the central rivers of Australia, falling into a level
interior, it gradually lost its current, then assumed a chain of ponds, and was
ultimately lost by evaporation and absorption. Such is the general fate of
all the inland waters of the continent; for which reason there is so much
difficulty in making sure of a supply of water in it. When I went into the
interior I never allowed my party to go on until I had made a day?s journey
in advance and found water. Yet with all this caution I was cut off from
the possibility of a retreat at the depot, where I was locked up for six
months, and saw the water diminish day by day, from twelve feet to eleven
inches, when in ten days more, if rain had not fallen, there would not have
been a man of us alive; fortunately, however, a fall of rain came from the
north-east, as in Stuart?s case, like a dense fog, and in less than twenty-four
hours filled the creek to overflowing, which it had taken six months to exhaust.
This drizzling rain lasted two days, and it was on the surface-water left by
it that I ventured to push on farther into the interior, drinking from shallow
puddles that the wind made as thick as mud, and sometimes water that was
perfectly loathsome.
Professor Owen. ?l would ask your permission to say a few words,
because I am in hopes that they may help a little towards increasing our
knowledge of the peculiar animals, especially the quadrupeds, which inhabit
the continent of Australia, respecting which we have just heard such new and
interesting information. By me, of course, the narrative of the remarkable
geographical discoveries in South Australia has been listened to chiefly in
anticipation of novel facts in zoology, and I will not disguise my disappoint-
ment at hearing mention made of only one small kangaroo-mouse. But your
estimable President has consoled me by intimating that the papers of Mr.
Macdougall Stuart contain a few other observations upon natural history sub-
jects. And yet one ought not to be surprised to hear so little about the native
quadrupeds from an Australian traveller, who was not expressly bent on
zoological collections.
Ail the marsupial quadrupeds, and it is one of their curious peculiarities,
are nocturnal. Even the kangaroo, which is the least so, is scarcely ever seen
feeding out on the plains in broad daylight; it prefers the early morning
dawn or the short twilight, and, above all, the bright moonlight nights. With
regard to most of the other Australian forms of marsupial animals, they are


more strictly nocturnal. So that, if a traveller were not aware of that pecu-
liarity, he might fancy himself traversing a country destitute of the mam-
malian grade of animal life. If, however, after a weary day?s journey he
could be awakened, and were to look out upon the moonlit glade or scrub, or
if he were to set traps by night, he would probably be surprised to find how
great a number of interesting forms of mammalian animals were to be met
with in places where there was not the slightest appearance of them in the
day-time.
It is most interesting, with regard to the very peculiar characteristics of the
prevalent mammalian forms in this enormous continent, to look back into
times past?of untold antiquity?and to find, from the evidences that have
been lately coming over rapidly, of the fossil remains of mammalian animals
that are obtained from formations in Australia of the same general cha-
racter and geological age as those brick-fields and other lacustrine deposits in
our own country, where our old elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, and
other large quadrupeds are found; to find, I say, that in Australia there are
evidences of creatures of equal bulk, but of marsupial nature, which have also
passed away and become extinct. We can now show in the British Museum,
for example, the fossil skull of a kangaroo?that is to say, of an animal with
the peculiar cranial structure and dentition of the genus Macropus ?tooth
for tooth, in kind, in shape, in number and position, like no other creature but
a kangaroo ; and yet this fossil cranium is more than three feet in length.
The governor of New South Wales, Sir William Denison, has transmitted,
and through your excellent President has distributed to those who can best
appreciate the evidences afforded by a happy application of the photographic
art, excellent photographs of other singular fossils that have lately been disco-
vered in Darling Downs in Australia. Those evidences have brought to our
knowledge the skull of a quadruped not so large as the one I have referred to,
but the most extraordinary in its proportions and-characters that the palaeon-
tologist has ever before seen, and which, in reference to its affinities, finds its
nearest analogue in that rare marsupial animal called the koala. The Noto-
tfierium was as gigantic, in reference to that recent marsupial, as the Dipro-
todon with a head three feet long is to the existing kangaroo. _ These great
herbivorous marsupials were preyed upon by an equally marsupial carnivore
of the size of a lion. Thus we learn that marsupialia enjoyed existence in
Australia in times long past, and under forms as gigantic and remarkable as
those Placentalia discovered in the European and Asiatic continents, which
have revealed the former existence there of hairy elephants and rhinoceroses,
of huge deer and bisons, of bears and hyamas, illustrating the same geographical
restriction of certain mammalian forms in the pre-historic and present times.
In regard to the relation of marsupial quadrupeds to Australia, the adapta-
tion of their peculiar characteristic to that country has been impressed upon
me to-night more than on any other occasion, while listening to the graphic
and thrilling account of the difficulties which the highest form of mammalian
life finds in maintaining his existence in that continent, in consequence of the
great scarcity of water. 1 have always connected with the long droughts in
Australia, with the extensive tracts where there are no waters, with the difficulty
of obtaining that necessary element of life, ?the singular peculiarity of orga-
nisation which prevails among the mammalian quadrupeds of Australia. The
carnivorous species and the insectivorous ones, the trugivorous ; the root-eating
and the leaf-eating quadrupeds?no matter what their diet, whatever be their
powers of locomotion and spheres of action ; whether they burrow like the
wombat, climb like the phalanger, ?jump like the kangaroo, trot like the
bandicoot, or fly like the petaurist,?no matter what their mode of motion or
kind of food, ?all these creatures are marsupial. 1 may be asked, What do
you mean by marsupial ? I mean that they are creatures having the power of


carrying their delicate prematurely-born young about with them wherever they
go. They have this condition, viz., a solt, warm, well-lined portable nursery-
pocket or ? perambulator.? Take the case of one of our wild quadrupeds
suppose a fox or wild cat; they make their nest, they have their litter. Sup-
pose it should happen that they must travel one or two hundred miles to get
a drink of water, impelled by the peculiar thirsty condition of a nursing-
mother, but obliged to leave the little family at home,?where would that
family be when the parent returned from its hundred miles journey, the
poor, little, blind, deserted litter? Why, starved to death. In order that
quadrupeds should be fitted to exist in a great continent like Australia, where
the meteoric conditions are such as to produce the dilemma I have instanced,
those quadrupeds must possess an organisation suited to such peculiar
climatal conditions. And so it is; that form of mammalian quadruped
in this great continent, native to it, and born so as to make these migrations
to obtain that necessity of life, has the superadded pouch and genetic pecu-
liarities enabling them to carry their young ones wherever they go. And
since we find that marsupial animals have lived in Australia from a very
remote period, so we may infer that its peculiar climate has prevailed during
as vast a lapse of time. Permit me to conclude by repeating that the peculiar
mammalian forms of Australia hide themselves by day, and must be sought
for by night, or early dawn, or twilight. The scientific traveller, bearing�in
mind that the marsupialia are nocturnal and keep out of view, would do well
to let no night pass without setting and baiting traps for them. He would
probably thus be able greatly to enrich our catalogues of these most curious
and interesting quadrupeds.

2. Notes on the Manacusi , or Paver King George. By Charles H.
Hilliard, Mate of the Cutter Herald. 1857.
Communicated by J. Lyons M?Leod, Esq,, f.r.g.s., late H. M. Consul
at Mozambique.
The Herald sailed on a trading expedition up the Manacusi Eiver.
When she had attained a distance of from 100 to 140 miles from its
mouth, the Portuguese authorities forbad farther progress, and the
vessel was ordered to return. Mr. Hilliard gives an account of
what was observed during the three weeks the Herald was in the
river. The bar at its mouth is described as the scene of a fearful
surf, dangerous to a boat, but offering no difficulty to the vessel;
? Opposite to the passage by which we entered are several large,
low islands, densely covered with the finest red mangrove poles I
ever saw, on which the archil grows in great abundance, and on the
bush by the banks of the river. For some miles up the river the
banks are more or less covered with bush, mangrove jungles, and
trees, generally a species of banian, and others, indicating a wet
soil, the most of which I have seen growing in swamps in Natal.
On the first night, by where we anchored, the large bush-buck
(Inconcha) appeared to be plentiful from the number we heard
barking like small dogs.
