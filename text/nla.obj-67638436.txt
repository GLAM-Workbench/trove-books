NATIONAL EDUCATION
1 have repeatedly been requested by'true and enlightened
friends of Education, to explain to the public of this Colony,
the real principles upon which the National System reposes.
I have no hesitation in complying with this request, for
more than one reason, and particularly at a period when
Education is justly claiming so large a share of public atten-
tion. I am, however, particularly anxious, before entering
upon this important subject, to assure my readers that
nothing is more foreign to my intention than to throw the
slightest imputation upon any rival system, whether here or
elsewhere. My sole object is to present a plain statement of
facts ; to exhibit, as briefly as I can, the fundamental prin-
ciples that govern the National System, and to prove that the
advantages it offers, both in a literary and a religious point
of view, are such as to entitle it to the patronage of every
unbiassed man, whatever may be his creed or his profession.
I might, perhaps, be looked upon by some as an interested
interpreter, if I did not inform them that all the facts I
shall adduce may be found in the printed Reports of the
Irish Board of National Education. The only merit I can
claim is that of collecting those facts, and of condensing
them within such limits as I trust no reader will find too
extended. I consider I shall best discharge my task by
giving a short sketch of the rise and progress of the Na-
tional System in Ireland, of the other systems that had
previously existed, and by showing the motives that induced
the British Government to sanction and adopt the present
Irish system as, of all others, the one most suited to the
wants of a mixed community.
There were three principal Educational Societies existing
in Ireland, previous to the establishment of the present Irish
National Board:?
Ist. The Incorporated Society for Promoting Protestant
Schools in Ireland.
2nd. The Association for Discountenancing Vice.


3rd. The Society for Promoting the Education of the
Poor of Ireland, called the Kildare?street Society.
In 1806, a Commission was appointed to inquire into the
state of all schools and charities of public foundation in
Ireland. The Commissioners were called upon to suggest
a plan for the general education of the lower orders ot the
people. A few years after, in compliance with a letter from
the Chief Secretary, the Right Hon. Wellesley Pole, the Com-
missioners submitted the result of their inquiries on the
subject of extending and improving the education of the
lower orders of the people. They proposed, after mature
deliberation, that a new system should be founded, having
for fundamental principle, non-interference with the par-
ticular religious tenets of any class of Christians. Here are
the words of the CommissionersWe conceive this to bo
of essential importance to any new establishment tor the
education of the lower classes in Ireland, and we venture to
express our unanimous opinion that no suen plan, how ever
wisely and unexceptionably contrived in other respects, can
be carried into effectual execution in this country, unless it
be explicitly avowed, and clearly understood, as its leading
principle, that no attempt shall be made to influence or dis-
turb the peculiar religious tenets of any seel or description
of Christians; ? and they add in their fourteenth Report
that, ? a strict forbearance from any such attempt may be
rendered consistent with a considerable degree ot religious
instruction, &c.?
The Commissioners, in 1812, recommended the ap-
pointment of a permanent board, with full power to
substitute a systematic and uniform plan of instruc-
tion, instead of the existing ill-taught and ill-regulated
schools; to prescribe the mode of education to be
pursued in them, and to exercise a general superin-
tendence. The selection of proper books for all the schools
to be placed under the management of the New Commis-
sioners, was particularly recommended. ?We doubt not,
said the Commissioners, (s but it will be found practicable
to introduce not only a number of books, in which moral
principles will be inculcated in such a manner as is likely to
make deep and lasting impression on the youthful mind, but
also ample extracts from the sacred Scriptures themselves,
an early acquaintance with which we deem of the utmost
importance, and indeed indispensable in forming the mind
to just notions of duty and sound principles of conduct. It
appears to us that a selection may be made in which the
most important parts of sacred history shall be included, to-


gether with all the precepts of morality, and all the instruc-
tive examples by which these precepts are illustrated and
enforced, and which shall not be liable to any of the objec-
tions which have been made to the use of the Scriptures in
the course of education. The study of such a volume of ex-
tracts from the sacred writings would, in our opinion, form
the best preparation for that more particular religious in-
struction, which it would be the duty, and we doubt not,
the inclination also of their several ministers of religion to
give at proper times, and in other places, to the children of
their respective congregations.?
This report led indirectly to the grants for many years af-
terwards made to the ? Kildare-street Society.? How it came
todo so we are informed by the Commissioners of 1824, in their
first report. ? There is reason to believe,? say they, <e that
the selection of Commissioners for carrying these proposi-
tions into effect Avas found to be a point of considerable diffi-
culty, and it may have been owing in part to this circum-
stance that it was thought right, in order to try the experi-
ment of the principle above recommended, to make a
parliamentary grant to an institution already in existence,
rather than appoint a new board for the purpose. The
institution selected for this object Avas called the Society for
Promoting the Education of the Poor in Ireland. It Avas
formed December 2nd, 1811, and Avas managed by a Com-
mittee, the members of Avhich Avere of various religious per -
suasions. They laid doAvn, as their rule of conduct, to
establish and assist in the support of schools, in Avhich the
appointment of governors and teachers and the admission of
scholars should be uninfluenced by religious distinctions,
and in which the Bible or Testament without note or com-
ment should be read by all the scholars, who had attained a
suitable proficiency in reading, excluding catechisms and
books of religious controversy; Avishing it, at the samh time,
to be distinctiy understood that the Bible or Testament Avas
not to be used as a school-book, from which children should
be taught to spell or read.?
A grant of nearly �7OOO a-year Avas accordingly made to
this society in the session of 1814-15. The system Avas the
same as that denominated the Lancasterian. It Avas opposed
by the bishops and clergy of the Established Church in
England, and its application to schools for children of the
Established Church thus prevented. The opposition of the
Roman Catholic Prelates and Clergy in Ireland was equally
active and equally successful.
In 1824 two important facts were elicited, viz,, that of


400,348 children, whose parents paid for their education in
the general schools of the country, and whose religious de-
nominations were ascertained, 81,060 Avere Protestants, and
319,288 were Roman Catholics, Avhilst out of 56,201 children
educated under the Kildare-street Society,though theirs Avere
schools specially intended for the poor, and that the Roman
Catholics bear a much greater proportion to Protestants in
the lower than in the higher classes, there were 26,237
Protestants, and only 29,964 Catholics. The superinten-
dent of the Dublin Model Schools, of this Society, Avas ex-
amined by a Board of Commissioners in 1824, and amongst
other questions Avas asked the following three :?lst. Are
the Scriptures explained in any Avay in the class-room ?
2nd. Do the more advanced boys understand the Ncav Tes-
tament in reading it? 3rd. Do they manifest any curiosity,
any Avish to be better informed about it ? To the two first
questions he gives a simple negative reply, and to the third
he ansAvers, ? I never kneAV an instance of it.? Such facts
as these induced the Government to conclude that a system
had not yet been discovered suited to the peculiar Avants of
the country. They clearly perceived that the systems then
in existence failed in accomplishing the object proposed, and
that, from their very constitution, they could never lay claim
to public confidence. They Avere also aAvare that the
instruction imparted under the various societies Avas defec-
tive both in amount and in quality. The teachers Avere
ignorant and totally unacquainted with method. There
were no normal institutions, in Avhich they might receive a
proper course of preparatory training to fit them for the high
and arduous duties of a teacher. The small fraction of the
enlightened portion of the population felt little or no in-
terest in primary education. They never made it the subject
of thoughtful consideration, for they did not reflect upon its
permanent influence on public morality. They forgot that
to educate a community is to furnish the strongest guarantee
of obedience to the constituted laws of the country, the
surest safeguard of public peace and order.
Those high results could not be obtained under former
systems for two reasons : first, because the education im-
parted was one only in name and essentially defective, and
secondly and principally, because all denominations Avere not
persuaded that the inviolable rights of conscience Avere suffi-
ciently secured.
The attention of the British Government was long and
anxiously directed to the devising of a plan that Avould fully
meet the educational requirements of the country, and at


the same time secure the confidence of all religious denomi-
nations. This was no easy task, when we consider the mul-
tiplied elements of discord that so long kept men asunder,
and distracted that portion of the British dominions, under
other aspects so favorably circumstanced.
_ Three agencies have lent their powerful and progressive
aid in effecting the moral and physical regeneration of the
country. The first of these, in time, importance, and opera-
tion, is education; the second consists in the improved
method of communication through the medium of steam ;
and the last, though perhaps not the least, in successful
action, is the Encumbered Estates Court. With the first of
these regenerating influences alone have we to deal.
In 1831, the present Earl of Derby, then Mr. Stanley,
and chief Secretary for Ireland, wrote his celebrated letter
to the Duke of Leinster, offering him the presidency of the
new Board of Education. In that letter were detailed the
motives that induced the Government to constitute the new
Board, the powers to be vested in it, and the object to be
borne in view, and carried into effect. The very suspicion
of proselytism was to be banished from the new system.
Children of all persuasions were to be admitted, without
interference with their peculiar religious tenets. This was
but a renewal of the wise recommendation of the Commis-
sioners of 1812. But the letter of the chief Secretary
went further, and stated that one of the leading principles
of the Kildare Street Society, defeated the object they had
in view. That principle was to enforce the reading of the
sacred Scriptures, without note or comment. They strangely
forgot that such a practice was directly opposed to the principles
of the Roman Catholic Church. A modification then became
indispensable, and the only plan that could meet the difficulty
was wisely and frankly proposed, viz., a combined literary and
a separate religious education. A system was then recom-
mended, such, that while the interests of religion should
not be overlooked, the most scrupulous care should be taken
to respect the peculiar tenets of pupils of all persuasions.
Men of high standing, both clergymen and laymen, came
forward to offer in their persons the strongest guarantee
that these two important conditions would be faithfully
observed. A mixed Board was formed, composed of Protes-
tants, Presbyterians, and Roman Catholics, whose operations,
notwithstanding the countless difficulties they had to en-
counter, were characterised with uninterrupted harmony,
and crowned with marked success. Religion, made use of,
unfortunately, in Ireland as a disturbing element, returned.


after a lull of twenty years, to create a temporary interrup-
tion in the harmonious action of a small section of the
members of the Irish Board. That misunderstanding has
in all likelihood already been explained; and I confidently
trust that one of the first, one of the most enlightened and
most devoted friends of the National System has, ere now,
resumed the position he held so long with such universally-
acknowledged impartiality, and with such benefit to
the community.
The first important duty the Board had to perform
was to furnish a series of graduated elementary
school-books. How successfully this important task
has been performed, the wide-spread fame of these
compilations sufficiently attests. Amongst the different
proofs of the superior excellence of the Irish National
school-books, I may be permitted to state that, for more
than a year previous to my leaving Europe, and whilst still
serving as Inspector under the National Board in Dublin, I
was in constant correspondence with men of high literary
fame in Germany, who were then engaged in translating our
books, with a view of having the Irish system adopted in
Germany, and of introducing our books, as the best existing,
into the primary institutions of that country. I mention
this fact, not from any motive of personal vanity, but
because I wish to show that the National System?which
we originally sought for in Germany, France, and Holland?
must have made very rapid progress, and must have
assumed a very superior rank among other systems, to de-
serve to be claimed, after a lapse of twenty years, as a
standard for one of the most enlightened nations in Europe.
The highest tribute to the superiority of our books is paid
by our rivals, in all of whose schools, no matter of what
denomination, the National school-books are in univer-
sal use.
The present system of National Education had scarce been
established wnen the conduct and motives of the Commis-
sioners were loudly assailed by a certain section of the com-
munity. Besides the elementary school-books, a collection
from the Old and New Testament, called Scripture extracts,
was published with the unanimous sanction of the Com-
missioners, both Protestant, Presbyterian, and Roman Ca-
tholic. The opponents of the National System complained,
that by the publication of these extracts, the Bible was to
have been completely superseded. The mere perusal of the
preface to the first number of these extracts will be the best
refutation of an objection founded cither on ignorance or


prejudice. To guard against the danger of misapprehension
or misrepresentation, the Commissioners prefaced it by say-
ing ? These selections are offered not as a substitute for the
sacred volume itself, but as. an introduction to it, in the hope
of their leading to a more general and more profitable
perusal of the Word of God. The passages introduced have
been chosen, not as being of more importance than the rest
of Scripture, but merely as appearing to be most level to the
understandings of children and youth at school, and also
best fitted to be read under the direction of teachers not
necessarily qualified, and certainly not recognised as teachers
of religion. No passage has either been introduced or
omitted under the influence of any particular view of Chris-
tianity, doctrinal or practical.?
The next objection made was, that the children were denied
the benefits of religious instruction, and were kept from the
Word of God. To show how unfounded this objection is, it
is only necessary to read the fundamental rules of the Board,
on this important subject. It will there be found that the
most ample provision is made, that one day in each week,
independently of Sunday, is set apart for religious instruc-
tion, on which day any pastor, commissioned by the parents
or guardians of the children, shall have free access to them.
It will further be found that every facility for religious
instruction is granted by the spirit and rules of the National
Board, not only on one day in the week, but on every day,
either before or after the hours set apart for secular teaching.
In a word, the Commissioners claim merely four hours a day,
the shortest space of time deemed necessary for the require-
ments of secular instruction, and they then freely give up
the use of the school-room, for the remainder of the day, to
any authorised teacher of religion deputed by the parents of
the children. As this is the particular point upon Avhich
other educational societies have thought proper to object to
the National System, I cannot be too plain in stating what
amount of time, and what facilities are given, for religious
instruction according to the true spirit and principles of the
National System. I will then suppose that a Patron, or a
Board of Patrons, apply for the establishment of a National
School; they inquire if they can have religious instruction;
how (is that religious instruction) and by whom is that
religious instruction to be imparted, whether once a week or
daily, and for what length of time ? To those questions they
will receive the following replies :?lst. You can have
religious instruction as frequently as required, and to any
amount deemed necessary by the parents and pastors of the


children for whom that religious instruction is asked. 2nd.
The Commissioners never interfere tvith the special mode of
giving religious instruction, they leave this matter entirely
in the hands of the pastors and parents of the pupils. There
is only one condition, viz., the religious instructor must have
the direct sanction of the parents. 3rd. You may give
religious instruction every day if you please, for half-
an-hour, an hour, or even two if you think it neces-
sary, and during those hours you may introduce and teach
the Bible, or any other book you please intended to impart
religious knowledge. Every facility shall be granted to you,
and the only condition the Commissioners require is, that the
religious instructors will confine their teaching to pupils of
their own persuasion, and that the hours set aside for secular
teaching shall not be interfered with. Let the people of
this noble and independent colony judge ?as I believe they
will do?for themselves, calmly and dispassionately, and see
from the above simple statement of facts, if it be true, as our
adversaries assert, that the National System excludes the
religious element. It requires, to say the least of it, no
little courage to put forth an assertion in direct opposition
to one of our fundamental rules. Not only religion is not
excluded from the National System, but the clergy of the
different denominations are earnestly requested to come to
our schools and perform their part of the task. If they re-
fuse the invitation, is it fair to attribute their refusal to a
defect in the system ?
One of the chief objects of the National System is to
bring children of all persuasions together, upon common
ground,?that of secular instruction upon those points of
education which could not interfere with the conscience of
any ; and at the same time to extend to all, without excep-
tion, the fullest opportunities for separate religious instruc-
tion. The misunderstanding of a rule so simple and so
clearly expressed, appears to arise, not from a wish to inter-
pret fairly, but from a studied intention to frustrate, as far as
possible, the obiect proposed,?that of uniting persons of
different religious persuasions in friendly intercourse, and of
laying at an early period of life the basis of future harmony,
of charitable feeling, and of good will.
In the second lieport of the Commissioners of National
Education in Ireland, they replied to a few queries put by
Government in reference to the general result of the new
system, the works that formed part of the secular course of
instruction, the defects in the schools, before and then exist-
ing, whether Protestant or Catholic, from which the new


system is exempt. The Government inquired whether it
was hoped that a new class of teachers might be trained,
whose conduct and influence might be beneficial in promot-
ing morality, harmony, and good order in the country parts
Ox Ii eland. It ivas also asked, what extension might be
given to the new system of education, consistently with the
demand for instruction, and with due regard to the prepara-
tion necessary for training schoolmasters, upon whom re-
liance might be had in respect to competency, character and
discretion: and, lastly, what amount of funds might be
annually expended beneficially by the State for that purpose.
Grants towards the establishment of 191 additional school-
houses, the signatures to applications from 140 clergymen of
the Established Church, from 180 Presbyterian, and from
1,397 Roman Catholic clergymen, from 6,915 Protestant
and from 8,630 Catholic laymen, bore ample testimony that
the National System was fully adopted by all persuasions,
and by all classes in the community. .It is worthy of re-
mark, that the Protestant clerical signatures bear to the
Roman Catholic clerical signatures about the same ratio that
the numerical amount of these two denominations bears to
each other in the mass of the population, and that the Pro-
testant lay signatures, bear a still higher proportion. In
the province of Ulster, in which Protestants of that class of
society for which the National Schools were specially in-
tended are numerous, we find the signatures of 246 Pro-
testant clergymen. These facts prove to demonstration
that the National System was acceptable to Protestant, Pres-
byterian, and Catholic.
In reference to the third query, the Commissioners
adverted to the two main defects till then existing in the
schools in Ireland, the one founded on exclusion upon
religious grounds, the other arising from incompetent
teachers, and books of an inferior character. Schools, con-
ducted exclusively on Protestant principles, were looked
upon by Catholics as adverse institutions; and when sup-
ported by Government, they tended to excite jealousy, and
perhaps a worse feeling. In regard to query four, the anti-
cipations of the Board have been in a great measure realised,
and there is only one condition more required to satisfy the
most anxious wish of every friend of Education, and that is
to laise the social condition of the teacher \ a class whose
mission is so high, and whose influence must be widely felt,
whether for good or for evil, to raise their condition to that
standard in public estimation to which the dignity of the
functions they discharge so fully entitles them. In answer


to the last query, a reasonable hope was expressed that,
through the medium of improved teaching, and of well-
composed books ?the subject matter of which should be
carefully explained ?the advantages of the new system
would be felt, and its benefits enjoyed by the great mass of
the population. This hope has been realised beyond antici-
pation.
At an early stage of the Board?s operation, the attention
of the Commissioners was called, by the Lord Lieutenant,
to a pamphlet, entitled, ?A Speech delivered in the House of
Lords, on 15th March, 1836, in moving for a select Com-
mittee, to inquire into the Operation of the Commissioners
for National Education in Ireland, by the Bishop of Exeter.?
In this pamphlet, the writer accuses the Commissioners of
gross neglect of duty, as to religious instruction, and of
utter indifference as to the morals of the teachers.? In their
second Report, for the year 1835, the Commissioners say,
speaking of our schools in general, and of those in which
our teachers are to receive their first training ?In them
the importance of religion is constantly impressed on the
minds of the children, through works calculated to promote
good principles, and fill the heart with a love for religion,
but which are so compiled as not to clash with the doctrines
of any particular class of Christians. The children are
thus prepared for those more strict religious exercises which
it is the peculiar province of the minister of religion to
superintend or direct, and for which, stated times are set
apart in each school, so that each class of Christians may
thus receive, separately, such religious instruction, and from
such persons, as their parents may approve or appoint.?
The author of the pamphlet suppressed the whole of this
passage.
JL
In speaking of the teachers, the Commissioners say: ?If
we are furnished with adequate means by the State, not
only for training schoolmasters, but for inducing competent
persons to became candidates for teacherships, through a
fair prospect of remuneration and advancement, we have no
doubt but that a new class of schoolmasters may be trained,
whose conduct and influence must be highly beneficial in
promoting morality, harmony, and good order in the country
parts of Ireland.? It suited the convenience of the author
of the pamphlet to suppress this passage also.
It was next objected that the Irish Board was less alive
to the interests of religion, than the Minister of Public In-
struction in France. Many of my readers are probably
acquainted with the celebrated circular letter of M. Guizot


to the teachers of elementary schools in France. The words
of the French Minister on the subject of religion are faith-
tully quoted, whilst those ot the Irish Commissioners are
either suppressed or intentionally garbled. The Commis-
sioners distinctly state, in speaking of the teachers, ?It is
only through such persons that we can hope to render the
National Schools successful in improving the general condi-
tion of the people. It is not, however, through the schools
committed to their charge that the beneficial influence of
their conduct would be felt. Living in friendly habits with
the people, not greatly elevated above them, but so provided
for as to maintain a respectable station; trained to good
habits, identified in interest with the State, and therefore
anxious to promote a spirit of obedience to lawful authority,
avc are confident they would prove a body of the utmost
value and importance in promoting civilisation and peace.?
In the appendix to the 2nd report, and in reference to the
choice of teachers^ we find the following words: ?Local
Patrons and Committees of Schools are expected to select
suitable teachers, but the Commissioners will require to be
satisfied as to the fitness of the teachers, both as regards
nioi al character and literary qualifications, by testimonials,
and if they think fit, by training in a model school and
by examination.?
The appointment and dismissal of teachers is the privilege
of Local Patrons, but the Commissioners require the highest
amount of moral and intellectual guarantee, as an indispen-
sable condition of their sanction and approval. They re-
quire, to use their own words, " that a teacher be a person
of Christian of calm temper and discretion, that
he be imbued with a spirit of peace, of obedience to the law,
and loyalty to the Sovereign. He should not only possess
the art of communicating knowledge, but be capable of
moulding the mind of youth, and of giving the power which
education confers a useful direction. These are the qualities
to which the attention of patrons is earnestly invited in the
selection of teachers, and which the Commissioners are
anxious to find, to encourage, and rew'ard. It is strange, that
notwithstanding these formal and pressing recommendations,
and the direct responsibility thus thrown upon the patrons,
both as regards the moral conduct and literary qualifications
of the teachers, that any imperfection in either of the above
departments is invariably ascribed to some defect in the
National System, or to some neglect on the part of the Com-
missioners. The Board does all that is possible to secure
the services of the best qualified, in every respect, by con-


firming the choice of the Local Patrons, who in many in-
stances are clergymen, and on whose careful examination of
the merits and qualifications of the candidates the Commis-
sioners naturally place the fullest reliance.
Lord Stanley announced in the House of Commons, in
September, 1831, the intention of the British Government
to appoint the present .Board of National Education in Ire-
land. The plan proposed by former Commissioners, and
recommended by the Committee of the House of Commons
in 1828, was adopted with the exception of one clause. That
clause was, that the Protestant version of the Testament
should be supplied to Protestants, and the Douay version to
Roman Catholics. Some members of the Board objected
and refused to become instrumental in giving circulation to
the Catholic version of the Testament. The clause was
accordingly rejected, and the Scripture extracts were pro-
posed and agreed upon, by members of all religious persua-
sions, as a book to be read in the general course of education.
It was objected that the National System was to be univer-
sal, and that the books edited by the Board were to be the
only ones used in the new schools. This is a mistake or a
misrepresentation, in both cases. The National System was
intended to supply schools which would supersede those
disgraceful institutions generally known by the name of
hedge schools. It was never meant, either by Government
or by the Board, that the new system should interfere with
the operations of any good and useful educational establish-
ment. It was established with a view to supplement and
not to destroy. The Commissioners never intended to make
the use of their books compulsory in any National School;
they formally disclaim any such intention. They offered
their books as most desirable substitutes for those demoralis-
ing productions till then in use, and the patrons of schools
unanimously and thankfully adopted them, on grounds of
superior merit. The Commissioners were ever anxious to
impress upon those new institutions a real religious character,
by inviting the co-operation of the clergy of all persuasions,
with a view of placing their schools on the broadest basis, of
connecting religion with morality and learning, and of bind-
ing them indissolubly together in the bonds of concord,
good faith, and Christian charity.
Lord Stanley, after having pointed out the objections to the
Kildare-street Society, on the grounds of its being a volun-
tary and irresponsible society, expressed also his opinion
that it was of a proselytising character. The bulk of the
schools was in the Protestant Province of Ulster, which


contained nearly twice as many as the other three provinces
put together.
In 1831, there were trained in the model schools of this
Society 204 teachers, of whom only 33 were Roman Ca-
tholics. Such facts tended to justify suspicion, a change
became not only desirable, but absolutely necessary, and
which resulted in the establishing of the present National
System.
In 1826, a Board of Commissioners reported that the
number of children attending schools, supported by Govern-
ment aid, was 69,638, with a grant of nearly �70,000;
whilst in 1838 the number educated by the National Board
was 169,000, with a grant of only �50,000. These facts
stand out in striking contrast, and demonstrate to every un-
biassed reader how little was formerly effected with large
sums but with imperfect systems, and how much was per-
formed with limited means but with enlightened, impartial,
and economical administration.
T he Commissioners of National Education undertook their
task regardless alike of praise or censure, unguided by
interest, and free from a sectarian spirit. The object they
proposed to themselves was to raise the national character to
a higher standard, by diffusing the blessings of moral and
intellectual improvement, and to unite in the bonds of peace
and harmony eyery class and denomination of Christians,
leaving their homes and altars free. Experience and the
decisions of those whose opinions are worth recording, have
long since passed judgment, and the unbiassed testimony of
all enlightened men has declared that combined literary and
separate religious instruction is the only system suited to the
circumstances of a mixed community.
Taking into account the peculiar circumstances of Ireland,
the strong feeling of distrust so long and so deeply rooted
in the minds of the population, and hourly fomented by pro-
fessional agitators, the small amount of funds at the disposal
of the Commissioners, the rapid spread of National Educa-
tion became matter of just and general surprise. There was
no longer any doubt, even at the early stage of 1833, but
that the principles of the system were approved of and ac-
cepted by the great mass of the nation.
Whilst the National System was thus striking deep root
and rapidly extending over the entire surface of the country,
it received a temporary check in one of the western districts
of Ireland. Aid had been requested for a school by a
Catholic prelate. The Commissioners, under the peculiar cir-
cumstances of the case, were reluctantly obliged to reject


the application. The consequence of the refusal was, that
several schools in the district, subject to the spiritual con-
trol of the prelate, ceased their connexion with the Board,
and the operation of other schools, vested in trustees, was
interrupted till other trustees could be appointed. The
patrons of all those schools whose connexion was thus so
suddenly and so unexpectedly severed, were, with one ex-
ception, clergymen. Thirteen of the number expressed
their intention to withdraw their patronage, in the following
words: ?We, the undersigned, feeling that the National
System, as at present constituted, can never enjoy the con-
fidence of the Irish people ; and considering the abuses that
have been proved in the allocation of the funds intrusted to
that body, do hereby, in conference assembled, withdraw
ourselves from any further communion with the Board of
Education, and we request the secretary to signify to the
Commissioners that we shall entertain no further commum
cation or connexion with them.?
In this extraordinary resolution no objection was made to
the principles of the system, or to any act of the Board
towards the individuals who thus disconnected themselves.
They approved of the system in theory, and even experienced
its favorable action for several They never asserted
that its principles were dangerous or injurious to interests of
any kind, and yet they decided, in council assembled, with-
out adducing a single proof, that the National System, ap-
proved of and adopted as it was by nearly the entire popu-
lation, could never enjoy the confidence of the Irish people.
There is, unfortunately, no source to which an appeal can
be made with such probable prospects of success, in Ireland,
as want of confidence. It is, if I may so express it, a sort
of standing dish, which requires little skilly in cooking, and
which is always sure to find eager appetites. # The most
triumphant answer to such strange inconsistency in conduct,
the highest testimony in favor of truth and principle is that,
in those very localities, where the spirit of factious opposi-
tion had been so loudly appealed to, the National System
now enjoys the universal and cordial support of all classes,
and of all denominations. Passion and prejudice have long
since yielded to calm reflection, and the west of Ireland
enjoys at this moment the same educational advantages as
the other provinces.
The Commissioners having been misrepresented, under
various forms, found it necessary, in their report for 1841,
to repeat the original and fundamental rules of the Board,
and particularly those bearing on religious instruction, and


the controling power vested in certain members of the
Board, in regard to the particular religious instruction of
certain denominations of pupils. The Commissioners em-
phatically disclaimed any control over the use of the sacred
Scriptures, or over the standards of any of the three recog-
nised churches of Ireland?Protestant, Presbyterian, and
Catholic. They merely claimed control over books composed
by private individuals, and that solely with a view of pre-
venting the introduction of works of a dangerous tendency.
They never considered themselves bound to edit all books to
be used in their schools, and they might, as they did in
more than one instance, give their sanction to any books
already in use, provided they contained no objectionable
matter, and were desired by Local Patrons. The Commis-
sioners never thought it necessary or expedient to render the
use of any book compulsory. Local Patrons are vested
with the power of appointing and of dismissing teachers, the
Board merely reserving the power of fining or withdrawing
salary, in case patrons might wish to retain incompetent
teachers or persons who might refuse to observe the rules
and regulations of the Commissioners. As far as religious
instruction is concerned, out of the hours of secular teaching,
the Board grants every facility to pastors and teachers
authorised by the parents, and leaves this important duty
exclusively in the hands of those most deeply interested to
see it duly performed. These wise regulations, as well as
the general rules of the Board, received the unqualified ap-
probation of all Governments, no matter Avhat their political
principles might have been.
About this period an appeal was made to the public by
the Committee of the Church Education Society in Ireland.
In this appeal, the principles of the National System were
loudly assailed. The Committee refuse, they say, to co-
operate with the National Board on the following grounds:?*
Ist. On account of the constitution of the Board itself,
which not only deprived the clergy of the Established Church
of the trust committed to their hands by the Legislature, of
superintending National Education, but this superintendence
is taken from them for the purpose of being invested in a
Board composed of persons whose qualifications for the office
essentially consist in their being representatives of the most
conflicting religious opinions.? The Committee here make
a gratuitous assertion, that when the National Board was
established certain rights were taken from the Society and
transferred to the new Board. The clergy of the Established
Church enjoyed the exclusive privilege of superintending


the education of all classes, at a period long anterior to the
formation of the National Board, and at a time when, strange
as it may now appear, it was penal to dissent from the
Established Church, or to open a school without special leave
from the ordinary. Facts are sometimes stranger than fic-
tion. The Commissioners of National Education never
possessed, nor claimed the right of prescribing any special
course of religious instruction. They in all their acts so
cautiously avoided every thing in the shape of compulsion,
that their own books on secular instruction, superior as they
were to all others intended for that grade of instruction,
were offered to the public to be accepted or rejected on fair
and impartial examination. The clergy were called upon to
prescribe the religious ?the patrons the secular course, thus
circumscribing churchmen and laymen within their proper
limits. The Commissioners grant every facility, both as
regards secular and religious teaching, but they distinctly
refuse to any persuasion the power to use the right given to
them in favor of children of their own creed to the detriment
of others who may happen to differ from them in religious
belief. They refuse to the clergy the right of making use
of the public money as a means of violating the consciences
of the persons who have contributed a share of those taxes.
In a word, they will not sanction unfair interference with
parental authority.
The objection raised against the constitution of the Board,
if it has any weight, will apply much more forcibly to the
constitution of Parliament itself, which alone has the power
of making laws, and in which we find men of the most con-
flicting religious opinions, but with power to make laws even
for the Church itself.
The next objection is, that it is Impossible that any book,
for use in the schools, bearing however indirectly on re-
ligious questions, can receive the sanction of the Committee,
unless by the suppression of various points of divine truth,
essential perhaps in the estimation of some, but set aside
because displeasing to others. The Committee forgot that
a portion of the public money, subscribed by persons of all
religious persuasions, was confided to the care of a mixed
Board, on one condition only, that of being fairly employed
for the benefit of all. Ihe sanction of the Board is
required only for such books as are used in the common
instruction of children of all religious persuasions. It would
be a direct and flagrant violation of their compact if the
Commissioners sanctioned, in common instruction, the use of
any book which would enforce the particular religious views


of some in opposition to those of others. This would be to
act in direct opposition to a fundamental rule, proposed by
different Commissioners, and finally recommended by Go-
vernment itself.
The third reason assigned for refusing to co-operate with
the National Board was, that the sacred Scriptures were not
allowed to be read in the schools during the hours of general
and united instruction, and that no system could be sound
that would exempt any from the obligation of in-
struction therein. Lastly, they object and say that they
cannot, to sanction and to carry into effect the discipline of
Church of Rome, in restricting the use of the inspired
Writings. It was complained that the National System did
not permit that form of religious instruction to be forced
upon children whose parents objected to it. Here are the very
words : ?? Whatever such a system my be as regards those
whom it permits to receive such instruction, it is essentially
defective as regards those whom it permits to refuse it.?
The answer to this threadbare objection is apparent. If
there be any real defect, it must be traced to the law, ?it
must be looked for in that religious equality based upon the
law, and which I fear will in every clime be found unpalat-
able to religious monopolists. It must be looked for in
that sacred and inviolable right which every free constitu-
tion confers upon the parent by securing him from external
violence. The law gives the parent a right to act in reli-
gious matters as his conscience directs, and to object to this
prerogative is to arraign the law and not a system, which
only executes the mandates of that law which guarantees
alike the social and religious liberty of every subject, how-
ever humble. An objection of so presumptions a character
attacks at once the principle of Representative Government,
and the rights of individual liberty. The principle objected
to is the very one adopted in the Protestant University of
Dublin, of which the committee in general were members,
and in the government of which some of them took an
active part. The heads of the Dublin University, whilst
they provide for the religious instruction of members of the
Established Church, never interfere with the tenets of either
Catholics or Presbyterians. What right have they, on
principle, to make one law for the rich and another for the
poor, in the matter of religious instruction. It is a very
singular assertion, that not to enforce the reading of the
Scriptures is to enforce the discipline of the Church of Rome,
which only restricts the use of them. It might be retorted,
with equal sophistry, that not to make the particular formu-


laries of the Established Church obligatory, is to enforce
the principle of dissent, which rejects those formularies.
Such unfair objections are calculated to keep up in the minds
of the ignorant a spirit of opposition, and to destroy that
feeling of mutual confidence, harmony, and good-will, which
the very constitution of the National System tends so power-
fully to promote.
The next objection raised by the Committee was levelled
against the Scripture extracts, which they said were favorable
to Catholic doctrine, whilst in the same breath Catholics com-
plained that, in those compilations, their creed was unfairly
dealt with. It is a singular contradiction to object to a book,
and afterwards complain that the use of it is not made com-
pulsory. The conclusion to be drawn is that freedom is
the basis of the National, compulsion that of other systems.
The last objection raised by the Committee was, that
if they could even lay aside their other objections, the
National System is, in its practical working, calculated
to widen the breach already existing between the several
orders of religions in the country. This accusation aims
directly at the Government itself. It is the Government
that founded and recommended the National System, and
that appointed a number of men of high standing, and of
different religious persuasions, to administer that system.
The very character of the persons selected to discharge this
important trust, supplies tne strongest proof that they would
never undertake the office, had they not been thoroughly
convinced that the National System, in its practical opera-
tion, was calculated to produce just the opposite result?
that of bringing together children of various religions, and,
by a sound course of moral and intellectual education, of
preparing them in after life to discharge their various and
common duties as honest men and useful citizens. Children
are brought together to receive common instruction, in
order to fit them for those duties which they will be called
on to perform together, but they are not obliged to join in
those duties which, in after life, they will not have to dis-
charge in common, thus proving that religious differences
are not irreconcileable with social concord, and that, how-
ever widely men may disagree on subjects of religion, yet
they may live together in Christian charity as members of
the same social community.
In viewing impartially the different systems of education
introduced into Ireland, it should never be forgotten, that
the attempt to force children of various persuasions to join
in common religious instruction was the chief element of


failure. Though, according to the spirit of the National
System, no particular form of religious instruction is en-
forced against the express wish of parents and guardians,
yet the books of the Board contain a large amount of Scrip-
tural knowledge and various lessons on the subject of reli-
gion. There is no system of public instruction on the con-
tinent of Europe, and this I can assert from personal
experience, having been Professor in the University of France
for a considerable period, in which the books contain so many
and so well selected lessons on morality, religion, and social
duty. Our lesson books treat of original sin and the advent
of the Messiah, by whom sin was to be overcome, of the
covenant to Abraham, in which that promise was renewed.
They dwell at length on the law given to Moses, in its
triple division, and particularly on the moral portion, whose
duration is represented as perpetual, because the duties
which man owes to God are based on the fixed laws of
Christian morality. The high duties of Christian charity
are set forth by the precepts and example of our divine
Redeemer, and the <e general lesson? (to be hung up and read
in all schools), that epitome of everything good and elevated,
is taught to all without distinction. All this is taught as
revealed truth, and any unprejudiced judge will easily admit
that the inculcation of lessons such as I have recapitulated,
is any thing but calculated to ? widen the breach already
existing between the several orders of religion in the coun-
try, or of making children believe, according to the words of
the Committee, that ? however they may look on each other
as fellow-citizens, they cannot regard each other as fellow-
christians, who hold in common any principles of revealed
truth.? It will scarcely be believed that this Committee
practised themselves the very thing they objected to, by re-
quiring the sacred Scriptures to be taught to all, and the
formularies of the Church of England only to pupils of that
communion.
The highest dignitaries of the Established Church, with
the Protestant Primate at their head, when called on by a
Government Commission to advise on this subject, strongly
recommended the very principle upon which the present
National System is based, as the only one to which grants
of public money could be made with success and advantage
to the country. Having carefully reviewed the parochial
schools then existing, and which were exclusively under the
direction of the Established Church, they concluded by
saying, ? We are fully persuaded of their inadequacy as a
system of general education for the poor, even if it were


practicable to establish an effective one in every union.? The
Church Education Society, in condemning the principles of
the National System, condemned the formal decisions and re-
commendations of the highest dignitaries of their own church.
Passion, prejudice, and bigotry will lead to any inconsis-
tency in human conduct.
Let us now examine and see if there be any reason why
a system, so eminently successful in Ireland, and which, by
its intrinsic merit, superseded all pre-existing forms of pub-
lic instruction in that country, should not be equally, and,
let me add, more peculiarly suited to the circumstances of
this colony. The opponents of the National System here?
some from ignorance, others from design, assert that the
fundamental principles of the system are not the same in this
colony as at home. Let not the public of Victoria be de-
ceived, either by ignorance, misrepresentation, or sectarian
intolerance. I challenge the most inveterate opponent to
point out the slightest shade of difference, either in the
spirit of the system, in the mode of administering and
applying it, here and at home; and, on the instant, I
abandon my feeble advocacy of National Education. There
is nothing in the climate or constitution of this colony ?
nothing in the circumstances and independent feelings of
the people of Victoria, ?that would induce them to reject a
system, whose fundamental principle is justice and fair play
to all, which does not exclude children of any denomination,
and which will admit, without doing violence to the con-
science of any, children of every creed who may wish for
education.
It is objected, that the National System is not adapted to
towns, though permits it might do in country districts;
because, they say, in the former there is a sufficiently large
and mixed population to enable every denomination to
support a separate school. To admit this interested fallacy,
would strike at once at the very root of the National
System: for the more mixed the school, the better can the
principles of the National System be tested. We have the
strongest proof in our National schools in Ireland, in con-
nection with Poor-law Unions, in which we find children of
the three religions of the country, in equal proportion
according to their numbers in the population, and the
guardians of which institutions are of different religious
persuasions, that wherever the National System is fairly
and impartially administered, that there, it is sure to bring
forth the best fruit.
It is also erroneously asserted, that the National schools


m Ireland have degenerated into denominational institutions.
Ims is not stating the fact fairly. It must not be forgotten
that there was so strong opposition given to the introduction
ot the National System in Ireland, by the landed proprietors
?the great majority of whom were of the Established
Church- the patrons of National education were, therefore,
unable to obtain sites to build school-houses, and were com-
pelled to place them within the precincts of their churches
or chapels, thus necessity giving these institutions an
apparently denominational character. It must also be borne
in mind, that, though the population is mixed, yet there are
certain districts where whole tracts are inhabited by persons
ot one persuasion?some where there are no Protestants,
others where there are no Catholics, to be found. The
JNational System was never intended to deal with exceptional
cases, or with local accidents. Where those accidents do
occur, the Board would not be justified in withholding the
benefits of education from an entire district, provided it be
thoroughly understood that the school be open to children
of all denominations, whenever they may apply for admission.
It is not accident, but principle, which must be universal in
its application, that the Board contemplates.
I have now explained the real principles and fundamental
imes of the National System : and I confidently leave it to
t le good sense and justice of the people of this independent
colony, to decide what system of public education, National
01 Benommational, supplies the best and largest amount of
secular instruction, and offers the surest guarantee that the
sacred rights of conscience shall not be interfered with.
v < e^t rao dinary objection has been made to our practice
0 dividing the children into sections, each containing but
one religious denomination, on the days and at the hours set
apart for religious instruction. What would our adversaries
say, it we adopted a different plan, and obliged all indis-
criminately to be present at the same form of religious
exercise ? Who would be the instructor, in such a Sise ?
It a Church of England teacher, will not the Catholic and
Presbyterian alike reject his guidance in religious matters?
Ihe former will say, ? I fear your exposition of the doctrines
of transubstantiation and of purgatory would not coincide
with the teaching I have been accustomed to;? whilst the
Piesbyterian, in all likelihood, would refuse to exchange
his Catechism for the Thirty-nine Articles. Let the
objectors come and see, and they will find that the children
at our schools, if they ever reason on the matter, give this
practice the same fair interpretation that it justly merits.


There is no more reason why children at onr schools should
learn a lesson of enmity to each other, because they are
drafted at certain hours into separate rooms, to receive a
lesson separately, which it would be a violation of the rights
of conscience to force upon them in common, than that two
bosom friends, meeting in the streets on Sunday, should
quarrel because one takes the road to St. Peter's, the other
to St. Francis?s. Such an objection proves the author equally
clever at theology as at logic. The objection, if it had any
weight, would involve a most comprehensive conclusion, for
it would establish the necessity of only one church. All
these futile objections prove to demonstration that the
National System is the only one which protects, without
distinction, children of all persuasions, from undue inter-
ference in religious matters, and, at the same time, gives
parents and pastors the fullest opportunity of having
children of their persuasion receive the form of religious
instruction which they themselves adopt and approve of.
The Massachusetts and Canadian systems of education
have been recommended for adoption in this colony; the
former being advocated by the Age, the latter by the Argus.
In comparing the principles upon which the Massachusetts
and Prussian systems are founded, it will easily be seen that
they differ in no essential point. Let it also be remembered
that from the latter of these, the Irish National System has
been principally derived. The chief difference between
these two systems and the Irish, consists in local taxation
for the special purposes of education, and the fact of
making the attendance of children compulsory. If the
condition of Ireland had been sufficiently prosperous to
authorise the imposing of this additional tax, it would in all
likelihood have been levied. The British Government
thought that any additional local burdens would weigh too
heavily, and probably would be rather injurious than useful
to the spread of primary education. Guided, therefore, by
the state of the country, they resolved to cover the expenses
of education from the general fund. Local taxation cannot,
by possibility, affect the real principle of the National
System. The principle continues the same ; the difference
consists in the special mode of applying it.
With regard to Canada, the principles of the Irish National
System have long been adopted in that country. Some years
ago, the Government of Canada applied to the Irish Board
of Education, to send out one of their officers, to take a part
in the direction of primary education. One of the head-
inspectors was selected by the commissioners, and has since


*
been, in Canada, the representative of the same principles
of National education, as those he so efficiently represented
at home.
I cannot conclude without expressing my deep regret,
that the clergy, generally speaking, have not yet thought
proper to lend us their co-operation in the great work of
National Education. We have more than once invited them,
and we here renew the invitation in all earnestness, to come
and assist us. They are fully aware that every facility
be afforded them in the discharge of their sacred dutwis.
They must also be aware that a secular teacher is not a
qualified religious instructor, and that, in some cases, it may
be unsafe to confide to him, unaided and unguided, the sole
direction of youth in the all-important concerns of religion.
I confidently hope the clergy will take this important matter
into consideration, and will see that it is consistent with duty
to impart religious instruction in a National School, even
though the principles upon which the secular system is based
may not altogether meet their approval. Secular teachers
have a right to the guidance of the clergy of their own creed
in religious matters. Let the clergy then come and relieve
the teacher from the responsibility of functions which arc
not his by right. He will, if under qualified and legal
direction, assist in giving religious instruction; and will
teach with increased confidence and security, because he
knows, that if he feel either doubt or scruple, he has a
tribunal at hand to which he can easily and safely appeal.
