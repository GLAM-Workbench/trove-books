Preface
r I s HIS little book might be called " The Cartoonist's
A Who's Who in Sydney." The plan of its publishers
was to issue a booklet that would be a valued souvenir.
The publishers have tried to pick out the representative
citizens in the political, professional, financial, commercial,
and sporting circles, obtain good portraits of them, and
print the portraits with suitable embellishments by the pen
and ink artists, in such a style as to remind the subjects
and their friends, now and in the future, of what they are
and what are their occupations —and their idiosyncracies.
We think that all will enjoy turning the pages of this book,
and as the years go by, the value of this little souvenir of
" Sydneyites " will steadily increase
