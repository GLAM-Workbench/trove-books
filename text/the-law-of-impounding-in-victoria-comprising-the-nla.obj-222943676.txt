PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
r PHIS little work will, it is hoped, be found of some
practical use to the profession, as no work is in
existence here dealing solely with the subject of which it
treats.
It is, however, intended ehietty as a guide to pound-
keepers, municipal councils, squatters, farmers, and other’s,
who, in the author’s experience, have invariably found an
almost insuperable difficulty in reconciling a tangible Act
of Parliament regulating the impounding of trespassing
cattle with the abstract right to impound which is given
only by the common law.
Kyneton,
25th Jan., 1896.


PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.
r T 11E gratifying reception accorded to this little book
• exhausted the first edition shortly after its publication,
and it has been for some time out of print. The continued
demand has called for the present edition ; and in this the
notes to the sections have been carefully revised and mostly
re-written, with a view to bringing the work completely up
to date. Also, for the convenience of laymen, the Introduc-
tion has been considerably amplified ’ and is unencumbered
by the names of the cases referred to, all of which can,
however, be readily identified with the notes by means of
the Index.

THE
LAW OF IMPOUNDING
IN VICTORIA.
INTRODUCTION.
The remedy of impounding, or distress for
damage feasant, existed in England long
before the N’ormail Conquest. It appears to have
been originally derived from the northern nations
of Europe, among whom it existed at an early
period in its simplest and most primitive form,
viz., the seizure of a trespassing animal, and
the detention of it until compensation was made
by its owner for the damage done. The use of
the pound—penfold or poundfold—as a place or

feasant remains almost the same as at common
law.
The Pound.— At common law a pound means
a place or enclosure, either overt {e.g., an open
yard or paddock) or covert {e.g., a covered shed
or building) selected by the distrainor of tres-
passing cattle at his own discretion and at his
own risk for the safe keeping of the cattle or
goods distrained ; Bla. Com. 111. 12. By our
statute law a pound is a place appointed to
be a pound by the Governor-in-Council if the
place be not within a municipality, or by the
council of a municipality if the place be within
a municipal district (sec. 4), and notified as
such in the Government Gazette. A copy of
the Gazette notifying the establishment of a
pound is primd facie evidence that such pound
was duly established (sec. 27), but that is not
the only evidence ; and it is not necessary that
the limits of a pound be proclaimed.
Pound fees are fixed by the Act(Schedule II);
and sustenance fees payable in respect of the
sustenance of impounded cattle, and trespass
rates payable to the impounder as compensation
for damage done, are fixed by the council of the
municipality controlling the pound (sec. 9). The

Act, together with the name of the poundkeeper,
must be painted in white letters on a black
ground on a board kept erected on the gate or
other conspicuous part of the pound (sec. 19).
The pound must be kept in a fit state to
receive cattle brought to be impounded. At
common law, if the usual pound is in an unfit
state a person who distrains cattle must find
another, for he is bound to see that the pound
to which he takes the distress is in a fit state to
receive it, and he would be liable for any damage
caused thereby to the cattle distrained. In
Victoria, however, it is assumed that the common
law rule would be controlled by the necessity of
placing the distress in the nearest accessible
proclaimed pound, as the distrainor is not per-
mitted to place them in any other.
A pound may at any time be abolished or
removed; and all expenses of establishing,
maintaining, removing or repairing a pound are
payable by the municipality controlling it (sec.
7). Destroying or injuring, or attempting to i
destroy or injure, a pound is an offence against
the Act (sec. 30). Pound breach, or the break-
ing of a pound or any part of it and retaking
cattle after they are impounded, is not included
as an offence under the Act, but is a misde-
meanor at common law.

appointed for every pound, and if the pound is
within a municipality he is appointed by the
council controlling the pound, in the same man-
ner as its other officers are appointed ; and the
council also has power to suspend or remove
him (sec. 5). He is an officer of the municipality
under whose control the pound is maintained,
but at the same time he is a public official
named in a legislative enactment, whose duties
are prescribed by the Act, and who is required
to perform those duties under the Act (sec. 6).
He is not bound to produce his appointment to
persons impounding cattle as evidence of his
right to receive them into the pound ; the fact
of his acting in that capacity is sufficient. He
is to be paid by a fixed salary out of the muni-
cipal fund of the municipality, and is not per-
mitted to be remunerated by fees (sec. 5).
He is bound to take and keep whatever cattle
are brought to him, at the peril of the person
who brings it, and is not answerable whether
they are legally impounded or not; the im-
pounder, and not the poundkeeper, is the person
responsible. He is to receive the pound fees
fixed by the Act (sec. 8), and also the sustenance
fees and trespass rates (sec. 9). The sustenance
fees are payable in respect of sustenance in the
pound of impounded cattle, as fixed under the
Act, and are payable in respect of impounded
cattle, even though the poundkeeper has not

been at any expense in providing sustenance for
them. The trespass rates, also fixed under the
Act, are payable in the first instance to the
poundkeeper, who holds them as a stakeholder,
subject to the provisions of the Act (sec. 11).
An additional trespass rate not exceeding Five
pounds per head is chargeable in respect of the
trespass of entire horses, bulls and rams (sec. 10).
Any person impounding cattle must give to the
poundkeeper a written memorandum specifying
the description, number, brands and marks of
the cattle, the place where they were found
trespassing (which must be clearly defined, so
as to enable their owner to find the place without
difficulty), the damages claimed for trespass, and,
if known, the name of the owner of the cattle
(sec. 16). If excessive damages are claimed the
owner of the cattle must pay them, and may
then proceed to recover from the impounder the
excess paid (sec. 26). The omission of any part
of this requirement will not, however, constitute
illegal impounding, though it might be an offence
under sec. 30 (viii).
The poundkeeper is to keep a pound book in
the form of Schedule IV to the Act, with
proper entries, and this book is to be open for
inspection to the public on payment of a small
fee, and to a justice or a member of the police
force free of charge (sec. 18). Entries in this’
book may be proved by a certified extract giving

the essential particulars; the book itself need
not be put in evidence. If an animal is not
impounded in the prescribed manner the pound-
keeper should not insert the fact in his pound
book, for if the law has not been complied with
the animal is not “ impounded,” though it may
be placed in the pound.
The poundkeeper is required to receive and
detain impounded cattle in his custody until
the fees and trespass rates are paid (in default
of which they may be sold), or until he receives
an order from the justices under section 26, or
an order for their release from the impounder
(sec. 20). The pound must be kept in a fit state
to receive impounded cattle, as persons im-
pounding cattle have no option of placing them
in any other than the nearest accessible pro-
claimed pound to the place where the cattle
were found trespassing.
The poundkeeper is also required on payment
of a fee to register the brands of any cattle with
the name and address of the owner, and if any
of such cattle are impounded at any time he is
to give notice of the impounding to the registered
owner (sec. 21), so that the owner may know
when any of his cattle are impounded.
Cattle impounded and not released are to be
sold by auction at the pound after the time and
in the manner prescribed by the Act, the pound


keeper acting as auctioneer (sec. 22); and he is
to apply the proceeds of sale as directed by
section 24. If there be no purchaser at the
sale the cattle are to be destroyed (sec. 23), and
the carcasses disposed of.
The provisions of the Act are very severe in
respect to offences by the poundkeeper, which
are enumerated in section 28, he being liable on
conviction for any offence against the Act to a
penalty not exceeding fifty pounds, or imprison-
ment for any period not exceeding six months,
or both. If he is charged with neglecting to
supply impounded cattle with proper sustenance,
it lies upon him to prove that proper sustenance
was supplied ; and in case any of the cattle are
lost from the custody of the poundkeeper, they
are deemed to have been lost through his negli-
gence, unless he prove the contrary (sec. 29).
Failing to supply proper sustenance to im-
pounded cattle is an offence against the Act, but
a poundkeeper is also liable at common law for
keeping cattle in an unfit pound, or neglecting
to properly sustain them.
The Right of Impounding. —The authority to .
impound cattle damage feasant ( i.e ., doing dam- 1
age to a crop or grass by feeding or otherwise)
is derived solely from the common law. It is
not a right given by Statute, except in certain
cases where the common law does not apply,

such as trespass on streets or roads. An occu-
pier of land adjoining a road which is properly
fenced on both sides has a statutory right to
impound cattle wandering without control on
such road (sec. 17) ; and the council of a muni-
cipality may, under secs. 408 and 409 of the
Local Government Act, impound any cattle driven
along or on any street or road for the purpose
of grazing without the consent of the council.
A distress damage feasant (i.e., a seizure for
the purpose of impounding) is different from a
distress for rent. In the latter case a man may
distrain any cattle he finds on the premises ; in
the former the cattle can only be distrained for
the damage they are actually doing.
At common law, the right of distress damage
feasant is founded on the principle of recompense,
which justifies a person in detaining that which
occasions the injury to his property, until
amends be made by the owner : Bullen on
Distress. By the common law of England the
law allows a man to be his own avenger, or to
minister redress to himself in the case of
another’s cattle damage feasant or trespassing
on his land, by distraining them ; Bla. Com. 111.
5. The law regards cattle distrained damage

or satisfaction of the damage done, over which

them until satisfaction is made. The distress is
the remedy given at common law ; any power of
sale subject thereto is added by Act of Parlia-
ment: Bla. Com. 111. 10, 14. If a stranger’s
■cattle are found damage feasant on the land of
another without his leave or licence, and without
any default or negligence of the owner of the
land, such owner may at common law distrain or
impound the cattle so found, and may detain
them until he is paid or tendered a fair com-
pensation for the injury. An occupier of land
may distrain cattle by night as well as by day,
■otherwise the cattle may be gone before he can
take them : Co. Litt. 142 a.
Before any impounding Act existed in Vic- [
toria a person in possession of land could under
the common law impound cattle damage feasant,
and the present Act contains no express nega-
tive words to take away the common law right of
the actual occupier to impound for trespass. In
fact, the common law right remains, except in
certain cases where it is done away with. The
Act merely limits, and in some case extends, the
right existing at common law. It is only neces-
sary for a defendant to set uj) and prove his
■common law right, and then if the plaintiff
would rely upon any statutory limitation he
must reply it. The defendant might then be
liable to a penalty, but he would not be a
trespasser.
Common law
right in Victoria.


Thus an occupier of land may, in the absence
of any enactment to the contrary, seize and
drive off or impound cattle damage feasant, or
may drive them to a convenient place for the
owner and so far detain them. A seizure at
common law necessarily implies some detention,
and cattle seized damage feasant may be detained
for a reasonable time before being taken to the
pound. It is not necessary that cattle seized for
the purpose of impounding should be conveyed
to the pound immediately and without delay.
No time is expressly provided by the Act, and
the general rule is applicable that where no
time is prescribed for doing an act directed to
be done it must be done at and within a reason-
able time. The onus of showing that the
detention was reasonable is on the defendant,
who has to establish full compliance with the
Act. If cattle are detained for upwards of
three days in any place not being a proclaimed
pound the distrainor can claim no damages in
respect of the trespass (sec. 13), and though the
original seizure may have been lawful the
detention would be a wrong.
It is absolutely necessary, whether under the
common law or under the Act, that cattle tres-
passing be seized only for the purpose of
impounding. They must be taken to the
nearest accessible proclaimed pound (sec. 16);

is the only act which constitutes the offence of
illegal impounding. This does not necessarily
mean the nearest pound, but the nearest acces-
sible pound to the place trespassed upon, i.e.,
the actual spot where the cattle trespassed by
feeding without authority. The object of the
section is for the protection of the owner of the
cattle, not of the person impounding, so that
the owner may know where to look for them ;
and the question what is the nearest accessible
pound is one of fact for the justices in each par-
ticular case, and may be determined by a
consideration of the relative convenience to the
person impounding of driving trespassing cattle
to one or other of the pounds to which he has
access.
An occupier of land impounding cattle must
give to the poundkeeper a written memorandum
specifying the particulars before mentioned
(sec. 16). Non-compliance with this direction
is not within the offence of illegal impounding
created by section 30 (hi), but may constitute
an offence under section 30 (viii). The descrip-
tion of the place of trespass to be specified in
the memorandum must be sufficiently clear to
enable the owner of the trespassing cattle to
find the place without difficulty. The name of
a town has been held to be sufficient, but not
the name of a district, nor does the heading of
the memorandum with an address as in a letter

sufficiently specify the place where the cattle
were found trespassing.
It does not matter to whom the cattle dis-
trained belong, if they be really trespassing.
They may be taken damage feasant although
they came on the land without the owner’s
knowledge or consent, or by the default of an-
other ; and it is necessary that the distrainor
actually get into the locus in quo before the
cattle set out of it. The distress must be taken
in the act of trespassing, at the time the damage
was done ; if the damage was done yesterday
the distress cannot be taken today. And even
if the owner of the trespassing cattle, before
they are seized, drives them out within view of
the land-owner, they cannot afterwards be dis-
trained, even though they were driven out
purposely to avoid being seized,
A horse in a cart in the actual use of a person
cannot be distrained damage feasant; nor can
any animal which is under the immediate con-
trol of its owner ; nor a horse if there is a rider
on it, even though the man rides over the crop
of another ; nor a horse being led by a person
at the time, or otherwise under his personal care,
and being actually used by him ; but sheep in
charge of a shepherd may ,be seized and im-
pounded, though they have trespassed without
the knowledge or even against the wish of the
shepherd.
Ownership of
distrained cattle.
What cannot be
distrained.


If several cattle are trespassing an occupier
cannot take one of them, and claim trespass
damage for the whole ; he can only take the
one beast for its own damage.
A person distraining cattle damage feasant is
not at liberty to work or use a distrained beast;
but milch kine may be milked. He must also,
while the cattle are in his custody, provide them
with proper food and water.
Goats, pigs and geese trespassing may be
destroyed (sec. 15), and it is not necessary that
they shall be killed instantaneously ; but the Act
applies only to these animals, and not to dogs or
domestic fowls. Goats and pigs are within the
interpretation of “ cattle ” under the Act (sec. 3),
and may, therefore, in the discretion of the
occupier, be either impounded or destroyed.
Restoration of Trespassing Cattle. —An |
occupier who finds cattle trespassing on his land
may instead of impounding them restore them
to their owner, and may then demand and
recover from the owner the amount of any
trespass rates which would be payable under the
Act if the cattle were impounded. Only the
occupier of land has this privilege ; an owner of
land who is not an occupier has no rights in this
respect (sec. 12). And it is only the owner of;
the cattle who can be sued for the trespass rates ; 1

or station, who is non-resident, is not liable for
a penalty incurred by the trespass. But if a
superintendent of a station acted throughout in
his own name, and not in that of the owner, he
would be liable.
A formal demand of the trespass rate from
the owner of the cattle is not necessary, nor is it
a condition precedent to the recovery of the
trespass rates. The acts of trespass and restora-
tion in themselves give rise to a present claim
or demand, which the restorer of the cattle may
proceed to enforce without any preliminary
steps ; the making of a complaint (i.e., the issue
and service of a summons) is in itself a sufficient
demand, as it is in the case of a debt or demand
for goods sold and delivered.
It is not for the occupier of the land to assess
the amount of compensation when he restores
the cattle ; it is the duty of the owner of the
distrained cattle to assess and tender to the
occupier of the land compensation for the
damage done by the cattle, as he is the wrong-
doer in the first instance.
In restoring cattle under section 12 it is not
necessary to deliver them to the owner person-
ally ; delivery to an overseer or agent is
sufficient, but on the hearing of a complaint for
recovery and trespass rates the justices must
satisfy themselves that the person who took

delivery of the cattle on their restoration was
an overseer or agent with authority to receive
them. In cases where the cattle are wild and
unmanageable they will be sufficiently restored
to their owner if they are replaced to his know-
ledge in a field or paddock occupied by him ; but
if they are so unmanageable that the distrainor
cannot get them out of his paddock and into that
of the owner, this would not be a restoration.
If cattle are restored to their owner before
impounding upon a promise by their owner to
pay what is due on them the justices have no
power to order special damages above the ordi-
nary rates; they are limited to the trespass
rates fixed under the Act. But the distrainor ;
may, if he choose, proceed in the County Court
for damages for the trespass in lieu of demand-
ing the trespass rates under the Act before the
justices, for section 12 does not take away the
jurisdiction of the County Court to award
damages.
A distrainor may in the alternative proceed j
under section 59 (4) of the Justices Act for'
damages for trespass by cattle in cases where
trespass rates have been fixed, if the rates so
fixed do not in the opinion of the Court afford
sufficient compensation to the complainant for
such trespass, provided the total damages shall
not exceed £5O. This proceeding cannot,

however, be taken if the cattle have been
impounded; it is only available after restoration
under section 12.
Tender of Amends. —Closely allied to the
authority to restore trespassing cattle under
section 12 is the right of the owner of cattle
seized for the purpose of impounding, but not
actually impounded, to tender payment of the
trespass rates fixed under the Act, and obtain
delivery of the cattle seized (sec. 14). This is
merely a re-enactment of the common law right.
But the cattle must have been seized for the
purpose of impounding, and the amount to be
tendered must be the trespass rate fixed under
the Act, even though the parties may have
agreed between themselves to a higher rate.
A refusal to return the cattle on tender of the
proper amount is an offence against the Act.
Tender of amends cannot be made after the
cattle are impounded, even though they have
been wrongfully taken ; and if a tender be legally
made after seizure and before impounding, the
detainer after the tender is unlawful. Detaining
cattle after payment of the trespass rates and
subsequently impounding them does not, how-
ever, constitute illegal impounding under the
Act; though it may be a wrongful detention
and a wrongful impounding at common law,
giving a right of action to the owner of the cattle.
Tender of

Cattle seized damage feasant may not be de-
tained without impounding for more than three
days, otherwise no damages for trespass will be
recoverable from the owner (sec. 13). This con-
templates cattle being impounded as at common
law, without being in the custody of the pound-
keeper, and without going to the common pound,
and the time of such detention in a private place
is limited to three days.
If cattle have trespassed on one day and have
gone off the land, and trespassed again at an-
other time, and are then seized for the purpose
of impounding, and the owner tenders the tres-
pass rates for the latter damage, the distrainor
is bound to let them go ; he cannot detain them
for the first damage, as they were not then taken
in the act of trespassing.
Illegal Impounding. — The words “illegal im- 1
pounding ” are used in the Act in two different
aspects, viz., in section 26 and in section 30 (iii).
In the former section the proceedings authorised
in respect of illegal impounding are in the nature
of a civil remedy ; under sec. 30 (iii) they are
for an offence. It will be well to consider them
separately, in order to avoid any confusion that
might arise owing to the same words having
been inserted in the two sections. And it must 1:
be remembered that though this expression
“ illegal impounding ” is used in one section

quasi-criminallj and in the other section civilly,
the words are held to bear the same meaning in
each : i.e., the interpretation of “ illegal impound-
ing ” is the same in both sections.
First, as a civil remedy :—Under section 26,
which provides for a remedy in damages, it has
been held that illegal impounding can only be
for sending cattle to a pound not being the
nearest accessible pound, or for impounding
cattle not liable to be impounded at all. There
are only these two kinds of illegal impounding
in respect of which damages can be awarded.
Under the former Pounds Act the word
“ illegal ” meant illegal by non-conformity with
the requirements of the Act as to the modus
operandi prescribed by it. Under the present
Act it means contrary to the provisions of the
particular Act—not unjustifiable. A marked
distinction is shown between the proceedings
under section 26 and those under section 30 (iii)
in that the notice to the poundkeeper on re-
leasing the cattle seized (sec. 25) is a condition
precedent to seeking the civil remedy, and the
complaint for damages must be made within ten
days after service of the notice; whereas on an
information under section 30 (iii), seeking
enforcement of a penalty, it is not necessary
that proof of the notice to the poundkeeper
under section 25 should be given, and there is
no limitation as to time.

Under present
Act.


Sections 25 and 26, then, deal only with
irregularities in impounding, and not with
illegal impounding as an offence. These sections
confer a civil jurisdiction upon justices with
power to award compensation in three cases,
viz., (1) where there has been an illegal im-
pounding under the Act by the impounder, (2)
where there has been an illegal impounding
under the common law if the cattle were not
trespassing, and (3) where there has been a
demand of excessive trespass rates by the im-
pounder. The first of these matters of complaint
also constitutes an offence under section 30 (iii),
but that section, dealing with an offence and
not a civil claim, provides a punishment and not
a remedy. The illegality of impounding cattle
not liable to be impounded is not “ illegal im-
pounding under this Act,” and, therefore, is not
the subject of an information under section 30
(iii). The civil remedy is provided by sections j
25 and 26. The owner, if he succeeds, obtains
an order in his favour against the impounder,
and by means of that order he can obtain from
the poundkeeper the trespass rates, which are
retained to abide the order. The distinction
between a person seeking damages for some
irregularity and a person proceeding for a penal
conviction, must be kept clear. In one case he
seeks compensation for a civil remedy ; in the
other he prosecutes for an offence against the
public.

The circumstances under which the owner of
impounded cattle may give notice of complaint
under section 25 are “ that such impounding
was illegal under this Act,” and “ that the rates
demanded for the trespass of such cattle are
excessive.” These two are the only causes of
complaint mentioned in section 25, and a com-
plaint under section 26 can only be made in
pursuance of the notice required by section 25.
By virtue of section 26, however, the justices
may also find that “ the cattle were not tres-
passing,” in addition to their jurisdiction to deal
with complaints for illegal impounding and
charging excessive trespass rates. Thus the
owner can only enter his complaint in two
instances, yet the justices have jurisdiction to
decide in three, including the question whether
the cattle were or were not trespassing when
impounded.
It is now settled that damages may be
awarded to the owner of cattle illegally im-
pounded, whether the illegality arises out of a
breach of the Act, or is merely a wrong at
common law, in that the cattle were not tres-
passing when impounded. The words “under
this Act” are left out of the latter part of
section 26, and the words “ illegal impounding ”
only are used, and therefore the justices may
make an order for damages for illegally impound-

ing, whether the illegality is under the Act or
the common law.
The jurisdiction of the justices to award
compensation, therefore; may be regarded as
extending to cases (1) where the cattle were not
trespassing, (2) where the impounding was illegal
either under the Act or at common law, and
(3) where the trespass rates demanded are
excessive. We need not now consider the last
case.
(i). Where the cattle were not trespassing : 1
Under the common law cattle can only be dis-
trained damage feasant, and therefore cattle
which are not trespassing cannot legally be im-
pounded. The impounding of such cattle, how-
ever, does not constitute illegal impounding
“ under the Act ” —it is an unlawful act at com-
mon law, and for this, viz,, impounding cattle
not liable to be impounded, a remedy is pro-
vided in section 26, though the owner is not
compelled to avail himself of the statutory
remedy alone. In the case of Robertson v.
Main, Fellows, J. held that there are only two
kinds of illegal impounding, viz., where the
cattle were not sent to the nearest accessible
pound, and where the cattle were not liable to
be impounded at all. This decision was followed
by Higinbotham, C.J., in McLaurin v. Griffin,
in which case he held that the only questions
which the justices could decide under section 26

were : whether the cattle were or were not
trespassing ; whether the impounding was or was
not illegal by reason of the cattle having been
impounded in a pound not being the nearest
accessible pound ; and whether the trespass rates
demanded for the trespass of the cattle were or
were not excessive ; and that it was only in one
or more of these cases that compensation could
be awarded by the summary mode of procedure
to the owner of the cattle. These rulings have
been followed by Hood, J., in McLean v. Der-
harn, in which he held that for the purposes of
awarding compensation illegal impounding under
this section means both illegal impounding under
the Act and illegal impounding at common law.
(n). Where the impounding was illegal:—•
Illegal impounding under section 26, as under
section 30 (iii), has been held to be constituted
only by sending trespassing cattle to a pound
not being the nearest accessible pound to the
place of trespass ; but this refers only to illegal
impounding “ under the Act.” The decisions
just quoted have established that illegal im-
pounding under the latter part of section 26 is
constituted by impounding cattle illegally either
under the Act or at common law. The impound-
ing of cattle not liable to be impounded is not
illegal impounding “ under the Act,” but it is
an illegality at common law, and the ruling of
the Court is that though an impounder of cattle

can only be complained against for illegal im-
pounding “under the Act,” yet by virtue of the
section damages may be awarded for illegal
impounding whether under the Act or at com-
mon law. The justices may find that the cattle
were not trespassing, and may make an order
for damages sustained by the owner in conse-
quence of the illegality at common law.
As to damages :—These can be awarded under
section 26 only in two cases —where the im-
pounding has been illegal (under the Act or at
common law), and where the impounder has
demanded excessive trespass rates. In these
cases the owner of the cattle must give to the
poundkeeper notice in writing of his intention
to complain—sometimes wrongly called a pro-
test —and he must follow up his notice by making
his complaint within ten days.
The wording of section 26, tied as it is to sec- j
tion 25, is very vague. Section 25 provides that
in two events an owner of cattle impounded may
give notice of complaint, viz., if the impounding
is illegal under the Act, and if excessive trespass
rates are demanded. Under section 26, how-
ever, the justices may find in three events, viz.,
either of the two in respect of which notice is
necessary, and, in addition, that the cattle were
not trespassing. Following on in the same
section they may award damages for (l) illegal
Damages.
Conflict between
the two sections.


impounding, not specifically stated to be illegal
impounding under the Act—and (2) for demand
of excessive trespass rates. Thus we have a
conflict between sections 25 and 26, and a further
conflict between the earlier and the latter por-
tions of section 26. What, then, will constitute
illegal impounding ? In the first part of section
26, the expression being “ illegal impounding
under this Act,” this has long ago been defined as
impounding cattle elsewhere than in the nearest
accessible pound, and that only; but in the latter
part of the section the words “ under this Act ”
are omitted, and the Court, fortified by earlier
decisions, appears to have seized on this point
and assumed that the Legislature intended to
give jurisdiction to the justices to award dam-
ages for impounding cattle which were not
trespassing ; in other words, to apply the mean-
ing of illegal impounding not only to illegal
impounding under the Act, but under the com-
mon law as well. The section is obscure and
loosely drawn, but the Court has no doubt
rightly judged the intention of the Legislature
rather by deduction of what was intended to be
the wording of the section than by a literal
interpretation of it.
Secondly, as an offence : —There is no distinc-
tion between the words “illegal impounding ” in
section 30 (iii) and the same words in the first
part of section 26. Under the former section,
Illegal
impounding as
an offence.


however, the meaning is more limited, and the
proceeding is for a conviction for an offence
against the public.
The offence of illegal impounding is created
for the first time by section 30 (iii). Under
the old Acts illegal impounding was not an
offence ; it merely gave a civil remedy, as it
does now under section 26. Here it is a penal
offence. Illegal impounding under section 30
(iii) means impounding trespassing cattle in a
pound not being the nearest accessible pound to
the place where they were found trespassing.
There can be no other illegal impounding under
the Act. Section 16 prohibits cattle from being
impounded except in the nearest accessible
pound ; therefore cattle cannot be illegally im-
pounded under section 30 (iii) except in a pound
that is not the nearest accessible pound. That
constitutes the illegal impounding which is made
an offence by the Act.
In proceeding for a conviction under section
30 (iii) strict proof is not required to be given
of service of the notice to the poundkeeper
under section 25, as by neglecting to give such
notice the complainant only deprives himself of
the right to claim from the poundkeeper the
trespass rates paid to or retained by him ; neither
is the time limited within which proceedings
may be taken. The word “complaint ” and not
“information” is certainly used in section 30,
Created by sec.
80 (iii).

but notwithstanding this the proceeding is for
an offence against the Act.
Thus it will be seen that, though illegal im-
pounding means the same thing in both sections
26 and 30 (iii), yet the procedure under the
two sections is entirely different; the first being
an action on the civil side of the Court to re-
cover damages, and the second being an informa-
tion seeking a conviction for an offence which
has been regarded as so serious as to incur upon
conviction either a penalty or imprisonment, or
both.
The interpretation of the two sections may
therefore be summed up as follows : —lllegal
impounding rendering the impounder liable on
conviction to a penalty (sec. 30 (iii)) is only
created by placing distrained cattle elsewhere
than in the nearest accessible pound ; illegal
impounding rendering the impounder liable to
damages (sec. 26) is created by placing distrained
cattle elsewhere than in the nearest accessible
pound, or by impounding cattle not liable to be
impounded at all.
Rescue and Pound Breach. —Rescuing or
attempting to rescue cattle impounded or seized
for the purpose of being impounded is an offence
under section 30 (i), and is also an offence at
common law. Rescue under the Act is to be
interpreted in the same manner as at common
Procedure.
Interpretation
of the two
sections.
Rescue.


law, and is the forcible taking of cattle dis-
trained before they are impounded out of the
possession of some individual in whose custody
they are by law. Rescue at common law must
be made by the owner of the cattle or his agent,
and not by a stranger, but under the Act the
offence will apply to any person other than the
poundkeeper. If cattle stray from the custody
of the distrainor he may retake them wherever
he finds them, without incurring the penalty
attached to the offence of rescue, but he must
not break the peace; Co. Litt. 47b, 160 b.
To constitute rescue there must be something
amounting to a breach of the peace, or likely to
provoke a breach of the peace, and a taking of
the cattle in the presence of the keeper. Thus,
if the poundkeeper places distrained cattle in a
paddock at a distance from the pound after they
have been impounded, and the owner lets down
the slip rails and takes them out, this is not a
rescue ; nor is it a rescue if the cattle get away
from the distrainor end escape into the owner’s
yard and remain there for a time, from which
the distrainor takes them to his own yard, as
the trespass is thereby abandoned.
Pound Breach:—Pound breach is not included 1
as an offence under the Act, but it has always
been an offence at common law. It is defined J
as the breaking of a pound or any part thereof,
and retaking cattle distrained after they are

impounded. As soon as they are impounded in
a lawful pound they are in the custody of the
law, and cannot be re-taken without the party
being guilty of pound breach. At common law
pound breach is a higher offence than unlawful
rescue, for if a man break a pound or lock, or
any part of the enclosure in which animals are
detained in the custody of the law, he offends
against the peace.
Rescue can only take place before impound-
ing ; pound breach can only take place after-
wards. And there is a further distinction
between them. Pound breach may take place
without any breach of the peace against any
individual. It is an insult to the majesty of the
law, and it is not necessary that any person
should be present in custody of the cattle at
the time, as the walls or fences are a sufficient
protection. A rescue, on the other hand, must
be accompanied by a breach of the peace, or
something that is likely to occasion a breach of
the peace, and a taking from the custody of the
keeper.
To constitute pound breach there must be a
criminal intention, though actual force is not
necessary ; removing slip rails from the fence of
a paddock in which cattle had been placed after
impounding and taking the cattle out, is not
pound breach.


Destroying or injuring or attempting to des-
troy or injure a pound is an offence against the
Act; sec. 30 (ii). This does not comprise the
common law offence of pound breach, unless
accompanied by a re-taking of impounded cattle.
It is an offence against the Act to remove
cattle from one place to another for the purpose
of impounding them from the latter place ; and
it is also an offence by a person in charge of
cattle if, on demand by a member of the police
force, or by any person on whose land the cattle
are trespassing, he refuse to give the true name
and address of the owner of the cattle.
A person who without proper authority drives
cattle not his own from the land of any other
person, without giving previous notice to the
occupier ot the land from which the cattle are
taken, also commits an offence against the Act.
And it is an offence to wilfully leave open a j
gate or slip-panel, or to make a gap in a fence,
for the purpose of causing or permitting cattle
to trespass, or in any other way to wilfully cause
any cattle to trespass. In a case where by
aoreement under the Fences Act between ad-
joining land owners, whose natural boundary
was a creek, a dividing fence was so erected
as to give one of them occupation of land on
the side of the creek opposite his holding, and
included in his neighbour’s title deed ; and where,

after a lapse of fifteen years, the neighbour’s
tenant made a gajr in the dividing fence in order
to obtain access to a dam in the creek for the
purpose of watering his stock ; it was decided
that, notwithstanding the provisions of the
Fences Act relating to possession of land under
such circumstances, the tenant was liable to a
penalty for making the gap in the fence. It will
be noticed, however, that wilfulness or intention
to commit this offence is an ingredient;
leaving a gate open or a slip-panel down
accidentally would not create an offence.
A careful perusal of the several sections of
the Act will show in what respects the common
law right of impounding is thereby limited and
restricted ; and the several cases noted at the
foot of each section will explain the legal effect
of the statutory enactment as regulating the
common law right.


THE
POUNDS ACT 1890
[54 Viet. No. 1129].
An Act to consolidate the Law relating to
the Impounding of Cattle.
[loth July , 1590.~\
Be it enacted by the Queen’s Most Excellent
Majesty by and with the advice and consent of
the Legislative Council and the Legislative
Assembly of Victoria in this present Parliament
assembled and by the authority of the same as
follows (that is to say) :
1. This Act may be cited as the Founds Act f
j c
1890, and shall come into operation on the first
day of August One thousand eight hundred and
ninety.
The effect of the Act is not to grant any right or authority to ]
impound cattle damage feasant, but merely to regulate and control 1
the procedure of impounding, and to limit the right already existing
at common law; Main v. Uobertson, 2 V.L.R. (L.) 25. The Act
itself nowhere gives this'right to impound, except in the case of cattle
wandering without control on a road. The council of a municipality
may impound cattle driven along or on to any street or road for the

also deemed to be the owner and occupier of roads for the purpose
of impounding ; ibid, sec. 408. See notes to sec. 17.
2. The Acts mentioned in the First Schedule
to this Act to the extent to which the same are
thereby expressed to be repealed are hereby
repealed. Provided that such repeal shall not
affect any appointment registration complaint or
order made, or any notification or notice given,
or any sustenance fees or trespass rates (a)
fixed under the said Acts or any of them before
the commencement of this Act ( b ).
(а) By sec. 4 of the Act 21 Viet. No. 17 (repealed by this Act)
pound fees were payable into the consolidated revenue. In all cases
where the pound is within a municipality the fees now form part of
the municipal fund ; sec. 8.
(б) The tables of fees, charges and rates required to be posted at
every pound (sec. 19), and which have been erected before the com-
ing into operation of the Act, are not affected by the repeal in this
section.
3. In this Act —
“ Cattle ” shall include any horse mare geld-
ing colt filly or foal, and any bull cow
ox steer heifer or calf, and any ram
ewe sheep or lamb, and any ass mule
goat or pig (a):
“Great cattle” shall include any horse mare

(а) By virtue of see. 15 goats and pigs found trespassing may be
destroyed, or at the option of the occupier may be impounded as
cattle.
(б) Under the Land Act 1869 (No. 360), sec. 60, persons who .
depastured on a common were the occupiers ; the managers were the
owners ; Goldsbrouyh v. Fletcher , 6 W.W. & a’B. (L.) 213, But
under the Land Act 1901 (No. 1749), sec. 153, the managers of a
common are taken to be occupiers within the meaning of any Act in
force relating to impounding ; see notes to sec. 16, “ Impounding
from Commons.” The word “ owner” is purposely omitted in secs.
12 to 15 of the Pounds Act 1890 to accord with the decision in the
above case and the alteration of the wording of the Land Act ; see

4. In any part of Victoria not within any
municipality the Governor in Council and within
any municipality the council of such municipality
from time to time may t appoint places to be
pounds and any pound may abolish.
Notice in the Government Gazette, although primd facie evidence
of the existence of a pound (sec. 27), is not the only evidence. It is
not necessary that the limits of a pound be proclaimed, although of
course a pound must have limits ; Boss v. Costello, 13 A.L.T. 215.
Section 13 contemplates cattle being impounded in a private pound
as at common law, without being in the custody of the poundkeeper,
and without going to the common pound ; Lodge v. Rowe, 1 V.L.R.
(L.) 65 ; but they must not be detained beyond three days.
Under the common law a person who distrains cattle is bound to
impound them in a proper pound, and if the usual pound is in an
unfit state he must find another ; Bignell v. Clark, 5 H. & N. 485 ;
29 L. J. Ex. 257. For distrainors are bound to see that the pound
to which they take the distress is in a fit state to receive it, and
therefore if the common pound is'wet and muddy the distrainors are
liable for any damage caused by the distress ; Wilder v. Speer , 8 A.
& E. 547 ; 3 N. & P. 356.
Under the English Act to which the above decisions refer cattle
distrained damage feasant were required to be impounded in the
common pound (if any) of the parish, township, tithing or place
where the same should be found, or in such place as should be pro-
vided for the purpose.
It is assumed, however, that the liability of a distrainor under the
common law for placing distrained cattle in a pound which is unfit to
receive them is in Victoria controlled by the necessity of placing
them in the nearest accessible pound. A distrainor is compelled to

impound them, if he impounds them at all, in the nearest accessible
pound (sec.. 16), which is a place appointed by the municipal council
under this section, and is under their control, they appointing and
paying the poundkeeper, receiving fees, &c. ; and if such a pound is
in an unfit state, the distrainor, who can only send the cattle there,
should not be held liable for the neglect or default of the council.
There is no limit to the number of pounds the council of a muni-
cipality may establish.
5. For every pound not within a municipality
the Governor in Council and for every pound
within any municipality the council of such
municipality from time to time may appoint a
poundkeeper and may suspend or remove the
poundkeeper (a) ; and every poundkeeper shall
be paid by a fixed salary and not by fees (6).
(а) For meaning of “ poundkeeper,” see sec. 3. And see note to
sec. 22.
The keeper of a pound within a municipality is appointed in the
same manner as other officers of the council under the Local Govern-
ment Act 1890 (No. 1112). As to evidence of appointment, see sec.
27. A poundkeeper’s statement, if not objected to at the time, is
sufficient evidence of his appointment; Rose v. Costello, 13 A.L.T.
215 ; and see note to sec. 6.
(б) It will be observed that a poundkeeper must be paid by a fixed i
salary, and not by fees. A municipal council has no authority to
remunerate a poundkeeper by payment of a nominal salary and a
share of the fees received by him. The intention of the Act is to
create the poundkeeper a stakeholder between the impounder and
the owner of the cattle impounded, and to deprive him of any in-
ducement to impose fees other than those authorized by the Act;
see sec. 28 (iii).
A poundkeeper is bound to take and keep whatever is brought to
him, at the peril of the person who brings it, without any judgment, '
discretion, warrant or examination ; he is not answerable whether
the animal was legally impounded or not. If the cattle have been
wrongfully taken the person bringing them to the pound and not

the poundkeeper is responsible; Badkin v. Powell, Cowp. 476 ;
Brandling v. Kent, 1 T.R. 60.
6. The keeper of any pound within a muni-
cipality shall be deemed an officer of such muni-
cipality within the meaning of any law now or
hereafter to be in force relating to municipalities.
Although a poundkeeper is by this section deemed an officer of the
municipality controlling the pound, he is still a public official named
in a legislative enactment, whose duties are prescribed by the Act,
and who is required to perform those duties in pursuance of the Act;
Jones v. Falvey, 5 V.L.R. (L.) 230 ; 1 A.L.T. 23. And see note to
sec. 22.
The keeper of a pound not within a municipality is a public official
appointed by the Governor in Council with similar duties (sec. 5).
A poundkeeper, being a public officer discharging a public duty,
is not bound to produce his appointment to a person impounding
cattle as evidence of his right to receive them into the pound.
There must be a poundkeeper for every proclaimed pound, and the
fact that he is acting in that capacity is sufficient; Boss v. Costello,
13A.L.T. 215.
Trespass does not lie against a poundkeeper merely for receiving
a distress which he is bound to receive, although the original taking
be tortious, unless he exceeds his duty and assents to the trespass
Badkin v. Powell, Cowp. 476.
7. The salary of the poundkeeper and the
expenses of establishing maintaining removing
or repairing anjt pound shall be paid, in the case
of every pound not within a municipality, out of
any money granted by Parliament for that pur-
pose ; and in the case of every pound within a
municipality out of the municipal fund of such
municipality.
A pound within a municipality is under the entire control of the
municipal council, which appoints places to be pounds, pays out of
the municipal fund all expenses of establishing, maintaining, remov-

ing and repairing them, and also pays the ponndkeeper’s salary ; see
the Local Government Act 1890, sec. 511.
In the case of a pound not within a municipality these expenses
are paid by grant of Parliament.
This section contemplates the removal of a pound ; Ross v. Costello ,
13 A.L.T. 215. Though there is no direct authority in the Act
specifically permitting the removal of a pound from one place to
another, yet under section 4 places may from time to time be
appointed to be pounds, and the appointing of a new place to be a
pound and the abolition of the old pound would be equivalent to
removing the pound.
8. Every poundkeeper shall demand and re-
ceive as pound fees ( a ) the sums set forth in the
Second Schedule to this Act, and such fees and
all other fees not otherwise appropriated by this
Act shall, in case the pound at which they are
received be not within a municipality, form part
of the consolidated revenue, and in case the
pound at which the}’ - are received be within any
municipality form part of the municipal fund ( h)
of such municipality.
(a) The fees payable under this section in the case of a pound not
within a municipality must not be confounded with the trespass rates
and sustenance fees chargeable under sec. 9. If the pound is within
a municipality all the fees mentioned in this section and enumerated
in the Second Schedule to the Act must be paid into the municipal
fund ; see notes to sec. 9.
As to sustenance fees see note (a) to sec. 9.

cipality may from time to time subject to the
approval of the Governor in Council fix susten-
ance fees (a) and trespass rates (b) ; such susten-
ance fees shall be payable in respect of the
sustenance in the pound of impounded cattle,
and shall be received by the poundkeeper and
may be applied by him after reimbursing to
himself thereout any expenses incurred in the
sustenance of such cattle in the same way in
which pound fees are applicable ; such trespass
rates shall be payable as compensation in respect
of any trespass committed by impounded cattle,
and may vary according to the description of
the cattle trespassing and as the land trespassed
on be or be not tillage land enclosed with a
substantial fence (c), so that the rate for tres-
pass on land not being tillage land (d) enclosed
with a substantial fence do not exceed One
penny for every sheep and Threepence for every
head of other cattle so trespassing { e).
(а) Neglect by the poundkeeper to provide sustenance for cattle
impounded is an offence ; see sec. 28 (v).
The poundkeeper is required to sustain impounded cattle, and may
reimburse himself all expenses of sustenance, paying any balance
into the municipal fund ; see sec. 24.
A poundkeeper may not demand or receive any fees not authorized
by the Act; sec. 28 (iii).
Sustenance fees under this section are chargeable even though the
poundkeeper has not been at any expense for the sustenance of
animals impounded; Lament v. Bennett , 28 V.L.R. 438; 8 A.L.R.
177.
(б) Trespass rates are payable to the impounder as compensation
for damage done ; see sec. 24.

As to additional trespass rates for entire horses, bulls and rams,
see sec. 10.
Semble, justices have jurisdiction under section 59 (4) of the Justices
Act to award damages for trespass by cattle under sec. 10 of the
Pounds Act although no trespass rate has been fixed under the pro-
visions of that Act; and that the jurisdiction of a Court of Petty
Sessions under sec. 59 (4) of the Justices Act to award damages for
trespass is not ousted by reason of sec. 10 of the Pounds Act, and of
the fact that the sum of £3 damages was found by the justices ;
Simpson v. Johnstone, 25 V.L.R. 340 ; 21 A.L.T. 156 ; 5 A.L.R. 301.
No proceedings to recover compensation for trespass by cattle can
be brought under the Justices Act 1890, sec. 59 (4), unless the cattle
have, in fact, been restored to their owner as provided by sec. 12 of
the Pounds Act. The provisions under see. 59 (4) of the Justices Act
must be regarded as supplementary to the jurisdiction given by
sec. 12 of the Pounds Act. It could not have been intended that
there should be two processes—one to recover the trespass rates,
and the other to recover the excess over those rates. Restoration is
a necessary condition before the rates can be recovered under sec. 12
of the Pounds Act, and it is also a necessary condition before pro-
ceedings can be taken to recover compensation under sec. 59 (4) of
the Justices Act. There is no restoration where the cattle are prac-
tically unmanageable on the complainant’s land. It is certainly a
great hardship that where cattle straying on a man’s land are utterly
unmanageable and therefore cannot be restored, but the landowner
can take no proceedings under sec. 59 (4) of the Justices Act ; Crowe
v. Nicholson, 2 A.L.R. 178. See note (d) to sec. 12, “ Restoration
of Trespassing Cattle ” ; Simpson v. Johnstone, 25 V. L. R. 340 ; 21
A.L.T. 156 ; 5 A.L.R. 301.
(c) The question of what is a substantial fence under the Act is j
one for the justices to decide upon the facts of each case, and is not
governed by the definition given by the Fences Act of what is a
“sufficient fence” under that Act; Peg. v. Hutchinson, ex parte
Jessell, 10 V.L.R. (L.) 332; 6 A.L.T. 161. A fence may bo a sub-
stantial fence within the meaning of this Act, and yet not a sufficient
fence within the Fences Act ; Ibid.

Land Act 1901, see notes to sec. 31.

the cattle of one trespass upon the land of the other the latter may
- impound them, notwithstanding the absence of a fence ; Butcher v.
Smith , SW.W. & a’B. (L.) 223. Under sec. 14 of the Pounds Act
1874 (No. 478) passed subsequently to the decision in Butcher v.
Smith , no cattle, with certain exceptions, were liable to be impounded
from unfenced land without notice to the owner, unless the cattle
had been found trespassing a second time within twelve months.
This section, however, is repealed, and Butcher v. Smith applies to
the present law. Cattle may be impounded from unfenced land,
except land leased or licensed under the Land Act (see notes to sec.
31), subject to the trespass rates payable under this section.
As to the obligation to repair fences, the general rule of law is that
a man is only bound to keep his cattle from trespassing on the land
of another ; Boyle v. Tamlyn , 68. &C. 337 ; 3 Dyer, 372 (10) : Fitz.
N.B. 128. Note by Lord Hale.
( d) Trespass rates as for cattle impounded off tillage land within
the meaning of sec. 3 cannot be demanded in respect of trespass upon
an enclosed peach garden, although the soil was originally ploughed
to receive the trees, and has since been ploughed from time to time
to keep down weeds, potatoes being planted between the rows of
trees. Where the trespass rates upon tillage land fixed by the
council of a municipality under this section were demanded and paid
as compensation in respect of a trespass on a peach orchard committed
by bullocks, which had been impounded, the owner of the bullocks
was held entitled to recover back the excess of trespass fees paid by
him over and above the fees payable at the rate fixed under this
section, on the ground that the land trespassed on was not tillage
land within the meaning of the section. The demand of the higher
trespass rates provided for in this section in respect of the trespass
of these bullocks was not warranted by this Act, because this trespass
was on a peach orchard, which, though cultivated, was not sown
with a grain crop ; Stewart v. Florance , 26 V.L.R. 417 ; 22 A. L.T.
90 ; 6 A.L.R. 221. See sec. 3 for interpretation of “ tillage ” land.
(e) When cattle are impounded from land not enclosed with a sub-
stantial fence, even though it be tillage land, and the higher trespass
rate is charged, the remedy of the owner of the cattle is by proceed-
ing against the impounder for demanding excessive trespass rates,
and not for illegally impounding ; for the distress is not illegal. In
order to authorize the charge of the higher rate the land trespassed
upon must be not only tillage land (as interpreted by sec. 3),
but must also be enclosed with a substantial fence ; see Bailey v.
McDonald, , 4 A.L.T., 2; and notes to secs. 25 and 26.

10. In respect of the trespass of any entire
horse any bull or any ram there shall be payable
as a trespass rate in addition to any other sum
fixed under the provisions of this Act by way
of trespass rate a sum not exceeding Five
pounds.
This trespass rate is payable in addition to the trespass rates fixed
b}' the municipal council or by the Governor in Council, under sec. 9.
Under the Pounds Act 1874 (No. 478), a definite sum of five pounds
was fixed as the trespass rate under the section analagous to this,
but the trespass rate was found to be oppressive, and the section was
repealed by the Act No. 824, fixing a trespass rate not exceeding five
pounds. The above section is identical with the repealing Act.
It is assumed that if the damages be not agreed on between the
parties proceedings should be taken for demanding excessive trespass
rates, and that the justices should adjudge a fair compensation.
This section does not deprive the occupier of land of his right to ;
sue for damage done by cattle trespassing on his land ; see Midhare 1
v. Lindsay , N.C. 14.
Under the Land Act 1889 (No. 360) it was held that a licensee 1
under section 19 of that Act could not recover trespass rates or J
damages under this section unless he had enclosed his land with a
substantial fence ; Allan v. Mclntyre , 8 V.L.R. (L.) 133 ; 4 A.L.T.

the person entitled thereto.
If the impounding is adjudged by the justices to have been illegal, 1
the trespass rates should be returned to the owner of the cattle who
released them. Otherwise, they are payable to the person impound-

in a summary way before any two justices from
the owner of such cattle the amount of any
trespass rates that would be payable under the
provisions of this Act if such cattle were
impounded in respect of the trespass thereof,
and when no trespass rates have been provided
for or fixed then such compensation as such
justices may deem reasonable {cl).
(a) Occupier of Land.— Only the occupier of land trespassed
upon can take advantage of this section. An owner not being also
an occupier has no rights under it; see cases below.
The meaning of “occupier” is defined by sec. 3 ; see notes to that
section. The word “owner” is nowhere used in the Act in regard
to rights over land ; “ occupier ” is the only term employed, and has
a special meaning under sec. 3; see Goldsbrough v. Fletcher , 6W.
W. & a’B. (L.) 213. Certain powers are conferred by the Act on the
“owner” (i.e. t the owner of cattle trespassing) when that term is
used, and upon “occupier” when that term is used; but when
neither of them is used the interpretation clause is inapplicable ;
Ibid.
The former Pounds Acts gave no definition of owner of land, except
as to waste land ; Geoghegan v. Talbot , 5 W.W. & a’B. (L.) 187.
Nor does the present Act.
Managers of a common under Part IV of the Land Act 1869 (No.
360) are the owners and not the occupiers of the common within the
meaning of that Act, and cannot recover trespass rates under this
section; Lewi* v. Green, 9V. L.K. (L.) 354; 5 A.L.T. 121. But

under the Land Act 1901 (No. 1749), managers of a common are the
occupiers of the common within the purview of this Act ; see notes
to sec. 10, “ Impounding from Commons.”
(b) Owner of Impounded Cattle. —It is only the owner of cattle
who can be sued for trespass rates under this section. If the owner
is non-resident, the distrainor should impound the cattle if the tres-
pass rates are not tendered to him ; per Hiyinbotham, J., in Lewis
v. Green , supra .
A person who is merely a manager or servant having charge of a
station and the cattle thereon is not the owner within this section,
and is not personally liable for a penalty incurred by their trespass.
The Act contains no definition of owner which would include the
servant or manager of the owner ; Ibid.
Where a servant authorized to distrain cattle damage feasant ,
drives cattle off the plaintiff’s land into his master’s and then dis-
trains them, the master is not liable in trespass ; Lyons v. Martin,
8 A. & E. 512.
Where a superintendent having impounded sheep gave in the
name of the owner notice of appeal under the Pounds Statute 1805
(No. 249), and subsequently proceeded in his (the superintendent’s)
own name and obtained a conviction, it was held that if the super-
intendent had acted either in his own name or in that of the owner
throughout, the conviction would have been right; but as part of
the proceedings were in his own name and part in that of the owner
the conviction could not be sustained ; Rey. v. Taylor, ex parte
McDonald, 8 V.R. (L.) 18 ; 8 A.J. R. 81.
Semhle , an unpaid vendor in possession is the owner who is liable
to pay trespass rates in respect of cattle when restored to him after
trespass by them ; Re<j. v. Wyatt, ex parte Rutherford , 3 V.L.R. (L.)
126.
(c) Demand of Trespass Rates. —Where trespassing sheep are
restored to their owner or his agent a demand of the amount of 1
trespass rates is not necessary, nor is it a condition precedent to
recovery before justices; McMillan v. Gove, 1 V.L.R. (L.) 142,
citing Rex v. Ford, 2 A. & E. 588.
The effect of this section is simply to turn the claim for damages <
into a “demand” cognizable by justices which may be enforced i
before them. The acts of trespass and restoration give rise at once
to a present claim or demand, which the restorer of the cattle may

proceed to enforce without any preliminary steps. The making of
the complaint is a sufficient demand, as it is in the case of a debt or
demand for goods sold and delivered ; Ibid. ; Reg. v. Puckle, ex
parte Ware, 1 V.L.R. (L.) 142.
With regard to the amount of trespass rates payable in case of a
distress damage feasant it is the duty of the owner of the cattle dis-
trained to assess and tender to the occupier of the land compensa-
tion for damage done by the cattle. He is the wrong-doer in the first
instance. It is not for the occupier of the land to assess the amount
of compensation ; see Gulliver v. Cosens, 1 C.B. 794. And the above
rule of law is not altered by the Act; McMillan v. Gave, supra.
- (d) Restoration of Trespassing Cattle. —See notes, supra (h),
“Owner of Impounded Cattle” ; Reg. v. Wyatt, ex parte Ruther-
ford, supra.
As to recovery of trespass rates by a licensee under the Land Act,
see note to sec. 10; Allan v. Mclntyre, 8 V.L.R. (L.) 133 : 4 A.L.T.
4; and notes to sec. 31.
In restoring cattle under this section it is not necessary to deliver
them to the owner personally ; delivery to an overseer or agent is
sufficient; McMillan v. Gove, 1 V.L.R. (L.) 142. But on a com-
plaint for the amount of trespass rates in respect of trespassing
cattle restored to some person for the owner, the justices must hear
evidence and determine whether such person was a person having
authority to receive them ; Schneider v. Wright, 4 V.L.R. (L.) 62.
Where trespassing cattle are restored to their owner before im-
pounding upon the promise to pay what is due on them, the justices
cannot make a valid order upon him for special damages above the
ordinary rates ; otherwise justices might exercise jurisdiction to an
unlimited extent; Wilson v. Powell, 4 W.W. & a’B. (L.) 249.
This section does not take away the jurisdiction of the County
Court to give damages for trespass by cattle; Midhare v. Lindsay,
N.C. 14.
Trespassing cattle seized for the purpose of impounding may be
detained for a reasonable time before being taken to the pound ;
Sanderson v. Fotheringham, 10 V.L.R. (L.) 289; 6 A.L.T. 122.
And where sheep are lawfully seized damage feasant for the purpose
of impounding, their detention for an unreasonable time, or improper
treatment of them after seizure, as by excessive driving, will not
constitute the distrainor a trespasser ah initio ; Ibid.

By the Justices Act 1890 (No. 1105) sec. 59 (4), a Court of Petty
Sessions has jurisdiction to hear and determine causes of action “ for
damages for trespass by cattle upon any land where trespass rates
have been provided for or fixed under the provisions of the Pounds
Act 1890 or any law for the time being in force relating to the im-
pounding of cattle to the extent that such rates do not in the opinion
of the Court afford sufficient compensation to the complainant for
such trespass. Provided that the amount of such rates together
with the amount of damages awarded shall not exceed fifty pounds.”
No proceedings to recover compensation for trespass by cattle can
be brought under the Justices Act 1890, sec. 59 (4), unless the cattle
have in fact been restored to their owner as provided by sec. 12 of
the Pounds Act ; Crowe v. Nicholson, 2 A.L.R. 178. See note ( b) to
sec. 9.
Cattle are sufficiently restored to their owner within the meaning
of section 12 of the Pounds Act if they are replaced to his knowledge
in a field or paddock occupied by him. “An animal like a bidl can-
not be taken by the hand, so to speak, and handed over. It is
restored when it is put on the defendant’s property with the defend-
ant’s knowledge.” Per Hodges, J. ; Simpson v. Johnstone, 25 V.L.R.
340 ; 21 A.L.T. 156; 5 A.L.R. 301.
13. No trespass rates or other damages for
trespass shall be payable to or recoverable by
any person in respect of the trespass of any ■
cattle who shall impound or detain such cattle \
for upwards of three days in any place not being
a pound within the meaning of this Act.
This section contemplates cattle being impounded as at common
law, without being in the custody of the poundkeeper, and without
going to the common pound ; Per Fellows, J. in Lodge v. Rowe, 1
V.L.R. (L.), 65. During the time cattle are detained in this private
pound they are not “impounded,” and their owner may pay or
tender the trespass rate under sec. 14, and obtain restoration of the
cattle ; see notes to sec. 14.
The “place not being a pound,” mentioned in this section, is
virtually a private pound, as at common law ; and therefore it is the
duty of the distrainor to see that the place is in a fit state to receive

and detain cattle seized, and to see that the cattle are provided with
proper sustenance ; Wilder v. Speer, 8 A. & E. 547 ; 3 N. &.P 336 ;
and see Lodge v. Howe, supra.
If the cattle are detained beyond three days the distrainor loses all
right to recover trespass rates or damages under the Act. As to
detaining cattle seized for the purpose of impounding, see notes to
sec. 12, “Restoration of Trespassing Cattle”; Sanderson v.
Fother in (jham, 10 V.L.R. (L.) 289 ; 6 A.L.T. 122.
14. Whenever any cattle have been seized
for trespass by any occupier for the purpose of
impounding the same if the owner of the cattle
or some person on his behalf pay or tender to
the person seizing or having charge of such
cattle before the same have been actually im-
pounded the trespass rate provided under this
Act the person having charge of such cattle
shall forthwith deliver up the same to the owner
or the person tendering the said rates on bis
behalf.
Tender of Amends.— This section re-enacts the common law
that when cattle have been seized for the purpose of impounding the
owner may obtain them on paying or tendering the trespass rate
payable.
Seizure for the purpose of impounding is the only seizure contem-
plated by the Act; see Jones v. Campion, 4 V.L.R. (L.) 170, 473;
Welcome v. Upton, 5 M. & W. 398 ; Itichards v. Fry, 7 A. & E. 698 ;
Goodioyii v. Gheveley, 4 H. & N. 631 ; 28 L J. Ex. 298.
As to secondary evidence of trespass rates, see note to sec. 19;
Reg. v. Duncan, ex parte Griffin, 13 V.L.R. 509; 9 A.L.T. 71.
An owner of land accepting trespass rates for the damage done by
sheep is not thereby' precluded from suing for damages in respect of
a previous trespass; Mitchell v. Wright, 4 V.L.R. (L.) 273.
The trespass rates to be tendered under this section are those
provided by the Act, although the parties may have agreed between
them to a higher rate ; and a refusal in such circumstances to release

No action can be maintained for detaining cattle distrained dam-
age feasant where a tender of sufficient amends was made after the

the taking; if after the taking and before the impounding, then
though the taking is lawful the detainer after the tender is unlawful;

Where cattle distrained damage feasant are in a private pound
(e.g. under sec. 13) and the distrainor admits they were about to be
forwarded to a public pound, a tender of amends made while they
were in the private pound is not too late ; Brown v. Powell, 4 Bing.
230. A tender of amends to the wife of the distrainor was held .
sufficient if she is agent for the purpose ; Ibid ; Gilbert on Replevin ;
though it was held that tender of amends to a mere bailiff was not ■

If cattle have trespassed to-day and have gone off, and trespass i
again at another time and are then taken, and the owner tenders

15. The occupier of any land and a Crown

cause to be destroyed any goats or pigs or geese
trespassing on such land ; and if the owner of
such goats or pigs or geese fail to remove their
carcasses within twelve hours after the destruc-
tion of them, the person destroying such goats or
pigs or geese shall cause such carcasses to be
buried.
This section does not impose any obligation to kill the animals
instantaneously, or any liability for injuring the animals ; Bagshaiu
v. Wills, 5 A.J.R. 115. The section will apply only to those animals
which are specially named in it, viz., goats, pigs and geese ; expressio
unius est exclusio alterius. Dogs or domestic fowls are not included
in it; see Geogheganv. Talbot , 5 W.W. & a’B. (L.) 187. Goats and
pigs are included in the interpretation of “ cattle,” (sec. 3), and can
therefore be impounded or destroyed. Any impounding of dogs or
domestic fowls would have to be done under the common law; the
Act does not limit the right as to these.
16. No cattle shall be impounded under the
provisions of this Act except in the nearest
accessible pound (a) to the place where such
cattle were found trespassing, and the person
by whom or by whose order any cattle are sent
to the pound shall in a written memorandum
(h) specify to the poundkeeper the description
number brands or apparent brands and marks
of such cattle, the place where they were found

( a ) Nearest Accessible Pound. —See notes to secs. 25, 26, and
30 (iii).
The question which under this section is the nearest accessible
pound is a question of fact for the justices in each particular case,
and may be determined by a consideration of the relative conveni-
ence, to the person impounding, or driving trespassing cattle to one
or other of the pounds available. The object of the section is for
the protection of the owner of the cattle, not of the person im-
pounding, so that the owner may know where to go to look for his
cattle. The defendant had impounded a bull in a pound not
nearest to the place where the bull had trespassed, but in one
which in defendant’s view was more accessible to the place where the
bull was seized. Some meaning must be given to the word
“ accessible ” which is used in this section. The Legislature did
not say the “ nearest pound,” but the “ nearest accessible pound.”
The question of convenience must be considered in determining
which is the nearest accessible pound. It was a question of fact for
the justices to say what was the most reasonable thing for the
defendant to do; Adam v. Ryan, 23 V.L.R. 334 ; 3 A.L.R. 231;
19 A.L.T. 99.
The provisions of the Pounds Statute 1865 (No. 249) as to driving '
to the nearest pound were merely directory; Butcher v. Smith, 5
W.W. & a’B. (L.) 223. Under this section, however, they are
mandatory. This section is analogous to section 11 of No. 249. 1
The direction in the introductory part of the latter section that
cattle impounded under that Act should be sent to the pound
nearest to the place where the cattle were found trespassing is
changed into a prohibition that no cattle shall be impounded except
in the nearest accessible pound ; McLaurin v. Griffin, 13 V.L.R.
140; 8 A.L.T. 192.
At common law a pound means a place for safe keeping selected I
by the distrainor at his own discretion and at his own risk ; under
the Act it means the nearest accessible proclaimed pound ; Jones v.
Campion, 4 V.L.R. (L.) 170.
The place trespassed upon means the actual spot where the cattle F
trespassed by feeding without authority ; Sanderson v. Fotheringham,
10 V.L.R. (L.) 289 ; 6 A.L.T. 122.

The occupier of land is bound under this section to impound in
' the nearest pound, except in cases within section 12. He cannot
assert that the cattle may be better looked after while kept by him
in his own paddock or enclosure than they would have been in the
pound ; O’Shea v. D’Arcy, 6 V.L.R. (L.) 142; 1 A.L.T. 170.
It is not necessary that cattle seized for the purpose of impounding
should be conveyed to the nearest pound immediately and without
delay. No time is expressly provided, and the general rule is
applicable that where no time is prescribed for doing an act
directed to be done it must be done at and within a reasonable
time ; Sanderson v. Fotheringham, supra. The onus of showing
that the detention was reasonable is on the defendant; he has to
establish full compliance with the Act; per Slawell, J., in Jones v.
Campion, supra.
The offence of illegally impounding applies only to impounding
cattle elsewhere than in the nearest accessible pound ; McLaurin v.
Griffin, supra ; and see notes (c) to sec. 30.
( b ) Memorandum to the Poundkeeper. —Non-compliance with
the direction in this section as to the memorandum to be given to
the poundkeeper is not within the offence of illegally impounding
created by sec. 30 (iii); Robertson v. Main, 1 V.L.R. (L.) 5. But
such non-compliance may constitute an offence under sec. 30 (viii);

Under the Pounds Statute 1865 (No. 249), the following memo-

of the Ledcourt and Warra Warra Farmers’Common on 4 Oct. 1870,
1415 sheep (describing them) mostly belonging to Mr. P. (plaintiff).
Trespass damage on the lot. M. (defendant).” The fair inference
was that the sheep were impounded from the common by the man-
agers, and a reference to the Schedule of the Act would show the
scale of fees which should be tendered on that description of land ;

poundkeeper headed like a letter, “Loddon, Nov. 2, 1868,” was
held not to sufficiently specify the place where the cattle were found
trespassing. The word “Loddon” does not express whether the
land was enclosed and cropped so as to enable the poundkeeper to
charge the appropriate fees. Nor does it describe the place of tres-
pass in such a way as the trespasser has a right to have it described
under the Act ; Wingfield v. Glass , 6 W.W. & a’B. (L.) 4.
(d) Name of the Owner. —The memorandum must contain the
name of the owner of the cattle, if known; McLauriu v. Griffin,
supra. The omission would constitute an offence under sec. 30 (viii).
(e) Impounding Generally. —A tenant holding over after the
expiration of his term cannot distrain his landlord’s cattle which
were put on the premises by way of taking possession ; Taunton v.
Costar , 7 T.R. 431 ; Butcher v. Butcher , 7 B. & C. 399.
Where G. allowed cattle to remain in a public park contrary to
the conditions of his licence for grazing, which required all cattle to
be removed before 6 o’clock p.m., it was held that they could be
impounded, and that the Board of Land and Works were not merely
put to their remedy for breach of the conditions of the licence;
Ritchie v. Gillespie , 2W.& W. (L.) 40. As between persons having
concurrent possession, see Whiteman v. King , 2 H. 81. 4 ; Burt v.
Moore , ST. R. 329 ; Churchill v. Evans , 1 Taunt. 529. If the parties
were in joint possession it is assumed they would be in an analogous
position to partners or joint tenants, and neither one of them would
be owner or occupier with power to impound trespassing cattle

belonging to his partner or joint tenant; see reported note of Poyner
- v. King, 5 A.L.R. (C.N.) 38.
It matters not to whom the cattle distrained belong if they be
really trespassing. So cattle may be taken damage feasant although
they come on the land without the owner’s knowledge or consent, or
by default of another; 1 Roll. Abr. 665 ; but not without their
owner’s knowledge and through the default of the owner of the soil;
Kimp v. Cruises, 2 Lutw. 1573.
A horse in a cart in the actual use of a person cannot be distrained
damage feasant; nor can any animal which is under the immediate
control of its owner; Field v. Adams, 4 P. & D. 304; 12 A. & E.
649. But sheep under the charge of a shepherd may be impounded
for trespass, even though they have trespassed without the know-
ledge or even against the wish of the shepherd ; Brough v. Wallace,
2 W. & W. (L.) 195.
A person in charge of trespassing cattle must give the name and
address of the owner on demand ; see sec, 30 (v).
A horse cannot be distrained damage feasant if there is a rider on
it, as tending to a breach of the peace ; Storey v. Robinson, 6 T.R.
138 ; Hoskins v. Robins, 2 Saund. 328. And even if a man rides over
the corn of another the latter cannot distrain the horse damage
feasant; 9 Vin. Abr. 121 : “ Distress.” It was ruled that a horse
may be distrained if it is being led by a person at the time ; Wag-
slaff v. Clack, Cambridge Sum. Ass. 1826 ; but in a subsequent case
it was held that a horse could not be distrained while in the actual
possession of another under his personal care, and being actually
used by him ; Field v. Adams, supra ; and see Burch v. Kennington,
1 Q.8.D.679 ; 4 P. & D. 509.
To support a distress damage feasant it must appear that the dis-
trainor actually got into the locus in quo before the cattle got out of
it; Clement v. Milner, 3 Esp. 95. For the distress must be taken in
the act at the time the damage was done ; if the damage be done
yesterday the distress cannot be taken to-day ; Warmer v. Biggs, 2
C. &K. 31 ; Lindon v. Hooper, Cowp. 416. If a man sees cattle
damage feasant on his land and is about to distrain them, and the
owner of the cattle before they are seized drives them out, they
cannot afterwards be distrained, even though they are driven out
purposely to prevent the distress. And if the occupier of the land
does seize them they may be rescued ; for the animals must be dam-
age feasant at the time of the seizure ; Warmer v. Biggs, supra.

If a number of cattle are doing damage an occupier cannot take
one of them as a distress and claim trespass damage for the whole of
the cattle, though he may take one of them for its own damage and
bring an action of trespass for the damage done by the others ;
Vaspor v. Edwards , 12 Mod. 658 ; Gilbert on Distress.
Cattle distrained damage feasant cannot, although remaining on
the premises, be distrained for rent, as they are already in the
custody of the law; Co. Litt. 47; Eaton v. Southby , Willes 136;
Briggs v. Lowry , 8 M. &W. 729.
As cattle impounded are taken only in the nature of a pledge or
security to compel the performance of satisfaction a distrainor is not
at liberty to work or use a distrained beast; Bia. Com. 111. 13. But
milch kine may be milked ; Cro. Jac. 148.
If cattle distrained damage feasant are stolen the distrainor is not
answerable ; Vaspor v. Edwards , supra.
A poundkeeper may not impound or assist to impound cattle ; see
sec. 28 (i). A road inspector appointed by a council for the purpose
of seizing wandering cattle and impounding them, could not there-
fore act as poundkeeper.
Impounding from Commons. —As to the sufficiency of the memo- <
randum to the poundkeeper at the time of impounding cattle from a
common, see notes to this section, supra (c).
The Land Act 1890 (No. 1106), sec. 106, provides : — “ All commons
may be governed by managers appointed as herein provided, and
such managers shall during their continuance in office have power to
distrain any cattle and swine trespassing on such common, and shall
be taken to be occupiers of the common within the meaning of any <
Act now or hereafter in force relating to the impounding of cattle
. . . . and shall be taken to have in respect of such common
the same power of preventing encroachment and trespass thereon as
any bailiff lawfully appointed may by law exercise in respect of any
lands of his employer.”
Under the Land Act 1862 the managers of a farmers’ common were '
entitled to impound cattle damage feasant, and were not restricted
to the remedy by way of conviction and penalty given by section
129 of that Act; Douglas v. Reynolds , 2 W. & VV. (L.) 1. The
remedy given by the above section would not deprive the owner of
he rights he possessed independently of the Act; Ibid.

Under the Land Act 1865 (No. 237), sec. 48, the managers of a
common during their continuance in office had power to distrain any
cattle, sheep and goats (but not swine) trespassing on such common,
and were taken to be the owners within the meaning of any Act in
force relating to impounding of cattle ; see Geogkegan v. Talbot , 5
W. W. & a’B. (L.) 187. Under the Land Act 1869 it was held that
the managers of a common were the owners under the Pounds Statute
solely by force of the Land Act, and were not the occupiers. The
persons who depastured on a common were the occupiers ; Golds-
brough v. Fletcher , 6 W. W. & a’B. (L.) 213 ; Reg. v. Carr, ex parte
Sanderson , 10 V.L.R. (L.) 178; 6 A.L.T. 53; compare the Land
Act 1890, sec. 106, supra.
Sec. 60 of the Land Act 1869 does not mean that managers of a
common have an unlimited power as at common law to distrain for
damage feasant. The effect is to confer upon managers of a common
the same powers and liabilities in this respect as owners of land
have; Sanderson v. Fathering ham , 10 V. L.K. (L.) 17; 5 A.L.T.
172.
In an action against managers of a common for seizing and im-
pounding sheep it is not sufficient to plead that the defendants were
such managers, &c., and in that capacity impounded the sheep while
trespassing on the common. It is incumbent upon them as upon any
other owner or occupier of land to allege all that is necessary to
satisfy the requirements of the Act; Ibid.
17. The occupier of any land adjoining a
public road which road shall be fenced on both
sides by a substantial fence (a) may impound
any cattle wandering without control upon such
road ; and such cattle when impounded shall
be liable for the same amount as they would
be chargeable with if trespassing upon land
other than tillage land, and such amount shall
be received by the keeper of the pound in
which such cattle are impounded, and shall be
paid by him to the council of the municipality
in which such pound is situated (&).

(а) The road must be fenced on both sides. As to what is a sub-
stantial fence, see notes to sec. 9 (c).
There is no obligation at common law upon the owner of land to
fence between his land and a public highway, but merely a duty to
fence if he would protect himself against trespassers; Goodwyn v.
Cheveley , 4H. &N. 6.31 ; 28 L. J. Ex. 298. Thus, cattle may be dis-
trained if they are wrongfully on a road and stray from it into an
adjoining close, notwithstanding the obligation to fence ; for a dis-
trainor is not bound to fence against trespassers; Manchester,
Sheffield and Lincolnshire Rail. Co. v. Wallis , 14 C.B. ,313; 28 L.J.C. P.
85.
(б) The only statutory authority to impound cattle trespassing is
given by this section and by section 409 of the Local Government Act
1890 (No. 1112) infra , also referring to roads, and the Land Act 1901
(No. 1749), sec. 153, referring to commons. The right of impounding
from roads by occupiers of adjoining lands, or by a municipal council,
or from commons by the managers, does not exist at common law.
The Local Government Act 1890 (No. 1112) provides :
“ Sec. 408. For the purpose of any law now or hereafter to be in
force relating to the impounding of cattle every municipality, includ-
ing the City of Melbourne and the town of Geelong, shall be deemed
the owner and occupier of all public highways public or private
street roads bridges and ferries within its municipal district.
“ Sec. 409. Any cattle driven along or on to any street or road for
the purpose of grazing without the consent of the council of the
municipality shall be deemed to be trespassing on such street or road
and may be impounded by the council under any law for the time
being in force relating to the impounding of cattle.”
A person driving cattle along a public road adjoining unfenced
land must have a reasonable time to drive them off it if they stray ;
Butcher v. Smith , 5 W.W. & a’B. (L.), 223 ; Goodwyn v. Cheveley ,
supra.
The damages under this section are to be paid to the council as
occupier of the road, and do not form part of the municipal fund
under sec. 8.
18. Every poundkeeper shall keep a pound-
book in the form in the Fourth Schedule to this
Act and shall make all entries therein as soon
after the doing of the several things required to

the said pound-book and a copy of this Act,
which the poundkeeper is hereby required to
keep, shall at all reasonable times be open to the
inspection of any justice or member of the police
force free of charge, and of any other person
upon payment of the sum of sixpence.
A pound-book kept in pursuance of this section is a document of
such a public nature under the Evidence Act 1890 (No. 1088), sec.
23, that entries in it may he proved by a certified extract giving
the essential particulars; Jones v. Falvey, 5 V.-L.R. (L.) 230; 1
A.L.T., 23. “An extract from” means not the whole of the entry
but a quotation or citation from it, or an abstract of the material
portions ; per Barry , /., ibid.
If an animal is not impounded in the manner prescribed the
poundkeeper ought not to insert the fact in his pound-book ; for if
the law has not been complied with the animal is not “impounded ”
although it may be placed in the pound ; Ibid.
Neglect to keep the pound-book as required, or wilfully making
false entries therein, is an offence under sec. 28 (vi).
19. On the gate or some other conspicuous
part of every pound there shall be erected and
maintained a board (a) having painted thereon
in white letters on a black ground the name of
the poundkeeper and a table in the form in the

and rates which he is authorized by this Act to
receive: And whenever any cattle are im-

directed by this section ; Rey. v. Duncan, ex parte Orijjin, 13 V.L.R.

20, Every poundkeeper shall receive and
detain in his custody any cattle lodged in such
pound until the trespass rates for which the
same were impounded and all lawful fees and
charges shall be paid, or until he shall receive
notice of the decision or order of justices as
hereinafter provided, or receive an order in
writing signed by the person impounding such
cattle for their release without payment of the
trespass rates.
This section contemplates the poundkeeper acting as a stakeholder I
between the owner and the impounder of the cattle.

(a) The object of the registration is to enable an owner of cattle
to ascertain without delay when any of his cattle are impounded.
(b) A fee of 2s. 6d. is payable to the poundkeeper for sending
notice to the owner of the cattle ; see Second Schedule.
22. When cattle shall not have been released
from the pound within twenty-one days after
the giving or inserting the notice in the last
o o o
section mentioned the same shall be sold by
public auction; and such sale shall be made on
the first day next after the expiration of such
twenty-one days which shall be for the time
being appointed by the Governor in Council or
the council of the municipality by notice in the
Government Gazette and a newspaper published
in the district for the holding of pound sales.
And at such sale the poundkeeper shall act as
auctioneer, and such sale shall be held at the
pound and shall commence at the hour of noon,
and not more than one head of great cattle nor
more than ten sheep goats or pigs shall bo sold
in one lot ; and the poundkeeper shall neither

in person nor by his agent purchase any cattle
at any such sale or have any interest of any
kind in cattle so purchased.
Sales from a pound are the closest resemblance we have in this
State to sales in market overt; per Barry. J ., in Jones v. Falvey ,
5 V.L.R. (L.) 230. Under the English law impounded cattle may
be sold openly in the public market seven days after seizure, and
after three days’ printed notice given of the sale.
No power appears to be given by the Act enabling the pound-
keeper to recover any deficiency arising from the sale of impounded
cattle, if the amount realised shall be insufficient to pay the fees and
charges. But quaere, whether there would not be a remedy at com-
mon law ; Bourne v. Jone s, 3W. \V. & a’B. (L.) 45. Such a provision
was made in the old Pound Act of 1855 (18 Vic. No. 30). The
deficiency in sale of cattle impounded from streets by the council of
a municipality is provided for by Part I (9), sec. 42, of the Thirteenth
Schedule to the Local Government Act 1890 (No. 1112).
The poundkeeper is not permitted to purchase at a pound sale ;
sec. 28 (ii).
A poundkeeper acting as auctioneer at a pound sale need not be so
licensed ; see the Auction Sales Act 1890, sec. 29.
In a case before the County Court at Sale, where a horse was
impounded and incorrectly described in the Gazette advertisement,
and sold nineteen days after publication of notice instead of twenty-
one days, and the plaintiff sued the shire council for damages, an
objection was taken that the poundkeeper, although appointed by
the council, and paid by them, was a public servant holding an office
under the Pounds Act, and not a servant of the council, and the
objection was upheld; Boss v. Sale Council , 5 A.L.R. (C.N.) 18.

between such sale and the next day appointed

and dispose of the carcasses in such way as
he may think best, and any proceeds of any sale
of such carcasses or any portion thereof shall be
deemed the proceeds of the sale of impounded
cattle.
In this section also no provision is made for payment of any
deficiency in fees and charges ; see notes to sec. 22.
24. The proceeds of all sales of impounded
cattle sold under the provisions of this Act shall
be applicable in payment —First, of any costs

payable as the case may be into the consolidated
revenue or any municipal fund ; and fourthly,
to the impounder of such cattle of the rates due
to him for the trespass thereof, and the residue
if any shall be payable to the owner of such
cattle; but if such rates or residue be not
claimed by any person entitled thereto within
six years after such sale, or in case such person
shall have been an infant, feme covert , of un-
sound mind, or beyond the seas at the time of
such sale within six years after the termination
of such disability, the same shall form part of
the consolidated revenue or the municipal fund
of any municipality within which such pound is

The proceeds of every pound sale shall in

purposes aforesaid in such manner as may be
directed from time to time by the Governor in
Council, and in case the pound be within a
municipality shall be received by such person
and dealt with for the purposes aforesaid as may
be directed by the council of such municipality,
and in default of any such directions the proceeds
of such sale shall be received by the pound-
keeper, and by him applied as hereinbefore
directed.
And if within fourteen days after any pound
sale any person entitled to any trespass rates or
to any residue of the proceeds of such sale, shall
not have claimed payment thereof, such pound-
keeper shall pay the amount of such trespass
rates or residue in case his pound be not within
any municipality to some receiver of revenue,
and in case his pound be within a municipality
into the municipal fund of such municipality,
but such payment shall not prejudice the right
of any person to the amount so paid or any part
thereof.
In the case of a pound within a municipality the proceeds of the
sale are to be applied :—(1) In payment to the persons entitled
thereto of the costs and charges of the sale. (2) In reimbursement
to the poundkeeper of any expenses incurred in sustenance of the
cattle, and in payment of any surplus of sustenance fees into the
municipal fund. (3) In payment into the municpal fund of the pound

owner of the cattle.
The proceeds of sale are to be received and applied by the pound-
keeper, unless otherwise directed by the council of the municipality.
Failure by the poundkeeper to pay over money payable is an offence
under sec. 28 (iv).

On an appeal from Petty Sessions it was held that the object of
this notice was to get a fund in hand to satisfy the claim of the
owner ;it was not a condition precedent to the right to sue. A
complaint against the impounder of sheep for illegally impounding
them might be maintained by the owner after obtaining their release,
although no notice of the intention to complain had been given at
the time to the poundkeeper; Stephen v. Gill , 3 V.L.R. (L.) 178.
In the above appeal, however, the respondent was not represented,
and the case was not argued. The decision was over-ruled in Reg.

Object of notice.


A notice under this section of the intention to complain against
the impounder for illegally impounding is essential to the validity of
an order under sec. 26 finding that the impounding was illegal and
giving damages, though the owner may not seek to have the cattle
released before such order ; Stephen v. Gill over-ruled; Reg. v.
Taylor , ex parte Haiku, 8 V.L.R. (L.) 149; and see Turner v.
Williamson , 11 V.L.R. 432; 7 A.L.T. 49.
In the above case {Reg. v. Taylor , ex parte Hailes ), it was held
that the want of the notice justified the poundkeeper in refusing to
obey an order of justices made under the Police Offences Statute 1865
to deliver up cattle illegally detained.
If no notice be given there is no starting point for the ten days
named in section 26 within which the complaint is to be brought;
per Holroyd, J ., in Reg. v. Taylor , ex parte Hailes , supra.
The notice of intention to complain to be given to the pound-
keeper must be given at the same time with the release of the cattle.
Under the Pounds Statute 1865 (No. 249) it was held that a notice
given within two days of the release was bad ; Parker v. Kelly , 4
W.W. & a’B. (L.) 28. The giving of a notice constitutes the pound-
keeper a stakeholder, and if not given properly the damages might
be wrongfully paid over ; Ibid.
When an information under sec. 30 (iii) for illegally impounding
is laid against an impounder it is not necessary that strict proof of
the notice in writing to the poundkeeper under this section should be
given, since by neglecting to give the notice the complainant only
deprives himself of the right to claim from the poundkeeper the
trespass rates paid to and retained by him; Reg. v. Littleton , ex
parte Kirk , 6 A.L.T. 21. It is only in proceedings against the 1
poundkeeper for the illegal detention of the cattle impounded that
it is necessary to give such proof of the notice ; Ibid , and see Turner
v. Williamson , 11 V.L.R. 432; 7 A.L.T. 49.

This notice is sometimes called a “protest.” It is more than a
protest; it must state the intention to complain to a justice.
(c) Justices have jurisdiction under this and the next following
sections to award damages to the owner of stock illegally impounded,
whether the illegality arises out of a breach of the Act or is merely
a wrong at common law, because the stock were not trespassing when
impounded. Sec. 25 is clearly limited to cases where cattle are
illegally impounded under the Act, i.e., to cases where some violation
of the Act has occurred, such as not impounding the cattle in the
nearest accessible pound to the place where they were found tres-
passing, and sec. 26 is undoubtedly tied to see. 25, because it starts
off with the words “every such complaint.” But in see. 26 are
inserted further words. The section having given the jurisdiction
then contemplates something further, and says that the magistrates
may find that the cattle were not trespassing at all. That is an
illegal impounding altogether; Me Lean v. Dtrham, 28 V.L.R. 564;
9 A.L.R. 1. See note (c) to sec. 26.
26. Every such complaint shall be made
within ten days after the giving of such notice
in writing (a); and shall be heard and determined
in a summary manner before any two or more
justices, who may dismiss the same or may find
that the cattle were not trespassing or that such
impounding was illegal ( h ) under this Act or
that the rates demanded for the trespass of such
cattle are excessive, and may make an order
against the defendant for the amount of damages
(c) sustained by the owner in consequence of
such illegal impounding or excessive demand

and for the amount of all pound and other
authorized fees and charges paid by the owner
to the poundkeeper as aforesaid, and such order
shall be an authority to the poundkeeper to pay
to such owner such trespass rates so retained by
him ( d ). And the said justices may hear and

any question of title to the property or sugges-
tion of right that may be involved therein (e).
See notes to sec. 25.
This and the preceding section deal with irregularities in impound-
ing, and not with the offence of illegally impounding ; see Turner v.
Williamson, 11 V.L.R. 432; 7 A.L.T. 49.
(а) In the computation of time with reference to the interpreta- '
tion of Acts the number of days is to be reckoned exclusively of the
first day and inclusively of the last day ; Watson v. Issell, 16 V.L.R.
607.
A, complaint under this section by an owner of cattle impounded ;
against the impounder for illegally impounding or for demanding j
excessive trespass rates must be preceded by the notice to the
poundkeeper required by section 25, and must be made within ten
days after giving such notice ; Turner v. Williamson, supra.
Formerly, if any one irregularity in the distress were committed 1
it vitiated the whole, and made the distrainor a trespasser ab initio ;
1 Vent. 37. But it was provided by Statute 11 Geo. 11. c. 19 that
for any unlawful act done the whole should not be unlawful, or the
party a trespasser ab initio.
(б) Illegally Impounding (under Sec. 26) — See note (c) to sec. i
30 (iii). ’
Illegal impounding under this section must be for sending cattle ’
to a pound not being the nearest accessible pound (see see. 16), or for
impounding cattle not liable to be impounded at all; per Fellows,
J., in Robertson v. Main, 1 V.L.R. (L.) 5. There are only two
kinds of illegally impounding ; one for not sending the cattle to the
nearest accessible pound, and the other for impounding cattle not

liable to be impounded. The only questions which the justices can
hear and determine under this section are whether the cattle were or
were not trespassing ; whether the impounding was or was not
illegal by reason of the cattle having been impounded in a pound
not being the nearest accessible pound ; and whether the rates
demanded for the trespass of the cattle are or are not excessive. It
is only in one or more of these cases that compensation can be
awarded by the summary mode of procedure to the owner of cattle
impounded. Per Higinbotham, G.J., in McLaurin v. Griffin, 13
V.L.R. 140 ; 8 A.L.T. 192. The ruling in the above eases was
followed by Hood,J., in McLean v. Derham, 28 V.L.R. 564; 9
A.L.R. 1 ; see note (c) to sec. 26.
See note (a) to sec. 16 as to the meaning of “nearest accessible
pound.”
Proceedings under this and the preceding section are in the nature
of a civil remedy ; under sec. 30 they are for an offence. The notice
to the pouudkeeper is a condition precedent to seeking the civil
remedy; Turnery. Williamson, 11 V.L.R. 432; 7 A.L.T. 49.
Under the Pounds Act 1855 (18 Viet. No. 30), the word “ illegal ”
meant simply illegal by non-conformity with the requirements of
that Act as to the modus operandi, prescribed by it; Degraves v.
Bennett, 2 W. & W. (L.) 191 ; and see Jones v. Capron, Sup. Ct. Vic.,
22 June, 1869. And under the Pounds Statute 1865 (No. 249) it was
held that justices had no jurisdiction to enter into the question
whether there was power to impound from unfenced land, but were
confined to inquiring whether the requirements of the Act had been
complied with; O’Keefe v. Behan, 2 V.R. (L.) 16; 2 A.J.R. 19.
And in another ease under the same Act it was decided that the
legality of the impounding which the justices had to try was simply
whether the requirements of the Act had been complied with ; it was
not part of their duty to decide whether or not the impounding was
justifiable ; “ illegal ” means contrary to the provisions of the particu-
lar enactment—not unjustifiable; Kowe v. Middleton, 2 V.R. (L.)
59 ; 2 A.J.R. 54.
The driving of cattle across the land of their owner on the way to
pound does not render the impounding illegal; Trainer v. Lott,
Argus Rep. 8 July 1864.
Notice to the owner of impounded cattle is not necessary to make
the impounding legal; Ross v. Costello, 13 A.L.T. 215.

Where M. seized cattle and put them in his yard and demanded
trespass for them and said he would send them to the pound if the
trespass money were not paid, and the poundkeeper refused to im-
pound the cattle, and thereupon M. let them go, it was held that :
there was a seizure only and not an impounding, and that a convic-
tion for illegally impounding was wrong ; In re Rawlings, ex parte
Mahoney , 1 W.W. & a’B. (L.) 22.
The defendant having seized cattle belonging to the complainant
which had trespassed drove them to the pound, and before impound-
ing the cattle agreed to accept two shillings per head for the damage
done. The complainant paid the sum demanded, which was not a
trespass rate authorized by the Act; but the defendant nevertheless
impounded the cattle. The defendant being charged with having
illegally impounded the cattle, it was held that this was not an
illegal impounding under the Act, as there was no violation by the
defendant of the express provisions of the Act; Reg. v. Edwards ,
ex parte Marrinan, 13 V.L.R. 50; 8 A.L.T. 148.
An owner is not bound to avail himself of the statutory remedy
given by this section, but if he do so he is bound to comply with the
provisions of the Act; Turner v. Williamson , supra.
The words “ impounding was illegal ” in this section bear the same
meaning as the words “illegally impounding” in sec. 30 (iii);
McLaurin v. Griffin, 13 V.L.R. 140; 8 A.L.T. 192.
The nature of the illegality must be set forth in the order of
justices for illegally impounding under this section; Reg. v. Littleton ,
ex parte Kirk , 6 A.L.T. 21.
(c) Damages. —The justices cannot in one proceeding make an
order against a defendant for damages under this section, and by
the same order impose a penalty for illegally impounding under sec.
30 (iii). Such proceedings may, however, be amended by the Court;
Reg. v. Heron , ex parte Jones , 8 V.L.R. (L.) 140 ; 4 A.L.T. 6.
Justices have jurisdiction under this section to award damages to
the owner of stock illegally impounded, whether the illegality arises
out of a breach of the Act or is merely a wrong at common law,
because the stock were not trespassing when impounded. It is
noticeable that the words “ under this Act” are left out of this part
of the section, and, therefore, the justices may make such an order
for illegally impounding, whether that illegality is under the Act or
under the common law ; McLean v. Derham , 28 V.L.R. 564 ; 9

(c) As to ousting the jurisdiction of justices by raising a question
of title controlling the right to impound, see Dei/raves v. Bennett, 2
W. & VV. (L.) 191 ; O’Keefe v. Behan, 2 V.R. (L.) 16 ; 2 A. J.R. 19;
Rowe v. Middleton, 2 V.R. (L.) 59; 2 A.J.R. 54. This section,
however, authorizes justices to hear and determine complaints not-
withstanding the question of title may be involved. The decisions
in the above cases are therefore not applicable to the present law;
see McLaurin v. Griffin, supra. They are, however, referred to here
as bearing on the law of impounding generally, and to avoid errors
in quoting cases which have been over-ruled or superseded.
The vague wording and apparent inconsistency of sections 25 and
26 are discussed in the “ Introduction.”
27. A copy of the Government Gazette con-
taining a notification of the establishment or
abolition of any pound or of the appointment
suspension or removal of any poundkeeper, or
of the fixing of any rates fees (a) or charges
under this Act, or of any matter or thing re-
quired to be done by or under this Act, shall be
vrimd facie evidence that such pound was duly
established or abolished, and that such pound-
keeper was duly appointed suspended or removed
and that such matter or thing has been duly
done and performed.
(a) See note (a) to sec. 9.
In cases where the pound is under the control of a municipal
council the appointment or removal of a poundkeeper is made by the
council ; see sec. 5.
A poundkeeper is not bound to produce his appointment to a per-
son impounding cattle. The fact that he is so acting is sufficient;
and a poundkeeper’s statement if not objected to at the time is
sufficient evidence of his appointment; Ross v. Costello, 13 A.L.T.

any offence against the provisions of
this Act not hereinbefore provided for.
[a) This section is not retrospective. Under the Pounds Statute
1865 (No. 249), sec. 20, it was not an offence for a poundkeeper to
assist in driving cattle to the pound. It is created an offence by
this section ; Anderson v. Deasy, 5 A.J.R. 14.
(5) See notes to see. 9. Sustenance fees are chargeable even though
the poundkeeper has not been at any expense for the sustenance of
animals impounded ; Lament v. Bennett , 28 V.L.R. 438; 8 A.L.R.
177.
(c) See notes to sec. 24.

poundkeeper is charged with losing any im-

proved that any cattle were impounded in the
custody of such poundkeeper such cattle shall
be deemed to have been lost through his
negligence unless such poundkeeper shall prove
the contrary. And every poundkeeper shall
for the purposes of this section be allowed to
give evidence on his own behalf.
A poundkeeper would be liable at common law for keeping cattle
in an unlit pound or neglecting to properly sustain them ; Wilder v.
Speer, BA. & E, 547; 3N.& P. 536 ; Bignell v. Clark, 5 H. & N.
485 ;29L. J. Ex. 257 ; see Lodge v. Rowe, 1 V.L.K. (L.) 65. This
would also apply to a distrainor who detains cattle in his private
pound under sec. 13.
See note {d) to sec. 28; Harney v. Kean, supra; and notes to
sec. 9.
( a ) Under the Animals Protection Act 1890 (No. 1064) sec. 14, if
any animal be impounded and shall be confined without sufficient
food and water for more than twenty-four hours (or in case of
ruminants for more than thirty-six hours) any person whomsoever
may without being liable for trespass enter the pound or enclosure
and supply such animal with fit and sufficient food and water, and
the cost of such sustenance is recoverable from the owner of the
animal. And see sec. 7of the same Act.
Under the English Act, 12 & 13 Viet. c. 92 sec. 5, a person im-
pounding cattle in a private pound was required to properly sustain
them; see Danjan y. Davies, 2 Q.B.D. 118; 46 L.J.M.C. 122.
30. If any other person commit any of the (
next following offences he shall on conviction for-'

The Pounds
Act 1874.
(i.) Rescuing (a) or attempting to rescue

or seized for the purpose of being im-
pounded :
(n.) Destroying or injuring or attempting
to destroy or injure any pound ( b) :
(in.) Illegally impounding any cattle (c) :

per authority from the land of any
other person without previous notice
to such person his agent or overseer :
(vn.) Wilfully leaving open any gate or slip-
panel or making a gap in any fence for
the purpose of permitting or causing
any cattle to trespass or otherwise


wilfully causing any cattle to tres-
pass ( d ) :
(vm ) Failing to comply with or committing
any offence against the provisions of
this Act not hereinbefore provided
for (e).
(a) Rescue.— Rescue is also an offence at common law. Under
the Act rescue must be interpreted as at common law. It is the
forcible taking of cattle distrained before they are impounded out
of the possession of some individual in whose actual custody they
are by law ; Bui. N.P. 84 ; Co. Litt. 1606 ; Lodge v. Howe, 1 V.L.R.
(L.) 65.
Rescue must be made by the owner or his agent; Bro. Abr.
“Rescocs,” pi. 7, 12; and not by a stranger who has no right to
dispute the distress; 7 Roll. Abr. 673. But qucere whether rescue
under the Act would not apply to a person other than the owner or
his agent.
There may be rescue at law as well as in deed. If, however, the .
distrainor has never been in possession there can be no rescue ; Co.
Litt. 1606. And where a distrainor quits possession of the cattle
the retaking of them by the owner is not a rescue; Dod v. Monger, j
6. Mod. 216 ; Brad. 282. Where the distress is altogether contrary
to law they may be re-taken ; see Bro. Abr. “ Rkscous,” pi. 14, 18 ;
Bullen on Distress, 207. If the distress be taken wrongfully and
without cause they may be rescued by the owner. But if they are ,
once impounded, even though taken without any cause, the owner
may not break the pound and take them out, for they are then in
the custody of the law; Co. Litt. 47. If cattle stray from the
custody of the distrainor he may retake them wherever he finds
them, and again impound them ; but he must not break the peace ;
Co. Litt. 476, 1606.
To constitute rescue there must be something amounting to a j
breach of the peace or likely to provoke a breach of the peace, and
a taking in the presence of the keeper [see Hex v. Bradshaw, 7 C. &
P. 233]; Lodge v. Rowe, 1 V.L.R. (L.) 65.
If a distrainor takes a distress out of the place where it was 1

it the owner may interfere and take it out of his possession without
rendering himself liable either for rescue or for pound breach ;
Smith v. Wright, 6 H. & N. 821 ; 30 L.J. Ex. 313.
Where the owner of an impounded horse having notice of the im-
pounding took the horse out of a paddock belonging to the pound-
keeper but at some distance from the proclaimed pound, in which
paddock it had been placed by the poundkeeper after the impounding,
it was held that this did not constitute the offence of rescuing ;
Lodge v. Rowe, supra.
The plaintiff distrained defendant’s cattle damage feasant, and
went to apprise the defendant. During his absence the cattle
escaped for half-an-hour into the defendant’s ground, whence the
plaintiff on his return drove them to his own yard. The defendant
having taken them thence, it was held that it was no rescue, as the
leaving the cattle in the defendant’s ground was an abandonment of
the trespass ; Knowles v. Blake, 5 Bing. 499.
Where there is no evidence of an element to constitute the offence
it was held that prohibition would lie in the case of a conviction.
Where prohibition would lie that was the only statutory remedy
which could be applied, and an order to quash would not lie ; Reg.
v. Hare, ex parte Haljord, 7 A.L.T. 142; see Justices Act 1890, sees.
150-155.
(b) The offence under this part of the section is for destroying or
injuring a pound, irrespective of any release or rescue of cattle
therefrom. This does not comprise the offence of pound breach,
which is an offence at common law.
Pound Breach. —Pound breach is the breaking of the pound or
any part thereof, and re-taking cattle distrained after they are im-
pounded. As soon as they are impounded in a lawful pound they
are in the custody of the law, and cannot be re-taken without the
party being guilty of pound breach ; F.N.B. 100 ; Always v. Broom,
2 Lutw. 1262.
Pound breach was always an offence at common law. It is a mis-
demeanour punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both ; Rex v.
Bradshaw, 7C. &P. 233. At common law pound breach is a higher
offence than an unlawful rescue, for if a man break a pound or lock
or any part of the enclosure in which animals are detained in the
Section 30.

custody of the law, he offends against the peace : 1 Russ. 363 ;
Bullen on Distress, 210.
There is a marked distinction between rescuing cattle under dis-
traint and pound breach. A pound breach may take place without
any breach of the peace against any individual. It is an insult to
the majesty of the law to take an animal out of a proclaimed en-
closure, and it is not necessary that any person should be present in
custody of the cattle at the time, as the walls or fences are a sufficient
protection ; per Barry, J., in Lodge v. Rowe, 1 Y.L.R. (L.) 65.
To constitute pound breach there must be a criminal intention ;
Lodge v. Rowe, supra ; and actual force is not necessary ; Trevanion’s
case, 11 Mod. 132.
Where cattle which had been impounded were placed by the pound-
keeper in a paddock belonging to him and kept there, and the owner
of the cattle removed the slip rails and took the cattle out, it was held
that this was not pound breach ; Lodge v. Rowe, supra.
(c) The Offence of Illegally Impounding.— See notes to secs.
25 and 26.
The offence of illegally impounding is created for the first time by
this sub-section. Under the old Acts illegal impounding was not
an offence ; it merely gave a civil remedy, as under secs. 25 and 26.
Here it is a penal offence; Robertson v. Main, I V.L.R. (L.) 5.
Illegally impounding means impounding without colour of right.
Sections 25 and 26 deal with irregularities in impounding. Though
the word “ complaint” and not “ information” is used, the proceed-
ing under this section is for an offence. That under sections 25 and
26 is for a civil remedy, in which case notice to the poundkeeper
under section 25 is a condition precedent; Turner v. Williamson, 11
V.L.R. 432; 7 A.L.T. 49. But not under this section; Reg. v.
Littleton, ex parte Kirk, 6 A.L.T. 21.
There must be a violation of the express provisions of the Act to
constitute illegal impounding; Reg v. Edwards, ex parte Marrinan,
13 Y.L.R. 50; 8 A.L.T. 148. The words “illegally impounding”
in this sub-section bear the same meaning as the words “ such
impounding was illegal ” do in section 26; the offence of illegally
impounding applies only to impounding cattle elsewhere than in
the nearest accessible pound ; McLaurin v. Griffin, 13 Y.L.R,
Section 30.

Non-compliance with the direction in see. 16 as to the memo-
randum to be given to the poundkeeper is not within the offence of
illegally impounding created by this section ; Robertson v. Main, 1
V.L.R. (L.) 5 ; though it may constitute an offence under sec. 30 (viii);
McLaurin v. Griffin, supra. And a person seizing cattle with the in-
tention of impounding them and afterwards abandoning his intention
and letting them go cannot be convicted of the offence of illegally im-
pounding ; In re Raidings, ex parte Mahoney, 1 W.W. & a’B. (L.)
•22. And the detention of cattle and the lodgment of them in the
pound by the defendant after payment of a demand by the distrainor,
though it might be a wrongful detention and a wrongful and even
an illegal impounding at common law, giving a right of action to the
owner of the cattle, is not an illegal impounding under the Act con-
stituting an offence under this section ; Reg. v. Edwards, ex parte
Marrinan, 13 V.L.R. 50; 8 A.L.T. 148,
A defendant cannot plead generally a common law right of im-
pounding, and thus cast upon the plaintiff the burden of alleging
and proving that the defendant has not complied with the require-
ments of the Act; Sanderson v. Fotheringham, 10 V.L.R. (L.) 17 ; 5
A.L.T. 172; per Hir/inhotham, J.
Justices cannot in one proceeding order payment of damages for
trespass under sec. 26, and also impose a penalty for illegally im-
pounding under this section ; Re;y. v. Heron, ex parte Jones, 8 V.L.R.
(L.) 140; 4 A.L.T. 6.
(d) By agreement under section 6 of the Fences Act 1890 between
adjoining land-owners whose natural boundary was a creek, a dividing
fence was so erected as to give one of them occupation of laud on the
side of the creek opposite his holding, and included in his neighbour’s
certificate of title. After a lapse of fifteen years the tenant of the
neighbour made a gap in the dividing fence in order to obtain access
to a dam in the creek for the use of his stock. It was held that the
tenant was liable under this sub-section, notwithstanding the pro-
visions of section 6 of the Fences Act relative to possession of land
under such circumstances ; Paterson v. Goode, 8 A.L.R. 156.

offence unless the statute creating the offence so provides ; Pense v.

A refusal to release cattle seized on tender of the legal rate is an
offence under this sub-section ; Persse v. Smith , supra. Aud neglect-
ing to give the memorandum required to he given by sec. 16 may
also constitute an offence under this sub-section ; McLanrin v. Griffin,

31. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed
to affect The Land Act 1869, the Land Act
1890, or any Act thereby repealed.
As to impounding from commons, see notes to sec. 16.
The Land Act 1901 (No. 1749), sec. 165, provides Sec. 165.
The lessee and his assigns of a pastoral allotment or grazing area
under this Part, and the licensee of an agricultural or grazing allot-
ment under this Part and his assigns, and the person or persons in
whom the interest or any part thereof of any such lessee or licensee
may at any time under this Part become vested, and the purchaser
of any land under any Act in force before the commencement of this
Act, shall have all the rights as against persons trespassing with any
cattle or swine (but not against other mere trespassers) which at
law belong to the owner in possession of any land as against
trespassers thereon, except the right of impounding such cattle
or swine ; and shall have the said last mentioned right when
and so soon as the pastoral allotment grazing area or agricultural
or grazing allotments, or such part of the pastoral allotment grazing
area or agricultural or grazing allotment or of any land purchased
under any Act heretofore in force as may be trespassed upon has
been enclosed either alone or with any adjoining land in the
occupation of the same person with a substantial fence, but not
before.”
Compare the Land Act 1869 (No. 360), sec. 30.
Under the Land Act 1865 (No. 237) pigs could not he impounded, j

It lies upon the defendant to show under which Act the com-
plainant’s purchase falls, if he would oust his common law’ right of
impounding; McMillan v. Gove., 1 V.L.R. (L.) 142.
Under an analogous provision in the Land Act 1865 a selector had
no right to impound cattle trespassing upon his land until it had been
fenced, but he might drive them off or restore them to the owner and
recover trespass damage ; McMillan v, Gove, supra. However, under
the Pounds Act 1874 then in force, sec. 15, cattle might be restored and
trespass rates recovered “whether such cattle were liable to be im-
pounded or not, ’ and the decision in McMillan v. Gove was given on
this section. The above w’ords were repealed by section 3of the Act
No. 905. Section 12 of the present Act (analogous to the above sec-
tion 15 of the Act of 1874) applies only where the cattle are liable
to be impounded ; see judgment of Holroyd, J, in Allan v. Mclntyre,
8 V.L.R. (L.) 133 ; 4 A.L.T. 4. A licensee under section 19 of the
Land Act 1869 had no right to recover trespass rates or damage under
the Pounds Act until he had enclosed his land with a substantial
fence. In fact an unfenced licensee does not come within the pro-
visions or purview of the Pounds Act ; Allan v. Mclntyre, supra.
In order to entitle a licensee of an agricultural allotment under the
Land Act 1884, sec. 120 (almost identical with section 165 of the
Land Act 1901, supra), to impound sheep trespassing on his allot-
ment, the fence must have been a sheep-proof fence. The term
“ substantial fence ” in sec. 120 of the Land Act 1884 (sec. 165 of
Act No. 1749) means a substantial fence having regard to the
character of the animal trespassing. A fence which may keep out
cattle and horses may not keep out sheep ; Bourchier v. Mitchell, 16
V.L.R. 415. And if the land is unfenced he could not impound at
all ; Ibid. It will be observed, however, that sheep and goats (in-
cluded in the Land Act 1890) have been omitted from the present
Land Act, so that as to these animals the ordinary rule of im-
pounding will apply. See notes to sec. 9.
Travelling sheep may be driven across land under grazing licence
for the purpose of gaining access to a road, provided that at no part
of the crossing are the sheep outside the statutory distance under
section 131 of the Land Act 1890 ; Ricketson v. Bourchier, 12 A.L.T.
