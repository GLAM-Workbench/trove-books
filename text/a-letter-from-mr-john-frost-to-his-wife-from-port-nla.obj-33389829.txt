POET ARTHUR, VAN DZEBKAN?B LAND
July 2 Ist, 1640.
EAREST MARY,?
'he words Norfolk Island and Port Arthur convev to
the minds of the English people, places of extreme suffering. They
are penal settlements, to which, generally, persons are sent, who',
being prisoners, have committed their offences in the colony. The
punishment here is great, but the persons who are sent here are
frequently old offenders. There are various reasons assigned for
sending us to Port Arthur, but as it is impossible that I can be
acquainted with the true one, 1 shall merely state the facts. lam
at Port Arthur; a place to which the very worst of men are sent,
and where human misery may be seen to, probably, its greatest
extent. 1 was not, however, sent here for what is called punish-
ment; the Governor told us repeatedly that we were not sent to
Port Arthur as apunishment, but to fill certain offices. Williams
is a Superintendent at the coal mines; Jones tills a situation at the
Juvenile Establishment; and lam in the office of the Command-
ant, that is, the Governor of Port Arthur. am acting here as a
Clerk, and hitherto the labour has not been heavy. lam in ex-
cellent health?l never was better; and my spirits are very good,
considering all things?much better than I could possibly have
anticipated. The climate is, so far as I have seen, very good ;
milder, I expect, than our own country ; the situation of the set-
tlement must be healthy, we have a line open bay before us.
Indeed, from the appearance of most of the prisoners, and from
what I hear, 1 think Port Arthur is a very healthy place.
So much, my love, for this part of the subject. You are aware
that all letters sent from, and received by every prisoner,are read by the


Commandant,and though 1 believe that that gentleman would not be
very particular in a correspondence between a husband ami a wife
yet it i* a great check to that freedom of communication, which, to be
affectionate, must be unrestrained. Politics are, I believe, for-
bidden; yet it is a subject very much connected with my affairs.
There are various matters of a public nature which affect our situa-
tions; I shall, however, leave that subject till I hear from England.
1 am of opinion that my letters will be persued by others besides
the gentleman who rules here. 1 suppose the Colonial Secretary
would be glad to have a peep at the letters of his old correspondent.
Well, I trust that if Lord John llussell should break the seal of
my letters, he will have so much of the gentleman about him, as to
send thei ccording to their address.
1 wrote to you, my dear Mary, from the Cape oi Good Hope;
also to Mr. George Rogers. I hope you have received them. I see
that you received my letters sent from Falmouth.. I behove, my
love, that every thing is done for the best ; but omissions and
additions do not dovetail well; however, you are the hd|t Judges,
exercise your own discretion, and he assured that hnsbund
will believe that every thing is done for the best.
I have almost forgotten the subjects of the letter sent from the
Cape; it was written in the hospital of the ship, amidst the tum-
bling and tossing of the vessel, and noise of all sorts ; a place very'
unfavourable to correctncssof composition. You were, and so were
my friends, 1 dare say, glad to hear from me; and particular to
findthat I was in excellent health. You know l.ow much 1 suffered,
and how much I dreaded sea-sickness. Strange, passing strange,
that in a voyage of sixteen thousand miles, I felt scarcely any sick-
ness, nor was my stomach once disordered. So little do I now
dread a sea voyage, that I like it. I should like, itt.� good ship,
and in pleasant company, a voyage to any part of the world.
We arrived at Symend?s Hay, Cape of Good Hope, on the 6th
of May, after a remarkable tine passage. There were some ships
of war intended for the Chine expedition. I had a long conversa-
tion with some military and naval officers, some of whom were in
England during the time of our trials. The first Lieutenant of
one of the gun brigs had been to Newport. VVe left the Cape on
the J3th. The Doctor put into the for the purpose of
obtaining fresh provisions, the scurvy madehs appearance on board
our ship. I can assure you, my dear, that the Cape beef, although
not the be*' I ever saw, was very acceptable afteroursalt provisions.
We bad no wind for several days filler we left the Cape, and
our progress was slow ; but alrout the latter end of the month we
had plenty of it. The greaterof the month of June was ex-
ceedingly tempestuous. On dth of June, Whitsun-Mondny,
it blew great guns; the oldesCaailors on board scarcely ever re-
collected such a hurricane. During the night, many supposed
'hat our danger was extreAj frhe ship (an excellent sailer) tum-
bled about merrily. fore and main hatchways battoned
down ; the mizen hatch opened a little to admit air to the prison-
ers, through which opening the sea was pouring in streams, so


that the hospital, under the quarter-deck, was half filled with
water. The ship rode it out well. The 13th, 16th, 19th, 20th,
and 21st, were exceedingly boisterous; however, on the last ciy
of June, we anchored in tnc Derwnny, before Hobart Town; we
were exactly four calendar months from England; we left Fal-
mouth on tnc last day of February. Here we were supplied im-
mediately with fresh provisions, principally mutton ; and though
what we had was much inferior to our English mutton, we thought
it capital, after the convict salt junk. The next day our friend,
the Doctor, waited on the Governor, Sir John Franklyn, and, I
have no doubt, did everything in his power for us. It is usual
for the doctors of convict ships to give each prisoner a character,
according to his behaviour on board the ship, and the character
given lias some influence on the fate of the prisoner. We arrived
on the Tuesday. On the Thursday, we were informed that the
Governor would come on board on Saturday, and that we should
all be landed on the Monday morning. At four o?clock, on
Friday morning, we were told that we must prepare to leave that
day for Port Arthur; we were rather astounded at this informa-
tion. Port Arthur ! a penal settlement; while the most able men
at the bar contended that we had had no legal trial, while our
case was, when we left, before the House of Commons, &c. &c.
It was intimated, I do not know how true, that these were in-
structions from the highest authority, and that it was intended to
favour us. *On the Friday coming, we were taken on board the
colonial schooner, Eliza, and soon after, the Governor came on
board ; and his Excellency addressed us for a considerable time,,
pointing out the regulations under which we should be placed,
recommending a certain line of conduct, and informing us re-
peatedly, that we were not sent to the penal settlement for punish-
ment. As soon os the Governor left, the ship sailed; and the next
morning, Saturday, the 4 th? of July, the ever memorable day, held
in such estimation in the United States, we were landed at Port
Arthur, the penal settlement for Van Diemen?s land; we were
taken into the Commandant's Office, where the regulations for
prisoners were read to us. They are, my dear, as you may sup-
pose, pretty stringent; but I have no doubt that I shall be enabled
to observe them. certainly were not treated as the generality
of prisoners are treated on their arrival; they are taken to the
shoemaker?s shop, stripped quite naked; all thei: clothes taken
from them and burneef; they are then put in the prison-dress?
generally yellow, sometimes black and yellow. We were dot
treated so ; we kept all our clothes, and we now wear some of
them. So far, there has been a great difference made.
I inform you, my dear Mary, of these particulars, because 1
wish the exact state of things to be known. I understand that a
strong feeling was produced in the colony by our being sent down
to Port Atthur, and I have no doubt that great indignation will
be felt in England, Scotland, and'W&ies when it is known. It
will be said that we are on the chain gangs, and that we hre treated
as the vilest of the vile; I wish that trutn should prevail, and for


that reason 1 have stated facts; God knows that the very best situa-
tion in Port Arthur is bod enough privation and suffering; but our
situation is one of comfort, compared with that of many prison-
ers here. Yes, my dear Mary, and with many well-educatedand
talented ,men; however, my dear, I am, as I said before, in good
health and. spirits; prepared, as far as possible, to meet what-
ever ia prepared for me. While you and my dear family have
lieen anticipating the worst respecting me, the imagination draw-
ing pictures of hardships and suffering, very different from those 1
experienced. I have been engaged in the same work in regard to
you ; ami I hope with as little truth. 'Hie greatest misery I en-
dured was i" Monmouth Gaol; fancy ing that certain things
would take pJ-ce, and then feeling as if tney had actually occurred.
It. is unwise to be meeting coming events too favourably, because,
as the mind is likely to be affected by anticipation, it is less abh
to meet a reverse. On the other hand, to be continually looking
at the dark side is to be placed in continual misery. I need not
tell you, my dear, that I am exceedingly anxious to hear from
you ; anxious, very anxious, to hear of the welfare of my dear
children, relations, and friends; anxious to hear of the state of
things in .England?England, to which I am as much attached as
ever, even should I never again tread her shores. Her happiness
and her prosperity is, and ever xvill he, near my heart The poet
leaves here on Friday ; this is Wednesday; 1 shall close for the
present.
Thursday morning.?The post comes in to-day; I hope I shall
hare a letter. I trust that my dear children will evince a proper
degree of fortitude under our present circumstances: it is the only-
effectual mode to combat difficulties; to young people, particu-
larly, troubles are blessings in disguise; they prepare them for
the ills of life; they give them coolness to meet dangers and diffi-
culties, and many have been constrained to say, with the Psalmist,
"It was good for me that I was afflicted.? I hope my dear boy
will learn this lesson; I hope that ?1& Igis learnt it; he must see
that bis mother atid sisters are placed in a situation, which will
require of him a manly conduct Desirous as lam of addressing
particular individuals, I find it impossible; were I to begin, 1
should be likely to omit some,.which might give pain. My dear
children uid friends will not think I have forgotten, because I do
not name. liove to their father and their country will, I trust,
animate Diem to act in sneh a manner, that, in future times, the
recollection will be pleasing to them.
Friday morning.?Thu post leaves to-day ; no letter.
My kindest regards to all my dear family and friends. I will
w?ite in the course of next month.
Believe me, my dearest Mary,
Truly you re,? John Frost.
