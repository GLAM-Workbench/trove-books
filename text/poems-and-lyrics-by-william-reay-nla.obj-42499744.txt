THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.
It has long been the desire of my friends that I should publish
my poems and lyrics; but, before doing so, I thought it best to
submit them to some acknowledged authority, and get an opinion
as to their merit. I accordingly sent them to Mr. Joseph
Skipsey, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, England. Skipsey ha B
attained an eminent position among the Sons of Song of that
mighty land. His contributions to English literature have
been acknowledged by the English Government by the bestowal
of an annuity. His poems have been translated into the French
and German languages. He is now engaged in editing an
edition of the most eminent English poets. Each volume in
this edition contains a prefatory notice, biographical and critical,
written by Skipsey. Below are his remarks on a few of my
productions which I sent him.
W.REAY.
“ Tour poems are delightful, and display a great poetical
genius. ‘ The Meeting’ is worthy of Bums, and ‘ The Motherless
Foal’ is a master-piece. The power which you possess over the
peculiar stanza in which you enshrine so many of your
poetic fancies, feelings, and sentiments, appears to me to
be unexcelled by Bums. I have tried this stanza, but
have failed to satisfy myself. From you this form of verse
is always natural and easy, and accordingly delightful. It flows
from you as freely and delightfully as the stream that sparkles
in the light of the morning. All the rest of your poems are
characterized by a freshness and sweetness which are not to b®
found among the products of the polished writers of the age;


which age, I may add, is noted for polish both in literature and
painting, but little of the qualities which are dearest to the
human heart, and which will serve to interest when the studies
of the false are neglected. We as rarely as possible meet with
those touches of nature from the pen or pencil ‘ which make
the whole world akin.’ Tour great breadth and depth of
sympathy for nature, and especially human nature, has proved
your salvation in this respect. lam particularly pleased with
the sweetness, airiness and melody of your song ‘May
Morning.’ It is a gush of song worthy of our greatest poets. You
will understand what I mean, when I say that it has the
Shakspeare quality in it. The longer I live and the more I
study the subject the more I am convinced that nature ought
to pervade poetry. Your songs, as I have said, are full of
nature.
JOSEPH BKIPSEY.
“We can fully endorse these remarks, as Mr. Eeay’s
poems have often appeared in these columns to the great grati-
fication of our readers.”— Ed. Newcastle Herald and Advocate.


SONNETS.
TO A FRIEND.
1.
Why hast thou loitered from the muse so long;—
Thou, to whom the fairest gifts were lent,
To breathe in rapture, and pour forth in song
For.our great pleasure and thine ornament!
Why dost thou linger still, and be content
With things that perish soon, and fade away,
To be remembered in no lasting monument
Of pleasing ecstasy! or as the common clay
That takes no form, or uncommissioned weed
By the lone path—if such a thing there be—
Winning no wandering pilgrim in his speed
To dwell upon a beauty and a mystery f
Thus art thou losing what none else can claim, —
Neglecting thy high purpose and thy fame.
2.
I here might dwell upon the things that were,
And make thee feel a shame at thy poor heart,
For this bright world is just as full and fair,
As when thou revelled’st in the glorious art.
Where is that energy that roused thee when
Bright Luna trembled on the blushing wave,
And hailed thee from the foremost ranks of men
To paint her beauty, and thy soul to save
From dark obscurity and consuming time—
Where all things vanish, save the brave in soul.
Whose fair proportions in some powerful rhyme
May sway the tide of ages, and control
The evils that in states and times have been,
And lead to better themes, and fairer worlds unseen ?


3.
Cold winter hath not touched thy temple yet,
Nor thy sweet summer yet attained it’s prime,
Still, all those fancies lie like flowerets wet,
That used to bloom so fair in former time.
Arouse thy laggard muse from sleep supine,
And blame her for the pleasures we have lost
Through her dull silence—blank and saturnine—
All hid as neath cold winter rime and frost!
What if cold winter had crept round thy head!
Is there no living warmth within thy heart
To wake to life again what lie so dead—
The images of all things fair—and so start
Around thy charmed path, if thou wilt he
Obedient to thy star—the magic minstrelsy !
4.
Is there no beauty in the summer cloud ?
Is there no music in the summer wind ?
Is there no charm in winter’s snowy shroud,
Or in those mists where magic sits enshrined ?
Is there no beauty in the green clad field
When rising Phoebus wakes the fruitful cow ?
Is there no picture in the sturdy build
Of ploughmen as they guide the useful plough ?
Is there no echo in the watch-dog’s bark,
The honest guardian of his master’s house f
Is there no dream when all the world is dark
About thy children and thy faithful spouse ?
Is there no theme now that this world can give
To make thee breathe again and make us wish to live?
5.
Whene’er I gaze upon the opening rose,
And feel her fragrance, in the scented air,
I see her blushing ’neath her crimson woes
Because thy gentle presence is not there.
She blames thee as a jealous fair would blame,
And frowning that she should be thus neglected,
Unfolding in her wrath, she says her name
Should by thy muse, e’er this have been respected.
0 could I soothe her in her thorns of grief,
Or share one tear that falls upon her bosom,
Or smoothe the down upon each silken leaf,
1 then might win the care of this fair blossom.
What think’st thy muse now in her careless hours
To be uncpurteous to the first of flowers ?


6.
The little daisy with it’s golden eye
And snowy frill is weeping in the grass,
And trembling in her plight with many a sigh
To see thy form in vacant roaming pass;
Her simple charms that waked in former days
The sympathy of those so famed in song
Had thought to win from thee some meed of praise.
But now, alas, uncared for and among
A thousand shapely and misshapen things
Is wailing in her dark and drear recess,
Like an unhallowed thought which never springs
Around our path, nor yet our hearts to bless;
And thou art blamed for this, and none but thee,
A woeful grief to them, a greater grief to me.'
7.
But why particular should I be to name
The rose, the lily, or my own regret!
A thousand other things in grief complain
Because thy harp is now in silence set.
The mountain summits and the brawling brook
Have lost their harmony in peaceful hours,
And brave me with a blank where’er I look—
In open ways, or in lone hermit bowers.
The trees, the bracken, and the silent stone,
For thee had language that none else may know,
But now, alas, they droop and sigh and moan,
Chiding thee in my path where’er I go.
Why, why is this, thou careless son of song ?
Shall I begin to chide, or leave thee to thy wrong?
8.
Hast thou a power within thy soul to keep
This shameful silence, while we urge to hear
Those strains that did in happier moments creep
In pleasing cadence to the listening ear ?
The fairest of the nine now stands beside
Thy couch of indolence in great distress,
And weeping like a lone discarded bride,
As one who well had known thy fond caress.
Look at the beauty of her face, and say
If there be frost enough within thy heart
That she can woo thee, and yet turn away
From all that’s lovely in this world of art {
0! do not flee her when she fans the fire •
That once could warm thy heart, thy song inspire.


9.
Then do not dream thy useful time away ;
But seize the images that start before thee,
And mould them as a sculptor moulds his clay,
To be to us a faith, to thee a glory.
Hast thou no memory of that monster stone ?
That wide-eyed wonder of those distant ages ?
And but for that, and that huge thing alone,
What could we know of those Egyptian sages ?
Oh for a knowledge of that ancient man,
His genius, and Ms chisels and his thought,
His mystic mutterings e’er he thus began
To shadow forth his life, his soul, his God,
How many thousands here have bent the knee
Before this symbol God—this dull ear’d deity ?
10.
But what’s my case whenall is said and done ?
Perhaps tholrrt angry at my careful pains,
And blame me for the task I have begun,
Sneering at this or that my verse contains ?
But who did eat of that delicious fruit,
Thy muse, once found us in our times of leisure,
And then be patient like a careless mute,
Folding our arms without this rarest treasure ?
I will not, cannot hold my tongue, but write
And risk the rigour of thy powerful pen,
But I shall bear with patience all thy spite,
If I can set thee to thy theme again.
Ungrateful genius, let me hear thee say,
“ My harp shall sound again for thee some coming
day.”
TO B. EYTON BRADWYN, ARTIST,
On seeing his picture, “The Glowing West.”
Oh ! to be among those silent scenes with thee,
To dwell on all within this world of thine.
With stretch of thought that reaches through infinity,
When the grand clouds in evening glories shine!
How beautiful these woods seem in decay !
And peaceful the wanderings of this ancient stream!
Here might the dying swan sing his last lay,
And find a fitting echo to his theme !
Here might we five in fulness one dear hour
Of sacred sense, that finds no ending here,
*But leading upward to a grander power,
Eipening for a high and holier sphere.
Thus when our ending comes, may we find rest
In peaceful brightness like thy golden “ glowing
west.”


SONNET TO WILLIAM REAY, ARTIST,
HAMILTON.
(As “ s fitting echo” to his sonnet on ‘The Glowing West”)
Comingled with the perfume of the rose,
When pearl-bright hues adorn the “ Glowing West,”
Sweet is the song of bird at evening’s close,
As Vesper with her star brings calm repose
To nature’s scenes in sober grandeur dressed,
Where devious Hunter, hushed and peaceful flows
Unto old ocean’s deep, unfathomed breast—
As tranquil thought into the land of rest;
And sweet the mellow numbers of thy lays
To sympathetic minds that think with thee—
Oh! if pure admiration spring thy praise,
This commendation then accept from me;
And may no turmoil tear that glowing breast,
But there thy muse enshrined bind thee with
musings blest.
B. EYTON BRADWYN.
Newcastle, July, 1883.
SONNET TO JOHN CLARE.
The Northamptonshire Poet.Born 1793. Died 1854.
Unhappy, yet how happy, gentle Clare;
Such happiness as thine how few can find!
How often o’er thy page I bend to share
The tenderest breathings of thy purest mind!
What world’s wealth would my fond soul give
To purchase but one day to spend with thee
Among thy native scenes, where yet may live
Each prompter of thy kindest ecstasy !
To see thee pause beside thy favourite tree,
Sheltering from the sun or travelling shower.
Where each could warm and set thy fancies free,
With sweet devotion in each changing hour!
The meanest things that crawl upon the sod
To thee were preachers of the living God !


TO A PRIMROSE.
On seeing one artificially reared at Waratah Station,
September 16th, 1876.
1.
Thou sweet companion of an early day,
I ne’er did think that I should meet thee here,
In this far land, beneath the tropic ray,
At such unusual period of the year.
For this is not the day, nor month, nor hour
When I have found thee in thy happiest mood!
I’ve seen thee blither ’neath some pelting shower,
’Mongst leaves that withered near some naked wood.
Oh thou, the school-boy’s joy, the old man’s hope,
Thou first-born star that gilds the front of spring,
What are my feelings as I bend and stop
To gaze upon thy face thus wondering!
My heart is full, and my fond bosom heaves
While gazing on thy form and fondling with thy leaves.
2.
Now fondest memories glisten in mine eyes,
And tremble in my heart for days long spent
In the green fields! Oh childhood’s happy prize,
Thou make’st me feel most keen my banishment,
And send’st me to the press of men with sighs
For far off places and the peaceful shade
That once were mine beneath my native skies,
And thine the green hill side and silent glade !
Where are thy companions now! the’ lark,
Sweet breathing violets, and the snowdrop flower
That opened like a newborn thought, thou spark
New-dropped from heaven’s lap in careless hour,
To light us on our way to worlds more fair,
Where when I may sojourn, I’ll hope to meet thee
there!
SONNET IN ANSWER TO COMPLIMENTARY
POEM.
1.
What shall I say responsive to thy song,
In earnest energy expressed lor me—
Showing forth my weaknesses where thou art strong,
My unblown powers in thy maturity ?
In praising me thou art thyself best seen.
In proving what I should be, what thou art,
Thyself exampling what I might have been !
Had I like thee been borne for such a part.
0 happy Poet, this thy full blaze of kindness,
In complete music fills a joyous hour,
Yet thy clear vision but sets forth my blindness,


Which for thy love I yet might well endure.
I fear there is no light but in thy name
To guide some pilgrim to my niche of fame.
2.
Thine own perfections but expose my fault,
Thy well-trained Pegasus where mine doth stray,
Thy smoothest measures show where mine do halt,
Thy complete song my own poor broken lay.
Had I more wit I might more beauty see,
And had more music found my untimed ear
I might have penn’d some sonnet fit for thee,
As thou nast done for me in music clear.
I therefore dare not touch the harp’s fond string,
For lack of wit, and too much argument.
And that fine grace thy own sweet muse doth bring
Might make thee feel in me some discontent.
Thus take not what is writ, but what is meant
My unsaid thoughts pay thee best compliment.
A RAMBLING EPISTLE TO JOHN ROWELL,
A Poetical Friend in England, 1869.
John, when this missive comes to hand
Believe me still at home;
Not in a far off burning land
Where thou must never come.
I would not wish thee cross the sea,
Although I wish thy company.
Here blooms no wild rose in the glen,
No hawthorn on the brae,
No daisy bending on its stem
To greet the break of day,
No Robin red-breast kindly sings
To please the listening child,
Nor yellow youlan’s curious tongue
To charm the evening mild.
No fair bright land to wake the lyre
To burning words of living fire,
Is this to me I ween;
And shining on this silver sea,
The pale moon brings no charm for me,
How’er so bright the scene;
It lighteth up no fairy spot,
Gleams on no classic ground.


No ancient wall, no ivied grott
With olden memories crown’d,
And mystic lore of other days
To grace the poet’s glowing lays.
If e’er again I visit home —
E’er cross the foaming deep—
To long lost places I shall roam
That sweetest memories keep.
How lovingly I there should trace
Each nook and fairy glen,
That render dear my native place—
I’d live young life again.
How fondly I should stand to look
Upon that little wandering brook,
Whose little babblings seemed to say,
“ Come join me in my infant play.”
It danced along, it leaped in glee,
It seemed a happy thing like me ;
It’s breast was pure, and so was mine;
We both were young and both divine,
As we our little race did run,
In playful dimples to the sun.
But would it’s face be now as bright,
And fill me with the same delight?
Or would it cause the tears to flow,
When touching memories long ago ?
Would it’s music be the same
As then it was to me ?
Or would it sing that sadder strain
It may have sung to thee ?
Of one then I were sure to think,
When standing on it’s tiny brink, —
Of one whose soft and tender tone
Would call my little wanderings homo—
Where is she now ? Ah, she’s laid
In yonder cold and lonely bed!
Thus every thing in life we meet,
Is but the bitter and the sweet.
My fancy often spreads her wing,
And bears me to my native ground;
Again I hear the blackbird sing,
Again my playmates all are found,
AH eager to begin our play
On a sunshine holiday.


I seek again the simple flowers,
Companions of my childhood’s hours,
’Mid noisy brooks and fairy bowers;
The busy bee on guilded wing,
The honey bag and fearful sting
All pleasing memories bring.
The molehill is again to me
A wonder and a mystery,
Thou busy tenant of the day,
Why shun so much the eye of day ?
Art thou afraid to show thy skill
In building up this little hill ?
Or art thou like an artist poor,
Against whom fortune shuts the door,
And closed within in mean array,
He shuns the open light of day,
But hails with joy though drear and damp
And misty night and sickly lamp,
And, ’neath the flickering flaring light,
He conjures up his visions bright ?
Though houseled up in rustic stole,
The world at large is in his soul,
With ears to hear each mystic sound,
That thrills through nature’s voice profound,
The moaning winds, the rising storms
Of troubled air and giant forms,
The gleaming lightning flashing by,
That glares o’er earth, and sea, and sky,
Till in imagination strong,
He paints the scenes that move along.
Hark 1 the rolling thunders crash,
Hark! a lonely horseman splash;
Hark I the winds, and hark! the rains,
Wrestling at the window panes ;
Hark! the wailing of the woods,
Hark ! the roaring of the floods,
Hist! the demons of the night,
Careering in their wild delight!
Meanwhile he feels an impulse strong
To launch into the stream of song.
With many a freak of fancy free,
He plunges into ecstacy;
When mid his airy joy or pain,
He’ll snatch a golden hour again.


While thus he dreams, his native land
Comes up in many a landscape grand,
Where running streams in music play,
Around her castles grim and grey :
Each hoary tower and mouldering stone,
Tells him tales of ages gone,
Of warrior chiefs and ladies fair,
Who sighed upon the midnight air,
Undying love, so sweet a theme—
What pity ’tis so short a dream !
What greater bliss can angels know,
Than this our heaven here below ?
Our second bliss the genial friend,
As through this tangled world we wend —
No greater comfort e’er could be,
Than thou my friend hast been to me.
Though years and oceans roll between,
My memory holds thee fresh and green,
My gentle friend, I’ll ne’er forget,
That summer eve when first we met,
And how I told my simple lay,
To wile thy better harp to play,
Till every thing around us felt,
With sweeter grace in Twizel dell.
But ah! the truth is, I’m here,
Ear from my native home so dear;
Leave thy couch, and o’er the lawn,
Before the tinge of early dawn
Hath touched the morning wings with light,
And hear the lark begin his flight,
And drink his music till thou be
A chord in nature’s harmony.
Then the author of all good
Shall pour a soul into thy blood,
To bear thee up in future years,
To gild thy joys and soothe thy fears ;
When restless time hath lent a grace
In carvings round thy altered face,
Thy mind a mansion house shall be,
Full of glorious symmetry.


Where from the world thou may’st retire
Beside thy winter’s evening fire,
To linger in each charmed shade,
Which youth and rapture fondly made.
Thus when thy time draws near it’s close,
Thy mind shall find a sweet repose,
In all that light the muse has given,—
A light that leads from earth to heaven.
And when we’ve passed the boundary o’er
May we then meet to part no more,
And may we still bave power to see,
The scenes that are so dear to thee
The mystic moon, each sylvan cell
Where all thy sportive fairies dwell,
And gamble round each twinkling flower,
That grace thy own sweet native bower,
My fancy then would paint thee still
Entranced beside yon murmuring rill—
A wandering form, a musing sprite,
Bewitched by all the charms of night.
Amid those scenes so dear to thee
Muse again and think of me.
WILLIAN REAY.
AN EPISTLE TO GEO. E., A POETICAL
FRIEND, 1876.
1.
Another twelve months now have spent
Their pleasant winds and weather,
And left us in this world content
To travel yet together.
May this year’s blessing prove to thee
What none have done before,
And ought that might a sorrow be,
Ne’er fall beside thy door.
2.
This is a time of much good will,
When wishes fall in plenty,
’When poets fill the other gul,
Although their rash be scanty.
But wishes are such silly things
They seldom speak the giver,
Too oft a cheat, that only brings
Too close the mere deceiver.


3.
But there is that within my heart, —
I wish my rhymes could show it,
How much I love each lofty fgailpaftt
That stamps thee —noble poet.
And may’st thou still each coming year,
Soar higher still and higher,
Till, bursting on this hemisphere,
A blazing ball of fire.
4.
But how’s the jade this many a day ?
Has she been sick or thriving ?
Been giving birth to some sweet lay,
Or at some epic driving ?
Or has she been inclined to roam,
And nothing new recorded ?
Thy life, my friend, must be the poem
Before she e’er can ward it.
5.
The beauty of the summer field,
Must bring the poet pleasure;
And winter’s raging winds may yield
Him joys beyond all measure.
The homeless bird with cheerless wail,
May tune his soul to sadness;
The flow’rets blooming in the dale,
May woo him back to gladness.
6.
It is not what the poet has said, —
But what he has effected;
And when perchance he’s lying dead,
They’ll say he was neglected.
That cannot be—the sun and stars,
The moon and mighty ocean,
And music of the fairest firs
All join in his devotion,
7.
Perhaps this last old year has left
Thee marks of care and trouble,
And some darling hope bereft
Of fortune’s hazy bubble ?
But I would give thee this advice, —
Heed not her frowns nor favours,
Whil’st thou art held among’ st the wise,
Tout silly clish-ma-clavers.


8.
Our fairest moments and our joys,
Grim sorrow often jumbles,
And like a child’s bepainted toys
Are broken e’er he stumbles;
And those gilt fragments that are left
Of his beguiling treasure,
May only tell how soon bereft,
Man is of earthly pleasure,
9.
The dearest hope that man may build,
E’en o’er the lofty towering,
May prove a falcon cruelly killed,
Complaining as he’s lowering ;
Or as the hare that hails the sun,
With sport some summer morning,
May die before the day is done
In pain and anguish burning.
10.
Just now we’re blest if once we think
Of our bamboozled neighbours,
Where the dull Turk can smoke and wink,
At blood bespattered sabres.
But hold! I’ll end my rhyme on this!
For blood, and sword, and spear, •
Can never form a wreath of bliss,
To crown a coming year.
11. ,
As each swift year is rushing by,
We are getting old and older;
Time’s brushing wings may dim each eye,
By making hearts grow colder.
But let us guard that precious germ
That’s taking root between us,
And prize for aye each rosy charm,
That circles round our Jeanies.
12.
Howe’er the stormy winds of life
May drive our barques ahead,
Apart from party storms and strife,
Our Anchors should be weighed.
And as two faithful crafts are driven
With bending bow and mast,
God grant our compass point to heaven
To land us safe at last.
January, 1876.


FRAGMENTS OP A DREAM.
1.
I sat upon a rough hewn bay
By the deep sounding sea,
And heard the wild waves at their play
In rudest minstrelsy,
That swept o’er all my vanished years,
And woke my soul to life and tears.
2.
A dreamer I have always been,
A dreamer still must be;
For many a wondrous sight I’ve seen
In vacant reverie.
As conjuring fancies wove their spell,
My airy castles rose or fell.
3.
But there was one so vast, so fair,
Most glorious to behold,
Whose mighty towers were lost in air,—
’Twas based on burnished gold.
And on the front, in words of flame,
Was writ, —this is the house of fame.
4.
And many strove to gain that height,
Whereon that castle stood;
Warriors bold in arms of might,
Plunged on through fields of blood ;
And many a fearful tale might state,
How each one gained that castle gate.
5.
I saw them trample ’neath their feet
The dying and the dead;
Till mercy’s soul—a soul so sweet —
Like other souls had fled.
And mirth, and dance, and revelry
Proclaimed them fame and victory.
6.
But strange, I thought, that there should be
like flow’rets by the way,
The fairest forms in life to see,
As beautiful as day,
like sunbeams dancing in the sun,
Cry out with joy, “ They come, they come!”


7.
Ah! beauty ne’er was made for this
Vain pageantry and show;
Its proper sphere are scenes of bliss,
Or by the couch of woe;
The trembling lip, the glistening tear,
Are holiest by the warrior’s bier.
8.
And thus poor hearts are tempest-tossed
On life’s most stormy wave,
Till every hope and joy is lost,
To moulder in the grave.
But all this pride—this pomp of kings—
Shall fade away like meaner things.
9.
How joyfully they danced within
The brilliant castle wall;
While bursts of praise, a mighty din,
Bang through each airy hall.
But 0, my soul did ache to see
Them joy in such a revelry!
10.
Such costly pomp, such vast array,
To guild tiie festive hour,
Forgetful of the tears that lay,
Beneath their pomp and power.
The shattered hearts, the scattered bones,
On which the tyrants build their thrones.
11.
And right in front the glittering throne,
A servile group did stand:
The simple Poet had brought his poem,
The Conjurer his wand,
The Artist—childish fool—now tried
To flatter wealth, and power, and pride.
12.
Away thought I, I’ll none of this,
Give me some quiet bower;
Life’s harmless joys, and homely bliss;
Unconscious of the hour,
That brings regret, remorse, and shame,
To stain at last my simple name.


SECOND PAST.
1.
The hushed up day, the calm of night,
And balmy breathing mom,
Brought fairer scenes before my sight;—
Broad fields of waving com,
And beauteous clouds did slumbering lie,
Upon the bright etherial sty,—
2.
Such as the genial* Morland drew,
When in his happiest hours,
E’er yet the precious pearl he threw
To dart malignant powers;
But yet I saw his dewy name,
Was printed in the house of fame.
3.
Or gentle Wilson, f pensive soul,
Calm as the dewy eve,
Or glowing, morning, as it stole
O’er scenes thou could’st not leave;
Had’st thou but found a scene so fine,
It’s glories would have all been thine
4.
Glad joy was in the tuneful bowers,
Young lambs played on the green,
Tea, all that fills life’s happiest hours
Were fairest to be seen;
yhe milkmaid by her milking pail,
Listened the loitering shepherd’s tale;
5.
A linnet chanted in the bush,
The lark was in the sky ;
A little streamlet’s murmuring rush
Filled up the melody; ■
And all things felt the joyous mood,
Of singing birds and crystal flood.
•George Morland, one of the earliest of English Landscape Painters.
Many stories have been told ef his lore of roadside inns, his love of ale
and the social hour; his ways of getting into debt, and hivnode of get*
ting out of it. See his life.
♦Richard Wilson, also one of the early English Landscape Painters
obisfly celebrated for his fine morning and evening scenes.


6.
The reapers too, I saw, begin
To cut the yellow grain,
Methought it would have been a sin
To miss their simple strain;
They sang of birds, and brooks, and flowers,
Of shady groves and happy hours.
7.
Could I but paint this bonnie lass,
Could I describe the dewy lawn,
My language would then far surpass
All that was ever writ by man;
She was the sweetest country maid,
That ever graced the rural shade.
8.
With all the hues of light composed,
The sunlight glinted on her cheek,
And many a rosy tint disclosed.
Would need a gifted tongue to speak.
The gift of joy the power of song,
To this sweet maiden did belong.
9.
I saw a poet pass the while,
Who eyed the happy pair,
Saying with rapture and a smile,
Was ever scene so fair.
“ This bonnie country lass,” said he,
“ Shall ring in Scottish melody.”
10.
With manly steps, and eyes of fire,
The ploughman strode along;
Who tuned his everlasting lyre
In accents wild and strong.
My bosom heaved with joy to see
A poet in such ectaoy.


11.
He sang the maiden’s artless smile,
The lover’s raptured joy,
And soothed the weary sons of toil
With/hope beyond the sky;
Whil’st old and young around him clung,
To catch the music of his tongue.
12.
“ 0 happy love!” the poet cried,
“ How sweet is this sequestered scene!
How many guilded things have died,
And never felt such bliss, I ween,
As here we feel; while purples fade
Around the courts of costly state.”
13.
“Away, vain pomp, we would not share
The weight of fashion’s wild domain,
Nor in golden bondage bear
The titles some would seek to gain.
We love to wander where we please,
’Mong sunshine and the forest trees.”
14.
“ Ambition! take thy dazling crown!
Bank, wealth, nor power, we heed them not.
When day is done, on beds of down,
There’s rest within our humbe cot.
The peaceful hours we dream away,
Till wakened by the new-born day.”
15.
Thus sang the poet in many a strain
The pleasures of his native vale;
I thought he was the grandest swain
That ever breathed the Magic strain.
But little can my skill convey
The beauty of his pleasing lay.


POOR LITTLE WILLIE.
Poor little Willie was the only sou of Edward Dixon of
Greta. I felt it a compliment to be requested by him to com-
pose a few lines on the death of his child.—W. R.
Poor little Willie!
Fate has stolen thee away ;
And thrown a shadow and a cloud
O’er my brightest day.
A shadow and a weeping cloud
Hang upon my heart,
Brooding over bitterness
That never can depart.
Poor little Willie!
At times 1 think I see
Thee still around our fireside,
Near thy mother’s knee.
But'ah'! the ache, the anguish,
To know thou can’st not be
Again around our simple hearth,
Nor near thy mother’s knee.
Poor little Willie!
What hopes I had for thee;
Castles built up in the air,
And ships upon the sea.
I crowned thee King and Emperor,—
For they were all thy own,
But all those things have passed away;
i\ly heart is now a stone.


Poor little Willie!
This life is hard to bear,
When I think on thy bonnie face
And sunny silken hair.
To miss thee in the morning,
To feel the awful gloom ;
The aching void and emptiness
Around our little room.
Poor little Willie !
All my joy has fled ;
I cannot sit around my hearth,
Nor rest within my bed.
T wander like a shattered bark
Upon a restless sea;
Living only in the past
That I have spent with thee.
Poor little Willie!
When no one else is seen,
I seek to find each little place
Where thou and I have been.
And like a miser of the past
Each look and word I crave,
Which tells my heart is mouldering close
Beside thee in the grave.
Poor little Willie!
The world may think me deaf,
I cannot listen tp their tales
Who wish to bring relief.
Far dearer is my load of woe
Than all their gusts of joy ;
Oh! precious, precious, is the grief
I fondle for my boy.
WILLIAM REAY.


A MEETING.
The meeting took place at Hamilton in the year 1878
We arranged to spend the evening over a social glass, and to
talk at will of poetry.
1
Andrew Boa was a foil man, an eloquent lecturer, a genia
friend and a poet; he had spent his best energies for the good of
his kind in his native land, Scotland; he died the year after
at about 35 years of age, and in foreign ground lies without a
stone to mark the spot. He was formerly of Glascow, and
latterly Government Clerk of Works of Newcastle, N.S.W.
Threatened with consumption, Mr. Boa, upon the advice of
of medical gentlemen, left Glasgow in the nope of restoring
his health in the milder climate of the antipodes, and being
furnished with credentials from Members of Parliament and
the principal Trades Societies of Glasgow, he soon obtained
a responsible position, and bade fare to acquire that influence
amongst the working classes in the Australian Colonies which
he enjoyed in a pre-eminent degree in Scotland. We all
agreed to write something on the occasion of our meeting, but
so far as I am aware, nothing was written by either Mr. Boa
or Mr. Robertson. Three or four days afterwards I read my
poem to Mr .Boa, whosaid, “Capital,'capital,” at the conclusion
of each stanza.
. George (George Robertson) a dear friend for 23 years,
died lastyear, and leaves to me a blank which can never be
filled. He was a pure worshipper of the intellectual, lofty in
his imagination, his descriptive powers beyond all measure-
ment. In every paragraph of his poetry is found a daring and
beautiful image. He was far read in history ; his efforts as
a poet remind me of Scott and Byron. His poetry abounds
in tenderness and glorious description ; but little passion, and
no humour, which render them perhaps less attractive to the
general reader than they perhaps deserve.]
That night he told us of a design of a new poem he had
sketched out, which was to be a grand satire on the weaknesses
and follies of the poor wayfarers of this poor bewildered earth.
He was to soar to the planet Venus, solicit the aid of the fairest
Godess of that orb to accompany him in a similar manner as
Vergil did Dante through the infernal regions. He used to say
“Ah, Will, it was not fair for you to send me beyond the moon.’ ’
1.
The sun had wandered to the west,
Like some one weary, wanting rest,
And sank in rosy folds, caressed
In golden slumbers.
And little birds stole to their nest
In tuneless numbers.


2.
When Andrew, George and painter Will
Had met to have a social gill,
And there they sat and drank until
The moon was sinking,
At 2 a. m. o’er Cameron’s hill,
And left them blinking.
3.
And as the glass went round and round,
The wit grew bright and sense grew sound,
Until three sages sat profound
As Holy Scripture;
And in each head there might be found
More pith and rapture.
4.
Now like three sons who loved and toiled,
The genial muses o’er them smiled
To see their simple hearts beguiled
By hopes that stray,
While soaring fancies, passions wild,
Held boundless sway.
6.
Poor Willie wandered to the past;
A waning leaf on Autumn’s blast,
And many an anxious eye he cast
Around the glasses,
Till lifting one, he drank at last
To bonnie lasses!
6.
Brave Andrew spoke of coming times,
In the most facinating rhymes,
When there would be less cause for crimes
Of blood and slaughter,
Till fancy heard the marriage chimes,
Of freedom’s daughter.


7.
He also sang co-operation
Shall -win the poor man yet salvation,
And make his lowly habitation
A joyful home;
While George took flight beyond creation,
To write a poem.
8.
And as he spread his wings afar,
Aronnd the moon and past each star,
No comet crossed his path to mar
His upward speed,
Till forth rushed Sol in blazing car
And fiery steed.
9.
Who cried “Hash man, how darest thou climb
So far beyond the bounds of time,
To seek a subject for thy rhyme
In language free,
And in a golden theme sublime
To rival me ?
10.
“ For I alone am sovereign here,
And hold in sway each wandering sphere,
Which roll around from year to year
In constant motion;
And thy own earth with smiles I cheer,
And tumbling ocean.”
11.
With this the jealous god grew vain,
And snatched each fiery champion’s rein,
Then dashed away in golden wain,
With rolling thunder;
But Yenus heard the Poet’s strain,
In pleasing wonder.


12.
“ Sing on, sweet Bard,” the godess said,
“ Of gods nor men be thou afraid,
And I will lend to thee such aid
To poets given,
To woo thy own sweet radiant maid —
The gift of heaven.
13.
“I hail thee now to this far height,
Whence long I’ve watched thy upward flight,
Thy pinions spread in daring might
And upward gaze;
The gods themselves shall now unite
To sing thy praise.
14.
“ Sing on, sweet hard, I’m glad to share
Thy rapture and thy lofty air; •
And when I’m worthy of thy care,
I’ll ne’er refuse
To lend my aid, for few can hear
The lofty muse.
15.
“ Thou hast a friend, who lonely strays
Through humble Nature’s winding ways;
A hermit clad in evening greys,
Obscure his path,
Where yet, perchance, some gleam repays
His simple faith.
16.
“ He lingers on the moors and fells,
O’er bushy ferns and pensive bells,
Whose odour sweet to fancy tells
Where fairies lie.
Who woke within his breast those spells
Which cannot die.


17.
“He loves the sounds of winds and woods,
The winter’s blast, the roaring floods,
The thunder’s crash—that bursting thuds
From Pole to Pole; —
These are the themes o’er which he broods,
With pensive soul.
18.
“ But who can soar in shaded bowers,
In dusky glens and gloaming hours,
Or when the star of fortune lowers .
And winter howls,
Or when his lagging moon but glowers
On bats and owls ?
19.
“For now his brightest days are spent
In blighted hopes and banishment,
And wrinkled clouds of discontent
Sit on his brow,
And many a charm the muses lent
Are fading now.
20.
“But thou art in thy golden prime,—
A gift that comes but once in time.
Come strike thy harp—a lofty chime
Strike fearlessly,
And I will list thy strain sublime
In fancy free.
21.
“ Now take the gift the gods do give
To poets who sing and men who live; —
No greater blessing canst thou leave
To coming times,
Than that it is our power to weave
In golden rhymes.”


WILL AND JOCK
TWA AULD SCOTCHMEN AT THE WALLSEND
GATHERIN G,1875.
"Willie.
Ha, Jock, I’m glad to meet you here.
Hoo’s all at hame ? your children dear
And the auld wife, if ane ma speir,
• Man, hoo is Nannie ?
We have nae met this seven year.
Jock.
Is it so many ?
Will.
Indeed ’tie, Jock; it makes me sigh
To see how time’s gaun rushing by
With quickening strides, to dim each eye
And change the hair.
It makes me aft maist like to cry
' At kirk or fair.
For there we’ll aft to speak the Truth,
Meet some auld friend we ken’d in youth,
With wrinkled brow that ance was smooth
And bright and cheery
With tottering gait and form uncrouch,
Despised and weary.
Jock.
Toots, toots, mon Will, we’ve had our day,
Though wrinkled now, and bald and grey;
Let’s gang and hear the music play;
Qrieving’s a folly.
We did not come to weep and pray
In melancholy.
But stop, we’ll hae a wee drap mair,
It mends the wheels when creaking sair,
And blinds the e’en of Daddy Care,
That ill-famed carle.
I wish that I had power to skair
Him frae the worle.


It makes my poor auld heart leap glad
To see our ancient Scottish plaid
Thrown round the cheerful Highland lad
In colors fine.
My blood is up and dancing mad
For auld lang syne.
Just list the merry piper loons!
God bless their hearts, God bless their croons,
Long may they live to play those tunes'
With philibeg,
And gilted buttons on their shoons
And tartaned leg!
Will.
This music sends my heart away
O’er many misty mountains grey,
And threads those paths I loved to stray
In other years;
And though thy heart be light and gay,
Mine melts to tears.
Jock.
Now while they make their chanters squeell
To hornpipes or a threesome reel,
And young anes dance with toe and heel
In capers frisky,
Just l?t dull care gang to the de’il,
We’ll tak our whisky.
And with the heart-inspiring cup
That Mils dull care and kindles hope,
We’ll drink to Scotland’s thistle tap
For times gone by,
And her auld mountains towering up
To heaven on high.
When I was young, ohon, at hame,
Some things perhaps we should not name,
My youthful blood was all in flame
For Scotland’s honour,
Where none could farther throw the stane
Or muckle hammer.


My shoulders then were firm and broad,
My very footsteps where I trode
Did make the green earth feel its load
Of pith and power,
Though now we’re on the downward road
At gloaming hour.
Tou see yon lasses dressed sae braw!
I like them, Will, I love them a’
And he sae dull who cannot craw
About their beauty;
He does not knaw, I’ll plainly shaw,
What is his duty.
They are the croons of all our joys,
A soothing chord amidst the noise
Of worldly strive, that oft destroys
The poor man’s pleasure,
I like them better than the boys,
They’re aye a treasure.
Haw’s Nannie, said ye Will ? That name
Wakes in my heart, that tender flame
Which never dies. This poor old frame
May altered be,
But she, land lass, has just the same
Sweet ways to me.
Losh me! if yon’s no *Johnnie Thampson,
The real one, see hoo he’s dancing,
And in auld Scotland’s pride he’s prancing
With subtle knees,
And with his leering look is glancing
On all he sees.
And there comes gash gab blethering fWillie;
Although his road through life's been hilly,
He capers like an unbroke filly
For pith and wind,
And puts the lave, the truth I tell you,
Far far behind.
*A well known and much respected indentity for many
years at Wallsend
tWillie Smith for many years a distinct character at all
the Social Gatherings for his loud manner in talking
and his cleverness as a hornpipe dancer. (Both now
dead.)


See hoo he leaps with cap in hand,
His limbs move like the willow wand;
The gathering crowd all gaping stand
With admiration,
And the loud praise he does command,
Beats all creation.
Hear how they clap their hands and shout,
As each gay turn he wheels about;
The pipers loud and louder toot,
Him to inspire;
They ken his graceful swing of foot.
They cannot tire.
And yonder’s Tam and Peter Young;
You’ve heard the songs they’ve often sung,
When Peter in his freaks has Hang
The queer cork leg,
Or hoo poor simple Wat sair dang
Did conquer Meg.
Losh, losh, if yon’s no auld Peacock!
Come here amang ns decent folk,
An auld kent face of some queer stock
He is nae doot;
A queer old chap is queer auld Jock
For gaun aboot.
And Jemmy Fletcher* too is here,
A worthy man, oor present mayor,
With heart sae true and face more fair
We canna see;
Lang may he live to breathe oor air,
And speak sae free.
He is sae open nane can doot him,
Though muckle things are said aboot him,
And some vile wretches e’en wad doot him,
To ease their spite,
Or with some blunderbuss would shoot him
Some winter night.
•Now the Honorable the Minister for Mines


Some cannot bear this man amang them,
Although they knaw he would not wrang them ;
No scorpion he that ever stang them
To wild distraction;
Yet in some foolish freak they’d whang him
For satisfaction.
Put to the test they like him yet.
A better man they could not get;
A cheerful man about the pit,
A pleasant master;
If there’s a sore o’er which they fret,
He finds a plaster.
Enough! And there is Mister Birrell,
A straight, upright, bright cherry carle,
Wha’s had some battles with the warle,
Ye ken yoursel’ ;
Yet some there are who’d like to hurl
Him off to hell.
Away with all this crooked spite,
Its noo the way to put things right;
Yet some there are who take delight,
In bitter wrangles,
And many a poor man’s happy night
Their effort strangles.
Will.
Look now each dance and race is ower,
And the hot sun begins to lower,
And reeling in his western tour,
Glares e’er ho fall; ,
And silence, from her sacred bower
Steals over all.
Guid night, auld friend, light-hearted Jock,
Thou art the king of cheery folk;
May thy auld wife ne’er want a smock,
Nor thee the nappy.
Although thou wear’st a grizzly lock,
Thy heart’s still happy.
W.R.
Hamilton, April 15, 1879.


TO A MOTHERLESS FOAL.
Note.—The motherless foal is no fancy sketch, hnt taken from
life. I met the little waif early one morning on the Waratah
common, and was struck with its appearance—largo head, thin
neck, long hair falling off in patches, unshapely hoofs, huge
belly and high hones—indeed eveiy thing that denoted poverty
and neglect. I learned that it belonged to a man the name of
Cropper, who was residing on the Lambton Common. The
mare, its mother, had fallen into one of those pitfalls abound-
ing there and perished; and thus the '■ guileless ooof ” was left
too early to provide for itself. After the appearance of my
poem the subject became an identity, and was ever after known
as the Motherless Foal.—W.R.
Poor ragged colt, I grieve to see
Thee wandering here in misery,
In search of what’s denied to thee—
An humble shed.
Not e’en a single bush or tree,
To shield thy head.
Far from the world thou roam’st aloof,
Thou little simple, guileless coof,
Thy withered hide and crumpled hoof,
And scrimped form,
Proclaims thee here a pilgrim proof
Gainst many a storm.
Hast thou ne’er known a mother’s care,
To sooth thy heart and smooth thy hair,
And lead thee to some better fare
Than this ?—I see,
Through thy long coat, thy young bones stare
At poverty.
Thou dost not grumble nor complain
At blustering winds and pelting rain;
Though all the elements may strain
Their vengeful force,
Thou merely shak’st thy uncombed mane,
Thou tiny horse.
Had I e’er felt what thou hast borne
Tn all this wilderness forlorn,
With all that fortitude unshorn,
From plaint as free,
I then, in sympathy, might turn
To pity thee.


Man oft is cruel to his horse,
"When he has spent his useful force;
He’ll turn him off without remorse,
With kicks and goads,
To let him pick the herbage coarse,
About the roads.
But thou shalt never know from me
Such low, unmanly cruelty;
If thou wilt come and learn to be
Useful in serving,
The best of fare shall be for thee,
Instead of starving.
But if poet-like, thou art inclined
To loiter poor and far behind,
With fond pretence that thou can’st find,
On some lone hill,
A pleasure in the midnight wind,
When cold and chill.
Or like the hungry wolf, who strayed,
When night had drawn her sable shade,
Whom the sleek dog did near persuade,
In ancient fable,
This grisly loun to share his bed
And food and stable.
But as they neared the master’s park,
Although the night was dour and dark,
The wary wolf noted a mark
He did not like,
When with a sneer and snarling bark,
He leaped the dyke.
I almost think I hear thee say,
“Be off, fond man, go on thy way;
This is my life—this is my way,
I want no pity,
And if with fashion’s fools you play.
Play in the city.”


Where other brutes may strive and chase,
And run life’s wild and eager race,
And turn to every point their face,
To fashions wild;
This is my own, my native place;
I’m Nature’s child.
I’m here beyond the world’s reach,
All thy philosophy can teach
With fine set words and forms of speech,
In style resplendent;
Without a collar, curb, or breech,
I’m independent.
Well, well, fond thing, I musing said;
No purer life than thine is led,
If here should be thy hindmost bed,
How wild and free,
The winds shall sing around thy head,
An elegy.
ELEGY ON SADLER.
A goat who was found dead on a heap of stones. He was
well known here for many years. He had many merits,
and one fault—namely, thieving—to which necessity
drove him.
Poor old Sadler, since thou art laid
A breathless form amongst the dead,
I’d like to say what should be said
In truth to thee;
For many a false account’s been made
’Gainst yon and me.
•
Thy heavy coat was coarse and rough,
And thy lean sides were hard and tough,
And well they might, for many a cuff
They had to bear;
And yet you never took the huff,
Nor shed a tear.


But with a patience in thy face,
That represented well thy race,
And but for some things no disgrace
To all thy kind;
And for thy speed, beyond all praise,
Fleet as the wind.
You never made a great pretence
To social laws or common sense ;
And when you broke our neighbour’s fence,
To get a feed, -
I always spoke in thy defence—
It was thy need.
That day you stole in Jones’ house
You step’d as lightly as a mouse,
And took a loaf you thought.no use;
They still abused thee.
You heeded not their vile abuse,
And I excused thee.
My wife, too, held thee sore in hate,
It makes me laugh yet to relate,
How you could leap our garden gate,
And burst right in;
You broke my wife’s choice china plate —
Thy greatest sin.
But all thy follies to rehearse,
Would swell my rhyme to many a verse,
And make thy memory still look worse.
Enough’s been said;
For well I know there’s many a curse
Upon thy head.
But when thy head or heart they blasted,
They little knew how long you’d fasted ;
Perhaps for days and nights ne’er tasted
A bit of food.
What they too oft in plenty wasted
Would done thee good.
Without a home, bleak hills thy bed,
When winter’s rains and winds have sped,
For days and nights upon thy head,
You never grumbled,
But those poor empty sides ill fed
Have ached and rumbled.


To picture thee with half-shut eyes,
Beneath cold winter’s angry skies,
Shivering up to half thy size,
Wet through thy coat,
With no kind friend to sympathise,—
Poor simple goat!
And here upon this heap of stones,
Thou’st come to lay those poor old bones,
With none to soothe thy dying groans
And parting breath,
Not e’en thy friend, our neighbour Jones; —
Alone at death!
Should some one raise a stone to thee,
In kindness to thy memory,
I’ll do my best, whate’er it be,
In honest faith,
To make some show of sympathy,
Thy epitaph!
You had a fault—there’s none may doubt it—
And who has ever lived without it ?
And when thy life was lame or crooked
By passions blindly,
Another’s fault you never mooted
In words unkindly.
ELEGY ON JENNY HERRING.
AN OLD NEIGHBOUR.
She lived alone, a widow, and became morbid and miserly-
over small coal and manure, so much so, that she could
Out-weary the longest day in summer, or the coldest day
in winter, so that her heaps might increase in size. Her
great pleasure was to show them as monuments of her
industry. She seldom had a fire, and her garden was but
sparingly supplied.—W. R.
1.
I wandered out the other night,
When all folks else were grasped tight
Within the arms of sleep, and bright
The moon shone here,
When some thing rushed before my sight—
Strange, wild, and queer


2.
’Twas near the feet of two old trees,
Where oft I list to the nightly breeze,
For it’s sad wail can often please
My fancy best,
When this strange thing came like a bleeze,-
Quick, whistling, past.
3.
Good gracious me! what can this mean,
I cried, and opened wide my een,
Am I asleep? and do I dream
About this clatter,
Or is it but a stray sunbeam, —
A moonshine matter ?
4.
But when the gloom-clad morning came,
He wanted more than half his flame,
For sad the tale he must proclaim
’Twas Jenny’s death—
-And this strange thing I could not name
Had been her wraith!
5.
Now might I wear the mourning weed,
It is sad news, sad news indeed,
Sad news,! sad news, an ill news feed!
And end any trouble!
I never more can lift my head
But run half double !
6.
Half double run, and weep and wail,
And tell the saddest mournful tale
That e’er from human lips yet fell
With sobbing breath.
Nought could this poor lone heart assail
Like Jenny’s death.
7.
0 weary fell that woeful day,
That stole poor Jenny’s breath away,
And laid her down both old and grey,
Flat in the tomb !
But though she moulder and decay
Her fame shall bloom!


8.
Now let me wander where I will,
My bursting heart must cry it’s fill,
Each eye shall be a running rill
For poor old Jenny!
0 spiteful death thou ne’er did’st hill
One half so bonnie!
9.
Her hair was grey, but once ’twas gold,
Her eyes were blue, though now so cold,
She once was young, though now so old!
0 vain regret,
To think that one so bright, so bold,
Should leave us yet!
10.
Now nature seems all changed to me,
The sky, the clouds, the waving tree,
The silent glen, the flowery lea
The scented mead,
The roaring of the awful sea
Tells Jenny’s dead!
11.
Oh what is life ? when that is gone,
On which affection doats upon,
The tearless eye, the aching moan,
The blighted heart,
The broken form that walks alone,
The world apart.—
12.
White roses in her garden grew,
And weeping pansies soft and blue;
Those flowers her poor old hands would pue
To deck my breast, —
No wonder that you see me now
So much distressed!
13.
The roses now all droop and pine,
The fox-glove, and the eglintine,
That looked around in clusters fine
Are lowly laid,
And all in silent grief combine
Because she’s dead!


14
0 cruel death, with cruel will !
0 cruel death, with cursed skill!
"Why did you thus poor Jemmy kill,
And break my heart!
Is it for good, is it for ill,
That we should part!
15
Oft have I seen her bend her way,
Before the tinge of early day
Had touched night’s mantle damp and grey,
• With golden light;
But now she sleeps among the clay,
A sorry sight!
16
Among the grass and dewy weet,
The larks would startle near her feet,
And there begin their warhlings sweet,
Both east and west;
But this to Jenny was no treat,
Manure was best!
17
And just as late upon the green,
I’ve seen her look with straining een,
When if a horse or cow was seen,
She cared not whether;
Both old and young, or fat, or lean,
Their dung she’d gather!
18
But I might wear the mind away,
To count' her virtues day by day,
She did slip once, I’ve heard them say,
Behind the door;
She mended this when she did pray,
like many more.
19
1 would not here have mentioned this,
Nor hinted at a stolen kiss,
But fearing she might take’d amiss,
She loved the truth;
And felt no doubt the tempting bliss,
Of ardent youth.


20
The world may talk, the world my rave,
The world her precious heaps may crave,
And poke their tongues into her grave
To find a stain;
But I shall try those heaps to save
From wind and rain.
21
Hail weeping drivers, stop your dray,
Come join my grief, ye once were gay,
And all ye little donkeys bray,
For her that’s been
So kind to keep you every day
So sweet and dean.
22
Mourn all ye winds that wander by,
Mourn gloomy clouds along the sky,
Ye all may weary a watery eye
With dropping rain;
Yea, nature’s self may sit and cry
For poor old Jane!
23
Come, join ye naked winter woods,
Come join my wail ye swelling floods,
Come join ye bursting storms that thuds
Along the sky;
Come spring with all thy opening buds,
Come join the cry !
24
Mourn all ye little winking flowers,
And keep enclosed your scented showers ;
Mourn mossy glens, and dreamy bowers.
And Solitude,
Which charms so much the poet’s hours,
■ln pensive mood!
25
Tho poet himself no more can sing
His muse, a poor bewildered thing
Has left him, and has spread her wing
For other lands;
His harp is broke, and every string
Loose in his hands.


EPISTLE TO ROBERT REAT. 1874.
Dear Cousin, Hob, I fain would write
To thee some pleasing rhyme to-night.
If but the muses would alight
Upon my pen;
I’d take a ramble and a flight
Where none may ken.
n.
Perhaps you’ll think’t too late a day
For me to rhyme my time away,
And with the freaks of fancy play
At midnight hour,
And seek again that heavenly ray,—
That heavenly power !
m.
That rushing warmth around the heart
Which bids the tear of rapture start, —
Within the mine, or in the mart,
Where’er I be,
This is my theme, —this is my chart,
Eternally.
IV.
What worth is life ?—not worth our care
If but to plot, and scheme, and snare,
For wealth alone.in gold to share,
What is it worth ?
The poor blind mole shall make his lair
As rich in earth.
V
Yet, heed me here: despise not wealth,
If it comes well it is not pelf,—
It keeps men cheerful, warm in health,
Close, snug, and canny.
I ken you ken right well yourself
It makes things bonnie.
VI.
It keeps the head and heart erect, —
Howe’er ’tis gained it wins respect.
Be e’er so base they’ll ne’er supect
Aught ill again ye,—
The blackest crimes they won’t detect—•
Should ye have money.


yn.
I’m struggling now, I feel it queer,
To make both rhyme and reason here.
With such like stuff I fear, I fear,
I’m little suited.
With health, with peace, and friendly cheer
We’re well without it.
YHI.
Give me a heart with power to sing,
Above this worldly grovelling;
May brighter visions round me ding
Till my last day,
When this poor soul shall take its wing
Beyond the clay.
IX
Give me a heart with power to feel
For others woe, for others weal,
With purpose bright as pointed steel
My push shall be
Around the warm heart and the real,
In social glee.
X.
If there’s a debt in life I owe,
It is the gift of one to know
Who feels the sympathetic glow,
The tender part;
And bathe within the crimson flow,
Around the heart.
XI
Cool, grim reserve, I like thee least;
Thy form is like a dawnless eakt,
No cheering ray to man or beast;
No happy thing
Can ever dwell within thy breast,
Thou poisonous sting.


XII.
I shrivel up when I behold
Thy darksome form, thou gloomy mould;
Thou winter wind that blows so cold,
Thou dim dyed shade
Away! and in some desert fold
Thy cursed head.
XIII
I rather grieve to hear thee say
Thine eyes are dim, thy hair is gray;
But time has run so fast away
Since last we met;
But still I feel that genial ray
Plays round thee yet.
XIY.
Ah! youthful time, thou comest no more
To gild our pleasant landscapes o’er;
The torrents’ rush, the oceans’ roar
Are changing now,
le, with fingers hoar,
Creeps o’er each brow
XV.
Doest thou yet mind yon ancient pile,*
And Wandsbeckt in her springtide smile,
Where oft we wandered many a mile
In days of yore,
Our youthful fancies to beguile
In beauty’s store.
•Bothell Castle.
tWandsheck, a river which runs past Bothell Castle.


XVI.
I still can see yon branches wave,
I still can bear tbe faintest lave,
The quiet Wandsbeck ever gave
At evening, when
The blackbird sent his echoing stave
From glen to glen.
XVII.
’Twas not the blackbird in the bush,
’Twas not the water’s quiet rush,
’Twas not the sunset’s evening flush,
When day was lost.
It was thy open hearted wish
That pleased me most,
xvm.
It was that honest, open pride,
You felt when I was by thy side;
No secret wishhad’st thou to hide,
No selfish aim.
Thy wish was, then, to be my guide
To paths of fame.
XIX.
My wife and bairnies all are well,
And I am unco stout mysel,—
A pleasing truth, no doubt, to tell
’Tween you and me.
But there’s a voice comes like a knell
Across the sea.


XX.
Should I ere climb those hills again,
That beckon me across the main,
On my lone harp I’d wake a strain
For other times.
But disappointment’s cureless pain
Spoils all my rhymes.
XXI.
Away! away! I will not fret,
Nor lose myself in vain regret;
My Jenny’s eyes are sparkling yet,
Sad harp awake,
Where all those tenderest notes are set
For Jenny’s sake.
XXII.
Come pour thy softest words of song
Like evening balm, when day is gone
To slumber in a world unknown,
Soft music speak—
Till all the tide of feelings strong
Gleam on the cheek.
XXIII.
Who bends before that throne of bliss, —
The raptured sigh, the faithful kiss, —
May never count his joys amiss,
Though ere so poor—
The sweetest joys of life are his
The world o’er.


XXIV.
Yet should I ever plant my feet
Once more upon that land, how sweet'
Each long-lost friend again to meet
No more to roam,
And with the fondest feelings greet
My native home.
XXV.
Yes, here I am, still that way bent, —
Though woeful lines I never meant,
Nor with a whining discontent
To spoil my lay.
Yet let me curse the cause that sent
Me far away.
XXVI.
In youth I loved my native bowers,
The mouldering walls of ancient towers, —
The seats of heroes, and the flowers
Of war and song,—
Till charmed shades of ancient hours
Would round me throng.
xxvn.
There in my dreams, I saw the field
Of battle sway with sword and shield,
And the grim warriors stern and steeled
From top to toe,
Still plunging on in blood deep heeled
Dark foe to foe.
xxvm.
But the aged minstrels came so nigh,
I felt them breathe, I heard them sigh.
When to the touch of harmony
They tuned their lyre
I felt the birth of ecstacy,—
The living fire.


XXIX
And still it glows within my breast,
The purest feeling and the best.
The dawning east, the glowing west,
The babbling rill,
When wandering far or laid at rest
Are with me still
XXX
Now, fare-thee-well, my dearest friend, —
May smiling fortune o’er thee bend,
And golden favours yet extend
With hand more free,
Whil’st I shall hope some day to spend
An hour with thee.
TO ANDREW BRITTON.
In memory of a pleasant evening spent at the Royal Hotel,
'Wallsend, over a social glass and a song, 1882.
Dear Andrew, how are you the now ?
Is care still keeping frae your brow ?
And music flowing frae your mou ?
Man, yon was fine.
I’m fidgen yet, when I think how
You tuned each line.
Those bonnie words, “Theauld Scotch sang,
You touched in music soft and strang,
They thrilled me as you breathed alang
The tender story.
May ne’er a dischord do thee wrang
Till auld and hoary.
And when auld time draws near thy side,
To chill thy blood and cool thy pride,
May sweetest numbers still abide
Around thy heart.
When to the other world you glide
They’ll ne’er depart.


EPISTLE TO JOSEPH SKITPSET.
1
’Tis three and twenty summers past
Since you and I apart were cast
To fight the cold world’s hitter blast,
As some folk call it;
But let’s be cheerful till the last,
Whate’er befall it.
2
I know this world has many a jar,
As rugged as the flinty scaur
Which drives the poets raptures far
Beyond his guiding;
And yet the heart that knows no war
Has little biding.
3
It needs but little wit to know it:
This is no land for musing poet:
The cricket ball, the people show it
' To be their glory;
Or how some boatsman’s skill, “ be blow it,”
Fills all their story.
Yet what’s the good of whining, wailing,
Or gathering evils for retailing !
Our vessel’s whole! let her keep sailing!
All weathers past!
We’ll find some worthy pilot hailing
Us safe at last.
5
Here we are still; then let us know
There’s pleasure in all winds that blow
O’er summer hills, or winter snow,
By night, by day;
And glory in the western glow
Stealing' away.


6
And in the silent hours of night,
When moon and stars are shining bright,
With whom our souls in raptured flight,
Loves oft to roam:
Seeking amid their sacred light
A lasting home.
7
And golden mom with glittering train,
When Phoebus wakes to light again—
The nibbling flocks, the whistling swain,
The woodman strong,
And reapers, mong the golden grain
Chanting their song.
8
A heart-felt song, high up ascending,
A charm unto the landscape lending,
And birds in joyous mirth contending
Among the trees;
While Autumn tints harmonious blending
Wave in the breeze.
9
Through such fair visions would I stray,
Till wandering by the Wier’s green way,
Where thy fine harp was wont to play,
Beneath those walls,
Whose towering heights like giants grey,
Old time recalls.
10
To hear thy tales of ancient times,
Of holy men, and kingly crimes,
The while the grand Cathedral* chimes,
Would pour their song,
Like poet’s flights in loftiest rhymes,
Bloating along.
ll
There many a theme did once engage
Thy thoughts upon that antique page,
Where holy men, and bearded sage
Their legends pour,
A city full of hoary age—
Grim ancient lore.
"Durham Cathedral, County Durham.


12
But yet amid that busy throng
Of ancient saints in shadows long,
Or heroes moved by passions strong
In bye gone times :
The sweetest theme should be thy song
In graphic rhymes.
13.
Such quiet joys I’d seek with thee,
That’s found by lonely lake and lea,
Where spells that fall from tower and tree
And flowerets fine,
Might swell thy songs so dear to me
To many a line.
14.
Two pilgrims still; we’d cross the Tyne,
Past wooded glens and castles fine,
To see the Wandsbeck waters shine—
Sweet be their flow !
As dear to this fond heart of mine,
Long years ago.
15
Dear cousin Bob and Ephraim too,
Whose simple hearts were kind and true,
Oft.wandered with us through and through
Those pleasant rambles:
When tired, we drank till we were fu’,
At Collin Campb’ll’s.*
16
I like a joyous nour to spend
With social glass and genial friend,
For then our darkest cares will wend
We know not whither,
To see our happiest feelings blend
With one another.
17
Were we among our native hills,
Where bonnie Couquett stream distills,
And Wandsbeck, queen of sparkling rills,
And hawthorns scented—
We’d whet , again our blunted quills,
And live contented.
* An Hotel at Choppington, nearßedlington,


18
We’d muse upon each place and time,
Where all things bear the glow of rhyme,
Where every bush and tree can chime
The raptured story,
Which fire the youth in every clime
To love and glory.
Whose mountain summit, glen, and cave,
Speak of the glories of the brave,
Who marched forth like the stemless wave,
’Mid battle’s clang;
Laying down the tyrants, and the slave,
In layers slang.
20
0 ! then, sweet muse, harmonious maid,
Could I for once but win thine aid,
To touch those glorious scenes portrayed
In ancient story,
Where sternest warriors deep did wade
Through blood to glory !
21
Fair gentle Muse, take thou my hand,
Lead me to that bright fairy land
Where near to Nature I may stand
In musing mood,
And every natural charm command,
By field and flood.
22
Or to some calm'immortal shrine,
Where those who loved and sang recline,
The glory of the radiant Nine,
In sweet repose;
Where every art in grace combine,
And genius glows.
23
Yes! were I young, I might aspire,
To touch that mighty swelling lyre,
That wins all hearts; the heart-felt fire,
Which all men know,
Should be my theme, should me inspire,
In joy or woe.


24
But ah! I fear that time’s gone by,
That lit the flame in you and I,
Which gave a light to every sky
And streamlet glancing,
And sent the spirits dancing high,
Like coursers prancing.
25
Now like a barque with folded sail,
I drift before life’s rustling gale;
Still would I chant some cheerful tale,
As long’s I may
And with my genial friend still hail
Each closing day.
26
T 6 sit with thee beside the Are,
When day with all its toils retire,
To hear thee sweep the passionate lyre,
The heart revealing,
Warming the soul till it inspire
The holiest feeling.
27
What then were courts, kingdoms, and state,
The gilded name that sounds so great,
The boiling wine, the costly plate,
The dazzling glare,
Have oft been found, alas! too late—
Not worth their care.
23
Keep to thy muse, my gentle crony,
Still weave those lines so soft and bonnie,
Of lovers’ woes, and gossips funny,
Until we meet,
When o’er eacji tale, dearer than money,
We’ll laugh and greet.
W. REAY.


TO A WILD FLOWER WITHOUT A NAME.
’Twas in a wild uncultured bower,
I found a little nameless flower.
It blushed in purest virgin hue,
And breathed and fed on silver dew.
The streaks around its golden eye
Showed nature’s wond’rous harmony.
A yellow tint, a purple streak,
As we have seen the morning break.
And there were of the faintest hue,
Some soft’ning tints of fading blue,
As it had only gazed upon
The grey of dawn—the rising sun;
So small a thing, suggesting much
Which oft is seen in nature’s touch.
A sudden gleam in glen or bower
Will give a landscape all its power;
Or a gust of wind will bring
Fancies that will make us cling
To our musings many a day,
Sending off the world to play,
With its toils and trade and din—
Tales of sorrow, tales of sin.
Thus brooding o’er this lovely flower,
I truly spent a sacred hour.
Though I knew no tale of old
That described its silken fold,
As I scanned it o’er and o’er,
I could find no fairy lore,
Elves and fairies tired of sport,
Here, might well have held their court.
Had I a fairy been I’d rest
Eight within its golden breast,
And nestling in my gorgeous bower,
Dream away a blissful hour.
But no tale this flower could own,
That conld speak of moments flown;


It’s glittering form and hues so bright,
Were all to me but strangers quite.
It had no tale of love for me,
Of childish mirth or childish glee,
But still I felt some mystic power,
Was hanging round that simple flower.
’Twas like a maiden breathing prayer;
I felt its gentle presence there—
So pure a thing from God to grace
So lone a spot, so drear a place.
But why, thought I, so cruel, I ween,
So fair a thing should bloom unseen,
So far obscure, so lone and drear,
No signs of one companion near ;
’Twas all alone—seemed half afraid,
But gently lent its grace to aid
The winds that round its bosom played,
Yet bravely bore on slender stem,
It’s scented glittering diadem.
No vulgar gaze it sought to claim,
A stranger to the world and fame,
Content to live without a name.
62.
A VISION.
1874.
The evening shades fell soft and sweet,
And downy as the wings of love,
When fancy led my wandering feet
Far down a fairy haunted grove.
I rested near an ancient tower
That whispered tales of other days,
Which suited well the lonely hour,
And well might suit a poet’s lays.


I lingered there, and lingered long,
And night itself seemed fain to stay,
"When lo T I heard a fairy song
That wiled all gloomy thoughts away.
She sang the dawn of silent hours,
When husy cares of life recede,
How sweet to press the breathing flowers,
How sweet the whisperings of a reed—
How lonesome is the night bird’s scream,
Through sleeping glens of forest shade,
How sweet to hail the foremost gleam
The dawning in the east hath made.
How sweet when fancy roves at will
Amongst the mystic forms of even—
How sweet the falling of a rill,
When nought is near this earth but heaven.
But now the moon in silvery car,
Drives gently up the dappled east,
And throws her mystic beams afar,
Eevealing forms in beauty drest.
And as the grand old moon arose,
Against the highest eastern tower,
A manly form she did disclose,
A form of grandeur, wealth and power.
A minstrel’s harp stood by his side,
A warrior’s spear shook in his hand,
"Whilst all the soul of cadence sighed,
It’s music o’er the moonlit land.
His words bore trace of ancient date,
Like injured worth, bold, fierce and strong,
And railing ’gainst the tide of fate,
His soul seemed bursting in his song.
When lo ! another form appeared,
Array’d in robes of spotless white,
Who with a graceful motion near’d
The poet warrior. Woeful wight.


“0! pale, pale form,” the warrior cried,
“ Art thou what thou wert wont to be,
The genius of the heaving tide,
Yet sways not man’s cruel destiny ?
“ I know thy aim is pure and good,
And peaceful as glen,
But still, alas! the gory flood
Still rushes through the ways of men.
“ Well thou hast known in former times,
The ardour of the poet’s strains,
That swelled the burden of his rhymes,
To free the bonded from their chains.
“ The bonded are the bonded still,
The guilty yet in guilt remain,
And fiercest passion wild at will,
Keep marching in the downward train.
“ Still may be seen in anger rise,
The blood-stained banners on the field;
Unheeded are the piercing cries,
Where none can conquer, none can yield.
“ Oh! I have wept for ages past,
And yet may weep for times to come,
This life’s a harvest darkly cast,
A groping, groping to the tomb.”
What more he said, what more he felt,
‘Twas not for mortal man to hear
His soul, his harp, his form did melt
In elements of empty air.
EPISTLE TO THE REVEREND.
In answer to one in which he had been rather rough on a
Homan Catholic Priest.
1.
Thou canty loon! thou joyous carle,
Is it the tooming 0 the barrel
That fills thee fuest in this wharle
Of funny jokes—
I laugh, and fear to hear thee snarle
At ither folks—


2.
Tty biting wit runs wild and free,
Like frosty winds ttrougt bust and tree,
Keen freezing all ttat ctance to be
Just in tty way—
I trust ttou’lt spare thy blows on me
This many a day—
3.
Thy wit is like tty country’s wit,
Severe and keen when’er you hit,
Not like a Frenchman’s fire and sprit
And windy war.
Where’er you strike, you cut the bit,
And leave a scar—
4. ,
You call the wicked drunkin priest
Far worse than some would call a beast,
And gloat upon it like a feast
Enough to end him.
But say thy most, or say thy least,
You cannot mend him.
5.
You speak in language most severe
Of his false looks that look sincere,
His winning smiles and gestures queer,
Too bad to mention.
And yet he lives with conscience clear
And pure intention!
6.
For pity spare the “greasy brute,”
Or drive him in amang the nowte,
For like ourselves he wears the clout,
And woe betide it.
If chance come in his daily route
He cannot hide it!
7.
Leave him my honest canty callen,
To heavy handed pastor Allen,
Who some day yet may send him sprawling
Head over heels.
Still may the Lord prevent him falling
’Mong homed deils—


8.
For me I would not blame him mair,
I’m but a sinner every hair,
Where’er I go I must take care
Of foul temptation.
And well might pray the deil to spare
Me fornication—
9.
You’ve often wandered far astray,
And so have I before to-day,
I’ll mend the matter when I pray
As best I can.
And lastly, mingle with the clay
A holy man.
TO A MOSQUITO.
1.
Mosquito, Oh, thou tiresome thing !
You hump-backed body, let mo be,
And go and put thy fearful sting
Into a tree
Or into anything but me ! •
2.
You spoil my comfort night and day!
You long-legged devil full of spite!
To you it may be nought but play—
Even delight,
To sing about my ears at night!
3.
I’m sure I never liked your song,
Nor any other thing you do;
I believe that if you were as strong
As Kearney’s cow
That with your horn you’d run us through.


4.
When leaving home to cross the sea,
To seek for gold and sunny skies,
I did not think to meet with thee
To sting my eyes!
You took my wife too hy surprise
5.
You dirty, ill-shaped, greedy elf,
I wish that you had ne’er been bred!
I’ll speak thus freely for myself —
I wish thee dead!
Then comes the curtains from my bed!
6.
And small use have my curtains been—
The smallest hole you find it out,
With thy blood-thirsty searching een
Or by thy snout;
But in you get and roam about!
7.
Sometimes you seize upon my nose,
Sometimes you get upon my back,
And just when stealing off to doze
You make attack;
Then forth I rush your legs to crack.
8.
But you are equal to your trade,
Or else a lucky thing indeed;
For clear you’re off and quickly made
Our Willie bleed!
Can only blood supply thy need ?
9.
And there, just like a drunkard, thou
Hast drunk till now thou can’st not rise!
I’ll make thy carcase black and blue,
And close thy eyes!
So-so! so-so ! and so thou dies!
10
And just like thine the drunkard’s fate
When justice sues him for her bill ;
The doctor rushes in too late
With drop or pill!
His work is done, his limbs are still!


11.
There, Burgess like, Levey or Kelly,
Or Sullivan* the worst of all,
You came here to fill your belly
With blood or gall!
Had I my will I’d hang you all!
12
Tis not for thee that I would mourn!
But the poor drunkard claims a tear,
Who leaves a young wife all forlorn
And children dear.
All for the sake of drinking beer !
13
But then I do not mean a tale
Of moral truth to him or thee ;
I know he was too fond of ale,
And you of me
Then for the future let me be !
14
Just look upon a new-chum’s face
And put thy conscience to the test;
And if you feel it no disgrace
To see distress,
Compunction lives not in thy breast
15.
But there is one you ne’er could hurt;
And that one is my brother John !
He takes your music all as sport;
And for your prong
He would not fear were it twice as long!
16
But then it must bo nought but blow,
Or else the poorness of his blood ;
Or else why is’t you will not go
To him for food !
Is his skin as hard as wood ?
17.
But I’ll conclude this silly rhyme,
For silly ryhme ’tis sure to be ,
When I begin to spend my time
On such as thee,
For all men hate thy company!

THE ELECTION.
A SKETCH—A FRAGMENT — 1874.
1
Scarce from beneath a clouded sun
Had the day began to dawn,
When folks began to shout and run,
And on each other ca’n
“Come,” cried the “Blues”,* “get up and own
Tour man at this election.
And vote for him who ne’er was known
To blink at your Protection,
By night or day.”
2
For well you know that he has been
The friend of man and woman,
And every little careless wean
That runs about the common ;
Then let your foremost foot be set,
In spite of kith and kin,
And if your ragged coats be het
He’ll soak them to the skin,
Wi’ drink this day.
3
I
Hark! hark! here comes a rattling sound
Of horsemen and of coaches,
And ribbons flying round and round
As the great man approaches,
With many a queer deriding shout,
Mixed up with wild huzzahs,
Enough to turn the head about,
And scarcely know the cause,
Por din that day.
4
Now some were full of wrath sincere,
Aye, foaming to the brim,
And some were full of Woods’s beer
Enough to make them swim ;
And swim they did, from house to house,
For votes all round were fishing,
Till each one stood within his shoes
A mighty politician,
With drink that day.
'Candidates color.


5
Gould I but paint the dust and din,
Hie swearing and confusion,
Some perchance would call’t a sin
And some perhaps delusion.
But when the mighty man appeared
Upon his lofty standing,
And his towering height upreared,
The sight was most commanding
To view that day.
6.
He raised his hand and made a speech,
In truth it was a thumper,
He stood like Silenus to teach
The virtue of the bumper.
Oft like a father he had been
To the poor erring miner,
And used both height and weight to screen
Him ’gainst some false designer,
On many a day.
7.
He knew right well what St—ns meant,
(The poor bewildered dreamer.)
He seeks a place in Parliament
To repiesent his steamer —
A poor, beleaguxed, labouring hulk
Just fit for boys to fish in—
Beneath the shade of which he’ll skulk
To be a politician
For you to-day.
8.
He talks about reducing fares
From Newcastle to Sydney,
Which from the shoulder straight declares
He’s not the real kidney;
For then we know to make amends,
He Chinamen engages,
Which only serves to suit his ends
In pulling down the wages,
On any day.


9.
But here a voice from ’mongst the crowd
Cried out wi’ might and main,
“Why did you do that dirty job,
Why stop the Lambton train ?
Ton sent it up to Waratah, .
Where Y ts and Charley wanted,
And disappointed one and a’
When you did fairly grant it
• To us that day.”
10.
Where is the Ventilation Bill ?
What has become of that ?
The truth is you were lying still
Whene’er the Houses sat.
Look at our faces —white as chalk—
Can hardly get our breath—
And you’ll stand wi’ your mighty talk
And talk us all to death,
For naught this day.
11.
Come, stop your foul mouth, Peter, lad—
- Your blathering and your jeering,
This honest business sets you mad
And foolish wits careering.
I’ve noted everything you’ve said,
And what those things were said for;
It’s drink -that’s got within your head,
Which you have never paid for,
This very day.
12.
Now take you this, and take you that!
And thus they went to blows;
Some one broke poor Peter’s hat,
And someone broke his nose.
The dust and din, the sticks and stones,
Which followed fast and faster
Battled hard upon their bones,
Which sent them off for plaster,
That busy day.


13.
I never thought the crowd so wise,
So mighty in orations,
Or such methods could devise
In giving explanations.
They seized each other by the throat
And some were hurled in ditches;
One man lost his Sunday coat,
Another lost his breeches.
In the strife that day.


SONGS AND LYRICS.
Why should I sit in gloom and sigh
For Lucy, silly maiden;
I’ve got others in my eye
With far more beauty laden.
The glances of sweet Jenny’s ’ee,
Her snow white teeth when smiling,
Have won a thousand sighs from me,
My very soul beguiling.
Last eve upon a green clad knowe,
Just when the sun was sinking,
I met my graceful Maggy Howe,
Who full of love was blinking;
I threw my arms around her waist,
And took sweet kisses many;
Each panting bliss did prove the taste
To be more sweet than honey.
Then why should man so simple prove,
By reason so deserted,
For any single maiden’s love
To wander broken hearted;
I, like the busy wandering bee
From flower to floweret roaming,
Will hum the song so dear to me,
The countless charms of woman.


THE GLENS OE EAVENSWORTH.
The flow’ry glens of Eavensworth
Will ever Hush and bloom for me;
’Twas there I met the fairest maid
That e’er was seen in Ohristendie.
The flowery glens of Eavensworth,
The flowery glens of Eavensworth.—
’Mong summer flowers and scented
showers,
That haunt the glens of Eavensworth.
When summer suns would fall to rest,
As wearied with the toils of day;
With golden locks upon my breast,
She’d listen all my heart could say.
The flowery, &c.
And when the day’s last gleam would fade,
And leave to night the tranquil sky,
Soft kisses on her lips I laid,
While fragrant zephyrs stole her sigh.
Along the glens, &c.
The tinsel’s blaze and gilt of state,
May well allure the vacant soul;
But can it feel a throb as great
As that which through my bosom stole.
Along the glens, &c.
FAREWELL TO SCOTLAND.
Farewell to thee, Scotland, farewell to thy mountains
Farewell to thy glens, full of mystical lore ;
Farewell to thy rivers, and wild gushing fountains,
My fate has been sealed, I shall see thee no more.


Farewell to those crags, clad with bright blooming
heather,
Where the wild deer may roam, and the eagle
may fly;'
Farewell, dearest scenes, we have hunted together,
And ’joyed to the full my dear Mary and I!
Farewell misty land, thy thistle shall wave still,
And the poet and warrior shall guard it with pride.
When I am away in some far foreign grave ; still
Where nought of my country can bloom by my
side !
Now wild o’er the waves our vessel is speeding,
And wild is the wind, but I heed not its din,
For my heart all alone in my bosom is bleeding,
So wild is the storm that is raging within.
I heed not the light’ning, the thunder, and danger,
And the dart heaving billows in madness may
foam;
While I’m driven away to the land of the stranger,
Far away, far away, far away from my home.
THE LASS OF BROWNIEBURN.
[Brownieburn is a highly interesting streamlet,' in the
county of Durham, and will doubtless be remembered with
pleasure by many residents here, The following lines were
composed in memory of the happy hours I spent there.]
I met her near her mother’s cot,
I kiss’d her neath the hazel tree;
And oh that was the sweetest gift
This world had ever given me!
The bonnie lass of Browniehurn!
The bonnie lass of Brownieburn!
As long as time shall o’er me run,
I’ll love the lass of Brownieburn.


The violets grow within her eyes,
The roses bloom upon her cheek;
And ’neath those fringed canopies,
There gleams a soul so pure, and meek.
The bonnie lass; &c.
I cannot tell what bliss I feel,
I cannot count what joys are mine;
An angel’s tongue, I’m sure would fail
To speak my raptures all divine.
The bonnie lass, &c.
Could I the wealth of kingdoms daim,
As idle dust the gift I’d spurn;
If I should lose the girl I name,
The bonnie lass of Brownieburn.
TO MARY.
The sun had crept behind the west,
And lull’d the bustling; day to rest;
When through the quiet fields I prest,
To tell my love to Mary.
The flowers that bent beneath my feet,
Their scented heads in dew so sweet;
Are emblems of the joys I meet,
■When close beside my Mary.
Each balmy gale that stole around,
Awoke a whispering voice profound;
In every sight and every sound
That spoke of love and Mary.
The rains may fall, the winds may blow,
Yet o’er the highest hills I’d go
In spite of friend, in spite of foe,
To tell my love to Mary.


TO A.
Far away, o’er moor and fell,
Where the blooming heather bell
Is sighing love; there would I tell
How much I dearly love thee.
Where no prying eyes invade,
I’ll wrap thee in my silken plaid,
And tell thee, sweetest, dearest maid,
How much I dearly love thee.
With a draught of balmy air,
I’ll drink to thee, my charming fair,
Mountain beauty, floweret rare;
Shall tell how much I love thee.
The light that glows within thine eyes
Is purer than the starry skies,
When the balmiest evening sighs
To tell how much I love thee.
When my soul’s undying faith
Is panting in the arms of death,
With my latest fleeting breath,
Til sigh and say I love thee.
May, 1880.
JENNY.
The heather's blooming still, Jenny
Far across the sea,
And yon little rill, Jenny,
Babbles yet of thee;
It tells how oft I met thee there—
It sings about thy yellow hair—
It says we’ll maybe meet nae mair—
Upon yon gowan lea.


The sun doth rise and set, Jenny,
Still on yon gowan lea,
Where 6ft in love we met, Jenny,
Far across the sea;
The glowing west, with purple sky,
And rosy morning’s scented sigh,
And flowerets flipp’d in purest dye,
Meet still on yonder lea.
It is both sad and sweet, Jenny,
To think upon the past,
For time with winged feet, Jenny,
Hurries on so fast;
It stole those youthful joys away,
And other joys that could not stay—
But, oh! our love will live for aye,
Upon yon gowan lea.
TO A MUSICAL BOY.
I would not have my moments stole
By those who rant and sing,
Without a heart—without a soul,
. To sound life’s deepest string.
But I can listen to thy strain—
It brings to me such joy;
Gome sing it o’er and o’er again,
My sweet melodious boy.
I love those ancient melodies—
lake this, thy simple song;
They waken up old memories
When life and I were strong.
They steal so gently o’er the past,
E’en through forgotten ways,
Before aught had the power to cast
A shadow o’er those days.


Thou canst not know what he hath felt,
Who made that song of thine;
Nor why it makes the teardrop melt
Within these eyes of mine.
Yet let me hear once more that strain—
It brings to me such joy;
I’d listen o’er and o’er again,
My sweet melodious boy.
I AM HAPPY IN MY COT.
I am happy in my cot,
Thotigh poverty is wi’ me;
There’s no a sweeter spot,
That riches e’er could gie me;
On riches I ne’er think,
I hae wealth that’s far ahoon it;
And that’s the sunny blink
Of my ain bonhie Jennet.
"When I go home at nights,
• Tired oft, and weary,
The world and all its fights,
Are lost beside my dearie.
Oh! the light of love is sweet,
There’s mair than mortal in it;
Wi’ joy I’m like to greet,
When near my bonnie Jennet.
This world’s ways I dree’,
Misfortune might assay me;
My happiness would dee,
If death should take her frae’ me.
Of this I dare not think,
She is such a winsome linnet;
0, precious is the link
Of my ain, Bonnie Jennet.
I am somewhat indebted to another Poet for the first eight
lines of the above.


BONNIE BELL OE BLAWWEARY.
A herd’s daughter, who was a few years ago famed for her
beauty all over the English border. The following lines
were suggested by an account given to me lately by one who
was personally acquainted with her:—
Hast thou never seen’Bonnie Bell of Blaw-
weary?
Hast thou never seen Bonnie Bell of Blawweary ?
Then thy eyes must he dull, and thy heart must he
dreary,
If thou hast not seen Bonnie Bell of Blawweary.
Away o’er yon hill, and let nothing fear thee,
Away o’er yon hill, though the wind’s bleak and
bleary,
For the day that is sent unto thee is misspent,
If thou hast not seen Bonnie Bell of Blawweary.
Heed not the distance, the dangers nor ditches,
Nor yon mountain* side, where dance fairies and
witches,
Should’si thou chance to meet them, they’ll make thy
heart cheery,
For the queen of them all’s Bonnie Bell of Blaw-
weary.
How sweet to the eye is the honnie heath blossom,
Remembrance of childhood, how dear to each bosom,
But the best of all charms when the heart’s lone and
dreary,
Is a smile or a glance from the Queen of Blaw-
weary.
*A noted haunt of the fairies and witches.


BONNIE BELFORD TOWN.
The dearest spot in England
Art thou, sweet Belford Town,
Which like a glittering gem is set
Within a kingly crown.
God bless thy hills, and dales, and bowers
With early springs and budding flowers;
For there I spent my happiest hours,
Near thee, sweet Belford town.
Thy waving woods and heath-clad hills,
And valleys fresh and green,
And all thy little charming rills,
Are far obscure I ween.
Yet, when daylight had gone to rest,
We sought old friends we loved the best,
We told our tale, and had our jest
In thee, sweet Belford town.
The busy world may deem me weak,
And <idle in my dreaming,
And chide the tear upon my cheek,
In fondest memories gleaming.
They never felt, nor can they see
The pleasing charms I found in thee.
Or they would sit and sigh with me,
For thee, sweet Belford town.
The wandering wind doth often sing
Thy elfin tales of old,
The antics of some fairy king
Or giants grimly bold.
What folly ’tis! yet fain, 0 fain!
I’d roam those pleasant scenes again,
And live and die a simple swain
Near thee, sweet Belford town.


CASTLE CAMPBELL.
Castle Campbell is a picturesque ruin, about a mile north of
Dollar, on the summit of a high hill at the head of a finely
-wooded ravine of the Ochil Hills, in the Stirling neighbour-
hood.
It was a pleasant time that when
In youth I used to ramhle,
Around each bush, and through each glen
Near bonnie Castle Campbell.'
Where’er I am, where’er I go,
"When purest passions tremble,
I think upon that spreading bough
Where I met Mary Campbell.
But fortune has been much to blame
That caused me far to wander,
Far frae my love, and far frae hame,
Sae mony years to squander.
But Til return to hame and then
I’ll end each weary ramble;
And look upon that spot again,
Where I woo’d Mary Campbell.
’Tis five long years since I began
In fame and fortune’s scramble,
And many a thousand mile I ran
Frae honnie Castle Campbell.
Now fame and fortune baith are mine
For hame again I’ll ramble,
And put a golden hand in thine—
My honnie Mary Campbell.
'When o’er the stormy seas I’ve sped,
And wed to Mary Campbell—
With hearts so light, with airy tread,
So pleased again we’ll ramble;
We’ll seek the fruit that grows so red
On the hawthorn bush and bramble,
And when we’re tired on heathy bed
We’ll rest near Castle Campbell.


LINES TO A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
Beauty on thy brow is beaming,
Beauty doth thy neck enfold;
Beauty’s on those tresses streaming
O’er shoulders framed from beauty’s mould.*
Beauty from thy blue eyes glancing,
Lighteth all they chance to meet,
And thy lovely form enhancing
All we deem in life most sweet.
Fairer than the dawn of morning,
Sweeter than the newborn flower,
Brighter than the star adorning
Day when near his parting hour.
Purer than the rapt poet’s thought,
Hallowing the star of even,
Emblem of the throne of God—
Dearest progeny of heaven.
Prostrate now I bow before thee,
Bending low at beauty’s shrine;
Trembling lest I dim the glory
Breathing round thy form divine.
*1 am indebted to J. S. for the first four lines.
PEGGY IS UNKIND TO ME.
I’m sad because my Peggy’s cool,
as the wind of night,
When the frost is on the pool
And the stars are out of sight.
Come thou weeping wailing willow,
Here thy woeful shrine shall be;
Throw thy shadows o’er my pillow,
Peggy is unkind to me.


How sweet were once the joys of morning,
And the blythe unfolding spring;
Now I feel no bliss returning,
Howso’er the birds may sing,
As they fan their songs to heaven
On the throne of melody ;
Still I sit in sorrow grieving,
Peggy is unkind to me.
Should I wander through the meadows,
’Mongst the flowers of every hue;
A woeful weight, a thousand shadows,
Crowd around the violets blue;
There I see my doom, the rarest
Eyes this world did ever see,
And her face it is the fairest,
But she is unkind to me.
YON BONNIE BLINKING LASSIE.
There lives a lass upon yon knowe
Wi’ blinking een so bonnie,
And golden locks upon her brow
That’s won the hearts ofmony.
Her beauty and her playfulness,
Has won my own, I must confess,
0 that in love I might caress
Yon bonnie blinking lassie.
"When I go to bed at night,
I tumble on my pillow,
With hopes and fears, and sweet delight,
I’m like the restless billow.
My hopes and fears alternate rove
O’er all the sweet mishaps of love,
And sigh for want of power to prove
How much I love yon lassie.


But she is proud, and coldly said,
'She heeds not my complaining,
Yet on her breast I’d lay my head
And die ’neath her disdaining;
Or should she deign to grant but this,
The magic of one tender kiss,
I’d live for ever on that bliss
And bless that bonnie lassie.
THE IMPATIENT SHEPHERD.
Come shepherds, let us fold our flocks,
The sun is red’ning in the west;
We’ll on the rafters hang our hooks
. And meet the lasses we like best,
Bonnie lasses blythe and gay,
Amd sweeter than the flowers in May.
The evening star begins to shine,
The moon’s faint horn is in the sky.
Amd Jenny for the Trysten time
Will think and look as well as 1.-
Bonnie Jenny blythe and gay,
And fairer than the flowers in May.
Poor simple sheep, we’ll "leave you now,
What is your life ? no joy nor sorrow,
Amid those drowsy tinklings low,
You can but dream of grass to-morrow;
But we of lasses blythe and gay
And brighter than the flowers in May.
JULIA.
There is a joy, a sparkling grace
That glitters round my Julia,
But half the beauty of her face
Might steal a thousand hearts away.


There’s magic in her graceful form,
A something words cannot display,
That would disarm the slightest harm
If it came near my Julia.
The fairest flowers in summer bowers,
May gaily flaunt their time away,
Though e’er so fair they’ll ne’er compare
With blushing, blooming Julia.
How grand the bliss, if hut to kiss
The rosy lips of Julia;
To win a sigh that well might buy
Eternal bliss from Julia.
WERE I AMONG TON EOCKS AND HILLS.
Were I among yon rocks and hills,
My steps would never weary;
Where dreamless of all earthly ills
I’d wander with my dearie.
Who is as pure as morning dew,
That feeds the opening blossom:
Where with a heart as fond and true
I’d nestle in her bosom.
Long may yon trees and hushes bloom,
And flowerets flaunt so cheery
And rocks and hills in grandeur loom
So please my winsome dearie.
The rocks and hills, the sea and sky
That look so bright and cheery,
Would load the winds with many a sigh.
If aught should happen Mary.


0 time thou hast a tardy pace,
When those we love are wanting.
When nought within the rounds of space
Can yield us aught enchanting.
Haste! haste! ye busy winds that blow.
The fates of men together;
And let my cup of bliss o’erflow,
Or my poor heart must wither.
24.
TO MARION.
Fain would I hang upon those lips
And drink their sweetness every hour,
Greedier than the bee that sips
It’s honeyed life from flower to flower—
Fain would I weave a song more fine
Than ever hailed the morning sun,
And all its glory should be thine,
My fairest breathing Marion.
Fain would I range that garden fair
Where two rosebuds so sweetly grow,
So rich in hue beyond compare
Upon two creamy hills aglow.
There would I shield them from the blast
If winter days should dawn upon,
And feast on beauty till the last—
My fairest breathing Marion.
TO A WILD BIRD THAT WAS SHOT AT
WITHOUT EFFECT.
Beautiful bird, thou still art free,
The joys of life may still be thine;
Now spread thy wings o’er land and sea,
And exult in a life divine.


Now far beyond the spoiler’s aim,
Who strove to mar thee in thy flight;
Such joy as thine he ne’er may claim
To yield his dark’ned soul delight.
Oh, for a heart and soul of fire
To mount up as on wings like thee,
Then might I reach the burning lyre
That thrills the soul for liberty.
In vain my thoughts would upward soar
To such a height on wings of fame,
But though I fail I’ll still adore,
And hail the muse that fans the flame.
TO ADVERSITY.
What care I tow fortune blows,
' So long as health plays round my hearth,
Like the summer’s blooming rose
Where sickness never yet had birth;
There is contentment yet for me
’Mid all thy frowns, Adversity.
Though I must tramp at midnight hours
Through miry pools and beds of clay,
Through summer heats and winter showers—
I joy in each returning day,
While yet my heart and hands are free
To fight thy winds, Adversity.
And though I must my couch forsake,
When all the world should be at rest,
A grateful feeling still can make
My heart a king within my breast.
While yet my heart and hands are free
To fight thy winds, Adversity.


It is not beauty, wealth, nor fame
: That crowns the top of human joy,
It is to have a noble aim
Which fortune’s frowns can ne’er destroy;
My heart’s my fate where’er I be,
Blow on, blow on, Adversity.
The following lines were suggested by a picture, which, as a
work of art, was hnt of little worth; but there was a
something in it, as Drummond says, which spoke of the
long past of infancy, and the bright pearl-like days of
childhood.
SYMPATHY.
How kind and true is that critc’s eye
By the touch of sweet sympathy made;
He loveth the tone of that evening sky—
’Tis beautiful, light and shade.
How dear is the form of that old, old, mill!
Though no signs of life now be there,
Save the dash of the rill, reminding still
His boyhood reveries there.
How warm in his breast is that lambent flame
"Which lighteth the old grey wall,
And he thinketh of one, yet her beautiful name
Doth the saddest of thoughts recall.
And there’s yet a thread of that untrodden path
Where his feet in sweet infancy strayed,
And there is the spot where he plighted his faith
To his long lost beautiful maid.
Our joys and our sorrows are ever at strife,
As we travel o’er hill and dale,
And meet with the touch of this beautiful life, —
But in sadness ends the tale.


THE LITTLE BIRD.
A little bird sang on the branch of a tree,
And his heart seemed to dance in his bosom with glee,
For no withered care had that bosom e’er prest,
And his heart was so glad that his tongue could not
rest,
And blithely he sang o’er his bonnie built nest,
Which was made of dry leaves and a wee bit of
heather,
Where five little chirpers were crushed in
together
Cosy and warm, ’neath the wings of their
mither.
As the little bird poured forth his notes from the
tree,
They yielded the sweetest enjoyment to me,
For who loveth not when wandering among
The joys of the forest—the little bird’s song—
Sweet poet of the woods singing all the day long;
His voice is the voice of the flowers and spring,
The sweetest of echoes around doth ring,
Where could we listen a holier thing ?
But, alas! the next morning when passing that tree,
I looked at the branch, but no bird could I see,
I missed the sweet voice ringing sweet in the wood,
And fears with my wonder increased while I stood,
When I saw little feathers lying scattered in blood.
Oh! where is the soul, and what could that soul
see
That could shed such alife, that o’erflowed with
such glee ?
That soul is in bondage wherever it be.
DEAR LITTLE WILLIE.
Dear little Willie
Fair as a lily,
And thy bonnie moo;
A crimson tinted flower
Blooming in a bower
Glowing, mid the dew.


Thy clear blue eyes
Bright as morning skies,
After many storms,
Fill my heart with joy
My darling rosy boy,
I’ll clasp thee in my arms.
Where like a laughing flower
On an ancient tower,
Now worn grey with years
In this world of sadness,
Filling all with gladness,
Drying all my tears.
TO A YOUTH.
I have watched, just rising from his bed, the sun
Throw'forth 'his beauty over seas and hills,
(gladdening the lark when from the earth he sprung,
Whose flood of melody was poured on rills,
Which laughed and danced with soft daffodils
To the sweet strain of that ethereal note—
Which, as I remember yet, my heart fills
To o’erflowing;—yet from that throat,
Nor mountain, brook, nor flower, nor tree,
Nought can I find so beautiful as thee.
Now shall I build my fondest hopes in thee,
Thy soul being beautifid, as is thy face:
Then may’st thou be the thing I ne’er can be—
The joy of Art, the glory of thy Eace,
The beams of genius around thee blaze,
Heralding thy future and thy fame,
That men and children shall stand to gaze
Upon thy spotless forehead, and thy name
A glorious immortality shall claim.
1863.


Come forth, sweet youth, and do thy best,
Be that whate’er it may;
Thou’rt then obeying God’s high behest—
A hero in thy day.
A hero in thy day thou’lt be,
Bursting bonds of slavery.
Come, trust thyself, and let thy heart
Be ever bold and free;
And thine shall be a noble part,
To crown thy destiny.
Be thou a hero in the strife
Of battles bursting into life.
A mighty power, that power is thine,
With which to conquer fate;
Then fortune’s stars on thee shall shine,
And ope her golden gate.
And kings and princes glad shall be
To pay that homage due to thee.
Then look thy day full in the face,
Be God thy guide, thy King,
That, at the end of all thy days,
Thy soul may soar and sing.
May soar and sing for endless years—
A thing of beauty through the spheres.
TO A LADY SLEEPING.
Dome, fancy, with thy brightest wings,
As thou dost o’er her slumbers play,
And let her dreamings be of things
That she loveth best by day,
And sing to her thy sweetest lay.
TO A YOUTH.


And if in dreams she walks abroad,
Guide her where no tempest lowers,
Seat her on the greenest sward,
Bring to her the sweetest flowers,
Eunning brooks and shady bowers.
And when the dawn of day shall come.
Bursting ope the gates of light,
Guide her wand’ring spirit home
Ope again those eyes so bright,
Fountain of my soul’s delight.
JEANNIE SHAMES THE ROSES.
My Jeannie is the fairest flower
The eye of day discloses,
Blooming sweet in yonder bower,
My Jeannie shames the roses.
Her rosy cheek and eye of blue—
Her budding lips, the richest hue—
Are crystalled o’er in honey dew,
My Jeannie shames the roses.
My Jeannie is the blithest flower
The eye of day discloses,
Singing sweet in yonder bower,
My Jeannie shames the roses.
Her voice is like the warbling bird,
That mounts and sings up heavenward;
Her song can wake each trembling chord
That in the heart reposes.
My Jeannie is the brightest flower
The eye of day discloses,
A shining light in yonder bower,
My Jeannie shames the roses.
Her hair is like the early beams,
Which from the eastern welkin streams;
Yea, more than aught on earth she seems,
My Jeannie shames the roses.


BLUE EYED MARY.
When morning came into the east,
And threw ms windows open,
And wak’d the drowsy world from rest,
I thought that he was joking.
So quick had passed the joyful night,
Amid those raptures of delight,
Which glow’d beneath the glances bright
Of bonnie blue eyed Mary.
Her face is bonnier than the sun,
When robed in all his splendour;
For ’tis the hand that made the sun
That doth such beauty lend her.
Her eyes two brilliant meteors are,
That far outshine the brightest star
Which beams so kindly from afar
On bonnie blue eyed Mary.
I’m deep in love, I’m deep in love,
I’m deep in love with Mary,
O’er mossy hills and glens I’ll rove,
To gather sweets for Mary,
I’ll gather those most like hersel’, —
The rose, the lily, and blue bell,
And many more I may not tell
For bonnie blue eyed Mary.
WHERE I WOO’D MY JEAN.
How fondly doth our memory cling,
To joys of former days,
And harps again upon that string,
Which tuned life’s sweetest lays.
A wee bit thing, doth quickly call,
Each dear remembered scene ;
But, far the sweetest place of all—
Is where I woo’d my Jean.


Uy memory haunts that sweet bum side,
Where bonnie hazels hung;
Where, morning, noon, and eventide
The little birdies sung.
How sweetly did their music fall,
Within the bushes green;
It is the sweetest place of all—
’Twas there I woo’d my Jean!
Could I retrace the heels of time,
Amid the flush of youth,
What joys again would then be mine;
What innocence and truth !
How I would hail each evening’s fall,
Beside that bum unseen,
And seek those sweetest joys of all—
Again I’d woo my Jean!
MY LADY’S EYES.
See the early beams of mom
Streaming o’er the eastern brow,
Of the day just newly bom.
And each flower is filled with dew;
Like my lady’s eyes they seem
Brilliant in his early beam.
See bright Sol as he doth ride
O’er the eastern gates so high ;
And the God in all his pride,
Drinks each fairy goblet dry
Yet my lady’s eyes still seem—
Brighter than his brightest beam.
See when near his western tour
Bed with rage he seems to be;
Why, my lady every hour
Sheds a brighter beam than he !
Oh my lady’s eyes still seem,
Brighter than his brightest beam.


Now, like a vanquished hero, he
. Bows his head upon his breast,
And his honors like a sea
Of glory, fades within the west.
And my lady’s eyes still seem
Brighter than his dying beam !
THE SOLDIER'S VOW.
I’ll seal, sweet maid, again that vow,
If stronger, it may be, than ever;
I’ll swear again that only thou
Shalt be my only love for ever.
A soldier, —I have wandered far
Through burning climes and stormy sea ;
And e’en amidst the din of war,
I’ve stayed my hand to think on thee.
No more shall thrilling bugles sing,
With power to wile me to the plain,
To swell the triumphs of a king,
Exulting o’er the bleeding slain.
My theme shall be the lover’s lay,
The husband’s joy, the father’s pride,
My heart an ever-beaming ray
Of love for thee my blooming bride !
THE FORSAKEN MAID.
Pretty maiden, why thus stray
Like a leaflet blown away ?
Why unbosomed to the breeze ?
Is it thus thy heart seeks ease ?
The wind is cold, thy form so fair. 1
Was never meant this storm to bear —
Bold)ice hangs on thy yellow hair.


Pretty maiden, why thus stray?
Turn and seek thy home, I pray;
Or if thou wilt persist to go
In the wind and in the snow,
I pray the blast will milder be,
Over land and over sea,
And cruel winter pity thee.
Thy piteous look doth seem to say,
All thy life hath blown away,
Thy snowy bosom seems a fold,
Of many sorrows yet untold.
If it bears a broken heart,
Let me claim that broken part,
And thou again to being start.
WHA WAS THAT I MET YESTREEN.
And wha was that I met yestreen ?
"Wha was’t but Jenny Stewart ?
For beauty she is Scotland’s Queen*
That braw lass Jenny Stewart.
That braw lass Jenny Stewart,
Blue eyed Jenny Stewart;
If all Australia’s gold were mine
I’d gie’t for Jenny Stewart.
I am not now what I hae been
Since I saw Jeanie Stewart;
A , pang is in my bosom keen
That aches for Jeanie Stewart.
That braw lass Jeanie Stewart,
Blue eyed Jeanie Stewart;
If all Australia’s gold were mine
I’d gie’t for Jeanie Stewart.


A SONNET.
To s shapeless cairn in memory of one who had died lor
liberty, or religion, or perhaps both.
Thou solitary thing, built on this mountain side
Breathing the spirit of a bygone time—
Of daring men, who braved the fiercest tide
That ever surged and sang a song sublime
To earthly ears; the records of this mountain glen
Are singing in the winds, and urging still
The sanctity of all that’s noblest in the souls of men—
The purest motived, and the noblest will;
The schoolboy here might sigh, the maiden weep,
The matron mourn, the grey haired man feel strong
And hopeful in the march, as down the steep
Declivity of life he moves along
The inevitable path, which he shall ne’er return,
With the brightest of all hopes which comfort those
that mourn.
LOVE AND PASSION.
A sweet young maiden and her lover,
Sat beneath a green leafed cover,
When in vain he sought to prove her
As he ne’er had done before.
He kissed her lips, so red and rosy,
Said her cheeks were like a posy,
And nestled in her breast so cosy,
As he ne’er had done before.


He spoke a word which did amaze her,
And filled her beauteous eyes of azure,
And such a horror then did seize her,
Such she ne’er had known before.
like the wind that leaps and rushes,
Through the brakes and tangled bushes,'
With a face confused in blushes,
As it ne’er had been before.
Just then the glorious star of even
Trembled on the brink of heaven,
Falling as it had been driven
From this world for evermore.
THERE’S NONE SO BRIGHT AS THOU.
The poet in his happiest dream
The brightest song may weave;
But should he choose thee for his theme
His words must all deceive.
The scented lilly’s tender blush
Could never match thy brow;
The sweetest rose upon the bush
Was ne’er so fair as thou.
The gleam that lives within thine eyes
Beyond the diamonds shine,
The golden light in morning skies
Could never equal thine.


The King that sits upon his throne,
With jewels upon his brow,
Might heave a sigh, and frankly own,
There’s none so bright as thou.
THE SHEPHERD IN THE MOUNTAIN MIST.
The shepherd in the mountain mist,
With joy enfolds his chequered plaidie,
And feels himself supremely blest,
When throw’n it round lus rustic lady.
But are we not more blessed than they,
More cozy in our joyous sporting,
Defying e’en the God of clay,
Behind this silken crimson curtain.
0! that bliss like this should cloy,
Or age should give a hintful token;
Or aught in heaven or earth destroy
Those links that never should bo broken.
But like old time still onward roll,
In endless palpitating motion,
Till these sweet raptures of the soul,
Are vast as the eternal ocean.
O DO NOT BLAME.
O, do not blame the maid who sighs,
And says she cannot love thee;
But seek some other glowing eyes
That may have power to move thee.
The maiden’s heart is not her own,
’Tis his, who may discover
The tender part for him alone,
And he the constant lover.


She is not false, she would not steal—
But tell thee truth in sadness:
But bleeds the wounds that yet may heal;
To yield thee hours of gladness.
0, do not blame the maid who sighs,
And says she cannot love thee;
But seek some other glowing eyes,
That may have power to move thee.
THE OLD PATH.
Old beaten path, I’m glad to meet
Thy dear old face again;
Here oft I ran with restless feet,
And strove with striving men.
’Twas here, a simple guileless boy,
I ranged thy greenest nooks,
With heart alive to every joy,
Among the leaves and brooks.
I’m speaking not of school days now, —
Those days were never mine ;
But underneath this aged bough
I’ve seen past summers shine.
And many a fairy tale the leaves
Have told. They’ll tell no more;
Fond memory owns a sigh that heaves
Around this elfin lore.


Bound here my happiest moments ran
In thoughtless revelry,
Here many a pleasing theme began
That makes thee dear to me.
0 Youth! thou art a glorious time,
With many a vision bold;
The poet in his happiest rhyme
Should die ere he be old.
For if by age his limbs grow weak,
By age ms eyes be dim,
The sights and sounds that ever speak,
Bring but sad tales to him.
This broken bank, I knew it well,
With crumbling rocks beneath,
The hawthorn bush, the briery dell,
Their scented balmy breath.
0 vague enchantment, what is it
That hangs around the simplest things,
Beyond the power of sense or wit,
Or airy thought’s imaginings ?
A blade of grass, a simple stone,
A leaflet falling from a tree,
Call back a thousand memories flown,
That else were lost eternally.
TO GEO. ROBERTSON.
I have been here an hour or so,
Just cooling in the shade,
And looking o’er a verse or two
Thy teeming brain hath made.


Thy words and thoughts go scamping on.
So playful as they run,
Just like healthy boys and girls
Gay dancing in the sun.
I do not like a gloomy strain,
Nor never did, I’m sure;
It is but madness in the brain
That makes the temper sour.
Away with whimpering discontent,
And gloomy sad complaining;
If this should ever be my bent,
Thy friend is in the waning.
Gay Thalia my muse shall be,
If I can reach the lyre,
To waft me o’er the strings for thee,
In ecstacy and fire.
Yet if by chance I heave a sigh,
May it not give thee pain,
Or wake a throb for days gone by,
That ne’er can come again.
When o’er my Pegasus I stride,
Be’t dark or shiny weather,
It is with joy, if not with pride,
We stumble on together.
Come then my muse, again be prude,
Talk not of sense or reason ;
And if the world should call thee rude,
Their words are out of season.
For many a canty freak we’ve had,
Though oft by folly driven,
The world may count the poet mad—
He is a child M heaven.


A PASTORAL.
Broken is the golden chain,
That bound my love and me together,
Blighted is the hopeful strain
We both have sung amongst the heather.
Wealth has won my love from me,
Wealth has won him altogether,
Won him far across the sea,
And left me here amongst the heather.
I cannot rest by night nor day,
I cannot keep my flocks together,
Like the wind they all may stray,
Where they choose in stormy weather.
Wealth has won my love from me,
Wealth has won him altogether,
W on him far across the sea,
And left me here amongst the heather.
“ Lassie dry those tears again,
And keep thy ewes and lambs together,
I’ve won for thee a golden chain—
A chain to he a golden tether.
Wealth shall never more constrain;
Our hopes, our loves, it ne’er shall sever,
I’m safely hack, and shall remain
Amongst our honnie native heather.
I’ve bought for thee a silken gown,
A tassled mantle, gilted feather,
With heather bloom a bridal crown,
I’ll weave to crown thee mine for ever.
Lassie dry those tears again,
lndia’s shores again I’ll never ;
I’m safely back, and shall remain,
Among’st our honnie native heather.
The above lines were suggested by reading one of the tales of
the borders.


AUSTRALIA, OR THE LAND WE LIVE IN.
A PRIZE POEM.
Oh! life is a treasure, and where it is given,
That is the dearest place, nearest to heaven,
"Where the earliest impressions are laid on the heart
So fast, and so firm, that they ne’er can depart;
And though we may travel o’er regions more grand,
Still we must think of our dear native land,
The land we were born in, our dear native land.
But the hand of oppression was lifted so high,
It blighted each hope, and compelled us to fly;
We burst every bond, for we wished to be free,
And fast we came sailing far over the sea—
While fortune proved kind, and she pointed her wand,
And guided us safe to this beautiful land,
The land of Australia, this beautiful land.
In vain might we struggle for language to tell,
The anguish we felt as we waved a farewell;
For many hearts bled as we pushed from the shore,
Hearts that are dead and can greet us no more,
Unless it should be on that heavenly strand
Where now they rejoice.as they sing hand in hand,
To see that we live in this beautiful land.
A beautiful land, indeed it is true,
Her earth’s ever green, and her skies ever blue,
And her sunny clad bosom vast wealth does unfold
The rarest of diamonds, large nuggets of gold—
And rubies and garnets are strewn on the sand,
By the side of the sea in this beautiful land—
The land that we live in, this beautiful land.
Here close to the surface, just under the day
We may see the huge coal peeping out to the day,
Aye ! nearer than this in the broad sunshine,
Lies the pearled rock and the granite so fine—
And the finest of timber waves high at command,
Then who would not live in this beautiful land—
The land that we live in, this beautiful land.


Her hills and her valleys are covered with snow,
The fleeces I mean on the lambkins that grow;
And the finest of cattle are ever well stored,
So that fatness and plenty may crown every board ;
May crown every board where a bumper may stand
Of wine from the grape of this beautiful land, —
The land that we live in, this beautiful land.
Here the sweet breath of freedom is home on the gale,
And merrily sings over mountain and dale,
And the great heart of plenty beats joy in each breast,
And we sing as we feel in this land of the blest;
In this land of the blest we may all understand
That freedom is wealth in this beautiful land—
The land that we live in, this beautiful land.
Here the poor man no longer the tyrant may dread,
Nor groan and yet bear the gilt heel on his head,
Nor dash the big tear from his eyelid that stole
At each touch of the iron which entered his soul;
Grim poverty’s left on the Anglican strand,
And will never I hope see this beautiful land, —
The land that we live in, this beautiful land.
Hfere the poorest are honoured if guided by thought*
No matter how humbly life’s battle be fought ;
From the rich or the great we have nothing to fear,
For equality reigns as a principle here.
Here the rich man has taken the poor by the hand,
And they smile on each other in this beautiful land
The land that we live in, this beautiful land.
Here the poor may come forward—the lowly
aspire,
If they have but a spark of political fire.
Aye! sure there is one whom ’tis useless to name,
Whose head is a furnace, whose tongue is a flame,
Whose words fraught with power, he thunders so
grand
For the rights of the poor in this beautiful land—
The land that we live in—this beautiful land.


Oh! long may God speed him, and fortune prove kind,
And grant him good health and the pleasures of mind I
Long may God speed him to fight on his way,
He’s the bright Morning Star of a happier day;
The mighty winged Herald of a future so grand!
Oh! long may he live in this beautiful land,
The land that we live in, this beautiful land
Bright honour be his for that education,
That excellent boon he prepared for the nation ;
With.right hearty cheering our voices shall rise,
Till an echo shall find its way back from the skies:
’Midst the greatest of heroes he now takes a stand,
He’s the champion of light in this beautiful land,
The land that we live in, this beautiful land.
Sir Henry Farkes is here meant.


BANQUET TO ME. WILLIAM EBAY.
On Saturday evening last a number of the friends of
Mr. William Eeay, artist, assembled at Turner’s
Glanmorgan Hotel, Georgetown, near Waratah, to
entertain him at a complimentary banquet.
The spread was provided in Mr. Tumers’s best style
and served in the large assembly room, which was
tastefully decorated with ferns, flowers, and flags.
About sixty persons did justice to the good things
placed before them.
When the more substantial viands were removed,
the company proceeded to toasting. Mr. Tighe, P. M.
occupied the chair, and Mr Charles Harper filled the
vice-chair.
After the usual loyal toasts were disposed of, the
Vice-chairman proposed “ the Parliament of New
South Wales.” He considered it was a most impor-
tant toast, and should be drunk with full glasses*
As men it behoved them to pay some attention
to the parliament of the country. The question
was a very dry one, some might say, but still it was
an expensive one, and one not conducted without much
trouble, anxiety, and a considerable amount of abuse*
Some people thought very little of their members of
Parliament; but the position of a member was not
one to be much sought after; and to please a con-
stituency like Northumberland was a most difficult
matter. None of the members of the present Parlia-
ment were what might be termed faultless; but, to
read a speech made some few days ago by Mr. Garrett
it would be inferred that the members of Parlia-
ment, with the exception of those who sat on the
Opposition benches, were perfection. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Garrett said that when the Ministers made pro-
mises they always tried to fulfil them; but the com-
pany present knew how much this statement was
worth. He (Mr. Harper) thought that when a


Minister fulfilled a promise it was because be was
forced to do it. However, tbe Parliament, on tbe
whole, was a very good one, and be bad mucb pleasure
in asking tbe company to drink tbe toast.
Tbe Chairman responded. He said ho bad mucb
pleasure in responding to tbe toast of tbe Parliament
of New South Wales. He did not think on festive
occasions of tbe then present time that it was
becoming to findparticular fault with tbe Parliament;
for, if they did so, they found fault with themselves
(Hear, hear.) No person could obtain a seat in
Parliament unless tbe electors put him there ; and if
tbe electors, were careless, indifferent, and corrupt,
tbe Parliament would be like their masters, also care-
less, indifferent, and corrupt. But if tbe Parliament
was composed of high-minded, educated, and well-in-
formed men, it signified that tbe people were in-
clined to take persons of that kind by tbe band.
They should look leniently on tbe shortcomings of
tbe members of Parliament, andascribe to-them what-
ever good was duo to them. Tbe electors of Nor-
thumberland were an intelligent community, and
equal to any other in the country. Tbe men were in
a position to improve their minds ; their hours were
short, and reading instructive works, and studying
a little, formed a very pleasant recreation for them.
He bad had some experience in Parliament,’and from
that judged that tbe best members in local affairs
were tbe worst men in general affairs; and a man who
was able to take a large view of any important ques-
tion was inclined to rely for bis fame on his exertions
in that direction; while tbe narrow-minded man, who
could not deal with tbe matters affecting tbe whole
country, had to attend to roads and bridges
to obtain a good name. (Hear, bear, and laughter).
On tbe whole, be thought there was no great occasion,
to find fault with the present Parliament, and on.
their behalf he returned thanks. (Applause.)


The Ohaiemah then called on Mr. E. B. Theobald
to propose the toast of the evening.
Mr. Theobald said he ■would do so, but instead of
making a speech would read the following lines:—
Mb. Chaebman aitd GEirrLEMEir.—
When sitting in my room a night or two ago
I thought about this meeting, and desired to know
What I should do if I were asked by you to say
A word or two about our friend, the artist Eeay;
Or if, instead of this, I should be called upon
To give some pleasing toast, or to respond to one.
Should I, I asked myself, such great discourtesy show
As to refuse to speak when thus requested ? No!
This might, I thought, the pleasures of the evening
mar.
I, therefore, made resolve that, as I am no star
At making public speeches, I would try to write
My sentiments on paper. These I’ll read to-night,
If you’ll permit me.
First it will, I think, be best
To introduce the name of our much-honored guest —
The artist and the poet—Eeay. You all, like me,
Have known him many years, and feel assured that
he
Is truly worthy of the homage which we pay
To him by thus assembling here to-night. He may
And does, I doubt not, feel of this ovation proud.
I know he ought. Just look around, and see the
crowd
Of friends he has both on his right and left. Well, I
For one am glad to link myself in frienship’s tie
To him —yea, proud that he is on my list of friends,
Where he will always be ’Tis not for selfish ends
That I extend to him a brother’s hand. Oh no!
’Tis something more, as it will easy be to show.
It is for this—in him I very planly see
A royal son of nature’s true nobility.
He may not be o’erstocked with gold; the fickle god
Of wealth may not have touched him with his magic
rod.
But he is rich in things that far transcend all pelf :
Yes, he of b jtter riches has within himself
A mine, of which no one can rob him. All of you
Will testify to this when I explain.
Keview


His life and acts! Do they not show that he’s a man
Who tries to carry out the grand and glorious plan
Of living to obtain a name that will not pass away,
E’en when his frame, so stalwart now, has turned to
clay?
Tes, this he has already done! Have you not seen
The grand productions of his master hand ? I mean
Those life-like portraits, which from time to time
' have come
From his small studio! If you have not—at my
home—
There is a piece of our friend’s handiwork, which I
So highly prize, that no amount of cash would buy
The treasured thing. It is my likeness—done so
well
That ’twould a credit be to Eembrandt or Eaphael.
Which of you here would like this gem to view,
Come to me, and I will show it you.
Ask Mr. Hannell there what his opinion is
About our friend’s artistic skill. I’m sure ’tis this—
That no one better could the lineament pourtray
Of Mrs. Hannell and himself, than did the artist
Eeay
When he their pictures painted some short time ago.
Our guest is not alone a painter; you all know
That he’s a poet too. The muse to him extends
Full of her gentle, fair, and guiding hands, and
lends
To him poetic fire; so that his numbers roll
In such a manner as to charm the reader’s soul.
No doubt that some of you have his production
read;
If so, you’ll own, that I of them, the truth have said,
His best effusions seem to me to take by turns
The serious style of Gray and the mirthful one of
Bums.
But this, my rambling speech, if speech, it can be
named,
Must now have termination; or I shall be blamed
For being tedious? This would make me feel
ashamed.
Before I take my seat, howe’er, I wish to say,
That our guest’s health must—in the customary
way—
Be drunk with cheers (and loud ones too) of three
times three.
But stay! This proposition must not come from
me—
Because, an absent lady has a wish to be
Identified with this grand movement. In my hands,


Last week, she placed a note, and gave me strict
command,
To read it to this meeting. This, at once I’ll do,
With your permission. Then, I’ll leave the cause
with you.
First fill your glasses to the brim, and ready be
To drink Reay’s health, with cheers of three times
three.
By Elizabeth A.
Men of the world! We meet to-day,
To greet our friend, the artist, Reay,
Whose gifted hand is given to trace
The features of our passing race;
And leave to men (we’ve gone before)
The faces that their fathers wore.
’Tis his to show the man, ae now,
The kindly eye—the thoughtful brow ;
And bid each youthful breast aspire—
The son to emulate the sire.
One of the sons of light is he, —
One of divine nobility!
Fame crowns her favourite with bay,
So brothers, drink to William Reay.
(Loud and continued applause.)
The toast was received with cheers.
Mr. Reay in responding, said when he looked
around and saw the many preparations that had been
made, and the many kind friends that had met to do
him honor, he could asure them them that he felt it a
great weight upon him, and his heart began to thump
at his conscious deficiency for that occasion, for he
knew it was not in his power to say how much he felt
for the manifestation of their appreciation of him.
It was not possible to confer a greater honor on any
one than by a public demonstration of good will to-
wards him. From his infancy it had been his fate to
be placed in the most adverse circumstances relative
to art, yet surely he had succeeded in something when


men of intelligence, learning, position, and honor
had met there to compliment him on that occasion,
and who had chosen to do so boldly and with such
open means. It was something more than he really
could ever have expected, and the majority then pre-
sent had met him in all shades of his career. A love
of art was a naturaTinstinct with him (hear, hear), a
fire that nothing could ever extinguish. He had
struggled often with an anxious heart, but the then
present occasion repaid him for all. He felt that to
be the grand epoch of his life, and for the future, if it
were possible, he should be more earnest as an artist
more faithful as a friend, and more benevolent as a
Christian, and he hoped that all his future life should
be found worthy of the present moment. (Loud and
prolonged applause).
Mr. William Thomas, of Lambton, then sang some
original lines, dedicated to Mr. Eeay, which - were
received with applause.
The Chairman then proposed, “ The Army, Navy,
andYolunteers,” to which Mr. Dawson and Mr. Baker
responded.
The Vice-Chairman proposed, “The Coal Trade,”
and said as one belonging to the homey-handed sons
of toil, he felt very great pleasure at the present state
of the coal trade. The work was now satisfactory to
the miners, and profitable to the colliery proprietors,
and he hoped it would long continue so (Applause).
Mr. John Wood, the miner’s secretary, responded >
He said, as the representative of the miners, he had
very great pleasure in responding, and was greatly
pleased at the present state of the country, as regards
its coal-mines. The coal trade was certainly one of
the greatest supports of a country. Agriculture
might be all very well, but it was manufacture that
infused life and prosperity into every country, and


■without coal the manufactories would be in a rather
pinched condition. He was proud of the good feel-
ing existing in the country between capital and
labour, and hoped it would long continue (hear, hear),
The Chairman proposed, “-The Land we live in.”
Mr. Tates responded. He was not a native, hut
had been in the country a good many years, and
Could speak highly of the many good qualities it
possessed.
The Vice-Chairman proposed, “The Ladies.”
Mr. S. Browne responded.
The following toasts were then disposed of:—
* ‘ Trade and Commerce, ’ ’ responded to by Mr. Dainty ;
Municipal Bodies,” responded to by Mr. Abel,
Mayor of Lambton; “Friendly Societies,” responded
to by Mr. Dent ; “ The Visitors” responded to by Mr.
F. W. Eeay; “ The Press,” responded to by repre-
sentatives of the Newcastle Daily Pilot , Newcastle
Chronicle, and Miners Advocate; “The Host and
Hostess,” responded to by Mr. Turner.
This being the last toast, the company began to
take their leave, evidently highly pleased with the.
night’s proceedings. We may add that the whole Of,
the speeches were highly complimentary to the
character of Mr. Eeay, both as an artist and poet*
and we regret that our limited space will not allow-
us to give them in full. Several excellent songs and
recitations were given during the evening, which
enlivened the proceedings; one, by a local bard, who
has received several prizes for poetical effusions.


We publish the following verses, which were com-
posed and sung by Mr. William Thomas, of Lambton,
at the banquet given in honour of Mr. W. Beay:—
My dearest friend, Willie Beay,
I congratulate thee at heart,
My friend as a master of art;
To meet thee at present and able to say
A master most truly thou art;
For thou has achieved in thy race,
And hence to posterity thou doth impart
Some treasures of beauty and grace.
Thy genius has always been bright:
It bloomed in thy youth like a rose;
Thy glory matures from childhood’s delight,
Still brighter grows on to the close.
Climb up to thy “ Castle of fame”*
Which stands on the hill of renown,
Hang thither thy paintings to foster thy name,
That ages may not crumble down.
The lines of thy paintings are such
That artists may willingly bow;
Thine hand thou hast taught to the finishing touch
That gives animation and glow.
Oh! Willie, thy genius is grand,
Thou art a predensor of grace;
The grandest of grandeurs comes under thine hand,
In character, body, and face.
Oh! Willie, my own brother bard,
A poet of Nature, I say;
Let life and its duty be easy or hard,
Thou singest the night as the day;
Thy musings are various and grand,
They roam from the heath to the glen;
And curious the objects from many a land,
Which thou hast subdued to thy pen.
The artist and poet in one,
Arise like the sun of the day;
Thy duties of honor may thou never shun,
But prosper, my friend, Willie Beay;
Thy sons and thy daughters may grow
To circles of honor and wealth;
And long may thy Jeannie continue to glow
The roses to shame with her health.f
* A poem of that name written by Mr. Beay.
tAn allusion to a song by Mr. Beay—“ Jeannie ahame* the
roeee.”
Note. — It may be asked why I have inserted the Banquet
in my book. My answer is this—lt contains the poetry of
my mends, and the poetry of friendship.


LINES TO WILLIAM REAT.
My locks were as black as the wing of a raven,
But, alas! they changed colour for that of Jmre
white;
The rose-blush has left me, and valour is taken,
And lonely 1 muse in the darkness of night.
Fortune has hidden the portion I’m claiming,
And left me with nothing to foster old age:
In my harvest and sunshine I went not out gleaning,
And life’s storm threatens to come in a rage.
Where is my friend poet whose poems are a treasure,
And as sweet as the notes of the birds on a spray;
In artistic genius Calliope filled his measure,
And called her son William, and afterwards —Eeay
Is the Artist yet painting the wings of Pegasus,
And cannot find leisure to wander this way ?
Or is he still musing on the fair morning goddess,
Whose rosy hand opens the doors of the day ?
Has he done painting Venus ascending
The grand arch of heaven on her golden cloud;
Or can he be dreaming the Deity’s descending
To the isle where Ulysses sweet Calliope found.
P. H. MARKHAM.
Cook’s Hill, Newcastle, June 29th, 1884.
POET-PAINTER REAY.
’Twas yestereve, at twilight tide,
When work was put away,
I wandered o’er the Wallaby
With Poet-Painter Eeay.
We strolled along in happy mood,
With ne’er a care to stay,
For my thoughts took their tone from him
From Poet-Painter Eeay.


And his4o» were full of poesy,
At that calm hour of day,
Full of the thoughts which nature brings .
To those that love as Eeay ;
To those that love to muse upon,
And ’mid her charms to stay,
And drink from her poetic springs,
like Poet-Painter Eeay.
He breathed within mine ear such strains
That steal the soul away,
To mingle with the joys he loves,
Did Poet-Painter Eeay;
The joys that gladden hearts refined,
As beams round flowers play,
And warm them as poetic zeal
Warms Poet-Painter Eeay.
The sun’s last beam of fading light
Fell o’er the bush-land grey,
And stole into my inmost soul,
While musing there with Eeay;
And Evening sighed through each dim aisle
■ Her meditative lay,
Which breathing low I listened to
With Poet-Pamter Eeay.

Glebe, 1880.
ANABEL BEAT.
Oh. sweet is the smile of fair Anabel Eeay,
Aye sweet as the breath of the newborn day!
So handsome, so winsome, so modest, yet gay;
She’s gem of rare beauty,
My Anabel Eeay.
I’ve seen Austral’s roses o’erlustered with dew,
Fringed daises with colours of radiant hue,
Sweet myrtle and orange in blossomed array;
But sweeter than all
Is sweet Anabel Eeay.


How bright are the eyes of my Anabel Eeay,
Her lips like the coral kissed by Ocean’s spray.
Her cheeks—the peach blossoms that summer array
Pale in the bright presence
Of Anabel Eeay.
Why tell me of Fairies, that wandered of old
Through landscapes resplendent in purple and gold ?
It may be their forms were fairer than day,
Yet how wanting in soul,
By my Anabel Eeay.
Tho’ a sunbeam in beauty my Anabel Eeay,
Fixed star in her duty is Anabel Eeay,
Now strike the sweet lyre fairy, woodnymph and fay,
To the sweet maiden graces
Of Anabel Eeay.

THE THISTLE DOWN.
1.
Thistle down, thistle down,
Come here and rest down;
Why wander about in the breeze?
’Tis useless to roam
In search of thy home;
Thy home’s far away cross the seas—
- Thistle down.
Thy home’s far away cross the seas.
2.
Thou light airy thing,
,On soft downy wing,
I greet thee this hot summer day;
While thee I’m so nigh,
I heave a deep sigh
For a land that is far, far away—
Thistle down—
For a land that is far, far away.


3,
Thy bright top and leaf
Adorned many a chief,
As he rushed over mountain and glen.
To the dark fields of Flodden
Or gory Culloden; —
He marched forth the bravest of men—
Thistle down —
He marched forth the bravest of men.
4.
But the day now is past
When thy beauty could cast
It’s magic o’er forest and field,
And the heroes so brave
Axe all in the grave;
Those heroes who never could yield.
Thistle down—
Those heroes who never could yield.
THAT MAY MORNING.
1.
The dew was on the grass,
And the bird was on the wing,
When I met a honnie lass,
That May morning-.
She came across the lawn,
As sportive as a fawn,
And rosier than the dawn,
That May morning.


2.
The flowers were all perfume,
As prodigal of spring,
But my lassie did illume
That May morning.
Her beauty fell in showers
Upon the blushing flowers,
And lit the happy hours,
That May morning.
3.
That mom has vanished far
But I never can forget!
’Tis like a golden star
That rose but never set.
It glitters o’er my way,
Where’er I chance to stray,
And glads my heart to-day,
