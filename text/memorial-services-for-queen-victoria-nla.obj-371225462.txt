FUNERAL OF HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA,
FEBRUARY
2nd, 1901.
UNITED PEOPLE’S MEMORIAL SERVICE.
ORDER OF SERVICE.
. I.
1 Brief life is here our portion ;
Brief sorrow, short-lived care ;
The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life, is there :
0 happy retribution !
Short toil, eternal rest;
For mortals and for sinners,
A mansion with the blest!
2 There grief is turned to pleasure,
Such pleasure, as below
No human voice can utter,
No human heart can know :
And now we fight the battle,
But then shall wear the crown
Of full and everlasting
And passionless renown.
4 ’Midst power that knows no limit,
And wisdom free from bound,
The beatific vision
Shall glad the saints around.
For He Whom now we trust in
Shall then be seen and known .
And they that know and see Him
Shall have Him for their own.
in.
1 Days and moments quickly flying,
Blend the living with the dead ;
Soon will you and I be lying,
Each within his narrow bed.
2 Soon our souls to God who gave them
Will have spread their rapid flight;
Able now by grace to save them,
Oh, that while we can we might!
3 Jesus, Infinite Redeemer,
,Maker of this mortal frame,
Tea n h, 0 teach us to remember
What we are and whence we came ;
4 Whence we came, and whither wending ;
Soon we must through darkness go,
To inherit life unending,
Or the death of shame and woe.
5 Life passeth soon ; death draweth near :
Keep us, good Lord, till Thou appear ;
For Thee to live, in Thee to die,
With Thee to reign through eternity.
ADDRESS.
6 Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and
ours ?
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.
7 It is enough : earth’s struggles soon shall
cease,
And Jesus calls us to heaven’s perfect peace.
LESSON-I. Cor. xv.
PRAYER.
V.
1 My God, my Father, while I stray
Far from my home, on life’s rough way,
0 teach me from my heart to say,
“ Thy will be done !”
2 Though dark my path and sad my lot,
Let me “ be still,” and murmur not,
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
“ Thy will be done !”
3 If ihou shouldst call me to resign
What most I prized,—it ne’er was mine ;
1 only yield Thee what was Thine :
“ Thy will be done 1”
4 Let but my fainting heart be blest
With Thv sweat Spirit for its guest,
My God, to Thee I leave the rest:
“ Thy will be done I”
5 Renew my will from day to day ; ;
Blend it with Thine ; and take away
All that now makes it hard to say,
“ Thy will be done !”
6 Then, when on earth I breathe no more,
The prayer oft mixed with tears before,
I’ll sing upon a happier shoi e, —
“ Thy will be done !”

VI.
1 Nearer, My God to Thee —
Nearer to Thee,
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me ;
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee—
Nearer to Thee.
2 Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone ;
Yet in my dreams, I’d be
Nearer, my God, to Thee —
Nearer to Thee.
3 There let the way appear,
Steps unto heaven ;
All that Thou send'st to me
In mercy given ;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee —
Nearer to Thee.
4 Then with my waking thoughts,
Bright with Thy praise.
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I’ll raise,
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee —
Nearer to Thee.
5 Or if on joyful wing,
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards 1 fly,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee —
Nearer to Thee.
6 There in my Father’s house
Safe and at rest ;
There in my Saviour’s love
Perfectly blest.
Age after age, to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee —
Nearer to Thee.
SHORT PRAYER.
II.
1 When our heads are bowed with woe,
When our bitter tears o’erflow ;
When we mourn the lost, the dear,
Jesu, Son of Mary, hear !
2 When the heart is said within
With the thought of all its sin ;
When the spirit shrinks with fear,
Jesu, Son of Mary, hear 1 •
3 Thou the shame, the grief, hast known,
Though the sins were not Tlfine own ; ! -
Thou has deign d their load to bear :
Jesu, Son of Mary, hsar !
IV.
1 Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin ?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
2 Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties
pressed ?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.
3 Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging
round ?
On Jesus’ bosom nought but calm is found.
4 Peace, nerfect peace, with loved ones far
away ?
1 In Jesus’ keeping we are safe, and they.
5 Peace, perfect peace, our future all un-
known 1 ■
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
