It seems worth recalling’the fact that
in the spring 1096, exactly 800 years
ago, took place the first Crusade, that
magnificent mania of faith and fanaticism
which aroused Europe by a great re-
ligious impulse to stem the course of the
followers of the false prophet Mahomet
in the East.
For the first time in its history, the
Colorado gold output is in excess of its
silver production. Nearly all the gold
came from the vicinity of Cripple Creek.
Colorado, however, is still foremost as a
silver State. The output of gold last
year was 17,340,955 dollars ; of silver,
14,259,049 dollars.
In the island of Barbadoe is a district
with quaintly shaped hills called Scot-
land.

Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the good result of your
corn and bunion treatment without cutting. The cure in my case was a painless and
thorough one, and lam now no longer a walking barometer. Your treatment of the
bunion (a regular fiend of ten years’ standing) was an undoubted success. It is some
nine months since you attended me, and I can safely say I have never suffered
inconvenience with my feet since. Wishing you every success, I remain, dear sir, youra

A pious old lady recently sent as a sil-
ver-wedding present, a pair of flat-irons,
a rolling-pin, and a motto worked on card-
board, reading, “ Fight on.”
The other day a lady was asked by
gome little girls to come and look at a
bridal-party of dolls, at whose toilette
they had been assisting. On viewing the
pretty gathering, she ventured to inquire,
“ But where is the bridegroom ?” “ Oh,
we don’t want any men !” was the prompt
reply.
One of the most remarkable exports of
the Gold Coast, is that of monkey skins.
During the last five years, an average of
175,000 skins havebeen annually exported.
In the London and Paris of a century
ago numbered bouses did not exist. The

sign-hoard were the only indications to
guide our ancestors’ wandering feet by-

Many people believe,with Byron, that
trees feel the vicissitudes of those who
plant them, and often wither and die with
the failing powers of human life.
Justice: “ Call the next case, bailiff.”
Bailiff: “ The next case, yer honour, is a
case o’liquor.” Justice: “Let the case

the liquor we’ve been havin’ around here,
I’ll fine the whole business for contempt
o’ court an’ adjourn till Sunday.”
For a long time after he had succeeded
in inserting himself through the door at
3 a.m., she regarded him in silence. At

length.
“There’s only one thing the Armless
Wonder can’t do with his feet,” said the
showman. “ What’s that ?” asked a spec-
tator. “ Put on his gloves!” answered
the showman.
“Your daughter has a remarkably
pretty foot, Mrs. Snaggs,” said Mrs.
Bloomfield to her friend. “ Indeed she
has,” replied the grateful mother, “and
I have decided to let some sculptor make
a bust of it.”

happy father was told to “ cover them
carefully with straw and set fire to them,
and the little pests, after jumping about

speedily settled while the victim of the
grasshoppers was advised to give a little
castor oil, and rub their gums gently with
a bone.”

the prescription for invalids is very often simply
good Colonial Port Wine, Coolalta if possible,
for Wilkinson’s Coolalta Wines are un-
doubtedly the finest on the market.
