Collective Edition of Lord Chesterfield's Letters. 475
Chesterfield?s patronage of the Roman Catholics (such as
hat was ?a much nearer approach to patronage, at all events, than
hey ha'i experienced since 1688) had its root, partly at least, in
Ins general indifference to religion; but on that subject we shall
tay sc thing by-and-bye. Meantime he condensed much wis-
iom into his parting sentence to the Bishop of Waterford?-? Be
nore afraid of Poverty than of the Pope.'
Chesterfield resigned the seals in 1748 ?and whoever was the
fienman of the once celebrated tract entitled ? An Apology for
i late Resignation,? we have no doubt that it states truly the
grounds of his retirement?namely, his aversion to the war and
.ns resentment of his cousin Newcastle?s interference with the
piopei pationage of his office. That he at the time meant his
(retirement to be final, Lord Mahon seems to believe fully?but
iheie we cannot agree with the editor. We consider it much
more probable that he would have been very willing to take
office again?upon the great changes produced by the death of
Pelham especially?but for the sad, to him of all men the
most grievous, infirmity of deafness, which?within but a few
years after 1748 ?though it might not materially interfere with
his efficiency as a parliamentary orator,* must have unfitted him
P vp watching and participating in the tide of debate, as would
have been expected from an official leader in the House of
ords. As to the authorship of the ?Apology,? Coxe, on the
dhority of Bishop Douglas, ascribes it to Mallet (Life of Lord
dpole, vol. ii. p. 206). Lord Mahon (vol. iii. p. 254) does
ofe allude to this claim, but seems to attach more weight to a
letter of Horace Walpole to Sir H. Mann (December, 1748),
where the pamphlet is given to Lord Marchmont, who, Horace
*dds, had nearly lost his own place in consequence. To this
iece of evidence we can oppose the opinion of Horace Walpole
himself at a later date ; for in his ? Memoiresof George ll.? he ex-
pressly calls it ? Chesterfield?s book??and, moreover, we have now
before us the copy of the ?Apology? sold at the Strawberry Hill
auction, and on its title-page in Horace?s autograph are these
words??Lord f" ''sterfield?s.? It is possible, however, that Lord
Mahoi liance on Chesterfield?s own disclaimer at
the time to m ff.es, viz., ? Upon my word and honour, so
far am I from n= - r ing any hand directly or indirectly in it, that I
do not so much as guess the author, though I have done all I
could to fish him out? (April 8, 1748). But, in the first place,
the very formality and solemnity of this declaimer, addressed to his
* Even Horace Walpole admits to Mann, in December, 1743, that the finest speech
he ever heard was one of Chesterfield's. Horace had heard, when he wrote this, his
own father, and Pulteney, and Carteret, and Wyndham, and Mansfield, and Chatham.
VOL. Lxxvl, no. CLII. 2 K intimate


intimate friend the Resident at the Hague, would to us have seemed
very suspicious : for it is clear, from not a few passages (novo first
published) in his correspondence with this very gentleman, that
Chesterfield had no faith in the Post-ofiice. He says to Dayrolles
shortly before his resignation (January, 1748), ?Write to me from
time to time as usual?but remember I shall be no longer master
of the post ?therefore let no letter that comes by it contain any-
thing but what will bear an opening previous to mine? (vol. iii. p.
238) : and in April, after he had resigned, he says, ? Don?t send
me the name in a letter by the post, for I know that most letters
to and from me are opened? (ibid., p. 257). We put Chester-
field?s denial to Dayrolles, in a word, on the same foot with Swift?s
denial of his concern in Gulliver to Pope and Arbuthnot, and
account for it in the same way. Secondly, it is impossible to
read the pamphlet and believe that Lord Chesterfield read it
without a suspicion who wrote it. It could have come from no
man but one intimately conversant with the interior state of the
cabinet, and with the secret occurrences of Chesterfield?s own
vexed career as Secretary. We have no doubt the pamphlet was
dictated by Chesterfield, and think it most likely that Mallet,
not Marchmont, held the pen. Some few inelegancies in the
language are probably marks of Mallet?s hand?but these, and
even certain inflated compliments to Lord Chesterfield?s wit, may
have been studiously introduced by the master himself?parts of
his blind.
On his resignation George 11. offered him a Dukedom; but
Chesterfield, whom so many think of as a perfect peacock of
vanity, declined that distinction. He did not approve of Lord
Johns and Lord Charleses.
During his brief tenure of the seals as Secretary occurred
that address and dedication to him of the plan or prospectus
of the English Dictionary with which Boswell?s narrative still con-
nects in the popular mind impressions bitterly adverse and (we
think) quite unjust to Lord Chesterfield. We fancy few take
the trouble to reflect on the actual positions of the Earl and
Johnson in November, 1747. Samuel Johnson was anno cetat. 38,
not our and Boswell's Dr. Johnson. Boswell himself never saw
him till sixteen years later. Visiting London in 1760 he had a
glimpse of a chance through?Derrick the Poet, but that failed.
In 1761 he had another glimpse through?Sheridan the elocu-
tionist, but that failed. In May, 1763, his hopes were crowned?
by an introduction in the back shop of Tom Davies ! But what
had excited even Boswell?s nervous curiosity even in 1760? ?
Between 1747 and then Johnson had shot up to a giant. In
1747 he had published nothing that we now value him for
except


except his ? London and his Life of Savage. By 1760 he
was the Doctor, the author of the Rambler and the Adven-
turer, of Rasselas, and of the Dictionary, &c. &c.; and even
then we see what were the sort of channels through which a
gentleman of birth, fortune, and talents, an enthusiastic admirer
of his works, twice failed, and ultimately succeeded, in getting
access to his society. In 1747 Chesterfield was fifty-three, and
Secretary of State. Johnson?s good friend Dodsley, the book-
seller, suggested that it would be well to address the plan to
the brilliant and literary minister?but Dodsley had no acquaint-
ance with my lord, and Johnson waited on him in person with his
prospectus, whereupon he had patched sundry elaborate eulogies
of the patron in fore ?phrases most magniloquent, which he must
have concocted with some twinges of conscience, as Chesterfield,
though a scholar and a wit, was at least as well known as a
gambler, a voluptuary, an infidel?and a whig. We need not re-
peat the immortalized grievances of his alleged reception?he had
the Secretary?s approval of the plan, but what his friend Tyers
calls the ( substantial proofs of approbation,? were limited to one
donation of ten guineas?and Samuel Johnson, beside being
actually kept waiting one day for some time in the Secretary?s
antechamber, had the mortification to see Collev Cibber come out
' %/
as he was invited to walk in. Kept waiting! ?Samuel Johnson
had not had much experience of Whitehall. Only ten guineas !
He had received no more for his f London??he got but fifteen
in 1748 for his ? Vanity of Lluman Wishes.? f Sir,? said he to
Boswell in reference to another yet later payment ?? Ten pounds
were to me at that time a great sum.?
Boswell could not deny that when, after an interval of eight
years, Johnson?s Dictionary was at last published. Chesterfield
recommended it promptly and efficaciously by two papers in f The
World??but he calls this f a courtly device ? to cover the f neglect?
of the intervening years, and ascribes Johnson?s famous letter to
indignation mainly at this f courtly device.? Lmprimis, the plan
or prospectus was admirably written, but still it was only a plan.
Its writer was known to Chesterfield merely as a clever Grub-
street author?the companion of the Savages?the hack of Cave
and Dodsley. How could he be sure that the plan would ever
bo executed ? Are either Earls as Earls, or Earls as Secretaries
of State, expected now?were they really expected then?to pro-
vide ?substantially? for the support of any stranger who an-
nounces a great literary work while he shall be composing the
work?a work which possibly he may have no serious intention
to compose ?a work which very possibly he may never be able to
complete (for the cleverest do not always calculate exactly the
2 k 2 quid


quid valeant humeri ) ?a work, finally, which if composed and com-
pleted well, is sure to turn out highly profitable to somebody?
but not assuredly to the Earl or the Secretary ? Secundo, notwith-
standing Johnson?s sonorous puffs of the Earl?s taste and genius, his
plan was without question addressed to the Earl because he was
the Secretary. Now he ceased to be the Secretary very soon after
the plan was submitted to him?in about four months after that
awful waiting in the salle des pas perdus ; and might he not be ex-
cused if he put the same construction on the puffs that we do, and
considered that if the announced lexicon was really entitled to
? substantial ? encouragement throughout the various stages of its
embryo progress, the author (or rather the publishing undertakers)
ought to look not to Philip Earl of Chesterfield, but to whoever
succeeded him as His Majesty?s Secretary of State ? But tertio ?
Chesterfield retired from office in April, 1748 ?probably before
Johnson had penned de facto one page of the Dictionary first
announced in November, 1747 ?and during the years that passed
between the presentation of the plan and the publication of the
book, w'as the Earl?as a private nobleman ?so situated as to have
made it likely that he would seek after the private acquaintance of
a literary man fifteen years his junior, and known to none of his
friends?or. If Boswell falls back on the mere furthering of the ap-
proved Prospectus, were Johnson?s own public proceedings during
the interval such as would naturally inspire confidence in his in-
dustrious prosecution of the gigantic labour of the programmed
Dictionary ? As to Johnson, we have already mentioned that
during those eight years he was before the world as author of an
uninterrupted series of important writings, none of them in any
way connected with the Dictionary; some of them (? Rasselas ?
and the ?lmitation of Juvenal? especially) such as a man like
Chesterfield might naturally enough think little likely to proceed
from a diligent lexicographer?s desk ; each of them and all in their
sequence and patent results such as must be supposed to operate
largely for the pecuniary benefit of the author, and the encourage-
ment of his booksellers as to whatever else he might have in hand.
But what was the bodily condition of Lord Chesterfield during
these eight years w hen Johnson was keeping himself before the
world as novelist, biographer, essayist, and poet, though all the
while guiding, directing, and animating the corps of humble
scribes associated with him in the unseen toils of the Dictionary ?
One w'ould have thought that everybody must have read at least
Voltaire?s tale, ? Les Oreilles du Comte de Chesterfield.? Mr.
Croker says :
? Why was it to be expected that Lord Chesterfield should cultivate
Johnson?s private acquaintance?? That he did not do so was a loss to
his


his lordship; and the amour propre of Johnson might be (as, indeed,
it probably was) offended at that neglect, but surely it was no ground
for the kind of charge which is made against his lordship.
? The neglect lasted, it is charged, from 1748 to 1755 : the following
extracts of his private letters to his most intimate friends will prove
that during that period Lord Chesterfield may be excused for not culti-
vating Johnson?s society;?
* 20th January, 1749.?? My old disorder in my head hindered me
from acknowledging your former letters.?
? 30th June, 1752. ?? lam here in my hermitage, very deaf, and
consequently alone ; but lam less dejected than most people in my situ-
ation would be.?
? Hth Nov. 1752. ? 44 The waters have done my head some gojd, lut
not enough to refit me for social life.?
4 16th Feb. 1753. ? 44 I grow deafer, and consequently more ?jsoZc?
from society every day.?
4 10th Oct. 1753. ? 44 1 belong no more to social life , which, when I
quitted busy public life, I flattered myself would be the comfort of my
declining age.?
4 16th Nov. 1 753. ? 44 1 give up all hopes of cure. I know my place,
and form my plan accordingly, for I strike society out of it.?
4 7th Feb. 1754. ? 44 At my age , and with my shattered constitution ,
freedom from pain is the best I can expect.?
4 Ist March, 1754. ? 44 I am too much i sole , too much secluded
either from the busy or the beau monde, to give you any account of
either.?
4 25th Sept. 1754. ? 44 In truth, all the infirmities of an age still more
advanced than mine crowd upon me. In this situation you will easily
suppose that I have no pleasant hours.?
4 10th July, 1755. ? 44 My deafness is extremely increased, and daily
increasing, and cuts me wholly ojf from the society of others , and my
other complaints deny me the society of myself.?
4 Johnson, perhaps, knew nothing of all this, and imagined that Lord
Chesterfield declined his acquaintance on some opinion derogatory to his
personal pretensions.?? Croker's Boswell , vol. i. p. 245.
Boswell?s editor has been equally successful in clearing up
the history of the famous Letter itself. Chesterfield showed it
at the time to some of his friends?nay, kept it openly on his
table, and took a pleasure, as it seemed to them (though Boswell
considers this another 4 courtly device ?), in pointing out the skil-
fulness of some of its vituperative turns and phrases. Johnson,
on the other hand, to his credit be it said, seems to have re-
pented of his violence very soon after it was committed. He
never made a show of the letter. Importunate curiosity and
adulation, and the Doctor?s own authorly vanity, induced him
near twenty years afterwards to give Bozzy a copy?but he gave
it under the strictest injunctions of secrecy, and when subse-
quently


quently urged by the rhinoceros-skinned recipient to withhold
no longer such a masterpiece from the gaze of the world, he
sternly refused, saying f I have done the dog too much mischiel
already.?
Nothing but the inveterate mania of toadyism and lionizing
could have made a gentleman born like Boswell adopt the notion
that men of literary or scientific eminence have a right, merely
as such, to be cultivated as private acquaintance by either Secre-
taries of State or Earls of Chesterfield ; ?that they or their friends
for them should ever condescend to complain of what Boswell in
this story over and over calls ? neglect,? is to our view most melan-
choly and most degrading. We must add, whatever were
Chesterfield?s faults, he had none of those which Boswell on
this occasion ascribes to him?and which Boswell w'ould have
been the last to say a word about, had there still been any
chance of an invitation to Chesterfield House or Blackheath ?
the faults which do often keep men of high rank aloof from the
society of persons inferior to them only in worldly station, and
consequently in the minora moralia of manner and address.
We need not repeat what has been said a thousand times, that
his dwelling so pertinaciously on external trifles in the letters
to his son was the consequence merely of the son?s peculiar
position and defects. In his own person the Earl was a most
polished, but yet by no means a fastidious man. He could keep
company with a set of Irish squireens just as pleasantly as with
the elite of St. James?s or Versailles. For he was a student of
man ?human manners were his special life-long study ?and no
man ever did study manners with true delight and diligence who
had the misfortune to be emasculated by over-nicety. Johnson?s
mere manners were certainly in general bad enough: but still
Johnson, a lover of w r it, had no objection to a lord. Boswell
once dined with him at a duke?s table, and candidly allows that
he never saw him so courteous or more brilliant. On the whole,
therefore, we think it probable that if any such common friend
as Topham Beauclerk, or Wyndham, had brought them together
in after days, we should have had the record of another scene as
edifying as the one when John Wilkes squeezed the lemon on
the Doctor?s roast veal, and gave him a bit more of the kidney.
In that case even Chesterfield?s infirmity could hardly have been
an obstacle ?for surely, if ever voice was deafness-proof, it was
Samuel Johnson?s.
We have already alluded to Walpole?s f Memoires of the Last
Years of George IL? as decisive of his ultimate opinion as to
the substantial authorship of the ? Apology? of 1748. As the
passage had escaped Lord Mahon?s recollection, and as it is per-
haps


haps the very chef- d'oeuvre of Horace Walpole?s cold deliberate
malice,, we may as well pause to extract it from the huge quarto
in which it as yet lies entombed. It is Horace?s resume, on
having to state that the alteration of the style in 1752 was adopted
on the motion of Lord Chesterfield ?the Government shrinking
from such a proposal as likely to disturb the prejudices of the old
women.
?February, 1751.?Lord Chesterfield brought a bill into the House
of Lords for reforming our style according to the Gregorian account,
which had not yet been admitted in England, as if it were matter of
heresy to receive a calendar amended by a pope. He had made no
noise since he gave up the seals in 1748, when he published his
Apology for that resignation. It was supposed to be drawn up by
Lord Marchmont, under his direction, and was very well written; but
to my Lord Chesterfield?s great surprise, neither his book nor his retire-
ment produced the least consequence. From that time he had lived at
White?s, gaming, and pronouncing witticisms among the boys of quality.
He had early in his life announced his claim to wit, and the women
believed in it. He had besides given himself out for a man of great
intrigue, with as slender pretensions ; yet the women believed in that
too ?one should have thought they had been more competent judges of
merit in that particular! It was not his fault if he had not wit; no-
thing exceeded his efforts in that point; and though they were far from
producing the wit, they at least amply yielded the applause he aimed
at. He was so accustomed to see people laugh at the most trifling
things he said, that he would be disappointed at finding nobody smile
before they knew what he was going to say. His speeches were fine,
but as much laboured as his extempore sayings. His writings were
? everybody?s : that is, whatever came out good was given to him, and he
was too humble ever to refuse the gift. ..... In short, my Lord
Chesterfield?s being the instrument to introduce this new era into our
computation of time will probably preserve his name in almanacs and
chronologies, when the wit that he had but laboured too much, and the
gallantry that he could scarce ever execute, will be no more remem-
bered.? ? Memoires , vol. i. pp. 44-46.
To balance this Strawberry-hill view of Chesterfield we con-
sider it as only fair to subjoin the same ?noble author?s? cha-
racter of Dr. Johnson, from the newly published and closing
volumes of his ?Memoirs of the First Ten Years of George
Hl.?:
? With a lumber of learning and some strong parts, Johnson was an
odious and mean character?by principle a Jacobite, arrogant, self-suffi-
cient, and overbearing by nature, ungrateful through pride, and oi femi-
nine bigotry. His manners were sordid, supercilious, and brutal, his
style ridiculously bombastic and vicious; and in one word, with all the
pedantry he had all the gigantic littleness of a country schoolmaster. ?
vol. iv. p. 297.
When


When Chesterfield was dead, and the letters to his son pub-
lished, Johnson, as everybody knows, said they taught the morals
of a strumpet and the manners of a dancing-master? but he sub-
sequently admitted that ' a very pretty book? might be picked out
of them. In our younger days we remember a little book com-
piled in consequence probably of the Doctor?s hint?and if, as we
believe, it has fallen out of print, it is a pity that this should be so.
Ihe remarks on punctuality, order, despatch, the proper use of
time?on the cheapness and vast value of civility to servants and
other inferiors?and so forth?all these are instinct with most
consummate good sense and knowledge of life and business, and
certainly nothing can be more attractive than the style in which
they are set before young readers. Lord Mahon says :
? It is by these letters that Chesterfield?s character as an author must
stand or fall. Viewed as compositions, they appear almost unrivalled
as models for a serious epistolary style ; clear, elegant, and terse, never
straining at effect, and yet never hurried into carelessness. While con-
stantly urging the same topics, so great is their variety of argument and
illustration, that, in one sense, they appear always different, in another
sense, always the same. They have, however, incurred strong repre-
hension on two separate grounds: first, because some of their maxims
are repugnant to good morals; and, secondly, as insisting too much on
manners and graces, instead of more solid acquirements. On the first
charge I have no defence to offer; but the second is certainly erroneous,
and arises only from the idea and expectation of finding a general
system of education in letters that were intended solely for the improve-
ment of one man. Young Stanhope was sufficiently inclined to study,
and imbued with knowledge; the difficulty lay in his awkward address
and indifference to pleasing. It is against these faults, therefore, and
these faults only, that Chesterfield points his battery of eloquence. Had
he found his son, on the contrary, a graceful but superficial trifler, his
letters would no doubt have urged with equal zeal how vain are all
accomplishments when not supported by sterling information. In one
word, he intended to write for Mr. Philip Stanhope, and not for any
other person. And yet, even after this great deduction from general
utility, it was still the opinion of a most eminent man, no friend of
Chesterfield, and no proficient in the graces ?the opinion of Dr, Johnson,
? Take out the immorality, and the book should be put into the hands of
every young gentleman.? ? ? Preface , pp. xviii.-xix.
These letters were addressed to a natural son?and that cir-
cumstance should be constantly kept in mind; it is needful to
explain many things that are said, and the only apology for many
omissions ; but at the same time we must say that if any circum-
stance could aggravate the culpability of a father?s calmly and
strenuously inculcating on his son the duties of seduction and in-
trigue, it is the fact of that son?s unfortunate position in the
world


world being the result of that father?s own transgression. And
when one reflects on the mature age and latterly enfeebled health
of the careful unwearied preacher of such a code, the effect is
truly most disgusting; which feeling is not diminished by our
reading, in the original preface of Mrs. Eugenia Stanhope, that
Lord Chesterfield was ? ever anxious to fix in his son a scrupulous
adherence to the strictest morality ? ?that it was * his first and
most indispensable object to lay a firm foundation in good prin-
ciples and sound religion?after which it is hardly worth while
to quote Chesterfield?s own occasional injunctions, such as f your
moral character must be not only pure, but, like Caesar?s wife, un-
suspected?the least blemish or speck on it is fatal;? ?or to notice
the dead silence, from first to last, as to religion, unless we must
except a passage where the Old Testament is mentioned as one
of the books needful for giving ? some notion of history??or the
many enthusiastic eulogies of Voltaire, amidst which not one
syllable is ever whispered as to the infidel tendency of all the
writings of f the first of poeis??though some caution against infidel
talk in society is once introduced?on the sole ground of its not
being universally acceptable.
We give Lord Chesterfield full credit for his parental zeal
and anxiety : in this respect he was very amiable; but we arc
afraid he went to his grave ?he certainly drew up his last will?
without ever having reflected seriously on the nature of his own
dealings with his son?s mother, or on?to speak of nothing
more serious still?the personal, domestic, and social mischiefs
inevitably consequent on the sort of conduct which his precept
as well as his example held up for the imitation of his own
base-born boy. By his will he leaves five hundred pounds to
Madame de Bouchet f as some recompense for the injury he had
done her.? The story we believe to have been this:?About a
year before Chesterfield?s marriage, when he was ambassador
to Holland, he was the great lion, and moreover the Cupidon
dechaine of the Hague. Some of his adventures excited in a par-
ticular manner the horror of an accomplished Frenchwoman of
gentle birth who was living there as dame de compagnie to two or
three Dutch girls?orphans, heiresses, and beauties. Her elo-
quent denunciations of his audacious practices, and her obvious
alarm lest any of her fair charges should happen to attract his
attention, were communicated somehow to the dazzling ambas-
sador; and he made a bet that he would seduce herself first,
and then the prettiest of her pupils. With the duenna at least
he succeeded. She seems to have resided ever afterwards in or
near London, in the obscurest retirement and solitude?cut off
for ever from country, family, friends. Five hundred pounds!
Recompense!?


Recompense ! ? Five hundred pounds from one ol the wealthiest
lords in England, who had no children?Philip himself had died
some years before?and whose vast property was entirely at his
own disposal! It is satisfactory to add that she refused the ? re-
compense.? In the magnificent mansion which the Earl erected
in Audley Street, you may still see his favourite apartments fur-
nished and decorated as he left them ?among the rest what he
boasted of as ?the finest room in London??and perhaps even
now it remains unsurpassed ?his spacious and beautiful library,
looking on the finest private garden in London. The walls are
covered half way up with rich and classical stores of literature;
above the cases are in close series the portraits of eminent au-
thors, French and English, with most of whom he had conversed
?over these, and immediately under the massive cornice, extend
all round in foot-long capitals the Horatian lines:?
NUNC . VETERUM . LXBRIS . NUNC . SOMNO . ET . INERTIBUS . BORIS.
DUCERE . SOLICITOR . JUCUNDA . OBLXVIA . VIT^E.
On the mantel-pieces and cabinets stand busts of old oi?ators, in-
terspersed with voluptuous vases and bronzes, antique or Italian,
and airy Statuettes of Opera nymphs. We shall never recall
that princely room without fancying Chesterfield receiving in it a
visit of his only child?s mother?while probably some new victim
or accomplice was sheltered in the dim mysterious little boudoir
within ?which still remains also in its original blue damask and
fretted gold-work, as described to Madame de Monconseil. Did
this scene of ?sweet forgetfulness? rise before Mrs. Norton?s
vision when she framed that sadly beautiful episode which we
quoted in our last Number, of the faded broken-hearted mistress
reproaching in his library, amidst the busts of ? bards and orators
and sages,? the
? Protestant and protesting gentleman,?
who had robbed her innocence and blasted her life?
Hear the paternal voice when Chesterfield House was in the
hands of the decorators, and Philip Stanhope was at Paris ?a
novice of nineteen !
? What says Madame Dupin to you ? lam told she is very hand-
some still; I know she was so some few years ago. She has good parts,
reading, manners, and delicacy ; such an arrangement would be both
creditable and advantageous to you. She will expect to meet with all
the good-breeding and delicacy that she brings; and, as she is past the
glare and eclat of youth, may be the more willing to listen to your story,
if you tell it well. For an attachment, I should prefer her to la petite
Blot; and, for a mere gallantry, I should prefer la petite Blot to her;
so that they are consistent, et I?une n?empeche pas Vautre. Adieu ! re-
member la douceur et les graces ?vol. ii. p. 149.
And


And again (May, 1751) :
4 What do you mean by your Si fosois ? Qu?est ce qui vous empeche
d?oser? On ose toujours quand il y a esperance de succes ; et on ne
perd rien a oser, quand meme il n?y en a pas. Un honnete homme
oser, et quand il faut oser il ouvre la tranchee par des travaux, des
soins, et des attentions; s?il n?en est pas deloge d?abord il avance
toujours a I?attaque de la place meme. Apres de certaines approches
le succes est infallible, et il n?y a que les nigauds qui en doutent, ou qui
ne le tentent point. Seroit-ce le caractere respectable de Madame de la
Valiere qui vous empeche d?oser, ou seroit-ce la vertu farouche de
Madame Dupin qui vous retient ? La sagesse invincible de la belle
Madame Case vous decourage-t-elle plus que sa beaute ne nous invite?
Mais fi done !?Soyez convaincu que la femme la plus sage se trouve
flattee, bien loin d?etre offensee, par une declaration d?amour, faite avec
politesse et agrement. Il se pent bien qu?elle ne s?y pretera point, c est
a dire si elle a un gout ou une passion pour quelque autre ; en
tout cas elle ne vous en sejaura pas mauvais gre; de qu?il nest
pas question d?oser des qu?il n?y a pas de danger.? ?vol. ii. p. 150.
Such is the perpetual strain. What a contrast are Chatham?s
letters to his nephew, written at precisely the same period !
? At the root of all Lord Chesterfield?s errors,? says Lord Ma-
hon, 'lay a looseness of religious principle. In our opinion he
had no religion. Very lew of his friends and associates had much
?and he seems to have taken pleasant pains in recording the
various shades of their infidelity. Bolingbroke, he tells us, ' pro-
fessed himself a Deist, believing in a general providence, but
doubting, though by no means rejecting (as is commonly sup-
posed), the immortality of the soul and a future state (vol. ii.
p. 450); a duplicate nearly of Voltaire. Pope 'was a Deist,
believing in a future state: this he has often owned to me ; but
when he died, he sacrificed a cock to Esculapius, and suffered
the priests who got about him to perform all their absurd cere-
monies on his body.? (Ibid . p. 445.) It is to Chesterfield that
the world is indebted for the proof that Swift ended as the Tale
of a Tub shows him to have begun. Phe Dean died in the fiist
month of the Earl?s viceroyalty. He probably picked the Day
of Judgment? out of some confidential companion at Dublin, and
in 1751 he communicated the piece to Voltaire, through whose
Correspondence it first transpired. It ends with that consum-
mately finished confession of the church dignitary s faith :
4 While each pale sinner hung his head,
Jove, nodding, shook the heavens, and said:
Offending race of human kind.
By nature, reason, learning, blind;
You who through Frailty stepp?d aside,
And you who never fell ?from Pride ;
You


You who in different sects \vere shamm?d,
And come to see each other damn?d?
(So some folk told you, but they knew
No more of Jove?s designs than you)??
The world?s mad business now is o?er,
And I resent these pranks no more.
?I to such blockheads set my wit!
I damn such fools!?Go, go, you?re bit.??
It is to Chesterfield that we owe the story of Pope and Atter-
bury?s last interview in the Tower, according to which, unless
Pope told Chesterfield a most egregious and circumstantial lie,
or Chesterfield invented his own conversation with Pope at
Twickenham, Bishop Atterbury, though a Christian when he
left England never to return, had been a steady adherent of the
sect of Bolingbroke, all the while that he filled a prominent place
in the service and guidance of the Church of England. Lord
Mahon expresses utter disbelief in the whole story. ? What
judicious critic,? he says (vol. ii. p. 446), f would weigh in the
balance, for a moment, the veracity of Pope against the piety of
Atterbury T We hope his lordship?s decision is right.
That there was, however, one sincere Christian in the Twick-
enham set, we have the evidence even of Chesterfield. His Cha-
racter of Arbuthnot (now first printed) is a pleasing relief in
every way ?and here he says :
?He lived and died a devout and sincere Christian. Pope and I
were with him the evening before he died, wdien he suffered racking
pains from an inflammation in his bowels, but his head was clear to the
last. He took leave of us with tenderness, without weakness, and told
us that he died, not only with the comfort, but even the devout assur-
ance of a Christian.? ?vol. ii. p. 448.
Whether Chesterfield had the satisfaction of making his filial
pupil either a libertine or an infidel we have no sufficient evidence.
Notwithstanding Mr. James Boswell?s attestation to the respec-
tability of Mr. Philip Stanhope?s character (Croker?s edition, i.
254), these points remain in ohscuro. We suppose there is no
question that the noble tutor failed in his grand object of social
elegance ?and that, as Chesterfield had for his father a saturnine
Jacobite, so he had a pedantic sloven for his son. But we hope
these lines, which we take from the fly-leaf of a friend?s copy of
the fifth edition of the Letters (1774) ?the handwriting unknown
to that friend, though he is well skilled in such matters ?have no
merit but their point;?
? Vile Stanhope ?Demons blush to tell?
In twice two hundred places
Has shown his son the road to hell,
Escorted by the Graces:


But little did tli? ungenerous lad
Concern himself about them ;
For base, degenerate, meanly bad,
He sneaked to hell without them.?
Mr. Stanhope certainly made, in one important matter, a very
ungrateful return for the unbounded attention which Lord Ches-
terfield bestowed on his success in this w r orld. He married
without his father?s knowledge. The Earl never heard that
such a step had been contemplated even, until a widow and two
children presented themselves at his door with evidence of their
position. He was by this time very frail. The want of con-
fidence cut the aged apostle of dissimulation to the quick?
it was upon that son that he had concentrated his cares, and,
latterly at least, his affections. But he did not visit the offence
on the widow and the orphans. He dealt with them all in
the most generous manner. His letters to the lady are models of
graciousness, and he provided for her boys? education and future
establishment with liberality. Again he had an ungrateful return
As soon as he was in his coffin Mrs. Eugenia Stanhope set about
selling the manuscript of his Letters to her husband ?which cer-
tainly were written, if ever letters were, for the exclusive use of
one person, and that person and his representatives bound by
every tie to guard the secret ?dum calebant cineres at all events.
But she got 1500 Z. by the job. We doubt if any Earl has died
since 1773 for two little volumes of whose private letters any one
bookseller w r ould have given a third of the sum. They went
through five editions in the first twelve months.
His less exemplary usage of his ow r n wife met with another
sort of return. Her birth was, according to the now obsolete
notions of that time, an illustrious distinction, to which were
added, a peerage in her own right, a handsome fortune, the
prospect of a great one, and, unless her painters rivalled her
lovers, no common share of beauty. In truth, that this tall, dark-
haired, graceful woman sprung from the amours of a Llano-
verian king and a Dutch-built concubine seems to us, after all,
very doubtful. These pretensions and advantages, however,
were all hers when she selected Chesterfield from a host of
suitors; and certainly during the flower of her life and his
own he was a most profligate husband. Nevertheless, the Cor-
respondence bears evidence that the childless Countess treated
his son with almost maternal regard, and that in his infirm old
age she watched over him with unwearied devotion. For his
memory after he was gone she on all occasions showed an anxious
concern. Dr, Maty?s weak book is the monument of her tender-
ness. We are, we suppose, to divide our admiration between the
generosity


generosity of the sex which Chesterfield flattered, outraged, and
despised?the clinging instincts of virgin love and conjugal pride
?and the fascination of his habitual small courtesies.
The likeness prefixed to these volumes is from a very fine pic-
ture by Gainsborough at Chevening. It was painted in his
seventieth year?but we should have guessed him far above
eighty : for the excesses of youth and manhood (especially his
contempt of Boerhaave?s celebrated prescription for him when
consulted at the Hague) had produced a general languor and
relaxation of the nervous system, and seamed the beautiful coun-
tenance all over with wrinkles which no Lawrence would ever
have ventured to imitate. We are surprised that Lord Mahon
did not take rather the exquisite portrait in crayons by Rosalba,
done when Chesterfield House was building, and still impan-
nelled in its original position. This gives us the no longer
young, but perfectly preserved Chesterfield?the Ambassador,
the Viceroy, the Secretary. His figure, though on a small scale,
was very good?every limb turned by Nature?s daintiest hand,
yet full of vigour, till it paid the penalties of vice. The head is
inimitable ?we never saw any engraving of him, either from bust,
or medal, or picture, that gives an approach to its peculiar ex-
pression. The features are all classical?the eyes full of soft-
ness, yet of fire?the brow and eyebrows grave and manly ?
the mouth small, but impressed with such a mixture of firmness,
sense, wit, gaiety, and voluptuous delicacy as few artists could
have imagined?and no one of that day but Rosalba could have
transcribed.*

masculine


masculine zeal and intrepidity as a traveller, and his candour,
modesty, and clearness as a writer. The subject, moreover, is
one which ought to be deeply interesting to English readers. We
have as a nation a large stake, augmenting with every successive
year, in these our colonies of the southern world; and much obli-
gation is due to the enlightened foreigner who has sought, and
successfully, to render his Australian researches not merely pro-
fitable to science, but beneficial also to the practical interests of
the numerous and energetic people who are spreading the English
name and language over these remote shores.
In the various knowledge which he brings to his researches as
a traveller, Count Strzelecki is a worthy disciple of the Humboldt
school. He has eyes well tutored and intelligent for every part
and province of inquiry; for mountains and their minerals; for
the great under-world of fossil existence ; for botany ; for all the
conditions of atmosphere and climate, and the electrical and mag-
netic phenomena which act so largely therein; for agriculture and
the chemistry of soils; for languages and the characters of man.
These are large endowments, and they are honestly used; with
no assumption of knowledge not possessed, and with ample ac-
knowledgment of the labours of others in the same great field.
In commenting on the general merits of this work, we must
notice the advantage Count Strzelecki possesses in the extent of
his travels over the globe, and the independent activity of spirit
which has guided him throughout. A native of Poland, which
country we presume he quitted from political considerations,
he has passed twelve years continuously in pervagating seas and
lands; chiefly those the last and least explored by European ad-
venture, though now yielding to the great tide which civilization,
for ulterior purposes in the economy of Providence, is pouring
over them. We find from his Preface, that in the course of this
period he has visited North and South America, the West Indies,
the South Sea Islands, New Zealand, New South Wales, Van
Diemen?s Land, the Javanese Islands, part of China, and the
East Indies, and Egypt. Though this volume is limited to
Australia, w r e have abundant proof in the notes and illustrations
appended to it, that the same acute faculty of inquiry has accom-
panied him through these various regions ; the survey of one fur-
nishing instruction and preparation for that of another, and with
instruments of research fashioned and sharpened by constant
exercise. From the specimens of his manuscript journals occa-
sionally afforded in the present volume, we are well justified in
desiring that they may hereafter become known to us in their more
entire state.
In a recent article of this Review we had occasion to discuss ?
courteously.


courteously, we hope, as well as justly?the relative merits of a
fair class of travellers who occupy a large place in the literature
of the day; and we indicated certain parts in the history of travel
where the female eye and instinct gather up observations, the
finer lights and shades of things, not equally attained by the
grosser or graver perceptions of our own sex. A volume by Mrs.
Meredith on the very countries now brought before us in the
work of M. Strzelecki, furnished an apposite and agreeable illus-
tration of our meaning. We spoke highly of this volume at the
time, and can afford to repeat our commendation of it.
At a moment when the fashion of travelling, fostered by faci-
lities heretofore unknown to the world, has reached to so extra-
ordinary an extent, and is yet in progress further, we cannot, we
conceive, do amiss in adding some few general remarks, appli-
cable chiefly to those graver inquiries of the traveller which em-
brace the physical history and character of the earth itself, and of
the various forms of organised life spread over its surface?and,
further, the antiquities, languages, diversities of conformation,
social and political economy of the various races and nations of
men?objects which, even thus summarily stated, will be seen to
comprise a vast circle of knowledge and to require great variety of
talent for their successful pursuit. There is the more reason for
this, seeing the very large part which our own country bears in the
prevailing fashion of the time. It would probably be below the
truth, were we to rate the number of travellers furnished forth by
our narrow island as thrice that belonging to any equal amount of
population in the world. The overflowing commerce and colonial
establishments which render England a sort of officina gentium,
our national wealth and manner of education ; and, it may be, other
habits of our social life, are all concerned in this effect; which, with
every allowance for the vagaries of mere fashion, must be admitted
as no bad criterion of the intelligence and moral culture of a com-
munity. The great and almost fearful facilities of locomotion
w r hich have recently come into existence, and, aided by the capital
and energy of England, are still growing with gigantic rapidity
by land and sea, have already levelled the surface of the globe to
all ranks and conditions of men. Our small country squires,
shopkeepers, and artisans, traverse and crowd those regions which
heretofore were accessible only to the wealthy and curious few.
Tourists whose aspirations were once bounded by the Loire,
Rhine, or Po, are now familiarly found in Greece, Palestine, and
Egypt; and the transit from New Bond Street to the Bazaar of
Constantinople, or to those Pyramids which, in the phrase of an
eloquent old writer, f astonish Heaven with their audacity,? is as
readily made as tvas sixty years ago the journey from London to
Inverness.


Inverness. The f felix qui patriis aevum transegit in agris? is a
being well nigh lost to the world, and not likely to be ever re-
stored to us again. All these are mighty changes, and of high
import to the future destinies of man. The large part we have
in them makes it most fitting that this part should be worthily
performed, and as becomes a nation having instruments of great
power in its hands.
It would be difficult to class in any way travellers so numerous,
and carrying with them such various and complex interests and
motives, as those whom we annually send from our shores. Busi-
ness and idleness?the pursuit of knowledge or that of pleasure?
fortune and misfortune ?health and sickness?are all concerned
in furnishing cause for these migrations. For our present pur-
pose, however, it is enough to divide them into such as go abroad
without any power or design of adding to the information of
others, whatever may be their own particular gain; and those who
travel with higher objects and resources, seeking to extend the
domain of human knowledge, and thence to win honourable
fame to themselves. It is not very easy indeed to bring that
numerous and increasing body, the authors of books of travels,
under this simple classification. We fear, however, it must be
avowed, that the great majority of these works, whatever their
profession, do in fact add little to the sum of our knowledge ; and
that vanity and book-craft are much concerned in their production
and ephemeral existence. Facts transcribed more or less openly
from prior sources of information, and fringed with descriptions
of scenery and exaggerated anecdotes of personal adventure, form
the great staple of most of these volumes. They are like in this
to the palimpsest manuscripts of the Vatican and Ambrosian
libraries, that if the superficial writing be removed, the more
valuable characters come out from underneath, the obvious work
of other hands and a former time. What may best be alleged
for these books is, that they are a source of harmless pleasure to
many; and that in reviving recollections, and repeating in various
forms the knowledge already gained, they tend to keep it floating
on the surface and more accessible for daily use.
There are no absolute gaps in ihe world ; and we rise by steps
from these lighter tourists and authors of the day to the higher
labours, in whatever shape they be recorded, of men who bring
to their travels matured knowledge, the genius of discovery, or
the power of patient and laborious research. We most willingly
recognise the many travellers of our own country who belong to
this higher class; and contemplating the total surface of the globe
as the arena, we believe there is no nation which has gained so
much, or will transmit to posterity such various records of suc-
vol. lxx v i. no. clit. 2 l cessful


cessful inquiry. Our maritime position has mainly contributed
to this result; and, looking more especially to the present time,
we may cite as eminent instances the several expeditions of arctic
and antarctic discovery which have been sent forth during the last
twenty years; including, by an earnest anticipation of success, that
which is at this moment on its way to achieve?if achievement he
possible by energy and skill?the ancient problem of the north-
west passage. Our old maritime discoverers in this course, the
Frobishers, Hudsons, and Baffins, gave marvellous examples of in-
trepidity in traversing unknown and dangerous seas with their
small and ill-provided barks. But science has now been added
to boldness ; and since the time of Cook?s voyages, all our expe-
ditions, and especially those of latest date, have comprised men
admirably qualified by their various pursuits and attainments to
advance the progress, not of geography alone, but of every branch
of physical knowledge, by laud as well as on sea. We might in-
dulge in a long list of names to confirm our assertion, were they
not too familiarly known to require such notice.*
It is needful, however, to admit that this superiority is not
equally maintained by our travellers on land only. In relation to
their number, the proportion of those of high attainment and fit-
ness for their vocation is less than in Germany; nor can we justly
claim at this moment the place of foremost in reputation. The
fact as to relative proportion is readily explained. In the mass of
English travellers circulating over Eui?ope, and countries beyond,
we find classes and descriptions of persons who in the social eco-
nomy of other nations seldom or never quit their native soil. We
have already alluded to this ; and were it needful, might comment
more minutely on the composition of that extraordinary mul-
titude who carry the English name, character, and habits, over
the face of the earth; including (as we may remark for our pre-
sent purpose) a vast mass of the middle class of society,?very
many for mere matters of business; ?and a large number of the
young and untutored, fresh from nursery, school, or college. A
question of proportion taken from these gives no useful result.
The Germans, who quit their own country for travel ?much
fewer in number, and with smaller means and appliances of every
kind ?do nevertheless carry with them certain conditions well
fitted to successful research?an age sufficiently matured; habits
of labour and moderate living; great earnestness of purpose ;
* We cannot, however, willingly omit the name of Mr. Charles Darwin; who by
his various successful labours and acquisitions during the four years? voyage of the
Beagle, and by his various works connected with this expedition, has well sustained
his family name, and taken a high place among European travellers and naturalists.
We rejoice to see that his * Journal? has now been reprinted with additions, and in a
cheap form.
studies


studies directed beforehand to the particular objects and course
of travel; and it may perhaps be added, that temper of the Ger-
man mind which revels in the mysteries and obscure places of
nature, is ever seeking new systems and combinations in philo-
sophy, and is prone to invest with something metaphysical and
imaginative even the most arid technicalities of science.
We have adverted to Germany as the most opposite example
in comparison with England; and would especially comment on
one point just noticed, viz., the preparation for travelling by pre-
vious study. It would be waste of words to dwell long upon the
importance of this. Keeping ever before him the principle to
which Bacon has given new force and dignity by his injunction,
? genus humanum novis operibus ct potestatibus continub dot are,'*
the traveller who seeks to occupy a worthy place as such, must
make his undertaking commence bv labours at home; ?in the
closet or museum, the mountain, laboratoi?y, or mine. There is
no north-west passage here to lead rapidly and shortly to success ;
nor any instinct which can compensate for the deficiencies of
knowledge. One man by vigour, or a certain happiness of fa-
culty, may redeem these deficiencies more speedily than another;
but as far as they exist, they must render steril to the traveller
any soil he traverses, however fruitful and abounding to those
who come well prepared to gather a harvest there.
This is alike true as regards all branches of science and objects
of research. The latter should be defined beforehand, as far as
this may be possible. The enlightened traveller will interest
.himself in whatever is known, thoroughly or partially, of the
countries he is about to explore; and equally in all that is yet
undone and unknown. If it be wholly a new field (and many
such still remain on the surface of the globe), the demand for
preparation in one view is greater, as the objects are less defined.
But on the other hand, everything is here pure gain, and none
can come back from such places altogether unladen.
These observations may seem trite and needless; and yet they
are in some sort justified by what we are bound to consider a de-
ficiency in the education of travellers in our own country. We
willingly except from this remark the many eminent naturalists
(amidst whom our geologists are conspicuous), and the numerous
learned in history, antiquities, languages, &c., who carry out with
them all the acquirements needful for successful travel. But it
is a question of proportion and degree; and we are persuaded
more might might be done, both at our universities and else-
where, to fashion the minds and hands of those who have the
world before them for active survey. Without the formality of
* Cogitata et Visa.
normal
2 L 2


normal schools for travellers, we are persuaded that much might be
effected through our old academic institutions, if rightly moulded
and applied to this end.* And in the more recent institution of
the Geographical Societ} 7 , were it enlarged and supported as its
importance well deserves, we perceive an admirable basis for
some such scheme of instruction; which, by affording exact and
ready information to the future traveller?indicating to him, in
regard to the countries and objects he has in view, what remains
to be done, and the method and instruments by which these desi-
derata may best be attained ?would tend to repair the deficien-
cies under which we still labour in this respect. Some effort and
expense might well be devoted to this desirable end.f
A few remarks more before coming to the work under our re-
view. We have spoken of M. de Strzelecki as a traveller of the
Humboldt school, meaning thereby to designate a method and
scope of research of which Humboldt himself has furnished the
most illustrious example. No rigid definition can be given of
this method, inasmuch as it is only the extension and more perfect
form of that which must be the course and purport of every scien-
tific inquiry. But it is the amount of this perfection with which
we are here concerned. The naked observation of facts must
ever be essentially the same process, with due allowance for
variation in the important elements of number, minuteness, and
accuracy; and no observer so crude, as not to bring his facts
into some connexion with each other, or with kindred parts of
human knowledge. But the method to which we allude, which
has grown with the growth of science, and become strong in its
strength, rests upon a foundation common to all true philosophy.
It views nature through the relations and analogies of parts; throws
an eagle glance over objects seemingly the most remote and dis-
sociated ; masters difficulties by attacking them from points already
known and secured; and achieves, by a principle of research,
Jesuits which no rude or untutored observation can attain.
Setting aside, then, the diversity of talent in individual ob-
? We are compelled here to advert to the travelling fellowships at our universities.
With two or three eminent exceptions, it must be allowed that these have been singu-
larly unfruitful in results to the world.
f We perceive with pleasure by the Address last year to the Society from their late
excellent president, Mr. Murchison, that attention has been directed to this point; and
a plan adopted of recording the desiderata for future travel in different countries,
under such revision and arrangement as to render them most accessible and useful for
reference. This plan, if duly executed, is good in itself, and capable of extension to
other and larger purposes.
We have always admired these ancient maps of D?Anville, in which the parts un-
known, instead of being filled up with imaginary mountains and rivers, are left as
honest blanks, with the few simple words upon them ? i Desideraiur hujus iracius
accuraiior description
servers, ?


servers, ?a matter doubtless of much importance ?this supe-
riority of method mainly depends on the more enlarged and
various knowledge of the sciences, and their mutual connexions,
which the traveller brings with him, ready and ripened, into the
field of action. What old Roger Ascham says on another sub-
ject, f Even as a hawk flieth not high with one wing, even so a
man reacheth not to excellency with one language,? is in some
sort applicable here. The man of one science only, from default
of that power which works among the relations of things, can
never attain the highest excellence even in his own proper pur-
suit. And this is equally true whether he be studying quietly at
home, or pursuing knowledge through toil and adventure in fo-
reign lands.
An important qualification must, however, be admitted here.
The traveller who starts with a single object of research, ignorant
or careless of others, may yet, by earnest devotion to this, obtain re-
sults which could be gained in no other way. Such instances have
been frequent, particularly in the sciences of mineralogy, zoology,
and botany ; and as we have read somewhere a warm eulogium upon
an ? illustrious araclmologlst,? we see no reason to limit this pro-
fitable division of labour, or to doubt that the especial collectors
of spiders, beetles, algse, and lichens, are each and all rendering
valuable services to the cause of knowledge. That eminent na-
turalist, Ehrenberg, whose consummate researches with the
microscope we have ourselves witnessed, has laboured for years,
and in every part of the world, among the living and fossil Infu-
soria, the most minute, as far as we know, of organized beings;
and by his devotion to the subject has defined what may almost
be termed a new science, viz., the formation of mineral masses.
and even mountains, from the debris of the countless myriads of
these microscopic animalcules, whose generations have lived and
perished in the succession of ages. But Ehrenberg, though de-
voted to this subject, is far from being limited to it, or he had
failed in attaining what he has done. And it may be fairly re-
peated that knowledge in its higher advancements.

whether derived from travel or from other sources, depends for its
superiority chiefly on that happy combination of faculties and
methods which can bring the several parts of science into relation
with each other, and make them gradually converge towards an
harmonious whole. No man can put forth powers for all parts
of this work; but every one may hold in view the principle and

methods


methods of contribution to it, and thereby render his labours more
successful and useful to the world.
In making these remarks, we have mainly in view their appli-
cation to the higher order of travellers, and to that education for
travel, as it may rightly be termed, which we desire to see en-
larged and improved. Having connected the name of Humboldt
with this topic, we may fitly quote a passage from himself in illus-
tration of it, taken from the Preface to the latest work which this
distinguished man has given to the world?we would fain hope
not the last, though he seems to intimate that such will be the
case. The f Cosmos, or Scheme of a Physical Description of the
Universe,? is yet little known in England; and it would be too
early to characterize minutely this first portion of a work so vast
in its bearings and profound in all its views. We might quote
many passages to our present purpose, but that alluded to from
the Preface must suffice.*
? While through outward circumstances of life, and an irresistible im-
pulse to various branches of knowledge, I was led to occupy myself many
years, and to all appearance exclusively, with particular objects of study,
?descriptive botany, geognosy, chemistry, astronomical geography, and
terrestrial magnetism ?in preparation for a great scheme of travel, I had
ever before me a more especial and higher motive for these attainments.
My leading impulse was the endeavour to comprehend the phenomena
of corporeal things in their common mutual dependences and nature as a
whole, moved and vivified through inward powers (ein durch innere
Krafte bewegtes und belebtes Ganze). I had from intercourse with
highly-gifted men early arrived at the conviction that without a serious
devotion to the study of particulars, all large and general views of the
world must be little more than airy fabrics. But these unities in the
knowledge of nature, from their inward essence are capable, as through
an appropriate power, of mutual fructification. Descriptive botany, no
longer confined to the narrow circle of determining genera and species,
leads the observer who wanders through distant lands and lofty moun-
tains to the doctrine of the geographical distribution of plants over the
earth?s surface, in proportion to the distance from the equator, and the
perpendicular elevation of the spot. And yet further to unravel the
complex causes of this distribution, must we closely examine the laws of
* In rendering this passage from the original, we feel, what every one acquainted
with Humboldt?s German writings will recognise, the equal difficulty and importance
of adhering as closely as possible to the sense and phraseology of the author, it is well
said by Dryden, in one of his admirable prefaces (and who ever so well fulfilled the
latter condition as himself i), that ?a translator must perfectly understand his author's
tongue, and absolutely command his own.? In addition to these requisites, a trans-
lation of the Cosmos can be perfectly executed only by one familiar with the subjects
of the work, and the spirit of philosophy in which they are handled.
We are tempted to transcribe from the original the last sentences of this volume :
?Ein physiches naturgemiilde bezeichnet die Grenze, wo die splfare der intelligenz
beginnt, und der feme Blick sich senkt in eine andere Welt. Es bezeichnet die Grenze,
und �berschreitet sie nicht.?


the variation of temperature of climates, as well as of the meteorological
changes of the atmosphere. Thus each class of phenomena leads the ob-
server, earnest for knowledge, forward to another class on which it is
itself founded, or which depends upon it.?
The researches of Count Strzelecki in New Holland and Van
D iemen?s Land extended uninterruptedly over a period of five
years, during which time he travelled fully seven thousand miles;
entirely, as it appears, on foot. This is a prodigious effort in a
new country, still only scantily tamed by European culture, and
singularly deficient in many of the provisions requisite for the
traveller; and its merit becomes greater when we advert to the
laborious nature of his inquiries, and to the hazards and privations
he incurred in following- them out. We have reason to believe
o ,
that he performed these journies entirely upon his own resources,
though liberally aided by the sanction and good will of the
colonial authorities. The high regard in which he was held by
them, and the colonists at large, was strongly attested in Van
Diemen?s Land, by an address to him after his departure, signed
by Sir John Franklin the governor, the Chief Justice, and all
the principal settlers, expressing their admiration of his talents,
and esteem for his personal character, and transmitting a sub-
scription of four hundred pounds in aid of the publication of the
volume now before us, the value of which they thus recognise by
anticipation.
The work is divided into eight sections. The first contains a
short narrative of the Maritime and Land Surveys of New South
Wales and Van Diemen?s Land down to the present time; the
second treats of Terrestrial Magnetism, as observed in these
? countries ; the third is devoted to their Geology and Mineralogy ;
the fourth treats of their climatology under several heads; the
fifth regards the fossil and existing Flora; and the sixth the fossil
and existing Fauna. The first subdivision of each of these sec-
tions includes the description and comparison of all the organic
remains which afford geological proof as to the succession and
relation of the several formations. The seventh contains notices
of the physical and moral state of the Aborigines ; and section
eight treats of the Colonial Agriculture, the character and che-
mical analysis of the different soils of these colonies, and the
resources and methods of improvement open to the future enter-
prise and industry of the settlers.
In an article of this Review some years ago (No. 135), directed
chiefly to the social and political economy of our Australian colo-
nies, some slight notices were given of the physical singularities
of this great continent, and every year is now rendering them
more familiar to us. A strange and paradoxical region it is, and
warranting


warranting the expression of a great naturalist?that it seems as
if clropt from another planet! This singularity is seen even on
approaching its shores, in the dull, monotonous, olive-green colour
of the vegetation along the immense line of boundary coast; the
same in every part, and at all seasons of the year.* The absence
or paucity of great rivers, in a continent which ministers abundant
space for streams as large as the Rhine and Danube, adds another
character of sameness to these Australian shores. Within, as far
as discovery has yet penetrated, and wherever European culture
has not brought in partial varieties of form and colouring, the
same monotony strikes and wearies the sense. It is hard to con-
ceive anything more strangely melancholy than those vast flats in
the interior, described to us by Oxley and other explorers of the
country, where rivers stagnate into non-existence in a wilderness
of gigantic reeds; and the traveller scarcely finds a knoll high
enough to raise him above the waters in the season of floods; ?or
those wide tracts of thick herbaceous brushwood, fitly called
scruhhs, affording nothing either to sustain or solace those who
traverse them. The long chain of mountains, stretching in line
parallel to the eastern coast, affords indeed a more varied land-
scape, and, as might be expected, greater resemblance to European
scenery ; but even in these?the skeleton, as it were, of the
country ?there are several peculiarities of conformation, and,
above all, a singular scarcity of the simple minerals, rendering
their study more laborious and less inviting to the naturalist.
Our Museums and Zoological Gardens, as well as the beauti-
ful works of Gould and other naturalists, have familiarized us
with the new and strange forms of animal and vegetable life in
this region. But familiarity cannot abate our wonder and interest
in the extraordinary diversities of structure thus localized and
limited, which render New Holland the most remarkable of those
provinces or centres of organized existence, into which, as a result
of the more exact and extensive observation of the present time,
the surface of the earth has been distributed. As respects the
Flora, it is not merely a record of new genera, but of entire
natural orders, unknown elsewhere in the world. The Eucalvntae,

* A principal cause of this saddening uniformity of aspect in the Australian vege-
tation is thus stated by our distinguished botanist, Mr. 11. Brown, in the supplement to

organization, are the most striking of these vegetable anomalies.
In the animal kingdom, with the exception of the dog, ? le seul
animal qui a suivi I?homme partout sur la terre,? there is not a
single indigenous quadruped known on any other continent; ?no
quadrumana, ruminating, or pachydermatous animals; no large
mammalia indeed, and a general paucity of land animals; but
those which do exist, remote from all our common analogies and
conceptions, and forming a little world by themselves. Of the
different species of kangaroos; the phascolomys, or wombat; the
ornithorhynchus and echidna, the most anomalous of animals;
the dasyurus, flying phalangers, &c., it has been well said by
Cuvier, ? ils sont venus etonner les naturalistes par des conforma-
tions etranges, qui rompent toutes les regies, et echappent a tons
les systemes.?*
We have spoken of the interior of the Australian continent;
but in fact our knowledge, except in a few places, scarcely goes
beyond the outer margin of this great region. Where colonization
has furthest penetrated, under the simple form of sheep pastures,
it is still but in the proportion of Kent and Essex to the whole
extent of England. The vast central part of the continent is still
unknown, even to speculation. Were we to presume upon its
physical characters from the parts now familiar to us, we must
doubt whether even the enterprise of such men as have hitherto
explored New Holland will ever do more than traverse it in par-
ticular lines, and these perhaps not touching the centre : still
more must we doubt whether colonization on a large scale can
ever extend itself deeply into the interior. The lapse of time,
and the progress of man?s inventions, removing or counteracting
natural obstacles, may however render it otherwise in the event;
and meanwhile these very physical singularities offer strong in-
citement to research, and to the solution of the numerous problems
in geography, natural history, and general physics, arising in a
region thus hidden from the rest of the world.f
It is to the coasts of this remarkable continent, at the distance
of 15,000 or 16,000 miles from us, that the spirit of English
colonization is now directing itself with a vigour so peculiarly its
own. M. de Strzelccki prefaces his volume, happily enough, with
* Discours sur les Revolutions de la Surface du Globe, ?ln the British Museum there
now exists a magnificent collection, richly illustrating every part of the Fauna of New
Holland,
I The probability doubtless is, that the interior of New Holland, with certain pecu-
liarities as to the distribution of the waters falling upon it, will be found one of those
great fats of the earths surface which Humboldt has so admirably described (1808)
in his Essay on the Steppes and Deserts of the Globe?the Llanos and Pampas ot
South America, the Prairies of North America, the sandy Desert of Africa, and the
vast plateau of the Tartarian Steppes in Central Asia.
a contrast


a contrast between the savage and solitary aspect of Port Jackson,
as described by Collins, when the first colonists, 1030 in number,
arrived there fifty-seven years ago, and a narrative in the Aus-
tralian newspaper of August 4, 1843, recording the ceremony of
opening the Session of the Legislative Council, under more ex-
tended powers ?the speech of the Governor moulded in the most
approved form of such documents, and the pomps and pagean-
tries of the scene very much in the European fashion, as the fol-
lowing extract from the paper will show :
? At an early hour the House presented an animated and brilliant
appearance, most of the seats in the body of the Chamber being filled
with elegantly-dressed ladies, among whom we noticed Lady Gipps,
Lady O?Connell, &c A guard of honour was drawn up in the
court-yard of the Chamber, and his Excellency was received with pre-
sented arms, the band playing ? God save the Queen.? The Governor
was received at the door of the Council Chamber by the Speaker, who
conducted him to the vice-regal chair, on the left of the Speaker?s chair.
At this moment the appearance of the House was extremely striking?
the elegant costumes of the ladies, and the brilliant uniforms of the
official and military members, and of the numerous staff, which occupied
places below the vice-regal chair, completing the mise en scene , which
was in every respect worthy of the, occasion. The mayor, aldermen,
and common council of the city had seats within the bar. The
strangers? gallery was crowded to excess, as was also the reporters?
gallery,? &c. &c.
Might we not fancy ourselves reading a London newspaper of
the first week of February, rather than a journal of the antipodes?
Our author, warm with wonder at these things, breaks out into
expressions of admiration of the Anglo-Saxon race :
? The hardy nature of this race is proof against the effects of trans-
plantation, for it does not depend upon the soil either for its character
or its nationality. The Anglo-Saxon reproduces his country wherever
he hoists his country?s flag.
? The United Kingdom is far from furnishing a just idea of this race.
The traveller there is like one buried in the entrails of a Colossus. It is
in the United Slates, in the West Indies, in the factories of South
America and China, in the East Indies, and in this town of Sydney,
that the prodigious expansion of the Anglo-Saxon life, the gigantic
dimensions of its stature, and the energy of its functions, are fully per-
ceived and appreciated.?
The race, thus eloquently commended, is assuredly in a state
of high activity in our Australian settlements; and though the
prosperity of these colonies is in some sort intermittent, with
intervals of depression between, yet is this but a miniature re-
semblance of the mother country, and from similar and connected
causes. The main fact is that of vigorous and rapid progress.
checked


checked at times, but never subdued. The harbour of Sydney is
crowded with vessels of every tonnage and from all parts; its
streets swarm with people and business; its daily newspapers
contain more advertisements than did a London newspaper sixty
or seventy years ago; its courts of law, churches, schools, cha-
ritable institutions, joint-stock companies, circulating libraries,
races, concerts, and assemblies, are all fashioned upon the Eng-
lish model; and will be bequeathed as such, whether for good
or ill, to future generations and ages of Australia. We have
nationality enough to believe that the good will largely prepon-
derate in the scale, but time is required to put it to the test.
While speaking of this new capital of the south, we cannot
resist quoting a passage from our author which gives a more
favourable view of its moral and social condition than we derive
from other writers. After reciting certain strong phrases from
these works, he adds?
? Let the authors of these and other epithets, contained in their works
on New South Wales, congratulate and applaud themselves : my mysti-
fication was complete. The evening I effected my disembarkation in
Sydney, I did it with all imaginable precaution, leaving my watch and
purse behind me, and arming myself Avith a stick, being resolved to en-
counter inevitable dangers with the least possible risk I found,
however, on that night, in the streets of Sydney, a decency and quiet
which I have never witnessed in any of the ports of the United Kingdom.
No drunkenness, no sailors? quarrels, no appearance of prostitution,
Avere to be seen, George Street, the Regent Street of Sydney, displayed
houses and shops modelled after the fashion of those of London; but
nowhere did its lamps, or the numerous lights in its windows, which
reflected upon the crowd, betray any of those signs of a corrupt state of
.society common to the streets of other capitals. Since then, how many
nights like the first have I not Avitnessed, in which the silence, the
feeling of perfect security, and the delicious freshness of the air, mingled
Avith nothing that could break the charm of a solitary walk! ?
Our present concern, however, is chiefly with the physical
history of Australia; and we must quit therefore these matters of
colonial morals, fervently hoping that the picture of Count
Strzelecki is the truer one. For the same reason Ave must put
aside the various questions of convict population and labour, of the
appropriation and sale of lands, the amount of representati\ 7 e
government safe or necessary in these colonies, the methods of
taxation and expenditure, and the treatment of the aborigines ?
all subjects of great importance, and affording problems, the prac-
tical difficulties of which it requires much wisdom and experience
to solve and surmount.
The first section of Count Strzelecki?s work relates, as Ave have
said, to the different marine and land surveys of New Holland
and


and Van Diemen?s Land, from the time of Captain Cook?s dis-
coveries on these shores to the present day. In this narrative
are briefly sketched the successive labours of Flinders, Bass,
King:, and Stokes in coast-surveys, and the equally meritorious
services of Oxley, Sturt, Cunningham, Sir T. Mitchell, and others
in exploring the interior of the country. The voyages of Flinders
and King deserve commemoration, as striking examples of the
ardour, ability, and perseverance which British officers carry with
them to the performance of such duties. Captain King surveyed
minutely about 2700 miles of coast; to complete which, it is esti-
mated that he must have sailed nearly 40,000 miles, in small
and faulty vessels, and along coasts very dangerous, and in great
part unknown.
The Count alludes shortly and modestly to his own discovery
of the tract named Gipps? Land, forming the S.E. portion of New
Flolland. But his researches, as extending along the Australian
chain of mountains for many degrees of latitude, do in fact em-
brace much more of local discovery, curious to science, and profit-
able to future colonization. Having in view certain objects,
chiefly geological, and finding himself in a country so vast and
imperfectly known, he wisely prescribed boundaries to his survey ;
limiting it at first to the country running parallel with, and
stretching 150 miles inland from the sea-coast, comprehended
between the 30th and 39th degrees of S. latitude. But reaching
the S.E. point of New Holland, he found that the same chain of
mountains re appeared in the succession of rugged and lofty isles
of Bass?s Strait, and again more largely developed in Van Die-
men s Land; and with the same zeal and patience he extended his
researches to the southern extremity of this island. A remark-
able evidence of these qualities is the table he gives of the heights
of various mountains, lakes, plains, and stations in the countries
so surveyed. Out of about 230 altitudes, at least a hundred are
derived from his own observations, either by two barometers and
the back observations, or with Wollaston?s boiling-water apparatus.
We further know that he has prepared a geological map of New
South Wales and Van Diemen?s Land, on the large scale of one-
fourth of an inch to a mile; and another sheet of vertical sections,
the base and the height of the sections being each projected on
one scale of four inches to the mile ; with colouring on a new
plan, well calculated to illustrate the geological characters and
eras. These he is unable himself to publish; but he has given
in this volume a small map, geologically coloured, and sufficient
for all the purposes of the common reader.
In the second section, on Terrestrial Magnetism, M. de
Strzelecki gives a table of declinations only, with the corresponding
latitudes


latitudes and longitudes which he has observed at different points
in New Holland and Van Diemen?s Land. These observations
were made in ignorance of that great scheme of magnetic inquiry
in which so many nations of the earth are now associated, and
which by various happy devices combines the labours of thirty-
four magnetic stations scattered over the globe into one group of
results. The strict simultaneity of time in taking observations,
and the perfect similarity and completeness of instruments and
methods, are the essential parts of this great scientific union,
which is certain to be fruitful of important truths. England has
twelve of these stations at different and distant parts of her em-
pire ; among which that of Hobart Town, established by Sir
James Ross on his voyage of Antarctic discovery, is singularly
important from its situation, and well provided in every way for
the research.
The third section brings us to the Geology and Mineralogy of
this region;?a subject manifestly in great favour with our
author, and to which he brings ability and knowledge. We have
just alluded to that long chain of mountains which forms a sort
of backbone to New South Wales ; and by reference to which all
the subordinate formations may, as it were, be deciphered and
read off. Count Strzelecki lived often for months together upon
and among these mountains; determining the various facts re-
quired as to the succession, position, and structure of the masses
and strata, by a series of zigzag sections made across the country;
and by examination of the flanks of the dividing range, against
which the different strata abut. Great labour and severe privations
were incurred in this investigation; but he persevered in it to the
end.
The chain of mountains in question, allowing for the inter-
ruption of Bass?s Strait, has now been surveyed continuously for
about 1200 miles, and presumably extends much further towards
the north. That larger part of this line which belongs to
New South Wales everywhere divides the waters flowing west-
wards into the interior, from those which run with shorter
courses to the eastern coast. The chain rarely recedes more than
sixty miles from this coast, and preserves great uniformity of
direction, showing a cause of elevation which has operated recti-
linearly over a vast space. Reaching the S.E. extremity of New
South Wales at Cape Wilson, it is submerged beneath the sea;
but projects, as we have seen, a chain of bold island-peaks above
the waters of Bass?s Strait, showing its continuity and identity of
character. It breaks out again in lofty and more massive form in
Van Diemen?s Land, forming nearly the whole of that large
island; and at its southern point plunges finally into the great
Southern


Southern Ocean?unless, indeed, we are to regard as remote pro-
longations of it the mountains of the newly discovered Antarctic
land, and those vast volcanoes, loftier than Etna or Teneriffe, first
seen by our intrepid navigator Sir J. Ross, and which pour forth
fire within eleven degrees of the pole, and amidst regions of
eternal ice and snow.
There is considerable uniformity of height throughout the por-
tion of the chain hitherto examined. In that more northern part
of it called the Liverpool range, there are peaks of greenstone,
reaching an elevation of 4700 feet. Proceeding southwards, along
that portion called the Blue Mountains, directly west of Sydney,
the summit heights vary from 2500 to upwards of 4000 feet. In
the Australian Alps, as they have been termed, near to Bass?s
Strait, the mountains become bolder, and the sienitic peak of Mount
Kosciuszko reaches the height of 6500 feet; the greatest elevation
yet ascertained in New Holland. In Van Diemen?s Land the
highest point is Mount Humboldt, 5520 feet; but Ben Lomond
and other hills approach nearly to it.
We cannot afford space to do more than sketch in outline the
geological and mineral characters of this mountain chain, and of
those formations to which it may be considered as constituting an
axis. The prominent circumstance here is, that the central heights
along the whole extent of the dividing range, are composed of
crystalline and irrupted rocks, granite, sienite, quartz rock, pro-
togene, serpentine, greenstone, and other augitic rocks; ?while
the sedimentary strata, siliceous, calcareous, argillaceous, or bitu-
minous, are confined to the eastern and western talus of the
range, resting upon it either in vertical, inclined, or horizontal
position. Of the former class, granite, sienite, and quartz rock,
preponderate; and granite, according to our author, constitutes
nearly the entire fioor of the western portion of New South Wales,
and extends far into the interior of New Holland; spread out in
masses of mamillary, globular, or botryoidal form ; closely resem-
bling Humboldt?s description of the strange tracts of bare irrupted
granite which surround the great central masses of the Altai
chain. It is exceedingly probable that several of the singularities
of the Australian continent have their origin in this circumstance
of physical constitution.
It is clear that subterranean heat and force have been largely
at work here, as elsewhere ; ?crystallizing, elevating, contorting,
and giving direction to the mountain ranges. Every extension
of geological knowledge has extended our views as to these great
agencies from below; and now that more exact observation in
mines and Artesian wells has proved a constant increase of tem-
perature in descending from a certain line near the surface, and
even


even demonstrated the law of such increment, we no longer hesi-
tate to admit the idea of the interior of the globe being occupied
by matter, more or less fluid from its proper heat, and preserved
from farther cooling by that consolidated crust around, which
mankind tread upon and call their earth. Earthquakes and vol-
canoes are the present most obvious exponents of the disturbance
which central movements and agencies (be they chemical, elec-
trical, or whatever their nature) may create in this surrounding
crust ; to which may now be added on recent evidence, the slow
rising of certain tracts of land by causes clearly acting from be-
low. Some geologists, taking unmeasured time into their hands,
have believed these forces, thus slowly acting, to be capable of
producing all that we now see on the surface of the globe. We
cannot think this to be so. The phenomena of gradual eleva-
tions are yet very partial and imperfectly known; while we find
in the outward aspect of the earth, ?the distribution, elevation,
disturbance, mutual relation, and mineral contents of its moun-
tain masses?an assured proof of forces once acting, the same
perhaps in kind, but of infinitely greater energy than those which
now tret or alter the surface on which we live. All science
seems to us to concur in vindicating this belief; and reverting to
the subject before us, we cannot doubt that such forces have been
concerned in raising, at successive periods, the great Australian
chain, and giving position to the conterminous strata.
Our author classes the rocks of New South Wales and Van
Diemen?s Land under four heads or epochs, each representing a
period or state which may be fairly distinguished from others by
evidences of superstructure or organic remains; though not pre-
cluding the likelihood of other less important epochs of disturb-
ance and change. We will not quarrel with this arrangement as
a provisional one in a new country, but it will require alterations
hereafter to bring it into closer bearing with the more recent
methods of geologists in Europe.
Lender the first epoch he includes the mineral masses, which
appear to have been irrupted or upheaved through the submarine
crust of the earth, raising a tract of land so far as to prevent any
further accumulation of marine deposits. These masses are com-
posed of crystalline and unstratified, or of stratified rocks, neither
containing any organic remains. We have already specified the
former, and described the great extension of gi?anite in particular
in New South Wales. The primitive schists, mica slate, sili-
ceous slate, and clay slate, are much less extensive, and attain
less elevation than the unstratified rocks. At Mount Kosciuszko,
where they surround the sicnxtic peak, they reach to 3200 feet,
and are nearly vertical in position, showing the intensity of the
expansxve


expansive force at this point. In Van Diemen?s Land both
classes of rocks reappear, stretching to its southern extremity.
The second epoch is characterised by a different group of crystal-
line and sedimentary compounds, incumbent upon those just de-
scribed, and containing the first traces of organic life. The stra-
tified masses are chiefly siliceous and argillaceous slates, gray-
wackes, sandstone, and conglomerates. Among the unstratified
rocks we have various porphyries, granular quartz rock, amor-
phous and columnar greenstone, basalt, trachyte, serpentine, and
various granular limestones. The localities of these several rocks,
as of those of the first epoch, are given in some detail; with
several of the more remarkable sections, illustrating them in
series. Catalogues of the fossils contained in the limestones,
sandstones, and graywacke of this group are also given, which
organic remains are described more minutely in another part of
the volume by Mr. Lonsdale and Mr. Morris. They belong to
the Polyparia, Crinoidea, Conchifcra, Brachiopoda, Gasteropoda,
Pteropoda, and Crustacea. Though singularly scanty both as to
species and individuals, yet are they important as associating some
of the rocks in question with the Palaeozoic series of other countries,
though the points of relation require still to be more clearly made
out. The crystalline unstratified rocks brought under this epoch
are manifestly those of eruption, referrible to distinct and often
distant periods, as proved by their relations to the strata with
which they are in contact. Thrown forcibly upwards among the
latter, the greenstone, basalts, and porphyries have strangely dis-
turbed and dislocated them, more especially in Van Diemen?s
Land; the whole extent of which island shows marks of these
ancient and violent revolutions, making the researches of the
geologist there often very difficult and perplexing.
The rocks of the third epoch, though more limited in extent,
are of greater interest, inasmuch as they include the coal forma-
tion of these countries, distributed into three principal basin-
shaped localities, viz., the Newcastle basin in New South Wales,
the largest in extent; and the South Esk and Jerusalem basins
in Van Diemen?s Land. Indications of similar basins have been
found upon the same coast farther to the north, by Oxley,
Cunningham, and other observers. The manner in which the
mineral masses of the second epoch were added to the earlier
formations, is considered by our author to explain this con-
formation, so well adapted to the important deposits which have
taken place in the localities in question. For what so important
in the actual condition of the world, as this extraordinary mi-
neral, coal??the staff and support of present civilisation, the
great instrument and means of future progress! The very
familiarity
W


familiarity and multiplicity of its uses disguise from observa-
tion the important part it bears in the life of man, and the
economy of nations. We have often thought, with something
of fearful interest, what would be the condition of the world,
and of England in particular, were this subterranean treasure
exhausted, or even much abridged in quantity. Yet such is
the term to which, if the globe itself should last, our posterity
must eventually come; and as respects our own country, the
period, at the present rate of consumption, can be defined with
some exactness. The immense coal basins of the Ohio and Mis-
sissippi will yet be yielding their riches to the then innumerable
people of the Western world, when our stores are worked out and
gone. Yet here also time will fix its limit. Geology gives no
indication whatsoever of natural processes going on, by which
what is once consumed may be recreated or repaired. The ori-
ginal materials of the formation may be said to be no longer
present; ?the agencies and conditions necessary to the work are
either wanting, or partial and deficient in force. Whether human
science, grasping at this time what seem almost as new elements
of power committed to man, may hereafter discover a substitute
for this great mineral, is a problem which it belongs to future
generations to resolve.
The deposits in the three coal basins just mentioned, appear
to be of different dates and conditions of formation, as shown by
the differences of the coal and other strata in each. The New-
castle district, which extends about a hundred miles along the
eastern coast, including Sydney, and the most populous part of
the colony, contains the only mines yet much worked, and offers
the largest future prospects to the miner. From one of the
several sections here given, that of a coal-pit near the mouth of
the Hunter River in this district, we find that in a depth of 204
feet there are five beds of coal, two of them 5 feet in thickness.
The conglomerate which comes to the surface here, dips to the
westward under thick masses of variegated micaceous sandstone;
which rock, found in most places above the coal strata, and a
yellow limestone containing Bulinus and Helix, are the highest
beds in the geological series of the two colonies.
The coal deposits of Van Diemen?s Land are of less extent
and value than that just noticed. M. Strzelecki gives a mineralo-
gical description, and analyses by himself, of several varieties of
the mineral from different localities, as well as of the anthracite
and lignite of Van Diemen?s Land. In both countries, and espe-
cially in the latter, the coal strata have been invaded at successive
periods by irruptions of greenstone and basalt, producing great
disturbance and dislocation of the beds, as well as certain chemical
VOL. lxxvi, NO. clii. 2 m effects.


effects, testified in the characters and quality of the coal. In the
South Esk basin, this series of strata, with the variegated sand-
stone above them, have been uplifted 2100 feet above the actual
level of the basin.
The fossil Flora of the Australian coal formation (differing
more or less for each basin) is interesting, not in the abundance
of the species it affords, for they are singularly scanty, but in the
total absence of the remarkable genera which characterise the
European and American coal strata ?the lepidodendron, slgillaria,
stigmaria, calamites, and coniferae. It would seem that during
the carboniferous period, the Flora of these regions was as distinct
from that of other parts of the globe as is that now existing under
our eyes. It must be noticed, however, that there are strong
analogies, or perhaps identity, between some of the fossil species
and those of the Burdwan coal-field in India?a geographical
relation of some value, especially if this observation should here-
after be extended to any points intermediate between these
localities.
The fourth epoch, if such it may be called, includes the various
accumulated materials which in the form of loose gravel or sand,
elevated beaches, osseous and other breccias. See., lie upon the
stratified or unstratified rocks of the country; and probably re-
presents, in part, the Pleiocene epoch of European geologists,
though requiring further examination both in New South Wales
and other parts of this great continent. We need not be detained
here, otherwise than by noticing the magnificent fossil trees in the
Derwent valley in Van Diemen?s Land, which our author alludes
to under this head. A microscopic examination of this opallzed
wood, by Dr. Hooker of the Erebus discovery ship, shows so
much of coniferous structure as to justify the belief that forests
of a species of pine once covered this district, where now no single
tree, having such character, is found to exist.
In closing the geological section of his volume. Count Strzelecki
gives a summary of facts, from which we extract the following-
results, as of practical importance to the agriculture of the two
colonies:?
? In New South Wales the space occupied by the crystalline is to
that of the sedimentary rocks as 3: 1. In Van Diemen?s Land it is
as 7 : 1.
? A classification of all the mineral masses, unstratified or stratified,
into two divisions, the one including rocks having more than GO per
cent, of silica, the other less than this per centage, shows
? 1. That in New South Wales the area of granite, protogene, quartz
rock, sienite, siliceous breccia, quartzose porphyry, siliceous slate, sand-
stone, and conglomerate, is to the area of eurite, feldspathic porphyry,
greenstone,


greenstone, and basaltic rocks, containing less than 60 j:er cent., as
4-1 : 1.
? 2. That in Van Diemen?s Land, on the contrary, the area of the
first division is to that of the second as 1 ; 3.?
This inverse ratio of siliceous to non-siliceous rocks in the two
colonies, while showing the larger scale of volcanic action in Van
Diemen?s Land, determines the relative agricultural character of
the soils of each : those of New South Wales better fitting it for a
pastoral, those of Van Diemen?s Land for an agricultural country.
We have elsewhere noticed the great paucity of simple minerals
among the rocks of New South Wales. Though we do not finer
it mentioned by our author, it would seem that there is an equal
scarcity of metallic ores, as might indeed be inferred from the
geological conditions of the country. More, however, may yet
be done by future discovery; and meanwhile we happily have
proof that other parts of our Australian possessions?as, for ex-
ample, the rising colony of South Australia?are better provided
in this important particular.
We have also alluded before to the singular configuration of
many parts of the mountain chain of New South Wales, owing
chiefly to the admixture, protrusion, and sub-ramification of
igneous rocks, throwing out rugged and abrupt spurs from each
side of the principal range. The difficulty and risks to the ex-
plorer from this cause are exceedingly great. Our author thus
describes them, in a part of the Blue Mountains to the west of
Sydney, where a great basaltic spur, by its ramifications, has
strangely disturbed and distorted the sandstone beds in this
locality: ?
* Between these ranges lie yawning chasms, deep winding gorges,
and frightful precipices. Narrow, gloomy, and profound, these stu-
pendous rents in the bosom of the earth are inclosed between gigantic
walls of sandstone rock, sometimes receding from, sometimes over-
hanging the dark bed of the ravine, and its black silent eddies, or
foaming torrents of water. Everywhere the descent into the deep recess
is full of danger, and the issue almost impracticable. Engulfed, in the
course of my researches, in the endless labyrinth of almost subterranean
gullies of Mount Hay, and the river Grose, I was not able to extricate
myself and my men until after days of incessant fatigue, danger, and
starvation.?
Sir T. Mitchell, the surveyor-general of the colony, amply
confirms this description in narrating the hazards encountered by
the surveyors in attempting to reach Mount Hay. Mr. Dixon,
one of them, penetrated to the valley of the Grose, until then un-
visited by man; and after being bewildered for four days in the
tortuous ravines around Mount Hay, without gaining access to
2 m 2 the


the mountain, he at length emerged in safety, * thanking God ? (to
use the words of his official letter) ? that he had found his way
out of them.?
In the following section of his work, our author treats of the
climate of these colonies, under the several heads of winds, atmos-
pheric pressure, rain and evaporation, dew and moisture, solar
and terrestrial radiation, and temperature. To these subjects his
attention has been industriously and accurately devoted ; and fully
appreciating the value of the method of averages, from which
modern science has acquired so much both of extension and certi-
tude, he refers, with just satisfaction, to amass of 108,000 numerical
elements, the results of as many particular observations ; of which
more than 17,000 were contributed by himself, during the five
years he passed in the country. Without following all the details
of this very valuable part of his work, we take a few of the more
important facts and inferences from it. The subject is well
known to be one of singular complexity, from the many elements
of power simultaneously concerned, each separately active, each
modified in action by the changes which are mutual and continual
among all.
As respects the winds and atmospheric currents, out of a great
mass of observations, principally derived from the meteorolo-
gical register of Port Macquarrie, Port Jackson, Port Phillip,
and Port Arthur, the conclusions are established that the
winds, in veering, follow constantly one course, viz., from the
right to the left of the meridian facing the equator; and that
both as regards the rotation of winds, and their effect on the
barometer, thermometer, pluviometer, and hygrometer, the phe-
nomena are the reverse of what occur in the opposite hemisphere,
confirming the law laid down by Professor Dove, in his ? Mete-
orologische Untersuchungen,? to this effect.
Some very remarkable discrepancies in the prevailing winds of
the several seasons at Port Jackson, Port Phillip, and Van Die-
men?s Land, are successfully traced to the influence of monsoons
and winds which are found to exist within a certain distance of
Australia. By projecting the direction of these, according to the
limits which Horsburgh, Flinders, and King assign to them, it is
found that the littoral of New Holland is surrounded by an exterior
belt of atmospheric circulation, varying with the seasons as regards
its direction, but constant in motion and intensity, and necessarily
imparting to the atmosphere within this circuit certain regular
eddies, similar to those observed in the sea or large rivers, and
according with the actual results of observation.
The most singular phenomenon connected with the winds of
New South Wales and Van Diemen?s Land is that which is
called


called in the colonies the hot wind; and filly so named, since it
raises the mean temperature of a summer day 40� Fahr. on the
western side of the mountain chain, and 25� to 30� on the eastern.
Ihe mean direction of this wind is from the north-west; its ve-
locity often exceeds that of a gale; its motion on the surface, as
shown by bodies floating in the air, appears sometimes as if pro-
duced by rotation on a set of horizontal axes; at other times as
resulting from a ricochet movement, and blowing by puffs. It is
intensely dry, all clouds and vapours suddenly disappearing by
absorption on its approach. The ordinary mean of evaporation
of water in three hours being 0045 of an inch, under the hot
wind in the same time it reaches O'lso. It has been felt at the
height of 5000 feet. Its common duration does not exceed ten
hours, and it occurs but twice or thrice in the year. Though the
wind is so hot in itself, the intensity of the solar radiation, as
shown by a blackened thermometer, is materially lessened in
passing through it.
? The influence of this wind on vegetation, both indigenous and exotic,
is extremely injurious. All the graminece and leguminoscc are parched
by it, and the fruit of the Ficus Australis , as well as of the vine, is
destroyed. The red and blue grape lose their colour, and their watery
elements; the green leaves turn yellow and wither; the quality of the
crops is generally deteriorated, and whole fields of promising wheat and
potatoes are often laid waste Its effects on the human consti-
tution partake of the character of those produced in Egypt by the sirocco
or simoom ; ?a feverish heat, and determination of blood to the head,
and in those subject to disorders of the lungs, a restrained action in
breathing, at times bordering on suffocation, are symptoms confined to
the whites alone. The suppressed perspiration, or rather its rapid
evaporation, the relaxation of the muscles and vessels, inflammatory
attacks, affections of the glottis, and ophthalmia, are common both to the
aborigines and European races.?
It is clear that this wind, whatever its local modifications as
generated or blowing over the continent of New Holland, is con-
nected, in causes and phenomena, with the hot winds (however
designated in different countries) which are known to us in Egypt
and other parts of Africa, in Arabia, Central Asia, and different
parts of the American continent. What these causes are, the
present state of meteorological knowledge does not allow us fully
to determine. That the great atmospheric agent, electricity, is
largely 7 concerned, we cannot doubt, from our own observation as
well as that of others. M. Strzelecki does not give us any direct
facts bearing on this point, as regards the hot wind of Australia;
but in describing the zone of this wind as ? a huge electric appa-
ratus, highly charged,? he assents to the general probability of the
theory?connecting it at the same lime with an observation on
these


these atmospheric currents ?which Humboldt, with his wonted
ingenuity, was the first to fertilize, and to raise into the class of
scientific causes. We allude to the fact of such currents of air
being generally charged, more or less, with fine earthy particles,
or impalpable dust, all containing a notable portion of
metallic matter. An atmosphere thus charged may have its
temperature raised by the agency of these particles in reflecting
or radiating heat, while at the same time it is very probable that its
electric conditions may be altered and excited by the friction
and mutual actions taking place in a current thus composed, and
moving so rapidly over the surface.*
In treating of atmospheric pressure, our author gives tables
showing the mean pressure and mean barometrical oscillations,
for the winter and summer seasons of five successive years, at five
different stations, reduced to 32 G Fahr. Computing the mean
diurnal variation from the phases of barometrical oscillation,
which are ascertained to be nine in number, in the twenty-four
hours, this is found to be only 0085. The monthly maxima
and minima of oscillation exhibit greater differences in winter
than in summer. The amplitude of oscillation uniformly dimi-
nishes in proceeding northwards from Port Arthur, the extreme
south, to Port Jackson, the extreme north of the extent included
in the observations ; according in this with the general fact of the
decrease of oscillation from the pole to the equator in every part
of the globe.
Except in confirming the general and intimate connexion of
the winds with barometrical variations, we are not aware that the
observations made in New Holland have yet done much to solve
the perplexing phenomena of atmospheric pressure. It is clearly
ascertained from the data furnished by Flinders and King, as
well as by M. Strzelecki, that the barometer rises with the winds
blowing from the pole, and falls with those from the equator, in
conformity with the law to this effect established by Dove and
Kiimtz for the northern hemisphere. We understand, but without
knowing details, that Sir James Ross, in his late antarctic expedi-
tion, ascertained the existence of a permanently low barometrical
pressure in high southern latitudes, inferior by more than a de-
* ? Mais Pair de Toasis de Mourzouk, n?est il pas constamment charge de poussiere,

M. Strzelecki relates that on one occasion, when sailing from New Zealand to Sydney,
he was prevented for two days from making Port Jackson by the violence of the hot
wind, which, at sixty miles from the shore, had a temperature above 90�. The lee
sails and reefs of the vessel were covered with an impalpable dust, at first mistaken for
ashes, but on examination proving to be a sand, containing J of aluminous and \ of
siliceous and metallic matter.


r/ree to the mean pressure between the tropics?one of the many
interesting results which this memorable voyage will hereafter, as
we trust, place before us.
The other meteorological topics of solar radiation and tempera-
ture, rain, humidity and dew, are handled by our author with the
same perspicuity and abundance of tabular details. It appears
that the intensity of solar rays is greater in New South Wales than
in Van Diemen?s Land; but that owing to the more diaphanous
atmosphere of the latter colony, the register of a blackened ther-
mometer there yields higher numerical results than in the sister
country. A curious inquiry follows, illustrated by numerous ex-
periments on the relative power of absorption and emission of solar
heat which the different soils of the two colonies possess; and prov-
ing that those derived from the disintegration chiefly of siliceous
rocks, as in New Holland, have a low absorbing and a high radi-
ating power; while the soils derived principally from greenstone,
basalts, serpentine, &c,, as in Van Diemen?s Land, have a high
absorption and low radiation. The injuries which these con-
ditions would respectively produce upon the climate of the two
colonies are shown to be admirably obviated by the influence of
vegetation ; which, differing in each from the difference of the
soils, modifies greatly the radiation of their respective surfaces.
The whole of this inquiry, as well as that which follows, on
the influence of the same physical causes upon the hygrometrical
condition, the moisture, dew, and evaporation in these colonies,
contains much that is new and valuable in itself, and suggestive of
similar inquiries in other and older countries, where such facts
ought to be better known to us.
The numerical data, furnished from six different stations, and
including 8730 days? show that the amount of rain is
greater in New South Wales than in Van Diemen?s Land, pro-
bably in connexion with the general law of increase in quantity
of rain from the pole to the equator; and that both colonies re-
ceive a considerably larger amount than the average for England;
48 inches falling annually in New South Wales, and 41 inches in
Van Diemen?s Land. The greatest fall recorded at Sydney
within twenty-four hours amounted to 25 inches; but further to
the west the rains seem to be more violent as well as abundant,
producing sudden and extraordinary inundations.
The temperature of these colonies, illustrated also by valuable
tables, is an object of much interest, looking not merely to their
present population and culture, but yet more to the future state of
countries thus rapidly rising into greatness. The results of ob-
servation, according well with those derived from the practical
experience of the colonists, are exceedingly favourable as respects
this


this point. Taking the four more important of the six stations
at which thermometrical registers have been kept, we find by
comparison with other localities of the globe that
Port Jackson (Sydney) has the summer of Avignon, Constan-
tinople, or Philadelphia; and a winter nearly similar to that of
Cairo or the Cape of Good Hope. Its fluctuations of tempera-
ture correspond with those of Paris; and its annual mean with
that of Messina in Sicily and the Cape of Good Hope.
Port Phillip, on the southern coast of Australia, resembles in
its summer Baden, Marseilles, and Bordeaux; in its winter
Palermo and Buenos Ayres. The fluctuations are those of Mont-
pelier, and the annual mean that of Naples.
Launceston (Van Diemen?s Land) in its summer resembles
Mannheim and Toulouse; in its winter and annual mean Lisbon
and Perpignan.
Port Arthur, the extreme southern station of Van Diemen?s
Land, possesses the summer of Dantzic, Augsburgh, and Jena,
with a winter like that of Smyrna.
Such conditions of temperature are manifestly very favourable
to equality of climate, while yet leaving sufficient range and di-
versity for the various exigences of cultivation. Accordingly we
find that these colonies possess all the elements needful to the
vigorous growth and extension of animal and vegetable life. On
this subject we give our author?s own words:?
? Independently, however, of comparison and analogies, the climatic
condition of New South Wales and Van Diemen?s Land is represented
in the most favourable light by its rich Flora, and by the healthy condi-
tion of its aborigines and its indigenous animals. Looking, indeed, at
the singular and distinctive features by which its organic life is charac-
terized, making this continent, as it were, a world apart, we cannot but
wonder that the same climate, under which that life appears, should be
likewise so well adapted to the maintenance of the vegetation and the
animals of other hemispheres. The effect produced by the appearance
of the plantain growing in company with the vine, apple, peach, and the
English oak, and then again flourishing in the close vicinity of the
Eucalyptce and Mimosce , is indeed surprising; nor is it less surprising
to behold the kangaroo, sheep, emu, and horned cattle roaming together
in the same forest, and seeking sustenance from the same herbage.
? But what mainly illustrates the fertility and salubrity of both these
countries is the healthiness of the English settlers who have taken root
on the soil. No endemic disease, and seldom any epidemic of grave
character prevails ; and if individual indisposition, or even partial dete-
rioration of the progeny is sometimes seen, it is to be traced to the per-
tinacity with which the English race cling to their original modes of
living, wherever they settle, and however different their adopted may be
from their native climate. It is to the abuse of strong wines, malt
liquors,


liquors, and spirits, and particularly to the excessive consumption of
animal food of the richest description, and even to the mode of clothing
and housing, that individual diseases, such as dyspepsia, premature
decay of teeth, and affections of the brain, may be attributed. 5
The effect of extended cultivation in these colonies must be
presumed to be that of rendering the climate hotter and drier?
an ambiguous advantage, if not a certain injury, and one which
may require further refinements in agriculture to give protection
against it. The removal of dense forests and thick herbaceous
underwood, and the creation of 280,000 acres of cultivated land,
cannot be effected without many changes of atmospheric con-
dition, as well as of the surface of the land itself.
Th e fifth section of the work relates to the Botany, the sixth to
the Zoology of the Colonies, each division including respectively
the fossil as well as the existing species. It might have been a
better arrangement, and avoided some repetitions, if these sections
had followed immediately that on Geology. As respects the
existing species of plants, our author does not add to the cata-
logue of the Flora Australis, carried by the labours of Mr. Brown
and the earlier explorers to 4000 species, and since enlarged
by the addition of about 2000 more. His description of the
general character and effect of Australian vegetation on the land-
scape is striking and well executed. The fossil plants hitherto
collected by him and others are few in number, and derived
almost exclusively from the coal formation and sandstone super-
incumbent upon it; or from a yellow limestone at Hobart Town,
which furnishes the impressions of some unknown species of vege-
tation. We have already noticed the fossil plants of the coal
strata, the specimens of which, brought home by M. Strzelecki,
are minutely described. Though related in certain genera to the
carboniferous fossils of the other hemisphere, yet are they so new
and unlike in character as fully to maintain the singularity of
New Holland, even in these vestiges of a former condition of the
globe.
The Zoology of this region, as it relates both to fossil and ex-
isting species, is a subject justifying more details than we have
space to give. One notable circumstance in the fossil Fauna is
the extraordinary paucity of genera, species, and individuals in the
rocks of the country, though the three great divisions of Yertc-
brata, Radiata, and Mollusca are all in one degree or other repre-
sented, with traces also of the Articulata. Our author, whose col-
lections have considerably added to the number, divides them into
such as correspond to the Palaeozoic series, and those which may
be considered to belong to the Pleiocene period. The specimens
he collected of the Polyparia have been examined and described
h y


by Mr. Lonsdale, those of the Mollusca by Mr. Morris. Many
of these are figured in plates at the end of the volume. Some few
of the species seem to be identical with those of other countries ;
others allied to or representative of them; ?many important
genera, found largely in the corresponding deposits of Europe,
are altogether wanting. The Fossil Mammalia are all recog-
nised as belonging to the order of Marsupialia, a very curious
evidence of the vast periods of time during which this type has
prevailed in the Australian continent. They are referred to
seven genera, two of which, the Diprotodon and Nototherium,
are new to naturalists. We owe to the sagacity of Mr. Owen
the definition of these animals; the description of which, derived
from four specimens only of bones brought to England, is
adorned, as we may well express it, by all the felicity of infer-
ence and illustration which belongs to this pre-eminent ob-
server. From the astragalus of one of them, named the Noto-
therium inerme, is drawn the evidence of a marsupial vegetable-
feeder as large as a rhinoceros; thus attesting here, as elsewhere,
the ancient existence and subsequent annihilation of enormous
representatives of the animal type still existing in the country.
We recognise the same phenomenon and principle of change
under the great diversity of objects which are submitted to it.
Of the recent Fauna a full catalogue is given, in which the dis-
coveries of Mr. Gould among the Australian birds have a con-
spicuous part. As far as we know, the examination of these and
of the mammalia may be deemed nearly complete. In other
divisions there are still great deficiencies, as proved in the in-
stance of the fishes, of which not more than sixty species are
known to us. We cannot do more than slightly allude to the
later researches of Mr. Owen on the Ornithorhynchus; in which,
by showing its affinity to the reptiles in its generative system,
and to extinct species of the Ichthyosaurus in certain parts of
structure, he has added to the number of those anomalies which
had already rendered this animal a problem and a paradox to
zoologists.
The seventh section treats of the Aborigines of New South
Wales and Van Diemen?s Land ?a race, or races, destined to
future and not distant annihilation before the tide of white men
setting in upon their country. In the latter colony they are
already extinct by death or removal, after many bloody struggles
with the worst part of the new settlers. On the coast of New
South Wales but a few straggling families or individuals remain,
and the same changes are every year carried further within the
country. Take the best view we can of this matter and its conse-
quences, there yet is something melancholy in the spectacle of a
branch


branch of the human race ?well defined in its characters, though
obscure in origin and rude in its manner of life?being thus re-
moved for ever from the face of the earth. Count Strzelecki,
whose whole work gives proof of warm and generous feelings, and
whose mode of travel carried him much among the native tribes,
after depicting their habits, faculties, and acquirements in more
favourable terms than other writers, breaks out here with some
eloquence:?
* The manifold calamities, but more particularly the decrease and final
annihilation of the great majority of indigenous races which has fol-
lowed, and always does follow, the approach of the whites ?is a fact
of such historical notoriety that the melancholy instance of the Austra-
lian natives affords but a further corroboration of the fearfully destructive
influence which the one race exercises upon the other. Those in whose
eyes the question of decrease and extinction has assumed all the mourn-
ful interest and solemnity which it merits, have inquired into the nature
of that invisible but desolating influence which, like a malignant ally of
the white man, carries destruction wherever he advances; and the in-
quiry, like an inquest of the one race upon the corpse of the other, has
ended for the most part with the verdict of ? Died hy the visitation of
God? ?
Not satisfied with this vague decision, and collating the evi-
dence from his own direct examination of the aborigines of dif-
ferent countries, as well as from the reports of others, our author
throws out a bolder view of his own; ?viz. that the longevity has
not been abridged in those native races, nor the rate of mortality
increased, but that the power of continuing the species with males
of their own race appears to be curtailed in many cases, if not in
all, by intercourse of the aboriginal females with the European
settlers. We cannot follow him into this topic; though admitting
that the latter suggestion accords with some curious facts of
modern physiology, and merits further investigation. But, ex-
cept with more evidence than is given us, we must refuse assent
to the previous assertions; and believe still, as heretofore, that the
introduction of new diseases and new agents of disease?both
more pernicious in their novelty?does materially increase the
mean mortality among those races, and tend with other causes to
their eventual extirpation.
The last and perhaps the most important topic in this volume,
is the Agriculture of the colonies; and here again we have to
commend largely the industry and various knowledge of M. de
Strzelecki, who has given us the results of his examination into
the physical and chemical characters of forty-one different soils,
from the same number of colonial farms, illustrating thereby


not merely tlie conditions of these particular localities, but all
that relates to the causes of the fertility or sterility of soils in
general. Three kinds of soils were selected from each farm;
the best, the worst, and that which the occupier noted as a
particular soil each being then examined as to its situation,
exposure, external characters, and the methods under which it
was cultivated. Its physical characters were next determined?
the power of absorption of solar rays, of emission of heat,
and of absorption of atmospheric water. Lastly came the che-
mical examination of the soil; first, by determining the amount
of soluble matter in 100 parts; secondly, by determining the
proximate constituents of the same. In sequel to these separate
details, the results of the whole are given in a tabular form, with
practical conclusions annexed to them. The recital of these
methods will justify our praise of M. Strzelecki?s enlightened
industry, and may perchance suggest similar means in application
to soils more familiar to us.
We have already noticed the difference of the rocky materials
of the two colonies, and their influence upon the soils?those of
New South Wales containing one-third less of soluble matter?
more silica, and a smaller quantity of alkalies and salts ?than the
soils of Van Diemen?s Land. Compared, indeed, with the virgin
soils of many other countries, as the Linked States, Canada,
Mexico, Brazil, both are greatly inferior in their saline ingre-
dients, and proportionally less fertile. But to this condition the
indigenous vegetation of the country is admirably adapted. The
Australian grasses are less alkaline than ours, and do not require
the same richness of soil. The which cover the country
can, by shedding their bark, dispense with the annual supply of
alkali which trees shedding their leaves extract from the soil. It
appears from comparative analysis that artificial culture has
already been injurious in diminishing the organic constituents of
the soils, as well as in altering their relation to the external agents
of heat and moisture. These are points which it belongs to the
future progress of agriculture to recognise and remedy.
The pastoral portion of these colonies is, perhaps, the most
important, as well as most striking and characteristic. There is
nothing here, either in mountain, plain, or forest land, which can
recall the memory of any other region of the earth. The Aus-
tralian Alps, at the height of more than 5000 feet, are as rich in
the peculiar herbage of the country as the plains below. The
Eucalypta?, vast as they are in growth, do yet, from the pecu-
liarity of their trunks and leaves, throw very little shade on the
ground underneath; and the forests are scarcely less luxuriant
than the open land in grasses fitted for pasture. The result of
these


these circumstances, as regards sheep-breeding in particular, has
been very remarkable. Hardly thirty years have elapsed since
the first ram was imported into New South Wales, and the
number of sheep now in the colony amounts to about nine mil-
lions! The simple economy of the stock-farms gave facility to
their spread into the interior. The dividing chain of mountains
was crossed, and the great plains beyond speedily covered with
vast and growing flocks; not so much led by, as guiding their
shepherds through these new and luxuriant pastures of the west.
But evils grew up at the same time under a system thus loose
and inartificial. The wool-growers of New South Wales were,
in great part, men drawn from other occupations?many of them
from the army and navy?ignorant of all but the high price of
wool in England, and the expediency of increasing rapidly their
number of sheep to take advantage of it. The pastures, first
along the coast, afterwards on the western side of the mountains,
became overstocked and exhausted of their herbage under the
system of licensed squatting which prevailed;?occasional burn-
ings, to produce fresh growth, did but increase the mischief?
disease, from deficient management, came among the flocks?
labourers and capital were more scantily supplied from home
?while the fall in the price of wool in England, and the diffi-
culties of the colonial currency, added to the general embarrass-
ment. The years 1843 and 1844 were a crisis, agricultural and
commercial, in the history of the colony, from which it is but just
recovering. In Van Diemen?s Land, where, from smaller space,
properties are better defined, and the system of squatting upon
licence not practised, there has been less of suffering from these
causes. But neither here nor in New South Wales do we find yet
much improvement in the management of sheep, or of pastoral
land. The methods of breeding and rearing continue the same,
and little is known as to the fitting rotation on pasture-ground.
Great scope then exists for change and amelioration; but here,
as in difficulties of more serious kind, we may safely confide in the
energy of colonists who have already won to themselves a great
country, and clothed it with so much of European verdure and
civilization.
One of the most obvious improvements in the sheep-farming
of these colonies will be to reduce the flocks while increasing
the quantity of their produce of wool; a combination of objects
which experience elsewhere has taught us to be perfectly practi-
cable. The Count, looking to the quality of the pasture, recom-
mends six acres as an average annual run for each sheep ; these
runs to be properly divided and apportioned, not solely for the
sake of more equal pasturage, but also to provide for the due
assortment


assortment of the sheep in breeding and rearing?points of infi-
nite moment. Another important improvement will be the clear-
ing away the vast quantity of dead timber which encumbers the
ground, not merely obstructing vegetation, but taking off good
wool from the fleeces as the sheep pass. And a further and
great gain may be made by promoting the wilful burning of the
sheep-runs by the shepherds ; a point of more than ordinary
consequence under the peculiarities of Australian surface and
vegetation.
In passing from the wild pastoral regions to those of tillage, a
complete change occurs both of landscape and human habits?
more strongly marked here than in most other countries. In
New South Wales 120,000 acres have now been brought under
the plough; in Van Diemen?s Land about 160,000 acres.
Wheat, barley, oats, maize, English grasses, potatoes, turnips,
&c., have been objects of cultivation from the first; tobacco was
early introduced; and more recently the vine, with eminent pros-
pects of success. The mode of working the land and the im-
plements are the same as in England, as far as local circum-
stances allow; and, as in England, much room is open for
improvements in draining and irrigation, manuring and rotation
of crops.
The farms of the Australian Agricultural Company, in the
most northern part of New South Wales, are cited by our author
as the first in the scale of advancement. Here the banana grows
by the side of the English oak, and both are surrounded by
vines, orange and lemon trees, all flourishing and fruitful. The
great agricultural district to the southward of Port Stephen,
2000 square miles in extent, is one of the richest and most
thriving in the colony, and embraces many excellent farms.
Nearer to Sydney the estates of the M?Arthurs (a family long
and beneficially known in the history of the colony) are little in-
ferior in excellence of cultivation to those of the Australian Com-
ply- . . , ,
We have already seen that the rocks and soils of Van Die-
men?s Land, as well as other circumstances, render it better
fitted for tillage than New South Wales; and accordingly we
find the great valley districts of this island rapidly advancing in
profitable cultivation, while showing, at the same time, vast capa-
bilities of further improvement. The vale of the Tamar is the
largest and richest of these; having with its branches a superfi-
cial extent of about 3000 square miles, 40 miles of inland navi-
gation for vessels of 600 tons, good macadamised roads, an excel-
lent soil, and great capacities for irrigation. The farm of Mona
Vale in this district, the property of Mr. Kermode, is one of the
finest


finest in the country, though yet inferior in many points to the
well-managed farms of the Van Diemen?s Land Company. As
a general description of this flourishing island we may well quote
the words of our author :
1 In Van Diemen?s Land the agricultural districts are superior in
appearance to those of New South Wales. The details of farms and
farming are better understood and defined; and the practical results
are such, that no country reminds the traveller so much of the old one
1 ?*
as Van Diemen?s Land. There the tasteful and comfortable mansions
and cottages, surrounded by pleasure-grounds, gardens, and orchards, ?
the neat villages and prominently placed churches, forming, as it were,
the centres of cultivated plains, divided and subdivided by hedge-rows,
and through which an admirably constructed road winds across the
island, ?are all objects which forcibly carry back the mind to similar
scenes of rural beauty in England and Scotland.?
Here we must close our examination of this valuable work.
Whether read in this country or not, we can venture to guarantee
to it an assured place, present and perspective, in the libraries of
Australia. M. Strzelecki apologizes in the preface for his style,
as ? foreign and unidiomatic.? In this we wholly differ with him.
His language throughout is clear and vigorous, and, as our ex-
tracts will have shown, possesses the English idiom in a degree
very remarkable for a foreigner. We shall be exceedingly glad

TVTE believe that we shall be able ?we are sure that there are
* * superabundant materials ?to demolish utterly and irre-
trievably M. Thiers? credit as an historian. Whatever of praise
may be due to lively talents and great art, exclusively and without
exception or scruple employed to misrepresent and falsify en cjros
et en detail every subject he touches, we will not deny him : but
we most deliberately and conscientiously believe, and shall, we
trust, produce sufficient evidence to convince our readers, that in
the


the fourteen octavo volumes of his Histories now before u
is not one single page ?hardly one line?of sincere and
terated truth.
We may seem to owe an apology to our readers for not
sooner undertaken this task?but we have both reason ar
cedent for our silence. We find that our most popular 1
contemporary ?calling itself, we know not why. Revue dt
Mondes ?prefaces an article of the current year on M.
historical works, written by M. Sainte-Beuve, of the A
Frangaue, an avowed friend and panegyrist of M. Thiers, a
confession of a similar neglect. When he whom a party
our neighbours affect to call a great historian, and still gre
nister, and who is, in a peculiar degree, f the child and cha
of the Revolution, has been apparently so overlooked by
critical coterie, the inattention of London reviewers mig
for venial. But in truth there has been no neglect of M,
work on either side of the Channel. It attracted early a
siderable notice by its lively style, and a certain air of orl
and pretence of candour which he had the tact and tj
assume ; but in spite of this varnish, the peculiar circurl
and patronage under which it made its appearance, and t'l
in which it was written, gave it the character?not of a|
and conscientious history?but? of a bookseller?s speculil
the state of political parties in France. No one, in fact!
upon it in any other light than as a branch of the I
conspiracy then at work against the elder Bourbons?-I
doxical apology for the old Revolution, and a covert prcl
to a new one ; and this was, we are satisfied, its chief if
though there was of course something of literary ambil
something more of pecuniary speculation mixed up will

of two volumes bore the joint names of A. Thiers ail
Bodin Bodin being a young litterateur employed by t|
sellers in manufacturing a series of historical abridgmcl

Thiers into this species of manufacture. The account!
