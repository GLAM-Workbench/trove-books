MEMORANDUM OF THE GOVERN-
MENT OF THE U.S.S.R. ON THE
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
bn March 31 the Government of the Soviet Union sent through its
Ambassadors the following memorandum on the North Atlantic
Treaty to the Governments of the United States of America, Great
Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg and
Canada:
ON March 18 the State Department of the United States
published the text of the North Atlantic Treaty which
the Governments of the United States of America, Great
Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg and
Canada intend to sign within the next few days.
The text of the North Atlantic Treaty fully confirms what
was said in the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of the U.S.S.R. of January 29 this year, which is being attached
hereto, both as regards the aggressive aims of this Treaty and
the fact that the North Atlantic Treaty contradicts the prin-
ciples and" aims of the United Nations Organisation and the
commitments which the Governments of the United States of
America, Great Britain and France have assumed under other
Treaties and Agreements.
The statements contained in the North Atlantic Treaty, that
it is designated for defence and that it recognises the principles
of the United Nations Organisation, serve aims which have
nothing in common either with the tasks of self-defence of the
parties to the Treaty or with real recognition of the aims and
principles of the United Nations Organisation.
Such great Powers as the United States, Great Britain and
France are parties to the North Atlantic Treaty. Thus the
Treaty is not directed either against the United States of
America, Great Britain or France. Of the great Powers only
the Soviet Union is excluded from among the parties to this
Treaty, which can be explained only by the fact that this Treaty
is directed against the Soviet Union. The fact that the North
Atlantic Treaty is directed against the U.S.S.R. as well as against
the countries of people’s democracy was definitely pointed out


also by official representatives of the United States of America,
Great Britain and France.
To justify the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty, refer-
ences are being made to the fact that the Soviet Union has
defensive Treaties with the countries of peopleâ€™s democracy.
These references, however, are utterly untenable.
All the Treaties of the Soviet Union on friendship and mutual
assistance with the countries of peopleâ€™s democracy are of a
bilateral nature, and they are directed solely against a possible
repetition of German aggression, the danger of which not a
single peace-loving State can forget. The possibility of inter-
preting them as Treaties which are in any degree aimed against
the allies of the U.S.S.R. in the late war, against the United
States or Great Britain or France, is absolutely precluded.
Moreover, the U.S.S.R. has similar Treaties against a repeti-
tion of German aggression not only with the countries of people's
democracy, but also with Great Britain and France.
In contradistinction to this, the North Atlantic Treaty is not
a bilateral, but a multilateral Treaty, which creates a closed
grouping of States and, what is particularly important, abso-
lutely ignores the possibility of a repetition of German aggres-
sion, consequently not having as its aim the prevention of a
new German aggression. And inasmuch as of the great Powers
which comprised the anti-Hitlerite coalition only the U.S.S.R.
is not a party to this Treaty, the North Atlantic Treaty must be
regarded as a Treaty directed against one of the chief allies of
the United States, Great Britain and France in the'late war,
against the U.S.S.R.
Participants in the North Atlantic Treaty are effecting ex-
tensive military measures which can in no way be justified by
the interests of self-defence of these countries. The extensive
military measures carried out by the United States in co-opera-
tion with Great Britain and France under the present peace-
time conditions, including the increase in all types of armed
forces, the drafting of a plan for the utilisation of the atomic
weapon, the stock-piling of atom bombs, which are purely an
offensive weapon, the building of a network of air and naval
bases, etc. â€”bear a by no means defensive character.
The preservation in Washington of the combined Anglo-
American Staff organised during the Second World War, the
recent establishment of the military staff of the so-called
Western Union in Fontainebleau (France), as well as the inten-
tion immediately to set up the defence committee envisaged by
the North Atlantic Treaty, are by no means an indication of the
peace-loving or defensive aims of the participants of the Treaty,


but, together with other numerous military preparations, con-
tribute to intensifying anxiety and alarm and to the whipping
up of war hysteria in which all sorts of instigators of a new
war are so interested.
The North Atlantic Treaty is designed to intimidate the States
which do not agree to obey the dictate of the Anglo-American
grouping of Powers that lay claim to world domination, though
the bankruptcy of such claims was once again affirmed by the
Second World War, which ended in the debacle of fascist Ger-
many which also had laid claim to world domination.
Among the participants in the North Atlantic Treaty are also
countries whose Governments expect to benefit at the expense
of richer parties to the Treaty and make various plans with re-
gard to obtaining new credits and other material advantages.
At the same time one cannot but see the groundlessness of
the anti-Soviet motives of the North Atlantic Treaty, inasmuch
as it is known to all that the Soviet Union does not intend to
attack anyone and in no way threatens the United States of
America, Great Britain, France or the other parties to the
Treaty.
The conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty and the estab-
lishment of the new grouping of Powers is motivated by the
'weakness of the United Nations Organisation. It is perfectly
evident, however, that the North Atlantic Treaty does not serve
the cause of strengthening the United Nations Organisation, but
on the contrary leads to undermining the very foundations of
this international organisation, because the establishment of
the above grouping of Powers, far from corresponding to the
aims and principles of the United Nations Organisation, runs
counter to the Charter of this organisation.
The parties to the North Atlantic Treaty maintain that this
Treaty allegedly represents a regional arrangement envisaged
by Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. But such references
are utterly groundless and untenable. There can be no question
whatsoever of any regional character of this Treaty, inasmuch
as the union provided for by this Treaty embraces States located
in both hemispheres of the globe and it has not as its aims the
settlement of any regional issues. This is also confirmed by the
fact that, as has already been announced, States which are not
members of the United Nations Organisation (Italy, Portugal)
are being drawn into participation in the North Atlantic Treaty,
whereas Article 52 of the United Nations Charter has in view
the conclusion of regional arrangements only among members
of the United Nations Organisation.
Nor can the establishment of the North Atlantic grouping


of States be justified by the right of each member of the United
Nations to individual or collective self-defence in conformity
with Article 51 of the Charter. Suffice it to say that such a
right under the Charter of the United Nations can arise only
in the case of armed attack against a member of the organisa-
tion, whereas, as is known to all, neither the United States of
America, Britain, France nor the other parties to the Pact are
threatened by any armed attack.
It is clear that the references to Articles 51 and 52 of the
United Nations Charter are untenable and are designed merely
to cover up the real aggressive aims of the military grouping of
States which is being set up by the conclusion of the North
Atlantic Treaty.
No one can deny that the North Atlantic Treaty,' and first
and foremost Article 5 of this Treaty, directly contradicts the
Charter of the United Nations Organisation.
The text of Article 53 of the Charter, which speaks of en-
forcement actions under regional arrangements, states directly
that “no enforcement action shall be taken under regional
arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorisation
of the Security Council”, with the exception of measures
specially envisaged with regard to former enemy States. This
notwithstanding, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty
envisages the employment of armed force by the parties to the
Treaty without any authorisation of the Security Council.
Thus, even if the North Atlantic Treaty were to be considered
as a regional arrangement, Article 5 of this Treaty is incom-
patible with the United Nations Charter. This shows once more
how unfounded are all the references of the North Atlantic
Treaty to recognition of the principles and aims of the Charter
of the United Nations Organisation.
On the basis of all the above, the Soviet Government arrives
at the following conclusions:
1. The North Atlantic Treaty has nothing in common with
the aims of the self-defence of the States who are parties to the
Treaty, who are threatened by no one, whom no one intends to
attack. On the contrary, this Treaty has an obviously aggressive
character and is aimed against the U.S.S.R., which fact is not
concealed even by official representatives of the States who are
parties to the Treaty in their public pronouncements.
2. The North Atlantic Treaty not only does not contribute to
the consolidation of peace and international security, which is
the duty of all members of the United Nations Organisation, but
runs directly counter to the principles and aims of the United


Nations Charter and leads to undermining the United Nations
Organisation.
3. The North Atlantic Treaty runs counter to the Treaty be-
tween Great Britain and the Soviet Union signed in 1942, under
which both States assumed the obligation to co-operate in the
maintenance of peace and international security and â€œnot to con-
clude any alliance and not to take part in any coalition directed
against the other High Contracting Partyâ€~.
4. The North Atlantic Treaty runs counter to the Treaty be-
tween France and the Soviet Union signed in 1944, under which
both States assumed the obligation to co-operate in the mainten-
ance of peace and international security and â€œnot to conclude
any alliance and not to take part in any coalition directed against
either of the High Contracting Partiesâ€~.
5. The North Atlantic Treaty runs counter to the agreements
between the Soviet Union, the United States of America and
Great Britain concluded at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences,
as well as at other conferences of the representatives of these
Powers held both during and after the Second World War, under
which the United States of America and Great Britain, like the
Soviet Union, assumed the obligation to co-operate in the con-
solidation of general peace and international security and to
contribute to the consolidation of the United Nations Organi-
sation.


STATEMENT OF U.S.S.R. FOREIGN
MINISTRY ON NORTH ATLANTIC
PACT
ON JANUARY 14 the State Department of the United States
of America published a lengthy statement under the
resounding title: “Building Peace. Collective Security in the
North Atlantic Area.” That official document presents an out-
line of the United States’ position in regard to the so-called
“North Atlantic Pact,” concerning which the Government of the
United States of America, together with Canada, has been con-
ducting negotiations since last summer with the Governments
of Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxemburg.
While last year ruling circles of the five above-mentioned
West European Powers had on the pretext of collective defence,
under the patronage of the United States, created a military
political alliance, this year a far-reaching Anglo-American plan
for establishing a “North Atlantic Alliance” is being carried out
with the participation of the same European countries and
Canada, directly headed by the United States of America.
In his statement of January 20, President Truman declared
that the draft of the treaty of North Atlantic security, the offi-
cially proclaimed purpose of which is the desire to strengthen
security in the North Atlantic area, would soon be submitted
to the Senate for consideration.
1. WESTERN UNION—WEAPON OF THE AGGRESSIVE
ANGLO-AMERICAN BLOC IN EUROPE
IN March, 1948, a Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Collective
Defence was concluded in Brussels between Great Britain,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg, which laid
the foundation of the separate group of certain West European
States, known as the “Western Union.” It was envisaged that
certain other European countries, willing to adjust their policy
to the aims of the above group headed by Great Britain, would
be included in the Western Union.
It is likewise known that the founders of the Western Union
had from the very outset precluded the possibility of the parti-
cipation in that alliance of all the countries of people’s demo-
cracy and of the Soviet Union, and have thus disclosed that the


Western Union has not been formed with a view to uniting the
peace-loving European countries, nor in the interests of assur-
ing a durable peace in Europe generally, but with other ends in
view which have nothing in common with concern for strength-
ening peace and international security.
It is not fortuitous that statesmen of the member countries of
that group, beginning with the British Foreign Secretary,
Bevin, have been obliged to declare openly that the establish-
ment of the Western Union signifies an important change in the
policy of these countries —which could not be concealed when
the backstage preparations of that group had been completed.
It is easy to see that the establishment of the above alliance
means that the Governments of Great Britain, France and the
other participant countries have finally abandoned the policy
that was pursued by the democratic States which were members
of the anti-Hitler coalition during the Second World War, and
which aimed at consolidating the forces of all peace-loving
States in order to do away with Hitler aggression and fascism
and to prevent a resurgence of aggressive forces after the termi-
nation of the war.
The establishment of the Western Union signifies, in the first
place, a complete change in the policy of Great Britain and
France in regard to the German problem, and demonstrates a
renunciation by the Governments of those countries of the demo-
cratic and anti-aggressive policy in regard to Germany which
was adopted by the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences of the anti-
Hitler coalition Powers.
During the Second World War, the allies in the anti-Hitler
coalition were united not only by the will to win victory in the
war of liberation against Hitler Germany and fascism. They
were also united by the will to prevent, in future as well, the
German aggression that has unleashed two world wars within
the past decades.
Those noble aspirations found their expression in the deci-
sions of the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences. The Treaties of
Friendship and Mutual Assistance, concluded by the Soviet
Union with Britain in 1942 and with France in 1944 for terms of
twenty years, express the same policy aimed at preventing a
resurgence of aggressive Germany. It is perfectly clear that the
policy which found its expression in these and other similar
treaties conformed both to the interests of the signatories and
to the interests of all peace-loving nations of Europe.
The Soviet Union, now as before, strictly abides by this policy
—a policy in full conformity with the decisions of the Yalta
and Potsdam Conferences of the heads of the Governments of
the U.S.S.R., the United States, Great Britain, and of France,
which endorsed these decisions, a policy directed towards en-
suring a durable peace in Europe and preventing fresh aggres-


sion on the part of the state which had been the chief culprit in
unleashing two world wars.
The formation of the Western Union means that Great
Britain and France have renounced the above anti-aggressive
policy adopted at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, and that
these Powers have embarked upon a new policy, highly dan-
gerous for the peace-loving nations, with the purpose of estab-
lishing their domination over other nations of Europe, not
stopping at employing for these ends yesterday’s aggressor, who
has since the termination of the war become dependent on them.
Nothing else could explain why, though the Brussels Pact
mentions in passing a desire to prevent a resurgence of an
aggressive policy on Germany’s part, the Governments of Great
Britain and France at the present time, together with the
Government of the United States, strive to enlist and utilise
for their ends Western Germany, where old pro-Nazi and mili-
taristic elements of German reaction are more and more deeply
entrenching themselves in all sections of the administrative
machinery—with the help in the first place of the Anglo-
American occupation authorities.
The fact that this turn in policy of the West European States
has met with support and encouragement from the ruling
circles of the United States considerably aggravates the danger
of the political developments that have taken place in the above
European countries which have abandoned the policy of peace
and taken the path of preparing fresh aggression in Europe.
As distinct from all treaties of mutual assistance concluded
by the Soviet Union with other European States, including
Britain and France —treaties which are aimed at preventing the
possibility of fresh aggression on Germany’s part and thereby
promoting peace in Europe—the military alliance of the five
Western States has been set up not so much in regard to Ger-
many as with a view to employing the group of Western Powers
they have formed against States which were their allies in the
Second World War.
Aggressive statements are frankly made by a number of
statesmen of the Western countries, as well as in the Anglo-
American and French press, to the effect that the Western
Union has been established against the U.S.S.R. and the States
of people’s democracy, notwithstanding the fact that the peace-
ful policies of these countries are an indisputable and univer-
sally known fact. It is indisputable, then, that no matter how
hard they may try to conceal the true aims of the Brussels
Treaty, the establishment of the Western Union has nothing in
common with concern for the defence of these States.
Furthermore it has by now been made sufficiently clear that
on the pretext of preventing a situation that would endanger
the so-called “economic stability” of the signatories of that


Pact, they are preparing to employ military measures and every
kind of repression against the working class and the growing
democratic forces within those States, as well as against the
mounting liberation movement of the peoples in the colonies
and dependent countries.
It is not accidental that the Brussels Pact represents an alli-
ance of colonial Powers which, for the sake of preserving their
age-long privileges in the colonies, want to employ the newly
initiated military-political grouping in order to suppress the
national liberation movement in these colonies.
All. this lays particular emphasis on the anti-democratic and
reactionary aggressive nature of the Western Union.
The alliance of the five West European States represents a
military-political supplement to the economic association of
European countries that has been set up to carry through the
“Marshall plan” in Europe. Both these groupings of European
countries are steered by the ruling circles of the Anglo-
American bloc, which is anything but concerned with the attain-
ment of the genuine national-State or, at least, economic goals
of any of the countries participating in the above groupings—a
bloc whose purpose is to bolster up and further expand its own
strategic military and economic positions.
And just as the “Marshall plan” is not aimed at a genuine
economic revival of the European States, but serves as a means
of adjusting the policy and economy of the “Marshallised”
countries to the narrow, self-seeking and strategic-military
plans for Anglo-American domination of Europe, so has the new
group been formed not with a view to mutual assistance and
collective defence of the countries participating in the Western
Union —because, were the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements
observed, these countries would be threatened by no aggres-
sion whatever —but with a view to bolstering up and further
expanding the domineering influence of the Anglo-American
ruling circles, in Europe, and to subjugating to their narrow
interests the external and internal policies of the respective
European States.
The incompatibility of such political plans of the Anglo-
American bloc with concern for peace and with the realisation
of the principles of democracy in the European countries is per-
fectly clear. Hardly had the Western Union come into being last
March, than the ruling circles of the United States promptly
declared that this Union would be given every support. Such a
statement was perfectly natural, for those circles have every
reason to believe that the new grouping can nowhere escape
from them and will be entirely dependent on Anglo-American
plans of every sort. But to meet all contingencies, special Ameri-
can observers, whose role is quite understandable, were intro-
duced into the Western Union.


It is now clear to all that the faster and farther the countries
of the Western Union progress along the path of opposing the
countries of people’s democracy and the Soviet Union —a path
to which they are being persistently pushed by the policy of
the Anglo-American bloc —the more the West European Powers
will become politically and economically dependent on the ruling
circles of the United States, who are not in the least concerned
about the political independence and economic rebirth of the
European states.
As a result —inevitable and already observed at every turn —
will come an intensification of the contradictions both between
the United States and the countries of the Western bloc, and
amongst the West European grouping itself.
It is on neither a sound nor a firm basis of economic rebirth
that the new West European grouping has been set —a group-
ing which is of auxiliary significance in a way, if one bears in
mind the broader European grouping set up from among the
“Marshallised” countries. Far from rendering the countries par-
ticipating in the new grouping any substantial practical aid, this
grouping has in no way prevented the appearance of mounting
economic difficulties in many West European States, nor has it
prevented a tremendous growth of unemployment in some of
them, and it has not helped to open hopeful prospects for their
further economic progress.
The aggressive purposes of this grouping are further reflected
in the ever-increasing demands for greater armies and military
expenditures, and this increasingly undermines their chances
for further and stable economic advance. At the same time this
situation leads to an intensification of grave political difficulties
inside these States. And this at a time when the Soviet Union
and the countries of people’s democracy, which are taking only
the first steps in their socialist development, are moving along
the road of steady and rapid economic rehabilitation and ad-
vance, along the road of consolidating the democratic founda-
tions and political unity of the nations that have emancipated
themselves from reactionary oppressive regimes.
By now the Western Union has launched quite a number of
measures for giving itself structural shape. As far back as last
spring, following the formation of the Consultative Council,
a standing body of that Union comprising representatives of
the five States was set up in London. They have likewise set
up a Military Committee, and even a Western Union Defence
Staff comprising the Chiefs of Staff of the five States headed by
the British Field Marshal Montgomery, although the founders
of the Western Union cannot prove that there exists any danger
of aggression for their States.
The haste displayed in carrying through all these organi-
sational measures, including the institution of the Military


Staff, in the conditions of the present peaceful situation, in no
way testifies to a desire of the participants in the new grouping
to ensure a durable peace in Europe. The hasty manner of carry-
ing through all these measures rather shows that they pursue
the aim of bringing political pressure to bear on certain
European countries, including the Western part of Germany,
and by means of this publicity hullabaloo around all these
measures, to speed up the enlistment of these countries into the
Western group and at the same time to foment sense of alarm,
uncertainty and war hysteria in public circles of the European
States â€”this being at the present time one of the chief tactical
methods of promoting the Anglo-American blocâ€™s aggressive
policy in Europe.
Apart from setting up this new group in Europe, the ruling
circles of the United States and Great Britain have in the past
months been engaged in setting up a North Atlantic Alliance
comprising the same five West European States, Canada and
the U.S.A. The aims of the North Atlantic Alliance are much
more far-reaching than those of the West European grouping,
and it is quite easy to see that these aims are very closely inter-
woven with plans for the violent establishment of Anglo-
American world supremacy under the aegis of the United States
of America.
li. THE NORTH ATLANTIC PACT AND ANGLO-
AMERICAN PLANS FOR WORLD DOMINATION
IF the institution of the Western Union conforms to the aims of
the Anglo-American bloc in Europe, it is now already evident
that the West European grouping is but one link, and not the
main one, in the system of measures contained in the plans for
establishing Anglo-American world domination. While giving
Great Britain the chief place in the Western Union, leading
circles of the United States have every possibility of influencing
in the way they want the policy of the entire West European
grouping.
Nor should it be forgotten that the Treaty signed in Rio de
Janeiro by the countries of North and South America, which
assures the influence of ruling circles of the United States in
regard to the overwhelming majority "of these States, entered
into force at the end of last year.
The realisation of the Western Union in Europe and the
entering into force of the Inter-American Pact is regarded by
the State Department in the above-mentioned document as an
important prerequisite for promoting the policy of the United
States on a world-wide scale. And the North Atlantic Pact is
advanced as the chief instrument of this policy, with groupings
of the countries already created in Europe and in America be-


coming props of that Pact; from the very outset the ruling
circles of the United States have taken over control of this
entire business.
In its document entitled â€œCollective Security in the North
Atlantic Area,â€~ the State Department of the United States at-
tempts to present the North Atlantic Pact, which it had prepared,
as a regional agreement on matters of security among the
countries of the Northern Atlantic, thereby casting a veil over
the true nature and real significance of that Pact. Everybody
knows that the countries of the Northern Atlantic are not
threatened by any aggression, and this alone shows the incon-
sistency of the above-cited explanation of the need for such a
Pact.
In an endeavour to conceal still more deeply the true nature
and purpose of the North Atlantic Pact, the State Department
was obliged to resort to ridiculous inventions about the Soviet
Unionâ€™s â€œobstructionâ€~ in the United Nations and to deliberately
nebulous statements about the need â€œto meet a potential aggres-
sor with overwhelming force,â€~ this allegedly being the duty of
the special grouping of countries, with the United States at its
head, which cannot wait until the United Nations Organisation
will have become sufficiently strengthened.
The State Department was unable to conceal the hostile nature
of the North Atlantic Pact in regard to the Soviet Union and
the countries of peopleâ€™s democracy, and it resorted to all sorts
of murky hints about a â€œpotential aggressor.â€~
On the other hand, the State Department did not venture to
proclaim openly the anti-Soviet aims of the new treaty which it
had prepared, because the dissemination of slander about the ag-
gressiveness of the Soviet Unionâ€™s policy, in the eyes of world
public opinion, recoils ever more frequently against those who
resort to such mean methods of political struggle. The draft of
the North Atlantic Pact and the circumstances which attended
its preparation clearly revealed the drive for world domination
of the Anglo-American bloc.
Although the North Atlantic Pact envisages the participation
in it, as its nucleus, of the five European countries, Canada and
the United States, it is, however, clear to all that the leadership
in this affair belongs to the ruling circles of the United States of
America, who are now in-a bloc with the ruling circles of Great
Britain, as the strongest capitalist Power in Europe.
This being so, the North Atlantic Pact actually becomes the
chief instrument of the aggressive policy of the ruling circles of
the United States and Great Britain â€œon both sides of the
Atlantic,â€~ that is in both hemispheres, and thereby conforms
to the aggressive drive for. the establishment of Anglo-
American world domination, which, it will be remembered, was
proclaimed as the chief post-war task of the United States and


Great Britain in Churchill’s sensational speech in Fulton, de-
livered at an unusual gathering which took place under Presi-
dent Truman’s chairmanship.
Apart from the United States, Canada and the five West Euro-
pean countries, with such a “North Atlantic” State as Luxem-
burg included among them, the draft of the North Atlantic
Treaty provides for the inclusion in it of certain other States.
No small amount of talk and comment is going on at present
in this connection.
Some speak of inviting such countries as Sweden, Norway
and Denmark to participate in this Treaty, and refer to the
peculiar activity displayed in this affair by the Government of
Norway.* Some quarters suggest circumventing difficulties in
this respect by instituting a special Scandinavian pact, which
should not —according to these plans—prevent the Scandinavian
countries from being brought into the orbit of the States actually
guided by the “North Atlantic” grouping. They claim that the
possibility of Franco Spain, Portugal, Italy and even Turkey
participating in the North Atlantic Pact is being discussed, and
in doing so they evidently believe that this method will help in
solving the tasks of the leading grouping of the so-called
“Northern Atlantic.”
Alongside of this, the formation of a Mediterranean Union
or East Mediterranean Pact as an auxiliary instrument of the
“North Atlantic” grouping is being discussed.
Such plans for creating more and more separate groupings of
States under the aegis of the United States and Great Britain
still further stress the fact that the aims of the main imperialist
grouping, which is now being knocked together on the basis of
the North Atlantic Pact, are far from being of a regional nature,
but embody the claims of certain powers to domination in all
parts of the globe. This is likewise testified to by the project for
establishing a grouping of the countries of South Eastern Asia,
the practical implementation of which project was commenced
at the recent conference in Delhi (India), convened on the
pretext of discussing the Indonesian question.
It goes without saying, however, that the servile attitude of
certain leading persons in the Governments of these countries
will not suffice for the peoples of Asia to consent to embark on
the slippery path on to which they are being persistently goaded
by the Powers which have become entangled in colonial affairs,
and by their wealthy patrons.
All this shows that in building up the North Atlantic Union,
the ruling circles of the United States and Great Britain endea-
vour to drag into this affair, directly or otherwise, the greatest
possible number of States and thus to take them in hand. With
* See Supplement


this end in view they resort to every sort of means, permissible
and impermissible.
They resort to financial and other economic hand-outs. They
promise to improve the economic position of countries which,
however, under pressure of the “dollar policy,” are getting in-
creasingly involved in fresh economic difficulties. They scare
them with the non-existent menace of a “potential aggressor”
and at the same time resort to gross means of pressure on the
Governments of small States.
In one respect, however, the situation should be considered as
perfectly clear. Just as they had done when setting up the
Western Union, the inspirers of the North Atlantic Pact have
from the very outset precluded the possibility of the participa-
tion in that Pact of all the countries of people’s democracy and
of the Soviet Union, having given it to be understood that these
States cannot become a party to the Treaty and, moreover, that
the North Atlantic Pact is levelled precisely against the U.S.S.R.
and the countries of new democracy.
It is seen from all the above that the aims of the North
Atlantic Pact consist in the ruling circles of the United States
and Great Britain holding the reins in regard to the greatest
possible number of States, depriving them of the possibility
of pursuing an independent, national foreign and international
policy, and employing these States as auxiliary weapons for the
implementation of their aggressive plans directed towards
establishing Anglo-American world domination.
This being the case, the participation of the U.S.S.R. and of
the countries of new democracy in the North Atlantic Pact or in
other similar alliances of States, is out of the question. There
may have been a time when certain men thought that in the
post-war period they would succeed, by means of pressure and
threats of every sort, in pushing the Soviet Union off the socialist
road which it has chosen, since certain “wise men” calculated
that —as a result of the grave military and economic trials of
the. Second World War —the Soviet Union would become so
weakened as to be unable to cope independently with its domes-
tic difficulties and would be bound to abandon its socialist posi-
tion for the sake of obtaining economic support from the strong
capitalist Powers.
The absurdity of such calculations is evident to all of us; this,
however, does not preclude the existence of shortsighted calcu-
lations of every kind and of plans hostile to our Soviet Mother-
land. In the above-mentioned official document, the State
Department, was obliged to admit the failure of its attempts,
“during three years,” to secure an adjustment “in Soviet
policies.” This was said by the State Department evidently in
order to justify the present plans for the North Atlantic Alli-
ance, since it is no longer possible to conceal the anti-Soviet
nature of the “North Atlantic” grouping that is being set up.


It will be seen from the above that in point of fact the North
Atlantic Pact represents the most far-reaching expression of the
aggressive strivings of a narrow group of Powers, and first and
foremost an expression of the strivings of the ruling circles of
the United States and Great Britain, which would like, in one
way or another, to adjust to these ends the policy of the
Governments of Other States that are submissive to or directly
dependent on them.
It is perfectly clear, too, that both the Western Union and the
inter-American grouping of States, just like the pacts of the
Mediterranean States, the Scandinavian countries, the countries
of South-Eastern Asia, etc., which are now being engineered, are
closely bound up with the aims of the North Atlantic Pact, which
serves as a guiding line in the Anglo-American plans for the
establishment of domination in Western Europe, and in the
Northern Atlantic, and in South America, and in the Mediter-
ranean, and in Asia, and in Africa, and everywhere that one’s
hands can reach.
One cannot help realising, however, that it is one thing to
construct all sorts of groupings and to be collecting signatures to
more and more pacts, cooked up in the chancelleries of the
American State Department and British Foreign Office, and an
entirely different thing, of course, really to achieve the ends
pursued by the inspirers of such groupings and pacts. But the
setting up of such groupings and the signing of pacts cannot, of
course, eliminate the numerous contradictions and the friction
actually existing among the countries signatory to these pacts.
The appearance of these pacts does not weaken the contra-
dictions even among the chief partners within the Apglo-
American bloc, because the aggressive aspirations of the two
powers clash with each other at every turn. The less possible
it is then to reconcile, by signing various pacts, the conflicting
interests of the big and small countries participating in these
groups, under conditions when one of the partners or one group
of States is eager to miss no opportunity of profiting at the ex-
pense of the other partner or at the expense of the other group
of States, and is employing all means of pressure and economic
influence towards this end.
Nor should one forget that not all countries will agree to join
these groups, and not all of the States which have already joined
them will unconditionally and in all cases submit to Anglo-
American dictation.
Furthermore, can one ignore such an important fact as the
tremendous upsurge of the national liberation movement which
has started of late in the countries of the Orient, among peoples
that have only now obtained the opportunity of straightening
their backs and standing erect?
Lastly, we must speak of the Soviet Union and the countries


of people’s democracy, which are carrying into life the true will
of their peoples and the great principles of friendship and
equality with regard to other nations. The very fact of the
existence of the Soviet State, with its growing might and inter-
national prestige, as well as the powerful support rendered it by
the democratic forces in other countries, is an insuperable ob-
stable to all and every plan for establishing the world domina-
tion of any Powers. This has found its historical confirmation
in the liquidation of the Fascist States, which endeavoured to
carry through their fantastic plans of world domination, plans
from which the present plans for establishing Anglo-American
domination differ very little.
In view of all the above, it is easy to understand the univer-
sally-known fact that of late the countries of the Anglo-Ameri-
can bloc, especially the United States of America, are so apt to
be carried away by dreams of unprecedented expansion of their
armies, of the tremendous increase of their military budgets, of
the further building of their network of air and naval bases in all
parts of the globe, and by dreams of all sorts of other military
plans, including monstrous plans for employing atom bombs
for the same purposes.
In order to justify this unbridled aggressive policy, the ruling
circles of the United States and Great Britain resort to every
method of spreading fear and uncertainty among all sections of
the public in Europe and America, depicting the unprecedented
growth of democratic forces and of the national liberation
movement in the post-war period as some kind of “dangerous
aggression”; even among statesmen they encourage those who
for all practical purposes are becoming active warmongers, des-
pite the fact that war propaganda has been unanimously con-
demned by the United Nations; they increasingly incite their
placemen and the press dependent on them against such peace-
loving countries as the Soviet Union and the States of people’s
democracy and spread floods of lies and bellicose threats. They
need all this, because all too often they dare not undertake any
real solution of the domestic problems that have matured in
their own countries in keeping with the new historical situation.
That is why they build their calculations for the future pre-
eminently on these or other aggressive plans, even though they
do understand that these are unrealisable except by violence,
except by unleashing a new war.
The ruling circles of the United States, immediately after the
termination of the Second World War, began establishing air
and naval bases in both the Atlantic and in the Pacific, as well
as on many remote seas, including areas located thousands and
thousands of miles from the United States’ boundaries. Since
that time the number of American war bases, far from being
reduced, has been considerably multiplied, both in the Eastern


and in the Western hemispheres, in the countries of Europe and
in the countries of America, Asia and Africa.
Entire States, especially from among those situated close to
the boundaries of the U.S.S.R., have been adjusted to provide
convenient bridgeheads for the Anglo-American air forces and
other conveniences for attacking the U.S.S.R. The flow of various
arms is being directed to such States by means of ever new
American credits granted to them.
No reasonable person could claim that this was being done
to provide for the defence of the United States. It is known, on
the other hand, that no danger of aggression exists for the
United States after the Second World War which ended in the
defeat of the aggressive powers.
Furthermore, can it be considered accidental that after the
termination of the Second World War the United States and
Great Britain have preserved their organisation of the com-
bined Chiefs of Staff in Washington, which in a hush-hush man-
ner continues its work, preparing its fresh plans of aggression?
For if no such plans existed there would be no reason for pre-
serving that Staff in Washington under present peace-time con-
ditions, and no need for sending American, as well as British,
troops to the territories of an increasing number of states.
American troops are now not only stationed in the countries
of Europe and Asia for the purpose of carrying out their post-
war occupation tasks on former enemy territories. American
troops still remain on the territories of a whole number of
States which are members of the United Nations.
It has become the custom in recent years with the ruling
circles of the United States to assume the right to send their
troops to the territories of other States, Greece in Europe or
China in Asia, for instance, on the pretext that this is essential
to the security of the United States. It is perfectly clear that
such a foreign policy has nothing in common with legitimate
concern for defence of the United States, and that this policy is
thoroughly permeated with the spirit of violence, with the spirit
of aggression.
It is considered as universally recognised that certain circles
in the United States are seeking to prepare both Western Ger-
many and Japan as their weapons for the implementation of
aggressive plans, and to make them accomplices in the aggres-
sion which is being prepared. Nor is it accidental that the
United States is resorting to any pretext in order to postpone
the conclusion of the peace treaties both with Germany and
with Japan. This is the natural consequence of the foreign
policy of the ruling circles of the United States, a policy which
is based at the present time on aggressive plans and is not
aimed at strengthening universal peace.
The aggressive nature of United States policy in regard to the


growing democratic forces and entire democratic countries is
common knowledge. To this day the Greek people has been
unable to get out of its present impasse, because reactionary
forces alien to the people find powerful support from outside.
No sooner had the peoples of Czechoslovakia last year curbed
somewhat the reactionary circles in their country and rendered
support to the advanced democratic forces, than the ruling
circles of the United States and of the entire Anglo-American
bloc raised a deafening clamour about the internal developments
in Czechoslovakia, and various attempts were made to interfere
with these domestic affairs.
In their relations with the Soviet Union, the ruling circles
of the United States and of other countries of the Anglo-
American bloc more and more vividly demonstrate their un-
willingness to reckon with the agreements that only recently
were unanimously accepted as the basis for carrying out the
joint policy of the U.S.S.R., the United States and Great Britain
in the post-war period.
Dealing with the Berlin question, the Soviet Government has
once more graphically shown that at the present time the ruling
circles of the United States and Britain do not consider them-
selves interested in agreement and co-operation with the
U.S.S.R. Even when they speak about this, it all reduces to talk
about agreement and co-operation, and ends in a plain renunci-
ation of former agreements and in direct sabotage of any real
co-operation with the U.S.S.R.
Things have gone so far that, in the field of trade with the
Soviet Union, the United States is pursuing an intolerable policy
of actual boycott, which exposes the inspirers of such a policy
as adherents of the principle â€œall means are good in regard to
the U.S.S.R.,â€~ although such a policy damages first and fore-
most the prestige of the country that inspires it.
All the above facts relating to the post-war foreign policy of
the United States and Great Britain are evidence that at the
present time the ruling circles of these Powers, far from pursu-
ing a policy of establishing a lasting and universal peace, have,
on the contrary, embarked on a policy which cannot be described
otherwise than as a policy of aggression, a policy of unleashing
another war. The North Atlantic Pact, which conforms to the
plans for the establishment by violence of Anglo-American
world domination, and thereby to the aims of the policy of un-
leashing another war, is designed precisely as a means of achiev-
ing these objectives.
It is not only the ruling aggressive circles of the United States,
and not only such British inspirers of the Pact as Churchill and
Bevin, but a good many other warmongers of lesser calibre
that stand in the background of this Pact.
One should bear in mind, however, that the signing of these


or any similar pacts does not serve as a guarantee, nor yet
provide an opportunity for the realisation of the aggressive aims
set by the inspirers of such pacts.
One should recall in this connection the unanimous support
given in democratic circles of all countries to the well-known
statement of the head of the Soviet Government, J. V. Stalin,
that “the horrors of the recent war are too alive in the minds of
the people, and the social forces in favour of peace are too great
for Churchill’s pupils in aggression to be able to overpower and
deflect them towards a new war.”
111. THE NORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCE—A FACTOR
UNDERMINING THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANISATION
THE State Department’s official statement attempts to
establish that the grounds for the formation of the North
Atlantic Alliance, as also of the other groupings mentioned
above, are a striving to “strengthen the United Nations Organi-
sation.” Such a statement would be convincing only if it were
possible to agree that the formation of the North Atlantic Alli-
ance and other groupings and blocs in circumvention of, and
behind the back of, the United Nations Organisation could serve
to strengthen this organisation. Such an assumption, however,
it stands to reason, is utterly absurd.
In actual fact, the knocking together of the North Atlantic
Alliance, heading a whole series of specific groupings of States
in various parts of the globe, represents the final breaking away
of the present policy of the United States and Great Britain
from the policy unanimously conducted by the Governments of
the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union, together
with many other nations, when the United Nations Organisation
was being created and its Charter drawn up and endorsed.
It is a well known fact that the United Nations Orga-
nisation did not discuss the formation of the North Atlantic
Alliance, or of the Western Union, or of the Pan-American Pact.
It is equally known that the question of the formation of a
Mediterranean Union, or a Scandinavian grouping, or 'an alliance
of countries of South-East Asia and other alliances of States in
the process of organisation, is at present proceeding without the
participation of the United Nations Organisation and in out-
right circumvention of this organisation. The participants of
these groups and, first of all, the ruling circles of the United
States and Great Britain, realise that it is not to their advant-
age to bring these questions up for discussion by the United
Nations. Here they would probably be asked what were the
real purposes and nature of these groups. This is in no way
desired by the Governments concerned, which are directing the
formation of all these alliances, blocs and groupings. They


prefer to do this secretly, behind the back of the United Nations
Organisation.
The ruling circles of the United States and Great Britain
are actually facing the United Nations Organisation with a
fait accompli by forming these blocs and groupings. All this,
however, does not prevent them from all the while claiming
that the North Atlantic Alliance, as well as the other blocs and
groupings that they are forming, serve to strengthen the United
Nations Organisation. However, no one now believes these
words. Even those who make such statements do not attribute
any significance to these words.
In actual fact the North Atlantic Alliance and its associated
groupings of States, headed by the ruling circles of the United
States and Great Britain, constitute a direct undermining of
the United Nations Organisation. Today these groupings aim
at undermining the authority of the United Nations Organisation,
tomorrow they may bring about the destruction of this organi-
sation.
Not for nothing have the foundations of this organisation
been systematically undermined in the last three years, which
is especially reflected in the effort to do away with the principle
of Five-Power unanimity in settling all the major issues ensur-
ing universal peace and international security, as laid down in
the Charter.
In support of the position it has taken on the question of the
North Atlantic Alliance the State Department refers to the
United Nations Charter. These references, however, are not
only far from convincing but are distinguished by their excep-
tional irresponsibility. The State Department refers to Article
52 of the United Nations Charter which speaks about the pos-
sible existence of regional pacts provided they are consistent
with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Orga-
nisation.
It goes without saying that this Article is necessary in the
United Nations Charter. Facts, however, demonstrate that the
North Atlantic Pact can in no way be considered as such a
regional arrangement. The political meaning of the North
Atlantic Pact and its associated arrangements has nothing in
common whatever with what is stated in Article 52 of the
United Nations Charter concerning the purposes and principles
of regional arrangements.
The North Atlantic Pact cannot in general be referred to as a
regional arrangement, as it embraces States in both hemispheres
and pursues the aim not of settling various regional problems,
but of determining the entire course of the foreign policy of
such Powers as the United States and Great Britain, who com
tinually interfere in the affairs of. many other States and in
every part of the globe at that.


It can only be claimed in mockery that the North Atlantic
Pact is a regional arrangement. He who respects Article 52 of
the United Nations Charter will not take this view, as the
North Atlantic Alliance was formed, not on the basis of Article
52, but as a direct violation of the Charter and the fundamental
principles of the United Nations Organisation.
The State Department likewise refers to Article 51 of the
United Nations Charter which speaks of “the inherent right of
individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs
against a member of the United Nations,” and the Security
Council is as yet unable to take due measures to maintain
world peace. The fact that such an Article is necessary in the
United Nations Charter is very evident.
On the other hand, however, it is equally obvious that the
formation of the North Atlantic grouping can in no way find
justification in Article 51. This is evident first of all from the
fact that neither the United States of America, nor Great
Britain, nor any other of the countries of the Northern Atlantic,
are menaced by any armed attack whatever. This alone suffices
to prove the groundlessness of any references to Article 51 which
aim at justifying the formation of the North Atlantic Alliance.
The North Atlantic grouping is being formed, not for purposes of
self-defence and in general not for the tasks laid down in the
above-mentioned Article of the Charter. The North Atlantic
Alliance headed by the United States would simply be of no
use to anyone if there did not exist the striving forcibly to
establish the domination of the United States and Great Britain
over other countries, if there did not exist the striving to estab-
lish by force Anglo-American world domination.
The North Atlantic Pact is by no means required for self-
defence, but for realisation of the policy of aggression, for effect-
ing the policy of unleashing a new war. Consequently, the State
Department’s attempts to justify the formation of the North
Atlantic Alliance by referring to Article 51 of the Charter are
utterly groundless. These references can only delude the wide
public,'but cannot serve to explain the real motives for the
formation of this new “North Atlantic” grouping and all kinds
of associated subsidiary unions and blocs. This is how matters
stand with the State Department’s references to Articles 51
and 52 of the United Nations Charter.
If admittedly the State Department’s references to the
United Nations Charter are irrelevant, then it becomes necessary
to refer to another explanation given of the motives behind the
formation of the North Atlantic Alliance, likewise contained in
the above-mentioned statement. In this connection the State
Department’s reference to the Vandenberg resolution, adopted
by the American Senate, are deserving of especial attention.
Last summer the United States Senate approved a resolution


submitted by Vandenberg on the “new departure” in American
foreign policy. The State Department’s statement says that the
afore-mentioned “resolution proposes that for the first time in
the nation’s history the United States associates itself in peace-
time with countries outside the Western hemisphere in collective
security arrangements designed to safeguard peace and to
strengthen our security”.
This statement of the State Department once again refutes its
own assertion that the North Atlantic grouping is of a regional
nature. It at the same time demonstrates that, since the end
of the Second World War, changes have occurred in the foreign
policy pursued by the ruling circles of the United States which
lay bare the present frankly aggressive nature of this policy.
This resolution gives a free hand to the United States Govern-
ment to set up any international alliance in peacetime and, on
the pretext of ensuring security, permits United States ruling
circles to enter into any groupings and to embark on any
adventures, which fully corresponds to the present-day aggres-
sive tendencies of the United States ruling circles.
Adoption of this resolution by the American Senate shows
that not only have the United States ruling circles discarded
all their main obligations towards the United Nations Organi-
sation, but that they have also taken a new course in their
foreign policy, which will be aimed hereafter at establishment
by force of Anglo-American world domination. It follows from
this, that the resolution adopted by the American Senate
signifies that United States ruling circles favour a policy of
aggression, a policy of unleashing a new war.
In view of this new orientation of the foreign policy of the
United States and Great Britain it is no wonder that the spear-
head of this policy is directed against the Soviet Union and the
people’s democracies. Inasmuch as the Soviet Union and the
people’s democracies are consistently defending the cause of
world-wide peace and are waging a tireless struggle against all
the instigators of a new war, we cannot expect a friendly
attitude towards our country on the part of those foreign circles
which instigate new aggression and which at the present
moment are bending all their efforts to prepare a new war.
The Soviet Union is party to important agreements with the
United States and Great Britain on joint policy, as regards both
Germany in the West and Japan in the East —a policy which
should serve as a good basis for the establishment of durable
peace in the world on democratic principles. These agreements
are now at every step trampled on by the ruling circles of the
United States and Great Britain, since these circles are now
adhering to a new course in foreign policy and do not wish to
take into account the agreements signed by them. In violation of
the letter and spirit of former agreements, the ruling circles of


the United States and Great Britain are now forming the so-
called “North Atlantic Alliance,” not only without the participa-
tion of the U.S.S.R. but even with the direct aim of using this
grouping against the U.S.S.R. and the people’s democracies. >
The Soviet Union is also a party to the 20-year Treaties of
Friendship and Mutual Assistance with Great Britain and France
which fully meet the interests of universal lasting peace and
are particularly important for the consolidation of peace in
Europe. The ruling circles of Great Britain and France, however,
violate these Treaties and ignore the obligations contained in
them to support and consolidate peace in Europe jointly with the
Soviet Union which Great Britain and France had assumed. The
Governments of Great Britain and France are taking part in
setting up the North Atlantic grouping and, moreover, on the
pretext of consolidating their security, they have set up the
so-called “Western Union,” not only without the participation
of the U.S.S.R. but even with the direct aim of utilising this
new West European grouping against the Soviet Union.
The United States, Great Britain and France, together with
the Soviet Union, were the main countries which prepared the
setting up of the United Nations Organisation. Together with
the other United Nations it was unanimously agreed that these
four States and China should strive for unanimity and co-
operation within the United Nations Organisation and therefore
the principle of the unanimity of the five great Powers in
settling major issues of peace and international security was
taken as the basis of the United Nations Charter.
Almost on the day following the establishment of the United
Nations Organisation, the undermining of the latter began.
Although this was effected by other hands everyone saw and
knew that the undermining work was directed by the ruling
circles of the United States and Great Britain.
What was this due to?
This was due to the fact that, as soon as the Second World
War was over the ruling circles of the United States and Great
Britain conceived the idea that it was precisely they who must
play the leading role in the United Nations Organisation and not
all the five great Powers jointly.
However, inasmuch as the Soviet Union demanded and
demands strict adherence to the provision of the United Nations.
Charter on the necessity of concerted actions on the part of all
five great Powers, since only such concordant actions can
actually guarantee universal peace and international security,
the ruling circles of the United States and Great Britain inten-
sified their attacks on the U.S.S.R. and developed even more
extensive activity with a view to undermining the United
Nations Organisation. However, all this proved insufficient. .
Inasmuch as the Soviet Union and a number of other States


do not agree to revision of the United Nations Charter, the
ruling circles of the United States and Great Britain have
apparently come to the conclusion that they will not succeed
in fully adjusting the United Nations Organisation to their
aggressive policy, although they are striving to achieve this.
The United Nations Charter proved to be inconvenient for them
and they failed to achieve results from their attacks on the
U.S.S.R. for its defence of the very principles on which the
United Nations Organisation was established, since they
could in no way shake the position of the Soviet Government
which is defending the sacred cause of the consolidation of
universal lasting peace and is consistently exposing each and
every aggressor and warmonger.
Having become convinced of this, the ruling circles of the
United States and Great Britain have apparently arrived at the
conclusion that they must circumvent the United Nations
Organisation. It was this policy that resulted in the establish-
ment of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as the other
groupings of Powers which have been and are being set up
secretly behind the back of the United Nations Organisation.
Thus we have every ground for asserting that the North Atlantic
Alliance is a factor undermining the United Nations Organi-
sation,
One cannot ignore the fact that this reflects the persistent
endeavour of the ruling circles of the United States and Great
Britain to bring about the utter disintegration and collapse of
the United Nations Organisation; which somewhat curbs them
and prevents other States being involved in their aggressive
policy, and which cannot become a dumb tool in the hands of
the Anglo-American bloc in the implementation of their policy
which is aimed at forcibly establishing Anglo-American world
domination.
After this it is clear why the ruling circles of the United
States, Great Britain and France, pursuing a policy of aggression
and preparing a new war, are now striving everywhere to
pursue a policy of isolating the U.S.S.R. although this policy
constitutes a flagrant violation of the obligations assumed by
them. Consequently, the so-called â€œnew departureâ€~ in the foreign
policy of the ruling circles of these States consists in their
reverting to the old anti-Soviet course of foreign policy based
on the isolation of the U.S.S.R., which they followed in the
years preceding the Second World War and which almost led
to the complete destruction of European civilisation.
Carried away by their aggressive plans for world domination,
the ruling circles of the United States and Great Britain have
failed to understand that the so-called â€œnew departureâ€~ of their
policy, running counter to their recent obligations towards the
U.S.S.R. and other members of the United Nations, far from


being able to increase the consolidation of their political and
economic positions, will be condemned by all peace-loving
nations, will be condemned by all the champions of the con-
solidation of universal peace, who constitute the overwhelming
majority in all countries.
MAIN CONCLUSIONS
First Conclusion
The Soviet Union is compelled to reckon with the fact that
the ruling circles of the United States and Great Britain have
adopted an openly aggressive political course, the final aim of
which is to establish by force Anglo-American domination over
the world, a course which is fully in accord with the policy of
aggression, the policy of unleashing a new war pursued by them.
In view of this situation the Soviet Union has to wage an even
more vigorous and more consistent struggle against each and
every warmonger, against the policy of aggression and unleash-
ing of a new war, for a world-wide, lasting, democratic peaceT
In this struggle for the consolidation of universal peace and
international security the Soviet Union regards as its allies
all other peace-loving States and all those numberless supporters
of universal democratic peace who voice the genuine sentiments
and aspirations of the peoples who bore on their shoulders the
unbelievable burden of the last World War, and who with every
justification reject each and every aggressor and instigator of
a new war.
Second Conclusion
Everyone sees that the United Nations Organisation is now
being undermined, since this organisation, at least to a certain
extent, hampers and curbs the aggressive circles in their policy
of aggression and unleashing of a new war. In view of this
situation the Soviet Union has to struggle, with even more firm-
ness and persistence, against the undermining and destruction
of the United Nations Organisation by aggressive elements and
their accomplices, and must see to it that the United Nations
Organisation does not connive with such elements as is often
the case now, that it values its authority more highly when the
matter consists in giving a rebuff to those pursuing a policy of
aggression and unleashing of a new war.


Supplement
J. V. STALIN’S REPLIES TO FOUR
QUESTIONS
The following are the answers given by J. V. Stalin to questions put by
Mr. Kingsbury Smith, European General Manager, International
News Service of America, received on January 2 7, 1949:
First Question: Would the Government of the U.S.S.R. be
prepared to consider the issuance of a joint declaration with
the Government of the United States of America asserting that
the respective Governments have no intention of resorting to
war against one another?
Answer: The Soviet Government would be prepared to con-
sider the issuance of such a declaration.
Second Question: Would the Government of the U.S.S.R. be
prepared to join with the Government of the United States of
America in measures designed to implement this pact of peace,
such as gradual disarmament?
Answer: Naturally, the Government of the U.S.S.R. could
co-operate with the Government of the United States of America
in taking measures designed to implement this pact of peace and
leading to gradual disarmament.
Third Question: If the Governments of the United States of
America, the United Kingdom and France agreed to postpone
the establishment of a separate Western German State, pending
a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to consider the
German problem as a whole, would the Government of the
U.S.S.R. be prepared to remove the restrictions which the Soviet
authorities have imposed on communications between Berlin
and the Western zones of Germany?
Answer: Provided the United States of America, Great Britain
and France observe the conditions set forth in the third question,
the Soviet Government sees no obstacles to lifting transport
restrictions, on the understanding, however, that transport and
trade restrictions introduced by the three Powers should be
lifted simultaneously.
Fourth Question: Would Your Excellency be prepared to
confer with President Truman at a mutually suitable place to
discuss the possibility of concluding such a pact of peace?
Answer: I have already stated before that there is no objection
to a meeting.


J. V. STALIN’S REPLY TO PRESIDENT
TRUMAN’S INVITATION
The following is the text of J. V. Stalinâ€™s reply to Mr. Kingsbury Smithâ€™s
telegram: â€”
Mr. Kingsbury Smith, European General Manager, International
News Service, Paris.
Your telegram of February 1 received.
I am grateful to President Truman for the invitation to come
to Washington. For a long time it was Â«my wish to visit
Washington, and at one time I mentioned this to President
Roosevelt at Yalta, and to President Truman at Potsdam.
Unfortunately, at present I am unable to realise this wish of
mine, since the doctors strongly object to my undertaking any
prolonged journey, especially by sea or air.
The Government of the Soviet Union would welcome the
Presidentâ€™s visit to the U.S.S.R. The conference could be ar-
ranged at the Presidentâ€™s choice either in Moscow or in Lenin-
grad or in Kaliningrad, in Odessa or at Yalta, provided, of
course, that this does not go against the Presidentâ€™s considera-
tions of convenience.
However, should this suggestion meet with objection, the
meeting could be arranged at the Presidentâ€™s discretion in Poland
or Czechoslovakia.
Respectfully,
J. STALIN.
February 2,1949


SOVIET STATEMENT TO NORWEGIAN
FOREIGN MINISTRY
On January 29 the Soviet Ambassador in Norway, Afanasyev, visited the
Secretary-General of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
Schilstad, and made the following statement to him:
In connection with reports that have appeared in the press
regarding Norway's intention to join the Atlantic Alliance, the
Soviet Government has authorised me to make the following
statement.
According to numerous available data, a so-called Atlantic
Alliance will shortly be established. Although the initiators of
this alliance declare that the Atlantic Alliance pursues defensive
aims, the Soviet Government possesses sufficient grounds for
asserting that the Atlantic Alliance now in process of prepara-
tion cannot serve to strengthen universal peace, but on the
contrary represents a group of powers pursuing aggressive
aims, as is also confirmed by the fact that the Atlantic Alliance
is being set up outside of and by-passing the United Nations.
There are also sufficient grounds to assert that the initiators
of the Atlantic Pact are trying to utilise the establishment of
this new international grouping in order to set up air and naval
bases in various parts of the globe, and particularly on the
territory of Powers situated close to the frontiers of the Soviet
Union, a situation that does not at all testify to peaceful aims
on the part of this grouping.
In calling the attention of the Norwegian Government to this
state of affairs, the Soviet Government deems it necessary to
state that it regards the Atlantic Alliance as a grouping of
Powers of the sort which in fact is being counterposed to the
United Nations Organisation and pursues aims possessing
nothing in common with the interests of consolidating peace.
In view of all that has been said above, the Soviet Govern-
ment requests the Government of Norway to explain the stand
of the Norwegian Government regarding the Atlantic Pact,
particularly having in mind the circumstance that Norway has
a common frontier with the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Government asks to be informed whether the
