An Australian Gum-Leaf
Just an Australian gum-leaf,
Enclosed in a letter from home;
Oh! what a simple offering
So many miles to come.
But the weary man in the trenches
Sees with his visioned eyes
Ilis “little grey home” on the hill side,
Where the whispering gum-trees rise.
He sees the smoke ascending
From the cosy fire inside.
Which some one he loves is tending—
His bonny blue-eyed bride.
He smells the scent of its burning
On the cool of the evening air,
And his spirit to home returning,
Is freed for awhile from care.
She flies to the gate to greet him,
With kisses on lips and brow —
The sorrow and heat of the trenches
Are far from that dreamer now!
He rises refreshed from his dreaming,
Strengthened anew for toil
By the little green gift from the home-
land,
A leaf of the “Fair Dinkum Oil.”


Tramp !
Tramp! Tramp!
How sad it sounded that day
When out from Broadmeadows Camp
Our boys went marching away.
To Tramp! Tramp!
O’er many a weary mile,
With never a touch of a loved one’s
hand
Or the light of a mother’s smile.
Tramp . . . Tramp. . .
Through mud and sand and snow.
Before it’s Tipperary again
They’ve a long, long way to go.
But Tramp . . . Tramp. . .
Each step brings them nearer home
To fame —renown or a cross and crown;
What ever calls, they come!
Tramp . . Tramp . . .
Lo! they are here again.
We sent them forth with a parting
cheer,
Behold the fruits of our waiting year:
Our boys have grown to men.


The Women of Australia
We are the Women of Australia,
The mothers, wives and sisters of the
men
Who are going to the front
To bear the battle’s brunt.
Alas! the sword is mightier than the
pen!
«
But we are the women who don’t falter
When the Motherland is calling for
our aid;
We are the women who won’t alter
Our decision when once it has been
made
To offer up our sons
To stand beside their guns,
On the altar of our honor are they
laid.
There are lonely days ahead
When our hearts will be as lead —
It will take us all our courage to go
through.
Still, the Empire may command,
For we women understand,
As the women of the Empire always
do.


The Allied Dead
Hail to the dead who nobly died.
Whatever their race, whichever their
side,
So long as they stood by the light
within,
However they lost they were bound to
win,
For each must answer at God’s own
call,
And by his answer alone, can fall.
Whether ’tis German or Turk or French
Or Russian, dying to save his trench,
God is General over us all;
He’s raising an army —for peace instead
Of war —the Host of the Allied Dead


Christmas Hymn
Kings of the earth journey from east
and west
To worship the King of Kings. Would
ye be blessed?
Speak but the words and war and death
shall cease.
Kings of the earth, bring to the Christ
Child peace.
There at His feet united ye shall be,
And clouds of w r ar will vanish as the
night.
Led by the Star of Love, ye yet shall
see
The error of your ways—follow Its
light
Till, hand in hand, you humbly kneel
before
The tender Christ Child, as in days of
yore.
The wdse men of the East laid down
their pride
And worshipped, and returned home
satisfied.
Who w r ould be great among you, let
him be
Clothed not with pride, but with
humility.
So, before the Christmas bells shall
cease,
Kings of the earth bring to the Christ
Child peace.


“Ora et Labora”
Work and pray!
What else is there left to-day,
Since our dearest went away,
But to work and pray?
Work and pray!
Work while the day is here,
And living yet are those we hold
most dear;
Let’s work and pray.
Work and pray!
Pray that the war may cease
And sorrow end. Oh! once again for
peace,
Dear God, we pray.
Hear Thou our prayers
While yet our busy hands
Toll for our loved ones
In far distant lands.
No time for rest
While they in trenches fight,
Both night and day
We’ll work and pray.


In Memory
63rd Regimental Ball
This time last June
Our hearts were free from care,
Our flying feet kept tune
And music thrilled the air.
This time last June,
With hearts so light and gay,
We never guessed how soon
Life’s joy would pass away.
This time last June
Our dreams were wondrous fair;
But this time last June,
Who thought of Sari Bair?
June 26th, 1915.


Louvain
Oh! spires of God, that pointed so high,
so high
Up to the heavenly height
That angels could hear the peal of your
bells,
Without bending low to listen,
As they lit the stars each night.
Now they hear but the roar of cannon;
Not even a tolling bell is left.
And the tears in their sad eyes glisten,
For they loved you, and are bereft.
Oh! spires of love, crumbled to earth
by hate,
Your bells still chime In the listening
hearts
Of the angels who mohrn your fate.


The Sign of Anzac
Oh, Southern Cross! In Australasian
skies,
Symbolic of our young land’s sacrifice,
Shine on our way and keep our faith
still pure,
And give us- strength our sorrow to
endure.
Oh, Southern Cross! How like that
other one.
Whereon was crucified God’s only Son:
How many only sons have died that we
Might still call ours the Land of Liberty!
Dear Southern Cross! Their love of thee
and home
Was Intermingled till it grew as one,
And when strange stars oft wooed them
with bright eyes,
Thine, brighter still, looked down from
memory’s skies.
Than Anzac Cross, what fitter name
could be
To mark our loss and keep their
memory—
Each time we saw thee in our Southern
skies —
A monument of stars to their great
sacrifice!
What tho’ they sleep in foreign, un-
named graves,
Who died for home and thee!
Their fame, emblazoned on the “Anzac
Cross,”
Shall live eternally!


Love Conquers Death
Dost say that because a man lies dead
he’s beaten?
That the battle is for the strong?
Dost say that because a man lies dead
he’s vanquished?
Nay, thou art wrong.
When thus he lies, his last endeavour
ended,
And death has freed his soul,
When past earth’s strife to Qod at last
ascended.
Then has he found his goal.
Weep not for those who sleep—they
did their best,
And surely earned sweet rest;
Let not thy tears disturb their tranquil
sleep,
Crave heart! They do not weep.
Enshrined in memory do they not still
live
Who gave their young lives at their
country’s call?
Ah! yes, and It is ours fresh life to
give;
While one is loved, there is no death
at all.


“On ! Come on Australia !”
On! Come on Australia!
They rush to meet the foe,
Not driven into battle,
Australia’s heroes go.
On! Come on Australia!
Advance Australia fair,
To live up to our motto:
Australia must be there.
On! Come on Australia!
To far Gallipoli;
There’s no such word as failure
With such a battle cry.
On! Come on Australia!
We coo-ey back reply:
We’re coming on Australia,
To do and dare —or die.
On! Come on Australia!
’Twill echo "down the years
When war is but a memory
Of sacrifice and tears.


Oh England !
Oh England! We have given
Our dearest and our best;
Oh! England, we have striven
To stand the hardest test.
Oh England! we are loyal,
As our fathers were before,
British to the backbone,
Loyal to the core.
But, England—don’t forget it,
When peace once more shall reign,
There are none like those we’ve given,
You can give us back again.
“Oh England! don’t forget us,”
Do you hear the sad refrain?
’Tis the voices of the loved ones
We will never clasp again.
The voices of those heroes,
Who performed a giant task;
The heroes of the Dardanelles,
And this is all they ask!


Knighthood’s Quest
Sons of the North, South, East and
West,
You are faring forth on knighthood’s
quest;
But wherever you are, waking or sleep-
ing,
There’s One who has you in His keep-
ing.
Sons of the land that has brought forth
men
True of heart and with honor clad.
Be your strength “as the strength of
ten”
Knights indeed, like Sir Galahad,
Brothers in arms, Oh! who can tell
That journey’s end? Let not farewell,
But aurevoir be our parting greeting,
For, says a proverb worth repeating,
“Journeys end in lovers’ meeting.”


Love’s Messenger
Last night, the sun was setting
With a crimson rose at its heart,
And I found myself almost forgetting
That we are so far apart.
For a golden sunbeam crept to my feet
And whispered softly to me:
“Hast thou a message to send thy love?
I can take it for thee.”
So I kissed my hand to that kindly
beam,
And sent my heart, to thee
With the last, last spark of departing
day
It fled o’er the western sea.
And I know that west of that setting
sun
Thy morrow Is softly dawnijig,
And the first bright beam
That disturbs thy dream,
Shall give thee my kiss in the morn-
ing;
My heart and kiss in the morning.


To the
13th Battalion, N.S.W.
Men of the land of the Waratah,
Say not “good-bye,” but “au revoir.”
Never forget how proud we are
Of our men of the land of the Waratah.
Men of the land of the Flannel Flower,
You are England’s hope in her darkest
hour;
Our prayers and blessings on you we
shower,
Men of the land of the Flannel Flower.
Men of the land of the Christmas Bell,
Where’er you are we wish you well;
You may capture the Kaiser —you never
can tell,
Men of the land of the Christmas Bell!
