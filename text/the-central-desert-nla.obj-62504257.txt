SATURDAY, JANUARY 15, 1881.
POLITICAL PATRONAGE.
In divesting himself of official patro-
nage, and transferring all appointments
and promotions to the engineer-in-chief,
the Minister of Railways has taken a step
which has called forth a general chorus of
approval, and the praise he has received
from those who are politically opposed to
him must have served to convince him
that, on our side at least, there is every
disposition to measure public men by
other than mere party standards, and to
give credit wherever credit is due, alto-
gether irrespective of the side of the
Assembly upon which the recipient of it
may sit for the time being. Mr.
Patterson is also to be complimented
for the views which he has expressed on
the subject of moderation and good
government; but we must, at the same
time, take occasion to remind him that
the public cannot be expected to
entertain any well-grounded hopes of
either, so long as a politician so ad-
dicted to violence of language, nepotism,
and corruption, as Mr. Berry is, re-
mains at the head of affairs. To speak
of moderation in connexion with a man
who has threatened us with a civil war,
and who, little more than two years
ago, advocated separation from the
mother country, and the setting up of
? an independent sovereign ? as a means
of getting rid of constitutional diffi-
culties, is obviously an incongruity. And
what good government, what honest exer-
cise of patronage, can there be, so long
as we have a Chief Secretary who
is resolutely bent upon quartering every
member of his family on the public
purse ? Mr. Berry?s nepotism is not an
occasional failing, it is a chronic vice.
speedily re-established, and the Govern-
ment workshops would be once more
transformed into agencies for effecting
mechanical experiments at the public
cost, for the private benefit of the
experimenter and his choice associates.
What Mr. Patterson should do would
be to deal with the whole question of
patronage by act of Parliament. No
doubt this would be strenuously opposed
by some of his colleagues, who are as fond
of dabbling in official jobbery and cor-
ruption as a duck is of dipping its bill in
the mud of the gutter. But he would be
backed up by the voice of the press ?
which, for once, is unanimous?and by
the power of public opinion. In so doing
the Minister of Railways would be adopt-
ing acourse which would be highly popular
and thoroughly right and just. Any
opposition which might be offered to it
could only emanate from men who are
interested in upholding a system of ne-
potism, maladministration, and extrava-
gance ; and this would be seen through by
the country at once. And although the
interests of the whole tribe of unqualified
placehnnters ?the would-be drones of the
social hive ?would be enlisted against such
a measure, yet every right-thinking tax-
payer, and every fit and proper person
who might be anxious to qualify him or
herself for the public service, would warmly
approve of it; the latter because it would
make merit the sole avenue to employ-
ment under Government, and the former
because it would tend to lighten the public
expenditure, by depriving Ministers of the
power of flooding the various departments
with a host of superfluous officers. One
other advantage would be this?if the
civil service were not overmanned, there
would be no pretext for those sudden,
cruel, and unscientific applications of the
pruning-knife which are now made as
often as a deficit has to be met; and the
smaller the instability of that service the
greater would be its efficiency, and the
higher the ability and zeal which would
be capable of being attracted to it. Under
these circumstances, and bearing these
considerations in mind, we strongly
advise Mr. Patterson to endeavour to
extend to all the departments, by force
of law, the change he has so judiciously
and laudably introduced into his own.
THE CENTRAL ?DESERT.?

the Queenslander exploring expedition,

THE AUSTRALASIAN.
44 make no impression on the hardy
? shrubs of the great plain ; while such
? are their fattening properties, that
? stock subsisting on them can travel
44 long distances in and out to water,
? without losing flesh as they would
? do under different conditions.? Ac-
cording to M. Favenc, the only real
desert is that which, strictly speaking, is
no desert at all, because it is covered with
permanent vegetation; that is to say, with
the treacherous and useless spinifex, inter-
mingled with shady bauhinia trees and
bright - looking desert-apple trees. Yet
even these may be transitional forms
of plant-life, which are preparing the
soil out of which they grow for higher
and better kinds of flora. ? Sturt?s
? stony desert ? was nothing of this
kind, but consisted of a long stretch
of ? ? downs, covered with limestone
? nodules, and dry plains upon which
? the grass had perished from long-
-44 continued dry weather ; and the ex-
? plorers were too inexperienced in this
? description of country to properly
? appreciate the shrubs and herbage
44 which supplied the place of grass.
? There is,? continues Mr. Favenc,
? actually no desert country in the in-
-44 terior, excepting spinifex country; that
44 is, if we accept the term ?desert?
44 as meaning country unfit to support
41 animal life. There are flooded plains
44 subject to inundation that during a
? great portion of the year are barren ;
4i that is to say, the grass that grows on
? them is of a kind that will not last
44 longer than a few months ; but these
44 cannot come under the denomination
44 4 desert,? as the watercourses that in-
-41 tersect them generally contain plenty
4< of feed about their banks, and the
44 plains themselves terminate in higher
4e country, carrying grass, bushes, &c.,
44 all the year round.?
Hence what was formerly condemned as
hopelessly dry country is now affording
pasturage to thousands of sheep, and the
only question that arises is that which is
pertinently asked by Mr. Favenc :
Will country subject to such long and
constant periods of dry weather stand the
drain upon it caused by close stocking ;
and, if any of the vegetation disappears,
will other growth take its place? This
must depend, to a considerable extent,
upon the possibility of storing the annual
rainfall or of finding a subterranean
supply of water, and, if we are to be
guided by analogy, we may confidently
anticipate that, beneath the great
central plain of Australia, as beneath
other depressions of the earth?s surface,
exhibiting similar geological, climatic,
and meteorological conditions, will be
found large deposits of the precious fluid.
The heavy tropical rains of the in-
terior, which often suffice to trans-
form extensive plains into wide-spread-
ing lakes, do not disappear by
?evaporation exclusively, except in the
?case of those clay-pans which offer an
impel meable surface to the water.
Wherever the soil is arenaceous, or other-
wise porous, there must be a large
amount of infiltration going on, and
where this is the case, the water would
descend until it reached an impenetrable
stratum, where it would form a reservoir
or flow off in the direction of the trend
of the underlying rock. At present, we
know nothing of the sources of those
streams?from which living fish have
been brought up?that are met with at
considerable depths by miners in different
parts of this colony. One thing only is
certain, and that is that they are of such
a magnitude and force as to necessitate
expensive pumping power to keep them
from flooding the shafts and adits; and
they not merely provoke inquiry as to
their origin, but suggest all sorts of
plausible hypotheses concerning the
hidden and undeveloped water supply of
this continent, and encourage the hope
that this may one day enable us to make
?even ? the desert? bloom like a garden.
THE ?ATONEMENT? CONTRO-
VERSY.
The prolonged and varied controversy
which, in this more than usually silly
season, has occupied without enlivening
the columns of The Argus, has had in it
something of the elements of tragedy and
of comedy, but the comedy is the most
apparent and most characteristic. To an
ill-regulated sense of the ludicrous, there
is something very comic to step suddenly
from a spirited notice of the pantomimes
into an adjoining column where some
confident correspondent in a few jerky
sentences either complacently dooms nine
tenths of the human race to perdition, or
evolves a system of universal celestial
promotion by merit out of his head on
the spur of the moment. It was at the
of extracts from their grim 44 Confession,?
with doctrines to which they had been
giving in their adhesion all their lives
without knowing what they were ?doc-
trines not well suited to engage the ad-
miration of a self-indulgent age. It is
very funny, too, to see the ease with
which impromptu letter-writers, who had
never given five minutes? thought to the
question, settle difficulties over which
such intellects as those of Augustine and
Calvin so long and profoundly laboured.
They settle them in a simple fashion.
They look at one or two obvious super-
ficial points, and ignore all the others.
Those, said an ancient philosopher, who
take in but few particulars easily de-
cide, and there is no doubt that the
method saves a great deal of trouble.
On one side of the controversy
we have mild and otherwise re-
spectable people quietly consigning the
vast majority of the human race to dam-
nation, all in the interest of the infalli-
bility of a document, which, perhaps,
they have never read. One blandly
points out that, after all, there will still be
a good many of the elect, and smugly
shuts his ears to the infinite wail of agony
rising up to his future throne from the
countless hosts of the damned. Corre-
spondents who have been engaged all day
in the petty details of trade or business, or
the work of their profession, place their
sheets of foolscap before them and take
their magnum bonum in hand, fearlessly
enter by some method of their own into the
counsels of the Almighty from the begin-
ning, and confidently lay down the lines and
guiding principles of His action. On the
other side, we see a crowd of writers led
by the most amiable feelings to attribute
their own goody-goody disposition to
Eternal Providence, while we have only
to look around at the facts of this hard
world, at the helpless ignorance, and
crime, and evil, and misery of human
life, at the relentless rule of nature, red
in tooth and claw, to see how much more
accurately their philanthropic schemes
represent the feelings of easy-going, com-
fortable, good-natured citizens than the
stern law under which we live.
We suppose that no one save these
theological correspondents themselves
believes that the proceedings of the
scratch journalistic (Ecumenical Council
into which they have resolved themselves
have thrown very much light on the
question. Little were many of them
aware of the extent to which the contro-
versy had been.threshed out before. It
is indeed that Serbonian bog where
armies whole of controversialists have
sunk. It is the very subject which
Milton?s devils amused themselves by
discussing in hell, where some apart sat
on a hill retired,
? And reason?d high
Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,
Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute ;
And found no end, in wand?ring mazes lost.?
And it is a controversy of so long
standing, on which so many acute
intellects have been brought to bear,
from the rebellious subjects of Milton?s
fines to the divines of the Scotch kirk,
that these jaunty newspaper correspon-
dents undertook to polish off in a few
crude, not always logical nor always
grammatical, sentences.
It is hardly worth remarking that none
or very few of the writers took occasion
to even glance at the subject they were
supposed to be treating. They under-
took to write on the Atonement, but
they soon diverged to the Westminster
Confession, and then on to the broad
subject of predestination, in which their
intellects found ample room and verge
enough to expatiate at ease. They made
no attempt to place in any light in-
telligible to any intellect of the present
day the precise character of the change
effected in the relations of mankind
to the moral law by the great
sacrifice which was in the first in-
stance under discussion. Had they
confined the controversy to this question,
it would have been entirely within the
realm of theology, where a merely secular
writer would place himself at a disadvan-
tage by following it. But when they
merge it into a question which is, after
all, but one phase of the all-including
moral problem of the Origin of Evil, it
becomes one that is equally open to the
comment of all alike, sectarian and secu-
larist. And when the Rationalist has his
say on the subject, it is a very poor
answer to him to reply, as ?No Presby-
terian ? said at an early stage in the dis-
cussion, that he on his own system has to
deal with just the same difficulty and
does not succeed any better. Pro-
bably not. Indeed, the Rationalist of the
present day is very much nearer the
Calvinist in this matter than ? No Pres,
byterian ? is likely to be at all aware.
All who seek to apply modern philosophic
outset very droll to notice the astonish- All who seek to apply modern philosophic
ment of some sound Presbyterians at thought to morals assume the determinism
; being suddenly confronted, in the shape ?we may say the predeterminism of
human actions as fully as the Calvinist.
If they believe the world to be ruled by
Infinite Power and Infinite Benignity,
they have the same difficulty in reconcil-
ing with these conditions the moral evil
and misery we see around as though
they had learned when young and
grown to doubt when older the theo-
logy of the Shorter Catechism. The
recognition of this awful problem is not a
consequence of any creed. It is the prior
difficulty which creeds are originated to
solve. If we may judge from the
chaotic talk which has for the last few
weeks been filling the columns of The
Argus, creeds have not yet done very
much towards supplying a satisfactory
and acceptable solution. That they
should have failed is a small matter.
That theologians should not succeed in
solving the essentially insoluble is only
in the nature of things. It would have
been well if they had been content merely
to fail, and had not gone on further to
exaggerate and intensify a simple mystery
into an arrogant and Intolerable assertion
of everlasting and omnipotent injustice
that has so shocked and bewildered the
best feelings and deepest convictions of
mankind.
TALK ON CHANGE.
? I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,?
?Shakspkarb.
? Quamquam ridentem dicere verum
Quid vetat ? Horace.
Bravo once more, Mr. Patterson! For a
Minister to divest himself of the patronage
of his department is a piece of self-
abnegation as rare as it is admirable.
And yet it must be a great relief to be
freed from degrading importunities and the
pain of having to say ? No.? As the
lives of the travelling public are at the
mercy of railway servants, it is most fitting
that they especially should be chosen for their
skill and steadiness, and not on the ground
of political partisanship. It is to be hoped
that the Minister will have the cordial sup-
port of both sides of the House in this matter.
The danger which looms ahead is that the
first time Mr, Elsdon refuses to appoint the
second cousin of the hon. member for Grease-
palm to the charge of an engine, he may be
dragged through the mire on the floor of the
House for fearlessly doing his duty. It is thus
that the time may come when members of
Parliament may be called upon to endorse
with emphasis the propriety of Mr. Patterson?s
most creditable proceeding.
The Orient steamers seem to have every
good quality, but no luck. People naturally
make comparisons, and ask how it is that the
P. and 0. boats don?t try to knock the tops
off the reefs and scrape down the sandbanks.
The reason may be that the P. and 0. Com-
pany never forgives mistakes in its captains.
It is a company which seeks no explanation,
and is not inquisitive about the reason why.
A blunder is treated as a crime. If something
quite beyond human guidance, or that could
not be averted by human foresight, occurs,
that does not count against the captain, but
everything else does ; and so the P. and 0.
Company is wonderfully free from mishaps
with its vessels.
But this must not be construed as inferen-
tial blame of Captain Trench, of the Chimbo-
razo. If there be grounds for censure in his
case, it will be time enough to apply it when
bad seamanship is proved. And bad seaman-
ship would give the lie, in Captain Trench?s
case, to a long and creditable career. I am
assured on good authority that a red warning
light?such as was suggested in this column
and adopted for Cape Otway?would have
absolutely prevented the stranding of the
Chimborazo.
Sir Arthur Kennedy is not mealy-mouthed,
and I imagine that the Queensland Governor?s
salary must be upon some schedule Q. Z.
which places it beyond the present reach of
honourable members. In a speech to the
boys at the breaking-up of the Ipswich Gram-
mar School His Excellency had the audacity
to say?
? You boys will all have a voice in the affairs of the
colony, and I hope that you will make a better use of
that privilege than some constituencies have done,
and trust that you will not, like them, assist in re-
turning drunken bankrupts to Parliament. (Applause.)
I can say some things that other people could not, and
Ido not care whether they please or not; but I tnink
every right-minded person in the colony will agree
with me in what I have now said.?
Sir Arthur is a brave man.
How I came by the following I decline to
explain :
�? And, sez I to Brown, sez I, about that ?orrid
Hostrailyer, I ain?t a-goin? to say anythink agen it till
I shakes off the dust off my feet-nor, indeed, least-
ways look back in fear ind tremblin? that I might be
a pillow of salt, as Mrs. Jones, of the Ebenezer Chapel,
as sat under that blessed young man the Reverend
Porkchops, often explained was the cause of her
thirst And if my Agger wrsn?t admired, nor my
burow bursted with invitations to tee. and muffins,
which the butter is that soft in summer as spoons is
needed which, if any one thinks I was vexed, it?s like
their owdacity, as the immoral poet sez ?A Rose by
any other name, etcetera, etcetera. And what?s
the use of their impidence in ?aving a town-hall that
big that when I read ?em ray trrvels the orgence looked
that small that but for the smell of the onions they
ate with their chunks of beef, I do declare, Mrs.
Briggs, if I was to die on the spot, you couldn?t ha?
told there was any one there. And Brown sez, wor-
ritin?, sez he, ? You had much better ha? kept to genteel
society at Herne Bay.? And I ups and sez ?Never
mind, Brown, I?ll just rite a bit of a billy-doo to the
? Bombay Earthquake,? and let the edditur know all
about the litterary cotarees that might have enj?yed
my company in Melbun, only they was jealous-like of
my public reputashun.? ?
In using the term ? intercepted ? in regard
to the purchase of one of Mr. H. J. John,
ston?s pictures in Adelaide, on its way to the
International Exhibition in Melbourne, the
word, it is hardly necessary to say, was not
intended to imply that the acquisition was by
any questionable means, but rather in appre-
ciation of the readiness to secure the work
of an Australian artist in whose success
many in the colonies take a friendly interest.
As an instance of pluck, and at the same
time of a presumed deficiency in art teaching,
I note that an enterprising student here, by
dint of hard work, has equipped himself with
means for a residence in London for purposes
of art study, and goes home by the Garonne.
What does it mean ? Thanking the singers
and chorus who assisted in the reproduction
of his cantata, M. Leon Caron says :
? In order to induce a great many more to join, the
committee has fixed the members? fees at?gentlemen,
10s.; ladies, ss. per annum. Hoping this will meet
with the approval of all.?
Now, what does our French friend mean ? Is
he to reward his assistants with the above
munificent remuneration per annum ?as an
inducement,? &c., or is the privilege of assist-
ing to be paid for by the helps ?
A friend of mine, who is fond of horses and
of racing, but who does not make wagers, ex-
cited attention by his travelling by steam to
Sydney or by rail to distant points wherever
there were races. A racing man was at
length curious enough to ask him if it were
true that he attended races for the gratifi-
cation of seeing the horses run without
backing any of them. Assured that such was
the case, the gentleman said:?? Well,
really, you are not far wrong, sir, when you
come to think of it. First, the owner must
be honest; second, the trainer must be
honest; and third, so must the jockey. Now,
I admit,? he concluded, ?that one or even
two of these might be honest, but it is rather
too much to expect three men honest in
connexion with one horse !?
The illuminated address presented to that
very astute and skilful insurance manager,
Mr. T. Jaques Martin, was illustrated by an
amateur, who displays both taste and
originality. And, quoting from a description
of the testimonial, I am struck by the
singular appropriateness of the following to a
gentleman engaged in accumulating life
premiums from life policy holders. Listen :
? The group at the foot is a copy of the
society?s device, flanked on each side by
floating figures bearing votive offerings.?
In the Presbyterian Calendar for 1881 one
of the most venerable divines of that church
is described as ? Emeritus.? A teacher lately
sent the reverend gentleman a communica-
tion addressing it to the ? Rev. Dr. ,
Emeritus,? doubtless intending a delicate
compliment. But letter-carriers are not ima-
ginative. They put a literal construction on
the addendum, and returned the missive to
the sender with the endorsement, ? No such
post town in Victoria.?
It is told (and I can only hope that it has not
been already printed) that a celebrated artist
once painted an interesting picture of a rustic
boy sucking an orange as he sat barefooted
intently watching the village cobbler mend-
ing his boots. The artist called the picture
?His Only Pair.? Two stolid-looking per-
sons gazed silently at the work of art for some
time, and then intelligence beamed over the
countenance of one of them as he made a
discovery. ? Why, it isn?t a pear,? he said,
?it?s a orange.?
As two street boys, probably engaged in the
circulation of such literature as is to be found
in newspapers, looked in at Germain Nichol-
son?s window, said one to the other. ? What
are those in the bottles, Bill?? ?Olives, of
course,? said the elder boy. ?And who eats
olives ?? further pursued the lad of inquiring
mind. ?Why, epicures, you fool,? roughly
answered the mentor. ? What?s an epicure??
asked the undaunted inquirer. ? Well, an
epicure is,? and Bill paused a moment for re-
flection. ? Why, an epicure?s just a fellow
that?ll eat anything!? There have been
worse definitions. ANGLES.
Wigs OF THE WEEK.
We may fairly accept the Victorian revenue
returns issued on Thursday as exhibiting
gome signs of reviving activity and prosperity.
The signs are yet but slight, and they have
been very tardy in coming. The turn of the
tide comes to Victoria later than to any
other of the colonies, as it is quite natural
that it should, owing to the loads and fetters
with which we have encumbered our trade.
The net result of the returns is that the
quarter shows an increase of �192,518, and
the year an increase of �292,391. So
far as the year is concerned, the head of
customs yields a deficiency, as do those
of territorial, ports and harbours, and
fees, while those of excise, public works, post
and telegraphs, fines and miscellaneous ex-
hibit increases. The chief increase comes from
the new taxes that were imposed, and
cannot be taken as throwing any favour-
able light on the condition of the country.
We get no glimpse of anything at all en-
couraging till we take the returns of the last
quarter and compare these with the returns
of the similar period of 1879, We then find
an increase of �58,621 under the head of
customs, and one of �63,454 under that of
excise and inland revenue. The new tobacco
and beer duties produce �16,909. All will,
so far, welcome any sign of improvement in
the revenue that may help towards an
equilibrium of our disordered finances, almost
regardless whence it comes. But it is neces-
sary that we should keep in view the fact that
it comes not, or at the most only in the
smallest degree, from the elasticity of our
commercial transactions, but from the impo-
sition of new taxation in addition to the
grievous load we were bearing before.
The approximate gold returns of Victoria
for 1880, as given in another column, bear out
the favourable indication supplied by the
partial returns for Sandhurst and Ballarat,
to which we which have before referred.
They show that whereas the annual returns
since 1872 have year by year given a decrease
on those of the year before, those of 1880 ex-
hibit an increase. The increase is a sub-
stantial one, amounting to no less than
93,8840z., or, converted into money, �375,536-
Not only this, but there is reason to believe
that the prospects at the end of the year were
sound and good, and we may therefore hope
that the improvement will continue. All
this goes to encourage the belief that if the
miners would but consult their true interests
and demand relief from the fiscal burdens
they are so unfairly made to carry, the in-
dustry might largely develope and attain a
degree of prosperity that would recall the
days of our Golden Age.
The telegram forwarded from Stanthorpe
by Mr. Skuthorpe, stating that he has dis-
covered the grave of Classen, one of the mem-
bers of the ill-fated Leichhardt Expedition,
and also the written journals of Classen
and of Dr. Leichhardt himself, is one of sin-
gular interest. The journals, it is sur-
prising to read, are in a good state of pre-
servation, and as that of Dr. Leichhardt is
said to be complete, the inference must be
that the mystery which has so long hung
over the fate of this gallant explorer is at
length to be cleared up. The question of the
end of the Leichhardt expedition has during
the last three or four years attracted revived
interest, owing in the first instance to the state-
ments of the convict Hume, who declared that
during his long rambles in the interior of the
continent, he had learned that a white mam
a survivor of the expedition, was living
among the blacks. Hume was released from
prison to afford him the opportunity he
sought of bringing back the relics which he
affirmed existed of the party in the hands of
the natives, but he perished in the bush from
thirst and exhaustion while making the
search. Since this, Mr. Skuthorpe has fre-
quently brought the subject before the public,
and not being able to secure the assistance
he desired, he lately determined to re-
visit the Mulligan River, North Queens-
land, to test his belief by investi-
gations among the natives. These have,
according to the telegrams he forwards to Mr.
Du Faur at Sydney, been rewarded by the
fullest success, and this long-kept secret of
the wilderness is, we may assume, about to
be made known. It is now upwards of 33
years since Leichhardt started from More-
ton Bay on the journey to Swan River
through the vast unknown interior. The last
that was heard from him was in February,
1848, when he wrote from the Canning Downs,
stating the route he proposed to travel. Since
that his fate has been a blank till the present
time, in spite of the frequent attempts made
to trace it,and the still more frequent rumours
that have been published on the subject. It
will indeed be singular if the same year, 1880,
which saw the discovery of the last relics
of the Franklin Expedition by Lieutenant
Schwatkar, should also include the discovery
by Mr. Skuthorpe of the relics of the brave
German who, a couple of years after the
Arctic explorer sailed on his ill-fated journey,
perished in trying to solve the secret of the
Australian continent.
The programme of the doll show, to take
place at the Town-hall, which we give in our
advertising columns, is likely to have an effect
of stimulating the inventive little brains of
many youngsters to devise striking or attrac-
tive puppet personages, and their clever little
fingers to execute them. For the promoters
of the undertaking have had in view not only
the amusement of the juvenile population,
who are to have an exhibition ? all to them-
selves,? but also their education in works
of design and construction. Special prizes
are provided for children, and many of
the competitions, such those for dolls?
houses, &c., are well suited to exercise
the ingenuity of young competitors. We
need only refer to the prize-list given in our
advertising columns for particulars, but what
the promoters, we believe, wish specially to
insist upon is the fact that no one is asked
for contributions, but only for exhibits, as at
an ordinary exhibition. If competitors are
willing to present their exhibits the com-
mittee will be glad to accept them in the in-
terest of the charity to be benefited by the
show, but if not they are at perfect liberty to
retain the ownership. It is fair to assume
that a very curious and, to the young public,
highly attractive exhibition will be the out-
come of the undertaking.
That was rather a significant statement
which was made by Mr. Mann, the Treasurer of
South Australia, when supporting the arrange-
ments the Government had entered into at
the late conference. In the course of his re-
marks he said, ?As regards the intercolonial
railway connexion, the policy of South Aus-
tralia, he contended, should be to draw the
bonds of union close with New South
Wales, as her policy had more sympathy
with theirs. Communication with Mel-
bourne was a secondary consideration.? On
these grounds he proceeded to justify the
formation of a railway to Wentworth to meet
the New South Wales line and the Victorian
line at that point. ? The additional dis-
tance to Melbourne via Wentworth, as
against Border Town, was only about 75
miles, while as regards Sydney there was
an advantage of 300 miles.? But it is
not so much the particular matter of
discussion to which we desire to draw at-
tention as the general principle that commu-
nication with Melbourne is a secondary con-
sideration, owing to the closer resemblance
of the policy of New South Wales to that of
South Australia. To this point has the
isolating policy of Berryism brought Victoria,
that the neighbouring colonies regard com-
munication with her metropolis as only a
secondary matter. The instance is of im-
portance as showing how the feeling is ripen-
ing in the adjoining colonies that may make
the formation of a union amongst themselves
to the exclusion of this colony an actual fact
before we know where we are. Mr, Berry
looks on at the possibility with easy
fatuous complacency, but we think there is
too much common sense in the mind of the
public to allow this silly sentiment to become
a general one. That the views of the South
Australian Government on the desirability of
drawing closer to New South Wales are
shared by the Parliament we may infer from
the fact that the bill to give effect to the con*


THE AUSTRALASIAN.
[Jan. 15, 1831.
vention made with Sir Henry Parkes was
carried through both Houses without opposi-
tion.
We with willingness give space for the
publication of tbe letter in another part of
our issue in which the Rev. Geo. Brown, of
the New Britain Mission, offers his defence
in regard to the charges made against him
with reference to the hostilities against the
natives of the group, in which he took an
active part. But we cannot say that the
arguments adduced by Mr. Brown in any way
shake our opinion that the course he took
was an unfortunate one, and one in which a
missionary of a religion of peace had no right
to embark. We fully admit that the position
in which he found himself after the
massacre of the teachers was a painful
one, and that to a brave, determined,
and high-spirited man the impulse to
energetic action must have been well-nigh
irresistible. We should not like to determine
the exact conditions under which a mis
sionary of Christianity is entitled as a man to
resort to deadly weapons for the purpose o
self-defence. The greatest and most success
ful missionaries have, we believe, been those
who have accepted absolutely and without
limitation the principle of non-resistance, and
who have taken their lives in their hands as a
sacrifice if called for. It is certainly not for
us to impose this obligation on anyone. But
we think that everyone must admit that the
obligation to limit acts of belligerency to the
strictest self-defence is paramount and impe-
rative. And this is the point where Mr. Bro wn?s
justification quite breaks down. We should
not attach implicit authority to the opinions
of naval officers or South Sea traders in
determining the duty of a minister of the
Gospel in such an exigency. All impartial
persons must feel, after reading Mr. Brown?s
letter, that whatever is to be said in pallia-
tion, when we have a missionary of religion
engaged in either leading or assisting in a
war that was one of retribution or one of
what we may call anticipative defence ?like
Sir Bartle Frere?s Zulu campaign, which is
now condemned on all sides?he is in a
radically false position. There is no demand
on any man to go to teach religion to savage
cannibals, but there is an imperative demand
on all to refrain from needless bloodshedding.
It is not an unreasonable limit to impose on
missionary zeal, that it should confine its
labours to lands where it can dispense with
those carnal weapons which, of late, English
missionaries at many remote points of the
world have been accused of using too
freely.
There seems great reason to believe that
the season will be one of great danger from
fierce and uncontrollable bush fires. Through-
out the southern and eastern parts of the
continent the spring rains were plentiful and
continuous, and caused a very strong growth
of grass, which the sudden advent of hot
summer has converted into material of the
moat highly inflammable character. Thus
there are all the preliminary conditions re-
quisite for bush fires of the strongest and
most destructive character, and all that is
wanted is the spark to supply ignition. That
the peril we speak of is more than a mere
speculation is shown in terribly lurid
characters by the appalling narrative of the
bush fire which, in the last days of the year,
destroyed nearly a whole family near Frank-
lin Harbour in South Australia. With
a full recollection of the shocking destruc-
tion of a whole family, save a little child, in
the neighbourhood of Colac about two years
ago, it seems to us that the account of this
catastrophe which befel the unfortunate
M'Carthys is the most pathetic and most
tragic narrative of disaster from bush fire
which we have ever seen in print. We can
imagine no more frightful fall from ease and
comfort to the depth of misery, than that
involved in this case, where M'Carthy was,
while quietly reaping his crop about a mile
from his house, driven from his work
by a ? solid flame of fire 40ft. high,?
and after a narrow escape with his life,
found on returning to the ashes of his
house the charred bodies of his wife
and six children among the smoking
ruins. And then that terrible voyage taken
by M'Carthy during a day and a night, with
the blackened remains of his family, in an
open boat to the nearest port, all helps to
make up a story wanting in no circumstance
of pathos and horror. It would be cruel to
recite the dread circumstances of this catas-
trophe were there no object in emphasising the
terrible peril in which families exist in the
bush in such a season as the present. It is,
possibly, the case that no care and precau-
tion?which, it is well to remark, means
caution beforehand?could fully obviate the
danger. But, at least, it can be reduced.
Means can be taken that will sometimes stop
the sweep of small fires and retard the march
of even great ones. At any rate, it is an
obligatory duty to take every possible means
that is available that may guard against, and
at least mitigate, one of the greatest dangers
of life in the bush.
The letter in another column of a ? Roman
Catholic,?on thesubjectof ?Heresy Hunting,?
is noticeable for the naif and simple - minded
expression it gives to the views by which the
heresy hunters are guided. The case, as it
appears to this correspondent, is a very simple
one. When the question arises of the
strict orthodoxy of a minister, all that has to
be done is to ascertain if his teaching is in
accordance with the standards of the church,
and if not, out he must go. He defends this
view by arguments and comparisons, all of
which are legal ones, and he evidently has
no suspicion that there can be any other.
The writer assumes with the heresy hunters
that once standards are framed they are
framed for ever. The confession is everything,
the church is nothing. A creed once adopted
must be held to all time, and cannot be
altered, however men?s opinions have
changed or new knowledge has accrued on (he
subject in dispute. If in a primitive, semi-
barbarous time it was held that the world was
made in six days, then the church must go
on pretending to hold,and at any rate teaching,
this doctrine for ever, even when the world
and the church both know that it is not true.
That this system is productive of unreality
andghypocrisy, and opens the wayj-to men
prosecuting a candid brother for disbelief in
doctrines which they have ceased to hold
themselves, is looked upon as not worth
considering. All of the assumptions made by
the prosecuting side are fundamentally op-
posed to those of the advanced reformer, who
has come to see in a different light some of
the standards of his church. He could, of
course, settle the difficulty at once by leaving
his church. But he holds that the church is
something much greater, more real, and more
important than its creeds. Creeds change
with the changes in the minds of men, change
or dwindle away, but the church remains a
living reality. It is, he believes, far more im-
portant that the church should hold what is
true than that it should hold what seemed
to be true to men of less knowledge, and less
advanced mental and spiritual development
centuries ago. He cannot see that these men
of the past have any prerogative over the
men of the present, and he denies the
right of those sturdy champions of
truth and progress in bygone ages to
fetter champions of truth and progress
to-day. We are not now attempting to
to decide between these two sides of the con-
troversy. We merely seek to show that there
are two sides, and that it is discussing the
subject to very little purpose if we begin and
end, as our correspondent does, by assuming
that there is but one.
The short special session lately held by
the South Australian Parliament to validate
the steps taken by the Government, in accord-
ance with the agreement lately entered into
at the Melbourne Intercolonial Conference,
was in several respects a noticeable one.
Indeed, were it not that some of its more
especial characteristics might, possibly, be
owing to the desire of members to get
through the business, and to escape from the
unwonted demands of work in the midst of
the holiday season, we should be almost
sanguine enough to regard it as indicating a
new political departure. It was not only
that there was a marked disposition to lay
aside party spirit and to discuss the ques-
tions before them amicably and on their
merits. It was not only that though
some important constitutional questions re-
garding the course taken by the Government
were raised, and properly raised, they were
dealt with without the least desire to use
them as weapons of party warfare. Neither
was it only that remarkable personal good
feeling was exhibited on both sides of both
Houses, and that in the Upper House a long-
standing feud between two conspicuous poli-
ticians was healed by a reconciliation. But
what struck us aa the particularly hopeful
aspect of the debates was the disposition
to discuss intercolonial questions in an
intercolonial spirit, aloof from the petty
feeling of provincialism which so often
defaces our Parliamentary discussions.
Both Houses evidently shared in the
desire expressed by the Government to
draw the ties of association between the
colonies closer together. It is pleasant to
notice such a symptom in the Parliament of
an Australian colony, and the more so
because it has hitherto been so rare. It
would not be fair to end this short notice
without reference to the masterly speech of
Mr. Fowler, the able colleague of Mr. Mann
at the late conference. Mr. Fowler showed a
knowledge of his subject and a capacity of
dealing with it in the spirit of a statesman,
which fully entitled him to the commenda-
tion he received, and which marked him out
as a rising figure in South Australian
politics.
There are again signs of trouble among the
coal-miners at Newcastle. On one side this
is not much to be wondered at, as prices are
very low, and, perhaps, likely to be lower,
and it would only be in accordance with their
usual style of reasoning if miners were to con-
sider that this condition would best be
remedied by a strike. On the other side,
the prospects of a strike are as unpro-
pitious as it is possible to imagine, as it is
understood that two or three of the com-
panies meditate a suspension of work till
better times come round. The miners of one
of the companies have passed a resolution that
they should demand an advance of 6d. per
ton, instead of accepting any further reduction
as provided by the sliding scale accepted as
the settlement of the dispute some months
ago. Such a step wears the aspect of not
only being very imprudent in prefering a de-
mand for higher wages in face of a falling
market, but it is also open to the more
serious objection of involving the repudiation
of a settlement arrived at by an accepted
arbitration. And this, again, would have the
effect of making it practically impossible
to obtain help from arbitration in any
future contest. It may be that the present
symptoms of uneasiness in the mining dis-
tricts will pass off, and that prudent counsels
will prevail. Certainly it would seem to im-
partial observers that no more unsuitable
time for urging the demands which are being
discussed among the men could be chosen
than the present.
In the absence of any actual occurrences for
the time being in the political life of the
colony, the Opposition newspapers in New
Zealand have launched boldly into the world
of fiction, and have succeeded by their dis-
coveries in very much improving the interest
of the position. The point to which most of
their revelations bore reference was the rela-
tions between the new Governor, Sir Arthur
Gordon, and his Ministers. It was decided
that these were very bad?indeed, constantly
on the verge of open rupture. This was
demonstrated by evidence of three kinds,
which we may describe as d priori , inferen-
tial, and historical. By the first it was
proved before the arrival of Sir Arthur
Gordon in the colony that his intense
admiration and friendship for Sir George
Grey would at once induce him to apply for
advice to that ill-appreciated politician, and
especially with regard to native matters.
And the result would be that the wickedness
of Ministers would be exposed, and they
would possibly be dismissed by a philan-
thropic and constitutional Governor to the
shades of Opposition. The proof inferential
was based on the mission of Captain Knollys,
the Governor?s aide-de-camp, to visit the
prophet Te Whiti at Parihaka. This it was
at once seen by these acute authorities
could only have been done on the initiative
of the Governor and in opposition to the
wishes of his Cabinet. The proof historical
did not deal with speculation or deduction.
It was a circumstantial record of facts.
Ministers were very much incensed to find
Sir Arthur Gordon calling himself High
Commissioner of the Western Pacific, and
even prefixing this title to that of Governor
of New Zealand. As the readiest way of
bringing His Excellency to his senses,
Ministers who had up to that time been
almost afraid to approach him, owing to his
frigid and haughty manners, adopted the
resolute and gentlemanly course of threaten-
ing him that they would stop his salaryunless
he abandoned the offensive designation. All
this goes to show that the New Zealand Oppo-
sition papers have not been wanting in in-
teresting matter during the dull times of Par-
liamentary recess, and when it is added that
the whole matter, so far as it represents the
existence of any other than the most cor-
dial and constitutional relations between
the Governor and his Ministers, is a tissue
of fabrications, the inventive powers of these
journals are seen to be quite equal to their
enterprising zeal to afford the latest and
most accurate information to the public.
We receive from various sources this week
several narratives of outrage and massacre in
the South Seas. A South Sea trading vessel
named the Hong Kong reports on arrival at
Sydney that she was attacked by natives at
Leveade Island towards the end of October,
when her crew were overpowered andallkilled
except the captain. We hear from Brisbane
of the Tanna natives firing on the boats of
the Jabberwock. The schooner Zephyr, Cap-
tain Marshall, of Sydney, was seizedat Wonda,
and the crew were massacred in what is
called native fashion. Some particulars are
also given of the massacre of the crew of the
Borealis in September last at Maylata Island-
We get fuller details of the massacre of the
crew of the Prosperity by the natives of
Moresby Island, whence we learn that the
unfortunate men were beheaded and their re-
mains smoke-dried, and placed as trophies in
the mission-house. The heads were sent
round the villages. Some of the acts of out.
rage and murder we have heard of before
from other sources, but their aggregate is a
truly formidable one. The narratives bring
strongly before us the conditions of peril
under which this terrible trade is carried on.
The natural feeling on reading them is to call
for decisive Government measures to punish
the authors of these atrocities, but, unfortu.
nately for this demand, a despatch giving the re-
suits of the voyage of retribution lately made
by the French war steamer D?Estrees to New
Guinea, puts in a very strong light the
futility of expecting any remedy from this
quarter. It will be remembered that great
expectations were entertained from the voyage
of the D?Estrees, and unfavourable compari-
sons were drawn between the prompt deter-
mination shown by French authorities and
the tardy caution of the English commanders.
But what is the result? We learn that the
issue of the inquiries made on the spot was
to make it rather doubtful where the massacre
of the naturalists was committed. The French
?destroyed 118 houses and all the planta-
tions, but were unable to shoot many of the
murderers, onaccountof the difficulty of track-
ing them through the scrub and mountain
ranges.? Again?" The ship did not visit
Brooker Island. The piratical nest there
remains untouched.? In fact, the ex-
pedition is, in every point of view,
a failure. Commanders cannot afford
to send their men into the heart of
dense forests peopled by desperate savages.
So they contrive to shoot a few of the
laggards of the runaways, burn down the
villages, and lay waste the plantations. And
the next crew of peaceful traders which fall
into the hands of the islanders pay for all.
It does not appear a very business-like
system of procedure, whether it is regarded
as a means of spreading civilisation, or of
executing justice, or of securing the lives of
sailors and traders.
EHTERTAIIWEKTS.
THE THEATRES, &c.
The several Christmas productions are ap-
parently quite satisfactory to the public, so
that at the Theatre Royal, ?Sinbad the
Sailor? shows no signs of waning popularity ;
at the Opera-house ? La Fille du Tambour-
Major? is yet on the high-tide of prosperity ;
and at the Bijou ? Little Goody Two Shoes ??
brings every night happy children in front of
the footlights to see equally happy children
behind them.
At the Novelty the discontinuance of Mr.
Emery?s connexion with the theatre caused
a break of two nights, and on Saturday the
house reopened with a modified company
and a drama entitled ? Father and Son.?
At the People?s, on Friday night last,
Miss Watt-Tanner played Lady Isabel in
? East Lynne? with much dramatic power,
Mr. Hamilton appearing in the character
of Levison. On the following night
the play of ? The Man from America?
was revived. This is the piece in which
Mr. J. J. Wallace made his first ap-
pearance at the Theatre Royal, in June,
1878. At that time the opinion of those
who saw the piece was that it was an Irish
drama with comic interpolations. It was
pronounced to be a very absurd Irish drama,
but then most Irish dramas are absurd, and
so this one did not seem very different from
the average of that kind of play. But it
did not occur to anybody that it was
intended as a burlesque. It was, in-
deed, suggested that some of the scenes
had been conceived in a burlesque spirit,
and that they were ridiculous travesties of
grave facts; but it was not perceived that
the whole play was a joke. Now, however,
after seeing it again, the obviousness of the
intention of the author makes one wonder it
was not obvious before. To be sure, it is a
clumsy joke; nevertheless, it is a joke, just
as much as ?Pinafore? is a joke, only
? Pinafore ? is a joke full of bright humour,
and fine wit, and pleasant music, and there is
neither wit, music, nor humour in ? The
Man from America.? The notion is a good
one of making the principal character in a
piece an impertinent parenthesis, and if such
a piece had been written by Messrs. Gilbert
and Sullivan, they would probably have made
it very attractive ; but the inventor of ? The
Man from America? did not go beyond the
projection of the idea. One cannot feel
sure, indeed, that he did not take his
Irish drama from a pile of Irish dramas,
and simply put in the ? Man,? who is
understood to be the celebrated George
Francis Train, one of those remarkable
persons whose eccentricities leave one in
doubt whether to consider them madmen or
geniuses. On the assumption that the two terms
mean the same thing, the difficulty of estimat-
ing them is lessened. As was pointed out before,
the fault of this character is that it is point-
less. That is to say, apart from the point of
his coming in at times and places where he is
not wanted, and with which circumstances he
has no sort of connexion, he is only a vapid
person. He makes speeches of the tumidly
oratorical kind, but they are too dull to be in
fitting relation with burlesque. Such a cha-
racter ought to have been written in the Jules
Verne spirit. He should advance projects of
the Baron Munchausen kind, and urge their
adoption with sustained gravity, arguing
always in favour of impossibilities?
say, for instance, a grand canal across
the Australian continent, or a submarine
railway between here and New Zealand.
The speeches that Mr. Wallace, as the
? Man,? delivers are of the pattern of
which one hears so many when the Victorian
Parliament is sitting. It will be seen, there-
fore, that this is a burlesque at which one
cannot laugh, a jest requiring explanation, a
pleasantry that is too much like a bttise to be
diverting. Necessarily, the cast of the play
is quite different from that of two years and
a half ago. In some respects it is better, in
some worse. If every part were played per-
fectly, there would be nothing to boast of,
and if no part were played well, there would
be nothing lost. The heroine, such aa she
is, is in much more capable hands than
formerly?that is to say, in Miss Watt-
Tanner?s, who looks just such a magnificent
Irish maiden as men would fight about,
and who bears herself consistently with
her appearance?that is, so far as the
negativeness of the character will per-
mit. W'hen Miss Watt-Tanner plays a
part in which picturesqueness is a con-
dition of success she succeeds com-
pletely. The virtuous peasant who commits
no wrong, but against whose peace and
security there is perpetual plotting, is now
played by Mr. Collier ; and the funny man?
that is to say, the man who would be funny
if the author had given him any opportunity
of being so?is represented by Mr. J. Foley,
a gentleman who appears to have consider-
able capacity for humour, and who, one of
these days, when he gets a good opportunity,
will not neglect it. Mr. Douglas does the
villany, and there is a good deal to do of a
dull sort; and Mr. Elliott is the Captain,
and he is dull, too; and Mr. Warner is
the Lieutenant, and he also is dull per-
force ; and all the rest are dull, for
how could they be otherwise? Everybody
works hard, but it is Sysiphus kind of work,
nothing comes of it ; the stone rolls back, no
matter how often it is rolled up. And you
come away marvelling that men should write
such dull plays, and that good actors and
actresses should play them.
When this piece was done at the Royal,
Mr. Hennings painted some good scenery for
it; but it was scenery wasted. The artist and
the manager of the People?s know better than
to waste good scenery for such a piece. You
may say, if you like, that the artist made a
merit of necessity ; or, if you do not say it,
you will be sure to think it, if you know
what good scenery means.
The programme at St. George?s-hall during
the week has included the extravaganza of
? His Grace the Duke,? which, it will be re-
membered, was done when first the Kelly and
Leon company appeared. Perhaps you have
sometimes wondered if ever a time will come
when minstrels will avail themselves of all
the advantages which good stage-setting can
communicate. Nobody questions the talent
of Kelly and Leon?s company, but the extem-
porised quality of their stage-setting makes
one wish it could be seen in the better light
of complete scenic adjuncts. One can see
how wonderfully an attention to this kind of
requirement helps the effect, and contributes
to the success, in the case of ?La Fille
du Tambour-Major.? Doubtless Offenbach?s
work would go very well, even if it were
less liberally garnished, but it is no less cer-
tain that the garnishing lures the liking of
those who see it to a very large extent. Miss
Laverne is exquisite; Mr. Mervin is ad-
mirable ; Mr. Harwood is irresistible; Miss
Jessie Grey is delicious, and the military are
models of beauty; but the dresses go beyond
all ordinary tailoring, and Mr. Habbe?s
scenery would make him illustrious even if
we had never heard of him before. So that
the Minstrels might profitably consider
whether they could not with advantage
borrow a hint from Mr. Musgrove?a manage-
ment at the Opera-house.
The little company of Millis and Croft?a
Froliques at Kitts? Music-hall would be un-
justly dealt with if they were not mentioned
with particular commendation. They are
not numerous, but they have more merit
than some companies with treble their num-
bers, and ten times their pretensions.
The circus (St. Leon?s) has struck its tent,
and marched onwards. Mr. St. Leon issued
a challenge to all mankind to do what ho
could do. As nobody accepted his challenge,
it is to be concluded that he can do what the
rest of mankind cannot. Let those who saw
him do it be comforted that they have
witnessed such wonders as he is able to do.
On Sunday morning, at St. Patrick?s Cathe-
dral, there was music worth the listening to.
Let us hope it is not a profane thing to men-
tion Mr. Plumpton?s mass among ? Theatres*
&c.,? but you see the ? &c.? is very compre-
hensive, and may include a great deal which
is not theatrical. There are certain persona
who declare that certain kinds of religious
worship are theatrical. But these may be
allowed to pass uncommented upon. If we
are to carry out the counsel, that whatsoever
our hands find to do we are to do it with our
might, then it is our manifest duty to make
worship as beautiful as possible, and if art be,
as some wise men have said, the handmaid
of devotion, then a mass, written by a
capable composer, and ably conducted
by the composer himself, must better
the effect of the ceremonial of which it
is a part. Technically speaking, Mr.
Plumpton?s mass is a work which de-
serves to become classical; devotionalljr
considered it lifts one?s grosser thoughts high
up beyond this grovelling earth, and as an
effort of fine art, it puts its author upon a
higher plane than he has yet reached to, and
you know that he has mounted to a consider-
able height already. Of the crowd who
thronged St. Patrick?s Cathedral Church on
Sunday morning last there were few who did
not feel better for listening to Mr. Pkunpton?a
beautiful music.
TOWN HEWS.
We are desired to mention that the P. and
0. Company?s Royal mail steamers will in
future leave Williamstown on Wednesdays
(commencing with the Cathay, on the 19th
inst), at 1 p.m., instead of 11 a.m., as
already notified.
It is now ascertained that the Hon. James
Service, the present leader of the Opposition
in the Assembly, will leave for England by
the P. and 0. mail steamer, appointed to sail
in the first week in March. The members of
the Opposition have decided to entertain Mr.
Service before he takes his departure. Since
the proposal was mooted and approved of,
it has been suggested that the company
should not be limited to members of Par-
liament, but that public men of all posi-
tions should be admitted to share in the
festivities. The views of Mr. Service will
be consulted before any final action ia
taken.
The Chief Secretary returned to town from
Lome on Thursday, and attended for a short;
time in his office in the afternoon.
To show the respect and regard which the
electors of Brighton entertain for their repre-
sentative, Mr. J. C, Campbell, chairman of
Mr. Bent?s committee at the late election,
on Thursday?in the name ofSthe electors and
friends of the hon. member?presented a
cheque for 100 guineas to Mrs. Bent.
All applications for employment in the
Railway department have, in future, to be
made to Mr. Elsdon, the engineer- in-chief
and general manager, and not to the Minister*
Mr. Patterson having decided not to inter-
fere in any way with the appointments of
employes. Mr. Elsdon has also taken pos-
session of the Minister?s quarters, and Mr.
Patterson has removed to a room at the rear
of the engineer-in-chief?s offices. With respect
to the issue of free railway passes, the Railway
department wish it to be distinctly under-
stood that they have been discontinued to
the general public. In the event of applica-
tions being refused no reply will be sent to
the applicant, it being found that the whole
time of one clerk was taken up in answering
unsuccessful applicants. Mr. Patterson haa
drawn up certain regulations under which
free passes may be granted, and these are to
be strictly adhered to.
The Minister of Education has decided on
some important changes with regard to sing-
ing and drawing masters. A number of these
officers are to be dispensed with, and those
retained are to devote a portion of their time
to instructing state school teachers, who are
to receive a second-class licence as soon aa
they are competent to teach these subjects*
though not able to pass the inspectors foe
certificate of competency. There are at
present 98 school teachers qualified to teach
singing, and 94 qualified to teach drawing.
In making promotions, those qualified ia
these subjects will have the preference. It
is anticipated that the reductions will effect a
saving of �5,000 a year. The drawing and sing-
ing masters whose services are dispensed with
will receive as compensation a month?s salary
for every year of service, and the compensations
will amount to about �2,500. Eight drawing-
masters and 15 singing-masters are dispensed
with. The following are the names of the
gentlemen retained : Drawing-masters
Peppercorn, Wilson, Tayler, Kirkland, Hay-
ward. Singing-masters?Allan, Bonwick,
Ruxton, Ford, Johnson, Renny, Perraton*
Hervey, Lang, Crooke, and Miss Binns.
All the school inspectors have been brought
to Melbourne to assist in the examination of
the papers sent in at the state school exami-
nations all over the country for licences to
teach, &c. The result will be known about
the end of the month, instead of after the
lapse of nearly six months, as was the case
when there were only three examiners to go
through the papers.
The Hon. T, MTI wraith, the Premier of
