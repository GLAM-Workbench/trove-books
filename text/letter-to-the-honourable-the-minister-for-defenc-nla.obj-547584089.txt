The Honurable
The Minister for Defence
COPY.
German Concentration Camp,
Liverpool, 20th July 1916.
Senator G.J. Pearce,
Melbourne.
Sir: -
In view of the published statement of the Minister for Defence,
Commonwealth of Australia,- that the living-conditions os Civilians in-
terned in Australia shall be approxemately equal to the same standard
Civilian Internees enjoy at Ruhlehen-Germany- we beg to place before
the Commonwealth Government a comparison of conditions existing at Ruh-
leben and Liverpool Camps and request that the standard of organisa-
tion, equipment and general conditions of Liverpool Camp be raised to
that of Ruhleben at the earliest opportunity in conformity with the
Ministers anouncement.
We are enabled to give a quite unbiased description of Ruhleben
Camp as the gentleman furnishing us with the details thereof,Mr. T.
Kleine, was interned at Ruhleben for a period of months for being
a naturalised Australian subject and, having been exchanged in December
1915 to England, is now interned here. This gentleman has a grievance
against both the German and the Australian Governments and cannot be
accused of partiality.

Internees' demands to visit their

Bush timber at own expense shelters
for their wives and families. A
body- and parcels search of Inter-
nees is made on leaving and re-ent-
ering Camp.
Parcels of Internees' wives have
been searched also. Any wine or Beer
in very small quantities found in
their possession was confiscated
and consumed by the guards in the

Recently 12 hours leave to Sydney

We now beg to make the following suggestions to improve the
conditions of Liverpool Camp:
CAMP SPACE: To be double its present size.
BARRACKS; That six men only occupy the space now occupied
by ten men, as owing to the congested conditions
of barracks and the present packing methods
employed, the barracks are extremely noisy and
aggravating to live in, That washing of face and
hands be permitted in add between barracks.
FOOD: That greater variety be supplied especially
fruit and more vegetables.
CLOTHING: To supply woollen underpants and socks in addition.
That 3 heavy army blankets be supplied zo each In-
ternee or corresponding weight in lighter blankets*
SANITARY CONDITIONS: To increase the present urinals in number and
accessability; one latrine to be placed on eastern
parade ground. To partition individual seats in
lavatories.
To give entire Camp Tar treatment in order to
allay duststorms*
BATHING FACILITIES: To be properly protected and to be provided with
wooden floors. Number of showers to be increased.
Wash-PLAOES: To be increased in number* That water be obtain-
-10.


able at all times between Barracks, one large
faucet to every four barracks.
HOSPITAL: That Doctor and Dentist maintain Consulting
Rooms in Camp. That medical Internees be permitted
to practice in Camp in emergency cases and to be
provided with instruments and materials. Had this
been permitted and done hitherto the life of a re-
cent suicide could probably have been saved.
That Internees be permitted to take and receive
Patent Medicines and Drugs into Camp.
LIGHTING: That Camp be lighted with sufficient Arclamps,
That Barracks, Theatre, Lavatories and Urinals
be efficiently lighted by electricity.
KANTEEN: To be managed exclusively by Internees. All pro-
fits to be returned to Camp Fund. Profits made
in the past to be calculated on the admitted
first years profits per capita time basis of
Internees and that the total net profit up to
June Ist 1916 thus derived be returned to In-
ternees to be divided on the Time basis of each
Individual’s Internment.
OUTMARCHES: That owing to the confined space of the Camp,
although to be enlarged as we hope and to ease
mental strain due to confinement, companies of
Internees be taken for frequent halfday-marches
into the surrounding country.
LAUNDRY: To be established by Government in the Camp.
11.


LIBRARY AND READING ROOMS: Instead of Iron Bedsteads and Furniture
to be supplied to construct and furnish 1 large-
library with two large reading rooms attached,
lighted by electricity and heated in winter.
GENERAL TREATMENT: That parades be holt three times a week. That
Internees be treated with civility and to be
addressed when spoken or written to as Mr.
That jailing of internees only be applied as
an extreme measure especially that the present
method of jailing of Internees in the morning
and bringing them only in the evening before the
Commandant for trial be abolished.
That recapturod escapees be no longer treated
as criminals.
NE77SPAPERS: That "Sydney Sun" (daily,Sundays Included)
be sold in Camp in addition. That all papers
and magazines forwarded by friends be allowed
to enter Gamp. That American and Australian
periodicals and magazines be .sold at Kanteen.
POSTAL* That present severe regulations be released.
That telegrams be permitted to be sent.
MONEY MATTERS: That constant work be supplied to all appll-
cants.
VISITORS VISITS: That the privilege to receive visitors every
second Sunday be extended to all Internees.


LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO INTERNETS: To be granted as is customary at
Ruhleben. That married Internees be permitted to vi
visit their families every fortnight on parole
from Saturday evening to Sunday eve. That Inter-
nees when wives and relations visit them at the
Camp, be permitted to leave Camp every second
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p. m. on' parole.
INTERNEES LUGGAGE. That all luggage and parcels lost while in tran-
sit be made good in cash without further delay.
That steps be taken to assure the safe arrival
of Internees’ goods, in transit.
GENERAL REMARKS: That Camp Cooks be paid by Government,
That the money realized on the sales of Pat
and Kitchen Offal be credited to Camp Fund
without deductions.
We have the Honor to be,
Sir,
Yours obediently, ‘
(sgd) Zimmermann, Camp President.
