HISTORICAL NOTE.
This ceremony, strictly speaking, is a guard-mounting ceremony, and dates from the
eighteenth century, when the Battalion finding Guard for the day trooped the Colour which
was to be carried on the King's Guard.
The first definite mention of trooping in relation to guard mounting is probably in an
order issued by the Duke of Cumberland on 15 th January, 1755. The extract is as follows :
"Orders for Parading of Guards in Quarters or Garrison."
"If there be a Guard which mounts with Colours, the Captain is to send for them
"in form, the Ensign advancing his Espontoon posts himself at the head of the detach-
"ment which is to go for the Colours, and the Captain, having ordered the said detach-
"ment to 'poise and rest their firelocks on the left arm,' orders them to 'march,' the
"drummers beating the troop."

"TROOPING THE COLOUR"
An Ancient Military Ceremonial Admirably Re-enacted by the Scottish Regiment.
(By Captain J. R. Patrick, President, Highland Society of N.S.W.)
THIS is an ancient Military Ceremonial, having
been performed by British Regiments for up-
wards of 300 years.
The following extract from Army Historical Re-
search Records fully explains its meaning:—
"In the 17th Century, it was the custom be-
fore a Battalion or a Company was dismissed
to quarters, bivouac or billets, to troop the
Colour or Colours down the ranks; and the
Ensigns then taking their Colours to their lodg-
ings and displaying them from the window or
door-step or from the entrance to their tent,
the Battalion or Company trooped past the
Colour, and so came to know, in case of alarm,
the place of their rallying point."
Conversely, in sending for the Colours, a similar
ceremony was again performed, vide the same re-
cords. In sending for the Colours, the following
rules were observed:—
"The Battalion having been formed up and
dressed, and the Officers having taken post,
the Colours were sent for. The Captain of
the Grenadier Company . . . ordered them to
advance their arms, and marched them to a
place where the Colours were lodged. As soon
as the escort arrived at the place where the
Colours were lodged, the Company was drawn
up . . . and the Captain ordered firelocks to be
shouldered. When the Ensign had received the
Colours, the Company presented arms, and the
drummers and fifers played 'a point of war.'
They marched back to the Battalion with the
Colours flying. On their approaching the left
of the Battalion, the Colonel ordered 'Present
your Arms.' The Grenadiers made two wheels
to the left . . . the officers and Colours in
front of the line of Officers (the rest of the
Escort marching between the ranks of the
Battalion). As the Colours passed along the
line of Officers, each Officer removed his hat."
In passing, a few notes on the origin of the
Salutes, the Present Arms and the Officers' Salute
with their swords, may not be out of place. The
"Present Arms" implies the gesture of offering one's
weapons to the person saluted, and is regarded as
the highest compliment a soldier can pay. The
Officers' salute with the sword, embodies the old
Crusaders' custom of kissing the cross-hilts of their
swords, after drawing, or before returning them,
thus the position of the sword at the "Recover,"
the hilt in line with the mouth, is the embodiment
of this very old custom.
The Trooping, nowadays, has been modified to
suit present conditions, and as a Military Spectacle
is unsurpassed. The Trooping of the Colours by
the Brigade of Guards at Whitehall, with their
massed bands, or the Scottish Regiments at Edin-
burgh, with their Pipers and Bands, are spectacles
once seen are never forgotten, for their magnificent
bearing and military precision.
Those of us who were fortunate enough to be
present at the "Trooping of the Colour" by our
own 30th Battalion (Scottish Regiment), feel the
same pride in this efficiently performed Ceremonial;
and the greatest credit is due to the Commanding
Officer, Officers and all ranks for their highly
efficient and spectacular display. . The marching
was excellent, the movements of the arms carried
precise, and the manner of carrying out all orders
made a profound impression on the spectators, who
were loud in their praise of this impressive cere-
monial. The daily press commented on it as "The
finest Military Parade the Commonwealth has seen,"
and it is to be hoped, in spite of all the time
occupied in its preparation by Officers and Men,
that it may become an annual event and celebrate
the King's Birthday, as in the Homeland, or Empire
Day, as the Trooping so closely coincided with this
year.
Without in any way detracting from the generally
high standard of the whole Parade, the Drill and
precision of No. 1 Guard, acting as Escort to the
Colours, under Major Banner, Lieutenant K. Pat-
rick and Lieutenant Hill, was particularly noticeable
and deserving of commendation.
I feel sure that all those of the Society who were
fortunate enough to witness this brilliant display,
will feel justified in their earlier support of the
foundation of the Scottish Regiment, and pride in
their association with it.

BROADCASTING AT STATION 2CH
(By Fred. W. Wbirter.)
ARIEL, in Shakespear's "Tempest", speaks of
putting a girdle round the earth. When
Shakespeare wrote these words he meant them
only as faery talk, but now, of course, Marconi has
made the impossible possible, and words are sent
round the earth in the flash of a spark. We have
often listened-in to the "Scottish Reveries," given
by Mr. John Davis at Station 2CH on Thursday
nights at a quarter to ten, and were curious to
know just exactly how it was done; therefore we
were delighted when Mr. T. Spencer, the genial
manager through whose good offices the "Reveries"
have betn continued, although the Scottish societies
had discontinued their subscriptions, invited us up
to see the broadcasting at the station, which is at
the top of Grace Brothers Building, at the corner
of King and York Streets.
We were ushered into a large room carpeted with
felt, on which footsteps were soundless. In the far
left-hand corner of the room stoood two grand
pianofortes, and in the right-hand corner was an-
other microphone, a ship's bell, ship's engine-room
telegraph, and a wooden cabinet containing all sorts
of gadgets to give various effects, such as a door
which banged, tht whistle and noise of a train in
motion, and other things.
On our left, as we entered the room, stood Mr.
Philip Geeves, the clever young announcer and
producer, who is not only a very fountain of in-
formation concerning radio, but is an accomplished
linguist, speaking three or four languages fluently,
including English. He stood in the midst of a num-
ber of revolving discs on which he was carefully
placing gramophone records. Before him hung a
microphone, whilst on his table stood a small metal
cabinet, on which were a number of knobs to regulate
the sounds, and on his right was a gong, the sound-
ing of which conveyed to those in the room the
warning that business had started and that absolute
silence was necessary. This warning was emphasised
by the light over the door, which changed from
white to pink.
A number of ladies and gentlemen were seated
round the room; these were the amateurs who were
about to compete for the prizes offered by the Amal-
gamated Furnishing Company at the Haymarket, Syd-
ney, who gave prizes of two guineas for the first,
one guinea for the second, and half a guinea for the
third. There were also a number of guest artists,
with whose assistance a most enjoyable programme
was furnished.
Into the room came Miss Hilda Grace, an ac-
complished musician, being not only an extremely
clever pianist, but an excellent soprano vocalist. She
took her seat at the pianoforte ready to accompany
the various performers. Then in came the Chief
Announcer of the Station, Mr. Ken. Layton, and
behind him the producer, Mr. "Bob" Strother, and
that popular humourist, Mr. George Jennings, and
then the fun started.
The first amateurs consisted of a young tenor and
a soprano, who gave a splendid performance, and at
the close they were deservedly awarded the first prize.
Then a young soprano faced the microphone, which
hung in the centre of the room and, although very
nervous, sang well and was later awarded the second
prize. This young lady was the daughter of the
popular secretary of the Northern Suburbs Scottish
Association, Mr. J. Harrison. We have no space to
mention all, but we must mention the young guest
artist Miss Kathleen McMahon, who is a whistler,
and one of the best we have ever heard. This young
lady comes from the North Shore.
After this "Pageant," as it is called, there were a
few minutes interval, so far as the studio was con-
cerned, although other entertainment was being broad-
cast. Then came the "Scottish Reverie," and Mr.
John Davis entered the room and sat at a table in
the centre, facing a microphone which hung before
him. But first, Miss Jean Gillespie, a young lady
who has been home to Scotland and learned Gaelic,
Scottish dances, and how to sing Gaelic and Scottish
songs, entered the room and entertained all listeners
in Australia by the singing of Gaelic and Scottish
songs, all of which she sang admirably and her
pronunciation of the Gaelic was faultless. There is
no doubt that this was a great treat to many Gaelic
listeners-in, as well as others, for these Gaelic
melodies appeal to anyone who is musical.
Then we hear the sound of the pipes playing the
"79th Farewell to Gibraltar,' and Mr. John Davis
starts. As you have all heard him in his popular
entertainment, we need not say more. We did not
stay in the room, but sat in the cubby of the experts,
who have a room next the studio with a large win-
