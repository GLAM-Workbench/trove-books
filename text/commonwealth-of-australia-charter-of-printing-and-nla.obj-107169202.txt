Commonwealth of Australia
CHARTER
of printing and publishing
responsibilities
THIS CHARTER has been adopted by the Commonwealth Government in response to statements made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on
Publications in its Sixth Special Report that there was a need to clarify the responsibilities in printing and publishing functions as they relate to the
Parliament, the Australian Government Publishing Service, Departments and Statutory Authorities.

Government Publishing Service to reflect such developments and that it must be recognised there will be changes from time to time in government
policies. This Charter thus defines the responsibilities of the organisation concerned in broad terms.
