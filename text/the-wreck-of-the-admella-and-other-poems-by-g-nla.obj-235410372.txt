THE WRECK OF THE “ ADMELLA.”
On the night of the 6th August, 1859, the Australian
steamship “ Admella ” (trading between Port Adelaide and
Melbourne) struck on a dangerous reef about two miles from
the shore, near Cape Northumberland. The ill-fated vessel
broke amidships, the fore part going down almost immediately,
while the afterpart remained above water. Upwards of fifty
of the passengers and crew perished in the raging surf, and
from the effects of cold and hunger.
On the eighth day after the wreck, twenty-two survivors
who had been clinging to the portion of the ship that remained
above water, were bravely rescued by boats, and conveyed
through the surf in a most exhausted and pitiable condition.
The following incident of the wreck is narrated in the
Portland Guardian :—
“ Among, those congregated on the poop after the first
breaking-up of the vessel was a lad named Soren Holm, a smart,
clever youth, and an expert swimmer. The only remaining
boat, which had got loose, was seen drifting away. The lad
proposed to jump overboard and swim for it. The distance,
however, was too great, and the risks from sharks too imminent
to admit of it. He was so urgent, and so excellent a swimmer,
that his proposal was at length agreed to, and a rope fastened
around his body, in order that, should he fail to reach the


boat, he might be drawn in again. The lad went over, and
bravely he swam out. On he goes, and the rope is nearly paid
away. —‘ More line! more line! ’ Every available piece was
joined on successively. Still on he goes ; and now he nears
the boat. One more piece and he will reach it. Whilst in the
act of joining the last piece, the person who had hold of it
suddenly let it slip. A cry of horror arises! —the boy is lost!
—their hopes are gone! Long did they watch with feelings of
unutterable agony that noble form as it was carried away by
the strong current far, far out to sea, still buffeting with the
angry waves.”
Bi LL night along the deep
| The ship plough’d on her path of
And many a dreamer, fast asleep,
Was dreaming of his home !
They saw the sun, like blood,
Set yestereve in western skies ;
But there were those on that dark flood
Who ne’er should see it rise. «
Beneath the gloom of night
The ship held on her mad career ;
Her watchers for the beacon light
Reck’d not of danger near.


She bounded like a steed
Before the howling night wind’s breath,
With engines press’d to highest speed,
Into the jaws of death !
Then rose a shriek of woe,
Loud as Archangel’s trumpet-blast;
And all her dreamers from below
Came rushing thick and fast.
Babes from their rosy sleep
Awoke to join that wailing cry ;
Mothers gazed wildly on the deep
That roll’d in surges by.
O’er mast and bulwark riven—
O’er furnace quench’d—o’er deck uptorn,
The blinding surf was madly driven. .
Oh, Ood ! that it were morn !
* * * * *
Day saw the living dead
In mute despair cling on, —
The bruised reed is broken now,
Their last frail boat is gone !


They watch’d her drift away,
Nor mast nor oar had she,
A lone boat on the giant waves,
Still buffeting the sea !
Then out spake Soren Holm —
“ Find me a rope,” cried he,
“ And I will swim and gain yon boat
That’s drifting out to sea.”
Alas, for Soren Holm !
A noble youth was he ;
How proudly and how manfully
He battled with the sea !
Old England hath her heroes,
Her sons of bold renown ;
But none were braver than the lad
Who in that surf went down.
Glory to Soren Holm !
Forgotten though he be,
The angels watch’d him as he died,
Whilst struggling with the sea !


The name of Soren Holm
In golden letters write,
And grave it on a tablet-stone
Of marble fair and white.
Brave youth, of Denmark’s land,
In vain he hath not striven;
Though waves sweep o’er his noble head,
His spirit is in heaven !
* *
At midnight, past the wreck,
A proud ship 1 rolls unconscious by;
Ho ear upon her stately deck
Hath heard yon frantic cry !
They hail her lights in vain,
As stars of hope along the sea ;
Then watch her hull sink o’er the main,
In helpless agony !
Ho aid !—the Sabbath dawn
With splendour tips yon hills of sand ;
1 The P. and O. Company’s Royal Mail steamship
“ Bombay.”


And yet there cometh, with the mom,
No succour from the land !
To reach that desert shore
The rich man vainly offer’d gold ;
Full soon the surges to it bore
His corpse, in sea-wrack rolled !
Up from their living grave,
Like incense to the throne of God,
The voice of prayer rose o’er the wave.
To stay His chastening rod.
Despair sat on each brow,
And madness gleam’d in once bright eyes ;
The star of Hope is absent now
From yonder threatening skies.
The sea rose dark and wild —
The strong man yielded to its might;
And many a mother with her child
Slept in the waves that night!
The attesting stars on high
Alone bore witness to their woe.


Those last sad scenes of agony
The earth shall never know !
That love—than life more deep—
That parting—mournfully sublime—
Are secrets that the sea shall keep
Unto the end of time !
Two seamen, bold and brave,
Who oft had faced the deep before,
Launching a spar upon the wave,
In safety gain’d the shore;
And with their mournful news, in haste,
Sought nearest dwelling o’er the waste.
Toilworn, they reach’d that welcome light,
And told their harrowing tale —
How, still a remnant on the wreck
Were clinging to her shatter’d deck,
Like spectres, gaunt and pale;—
And o’er Australia’s land that night
Went up a funeral wail!
There is a hastening to and fro
Along the midnight streets ;


And busy footsteps come and go,
And the tones of the voice are low,
As each asks each he meets
More of the tale of woe.
To east and west the tidings fly,
Borne on the flashing wire ;
And distant cities hear the cry
From that far reef of agony ;
And burning words of fire
Wake to the rescue all the land
To save them ere they die;
And many a noble band,
With stout resolve and purpose high,
Go forth to save them—or to die !
“ Ho ! to the rescue now !”
Success to that brave band,
With willing heart and honest brow,
With sunburnt face, and roughen’d hand—
The sterling heroes of the land—
Who come, with glorious purpose high,
Resolved to do or die.


The mountain waves they breast,
With eager oar and straining eyes ;
Now, high upon the billows’ crest,
The gallant life-boat seems to rest—
Now through the surf she flies ;
Till, with one wild, exulting bound,
She gains her living prize.
“ They’re saved ! ” let one triumphant shout
O’er all Australia’s land ring out—
Their battle with the sea is done,
The final conquest nobly won !


LINES ADDRESSED TO STUART’S
EXPLORING PARTY,
ON STARTING UPON THEIR SECOND AND SUCCESSFUL
ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE AUSTRALIAN
CONTINENT.
0 forth again, brave band ! •
Renew your toils once more—
And rest not till yon tread the strand
Of Carpentaria’s shore !
The triumph nearly won,
Undaunted, start again;
For glory waits you where the sun
Gilds yon blue Indian main.
Stout hearts of British blood
Shall conquer in the end;
And may the asgis of our God
Your desert path defend !


STUART’S EXPLORING PARTY .
We pledge you in the name
Of Leichardt’s sacred grave,
That there awaits a crown of fame
For the successful brave !
By all our martyr’d sons
Who have gone forth in vain,
We’ll hail right well our valiant ones
When they return again !
Britannia bids you hail,
Ye earnest men and true !
She bids you bear o’er hill and dale
Her dauntless flag of blue !
Till on that northern shore
Her flag shall firmly stand ;
And Britons’ cheers shall echo o’er
Their newly-wedded land !
The future shall behold
A trackless waste no more;
The highways of our land of gold
Shall stretch from shore to shore.


A mighty nation lies
A cradled infant now ;
But soon a giant it shall rise,
With “ Empire ” on its brow !
Go forth, brave band, once more,
To earn a glorious name !
They who first gain yon distant shore
Achieve a deathless fame !
Adelaide, Oct. 24, 1861.


THE NEW ZEALAND MISSIONARY’S
WIFE AND HER DYING CHILD.
SESIDB the dark Waikato’s stream
That mother watch’d her dying
Brooding as one in fitful dream,
With mingled hopes and fancies wild.
And as the boy grew thin and weak,
He grew more beautiful and fair ;
The crimson flush upon his cheek
Told Death had set his signet there.
She murmur’d not—for she had seen
The wild waves closing o’er her dead ;
Famine and flame, where she had been—■
Hopes crush’d, and joys for ever fled.


i 4 NEW ZEALAND MISSIONARY'S WIFE
Her woman’s heart, by love made strong,
Had fearless sought that southern shore ;
And the dark race she dwelt among
Were strangers to the Word no more.
She murmur’d not, though one by one
Her every tie to earth were riven ;
For always, as the day was done,
The fading sunlight told of heaven.
Like Hagar and the desert child,
She bow’d before her Master’s will;
A stranger in the distant wild,
Beside that river dark and still.
And as she watch’d her dying boy,
His young life ebbing day by day,
A kind of melancholy joy
Would oft-times through her musings stray.
Though in the forest’s calm retreat
Upon his grave strange flowers might bloom,
She knew that they once more should meet
Beyond the quiet of the tomb.


AND HER DUNG CHILD.
’Twas a sweet place wherein to die—
Too fair a spot to call a grave —
Beneath the tree-fern’s shade to lie,
Beside Waikato’s tranquil wave !


THE LOST SEA BOY.
A BALLAD, FOUNDED ON FACT.
BT was in winter, when the snow
Was falling fast around ;
There was no sunshine in the sky,
And the wind made dismal sound.
It was in England, where the poor
Are very poor indeed ;
A cottage maiden, thinly clad,
Sought wood her fire to feed.
She wander’d by the leafless trees
In the raw, damp morning air ;
Trembling with cold she onward went,
Though her feet were chill and bare.


Onward she went, by copse and brake,
Down to the river’s brim ;
The frost had made the dead leaves white
That were matted by its rim.
Oh God ! it was a mournful sight
The village girl saw there !
A corpse lay midst the tangled sedge,
With long dishevelled hair.
It was a noble sailor boy,
With forehead fair and high—
A ruddy tint was on his cheek,
Dark lashes fringed his eye.
But he was dead —the stars of night,
And the cold moon’s icy ray,
Alone, in that lone spot, had seen
His young life pass away !
Child of the stormy ocean wave,
Why came he here to die,
Par inland midst the naked woods,
Beneath a wintry sky ?


Poor, and forsaken, and forlorn,
His young heart knew no joy,—
From a far seaport town he came,
A broken-hearted boy !
One hope his desolate steps had urged,
As onwards he would roam ;
One vain, despairing hope to reach
His mother and his home !
Cold looks and proud his soul had chill’d
(Oh ! some have hearts of steel) ;
But few he met upon the road
For that poor boy would feel.
Save one good man, who oft had been
Midst scenes of grief and woe —
He took compassion on the lad,
And kindly bade him go
To where the rectory’s friendly ray
Shone out amid the night;
And gentle forms were gather’d round
The fireside warm and bright.


Alas ! the ways of Heaven are dark !
That home he sought in vain !
The sailor boy no more might see
His own loved home again !
No more beside his mother’s knee
His evening meal to share,
.No more to listen to her voice
In the low soft tones of prayer.
No more !—the forest’s night alone
Hath heard his sob of woe,
Where his young heart pour’d out its grief
Hnpitied, midst the snow !
Death came, and set his icy seal
Upon that wanderer’s brow ;
The sea-boy’s toils are at an end—
His griefs are over now !
He sleeps amongst the village dead,
Where thyme and daisies bloom;
And village children oft shall come
To mark the sea-boy’s tomb !


THE WATCHERS OH THE BALTIC, IN
MAT, 1854.
HE restless Czar, in his balcony chill,
fA Is to and fro;
And his sentinels look from their
towers in vain
Across the twilight snow.
From their watch-towers, over Ladoga’s lake,
Up the Neva, and towards the sea,
They listen in vain for the coming voice
Of the wind, in its mystery !
The sleepless Czar, he hath listen’d long
Through those solemn nights of May—
The most solemn of all the fifty-seven
That he has pass’d away.


For the ice breaks up at the west wind’s breath,
With many a startling crack ;
And a fearful thing is a strong west wind,
Driving the waters back !
For the sound of those waters the listeners watch,
With hearts that are standing still—
For the roaring swash of the driven sea
Is their herald of mightier ill.
It beareth along on its troubled breast
The fleets of a terrible foe !
For the power of old England’s wooden walls
The Czar hath yet to know.
And the tricolored flag of fearless France
Is waving, rife for war.
’Tis a wholesome lesson of “ might and right ”
They come to teach the Czar !
Oh ! how is it now with that ruthless man,
In the vigil of his doom P
What cheereth his soul, as he listeneth long
For the cannon’s distant boom ?


Do the hanged descend from their gallows now,
To shake their chains at him ?
Do the knouted rise from their gory beds
To speak their minds to him ?
Do the ghosts of the exiled ones come back
From the shores of the Polar Sea P
And the buried-alive from the desolate mine.
To mock at his misery ?
Are the frantic women of Warsaw there,
Seeking their sons in vain P
Alas ! for the innocent blood he hath pour’d
Upon his land, like rain.
’Tis a terrible watch that the Muscovite keeps.
Midst the ghosts of his evil deeds,
As he vainly cries in his perilous hour
For' the mercy he so much needs I
Alas for the Czar; in his balcony chill,
As he paces to and fro ;
For soon he shall drain, to its lowest dregs.
His bitter cup of woe.


A DREAM OF THE OCEAN’S DEAD.
SOUR years had pass’d away—and the
music of the wave
Had sounded on by night and day
above that lost one’s grave;—
A lonely place of waters, to all, save one, unknown,
Along the trackless waste, where the troubled
surges moan.
Deep, deep beneath the sea, ha its silence and its
gloom,
Amongst the coral caverns is Willy’s ocean tomb.
Four years with us had pass’d, in sunshine and
in storm,
Since the darkening waves had closed above that
fair young form.
Another ship bore on, her sails in pride were
spread;
And strangers knew not that they pass’d above
the uncoffin’d dead.


The stately ship went by, ploughing the midnight
sea;
Land was a thousand miles away from those wild
billows free.
And the pale and pensive moon, the sounding of
the sea,
And the shining of the Pleiades had brought sad
thoughts to me.
That wan and waning moon—the dark clouds
drifting by—
The dreary sighing of the waves—that boy’s last
agony—
They all return’d once more, with a freshness and
a power
That dash’d aside the mist of time from that one
solemn hour.
But amidst the dreamy slumbers that visit us at
night,
The memory of the past gave place to a vision
fair and bright.
Methought the dawning of the day
Had kindled in the sky;
And dimly through the morning grey
An island rose on high.


Methought, by some strange power convey’d,
On its high peak I stood;
Brooded around a misty shade
O’er its calm solitude.
I knew not how it was he came,
But the drowned boy stood there ;
His proud, bright eyes —his smile, the same,
His wealth of clustering hair.
Oh ! it was something strangely glad
To see that child again:
A mingling of the gay and sad,
A pleasure dimm’d by pain.
He clasp’d his hand in mine, and said
Sweet words in accents fair;
I knew the while the boy was dead,
Yet wander’d with him there !
He led me to the mountain’s height—
The mist had roll’d away,
As melts the fleeting hoar-frost white
Before the morning’s ray.
We saw the red sun in his might
Heave o’er the Eastern main—
There was a grandeur in that sight
One might not see again.


Silent upon that peak we stood,
Bathed in the ruddy glow—
Beyond stretch’d ocean’s boundless flood,
And ships lay far below !
Beautiful in the light of morn
Stood there that noble boy—
His smile was radiant as the dawn,
His eyes were fill’d with joy;
It seem’d not that the salt sea wave
Had ever dash’d his brow—
Triumphant o’er his stormy grave
Look’d down that lost one now.
Came, with his well-remember’d voice,
Tones that had long been hush’d ;
A welcome, breathing changeless joys,
From his deep spirit gush’d.
“ And art thou come, my early friend,
In this spirit land to stay ?
Depart not hence to earth again,
Oh ! go no more away.”
* * * *
Hath it no meaning, when in dreams,
By ocean billows toss’d,


We thus hold converse with the dead,
The loved ones and the lost ?
Hath it no meaning, ask the sea,
The lone, mysterious deep ?
Can its cold bosom quench the ties
Its prison waters keep ?
It hath a meaning deep and strong —
The presence of the dead
( Watches o’er those they loved on earth
Though they from us are fled.
And, it may be, departed eyes
Look on us as we sleep;
And gentle spirits round our way
Their unseen vigils keep.
Thus let it be—the holy dead
In dreams to us shall tell
That love hath power when life is fled, —
Oh, who would break the spell ?


TO THE RIVER MURRAY.
a WAKE, thou mighty river !—Austra-
lia’s noblest stream ;
The voices of the Saxon race arouse
thee from thy dream !
In silence, since creation, through wild, low deserts
ever,
Thy snow-fed waters have roll’d on —an unsung,
nameless river !
But a change is o’er thee now —their rushing
feet we hear;
The restless footsteps of a host to thy green
banks draw near !
They come from England’s homesteads, from Erin’s
isle they come,
And Scotia’s heath-clad hills they leave to seek a
southern home.
Full soon a mighty nation shall look on thee with
pride,


Triumphant o’er thy glassy waves shall many a
steam-boat ride.
Brave Sturt, in his lone boat, first broke thy silent
dream,
Cadell awoke thee to the world by earth’s proud
conqueror—steam !
Where but the wild dogs’ howling, by desolate
lagoon,
And the plover’s voice were heard, greeting the
mournful moon,
Shall other sounds and voices startle thy dull
green woods,
The clanging axe—the merry laugh—ring through
thy solitudes ;
And Anglo-Saxon children, with joyous eyes
of blue,
Shall play upon thy banks, and launch their tiny
bark canoe.
Wake to the march of nations, thou noble, new-
born river !
And through the Saxon’s land of gold, flow on in
pride for ever !


THE WRECK OP THE “ DUNBAR.”
This fine ship, bound from London to Sydney (her passen-
gers and crew numbering about 120 souls), was dashed to
pieces against the cliffs outside Sydney Heads in a terrible
storm on the night of 20th August, 1857. The only survivor
was a seaman named Johnson, who was carried by the waves
into a cave on the face of the perpendicular cliff, and afterwards
rescued, being drawn to the top by a rope, a distance of more
than two hundred feet.
SHE rode the midnight sea
With the land upon her lee !
Fond hearts hoped soon to he
At home again!
A priceless freight she bore
Towards Australia’s shore—
Their journey nearly o’er,
Across the main !


No moon lights up the deep,
No stars their vigils keep,
And the weary ones, asleep,
Dream their last dream !
The doom’d ship ploughs the wave,
She bears them to their grave,
Where the mad surges rave
And sea-fires gleam !
Visions of friendly greeting,
Dreams of the morrow’s meeting,
Alike old age are cheating,
And youth’s bright crown !
Toy of the mocking wave,
Helpless her crew to save ;
Her beautiful and brave,
They all went down !
Then, mingled with the roar
Of the wild surf on the shore,
From a hundred souls and more,
One shriek of woe !


THE WRECK OF THE “DUNBAR.”
That cry went up to Heaven,
As in darkness they were driven,
And the strong ship was riven
At one fell blow !
Death rides in triumph there,
Through that midnight of despair !
The last faint gurgling prayer
Is heard no more !
And then the giant sea,
By God’s right hand let free,
Mocks man’s proud mastery —
And all is o’er !
The surf shall be the shroud
Of the beautiful and proud,
And the stalwart men who bow’d
To its might!
Corpses lie calm and cold,
In the green seaweed roll’d !
And sharks their banquet hold
Day and night!


Age, with, its whitening crown,
Youth, with its locks of brown,
And manhood’s pride, went down
All helplessly !
Bright, joyous boys were there ;
Maidens, surpassing fair;
And babes, with golden hair,
Nursed !
One mother, on her breast
To its eternal rest
Her darling babe had press’d
In her despair!
Sisters lay side by side,
As if in dreams they’d died—
It seem’d as though the tide
Knew they were fair !
* * * *
Seven hearses, tramping slow,
March to the music low,
Amidst a people’s woe,
With solemn tread!


34 THE WRECK OF THE “DUNBAR.”
One lone chief monrner there,
With the salt spray on his hair.
Follows, in mute despair,
The many dead !
And, by the moon’s pale light,
They bnry them at night—
Saved from the tempest’s might—
All in one grave !
Calm, calm shall be their sleep,
While many mourners weep
The lost ones of the deep—
The fair, the brave !
God help the hearts that mourn,
The stricken and forlorn,
Whose loves are rudely torn
the salt wave !


THE PARTING.
BRIEND of my soul, farewell, farewell!
The ocean bears you on its breast—
Par o’er the blue Pacific wave
You seek in vain a place of rest!
Though angry seas between us roll,
They shall not change a love like ours ;
The heart is free beyond control,
And none shall bind its hidden powers.
Par, far away a land you seek
Whose freedom’s but a boasted breath ;
The flag of mingled stripes and stars
Flaunts high o’er slavery and death.
And yet you go ! —all human power —
The warnings of a faithful heart—
The earnest prayer at parting hour,
Are all in vain—and thus we part!


We part!—but, oh ! return again,
Throw not your young life thus away;
Cast not the brightness of your youth
On heartless hopes that soon decay.
Friend of my soul, return once more !
The star of hope shall be thy guide —
And when thy pilgrimage is o’er
Come rest thee at thy brother’s side.
Return —to share the world with him !
Return —to freedom, wealth, and power !
Let not your better mind grow dim ;
Sell not your hopes in some dark hour.
Bear up, my friend, be firm, be strong—
Let one true purpose fill your heart;
And then I know ’twill not be long
Until we meet —no more to part.


THE STORMY PETREL.
of untiring wing,
Whence art thou wandering P
Has the broad blue sea
A home for thee
On its bosom of murmuring waters ?
When the red sun is born,
And at set of day,
From the night to the morn
Thou art round our way,
Like a spirit upon the waters !
Five thousand miles and more
From our native northern shore,
O’er the broad blue sea
Wanderers are we
On the breast of the faithless ocean !


THE STORMY PETREL.
But we seek, far away,
Green hills again,
-Whilst night and day
Thou art skimming the main
With thy swift and silent motion.
Where is thy place of rest ?
Where is thy moss-weav’d nest ?
The broad blue sea
Will cheerless be
When its tempest winds are sweeping.
There must be a spell
In the wild sea-foam,
That ye love it so well
As to make it your home,
Y e nursling of ocean’s keeping !
Bird of untiring wing,
Pursue thy journeying;
The broad blue sea
Thy home must be
From the dawn to the set of day !


For the Spirit of Power
Hath been thy guide
Prom thy earliest hour,
O’er the waters wide,
To illumine thy trackless way !


LINES WRITTEN AT SEA IN THE
TROPICS.
EEP is the blue of Senegambia’s sky !
Blue are the ocean waves that round
us chime !
The hot sun wheels his flaming course on high,
In robes of brightest majesty sublime !
Not like the summer eve in our own land
Smiles it at sunset—strangely wild and grand
The whole broad heavens are kindled with red
light,
That glows more glorious as draws near the night.
Not eager Cortes, thirsting for the gold
Of unseen cities in a world untold,
E’er in his vision’d dreams such store survey’d
Of molten gold, with jewels interlaid,
As I have watch’d around the setting sun
When o’er the purple wave, his bright course run,
Dazzling, he sinks, to rise along that zone
Of life, and light, and heat, that’s all his own !


Castles, and rocks of ebon cloud, appear
Hurl’d up against tbe burning amber throne
Of the far West —as if in yon bright skies
Huge Titan giants, weary of their war,
Had piled their missiles up ; —and this is what we
Oft have I gazed, with wish intense and vain,
Those many-colour’d sunset isles to gain;
And fancy oft has led her sportive train
Of winged thoughts, and phantoms, and bright
dreams,
Up to those regions of ethereal beams —
For visions fairer than the earth e’er knew,
And thoughts more beautiful, and gentler too
Than thoughts of earth, are born in those far skies —
Atoms of splendour, stray’d from Paradise !
The grey night comes, and there are stars oh high
That burn and glisten in the southern sky ;
And stars below, in countless myriads driven
By every surge, as though the cope of heaven
Had shower’d them from her Milky-way to light
Our vessel’s pathway through the silent night.


As bursts a maniac from his heavy sleep
In sudden fury, but to rave and weep,
So o’er the slumbering calm of tranquil rest,
That death-like broods on ocean’s waveless breast,
The pinions of the blast sweep darkly by,
And spirits seem at war in the wild sky.
A palace of black waterspouts is there,
And strange commotions mingle sea and air.
The blue shark hangs within the bluer wave —
Uprisen monster from his deep sea cave;
And belted fish, 1 that triumph in the storm,
Sport, like attendants, round his grisly form.
Go ! tell the miser, by his lonely hearth,
Whose coffers are his gods, whose hoarded gold
Is bliss supreme to count, now he is old —
Tell him, whose gentler passions at their birth,
And love itself, for sordid gain were sold,
Tell him of scenes like these; —the careless boy
Who mounts the storm-swung topmast hath more
And more of Nature’s freedom, than has he.
1 The pilot-fish.


I love to gaze on the eternal sea —
To share the beautiful, the calm, the grand ;
To feel that it is free and I am free —
To watch the wonders of that Red Right-hand
In storm and tempest —and to feel and know
That the Almighty Power, whose breath is Life,
Whose nod Creation, governs all below —
That He who stills the elemental strife,
And holds the waters in His hollow hand,
Tinted each radiant cloud, lit up each spark
That burns and glistens in the ocean dark —
That He who guides the wandering sea-fowl’s flight
Dwells in the beams of uncreated light!
Such thoughts as these can surely never cloy !
Yet there are those who dream not of the joy,
The strange fantastic joy, that hath its birth
In seas and skies, and lifts the soul from earth.


POMARA’S FAREWELL TO ENGLAND.
SGO, I go,—back to my land once more !
The proud shijD swells her canvas from
the shore,
And I am free !
Like a young, joyous bird, with untamed wing,
I go, the gladness of my soul to fling
On the wide sea !
I go, where I have wander’d when a child —
Where my first footsteps trod the flowery wild,
Or chased the bee,
That sings in hollow bells of violet light,
Laden with nectar, on its murmuring flight
Prom tree to tree.
Often at sunset’s golden hour I came,
Mocking the echo of my shouting name,
rocks and floods ;


Deck’d with, the warratah’s gay blossoming,
Birds’ nests and flowers home to my rest I’d bring
Back from the woods.
No father’s care was mine—no sister’s smile—
No playmate brother’s laughter to beguile
The sunny hours—
No mother’s kisses on my cheek to rest!
’Twas thus I loved the woods in beauty dress’d —
The birds —the flowers I
To these, to these, I would return once more; —
Dreams murmur to me of that southern shore,
And I must go
Back to my hills andstreams and wood-paths free —
The pale rock-lily —and the whispering bee,
Midst blossoms low !
Farewell, my English friends—the loved, the true !
Thy memory shall go with me, even as dew
Nursing sweet flowers.
In my fond heart the treasure-caves of thought
Are deep and full, with gentle memories fraught
For distant hours !


46 POMARA’S FAREWELL TO ENGLAND.
I go, with words of blessing o’er my head ;
And household prayers, by soft, sweet voices shed,
Are breathed for me.
Alas ! that thus the sunshine of the heart
On earth o’erclonded by the words, “we part,”
Must ever be!

SMITH IN CAPE TOWN, AFTER MAKING PEACE
WITH THE FRONTIER KAFFIRS.

«Crown Tiim with leaves of bay ;
Back from his path of victory
The conqueror comes to-day.
He hath triumph’d years ago
On those battle-fields of Spain,
Where noble British blood was pour’d
Upon the land like rain.
Where trampled vine and olive
Drank in the purple flood,
And grass sprang up of darker hue,
Drench’d by a nation’s blood.


LINES.
He has seen the sun go down
Across Badajoz’ plain,
When, through the smoke, like blood it cast
A red light o’er the slain.
He hath stood amidst the battle,
In the hottest of the fight,
Where Afghan warriors fiercely strove
For old Sobraon’s height.
The haughty Sikhs have bow’d
To the victor of their soil;
And India- at her conqueror’s feet
Hath laid a princely spoil.
But a nobler conquest now
By that “ master mind ” is wrought,
Than when, for glory, on the plains
Of Aliwal he fought.
To many a hearth forsaken —
To many a pillaged home—
Along Kaffraria’s blood-stain’d hills
The joys of peace have come.


Fearless, through Kaffir bands,
On mortal conflict bent,
Our hero spilt no savage blood,
Yet “ conquer’d as he went.”
Throughout the Boer’s lone camps
Discord and strife shall end ;
From the farthest peak of Drakensberg
They hail “ the farmer’s friend.”
Katal’s fair paradise,
That once was stain’d with gore,
Shall smile again in loveliness
Kow those dark days are o’er.
And the kilted Zulu hosts,
And the Griqua’s mounted band—
They have bow’d them to the flag of peace
That waves o’er Afric’s land.
Then crown with wreaths of fame
The warrior’s sun-burnt brow ;
Back from a “ moral victory ”
He comes as conqueror now.


TO THE
MEMORY OF FREDERICK STRANGE,
THE NATURALIST,
WHO WAS MURDERED BY THE SAVAGES OP
PERCY ISLAND.
&USTRALIA ! for thine onward march
How many a son of science fell —
Shall not thy bards of future years
Their deeds of noble daring tell ?
Immortal they ! though wealth and pride
Shall leave behind them scarce a name,
The men who have for science died
Shall wear a changeless wreath of fame !
They who went forth with generous heart,
Fresh gems to cull from Nature’s breast,
Fell willing martyrs at her shrine,
And on her lap their bones shall rest.


IN MEMORY OF FREDERICK STRANGE.
Great names and noble ! —they shall thrill
Like magic on onr children’s ears—
The heroes of their song shall be
Australia’s dauntless pioneers.
And they shall tell how perish’d there
Heroic Leichardt with his band—
And that boy-trayeller, Smith, who died
Of thirst upon the burning sand.
And Allan Cunningham, whose name
Is graven ’neath our willow shade— *
Of Kennedy’s brave comrades tell,
How in the waste their bones were laid !
And they shall yet a tale narrate
Of one who ventured forth in glee—
A joyous rover in his bark —
For islands o’er the glittering sea.
Fair science pointed to a realm
Where Nature spread a field unknown ;
He sought to reap her choicest fruits,
And make her treasures all his own.
* In the Botanic Gardens, Sydney.


52 IN MEMORY OF FREDERICK STRANGE.
By savage hands his steps were stay’d ;
Before the murderous spear he fell;
Another victim to her cause,
Australia’s martyr ranks to swell.
Alas, poor Strange ! ’tis well to know
Australia hath a heart to feel;
To wipe away thy orphans’ tears —
Thy widow’s broken heart to heal !


TO WILLIAM IN HEAVEN.
art gone ! thou art gone ! my boy!
No toil, and tempest, and watching
now!
Thou art pass’d away to a happier home,
No shade of sorrow to darken thy brow ;
No tyrant’s curse on the heaving wave,
No scorn, no tears, no sadness now !
Thou wilt return to us no more,
’Tis a blessed lot for thee;
For thy path was dark, thy heart too warm
To be cast on the faithless sea.
Oh ! tell me if thy spirit lives
On that sunny and golden shore
Where all our woes are remember’d not,
And there shall be sea no more ?


And let me cherish one bright thought,
One that I love to bear ;
When I’m alone on that sea of graves,
With the dirge-like chiming of its waves,
And feel the sadness of earthly care,
And the blight of yonng hopes pass’d away,
That thy gentle spirit is with me there,
To calm the passion of my dismay !
’Tis a weary world ! all things most fair,
The fragile idols of onr heart,
The sunny joys that youth would share,
Like meteors in the summer air
Torture our love, and then depart!
Thou art gone, thou art gone, my boy !
Safe from the blast of the tyrant’s power,
Secure from sin and from suffering now;
Though dark was the lot of thy earthly dower.
The sunshine of Heaven now gilds thy brow.
Rest, rest, in the realms of endless day !
Oh ! who could wish that we had thee here,
To tread again life’s cheerless way,
To watch and toil, and weep and fear !


THE TWO SHIPS.
go, to battle with the ocean’s
To ride in triumph o’er his stormy
breast;
Ho more for theirs the light of hearth and home,
And gentle household rest.
Proud ships upon the waters! hearts are thine
That love to hear the dashing billows roar ;
Take them, in gladness, o’er the stormy brine,
With blessings from the shore.
Bear on thy pathless ways ; —to each of thee
A distant course along the deep is given ;
Ye shall not meet upon the lone mid sea
Beneath the stars of heaven.


One for the radiant east her prow shall guide,
As swells her snow-white canvas to the breeze—
Where many a palm-clad island gems the tide
Of the bine Indian seas.
And one shall follow on her path of foam —
A lonely track for that proud bark to keep ;
Where but the giant albatross hath home —
Along the southern deep.
God speed them o’er the waters ; —night and day ,
By moonlight calms, or tempest’s angry blast,
They shall hold on their solitary way,
Yet reach their homes at last.
Oft shall they sleep beneath the spangled sky—
Darkly their sails against the moon shall rock—
Their tall masts tremble as the gale sweeps by,
Before the storm-wind’s shock.
Mysterious are the ocean paths they trace ;
Though suns may glitter on the murmuring
wave,
They oft shall pass, yet reck not, o’er the place
Of many a lone sea grave.


Dark things are hid beneath the dashing tide;
The many-peopled chambers of the deep
Have won from earth her spoils of wealth and
pride,
For the salt sea to keep.
God speed them o’er the waters; —hopes and
prayers
By soft sweet voices breathed at many a
shrine,
With gentle blessings from the shore are theirs.
God speed them o’er the brine !


THE LAST FAREWELL.
HE yellow moon shone ronnd and full
upon the dark heath side,
And a soft and silvery light it threw
across it far and wide;
The grey old stones look'd gloomily in the half-
shaded glen,
Like ghosts of bygone warriors return’d to earth
again.
All nature was so calm and still that nothing
breathed a sound,
Save the murmuring of the gentle brook that ran
along the ground.
The far-off beacon fire was red, and upward to
the sky
It blazed upon the mountain top, and rear’d its
flame-crest high.


Along the heath two lovers stray’d—the moon-
light o’er them fell,
Where they had met that dreamy night to take a
last farewell.
And there they vow’d their plighted troth that
each would constant be,
As clings the faithful ivy round the sheltering
forest tree.
They sat upon a mouldering stone, and talked of
by-gone days,
And of what might yet befall to them along
life’s chequer’d ways.
But the murmur of the passing brook, as it
gurgled down the dell,
Came mournfully upon their ears, and seem’d to
say “ Farewell.”
They parted. Though the silvery moon still
shines as bright as ever,
And the little stream flows on amongst the tufts
of purple heather,
They nevermore shall meet again their tale of
love to tell,
For they met upon that cherish’d night to take
their last farewell.


THE LAST FAREWELL.
Yet oft by moonlight on the heath unheeded and
alone,
A gliding form is seen to bend beside that
mouldering stone;
A gentle maiden sits and weeps ; and in her
bosom fair
She holds a faded rosebud and a lock of dark
brown hair.


EARLY POEMS.




EARLY POEMS
THE SHUN AMITE’S SON.
(2 Kings, Ath chapter!)
rosy morning blush’d o’er Carmel’s
And the bright flowers rais’d up their
dewy heads
To revel in the sunshine. The far sea
Shone clear and calm, mirror’d in deepest blue,
Where Tyre’s proud vessels glitter’d to the dawn,
And caught its brightness on their gilded prows ;
Or Sidon’s envious walls their shadows threw,
Broadly and deep, across the slumbering brine.
That morn was lovely ; and the reapers rose
Betimes to labour in the open field,


And gather in the harvest. And their lord
Stood near to watch them—listening, perchance,
To the sweet music of the bulbul’s song,
Or gazing on his boy, who stray’d to pluck
The purple lilies, and anon to chase
The fluttering insects, or to roam among
The almond thickets, where the wild gazelles
Raised up their mild brown eyes and look d at
him —
But fear’d not, for his eyes were like their own.
Yet, as he stray’d, the beams of the warm sun
Wax’d hotter, and they fell upon the child,
And scorch’d his golden locks ; and his bright eyes
Grew dim and faint; his little hand was placed
Upon his brow ; and, hastening to his sire,
He cried, “ My head, my head !” and laid him down
Upon his mother’s knees till noon; and then,
His dark eyes heavenward raised, he smiled and
died!
Who hastens now from Carmel, with his head
White as the snows that crown Mount Lebanon,


And his long robe girt round him ? ’Tis the
Seer—
The man of God —the prophet, who hath come
Journeying to save. Ere yet the yellow stars
Are bright above, and the mild radiant moon
Bathes in her silvery light Samaria’s hills,
He gazes on the boy—not as he was
When the glad sun rose up among the flowers,
And his young voice was singing to the morn,
But, like the alabaster image, wrought
By skilful chisel, breathing, as it were,
Yet cold and motionless, tho’ still as mild and fair.
He gazes on the boy, and lays him down
Upon his delicate limbs ; and they wax warm
As prays the prophet to his Israel’s God ;
And the long lashes of his beaming eyes
Open as gently as the expanding flower
Bursts into bloom.
He looks above and smiles
To see the crescent moon hang in the sky ;
And raises from his couch his drooping head
To catch the cool night breeze; then turns aside


To dream of the gazelles and flowery streams,
And slumbers on, unconscious he had died!
Oh! there was joy that night in Shunam’s halls;
And when the morrow’s sun led forth the day
Out from the balmy chambers of the east,
Up from his bed of death the rosy boy
Started again, to hear the bulbul sing,
And with the wild gazelles again to play —
Almost as wandering and as wild as they !


THERE IS A SPOT.
S' HERE is a spot, though it’s far away,
When I was a boy, where I loved i
And often, in dreamy visions still,
I hear the gush of a gurgling rill
That burst from out the mountain side
And spread into a lakelet wide—
For we loved to seek its moss-girt pool
On summer days, let loose from school !
There is a spot, far, far away,
When I was a boy, where I loved to play !
Can I forget the strange wild waves
That danced upon the sailors’ graves,
When, sweeping o’er the winter sea,
The dark east wind howl’d fearfully ;
And the cold moon scarcely dared to shine
Upon that surge of boiling brine !


There is a spot, though it’s far away,
When I was a boy, where I loved to play,
In the snnny hours of gladsome spring,
With mayflower and cowslip blossoming ;
Where the song of the woodland bird rang out.
And we heard the merry cuckoo’s shout,
Where the primrose nestled in amber pride,
And the violet scented the hedgerow side.
There is a spot, and it’s far away,
When I was a boy, where I loved to play !
For green are the hills where I used to roam,
And bright are the vales of that early home,
And fresh and free is the curling wave,
As it gently breaks o’er the sailor’s grave !
Oh ! I cherish the spot, though it’s far away,
When I was a boy, where I loved to play!


LETTER TO A SCHOOL-FELLOW.
WRITTEN IN PROSPECT OF A VOYAGE TO SICILY,
EAR Joe, I’ve only time to say
Your welcome letter came to-day ;
And, as you ask me for a line,
I feel I hardly can decline;
So, to be brief, and nothing worse,
I send you one in doggrel verse.
Well! lam going very soon,
Before the next round yellow moon
Shall shower her light on lovers’ eyes, '
And fill them with a glad surprise ;
And when they hail her rising fire,
And tune the wild notes of the lyre,
To welcome forth the evening star,
I shall, perhaps, be wandering far
Beneath the same mild beams, whose smile
Shall play upon that sea-girt isle ;


LETTER TO A SCHOOLFELLOW.
And as I wander, many a night,
Watching the sparkling fire-flies light
Amongst the groves of orange trees —
And all such pleasant things as these —
Then shall I think of days gone by,
Of long past hours, when you and I
Roam’d through the glades of Devon, where,
With hearts as light as summer air,
And souls all generous and unknowing
Of this world’s wicked way of doing,
We oft would talk of days to come,
And picture out our future home.
And will you sometimes think of me
When I’m upon the distant sea —
On ocean, many a long dark night,
With only waves and stars in sight?
Or when, beneath Sicilian bowers,
I gaze in rapture on the flowers
Which deck that southern land, like charms
Flung from Pomona’s rosy arms ;
Or when I’m wandering, half divine,
Through fields where goddess Proserpine


LETTER TO A SCHOOLFELLOW. 71
Once gather’d Enna’s fairest flowers
To deck her Pandemonium bowers P
Now, Joe, I prithee, don’t forget
To think of me ; and sometimes let
A thought call back the dreamy ways
We trod alike in boyhood’s days.
So fare thee well—until again
I launch across the whitening main,
And Albion’s snowy cliffs once more
Welcome me to my native shore !


THE SEA NYMPH’S SONG-.
B|o sound is on the glassy ocean—
! The sleeping waves forget their motion,
* Calm and still is the silent sea,
Calm and still as it can be.
Sister Nymphs, the stars are high,
Awaiting our sweet melody;
Let us wake our evening song,
For I have rein’d my dolphin in,
The purple sea-weed eaves among,
Where many a strange and shadowy thing
Beside our cold sea home is flung.
Let us sing as we have sang
Many a summer’s night in June,
When our wild, sweet echoes rang
Welcome music to the moon ;
Bind the sparkling weeds around us,
And part our long, damp hair,


For the chains of ocean have long enough bound us,
In his oozy lair.
Let us sing as we have sung,
Liquid murmurs, half unstrung,
Strains that melted half away
At the sound of their own sweet melody !
Song.
We have risen far up from our damp green homes,
And are floating to-night o’er the quiet sea,
Where spirit with kindred spirit roams,
In the vastness of its sublimity.
We are come, we are come, on the ocean’s breast,
And the sea-fires are bound in our dripping hair ;
The shells they are bright in our cinctured vest,
And our bosoms their pearly treasures bear.
Our song is a song of the deep blue sea,
Where the starlight is mirror’d in every eye,
And the wave is as still as we wish it be,
Till we bid the stars and the waves good-bye.


Then, down we sink, till onr music slow
Comes faintly and distant as echoing dreams :
For we dwell in the tranquil depths below,
And our couch is the yellow sand, that gleams
From the floors of the ocean, that shrouded lie
In the gloom of their hidden serenity !


THE ARCTIC BUTTERFLY.
SUGGESTED BY SEEING ONE BROUGHT HOME BY
CAPTAIN ROSS FROM BOOTHIA FELIX.
BND are there homes for thee,
Amid yon regions of eternal snow,
And shelter’d valleys green and free,
Where fragrant cyclamen and gentian blow !
Blossoms beside the streams,
From whence to draw thy sweet ambrosial food ?
Where, basking in the sun’s slant beams,
The eider nestles with its downy brood ?
Surely that icy clime
From whence thou cam’st is not thy rightful
home!
Or does its transient summer time
Suffice thy flight through polar lands to roam ?


THE ARCTIC BUTTERFLY.
Hast thou not stray’d away
From sunnier homes, amidst geranium bowers ;
And left thy congeners at play
Amidst the freshness of the hay-field flowers ?
Ho !—thy pale, dusky wings
Boast not the brightness of those southern flies,
Whose dazzling splendour round them flings
Bewitching radiance of a thousand dyes.
Poor solitary one!
Ho doubt thy arctic home to thee was sweet;
And the slant shining of the sun
Brought warmth and gladness to thy lone retreat!
The Spirit of All Power
Hath fashion’d thee, and bid thy form go forth
To flit above the polar flower,
And cheer the icy regions of the north !


LINES TO JANE.
SORGTYE me, Jane, for telling thee
That I have loved another !
One summer morn I saw her stand
Beside her fair-hair’d brother.
He was a gentle boy—
But she was gentler far ;
And a mystic charm was ever spread
Around her like a star.
We loved each other then,
That cottage girl and I;
And often, when the full moon shone
With pearly light on high,
We roam’d beside old Tavy’s stream,
And through the shady wood,
Watching its mild and pensive beam
All mirror’d in the flood.
A wreath of simple flowers she twined


Around her clear white brow !
The winning magic of her smile,
It haunts my memory now !
But she was a poor orphan when
Her brother stood beside her ;
And then she had no land nor gold,
And so they hated her !
For many a long, long day
We have never seen each other ;
For now she lies in the churchyard
Beside her fair-hair’d brother.
Oh ! Jane, I’m sure you’ll pardon me
For having loved another !


THE INVITATION.
SAIR child! art thou willing to come
And leave thy glad sport by the old
oak tree ?
We will seek out a land that is pleasant and fair,
Where humming-birds dance through the per-
fumed air;
We will visit the home of each beautiful thing,
We will gather the flowers of endless spring,
And we’ll chase the green and golden bee !
Fair child ! —art thou willing to go with me ?
0 why should I leave my own forest home,
In those strange and far-off lands to roam P
1 love our white cottage beside the old tree,
And linnet and blackbird are songsters for me.
I gather the cowslips and primroses fair,
And bright yellow king-cups are blowing there ;


And violets are sweet where the cool waters flow !
No - *, stranger ! I cannot, I must not go !
Oh! say not thus, my fair child, but come !
We will hark to the beat of the warlike drum,
We’ll gaze with delight on the martial array,
We will visit the city so fair and gay ;
We will join the merry and jocund throng
Who tread in the mazy dance along ;
And all that is new we will hear and see !
Fair child! —art thou willing to go with me ?
We have music sweet in our cottage here,
And the village chimes sound soft and clear;
The babbling brook, and the evening knell,
That tinkles slow from the cattle’s bell,
The bleat of lambs in the grassy vale,
And the thrilling voice of the nightingale, .
Are dearer to me than the sounding drum !
No, stranger ! I cannot, I will not come !
But, boy ! I can tell thee of lands that lie
’Neath the dazzling beams of an Indian sky ;


Where palm-trees spread their deep green shade,
And peacocks roam through the forest glade;
And at night, midst the blossoms, to and fro,
The dancing fire-flies burn and glow;
And the broad yellow moon shines full o’er the sea —
Fair child ! art thou willing to go with me ?
I have heard them tell of that Indian clime,
Where they say it is always summer time ;
But my acorn-trees are prettier far
Than the palms that shadow those forests are ;
And at night—why I know a mossy glen
Where the glowworm sparkles bright—and then
The pale moon rises, so mild and slow, —
Oh, stranger ! I cannot, I will not go !
Shall we roam far away to the western land,
And gather bright shells on its sunny strand ?
There are forests of flowers that blush unseen,
And rolling prairies of living green ;
The fragrant magnolia blossoms there,
And butterflies sweep through the warm, still air,
And woodpeckers tap the red maple tree, —
Fair child, art thou willing to go with me ?


Oh no ! I’m too fond of my cottage home,
I care not through foreign lands to roam ;
My mother is singing the baby to rest,
And the robin has hied it away to its nest;
My merry companions are seeking for me,
To join in their sports by the old oak tree;
The moon it has risen, so mild and slow, —
No, stranger ! I cannot, I will not go !

SWAY, away! —let vision’d scenes
Of other lands elate thee,
Nor vainly cling to those behind,
While brighter ones await thee.
Though many a thousand weary miles
Of ocean are before thee,

Her cheerly influence o’er thee.
Onward—still onward—comes the day
When smiling shores shall meet thee !
Thy beacon-star reposes there,
And hopes fulfill’d shall greet thee !


LINES WRITTEN AMONGST THE
RUINS OF SYRACUSE.
SPIRIT of Greece, awake thy song once
And from the rnin-mantled deserts
rise !
Send forth thy numbers on th’ Ortygian shore,
And bid them live—-as when the bird that dies,
Bursts from its ashes with a wild surprise.
Return again ! for thou hast slumbering been—
Thy sun went down beneath the wintry skies
Of long dark ages, and its ray serene
Forsook thy cherish’d fanes as though it ne’er had
been.
Return again to that loved spot of thine !
For the dark olive shades thy temples o’er;
Round many a column wreathes the tangled vine,
And silence triumphs on thy wave-wash d shore .


Spirit, thy mystic grandeur I adore !
Speed thy white wings across the ocean foam,
Nor let the sunset streak thy path once more,
As a bright, weary bird that’s born to roam;
But fold thy placid wings and seek thy Grecian
home.
Hast thou forgotten every snow-white fane P
Shall pensive maiden fling her lyre aside ?
Shall never minstrel boy breathe song again,
As swells his bosom with his nation’s pride ?
Oh, spirit of the Greeks ! thou dost abide
Somewhere, though hovering in the star-lit air ;
And every lily at the water side,
And every tall papyrus waving there,
Call on thy magic aid their sweetest song to bear !


WHERE SHALL WE WANDER?
the side of Egypt’s waters
p|-gv®j Are lute and song ;
And the music of her dark-eyed
daughters
Floats along,
Where sweeps the silvery Nile with current deep
and strong.
Shall we wander
that river famed in song ?
In the shade of Ormuz bowers
Endless spring
Breathes lightly over a thousand flowers,
Whose blossomings
Delicious fragrance on the evening breezes bring.
Shall we wander
Where the birds to Peris sing ?


WHERE SHALL WE WANDER ?
There are spots beside the sea
As lone and wild
As the yellow sands where I used to be
When a child,
And sparkling ocean shells my boyish heart beguiled.
Shall we wander
All along the sea-shore wild ?
Oh ! the bliss, when moonlight glances,
Bright as day,
And the azure flame of the fire-fly dances
With flickering ray
Through' India’s leafy woods amongst the blossoms
Shall we wander
Where the southern moonbeams play ?
ISTo ! let India boast her flowers
Of gorgeous dye—
And Persia delight in her fragrant bowers,
And the perfumed sigh
That comes upon the evening breeze from palm-
clad Araby—
I would wander
In the greenwood, silently.


88 WHERE SHALL WE WANDER?
The primroses and cowslips pale
That cluster there ;
And the modest flowers of the forest dale
With their woodland air,
Than painted blooms of Araby
To me are twice as fair !
We will wander
Where the violets kiss the air !
I have rambled in the wild-wood
Many a day,
When the laughing hours of happy childhood
Were round my way;
And the music of the summer birds beguiled the
live-long day !
Then we will wander,
Wander in the greenwood gay !


NETLEY ABBEY
BTLEY ! thy groves are fair!
1 * And through the deepness of thy wood-
land shades
The flashing beam of noontide summer fades
In penetrating there.
There is a holy calm
That steals into the breast of him who roams
Amid the stillness of thy fallen homes,
Like some deep working charm.
Around thy crumbling pile,
The forest oak hath spread for ages past;
And the low sounding of the mournful blast
Sweeps through thy ruin’d aisle.
In ages long gone by,
When thou wert fresh and fair, and the clear strain
Of deep, rich music fill’d thy holy fane
With echoing minstrelsy,—


Then was thy time of pride !
But now has pass’d the glory of thy day,
As when a glittering meteor fades away
Along the mountain side.
Thou hast no music now
But the lone echo of the wild swan’s note,
Or the clear trilling of the blackbird’s throat
Upon the alder bough.
Once, through thy tinted pane,
The western day reflected splendours o’er
The fluted column and the marble floor,
As it shall ne’er again !
E’en now, the setting day
Serves but to mock the ruin of thy fall,
As glow the sunbeams on thy ivied wall
And broken arches gray.
But when the moonbeams play
Among thy dusky canopy of leaves,
And light the track the gliding vessel weaves
Across the sheeted bay,—


Oh, then ! a lovelier spot,
Another solitude more calm and still,
Where thought may brood, and drink its pensive
fill—
