OUTSTANDING FEATURES
OF
GOOD YEAR
TRUCK AND BUS TYRES
1. 10% THICKER TREAD SPECIALLY DE-
SIGNED.
10% thicker tread of tough, wear-resisting rubber
a feature specially designed to give a longer
working life under the punishment of Australian
conditions.
Centre traction for extra grip and safety where
the tyre meets the road. Rugged, reinforced
shoulders to resist scuffing.
2. NEW-TYPE SUPERTWIST PLY CONSTRUC-
TION.
A regular line of truck tyres constructed of New-
Type Supertwist, which reduces the possibility
of tyre growth and results in greater durability
and longer tread wear.
3. MULTIPLE COMPOUNDING.
This new construction gradually increases the
toughness of the tyre from the inside out to the
tread, making possible greater resistance to separ-
ation and heat fatigue, plus more even distribu-
tion of shearing stresses.
4. DUAL BEADS.
Dual beads of high tensile, high carbon wire with
special reinforcing throughout withstand over-
loads, swaying, pulling out, and chafing.
5. DOUBLE BREAKER STRIPS.
Two breaker strips under tread extra protection
against fabric breaks and bruises.
6. WAVELESS CORD FABRIC.
permits positive insulation of each cord and
better impregnation of the cord fibres with live,
friction-proof rubber. Carcass runs cooler, lasts
longer.


SELECTING THE RIGHT TYRE FOR
THE JOB
To be efficient give maximum mileage, per-
formance and economy truck and bus tyre
equipment must be carefully selected for the
work to be done.
Full knowledge of the following operating con-
ditions is absolutely essential to selecting the
right size and type of tyre for the job.
1. Type of Vehicle.
2. Size, Type and Distribution of Load.
3. Road or Operating Surface Condi-
tions.
4. Traction Requirements.
5. Speeds.
6. Clearances.
7. Service Facilities Available.
For every operation, based on proper consider-
ation of the foregoing factors, there’s a type
and size tyre in the COMPLETE Goodyear line
that will give maximum efficiency.

GOODYEAR PNEUMATIC LUG
Undisputed master in off-the-road service, where loose
stones, sharp, tread-tearing rocks, and hard going are
encountered.
In strip mining, road building, log-hauling, in the oil
fields, in the roughest work on and oil the roads this
tyre has stood the test, kept on running for thousands
of miles after other tyres were gouged and battered
to destruction.


GOODYEAR SPECIAL PURPOSE

BALLOON TYRES FOR EARTH-
MOVING VEHICLES OFF THE
ROAD SERVICE


GOODYEAR TRUCK AND BUS
TUBES
HEAVY DUTY TRUCK AND BUS TUBE
Goodyear's complete line of Heavy Duty Truck tubes
is manufactured according to the most advanced
methods. Only the best rubber, purified by a filter-
ing process, is used. All tubes are electrically welded
at the splice into one continuous piece. All are
chemically compounded to resist heat and deteriora-
tion from age. All are water tested.
PROTECTED FROM LEAKS AROUND VALVES
—Goodyear-made, tough rubber-covered valves with
full length brass inserts are vulcanised into the tubes
at high pressure, preventing leaks around the valves
in service. Vents in the valve barrel permit release
of air trapped between the tyre and tube at time of
mounting.
FULL CIRCLE MOULDED FOR PERFECT FIT—
To insure perfect fit in the tyres, Goodyear Tubes are
vulcanised in full-size, ring-shaped moulds under high
pressure. Each mould is equipped with an automatic,
electrically-controlled timing device which opens the
moulds after a specific cure time, insuring uniformity
in vulcanisation.


FACTORS COVERING TYRE
MILEAGE
The charts following indicate the effect on TYRE
MILEAGE EXPECTANCY of the major factors
controlling tyre performance.
Careful analysis of these factors for individual opera-
tions will provide data needed to determine if tyre
costs per mile are satisfactory. It will also point the
way toward the means by which costs may be
lowered.
LOAD: The tyre must be large enough to run out
its normal life under the conditions and load which
it carries.
PRESSURE: - Inflation pressure must be carefully
maintained to avoid destruction of the tyre by broken
shoulders from under-inflation or by bruising from
over-inflation.
SPEED: An overloaded tyre will not deliver its
maximum mileage in high speed service. In this type
of service load ratings must be carefully observed.
PROPER RIM: The proper rim should be used for
each size tyre. This avoids damage to the tyre by
over-distortion. When an under-size rim is used
the carrying capacity of the tyre is actually less be-
cause of reduction in air volume. Even though the
load of a tyre on various size rims is rated the same,
it is obvious that the tyre will give better service on
its proper rim.
RIM SPACING: On a dual mounting, tyres must be
far enough apart to avoid contact at their deflected
point. Any contact between the tyres causes body
damage and premature failure.
MATCHING: Proper matching of tyres is of prime
importance in dual installation. In no case should
tyres which differ more than in diameter be in-
stalled on the same dual wheel.


MILEAGE REDUCED BY
OVERLOADING TYRES
Tyre mileage DIMINISHES rapidly as tyres arc
loaded beyond rated capacity. OVER.LOAD causes
fast tread wear by increasing the load per square inch
of contact area. It also causes irregular or cupping
wear due to excessive squirming of tread. OVER-
LOAD increases the magnitude of flexing, resulting
in excessive internal heat which promotes blowouts.
The effect of overload can be minimized by reduction
in speed.
Included fn the chart below is a tabic showing effect
of load, assuming that tyres deliver 30,000 miles
when loaded just to rated capacity. The figure of
30,000 miles is an arbitrary one—chosen merely to
illustrate method of using the chart.
Compare Cost Per Tyre Mile Not Initial Cost


CORRECT INFLATION INCREASES
MILEAGE
Adequate inflation is essential to satisfactory mileage.
UNDERINFLATION causes fast, irregular tread
wear due to the increased squirming and scuffing
of the tread contact area. Like overload, it increases
body flexing, and results in excessive internal heat
which may cause blowouts.
OVERINFLATION promotes the dangers of bruis-
ing and cutting by putting both tread and body
under greater tension. It also causes fast wear in the
centre of the tread due to the decrease in road con-
tact area and the resulting increase in load per square
inch, OVERINFLATION up to 10 pounds is per-
missible to offset in part excessive overload.
The table shown in the chart below assumes that re-
commended inflation produces 30,000 mile average.
This is an arbitrary figure, chosen merely to illustrate
method of using the chart.

WHEN TO PUT ON NEW TYRES
New tyres applied in the Autumn and Winter will
have a thinner tread by the time hot weather comes,
and therefore will dissipate heat faster. Consequently
they will run cooler during the hot season and will
give better mileage.
New tyres applied in Spring or Summer when tem-
perature is a factor, dissipate less heat due to the
heavier tread, and therefore run hotter, wear faster
and are more subject to heat blowouts.
New tyres applied initially in Autumn or Winter will
deliver about 25% more mileage than tyres applied
in Spring and Summer.
Careful planning of initial tyre application and rota-
tion of wheel positions pay dividends in higher
mileage and less frequent delays.

MATCHING OF DUAL TYRES
Proper matching of dual tyres is of prime importance
if maximum results nre to be obtained. In no case
should tyres which differ more than in diameter be
installed on the same dual assembly.
Whether the newer tyre should be installed on the
outside or inside position depends on the rate at
which tyres in each of these positions are wearing,
Experience has proved that one tyre or the other
wears at a faster rate until they hav e become
adjusted to a definite relationship in tread height.
From then on, they usually continue to wear in a
manner to maintain that condition. This relationship
is shown by the line tangent to the contours of the
two tyres in the following sketch.
“A" might be either Inside or
outside tyre; depending on road
contour, vehicle characteristics,
etc.
Effect of Proper Matching
The effect of placing the newer tyre in the faster
wearing position is explained and illustrated below.
DIAGRAM 1 represents
the initial tread depth of
each of the four tyres on
'tear axle of a truck.
DIAGRAM II shows that
a definite relationship has
been established between
the outside end inside tyres
with the former 10% more
worn than the latter.
DIAGRAM III shows the
tyres at the same mileage
At 17,500 miles outside
tyres wearing taster than
inside.

At 21,000 miles new tyre

as Diagram 11, but a new
tyre has been placed in the
left rear outside position.
DIAGRAM IV shows the
effect of about 3,500 miles
of running on the four
tyres. Note that the right
rear tyres have maintained
their relationship with about
a 10% differential in the
amount of wear between the
inside and outside tyre. On
the other hand, on the left
dual assembly, the left rear
outside tyre has worn much
faster than it normally should, so that the amount of
wear in 3,500 miles equals that of the inside tyre in
21,000 miles. This represents a definite loss in tread
rubber on the outside tyre which could have been
minimized in this case by applying the new tyre on
the inside instead of the outside position, and moving
the worn inside tyre to the outside.
At 26,500 miles LRO tyre
75% worn. Inside and
outside now show normal
differential in wear.
At 31,500 miles left real
dual tyre wear continues
at some rate . . . right
rear duals worn out; re-
placed by new tyres.
DIAGRAMS V AND VI show that the left rear
tyres have again assumed their normal relationship.
In this particular case, since the tyres on inside duals
wear slower, tyres should be matched so that the
lesser worn tyres are on the inside positions.
Since in some cases the reverse of this mav be true,
analyse each unit for the rate of wear on inside vs.
outside dual tyres.

WHEN TO ROTATE TYRES
Results of a number of tyres on tractor and trailer
operations indicate that the rate of tread wear is
definitely slower on initial applications of front tyres
than on rear tyres as shown by the slope of line (1)
compared to that of line (2) in the chart below.
New tyres applied to rear wore smooth ut 15,500
miles while the non-skid design of the new front
tyres was only 57% worn off.
Front tyres were run 20.000 miles on front position
(Line 1) then changed to rear. Note the increase in
rate of tread wear after the change (slope of Line 3
as compared to 2).
Total non-skid mileage of tyres started on rear posi-
tions as against tyres started on front and later
switched to rear, in the first case was 15,500 miles,
in the second case, 32 000 miles, A systematic method
of rotating tyres increases tyre mileage as much as
50%.

WHEEL POSITION AFFECTS TYRE
MILEAGE
Figures taken from actual performance show that
33% more mileage can be expected from tyres run
100% on trailer wheels than from tyres run 100%
on drive wheels.
Similarly, 57% higher mileage can be expected from
front tyres than than on drive wheels. (See chart
below.)

Analysing mileage by wheel position often discloses
the cause for low mileage tyres. Example: Misaligned

Compare Cost Per Tyre Mile Not Initial Cost


FOR MAXIMUM MILEAGE — DO
NOT BLEED TYRES
By bleeding is meant the practice of letting sir out
of tyres as inflation builds up beyond recommended
pressure due to the heat of operation.
Bleeding tyres increases amount of flexing. Greater
flexing causes higher tyre temperatures. Excessive
heat results in faster tread wear and increases danger
of heat blowouts. (See Chart below.)
If tyres are bled, inflation drops appreciably below
recommended pressure on cooling. Th’s necessitates
rigid control of inflation to insure proper pressure on
next trip.
A possible exception to the rule of not bleeding
occurs when tyres operate more or less continually
over rough roads where the danger of bruising will
be increased by overinflation.

AXLE SAG AFFECTS TYRE
MILEAGE
Heavy payloads often cause axles to sag, particularly
on trailers.
A sagging axle forces the inside tyre of a dual
assembly to carry more than its share of load. See
diagram below.
Results: Fast irregular tyre wear on the inside
shoulder of the inside dual. Blowouts due to over-
load.

vertical bar in centre of axle; and tightened by means
of turn buckle.
Compare Cost Per Tyre Mile Not Initial Cost


EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON
TREAD MILEAGE
Tread mileage is inversely proportional to tempera-
ture. As nir temperatures increase the rate of tread
wear also increases, and consequently tread mileage
decreases.
An increase from 75° to 85° will result in a reduc-
tion in tread mileage of about 13% (95 %-
82%).
A decrease in temperature from 75° to 65 ’ will
add about 9% (104%-95%) to tread life. (Sec
chart below.)
Where long periods of wet weather accompany
cooler weather, the rate of tread wear will be slower
than shown on the chart. Conversely, for periods
of hot dry weather, the rate of tread wear will be
much faster, especially over abrasive road surfaces.
Compare Cost Per Tyre Mile Not Initial Cost


HIGH SPEED INCREASES TREAD
WEAR
As speed increases, the number of flexes per minute
increases. The more rapidly a tyre flexes, the greater
the build-up of heat. As higher temperatures are
reached, tread rubber softens, and the tensile strength
of cords in the carcass is reduced. Softer tread lowers
its resistance to wear. A decrease in tensile strength
of body lowers its resistance to rend shock. The over-
all result is a decrease in tyre mileage.
The information in the chart below is based on the
premise that normal mileage is obtained at 35 miles
per hour. Any change from that speed is shown in
the table included in the chart. Normal mileage is
assumed to be 30,000 miles the figure is an arbit-
rary one.

SELECTING TYRES FOR SEMI-
TRAILER-TRACTOR
COMBINATIONS
Here’s a method for selecting the right tyre size for
semi-trailer-tractor combinations. Since the gross
weight of standard design tractor semi-trailers is dis-
tributed on the driving, trailing and front tyres in
practically the same manner for most makes and
models, it is possible to prc-detcrmine the size tyres
required for various gross weights. If it is necessary
to know the exact weight curried per tyre, follow the
method shown on pages 30 and 31.
How to Select the Tyre
1. Determine the total gross weight of the vehicle
(tractor, semi-trailer and payload).
2. Consult table below for recommended tyre size
for dual installation.


DETERMINING TYRE LOADS OF
DIFFERENT TYPE VEHICLES
Tyre capacity should be adequate for best service.
Loadometer or scale weight on EACH AXLE of a
fully loaded vehicle is the most satisfactory way of
determining actual load on each tyre.
With no means of weighing a fully loaded vehicle it
is possible to obtain approximate axle weights pro-
viding the following factors are known:
(1) Empty axle weights, (2) Pay load, (3) Measure-
ments shown in sketch.
Use formula below to determine proportion of
payload on each axle. (Reduce measurements to
inches.)
A
—• X Payload = Payload on Rear Axle.
C
B
X Payload Payload on Front Axle.
C
A = Distance from front axle to centre of payload.
(Note —Centre of body is usually centre of load.
Where load distribution is unequal, centre of load
must be estimated.)
B *=* Distance from rear axle to centre of payload.
C = Wheel base.
TRUCK PAYLOAD ANALYSIS
Example: Truck carrying a 6000 lb. payload.
Scale weights of empty truck:
Front axle 3000 lbs.
Rear axle 5000 lbs.


Dimensions are: A—171”; B—19"; C —l9o”.
A 171
~ X I).000 lbs. = 5,400 lbs. Rear Axle Payload.
C 190
B 19
= X 6,000 lbs. = 600 lbs. Front Axle Payload.
C 190
Total Rear Axle Weight = 5,000 lbs. plus 5,400
lbs. = 10,400 lbs.
Total Front Axle Weight = 3,000 lbs. plus 600
lbs. = 3,600 lbs.
Wheelbase
(C) measurement is
from front axle to
point midway be-
tween rear axles. Al-
though there may
be slightly unequal load distribution between rear
axles due to variation in chassis design, for practical
purposes it can be assumed that rear load is distri-
buted equally over rear tyres.
Payload on pivot point of
semi-trailer must be cal-
culated before analysing
tractor load distribution,
AS PAYLOAD ON
PIVOT POINT IS
TOTAL PAYLOAD ON
TRACTOR.
On tractors,
the pivot point
is the centre of
payload.
Trailers, other than single
axle, are calculated in the
same way as trucks.

THE PROPER RIM INCREASES
TYRE MILEAGE
Be Sure to Check the Size of Rim
After determining the type and size of tyre, the next
consideration is the proper rim equipment. Tyres are
designed to fit a certain size rim and, if rims are in-
correct in size, early tyre failure may result. GOOD-
YEAR RIMS are simple in design, consisting of but
two parts. Proper tyre bead support is obtained in
all applications.
The size of
any rim can
be deter-
mined when
markings are
covered or
have been
obliter-
ated by meas-
uring distances
below.
It is also possible to determine the rim size when
the tyre is mounted by using a rim gauge as shown
in black at the left above and supplied by your rim
distributor. This rim gauge is primarily for use on
American type rims.


DUAL PNEUMATIC TYRE
SPACING
When making changeovers from original tyres see
that dual pneumatics are spaced so they do not
touch when deflected under maximum load. The
distance from centre to
centre of dual tyres
also centre to centre of
rims i c known as
“Dual Tyre spacing.”
Sec “A” in chart.
Use the following rule
to determine if spacing
i:: adequate.
“If the dual tyre spac-
ing of the present instal-
lation is greater than the
maximum cross section width of the desired size of
tyre under load (See dimension tables) the spacing
is adequate to allow clearance when tyres are fully
deflected,”
Any changes to larger rims or tyres decreases clear-
ance between inside tyres and nearest obstruction. Sec
“B” in chart.
Determine from rim line-up or by measurement, the
difference the change contemplated will make in rim
and tyre centre-to-centre spacing, also difference in
tyre normal cross section width, if larger tyres are to
be used. Add one-half of the increase in rim spacing
and one-half the increase in tyre width, then sub-
tract the sum from clearance with old equipment. If
there remains about one inch clearance, the proposed
changes can be made without dinger of interference.
On disc wheels, to secure increases of spacing, use a
spacer between the wheels, at the hub. However, it
may be necessary to use wheels with more flare to
get additional spacing.
To check overhead clearance allow for flexing of
springs by measuring space between body bumper to
spring bumper which is maximum distance body can
drop. Dimension “C” must be greater than spacing
between bumpers.

GOODYEAR RIMS FOR TRUCKS,
BUSES AND GRADERS
Semi-Drop Centre Rims for Use With
H.D. Truck Airwheel Tyres on Light
Trucks.
It is not desirable to attempt the application of the
new 7.50-16—8-ply tyre on the conventional Full
Drop Centre Rim, nor would the truck owner receive
the full value of the larger size tyre if it is applied
to a rim as narrow as four or four and one-half
inches. At present all sizes of six-ply tyres can be
mounted on full drop centre rims. But here again
the user loses a part of the capacity and mileage of
the new tyre, because the narrow rim reduces the
total sectional diameter of the tyre.
Semi Drop Centre Rims are available in 4.50-16 and
5.50-16 for changeover purposes also are furnished
as original equipment on some models of light de-
livery trucks. For Rim Dimensions see following
table:
Semi-Drop Centre Rims for Tyres Used on
Road Graders
Above dimensions are to nearest 1/16".
Other sixes of Semi-Drop Centre Rims available see
Goodyear Rim Catalogue.


GOODYEAR RIMS FOR TRUCKS
AND BUSES
Goodyear Rims for use with Pneumatic Truck Tyres
are used exclusively by several of the largest truck
manufacturers nnd as standard equipment practically
throughout the industry.
Type K-28
1— Back flange integral with the rim base providing
rigid construction.
2 Split in base. Makes mounting or removal of
tyre easy.
3 Demounting notch always visible —no special
tools needed to remove q tyre.
4 Rugged, endless one-piece side ring, completely
fills the gutter no floating.
5 Rim gutter. Exceptionally strong. Hot rolled to
contour.
6 Open valve stem slot. Less effort in mounting
tyre. No damage to valve stem.
The K-28 Rim has a 28 degree single bevel mount-
ing which is standard with truck and trailer manu-
facturers.
K-28 Rims are made in all standard sizes and dia*
meters. They consist of two simple sturdy parts, a
split base and a continuous ring.
The split base of K-28 rims, a patented exclusive
Goodyear feature, makes both tyre application and
removal an easy operation not obtainable with con-
tinuous base rims.


GOODYEAR RIMS FOR TRUCKS
AND BUSES
Type “L”
1— Demounting notch always visible. A heavy screw-
driver is all you need to remove the side ring.
2 Visible locking joint in side ring—no giap to cut
into bead of tyre.
3 Rugged one-piece side ring, completely fills the
gutter of rim.
4 Back flange—integral with rim base, providing
rigid construction.
5 Rim gutter exceptionally strong, rolled hot to
contour.
6 Rim base^ — of hot rolled steel—metal distributed
to give maximum strength with minimum weight.
The type “L” Goodyear Rims are made especially for
use on disc wheels such as Budd and Spokesteel
Wheels. “L” Rims are of the same steel section as
“K”— 28 rims, but have a continuous base and a
split ring as a split base cannot be used successfully
on a disc wheel.
Goodyear rim equipment and changeover service is
handled by rim distributors conveniently located in
principal cities.


GOODYEAR SIDE FLANGES
For 18.00-24 and 15.00-20 Tyres
Standard rolled steel rim bases for these two sizes
are not available. These large side flanges were de-
signed for use on wheels made with cast steel bases
or bases which are cast as an integral part of the
steel wheel.
See Goodyear rim catalogue for details.
“K” 28 Cut Down Change Over Bands
When changing trucks from solid tyres to pneumatics
it is cheaper to cut down the old wheels and weld
new felloe bands to the remaining portion of the
spokes, thus using the old hubs, bearing cups, brake
drums, etc.
For such changeovers GOODYEAR “K” felloe
bands, both dual and single, are avr.ilable through
rim and wheel distributors for use with Type “K”
Rims.
