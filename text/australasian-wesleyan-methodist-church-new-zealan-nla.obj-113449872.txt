REPORT ON CHURCH PROPERTY, 1875.
The Property Schedules in some instances are so imperfectly filled in, and in
other cases have been so recently received that all the information desirable
cannot be supplied to the Conference. On one important point the requisite
information is supplied by other returns, shewing the Properties which have been
acquired by the Connexion during the year.


The Secretary deems it important to call the attention of the Conference to the
following facts: —
(1). That several of the properties are in the names of individual Ministers
and have not been settled on trusts.
(2) In a few instances the Titles are incomplete, or otherwise of an
unsatisfactory character ; this is particularly the case, in reference to
registration.
(3) The deeds of various properties are scattered in different places, and no
person is responsible for their safe keeping.

labours of His servants during the past year, resulting in an increase of 201 fully
accredited members, with 628 on trial. We affectionately recommend our church
members to maintain a clear sense of their acceptance with God, and to seek that


endowment of power, which is the one real qualification for Christian usefulness ;
while we resolve to give ourselves more fully to prayer and to the study and
preaching of the great truths of the Gospel, with the hope that our preaching may
he not in word only, but in power, with the Holy Ghost, and with much assurance.
2. The Conference directs its Ministers to pay special attention to the oversight
of Catechumen Classes, and, also to arrange for Children’s Meetings, in order to
secure, if possible, their Conversion to God; their formal reception into church-
membership ; and their attendance at the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper.

Prayer, for the revival of religion throughout the Churches.

the subject of Temperance, viz.;—
“ The Conference regards Intemperance as amongst the most serious moral and
“ social evlls now prevalent, and urges the Methodist people to discounten-
“ an ° e tij oB6 Customs of society which foster this vice, and to promote all
legislative measures which aim at the restraint or the extinction of the
“ liquor traffic. Whilst asserting the Methodist Church to be itself a
“ Temperance society, the Conference cordially recognises the services
rendered to public morals and to religion by independent temperance
and total abstinence associations. The Conference recommends Metho-
dists to co-operate heartily with such associations, guarding themselves,
“nevertheless, from the error of allowing their sympathy with efforts
“ directed against a special evil to weaken their relations with the church,
or divert their attention from those wider Christian enterprises which are
designed to rescue mankind, not only from drunkenness, but from every
“ form of sin.”

THE ANNUAL ADDRESS
OF THE
NEW ZEALAND
A'ESLEYAX MET FI01)IST COXEEREXOE,
MEMBERS OF THE WESLEYAN CHURCH IN NEW ZEALAND.
Beloved Brethren, —Permitted by a kind Providence to assemble in our third
New Zealand Conference we now, as our habit has been, affectionately greet you
as the people of our sacred charge, praying that there may abound unto you more
richly, grace, and peace, from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.
Yearly we meet to review our state and position as a section of Christ’s Church
in this Colony ; to deliberate on the duties of the present time ; to weigh all that
affects our personal piety and efficiency as Ministers of Christ’s Gospel; to ponder
how we [may better serve the great Head of the Church, and you its members and
adherents; and to adapt whatever appliances we possess to the ever changing
circumstances of time and society. Strong as are the motives moving us as
ministers, to guard and strengthen the bonds of a common brotherhood by mutual
counsel, exhortation and prayer ; not less so are those which link us to you in
affectionate solicitude and Christian sympathy ; and we desire above all things that
we may be helpers of each others’ faith and joy.
During the period elapsing between the annual sessions of Conference our atten-
tion is necessarily, to a large extent, restricted to our more personal spheres of
labour. But now we endeavour to place before our minds, as we address you, the
more various and extensive wants and operations of our whole Church.
We review the results of the year’s labours with mingled feelings of humility
and gratitude. The numerical results, when the class meeting test of Church
membership is applied, is by no means encouraging, or commensurate in fruitful-
ness with the appliances that have been in force. We cannot hide from ourselves,
however much we may deplore it, the disinclination of many whose souls have
been brought to Christ by our agency, or others whose lives have been quickened
into living piety by the same means, who yet refrain from joining any of our
classes, and so exclude themselves from membership, though one with us in
sympathy in other respects. Whether it arise from the difficulty of obtaining the
most efficient class leaders, both in piety and intelligence ; or a growing reticence
on the subject of Christian experience in a more active and cultured age; or a
covert belief that better modes of Christian fellowship are obtainable ; the fact
abides, and this institution in which so many have been counselled and stimulated
to perseverance in well-doing has fallen from the position it once occupied as a
means of good. Hence the paucity often in our numerical returns, and the appa-
rent disadvantage in which we stand in contrast with other Churches who base the
results of their labours on different data. But when we lay aside this test of
results, and simply regard what other Christian communities would deem as clear
evidences of vital prosperity, despondency may well give place to cheerfulness and
devout gratitude to the “ God from whom all blessings flow.” If enlarged and


growing congregations ; if earnest and hearty worship in our public assemblies ; if
liberal support to the institutions of our Church; if crowded Sunday Schools, and
the conversion of scores of men under the word preached throughout the colony
during the year, be tokens of abiding prosperity, we have had these. In memory
we recur to scenes in the past year, and as we witness hundreds who have been
translated into the Kingdom of God’s Son, we say: “ These are the evidences of
our apostleship, the proof that we have not preached in vain, and that you have
not prayed in vain.”.
In a goodly number, if not the majority, of our Circuits, God has been pleased
to pour out His Spirit, and save souls. The scenes of revival witnessed on such a
grand scale in England, America, and in various parts of the continent of Europe,
have visited us to some extent here also. Whilst we thankfully adore the Author
of every good and perfect gift for these tokens of His love, let us live for, and in
ardent anticipation of, their continuance and growth.
Two things were very noticeable in the revivals by which we have been favoured
during the year—special effort and Christian song! The week of special prayer
appointed by the last Conference was generally observed, with preaching services
of an evangelistic character, having direct aim at the conversion of souls ; and in
no instance, as far as we know, without evidences of spiritual good, both in the
salvation of sinners and quickening of believers. As we sow, we generally reap.
Special efforts are‘sealed with special blessings, and though it cannot be expected
that congregations should always live at the high pressure common on such occa-
sions, yet we are of opinion that the lessons of the year point to the advantage
and duty of our more frequently marshalling all the Church’s energies, so as to
bear immediately on the many, who in our midst, are living without Christ—how-
ever near some of them may be to the Kingdom. If the ordinary agencies fail in
reaching the consciences of men, then extraordinary efforts become imperative.
The place given to Christian song, both throughout the world and in our midst, iii
the evangelistic work of the year has been very marked. So it generally has been
in revival work. The founders of our Church were men of song, as well as men of
prayer ; and multitudes flocked to their meetings, drawn as much by their hearty
singing, as by their earnest preaching. So it was in the German reformation.
Luther was as much a reformer in Christian psalmody as in Christian doctrine.
“ Luther conquers us by his songs,” said the Romish Cardinal; and whilst the
great Reformer’s sermons are forgotten, his hymns and tunes will go on creating
melody in human hearts till time is no more. To sing is quite as much a Chris-
tian duty as to pray. We are enjoined as often to praise God as we are to pray to
him. In every effort to render the musical part of our public worship more effec-
tive we heartily rejoice. Why should not our Church music be rendered attractive,
having a pure gospel as its accompaniment ? True, there is a danger of its falling
to the level of a mere artistic performance, instead of being one of the most
elevating and devotional elements in public worship. But which of God’s gifts is
not open to abuse ?
You will be glad to learn that the labours of our brethren on the Mission
Stations amongst the Native race, have been attended with more than ordinary
encouragement. To not a few of the Maories the gospel has been the power of God
unto salvation, whilst many others, by their habitual attendance on the public
means of grace, express an earnest desire to know the truth. This department of
our work presents openings which we are sorry to say, the want of men and means,
prevents our taking up. We earnestly commend the subject to the liberality and
prayers of our people. “ Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth
labourers into His harvest.”
Our Home Mission work never had such demands on our consideration
and liberality before. The wide and thinly populated country districts have
a claim upon us which we have long felt, but have hitherto been unable to
meet. A few men of an earnest evangelistic spirit, to itinerate amongst these
localities, would be of incalculable value, and would doubtless, soon pave the way
for the formation of new Circuits. We look to the great Head of the Church,
and to you, the members of his mystical body, that this urgent want may be
shortly met. If all contributed as some contribute ; if all prayed as some pray;
if all worked as some work; if all lived as some live, every demand would be soon
satisfied, and eVery opening station occupied; and our Church would rise to three-
fold its present efficiency.


There is no section of our work that has engaged more close attention than the
Christian instruction of the young. We have to report 141 Sunday Schools, 1041
teachers, with 9999 scholars. With such a recruiting ground ; with such materials
in the most plastic and susceptible period of human life ; with such a number of
agents, of various talent, we should naturally look for spiritual results on a much
larger scale than we have yet ever witnessed. Were there no terrible leakage, we
should realize from this department of work alone, a yearly accession to our New
Zealand Church, of over five hundred members. The question which has been
before us, and practically before the Christian Church throughout the world is:—
How are we to retain for Christ and Christian work, those who begin life savingly
related to the covenant of mercy, unconscious participants in the salvation of
Christ’s atonement, and recognized as such by us in their initiation into the visible
Church by baptism ? Were this question practically solved, it would form a new
era in the history of Christianity. Not only would this be true on purely numeri-
cal grounds, but in the grander fact, that whole lives, in unbroken continuity,
would be given to Christ, instead of abridged and crippled fragments as is the
case in late conversions—conversions that scarcely repair the evils of the wasted
period.
What we want supremely, and which in itself would secure abundant success in
every department of our work is, the infusion of a more intense sympathy with
Christ. “Be ye holy,” never had greater emphasis than now." “Ye are my wit-
nesses,” Christ says to each one of us. Let us see that we give no partial or
defective representation of him. Let his doctrines become incarnated in us, and
then his glorious character will be mirrored from our lives. This higher Christian
life we urge upon every member as a duty, and the highest privilege reserved for
man. Let not that blessing which was once peculiar to our Church, but which is
now sounding from many a pulpit outside our domain, cease to be sought after as
a part of our very birthright as Christians. “ Grow in grace ” —or moral beauty—
“ and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.” We want to see amongst you, men
clothed in moral beauty, as portrayed by Christ in his sermon on the mount; men
redeemed from evil as presented by 1 kail; men dwelling in God, as described by
John. Let there be a perfect loyalty to God, and there will be an instinctive
response to every duty; and duty itself, will rise into the higher element of delight.
Then the law of self-sacrifice, mellowed into love, springing from a sense of indi-
vidual obligation, will become the regal principle in your lives as it was in Christ’s.
Then the subject of sanctification will proclaim itself, in the deeds and temper of
a Christly life.
In seeking earnestly to cultivate the best gifts, we would counsel you to a
diligent attendance on all the means of grace, by which the divine life is created
and developed in the human character. “ Forget not the assembling of
yourselves together as the manner of some is.” As far as possible, never let your
place be vacant in the sanctuary. Let other duties be so arranged as not to in-
fringe on this. Your presence there is an exemplary good to others, while it also
brings you into immediate intercourse with those spiritual channels which impart
grace to help in time of need. As the master of assemblies descends, expecting to
meet you there, so ever resort to these, believing that he will make good his
promise : “In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will
bless thee.”
Be devout and earnest students of God’s word. It is still “ a lamp unto our
feet, and a light unto our path.” By taking heed to its precepts there is ever great
reward. With all the treasures of knowledge of which the age is possessed, we
cannot afford to consult our Bibles less. Its promises are true : expect their daily
fulfilment in your lives. Its rules are divine: let all your actions be squared by
them. It is “ profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness ” —it is more—it shields the life in the hour of fiercest conflict. No
other weapon did Christ use to foil the shafts of Satan in the wilderness. Medi-
tate in it day and night, so that your belief may not be an hereditary or hearsay
matter, but the result of intelligent personal investigation. Ever remember that
God expects the reproduction of the moral truths of his word in our lives.
Cultivate the spirit of prayer. Suffer nothing to infringe upon your daily com-
munion with God. Kneeling before his throne, anticipate the duties and trials of
the day, and gain strength to meet them. Bead the teaching of the past year on
the subject. Earnest prayer was the harbinger of all the wide-spread blessings in


which the period has been so fruitful. No less so will the faithful performance of
this duty, be prophetic of a revived life. In cultivating the spirit of private devo-
tion, resort to the throne of our great High Priest, not only when the mind is
burdened with its weight of cares, but also when the soul, in an overflowing joy,
is lifted out of the night of care and want. Let God have the best of our highest
moods. What would we think of the friend who never sought our society, but when
in quest of some gift. Let God have the soul’s noblest attitudes of joyful com-
munion as well as the cry of need.
Strive to maintain piety in the family circle. Let it be redolent of that love
which we hope to see investing every member when ultimately gathered in our
Father’s home above. We are what the family atmosphere makes us. We never
get beyond its influence to the latest day of a lengthy pilgrimage. How important
then that this moulding power from which we never escape, should be divinely pure
and good. If there be discord at home, there cannot be individual peace abroad.
Let the young see that the parents’ religion is productive of joyfulness, kindness,
and gentleness. Then a Father’s and a Mother’s God will have meaning to
them.
Strive to be active Christians. Christ “ went about doing good.” So ought
his humblest follower. Let not our Local Preachers, Leaders, and Sunday-school
Teachers, who render such important and valuable service to our Church, have a
monopoly of Christian work. “Go work in my vineyard ” is an injunction
addressed by Christ to every follower. “ What wilt thou have me to do ?” was the
converted Paul’s first enquiry. Let it rise anew in every heart throughout our
Church, and providence will furnish an answer.
We are grateful to the Giver of life, that our ministerial ranks remain unbroken
by the removal of any from their earthly toils during the year. Yet, respecting
the homes of many of our people, this is not the case. Some yearn “for the touch
of a vanished hand, and the sound of a voice that is still.” We weep with those
that weep. Not a few have been called upon to make their contributions to the
ranks of the Church triumphant, and every such translation renders more
emphatic the injunction. “Be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not,
the Son of man cometh.” To some who hear this address this will doubtless be
the last year of life. You have seen its dawn, but you may not see its close. See
then, that the lamp of grace is ever kept replenished, trimmed, and brightly
burning ; so, that, when the summons comes, you may be ripe for the companion-
ship of angels, and the spirits of the just made perfect. The majority of you will
probably continue in your probationary life. Let that life, with all its solemn
responsibilities, be more than ever surrendered into the hands of a faithful Creator,
and every faculty of being trained to fuller exercise in the ennobling service of our
Divine master. Our one great duty here, is this, —to sow the seed of truth and
happiness, and wait the summer morning, for the harvest is the end of the world.
Be intent on this one thing, labouring meanwhile, to break the fallow ground,
stirring up the loosened soil, sowing beside all waters, knowing that we shall reap
in due season, if we faint not, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred fold.
Signed on behalf, and by order of the Conference.
Alexander Reid, President.
John Chump, Secretary.
