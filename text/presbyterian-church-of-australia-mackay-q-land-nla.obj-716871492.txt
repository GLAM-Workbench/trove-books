FORMER MINISTERS OF THE CHURCH




History of Presbyterianism
in Mackay
DEN years after white people had settled at Port Mackay
the Presbyterian people began to organize, and the
Presbyterian Church appeared.
In 1872 the Rev. J. McAra visited Mackay and remained a
short time. He conducted Public Worship regularly, and accom-
panied by Mr. Donald Ross, visited the people.
It was not until 1874, however, that a publicr meeting of
Presbyterians was convened and held in the Victoria Hotel. At
this meeting there were present Rev. T. Blain (who had come to
preach in Mackay for a month), Messrs. Kemp, Mclntyre, McLean,
Walker, Middrick, Forbes, Currie, Henderson, Scott, and A. B.
Williamson. This meeting decided that Public Worship should be
conducted in Martin’s Assembly Room for a month.
Later in the same year a meeting of the Congregation was
held, and the first Committee of Management was elected. The
Committee appointed its officers : Donald Ross, Chairman, A. B.
Williamson, Secretary, Arch. Mclntyre, Treasurer.
The Committee went early to work and canvassed the town
and district. At a meeting of the Congregation held subse-
quently it was agreed to call the Rev. T. Blain.
The same year, 1874, a Sunday School was opened, Mr. Coutts,
Mr. J. Milne, and Miss J. M. Ross being the teachers. The School
was conducted for a time in the office of the timberyard. Later
on, the place of meeting for the children, as well as for Public
Worship, was the local Court House.
An allotment having been purchased at a Government land
sale held during this year, the Committee decided to proceed with
the building of a Church. The tender of Mr. G. Voysey was
accepted (£287/10/-) and the work was commenced. Mr. J. Milne
acted as inspector on behalf of the Committee.
Some arrangements for Mr. Blain’s induction has been sug-
gested, but it was thought that such a service should be delayed
until it could be conducted in the new Church. Early in 1875,
however, Mr. Blain left Mackay, and his induction never took
place.
The Rev. Hausmann was the next to minister in this
Church. He conducted some services in the German tongue in
addition to the usual diets of worship in English. Before the end
of the year, however, the minister had resigned.
For over six months the Church was without a pastor. In
August, 1876, the Rev. Thomas Hume arrived, and in the follow-
ing March was inducted by the Rev. Alex. Hay, D.D., acting as
a commission from the Presbytery of Rockhampton. Thus Mr.
Hume was the first minister inducted into the Presbyterian
Church, Mackay. Twelve months later the Kirk Session was
formed, the first elders being Messrs. D. Ross, A. B. Williamsop,
and Jas. McKenzie. Mrs. Ross, of Calrossie, presented the Church
with a Communion Service. With a settled minister the need for
a Manse was felt, and in this year, 1878-—44 years ago—the
Manse was built.


In the earlier years of the Church one of the most popular
forms of social activity was the Annual Soiree. These gatherings
were often very helpful financially. There is on record a Soiree
that realised £5O/18/-. Surely it must have been a great gather-
ing of the clans and the near neighbours !
In 1882 Mr. Hume found it necessary through ill health to
leave Mackay, and early in the next year he died in Brisbane.
His body was brought back to Mackay and interred in the local
cemetery. The ministry of Mr. Hume meant much to the Church.
In his time were formed the happiest relationships between
pastor and people. Coming as it did so early in the life of the
Church, this ministry, equable and pastoral, established firmly the
Presbyterian cause in this town. Mr. Hume endeared himself to
his people as a gentleman in Christ and a true shepherd of souls.
In November of 1883 the Rev. A. McWatt Allan was inducted,
and remained as minister until 1887. Mr. McWatt Allan con-
ducted the first communion service held at Walkerston. In 1884
the elders at that centre were Messrs. Wm. Gargett, Jas. Donald-
son, R. H. Donaldson, and J. Smart. At that time Walkerston
was part of this charge. About this time it was decided that a
new Church should be built in Mackay. The fulfilment of this
decision, however, was left for other years.
After Mr. McWatt Allan left, the Church was without a
minister for about a year, until in October 1888, the Rev. W.
Dunlop Barrie was inducted. This year a storm passing over the
town did some damage to the properties. It was a time of
depression in the district, and a time of stress for the Church.
In 1889 the old kerosene lights in the Church gave place to gas.
Mr. Barrie remained until January 1894, and then the Church was
again without a minister and remained so for some eighteen
months.
In 1895, the Mackay Church and the Walkerston Church,
working in conjunction, called the Rev. James Gibson, M.A., of
Bowen, and he was inducted minister in July of that year. At
this time the communion roll contained sixty names.. New life
began to manifest itself in the Church, and Mr. Gibson quickly
built up a strong congregation and a united people. The Com-
mittee of Management reported in 1896, “never has the outlook
been more hopeful than at present.”
The question of a new Church was again taken up. The
Committee advised, “that a building with seating accommodation
for 350 be erected at a cost not exceeding £1200.” The congrega-
tion in meeting assembled decided to act on this advice, and
immediately a subscription list was arranged, being opened by
Mr. S. Lambert, with £lO/10/-.
In 1897—the semi-Jubilee of the Church, henceforward to be
known as St. Paul’s—the foundation stone of the new and present
Church was laid. This ceremony was performed by the Mayor of
the town, Mr. H. B. Black, and took place on the late Queen
Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee Day—22nd June. At that time the
Session consisted of Donald Ross, A. B. Williamson, and Andrew
Wyper. Mr. C. Daire was Chairman of Committee, and Mr. W. B,
Eaves Superintendent of the Sunday School.
The following year the Presbytery of Townsville visited
Mackay and dedicated and opened the new Church. The visiting
ministers were the Revs. S. G. Crawford, M.A. (Moderator of
Assembly), J. Mclntyre, and Richard Kerr. Captain Adrian pre-
sented a bell to be hung in the new Church.

PRESENT CHURCH.




About this time the Church began to express in a variety of
ways the life increasing within her. In 1896 the Women’s Guild
was formed. A few years later the first Juvenile Exhibition was
held. To Mr. Gibson was due the formation of the Boys’ Brigade,
with Mr. James Christie as Captain and Instructor. After three
strenuous years Mr. Gibson left on a visit to Scotland. The
Session recorded its high sense of appreciation of his labours
and wished him every success in his mission to induce men to
come from Scotland to exercise their ministry in Queensland.
In 1899 Mr. Gibson was again fulfilling the office of the ministry
here. “The Church Record” made its first appearance shortly
after his return.
The spiritual life of the Church was quick and strong. In
1902 the Rev. D. C. Davidson, M.A., conducted a successful
evangelistic mission, and the minister was able to report an
enrolment of over fifty young people in the Bible Class.
From the beginning of the Church’s life no one had been
more loyal and abounding in the good work than Mr. A. B.
Williamson ; and in 1903, when he attained his twenty-fifth year
in the office of the eldership, the Congregation presented him
with an address :
“You were one of the founders of the Church, and for the
greater part of its history you have acted as treasurer : in every
office you have been found faithful. The Congregation has not
been unobservant of your life and work. It has felt that in the
modesty and integrity of your life the doctrine of our Lord has
been truly adorned ; and in presenting you with this watch, we
would ask you to accept it as a slight indication of the respect
and esteem which are in the heart of the Congregation towards
you.” '" r>
In 1904 the Session had sad occasion to place on record “their
sincere regret at the removal from their number and the loss
sustained by the congregation caused by the death of Donald
Ross, who had been so intimately connected with their history
as a congregation and who had faithfully served the Church as a
ruling elder since its foundation.”
In July of the same year the Session received the first
intimation that Mr. Gibson’s ministry was drawing to a close,
and before the end of the year the minister had accepted a
unanimous call from Park Church, South Brisbane. Thus Mr.
Gibson was minister of St. Paul’s for nine years the longest
pastorate in the history of the Church. His ministry was notable
for other reasons. Under his influence not only was the central
Church quickened, but the town and country Churches worked
closely and happily together. Under Mr. Gibson’s leadership
St. Paul’s became interested in the prosperity of Presbyterianism
throughout the State, and the Church here became one of the
strongest and most influential in Queensland.
By the beginning of 1905 the Rev. Andrew Dunn, M.A., had
been called and inducted. Monthly services at Farleigh were
commenced, and the question of securing an assistant to the
minister for the purpose of advancing the Church at Homebush,
Alligator Creek, and Plane Creek was considered. Opinion be-
came more definite concerning the need for a new Sunday School.
Unfortunately Mrs. Dunn did not enjoy good health in Mackay,
and even after returning from a trip to the Old Land was not
able to retain her strength. On this account Mr. Dunn found it
necessary to leave Mackay, which he did after a rich and schol-
arly ministry of almost five years.


The Church was again called on to pass through a period of
unsettlement, until the Rev. David Galloway was inducted in
January 1911. In the same year the Church was visited by the
Rev. W. S. Rolland, Moderator of the General Assembly of Aus-
tralia. The next year the town was visited by the Chapman-
Alexander Mission Party. As a result of this Mission the
spiritual life of the Church was deepened, and the evangelistic
spirit of the minister was able to nourish the Church thus
quickened. Christian work amongst the young was advanced,
and the Sunday School, under Mr. Galloway, attained a high
standard of efficiency.
In 1912 the Sunday School sustained a heavy loss when Mr.
John Christie resigned the office of Superintendent after many
years service. The Session recorded appreciation of Mr. Christie’s
work in a special minute : “His retirement from this honourable
position undoubtedly marks another stage in the history of the
Presbyterian Church in Mackay, and the Kirk Session desires to
place on permanent record its high appreciation, not only of the
long and faithful service rendered to the Church by Mr. Christie
as Superintendent of the Sunday School, but of his unique service
to the Church in this town in the many and varied offices he has
been called upon to fill, and the faithful discharge of duties
connected with the same.”
At the same meeting the Congregation was pleased to honour
Mr. Robert Hamilton, who had served the Church for twenty-five
years, and who was about to leave Mackay for the good of his
health.
During 1913 extensive alterations and additions were made
to the Manse. In August 1915, Mr. Galloway left Mackay. For
eighteen months the Church was without a minister, and in this
period owed much to the faithful and eloquent preaching of Mr.
Alex. Grant, elder.
In November 1916, the Rev. A. G. Macintosh-Carter, 8.A.,
was inducted. Mr. Carter’s name will always be associated with
changes that were effected to the interior of the Church building.
The great cyclone of 1918 damaged the Church materially.
Several hundreds of pounds were required to repair the building,
and to provide a communion platform. On this was placed a
communion table of chaste design, presented by Mr. A. Grant.
The wall immediately behind the pulpit was removed, and this
greatly improved the ventilation of the Church. The work of
building a new Sunday School was revived, and in 1918 the
foundation stone was laid by the Rev. Richard Glaister, M.A.,8.D.,
Principal of Emanuel College, Brisbane.
During these years the strain of the great war was felt by
our people in common with the people of the Empire. The
Church was called upon to suffer the loss of many noble sons.
Under Mr. Carter s sympathetic oversight the people were com-
forted and encouraged. A temporary roll of honour was inscribed
and several memorials dedicated in the Church.
On account of ill health Mr. Carter was compelled to leave
Mackay in January 1920. Three months later the Rev. Richard
Bardon, 8.A., was inducted, and still continues his ministry. The
completion of the new Sunday School was the. work awaiting
minister and people together. This was undertaken in a united
and determined spirit, and during 1922 the School that had been
the hope of the congregation for years became a reality. It was
dedicated and opened on the 22nd of April by the Rev. J. B.
Galloway, Director of Welfare of Youth Department.

PRESENT CHURCH INTERIOR.




It will be seen that the life of our Church has by no means
been an easy and an even way. It will also be seen that the
Hand of our God has been upon His people here for good. We
thank God and take courage. He has granted to us a good
success. Under His Grace this is due in large measure to many
persons whose names are not written in this record. All who
worked here, and whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book
of Life, are the real pillars upon which the Church of to-day rests.
As we have entered into their labours it remains for us to
simulate their spirit. With a faith that sees Him who is invisible,
in a hope sure and steadfast, and in love from which self-seeking
is excluded, the Church still moves forward conquering and to
conquer.
“Praise God, from whom all blessings flow ;
Praise Him, all creatures here below ;
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.”
