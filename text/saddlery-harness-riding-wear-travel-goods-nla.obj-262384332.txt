A WONDERFUL INVENTION
FITZALL
Poison
Antidote
Locket
FOR YOUR DOG
Every Stockman should have an antidote for poison liable to be
picked up by his dog at any time.
The logical place for that antidote is on the dog’s collar, and the
FITZALL ANTIDOTE LOCKET is always on the collar ready for emer-
gency, providing a first-aid treatment on the spot.
The locket is of brass and contains three watertight brass cylinders,
each containing approximately 10 grains of Ipecacuanha, a powerful non-
poisonous physical antidote (emetic) sufficient for the average size dog.
Three average doses in all.

EXTENSION LADDERS AND STEPS
In Use as a Step
Send for Catalogue and
Price List of Complete
Ranges
Extension Steps
Can be converted from a Step
Ladder to an Ordinary Ladder in
a few seconds and adjusted to any
height.
In adjusting the step to its nor-
mal position, place the back section
on the hooks of the front section,
with the bevel edge at the top and
towards the front section, then pull
the sections apart so that the back
locks on to the hooks. On no ac-
count reverse the back section.
To use as a ladder—Close the
back section up and lift it straight
up to the height required, the rung
drops into the inner bend of the
hook and the sides lit into the top
\ of the step where it is checked out,
' and the back will then be quite
rigid and strong.
Stock sizes are as follows;
sft. step, extending to Bft. 6in. lad-
der, increasing by Ift. to 10ft. step,
extending to 18ft. 6in ladder.
With the longer length steps it
is advisable to have splayed backs
at a slight increase of price.
Improved Extension
Ladders
A good, strong Extension Ladder made
of first class clear grained Oregon with
Spotted Gum rungs, reinforced with a
steel liner let into the timber at the
sides of the ladder sections.
The hoisting rope of this ladder oper-
ates from the side and when the ladder
is fully extended almost entirely dis-
appears, allowing free space for work-
ing. A centre pull can be fitted if
desired.
As this ladder is rather heavy, Friction
Rollers can be fitted at the top of the
extending section and will be found
a big help when pulling up big ladders.
A Hoop or Bow can also be fitted where
the ladder is required for pole work at
a small increase in price. These ladders
are made stock sizes as follows:
Bft. height closed, fully extended height,
14ft.; increasing by Ift. to 16ft. height
closed, fully extended height 30ft.
Longer lengths if required.
Extended
