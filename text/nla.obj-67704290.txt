PROSPECTUS
OF THE
OUSE pCHOOL,
ERIN STREET, RICHMOND.
EIGH HOUSE, situated on a rising ground, almost
in the centre of an enclosure of about three acres,
commands an extensive view of East Melbourne,
Studley Park, and surrounding country; has large and well-
ventilated Class-rooms, capable of accommodating an additional
number of pupils.
Ihe design of this School is to educate Girls so that they
may take their places in society as intelligent, useful, and
accomplished gentlewomen. Also to train Teachers in the best
method of imparting instruction.
Great attention is given to the moral culture and religious
instruction of the scholars. The work of each day commences
with praise, prayer, and Bible reading, regardless of denomina-
tional distinctions; but in the case of those whose parents
object, there is no compulsion.
One uniform system pervades the whole School, so as to
enable pupils to pass easily from class to class, without any
change in the method of instruction pursued.


A L
fh;gai|uatiiJi|,
There are four Departments, viz.: Initiatory, Juvenile, Senior,
Advanced, and Teachers in training.
INITIATORY DEPARTMENT
(under a careful governess.)
This Department is intended for children under seven.
Besides being grounded in the elements of Reading and Writing,
much instruction is communicated orally, and embraces, in
addition to the regular reading lesson, Lessons on Objects,
simple points of Science, and general information. All pupils
are taught vocal Music and Sewing.
JUVENILE DEPARTMENT
(under a trained governess.)
Pupils, on entering, will commence at the stage they had
reached in the Initiatory Department. The branches taught are
Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, History, Geography,
Spelling, Derivation, Dictation on slates and paper, Drawing,
Vocal Music, and Sewing. Text Books: Nelson?s Series,
Collier?s Histories, Coutie?s Word Expositor, Smith?s Geogra-
phy, National Arithmetic, Morrell?s Grammar (Part I.).


SENIOR DEPARTMENT
(under an efficient, experienced, first-class governess.)
The course of study in this Department is graduated, so
that pupils entering from the Juvenile Classes may have their
education carried on naturally and gradually to any length that
may be desired.
Section A. ?This Section?s work is a continuation of that
in the Juvenile Department, with the addition of Etymology,
Easy Analysis, Composition, and Map Drawing. Text Books:
Nelson?s Advanced Reader, Collier?s Histories, Morrell?s Gram-
mar and Exercises, Cornwall?s Geography, Cornwall?s Young
Composer, Mayo?s Object Lessons (on the Pestalozzian prin-
ciple), Zoology by Gosse.
Section B. ?In this Section as much time as possible is
given to History, Geography, Grammar, and Composition.
Pupils are required to prepare questions, in order to give
expression to their views?a plan which has been found to work
admirably; it stimulates the indolent and checks the impetuous.
A short essay is written every week, upon a subject selected by
the teacher, and commented upon, the class meanwhile taking
notes. Physical Geography and Morrell?s Analysis form im-
portant parts of class work. Object Lessons, given on consecu-
tive subjects, are revised at the end of the course by means of a
lecture. Text Books : Advanced Reader, Smith?s and Collier?s
Histories, Cornwell?s Geography, Morrell?s Analysis, Com-
poser by Dalgleish, Introduction to the Sciences (Chambers),
Zoology by Gosse, Chambers? Arithmetic, Spelling Superseded
by Sullivan.


Advanced Class, to prepare for Matriculation, Civil Service,
and Teachers in training, under one of the first Masters, a
B.A. of the University.
From the Senior Department, pupils may proceed with the
subjects required for Matriculation and Civil Service Examina-
tions. To this Class much of the Principal?s time is devoted,
in addition to the Master?s instruction. Text Books: Those
required for the various Examinations. In special cases, young
ladies may qualify themselves for the Examination of the
Educational Department, Currie?s and Morrison?s School
Management.
Drawing.-?The Classes meet on three afternoons of
each week, under the immediate superintendence of the Prin-
cipal, a special advantage to those who wish to cultivate an art
so refining to the taste. Landscapes, Figures, Flowers, Etch-
ings in Crayons, Water Colouring, Painting in Oil, and Lessons
from Objects.
Writing.?The same system of gradation is carried out
in this as in other branches, and is taught in the most efficient
manner.
Arithmetic. ?There is a separate classification for
Arithmetic. All pupils have frequent exercises in Mental
Arithmetic.
Latin is taught by the Principal and a Master. French
by a Parisian Master. Text Books: Grammar and Exercises
by Noel and Chapsal; Grammaire de Grammaires by Fivas,
&c. Also, various first-class Reading Books.
Dancing and Calisthenics under the careful teaching
of a Professional.


Half-Yearly Examinations, extending over at least
a week, are held. All answers are given in writing, without
books, notes, or any other kind of assistance. A daily register
of the pupils? work is kept, showing the highest number of
marks gained, as well as the lowest, in each branch.
Parents and all interested in the education of Young Ladies
are respectfully requested to visit the School during teaching
hours, as personal inspection alone can give a correct idea of
the system and course of study, the progress and position of
the pupils, the duties to be performed in School, and the lessons
to be prepared at home. Were parents really aware of the
beneficial results produced by their occasional presence in the
Class-room, an hour spent there would become the rule, not
the exception. The usual work can be done in the presence of
visitors, consequently they can see what is to do, and how it
ought to be done; thereby misconceptions are removed, alleged
grievances calmly and easily investigated and explained, and
both teachers and pupils encouraged to perform their duty
faithfully and with pleasure.

Argus for December 18, 1873.
? The pupils of Mrs. Wigmore?s Leigh House School for Young Ladies,
Bridge-road, Richmond, signalised last night the end of their labours for this
year by means of a concert in the schoolroom, at which a number of their
friends were present. The programme consisted of pianoforte selections,
relieved occasionally by singing. Some of the young ladies displayed very
genuine talent, and notably so in connection with the names of Miss
Wigmore, Miss Adair, Miss J. Wigmore, Miss Sheffield, and Miss Raymond.
The performance of Beethoven?s Twelfth Sonata was most creditable to Miss
Wigmore and Miss Adair. We remember to have seen the chief of this
school with her pupils, more than once, at the Goddard concerts; and the
influence of that great artist?s example on the performance, by these young
ladies, of the above-named sonata, could be easily detected in the spirited
treatment it met with at their hands.?
Age for December 18, 1873.
? The session at Leigh House Ladies? School, Richmond, was last night
brought to a close by a soiree musicale , at which the Misses W igmore
and the pupils were the sole performers. A large assemblage of parents
and friends enjoyed the somewhat lengthy programme, and evinced their
hearty satisfaction with several of the pieces. Beethoven?s Sonata No. 12,
played by Miss Wigmore and one of the pupils, was a high-class perform-
ance; and the ?Gloria,? from Mozart?s Twelfth Mass, by six pair of little
hands (these being quite the juveniles of the school), was played with a
precision and effect that reflects the highest credit on the Principal of the
Seminary and her daughters.?


Preparatory J3 chool
YOUNG GENTLEMEN.
Mrs. WIGMORE has now arranged (simply for the con-
venience of families whose daughters attend Leigh House
School) to have a Class-room, with a separate entrance and
enclosed playground, for the exclusive use of Young Gentlemen
from five to seven years of age.
This branch of the School will be under the careful super-
vision of a motherly lady of great experience.
Course of Instruction, similar to that pursued in the
Girls? Junior Department. Particular attention paid to Arith-
metic and Writing. Text Books: Nelson?s Series, Collier?s
Histories, Barnard Smith?s Arithmetic, Word Expositor, and
Smith?s Geography, Smith?s Latin Primer, &c.
