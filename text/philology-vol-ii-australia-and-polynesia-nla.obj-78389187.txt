PAPUAN LANGUAGES.
The only Papuan Languages, for the knowledge
of which materials, beyond scanty Vocabularies,
are as yet available, are those of the two adjoining
groups of islands, the Loyalty Islands and the
New Hebrides.
Books have been published in four of these
languages, viz., in those spoken on two of the
Loyalty Islands, Nengone and Lifu, and in two
of the New Hebrides, Aneiteum and Tana.
Important results are to be expected from a comparison
of these Papuan languages with other members of the
Polynesian Family of Languages ; but a discussion of
such questions must at present be deferred. The com-
piler of this part of the Catalogue may, however, be
allowed to state, as the general result of his researches,
the conviction that, however different in Vocabulary the
Papuan languages are from the other Polynesian dialects,
the grammatical structure of the Polynesian and Papuan
Languages is evidently founded on the same basis. Of
all the Polynesian Languages, the Fiji is that which
shows the nearest approach to the Papuan Languages.
It is not improbable that the Papuan languages form
the connecting link between the Polynesian Family of
Languages and the African Division of Prefix-Prono-
minal Languages.

I. LOYALTY ISLANDS.
The Loyalty Group consists of the two large
Islands of Lifu, estimated at about one hundred
miles in circumference, and Nengone or Mare ,
estimated at sixty miles in circumference, besides
the smaller Islands of Uea , Doha, and Dodoni ,
and a few still smaller Islands.
Lifu contains a population estimated at 15,000 souls, Nengone a
population estimated at 7,000 souls, Uea a population estimated at
about 1,800 souls, Doha a population of 150 souls. The Island of
Dodoni is uninhabited, but is covered with cocoa nut and bread fruit
trees, and is occasionally visited by the natives of the other Islands,
who collect the fruit of these trees.
The inhabitants of Nengone are a Papuan race, and
speak a Papuan dialect, common to the whole Island.
The inhabitants of Lifu are also a Papuan race, and
speak a Papuan dialect, but different from that of the
Island of Nengone, ?and it is possible that two dialects
are spoken on the Island of Lifu.
The inhabitants of Doha are a Papuan race, and speak
the dialect of the Island of Nengone, which lies close to
them.
The inhabitants of Uea are a Polynesian race. They
were originally a colony from Uea or Wallis 1 Island, who
gave its name to their present abode, either destroying or
absorbing into their own race the original inhabitants.
They speak a Polynesian language, although they shew
their mixed descent by having only retained the first five
numerals of their Polynesian ancestors, and discontinued
the use of all the superior numerals, adopting instead
thereof the quintal arrangement of the Papuan races.

teurn, 3. Erumango, 4. Fate or Sandwich Island,
5. Malicola, 6. L'Espiritu Santo, 7. Futuna,
8. Niua .
The languages spoken at Futuma and Niua are nearly
identical, and are closely allied to the languages of
Rarotonga or Samoa.
Those spoken at Tana, Aneiteum, Erumango A Malicola,
belong to the Papuan division of languages.
In at least some parts of Fate or Sandwich Island, a
Polynesian dialect is spoken.
The inhabitants of the whole group are, by a careful estimate, stated
at 40,000.
They belong to the Papuan or Negrito race, and have curly or woolly
hair. They are of the middle size.
They all cultivate the soil, in some places largely. Their food consists
of fruits and vegetables, fish, fowls, pigs, and insects.
They are cannibals, and are constantly engaged in war.
They have an order of Priesthood, and regard as sacred certain
figures and stones. The institution of the Tapu is in force in all the
Islands.
They are fond of music, and use a drum and a long pipe or flute
They sing well, and in parts.
