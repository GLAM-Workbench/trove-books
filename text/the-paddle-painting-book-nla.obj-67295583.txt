SHOES
For shoes that fit and shoes that wear.
For shoes that give your feet good care,
PADDLE is the brand to choose
The Brand that means the best of shoes.
There's BABY MOCCS for walkers small;
Shoes for short girls, shoes for tall;
And for boys both strong and rough,
PADDLE shoes are smart and tough.
Teenage girls adorn their feet
In PADDLE JAUNTIES, gay and neat.
For days of leisure, free of care,
PIRATES are the shoes they wear.
In every shoe shop, hear the mothers
Say "PADDLE for Preference, we don't
want others".
J
PADDLE for wear and value best
Of children's shoes ?they're proved by
test.
