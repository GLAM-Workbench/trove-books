I
FROM ELOPEMENT TO ENLISTMENT.
THE first time I remember catching
sight of Henare Tikitami was when
he was acting as referee at a dog-
fight in a Maori village in the Waikato
district.
The dog-fight was no concern of mine.
I was just riding
past when my
attention was
drawn to Henare.
He Was endea-
vouring to see
fair play for both
the combatants.
He was very ex-
cited over the
affair because another Maori, named Wi-
remu, was hampering one dog by pulling
his tail.


After fruitlessly yelling at Wiremu for
some time in classical Maori, Henare sud-
denly relapsed into pidgin-English, and
fired this volley at him: “Py cripes, you
te ploomin’ ole taurekareka, —tinkin’ fish —
all right. You no good for te fight. More
better your ole woman drown you in te hot
mud hole when you te piccanini. Gar ! ”
Then they flew into each other’s arms
and settled it that way. The dogs looked
up in surprise, retired to a safe distance,
and watched the proceedings, giving an
occasional bark of encouragement.
Henare won. He deserved to, for he
was a clean fighter and a true sport.
This event happened about two years
before the Great War broke out, when
Henare was eighteen. So it was not sur-
prising that he should have been one of
the first of the Waikato tribe to volunteer
for service at the front, when he had
reached twenty-three.
But he had his difficulties. You see


he had a sweetheart named Kiri, a fine
Maori maiden of twenty; and Wiremu
wanted her. Henare and Kiri had been
sweethearts from early school-days, and
they rather laughed
at Wiremu’s aspira-
tions. But if Henare
went to the war, it
might be different.
During their moon-
light rambles along
the banks of the dark
and silent Waikato
river, Henare and Kiri
talked the matter over.
He said he would enlist if they could be
secretly married first. He said he would feel
more settled, and more disposed to fight, as
his forefathers fought of old, inspired by
the love and admiration of his wahine.
Kiri was undecided. The war might
be long; the distance to France was great;
the dangers and risks were many.


Hen are naively chaffed her by saying
that he might pick up an American heiress
away over in Paris if she did not marry
him before he enlisted. That settled it.
Before they left the shade of a beautiful
pohutukawa one charming summer’s even-
ing they fixed the day and made their
plans—talking to one another in soft and
musical Maori.
“ You will be true to your absent war-
rior as he fights beside his Pakeha brothers,
adding fresh glories to the honour of the
noble Maori race ? ”
“ Yes, my brave Tikitanu. Your Kiri
will be with you in heart and spirit day
and night until your return to the fair land
which holds in its bosom the bodies of our
noble heroes of days gone by.”
A few gentle and poetic words like
these made them both feel rather senti-
mental and emotional, so they solemnly
rubbed noses and went back to the kianga.
These two dusky lovers decided on a


secret marriage at Ngaruawahia in a fort-
night’s time. Kiri was to go by road to the
place, and Henare by train from Mercer.
The appointed day dawned bright and
fine, and Kiri arrived at Ngaruawahia in
proper style half-an-hour late. But there
was no sign of Henare.
As a matter of fact he did not turn up
at all, for he got a bit excited at
Mercer, and as there were two
trains standing end to end at the
station he entered the wrong carriage and
got out at Pukekohe, about thirty or forty
miles in the wrong direction.
They met again in about two days’
time, and after a good deal of both tender
and violent Maori talk, sprinkled with
pidgin-English, the matter was patched up.
However, they dropped the elopement
idea, rubbed noses duly and canonically,
and Henare went off and enlisted as
a soldier of the King. But he was anxious
about his old enemy Wiremu.


II.
OFF TO THE WAR.
THE relatives of Henare and Kiri were
very proud of Henare in his new
uniform, and they told him that he
must prove himself worthy of the hand of
Kiri, the Maori princess, and grand-
daughter of a great warrior chief.
Henare looked at himself in the glass
and felt that he was worthy of her, or any
other princess, already. He did not want
to seem too cheap, because there was
Wiremu to be reckoned with.
He enjoyed the camp life, the drills
and parades, and entered into soldiering
with as much ease and good will, as if he
had been born to it.
The general opinion of the officers was
that Tiki (or “ Dickie ” as they nick-named
him) would give a good account of himself
at the front.


It was a great day in Wellington when
the first batch of Maori volunteers em-
barked on the grey troopship. Henare
and his mates were bubbling over with fun
and excitement. The cheering crowds of
Pakehas and Maoris, the fluttering flags,
and the cheerful music of the bands, made
them all feel that they were off to a grand
old picnic. They laughed and joked, and
sang until they were hoarse.
A few hours later, however, things did
not look so bright. These Maori lads had
never been away from New Zealand before,
and it was sad to see their beloved land
sinking out of sight into the deep blue
ocean.
When the last trace had disappeared,
Henare, leaning over the vessel’s side, said
to Honi in a hoarse whisper : “ My korry,
Noo Zealan’ all gone now.” Honi replied
with affected cheerfulness : “ Nemine, he
jump up again bimeby,” and then walked
away.


All the boys tried to make out that
they were not seasick, and poked them-
selves away into all sorts of nooks and
corners to conceal the fact.
Henare thought that up in the rigging
would be a good place, but they soon
chased him out of that. He then leant
over the taffrail and mused of home and
Kiri.
A voyage to England in these days is
eventful for anyone, but it was very much
more so for the Maori boys.
When they had settled down to the
routine of life on a troopship, they became
keenly interested in it all and never had
a “ dull ” day.
The first port of call filled them with
much excitement and gratification—and
a thirst for further adventures.
Henare rather prided himself on his
letter-writing, and seized every oppor-
tunity to exercise his “ gift.” He disdained
to write in his native language, but pre


ferred “ te good Englan’ talk ” even when
writing to Maoris. At the first port he
posted several letters to friends in New
Zealand. One was to Kiri and another
was to Wiremu.
To Kiri he wrote, among other things :
“ I no forget about you yet, t’that
why I write t’this letter, tell you
no forget me. More better you
have te British soldier than te
frightened bloke like Wiremu stop-
pin’ away from te fight. T’this
ole troopship take us over te sea
all right, and when te war all over
he bring us back an’ t’then I marry
you pretty quick.”
To Wiremu he wrote: —
“ Py cripes, you look out when I come
back if you talk too much wid te
Kiri. She no belong to you. She
my wahine all right. No good yer
trick, you better come to te war ;
no stop home spoilin’ te dog fight


and try take another feller gel
when him away in S her many. Me
te crack shot now so you look out.”
After a voyage of nine weeks without
serious mishap the Maoris landed in Eng-
land “ All well,” and ready for the Huns.


III.
THE LITTLE FRENCH NURSE.
IT was not very long before the Maori
boys, who had gone straight to old
England, were drafted across to
France, and they were soon in the thick
of the Great War, fighting for all they were
worth.
Henare was well to the fore, and it
was often remarked that he would soon
distinguish himself or know the reason
why.
In fact, all the Maori boys were as
keen and fearless as any of their Pakeha
comrades, and made a deep impression on
all the officers and men about them—and
on the Germans in front of them too !
At every turn Henare proved himself
a wag, a wit, and a hero. He caused many
a hearty laugh by his quaint comments
on the Anglo-French gibberish, and the


churned up conditions of the country—
“ Py korry t’this country like te kramble
egg on tose.” He called the mixed-up
speech “ te half-caste langwidge.”
But everyone was cheerful and witty
on that battlefront —though sometimes
there was a grim lull in the fun ; just be-
fore a battle, and in the thick of it. The
wittiest men fought the most desperately,
but saved their wit for a pick-me-up after-
wards.
During an awful fight over shell-holes
and battered trenches, Henare was too
eager and daring, and
the result was a bad
wound in the chest
by a fragment of shell.
He was unconscious
and bleeding profuse-
ly when picked up by
the Red Cross men,
so, after first aid, he
was conveyed with all speed to the base
hospital. He soon became delirious and


was not expected to recover.
One night about twelve o’clock he
opened his eyes and glared at an attendant
standing near his bunk. Then, without
a moment’s warning, he sprang up and
grabbed the attendant by the throat yell-
ing at the top of his voice, “ Py Hori, you
bally ole nigger Wiremu, I catch you t’this
time.” With some trouble he was put
back to bed again, and relapsed into un-
consciousness.
The next time he awoke, a pretty little
French nurse, Marie Bouvard, was sitting
by and watching him.
She was just a slim little
thing, more like a girl of
seventeen than a woman
of twenty-one. She
was a born nurse, her
very presence always
did the sufferers good.
Her voice was soft and
healing, her touch was
gentle and sympathetic,


and her footsteps were like the falling of
the snow.
When Marie smiled she was at her
best, for her solemn little face brightened
up like a sudden burst of sunshine on the
fioAvers.
Hen are watched her calmly for some
time without moving, then he closed his
eyes, and the man in the next bed heard
him murmur, —
“Py . . . korry, Py . . korry,
I tink I got to Heaven at lars ....
t’that the angel face all right . . . you
bet.”
It is not surprising that under the care
of a nurse like the little French Marie, the
Maori hero gradually recovered. When
he had reached a certain stage of recovery,
lie did not appear to be particularly anxious
to progress any further. Most of Marie’s
patients felt like that. It meant parting


with the charming little nurse, and they
dreaded it.
Henare was no exception, though,
be it said, Kiri was never far from his
thoughts. But Marie simply fascinated
him, and really the nurse herself became
very much attached to the noble brown
boy from England’s far off Maoriland. He
had been such a splendid patient, and such
a grand “ case ” too.
As time went on, during Henare’s con-
valescence, he and Marie became at least
very good friends, and always enjoyed one
another’s company, and whatever conver-
sation it was possible for them to have,
with Anglo-French and pidgin-Maori as
the medium.
In the middle of this pretty romance,
Henare got a letter from Kiri, and it had
a steadying effect upon his emotions. For
patriotic reasons it was written in pidgin-
Maori. Partly it ran, —


“ I hope you no get kill too quick yet.
Wiremu no good for me, he te shirker
bloke. T’that why I want you come
back without te shot. Wiremu tell
my mother all te Parani gell want
to marry te Maori soldier. No you
get up to that trick with me.
Good-bye, come back quick when
you beat te Sherman. I wait.”

IV.
A CHAT WITH THE NURSE.
SEATED cosily in an easy chair, with
Marie near by at work on some
bandages, Henare was listening most
attentively to her efforts to tell him some
of the dreadful sufferings of France in the
early days of the war.
It took him all his time to make out
what she said. The scene was a sadly
busy one. There were several interrup-
tions, many were coming and going all the
time. Fresh batches of broken and groan-
ing men were being brought in every hour;
and restored men were taking farewell of
nurses and friends before returning to the
slaughter.
The cannon-boom could be distinctly
heard day and night, but it disturbed no
one at the hospital, for they had grown
accustomed to it.


All the while Marie was talking, in
the midst of this strange sad scene, the
irregular punctuation kept on.
800m —boom ....b00m....
boom —boom—boom.
With many a shrug of the shoulders,
and many a shake of her pretty head,
Marie related to Henare all she dared of
the brutal and revolting conduct of the
Germans when first they swept over the
border. She told him of the coarseness,
the drunkenness, and the bullying of all
ranks and grades of the invading Huns.
Every now and again Henare ground
his teeth, and muttered “Py cripes; I pay
him out,” and “Te taipo, te bally taipo.”
When he heard as much as he could stand,
he ventured the remark, “ I tink the
Sherman soldier no hurt te gell and te
woman, eh ?”
Marie looked at him a moment, and
then said, “ What you say, M’sieur ?”


“ I say te ole brute no hurt te wahine
an’ te piccanini—te woman an’ te gell”—
he answered slowly.
“Oh dear me,” said Marie in real
surprise, “ did you nefar read ze news-
paper ? ”
“Oh, my korry,” he replied, “I can’t
read te Prenchy langwidge, all te word
spell wrong, and te talk all silly.
“ No, no, no, M’sieur, ze French
speech ees ze most beauteeful in all ze
land.”
“ Werra, where te Maori come in ? ”
“Ah!”
“ Eh?”
When left to himself the manly Maori
boy pictured up the whole scene as well
as he could, and longed to get back to the
trench—or over the parapet —to pay out
the demons who had outraged Marie’s
noble people. He was getting well unusu-
ally quickly, and though loth to leave the


charmed spot, he felt that he would soon
be fit to fight again. He was busy think-
ing out all kinds of plans for getting even
with the Huns; and he formed a mental
picture of the
Kaiser which was
not very compli-
mentary to that
potentate. Hen are
saw him as a big
villian with short,
sharp horns above
his ears, to match
his upturned
moustache; small
wicked eyes, and
a big mouth, with
little tusks pro-
truding.
This image was very vivid to Henare’s
native imagination, and he muttered to
himself, “Py cripes, that him all right; he
just want te cow feet and te monkey tail,
then he te ole taipo, straight.”


A week after his chat with the little
French nurse, Henare was passed as fit
for service again. He had made many
friends, both French and English, around
the hospital; so on the day of his
departure he hunted up each one and
solemnly shook hands and said “ good-
bye.” He came to Marie last of all. She
was standing just outside the big, sunlit
doorway, watching the far off train of wag-
gons slowly bringing in another batch of
wounded men. Her sweet little Frenchy
face looked dreadfully serious—but she
turned round with that sunny smile of
her’s when Henare spoke.
He shuffled nervously, gave a funny
little cough, that he ought to have been
ashamed of as a “ Maori brave,” then held
out his hand and said, “ So long, Marie, I
go back now. My korry, you make me
get well too quick.”
She put her head picturesquely on one
side, took hold of the brown hand held out


to her, and said, “An revoir, Henri; I
hope you weel be vera safe.”
Henare felt queer. Sensations passed
all over him that he had never known
before. The impulse was to pick up this
lovely French doll and run right away
with it. But he pulled himself up and
said, “ Py cripes, I better go, I tink,” and
he bolted.
On the way back to the lines a New
Zealander was chaffing Henare about
Marie, and asking him whether he was
going to hand over Kiri to Wiremu.
“No ploomin fear,” he replied, “ Not
me.”
“ What about Marie, then ? ”
Henare stopped short and said—
“ I tell you bout that, mate. I like to
have Marie just for te pretty doll. She te
beauty, py cripes, yeh. When she put te
head on one side an smile, she mak me
feel wery funny on te shest, t’that all! ”


V.
A LETTER TO THE KAISER.
"T JEY boss, what te name of t’ place
X where te Kaiser stop ? ”
“ Potsdam.”
“Eh ? No fear ! T’that te bally
swear word.”
“ No it’s not, Dicky ; that’s the place
all right.”
“ Oh, py korry, I no like to put t’that
on te letter; te gell in te Post Oppis might
see him.”
The officer whom Henare addressed
laughed heartily, and said —
“ Your compunction is evidently due
to the refining influence of Nurse Bouvard,
eh?”
“Oh, go on, you got te rat,” he replied.


When he was quite convinced about
the Kaiser’s address, Henare proceeded to
make use of his “gift” at letter-writing
for an attack on him by post.
To Kaiser Pilly,
Potdam.
I been come all te way from Noo
Zeelan to fight te Sherman soldier in
Parani and make him clear outer t’this
country. When I come here some feller
been tell me all about t’that dirty trick
all te Sherman been up to in Parani an
Peljimi. No good you say t’that all gam-
mon, it te true talk all right. What te
taipo you want to make te wery big fight
for ? More better you keep your ole
Sherman soldier in Shermany—t’that te
place for him. Py cat, he not fit for go any

Py cripes, you te wery bad ole man
make all te fight for nothing. You goin to

What te good of t’that silly bloke you

right. Py cripes, you goin ter get it
straight for the start this wery bad war.
You better hurry up quick an get sorry,
plenty more Maori boy in Noo Zeelan
gettin ready to come an fight.
HENARE TIKITANU.


Henare took great pains to write what
he felt was a very convincing ultimatum —
and, after much scratching out and alter-
ing, he sealed the letter and gave it to an
airman to drop behind the German lines.
The censor passed it with a merry laugh.


VI.
A PRISONER.
IT was a great relief to Henare’s
troubled mind to get his letter to
the Kaiser written, and sent off by
its famous postman; in his native sim-
plicity he felt that he had dealt the
German Emperor a blow from which
that old Fritz would not quickly recover.
He had told him as plainly as possible
what a Maori soldier thought of him, and
that of course would affect the Kaiser’s
“morale”
The incident also got him talked
about, until his resourcefulness and
bravery came under the notice of the
authorities, with the result that Henare
was made a Corporal; which fact he duly
mentioned in a postscript to some of his
letters—with pardonable pride.
He now became more zealous and
daring than ever, making quite a business


of the war. He was turning out to be one
of the best soldiers in the British line; an
encouragement and inspiration to all about
him.
But his zeal and daring often nearly
cost him his life, and eventually cost him
his liberty. It happened during a most un-
expected gas attack. Henare lingered too
long, was overcome by the poisonous
fumes, and was taken prisoner by the
Germans.
He was not badly gassed, so when
he recovered enough to walk about he
wanted to fight one of the guards, but a
London Tommy restrained him. Henare
appeared to be the first Maori prisoner
captured by the Germans, for they re-
garded him with a good deal of interest,
which he resented with expressions that
were wasted on his captors.
He soon chummed up with his fellow-
prisoner—the London Tommy, who urged
c


him to be less talkative, so as to avoid
trouble. But, as Henare could not indulge
in his favourite pastime of “ letter writ-
ing,” he persisted in talking to Tommy
about the war. He told him wonderful
stories about gigantic preparations on the
British front, and about the inexhaustible
resources of New Zealand.
Several of the sentries understood
English and Henare was listened to with
undisguised interest. Then he was sent
for, and taken between two guards to a
German officer, who was very affable to
Henare, and asked him several kindly and
interesting questions. Had he quite re-
covered from his unfortunate “gassing”?
Did he get enough to eat? Was it the
kind of food the Maoris were used to ? and
so on.
After this the officer told the guards
to withdraw twenty paces. He then
smiled at Henare and asked him, in broken
English, whether he would like plenty of


money and a certain amount of freedom
during his stay in Germany.
Henare grinned and said that would
be “ kapai.”
“Veil, you shust tell me some leedle
tings about der English.”
“ All right, I know plenty ting about
him. What yer want ter know ?”
“Ah ! dot is goot! Now tell me how
much damage der German bombs do on
London.”
“Wery bad, wery bad. Him brake
down te shop, te church, te school, and te
piccanini.”
“ Och ! anyting else ? ”
“ Yeh; kill te plenty ole woman too ;
my word yeh, te Zepp wery bad for ole
Englan.”
“ Haf England got much food ? ”


“ Not too many; only butter from Noo
Zeelan.”
The officer made a note of that, as a
most significant fact. He then asked :
“ How many soldiers vos coming from
New Zealand efery mont ?”
“ Oh, tousan an tousan. Not enuf
ship yet to bring him all.”
“How many Maoris vos der bein
trained ?”
“ Oh, bout two million, I tink.”
“ Gott in himmel! Are dey as big as
you?”
Henare grinned and said:
“ Oh, te Maori bigger ’n me. Me te
little bloke, all right. No room for te
big Maori on te ole troopship I came in.”
The German looked thoughtful, and a
bit suspicious.
“ Are you telling me der truth ? ”


Henare fixed his soft brown eyes on
the small blue-grey eyes of his questioner,
and said, with well-feigned indignation:
“ Oh, py korry, me te Sunday School
poy ; what for you tink me tell a lie ?”
“ Veil, I will ask you von more ques-
tion :
“ Vat do all dose big Maoris feed on?”
“ Oh, te Pakeha no let te Maori eat up
te prisoner now, so he eat te poaka.”
“ Vat is der poaka ?”
“Te pig, te Sher , I mean te Noo
Zeelan pig. But te Maori like te prisoner
more better.”
Although the German officer was not
at all satisfied with the result of his en-
quiries, he made up his mind to treat
Henare well, with the object of getting all
the information possible from him.


VII.
EARNING THE V.C.
WITH their usual lack of humour,
the Germans fondly imagined that
they would yet be able to get
some valuable information out of the
“ unsuspecting ” native of New Zealand ;
for he seemed so agreeable and talkative!
Little did those self-conceited Teutons
understand the Maoris!
This being so, Henare was allowed
a certain amount of liberty to ramble
about within a given area —well behind
the lines.
Two weeks after his capture a most
astounding thing happened—as if it had
been long cut and dried. During a semi-
bright moonlight night a British plane


made its appearance over the camp, and
was being duly shelled. Presently it
wavered like a wounded bird, then rapidly
descended to a spare piece of ground near
where Henare rambled. Hurrying towards
it he found that
it was not
“ wounded,” but
had alighted
for a minor but
necessary adjust-
ment. As Henare
approached, the
airman drew his
revolver, but the
Maori threw up
his arms and
cried out:
“ Hey! Don’t shoot! Me te Pritis
prisoner.”
“ Be the saints,” came the reply, “ Yez
don’t look much like a prisoner ! Phat the
mischief are yez doing here ?”


“ Py korry, yon better hurry up—all
te Sherman looking for you. I tink you
better take me up in te sky, too. I can
ride.”
With that they both jumped into the
plane, fixed the straps, and flew away.
Only just in time, however, for bullets and
shells soon began once more to liven things
up. The plane dived, and swooped, and
looped the loop until Henare thought his
woolly head would drop off. They then
had a safe run for an hour, but just as the
aeroplane was crossing the German lines
she was winged and had to descend in
No-Man’s-Land. Enemy searchlights soon
discovered where they landed, and shells
started to dance and sing all around them.
The two men left the machine just before
it was blown to pieces. They hid for
awhile in a crater, until the welcome sound
of a tank was heard. Presently she was
seen lumbering along in the moonlight.
Henare and the Irish airman made for her


with all haste, waving their caps. The
tank lurched towards them suspectingly,
and then came to a standstill.
When the back door opened a voice
called out:
“ Weel naw, an’ who might ye be ? ”
The Irishman answered:
“ We’re just lookin’ for a bhuss to
carry us back to the loines.”


“ This wee cabby is no takin’ passen-
gers, but maybe ye can squeeze in—for its
rough walkin’ here.”
They had not travelled—or lumbered —
far when the old tank tumbled headfirst
into a deep shell-hole. With difficulty they
all crawled out and had a good look at the
undignified position of H.M. L.S. with her
nose fast in the mud.
Each one of them said a few simple
words suitable to the occasion. Henare’s
contribution was—“ Py cripes ! she can
buck worse’n te wild Maori boss.”
There was nothing for it now but to
walk. The enemy shelling became so
fierce that the wanderers separated and
dodged along—each man for himself —
hiding here and there, and sheltering from
time to time in large craters.
Dead and dying men were lying
about in all directions—giving evidence


of recent heavy fighting. When Henare
realized this, he forgot his own danger
and set to work carrying wounded men —
British and German —to the shelter of a
crater.
Searchlights were on him nearly all
the time, while bullets whistled past him
and shells ploughed up the ground. He
still pegged away at his noble work, until
a bullet found him as
he was bringing in
his twentieth man —
an English Captain.
He had just managed
to roll into the crater
with his burden and
then collapsed. The
Red Cross picked
them all up the next
afternoon.
Henare was in the hospital when
he came to. He was staring wildly


at the man in the next cot —a big,
brown man, bandaged, but grinning away
cheerfully.
Yes I it was Wiremu all right. He
had finally enlisted and the military train-
ing had made a man of him. In a desperate
battle Wiremu was badly wounded, and
was one of the first men that Henare had
carried to the crater.
When Henare had got over the
shock of meeting Wiremu, he asked after
Kiri.
“ Oh, she all right Henare, when I left
Noo Zealan. She no forget you. She te
brick.”


And so, far into the night, the gentle
murmur of musical Maori was heard as
these two wounded heroes discussed the
war, and old time quarrels, and Kiri’s
loyalty to Henare, and also the good times
they themselves would have together in
New Zealand, when the war was won.


VIII.
HOME AGAIN!
IT was a very happy Maori soldier who
was in London a month later, prepar-
ing to go before the King and receive
the noble and much-coveted badge of V.O.
When Henare left the kindly French
hospital, Wiremu was getting over his
wound, —more quickly than he wished, for
he had completely fallen in love with Nurse
Marie, and was using all the arts and
devices known to the civilized Maori, to
win the affections of that charming little
angel of mercy.
As for Henare himself, he was not
again passed for active service, but
received orders to return to New Zealand,
after he had obtained the highest badge of
honour at the hands of the King.


On the day fixed for the ceremony he
was all excitement. He put his things on
wrong, and had to take them off again;
lost belongings, and wanted to fight those
that he suspected of taking them.
But the most confusing time was
when they were telling him how to behave
at the ceremony and in the presence of
His Majesty. He couldn’t remember for
five minutes what he had to say and do.
At last he said to the officer instruct-
ing him —
“ Py korry, mate, I gettin* too shaky.
More better you get te Wikitoria Cross an
bring him to me—an I get home quick.”
" That would never do, my boy; half
the honour is having the medal pinned on
by the King himself.”
“My wurra, I tink you right. We
better go now; King Hori he get too tire
waitin’ for us,”


Though still weak, Henare had lost all
his nervousness when they arrived at
Buckingham Palace grounds. He watched
everything with the keenest interest, and
did not hesitate to quaintly express his
opinion about anything that took his fancy.
The officers felt a bit anxious when
Henare showed
signs of talkative-
ness as the King
was pinning the
V.O. on his breast,
but they could see
by His Majesty’s
pleasant smile that
no harm was being
done. No one could
help smiling when
Henare remarked to the King—
"Py cripes, you got te wery fine
whare here.”
Anyhow, the impressive ceremony
passed off without a hitch, and Corporal


Tikitanu, Y.C., looked every inch a British
soldier and hero —admired of all.
The very next thing to be considered
was “ New Zealand” with all speed.
At last, after an absence of nearly
twelve months, into which were crammed
the experiences and feelings of years, the
Maori brave returned to his native land,
bringing with him the fame and the
honours he had so nobly won.
The wildest enthusiasm prevailed at
the reception in Henare’s native village.
Maori and Pakeha customs and phrases
followed one another in quick succession
in the eager desire to express a joyous
welcome.
“ Haeremai’s” were shouted at the
returned soldier boy from every quarter
of the crowd; vigorous nose rubbing
threatened to become serious, until it was
relieved by the more European ceremony


of carrying the hero shoulder high through
the excited crowd. When they reached
a flag-bedecked platform, Maori orators
poured forth a flood of poetic welcome,
until the women broke down and wailed
their solemn tangi.
As Henare stood up to reply the
ground shook with the hakas and feet
stamping. It was a real ovation that the
loyal brown-boy received.
For the sake of the distinguished
Pakehas present, Henare spoke in pidgin-
English. He had often heard about the
great Lord Kitchener, so he began by
saying:
“ Te Pritis soldier no talk too much.
He te man of the do things, not t’talk it.
T’that why I no got too much for te
speech.”
He then thanked them all very warmly
for the kind and unexpected welcome they


had tendered him, and concluded with
this:
“ Any bloke here want te nice soft
job, no good for him go to te Sherman
war; more better him stop home wid te
mudder. But if all you big fat feller want
to be te MAN and te decent bloke, get
outer Noo Zeelan quick and help all your
mate lick up te Sherman.”
Kiri, his faithful Maori
maiden, was foremost
among those who wel-
comed him home ; and
the Rev. Honi Maki
celebrated their happy
wedding a week later.
Bearing on his body
the honourable scars
of war, and on his
breast the King’s acknowledgment of
his bravery and loyalty, Henare spent
his days going in and out among the
Waikatos and neighbouring tribes, telling


them thrilling tales of Britain’s might
and honour; and showing them the
terrible need there is for Pakeha and
Maori alike to do and dare —for the
sake of Britannia, the friend of Justice and
Liberty.
