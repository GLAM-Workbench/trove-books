WORKERS OF THE WORLD, AWAKEN,
Joe Hill.
Workers of the world, awaken!
Break your chains, demand your rights;
All the wealth you make is taken
exploiting parasites.
Shall you kneel in deep submission
From your cradles to your graves?
Is the height of your ambition
To be good and willing slaves?
Chorus:
Arise, ye prisoners of starvation!
Fight for your own emancipation;
Arise, ye slaves of every nation!
In One Union grand.
Our little ones for bread are crying.
And millions are from hunger dying;
The means the end is justifying,
'Tis the final stand.
Join the Union, fellow-workers.
Men and women, side by side;
We will crush the greedy shirkers
Like a sweeping, surging tide;
For united we are standing.
But divided we will fall;
Let this be our understanding—
" All for one and one for all.”


THE RED FLAG.
(By James O’Connell.)
The workers’ flag is deepest red.
It shrouded oft our martyred dead;
And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold
Their life blood dyed its every fold.
Chorus:
Then raise the scarlet standard high.
Beneath its folds ,we’ll live and die,
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer.
We’ll keep the red flag flying here.
Look ’round, the Frenchman loves its blaze,
The sturdy German chants its praise:
In Moscow’s vaults its hymns are sung,
Chicago swells in surging song.
It waved above our infant might.
When all ahead seemed dark as night;
It witnessed many a deed and vow.
We will not change its colour now.
It suits to-day, the meek and base,
Whose minds are fixed on pelf and place,
To cringe beneath the rich man’s frown,
And haul that sacred emblem down.
With heads uncovered, swear we all
To bear it onward till we fall;
Come dungeons dark, or gallows grim,
This song shall be our parting hymn!


THE INTERNATIONALE.
(By Eugene Potter).
(Translated by Charles H. Kerr.)
Arise, ye prisoners of starvation!
Arise, ye wretched of the earth.
For justice thunders condemnation,
A better world’s in birth.
No more tradition’s chains shall bind us,
Arise, ye slaves, no more in thrall!
The earth shall rise on new foundations.
We have been naught, we shall be all.
REFRAIN.
’Tis the final conflict,
Let each stand in his place,
The Industrial Union,
Shall be the human race.
We want no condescending saviors,
To raise us from a judgment hall;
We workers ask not their favors,
Let us consult for all:
To make the thief disgorge his booty,
To free the spirit from its cell,
We must, ourselves decide our duty.
We must decide and do it well.
The law oppresses us and tricks us,
Wage systems drain our blood:
The rich are free from obligations.
The laws the poor delude.
Too long we’ve languished in subjection,
Equality has other law?;
“No rights,” says she, “without their duties,
No claims on equals without cause.”


Behold them seated in their glory,
The kings of,mine and rail and soil!
What have you read in all their story,
But how they plundered toll?
Fruits of the workers’ toil are buried
In the strong coffers of a few;
In working for their restitution
The men will only ask their due.
Toilers from shops and fields united.
The union we of all who work;
The earth belongs to us, the workers,
No room here for the shirk.
How many on our flesh have fattened!
But if the noisome birds of prey
Shall vanish from the sky some morning,
The blessed sunlight still will stay.
Be ye, therefore, as wise as serpents and as gentle as
doves. Jesus.
Tho I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and
have not class consciousness, I am as sounding brass and
a tinkling cymbal. S. Paul.
The workers want to win disputes—not settle them.
Mick Sawtell.


THE WORKERS’ MARSEILLAISE.
Ye sons of toil, awake to glory!
Hark, hark, what myriads bid you rise;
Your children, wives and grandsires hoary—
Behold their tears and hear their cries!
Behold their tears and hear their cries!
Shall hateful tyrants mischief breeding.
With hireling hosts, a ruffian band —
Affright and desolate the land.
While peace and liberty lie bleeding!
CHORUS:
To arms! to arms! ye brave!
Th’ avenging sword unsheathe!
March on, march on, all hearts resolved
On Victory or Death.
With luxury and pride surrounded.
The vile, insatiable despots dare,
Their thirst for gold and power unbounded,
To mete and vend the light and air.
To mete and vend the light and air.
Like beasts of burden, would they load us,
Like gods would bid their slaves adore.
But Man is Man, and who is more?
Then shall they longer lash and goad us?
O, Liberty! can man resign thee?
Once having felt the generous flame,
Can dungeon’s bolts and bars confine thee
Or whips, thy noble spirit tame?
Or whips, thy noble spirit tame?
Too long the world has wept bewailing.
That Falsehood’s dagger tyrants wield;
But Freedom is our sword and shield;
And all their arts are unavailing!


HARVEST WAR SONG.
(By Pat Brennan.
(Tune: ‘‘Tipperary.’’)
We are coming home, John Farmer; we are coming back
to stay;
For nigh on fifty years or more we’ve gathered up your
hay.
We have slept out in your hayflelds, we have heard your
morning shout;
We’ve heard you wondering, where in hell’s them pesk.'
go-abouts?
CHORUS
It’s a long way, now understand me, it’s a long way to
town;
It’s a long way across the prairie, and to hell with Farmer
John;
Up goes machine or wages, and the hours must come
down;
For we’re out'for a winter’s stake this summer, and we
want no scabs around.
You’ve paid the going wages, that’s what kept us on the
bum.
You say, you’ve done your duty, you chin-whiskered son of
a gun;
W© have sent your kids to college, but still you must rave
and shout,
And call us tramps and hoboes, and pesky go-abouts.
But now the wintry breezes are a-shaking our poor frames,
And the long drawn days of hunger try to drive us boes
insane.
It is driving us to action —we are organised to-day;
Us, pesky tramps and hoboes, are coming back to stay.
Every worker should have an ambition to live to be a
healthy old man or woman, and hear the whistle blow for
the bosses to go to work.


A NEW SONG FOR THE GIRL SLAVES,
(Written for “Solidarity”)
“THERE IS A SHIRT FACTORY."
(Air: “There Is A Happy Land”).
There is a shirt factory.
Over the way,
Where eighty women slaves,
Toil all the day.
Oh', but they graft like hell.
What they feel like words won’t tell
Oh, how that room does smell
Words cannot say.
See when knock-off time comes,
They run away,
Down to the cook-shop near:
Each has a tray;
Goes home and heats a pie,
Then down on her bed she’ll lie:
Good wage-slaves never die.
They fade away.
No work on Saturday,
Hip. Hip, Hooray!
Each gets her washing done,
It takes all day;
Ge*s her rings from the Jews,
Darn; her stockings, gets the .blues,
Cooks tea and reads the “news” —
“Why girls go gay.”


There is a Union Hall
Not far away;
Some go to meetings there:
Hear what they say;
“Though -vve’ve been blind and dumb,
Solidarity will come;
We’ll put Piute on the run
Join up to-day.”
MENZIES.
In view of recent events, my advice to the I.W.W. in
South Africa is to steer clear of all flirtation with political
bodies, and come defeat or success, sunshine or storm,
propagate the principle of organisation on the ECONOMIC
field first, last, and always.
TOM GLYNN, Parramatta Jail.
THE TWELVE.
It now remains for those who cherish their class brothers
(as most of us do, claiming their possession and friendship
as dear as life itself), each to do our part in the endeavors
to snatch truth from the bastilles, to swing open the gates
that confine innocent men, to create those circumstances
that will compel the fairest and purest flowers our move-
ment has known to emerge from the inhuman, anti-somal
existence which is now their lot, into the atmosphere which
we all so much love in the radiating sunshine of nature,
and the beaming rays that encircle the affection and joys
of those who are dear to them.
Douglas Sinclair,


A DREAM.
Richard Brazier.
(Tune: "The Holy City”)
One day as I lay dreaming, this vision came to me:
I saw an army streaming Binging of liberty;
I marked these toilers passing by, I listened to their cry.
It was a triumphant anthem —an anthem filled with joy.
It was a triumphant anthem —an anthem filled with joy.
CHORUS:
One union, Industrial union;
Workers of the world unite,
To make us free from slavery,
And gain each man his right.
I saw the ruling classes watching this grand array,
Of marching, toiling masses passing on their way;
With pallid cheeks and trembling limbs they gazed upon
this throng,
And ever as they marched along the workers sang the
song;
And ever as they marched along the workers sang this
song:
Me thought I heard the workers call to that ruling band —
Come into our ranks, ye shirkers, for we now rule this
land,
Work or starve, the workers said, for you must earn your
bread;
Then into their ranks came the masters and joined the
workers song;
Then into their ranks came the masters and joined the
workers song:
A wise man must not obey the law too well. — R.
W. Emerson.


THE PREACHER AND THE SLAVE.
(Tune: “Sweet Bye and Bye.”)
(By J. Hill).
Long-haired preachers come out every night,
Try to tell you what’s wrong and what’s right
But when asked how ’bout something to eat.
They will answer with voices so sweet:
Chorus:
You will eat bye and bye,
In that glorious land above the sky;
Work and pray, live on hay,
You’ll get pie in the sky when yoti die.
And the starvation army they play,
And they sing and they clap and they pray,
Till they get all your coin on the drum.
Then they tell you when you’re on the bum:
Holy Rollers and jumpers came out,
And they holler, they jump, and they shout,
“Give your money to Christians,” they say,
“He will cure all diseases to-day.”
If you fight hard for children and wife—
Try to get something good in this life—
You’re a sinner and a bad man, they tell,
When you die you will sure go to hell.
Workingmen of all country’s, unite,
Side by side we for freedom will fight;
When the world and its wealth we do gain,
To the grafters we’ll sing this refrain:
Chorus:
You will eat, by and bye,
When you’ve learned how to cook and to fry,
Chop some wood, ’twill do you good.
And you’ll eat in the sweet bye and bye.


Bump Me Into Parliament.
(Written by Casey, of the One Big Union
League, Melbourne)
(Tune: Yankee Doodle).
Come listen, all kind friends of mine,
I want to move a motion,
To make an eldorado here,
I’ve got a bonzer notion.
Chorus:
Bump me into Parliament,
Bounce me any wa—y.
Bang me into Parliament,
On next election day.
Some very wealthy friends I know
Declare I am most clever.
While some may talk for an hour or so,
Why, I can talk for ever.
So bump, etc.
I know the Arbitration Act
As a sailor does his “riggins,”
So if you want a small advance
I’ll talk to Justice Higgins.
So bump, etc.
Oh, yes, I am a Labor man


And believe in revolution;
The quickest way to bring them on
Is talking constitution.
So bump, etc.
To keep the cost of living flown,
A law I straight would Utter,
A hundred loaves for a tray I’d sell,
With a penny a ton for butter.
So bump, etc.
I have been asked what would I do
I e’er the Germans came here,
A regulation I would make
To say they shan’t remain here.
So bump, etc.
They say that kids are getting scarce,
I believe there’s something in it;
By extra laws I’d incubate
A million kids a minute.
So bump, etc.
I’ve read my library ten times through,
And Wisdom justifies me.
The man who docs not vote for me,
By Gripes he crucifies me.
Now, Sinclair, he was fined five quid
For singing this here ditty,
Betsy was his witness there,
But the “Bobby” pooled the “Kitty.
So Bump ’em into Parliament,
Bounce ’em any way;
Bang ’em into Parliament,
Don’t let the Court decay.


HOLD THE FORT.
(English Transport Workers’ Strike Song.)
We meet to-day in Freedom’s cause,
And raise our voices high,
We’ll join our hands in union strong.
To battle or to die.
CHORUS:
Hold the fort for we are coming,
Union men be strong.
Side by side we battle onward,
Victory will come.
Look, my comrades, see the Union
Banners waving high,
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh.
See our numbers still Increasing,
Hear the bugle blow.
our union we shall triumph
Over every foe.
Fierce and long the battle rages,
But we will not fear,
Help will come whene’er it’s needed.
Cheer, my Comrades, cheer.
Scientific action is the only action that counts. Star-
vation tactics are and always were obsolete. To wield
their economic power scientifically the working class will
have to become scientifically organised. This is accom-
plished by possessing one big industrial union, based upon
a recognition of the class struggle, scientific in character,
revolutionary in purpose, and international in sentiment.
After this has been achieved, then, and not till then, will
solidarity be possible.—From the pamphlet “Solidarity,”
by Jack Hill, I.L.P.


MR. BLOCK.
Joe Hill.
(Air: ‘‘lt Looks To Me Like A Big Time To-Night").
Please give me your attention, I’ll introduce to you
A man that is a credit to “Our Red, White, and Blue”;
His head is made of lumber, and solid as a rock;
He is a common worker, and his name is Mr. Block.
And Block he thinks he may
Be Premier some day.
CHORUS:
Oh, Mr. Block, you were born by mistake,
You take the cake,
You make me ache.
Tie on a rock too your block, and then jump in the lake.
Kindly do that for Liberty’s sake.
Yes, Mr. Block, is lucky, he found a job, by gee!
The sharks got seven dollars, for job and fare and fee.
They shipped him to a desert and dumped him with his
But when he tried to find his job, he sure was out of luck.
He shouted, “That’s too raw.
I’ll fix them with the law.”
Block hiked back to the city, but wasn’t doing well,
He said, “I’ll join the union—the great A. F. of L.”
He got a job next morning, got fired in the night,
He said. “I’ll see Billy Hughes, and he’ll fix that foreman
right.”
Billy Hughes said, “You see,
You’ve got our sympathy.”
Election day he shouted, “A Socialist for Mayor!”
The “comrade” got elected, he happy was for fair,
But after the election, he got an awful shock,
A great big socialistic John did rap him on the block.


And Comrade Block did sob,
“I helped him to his job.”
The money kings in Cuba blew up the gunboat Maine,
But Block got awful angry and blamed it all on Spain.
He went right in the battle, and there he lost his leg,
And now he’s peddling shoestrings and is walking on a
He shouts, “Remember Maine,
Hurrah! To hell with Spain.”
Poor Block, he died one evening, I’m very glad to state,
He climbed the golden ladder up to the pearly gate.
He said, “Oh, Mr. Peter, one word I’d like to tell,
I’d like to meet the Astorbilts and John D. Rockefell.”
Old Peter said, “Is that so?”
viu i ctci oaiu, is uiat ou .
You’ll meet them down below.”
DONALD GRANT’S FAVORITE QUOTATION:
“MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN MAKES
COUNTLESS THOUSANDS MOURN.”
Bobby Burns.
When the world is at rest again, who knows but we
will look back upon all that has been an evil dream.
Men and women have always had to suffer for doing right,
and I have no regrets, for through suffering we come to
sunshine.
Life is great, and in the future we will live —to-day
we but exist.
Remembrances to all,
CHARLES REEVES.
Bathurst Gaol, July 13, 1918.
We speak the truth, and what care we,
For hissing and for scorn,
Whilst some faint gloamings we can see
Of Freedom’s coming morn.
—James R. Lowell.


THE ROAD TO EMANCIPATION.
Lone Wolf.
(Tune; “Tipperary.”)
Now, workingmen, you know you live a life of misery.
So join the union of your class, determined to be free.
Don’t let the master gouge your lives for many years to
come,
But organise upon the job and put him on the bum.
CHORUS:
It’s the road to Emancipation, it’s the right way to go;
For the toilers to run the nation, and the world both high
and low.
Kick in, and do your duty, for it’s up to you and me—
It’s the One Big Union* of the Workers that will bring
prosperity.
Don’t be a meek and lowly slave like lots of those you
meet,
Don’t be a servile scissorbill and like the bosses’ feet.
Don’t let them starve you off the earth, don’t fear their
prison cell,
Make your laws in the union hall—the rest can go to hell.
Labor is entitled to all it produces. An injury to one
is an injury to all.
All workers, “The Army of Production,” in One Big
Union, regardless of age, creed, color, or sex, is invincible.




SOLIDARITY FOREVER.
Ralph H. Chaplin.
Tune; ‘‘John Brown’s Body").
When the Union’s im-piration through the
worker’s blood shall run.
There can be no power greater anywhere be-
neath the sun.
Yet what force on earth is weaker than the
feeble strengrh of one ?
But the Union makes us strong.
CHORUS:
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
For the Union makes us strong.
Is there aught we hold in common with the
greedy parasite,
Who would lash us into serfdom and would
crush us with his might?
Is there anything left for us but to organise
and fight?
For the Union makes us strong.
It is we who plowed the prairies; built the
cities where they trade,
Dug the mines and built the workshops; end-
less miles of railroad laid.
Now rve stand, outcast and starving, mid the
wonders we have made.
But the Union makes us strong.
All the world that’s owned by idle drones is
ours and our alone.


We have laid the wide foundations; built it
skywards, stone by stone.
It is ours, and not to slave in, but to master
and to own.
While the Union makes us strong.
They have taken untold millions that they
never toiled to earn.
But without our brain and muscle not a single
wheel can turn,
We can break their haughty power; gain our
freedom when we learn.
That the Union makes us strang.
In our hands is placed a power 1 greater than
their hoarded gold;
Greater than the might of armies, magnified
a thousand fold,
We can bring to birth the new world from the
ashes of the old.
For the Union makes us strong.
THE WHITE SLAVE.
Joe Hill.
(Air: “Meet Me To-Night in Dreamland”).
One little girl, fair as a pearl,
Worked every day in a laundry;
All that she made for food she paid,
So she slept on a park bench so soundly;
An old procuress spied her there,
She came and whispered in her ear:
CHORUS:
Come with me now, my girlie.
Don’t sleep out in the cold,
Your face and tresses curly
Will bring you tame and gold.
Automobiles to ride in, diamonds and silks to wear,
You’ll be a star bright, down in the red light,
You’ll make your fortune there!


Same little girl, no more a pearl,
Walks all alone ’long the river.
Five years have flown, h6r health is gone,
She would look at the water and shiver..
Whene’er she’d stop to rest and sleep.
She’d hear a voice call from the deep:
CHORUS:
Girls in this way fall every day,
And have been falling for ages.
Who is to blame? You know his name,
It’s the boss that pays starvation wages.
A homeless girl can always hear
Temptations calling everywhere.
ARE YE WILLING TO WORK AND WAIT.
(Tune: “Three Times Round Went Our Gallant Ship.")
Are ye willing to work and to wait,
To work and wait for the day,
When brotherhood and mirth shall beautify the earth,
And weariness and want be away?
Chorus;
When leisure and pleasure shall be free,
And hardship and hunger shall go;
When the worker has his place at the top of the tree;
And the loafer is somewhere down below,
Below, below,
And the loafer is somewhere down below.
Keep clear of the poison of the press.
Let your grand old misleaders alone;
It will pay you for your pains to educate your brains,
And do a little thinking of your own.
Hold fast your own ideas of right and wrong,
Don’t take it from the workers’ sweating band,
For the “truth” they preach to you is very seldom true,
And what is true they do not understand.
Have justice for ever in your eye;
Steer wide of the charitable sneak,
Who, to lull the cry of toil, spares a trifle from the spoil
He has wrung from the wreckage of the weak.


Have done at last with higgling for a wage,
Too long you’ve nursed the swindler and the drone.
Why labor at a loss for the profit of a boss
Get ready now to labor for your own.
OVERALLS AND SNUFF.
(Tune: "Wearing of the Green.”)
One day I was walking along the railroad track,
I met a man in Wheatland with his blankets on his back.
He was an old-time hop picker. I’d seen his face before,
I knew he was a wobbly, by the button that Re wore,
By the button that he wore, by the button that he wore,
I knew he was a wobbly, by the button that he wore.
He took his blankets off his back, and sat down on the rail
And told us some sad stories ’bout the work down in jail.
He said the way they treat them there, he never saw the
like,
For they’re putting men in prison just for going out on
strike.
Just for going out on strike, just for going out on strike!
They’re putting men in prison, just for going out on strike.
They have sentenced Ford and Suhr, and they’ve got
them in the pen,
If they catch a wobbly in their burg, they vag him there
and then.
There is one thing I can tell you, and it makes the bosses
sore.
As fast as they can pinch us, we can always get some
We can always get some more, we can always get some
more.
As fast as they can pinch us, we can always get some
more.
Oh, Horst and Durst are mad as Hell, they don’t know
what to do,
And the rest of those hop barons are all feeling mighty
blue,
Oh, we’ve tied up all their hop fields and the scabs refuse
to come.


And we’re going to keep on striking till we put them on
the bum.
Till we put them on the bum, till we put them on the
bum,
We’re going to keep on striking till we put them on the
bum.
Now we’ve got to stick together, boys, and strive with all
our might.
We must free Ford and Suhr, boys we’ve got to win this
fight.
From these scissorbill hop barons we are taking no more
bluff,
We’ll pick no more damned hops for them, for overalls
and snuff.
For our overalls and snuff, for our overalls and snuff.
We’ll pick no more damned hops for them, for overalls
and snuff.
TOM BARKER.
(The following letter was sent by evergreen Tom to
a member of the I.L.P, and is like a breeze from the not-
long-past, when humorous Tom held forth glibly on the
evergreen Dom.)
Well, am very pleased to hear that you are alive and
taking an interest in things. There is plenty of work for
willing hands and tongues, and I hope you will make good.
Personally, I am well, and have completed eight
months out of the six allotted me by the Josses and Pooh-
bahs. I have great hopes of completing the sentence be-
fore the last penny of war loan interest has been paid.
Still many things may now happen, seeing that Cicero,
Demosthenes, Cyclops-Edmund-Burke-Balaclava-de-Bendl-
go, and the famous Parramatta-cod-lin-moth-King have
taken their departure for the scene of action. I suppose
they will sleep in lifebelts the last few days, and have a
liberal supply of cuttings from the antiquated "Argus”
and the “Sunday Crimes” to pass the time with.
Anyway, I hope for the best, and don’t worry about
the worst. I might have been bom a Labor politician,
which is about the lowest job going outside of the public?
hangman, and 41 per cent, patriots.
Yours for the 0.8. Union, TOM BARKER.
June 29, 1918.


THE HOPE OF THE AGES.
E. Nesbit.
(Tune: “Three Cheers for the Ked, White,
If you dam up the river of progress—
and Blue.”)
At your peril and cost let it be;
That river must seawards despite you—
’Twill break down your dams and be free
And we heed not the pitiful barriers
That you in its way have downcast;
For your efforts but add to the torrent,
Whose flood must overwhelm you at last.
CHORUS:
For our banner is raised and unfurled
At your head our defiance is hurled;
Our cry is the cry of the ages—
Our hope is the hope of the wond.
We laugh in the face of the forces,
For the harder oppression the fiercer
The current will be when it flows.
We shall win, and the tyrant’s battalions
Will scatter like chaff in the fight,
From which the true Soldiers of Freedom,
Shall gather new courage and might.
Whether leading the van of the fighters,
In bitterest stress of the strife;
Or patiently bearing the burden
Of changelessly commonplace life.
One hope we have ever before us,
Our aim to attain and fulfil,
One watchword we cherish to mark us,
One kindred and brotherhood still.
What matter if failure on failure
Crowd closely upon us and press?
When a hundred have bravely been bpaten.
The hundred and first wins succes.
Our watchword is “Freedom”; new soldiers
Flock each day where her flag is unfurled.
Our cry is the cry of the ages,
Our hope is the hope of the world.


THE OPTIMISTIC LABORITES.

(Tune: “The Harp That Once Through Tara’s
We’ll sing in praises of future days.
The happy times to be.
When every man shall guard the plan
That every man be free.
We have no ties beyond the skies.
Our loves and hopes are here;
No holy fool can make us drool,
The dismal hymns of fear.
With ready hand we take our stand
To hope and work and fight;
And while we live, our strength we’ll give
For liberty and right.
We make all wealth, conserve all health,
By cunning craft and trade;
We bring all joys, for we’re the boys
Of hammer, brush, and spade.
Then live the part that warms the heart,
And wakens manhood’s pride;
All Nature’s laws confirm the cause
For which our comrades died.
Some day we’ll own the fields we’ve sown,
When hunger’s rule is past;
No child shall slave to feed a knave,
When man is free at last.
THE “BLANKET STIFF.”
He built the road.
With others of his class he built the road.
Now o’er it, many a weary mile, he packs his load,
Chasing a job, spurred on by hunger’s goad,
He walks and walks, and walks and walks.
And wonders, why in Hell he built the road.


HELP THE JAILED.
(For “Solidarity”).
(Tune: "Wrap Me Up in My Stock Whip and
Blanket”).
At this hour when the plutes are dictators.
Controlling industrial life.
To jail go the best agitators.
Leaving helpless their children-wlfe.
Chorus:
So make it a “ding-dong” collection.
We’ll send a fat cheque by next mail.
To help their helpless dependents.
And comrades who languish in jail.
To speak out your mind is conspiring.
These plutes you must never defy,
If they haven’t a law, that will jail you,
A bribe may be’ paid for a lie.
Then come, let us solemnly pledge, hoys.
Agitation we never shall cease.
Until the whole twelve unconditioned.
Our masters in terror release.
Unrelenting we’ll keep agitating.
Till the cold dismal cells shall confine
The tyrants who jailed the brave battlers
For the cause that is your’s and mine.


IT IS THE UNION.
Richard Brazier.
(Tune: "We Have a Navy.”)
Sing a song in praise of toiling- masses,
Sing a song about our sons of toil;
Sing of wrongs done to the working classes.
Wrongs that make our hearts boil.
We have always borne the blows and lashes —
No more we’ll patient stand.
But on* every hand, throughout this splendid land.
We sons of toil will make our stand.
Then in our glory will we tower,
What will be the secret of the power?
CHORUS:
It is the Union, the Industrial Union—
Our banner is unfurled.
We will unite in all our splendid might
In the Industrial Workers of the World.
We have a union, a fighting union,
And our masters know that, too,
It will keep them in their place,
When they know they have to face.
Our union of workingmen that’s true.
For countless years and ages we’ve been enslaved
Beneath the capitalistic rule;
We. the strortg cringing to those men depraved,
In whose hands we have been a tool,
But the day of liberty is dawning—
Freedom now draws nigh—
We must win the fight—
Wage slavery then will die.
Then in our glory will we tower;
Great will be the workers’ power.
A four-hour day for all unemployed workers would
thousands of unemployed to work.


WE WILL SING ONE SONG.
By Joe Hill.
(Air: “My Old Kentucky Home.”)
We will sing one song of the meek and humble slave.
The horn-handed son of the toil.
He’s toiling hard from the cradle to the grave.
But his master reaps the profits from his toil.
Then we’ll sing one song of the greedy master class,
They’re vagrants in broadcloth, indeed.
They live by robbing the ever-toiling mass.
Human blood they spill to satisfy their greed.
CHORUS:
Organise! Oh, toilers, come organise your might;
Then we’ll sing one song of the workers* commonwealth,
Full of beauty, full of love and health,
We will sing one song of the politician sly.
He’s talking of changing the laws;
Election day all the drinks and smokes he’ll buy,
While he’s living from the sweat of your brow,
Then we’ll sing one song of the girl below the line,
She’s scorned and despised everywhere.
While in their mansions the “keepers” wine and dine
From the profit that immoral traffic bear.
We will sing one song of the preacher, fat and sleek,
He tells you of homes in the sky.
He says, “Be generous, be lowly, and be meek.
If you don’t you’ll sure get roasted when you die.”
Then we’ll sing one song of the poor and ragged tramp,
He carries his home on his back,
Too old to work, he’s not wanted round the camp,
So he wanders without aim along the track.
We will sing one song of the children In the mills,
They’re taken from playgrounds and schools,
In tender years made to go the pace that kills,
In the sweatshops, ’mong the looms and the spools.
Then we’ll sing one song of the One Big Union Grand,
The hope of the toiler and slave.
It’s coming fast, it is sweeping sea and land,
To the terror of the grafter and the knave.


THE REBEL GIRL.
Words and Music by Joe Hill.
(Copyrighted 1916).
There are women of many descriptions
In this queer world, as everyone knows,
Some are living in beautiful mansions,
And are wearing the finest of clothes.
There are blue-blooded queens and princesses,
Who have charms made of diamonds and pearl;
But the only and thoroughbred lady
Is the Rebel Girl.
CHORUS
That’s the Rebel Girl, that’s the Rebel Girl!
To the working class she’s a precious pearl.
She brings courage, pride, and joy
To the fighting Rebel Boy.
We’ve had girls before, but we need some more
In the Industrial Workers of the World,
For it’s great to fight for freedom
With a Rebel Girl.
Yes, her hands may be hardened from labor,
And her dress may not be very fine,
But a heart in her bosom is beating
That is true to her class and her kind.
And the grafters in terror are trembling
When her spite and defiance she’ll hurl;
For the only and thoroughbred lady
Is the Rebel Girl.
Let’s have some Life!
Some vim, some snap, some go!
Some rich, red daring Blood!
Blood that drives furiously through the veins
that exceeds the conventional speed limit
and upsets the equilibrium of the staid and
horrified cop.
By AME PERDUE.


PAINT ’ER RED.
Ralph H. Chaplin.
(Tune: “Marching Through Georgia.”)
Come-with us, you workingmen, and join the rebel band;
Come, you discontented ones, and give a helping hand;
We march against the parasite to drive from the land
With ONE BIG INDUSTRIAL UNION!
CHORUS.
Hurrah! hurrah! we’re going to paint ’er red!
Hurrah! hurrah! the way is clear ahead—
We’re gaining shop democracy and liberty and bread,
With ONE BIG INDUSTRIAL UNION!
In factory and field and mine we gather in our might.
We’re on the job and know the way to win the hardest
fight.
For the beacon that shall guide us out of darkness into
light
Is ONE BIG INDUSTRIAL UNION!
Come on,, you fellows, get in line; we’ll fill the boss with
fears;
Red’s the color of our flag, it’s stained with blood and
tears—
We’ll flout it in his ugly mug and ring our loudest cheers,
For ONE BIG INDUSTRIAL UNION!
“Slaves” they call us, “working plugs,” inferior by birth,
But when we hit their pocketbooks we’ll spoil their smiles
of mirth—
We’ll stop their dirty dividends and drive them from the
With ONE BIG INDUSTRIAL UNION!


THE WORKERS OF THE WORLD ARE NOW
AWAKENING.
. By Richard Brazier.
(Tune: “The Shade of the Old Apple Tree.”)
The Workers of the World are now awaking;
The earth is shakin’ with their mighty tread.
The master class in great fear now are quaking.
The sword of Damocles hangs o’er their read.
The toilers in one union are uniting,
To overthrow their cruel master’s reign,
In one union now they all are fighting.
The product of their labor to retain.
CHORUS:
It’s a union for true Liberty,
It’s a union for you and me;
It’s the workers’ own - choice.
It’s for girls and boys.
Who want freedom from wage slavery,
And we march with a Red Flag ahead,
’Cause the blood of all nations is red—
Come and join in the fray,
Come and join us to-day.
We are fighting for Freedom and Bread.
The master class in fear have kept us shaking,
For long in bondage they held us fast;
But the fight the Industrial Workers are now making.
Will make our chains a relic of the past.
Industrial unionism now is calling,
The toilers of the world they hear its cry,
In line with the Industrial Workers they are falling,
By their principles to stand and fall or die.
Why does a short work day and a long pay always go
together?


WALKING ON THE GRASS.
(Tune: "The Wearing of the Green.”)
In this blessed land of freedom where King Mammon
wears a
There are many ways illegal now to hold the people down.
When the dudes of state militia are slow to come to time
The law upholding Pinkertons are gathered from the
slime.
There are wisely framed injunctions that you must not
leave your job.
And a peaceable assemblage is declared to be a mob.
And Congress passed a measure framed by some consum-
mate ass,
So they are clubbing men and women just for walking on
the grass.
In this year of slow starvation, when a fellow looks for
work,
The chances are a cop will grab his collar with a jerk;
He will run him in for vagrancy, he is branded as a tramp,
And all the well to do will shout: "It serves him right,
the scamp!”
So we let the ruling class maintain the dignity of law,
When the court decides against us we are filled with
wholesome awe,
But, we cannot stand the outrage without a little sauce,
When they’re clubbing men and women just for walking
on the grass.
The papers said the union men were all but anarchist,
So the job trust promised work for all who wouldn’t
enlist;
But the next dav when the hungry horde surrounded city
hall.
He hedged and said he didn’t promise anything at all.
So the powers that be are acting very queer to say the
least —
They should go and read their Bible and all about Bel-
shazzar’s feast,
And when mene tekel at length shall come to pass,
They’ll stop clubbing men and women just for walking
on the grass.


ONE BIG INDUSTRIAL UNION.
(Air: “Marching Through Georgia.")
By G. Allen.
Bring the good old red book, boys, -we’!! sing another
song.
Sing it to the wage slave who has not yet joined the
throng,
Of the revolution that will sweep the world along,
To One Big Industrial Union.
CHORUS
Hooray! Hooray! The truth will make you free.
Hooray! Hooray! When will you workers see?
The only way you’ll gain your economic liberty,
Is One Big Industrial Union.
Now the harvest String Trust they would move to
Germany,
The Silk Bosses of Paterson, they also want to flee
Prom strikes and labour troubles, but they cannot get
From One Big Industrial Union.
You migratory workers of the common labour clan.
We sing to you to join and be a fighting Union man;
You must emancipate yourself, you proletarian,,
With One Big Industrial Union.
CHORUS:
Hooray! Hooray! Bet’s set the wage slave free.
Hooray! Hooray! With every victory,
Well hum the workers’ anthem till you finally must be
In One Big Industrial Union.
Send your Sub. for “Solidarity”


WHERE PARRAMATTA RIVER FLOWS.
(Tune: "Where the River Shannon Flows.”)
Fellow workers pay attention to what I'm going to men-
tion.
For it is the fixed Intention of the Workers of the World,
And I hope you’ll all be ready, true-hearted, brave and
steady
To gather round our standard when the Red Flag is un-
furled.
CHORDS:
Where the Parramatta flows, each fellow worker knows,
They have bullied and oppressed us, but still our Union
grows,
And we’re got to find a way, boys, for shorter hours and
better pay, boys;
And we’re going to win the day, boys, where the Parra-
matta flows.
For these gunny-sack contractors have all been dirty
actors,
And they’re our benefactors, each fellow-worker knows.
So we’ve go to stick together in fine and dirty weather,
And we will show no white feather, where the Parramatta
flows.
Now the boss the law is stretching, bulls and pimps he's
fetching,
And they are a fine collection, as iwowser* only knows.
But why their mothers reared them, and why the devil
spared them,
Are quetions we can’t answer, where the Parramatta
flows.
Why should any worker be without the necessities of
life when ten men can produce enough for a hundred?


NOVEMBER NINETEENTH.
By John E. Nordquist.
(Tune: “The Red Flag.’*)
They’ve shot Joe Hill, his life has fled.
They’ve filled his manly heart with lead;
But his brave spirit hovers near.
And bids each fellow worker cheer.
CHORUS;
On high the blood-red banners wave!
The flag for which his life he gave;
The master class shall rue the day
They took Joe Hillstrom’s life away.
Now, fellow workers, shed no tear.
For brave Joe Hill died without fear;
He told the bosses’ gunmen, low:
“I’m ready; fire! Let her go!”
No more Joe Hill shall pen the songs
That pictured all the workers’ wrongs;
His mighty pen shall rust away,
But all his songs are here to stay..
Now Salt Lake City’s Mormon throngs
Must list to Joe Hill’s rebel songs;
While angry sabs shall prowl the night
To show the One Big Union’s might.
March on, march on, you mighty host,
And organise from coast to coast;
And Joe Hill’s spirit soon shall see
Triumphant Labour’s victory.
Commodity production, with its creation of surplus
values is the basis of capitalism, and the basis of the
misery, poverty, and degradation of the working class.
It is right here, at the point of production, where this dual
monster breeds, that the workers must organise and
direct their solidarity.
JACK HILL in Pamphlets “Solidarity'.”


MY WANDERING BOY.
Where is my wandering hoy to-night,
The boy of his mother’s pride?
He’s counting the ties with his bed on his back.
Or else he’s bumming a ride.
CHORUS:
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
Oh, where is my boy to-nighi?
He is on the head-end of an overland train,
That’s where my boy is to-night
His heart may be pure as the morning dew
But his clothes are a sight to see.
He’s pulled for a vag, his excuse won’t do,
“Thirty days,” says the beak, you see.
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
The chilly wind blows, to the lock-up he goes.
That’s where your boy is to-night.
“I was looking for work, oh, sir,” he said.
Says the baak, “I have heard that before,
So to join the chain-gang off he’s led.
To hammer the rocks some more.
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
To strike many blows for his country he goes,
That’s where your boy is to-night.
Don’t search for your wandering boy to-night,
Let him play the old game if he will;
A worker, a bum, he’ll never go right,
As long as he’s a wage slave still.


CHORUS:
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
His money is out of sight,
Wherever he blows, up against It he goes,
“23” for your boy to-night.
JOE HILL’S LAST WILL.
(Written in his cell, November 18, 1916, on the eve of
,his execution.)
(Tune; Red Flag.)
My will is easy to decide,
For there is nothing to divide.
My kin don’t need to fuss and moan—
“ Moss does not cling to a rolling stone.”
My body! Ah! If I could choose,
I would to ashes It reduce,
And let the merry breezes blow
My dust to where some flowers grow.
Perhaps some fading flowers then
Would come to life and bloom again,
This is my last and final will,
Good luck to all of you.
JOE HILL.
