Where lone
Mount Desolation lies
Mounts Dreadful
and Despair -
'Tis lost beneath
the rainless skies
In hopless deserts there
It spreads nor-west
by No Man's-Land
Where clouds
are seldom seen -
To where the
catĺe stations lie
Three hundred miles beween.

By hut, homested
and shearing-shed,
By railroad coach,
and brack
By lonely graves where
rest our dead,
Lest in the city I forget
True mateship after all,
My water-bag and billy yet are hanging on the wall;
It lies beyond the
farming belt,
Wide waste of scrub
and plain,
A blazing desert
in the drought,
A lake-land
after rain,
And camped by night
where plains lie wide,
Like some old ocean's bed,
The watchmen in the
starlight ride
Round fiftèn
hundred head.
To where beneath
the clustered stars
the dreamy plains expand
My home lies wide
a thousand miles
In the Never Never Land
Up-Country
and Out-Back
The drovers of the
Great Stock Routes
The strange gulf
country know
Where, travelling from,
the southern droughts,
The big lean
bullocks go;
To the skyline sweeps
the waving grass,
Or whirls the
scorching sand-
A phantom land,
a mystic realm!
The Never Never Land.
And I, to save my soul again,
Would tramp to sunsets grand
With sad-eyed mates acroś the plain
In the Never-Never Land.
The Never Never Land
