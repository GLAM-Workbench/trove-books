PREFACE.
In republishing, by the courteous permission
of the proprietors of The Argus, the verses
contained in this little volume, I desire at the
present brilliant moment in Britain?s history
to furnish a small memento of the stirring-
o
events in South Africa, and of the glorious
7 o
achievements of those Australian troops who
have on many a battlefield cemented with
their blood the unity of the Empire.

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN.


A DEDICATION.
- no>
To DONALD MACDONALD.
J | E led us through an unfamiliar scene
Of crests and peaks and mighty boulders bare
That rose on either hand ; then pointed where
The Valley of the Shadow lay between.
We heard Death?s envoys hurtling shrill and keen,
We smelt the blood-taint in the sultry air.
We saw the tattered flag still flying there,
Girt by its guard of heroes gaunt and lean.
And so our brother suffered for our gain,
While, by his magic wizardry of pen,
Amid the terrors of that prison-den
He lent us out his very heart and brain.
Now we give thanks because Death faltered
then?
And God has saved our comrade from the slain.

BALLADS OF BATTLE.
A CALL FROM ENGLAND.
There came a cry forth speeding o?er the mighty Indian
main,
A whisper that was home upon the breeze;
?Twas the voice of England calling, and the words were dem-
and plain,
?Come and help me, O my children overseas.
Come and help me, for the war-storm may no longer make
delay,
And already on my sons the bolts are hurled;
But the thunder-clouds that rattle ?mid the Afric hills to-day
On the morrow may be breaking o?er the world.
Ye have not seen the poppies in my fields of w T aviug wheat,
Nor strayed amid my meadows and my rills;
In my gracious-flowing rivers ye have never dipped your
feet;
Ye have not plucked the daisies on my hills;
Ye have not smelt the springtime where the robin builds
her nest,
Nor heard my blackbirds singing sweet and clear;
Yet are ye all my children, who have nestled at my breast,
And I call because I feel that you will hear.
The Dutchmen know me well, my sons. The centuries are
naught
In the lifetime of the nations of the earth;
Not yet three hundred years have passed since fierce and
fast they fought,
And stoutly tried my ships and seamen?s worth.
It almost seems like yesterday that Tromp with forty sail,
In mocking pride to Dover Castle ran,
And fired the shot that echoed long and loud through every
gale,
Till Monck fulfilled the task that Blake began.


And never while my realm endures shall fade brave Blake?s
renown,
Whose name my sons unborn as yet shall bless.
Oh the Victory and the Vanguard, and the Triumph bearing
down,
How well they fought that day hard by the Ness.
Outnumbered was my squadron, and ?gainst twenty ships
these three
Long time endured the shock in woeful plight.
Yet guarded safe my standard and my lordship of the sea,
And came with colours flvinsr from the fight.
And well can I remember, too, lioav Tromp, with haughty
boast,
The broom on high upon his masthead bound;
With threats that, in despite of me, he would assail my
coast
And sweep my ships from off their battle ground.
But now, to-day, the sons of those who lightly decked their
mast
?The British to the sea/ in vaunting pride,
?We soon shall sweep,? proclaim afar, forgetful of the past,
And of the long whip-pennant that we plied.
But for the single pennant that I made to drive their hordes,
And beat them home, despite of force or fraud,
They?ll find that now my hand doth grasp a scourge of
many cords,
To whip them of their insolence abroad.
My sons, the self-same foe to-day is arrogant once more
As Avhen in short-lived pride he scoured the main;
I ask you to remember lioav your fathers fought of yore;
I ask your SAvords?say, shall I ask in A r ain??
Now back across the sea that brought the message from
the west
We send an answer, worthy of our name?
A mighty troopship laden Avith our bravest and our best,
Bright souls with love and loyalty aflame.
And if some hearts untimely pierced shall throb with death?s
dark pang,
That thrill to-day to leave this Austral strand,
Be theirs the joy of which long since a deathless poet sang,
?flow SAveet it is to die for fatherland!?


THE BUSHMAN?S QUESTION.
Oh, ?tis pleasant in the paddocks when the summer snn is
low,
And the fervour of the day begins to fade,
Just to watch the quiet cattle where the rich deep grasses
grow
In the fulness of the lightwood?s shade.
And yonder is the homestead, in the hollow out of sight.
That has sheltered me for twenty years and more;
And, dad, your strength is failing, and my mother's hair is
white?
And Why am I going 1o the War?
My son, there is a Motherland, and far away it lies
?Mid the tumult of the seas that know not peace,
And on its shores the thunder of the ocean never dies
And the songs of the wind never cease:
Rut wind and wave together through the sunshine and the
rain
Of each fleeting season as it runs
Have sung and thundered ever with the same glad, great
refrain
Of liberty for England?s sons.
To-day across the valley of the river sings a wind
That yesterday breathed soft at Rnnnymede,
When mail-clad fingers pointed and the trembling tyrant
signed ,?
The Charter that our liberty decreed.
And how should you stand idle now, whose fathers scorned
to flee,
And dared the tyrant to his knees to bring
For sake of that great Charter, with its rights for yon and
me,
That they wrested then from a King.


To-day against the Dover cliffs their war the grey seas wage
That yesterday adown the Channel SAvept
With spray-strewn British pennants on the Spaniard's
weather gauge
And terror where the fire-ships crept;
Lo, in his dim Escurial false Philip cowering prays,
Who sought to break our England on the wheel.
Where is his great Armada now? Can you forget those
days?
Can you be deaf AAdien rings the English steel?
The mighty heart of England no tyrannic master fears
Either at home or in a foreign state.
On Chalgrove Field the patriot faced Prince Rupert?s
ca\ T aliers,
And, greatly daring, died to leave us great.
At Blenheim lioav our horsemen charged! Eight thousand
sabres good
The dreams of Louis swept to Inrvoc fast.
At Waterloo how gloriously the British bayonets stood!
Ha! does your cheek find colour now at last?
But the peace that England carries and the equal hiAvs for
each
With her standards that she sets in many lands,
And the rights she gives to others, whereso?eer her borders
reach,
All these for her children she demands.
Hark, the mutter of the nations, envy-stricken to the soul,
Though they dread to loose the thunder of their guns,
As with stern unswerving footsteps England seeks her
single goal
Stayed by the strength of her sons.
And surely Marlborough?s spirit, purified of earthly dross,
Forgets not yet his mighty deeds long gone;
And surely though his body rests beneath the golden cross
The patriot soul of Wellington on.
And you in this bright daughter-state of England born and
bred
Are kin with those great Englishmen of yore.
Fitzwalter, Drake, and Hampden are but elder brethren
dead,
And that?s why you are going to the War.


?WITH DEATH?S PROPHETIC
EAR.?
Lay my rifle here beside me, set my Bible on my breast,
For a moment let the warning bugles cease;
As the century is closing I am going to my rest,
Lord, lettest Thou Thy servant go in peace.
But loud through all the bugles rings a cadence in mine ear,
And on the winds my hopes of peace are strowed.
Those winds that waft the voices that already I can hear
Of the rooi-baatjes singing on the read.
Yes. the red-coats are returning, I can hear the steady tramp,
After twenty years of waiting, lulled to sleep,
Since rank and file at Potchefstroom we hemmed them in
their camp,
And cut them up at Bronkerspruit like sheep.
They shelled us at Ingcgo, but we galloped into range,
And we shot the British gunners where they showed,
I guessed they would return to us, I knew the chance must
change?
Hark! the rooi-baatjes singing on the road!
But now from snow-swept Canada, from India?s torrid
plains,
From lone Australian outposts, hither led,
Obeying their commando, as they heard the bugle?s strains,
The men in brown have joined the men in red.
They come to find the colours at Majuba left and lost,
They come to pay us back the debt they owed;
And I hear new voices lifted, and I see strange colours
tossed,
?Mid the rooi-baatjes singing on the road.


M A JUBA.
The old, old faiths must falter, and the old, old creeds must
fail?
I hear in that distant murmur low ?
The old, old order changes, and ?tis vain for us to rail,
The great world does not want us?we must go.
And veldt, and spruit, and kopje to the stranger will belong,
No more to trek before him we shall load;
Too well, too well, I know it, for I hear it in the song
Of the rooi-baatjes singing on the road.
Up beyond the Inyati, where the frontier ranges rise,
Dark and lonely looms the mountain evil-starred;
Staring southward for the column, keeping vigil ?gainst
surprise,
Standing grimly like a sentinel on guard.
But at night strange sounds re-echo, and dim phantoms rise
from rest,
And the voices of dead captains call again;
Through the winds that Avail and whimper round Majuba?s
haunted crest,
That is peopled by the spirits of the slain.
Hark, the whispers on tiie mountain Avhere the mist-Avreaths
form and flee!
Look, the shadoAVS moving upward out of sight!
Hist, the sound of falling boulders, by no human foot set
free,
Plunging downward with a rattle through the night!
And the wandering Kaffir trembles, for he knows that
yonder creep
Only shadoAvs of the men who climbed before;
Stumbling slowly through the darkness, cartridge-laden, up
the steep?
?Tis the night-march on Majuba-hill once more.


As they gain the crest at sunrise, in the daybreak?s crimson
flood,
Stained for omen, 10, Majuba?s brow is red!
When the dawnlight broadens slowly, all the plateau shows
like blood?
Listen, yonder ring the voices of the dead!
Oh! to bid them pile entrenchments, and to drag the Gatlings
up,
Waking quickly from false dreams of fancied ease!
Oh! to banish Colley?s madness! ?Tis in vain; the shameful
Must be drunken to the utmost bitter lees.
Stealing up to storm the summit, where the red-coats lie
secure,
By the ridges, see, the foe their pathway make.
O, outposts on the plateau set, keep ward and vigil sure,
O fighting line, stand firm for England?s sake.
Too late, too late; by scarp and crag the foemeu win the
crown,
And heavy is the reckoning of the cost;
For a volley rakes the kopje, and the blood-red sun sinks
down,
On broken rank, wrecked hope, and leader lost.
And when moaning o?er Majuba, through the gloom the
night winds blow,
E?en the wandering Kaffir heeds the well-known tale;
Marks the wraiths of all the fallen, hurrying wildly to
and fro,
Hears the sobs of dying soldiers in the gale.
But when dark Majuba sees the British infantry once more,
And sounding out ?Last Post? the bugles cease,
Those restless wraiths will hear the call, obedient as of yore,
And lulled to sleep at last will rest in peace.


OUR LADY OF DEATH.
At last! 'Hark, the Mauser is ringing!
The rocks let the echoes resound!
A vapour is curling and clinging
Out yonder, low down to the ground.
?Twixt the African sky bluely burning,
And the sward of the veldt softly green,
All white, like a spirit returning,
The first smoke of battle is seen.
Lo, swiftly the smoke-wreaths are blended
And woven, fill yonder there stands
A Figure with pinions extended,
And face that is hid in the hands.
But dread is the tale of her mission,
And drear are the words that she saith,
And the doomed know with chill premonition
The form of Our Lady of Death.
Out, forward, the horsemen are ranging;
The guns gallop over the rise;
The smoke-drift is lifting and changing?
Our Lady hath covered her eyes.
For she knows that when autumn comes sobbing
To visit the field of the brave,
Over hearts that are now proudly throbbing
Unharvested grasses shall wave.
But, mark, in the breeze of the morning
Another new outline is scored,
An arm is stretched forth as in warning?
Our Lady hath lifted the sword!
And the Boer shall be flung from his border,
The Kaffir shall pass like a breath,
For the burgher commandos in order
Must kneel to Our Lady of Death.


? LEFT, RIGHT, LISTEN TO THE
MARCHING.?
?I cannot leave the homestead, there's too much for me
to do;
I?m Avanted badly here, you needn?t doubt me,
With my horses all in harness and my har\ r est half-way
through.
Oh, there?s plenty for the war, I?m sure, without me.?
?There?s a harvest on the Modder if of work you?re not
afraid,
And already on the plain the sheaves they?re heaping;
There?s a crop at far Colenso that is Avaiting for the blade;
Oh, won?t you go and take a job of reaping??
?Left, right, left, right (over the new-cut rails;
See your old horse, how his neck is arching);
Far and faint from Canada, but nearer from New
South Wales,
Left, right, listen to the marching.?
?I cannot go to battle, for at home I'm forced to stay,
I cannot leaA?e my mother old complaining,
For who Avould come to comfort her if I should march away,
Since I?m the only son she has remaining??
?Oh, -soon your mother old will learn her bitter grief to
Quell,
And. though AA?ith last farewells her eyes are streaming,
Right proudly she AA?ill giA r e you for the laud she loves so
Avell?
The country that she sees in fitful dreaming.
Left, right, left, right, from daisied hills and dales,
Copses deep, and AA?oods AA?ith oaks o?erarching,
Prairies Avide of Canada or plains of Noav South Wales,
Left, right. listen to the marching.?


?Oh, what?s the use of talking? for I cannot quit the farm.
There?s something else that binds me close and holds me.
Far stronger than a chain of steel is just this soft white arm
That?s thrown around my neck, and fast it folds me.?
?Unclasp the small white fingers, lad, and kiss the eyes
that fill;
No evil in your absence shall befall her. *
Deep in your heart you know that there?s one sweeter
mistress still,
And Honour is the name by which men call her.
Left, right, left, right, lovers must end their tales,
Though the trembling lips for love are parching.
Far and faint from Canada, but nearer from New
Soiith Wales,
Left, right, up and join the marching!?
THE VICTOR?S MESSAGE.
??Twere a risky ride to the south to-day, for the scouts will
be hard to shun,
But how shall I tell them at Maritzburg that the hard
fought day is won??
He looked on his captains plumed and spurred, then, he
lifted a glance above,
And he bound the message firm and fast ?neath the wing
of a homing dove.
Ready to ride on a hope forlorn, the lancer and light hussar.
Reining their eager chargers in, looked up to the heights
afar;
And three times circled the snow-white bird, in the azure-
blue clear-seen,
Ere she owned the line and southward sped on the service
of the Queen.


Far on the earth below she heard the sullen guns that
pealed,
She saw through fathoms of crystal air the corpse-strewn
-battle-field;
Till the ring of the rifles fainter grew, and the din of the
distant tight,
As she set her wings in a long, strong stroke, for a hundred
miles of flight.
Over the hills that crown the course of the Flagstone Spruit
she fled.
Out on a lonely ridge she saw the graves of the English
dead;
Where, ere the riddled remnant raised the white flag sad
and slow,
They emptied their lone last cartridges in the faces of
the foe.
And then beneath her outspread wings, away on a western
post,
She eyed the vengeance swift and dread that was wreaked
on the hostile host;
Discerning the ridge of Groblerskloof, and the lists of the
fatal plain,
With the earth still torn by the charging hoofs and piled
with the newly slain.
Behind were the roaring Creuzot guns, the crash and the
glint and glare,
Dike specks of dust were the frenzied hosts, like motes in
the midday air;
To the Avest more near drew the Drakensberg, and she saw
as she sped towards home,
The falls of the great Tugela?s tide like a far-off ribbon of
foam.
For a day, perchance for a morroAv, yonder his post the
soldier keeps,
But ever the Drakensberg abides, and ever the river leaps;
And eA r er on earth is the sound of strife, and of wars that
may not cease ?
Only above in the purer heights soar the snow-white Aviugs
of peace.


She saw the dark, deep forests, and the groves with
creepers coiled,
Where the scattered Amazizi lurk whom the Zulu impis
spoiled;
And the stunted Bushmen tip their shafts, and the gaunt
hyaenas creep
Over the long-forgotten graves, where the dusky warriors
sleep.
But southward still, to Colenso?s bridge, on tireless wing
she hied,
Beneath her gleamed Tugela?s wave; she crossed his
broadening tide,
And holding still on the clear-seen course, to Estcourt fast
she fled,
Where the shallow Bushman River purls and babbles in
pebbly bed.
Sweeping above the ironwoods, o?er the hills she hath
swiftly come,
But silent are all the saw-mills now, the ring of the axe
is dumb;
Across the great Umgeni falls, like a flake of foam she hath
passed,
And hath folded her wings on the well-known cote in
Maritzburg, at last.
They have lifted the pinions, resting now from the journey
over and done,
With tears of joy they have read the tale of a glorious
victory won;
And the sons of Britain o?er all the world, who close to her
proudly cling,
Have thrilled at the tale and the tidings glad that were
brought by that homing wing.


THE LEADER FOR LADYSMITH.
?In spite of the reverse at Spion Kop, the British troops
on the Tugela River are eager and ready for the advance
to the relief of Ladysmith. The advance may he expected
at any moment.???News item.
Sunk in a brief deep rest from toil ere the dawn of the
fateful day.
Under the stars, on his couch of earth, the sleeping soldier
lay;
At the dead of the night he started up, and his eyes were
open wide,
For he was aware of a horseman there who had halted by
his side.
In the star-beams pale the soldier saw the glint of a tunic
red,
And the Highland bonnet of olden times that was set on the
horseman?s head;
And the great black charger standing fast, as if carved in
bold relief,
Bearing himself with the lordly pride of a horse that carries
the Chief.
Straight to his feet the soldier leaped, though stricken with
wonder mute,
And lifted his hand as a soldier should, his General to
salute.
And then the lips of the old Chief moved, and the soldier
missed no word ?
My lad, remember Lucknow, and my gallant Ninety-third
Quickly the Chief in his saddle turned, and pointed far with
his sword,
Over the scarp of the beetling cliff that rose beyond the ford,
And his words rang out like the trumpet?s tones?-?In the
ranges yonder there
You will come to a second Mess-house, and another
Mnvtinicre.?


?What, is it three-and-forty years? Ah, surely?surely no,
Since I rode at the head of my old brigade as we marched
on the Sepoy foe!
Ah! it almost seems like yesterday that, just at the break
of morn,
In the wall of the old Dilkoosha-park the entrance breach
was torn.
?A moment later the cannon spoke. Young Roberts leaped
to earth,
To rescue a trooper, whose horse was cleft by a round shot
at the girth.
Honour and pride and grief since then have seamed the
warrior?s brow?
Is the old Field-marshal thinking to-night of the days before
Lucknow?
?Does he think of the fights of his boyhood?s years by the
side of his loved old Chief,
Of the peepul-tree at Secundrabagh, of the mosque at Shah
Nujeef,
Of the flag that thrice he planted high himself on the Mess-
house crown;
And thrice as he stood beside it there saw still again shot
down.
?But the din of battle has passed long since from Oude?s
ensanguined plain,
And England?s troops must light to-day yon Afric town to
gain;
My spirit shall go before them still with the fame of their
father?s deeds,
And the stormers draw not back, I trow, when Colin Camp-
bell leads.
?When the hour has come, and the bayonets gleam in the
light of the battle glare,
And the ridge red-litten is fringed with death, you shall
see my spirit there.
On, on, where you mark my phantom blade, as I mount to
the topmost brow,
And the God who gave us Havelock back will not forsake
us now.?


THE BRAVE THAT ARE NO MORE.
?Her Majesty the Queen has been deeply affected by the
heavy losses with which the British victories in South Africa
have been bought. She has been seen, of late, frequently
weeping in her apartments.??Cable message.
"See, dearest, this is how we fought the battle with the
Boer,?
So prattled on the little prince who played upon the floor,
Deploying all his leaden troops, with swords and guns
complete,
In set array of battle at the Royal Lady?s feet.
"These picture-books that I have piled to make the mountain
height
Are rocks on Mount Impati, where we won the flrst great
light;
And there advanced the stormers?you can almost hear
the cheers
Of the Devonshires and Gordons and the Dublin Fusileers.
?Impati, as it towers above, is clothed in morning mists,
But you can see the cannon of the Boer artillerists.
In heaps the Dubs, and Devons and the Highlanders go
down;
But over their dead bodies, see, their comrades win the
crown!
?And this is General Symons?you can mark his proud,
keen eye?
His orderly rides close to him, and bears his pennon high,
A target for the marksmen. Ha! the Mauser bullet flies,
And now upon the battle-field the gallant soldier lies.?


I?ut lip your leaden soldiers, child; my heart is stricken
mimic battles fought for pastime, I can bear no more.
Oh, heroes of Sebastopol! oh, loyal ones laid low!
My name was last upon your lips nigh fifty years ago!
And since I shed those first proud tears, by mountain,
plain, and sea
No year has passed that has not stilled brave hearts that
beat for me.
In many a land death came to them, in many a fearful
shape?
From Comorin to Candahar, from Caiio to the Cap?.
?By far Shangani River I can see brave Wilson?s band
Surrounded by the savage foe that closed on every hand;
And ere they died upon the spear-points, steadfast and
serene,
Bareheaded, faces to the foe, they sang, ?God Save the
Queen.?
?And still that temper fills the hearts, at home and over
seas,
Of those who bear my standards far, to wave on every
breeze.
For me, forsaking wife and child, they find a soldier?s bier;
And I, what can I give them? Nought but this?a woman?s
tear.?
Is that a Queen upon her throne, so softly sobbing there?
And does she hide some Royal grief, that none with her
may share?
Some sorrow of a Sovereign?s heart, that humbler bosom
shuns?
Ah, no! It is a Mother, who is weeping for her sons.


THE BUSHMAN?S FAREWELL.
1 hear the engines thumping as she battles head to sea,
?Good-bye, good-bye,? they thunder once again,
With a rising gale to windward and a surf-girt coast a-lee,
Oh, we?re rolling past the Otway in the rain,
And I hear the singing cordage and the creaking of the
mast,
And I try to find the fading Otway light.
I have bedded down my charger, I have made my hammock
fast,
Good night, my native land, a last good night.
A lad, amid the ranges rising yonder ?cross the flood,
I played until one day a message came,
And I felt the sudden manhood in a stirring of the blood,
And an impulse that within me burned like flame.
Oh, dearer than all beauties that are found in distant lands
Yon homestead that is hidden from my sight,
But the reason why I leave it?ah, the brave heart under-
stands,
Good night, my native land, a last good night.
Across the ever-widening gulf the bush-scents seem to pour,
The very leaves are lisping a farewell,
And though to-morrow yon dear land may meet my eyes
no more,
Perchance ?twill set within my heart its spell.
Then may thy proud free spirit watch where?er my way I
take,
So shall thy son be steadfast in the fight,
And if I fall, then may it be with honour, for thy sake,
Good night, my native land, a last good night.


THE RELIEF OF KIMBERLEY.
When the great Queen, whom each of us obeys,
For service true gives thee thy Sovereign's praise;
When, at the council gathered in their ranks,
The great ones of the nation give thee thanks;
When humbler hearts at mention of thy name
In England?s central city make acclaim,
Ah, listen, though between us ocean streams,
And hear us, too, thou Captain of our dreams.
For sad at heart and sick with hope deferred;
Long, weary months we waited for the word
That should proclaim the foe compelled to flee,
And all our prisoned countrymen set free.
Then, as through cloud-wrack gathering in its flight,
A gleam of radiance oft illumes the night,
So like a star above a mist-wrapped shore
Thou earnest, and the darkness was no more.
Although we ne?er have yet beheld thy face,
We feel no distance of estranging space;
Our dead with thine in Afric soil are laid.
With thine they share the wreath that shall not fade,
And should the need once more on England fall
Be sure that we shall gather at the call
With love and pride to follow still thy star,
Roberts of Kimberley and Candahar.


YILLEBOIS DE MAREUIL.
?Lord Methuen, the British general in command of the
field force operating from Kimberley, has placed a memorial
monument over the grave of the late Colonel Villebois de
Mareuil, the distinguished French strategist, who was killed
at Boshof while fighting for the Boers.??Cable message.
Stay, stranger, by this new-cut cross of stone,
And read the simple legend here, ?Ci git
Soldat de France, enfant de la patrie.?
Ah, dost thou wonder who lies here alone?
He sees no more the chestnut-blossoms blown
About the boulevards, nor hears the free
Glad ripple of the Seine?s soft minstrelsy
In that far land where well his name is known.
The lore of far St. Cyr could not him save,
Nor Fate, that Strategist all-conquering,
fend,
But still this stone where desert grasses
bend
Marks something else besides the Frenchman?s
grave?
A high-souled foeman?s tribute to the brave
When, in Death?s armistice, all hatreds


THE MESSAGE FROM MAE EKING.
When the long day?s march was over, and the cool night
breeze was blowing,
And the weary troops were sleeping, spur on heel and
hilt in hand,
Came a sound as of a footfall, faint, yet nearer, clearer
growing,
And a voice that spoke in whispers, which were hard
to understand.
But the startled sentry, watching in the shadow of a
boulder,
With the Cossack post behind him, gripped the side-
arm in his belt,
? Who goes there?? he challenged swiftly, with his rifle at
his shoulder
Was it fancy or the wind that sighed, ?The Spirit of
the Veldt??
But the sentry?s eyes were open, as if staring at a vision,
And the sentry?s ears were eager, as if waiting for a
word,
And at last he saw the outline of a misty apparition,
And the message of the Spirit to his beating heart he
heard?
? Oh, swifter than the eagle on his golden pinions plying,
I have sped to meet your column, with the message I
must tell,
For south I come from Mafeking, o?er leagues of desert
flying,
And I bring you truthful tidings, and I charge you heed
them well.


? Last night a fellow-shadow, on the veldt I found him
resting,
Dauntless leader of a legion that the world shall ne?er
forget,
In the moonless, starless silence, towards the foemen he
was questing,
And his brow with care was troubled, and his lips
were stern and set.
? And he muttered, ?Are they coming? Shall I never hear
the horses?
Shall I never see the sunlight on the shining British
steel?
Oh, for but a hundred sabres to assail yon girdling forces!
And for life and love and liberty one glorious stroke
to deal!
? ?Shall that sortie go for nothing then?? he murmured mid
the grasses,
?When Ave crept on them at midnight, fifty shadows
from the AAmst,
Fifty men to storm an army! Silently each shadow passes,
And there rings a startled volley, and the bayonet
does the rest.
? ?On that other night of daring, doubts and fears behind
them flinging,
Stanford charged, and gallant Paton, with their brave
young brows aglow,
Have those heroes died for nothing, to the very loopholes
clinging,
As they thrust their reeking barrels in the faces of
the foe?
? ?But the well-entrenched commandos, man to man refuse
to meet us,
And upon our women?s laager from afar their shells
they pour:
By the suffering of our sisters they are hoping to defeat us.
And the blood of little children calls for vengeance on
the Boer.


Wherefore, O ye winds that wander, and ye grasses softly
waving,
Leaves that lisp and rocks that listen, streams that
whisper, stones that hear,
I, your friend and your companion, need your help and
succour saving,
For my heart is growing heavy, and tlie end is drawing
near.
?Send this message to the column that is marching from
the river.
Let them choose their swiftest horses, let their hearts
within be stout,
Let them redden every rowel, the beleaguered to deliver,
And, our own good courage helping us, we still shall
last it out.?
?Then I, the Spirit of the Veldt, my mighty wings un-
folding,
Southward flew to Maritzani, from the desert speeding
forth,
And now at last the outpost of the column here beholding.
To you I give the message from the Hero in the North."
At dawn the guns were calling, and the bayonets were
gleaming;
At noon the foe, surrounded, in confusion dire were
hurled.
The native kraal of yesterday, in deep oblivion dreaming.
To-day is gallant Mafeking, the Wonder of the World.


VICTORY AT LADYSMITH.
At last Hie Arctic night of doubts and fears
Is over, and each spectre of the gloom.
Each haunting herald of impending doom.
With covered face despairing, disappears.
And England?s prisoned heroes, through their tears
Of joy. descry a brother-hero?s plume,
And welcome, where quick-coming vanguards
loom.
Dundonald's cavalry and carbineers.
The dawn, the dawn! A dayspring from on high
Breathes over all the land and victory tells.
The throbbing bosom of an Empire swells,
As flies the message far ?neath every sky.
Hark! over every ocean in reply,
Floats the thanksgiving of cathedral bells!


THE REJECTED VOLUNTEER.
Behold, a mounted rifleman, who came from Dingo Flat,
He cherished dreams of glory, and he wore a new slouch hat;
He hunted up his uniform, he donned his khakee brown,
And, scenting active service, off he hurried down to town.
But ?midst the dreams of glory, ah! he felt a sudden pain;
Now, was it a foreboding that he?d ne?er come back again;
Or the bitter pang of parting from the old bark shanty? No,
?Twas nothing but a bunion, just a' bunion on the toe.
He left the poley bullocks to investigate the farm,
He walked upon the Esplanade, a donah on his arm,
And talked of battle, murder, and of sudden death galore,
With sundry direful menaces against the dirty Boer.
Then, sitting closely at her side, he sought the dainty waist.
And round it with protecting care his manly arm he placed.
But when, alas! responsively she pressed his foot, ah, woe!
She trod upon the bunion, yes, the bunion on his toe.
And so they parted gloomily, with sorrow and with tears.
Next day he sought the barrack-square, a prey to horrid
fears,
And asked to be enlisted, for he thought he?d like a change,
So they made him take his clothes off and indulge in antics
strange.
For half an hour, at any rate, a nice old life he led;
They made him hop about the room and stand upon his
head;
They pummelled him and pounded him, then coldly bade
him go,
Because he?d got a bunion, just a bunion on his toe.
He begged them to look over it and one more chance allow:
His chest was fifty inches round, his fist would fell a cow.
His arm was like a redgum beam, his leg was like a rock.
His teeth would split a shilling, and his smile would stop
a Mock;


lie could manage without food and without water for a
week;
lie was sure that they would pass him if they?d only let
him speak.
The doubtful surgeons whispered, but up spake the P.M.0.,
?Why, man, you?ve got a bunion, look, a bunion on yourtoe.??
His dream of love had vanished like a mist-wreath from
the hill.
His chance of fame was over, but the bunion stayed there
still,
And, since his feet were weary, and he might no longer
roam,
He put his khakee on again, and sadly limped off home.
Now, listen to my story and take warning, all you lads,
And buy some patent plasters from ?(this space to let for
?ads?),
Or else, like him, you?ll find that life has nothing left to
show
If one only has a bunion, just a bunion on the toe.
GOOD-BYE SWEETHEART.
?Only one pass admitting a friend to the pier will be
issued to each member of the contingent.???Official Regu-
lation.
We?ve ?ad a lot of sweethearts on the string,
For a kiss never seemed to be a crime;
We?ve done a bit of courtin?, though we never bought
the ring;
Ah! we've hugged a many girls in our time.
But the farewell moment is nigh,
And kissing-time is almost past,
And the regulation limit is one sweetheart for good-bye.
Now who?s to be the last, the lucky last?


For the transport is waiting tor the train,
An? the ensign is floating high.
We?ll see no more of petticoats till we come "ome
again,
For we?re bound for the front. Good-bye!
They?ve put us on allowance for our hugs,
They?ve rationed us our kisses with our tea.
They?ve doled us out our sweethearts like our blankets
and our rugs,
One each per man, on his knee.
But, ?ow can a soldier choose
Sweet Susie, with ?er eyes of grey,
If Alice of the cherry lip he has to refuse?
An? that?s why we?re sad to-day.
So listen to the crowd's ? ?ip, ?ip,?
An? hearken to the boatswain?s cry;
The pilot?s on the bridge an? the anchor is a-trip,
An? we?re bound for the front. Good-bye!
But a soldier fresh from the fray
Is luckier than one who has to go.
The man who sank the Merrimac in Santiago Bay
Got more than a few, we know.
And when we are back out of this,
An? we listen for a sweetheart's voice,
Wy, we shan?t know who we ?ave got to kiss,
Because ?twill be Hobson?s choice.
So stifle the sobs in your breasts,
An? rub your eyes till they?re dry,
For we?ll soon be back with the clasps on our
chests, ,
Though we?re bound for the front. Good-bye!


PRETORIA AT LAST,
Oh! wot is all the fireworks an? the flags an' squibs an'
cheers about,
Au? wot is all this never-ending yelling in our ears about,
An? wherefore all these speeches by McLean and Lyne and
Laurier ?
Now ?aven?t yon discovered yet? Wy, Bobs ?as reached
Pretorier.
An? Britain ?eaves a mighty breath, expandin ?erself roomily,
While all the puzzled powers of the earth acknowledge
gloomily
That Europe ?olds no leader who is braver, bolder, hoarier
Than that same dashing little Bobs, who?s reached at last
Pretorier.
Ts dodges are surprisin?, and ?is marching is phenomenal,
Although ?is age is sixty-eight that?s really only nominal.
If many of yer's ?appy now, he?ll bring delight to more o? yer
By freeing all yer brothers as are prisoners in Pretorier.
Now Paul ?as gone to Lydenburg, an? tattered is his lingerie,
Ts prestige an' ?is belltopper ?ave suffered serious injury,
But gory though the fight ?as been, the bay?nets will be
gorier
If Kruger doesn?t ?old ?is jor now Bobs ?as reached Pretorier.
So all you foreign nations, as are apt to be too quizzical,
Just note the might of Britain an? ?er moral force an?
physical; i
Though little, she?s as big as any three o? yer or four o? yer,
An? game as ?er own little Bobs ?who?s reached at last
Pretorier.
