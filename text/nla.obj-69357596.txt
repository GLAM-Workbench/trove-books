The following alterations and amendments on the Amended
Laws of the United Melbourne District of the Ancient Order
of Foresters were adopted at a regular Quarterly Meeting of
the District, held on the 9th day of October, 1874, at the
Trades? Hall, Lygon-street, Carlton :
DISTRICT MEMBERS.
90. Should any Court in this District, which has been estab-
lished three years, legally close through want of a sufficient
number of members to carry on the business of the Court, or
inability to meet the legal demands of its members, any
members of such Court who may be averse to leaving the
Order in this District, may secure a continuance of the bene-
fits by paying their usual contributions, together with such
amount as they may receive as their share of the funds at the
closing of the Court into the District, until they be received
into another Court. The District Executive are hereby em-
powered to grant a clearance to such members whenever a
brother finds a Court willing to accept him, and a District
Quarterly Meeting may grant a bonus together with such
amount as the brother may have paid as his share at the divi-
sion of funds to the accepting Court. On his acceptance by a
Court his personal claim on the District ceases.
91. Brethren wishing to avail themselves of this privilege
must give notice to the D.S. within fourteen days from the
closing of the Court, and shall continue amenable to the Laws
of the U.M.D. All declarations on and off the Sick Fund
must be sent into the nearest Court, and if the brother resides
within three miles of the Court-house, it shall be the duty of
the Woodwards of that Court to visit the brother when sick,
and pay the usual allowance. All expenditure by a Court on
behalf of a District member shall be repaid by the* District not
later than one mouth prior to the next District Meeting. Any
expense incurred beyond 255. per annum for medical attend-
ance and medicine must be defrayed by the brother himself.
SURGEON.
112. Each Court in this District shall elect one Surgeon, but
if it be found necessary, two or more may be elected, but the
election of such extra Surgeons shall be in accordance with
the By-Laws of the Court. No person shall be allowed to act
as medical attendant for any Court in this District who is not,
at the time of his application for such office, in possession of Qualification
his certificate from the Medical Board of Victoria. Upon


production of such qualification, and receiving his appoint-
ment, he shall immediately enter into an agreement in accord-
ance with Schedule E, or such other form of agreement as the
Court shall deem fit; and should he refuse to do so, then his
appointment shall be null and void. Upon completion of such
agreement it shall then be his duty to strictly examine all
candidates for initiation on their application to him, as also
their wives, if required, in accordance with Law 71, free of
any other extra charge than as set forth in such agreement.
Upon receiving from the Court a certificate of initiation of a
member, the Surgeon shall be bound to attend such member,
and likewise his wife (if married), together with their unmarried
children under eighteen years of age, residing within three
miles of the Court-house, in all cases of sickness, and perform-
ance of surgical operations, except as provided in Law 137,
and provide them with proper and sufficient medicine (patent
medicines included, when prescribed), splints, leeches, and
bottles during their affliction, in accordance with his agree-
ment with the Court (accouchements excepted.) The time for
attendance on an accouchement shall be nine days in the case
of a Medical Officer of the Court being engaged for the case,
but should another medical man or midwife be engaged,
twenty-one days shall be allowed before any Medical Officer of
the Court shall be called upon to resume his attendance.
113. He shall attend the sick at their residence when neces-
sary; but should any sick person be able to walk to the
Surgeon?s residence, and it may be proper for him or her so to
do, he or she, as t)ie case may be, shall attend the Surgeon.
Upon the Medical Officer of any Court placing any brother on
the Sick Fund, he shall furnish him with a proper certificate,
which in no case will be allowed to be dated back more than
three days; and if it should appear to him that a member
continues to receive the benefits longer than necessary, it shall
be the Surgeon?s duty to immediately suspend such member,
and notify the same to the Secretary, when the case shall be
brought before the members on the following Court night for
consideration. When there are any sick on the funds it shall
be the duty of the Surgeons to forward to the Court each Court
night a list of such members on their respective lists, with
particulars of each case. In the event of its being necessary
to call in another Surgeon for consultation, the sick person
shall be at the expense of the consultation fee.
114. No Surgeon shall be allowed to enter into any private
contract with any member of the Order or candidate for
admission, but shall either pass or reject the candidate, in
accordance with these Laws.
115. Every Court in this District shall have the privilege of
making such further arrangements as to Surgeon or Surgeons,
and Chemists (by By-law), as they may deem fit, such not
being in contravention of the Laws of the U.M.D, and Friendly
Societies Act.


CHOICE OF SURGEON.
116. Should any financial member of this District find it Member
inconvenient, through distance, to obtain the services of the wishing to
Surgeon or Surgeons of his own Court, or feeling dissatisfied change his
with their skill or attention, can have his name removed from Sur � eon-
the Surgeon?s list and transferred to the Surgeon?s list of any
other Court in the Order, by presenting to the Secretary of his
Court notice of being accepted by such Surgeon, such medical
attendance to be paid for by the brother?s own Court at the
same rate as paid by the Court to which the selected Surgeon
is medical officer; any extra charge which may be incurred
consequent upon such change shall be at the brother?s own
expense, and placed to his account with his contributions in
his own Court. In the event of a Surgeon being selected
whose fees may be less than those to the medical officer of the
selecting member?s Court, the amount payable to such selected
Surgeon, on account of such member, shall be transmitted to
such Surgeon once in each quarter, and the balance placed to
the credit of the member selecting such Surgeon. Any mem-
ber wishing to change his medical attendant shall only be
allowed to do so at the Court night following each Quarterly
Meeting. Should he accept to attend any member or members Attending
of any other Court than that of which he is Surgeon, he shall members of
do so under the same rules and regulations as may be adopted other Courts-
by the Court of which he is medical officer.
That Courts at a distance of five miles or more from
the Melbourne General Post-office, finding it difficult to obtain
the attendance of a sufficient number of members for properly
conducting the business of the Court, shall have the power of
making By-laws to meet the requirements of those cases as to
distance of members resident from the Court-house, and fines
for non-attendance at meetings.


We, the undersigned, Officers and Members of the United
Melbourne District of the Ancient Order of Foresters Friendly
Society, hereby certify that the above alterations and additions
