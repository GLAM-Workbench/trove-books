the only place on the fiest Coast oFdie Bay oF Bengal yhere a vessd above
200 tons can be refitted, or stop her leaks, during the , S. //.''Monsoon ll is always
fin that Monsoon jso smooth in that Bay, that a Ship may ventiae to take a
large keel For the above purpose ; and if occasion required,anM heave down,
Thene are always a greed number ofCaudiers,and Carpenters employed here,
all theyear round,repairing and buildug Chantry vessels. The Orford in
two doss alter her arrival, had between 3d and 40 Caulkers set to work on
her, was on the keel to stop her leaks, and shift some planks, Ford or 7 days,
fin case oFneeessity severed hundred Caulkers and Carpenters could be—
procured along the Coast.Thete is also Timber and -several Stores to be gob:
Wood and Water are ob tallied with con venlmce and facility, and Fresh -
Provision? oFall kinds,was dan established Tort,would be procured in great
quandty. There are besides a great number of Decked Country boats called
would be of infinite service to a Squadron putting diere to reht,
To all those ad vantages,add the vicinity of C oringa River for

I may venture to at Firm, that with a small cape tux, this Port may be
made capable oF giving assistance to a Squadron oFA fen oi war,
in almost all respects.
1 i JFind but one Shoal in die BaycVthe least water on diat is jg Feet 2,
so that the largest Ships have only to Fear this. It is a small Spot,
St A Buoy laid down on it wouldprevent all danger.
Point Gordevaxe has on it '/hire Remarkable fees, and not one near them,

2 r here seems to be one thing waning on this Coast, which a very small
cap cnee would do, and il would be productive oC m/uute advanlages
to the Trade oh dus Country; which is to build on all the Shoal To irds,

The Bore (which if known to he a sudden and abrupt Influx oi 'the'lide into a Inver
orNairowStimts! commences at Ho oglv Point, the place where the River first contracts
dself, and is perceptible tfW-HooglyTown; and so puck is its motion, that rt hardly
employs four- hours in travelling Rom one to the other, although the distance is near
7 o Miles. At Calcutta it sometimes occasions an instantaneous ns eof fire feet.

James Horsburgh.


STRAIT OF MALACCA
Sheet 11.
In this Chart the Coast of Sumatra, and Banks wri ng no us to it are taken from the Charts, and fudged- imperfect;
that part of the toast comprehended in this Chart, btmo at present little known to Europeans.
The Latitudes of the JWneipal Hills and Islands, on the Malay side, and near the common Track; are a mean
of those observed hr Capt. C. C. Mackintosh, and myself. The relative positions of the same , in Longitude;
are tram a Mean of Chronometer Observations; during -the preceding twelve years In’ these persons.
The Malay shore, from the Sambilangs to the South end of P? Call ant, is placed a comparative view
of a manuscript Chart of that part compared with the other Charts published.
The line of direction of the Coast from ( allam south point, to Malacca is placed from Angeles taken of the 4
points, and remarkable Trees 5bc. from various Stations when near the land, in passing through the Straits.
From Malacca to P? Coeob, the line of the Coast is taken from the Charts; and in some places filtered a
little, agneab/v to Chro‘?’ Observations. The North end of the Caiimons, Peaks on Great Carimon, Brothers,
P? Pis any, P? Cocoh, T’anjon y Bonin s, Tree St Red Islands; Sj Johns, and the whole of the remarkable
Rocks, Points and Hills Throughout the Strait of Sincapour, are placed /font Transit bearing's, of when
two objects are in a direct line with the point of view. These Transit hearing's, of the principal Points,
Hills, Islands, and Rocks, having been observed and the Latitude and relative difference of Longitude betiveen
several of them known , constituted a Base, on which the Chart is Constructed.
The Soundings are from the Journals of Capt. C. C. Mackintosh, Barboi’, and my own; and placed from the
hearings of general/v three land objects. There are no Sounding’s taken from am- published Chart.
The Transit hearings of Pa re el a r Hill and the Round Arroa Were obtained ; also of the Two Arroa’s and Rocks
off them, and of P? Jam* and the South Sambiluag, the West point of little Binding, and two Rocks
o/f the Sainbiianys Sec .
The Mark o on points of land, or Summits of Hills, is the point frbm which the bearings were taken; and
the Latitude, and relative Longitude Estimated. '
There is no Variation allowed in Constructing the Chart .
The broad shaded parts of the Coast, n/v fudged a more correct delineation, than those parts shaded narrow.
