I �k7'E London maids attend to me,
London maids attend to me ?
While I relate my nii-ei /,
Thro 5 London Streets I of* have stray i.
But now I am a ( o Tict Maid.
In innocence I once did live,
I \ all the joy that peace could give,
But sin my youthful heart betrayed.
And now I am a Convict Maid.
To wed my lover I did try.
To take my master?s property,
So all my guilt was soo dislayed.
And I became a Convict Maid,
Then I was soon to prison sent.
To wail in fear my punishment.
Then at the bar \ stood dismayed,
since doomed to be a Convict Maid.
At length the Judge did me address,
Whih cfilled with pain my aching breast,
To Botnay Bay you will be conryed,
For seven years a Convict Maid,
� or seven years oh how I sighed.
While my poor mother loudly cried.
My lovei wept, and thus he sail,
May God be with my Convict Maid,
I o you that hear my mournful tak,
Noannnt half aij grief reveal,
sorrow yet has been portrayed,
I ike that of the poor Convict Maid.
Far from my friends and home to ckw,
My punishment is most severe,
My woe is great and Pm afraid,
That I shall die a Convict Maid.
toil each day in grief and pain.
And sleepless thought the night remata.
My constant toils are un repaid.
And wretched is the Convict Maid.
Ob could I but once more be free,
Vd ne?er again a captive be,
Bui would seek some hoa
