IN MEMORIAM.
Eustace William Ferguson, M. 8., Ch.M.," D.P.H.,
Pathologist and ' Naturalist.
(Portrait Plate xx.)


Bom at Invercargill, New Zealand, 1884, Died at Wahroonga, New South
Wales, July 18, 1927.
Scientific circles of Australia are bewailing the tragic loss, at the early age
of forty-two y ars, of a gifted pathologist, an eminent naturalist, and a lovable
personality when Eustace Ferguson, stricken with the dread nephritis, passed
away after a lingering illness of nine months.
A son of the distinguished divine Rev. John Ferguson, he came to Sydney
in 1894 when his father became the minister of St. Stephen’s, Phillip Street.
The writer’s acquaintance with him began when he took the rare part of the few
recorded undergraduates of Sydney University (to that date), who were interested
in the natural history collections left by Sir William Macleay to the grudging
care of that institution. The veteran curator of the Macleay Museum, George
Masters, —a very Nestor of naturalists—at once saw unusual gifts in the young
collector who was bringing rare and novel insects to his notice, and encouraged
him to follow up his congenial pursuit with improved methods. Mr. Masters’s
room was a sort of entomological forum where amateur and professional met,
so that Eustace Ferguson soon became known as an ardent eoleopterist and
collector. Amongst the many companions of my bush rambles in various parts
of Australia I have never met his equal for close observation of natural objects;
his vision apparently combining certain telescopic, as well as microscopic quali-
ties, to which a retentive memory added the power of recalling the form of the
smallest insect he had once examined.
Graduating in 1908 with Honours in Medicine, I heard incidentally that in
that part of the viva voce examination which consisted in distinguishing and
naming microbes and bacilli under the microscope, Eustace was easily first. A
fellow student in his year later told me that in those subjects into which natural
science or any sort of morphology entered Ferguson “set us all a terribly high
standard.”
He lost no time in associating with his brother naturalists, joining the
Linnean Society of New South Wales in June, 1908, and contributing his first
paper a year later on the Amycterinae, or ground weevils (Part 1, Psalidura).
This interesting group of endemic beetles, with a wide range over the whole con-
tinent, had been puzzling previous systematists owing to the species tending to
variation and to resemble their allies. At once his reputation was founded.
Shortly after this I received a letter from the well known Commander J. J.
Walker, R.N. (afterwards President of the Entomological Society of London) in


high praise of the lucid treatment of the subject, and concluding with words to
the effect that we could do with plenty more work of that kind. But already a
physical setback had occurred. His first medical appointment was to act as
locum tenens in a practice on the South Coast (Kiama, I think) and, catching
a chill during night work, endured his first attack of nephritis. For six months
he lay in the Sydney Hospital whence he emerged to recuperate in that natura-
lists paradise Kuranda, North Queensland. Although this had been for years
the hunting ground of the famous collector Mr. F. P. Dodd, and Ferguson was
an invalid, he managed to bring back several species new to science. General
practice being forbidden him, he found suitable occupation in the Department
of Public Health, where his ability as a pathologist made him peculiarly service-
able. In logical sequence he followed up those branches of microbiology and
entomology that were related to medicine, and in addition to his other fields of
work he soon acquired a wide knowledge of fleas, ticks and biting flies. Thus
after completing a masterly revision of the Amycterinae (which Dr. Sharp and
he showed should be correctly styied Phalidurinae) in sixteen papers—eleven
published by the Linnean Society of New South Wales, three by the Royal
Society of Victoria, and two by the Royal Society of South Australia—-he was
busily working at mosquitoes and march flies (Tabanidae). By this time he had
succeeded Dr. (now Professor) Cleland as Principal Microbiologist to the De-
partment, and had married Miss Jessie Perry, daughter of the well known
squatter of the Narromine district. The details of his medical work cannot be
treated here, but especially valuable were the “Tests for the Susceptibility to
Diphtheria/’ organised by him, as well as his “Report on Dengue Fever,” the
latter actually concluded during his final illness.
In 1915 his unselfish patriotism led him to volunteer for medical service at
the Front, and for three years he left his wife and family to serve with the
A.I.F. in England, France, Egypt and Palestine. Characteristically, he was
learning all the time, and finding extraordinary interest in the history and
archaeology of the old world. Thus he visited Scotland, the home of his
fathers, and especially profited by his time in London to work at the British
museum of Natural History, where he made many friends and studied the types
of Australian insects in that institution. In France he found time to study
Roman remains at Nismes and Arles; in the East he became interested in
Aegyptology and the Assyrian relics, and I was amazed to find how deeply he
had delved in the literature and records of these lands. “Ah, but,” said he to
me, pointing to his shelves, “I inherited those books on Assyria from my father
and had already read them as a boy.” After the Armistice he managed to make
a long tour of the Nile and across the Desert to a Red Sea port, besides pene-
trating some way into Mesopotamia. From 1919 onwards he worked steadily at
the Diptera, especially on disease-carrying flies, fleas, also ticks, on which he was
the accepted authority in Australia, so that he was naturally selected to lecture
on this subject at the Pan-Pacific Conference of 1923. He published some half-
dozen papers in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales on
Diptera, chiefly on the Tabanidae and Syrphidae, but his work was not limited
to this. His sound judgment told him that in those groups in which many Aus-
tralian species had a wide distribution outside Australia he would more wisely
enrol the services ofl world specialists to elucidate a firm basis for our know-
ledge; and by sending material to these he was able to communicate no less
than sixteen papers on Australian Diptera to the Linnean Society between the
years 1922-7; also five to Vol. iii. of the “Australian Zoologist.” Of these twelve


are by J. R. Malloch, three by C. P. Alexander, five by Professor Bezzi, and
one by C. H. Curran, and E. H. Bryan.
He was a member of Council and Vice-president of the Royal Zoological
Society of New South Wales, of which he was President in 1922. His presiden-
tial address contained an able plea for a Biological Survey of Australia, and
described in some detail the work of the Bureau of Biological Survey of the
United States of America. His connection with the Linnean Society of New
South Wales was of longer standing, as noted above. He was a member of its
Council from 1921, later a Vice-president, and in 1926 President, in the Novem-
ber of which year he was stricken with his prolonged and fatal illness. He was
an Associate member of the Australian Research Council, a member of the Great
Barrier Reef Committee, and a member of the Royal Society of New South
Wales. His Linnean presidential address was a Review of Medical and Veter-
inary Entomology in Australia, and is a model epitome of work that has done
so much for the safety of man and of domestic animals in tropical and sub-
tropical countries.
He leaves a widow and six children, five sons and a daughter, the last born
during the present year.
