“But nought can break the union
Of hearts in Thee made one;
And love Thy Spirit hallows
Is endless love begun.”


HYMN.
We would see Jesus; for the shadows
We would see Jesus: other lights are paling.

Thee.
We would see Jesus: for life's hand hath
rested,
With its dark touch, upon both heart and
brow;
And though our souls have many a billow
breasted,
Others are rising in the distance now.
We would see Jesus: yet the spirit lingers
Round the dear objects it has loved so
long,
And earth from earth can scarce unclasp its
fingers;
Our love to Thee makes not this love less
strong.
We would see Jesus ; sense is all too blinding,
We would see Jesus, the great rock founda-

INTROIT (Choir only).
Blest are the Departed who in the Lord are sleeping
From henceforth for evermore.
Strength, joy, and willingness come with
the sight.
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading;
Then welcome, day, and farewell, mortal
night.
INVOCATION AND LORD’S PRAYER
HYMN.
Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
Forgive our foolish ways ;
Reclothe us in our rightful mind ;
In purer lives Thy service find,
In deeper reverence, praise.
In simple trust like theirs who heard.
Beside the Syrian sea,
The gracious calling of the Lord,
Let us, like them, without a w T ord
Rise up and follow Thee.
O Sabbath rest by Galilee !
O calm of hills above,
Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee
The silence of eternity,
Interpreted by love !
Willi that deep hush subduing all
Our words and works that drown
The tender whisper of Thy call,
As noiseless let Thy blessing fall
As fell Thy manna down.
Drop Thy still dews of quietness,
Till all our strivings cease ;
Take from our souls the strain and stress,
And let our ordered lives confess
The beauty of Thy peace.
•Breathe through the heats of our desire
Thy coolness and Thy balm ;
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
Speak through the earthquake, wind, and
fire,
O still small voice of calm !


PSALM XXIII. (Repeated by Congregation).
1. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not
2. He maketh me to lie down in green
pastures; he leadeth me beside the still
waters.
3. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me
in the paths of righteousness for his name’s
sake.
4. Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:
for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me.
S. Thou preparest a table before me in
the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest
my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
6. Surely goodness and mercy shall fol-
low me all the days of my life ; and I will
dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND OFFERTORY.
HYMN.
Who fathoms the eternal Thought?
Who talks of scheme and plan?
The Lord is God ! He needeth not
The poor device of man.
And in the maddening maze of things
When tossed by storm and flood,
To one fixed ground my spirit clings
I know that God is good !
I long for household voices gone,
For vanished smiles I long;
But God hath led my dear ones on,
And He can do no wrong.
I know not what the future hath
Of marvel or surprise,
Assured alone that life and death
His mercy underlies.
And if my heart and flesh are weak
To bear an untried pain.
The bruised reed He will not break,
But strengthen and sustain.
No offering of my own I have,
Nor works my faith to prove;
I can but give the gifts He gave.
And plead His love for love.
And so beside the silent sea
I wait the muffled oar;
No harm from Him can come to me
On ocean or on shore.
I know not where His islands lift
Their fronded palms in air ;
I only know I cannot drift
Beyond His love and care.
And Thou, O .Lord, by whom are seen
Thy creatures as they be,
Forgive me, if too close I lean
My human heart on Thee !

PERSONAL TRIBUTE TO THE LATE MRS. WILLIAMS.
Rev. B. R. Wyllie, M.A , B.D.


HYMN.
O Love, that will not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee;
I give Thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.
O light, that followest all my way,
I yield my flick’ring torch to Thee ;
My heart restores its borrow’d ray,
That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.
O Joy, that seekest me thro’ pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee;
I trace the rainbow thro’ the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be.
O Cross, that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from thee ;
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms
Life that shall endless be.
