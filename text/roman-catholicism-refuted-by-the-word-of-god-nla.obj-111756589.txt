ROMAN CATHOLICISM REFUTED
BY THE WORD OF GOD;
Being DISCUSSIONS, at the Protestant Hall, between Mr. D. ALL3JN and
Mr. SERVICE,, on May Ist, 3rd, Bth, and 10th, upon the Conversion,
Redemption, and Justification of Sinners, and the Glorification of Saints,
By D. ALLEN,
(pastor of ebenezEe baptist chapel.)
INTRODUCTION.
In publishing the following, it behoves me to state briefly the facts that have led
to the discussion. These may be summed up as follows :
1. —The cause of it; Mr. Service came to the Market-place to oppose the doc-
trine I teach, which he thinks to be error; and some few weeks back, before
many persons, offered to prove them to be so. I then felt myselt called upon to
defend the truth I had preached, which results in this meeting for the purpose of
discussing the subjects before named on the bills.
2. The Points are, what the Prophets, Apostles, Ancient Fathers, and
Reformers earnestly contended for as the faith once delivered to the saints. The
errors which I oppose are the same as those they have opposed in all ages, as held
by the Church of Rome and others.
3. —The conduct which I hope to manifest will not, I trust, be unbecoming the
solemn subjects to be considered. Wit, satire, and sarcasm, turbulence and
noise, do not become the sacred things of God : these I hope to avoid, as being
below a Christian and a man. I will strive to speak and to behave in a godly
manner. Some people do not like controversy, but the Old and New lestaments
are full of it; the truths Of the Bible have been kept somewhat pure by contro-
versy, as the waters of seas, rivers, and lakes, are kept pure by motion, whilst
still waters become impure.
FIRST DISCUSSION, MAY 1, 1861.
SUBJECT.
By Mr. Service—That the Conversion of Sinners is effected by the Word
or God Alone.
By Mr. Allen—That the Conversion of Sinners is effected by the Word
and the Power of the Holy Spirit.
Mr. Service means that conversion is effected by the word of God alone, with-
out any influence of the Spirit, for the Word is not an influence of the Spirit
without the power of the Spirit. A man who makes a sword does not consider it
has any influence in the field of battle without his arm: None die by it, none
fear it —it is a thing, not an influence. So the Word of God is the sword of the
Spirit. He made it (2 Tim. iii., 16, 2 Peter i., 20). This of itself, alone, is not
an influence, but a thing, (Heb. viii., 1) “Now, of the things of which we have
spoken.” Therefore, the word does nothing alone in conversion, no more than
the sword alone in the field. But the Spirit taking the Word, (at first inspired by
Him), by his own power, into the hearts of poor sinners, as the mighty hand takes
the sword and by it goes on to victory, even so the Word, by this immediate in-
fluence of the Spirit, becomes the power of God unto salvation to every one that
believes (1 Cor. ii., 4, Acts xviii., 7, Luke iv., 32-6, v., 17). The pipes from the
reservoir to Melbourne are not an influence, but inanimate things, and would of
themselves, alone, do Melbourne no good. It is the water that converts the city
from a dust-hole into a palace of pleasantness—from thirst to saturation—from
misery to cheerfulness —from death to life.
This is just how 7 the Lord himself hath figured forth this subject in Zech. iv., 6 ;
I.—You see, in verse 2, the candlesticks and the pipes, the churches of God and
the ministers thereof. All these cannot convert darkness into light alone.


2. —The golden bowl upon the top of all these former. This is Christ in his
prophetic character, having the fulness of the Spirit to shed forth upon the
Church.
3. —The two olive trees by the side of the bowl —-His office as priest and kingf;
or, the Father as God and the Word as God, through the two golden pipes of the
Old and New Testaments, conveying the very influence for which I contend.
4. 'Ae golden oil. Now we can clearly see in all these that there is no in-
fluence of the Spirit—the word alone. Darkness is not converted into light by
these. The golden oil is required to do this ; and this golden oil is the influence
of the Holy Spirit—the “ Holy oil ” (Psalm Ixxxix., 20), “ Oil of gladness ”
>(Psalm xlv. 7, Heb. i., 8, John i., 33). All the fulness of the Spirit was given to
Him, and of His fulness we receive (John i. 14): This makes Him Christ,
Messiah, Anointed; and it is the receiving of this golden oil from Him that
makes Christians (John ii., 20-7, iii. 24, Isa. xliv. 3) —this converts a person from
being a heathen man and an idolater into a Christian ; and this is not by might
nor by power, but “ by my Spirit,” saith the Lord (Zech. iv., 6) —not by the mere
pipes of the Word, but by the golden oil running through them.
As all men by nature are said to be possessed of Satan before conversion, and
that by conversion Satan is cast out, and as Satan was thus cast out ill the
preaching of the Lord Jesus, by the Holy Ghost, how is it possible that the Word
alone should cast out devils, as preached by his servants.
That we are possessed by Satan is evident from Ephes. ii., 2. That Jesus cast
out Satan by the Spirit is certain, from Matt, xii., 28-9, Jer. xxx., 16, xxxi, 11.
The Lord Jesus did this with a word; but not with a word alone, but the Holy
Spirit went with the Word, and cast out Satan, and took the poor sinner for His
own habitation (Cor. vi., 19) —thus the dead is changed to life, to be lively stones,
built up a spiritual house (1 Pet. ii., 5, Ephes. ii., 22.)
“Of His own will begat he us by the word of truth” (James i., 17). This
is brought forth by Mr. Service to prove that the letter of the Gospel converts
to God alone ; but in these words is the first efficient cause of the new birth, viz.,
“the will of God”; 2ndly, the instrumental cause, viz., “ the word of truth.”
Abraham had two sons, one by a bondwoman, the other by a free woman. Was
Sarah Isaac’s creator, or the instrument by whom he came into being ? Was Hagar
Ishmael’s creator, or the instrument by whom he came into being ? (Gal. iv., 22).
God is the first moving and efficient cause, Abraham the procuring cause, and the
woman the instrumental cause. Just so the Holy Spirit, in the new birth, is the
great efficient life-giving cause, the Word of the Gospel is the instrumental cause,
and new creatures are the effect of such life-giving power and instrumentality.
Thus, Eve is said to be ‘‘the mother of all living” (Gen. hi., 20). Do we
understand by this that Eve is the creator of all living ? or that she was the instru-
ment by whom all come into being or existence ? If the former, then the Word of
God by Elihu (Job xxxiii., 4) is false —“ The Spirit of God hath made me, and
the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.” God is not the author of con-
fusion —to make first the woman the creator of mankind, and then declare himself
the only creator of man; but in the one passage we have the instrument spoken
of, in the other the Almighty Power by which man alone is created. Every
person is born into the world by their parents ; but who would ever think that their
parents were their creators, and understand by the passage, “Remember thy Creator
in the days of thy youth, ” that their mother and father was intended. So, is it not
foolish, if not wicked, to ascribe the new birth to the Word of the Gospel as the
efficient cause, and so deny the operations of the Spirit in that great work, thus
making God the author of falsehood and confusion, who saith, “ The wind bloweth
where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it
cometh nor whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.” Now this
is false if it is of the Word, not of the Spirit: but if you take the same view of
this matter as you do in the natural creation —Eve and other parents the instru-
ments, and God the cause—you will have harmony and order : the Word the in-
strument, the Holy Spirit the cause—this is order.
But even this seems to be beyond the meaning of the Word in the text, viz.,
“with.’ The word “by” often means a living, acting agent; but the word
“ with” usually means, a dead instrument, a tool, as,in Genesis xlviii., 22, Jacob
said to Joseph, “ Moreover, I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the hand of the Amorite “ with my sword and with my bow.”
Now, was Jacob’s sword and bow the power by which this victory was wrought,
or was it the strength of his arm, and these the instruments only : So in our text,
the sovereign will and divine power of God are the strength by which the new
birth takes place, and the Word of Truth is the instrument he useth to that end.


Was Goliah’s sword sufficient to cut off his head without David’s arm ? or was
one the power, and the other the instrument “with” which he did it: So, we
ask, Is the Word of the Gospel the power by which the new birth is effected, or
the instrument to that end? “So is every one that is born of the spirit,” is the
arm ; and, “ With the Word of Truth,” is the sword and bow by which the vic-
tory is obtained over sin, Satan, and the world: and so the sinner is translated out
of the kingdom of darkness into God’s marvellous light. It is said that, when
some saw Scandenburg’s sword, they remarked, “Did he conquer so much
‘with’that?” He answered them thus, “ It was not my sword, but my arm
that conquered: ” So, it is not the word of God, but the Almighty Spirit of God
that conquers in the new birth, “ with the Word of Truth.” According to Mr.
Service’s doctrine, neither our nation nor any other ought to be spending so many
millions of money for soldiers as they have done and are now doing. They should
only make the cannons, muskets, and swords, and send them off into the battlefield,
to go on to victory; for, according to his doctrine, they want no influence, no
power, no life, no arm, to use them—they are quite sufficient of themselves.
But who is so foolish as to do so ? Men of might, skill, and valor, grasp them,
and for their sovereigns will go forth to conquer “with” the sword and gun, as
the instruments only in so great a work. Thus, also, the weapons of our warfare
are not carnal, but mighty through god to the pulling down of the strongholds
of sin and Satan (2 Cor. x., 4).
It appears to me to be most monstrous to suppose that the mere Word of God
alone should accomplish such mighty works in creation as are sometimes in the
Scriptures ascribed to it. Thus, in creation, he said, “ Let there be light,” and
there was light. Was it the mere words that created the light, or the almighty
power of Jehovah that went out with the Word? as it is written, “By the Word of
the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the Spirit of His
mouth” (Psalm xxxiii., 6). Even so, when in grace He passes by a poor sinner,
dead in sins and in the natural blood of his pollution, and says, “Live,” “ Yea,
I say unto you live” (Ezek. xvi., 6). Is the life in and from the words only, or
in the power of the life-giving Spirit, and from His divine influence. If the
energy is in the Word, without the secret influence, then why does not the
the repeating of the words turn dead sinners to life ? why do the thousands of
mankind remain still dead who hear these so often in the preaching of the Gospel ?
why does not Mr. Service go to the houses of death and mourning and restore
the dead to life, if the Word is sufficient. “Young man, arise”—wdiy does he
not go and raise the much mourned for son of distressed parents, if the mere
Word is able? Why does he behold the mourners around the lifeless damsels of
our city, and not go to each and pronounce the words “Damsel, arise?” Why
does he not say to each of our dead and stinking Lazar uses in sin, “ Lazarus,
come forth ” ? No, he cannot do so ; for with the words must go forth life-giving
power from God the Holy Spirit; and, with that, the Gospel is the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believeth (Rom. i;, 14), and it has great and
precious promises, that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature
(2 Pet. i., 2).
God sent Moses to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt; but did Moses do
it with his own might? or did God do it with his glorious arm ? If Moses did it,
wdry did he with them want to cry so often for help ? and why did the Lord say,
“ Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord” ? and why did he and they give all
the glory to God, as in Exod. xv. and Psalms. So Paul was God’s messenger to do
these things (Acts xxvi., 18); the truths of the Gospel were his tools (2 Cor. x.,
4); the power was of God (1 Cor. hi., 6).
Now that w r e have made it clear that the Gospel, and the ministers of it, are
only the instruments of God in regeneration, we shall next prove that Jehovah is
the great moving cause of this work. In John i., 14, the regenerate are said to be
“born of God; and, in chap, hi., 3, “born again,” “born from above”; ver. 5,
“of water and of the Spirit” ; ver. 6, “that which is born of the spirit is spirit ” ;
yer. 2, “ born of the spirit” ; in ver. 27, “a man cannot receive anything except
it be given him from heaven; as, in James i., 17, and Titus hi., 5, the washing
and renewing of the Spirit is said to be the cause ; as in 1 Cor. vi., 11, washed and
sanctified by the Spirit in the name of the Lord; and in 2 Thes. ii., 13, they are
said to be chosen to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of
the truth; so, also, ini Peter i., 3, as in Ezek. xxxvi., 27, xxxvii., 14, “I will put
my Spirit in you.”
From these it will be most evident that the Holy Spirit is the great moving
cause of regeneration, and the Word of Truth the instrument with which He
does it, as in 1 Thes. i., 5, “For our Gospel came not unto you in word only, but
in power and in the Holy Ghost,” and in Rom. xv., 16, you have the living agent—


the minister of the Gospel; and the instrument with which he works—the Gos-
pel ; and the all-efficacious power that performeth the work, “ That I should be
the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles —ministering the Gospel of God, that
t. e offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy
Ghost.” This is God’s order, and Satan cannot reverse it; hence, those to whom
the Holy Ghost makes manifest His regenerating power through the Gospel are
said to be saved, and have the light to shine into their hearts, and the others are
said to be the lost and blinded (2 Cor. iv., 3-6).
The following are a few passages of the Word of God showing that the worlds
were made by the power of God, through His Word, and not by the Word alone,
so that we may see the harmony between the Word and the Power: —
I.—Notice the words “ through faith, we understand the worlds w r ere framed
by the Word of God” (Heb. xi., iii, with 2 Peter iii., 5), This does not make
void or contradict
2. —“ The Word.” All things were made by Him, and without Him was not
anything made that was made (John i., 3, also, Col. i., 16 ; Heb. i., 3).
3. —“By His power he brought in the south wind” Psalm Ixxii, 26), “He
hath shewed His people the power of His works ” (Psalm cxi., 6). “ Por the in-
visible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being under-
stood by the things which are made, even His eternal power and godhead”
(Bora, i., 20), Thus, the word and rower agree. Now, in the next class you
have the energy of the Holy Spirit spoken of, which is the power that accom-
panied the Word and made it effectual.
4. —“By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of
them by the breath (spirit) of His mouth” (Psalm xxxiii., 6). “By His Spirit
He hathgarnished the heavens” (Job xxvi., 13). “Praise Him in the firmament
of His power” (Psalm cl., 1). “The voice of the Lord is powerful” (Psalm
xxix., 4).
The same order is found in the Word of God in the spiritual creation :
1. —Notice the words, “ Of His own will begat he us by the Word of Truth ”
(James i., 18), The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation (Rom. i., 16) ;
the Word is quick and powerful (Heb. iv., 12) ; born of the Word (1 Peter i., 23);
sanctified by the Word—John xvii., 17, Eph. v., 26.
2. —“The Word.” “The Son quickeneth whom He will”—John v., 24;
“ Thou hast given Him power over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as
many as Thou hast given him”—John xvii., 2; He is called “a quckening
Spirit”—l Cor. xv., 45.
3. —“The Power.” We have this treasure in earthen vessels, “that the excel-
lency of the power may be of God, and not of us”—2 Cor. iv., 7, Rom. ix., 21 ;
** Hath not the potter power over the clay ” —2 Peter i., 3. According as His
divine power hath given us all things that pertain to life and godliness.
4. —The Spirit’s energy is that power—“ Which are born, not of men or blood,
or will of man, but of God”—John i., 14; “Born from above”—John iii., 3;
“ Born of the Spirit”—John iii., 5; “ That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit ”
John iii.. 8 ; So is every one that is born of the Spirit, “ that the Gentiles might
be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost”—Rom. xv., 16, 1 Thes. L, 5;
“For our Gospel came not unto you in word only, but in power and in the Holy
Ghost,” and the result was “ ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and
true God”—v. 9, 1 Cor. ii., 4; “And my speech and preaching was not with
enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of
power ” —Acts xviii., 8. This shows how the Corinthians were converted.
Now we shall show that all that Mr. Service says should precede the receiving
of the Holy Spirit comes after, as the result and effect of a poor sinner’s receiving
the Holy Spirit.
1. —Conversion, from a child of the devil to be a child of God is by the Holy
Spirit,—Rom. viii., 14, Gal. iv., 5; “In this is manifest the children of God—
-1 John iii., 10.
2. —Conversion from darkness to light. “Ye were sometimes darkness, but now
light in the Lord ” —Matt, xi., 24, 2 Cor. iii., 16-11; “ the eyes of your understanfl-
ing being opened”—Ephes. i.. 18.
3. —Hardness of heart to godly repentance, —Ezek. xxxvi., 26, Zech. xii, 10,
Job xxiii.,'l6, Acts xi, 17-18 ; “ Gave them the like gift,” viz., of the Holy Spirit.
“ Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.”
4. —From unbelief to faith, —Ephes. i., 19, 2 Cor. 4, 13, 1 Cor. xii., 9, Gal.
v., 22, 1 John v., 1; without which none can call Jesus Lord, —1 Cor. xii., 3.


5. —From uncleanness to purity, Ezek. xxxvi,, 26; the unclean are described,
Titus i. 15; clean, iii. 5 ; by the Word —John xvii., 17, Ephes. v., 26 ; the Holy
Spirit—l Cor. vi., 11, Acts xv., 9, 1 Peter i., 23, v. 3. This alone makes sinners
saints—■“ called to be saints.”
6.—From despair to hope. “Saved by hope”—Rom. viii., 24; That blessed
hope—l John iii., 3 ; which we have as an anchor —Heb. vi., 19 ;is by the Holy
Ghost—Rom. xv., 13. “ That we may abound in hope by the power of the Holy
Ghost.”
7. —From an unholy life to a holy life —1 John iii., 3-9, v., 4, iv., 13. Baptism
follows after the gift of the Spirit—Acts x. 47, ii. 41.
8. —From hatred to love —Titus iii., 3 ; hatred, 1 Peter i., 23 ; love, Rom. v., 5,
1 Thes. iii., 12, 2 Thes. iii., 5, 1 John iv., 7, iii., 14; the fruit of the Spirit is
love —Gal. v., 32.
9.—From death to life. See the vision of dry bones; these are the members of
Christ—Ephes. v., 30, 1 Cor. xii., 12. Ezekiel was to preach the Word, which
did not give life; but when breath came they lived and stood up—Ezek. xxxvii.,
14. This breath is the energy of the Spirit of God ! —John iii. 8.
How dreadful, then, must be Mr. Service’s doctrine, which thus denies the Word
of God declared by Prophets, Apostles, and the Ancient Elders—the Reformers,
and all the godly in this and every age, accounting all the prayers that are offered
to God for the conversion of sinners lay the power of the Holy Ghost, and all the
testimonies of those that ascribe their conversion to the Holy Ghost, mere non-
sense. I pray the Lord to deliver us from so unscriptural a doctrine.
SECOND DISCUSSION, MAY 3, 1861.
SUBJECT:
By Mr. Service—That Christ died for the whole Human Race.
By Mr, Allen.—That Christ did not die for the whole Human Race, but
for Special Characters.
Mr. Service, proceeded, from John iii. 16, to prove that the words, “ World, ’
and “ The whole world,” meant “ the whole human race.” But it will soon be
evident, from the Word of God, that they mean no such thing; their design being
to break down the middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles—Ephes. ii.
14. “ Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold, them also I must bring.”—
John x. 16; this cannot mean the goats—Matt. xxv. 33 ; the swine and dogs—
-2 Peter ii., 22; of whoredom, murder, covetousness, drunkenness, and theft—
-1 Co. vi., 8, Gal. v., 21, Rev. xxi., 27, xxii., 15; who were ordained to such
condemnation —Jude 4, Rom. ix. 22, 1 Peter ii., 8 : This is the world condemned
(1 Cor. vi., 2) “The saints shall judge the world.”
1. —The “world” here must exclude the saints by whom the world is judged.
2. —John v. 19, “ The whole world lieth in wickedness.” This must exclude
all who are delivered from this world—Gal. i., 4. Let us not twist the Word of
God.
3. —Rev, xii. 9, “ Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.” This must
exclude the elect of God, whom it is not possible to deceive—Matt. xxiv. 24;
this must exclude the whole Church of Christ—Matt. xvi. 18. According to Mr.
Service’s doctrine, all the Church is damned. Look at the deceived and not
deceived —Matt. xi. 25, John xii. 40, Acts xxviii. 24, 2 Cor. iv. 3, 2 Thes. ii. 11.
Here is a whole world deceived, and a world of special characters saved from
that deception. The awful doctrine I oppose either shows that all God’s redeemed
are lost, or that Christ’s death is inefficacious; for, if the “world” mean the
whole human race, then these are deceived and lost. How awful! And if He
died for them, and they are lost, His death is of no avail, which assumption is
blasphemous.
4. —Rev- xiii. 3, “And all the world wondered after the beast.” This must
exclude those who do not worship him (ver. 15), whose names are in the book of
life—Rev. xxi. 27, Phil. iv. 3. “ That follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth”—
Rev. xiv. 4. These are all excluded from the “whole world’’ that wonder after
the beast, whose names are not written in the book of life, written from the foun-
dation of the world —Rev. xiii. 8, xvii. 2, xx. 15. Let Mr. S. sit in judgment on
>d’s conduct, if he dare so arraign God at His bar.


Now, therefore, if the vast multitudes of God’s elect, redeemed, called, praying,
repenting, believing, justified, holy living, and finally glorified people, are ex-
cluded from the words, “ world ” and “ the whole world,” in these places, with
,many more like them; so, also, on the other hand, the “ world condemned, ” the
‘ world lying in wickedness,” the “ world deceived,” and the world that “ wonders
after the beast,” are excluded from the world loved (John iii., 16), reconciled
(2 Cor. v. 19), and saved (1 John ii. 2). This is better than trying to represent
God as contradicting himself, or making the death of Christ of no avail.
THE WORDS “ALL” AND ‘‘ALL MEN.”
These words, in 1 Timothy ii. 4-6, Rom. v. 18, and other places like them, are
designed to break down the Jewish notion of their being the only favored people,
and that the Gentiles were excluded from God’s mercy, as may be seen in Acts
x. 28 ; yet, from these words must be excluded all who live and die ungodly, for
Peter only includes in them “he that feareth God and worketh righteousness”—•
ver. 35. So we shall find the word “ all ” used in the following places, as on the
whole world.
1. —Gen. vi. 13, “End of all flesh ; ” but Noah and all his family were excluded
as, “ all in the ark ” (vii. 8) ; “and all flesh died that moved upon the earth.’’
Those who were in the ark were excluded.
2. —“I will pour my spirit upon all flesh’’ (Joel ii. 28, Acts ii. 17) —only 3,000
on that occasion, with the Apostles, and many thousands afterwards of all men,
to the exclusion of many of whom it was said, “ These be they who separate
themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit;” but, according to Mr. Service’s
doctrine, these all have the Spirit. “ Upon all flesh ; ” therefore “ all ” signifies
some of all kindreds, tongues, and people (Acts ii. 8).
4. —.Luke iii. 6, “And all flesh shall seethe salvation of God.” This excludes
all that never heard the Gospel of Jesus crucified ; for, “ if they had known Him
they would not have crucified Him” (1 Cor. ii. 8). He is hid from some and
revealed to others (Matt, xi., 24). Therefore, all flesh signifies ‘ some of all
nations —the Gentile world.
5. —ln Mark i. 5, it is stated of John, “ There went out to Him all Judea, and
were all baptized of him in the River Jordan.” But many were excluded from
this all (see Luke iii. 7, vii. 29-30). Mr. S. would include these monsters in this
“All.”
6. In Matt. x. 22, Jesus said to His disciples, “Ye shall be hated of all men.”
The saints are excluded from this all, for they loved them fervently (1 Peter i.
22). Mr. Service would make the saints to hate one another, if “All men”
means the whole human race.
7. —Mark i. 37, “ All men seek Thee.” Thousands were excluded who received
Him not —John i. 12.
8. —John iii. 26, John’s disciples said, Jesus baptizeth, “ and all men come to
Him ; ” but thousands are excluded who never came to Him —John v. 40. Mr.
S. includes all haters and rejecters of Christ.
9. —2 Cor. iii. 2. “Ye are our epistles, known and read of all men”—but few
knew them.
10. —3 John 12, “Demetrius hath good report of all men’’—but few men
knew him ! Now, therefore, as in all these places thousands are excluded from
these words “ all men,” so in other places, where the same words occur, those who
never heard of Christ, or loved or believed in Him, but lived and died ungodly,
are excluded.
UPON THE WORDS “ EVERY MAN.”
As in Ileb. ii., 9,—“That He by the grace of God should taste death for every
man” or, as Mr. Service reads it in the Greek text, “every one. ” This means
ALL and EVERY ONE of the SONS (verse 10) who are one with Him, sanctified by
Him (ver. 11), His brethren (ver. 12), His children (ver. 13), in fear of death
(ver. 15), them that are tempted (ver. 18) to the exclusion of the children of
the devil (1 John iii. 10, John viii. 44, vi. 70). The words ‘every one’ are
applied to the redeemed of Christ in all nations of the Gentiles, to break down
Jewish seclusionism ; and in the following places you will see the words used in
the same order and way :
1. “ All flesh died on earth, and every man ” (Gen. vii. 21). Eight persons
were excluded here from “ every man.”
2. —Luke xvi. 16, “ The kingdom of God is preached and ‘ every man ’ presseth
into it; ” but every' man not born of the Spirit is excluded (John iii. v.) Mr.
Service’s doctrine makes every ungodly monster to be meant.


3. —Acts iv. 35, they “ parted to every man as he had need.” This excluded all
the ungodly, and only included the godly present at that time. Mr. S. will have
that it means all the ungodly also.
4. —Rom. xii. 3, “ Think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the
measure of faithbut all unbelievers are excluded, for “ all men have not faith ”
(2 Thes. iii. 2). Mr. S. is so in union with these ungodly men, that he will have
them in “ every man ’ for whom Christ died.
5. —I. Cor. iv. 5, “Then shall every man have praise of God ” This excludes
all evil doers—condemned.
6. —2 Cor. iv. 2, “ Commending ourselves to every man’s conscience.” This
excludes every natural man (ii. 14).
7. —Col. i. 28, “Teaching every man in all wisdom.” Thousands are excluded
being ignorant (Rom. x. 3).
Now, therefore, is it not better to understand the above text as all these 7,
viz., to exclude all the ungodly, abominable, filthy, of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
such like, who live and die so hating and crucifying the Lord in His Members.
It is awful to say Christ agonized in death for these, and that His death is in vain,
ineffectual, and void. And that in these words is included all the above special
characters for whom He died, and gave Himself a ransom, and who do not fail of
seeing the travail of His soul, and with whom he is satisfied (Isa. liii. 11); and so
His death is all-efficacious and availing to save His redeemed.
SOME MOST POSITIVE EVIDENCE FROM THE WORD OF GOD THAT GOD GAVE HIS SON
TO DIB FOR, AND THAT HE REALLY DID ONLY DIE TO REDEEM, SPECIAL CHA-
RACTERS CALLED
1. —“Elect” (1 Peter i. 2), “according to the fore-knowledge of God the
Father;” redeemed (ver. 18); (Rom. viii. 33) “Who shall lay anything to their
charge ? ”
2. — “Predestinated” (Rom. viii. 32) ; He spared not His own Son for them
(ver. 30), These are in the likeness of Christ (ver. 29), by His Spirit (2 Cor. iii. 18).
But those who are found in the image of satan are said, in distinction from these,
to be ordained unto wrath (Jude 4, 1 Peter ii. 8, Rom. ix. 22).
3. —“ Chosen. ” (Ephes. i. 3), “ According as He hath chosen us in Him before
the foundation of the world;” (2 Thes. ii. 13), “God hath from the beginning
chosen you to salvation.” But He said He never knew the wolves: (Matt. vii. 23),
“ Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.”
4. —“His People.” (Matt. i. 23), “His name shall be called Jesus, for He
shall save His people from their sins ; “ We are thine;” (Isa. Ixiii. 19), “They
shall be my people.” But of others it is said, “They were not called by Thy
name (Isa. Ixiii. 19).
5. —“Heirs of God,” (Rom. viii. 17) ; “Heirs of God and joint heirs with
Christ” (ver. 3 Re., Gal. iv, 7), “An heir of God through Christ ” (ver. 5 Re.,
Heb. vi. 17), “ Heirs of promise ” (vii. 25). But of the wicked it is said, “He that
made them will not have mercy upon them” (Isa. xxvii. 11).
6. —“A peculiar People.” (Titus ii. 14), “Zealous of good works,” as dis-
tinct from the disobedient; (1 Peter ii. 8-9), “ an holy nation,” “ a peculiar people,”
to show forth His praise. “But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected,
and is nigh unto cursing.” (Heb. vi. 8).
PARTICULAR REDEMPTION, IN SPECIAL CHARACTERS,
These lie all along the glorious line of divine revelation, with names descriptive
of their state, feelings, disposition, and condition ; such as the following :
1. —“Thirsting after God” (Psalm Ixiii. 1,) “As the hart panteth after the
water brooks” ( Psalm xlii., 1,) —To whom the Promise is made “ I the Lord
will hear them” (Isa xli., 17,) “I will pour water upon him” (Isa. xliv., 3,)
to whom the invitation is given, “ O, every one that thirsteth, come to the water,”
(Isa. Iv. 1) ; but some blaspheme the Lord (Isa. xxxvii. 6), upon whom He sends
His blasts (ver. 7).
2. —They are broken-hearted. “A broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou
wilt not despise” (Psalm li. 17), “The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a
broken heart” (Psalm xxxiv. 18), “To these the promise is made” (Isa. Ivii. 15),
“With him will I dwell to revive him; To these the Gospel of salvation is sent”
(Isa. Ixi. 2), “ Hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted ; but some hearts are
hardened (Rom. ix. 18), and are destroyed (ver. 22).
3. —Hungering and thirsting after righteousness (Isa. li. 1), “ Hearken unto mo,


ye that follow after righteousness ” (Matt. v. 6), with many other of their sacred
names. To these the promise is made, (ver. 5) “My righteousness is near, my
salvation is gone forth, and to these the Gospel of salvation is sent (Matt. v. 1 to
14); but there is a generation pure in their own eyes, yet not washed from their
filthiness (Prov. xxx. 12), these are cast out (Rev. xxii. 11-15), ignorant of God’s
righteousness (Rom. x. 3, ix. 33).
4.—Lost sinners. “I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel”
(Matt. xi. 24, Matt, xviii. 11), “ for the Son of Man is come to save that which is
lost” (Luke xv., v. 32), “ I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repen-
tance” (1 Tim. i. 15), but some say they are not so (Luke xv. 29), “Neither
transgressed lat any time.” Some trusted in themselves that they were righteous
(Luke xviii. 9, xvi. 15), these are sent empty away (Luke i. 53), and destroyed
(Matt. xxii. 13),
SOME AWFUL CONSEQUENCES OF UNIVERSAL REDEMPTION.
1. —lt represents God as putting his dear Son to death for thousands of many
nations to whom He never sent His Holy Word to inform them of it, —who have
been suffered to walk in their own way, and have perished in their sin (Ezek.
xxxii. 29, 27, 24).
2. —lt represents God putting to death His own dear Son for the old world of
the ungodly—the Sodomites, Abiram, Dathan, and their company, with all the
nations that have lived and died in all manner of filthiness, and blasphemy, and
idolatry; in respect to whom, Christ agonized in death, in the shedding His
precious blood, all in vain.
3. —lt represents God the Father as most unjust, in first laying the sins of the
whole human race on Christ (Isa. liii), and inflicting upon Him all the stripes due
to them ; and then again laying them on the sinner, and punishing him in hell for
ever for the very sins Christ bare, and endured the punishment of. O, awful reflec-
tion upon God!
4. —lt represents Christ’s death as of no efficacy, and that He does not receive of
the travail of His soul (Isa. liii. 11); and then, if not, how can he be satisfied?
What! satisfied to die the awful death of Calvary—to sweat tremendous drops of
blood in His agony in the garden, for His seed—His children, and then satisfied to
see the half of them in hell, weeping in eternal fire, and He in heaven ? What!
satisfied to endure the vengeance of eternal fire for them, and then judge them to
the vengeance of eternal fire afterwards ? This must be a most monstrous and
dreadful Christ-dishonoring doctrine which so teaches.
5. —lt is a positive contradiction of the words of Christ, “ I give unto them
eternal life, and they shall never perish” (John x. 28), and in Matt, xvi, 16,
“ Upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.” The Church is the bride of Christ, for whom He died (Ephes. v. 25,
Rev. v. 9, vii. 9, xix. 7.
6. —lt therefore represents Christ as robbed of His bride, and spoiled of the
only-beloved of His heart—whom He redeemed, but whom He must see in these
torments for ever: From which dreadful doctrine, O Lord, deliver us and constrain
all men to abhor the same. Amen-
THIRD DISCUSSION MAYS, 1861,
SUBJECT:
By Mr. Allen —That Sinners are justified by Faith alone in the
RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CIIRIST.
By Mr. Service—That Sinners are not justified by Faith alone in the
Righteousness of Christ, but also by inward Grace and outward Works
and Ordinances.
The doctrine I stand here to defend has been the main doctrine of patriarchs,
prophets, Christ, apostles, ancient fathers, and the reformers—-with which they
withstood the false prophets, in the old world; pharisees, scribes, and priests, in
the days of Christ and the apostles; and the first antichrists in the Christian era,
and the Church of Rome during the dark ages of persecution ; and the very cor-
ner-stone of the Reformation, by which it was commenced and carried on: in one
word, the doctrine I now stand in defence of is the very foundation of the hope
and faith of the Chuix of God.


The doctrine I now oppose is the very foundation of the Church of Rome. For
the proof of this, I here give an extract from the Council of Trent, which was
called to curse the reformers and their doctrines : “ If any shall say the ungodly
is justified by faith only, and that it is by no means necessary that he dispose and
prepare himself by the motions of his own will, let such an one be accursed.”
“ If any one shall affirm that good works do not preserve and increase justifica-
tion, but that good works are only the fruits and evidences of justification already
had, let such an one be accursed.” “If any one shall affirm that justifying faith
is no more than a reliance on the mercy of God as forgiving our sins for Christ’s
sake, or that they are justified by such a reliance, let such an one be accursed.” “If
any shall affirm that man is either justified by the imputed righteousness of Christ
alone, or by a mere remission of sin—to the exclusion of inherent grace and
charity, shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost, —or shall say that the alone
bounty of God is the grace by which he is justified, let him be accursed.”
From this it will be evident that the doctrine of the reformers, with the prophets
and Apostles which Rome here curses, was:—lst, the love or grace of God, the first
moving cause of a sinner’s justification, (Rom. iii. 24,) “ being justified freely by
His grace” ; 2nd, the life and death of Christ the procuring cause of a sinner’s
justification, “Through the redemption which is in Christ, ” —(Rom. v. 9,) “Much
more then being now justified by His blood we shall be saved from wrath through
Him ” ; and, thirdly, Faith, the instrumental cause of a sinner’s justification.
Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the
law —Rom. iii. 28, 30. Believing sinners, as the church of God, are called the bride
of Christ—“prepared as a bride adorned for her husband” (Rev.xxi. 2,) —the
justifying righteousness of Christ is the robe in which she is dressed, (Isa. Ixi. 10.)
Now, mark, neither faith, hope, nor love form any part of the robe, but faith is,
as it were, the ladies’ maid that receives the heavenly dress from the King Immortal
and puts it upon His Queen (Psalm xlv. 6to 11, 13, 14) . “ Therefore, being jus-
tified by faith we have peace with God,” (Rom. v. 1,4, 11 ),
My hearers, or readers, will, by this time, see why the Papist has ever been so
much against justification by the righteousness of Christ imputed unto all them
that believe, viz., because it destroys their works of supererogation—the holiness,
or rather unholiness of their nunneries, monasteries, saints, popes, bishops, priests,
masses, prayers, and penances, and makes them all nothing more than filthy rags—.
“ But we are all as unclean things, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags”
(Isa. Ixiii. 6). This is just what a poor sinner feels when brought into God’s
court of justice by the Spirit of the Lord.
Mr. Service, with many more of his professed Protestant friends—who have in
heart and doctrine turned again to papacy —do not like this glorious and heavenly
doctrine, because it does not allow of their good tempers, dispositions, deeds,
and performances, and what they call inward grace and outward works, to come in
for a share of the glory in the matter of the justification of a sinner in the sight of
God. Here we see the greater part of Protestants and the Papists at this time
are one, as to the end and design of their works, although their works are different
in their kind. This is the secret cause of so many thousands of all denominations
going over to the Church of Rome, because most of the Protestant Churches have
of late years held and taught justification by inward grace and outward works,
which is the life and soul, bones and sinews, of Papacy. This awful doctrine was
the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Papacy: at
first, in Pelagius, in the 4th century, and it rebuilt the Papacy again after it had
been greatly broken by the Reformation, in Arminius, and has of late years hatched
innumerable broods for the Papacy in all parts of Christendom. Let Protestants
repent and turn again to the good old doctrine of justification by faith in the
righteousness of Christ before the world becomes deluged by the soul-destroying,
God-dishonoring waters of Rome, viz.—justification in part by inward grace and
outward works, Christ making up the rest. To prove that it is thus, and that the
Papists know it, I here give an extract from a letter, written from England, by a
Jesuit, to his father, rector atßrussells, during the troubles of Charles 1., when he,
with the hypocritical Bishop Laud, strove to set up the Papacy again in England.
This letter was found among his papers after his death ;
“ Father Rector, let not the damp of astonishment seize upon your ardent and
zealous soul in apprehending the sudden and unexpected calling of a Parliament.
We have now many strings to our bow. We have planted that sovereigne drugge,
| Arminianism,' which we hope will purge the Protestants from their heresie, and
it flourisheth and bears fruit in due season. For the better prevention of the
Puritans (Calvinists) the Arminians have already locked the duke’s (of Bucking-
ham) ears, and we have those of our own religion which stand continually at the
the duke’s chamber, to see who sroes in n»'-i n"t—we cannot be too circumspect


and careful in this regard. lam at this time transported with joy to see how hap-
pily all instruments and means, as well great as lesser, co-operate unto our purpose.
But, to return to the main fabric, our foundation is Arminianism. * * * * *
The Arminians and Projectors, as it appears in the premises, affect mutation.
This we second and enforce by probable arguments.” (‘Hidden Works of Dark-
ness,’ page 89-90, ed. 1845, ‘Toplady’s Works,’ page 55). The letter was dated,
March, 1628. Prom this it will be evident that the Papists know that the Armin-
ian doctrine of justification by works is the life and soul of their religion, and
that if the Protestants once receive this they are seven parts out of eight Papists
already, and one step more and they are into Rome’s bosom entirely. This letter
shows that Rome has had her secret agents in the Church of England, by whom
she has been almost drowned in Puseyism of late; and, as there are no bounds to the
craft and deceit of Satan in these Jesuits, I believe they have had agents in all the
professedly Protestant Churches, by which thousands have been duped into the
horrors of Rome, like a bird into the snare of the fowler. Who could have
thought that I should have been called upon to withstand Papacy in a professed
protestant. I believe the Jesuits can and do stretch their consciences to bear with
all or any of the externals of protestants, as to ordinances and forms of worship,
if they can but carry this one point—“justification by works !
Now, therefore, let me further prove the prophets’, apostles’, and reformers’
doctrine of justification by faith alone in the righteousness of Christ. Justifica-
tion and Righteousness are law or judicatory terms and signify an offender or sup-
posed offender brought before his judge to be examined and tried by the law
under which he stands, and upon strict examination he is justified from all things
laid to his charge ; so that he stands in court perfectly righteous before his judge,
in the eyes of the law and of all men present. So, sinners are brought in their con-
sciences into judgment, by the power of the Holy Spirit, (John xvi, 8,) “ Unto
God the Judge of all,” ( Heb. adi, 23,) “ For the time is come that judgment
must begin at the House of God,” ( 1 Peter iv. 17 ). The law is the rule of judg-
ment (Rom. hi. 19) and the witness (Rom. vi. 7 ), Satan, is the counsellor against
the prisoner—Satan standing at his right hand to resist him, (Zech. hi 1,) “Angels
fill the court ’’ xv. 10,). All is silent while the judge speaks : “ Prisoner
at the bar, you stand indicted and charged this day with having broken every law
of the God of the whole earth! What say you, prisoner at the bar, guilty or not
guilty? Listen to this poor sinner, ye self-righteous, who hope to be partly justified
by your good disposition and works, and partly by Christ. “ I acknowledge my
transgressions and my sin is ever before me ; against Thee and against Thee only have
I sinned, and done this evil in Thy sight, that Thou mightest be justified when
Thou speakest and clear when thou judgest” (Psalm li. 4, Luke xv. 18,) “I
have sinned against heaven and before Thee ”, Thus stands the poor sinner before
God with all the filthy garments of his iniquity upon him. God is my witness
I have stood like this before Him and Ido know these things by feeling. And
then, the sentence of the law is read over, “ Cursed is every one that continueth
not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them, ( Gall. iii.
10 ), Now, just as he expects the judge to pass the sentence and he be sent to hell,
one Jesus, a Mighty Counsellor “ called Wonderful Counsellor ! ” (Isa. ix. 6,) •
“an Advocate with the Father ”(1 John ii. 1). He says, “ I stand in the defence
of this sinner; I laydown my life for the Sheep” (John x. 11,) “ I die for his
offence, I rise again for his justification,’’ (Rom. iv. 25,) “ I bear his sin ’’ (Heb.
ix. 28, ) “ They are laid upon me,” (Isa, liii. 6,) “ I will be made a curse for him ”
(Gal. iii. 13 ) and so, obtain eternal redemption for him, (Heb. ix. 12) ; “ I will
be made sin for him that he may be made the righteousness of God in me ” (2 Cor.
v. 21) ; “I will bring him an everlasting righteousness ” ( Dan. ix. 24,) so that,
as his first father made him a sinner, I, his everlasting Father, do make him righ-
teous, (Rom. v. 19 ).
To all this Advocacy the Judge of All saith “ I am well pleased for thy righteous-
ness’ sake,” (Isa. xlii. 21,) Thou hast magnified the law and made it honorable.
Now Faith, who hears and firmly believes in this life, death, and resurrection of
Christ (Phil. ii. 8) and satisfaction of the Father, (Isa. liii. 10,) cries out in court:
“ Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth !
Who is he that condemneth ?it is Christ that died !’’ ( Rom. viii. 33 ). An angel
says to Satan, “ The Lord rebuke thee, Satan,” and takes away the prisoner’s filthy
garments. Mr. Service and the members of the Roman and Arminian Jesuits are
crying. “ O, do not take away his righteousness, as filthy rags, for we want them
to patch up the deficiencies of Christ’s imputed righteousness, ” (Rom. iv. 11,)
“which is unto all and upon all them that believe” ( iii. 22). But, whilst the
angel may look upon them with a frown of holy indignation, he will haste out of
court with these self-righteous rags, to cast them into the sea of forgetfulness, so


that, though they be sought after by monks and friars, they shall never be found.
And the angel |of the Lord attends to the Divine command:—“ Clothe him with
change of raiment the hand of Faith helps the angel to put the raiment on,
but forms no part of the robe itself.
Thus you will see how a poor sinner is justified, as in a few minutes, “ without
the deeds of the law ” ( Rom. iii. 28 ) —the thief upon the cross, who from a vile
thief became a glorified saint in a few minutes of time; having as much justifica-
tion as Paul though he did neither partake of the Lord’s Supper nor was baptized,
nor perform any acts of love to the saints—which things were never intended to
justify a sinner before God, but the fruits that a justified sinner always bears to the
glory of God who justified him. The woman taken in adultery was justified by our
Saviour in one minute when He said “Neither do I condemn thee” (John viii. 11).
Mary Magdalene was justified in one minute when He said unto her “ Thy sins are
forgiven,’’ ( Luke vii. 48 ). This “ being freely justified by His grace ” (Titus iii. 6)
does away with all the large sums of money given to the church of Rome for jus-
tification from the storehouses of the good works of saints, and it deprives the
priesthood of Arminians of the honor of being co-workers with Christ in this mat-
ter of justification. So both alike, from the same reasons, condemn it.
Some, who do not understand the Scriptures and cannot distinguish between
things that differ, discard works, yet make faith the ground of justification,
because some passages of the Word of God seem to favor that view, such as
“ Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness ” (Rom. iv.
3), (ver. 5) “His faith is counted for righteousness.” Sometimes the Word of
God speaks of the cause of things in the name or word that properly is the effect,
as, for instance, “Thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace” (Luke vii. 50), but He
saith, “ I, even I, am the Lord, and besides me thereis no saviour ” (Isa. xliii. 11;.
Therefore, God sometimes speaks of the objects of faith, in the grace of faith.
Christ, in His person and work, is the Saviour. Faith brings him into the soul as
such: so, in these places, wher e justification and righteousness are ascribed to faith
as a grace of the Spirit, we must understand the object of faith to be meant. This
justifying righteousness is called the ‘Righteousness of God,’ because God pro-
vides it in Christ by faith (Phil. iii. 9), because it comes to us by believing alone,
and not by works ; sometimes it is called the ‘righteousness of faith’ (Rom. iv.
13), because faith is the only hand that receives this heavenly gift—so that it was
that which God promised to Abraham, that was counted to him for righteousness,
and not his faith Hterally; for Gal. iii. speaks much of the promise, and of Christ
who was in the promise, and of his faith in the promise, (ver. 16) “Now, to
Abraham and his seed were the promises made, ’ (ver. 14) “ That the blessing of
Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive
the promise of the Spirit through faith,” (ver. 22) “That the promise, by faith,
of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.” Therefore, we must dis-
tinguish between the promise of the Spirit—Christ, who was promised, and faith
that believes the promise. Neither faith nor the promise in themselves justify ;
but Christ, who was promised, is the justifying righteousness “ who of God is
made unto us righteousness ” (1 Cor. i. 30). If faith was the justifying righteous-
ness—the saviour, what need would there have been for Christ to die ?
The principal Scriptures Mr. Service, with other Arminians and Romanists,
bring to prove justification by works are from James ii. 17 to 26; but the most
they can do is to set the Holy Spirit in James to contradict the Holy Spirit in
Paul, and so make God the author of confusion, which is very dreadful to think
of. We must remember, first, Paul was inspired to write against Judaising
teachers, who bewitched the people by teaching that righteousness unto justifica-
tion was by works (Gal. iii.) James was inspired to write against a vile set of
Antinomians, who held the truth in righteousness—supposing that a mere dead
assent of the mind—dead faith—in the Gospel was all that was necessary for sal-
vation (ver. 20), without those works which living faith always produces (Heb.
x. 32). James told these monsters in sin that devils had this dead faith without
works (ver. 19). Thus, we must have good works to justify our profession of
faith in Christ. This justification by works of which James writes, is a justifica-
tion of our profession of faith before men, devils, and angels; for He saith to
these awful characters, “ Show me thy faith without thy works, ” as much as to
say ‘I defy you to do so,’ “ and I will shew my faith by my works,” (ver. 18).
From this the whole difficulty is removed and the secret opened; for faith is first,
and, by that faith in the righteousness of Christ, justification before God; and
secondly, the showing that faith by good works, by which we are justified before
devils, angels, men, and saints. “ Was not Abraham, our father, justified by
works when he had offered up Isaac, his son, upon the altar ” (ver. 21). This was
not before God, but before men. “ For if Abraham were justified by works, he


hath whereof to glory, but not before God” (Rom. iv. 2). And further, it must
be remembered that Abraham’s justification by faith alone in the righteousness of
Christ, before God, was about forty years before his justification by works, here
spoken of by James. The first is recorded in Gen. xv., twenty years before the
birth of Isaac, b. c. 1913 ; the latter in Gen. xxii., b. c. 1272. So that, if Abraham
had died during the forty years—if this justification of which James writes was
before God, and not before men, as these Jesuits contend—then Abraham would
have been lost, for none can be saved without being justified. However, he was
prepared for heaven the very moment he believed in God, his shield and exceeding
great reward (Gen xv. 3), and also ready, at every opportunity, to justify his pro-
fession of faith in God, his shield, by good works; as was also the harlot Rahab
(vei. 25); for by works they shewed their faith to be genuine and perfect (ver. 22),
for by this the children of God are manifested (not constituted) and the children
of the devil (1 John iii. 10).
Having removed all the groundwork of my opponent’s arguments, I conclude
with a few more testimonies from the Word of God—which is full of them —in
proof of a sinner’s justification by faith alone in the righteousness of Christ. In
the 22nd Psalm we have a very striking account of Christ’s life, sufferings, death,
and resurrection, and the seed promised him—his generation (ver. 30), “They
shall come and declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be bom, that he
hath done this” (ver. 31). Now turn to the 53rd chapter of Isaiah, where the
same things are recorded, and in verse 11 this same righteousness is laid down as
the groundwork or cause of His peoples’ justification—“ By his knowledge shall my
righteous servant justify many, for he shall bear their iniquity.” Now to Gal. iii.
for the same thing—“ Before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set
forth, crucified among you ” (ver. 1), “ Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster,
to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith ” (ver. 24). Again, in
Psalm xl., He speaks of the same obedience unto death (ver. 6 to 8), and then
saith (in ver. 9) “ I have preached righteousness in the great congregation. Lo, I
have not refrained my lips, O Lord, Thou knowest;” and again, in Isa. 1., His
death is predicted (ver. 6), and in ver. 8 His own justification as the substitute
of His people is declared; then, in chapter li. He begins to comfort His people,
“ Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord
(ver. 1), and, in ver. 5, “My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth ”;
and in ver. 7 they have obtained it, “Hearken unto me ye that know righteous-
ness, the people in whose heart is my law.” Every one of the saved sinners
know and feel these things before they die, as it is written, “ Surely shall one say,
in the Lord I have righteousness and strength” (Isa. xlv. 24). Let us now carry
this blessed property of the Lord “my righteousness,” and this testimony of faith
“ In the Lord have I righteousness.” into the New Testament, and see how the
harmony is kept up. Paul saith “ Yea doubtless, and I count all things but
loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom
I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I
may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having mine own righteousness,
which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
which is of God by Faith” (Phil. iii. 8, 9),—yea, the Lord Jesus, by His
imputed righteousness to His believing people, is so entirely their justifying
righteousness that he is called by them, “The Lord our righteousness” (Jer. x'xiii.
9); and the Church of God is so completely covered and justified by His righteous-
ness that she is called by the same name, “the Lord our righteousness ” (Jer.
xxxiii. 15). “And by Him all that believe are justified from all things, from
which they could not be justified by the law of Moses” (Acts xiii. 39); “There
is. therefore, nowno condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus ” (Rom. viii. 1).
With these volumes of Bible testimony we build our hopes on the righteousness of
Christ, and discard and cast away our own righteousness as filthy rags, believing
that every soul that dares to go into God’s presence with such will be “cast into
outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth” (Matt. xxii.
13), from which awful judgment I should be thankful to see Mr. Service, with
thousands more now involved in this dreadful error, free, that they might be
blessed with all true believers in Christ—those which compose the church of
which it is said, “ And to her it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
linen, clean and white ” (Rev. xix. 8).


FOURTH DISCUSSION, MAY 10, 1861.
SUBJECT
By Mb. Allen—That Saints op God cannot finally pall.
By Mr. Service—That Saints of God may finally fall.
Mr. Service brings for his proof 2 Peter ii. 1: but these are not saints of God,
being false prophets, false teachers, said to deny “ the Lord that bought them. ”
Neither Christ Jesus nor His blood is mentioned or referred to as is always the
case when the redemption of the saints of God is declared: these were only washed
swine in their outward conduct, being inwardly ravening wolves —called, in ver.
22, dogs and swine—never sheep; never converted to God in their hearts, though
they had the knowledge of God in their heads, and could preach with their
tongues. We find a long train of these characters all through the Word of God,
from Cain; Dathan, Abiram, and their company; the four hundred and fifty pro -
phets of Jezebel; the Scribes and Pharisees; the Judaising teachers that be-
witched the Gentile churches ( Gal. hi. 1) —to the many Antichrists spoken of by
John (ii. 18). These are never spoken of in the Word of God as saints : these are
not God’s but Mr. Service’s saints, according to the true proverb—“ Birds of a
feather flock together ” ; and although some of them were bought out of Egypt by
Divine power (Exod. xvi. 6 ; Deut. xxxii. 6 ), yet never by the precious blood of
Christ.
Another class of saints Mr. Service contends for —who seem to be like God's
saints but are not really so, neither are they ever once said to be so in the Word of
God —are persons who for a time have had the gifts of the Holy Ghost but never
the grace of the Holy Spirit. Two of these may be taken out of the Old Testa-
ment as a fair sample of the whole,—Balaam and Saul. The first I shall show to
have all that the Apostle speaks of in Hebrews vi. 4. First, enlightened, (Num.
xxiv. 3) “ The man whose eyes are open hath said” ; second, “The heavenly gift ”
(Num. xxiv 17)—“ I shall see him but not nigh”; third, “partakers of the
Holy Ghost,” (Num. xxiv. 22,) “And the Spirit of God came upon him” ; fourth,
“tasted of the Word of God, ” ( Num. xxiii. 5,) “ And the Lord put a word in
Balaam’s mouth” : fifth, “And the power of the world to come” ( Num. xxiii.
11,) “Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his. ”
You can read the same things of Saul, in 1 Samuel x., and to all the above you
can add faithfulness in Balaam whilst God employed him, for he said, “ I cannot
go beyond the word of my God to do less or more,’’ ( Num. xxii. 18 ). Thus we
find a wicked child of Satan ( 2 Pet. ii. 15 ; Jude 11.) endowed for a time with
the gift of the Spirit; to be a servant in the House of God for a time, yet not con-
verted or changed in heart, or sanctified in Spirit. These fall away, and it is im-
possible to renew them again to repentance cr change of character, ( Mat. xii. 44,)
These being servants, not sons, “ The servant abideth not in the house for ever, but
the son abideth always ’’ ( John viii. 35). Balaam, then, is one of Mr. Service s
fallen saints, but never one of God’s, “kept by His power ”
I shall now take one of Mr. Service’s New Testament saints, as a sample of the
whole, who was strongly contended for by Mr. Service, as a Saint, but never con-
stituted or called so by our Lord, —Judas. This man who forms one of Mr. S's
flock : was called to be an apostle, and gifted to preach Christ and to work mira-
cles ( Mat. x. 4; Acts i. 25 ). This office he did not take to himself but was called
to it by the Lord, a servant to fall, not a son to abide foi ever. Therefore Jesus said,
long before he fell or Satan anew entered him, “ Have not I chosen you twelve, and
one of you is a devil ” (John vi. 70) —the son of perdition, lost that the Scriptures
might be fulfilled, in 109th Psalm, John vi. 70. He fell that he might go to his
own place (Acts i. 25). Thus then, although he is one of Mr. Service s fallen
saints, yet never one of God’s saints, but called a devil. With Judas, Mr. S. has
many more of his saints, such as Simon the Sorcerer (Acts viii. 13-18), Hymeneus
and Alexander, the blasphemers (1 Timothy i. 20), Philetus (2 Tim. ii. 12), who
make shipwreck of the faith. These apostatize from the faith once delivered to
the saints (Jude 3). The doctrine of faith which they held in their understand-
ing—which is never said to purify their hearts —was a dead or nominal faith, such
as devils have (James ii. 19), which made them a step higher than infidels ; yet,
this is very different from the faith of God’s elect (Titus i. 1), which purifies the
heart (Acts xv. 9) These saints of Mr. S. may make shipwreck in the doctrine
of faith, and of this dead faith, and from the faith of miracles too, and sink from
all the gifts of the Spirit—from being a visible member of the Church of Christ
professedly, as in John xv. 6; because all these gifts are first described, in 1 Cor.
xii., as distinct from grace, and, in xiii. 8, they are all said to fail, in distinction


from charity, which never fails, and without which the apostle said he should he
as nothing, though he had all the gifts that ever the Spirit gave to men. Now
neither Judas, nor any other of Mr. Service’s fallen saints are ever said to have
had this charity ; hence, when Judas seemed to have it (John xii. 5), he is imme-
diately cleared from it—“ This he said, not that he cared for the poof, but because
he was a thief and carried the bag.” I never knew a saint to be a thief, nor a
thief to be a saint; neither had he, nor any one of Mr. S.’s flock of saints, the
faith of God’s power (Ephes. i. 19), of God’s elect (Titus i. 1), that purifies the
heart, that works by love ; for, as soon as Peter confessed Christ, in the exercise
of this precious faith, as in John vi. 69 Jesus cleared Judas from it, lest he should
be thought to be in that confession. Those of the dead faith became merely
nominal disciples, and went back (ver. 66), drew back into perdition (Heb. x. 38),
as Judas did, and are said to do as he did (ver. 29), and, in vi. 6, are said to cru-
cify Christ afresh. But of those who have the faith that works by love, He saith
(ver. 8), “But, beloved, we were persuaded better things of you, and things that
accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous, to forget
your work and labor of love.” This is what Mr, S.’s fallen saints never had. And
the same line is drawn between the living and the dead in chap. x. 33, “ Ye have
had compassion of me, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods” ; and, in ver.
39, “ But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of those who
believe unto the saving of the soul.
Now, therefore, having shown from the Word of God the great difference there
is between Mr. S.’s fallen and apostatizing saints (who are never once called, con-
stituted, or accounted saints by God) and the saints of God, sanctified by God
the Father (Jude 1), by God the Son (Heb. ii. 11) and by God the Holy Ghost
(1 Peter i. 2), “ called to be saints ”(1 Cor. i. 2), —I shall now prove, from the
Word of God, the impossibility of their final fall. For, although professors may
have their names in the church book of the living, and a name to live whilst they
are dead, and have those names blotted out of that book on earth (Rev. iii. 5),
as some lost their names from the Book of the Living, in Jerusalem (Neh. vii. 64);
yet the saints will never have their names taken out of the Lamb’s Book of Life,
written before the foundation of the world (Rev. xiii. 8); and, although the seven
churches may be moved out of Asia, and the candlesticks of Gospel ordinances
may be removed from Ephesus to England, yet never may one single saint be
moved from Christ (Matt. xvi. 18). The Church of professors and possessors
mingled together is one thing; and the Church built together by God’s Spirit, in
Christ and on Him, is another. Persons may go in and out of the first, but never
out of the second (Jer. xxxii. 39-40). This is, and will appear impossible from
the following Scriptures :
1. —Their redemption is said to be “eternal redemption” (Heb. ix. 12), viz.,
from the horrible pit (Psalm xl. 2). But if they fall into hell, then their redemp-
tion is not eternal, but only up to the time they so fall.
2. —Their salvation is said to be eternal salvation (Heb. v. 9), viz., from sin
(Matt. i. 23). But if they finally fall and sin the sin of death, their salvation is
only up to the time they so fall. ' •
3. —Their life is said to be “ eternal life ” (John x. 28), viz,c, from 'death (Hosea
xiii. 14). But if they finally fall and receive the wages of‘sin, which is death,
their life is not eternal, but only up to the time they so perish.
4. —Their righteousness is said to be “ everlasting righteousness,” viz., from
condemnation (Rom. viii. 1). But, if they finally fall into condemnation, their
righteousness is not everlasting, but only up to the time they are so condemned.
5. —Their Intercessor is said “ ever to live to make intercession for them ” (John
xvii. 11-22, Rom. viii. 34). But, if they finally fall, and are not with Him, His
intercession is not for ever, or does not prevail, which is blasphemy to say. It
will be observed that these things are not merely so in themselves, but to the
saints of God; so that, to deny the final perseverance of the saints is at once to
make the sacrifice of Christ to be no more than the sacrifice of the bullocks and
goats on the great day of atonement, which lasted only one year (Lev. xvi.) This
is counting the blood of Christ an unholy thing, and such are guilty of the body
and blood of Christ, —which is one of the monstrous sins of the age in the pro-
fessed church. I hope they will consider and repent.
I shall now notice four things in God the Father which make it impossible for
saints to finally fall.
I.—His eternal election of their persons unto salvation, sanctification, obedience,
and glory (1 Peter i. Ito 4). But if they cfime short of these, His election is
frustrated and made void.


15
2. —His predestination of them to glory (Rom. viii. 30). But if they finally
fall, and come short of it, then His predestination would fail—His designs and
intentions would be overturned.
3. —His purposes in choosing them to the heavenly inheritance (Ephes. i. 2)
would be broken off. But it is declared that “His counsel shall stand” (Prov.
xix. 21), and therefore cannot be broken off.
4. —He hath willed them not to perish (Matt, xviii. 14), but to have everlasting
life (John vi. 39), and “who hath resisted His will” (Rom. ix. 12), “He is of
one mind, and who can turn Him’’ (Job xxiii. 13). Man proposes, predestinates,
chooses, and wills, and has to endure continual grief from disappointment in all
these, and so complain “My purposes are broken off,” and then desire a broken
stone to be set upon their graves as a sign of their disappointment. So,
Papacy, with Arminianism, has thought God to be altogether such as themselves,
and go about to represent God as every moment deprived of the objects of His
love and of the purchase of His Son’s death, and of the sanctified by His Spirit,
and as having to endure the pain of His purposes being broken, His intentions
frustrated, and His will violated by seeing those in hell that He determined should
be in heaven. But these monsters of the night shall never bury the Eternal God
in the ruins of His election, predestination, purposes, and will, and set a broken
monument upon His grave, for “He will do all His pleasure.’’ Thus, as these
deceivers blaspheme the Son of God by representing His death to fail in accom-
plishing that which it was designed to do, so do they blaspheme the Father in repre-
senting His decrees frustrated and made void, for which I pray the Lord to give
them repentance unto life.
“ Not as the world the Saviour gives, “ The Spirit that would this truth withstand,
“ He is no fickle friend, % “ Would put Clod’s temple down
“ Whom once He loves He never leaves, “ Wrest Jesus’ sceptre from His hand,
“ But loves them to the end." “ And spoil Him of His crown.”
For it is writen of the saints of God, “Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in
the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God” (Isa. Ixii. 3).
If any man attempted to take the crown from the head, and the sceptre from
the hand, of our queen, he would be taken up for high treason, and daring rebellion.
And will the eternal God and King of heaven and earth hold them guiltless, who
dare go about with their deceivings to rob Him of his crown and spoil Him of
His diadem. I now give four things more from the word, which most solemnly
secure the saints of God from finally falling, viz.—
1. —The promises of God (Isaiah xlvi. 4). “To hoar hairs will I carry you.”
But if they fall, He does not, but only up to the time they so fall. (Jer. xxxii. 40).
“They shall fear me for ever; they shall not depart from me.”—But if they
finally fall, they do not fear Him for ever, and they do depart from Him. “I will
never leave you nor forsake you ” (Heb. xiii. 5). But if they finally fall, He does
both leave and forsake them. The monstrous error I oppose represents God to lie.
2. —The promises of Christ, the Son of God, in truth are—“ Shall not perish,
but have everlasting life” (John hi. 15), “I go to prepare a place for you, that
where lam there ye may be also ” (xiv. 2). But, if they finally fall they do
perish, and will not be where Christ is : thus He is represented to lie.
3. —The oath of God is given to keep them—“ So have I sworn that I will not
, be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee” (Isa. liv. 9). It is to the Gentile Church
this oath is given (see ver. 1 with Gal. iv. 27). The same oath is applied to all
believers iir Heb. vi. 13-18. But if they finally fall, He is both wroth with them
and must rebuke them, and does forswear himself. Such are the vile consequences
of the doctrine I oppose.
4. —The faithfulness of God is engaged to keep them —“ God is faithful,” “ who
shall confirm you unto the end” (1 Cor. i. 8-9), “But the God of all grace, who
hath called us unto His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered
awhile, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you” (1 Peter v. 10). But
if they finally fall, they cannot be confirmed to the end, nor called to His eternal
glory, nor can the Lord be faithful. Such are the tremendous lengths that these
poor men are hurried to by Satan. But, whatever these Judas-like saints may
say or sing, the saints of God will sing—•
“ E’en down to old age, all thy people shall prove “ The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose,
lt Thy sovereign, eternal, immutable love, “ He cannot, he will not, desert to his foes,
And when hoar hairs their temples adore, “ That soul, though all hell should endeavour to
Like Lambs they shall still on Thy bosom be shake,
b o ™ 6 - “ He'll never, no never, no never, forsake.”
Five other powerful arguments in confirmation I here ’ introduce, fearless of
their being overturned.

i. 6), “In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the
world began” (Titus i. 2). All this my.opponents deny.
2.—The will of Christ forbids- their .final fall —“I will raise him up at the last
day” (John vi. 44), “ Father, I will that they whom Thou hast given me be with
me where lam ” (John xvii. 24). But if they finally fall, the will of Christ will
be violated, and void—die in heaven: they in hell. But,

In 2 Cor. iii. 3, they are said to be epistles written by the SjniJt of God, and here
'they are said to be sealed unto redemption by the Spirit of God. But - if they finally

. 4. —The power of God is engaged to keep them from’this final fall—“ Who are
* kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in
the last.time ”(1 Peter i. 5). This is the Father’s mighty haftul, out of which
none can possibly pluck them (John x. 29). Thus they are “ preserved in Christ ”
(Judei. 1).
“ His honor is eripfnjred to save ' "All that his heavenly Father gave, .
"The weakest of His sheep, "His hands seeuiely keep.”
5. —They cannot be separated from eternal love, and become the subjects qf

xxxi. 3),*“ Having loved His own which were in the world, Hq loved them unto
the end ” (John xiii« 1), “ Who shall separate us from the love of God ? ” (Horn.
. viii. 35). But if they finally fall, it is not everlasting, neither are they loved to

purposes are not changeable, so He repenteth *ot of the gifts and callings of His
adoption, neither do He cast off those whom He oncfe received. >
Thus, I have proved our doctrine to be the doctrine of the prophets, apostles,
fathers, and reformers, to which I pray God to return the professed church, now
involved in the errors of Rome. So shall we be established—so shall we prosper,
and God be glorified for ever more. Amen.
