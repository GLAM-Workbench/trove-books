INTRODUCTION
The Amsterdam International Colonial and General Export
Trade Exhibition affords an appropriate opportunity for
noting the relative positions of the Australasian Colonies,
and for disseminating information respecting their progress
and resources.
In the early part of the seventeenth century several por-
tions of the Australian continent and adjacent islands were
visited by Dutch navigators, who bestowed upon them
names commemorative of their own nationality, such as
New Holland, New Zealand, and Van Diemen’s Land. The
Netherlands have extensive possessions in Oceania, which,
owing to their proximity to Australia, may be expected to
develop extensive commercial relations with the neighbouring
British Colonies as the latter become more thickly populated
and their resources and manufactures better known. Erance,
Spain, and Germany have also interests in the South
Pacific.
The discovery of the eastern shores of the Australian con-
tinent by Captain Cook, in 1770, led to the first Australasian
settlement being founded at Sydney by the British Govern-
ment in 1788. The British Colonies which have sprung
from this settlement contain an area of 3,086,128 square
miles, of which New South Wales contains 305,992 ; Vic-
toria, 87,881; South Australia, 903,690; Queensland,
668,224; Western Australia, 979,392; New Zealand,
104,403; Tasmania, 26,215, and Eiji, 7,740 square miles.


The estimated population of the British Colonies in Aus-
tralasia at the end of 1881 was 2,833,608, distributed as
under: —New South Wales, 781,265 (including 1,613
aborigines); Victoria, 882,232 (including 780 aborigines);
South Australia, 293,297 (including 6,316 aborigines) ;
Western Australia, 30,013 (not including 2,316 aborigines ;
Queensland, 226,968 (not including 20,585 aborigines) ; New
Zealand, 500,910 (not including 11,097 Maories) ; Tasmania,
118,923. Last year there was an increase of 103,000 souls
arising from the excess of immigration oyer emigration and
of births over deaths. Fiji at the last Census had a popula-
tion of 121,902, of whom 115,635 were aborigines. The
proportion of the sexes amongst the European population of
the Australian Colonies is estimated at 118 76 males to 100
females, or 81-21 females to 100 males. The average number
of inhabitants of European descent is less than one person to
the square mile. There is room in New South Wales alone
for a very large accession of new population for the de-
velopment of its pastoral, agricultural, mineral, and other
resources.
During the last decennial period the population of the
Australian Colonies has increased 42 per cent., commerce 47
per cent., wool production 70 per cent., acres under cul-
tivation 120 per cent., railways 431 per cent., telegraphs 190
per cent., revenue 123 per cent. The annual revenues of
the several Governments have increased from 9 millions to
over millions sterling, being an average of £7 Bs. lid. per
head of population. The live stock increased from 56,900,000
to 88,665,000, and now consists of 78,156,000 sheep, 8,294,000
cattle, 1,215,000 horses, and 1,000,000 pigs, or an average of
28‘83 animals to the square mile. The land under cultiva-
tion increased from 3,165,000 acres to nearly 7,000,000 acres,
and the total acreage now under crop gives an average of
2'45 acres per head of population.


During the same period the tonnage of shipping entered
and cleared at all the ports in Australasia increased from
4,300,000 tons to 9,504,000 tons. Steamships of from four
to five thousand tons burthen are now engaged in the carry-
ing trade. The yearly value of colonial produce and manu-
factures exported annually is estimated at forty millions
sterling. The exports consist principally of products of the
pastoral, agricultural, and mining industries, such as wool,
tallow, hides, preserved meats, wheat, gold, tin, copper,
coal, &c.
The deposits in the Colonial Banks of issue, on the 30th
September, 1882, amounted to £66,471,992, giving a larger
amount per head of population than is shown in Great Britain.
In 1881, the trade between the Australian Colonies,
England, and Eoreign States amounted to £101,097,497, or
an average of £36 6s. Bd. per head of population, of which
the sum of £lB 19s. was for imports and £l7 7s. Bd. for
exports. Eiji in 1880 had a trade amounting to £415,269,
being £185,740 for imports and £229,528 for exports.
At the end of 1881 the various Australasian Governments
possessed 5,471 miles of railways in active operation, and
1,317 miles were under construction in various parts of the
interior. The railways are now returning fair interest on the
capital invested, and are important agencies in the industrial
progress of the Colonies. There are 49,119 miles of electric
telegraphs connecting every township of any importance
in the Australasian Colonies, and by means of the ocean
cables the latest intelligence from the chief nations of the
world is disseminated throughout Australia almost as soon
as it is published in European cities. The Colonies afford
all the comforts of modern civilized life, with hut little of the
poverty existing in older countries.


The food supply of Great Britain is largely supplemented
by Australian grain and preserved meats. During the agricul-
tural season of 1881-2 these Colonies produced 29,675,899
bushels of wheat, 11,718,264 bushels of oats, 6,326,050
bushels of maize, and 828,228 bushels of other cereals,
364,762 tons of potatoes, 850,167 tons of hay, and 1,438,060
gallons of wine.
The public debts of the seven Colonies in Australasia at
the end of 1881 amounted to only £95,965,582, or an average
of £33 17s. 4d. per head of population. Incurred for the con-
struction of railways and other reproductive public works,
and the consequent development of the varied resources of
the several Colonies. The expenditure of the several Colonies
in 1881 amounted to £19,152,957, against revenue to the
amount of £20,607,308, leaving a surplus of £1,454,351 for
that year.
Out of the 1,968,260,080 acres contained in the Colonies,
only 86,703,110 acres had been alienated at the end of
1881, leaving 1,881,556,970 acres unalienated. This large
public estate gives ample security for any loans that may be
required for national purposes.


NEW SOUTH WALES.
SETTLEMENT, POSITION, AND EXTENT.
Discovered by Captain Cook in 1770, and first settled in
1788, the prosperity of New South Wales dates from the
commencement of the present century when the introduction
of the Merino sheep was made by Captain Macarthur, which
rapidly led to the settlement of the interior for pastoral and
industrial pursuits. In 1851 the south-western districts
of New South Wales were formed into the Colony of Vic-
toria ; and in 1859 its northern districts into the Colony of
Queensland.
The boundaries are marked by 28° 10' and 37° 28' south
latitude, and by the 111 0 east longitude and the Pacific
Ocean. The total superficial area is estimated at 195,831,880
acres. The coast line from Point Danger to Cape Howe is
about 700 miles long. The extreme breadth is about 850
miles, and mean breadth 600 miles. The greatest length is
900 miles.
PHYSICAL ASPECT.
There is considerable diversity of physical aspect in this
large extent of country. At a distance varying from 25
to 120 miles from the seaboard, a range of mountains, from
3,000 to 7,000 feet in height, stretches from north to south,
throwing out spurs in every direction. Numerous streams
flow down the eastern slopes into the sea, while the large


rivers, Murrumbidgee, Murray, Lachlan, Darling, and Mac-
quarie, with their tributaries, drain the western slopes. The
coast-line is indented with fine harbours, one of which,
Port Jackson, on which Sydney the capital is situated, is unsur-
passed by any in the world.
NATURAL DIVISIONS OF THE COUNTRY.
The principal great natural divisions of the country are
the eastern seaboard territory, the central range, and the
western plains. The seaboard districts undulate with hill and
valley, and possess rich alluvial flats adapted to every kind of
cultivation. Much of this portion rests on a vast basin of
coal. Beyond the coal areas the country abounds in gold,
copper, lead, tin, and other minerals. The extensive western
slopes and plains are specially adapted for pastoral and agri-
cultural pursuits. Millions of sheep, cattle, and horses are
fed upon the natural grasses of the country.
CLIMATE AND HEALTH.
Situated in the temperate zone, the climate of New South
Males approximates generally to that of southern Europe.
There are all varieties of climate, while the range of the
thermometer is much less than in any country within the
same parallels of latitude in the northern hemisphere. The
climate is healthy; the air is clear, the light brilliant, the
sky for a great part of the year almost cloudless, and the
nights usually cool. The mean annual temperature of
Sydney is 62*4 degrees. In vital statistics the Colony com-
pares favourably with most parts of the world, and instances
of great longevity are numerous. Births per 1,000 of mean
population in 1881 averaged 38*00 per cent.; Deaths, 15*12;
and Marriages, 8*24. The excess of births over deaths
amounted to 151*33 per cent.


GOVERNMENT.
New South Wales has a Governor appointed by the Crown,
and a Parliament consisting of two Houses, the Legislative
Council and the Legislative Assembly. The Parliament is
invested with plenary powers, subject to the reservation of
the Queen’s assent by the Governor, to certain classes of
measures affecting Imperial and other interests.
The Members of the Legislative Council hold their seats
for life, and are appointed by the Governor.
The Legislative Assembly consists of 115 Members, elected
practically by universal suffrage and vote by ballot. Parlia-
ments are triennial.
The Executive Government consists of nine Members, as
follows :
The Colonial Secretary,
The Colonial Treasurer,
The Minister for Lands,
The Minister for Public Works,
The Minister of Public Instruction,
The Minister of Justice,
The Minister for Mines,
The Attorney-General,
The Postmaster-General.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
The laws are substantially identical with those of Great
Britain. The Supreme Court has, as regards the Colony,
all the powers which are vested in the superior Courts of
England. There are five Judges—the Chief Justice and
four Puisne Judges.
Besides the fixed Courts in the metropolis, Circuit Courts
are regularly held in the principal towns of the interior, to


try civil and criminal cases. District Courts and Courts of
Quarter Sessions are also frequently held in Sydney and many
country towns, presided over by six District Court Judges.
In addition to this, there are 241 Courts of Petty Sessions.
The Police Porce consists of 1,300 officers and men, dis-
tributed over 382 stations.
The administration of justice, and the protection of life
and property, are thus amply secured.
INCREASE OF POPULATION.
The progress of the population and its number at the end of
the last five decades may he seen from the following figures :
In 1841 there were 149,669.
„ 1851 „ „ 197,168, after giving up 68,335 to Victoria.
~1861 „ „ 358,278, after giving up 25,000 to Queensland.
„ 1871 „ ~ 519,182.
„ 1881 „ „ 781,265.
At present the population is about 800,000, and is rapidly
increasing. Last year there was a net gain of 43,085 persons.
The increase in population was 49T0 per cent, during the
last ten years, or 4*91 per cent, annually; hut in such a vast
country, abounding in wealth and resources, there is ample
room for a population of twenty millions. The proportion
of the sexes is, males 54'71, and females 46’29 per cent.
The nationalities of those resident in New South Wales at
the taking of the Census in April, 1881, were as follows:
Born in New South Wales ... ... ... ... 465,559
Born in other Australian Colonies ... ... ... 44,708
Aborigines (civilized) ... ... ... ... 1,643
Born in Great Britain, Ireland
and other British
possessions
208,512
Total British subjects ... ... ... 720,422
Born in Foreign Countries ... ... ... ... 28,516
Unspecified and born at sea... ... ... ... 2,530
Total 751,468


At the Census of 1881 there were 135,326 inhabited houses,
6,016 houses not inhabited, and 2,398 houses in course of
construction. Comparing the increase in the number of the
habitations of the people during the last two decennial
periods, there was an increase of 45,133 for 1872-81, against
34,036 in the previous decade. The returns also indicate
that the buildings erected of late years are of a thoroughly
substantial character, there being an increase of 15,920 stone
or brick houses for the period 1871-81, against 9,858 for
1861-71.
IMMIGRATION.
Immigrants are selected by the Agent-General or his
officers in London, and selection is limited to such adults
as can pay towards the cost of their passage as follows: —
£5 each for married couples and single men; £2 each for
single women. Children under three years of age, in charge
of their parents, have a free passage; and children between
three and fourteen years are brought out for half the amount
payable by adults. The selection is made from England,
Scotland, and Ireland, proportionately to the number of
people of these nationalities already in the Colony, as shown by
the last Census; but 10 per cent, may be selected from other
European countries. Sound health and good moral character
are indispensable qualifications. Married couples must
not exceed thirty-five years of age, and are taken with or
without children; unmarried men or women must not exceed
thirty years of age; and not more than one-third of the male
immigrants are to be unmarried. When the age exceeds
these limits, the contribution for passage money is increased
to £l5. Mechanics, farmers, miners, vine-dressers, labourers,
and domestic servants are chosen with a special view to the
requirements of the industrial callings of the Colony. Small
working capitalists in any branch of colonial industry are
deemed highly eligible.


Deposits may be made either with the Agent-General in
London, or with the Agent for Immigration or Clerks of
Petty Sessions in the Colony. No advantage is allowed in
respect of any person brought out as a cabin or intermediate
cabin passenger. Deposits are returned when from a just
cause the persons in whose behalf they have been made
do not emigrate, unless in cases of fraud or concealment of
facts, or (in the case of persons who have made their deposits
within the three Kingdoms) when a passage has been actually
provided, but an emigrant may be authorized to remain for
another ship. Deposits in excess are returned.
On arrival in the Colony, married couples, children, and
single men are permitted to remain on board ship seven days
if necessary; unmarried women are provided for in the
Immigrants’ Home for fourteen days; and immigrants pro-
ceeding to the interior receive free passes by railway.
An Act was lately passed for restricting the influx of
Chinese.

THE LAND POLICY.
The leading principles of the existing Land policy are —free
selection before survey over all unreserved lands, and deferred
payments. Conditional purchase of not less than 40 nor more
than 640 acres may he made by any person not under sixteen
years of age; and so soon as the conditions of residence
are fulfilled a further area of 640 acres can he selected, and
adjoining land to the extent of three times the area of the
purchase or purchases may he taken up under pre-emptive
lease, at an annual rental of £2 per section of 640 acres.
Applications for conditional purchases must he accom-
panied by a deposit of ss. per acre. The balance of the
purchase money, 15s. per acre, may rest for three years,
without interest; and if not paid then, or within three years


thereafter, may be deferred from year to year, subject to
interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum. Payments
may be made by instalments of Is. per acre, and two or more
such payments may be made in any year, until the debt —
principal and interest —shall be extinguished. Residence for
five years is required, and improvements to the extent of
10s. per acre must be made. Pastoral tenants may purchase,
under the right of improvement, limited portions of their
runs. The total area of land alienated by grant or sale
amounts to 18,410.458 acres, and there still remained un-
alienated 179,286,414 acres on the 31st December, 1881.
The law offers every facility for the acquirement of land.
Land titles, once registered under Torrens’ ,Act, can never
be questioned. n

ROADS, RAILWAYS, AND TRAMWAYS.
At present New South Whales is expending three millions
annually on permanent public works. More than 23,522 miles
of common roads are open, affording intercommunication
with every part of the interior and greatly facilitating the
carrying of farm and other produce to the best markets.
About £5,000,000 have been spent in ten years on common
roads alone, and construction is still rapidly going on.
Mail coaches run through every district. During the last
quarter of a century more than 50 miles of public bridges
have been constructed. About 5,000 miles of road are
metalled, 1,600 miles are graded mountain passes, and the
remainder for the most part drained and cleared, with bridges
where required. There are eighty-seven public ferries, four
of which are worked by steam, and the number is yearly
increasing, notwithstanding that many of the most important
are being replaced by iron and stone bridges.


Railways were commenced in New South Wales by a private
Company. In 1855 the Government obtained an Act enabling
it to purchase the railways and plant of the Company, and
since that time railway construction has been carried on
almost exclusively by the Government. The central moun-
tain range delayed the progress of construction, by present-
ing great engineering difficulties, but these have been over-
come, and lines now cross the range north, south, and west.
The Great Northern line starts from Newcastle, and has
been opened to Armidale, a distance of 260 miles in a north-
easterly direction, and to Narrabri 252 miles to the north-
west. It is intended to connect the Main Northern line with
Queensland 033. the north and Sydney on the south, the distance
to the latter place being about 100 miles by rail. The Great
Western and the Great Southern lines both start from Sydney.
The former, passing through Bathurst, the capital of the
west, has been finished to Nevertire, a distance of 311 miles,
and is under construction to Bourke on the river Darling.
The latter, through Goulburn, has reached Albury, the border
town between New South Wales and Victoria, a distance of 386
miles to the south, and Hay, 454 miles to the south-west,
and will probably before long be extended to the borders of
South Australia. The works are considerably delayed for
want of labour. Trial surveys have been completed for many
miles south, west, and north. The number of miles of rail-
way opened in 1881 was 274-J, including extensions on the
Great Northern and North-western lines, Great Southern
line and Great Western line. In addition to this, 504 addi-
tional miles of railway on these and other lines are in course of
construction, and Parliament has further authorized the con-
struction of 436 miles. The last link of the intercolonial line
from Sydney to Melbourne, consisting of a mile or two of railway
and an expensive bridge over the river Murray, which separates
the Colonies of New South Wales and Victoria, will soon be


completed. The Great Southern and Great Western lines
and the Great Northern line are to he connected by a junction
railway which will unite the whole railway system of the
Colony, and, when gaps are filled up, complete railway con-
nection between the several Colonies on the Australian
continent. Coast lines running north and south from the
capital, and branches to act as feeders to the main lines are
being extended in various directions. In all there are nearly
1,285 miles of railway open in New South Wales. As the
railways in the Australasian Colonies nearly all belong to the
State, they can always be made to pay interest upon the cost
of construction. In 1881, on a total of 995 miles open in
this Colony, the entire earnings were £1,444,226, and the
working expenses £738,334, yielding a net return of £705,892,
or nearly 5J per cent. Eor 1882 the revenue received from
railways and tramways was £1,828,093. When it is taken
into account that money to make these lines can be borrowed
for 4 per cent., the returns received from their operation will
be seen to be very satisfactory. The railways of the Colony
are amongst the most substantial in the world, some of
the iron bridges and viaducts being extremely costly. The
zigzag, which occurs on the Great Western line, near the
summit level, is a most skilful engineering work. The
passenger accommodation is unusually complete, including
palace sleeping-cars. The total amount of money expended
on Government Hallways in New South Wales to the end
of 1881 was £13,301,597, and the expenditure on unfinished
lines to the end of the year was £1,781,116. In order to
accommodate the great passenger traffic to the Sydney Inter-
national Exhibition of 1879, a steam tramway was laid down
from the Hedfern Hallway Station to the vicinity of the
Garden Palace, and the success attending the experiment led
to the construction of tram lines to several of the suburbs
of the city. Twelve miles of tramway were open in 1881,


and 7,090,125 passengers carried. During 1881 the tram-
way coaching receipts were £62,519, and the expenditure
£52,107, leaving £10,442 as net earnings over working
expenses. In 1882 the tramway earnings amounted to
£126,170, and in 1883 it is estimated that they will reach
£150,000. By the end of 1882, 30 miles had been com-
pleted, forming a network of communication between the
city and principal eastern and southern suburbs.

In six years the ratable value of municipal property in New
South Wales has doubled. In 1881 the ninety municipali-
ties of New South Wales collected a total revenue of
£525,189. Sydney alone attained £261,973, including the
water and sewerage services. The estimated annual value
of ratable property in the suburban and country municipali-
ties amounted to £2,330,946, and in Sydney to £1,449,857.
POST OFFICES AND TELEGRAPHS.
Wherever there is a township there is a post office, and
every village in the farthest interior has its postal communi-
cation. The postage on letters within Australia is 2d. per
oz., while newspapers are carried free. The average
number of letters posted in the Colony in proportion to its
population in 1881 was thirty-one to each person, a fact
which indicates much commercial activity and intelligence.
The ocean mails are carried by the Peninsular and Oriental
S.N. Co., via Colombo and Melbourne; by the Pacific Mail
Steamship Co. via San Francisco ; by the Queensland Boyal
Steamers via Torres Straits; by the Orient S.N. Co. via
Plymouth or via Naples ; by the Netherlands-India S.N. Co.;


and by the Messageries Maritimes (French line), via
Marseilles. Of these the P. and 0. S.N. Co. and the Orient
S.N. Co. despatch their steamers fortnightly.
Telegraph lines intersect the country in every direction.

in the newspapers.
EDUCATION.
The Educational system of New South Wales is under the
control of the Minister of Public Instruction. Teachers are
recognized as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries.
The school fees are paid into the Treasury as revenue.
In addition to public schools, evening public schools, pro-
visional schools, and superior public schools have been es-
tablished, and itinerant teachers and work-mistresses are
provided for. The necessary steps are also being taken
to establish High Schools where practicable. The Colony
is apportioned for purposes of inspection into one metro-
politan and six country districts, under a Chief In-
spector and District Inspectors. A Chief Examiner super-
vises the training school for candidates, and, with his
assistants, reports upon the papers of teachers seeking classifi-
cation. The school attendance and payment officer attends
to the payment of fees, and to the obligatory attendance of
children between six and fourteen years of age. The school
fee averages 3d. per week per child. Provision is made for
educating children who are unable to pay school fees, and for
schools for neglected children. A Local Board is appointed


for each school district. Public Schools are erected
wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational
Schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general
religious instruction is provided for. It may be imparted
in Public Schools, by the teachers; and clergymen of the
various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour
a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective
churches. During the last twenty years over £3,200,000
has been expended on Primary Schools, giving an average
of £160,000 per annum, or ss. per head of the mean
population. In 1881 the Parliamentary grant for public,
instruction was £525,865, or 14s. per head of population.
One of the best proofs of the educational progress of New
South Wales is shown by the fact that the percentage of
illiterates over ten years of age to the total population
declined from 2957 per cent, in 1861 to 2274 in 1871, and
to 14-51 in 1881. In 1881 176,982 children attended the
Public Schools, and there were 20,430 pupils in Private
Schools.
The University of Sydney was established and endowed
in 1851. Its guaranteed annual income from public funds is
£5,000, which is largely added to by special votes and private
donations, so that it obtained last year three times that
amount. It has the power of granting degrees in arts, law,
medicine, and science. Decently several faculties have been
added to its curriculum. Graduates are entitled to the
same rank, style, and precedence as those of Universities
within the United Kingdom. The Sydney University has
several Denominational Colleges affiliated to it. In the
metropolis there is a public Grammar School and a Techni-
cal College for working men, and in the country towns
nearly a hundred Mechanics’ Schools of Arts. There are also
a Royal Society, a Medical, a Linnean, and an Art Society,
with many other Educational Associations of a like character.


The Fine Art Gallery of New South Wales is a kindred
institution to the English National Gallery, and already there
has been made an excellent and somewhat extensive collec-
tion of paintings, drawings, and sculpture, to which the
admission is free. The Parliament votes £5,000 annually to
he spent in works of art, and this amount is supplemented
by donations. The present gallery is only a temporary
building, hut the Government is about to erect an edifice
that will he worthy of its great object and of Australia.
The Art Society of New South Wales has exhibitions of
original productions twice a year, and has become the nucleus
of an Australian School of Art.
SOCIAL CONDITION.
Nearly all European institutions have firmly rooted them-
selves in Australia. All phases of society and every religious
sect have their representatives here, as in England. Every
town, and almost every interest, has its newspaper; and
Banks have been established wherever a competent popula-
tion has concentrated. The laws are efficiently administered,
and life and property are eminently secure. The means of
gaining a livelihood are comparatively easy, and in sufficient
variety, while the intellectual, aesthetic, and moral progress of
the Colony is keeping pace with its industrial occuj)ations.
The religious persuasions at the taking of the Census
of 1881 were as follows :—Church of England, 342,359;
Lutherans, 4,836; Presbyterians, 72,545; Wesleyan Metho-
dists, 57,049 ; other Methodists, 7,303; Congregationalists,
14,328; Baptists, 7,307; Unitarians, 828; other Protestants,
9,957; total Protestants, 516,512; Homan Catholics, 207,020;
Catholics undescribed, 586; total Catholics, 207,606; He-
brews, 3,266; other persuasions, 1,042; unspecified per-
suasions, 13,697; Pagans, 9,315. There arc 739 ministers of


religion and 1,389 churches, with an average attendance
at public worship of 221,031 persons. The Sunday Schools
have 101,092 scholars on their registers.
TRADE AND COMMERCE.
New South Wales is most advantageously situated for
purposes of trade and commerce. It is the centre of the
group of Australasian Colonies and the entrepot of the
islands in the South Pacific, the coast of the vast American
continent, and is in easy and constant communication with
the continents of Asia and America. More than one-half of
the Australian shipping is owned in the Colony. The inward
and outward tonnage of 4,357 vessels engaged in the trade in
1881 was 2,786,500 tons, against 1,500,479 tons in 1871.
That the last ten years are worthy of being termed a
decade of prosperity for the Colony will he seen by noting
the increases shown by the following figures :
1852 to 1861 £57,650,053
1862 to 1871 84,832,363
1872 to 1881 133,070,409

in 1862-71 to £262,679,613 in 1872-81, an increase of
£103,000,000, or 65 per cent, on the latter period. The

Although the trade between the Australasian Colonies and
Great Britain was very large, that between the Colonies
themselves was even greater, and immense good has been
effected by this commercial interchange.
The total value of the trade in 1881 amounted to—
Imports, £17,409,326; Exports, £16,049,503; or in all
£33,458,829, with a balance in favour of Imports of
£1,359,823. These figures exhibit an import trade of
£22 17s. and an export trade of £2l Is. 6Jd. per head
of the population, which is higher than those of any other
Colony of the Australasian group, both in the aggregate
amount and in value per head of population. The Imports
from the United Kingdom amounted to £8,968,838, and
the Exports to £7,561,114. Trade with the other British

Imports from Eoreign States amounted to £1,789,381, and
Exports to £1,298,845.
Eoreign Imports were principally from the United States,
£587,865; Erance, £64,118 ; Germany, £124,910 ; Bel-
gium, £21,579; China, £466,830; Java, £200,348; New

The following table exhibits the increase of trade, compared
with the Census population, in decennial periods: —
Population at Census. Trade. Per head.
The public revenue has increased from £532,718 in 1851
to £6,714,327 in 1881. Of the latter amount about
£1,500,000 was obtained from Customs, £192,500 for stamps,
and £115,962 from licenses. The land sales amounted
to £2,821,000, and the receipts from the national railways to
£1,444,000. The revenue from taxation is officially given at
£2 6s. 6d. per head of the population for 1881. The tariff,
which is established for purposes of revenue only, is one of the
simplest in Australasia, free trade being the avowed policy
of the Colony.
The industrial stability of the Colony is manifested by the
operations of its Banks, as during the past decade their progress


far exceeded the increase in population, their circulation
having nearly doubled, their deposits and advances more
than doubled, and their coin and bullion reached nearly half
as much again. On the 30th September, 1882, the deposits
in the New South Wales Banks amounted to nearly
£22,214,681 sterling. Deposits in the Savings’ Banks
during the last ten years have increased per head of
population from £1 17s. 6d. to £3 125., and the large
amounts to the credit of the depositors clearly show the
existence of both prosperity and thrift amongst the working-
classes. The Public Debt of New South Wales, on the
31st December, 1881, amounted to £16,924,019, or £2l
13s. 2fd. per head of population, and is only equal to
years’ revenue.
MAIL ROUTES.
Mail communication has been improved by the estab-
lishment of several important ocean services, some subsidized
by one or more of the Colonies, and others maintained
by private enterprise. Amongst the subsidized lines is
one between Sydney and San Prancisco, maintained by
the Colonies of New South Wales and New Zealand, at
a joint annual cost of £72,500. This line enables regular
four-weekly communication to be maintained between
Sydney and the United Kingdom by way of America,
and affords great commercial advantages, as well as sup-
plying a very convenient means of passenger traffic. The
other subsidized lines are, one from Melbourne, by way of
Suez, once a fortnight; and one from Brisbane, by way of
Torres Straits and Suez, monthly. In addition to the ser-
vices maintained under mail contracts, there is regular fort-
nightly communication by the Orient steamers. The steamers
of the Orient Company have made the voyage between


London and Sydney in forty-two days ; but owing to railway
communication between Sydney and Melbourne, mails are
delivered in the former city under forty days from London.
RIVERS AND HARBOURS.
Besides the rivers which flow into the Pacific, the mouths
of which form sea-ports available for trade, there are
several harbours along the coast. The coast-line is well
lighted from north to south, and large sums of money are
annually spent in improvements connected with the harbours
and rivers. Storm signals are placed on all the principal
promontories, which, together with the sea-ports, are con-
nected with Sydney by telegraph. The following are the
principal harbours:—
Trial Bay, midway between Sydney and Queensland, is
an excellent refuge for all classes of ships during
S. and S.E. gales.
Fort Stephens, 25 miles north of Newcastle, runs into
the country due west for about 14 miles, and has
even a larger water area than Port Jackson.
Newcastle, at the mouth of the Hunter, is the great coal
port of the Colony, and is provided with every
modern steam and hydraulic appliance for loading
coal. Vessels of 2,000 tons burden can berth
there.
Broken Bay, 16 miles north of Sydney Heads, at the
mouth of the Hawkesbury, is a fine harbour with
a bold entrance, but inferior to Port Jackson in
the draught of water at the entrance.
Fort Jackson, unsurpassed in the world, is separately
described below.


Botany Bay , 8 miles south of Sydney, and connected
therewith by tramway, has an area of 20 square
miles.
Jervis Bay , a large and sheltered hay in the south, is at
present mainly resorted to as a harbour of refuge.
Twofold Bay , in the south, is 5 miles from east to west,
and 3 miles broad.
Besides the above there are Wollongong, Kiama, Shoal-
haven, Ulladulla, and Moruya, small harbours on the south-
east coast, where breakwaters, wharves, and jetties, adapted
to the coasting trade, have been constructed. Most of the
southern ports are being connected with the metropolis by
railway.
The works for providing Sydney with an abundant supply
of fresh water are being rapidly carried out, and will prove
invaluable to the metropolitan district for sanitary and manu-
facturing purposes. The long tunnel to connect the waters of
the Nepean and Cordeaux Rivers with those of the Cataract
will be 4 miles 2,387 feet in length, of which 2,990 yards have
been already driven, and it will be capable of discharging
97 million gallons of water daily. The Cataract Tunnel,
commencing at the Cataract River at Broughton Pass, will
terminate near the road at Brook’s Point, and when completed
will be 9,724 feet in length, and capable of discharging
155 million gallons per day. The sum of £378,000 has been
already expended on these water-works. A sum of £250,000
has been authorized for supplying country towns with water,
and about a fifth of this amount has been already expended
to meet the pressing requirements of the mining townships in
the northern, and of many of the principal towns in the
southern and western districts.


SYDNEY AND ITS HARBOUR.
The magnificent expanse of water called Port Jackson,
with its lake-like scenery, stretching away some 10 miles
inland, is unrivalled as a harbour both for beauty and con-
venience. The high and rocky coast of the Pacific is suddenly
broken, and the cliffs form a portal to an estuary of
sufficient capacity to shelter all the navies in the world.
So completely is the harbour shut in, that, until an entrance
is fairly effected, its capacity and safety cannot be con-
jectured. A vessel making the port sails in a few moments
out of the long swell of the ocean into calm deep water,
protected on every side by high lands. The elevated shore
is broken into innumerable bays and inlets, extending inland
for miles. Some of the bays form of themselves capacious
harbours. The depth of water is sufficient for the largest
ships afloat. The harbour of Port Jackson proper has an
area of 9 square miles, Middle Harbour, one of its arms,
3 square miles, and the shore-line of the whole is 54 miles.
Prom the heads to the city the distance is 4 miles, beyond
which the waters extend for 8 miles further. The breadth
varies from three-quarters of a mile to over 2 miles. There
are nearly 5 miles of Government and private wharves.
The greatest length of the city, including the suburbs, is
about 4 miles north and south, and the greatest breadth
about 6 miles east and west. There are more than 100 miles
of streets, including minor thoroughfares. The population,
including the suburbs, is about 225,000, and is rapidly
increasing, especially in the suburbs. The Botanic Gardens,
Government Domain, Hyde Park, Prince Alfred Park, Bel-


more Park, Victoria Park, Wentworth Park, Moore Park,
and other reserves in the city, with an area of nearly 800
acres, furnish ornamental grounds easily accessible for
recreation.
Handsome and commodious public offices, hanks, ware-
houses, and buildings of every kind are now being erected;
indeed the City of Sydney, generally, may he said to he under-
going a process of reconstruction, and will in a short period
vie with any city in the world, not only as regards the
beauty of its situation, but also in the architectural skill dis-
played in the design and execution of its public buildings.
PASTORAL WEALTH AND PROGRESS.
Probably no other country in the world has such resources,
or can show such progress in pastoral enterprise as New
South Wales. Natural pastures exist all over the Colony,
but especially in the western districts, where many varieties
of the best fattening grasses, herbage, and salt-bush flourish.
The pastoral holdings are constantly increasing in value,
and very remunerative prices are being obtained for
wool and live stock. The total area leased for pastoral
purposes in 1881 is returned at 226,083 square miles, the
rent being £268,083. There were 1,336 pastoral runs in
1881, some of them over 300,000 acres in extent. There are
many men in the Colony who beginning life as shepherds
have realized wealth and affluence, and thousands have made
competent incomes, while several of the “ squatters, ”
developed into landed proprietors, possess more than a
hundred thousand sheep depastured on their own freehold
estates.


LIVE STOCK.
The fine-woolled sheep of the Colony came originally from
the choicest flocks of France, Spain, and Saxony. In the
process of acclimatisation there has been a very decided im-
provement in the softness, elasticity, and length of the wool,
and lately, by careful culling, a considerable increase in the
weight. The average clip is from to 6 lbs. of greasy and
about 3 lbs. of washed wool. The average lambing is 80 per
cent. The total increases in the number of sheep for the
Australasian Colonies for the twenty years from 1861 to 1880
inclusive are computed by the Chief Inspector of Stock to
he as follows : —New South Wales, 628 per cent.; Victoria,
per cent.; South Australia, 112 J per cent.; Queens-
land, 70J per cent.; Tasmania, 4J per cent.; New Zealand,
474 per cent.
Those who have imported and used Austrian and German
rams find that the tendency of the country and climate is to
gradually add to the length of the staple without much in-
creasing the stoutness of the fibre; retaining at the same
time its soundness, softness, and colour, and even improving
in that lustre and fineness which makes a combing wool
specially valuable. The coarse-woolled sheep are chiefly
depastured in the Coast districts, where they thrive better
than the merinos. Three-year-old wethers of this breed
weigh when killed from 1601bs. to 2001bs. each.
The production of wool has been largely increased in New
South Wales by fencing and subdividing the runs, utilizing
the outside country, and providing a better water supply
by means of dams and reservoirs, so that this industry is in a
far better position than it was twenty years ago. The value
of the export of wool from New South Wales amounted to
£7,149,787 in 1881, as compared with £4,748,160 in 1871.

In 1881 the value of pastoral exports,including wool, tallow,.
skins, salt and preserved meats, and live stock, amounted to
£8,816,089, or 2J millions increase upon the returns for 1871.
The value of the local consumption is in addition to this large
amount. Out of the 29 millions increase in the number of
live stock in the Australasian Colonies during the last
decade, two-thirds or 19J millions were additions to those of
New South Wales, and they now reach millions, against
a total of 88J millions for the whole of the settlements.
The principal breeds of horned cattle are Shorthorns,.
Herefords, and Devons. A few Ayrshires have lately been
imported. The finer specimens will compare favorably
with most in England. Agricultural Societies hold yearly
exhibitions of stock and produce in the chief districts of the
Colony, and some hulls and cows have realized over 1,000
guineas each. Eoot and mouth disease, rinderpest, and
other malignant diseases of cattle are unknown in New South
Wales.
All breeds of horses thrive exceedingly well. Animals
worth £2O here average about £BO in India. India draws
largely from New South Wales for remounts for her cavalry
regiments.
The following returns show the progress and resources of
New South Wales in the matter of live stock :
Horses. Horned cattle. Sheep. Pigs.

1881 ... 364,306 ... 2,182,226 ... 36,591,946 ... 308,205


It will be seen from the above returns how great is the
annual increase in stock of all descriptions, and how eminently
adapted to pastoral purposes are the vast interior plains of the
Colony. Perhaps in no part of the world do animals thrive
and fatten more readily or with less cost than in Australia,
the breeder incurs no expense in housing or in providing
fodder for the winter, the climate being very mild throughout
the year.
AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES.
There are immense tracts of country adapted for profitable
cultivation. The operations of agriculture or husbandry are
never suspended by winter, and crops of some sort or other
may be produced in succession from January to December.
Prom the agricultural returns for New South Wales for the
year 1881, it appears that the number of occupiers of land,
excluding pastoral tenants, was 39,351; the extent of
holdings, 27,692,209 acres; land in cultivation, 615,068 acres;
land enclosed but not in cultivation, 21,998,185 acres ; and
land unenclosed, 5,018,656 acres. Many poor farmers who
began with small holdings have attained to wealth and
independence. More than 76,000 persons, or nearly a tenth
of the entire population of the Colony, are connected with
agricultural pursuits.
CEREALS, FRUITS, &c.
The best wheat-growing districts are to be found on the
table-lands, from 2,000 feet to 1,000 feet above the sea-
level. The fine quality of the wheat grown on the Australian
continent is well known, and New South Wales can claim to
produce some of the best samples. The yield during the
season 1881-2 was 1535 bushels per acre. The area of land
in New South Wales under grain crops and the quantity of


produce obtained was as follows : —Wheat, 221,888 acres,
yielded 3,405,966 bushels; maize, 117,478 acres, yielded
4,930,956 bushels; barley, 6,427 acres, yielded 135,218
bushels; oats, 16,348 acres, yielded 356,566 bushels; rye,
889 acres, yielded 14,677 bushels; millet, 200 acres, yielded
2,519 bushels; sorghum and imphee, 29 acres, yielded 102
tons. The acreage and produce of hay crops was —Wheat,
39,428 acres, yielding 42,378 tons; barley, 2,089 acres,
yielding 4,328 tons ; oats, 86,088 acres, yielding 100,773 tons;
sown grasses, 19,005 acres, yielding 51,053 tons. The area
under green crop for cattle was—Maize, 3,976 acres; barley,
2,774 acres ; oats, 1,802 acres ; rye, 521 acres; millet, 164
acres; sown grasses, 63,095 acres; sorghum and imphee,
3,492 acres.
Tobacco is grown chiefly in the northern coast districts
and in the south-west. The quantity produced has varied
considerably from year to year, and last year reached
2,050,832 lbs.
Maize is raised throughout the coast districts as far south
as the 36th parallel of latitude. The cultivation is easy, and
the crop is soon ready. A failure is rarely known. The
yield on the richer descriptions of land has been 80 and 100
bushels an acre for the first crop, and 65 bushels an acre
afterwards. The average on the whole crop of the Colony
in 1881 was 42 bushels an acre. Large quantities are annually
exported.
Sugar-cane is now cultivated to a large extent; and the
acreage under cane increases largely year after year. In
1882 there were 12,168 acres under tillage, of which 4,984
acres produced 17,813,376 lbs. of sugar. The sugar-growing
districts are on the northern rivers. In 1881 4,465 acres
yielded 7,300 tons of sugar at the rate of nearly If ton per acre,


and of the aggregate value of over £200,000. The Sorghum
or imphee, which has so much saccharine matter, thrives well.
The cultivation of the Vine is fast becoming a leading
industry in the Colony. There are districts of sufficient
area, and combining the necessary conditions of soil, climate,
and aspect to produce wine enough to supply the whole of the
world. The vine was introduced by Mr. John Macarthur
about 1820, and in 1831 Mr. Busby made a voyage to
Europe, and brought out a valuable collection of plants from
Prance and from the Rhine. This was really the parent stock
of the vine in New South Wales. Wine-growing is an in-
dustry that requires time to bring it to perfection, but Aus-
tralian wines are stated by connoisseurs to be rapidly improving
in quality. Exhibiting abroad, under many disadvantages,
colonial vignerons have won high distinction at all the late
International Exhibitions—especially at that recently held
at Bordeaux. The judges of wine at the late Sydney Inter-
national Exhibition, consisting of representatives from every
wine-producing country in the world, recorded a unanimous
opinion to the effect that Australian wines are on the whole
excellent in quality, and destined to enter into successful
competition in the markets of Europe. One of the judges
compared the Valleys of the Hunter and the Paterson with
those of the Gironde and the Garonne, from which the best
Prench wines are obtained, stating that as the climate and
soil of the former are both favourable to wine production,
the wines made in the Colony will every year become more
like the celebrated vintages of Prance. The yield of wine
has averaged from 100 gallons to 700 gallons per acre, though
certain kinds of grapes have produced over 1,000 gallons
per acre. The area of land occupied by vines in 1881
was 4,027 acres; the quantity of wine produced from 2,597
acres being 513,688 gallons, and of brandy 3,522 gallons.


Grapes for table use covered an area of 940 acres, and
the quantity picked was 1,103 tons. Fortunately phylloxera
is yet unknown in this Colony.
All the fruits of northern and southern Europe are grown
with success. The orange is cultivated most extensively, the
area so planted being 6,301 acres in 1881, while the fruit
gathered amounted to 5,164,134 dozens. As many as 10,000
oranges have been obtained from individual trees. Oranges
are largely exported to the neighbouring Colonies, and many
proprietors of orangeries who began life in a very small
way have realized a fortune. The olive, caper, fig, straw-
berry, raspberry, gooseberry, currant, custard-apple, guava,
banana, arachis nuts, almonds, passion-fruit, loquat, quince,
plum, nectarine, pear, apple, and peach all thrive. Gardens
and orchards covered in 1881 an area of 15,541 acres. Fruit
is cheap, and is consumed in large quantities by all classes.
The potato grows well, and the yield is large. Barley,
oats, &c., are grown chiefly for fodder. Lucerne hay may
be cut from four to six times in the year in favourable sea-
sons on the alluvial flats. Mangold-wurzel, turnips, and
pumpkins are used for the artificial feeding of the choicest
cattle, but the native grasses are quite sufficient for ordinary
fattening purposes. Arrowroot thrives; cotton succeeds well
on the northern rivers. The bark of several indigenous acacias
is used for tanning purposes. The Eucalypti and other native
trees have valuable medicinal properties. The Boehmeria,
commonly known as the rheea (or grass-cloth plant of China),
and the New Zealand flax are grown easily. The mulberry-tree
thrives, and the finest varieties of the silkworm have been
introduced with success.


MINERAL WEALTH.
New South Wales abounds in minerals. The aggregate
value mined in New South Wales up to the end of 1881 was
£55,077,508 ; made up of the following amounts: —Gold,
£34,343,857; silver, £178,405; coal, £12,255,308; kerosene
shale, £581,047; tin, £4,339,577; copper, £3,213,558 ; iron,
£117,357; antimony, £29,176; lead, £5,025; asbestos, £323;
bismuth, £2,729; mixed minerals, £11,147. The number of
miners employed in New South Wales was 18,873, engaged
in the following mines : —Alluvial gold, 7,109; quartz ditto,
1,947; tin, 4,530; copper, 1,177; bismuth, 12; coal, 4,297.
The total area under mineral lease and application to lease
was 111,014 acres. The value of the minerals raised during
the ten years ending 1841 was £81,275 ; 1851, £634,937;
1861, £14,276,637 ; 1871, £16,638,574; 1881, £23,441,890.
GOLD.
The Gold-fields extend with short intervals throughout the
entire length of the Colony. The approximate auriferous area
as far as known is about 70,000 square miles. It is highly
probable that rich and extensive gold-fields will be discovered
for many years to come. There are immense tracts in the
interior which have not yet been prospected.
All the principal gold-fields of the west are within two days’
journey of the capital, and there is not any mining settle-
ment which may not be easily reached. The gold-mining
centres present the appearance of orderly and thriving
townships, with schools, churches, journals, shops, and places
of amusement. The authority to dig or mine for gold
costs only 10s. a year, and entitles its possessor not only to
take up ground for mining, but also to occupy a quarter of an
acre of land for his dwelling, or an acre for a business site.


Mineral licenses are also obtainable at a cost of 20s. per year
entitling the bolder to occupy from four to 640 acres of
Crown Land for the purpose of searching for minerals other
than gold. The number of miners’ rights issued at the
several gold-fields of New South Wales in the year 1881
was 15,554. Mineral leases numbered 1,262, and business
licenses 1,228. The steam-engines employed in quartz-
mining numbered 101, with an aggregate of 1,407-horse
power. There were also 75 crushing machines, and 727
stamp heads. In alluvial mining there were 10 steam-
engines, with an aggregate of 142-horse power.
The quantity of gold received in 1881 for coinage at the
Sydney Mint, the produce of New South Wales, amounted
to 145,478 ounces, of the gross value of £549,918, the average
price per ounce being £3 15s. 7d. The Western Districts
produced 47,310 ounces, the Southern 42,013 ounces, the
Northern 12,831 ounces, and localities not described, 43,324
ounces.
COAL.
The Colony of New South Wales possesses the richest,
most accessible and extensive coal and cannel seams in the
Southern Hemisphere, which must ultimately make it the
greatest and richest of all the Australian Colonies. The
approximate area of the carboniferous strata is estimated at
23,950 square miles, and thick coal seams crop out along the
coast and mountain ranges from Pier Head, near Lake
Macquarie, to Newcastle harbour, a distance of 18 miles
on the northern edge of the great coal basin. Prom Coal
Cliff to near Shoalhaven, a distance of 45 miles at the
southern side of it, and on the western side at the Blue
Mountains, Lithgow Valley, Wallerawang, &c., thick coal
and cannel seams crop out alongside the railway from the


metropolis to the western interior, and in the gorges and
gullies on each side of the line; whilst on the Southern and
Western E-ail ways similar outcrops of coal and cannel coal
occur.
The mines, first opened in 1802, are situated in the imme-
diate vicinity of Newcastle, and it is from there that the
Colony obtains its largest supply, where the shipment of
coal is carried on by hydraulic and steam cranes, and shoots,
capable of loading 16,200 tons per day.
Vertical sections and diagrams of the coal seams worked in
the northern, southern, and western districts are exhibited.
The production of coal has increased very rapidly of late
years. In 1833, 328 tons were raised; whilst in 1881,
1,775,221 tons, valued at £603,348, were raised, at an average
price of 7s. per ton.
The coal is of excellent quality for steam, household,
smelting, and gas purposes, and the largest exports are to
Victoria, Hong Kong, San Francisco, South Australia,
Manila, Japan, Valparaiso, Honolulu, India, Tasmania,
New Zealand, and Queensland, more than 1,000 vessels
being annually engaged in this traffic.
A variety of cannel coal commonly called “kerosene
shale,” similar to the once famous Boghead mineral of
Scotland, but yielding a much larger percentage of volatile
hydro-carbons than the Scotch Boghead, occurs in saucer-
shaped deposits from a few inches to 5 feet thick. The
richest quality yields upwards of 150 gallons of crude oil per
ton, or 18,000 cubic feet of gas, with an illuminating power of
thirty-eight to forty-eight sperm candles, and on this account
it is found advantageous for mixing with ordinary coal in the
manufacture of gas, and is largely exported to Great Britain,


America, and other foreign countries, as well as the neigh-
bouring Colonies, for gas purposes. Two Companies manu-
facture petroleum oil and other products therefrom. The
quantity raised in 1881 was 27,894 tons, valued at £40,748.
COPPER, TIN, &C.
Copper lodes are found in many districts. Some of the
ores are extremely rich. The quantity of copper raised in
the Colony was 5,494 tons in 1881, valued at £355,062,
against 1,452 tons in 1872, valued at £105,888.
The occurrence of Tin was first made known in 1852 hy
the late Eev. W. B. Clarke, hut it was not commercially
worked till 1872. The tin is of the very best quality, and
takes rank beside the Straits Settlements tin in the English
market. Tin-mining shows a much larger development in
New South Wales during the decade than copper-mining,
and the annual value of the metal produced now exceeds
even that of the gold or coal. The quantity of tin raised in
the Colony was 8,200 tons in 1881, valued at £724,003,
against 896 tons in 1871, valued at £47,703.
Other Minercds. —Large deposits of iron ore occur in
many widely separated districts. The principal ore is hema-
tite. In several places there are coal, limestone, and iron in
immediate proximity. At Mittagong in the south, and
Lithgow in the west, iron ore is found in large quantities.
The principal silver-mines are in the northern district. The
ores of lead, zinc, and bismuth, occur also in several localities.
Cinnabar is found in the Mudgee district. Antimony ores are
being increasingly worked in the Macleay and other districts.
Diamonds, opals, rubies, sapphires, and other gems have been
found in various parts. The number of diamonds found in
New South Wales up to the end of 1880 was estimated at
10,000, the largest being one of 5f carats, or 16*2 grains.


INDUSTRIES AND MANUFACTURES.
The progress of New South Wales in manufacturing
industries is very marked. The latest and most approved
labour-saving appliances and steam-driven tools have been
introduced, and the manufacturers here are able to compete
with those of Europe in the supply of many local require-
ments. Some of the manufactures in New South Wales have
a steady export trade, clearly showing that the articles pro-
duced are cheaper and better than those obtainable from any
other source. The Registrar- General has returned the number
of manufactories and works in existence, and the number of
hands employed during the year 1881 to he as follows: —
Connected with or dependent on agriculture, 193 establish-
ments, employing 2,720 hands; working on raw materials
the production of the pastoral interest, 311 establishments,
employing 2,691 hands; manufacture of food of which the
raw material is not the produce of agriculture and of articles
of drink, &c., 289 establishments, employing 2,157 hands;
building materials and plastic manufactories, 821 establish-
ments, employing 5,153 hands ; machine manufactories, brass,
lead, and iron works, 202 establishments, employing 2,968
hands; miscellaneous works and manufactories, 971 establish-
ments, employing 13,857 hands. At the close of the year 1881
there were in operation in New South Wales 159 mills for
grinding and dressing grain, employing 2,913-horse power,
172 stones, and 685 hands.
The waters of the Colony abound with fish. The hays
and estuaries along the coast furnish natural oyster-beds
many miles in length. The whale-fisheries are deserving
of notice, though of late years they have.been neglected.


Wine-making is a settled industry. The wines of the
Alhury district, in the south, are known in all the neigh-
bouring Colonies as well as in London. The produce of the
Hunter Liver districts has won medals at the Great
International Exhibitions of Europe. The production in
1873 was 451,450 gallons of wine and 996 gallons of
brandy; and in 1882 it reached 513,688 gallons of wine
and 3,522 gallons of brandy. The consumption of native
wines is increasing every year in Australia. There were
fifty breweries in 1881, which turn out large quantities of
beer and ale of very fair quality.
Tobacco of local manufacture is finding its way into favour.
Large quantities of Virginian leaf are imported for this
purpose, and the Colonial-grown leaf is also much used.
One of the largest manufacturers of tobacco in the world,
from Virginia in the United States, has fitted up extensive
premises in Sydney. The quantity manufactured in 1881
was 17,629 cwt.
The meats of New South Wales have acquired a great
reputation abroad. Some of the largest steamships trading
to Australian ports are provided with refrigerating chambers,
in which are stored large quantities of fresh meat, frozen in
the carcass, for European markets. Salted, preserved, and
fresh meats to the value of £201,596 were exported in 1881.
The manufacture of jams and confectionery, aerated waters,
&c., gives employment to numerous hands.
The manufacture of leather and the industries in connection
therewith employ nearly 7,000 hands. In 1881 the value of
colonial manufactured hoots and leather exported amounted
to £180,045. Sydney carried off many prizes and medals for
such manufactures at the recent International Exhibitions.
With wool in abundance, the manufacture of cloths ,
tweeds , hlankets i &c., is being developed, and first awards were


won for some of these articles at the last Sydney Industrial
Exhibition. In 1881 the production was upwards of 208,000
yards of cloth and tweeds. There are several large clothing
manufactories giving employment to hundreds of persons.
Illuminating and lubricating oils arc manufactured from
kerosene shale. Soap is largely made, and the weight manu-
factured in 1881 was 106,962 cwt. In the same year tallow
was exported to the value of £267,177, and 10,409 cwt. of
candles were manufactured.
METALS, EARTHS, &c.
In iron the manufactures of New South Wales promise to
attain to large dimensions. The iron foundries and engineer-
ing establishments have produced iron steamships, dredges,
light-houses, locomotives, bridges, cylindrical piers, and agri-
cultural implements. Every description of the heaviest
kinds of rough work, as well as the finest kinds of work
required for engines, is turned out. There are also several
factories for the production of galvanized iron. At Eskhank,
Lithgow, iron is made from its ores, and both wrought iron
and steel are being manufactured.
Eor reducing copper and tin ores there are numerous
smelting-works. The poorer copper ores from neighbouring
Colonies are sent to he smelted near the collieries in New
South Wales. The increased production of mineral ores has
necessitated a corresponding increase in smelting-works, from
ten in 1871 to fourteen in 1881, employing 1,517 hands. In
1881 the export of tin and copper ingots and ores was valued
at over £1,300,000, nearly £1,000,000 worth of which was
mined in New South Wales.


The manufacture of bricks, encaustic tiles, drain-pipes, and
other descriptions of pottery is carried on by the aid of steam-
driven machinery. There is constant building work going
on in the numerous cities and towns which are springing up
in all parts of the country. Sydney especially has of late
years entered on a course of architectural improvement,
the old stores and shops giving place to magnificent ware-
houses and manufactories. Marble, granite, freestone, and
limestone are to be found in abundance in the Colony;
and work in earth and stone furnishes employment to many
thousands of masons, brickmakers, potters, and other artisans.
SHIP-BUILDING, DOCKS, &c.
There is a Government Dock at Cockatoo Island, Port
Jackson, in which H.M.S. “ Galatea,” of 26 guns and 3,227
tons, was docked. Mort’s Dock is also capable of accommo-
dating the largest class of mail steamers that come to the
port. The Australian Steam Navigation Company has a
slip capable of taking up a vessel of 1,500 tons, and
there are also smaller private slips and floating docks.
Another Government Dock is being constructed at Cockatoo
Island, which will take in the largest vessel now afloat.
Thirty-one vessels were built in New South Wales in
the year 1881, consisting of fifteen steamers, five schooners,
five luggers, three cutters, and three ketches, showing an
aggregate of 1,507 tons.
There are numerous varieties of valuable timber in New
South Wales, useful for every description of ship and house
building and furniture. Already there is an export trade in
cut and sawn timber of considerable value. The export in
1881 was valued at £23,816. There are numerous steam
joineries for the supply of woodwork of houses and of furniture.


All the cabs, carriages, carts, drays, omnibuses, and other
vehicles required are made in the Colony, and proof
of the skill of the workmen in this department of industry
may he see in the carriages which daily run along the
thoroughfares of the capital. The reported area of woods
and forests under the care of the Conservator in New South
Wales amounted in 1881 to 3,759,796 acres, and the timber
cut from them during the year amounted to 3,923,727
feet, from which a revenue of £10,156 was obtained.
CONCLUSION.
The object of this pamphlet is to provide such information
as will accurately describe the soil, climate and resources of
New South Wales, as well as to show the actual progress
the Colony has already made. To accomplish this, facts
and figures have been collected from the Statistical Register
and from other authentic sources, which will enable the reader
to readily form an opinion for himself. It is satisfactory to
be able to demonstrate that the Colony has such natural ad-
vantages in its position, its soil, and its great wealth in coal,
iron, gold, copper, tin, and other minerals, that abundance
and happiness pervade all classes of the community, and that
the materials exist for providing the like blessings to many
millions ; that the country is governed by a constitutional
Government and liberal laws, which give every possible
security to life and property. With such natural, political
and educational advantages New South Wales has the
brightest future before her, and cannot fail to become the
home of an immense population of pro'”-'"’ous enlightened
people.
