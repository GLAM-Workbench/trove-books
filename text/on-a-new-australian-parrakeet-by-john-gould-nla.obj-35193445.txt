[From the Phocbedings of the Zoological Society of London,
February 14, 1807.]
On a New Australian Parrakeet.
By John Gould, F.R.S. &c.
Mr. Coxen, of Brisbane in Queensland, having forwarded to me a
correct drawing of a small species of Parrakeet, new to the Austra-
lian avifauna, 1 hasten to bring it under the notice of the Zoological
Society, and to name the bird Cyclopsitta coxeni, in honour of the
gentleman who has been the first to make us aware of the existence
of the species. In size and in some other respects it is nearly allied
to the Cyclopsitta diophthulma of Mysol, but differs in the absence
of scarlet on the crown and the smaller extent of that colour on the
cheeks.
Cyclopsitta coxeni, Gould.
General plumage green; across the forehead a narrow band of
red, which unites through the lores with a large patch of the same
hue on the ear-coverts, beneath which is a patch of blue ; primaries
margined with blue ; a patch of red on the tertiaries near the body ;
tail short and wholly green ; bill very stout and of a horn-colour.
Total length 7\ inches, bill |, wing 3f, tail 2, tarsi
Remark. —In the note accompanying the drawing, Mr. Coxen
states that two examples of this bird were procured by Mr. Waller
from a sawyer, who found them in a scrub on the east coast, where
he was at work, and where he observed the species moving about in
small flocks of from fifteen to twenty in number, and by no means
shy.
