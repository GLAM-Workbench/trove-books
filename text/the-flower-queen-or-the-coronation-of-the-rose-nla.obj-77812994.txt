No. 2?WE ARE THE FLOWERS.
? (Chorus.)
Flowers?
We are the flowers, the fair young flowers,
That come as the voice of Spring,
To deck with our beauty the sylvan bowers,
And perfume the zephyr?s wing.
The blushing Rose, and the Violet meek,
With the hue of morn on its timid cheek,
And the Daisy that blooms in the quiet dell,
The Jessamine sweet, and the Heather Bell.
We are the flowers, etc.
The Marigold, Dahlia, and Sunflower too,
The proud Hollyhock with its gaudy hue,
The Lily, whose home is the pensive spot,
Where it sighs to the gentle Forget-me-not.
We are the flowers, etc.
List! List! There is a footstep near !
Away ! Away ! We must not linger here !
Hie we, then, to the forest shade,
And hide us all in our quiet glade ;
{Retiring) Away 1 away ! away !
{Enter Recluse.)
No. 3?HERE WOULD I REST.
(Song.)
Recluse ?
Here would I rest, within this mossy cell,
Par from the busy scenes of strife and care,
It is a spot where I would love to dwell,
And breathe alone the pure untainted air.
The voice of Fame allures me forth no more,
To win the garlands that so soon must fade ;
Ambition?s wild aspii?ing dream is o?er,
My wishes foiled, my every hope betrayed ;
Wearied I seek repose beneath this peaceful shade.
Here would I rest, etc.


No. 4?REST THEE HERE.
(Semi-Chorus.)
Flowers ?
Rest thee here ; O ! calmly rest,
We will soothe thy throbbing breast
And our sweet and airy numbers,
Stealing o?er thy tranquil slumbers,
Like the streamlet?s gentle flow,
Shall beguile thy every woe.
Recluse ?
Hark ! hark I what sounds are those so passing sweet ?
Flowers ??
Rest thee here, why should?st thou roam
From our bright and blissful home ?
While amid young blossoms straying,
Balmy gales around thee playing,
Hope thy childhood?s hours shall bring,
On her light and sportive wing.
Recluse ?
Again their strange mysterious tones I hear,
Like angel voices stealing on the breeze.
Flowers ?
We will teach thee lessons sweet,
In our cool and soft retreat ;
Here in one harmonious measure
Floats the artless song of pleasure,
And contentment loves to dwell
In our green and mossy dell.
And contentment, etc.
No. S?LOST, LOST IN WONDER.
(Recitative.)
Recluse ?
Lost, lost in wonder, and with rapture fdled,
I gaze enchanted, yet no form I see!
Tell me, ye dark aisles of the forest,
Say who dwells within your dark and secret shades 1
(Enter Rose and Lily.)
No. 6?WOULD?ST THOU KNOW.
(Duet.)
Rose and Lily ?
Would?st thou know what sounds are stealing
Through these fair and rural bowers ?
?Tis no angel voice that greets thee,
But the music of the flowers.
Angel eyes perchance are bending
O?er our silken leaves the while ;
Truth and innocence are blending
In our fond and tender smile.


We are Nature?s artless minstrels,
She hath taught the lays we sing ;
To the worn and weary spirit
Thoughts of happiness we bring ;
In thine ears we softly whisper,
When the earth is lulled to peace.
List thee then, for we are telling
Of a song that ne?er shall cease.
List thee then, etc.
No. 7?o, GENTLE PEACE.
(Song.)
Recluse ?
O, gentle Peace, with thy returning ray,
How flies the dark and dreary night away !
I drink, as in the cloudless noon of youth,
The sacred fount of happiness and truth :
Sing on, sweet flowers, and bear my heart away,
A willing captive to your magic lay ;
Here will I rest, while o?er me gently twine
The creeping ivy and the clustering vine.
(Enter Flowers.)
No. B?WHO SHALL BE QUEEN.
(Chokus.)
Flowers ?
Who shall be Queen ? who shall be Queen ?
Who shall be Queen of the Flowers 1
The summer is coming in beauty arrayed,
And bright bees are humming through forest and
giade;
O?er hill top and mountain is merrily heard
The voice of the fountain and song of the bird.
The fairies are dancing o?er meadow and grove,
And pale stars are glancing like soft eyes of love ;
Then who shall be Queen of our beautiful throng,
To join in our mirth and awake us to song 1
We?ll choose from the fairest that ever were seen,
And gems of the i - arest shall circle our Queen ;
The morning shall linger the fragrance to sip,
Which the dew-drop hath left on her delicate lip.


No. 9?l AM THE FIRST.
(Solo and Chorus.)
Crocus ?-
I am the first of all the flowers
To hail the opening Spring ;
I?ve tales of hope for the lonely heart,
In the sweet perfume I bring.
I was first to rear my head
In this fair and goodly land,
The first of all the flowers to greet
The eyes of the Pilgrim Band ;
And since the first in every clime
Deserves the right to reign,
The honor of being the Queen of flowers
May I not justly claim !
Flowers ?May she not justly claim!
No. 10?PEACE, FALSE PRETENDER.
(Solo and Chords.)
Dahlia ??
Peace, false pretender ! dost presume
With colors rich as mine to vie ?
Look, look upon my beauteous bloom,
And hang thy head and close thine eye.
Flowers?
More kindly words were better far.
My stately form I proudly rear,
When summer skies are beaming bright,
When thou hast closed thy short career,
And day with thee is veiled in night.
Flowers ?
Mere boasting is not proof of worth.
And thou would?st claim our Queen to be ;
Vain flower I treat thy claim with scorn ;
How could thy subjects honor thee,
Since thou would?st die ere they were born ?
Flowers ?-
Since thou would?st die ere they were born.
No. 11??TIS NOT IN BEAUTY.
(Ddet and Chorus.)
Heliotrope and Mignonette?
?Tis not in beauty alone we may find
Purity, goodness, and wisdom combined ;
Forms that are lightest are first to decay,
Hues that are brightest fade soonest away ;
Gentle in manner, in temper serene,
These are the beauties we ask of our Queen.


Flowers ?
Yes, innocence dwells with the humble and meek ;
There lies the treasure, the pearl that we seek.
No. 12?PRIZED BY THE BEAUTIFUL.
(Solo and Chorus.)
Japonica ??
Prized by the beautiful and great,
Mine is a peerless name ;
Who rivals me in loveliness 1
Who will dispute my claim 2
I deck the fairest brows on earth,
And, in the mazy dance,
The ruby lip my smile returns,
And bright eyes on me glance.
Flowers ?
The ruby lip, etc.
No. 13-MAKE WAY, YE SILLY
PRATERS ALL.
(Solo and Chords.)
Flowers ??
But who comes here ? Tis the Sunflower !
Hail! hail! hail !
Sunflower ?
Make way, ye silly praters all, for me,
And know that I alone your Queen should be.
Flowers ?
Hail! hail! hail! Bombastes, ever hail!
Sunflower ?
The golden sun looks on me all the day,
And gives to me at night his last his parting ray ;
For me descends the cool and gentle shower ;
Mine is the noblest form, the broadest flower.
Flowers ?
The noblest form, ho, ho ! The broadest flower,
ho, ho !
The tallest form ?tis true, ho, ho! And face the
largest too, ha, ha !
0, gentle Queen,
Sunflower ?
What need of umpire ? mine the right to reign ;
A right that holds your boasted titles vain ;
Down at my feet and do obeisance now,
And place the coronet upon my brow.
Flowers ?
Down at her feet, ha, ha 1
Hail 1 O gentle Queen.


No. 14?SAY, WHERE IS
FAVOURITE LILY.
(Chorus.)
Flowert ?
Say ! where is our favorite Lily,
The child of the peaceful vale,
The Lily that bows so sweetly
Its head to the laughing gale 1
Doth the dark-eyed Violet linger
Where cooling streams repose,
And where is the fairest and dearest,
Our beautiful, blushing Rose 1
No. 15?SISTER FLOW?RETS WE ARE HERE.
(Duet.)
Lily and Violet ?
Sister Flow'rets we ai-e here,
At your call we now appear ;
Not to tell of beauties rare,
Nor a sparkling crown to wear ;
Rather would we choose to dwell
In our own secluded dell,
And our balmy odours fling
Where the birds so sweetly sing,
While the lowly cot we cheer:
Thus we in our humble sphere
Would be useful while we may,
Till we fade and pass away.
No. 16?THE BALMY ODOURS.
(Sot.o and Chorus.)
Bose ?
The balmy odours which we bear,
And softly breathe o?er all the earth,
The tints our silken leaves may wear,
We owe to him who gave us birth.
Then sacred through life?s fleeting day
We?ll keep the charms so kindly given ;
Our fragrance, when our forms decay,
Shall waft like incense back to heaven.
Flowers ?
Our fragrance, etc.


No. 17?LO! TWILIGHT SHADOWS.
(Recitative.)
Tulip ?
Lo ! twilight shadows gather o?er the hills.
Chant we now our vesper lay,
As we seek our quiet haunts,
And with morning light
Our Queen we?ll choose.
No. 18?BREATHE WE NOW.
(Semi-chorus and Chorus.)
Poppies ?
Breathe we now our charmed fragrance,
So your eyelids soon will close,
And its powers your senses stealing
Lull you to a sweet repose.
You must yield, for we are potent ;
Ye may not resist our sway,
While your fluttering, trembling spirits,
We to fairy land convey.
We have conquered, you are yielding
To our soothing breath so light;
Gently, gently, now we whisper,
Sister flow?rets all, good night.
Flowers ?
What is this, our senses strangely drawing,
By its charmed power away ;
Nodding, gaping, eyelids slowly drooping 1
Yes, we feel and own its sway.
?Tis the Poppies, gently o?er us breathing
Odours from a fairy bower;
Nodding, gaping, eyelids slowly dropping,
Yes, we feel and own their power.
Vain our every efforts to resist them,
Though our little cups We fill
With the dew that sparkles all around us,
We are nodding, nodding still.
No. 19?COME, COME QUICKLY AWAY.
(Chorus.)
Flowers ?
Come, come quickly away !
Soft winds chide our delay ;
Night?s call let us obey :
Come away !
Night, Night, weloome to thee!
Our sleep gentle shrll bo ;
Come, come, happy and free ;
Come away!


Hark ! hark I softly and clear; Come away !
Sweet sounds steal on the ear : Come away !
Come, come quickly away !
Soft winds chide our delay ;
Night?s call let us obey,
Come away !
No. 20?FOLD, O NIGHT.
(Semi-Ciiokus and Song.)
Flowers ?
Fold, O. Night, thy veil around us,
While our silken leaves we close ;
May the heavenly Power that clothes us
Kindly guard our sweet repose ;
Hear our song, O silent night,
Hear our song.
Recluse ?
Hear their song, 0 hear their evening song !
Yes ! here indeed I learn
Your lessons pure and sweet,
And my heart would ever turn,
In this calm and dear retreat,
To that heavenly hope divine,
Which G)d hath kindly given,
And every wish resign
To the Holy Will of heaven.
INTERLUDE.
No. 21?WHEREFORE DOST THOU THUS
ENCHANT ME.
(Duet.)
Nightingale and Rose?
Wherefore dost thou thus enchant me
With thy soft and tender lay?
How thy notes so sweetly tender
Bear me in thy flight away;
O, how fondly do I listen
To the music of thy tone,
Lost to every thought and feeling,
Save the one I may not own.
All, all, save one, all save one.
Flowers ?
Happy Rose, Happy Rose.


No. 22?GOOD MORNING.
(Morning Chorus.)
Flowers ?
Good morning, good morning.
Arise, the blush of morning bright
Now tips the hills with morning light ;
O come, our sister flow?rets all,
List ye to our merry call.
Good morning,
The night hath kindly o?er us wept,
And watched us while we sweetly slept :
While, grateful for another day,
Hail we its returning ray.
Good morning.
No. 23?TO THE CHOICE.
(Chorus.)
Flowers ?
To the choice, to the choice ;
While the morn is blushing o?er us,
Haste to make our happy
(Hollyhock interrupts.)
No. 21?SOFTLY, SOFTLY, DEAR FRIENDS.
(Recitative and Song.)
Hollyhock ?
Softly, softly, dear friends, you?ve quite forgotten me.
Another proof that sweet simplicity'
And real worth too oft aside are thrown;
A truth I must confess I blush to own.
Of course ?tis needless of myself to tell,
Since my superior charms you know so well;
And really, if I now must speak my mind,
A better Queen I?m sure you could not find.
Do as you please; I only would suggest,
In modest terms, the one I deem the best;
Do as you please ; but then it seems to me
You might as well bestow the crown on me.
(Dandelion breaks in.)


No. 25?1 WILL, I WILL.
(Solo.)
Dandelion?
I will ! I will!
Yes, I will go; why should I fear
To take my station with the rest ?
I?m always found in every place among the best.
In vain you bid me go away, it will not do ;
I?ll dare to speak my mind, and tell you what is true.
For I am quite as good as you.
Proudly I stand, why should I fear
The station of your chosen Queen to fill ?
Haste ye away ; bring me the crown,
And I?ll make you all obedient to my will;
Yes! I will, I will.
No. 26?TOUCH ME NOT.
(Solo.)
2?oucli-me-not ?
Touch me not, touch me not, let me alone ;
Keep at a distance, this nook is my own ;
Happy and free in my dwelling so fair.
Touch me not, touch me not, come if you dare.
When the morn?s rosy light looks in my bower,
Kissing the dew-drop away from each flower,
Merrily then through the long summer day,
With the soft zephyr?s wing lightly I play.
Why should I wish for a sceptre or crown,
Blush at your praises, or droop at your frown?
Happy and free in my dwelling so fair,
Touch me not, touch me not, come if you dare.
No. 27?WE LOVE YOU ALL.
(Semi-Chorus and Chorus.)
Flowers ?
We love you all with true sincerity,
And would to either willing subjects be,
Tho? all alike our warmest feelings share,
Yet one alone the coronet must wear.
Who shall be Queen 1 Who shall be Queen ?
Who shall be Queen of the Flowers ?
Let yonder stranger now decide,
And by his judgment we?ll abide.


No. 28?STRANGER, THOU HAST HEARD
OUR CLAIM.
(Semi-Chorus.)
All the Aspirants ?
Stranger, thou hast heard our claim ;
Wilt thou then our Sovereign name ?
Humbly we appeal to thee ;
Tell us who our Queen shall be.
No. 29??TIS HARD TO CHOOSE.
(Song.)
Recluse?
?Tis hard to choose where Nature?s hand
Alike her gifts bestows ;
Here every flower on which I gaze
With richest beauty glows.
Though all our admiration claim,
Yet in the Rose we find
A simple grace, a sweet perfume,
With loveliness combined.
?Tis true that with the gentle flower
A thorn is oft concealed ;
But she who wears a coronet
A sword must sometimes wield.
And since it is my duty now
A Sovereign to propose,
Wisdom must guide me in my choice ;
Say, shall it be the Rose 1
Flowers ?
The Rose our Queen shall be.
No. SO?PREPARE WE FOR THE
FESTIVE SCENE.
(Chorus.)
Flowers ?
Prepare we for the festive scene,
We?ll crown with joy our lovely Queen ;
From rural cot and valley fair
The purest, brightest gems we?ll bear :
The bells shall ring their merry sound,
And o?er the distant hills around,
Where sparkling fountains gently play,
Shall sweetly float our festive lay.
Haste away ! Haste away !


No. 31?WE COME FROM THE PALACE.
(Coronation March.)
Flowers ?
We come from the palace in splendour arrayed,
We come from the mountain, the forest, and glade ;
We come from the cottage, the meadow so green, '
A chaplet to place on the brow of our Queen.
No. 32?RECEIVE THY CROWN.
(Semi-Chorus.)
Receive thy crown, O chief of flowers !
Reign thou the Sovereign of these bowers ?
To thee we now our tribute pay,
And, willing own thy gentle sway.
No. 33?ON THY BROW THE CROWN
WE PLACE.
(Quartette.)
Heliotrope, Lily, Mignonette, and Violet ?
On thy brow the crown we place ;
Deck?d with purity and grace,
May the smile of heaven serene,
Rest upon thee, gentle Queen.
No. 34?LONG LIVE OUR BEAUTEOUS
QUEEN.
(Chorus, with Echo.)
Flowers ??
Long live our beauteous Queen, bright be her reign;
Echo from rock to rock, answers again,
Long live our Queen 1
in our united love, changeless and free,
There be thy greatest power, hail, hail, to thee.
Long live our Queen !
Long live our beauteous Queen, honored and blest,
Peace be around thee still, joy with thee rest.
Long live our Queen 1


No. 35?FILLED WITH GRATITUDE
AND LOVE.
(Song.)
Rose ?
Filled with gratitude and love,
E?er to him who reigns above,
For each hue that round me glows,
And the fragrance He bestows,
Grateful to each heart and voice
That proclaim the Rose your choice,
I accept the crown which now
You have placed upon my brow.
Not with pride, nor feeling vain,
Good alone shall be my aim,
As a sacred trust to me
Shall the crown for ever be.
Thus in confidence sincere
May we each the other cheer ;
Life in sweetest union spend,
Till its fleeting moments end.
No. 36?WE GO TO FULFIL.
(Chorus.)
Flowers ??
We go to fulfil our glad mission on earth,
We praise the great Being, who gave us our birth,
And lessons of meekness and love we impart,
As we whisper of hope to the desolate heart.
In the chamber of sorrow how oft we appear, [tear.
And our leaves are impearled with affection?s warm
We hush the sad meanings of sickness and pain,
And restore to the cheek its bright blushes again.
We go, we go
We smile in the palace, we bloom in the cot,
And there is the dearest, the loveliest spot,
For we list to the prayers that at evening ascend,
Where peace with contentment and innocence blend.
O?er the graves where the loved and the cherished
ones sleep,
We tenderly bow, and we silently weep ;
We?ll ever proclaim to the creatures of earth
The goodness of Him Who has given us birth.
We go, we go


No. 37?1 BLESS THE HAND.
(Duet.)
Recluse ?
I bless the Hand that kindly led
My erring steps these paths to tread,
And taught me from the simplest flower
To trust an over-ruling Power.
O, selfish heart, repine no more,
Awake to life and zeal once more.
Now to the world I?ll haste with joy,
And time in usefulness employ.
Rose ?
Go, we may not bid the stay ;
?Tis duty calls
Recluse ?
And I obey.
Both ?
May peace and joy attend thee still,
And keep thee safe from every ill;
So may we each in different ways
Our great and good Creator praise ;
Thus shall we show by faith and love
His praise, Who ever reigns above.
No 38?LIGHT OF ETERNAL LOVE.
(Finale.)
Rose, Soli and Flowers ?
Light of Eternal Love, gently descending,
Pure from the Throne above, mortals attending,
Guide Thou his onward way, with Thy celestial wing,
Where their enraptured lay Angels shall sing.
Soli ?
Star of Eternal Love, still with him dwell;
Softly we whisper, farewell ! farewell !
Recluse ?
Long on this hallowed scene, memory shall dwell;
Beautiful teachers, farewell ! farewell !
