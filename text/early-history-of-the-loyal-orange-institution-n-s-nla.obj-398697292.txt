Early History, Loyal Orange Institution, N.S.W.
INTRODUCTION.
The history of any great Institution must of necessity be
of historical importance, and this is particularly so in respect
to the Loyal Orange Institution in New South Wales; which
was founded under romantic conditions, and was nurtured during
the most stirring time in the history of Australia, by brave,
devoted men, who risked, not only insults, but in many cases
assaults at the hands of the lawless bigots and racial fanatics.
The early history of the Loyal Orange Institution in New
South Wales and Victoria reveals a remarkable forbearance on the
part of our Orange pioneers, who might have been excused had
they met force with force or had retaliated upon their enemies;
but it rebounds to their credit, as respecters of the law, that they
did not do so.
It is not claimed for this work that it is a record
of the Loyal Orange Institution continuously to later years,
hence the omission of many happenings of comparative
recent date. It does, however, embrace a careful com-
pilation of the most important events, down to generally,
the latter seventies. In the collection of data a labour ot
love, chiefly undertaken by Bro. W. A. Stewart, a former W.M.
and Secretary of Lodge No. 4, N.S.W., many authorities have
been consulted; chief among these are The “Sentinel” news-
paper, 1845 to 1848, The “Observer,” from 1840 to 1845, “Sydney
Morning Herald,” 1834 to 1871, The “Protestant Banner,” 1867-
9, “Protestant Standard,” 1869-1880, McGuffin’s “History of
Orangeism,” G. H. Spark’s “History of the Rise and Progress
of Orangeism,” “Press Contributions” of William Freame, in the
Mitchell Library, Grand Lodge records, and Subordinate Lodge
minutes. Grateful acknowledgment is made of the assistance
rendered by Bro. C. H. Stocker, Grand Secretary; Mrs. Wm.
Alexander, Bros. Jacob Alexander, Charles Chandler, of No. 1;
Thos. Walker, Snr., of No. 248; G. M. Moxham, J.P., of No. 4;
Bro. the Deputy Grand Secretary of Ireland; Bro. W. H. Brewer
(No. 78), a grandson of the late Bro. R. McGuffin; Miss Jane
Reillv, daughter of an old W.M. of No. 3; Mrs. Anger a grand-
daughter of Bro. Richard Driver, Jnr, and also to Captain
Watson, Hon. Research Secretary Australian Historical Society,
for information concerning various old Sydney buildings.


It is worth notice that the first lodge of which we find anv
notice, called “Orange and Blue,” dates from 1726, and it was
formed by the officers of William HI. 4th Regt. of Infantry.
Vide Sibbert’s History of Orangeism.”
During 1/99 most of the English regiments returned home
from Ireland, Col. Stanley, Ist Regt. Lane’s Militia, brought
Warrant No. 220 to England from Ireland, and thus Lodge
No. 1, England, was formed.
The 2nd Battalion, Manchester Regt., had Warrant No.
1128, which became English.
“The Ancient Britons” was the name of the largest regiment
to cross the Irish Sea, and nearly every man was an Orangeman.
The first lodge in Ireland was named “The Orange Boys.”
It was formed 1794, was perfected September 21, 1795 and became
known as No. 1.

Dear Sir and Brother,
I have carefully perused the Manuscript pf the Early History
° f the Jr° y A al grange Institution in this State, largely compiled by
Bro. W. A. Stewart. He is to be commended for the labour
and research it must have entailed, as he has brought to light
many incidents in its history practically unknown to any member
of our Institution now living.
I think we are fortunate in having such a concise history of
its early days, and when printed it should command a ready
sale amongst those of our members who believe in, and endeavour
to act up to our principles.
Yours fraternally.
SYDNEY RIDGWAY.


Loyal Orange Institution of N.S.W.
(general Qualifications of an ©ranflcnian.
An Orangeman should have a sincere love and veneration for
the Triune God—the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a humble
and steadfast faith in Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankjind,
believing; Him to be God and Man, and the only Mediator
between God and man. He should cultivate truth and justice,
kindness, charity, devotion, piety, concord, unity, and obedience,
to the laws. His deportment should be gentle, compassionate,
kind, and courteous; he should cultivate the society of
the virtuous, and avoid the company of the evil; he should
honour and diligently read the Holy Scriptures, and make
them the rule of his faith and practice; he should love,
uphold, and defend the Protestant Religion, and sincerely desire
and endeavour to propagate its doctrines and precepts; he should
strenuously oppose the fatal errors and doctrines of the Church
of Rome, and scrupulously avoid countenancing (by his presence
or otherwise) any act or ceremony of the Roman Catholic worship.
He should, by all lawful means, resist the ascendancy of that
Church, its encroachments, and the extension of its power; ever
abstaining from all uncharitable words, actions, or sentiments,
towards its adherents. He should remember to keep Holy the
Sabbath Day, attend the public worship of God, and diligently
train up his offspring, and all under his control, in the fear
of God, and in the Protestant Faith. He should never take the
name of God in vain, but abstain from all profane language,
and use every opportunity of discouraging those, and all
other sinful practices, in others. His conduct should be
guided by wisdom and prudence, and marked by honesty,
temperance, and sobriety. The glory of God, the welfare of
man, the honour of his Sovereign, and the good of his country,
should be the motives of his actions.


TWO GREAT PIONEERS.
Bro. ANDREW ALEXANDER
Brought the First Warrant to
Australia, and was W.M. of
the old 50th Reg. Lodge, No.
1780, the first to meet in
Australia.
Bro. R. McGUFFIN
First W.M. of No. 1, Sydney.
The first Lodge to be formed
in Australia.


CHAPTER I.
HOW THE FIRST WARRANT CAME TO SYDNEY.
In the year of grace, 1835, the arrival in Port Jackson of
a ship from England was an event of considerable interest,
and of no little importance to the colonists of New South'Wales.
It meant “news from home” to many who had not yet forgotten
their native land, and those they had left behind. It meant,
most probably, acquisitions to the family wardrobe or the reunion
of friends and the interest in the new arrival was greater still,
when she brought fresh troops to replace those who were waiting
to return Home, and such was the case with the good ship
“Lady Nugent,” which, after a protracted voyage of four
months and five days; dropped anchor in Sydney Harbour on
April 9th, 1835. It is still a long way from Gravesend to Sydney,
but how different the conditions to day, travelling on the
modern liner, to what they were in 1835. The “Lady Nugent”
was a good ship of her class, a sturdy wooden ship of 525 tons
register; but certainly, we would consider her a bit overcrowded
with nearly 400 persons on board, including 9 women and 14
children, the families of 29 soldiers of the 50th Queen’s Own
Regiment, which comprised the military guard; the remainder
of the Regt. was, of course, on other ships employed like the
“Lady Nugent” was. How fresh and beautiful Sydney Harbour
must have looked to those travellers cooped up for so long, how
the women and children must have clapped their hands when
Sydney town hove in sight and they saw the neat white houses
and the bright green fields glistening in the sunlight. And
right glad, too, was Captain Fawcett to hand over his charge
to H.M.’s Officers, who were now stepping on board; and doubt-
less, there were sailors and soldiers aboard who were looking
forward to a jolly time ashore. But we can imagine three
soldiers of the 50th Regt. whispering together as they gathered
their belongings together prior to being marched off to the
Military Barracks. They were men of good character and fine
manly bearing and physique. Their names were Drum-Major
Cadden, Privates Alexander and Thos. Moxham, old comrades,
who had stuck together many a long year, back home in Ireland
and away across the seas in America. Their talk was earnest,
for it related to the custody of The Warrant of the 50th Regi


ments Orange Lodge; which had been sewn in the tunic of
Pte. Alexander by his good wife when the 50th departed for
Australia. The 50th was largely Irish, many of its members
were Orangemen belonging to the Regimental lodge, and they
had decided to secretly retain their lodge Warrant when Sir
Rowland Hill, Commander-in-Chief, had ordered that all military
warrants should be surrendered; they believed that the Order
would sooner or later be countermanded, and so they agreed
to Pte. Alexander, one of their brethren, having charge of it,
MRS. ANDREW ALEXANDER,
Who sewed the Warrant in her husband's Tunic
prior to leaving London, Dec. 4th, 1834.
e levmg that in a new land it might again be put to good use,
and in some way Bros. Moxham and Cadden were also specially
interested in the safety of their precious document. There is
a tradition, that the former had on one occasion volunteered
to swim ashore with the Warrant, which was suspected of being
with Pte. Alexander, a circumstance, if discovered, would have
led to a severe punishment. While we possess no direct evidence
m support of this tradition, it is a very reasonable story, because
Pte. Moxham was greatly concerned and appears to have been
the one particular soldier to whom it would have been transferred
had anything happened to Pte. Alexander.


But that day, when Pte. Bro. Andrew Alexander fell in with
his comrades on the shore of Sydney Cove, and marched away
to barracks, it went with him, secure in his tunic. And that is
how Warrant No. 1780 came to Sydney, and what was done with
it, and what ultimately befell it will be learnt in the subsequent
chapters.
From the records compiled by “Old Chum” we learn that the Military
Barracks occupied a site bounded by George and Barrack Sts. and Clarence
and Margaret Sts., practically the land covered now by Wynyard Square,
named after the O.C. commanding the troops during the 40’s and early 50’s.
The main gate was in George St. The present Square was the parade ground.
There were also gates at the north and south corners on the west side. Near
the latter stood the Crown and Kettle Hotel, much patronised by the soldiers.
On the west side, stood the Crispen Arms Hotel, occupying the sit« of the
Grand Central Hotel of to-day. The proprietor at one period was Thos. Kellet,
who subsequently built the Sir Joseph Banks at Botany. Robt. Patterson was
caterer for the Barracks and kept the Crispen Arms before Kellet.—(Editor.)

(See page 45.)


CHAPTER II.
Fresh drafts of soldiers arriving- on the different transports,
the 50th was distributed at the various military posts in New
South Wales, at Liverpool, Berrima, Windsor and Parramatta.
Mr. W. Freame, the Parramatta Historian, has located the graves
of several soldiers of the 50th, who were buried at Liverpool
and Sutton Forest. They met their deaths at George’s River or at
Berrima. Scattered as the brethren were it was impossible for
them to hold an official lodge, but we know that a number did
meet as opportunity offered, in a room above the printing- office
of Bros. Barr and Kitchen, two old Derry Orangemen, whose
premises were situated next door to the Crown and Kettle Hotel
(on the west corner) King- and York Streets, Sydney, and it
was these gathering's that formed the nucleus of the first Orange
Lodge in Sydney, and it was here that Orangemen from overseas
would meet one another. The 50th Regt. was transferred to
India within three years of its arrival in 1835; but it left some
of its officers and men behind in Sydney, who, like Bro.
Alexander, “bought out” or had reached the expiration of their
service, and elected to remain here. The regiment returned to
Sydney a few years later which account for several of the old
brethren “bobbing up again.”
Bro. W. A. Stewart is careful to point out, that this old
military lodge sitting under its own Warrant, No. 1780, was not
called Sydney No. 1, until 1845; in the meanwhile, the 50th Reg.
Lodge had gradually lost its military exclusiveness, although
a number of the SOth’s soldiers and ex-soldiers retained their
connection with it, a number of civilians were admitted to us
membership. This explains the continuity of the lodge and the
fact that Bro. Andrew Alexander was the first W.M. of a lodge
in Australia, and was also the founder of the Order in this
country. As there has been some doubt raised as to the
correctness of this statement, and as a history requires to be
explicit where essentials are involved, it is necessary to elaborate
a few facts. #
Warrant No. 1780 was the second issued to the 50th Regiment
Lodge, and it was granted to replace the original, which was
lost while the regiment was returning from the West Indies to


England. We have already learnt how it was brought to
Australia with the 50th Queen’s Own Regiment in the transport
“Lady Nugent” by Bro. Andrew Alexander, who had promised
to put it to good use, or return it, and how in fulfilment of the
trust reposed in him he had made use of it in New South Wales
and in Victoria, which for some time was under the authority
of the Grand Lodge of New South Wales.
During the year 1840 the late Bro. Richard McGuffin arrived
in Sydney from Ireland, he was an old Orangeman of a very
active type, and he saw the desirability of forming an Orange
Lodge here, which, while it would maintain the old traditions,
and express the ideals of the Order in Ireland, would be an
Australian lodge. Subsequently, meeting Bro. Alexander at
Rev. Dr. Fullerton’s church in Hay Street, Sydney, Bro. McGuffin
The Printing Office of the first R.W.G.M. in
Australia. Showing also the Crown and
Kettle Hotel.
communicated his proposal to form a lodge to be known as No. 1
Sydney, to him; contending that the 50th Regiment Lodge was
purely an English one, whose members were, or had been,
temporally domiciled here. For practical purposes, this state-
ment was not quite correct, as numbers of Australian residents
had joined it, in place of many of its orignial military members
who had died or left the army, or else had accompanied the regi-
ment upon its departure from this country. Bro. McGuffin was
well acquainted with the local circumstances, he was in business
as a boot and shoe salesman at No. 3 Market Street and was
acquainted with the prominent Orangemen of Sydney, among
whom were several who were not adverse to his proposal.


Bro. McGuffin was unable to put his proposal into effect as
quickly as he thought, but eventually he was able to induce a
number of brethren to join him, “and seven,’’ to quote Bro.
Stewart, “were summoned to attend a meeting for the purpose
of nominating the officers of the new lodge to be constituted
and regularly established in Sydney.
At this meeting the following were declared elected: W.M.,
Richard McGuffin; D.M., Hugh Beard; Secretary, Hugh
McKinley; Treasurer, John Wilson; 1". of C., James Heenan;
2nd and 3rd Committee Men, John McWaters and Robert Patter-
son. After Bro. Patterson’s house, “The Crispen Arms Hotel,”
had been decided upon as the meeting place, question of a
Warrant for the lodge was discussed, and upon Bro. Heenan
showing the legality of Warrant No. 1780, it was decided to ask
Bro. Alexander to join, this he eventually decided to do, with
the result that 39 brethren met at the Crispen Arms on April 13th,
1845, and decided to recognise the new officers, although none
had been members of the 50th Regt. Lodge, who were installed
by Bro. Alexander, who handed the Warrant, Rule Books and
Rituals to them. And thus the first Orange Lodge to be formed
in Australia was duly opened by the aid of Warrant No. 1780,
issued by the Grand Lodge of Ireland.
Subsequently Barr and Kitchen, printers, were instructed to
print several temporary Warrants for use in other lodges pending
the arrival of proper legal Warrants issued by the Grand Lodge
of Ireland. These eventually arrived in Sydney towards the end
of the year 1849.
Concerning these old Warrants, Bro. W, A. Stewart affirms
that No. 4, Sydney, N.S.W., is now the only lodge in Australia
that still retains one of these Irish Warrants.

CHAPTER III
MOSTLY EXPLANATORY.
We have no desire to be tedious, if the gentle reader will
be patient for a little while, we promise him, br her, some
stirring stories soon; but a few facts, not all as dry as the dust
of an out-back road, must be presented at this juncture. With
the arrival of the Irish Warrants, which, by the way, were printed
in 1849, by Wallers, of Dublin, the Warrants printed by Barr
and Kitchen were called in. It was the issue of these documents
that caused so much confusion years ago when a controversy
took place over the question, who gave us our first Warrant? We
know now that the old military lodge met in Sydney prior to the
foundation of No. 1, and we have shown how the latter lodge
was formed, Mr. William Freame, ex-President Parramatta His-
torical Society, told the story how the first Warrant came to
Sydney, in an article in “The Watchman” some years ago; and
in reference to the Warrants printed by Bro. McGuffin, added,
“it would be interesting to know from whence authority was
procured to do so.” This is explained by the fact, that these
were only intended to be temporary. Doubtless there were other
Irish or English lodges represented in the various regiments
stationed in New South Wales and Tasmania, as early as 1821.
This would account for the statement made, that other old War-
rants were in existence in this country, but we have no evidence
of them being used here. John Cadden substantiated the story
of Bro. Alexander bringing Warrant 1780 here. He belonged to a
pioneer Orange family represented by the brothers John, James
and Robert Cadden —the latter was a member of the 50th Regt.
In view of our characteristic forgetfulness, let us honour our
pioneer brethren who, despite many difficulties, built our glorious
Institution upon a sure foundation, and in doing so bequeathed
to us, not only a splendid heritage, but also a sacred truslt. Bro.
Alexander was the first recognised representative of the Irish
Grand Lodge, he was the first W.M. of a lodge in Australia, and
he installed the first officers of the first lodge actually formed
here, established very largely upon the initiative of Bro. R.
McGuffin.

CHAPTER IV
STIRRING TIMES.
It was only in the face of great difficulties, and in spite of
malignant slander and opposition that the Loyal Orange Institu-
tion grew and prospered in this counjtry. Many of the convicts
sent out prior to 1835 were “political offenders,” the majority
of whom were Irish rebels, and a great number „of these, having
secured their freedom, were able and only too willing to make
things as unpleasant as possible for Orange pioneers, being
often aided and abetted by the roughs who could always be
recruited from the low class pubs for which the “Rocks” area
was noted; and it speaks volumes for the forbearance of the
Orange brethren that they avoided coming into conflict with
their enemies and pay them back in their own coin, which they
could easily have done, had they not been restricted by their
regard for law and order. Fortunately, we had even then a
Protestant Press, Bros. Barr and Kitchen, of York Street,
Sydney, Printers, etc., were Orangemen, and both from Derry,
Ireland; it was these two brethren who provided the members
of No. 1780 (the 50th Regt.) with a room to meet in. This firm
published the “Observer” and also “The Sentinel,” 1840-1848.
The “Sentinel” especially was a fearless exponent of Protestant
doctrine and principles; as might be expected of men who both
had served their apprenticeship on “The Derry Sentinel.” Not
only were the Orange brethren maligned in the most shameless
manner, but there were times when their meeting places had
to be protected by military guards. One of the most exciting
episodes took place on Monday, July 13th, 1846. Ihe Orangemen
decided to celebrate the Anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne,
in some cases in their own lodge rooms, but more particularly
by a social gathering at night in “The 1 hree I uns” Hotel, kept
by Bro. Richard Driver, J.P. This hotel was one of the best
conducted in Sydney and stood on the N.W. corner of King and
Elizabeth Streets. As this picturesque house was the first meet-
ing place of the Grand Lodge of New South Wales (including
Victoria) a few particulars concerning its licensee will not be
out of place. The house was owned by Richard Driver, the son
of a wealthy cattle dealer, the former was a native of Sydney,
and was the first Australian born to become an Orangeman, he
was ■ the second W.M. of No. 1 (Sydney), 1848. Born 1803,
married Elizabeth Powell, July Ist, 1823; and died May 12, 1868.


Uis son, Richard Driver (the 2nd) was a solicitor, and became
M.L.A. for Windsor, and was for some time a Minister of the
Crown.
The proposed celebration was advertised in “The Sentinel,”
and was followed by an advertisement in “The Sydney Morn-
ing- Herald,” notifying- A Great Novelty Hurling- Match in Hyde
Park on the same date, July 13th, when a match would take place
between “Clare and Tipperary” and “Cork and Limerick” for
.£IOO a side. N.B.—Any side which withdraws forfeits the
wager. A Purse of 100 Sovs. will be made up from the counties
adjoining the above, who may choose to contest a Hurling

Hotel may be seen of N.W. corner of King Street.
Match at the same time and place. To say the least, it was
a strange coincidence that a Hurling Match should have been
arranged for the very day the Orangemen were to hold their
Celebration, for one cannot play that game without sticks. The
“Sentinel,” commenting upon this, remarked that the scheme
originated in an infamous pot-house on the Rocks, which was
known as a favourite resort of the rebels and riff-raff class. One
of the 1 luilers replied to the “Sentinel’s” scathing denunciation
by making- an absurd, but malicious allegation against the
founder of the first Orange Lodge in Sydney; and concluded by
challenging any six Orangemen to meet him at the Grose Farm
Inn (Camperdown) or any other place, provided with 60 rounds
of ball cartridge. Needless to say, this pot valiant “hero”(?)
was taken no notice of.


CHAPTER V.
THE THREE TUNS AFFAIR.
The 12th of July fell upon a Sunday, and the brethren
attended Divine Service at St. James’ Church, while the Hurlers
practised for Monday’s match in the neighbouring- park. The
Orangemen, it must be added, held no procession, not desiring
to conflict with their enemies. The Hurling Match commenced
at 1 p.m. on Monday, and during the afternoon Rev. Dean
McEncroe arrived on the ground and invited the players to go
to a temperance meeting in St. Patrick’s Hall; but his or Rev.
Dr. Gregory’s request fell on deaf ears. The priests recognised
that the Orangemen w r ere the true objective of the Hurlers’
gathering, and they tried to persuade them to go away peace-
ably. Some of them did so, but the majority went to their
favourite public house on the Rocks. The Orange brethren

assembled early at “The Three Tuns” on Monday evening - ,
but they soon discovered that they were not to be allowed to
mee: in peace, for a crowd of more or less drunken ruffians
hung - around the house, assailing - the inmates with vile languag-e.
Dr. Greg-ory, mounted on a white horse, arrived and mounted
g-uard in front of the lodg-e room door, while Bishop Folding
and Dean McEncroe endeavoured to disuade the mob from inter-
fering - with the Orangemen and although they received very little
respect, they ultimately succeeded. The “Sentinel,” in publish-
ing the account of the affair, said that the Bishop and the two
priests certainly risked their lives at the hands of the mob.
BRO. RICHARD DRIVER,
Grand Secretary, 1848.
It had been stated that another Orange Lodge was meeting at
the Oddfellows’ Hotel, Haymarket, a large portion of the crowd
rushed there; but, as it happened. No. 3, which usually met
there, was celebrating elsewhere. When things quietened down
outside “The Three Tuns,” Dr. Gregory asked leave to enter
the lodge room, and upon his request being granted with pleasure,
he was shown a stand of arms quite ready to meet an emer-
gency, and the danger his deluded -countrymen had escaped,
thanked the brethren for their forebearance. It is only right


to add that the Grand Lodge forwarded a letter of thanks to
the priests who had risked their own lives in resisting the
foolish lawlessness of their own people. Nothing daunted by the
demonstrations in the street, the brethren proceeded with the
social evening.
The, toasts were as follows:—The Queen, JPrince Albert,
King William 111., The Governor and Lady Mary Fitzroy, Col.
Verner, R.W.G.M. of Ireland, The Commodore Watson of
Brownhill, Ireland, Prosperity to the Orange Order of Australia,
and The Protestants of Australia. In response to *4oud calls,
Bro. McGuffin sang “The Boyne Water”-—36 verses; Bros.
Beamer and Lecky also contributed selections. The G.M., Bro.
Barr, having to leave, the W.M. of No. 4 then took the chair,
and the celebrations were continued until a late hour.
NOTES.
Both Bishop Folding and Dr. Gregory were Englishmen.
John Driver's house stood at the West side of Chapel Row, now Castle-
reagh Street near Hunter Street. It was a stately mansion.
On' October 31st, 1803, Mrs. Driver was given a license to sell wines and
spirits, and on February 10th,. 1810, John Driver died. He was the father of
Richard Driver (“Dickie”), the second Grand Secretary of our Institution. Born
March 28, 1803, at Chapel Row; Died May 12, 1868.
The building on the N.W. corner of King and Elizabeth Streets (see
picture) was built about 1823 as a private residence for Mr. G. F. Read, after-
wards it was the offices of J. Norton, solicitor, and about 1833 Richard
Driver opened it as The Three Tuns Tavern, and one of the first lodges met
there for a time, and in it the Grand Lodge was formed.—(Editor.)

CHAPTER VI
THE PROGRESS OF THE ORDER.
Despite much opposition and misrepresentation, the Order
continued to make steady progress. We have already noted the
foundation of No. 1 Lodge, City of Sydney, which became the
District Grand Lodge of Central Cumberland? The Warrant
was worded, similar to that of the old 50th Regt., as follows:
Sydney, April 13, 1845
DISTRICT OF CENTRAL CUMBERLAND
By virtue of this Authority
Our well-beloved Brother Orangeman of the Purple Order,
RICHARD McGUFFIN, and each of his successors, is per-
mitted to hold a lodge, to be known as THE CITY OF SYDNEY
No. 1. and to be held in the District above specified, to consist
of true Orangemen, and to act as Master and perform the
requisites thereof.
ANDREW ALEXANDER,
On behalf of the G.L. of Ireland.
N.B.—To be used only until such times as the proper Warrant
arrives.
The District Grand Lodge was opened 9th May, 1845. All
the officers cannot now be placed, but the following were its
members: Robert Barr, Grand Master; Andrew' Alexander,
D.G. M.; Hugh McKinley, Grand Secretary; and Robert Kitchen,
Richard McGuffin, Hugh Beard, John Wilson, James Heenan,
J. McWaters, Robert Patterson, Thomas Tow'er, William Best,
James Mcllveney, William Nield, John Clark, Hugh Oprey,
James Boyd. Thomas Doneghy, Hugh Watt, Andrew McClure,
Henry McKinley, and the following members of the old 50th
Regt. Lodge: Thomas Moxham, John Cadden, James Cadden,
Robert Cadden, in addition, of course, to Bro. A. Alexander.
Early in 1846, No. 1 Lodge removed to the Rechabite Hall,
Pitt Street, as it had out grown the accommodation at The Cris-
pen Arms. The District Grand Lodge met at The Three Tuns
Hotel; No. 1 Lodge subsequently met at the Lighthouse Hotel,
Bathurst and Sussex Streets, Bro. Gray being the proprietor,
and also at the “Sw r an with Two Necks,” Park and George
Streets.


No. 2 Lodge, Schomberg, was opened in King Street, Sydney,
in 1845, and remained in operation until 1850, when the Gold
Rush having attracted many of its members, it was closed until
September 4th, 1861, when it was re-opened at The Stirling
Castle Hotel, Chippendale. The name of this lodge was changed
to Star of Freedom, but closed again in 1886, and its Warrant
was sent to Bungendore.
Wishing to maintain some chronological order, we will refer
to No. 2 later on, and for the present pass on to No. 3. This
lodge was opened in King Street, Sydney, 1846, and removed
to the Oddfellows’ Arms, Haymarket. Thence to Redfern, and
subsequently to Bro. J. Reilly’s house on the site of the present
Fruit Markets, and later returned to Redfern. In connection
with No. 3, it has been remarked that its Warrant bears the
date 1842, and it is possible that some of its pioneer members
may have met as early as that and as a record the date was noted
on the Warrant, which was renewed, 1861. It did, however, adopt
the name “Derry” years before No. 1 took the same title.
It has been suggested that this old Warrant, dated 1843, originally
belonged to some old regimental lodge represented in Sydney by soldier-
brethren. (See Chapter II.)
No. 4. This lodge opened in 1846, at the King Street
rooms and remained open until 1850, but committee meetings
were held until 1858, thus preserving its continuity. Its origi-
nal provisional Warrant, with those of seven other lodges, was
withdrawn in 1849, the date of the liish Warrant No. 4 still pre-
serves, but redated, 1860, to bring it into conformity with our own
Constitution. This lodge had at one time a membership of nearly
400 and a fine library of Protestant Literature. Bro. S. Withers
was secretary for 26 years, and amongst its members were many-
distinguished colonists, ministers of religion, members of Par-
liament, and Aldermen. Included were Revs. Pastor Allen, who
was driven out of Hyde Park by a howling mob of Roman
Catholics on March 11th, 1878, Dr. Roseby and E. Madgwick.
No. 5 opened at Kiama, March Bth, 1846, was suspended
during the Gold Rush, and re-opened and Warrant renewed May
14, 1861, and named Fermangh True Blues. This Lodge closed
and its Warrant went to Homebush. Since then, however,
another lodge has been formed at Kiama, No. Surrender, No. 12.
No. 6 opened at Tarban Creek (Gladesville), 1847, suspended
during the gold digging days, but its Warrant was renewed,
1861, Bro. Samuel Jordan being W.M.
During 1847 No. 7 was started at North Shore, suspended,
1850, and re-opened November 14th, 1865, and carried on for


some years, when its Warrant went to No. 78, until No. 7 re-
opened at Redfern, and is now located at Chalmers Church
School Hall. The foundation members of old No. 7 were: Bros.
James Montgomery, W.M.; Colin Munro, D.M.; John Rugley,
Secretary; J. Crawford, Treasurer; Jas. Jones, F.C.; J. Humph-
ries; Chas. Hudson, J. Butler, D. Lee, P. Simpson, S. Leake,
J. Ledingham and Alex. Lindon. The Warrant was renewed
again, 14th .November, 1865. It is interesting to note that the
present W.M. of No. 7, Harmony, Bro. K. R. Montgomery,
is a great grandson of the first W.M. of old No. 7.
No. 8, Parramatta, opened early, 1847, Bro. Thos. Stewart,
its chief founder, was the first W.M. In 1884 thisjodge had over
50 members, the W.M. being Bro. W. F. Schey; D.M. Bro. T.
Howison; Chaplain, Bro. Rev. G. Mclntosh; Secretary, Bro, G.
Watts. In addition, there was also No. 68, “Argyle,” of which
Bro. J. Saunders was W.M.

CHAPTER VII.
THE “SENTINEL” NEWSPAPER.
Without disturbing- the continuity of events, let us turn to
the pages of “The Sentinel” Newspaper, published by Barr
and Kitchen. It took a lot of pluck to run a straight-out Pro-
testant paper during the times under review, but Bros. Barr and
Kitchen possessed that quality. Their paper was the first to
insert notices of Orange Lodges and to fearlessly champion
their cause. Lodge notices and advertisements of lodges Nos. 2,
3, and 4. appear in the issues of 1846 to 1848, also a report of
lodges opening- at Gladesville, Kiama, and Parramatta, also
opening of a lodge at Windsor, 15th April, 1847; also notifica-
tion of the new Arch Purple Lodge and calling a meeting of
same, 6th January, 1848. A report of the 12th July Celebrations
for the same year also appeared in its columns. Reported also
that a lodge had been opened in Hobart Town, Tasmania; under
Warrant from the G.L. of New South Wales, during July, 1848,
notwithstanding a great outcry from certain people, who, while
they did not mind Oddfellows, or even Freemasons, protested
against bringing a fire-brand into a peaceable country. “The
Sentinel” remarked, if these people had shown a peaceable spirit
which they boasted of possessing, an Orange lodge would not
be necessary for another ten years. Our brethren respected the
Party Procession Act of 1843, which could not be said of the
Hibernian processions when the law was flouted with impunity.
We learn, too, that the 12th was celebrated successfully at the
Commercial Inn, Collins Street, Melbourne, the following year,
1847, and that the cause was gaining strength throughout the
Port Phillip district, and that another lodge was opened at
Geelong (1847). Other copies of “The Sentinel” inform us
that a Protestant Hall was erected in Melbourne in 1848, and
also reprints from “The Chronicle” of March 25th, 1845, a
letter written in opposition to Orange Lodges, and expressing
regret that such should be in Sydney, “with any countenanace
amongst our fellow citizens, as it is well-known that the sole
aim of their establishment is to stir up strife, and to call
into existence the very worst feelings of our nature, even
to the endangerment of the peace and welfare of society.” “The
Sentinel” with remarkable courage, replied to the diatribe in
good round terms, remarking, inter alia, that “the designs of
the Jesuits had a directly contrary effect of producing the organi-
sation of not only two, but four Orange Lodges in Sydney, and
two in Maitland, whose aggregate members were not less than
700, who had associated themselves with their brethren through-
out New South Wales.

CHAPTER VIII.
A LADY’S REMINSCENCES.
Miss Reilly, who is still living-, relates many recollections
of old No. 3, and incidentally of Sydney during- the fifties. No.
3 met for a while in the Oddfellows’ Hotel in George Street,
near Hay Street. This old inn is still there, although the
front has been modernised. The lodge removed from Dishing-
ton’s, tne Oddfellows, to Redfern, and subsequently to the house
of Bro. James Reilly (1853) about 100 yards north of the present
Orchard’s Corner. This quarter was one of the most pictur-
esque in Sydney from the fifties down to the eighties. Many of
us still remember Hancock’s Tower, the little row of shops
several feet below the footpath, Fitzg-crald’s Corner, the old
Round House, and the Benevolent Asylum, erected by Governor
Macquarie, 1820. It was in this classic quarter that No. 3 found
an anchorag-e when the waters of Darling- Harbour, Cockle Bay,
nearly reached Bro. Reilly’s backyard, when nothing separated
it from Ultimo House but a great paddock. Miss Reilly remem-
bers the happy gatherings which took place in connection with
No. 3, when refreshments and harmony enhanced the pleasure
of the meetings in those good old days. The Reilly’s, like most
of their neighbours about Ultimo and Pyrmont, kept a small
herd of goats, and the girls used to tell candidates for the
various degrees that a trial spin on these animals were neces-
sary before they went up to the lodge, otherwise they would have
a rough time. The old lodge chest of solid cedar was kept in
Miss Reilly’s room. Bro. VV. A. Stewart, in his collected data,
tells us of the handsome chair made in 1846 for the use of
the R.W.G.M. when visiting lodges. This fine historical
relic is in good order, thanks to the members of No. 3. During'
1860, Miss Reilly states, the chair was sent to be upholstered. The
tradesman who undertook the job was a Forester, and he re-
covered it in green leather to the disgust of the members, who
quickly had the colour altered. Miss Reilly, by invitation,
visited No. 3 comparatively recently, and the brethren induced
her to sit in the old chair. But the good lady -was moved to
tears when the VV.M., Bro. Miller, held up the Warrant, with
her father’s signature as Deputy Grand Master; she was able.


too, to examine the old cedar chest that had been the com-
panion of her girlhood days when she used to help prepare the
refreshments for the lodge gatherings.
Such reminscences as these of Miss Reilly stimulate us,
who have followed long after, to a renewed admiration of those
worthy Orange pioneers who “fought a good fight” in their
battle for religious and civic freedom.


CHAPTER IX.
THE GOLD FIELD DAYS.
The discovery of gdd in New South Wales and in Victoria
marks the most exciting times in the history of Australia. William
1* reame, himself the first-born of gold digging parents, and
the eldest nephew of one of the first discoverers of gold in
Bendigo, who was a goldfield acquaintance of Bro. A. Alexander;
he writes as follows: —“I he gold rush days were the days of
expectancy, excitement, and of high adventure, that not only
drew the tradesmen of Sydney and Melbourne from their work-
shops, and the sailors from their ships, but fired the quite
stolid labourers of the green lanes of England with a mad
desire to get to the Sunny South at all hazards, and as quick
as possible. When the rush to the Turon, N.S.W., set in, the
W estern Road from Parramatta to the Blue Mountains was
crowded with people, many in vehicles, many more on foot—as
Paddy would say, “Some in chaises and other poor devils walk-
ing like blazes”—and others wheeling barrows or hand-carts,
but all making for the one objective—The El Dorado of the
West.” “Exciting as the Turon River rush was, it was not
to be compared with that from Melbourne to Bendigo. Men
threw down their tools on the buildings on which they were
employed, and at one time a whole fleet of ships lay deserted
in Hobson’s Bay, their crews having rushed off to the diggings.”
Among the better class of adventurous spirits who were
attracted to Bendigo were Bro and Mrs. Andrew Alexander,
who were destined to play an important part in one of the most
-exciting and momentous episodes of the old golden days of
Bendigo. During the period under review, it is estimated that
over 100,000 persons arrived in Victoria, all more or less
attracted by the goldfields; while many, of course, were of good
character, including many Orangemen from the Sydney lodges,
it cannot be denied that many were quite the opposite, wild,
lawless men from California, and time expired transportees from
Van Dieman’s Land (“Vandiemonions,” the Victorians called
them); many of whom were Irish rebels, always too pleased
to be “agin the Government,” and to attack Protestantism and
Loyalty to the English throne. This section constituted the
rowdy rabble on the Bendigo diggings and were responsible for
a disgraceful attack upon the Orangemen at Eaglehawk, on
July 11 fh. 1853, which might have ended badly for the latter


but for the initiative and courage of Bro. Alexander, who,
although essentially a man of peace, could fight when he found
necessity demanded it.
Among the Orangemen at Bendigo and Fryer’s Creek—
now known as Castlemaine, were many who knew Bro. Alexander
personally or by reputation, and these brethren would get to-
gether and discuss their old lodges, and as the numbers increased
efforts were initiated to found a lodge; the co-operation of Bro.
Alexander was secured, and as Grand Master, he opened a
local lodge called the Royal Ulsters, early in 1853, using the
same warrant as No. 1, Sydney, and it is worth recording that
Bro. Alexander’s second son. William, joined the Royal Ulster's
Lodge, 1854, being then 17 years of age. Born in the old
Military Barracks, Wynyard Square, Sydney, 14th November,
1837, and remaining up to his death a member of No. 1, Sydney.
William Alexander was a notable pioneer Orangeman and also a
distinguished Red Cross Member of No. 146, R.B.P. Ihe
Alexander’s, during the year 1853, were residing in tents
which, with their contents, were destroyed by fire, includ-
ing the old historical Warrant, No. 1780. which had done
such signal service in the foundation of thie Loyal Orange
Institution in Australia. As this document leaves us, it
is opportune to mention other old Warrants in Australia
which have given rise to controversy. There were other military
Warrants besides 1780, but we have no record of them having
been used here, and it is only reasonable to assume that they
departed with their regiments. Bro. Stewart vouches for one
dated September 15th, 1828, No. 925, but there is no record of
it having been used here; and lodge No. 3 had a minute book
dated 1829, unfortunately it was lost, but we find no evidence
to sustain the assumption that this lodge was in existence here
as early as that. Several L.O.L. and R.B.P. clearances of dates
1800 and 1815 are still in existence, but they are not Australian.
Then we have the old Warrant presented to the Grand Lodge
of New South Wales by Bro. G. M. Moxham, and which has
also been referred to as the first Warrant brought to this
country by Pte. Moxham, of the 50th Regt., a progenitor of
the late Bro. T. R. Moxham, M.L.A. This Warrant, No. 925,
is known as “an Ernest W'arrant,” having been signed by H.R.H.
Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, afterwards King of
Hanover. He was Imperial G.M, of the Orange Institution, 1827,
and the Warrant was signed 15th September, 1828, with one-
word. “Ernest,” and it went to Co. Longford, Ireland, 1832.
Bro. G. M. Moxham’s father, the late Henry Moxham, with
members of his family, arrived in Australia from Ireland, 1849.
Being previously a Justice of the Peace for the County of
Longford, Bro. Moxham had to punish many lawless people, who-


entertained a great grudge against his family. Bro. G. M.
Moxham, well over 90 years of age, writing 2oth June, 1924,
states, inter alia, that the old Warrant he gave the Grand
Lodge was originally owned by Bro. A. Alexander, and he and
the late Henry Moxham opened a lodge with it at Tarban
Creek —now called Gladesville. This Warrant passed into the
possession of Henry Moxham, and from him to G. M. Moxham,
who ultimately gave it to Bro. R. E. Barton, then Grand Master,
ST. MARY’S CHURCH OF ENGLAND, SOUTH CREEK.
In the Churchyard are buried many pioneer Orangemen.
for presentation to the Grand Lodge. This statement somewhat
perplexes us, but the fact remains, that Warrant No. 925, histori-
cal as it undoubtedly is, was not the Warrant No. 1780 which
Bro. Alexander brought here in 1835, and with which he opened
the first lodge in Australia. We know the Moxham’s were a
large family, many of whom were pioneers of Orangeism in Ire-
land, and Pte Thos. Moxham —who, with Bros. John Cadden,


Jas. Cadden, Robt. Cadden, and Bro. Alexander, was a member
of the 50. h Regt. Lodge—appears to have been a member of this
clan. It has been suggested that Warrant No. 925 was an old
military Warrant belonging originally to Pte. Thos. Moxham,
who, so tradition says, swam ashore with it, but we cannot find
any evidence to support this, and, unfortunately, cannot learn
where this brother died. Henry Moxham,' who with his four
sons, arrived here in 1849, was the grandfather of Bro. Thos.
R. Moxham, M.L.A., we are informed by some of his grand-
sons that he is buried in St. Mary’s Churchyard, South Creek.


CHAPTER X.
THE EAGLEHAWK RIOTS—BRO. ALEXANDER TO THE
RESCUE.
The 11th of July, 1853, saw an event that caused consider-
able excitement at the time, but remains one of the most notable
episodes in the history of Orangeism in Australia. Fortunately,
the facts have easily been subtsantiated, not only by newspaper
reports, but from the reminiscences of many who were either
present themselves, or were in the neighbourhood and received
their information first-hand.
The Bendigo Orangemen and their friends decided to
celebrate the 12th by a ball and supper in the Catherine Reef
Hotel. The news spread rapidly over the goldfield and many
received it gladly and made provision to attend —no small thing
with flour at ,£lOO a ton, or 2/6 a lb., but to many, a digger’s life
was a monotonous one, enlivened only by camp fire yarns, or
card playing; and consequently, the grand Protestant Ball and
Supper was something to talk about. But many of the Roman
Catholic diggers and “hangers on” determined to stop the
celebration, and threatened to kill anyone they found wearing
an Orange emblem, and pick handles and other weapons of
offense and defence were quickly obtained,
Mr. Freame, in his volume of Press Contributions, in the
Mitchell Library, Sydney, presents some interesting facts re
this event, which he himself received from members of the
Alexander family, and from close relatives of his own, who were
among the first to find gold on Bendigo. Bro. Alexander, as
an old soldier, was prepared for any emergency, gathering about
300 brethren, stout of heart and strong of hand. The other
side soon found they were not going to have things all their
own way. Several skirmishes occurred “at outposts,” and shots
were fired. Mr. McLaughlin, J.P., fearing that the row would
end in bloodshed went, accompanied by two troopers, to the
Catherine Reef Hotel and demanded that British patriotic flags
should be removed from the stairways, and on pain of having
his license cancelled, the landlord should forbid the ball being
held in his house. Bro. Alexander, like a true Orangeman, did
not desire to injure anyone if the rights of the cause he
espoused could possibly be maintained otherwise. He flatly
refused to remove the British flag, and sternly threatened to


shoot the first man who dared to attempt to remove the Union
Jack, which was placed in a conspicuous position. The sight of
the old veteran standing, gun in hand, overawed the mob, and
Mr. McLaughlin agreed to the flags remaining and Bro. Alex-
ander agreed to the Ball being held elsewhere. Night came;
and with it crowds to view the arrival of the fair sex about to
grace the ballroom of The Camp Hotel. Orangemen and their
friends rolled up in great numbers, and as it was plainly seen
that they were bent on having their social without interfering
with others or allowing others to interfere with them, nothing
occurred beyond a few jeers and jibes from those who kept a
respectable distance away. The entrance to the ballroom was
crowded, and the arrival of the ladies and their ascorts created
much interest. “Isn’t she a beauty?” “My word, there’s a girl
for you,” were some of the good natured remarks made by the
young men. After the ball the brethren returned to the Cathe-
rine Reef Hotel, where ample justice was given to a good supper,
enlivened by vocal and instrumental contributions; an enjoyable
time ending in the wee small hours of the morning of the 12th.
It must be added, as a testimony to the courage and loyalty
of Mrs. Alexander, that when the row threatened to be serious,
two messengers rode away to tell Mrs. Alexander and her friends
not to come into the town to the ball. Meeting her on tlie road,
the men told her of the firing and advised her to turn back.
I his she stoutly refused to do; adding, “if there was any shoot-
ing, she would be there to help her husband.”
The Alexander’s returned to Sydney during 1860, when the
Royal Ulster’s Lodge, Eaglehawk, through the R.W.G.M. in
Sydney, presented Bro. Alexander with a gold medal and
ribbons as an expression of its appreciation of the services
rendered by him to the lodge.


CHAPTER XI.
The experience that befell the W.M. and several of the
brethren of No. 6, Tarban Creek (Gladesville), N.S.W., shows
to what absurd lengths bigotry will lead men, who ought to
know better. On the 12th July, 1868, Tarban'Creek Lodge
decided to go on horse-back to Pennant Hills Church, to thank
God publicly for the preservation of our religious rights and
liberties. On the journey the Holy Bible and the Warrant of
the lodge were carried at the head of the procession; and surely
there was nothing offensive in either the Word of God, and the
Charter of a local Orange lodge, but two gentlemen, Messrs.
Forster and Jabez K. Heydon, took strong objection to this,
especially the later, who said that the procession was very offen-
sive to his Irish coachman, and for that reason it should not
be allowed. One might here wonder if in other matters the
objections of his “Irish coachman” received such prompt
sympathy from the late J. K. Heydon, Esq. As a result of
these protests 18 brethren were summoned to appear at the Ryde
Police Court before Messrs. Blaxland, Shepperd, and Devlin,
Justices of the Peace; the following defendants having answered
their names and entered a plea of not guilty; Jas. Hannan, W.
Bishop, Hy. Garrett, W. Tunks, Ed. and Geo. Trivett, Geo.
Simpson, Geo. Wilson, Alonzo Grocott, Hy. Golding, W. Little,
J as. Gordon, Thos. Folkhard, Rd. Carrol, Senr., R. Carrol, Jnr.,
Wm. Smith, Hy Johnson, and W. Jackson. The late Mr.
Windeyer appeared to defend. Police Constables Samuel and
Carpenter deposed that they saw nothing in the procession to
cause a breach of the peace. J. K. Heydon personally did not
mind a procession, but it was so offensive to his Irish coachman
that he considered it should be disallowed. He identified
Grocott by his red whiskers (evidently they were not green.—Ed.)
and concluded by saying that the Orangemen should not crow
over a dead cock. Another witness swore that he saw one of
the defendants carrying a picture, but could not say what it
was. Another witness said that “the picture” was carried with
the glass turned towards the person carrying it. Mr. Windeyer
in a spirited defence, contended that any event could only be
celebrated on its anniversary. The defendants could not properly
celebrate the Battle of the Boyne on the 12th, as it occurred on


the Ist July, and it was this commemoration of an historic
event that was supposed to be offensive to a certain section of
the community. He argued that among- the witnesses for the
prosecution there was a great deal of difference, so much so
they were unable to enlighten the Court as to what really
occurred. The case was dismissed,* but whether the “Irish
coachman” was, deponeth sayeth not. While we can plead some
excuse for bigotry and hatred among ignorant and mentally
unbalanced persons, it does appear remarkable that intellectual
people should allow these influences to affect them. About the
time of the Tarban Creek Case there dwelt in a neighbouring
suburb a District Court Judge who was an Irish Roman Catholic;
who, notwithstanding the comfortable exclusion of his home,
took an objection to the singing in a Methodist Chapel opposite
his house, with the result that he bought it lock, stock and
barrel, and closed it up, where it remained until recently, a
melancholy reminder of a “learned” judge’s hatred of Protestant
worship. When we recall such incidents as these, might we
not ask what would become of our Protestant Church Service,
to say nothing of the Salvation Army meetings, if the Roman
Catholic Church obtained the mastery in thi£ country.
•Records Police Court, Ryde, August Ist, 1868.


CHAPTER XII.
IN THE SIXTIES.
The Grand Lodge Minutes of March 21st, 1861, show that
arrangements were being- made with the Earl of Enniskillen,
G.M. of Ireland, to obtain a Warrant and also hecessary books
for the Grand Lodg-e in Sydney, but permission was granted for it
to continue under its own Constitution. The Grand Lodg-e here
dissolved on November 2nd, 1864, and a new Grand Lodg-e was
formed from among- officers of Subordinate Lodges.
Following-, as close as possible the sequence of events, we
find a great revival in the Orange lodges, due to the return of
many members from the dig-g-ing-s, and the attempted assassina-
tion of H.R.H. Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinboroug-h, early in
1868, at Clontarf. The attempt by O’Farrell, upon the life of
Prince Alfred, led to the formation of the Duke of Edinboroug-h
Hig-hlanders, the Colour Sergt., Bro. McLeod, being- a member
of No. 7; and their uniforms were similar to those of the famous
Black Watch. When the news spread that the life of the Duke
had been attempted the excitement was intense and the Orange
lodges filled to overflowing. The late Bro. McGuffin stated that
30,000 rallied to the banner in a few months. No doubt the
Protestant spirit was aroused, as it since has been, when
menaced by Roman Catholic aggression. The Grand Lodge
had been reformed, 1864, and met at the Lighthouse Hotel,
corner of Bathurst and Sussex Streets, 1566-7; then removed
to No. 1 Park Street, 1870, thence to 352 Castlereagh
Street, 1871 to 1874, thence to Liverpool Street, and from
there to the Protestant Hall. There appears to have been
an independent Orange Society in Sydney at this time,
known as “The Loyal and Patriotic Order of the Knights of
Manchester, Commandency of William III.” The moving
spirits in this institution were J. W. Smith and G. McDonald.
It appears from such scant evidence that we can obtain that
the object of this institution was to preserve the traditions of
the first Orange Society formed, 1727, by the officers of The
William 111. 4th Regt. of Infantry. (The late Bro. J. Wheeler,
P.R.W.G.M., claimed that the Orange Order was founded in
England.)


The old No. 2, called “Schomberg,” was re-opened in 1861,
and re-named “Star of Freedom,” and after a sojourn at Redfern,
re-opened at Camperdown, and this lodge has been one of the
most influential in the State, having among its members some
of the most prominent men of Sydney, and is still in a healthy
condition. The meetings held in the old Town Hall, Camper-
down, when Bro. G. H. Sparkes was Mayor, were indeed an
inspiration. Their Warrant bore the dates 1845 and 1861, Bro.
James McCoy being R.W.G.M., and Bro. Thos. Webb, W.M.,
during 1861.
No. 3 also received a great impetus during the sixties.
Many old No. 2 members joined during the time their lodge
was closed, and it is on record that nearly 700 persons attended
a supper given by No. 3 in the Chippendale School Room, July,
1868.
No. 4 continued to progress and was considered to be the
best equipped in Sydney, and many men of mark considered it a
privilege to be among its members, with a roll call of 300,
and visitors always present, it was very hard to obtain a seat
on the top floor of the Protestant Hall where they met; previous
to which, it met at the Oddfellows’ Hotel, and afterwards at
the Tower Inn, opposite the present railway station; and during
the early 70’s at Dr. Fullerton’s school hall in Hay Street. No.
4 was named “No Surrender” on sth April, 1869.
During 1867 No. 6 elected the following officers: Bros. S.
Jordan, W.M.; Bro. S. Long, D.M.; Bro. J. Irvine, Secretary;
Bro. W. Little, Treasurer; Bro. H. Golding, F.C.; and Bro. Rev.
W. Wood, Chaplain.
Before passing on, a few words respecting that sturdy old
Sydney Orangemen, the late Bro. G. H. Sparkes, will not be
out of place. Originally a member of the Royal Irish Constabu-
lary, he joined the 18th Royal Irish, with which he saw service
in the Maori War. Leaving the Army he came to Sydney, and
soon after settled down in Camperdown, where for many years
he was a prominent resident—an alderman, Mayor, and Justice
of the Peace. This old No. 2 had among its members many
notable old Orangemen, including Bros. Sanbrook, Mitchell,
Morgan, Tilson, Elliot, S. King, and W. Hamblin, and David
Gilpin, ex-Lord Mayor of Sydney.


CHAPTER XIII.
IN THE SEVENTIES.
In 1870 a lodge was opened in Liverpool, which quickly
numbered 80 members, and about this time Bismarck Lodge,
Penrith, No. 73 (opened 1862) experienced quite a revival; in-
deed, much interest was re-awakened throughout Central
Cumberland, which has given many splendid workers to the
Institution; brethren who have held positions of trust and honour
in the public life of the community. In this connection we
recall the time honoured names of Bros. T. R. Moxham,
M.L.A. (deceased), J. C. Hunt, ex-M.L.A., for years a member of
Jordan; Bros. Worboys, Folkhard, Munro, and Mitchell.
Bro. Thomas Walker, of North Auburn, remains with us to-day,
a connecting link with the old time—a P.W.M., R.B.P. No. 412,
P.W.M. No. 248, L.0.L., for years a member of the Grand
Lodge of New South Wales, and he has taken part in many
a hard fought battle.
As a record of the activities of the brethren, we might add
in passing, that during the seventies, and also in the eighties,
saw lodges working in Windsor, the “Royal Windsor,” in Rich-
mond, “Lodge Richmond,” during which period a lodge was
working in Ryde, No 24. Lodge No. 104, Granville, was found-
ed, 1881, and about the same time, there was a second lodge
formed at Parramatta, called “Argyle,” No. 68; also a District
Lodge of Central Cumberland. The D.G.M. in 1883 being Bro.
R. A. Mitchell, and the Secretary, Bro. W. F. Schey. A Precep-
tory of the Royal Black Knights of Malta was also in Parramatta
at this time.
The “Protestant Standard” of July 1871 records that on
the 12th inst., at the Exhibition Building, Sydney. Bro. A.
Alexander was presented with an illuminated address and a
purse of 125 sovereigns as an appreciation of the valuable ser-
vices he had rendered to the Loyal Orange Institution. The
presentation was made by the R.W.G.M., Bro. Stephen Goold,
and inter alia, the report mentions that reference was made to
Bro. Alexander having established the first Orange Lodge here
31 years previously, viz., 1841. The following is a copy of the
Address:—


“To Brother ANDREW ALEXANDER, Esq.
One of the Founders of the Loyal Orange Institution
New South Wales.
Dear Sir and Brother,
We, the Grand Master and Committee, on behalf of the
various officers and members of the Loyal Orange Institution,
consider that we should be wanting in gratitude and neglectful
of a duty towards yourself, were we not to furnish you with
some tangible evidence of our appreciation of the long and
valuable services you have rendered to our noble cause.
At the risk of being slandered, if not exposing yourself to
personal danger, you took a bold stand and leading part in
establishing the Orange Institution in this country thirty years
ago. You watched over and nursed it in the days of its infancy
and feebleness, filling with credit to its members, and honour
to yourself, all the offices to which you have been elected, and
holding for many years the high and responsible position of the
Most Worshipful Grand Master. We assure you, Dear Sir and
Brother, that it is with feelings of pleasure we review your con-
sistent conduct and your untiring efforts to promote the prosperity
of our Great Institution. It is our privilege to see that your
self-denying labours have been crowned with enormous success.
When we consider the objects at which the Institution aims,
inculcating as it does, obedience to the laws, the maintenance of
the Scriptural Doctrines of our Glorious Protestantism, the
Defence of the British Throne, and our Illustrious Ruler, being
Protestant, we honour you for having brought to our shores
the Warrant by which the first Lodge was opened.
Though far advanced in the journey of life, we trust that
through the Divine Mercy you may long be spared to favour us
with your presence and counsel.
As a slight memento of our veneration and regard for your
character and long services, we beg your acceptance of the
accompanying purse, containing One Hundred and 1 wenty-five
Sovereigns.
We are, Dear Sir and Brother,
Yours in Fraternal Concord,

MOSTLY BIOGRAPHICAL.
The late Bro. Andrew Alexander, who may be called “the
Founder of the Loyal Orange Institution in Australia,” came
from a pioneer Orange family in Ireland. He was born in the
Parish of Glendermot, County Derry, Ireland, on July 12th, 1799.
Reared in a good old Protestant atmosphere, it may be said of
him, “that he was born to be an Orangeman.” As a young man
he joined the British Army and he came to Sydney as one of
the 50th Queen’s Own Regt.—“The blind half hundred.” When
the regiment was ordered to India, he bought out, after eighteen
years service, and for a time followed his trade, that of a tailor,
in Sydney. He went to the Victorian goldfields, where, at
Bendigo and at Melbourne, he rendered great service to the
Orange cause. He was the first W.M. at the former place. He
also opened a lodge at Melbourne, travelling to and from Bendigo
on foot to do so. A man ot great courage and physique, a life-
lone abstainer from all intoxicants, he was an outstanding figure
in all that appertained to the moral uplift of humanity and the
preservation of religious and civic liberties. Returning to
Sydney, he entered the service of Messrs. Holdsworth and
Gardine', with whom he remained for 30 years, being eventually
pensioned off by the firm. His family numbered close on 100—
children, grand children, and great grand children. He died,
17th October, 1893, and his funeral to Rookwood Cemetery was
attended by a great concourse of people, among whom were
Hons. J. C. Neild, M.L.A., R.W.G.M ; John Davies, M.L.C.;
R. Jones, M.L.A.; and (Major) A. J. S. Gilchrist; G. Secretary,
Thos. Jessep, P.R.W.G.M.; H. Manuel; G. Treasurer, W.
McDonnell; G.F.C., A. Walker; P.D.G.M., Rev. Bro. J. W.
Bamber; G. Chaplain, South Australia, Rev Bro. E. D. Madg-
wick; G. Chaplain, N.S.W., Rev. Bro. W. Dill Macky; Revs. T. J.
Curtis, S. Sackville West, and Dr. Gilchrist; and officers and
members of R.8.A., and P.A.F.S. The funeral services were
conducted at the house by Rev. Bro. W. M. Dill Macky, and at
the graveside by Rev. Bro. E. D. Madgwick.
The late Bro. Richard McGufiin was a notable Orange pioneer
of Sydney. He was originally one of the Yeomanry and left
Ireland with his family in 1840, and arrived in Sydney, after a
protracted voyage of six months. He, like Bro. A. Alexander,
possessed great courage, and was a man of fine physique; a
determined Orangeman, with considerable initiative and resource.
He played an important part in the history of Orangeism in this
country. His share in the foundation of the first Sydney lodge
is shown in this volume and need not be repeated. Like Bro.
Alexander, his services to the cause were recognised by the G.
Lodge of N.S.W., who, in his declining years, allowed him a
pension. Born in Newny, Ireland, 1795; died, N.S.W., October
sth, 1878.


Notwithstanding- the hard things said about Orangemen by
“our friends, the enemy,” our prominent officers have always
stood well in the eyes of the public. The brethren who have
filled the chair of R.W.G.M. have proved their outstanding ability;
some of them have filled important positions in the public life
of the State of New South Wales. P.R.W.G.M., the late Bro.
Thos. Jessep, and P.R.W.G.M., W. Stephen, both were mem-
bers of our State Parliament. P.R.W.G.M., the late Bro. Hon.
Senator J. C. Neild, was for many years an outstanding figure
in State and Federal politics. Bro. John Wheeler, another Grand
Master who has passed over, was for many years admittedly the
leader of municipal politics. As Chairman for years of the
Local Government Conference, he was the official mouthpiece of
the combined municipalities. Bro. James Robinson, another
Grand Master, was a member of the N.S.W. Legislative Council.
Many of the finest clergymen who have adorned the Protestant
pulpit in this country have not been ashamed to wear our regalia.
Revs. Canon Mclntosh, E. D. Madgwick, P.R.W.G.M.; T. J.
Curtis, John Murray, Alex. Robertson, and that great and good
man. Dr. W. M. Dill Macky, are but a few. of the Protestant
Ministers of Religion who have held office in our Order
Among other members who attained high positions may be
mentioned Bros. H. M. Lee, for several years M.H.R.; Bro.
Booth, M.L.A.; J. Fallick, M.L.A.; Hon. R. B. Orchard, and
among present politicians, Hon. E. K. Bowden. ex-Minister for
Defence.
Bro. Thos. Walker, Snr., No. 248, remembers many of the
“giants of old,” and recalls with pride having been associated
with many of them in days long since passed away. Initiated
into No. 4, “No Surrender,” 1878, and receiving the R.A.P.
Degree in the same lodge, Bro. Walker recalls the splendid
meetings held during the four years he was a member of No. 4.
The late Bro. John Roseby, M.L.A., was W.M., and Pastor Allen,
Chaplain; Canon D. Berry, Messrs. John Davies, M.L.A., and
N. Melville, M.L.A., were frequent visitors. Once a month No.
4 held a harbour excursion, their steamer flying the Union Jack
or a flag bearing in large letters the name of the lodge. Aftei
joining No. 349, R.8.P., Bro. Walker removed to Newcastle,
being a gunnen in the artillery, and linked up with No. 26,
L. and No. 394, R.8.P., and held office in the District
Lodge. He still remembers the good work done by Bro. Chap-
man, the “Protestant Champion at Maitland,” Bros. Joseph
Greer, M.L.A., W. Graham (Senr.), M.L.A., James Fletcher,
M. and Ninian Melville, M.L.A. Since residing in the
Auburn District, Bro. Walker has been W.M. of No. 248, L.0.L.,
and No. 412, R.8.P., and with Bros. J. Nicholls and J. G. Chap-
man represented No. 4 District in the Grand Lodge.

The late Bro. John Wheeler, p.r.w.g.m.
The late Bro. John Wheeler, J.P., was for many years a
very notable personality among- Orangfemen. He was born in
Sydney, December 18th, 1853, and joined the L.O.L. in 1870, being-
initiated into No. 1, L.0.L., by the late Bro. S. S. Goold,
R.W.G.M. During- December, 1870, he helped to found No. 46,
at Petersham, wdth which lodg-e he remained a member, being-
for many years its W.M. He entered the Grand Lodg-e 1872,
and in 1883 and 1884 was elected Foreman of Grand Committees;
in 1885 was advanced to the chair of the D.G.M., and the follow-
ing- year was elected R.W.G.M. In Aug-u'st, 1894, he was ag-ain
elected to that exalted position, which he retained until 1909,


and following Bro. W. E. Cullam as Grand Master in 1912,
he thus established a record as R.W.G.M. of N.S.W. Dur-
ing the whole time he occupied that position, he displayed such
wise, calm, and firm judgment in the duties of administration,
that he merited the esteem and approbation of all with whom he
came in contact and the Institution was materially strengthened
and its objects advanced.
He also took a prominent part in Friendly Society work, and
from 1885 to 1894 held the position of Wor. Grand Master of the
Protestant Alliance Friendly Society.
He also served the Order with distinction as Most Worshipful
Grand President of the Loyal Orange Grand Council of Austra-
lasia. Bro. Wheeler passed away in April, 1925.
The Late Bro. Thomas Jessep, j.p.
The late Bro. Jessep was born in Norfolk, England, on
Ist November, 1848. He left England' in 1854 and arrived at
Hobart, Tasmania, an orphan, his father dying on the voyage,
and was buried at sea. At the age of 13 he was apprenticed to
Mr. Alexander Graham, the founder of Municipal Government in
Tasmania, to whose example and influence Bro. Jessep was
largely indebted for his success in life. In 1866 he went to
Ballarat and went in for mining, but met with little success.
He arrived in Sydney in August, 1869, and became engaged in the
fruit industry, and was the Chairman of Directors of the N.S.W.
Fruit Exchange. He was a member of Parliament for N.S.W.;
Alderman for Waverley, and six years an Alderman of the City
of Sydney; and for 28 years Superintendent of the Waverley
Methodist Sunday School.
Bro. Jessep joined the Orange Institution early in 1870, and
was Secretary of No. 66, L.0.L., when it was opened in 1871.
From that date he was always in active service for the Institution,
and, in addition to Subordinate Lodge Offices, has filled the
position of G. Treasurer, G. Secretary, D.G. Master, and R.W.G.
Master, in 1889 and 1915. For the two years (1911-1912) he
again held the responsible position of G. Secretary. After 42
years of membership he retired from active work, but as a Life
Member of the Grand Lodge, still assisted with his counsel and
advice.
Bro. Jessep was also a Director of the N.S.W. Protestant
Hall Co. Limited, and held the position of Chairman of the
Company at the time of his death, which occurred on the 7th
November, 1916, after a painful illness.


The late Bro. James Robinson, m.1.c., p.r.w.g.m.
Bro. James Robinson was born at Aughantane, near Clogher,
County Tyrone, Ireland, in 1860. At 18 years of age he joined
the Orange Institution by being initiated in “Young Enniskillen”
L.0.L., No. 1112, at Enniskillen. In 1886 he married Miss
Robinson, of Clones, and came to Australia the same year. He
joined “Diamond” L.0.L., No. 54, by clearance, and on remov-
ing to Kogarah, he became affiliated with “Jubilee” L.0.L., No.
221. He resided at Kogarah for years, and during that time
assisted in forming “Bishop Ridley” L.0.L., No. 259, “Lord
Milner” L.0.L., No. 260, “Pride of Sutherland” L.0.L., No.
271, and “Daughters of Erne” L.0.L., No. 335, Jn each case
being the first Worshipful Master. Sister Mrs. Robinson was
the Worshipful Mistress of the “Daughters of Erne” Ladies’
L.0.L., and their only daughter is also a member of the same
lodge.
Bro. Robinson was a member of the Grand Lodge for many
years, and held the positions of F.G.C., D.G.M., and in 1913
was unanimously elected as R.W.G.M. and re-elected in 1914.
In business he gained the confidence of those with whom he
had any transactions, and his native wit was a great factor towards
his success. He was appointed a member of the Legislative
Council in 1922. His period of R.W.G.M. having terminated, he
gave his time and ability to help the Dill Macky Memorial
Homes, and the “Watchman” Newspaper Co., and was re-con-
structing this Company when he was called to his rest in Sep-
tember, 1922.
The late Bro. Gilchrist, g.s.
Bro. A. J. Gilchrist (better known in Sydney as “The
Major”) was born in Innerleigh Castle, Glenorchy, Scotland, on
April 25th, 1837. He received his education at the English
Academy, Glasgow, and was the winner of a Gold Medal and
a Scholarship. He went to Cape Colony in 1849, and to Quebec,
Canada, in 1853. His parents in the meantime having come
to New South Wales, Bro. Gilchrist joined them in 1856. He
joined the Loyal Orange Institution in March, 1857, being initi-
ated into No. 56, L.0.L., at North Sydney. From the first he
took a lively interest in the work, being soon elected Secretary,
which position he occupied for five years. He was instrumental
in opening No. 123, L.0.L., at Willoughby, and No. 150, at
North Sydney.
In 1875 he was unanimously elected Grand Secretary, holding
that position till 1883. In 1888 he was again elected to that
responsible office, which he filled until 1912. In 1882 he was


elected Secretary to the Grand Council of the Loyal Orange
Institution of Australasia, and at the meeting of delegates from
the various Grand Lodges held in Sydney in April, 1905, for
the formation of the Loyal Orange Grand Council, he was
unanimously elected as its first Grand Secretary. Bro. Gilchrist
passed away in December, 1916.

opened in the Scots’ Church in the month of July, 1901. The
Association extended all over this State and branches were
formed in New Zealand and South Australia. Dr. Dill Macky
died on the 15th October, 1913.

that thou didst in their days, and in the old
time before them.
