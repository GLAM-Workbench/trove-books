MELBOURNE is the second largest city in
Australia, and eighth in the British
Empire. It is notable for its beautiful parks
and gardens, its stately buildings and
glorious boulevardes. The Public Library,
Museum and the National War Memorial
are of outstanding interest. Melbourne has
17 theatres, and its hotels, commercial and
bank buildings are comparable with any
in the Southern Hemisphere. Electric rail-
way and tramway services are of efficient
type, and airways connect with all other
States in the Commonwealth.

FOREWORD
BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA THE RIGHT
HON. J. A LYONS
I commend this publication to all lovers of the beautiful
for it shows very well some of the most attractive places
in the lovely State of Victoria.
Glancing through these pages, one is forced to wonder
why tourists should leave Australia before they have viewed
the magnificent scenery of their own country. If this
publication serves to encourage more Australians to see
Victoria, and more overseas visitors to come to our country,
it will do a great service to Australia.

Sandringham, Mentone, Mordialloc, Chelsea, Carrum, and Frankston. Thus JHH|
far the highway is interesting but comparatively flat. On leaving Frankston
the road mounts Frankston Hill, and a splendid view of all the coast just Eft
traversed is obtainable. For the next seven miles or so, one passes through f r
run to Dromana, 43 miles round the picturesque eastern coastline of Port

trance to Westernport Bay, about
55 miles south of Melbourne. It is
reached by three main routes, all
of which are by well constructed
motoring highways, or by rail to
Merricks, about 8 miles away. The
most interesting road is direct to
Mornington, and along the main
highway almost to the top of
Arthur's Seat at Dromana. At this
point the road branches east
through Red Hill, and over some
very beautiful timbered hills and
valleys.

abandoned, it was nevertheless the
first white settlement in Victoria.

fashionable seaside resorts, and
has the advantages of an ocean
surfing beach (see this page) and a
calm bayside plage. An excellent
golf course, tennis courts, bowling
green, and fishing are among the
attractions for visitors.

LORNE is one of the State's most beautiful and fashionable seaside
resorts. Connected to the City by 90 miles of excellent roadway,
its appeal to the holiday-maker increases every year. There is not a
more glorious variety of scenery anywhere in Victoria than that
traversed along the Great Ocean Road, between Geelong and Lome.
From vast expanses of blue, rolling ocean, the scene changes rapidly
to stretches of pine forest, and intricate mountain passes. Lome's
magnificent stretch of beach presents a kaleidoscope of colour at the
height of the summer season, as a contrast to the densely timbered
slopes of the Otway Forest, which rises majestically behind the town.
The welfare of the visitor is adequately catered for in a well-equipped
shopping centre and cinema theatre. Everything for the holiday
sportsman is provided: tennis courts, croquet lawns, bowling greens,
dance halls, surfing, swimming, boating, fishing, and shooting.

Gisborne (32 miles) some very beautiful undulating
country scenery is displayed. Four miles further the
road passes within a mile or so of Lower Macedon.

rendezvous. In the town are tennis courts, bowling
greens and croquet lawns, as well as facilities for
fishing and shooting. Above all, there are the famous
Hillside Golf Links, with the first tee within one minute's
walk from the post office. At the foot of these two
pages is shown a panorama taken from the highest

HEPBURN
HEPBURN is the centre of Australia's most famous Radio-active
Mineral Springs. It is located 72 miles north-west of Melbourne, and
is no exception to the rule that Victoria's tourist resorts are among
the best catered for in Australia as regards arterial highways.
Hepburn Springs primarily owes its popularity to its mineral springs,
of which there are several varieties. They have all been
medically tested, and are highly recommended by the profession as
cures for internal ailments, rheumatism and dyspepsia. A picturesque
reserve has been constructed by the Hepburn Springs council, and
in the midst of its gardens and lawns and shady trees is a kiosk
(see centre of this page). In this kiosk are many taps from which
the mineral waters flow, and may be imbibed freely. The kiosk is
also used for concert and dance purposes.
ADJOINING the kiosk are mineral
baths, hot and cold, and electric,
where an experienced staff is con-
stantly in attendance to treat sufferers
to be cured of their various maladies.
SPRINGS does not appear to be unusually hilly country,
although it is pleasantly undulating. Nevertheless, its height is
2,040 ft. above sea level. The atmosphere is invariably clear and
healthy. All forms of sport are available for visitors, including golf.
A well tended golf course has been laid out in 18 interesting holes.
The surroundings make it one of the most picturesque in rural Victoria
(see illustration below kiosk). The nearby lakes and streams are well
stocked with fish, and are very popular rendezvous among anglers
during the season. Tennis players are well catered for, and only
three miles away is Daylesford, one of the relics of the early gold-
mining days, where race meetings are held occasionally through-
out the year. There are many pretty walks nearby, and sufficient
game to make shooting interesting.
JT is interesting to note that the
number of visitors to Hepburn
Springs each year, from interstate and
overseas countries, averages over
100,000. Most of them come for
radio-active treatment.

THE town of Queenscliff nestles behind the cliffs of the south-western extremity of Port
Phillip Bay, and ranks among the popular watering places of Victoria. It is reached by
Bay steamer direct, or by motor service from Geelong (20 miles). Very excellent
accommodation is available at Queenscliff's five hotels and seventeen guest houses.
Added to the pleasures of bathing from golden beaches is the sport of real sea fishing
and boating. Queenscliff is headquarters for Melbourne's fishing fleet, and fish are abundant.
Two golf courses are available for enthusiasts, as are also an 11-rink bowling green and
croquet lawn. Well constructed tennis courts are in constant service.

THERE are many attractive spots in the
vicinity of Queenscliff, each having a
distinctive appeal. A popular short run is to
picturesque Pt. Lonsdale, affording a vantage
point from which to view at close quarters the
ocean shipping passing in and out of the
Heads. Port Arlington, St. Leonards, Drysdale,
Clifton Springs, and other resorts on the
Bellarine Penisula are within easy motoring
distance.
Due to its unique situation, where sea breezes
from the Southern Ocean temper the hottest
summer day or warm the chill of winter cold,
Queenscliff's climate is moderate all the year
around. Boating and yachting are popular
pastimes. Two illustrations on this page show
a view of the port, and a section of the town
of Queenscliff.
