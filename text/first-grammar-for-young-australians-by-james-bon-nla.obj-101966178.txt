PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION-
The success of the “First Grammar for Young
Australians” has encouraged the Author to bring
out another edition, —one of five thousand.
At the request of some experienced Teachers
more questions have been appended, as exercises,
to certain lessons.
The little Work is intended for Junior Classes
at Schools, and as a Mother’s help for Children
at Home.
Nov. 13, 1867.




FIRST GRAMMAR
YOUNG AUSTRALIANS.
They who hear only correct language are
likely to speak correctly themselves.
But those persons study Grammar who
want to write and speak correctly, and seek
to know why one way of doing so is more
proper than another.
Grammar teaches us how to make
proper use of words.
Languages differ not only in the meaning
of words, but the form in which words are
put together.
Some of our twenty-six letters of the
alphabet can be easily sounded by themselves.
Others must have another letter with them
to give any sound.
The Vowels have the full sounds. A, e,
i, o, v, are vowels. All other letters are
Consonants.


Several letters together forming a simple
sound make a syllable.
A word of one syllable is called a mono-
syllable. A word of two syllables is a dis-
syllable. A word of three syllables is a
trissyllable. A word of more than three
is a polysyllable.
As the children of a school are divided
into Classes, so are the words of a language.
Some classes are large, and some are small.
There may be few boys in the Alphabet
division, and more in another.
Words are sorted in the same way, there
being many of one kind and few of another.
But while children change their classes as
they improve, words keep in their separate
places. .
The number of classes in a school may be
four, five, or six, according to numbers or
progress. But words are always arranged
into nine divisions.
Although there are forty thousand words
in the English language, they are all sorted
into nine classes, or Parts of Speech ;
that is. Parts of Language.
The names given to these are Noun,


Article, Adjective, Verb, Adverb, Pronoun,
Preposition, Conjunction, Interjection.
The largest class is that of the NOUNS.
Ths majority of words are nouns. They
are the names of things.
John bought the apple in Melbourne.
Here John is the name of a boy; apple
is the name of a fruit; and Melbourne is the
name of a place. John, apple, Melbourne,
are, therefore, nouns.
Everything we see, or feel, or know about,
has a name. That word or name is a noun.
Trees we see; happiness we feel; angels
we know about. The words trees, happiness,
and angels are nouns.
Write out a list of nouns, which are names of things
in the room.
Write out a list of nouns, which are names of things
you never saw.
Write out a list of nouns, which are names of feel-
ings, or things we know about, but cannot see with the
eye.
The noun can seldom stand alone without
a word before it. We do not say, table is
broken, but THE table is broken.
Such a word before a noun is called an
article. It separates one thing from the
rest of the same kind.
We may write A table, or THE table; A
A 2


and the are articles, because they particu-
larize or separate objects.
There are different sorts of things. All
boys are not alike. One is short, another is
tall. One is good, another is bad. One is
rude, another is kind.
There are different sorts or qualities of
apples. Some are sweet, others are hitter.
Some are large, others are small.
All these qualities, or sorts of things, are
adjectives. The words short, tall, good,
had, rude, kind, sweet, hitter, large, small,
are adjectives, because they tell the charac-
ter or quality of things.
Write down the characters or adjectives of your school-
fellows.
Write down the qualities or adjectives of your play-
things.
Describe the qualities or adjectives of different fruits
and animals.
Turn some nouns into adjectives; as happiness into
happy, and beauty into beautiful.
Every thing moves, or can be made to
move. Birds sing, insects crawl, boys eat.
Words which show what things do are
called verbs. Sing, crawl, eat, are verbs,
because they tell of what is being done.
Children are full of action. They jump,
run, cry, laugh, quarrel, love, and sleep.


The words which describe the actions, as
jump, run, cry, laugh, quarrel, love, sleep , are
Verbs.
Write out some verbs, showing the movements of
animals.
Write out some verbs, showing what boys do at school
and at home.
Things are not always done in the same
way. A number of girls are working; but
while some sew well, others sew carelessly.
Adverbs are the words which show how
the thing is done. Well and carelessly are
Adverbs.
Most adverbs answer to the question, how ?
How does the horse run ? Quickly. How
does that boy eat ? Greedily. Quickly and
greedily are Adverbs.
Write down adverbs of the actions of reading, speak-
ing, and striking.
We will now connect these Five Parts of
Speech.
The spiteful monkey scratches terribly.
The word monkey is the noun, because it
is the name of the thing spoken of.
The word spiteful is the adjective,
because it tells the character of the monkey.
The word the is the article, because it
shows of which one monkey we speak.
a 3


The word scratches is the verb, because
it describes the action of the monkey.
The word terribly is the adverb, because
it tells us how the action was done.
It is inconvenient to repeat the noun over
and over again.
It does not sound well to say, Tim fell into
Tims father's piysty, as Tim was reaching
over for a ball belonging to Tim.
It would be better to say, Tim fell into
HIS father's pigsty, as HE was reaching over
for a ball belonging to HIM.
The words his, he, and him are used instead
of the noun Tim. Such words are called
pronouns, because they are used instead of
nouns.
When talking to another, it is better to
say 1, than repeat your own name, and better
to say you than repeat the name of the person
to whom you are talking.
I, you, and they are Pronouns.
Write out pronouns suitable to a girl’s name, and
others suitable to a boy’s name.
Some things have connection with one
another. The man is on the horse, and the
sun is beyond the earth.
The word on shows the connection of the
man and the horse.


The word beyond shows the relation of the
sun and earth.
The prepositions are the words which
show the connection or relation of one thing
with another. On and beyond are Prepo-
sitions.
Write down the words which exhibit the connection
of a mouse and a trap, and of a cup and its saucer.
A short road is better than a long one.,
and a walk across the fields will often save
us going along two sides of it.
In the same way, the use of the CONJUNC-
TIONS saves many words.
Instead of saying, Tom fell in the ditch,
Harry fell in the ditch ; I may say, Tom and
Harry fell in the ditch.
The word and is a conjunction, because
it joins words or sentences together.
He was honest though he was poor. The
two sentences, he was honest, he was poor,
are connected by the Conj action though.
Join two other sentences or words by conjunctions.
If you tread upon a boy’s sore toe, he
calls out Oh ! or, O dear!
If you see a wonderful sight, you call out
Ah ! or. Hurrah !
Words which are exclamations are called


INTERJECTIONS. Oh I Ah ! O dear ! and
Hurrah! are interjections.
We will now give a sentence containing
all the Nine Parts of Speech.
O ! see sill// Tommy, he rolls thoughtlessly
among the thistles and nettles.
O is an interjection, as an exclamation
of surprise.
See is a VERB, as describing an action.
Silly is an adjective, giving the character
of Tommy.
Tommy is a noun, as the name of the boy.
He is a pronoun, used instead of the
noun Tommy.
Polls is a verb, shewing what Tommy
was doing.
Thoughtlessly is an ADVERB, telling how
he was rolling.
Among is a preposition, shewing the
connection of Tommy and the thistles.
The is an article, before the noun
thistles.
Thistles is a NOUN, as the name of prickly
plants.
And is a CONJUNCTION, joining the words
thistles and nettles.
Nettles is a noun, as the name of stinging
plants.
Write out a sentence, and put under each word the
name of the Part of Speech to which it belongs.


PAE T 11.
More about Nouns.
A Noun may be one thing or more. The
word may be box or boxes.
When meaning one, we call it singular
number. When meaning more than one, we
speak plural number.
The word box is a singular noun, and the
word boxes is a plural noun.
Write down the plurals of mouse, negro, gooseberry,
man, girl, tooth, and loaf.
What do you add to a singular noun to make it plural ?
How do you write the plural when the singular noun
ends in y, as lady 1
Write down the plurals of nouns ending in f,ff, and fe.
Names of persons and places are called
proper nouns, and names of other things
are common nouns.
Mary and Sydney are proper nouns, and
boy and town are common nouns.
All proper nouns must be spelled with
capital letters.
Some nouns are names of creatures that
are males, and some of those that are females.


Those of the male kind are said to be of
the masculine gender, and those of the
female kind are called of the feminine
gender.
When the tiling spoken of is neither male
nor female, the word is called a neuter one.
The names of some animals may be either
male or female.
The word boy is Masculine. The word
mare is Feminine. The word stone is Neuter
or neither gender. The word children is
either Masculine or Feminine.
Write down five nouns of each of these four sorts of
nouns.
A noun is affected by its place in a sen-
tence. Tom kicked the horse, is very different
from, The horse kicked Tom.
When doing something, Tom is put in the
NOMINATIVE CASE.
When the object of something done, Tom
is in the objective case.
When kicking, he was Nominative ; but
when the object of the horse’s kicking, he
was Objective.
In the sentence, Susan drank the milk, the
word Susan is nominative, and milk is objec-
tive.
We sometimes speak of a thing when
neither doing nor being done to.


The dog bit the pig's tail. Here dog is
nominative, as the doer, and tail is the objec-
tive, as the object of'the biting. But pig
is neither nominative nor objective.
As, however, the pig possesses a tail, the
word pig is said to be in the possessive
CASE.
The Possessive singular has an apostrophe,
like a comma, and an s after it.
The Possessive plural has the apostrophe,
but no extra s.
We write girl's bonnet , when we mean the
bonnet of one girl. We write girls' bonnets ,
when we mean the bonnets of several girls.
Write out some sentences, and put n over the nomina-
tive nouns, p over the possessive, and o over the objec-
tive.
How do you know the Objective ease from the Nomi-
native ?
Write down the marks or signs of the Possessive case.
How do you tell a plural Possessive from a singular
one ?
More about Adjectives.
While an adjective gives the quality of a
noun, there is a difference in the quality
itself.
When testing certain sugars in a shop, I
find one to be sweet, another sweeter, and the
third sweetest.
Sweet, sweeter , sweetest are all adjectives.


yet are simply varieties or degrees of
sweetness.
In a class, one may be clever, another
cleverer, and the top boy cleverest. We
know this by comparing them with each
other.
These three steps or degrees are called
POSITIVE, COMPARATIVE, and SUPERLATIVE
degrees.
Sweet is Positive, sweeter is Comparative,
sweetest is Superlative.
The changes are not always made by
adding er, and est. We do not say, bad,
bader, badest; but bad, worse, worst.
The comparative of little is less, and the
superlative is least.
In long words we write more and most; as
beautiful, more beautiful, and most beautiful;
and not beautifuller, beautifullest.
Some adjectives cannot be compared; as,
True, and Square. We cannot say truer, or
more square.
Some persons think the numbers one, two,
three, &c., and first, second, third, Sec. are all
adjectives, because put before nouns to tell
something about them.
They are commonly called numeral
ADJECTIVES.
Write out the comparative and superlative of these


positive adjectives— good, great, 'pretty, wonderful, ugly,
noble, delightful.
How is the comparative degree formed ?
How do you spell the comparative of words ending
in y; as, happy 1
How is the superlative degree formed ?
When would you use more instead of er, and most
instead of est ?
More about Articles.
"When the article points out one particular
thing, it is called DEFINITE. When no par-
ticular thing is required, the article is called
INDEFINITE.
A or an is the Indefinite article, and the is
the definite article.
When a word begins with a vowel, we use
an instead of a. We say an orange , not a
orange.
More about Pronouns.
The true pronouns, which stand instead of
persons’ names, are called personal pro-
nouns.
Individuals speaking of themselves employ
the FIRST person, saying I or We.
When speaking to others, they say, You,
which is the second person.
When speaking of others, they say, he,
she, or they, which are of the third
PERSON.


Thou is singular of you, and they is plural
of he, she, or it.
While he is masculine, she is feminine,
and it is neuter, the word they may be either
masculine, feminine, or neuter.
I, we, thou, and you may be either mascu-
line or feminine.
Personal pronouns are of different cases.
I and its plural ice, thou and its plural you,
he and she with their plural they, are all
nominatives, as they shew the doers of an
action.
The receivers or objects of an action are
objectives. Me and its plural us, Thee
and its plural you, him and her with their
plural them, are all Objectives.
He struck me. He is nominative, and me
objective.
ate them. She is nominative, and them
objective.
The possessive case is seen in the words
mine and its plural ours, thine and its plural
yours, his and hers with their plural theirs.
His slate was mine. His and mine are
both Possessive.
The compound Personal Pronouns are
myself, herself, themselves, &c.
Place together all the first personal pronouns, all the
second, and all the third.
Place together all the masculine pronouns, all the
feminine, and then the neuter.


What pronouns are of either gender ?
Make out a list of singular pronouns, and put against
each one its plural.
Write out the nominative pronouns, singular and
plural.
Write out all objective and possessive in the same
way.
Give all the compound personal pronouns.
A relative pronoun relates to some
noun or pronoun going before it.
The hoy who thrashed the donkey. The
relative who relates to its antecedent
boy.
While we say who to a man, we say which
to a dog.
The Kelative that is used for who or which.
Some words do not stand by themselves
like the true pronouns, but require a noun
after them.
They are called adjective pronouns,
because they bear the character of adjectives.
My, thy, his, her, our, your, their, its
and oicn, are POSSESSIVE Adjective Pro-
nouns.
We say This is ours, but not This is our.
A noun must be added, as, This is our book.
Some persons include the words this, that,
these, and those, as demonstrative Adjec-
tive Pronouns.
The indefinite Adjective Pronouns are


None, any, other, all, such, whole, some, both,
one, other, and another.
Correct this sentence : This is the man which stole the
horse who won the race.
When would you use the relative that 1
How do you know an adjective pronoun ? _
Repeat the demonstrative and indefinite adjective
pronouns.
More about Verbs.
The doing of anything may not go from
the person, or it may affect some one else.
Samuel ate all the pie. This shows that
the action of eating passed from Samuel to
the pie, and it was devoured.
Samuel slept afterwards. The action of
sleeping kept to the boy.
Ate is an active or a transitive Verb,
because the action goes off to something else.
Slept 18 a NEUTER or INTRANSITIVE Verb,
because the action is confined to the person.
Write out a list of active verbs, and a list of neuter
ones.
How can you tell an active from a neuter verb ?
A thing does not always happen at the
same time. There are Present, Past, and
Future TENSES or times.
We WRITE to-day, we WROTE yesterday , we
SHALL write to-morrow. Write is present
tense or time, wrote is past tense, shall write
is future tense.


We change the spelling of the present to
make the past, and place shall or ivill before
the word to make the future tense.
The Imperfect tense is the same as past.
It is the same to say, We were eating , as to
say. We ate.
There is a sort of past, called PERFECT
tense, known by the word have ; as, W?. have
written.
There is another sort of past, called plu-
perfect tense, known by the word had ; as.
You had gone.
There is, also, a kind of future, called
future PERFECT tense, known by the tvords
shall have , or will have ,* as. They shall have
seen, They will have heard.
Write out instances of the imperfect past tense.
What other kinds of past axe there, and what are their
signs ?
What are the signs of the two sorts of future ?
Write out the six tenses of eight verbs after the fol-
lowing manner; —
Present cry
Past cried
Perfect have cried
Pluperfect had cried
Future shall or will cry
Future Perfect shall or will have cried
Verbs are like pronouns in having num-
ber and person.
The verb connected with a plural noun is


different from that connected with a singular
one.
While saying The hoy spells, we do not
say, The boys spells, but the hoys spell.
The verb connected with a pronoun of the
first person is not the same as that connected
with one of the third person.
We say, I speak and he speaks, not I
speaks and he speak.
The present tense of a verb is thus
formed:—
Singular Plural
Ist Person I laugh We laugh
2nd Person Thoulaughest You laugh
3 rd Person He laughs They laugh
Write out in a similar way a tense of four other verbs.
How must a verb agree with the pronoun ?
There are various ways of describing an
action, and various changes in the spelling of
the verb to shew this difference.
These are the moods or Modes of Verbs.
The simple verb is the INDICATIVE, as.
You will read.
When the action depends upon another,
the mood is CONDITIONAL or SUBJUNCTIVE.
You will read if I send the hook. The
reading depends upon the sending of the
book. The verb if I send is conditional.
Sometimes we can do the thing, and at


others we may do it. This state is the
POTENTIAL.
James may spell. James can spell.
These two verbs, may spell, and can spell,
are in the Potential Mood.
The past of may is might. The past of
can is could.
When the verb marks a command or
request, it is imperative.
Upset the barrow. The word upset is in
the Imperative Mood.
The verb has no change in the infinitive
mood. It simply has the word to before it.
George loves to chatter. The verb to chat-
ter is in the Infinitive Mood.
Describe the difference between the Subjunctive and
the Potential Mood ?
What Moods require words as signs ?
What is the Imperative of the verb to stutter, and the
Infinitive of the verb he laughs ?
Write out instances of the moods in the following
manner
Indicative. Sally stitches her apron.
Conditional. Sally is good if she stitch her apron.
Potential. Sally may stitch her apron.
Imperative. Sally, stitch your apron.
Infinitive. Sally goes to stitch her apron.
There are other forms of the verb which
are not moods, but are participles.
The imperfect or present Participle


shows that the action is not yet done. It
ends in ing.
Robert is ciphering. Ciphering is the
Present Participle, as the sum is not finished.
The perfect or past Participle shows
that the work is done. It generally ends
in d.
Jane has written. The verb written is
Past Participle of the verb to write, because
it informs us that Jane’s pen work is com-
plete.
The past participle differs from the past
tense in having another verb before it, as
I was frozen I am frozen I shall be
frozen. The past tense is only froze, while
the participle is frozen.
The past or perfect participle is often
spelled differently from the past tense. I
wrote is past. I have written is past parti-
ciple.
When thus differently spelled, the verb is
irregular. There are 200 Irregular verbs.
The regular verb has the past tense and
past participle both ending in d.
I love, I have loved, would be Regular.
I broke, I have broken, would be Irregular.
When a verb wants either the present
tense, the past tense, or the perfect participle,
it is called a defective Verb.


May, must, and shall, are Defective. May
and shall have no participle, and must has
neither participle nor past tense.
How can you distinguish the Present from the Past
Participle ?
How does the Past Participle differ from the Past
Tense ?
When is a verb Irregular ?
Write out the Past Tense, the Past Participle, and
the Present Participle of ten Regular and ten Irregular
Verbs, in the following manner;—
Present. Past Tense. Past Participle. Present Participle.
Regular —l tiy. I tried. I had tided. lam trying.
Irregular —l fly. I flew. I had flown. lam flying.
The little verbs put before other verbs, to
help out their meaning, are called auxiliary
or helping Verbs.
They help out tenses and moods; as, shall
go, might go, have to go, can go.
The words shall, might, have, and can,
are Auxiliaries.
Independent verbs are often auxiliaries.
I do, I can, are independent. But they are
helping verbs in the sentences Ido write, I
can love.
The auxiliaries, with other verbs, form
COMPOUND verbs. Have eaten is a com-
pound verb.
The auxiliaries help to form many varieties
of time. Have forms the perfect tense, had


the pluperfect, shall the future, shall have
the future perfect.
Such auxiliaries are always joined to par-
ticiples ; as Have spoken, am struck, had gone.
Spoken, struck, and gone are participles.
The neuter verb To be, which shows the
state of a thing, is a very important verb.
As it is irregular in its way of forming the
present and past tenses, they are here
given:—
Indicative Mood.
Present Tense.
SINGULAR. PLURAL.
Per. I am. We arc.
2nd Per. Thou art. You are.
3rd Per. He, she, or it is. They are.
Past Tense.
Per. I was. We were.
2nd Per. Thou wast. You were.
3rd Per. He, she, or it was. They were.
Conditional Mood.
Present Tense,
ls£ Per. If I be.
2nd Per. If thou be.
3rd Per. If he be.
If we be.
If you be.
If they bo.


Past Tense.
Per. If I were.
2nd Per. If thou were.
3 rd Per . If he were.
If we were.
If you were.
If they were.
We have before spoken of transitive
Verbs. The Transitive or Active Verbs
arc opposed to the Intransitive or Neuter
verbs.
Eat was said to be transitive, and sleep to
be intransitive.
When an auxiliary is joined to a transitive,
forming a Compound Transitive Verb, two
forms, or Voices, appear, called active
and passive.
The difference is seen in these two sen-
tences; — The pig had eaten the potatoes, and,
then the pig was eaten himself.
The same nominative, pig, was the actor
in the first case, and the acted upon in the
second.
When the nominative, or subject of the
verb, is the doer, the compound verb is
active. When the nominative is done
something to, the verb is passive.
Had eaten is Active. Was eaten is Passive.
A simple active verb is turned into a pas-
sive verb, by putting the verb to he before
the past participle of the active verb.
b 3


John strikes , is active; John was struck , is
passive.
The past participle of strikes is struck, and
the word was is past tense of the verb to be.
A Neuter verb cannot be changed to the
passive. We cannot say, He is sit; or, You
were slept.
A preposition after the neuter enables us
to use the passive. I laugh is neuter. But
I laugh at becomes passive in the sentence I
am laughed at.
Describe the difference between Active and Passive
Voices.
How do you turn an active Verb into a Passive one?
How can you make the Passive Verb out of a Neuter
one?
Give the Passive form of the following Active Verbs ;
has known, had seen, is eating, were taking, have punished.
Prepare three sentences, having Active Verbs, and
convert them into the Passive form, after the following
manner:—
Active ; —The oyster pinched the monkey's paw.
Passive ; —The monkey's paw was pinched hy the oyster.
The changes produced in a verb by a
difference of Mood, Tense, Number, and
Person, form together, what is called, the
Conjugation or INFLEXION of the verb.


The Active Voice is conjugated after the
following manner:—

More about Adverbs.
Adverbs not only tell how a thing is done,
but when and where it is done.
The bird sang well. The bird sang yester-
day. The bird sang there.
Well is an Adverb of Manner, yesterday
an Adverb of Time, and there an Adverb
of Place.
Most Adverbs of Manner end in ly; as,
finely, sweetly, brightly.
Now, after, to-day, while, are Adverbs of
Time.
Among the Adverbs of Place are where,
here, near, forwards.
No, yes, why, how, almost, so, enough, are
adverbs.
The adverb is not only joined to a verb
to tell something about it, but is joined to
an adjective, or another adverb, to qualify its
meaning.


A most beautiful rose. The adverb most
qualifies the adjective beautiful, showing how
beautiful it was.
Sarah reads very distinctly. The adverb
very qualifies the adverb distinctly, showing
how distinctly it was.
Write out a list of Adverbs of Time, Adverbs of Place,
and Adverbs of Manner,
Give instances of Adverbs qualifying Adverbs, and
others qualifying Adjectives.
Underline the adverbs in the following sentences, and
put a cross under the words they qualify :
The hyena laughs hideously. Time soon files. Tom
went quite willingly, It is almost gone. The door in-
clined forwards.
More About Prepositions.
The following are the principal preposi-
tions, showing the relations things bear to
one another; —
About, against, after, around, at, before,
by, from, for, up, towards, ivithin.
More about Conjunctions.
The following are the principal conjunc-
tions, joining words or sentences together;—
Also, as, because, but, except, if, likewise,
not, so, than, therefore, whether.
Words which are relatives, prepositions,
or adverbs, become conjunctions when used
for conjunctions.


He was so hungry that he ate all the pie.
That ia a conjunction in this sentence,
though a relative elsewhere.
When then is used for therefore, and for is
used instead of because, they are conjunc-
tions.
