PREFACE.
How to live?is a question which forces itself upon
the attention of every sane man.
Some, the few, are so placed by Providence as to
have no anxiety about the supply of all their wants.
Others, the many, require constant effort and care
to provide food and raiment.
The object of all should be to live honestly, to
make provision for their dependants, to be helpful
toward their fellow men and to prepare for Eternity.
Every man should love his country, but not in such
a way as to prefer being supported by charity, rather
than seek independence in a strange land.


Emigration is not a novelty ; it was a custom four
thousand years ago. We have for years had thousands
emigrating to America. The writer has grasped the
hand of the Settler and bid him God speed as he
struck out his lonely path into the wilderness. He
has seen as thriving, intelligent, well to do traders,
or farmers, hundreds who at home could only have
earned a scanty subsistence.
Where there are many men to do a certain work,
more men than are really needful, it is certain they
cannot be so well remunerated for their labour as
if there were only enough or less than enough men.
In Britain we have more people of certain trades
than are required for the amount of work. If we
can find a country, where such people are wanted,
common sense says, let them go. But before
deciding to go to any land we should know why
the demand comes. Is it because the climate is
sickly and the labourers die ? Is it simply to bring
down the rate of wages for a particular manufacture ?
Are there any serious drawbacks ? Is there liberty
in the land ? Can I worship my Creator according
to my conscience ? Are the habits of the people
such as greatly to imperil the souls of my children ?
Can I obtain a good education for them ? All these
questions should be answered before any man can be
justified in leaving England. Shall a man sell his
soul for a mouthful of bread ? Nevertheless many
are in great straits for needful food; the pinched hun-
gry look and downcast eye tell of sufferings the
tongue will not name. If there be a country on earth


regarding which all these questions can be answered
satisfactorily, is it not a pity for our hungry ones not
to go there ? If that country, moreover, belongs to
Great Britain, has a population of men loving Old
England, under the government of our honoured and
noble Queen, with nearly the same, or in some res-
pects better laws than ourselves, surely then we
should be helpful to our neighbour, ? who has waxed
poor beside us,? in going there.
Another point: justice demands that we do not
?get rid? of the bad people of our own land to plant
and propagate them, to cultivate the race, in easy
circumstances in a young country, there offering a
premium to vice ; that new country being our own,
prudence requires that we send such as will be order-
ly and faithful; and charity says, favour those who
making their homes in the land, will there promote
peace, righteousness, and progress.
A strong reason for poor industrious men of Britain
going at once to Australia, is its proximity to China,
and the fact that the Chinese are now feoling their
country not so ? celestial? as they supposed, that better
food is to be had than rats, and, consequently, as we
are informed by late advices, thousands are now
pouring into California. There is something terrible
in the idea of a general Chinese emigration.
This little book has been written to assist those in
coming to a decision whose means of gaining infor-
mation are not sufficient to enable them to see their
way clearly before them. The decision having been
made, to give all needful directions in plain and dis-


tinct terms and advice as to movements when arrived.
Scattered throughout are a few hints as to conduct,
which, it is trusted the reader will receive as kindly
as they are meant by the writer.
Gentlemen whose position leads to enquiries from
working men may safely trust this volume in their
hands as a guide. #


AUSTRALIA
WHO SHOULD GO
Chapter I.
John Speers, a jobbing gardener, hearing
a great deal said about going to Australia,
calls upon Mr . Freeman, who takes a pleasure
in helping his neighbours, to ask his advice.
Mr. F. ?Well, John, what can I do for you this
morning?
John. ?Why, Sir, there?s a deal of talk about emi-
grating to Australia, a many of my neighbours have
been shaping for going and as my work is?nt any too
plentiful, perhaps you?d be so good as give me your
opinion whether it would do for me.
Mr. F. ?Take a seat and let us have a little con-
versation. T irst of all, John, if a man is doing well
for himself and his family in England, there?s no
reason why he should go. for after all said about"
other countries there?s none comes up to old England
yet, with all her faults.
A new country is no place for idle or helpless
folk, or dandies, fine ladies or any sort of people
who are unable or unwilling to work and do for


themselves, or are too proud to turn their hands
to any thing. St. Monday men, who drink on that
day and take Tuesday to get over it and are not
?mod lor much on Wednesday, had better stop at
home, unless they make up their minds to work
six days a week and hard too. To get on there a
man must be steady, industrious, and wide awake;
he should know the value of a savings bank and how
to make one penny into two ; .till, a very dull fellow
can get work if he will only .be steady and willing.
Now a man of this character will generally thrive
here, but it is no easy matter and if, notwithstanding
ill the difficulties which beset him, he does prosper,
i e would certainly be a likely man to become wealthy
in a position of greater advantage. Think for your-
self John, what is most likely to be wanted in a
new country; not the fine things that we learn to
want, but the needful things we cannot do without.
Hence, you see, those trades which produce or
manufacture the necessaries, or needful things o
life are the trades first wanted.
John, Such as farmers, clothing makers and house
builders ? .
Mr p. Just so; clothing, however, may be im-
ported; but there is a certain yellow metal, that we
all think a good deal of, which can be exchange*
for these things, and this we are told has lately been
found in Australia.
John. ?At the diggings, Sir ?
jjf r . F. ?That?s it John, but copper is found there
also, consequently, miners get work easily. But don?t
you deceive yourself about the gold. A friend of
mine said in a letter received a few days ago, t lat
when he was coming away from the diggings he saw
an Irishman grumbling about and saying he had been


? told the goold was to be found in quarts (quartz)
but niver a pint of it could bis fingers grip.? You
must not go on the strength of the gold diggings,
but of getting good work and making a valuable
man of yourself.
John. ?l don't think so much about the gold, sir,
as of getting good work and good wages and by and
by setting up for myself.
Mr. F. ?That?s right. The great rush now is for
the gold. The accounts just received (June) fully
confirm all that has been said about the astonishing
quantities discovered. The other great produce of
Australia is sheep and other cattle and many kinds
of farm stuff, (wheat and so forth) but sheep are the
principal stock. Numbers of shepherds and farm
servants having gone off to seek gold, there is a great
scarcity of such men and very good wages are gladly
given. Not only are men from the neighbourhood
of the gold fields gone, but by the latest accounts,
the settlements in New Zealand (see map) are de-
serted, and numbers have come over from California;
men getting good pay in constant situations, and
tradesmen of all descriptions, unable to resist the
temptation, have shouldered the pick and cradle and
joined the crowd. Many establishments are actually
closed for want of hands. The work thus forsaken
is waiting for others who will step into the vacancy.
Now, John, go and talk to your wife about it, and
when you and she have thought over it, tell such of
your neighbours as have a mind to work hard, as
hard or harder than at home, to be sober and to put
up with a good deal they will not like, at first, in
order to better themselves and their children after-
wards, to come with you at seven o?clock in the evening.


Chapter 11.
John Speers comes as appointed and a num-
ber of men and some women with him.
Mr. F. ?Good evening: a good many of you seem
to be thinking about this matter.
John Speers has told you, I suppose, of our con-
versation this morning. As I do not know all your
trades, here is a list of those most wanted and likely
to do best. The number of persons of all kinds of
emplovments who have left their situations has made
room for many who otherwise should not have
gone, but yet no one should think of going who
cannot do manual labour; who cannot, or is not
willing to use his own bodily powers to earn his
bread.
TRADES WANTED.
Most particularly: ?
Shepherds,
Farm Servants,
Agricultural Labourers,
Female Servants,
Secondarily:?
Carpenters,
Bricklayers,
Masons,
Blacksmiths,
Miners,
Carters,
Printers,
Millers,


Sawyers,
Wheelwrights
Tankers,
Shoemakers,
BrICKM AKERS,
Coopers,
Working Engineers,
Gardeners,
Quarryhen,
Well Sinkers.
Some of these require a few remarks. The four
named at the head of the list are in extreme demand,
particularly in South Australia (Adelaide), and Victoria
(Port Philip)? The number who may be employed is
unlimited. It is said also, by many dock-masters,
that the Shepherds do not need to have been brought
up to the trade, but that any young man active,
healthy, and wulling, can get employment if he wishes.
It is not, however, a desirable life fora young man of
mmd, except as a beginning; or as a means of be-
coming acquainted with Colonial life. But to a per-
son short of food in England, the engagement is not
to be slighted. Of the remainder those are best suited
who have been accustomed to country work and have
been employed about farms ; just at present however,
there is room in the towns also.
The description asked for most earnestly are young
married couples without children.
In all cases they should be persons who, when a
tiling needs doing, will set about it heartily and hope
fully, with a will, without stopping to enquire very
minutely as to which particular department of trade
it belongs.


But if any of you understand only the following, and
cannot set about any other, you had better stay
where you are.
TRADES NOT WANTED.
Cabinet Makers, (fine work,)
Plasterers,
Painters,
Tailors,
Tinmen,
Watch Makers,
Governesses,
Artists,
Schoolmasters,
Lawyers.
Physicians.
The reason for these trades and professions not
being in demand is explained by what we said at
first; the wants felt in a new country are for things
we cannot do without, not things we learn to need.
Cabinet Makers? The furniture used is either very
rough, or imported.
Painters are not much wanted, because their art is
not essential to comfort.
Tailors. ?Garments are imported ready-made from
England.
There is no reason why persons of these trades
should not go, provided they can gain their living by
some of the trades in demand, instead of their own; or
will be content to sink to the humble rank of
shepherds or servants. Any one at all with a stout
heart and a strong arm may readily and easily get a
comfortable living.


Women who can wash and mend clothes and make
themselves generally useful are much wanted, for it
happens that there are fewer women than men there,
the contrary being the case here.
The increase of population in the country will soon
make room for other trades than those required at first,
hut we must wait till friends write home with par-
ticular information on these points. It would be
very unwise to go out on speculation, unless, as be-
fore stated, able to work at manual labour.
Now I must tell you something about the place you
wish to go to. Australia is an Island at the other side
of the earth. The earth being round, it follows that
some part of it must be opposite to us; that is, the
feet of the people there are against our feet, and to
us they seem to be standing head downward. Of
course when you get there you find them standing
on there feet as we do and not like flies on a ceiling.
On the map this country does not look very large,
but trace the following distances. From Sydney
(East Coast) to North West Cape (West Coast),
is about 3,500 Miles; and from Bass?s Strait
(South East Point) to Port Essington (North), is
about 2,000 Miles. The area of land is about fifty
times as large as England and Wales. But it must
not be supposed that this vast extent is all fertile
country. The whole centre of the continent (see
map) is yet unknown, but immense tracts of arid,
sandy desert have been discovered. The waste land
extends, it is calculated, to at least one third of the
whole. The Climate varies, of course ; in the South
it is warm, ranging from 50� to 110� in the shade,
but though at times very hot, it is never oppressive
as it is here. The towns look very like English


ones, the English Language being spoken and the
great bulk of the people being British it does not
strike one much as a foreign country, and the less so
as the Government is also British.
The Country is remarkably healthy. A dry pure
atmosphere and comparative freedom from swamps,
entirely excluding fever and ague, so sad a scourge
of the Emigrants to America ?is very beneficial to
persons of weak lungs, and in every way favourable
to human life. But excess is more speedily fatal than
in England; the man who here might long continue
to indulge his vices, finds there the iron grasp of
death soon arrest him.
Fruits of almost all climes grow luxuriantly. In
this respect the capabilities of the colony are only
jnst beginning to be tried, and doubtless a largo
trade will yet arise. In this part of the world wo
find the cold increases as we proceed in a northerly
direction, there it is the reverse, the south being
temperate, the north within the tropics. Many other
circumstances are quite the reverse of ours; our day
is there night; winter here, is summer there. Let
us look at the map a little longer. Above Australia
(North) are a number of Islands with a tremend-
ously hot climate, and savage or unfriendly inhabit-
ants ; above them again comes China. To the right
hand (East) are the Islands of the South Seas; right-
hand corner (South East) is New Zealand, with room
enough for hundreds of labouring men, if they should
not find work in Australia. Return again to the man i-
land. Proceeding up the right hand coast (East) you
see Sydney, this is the chief city of the district of
New South Wales, containing about 306,000,000
acres of land. Directly inland about 140 miles is


Bathurst, all around which lies one of the great gold
regions. Coming down the Coast again we reach
Cape Howe, and follow the coast line to Cape Otway,
making a triangle from these two points to the river
Murray, is the province of Victoria, formerly called
Port Philip, with an extent of 51,000,000 acres. This
is the best grazing and most fertile district of the
whole. At the head of Port Philip Bay you will see
Melbourne, the chief city, just now crammed with
people bound for the Diggings. From Melbourne a
Steamboat plies to Geelong, fast rising into import-
ance : at various distances from these cities lie the
southern gold fields, said to be richer even than
the Bathurst district Coal of good quality has
been found. From Cape Otway proceeding west-
ward along the coast for 800 miles and forming
nearly a square figure, is the province of South
Australia, of which the chief city, Adelaide, is dis-
tinctly marked; this district has not yet displayed
any gold regions, and consequently the tide of popula-
tion has set outwards, causing extreme distress for
want of labour, especially in Sheep farming, and
Agriculture. Here also are the great Burra Burra
Copper Mines,
Passing a long tract of mid country, we come to the
Swan River dictrict, chiefly occupied by settlers who
have worked their way into possession of farms. A
large and increasing district with room for agricul-
tural labourers well acquainted with their trades,
and for female servants. Further north we will not
go, the climate being unsuitable.
At the South Eastern extremity is Van Dieman?s
Land, a large island two hundred miles distant from
the mainland ; but at present the inducements to
settle there are not equal to the other provinces.


To closefor the present, John, you have to dispose of
your labour and your skill to the best advantage you
can. In England labour and skill are plentiful, and
living is somewhat expensive ; in Australia, labour
and skill are scarce, and living was cheap and soon
will be again so : consequently Australia is a better
place to dispose of certain kinds of labour than
England.
Now my friends, calmly think and talk over the mat
ter; reckon what you would have to give up and what
you expect to gain, and if any decide to go, come to me
in a few days.
WHERE TO GO.
As the men retire Mr. Freeman observes
them engaged In an animated discussion;
after reaching the door they return and John,
being spokesman to the party, first apologises
for so doing, then says: ?You were good
enough to tell us a deal about different parts,
Sir, and we saw the names of the places on
the map, but we are fairly puzzled, after all,
which part to fix upon as the best.
j\j r _ p_ ?Very likely, but we can clear up that
matter, X think without much delaj. Reason again
John; you have something to dispose of?l hour
the part of the country most wanting labour, is the
place for you. The choice lies between three pro-
vinces, New South Wales, Victoria, and South
Australia. The latest accounts from New South
Wales say, that they have not suffered much for


want of hands, that the farmers are able pretty com-
fortably to get through their work, though there
is room for more men. But from Victoria and
South Australia we hear that both cattle and crops
are in danger of being lost for want of persons to
look after them ; and that many other branches of in-
dustry are suffering very much. At the Swan River,
or Western Australia, they can do with a good many
more, but are not in urgent need of help. Now the
case is plain that the best market for your labour, is
either Adelaide (South Australia), or Port Philip
(Victoria). I use these names now because they are
the names used in the ship advertisements.
John ?Will that apply to all of us, Mr. Freeman?
M r - F. ?To all who intend to be Shepherds or
Agricultural labourers especially, but other trades also
will be safer to make for Port Philip. However you
will perhaps be governed in this by the chance of
getting a passage.
Chapter 111.
HOW TO GO.
John Speers and several companions having
decided to go, call again upon Mr. Freeman.
John S. Well, Sir, we have pretty well made up
our minds to go, and try to mend ourselves, but the
job is how to get there.
Mr. F. ?Very well.
Whatever you do, on no account give up your pre-
sent employment until you are quite sure.

You don?t expect to walk, seeing it is 16,000 sea
miles distant. If you have money to spare, a first
cabin passage in a first class" ship, is by far the
pleasantest, and if by a steamer the time saved may
more than make up the extra charge.
A great many vessels are now going taking second
class passengers, for from �l6 to �25 each. For this
sum you get a good many comforts and very nearly
all the food you will want. Here is the provision
scale of Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Co.?s ships.
Other respectable Owners are about equal.
SCALE OF PROVISIONS FOR SECOND CABIN.


Rice is served out as a substitute for potatoes, or
when the potatoes are expended, (lib. of rice or oat-
meal being equal to 31b. of raw potatoes ; ami lib.
of preserved potatoes equal to 31bs. of raw potatoes.)
Coffee or cocoa may be substituted for tea.
When fresh beef is issued, lib. to each adult per
day will be allowed ; there will be no flour, rice,
raisins, peas, suet, or vinegar, during the issue of
fresh meat. Salt fish will be substituted on Fridays,
if required, in lieu of meat.
In the London ?Times,? and other papers, are
numbers of advertisements for this class, and a letter
to the Owners would obtain full particulars. But I
fear none of you can spare �2O, and therefore, I say
no more about second cabin, but come now to steerage
passages, which will be more within your reach.
There are now scarcely any vessels taking steerage pas-
sengers, except Government or Society vessels, re-
specting which more will be said presently.
The steerage berths and accommodations are very-
different to second cabin ones, and you require many
more articles of your own, if you are to be at all
comfortable. The passage costs from �l2 to �l6
each grown up person. Children under 12 months
old free ; from 3 year to 7 years, one-third price ; 7
to 14 years, half-price.

the respectable Firms :

main trust, for even if the vessel can be judged of,
the provisions cannot, until too late. Beware of man-
catchers and land-sharks, a set of scoundrels who
prowl about the seaports, and under the pretence of
kindness, entrap and cheat poor emigrants most
cruelly.
But I should be very sorry to advise you to waste
your hard-earned savings in taking first cabin passages;
on the contrary, get as cheaply as you possibly can
with safety. The cheapest is to be sent out by Her
Majesty's Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners,
who have received a certain sum of money from the
Colonies wherewith to send out persons of the de-
scriptions wanted in those colonies. Of course they
cannot send persons not required.


Instructions for applying to he sen f out by
the Commissioners.
It is of no use for any one described in the fol-
lowing list to apply, they will not he sent.
Governesses and females not of the working classes,
professional men, schoolmasters, clerks of every de-
scription, persons without capital who are not la-
bourers.
Families with more than four children under 12
years of age, widows or widowers with young children,
unmarried females with children, persons under 18
without parents or near relatives, capitalists, or
persons in the habitual receipt of parish relief.
lor the present (June) single men unless sons in
families going, and balanced by young women of
good character.
Any person not in the above list, and being sober
and industrious, in good health, and going out to
work for wages, may apply.
The first thing to do is to write a letter, in which
must be stated your age, trade, number and age of
children, (if any,) and any reason you can think of to
make it desirable for the Commissioners to send you.
Jake care to tell the truth, and be sure to give your
address, so that the answer may find you. This let-
ter must be post-paid, and sent to

CAUTIONS.
I.?Sending this form of application does not moan
that you are sure to be accepted, and if you give up
jour employment or in any way damage yourself, it
is at your own risk.
? Further Information see Appendix.


2 The selecting agents have no power to promise
passages or to take money, if you pay them an)
money, it is entirely at your own risk.
3. ?Should you make any false statement in your
application, you are liable to a penalty of �5O.
4. ?lf on examination any applicants are found
to have deceived the Commissioners, as to health,
children, capability, or in any way whatever, they
will be refused the passage, and have no claim on the
Commissioners. Or if after getting on board'they
are guilty of mis-conduct, they will be put ashore,
and forfeit the money they have paid.
OUTFIT.
The Commissioners supply provisions, medical
attendance, and cooking utensils at their depot, and
on board the ship. Also new mattresses, bolsters,
blankets, and counterpanes, canvas bags to contain
linen, &c., knives aud forks, spoons, metal plates, and
drinking mugs, which articles will be given after
arrival in the colony to the emigrants who have be-
haved well on the voyage.
The emigrants must bring their own clothing,
which will be inspected at the port by an Officer of
the Commissioners, and they will not be allowed to
embark unless they have a sufficient stock for the
voyage, not less for each person than
FOR MALES,
Six shirts.
Six pairs stockings.
Two ditto shoes.
Two complete suits of
exterior clothing.
FOR FEMALES.
Six shifts.
Two flannel petticoats.
Six pairs stockings.
Two ditto shoes.
Two gowns.


With sheets, towels, and soap. But the larger the
stock of clothing the better for health and comfort
during the Voyage, which usually lasts about four
months, and as the emigrants have to pass through
hot and cold weather, they should be prepared for
both ; two or three serge shirts for men, and flannel
for women and children, are strongly recommended.
The emigrants should take out with them the
necessary tools of their trades that are not bulky.
But the whole quantity of baggage for each adult
must not measure more than 20 cubic or solid feet,
nor exceed half a ton weight. No box must exceed
in size 10 cubic feet. Large packages and extra bag-
gage, if it can be taken at all, must be paid for.
Mattresses and feather beds will in no case be taken.
On arrival in the colony the emigrants will be at
perfect liberty to engage themselves to any one willing
to employ them, and to make their own bargain for
wages ; hut if they quit the colony within four years after
landing , they must repay to the Colonial Government a
proportionate part of their passage money, at the rate of
�3 per adult for each year wanting to complete four years
residence.

Lieut. Griffiths, R.N., Waterford and New Ross.
Lieut. Saunders, R.N., Galway.
These officers act undei the immediate directions
of the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners,
and the following is a summary of their duties.; ?
They procure and give gratuitously information as
to the sailing of ships and the means of accommoda-
tion for emigrants ; and whenever applied to for that
purpose, they see that all agreements between ship-
owners, agents, or masters, and intending emigrants
are duly performed. They also see that the provi-
sions of the Passengers? Act are strictly complied
with, viz, that passenger-vessels are seaworthy, that
they have on board a sufficient supply of provisions,
water, medicines, &c., and that they sail with proper
punctuality.
They attend personally at their offices on every
week day, and afford gratuitously all the assistance
in their power to protect intending emigrants against
fraud and imposition, and to obtain redress where
oppression or injury has been practised on them.
Another way to secure a passage, and a far more
comfortable one, is by means oi the ?Family Colo-
nization Society ,?
(MRS. CHISHOLM'S).
This society aims at being self-supporting, and


aiding the working classes to emigrate in a respect-
able and independent manner.
Persons wishing to go out in the society?s vessels,
must become members and comply with the rules.
To become members send in two testimonials of
good character, and state age, residence, occupation,
and whether married or single, with an entrance fee
of Is. each; the name will then be entered on the
Society?s books.
The Address is ,
Mrs. Chisholm.
8, Charlton Crescent , Islington ,
London.
Any letters wanting answers must enclose two
stamps. Put your own address in every letter you
send.
Testimonials. ?All testimonials (which are in no
case returned ) are sent to the Colony. To ensure re-
spectability, married persons are required to shew
their marriage certificate.
Fees. ?To meet the expenses of the society, a
further fee of 10 s. each by adults, and ss. each for all
children under fourteen years of age, must be paid
in the Colony.
Loans. ?Loans are only granted to persons paying
their passage-money by weekly or monthly instal-
ments, and whose membership has extended over a
period of at least Jour months. Passages are granted
only to those persons who have paid to the society the
whole proportion of money required. Four months?


membership is not necessary when parties can pay
the whole of their passage money, and do not require
a loan.
Family Groups ?Meetings are held (under Mrs.
Chisholm?s superintendence) to form the emigrants
into groups, and to introduce friendless youug women
to the heads of families, who are responsible for their
welfare during the voyage. In like manlier youths
are protected.
lie-union of Families. ?By means of the Society?s
Agents in Australia, persons there can forward money
to England to enable members of their family to join
them in the Colony. The Eegulations of the Society
do not admit of the separation of man and wife.
Notice of Departure. ?Due notice is always given of
the departure of each vessel, and persons should on
no account leave their situation till such final notice
is received. .
Price of Passage. ?The exact sum to be charged as
passage money cannot be possibly stated when the
name is entered. Children between one and fourteen
half-price. Infants (under twelve months) nothing.
The fluctuation in the charge arises from the variation
in prices at which vessels can be procured at different
periods. ?N.B. The Society engage none but A I
ships, and each vessel carries an experienced Surgeon.
Arrangements on board the Society?s ships.
Cabins. ?Enclosed cabins are furnished to each
family, of a size according to the number of individuals.
Children above fourteen years of age are provided
with compartments for sleeping separate from those
of their parents. One enclosed cabin is allotted for


seven single females ; also an enclosed cabin for seven
young men, in parts of the vessel appropriated by
classification for those berths.
Personal Comfort. ?Much personal comfort arises
from the feeling that all the passengers are on a foot
ing of equality, there being no classification in the
Society?s vessels, and all possess the privilege of
walking on the poop.
Ventilation. ?The novel contrivance for ensuring
ventilation between decks, invented by Dr. Bowie,
will be used in all vessels despatched by the Society.
Cooking. ?The provisions (after being prepared by
the Emigrants) will be cooked by an Emigrant?s cook
provided by the Society to perform that duty.
Health. ?Passengers are secured against any over-
crowding of the vessel. In addition to increased
space, the passengers have wash-houses and shower-
baths upon deck, which greatly increases comfort and
health.
Passengers must provide
Knife and Fork.
Table and Tea Spoons.
Metal plate.?Hook pot.
Drinking Mug.
Meat dish.
Water-can.
Washing-basin.
Two Cabbage-nets.
One Scrubbing-brush.
Half-a-gallon of Sand.
Flour-bag.
Half a Bath-brick.
Two sheets of sand-paper.
Two coarse canvas aprons.
Hammer.?Tacks.
Leathern straps, with buckle, to
secure the beds neatly on deck
when required to be aired.
Three pounds of Marine Soap.
The Society provide cooking and mess utensils
Bedding. ?Passengers must provide themselves
with bedding. Feather beds are on no account
permitted.
Duration of Voyage. ?Sixteen weeks is the average
duration of the voyage; and every Emigrant is en-


titled to to draw sixteenweek?s rations, according to the
Society?s Dietary Table for June 1852, here given
Biscuit,..., 3 lb.
Beef 1 lb.
Pork 1 lb.
Preserved Meat,,,.,... 1 lb.

Do. each Infant 1 gall. 3 qts.
To prevent waste, parties not using the quantity of
rations to which they are entitled, can take them
away on leaving the ship. This reserve will he use-
ful to them if they go up the country, or until they
have permanent employment.
N. B. The Society put on hoard Water and Pro-
visions for 22 weeks, in case the voyage should last
so long.
Debarkation. ?On the arrival of the emigrant at
Port Philip, tents are erected for their temporary
residence. By this means persons of both sexes are
secured from many expenses and inconveniences re-
sulting from seeking lodgings in haste. One large tent
is used as an office for hireing Emigrants. Persons
engaging will he furnished by Captain Chisholm, or
the Society?s Agents, with every advance and informa-
tion tending to their benefit and security, free of all
charge, but no pecuniary aid can be given.
OFFICES OF THE SOCIETY.
3, Charlton Crescent, Islington, London;
29, Bucklersbury, near the Mansion House, London;


Melbourne, Port Phillip;
King William Street, Adelaide ;
George Street, Sydney, and
Van Diemen?s Land.
By the efforts of Mrs, Chisholm and this excellent
Society, unprotected persons of either sex, are sent
to join their relations, or established in homes with
admirable care. Besides making ship arrangements,
the secret of the Society is in extending the family
feeling to those deprived of guardians and to the groups.
About �5OO a day is now being paid into the
Treasurers by the working classes, and very large
sums are being sent from Australia to assist poor
relations in emigrating. By the clever management
of the Bankers, sums, even to 2s. weekly, may be
paid in there and applied here.
Mrs. Chisholm has completed the arrangements
for a model line of ships from Liverpool, and has
lines forming in Southampton, Bristol, Aberdeen
and Glasgow. By these vessels the passage in
comfort and respectability, is far above ordinary
steerage, if not superior to second class in some.
The anxiety and toil this lady cheerfully undertakes
is truly marvellous.
Another Society for helping Emigrants is the York
shire (West Riding) Association, for the promotion
of Emigration to Australia. Acting Secretary,
Mr. Joseph Sharpe,
3, Bank Street,
Leeds.
This society advances money on loan, but requires
the whole to be repaid with interest. For the present


aid is only granted to persons belonging to the West
Biding, and coming within the description of persons
sent by her Majesty?s Commissioners.
For assisting the poor of the Highlands of Scotr
land, a fund has been raised by subscription. The
Society sends out families, by the help of her Majesty?s
commissioners, the expense being from <�l to <�2 for
adults, and 10s for children, and under the usual
regulations. The society advances money to pay the
required amount. The owners of the property from
which the emigrant goes have to pay one third of
the sum, and the emigrant has finally to repay the
whole, after which the money is again expended in
the same way.
The society has agents in the Highlands and the
London secretary is,
J. B. Standish Halt, Esq.,
4, St. Martin?s Place, Trafalgar Square
Numerous societies, of more or less merit, are now
being formed but the above are those known, and
made public. It is not uncommon for a number of
persons to form themselves into an Emigrant. Club.
The manner of proceeding is, to meet together, ap-
point a Treasurer, Secretary, and Managers. These
persons should of course be well qualified and trust-
worthy. It may then be arranged to pay in sums
weekly or at other periods to the Treasurer, who must
keep a careful account. The Secretary procures in-
formation of every kind, and at the meetings, held
weekly, or oftener, makes known all particulars.
When the money in hand approaches nearly to the
supposed needful amount, the Managers will proceed
to make enquiry after vessel. If not agreeing to go


in any of the Society?s vessels, it is better to em-
ploy some respectable ship Agent; such may be heard
of by applying to the local agent of her Majesty?s
Emigration Commissioners, by his help a bargain
may be made for increased accommodation, and at
lower charges. In the outfit, also, much may be
saved by this wholesale plan of action. And there is
the advantage of going in company with friends,
which if wisely planned, may be of great benefit. A
society of a dozen or so families would find the com-
fort and economy of their union very great. The Se-
cretary should apply to Mrs. Chisholm for rules and
information which would be cheerfully granted. Of
course it is absolutely needful that such only should
join the society as would agree to the rules, and con-
duct themselves to the mutual satisfaction of the
members. If the members are able to pay the amount
in full at once, the same or even greater savings may
be secured. Take for instance the article of Informa-
tion; a copy of each of the best books, postages, &c.,
would cost Eight shillings, if procured by a society of
a dozen members, this would only be eight-pence each.
These clubs should on no account be formed at
taverns or public houses. Meeting at such a place
they would suffer both in character and pocket.
If all these means fail, or cannot be acted upon,
there yet remains the ordinary berths and passages
of advertised vessels open to all who can pay the sum
required.
For information only, without any money help,
application may be made to
The Secretary,
Committee of Colonists ,
11, Poultry,
London.


This Society consists of a number of gentlemen,
themselves formerly emigrants, now residents in
various parts of Australia. Captain Stanley Carr, of
Port Philip, is the Chairman. The Committee give
practical advice and information, but have no money
at all at their disposal. Persons desiring information
should enclose with the questions, an envelope ready
stamped and directed for the answer.
The British Ladies Female Emigrant Society has for
its object the welfare and comfort of female emigrants.
The Society endeavours to effect its purpose by send-
ing fit candidates for the office of matron on board
ship, and preparing them for their duties, also, by
supplying Bibles, books, and tracts, with materials
for work and amusement. Female Emigrants suit-
able for the office of Matron, or seeking advice may
apply to
The Secretary,
Ladies' Emigrant Society,
25, Bed Lion Square,
London.
The Society has offices in the principal Ports,
where they will he exceedingly thankful for dona-
tions of money, or various old and new materials, a
list of which will he sent on application.


Chapter IV.
WHAT TO TAKE.
Take no had habits that you can possibly get rid of.
If helped out by Government you will not be al-
lowed to take any spirits, or strong drinks with you,
and my advice is, sign the pledge before you go. It
is the custom in Australia to drink tea instead of ale,
but unfortunately, former bad habits return and bring
ruin there as well as here. Many a fine young fellow
is there brought to the grave, by the old enemy.
Every one admits that the drinking customs of Eng-
land are a curse to her, and that we should be a thou*
sand times better off if we avioded strong drink.
Leave all these customs behind you ; on the passage
you will learn to do without the stimulants, and if you
wish to prosper in the new land never enter a grog
shop. I have tried total abstinance for nearly fifteen
years, in the heat of the tropics, as well as the winter
of Nova Scotia, and during hard Mork in Britain, and
never yet for a moment regreted it. Why should
you continue in a young country the habits which fill
our gaols and workhouses.
If you have any bad books, bum them before you go,
then they cannot hurt you, or any one else, but if you
leave them they may do damage when you are gone.
If you have any good and useful books, such as are
published by Chambers, Cassell, Weale, W, S. Orr,
and others, by all means take them. Don?t forget a
Bible, and some good books for Sunday reading.


Of any moderate sized tools you need for your
trade a good set should be taken, but do not spend
much money in expensive ones.
Carters going will do well to take good spring carts
with them. These articles are much wanted just now.
Freight will have to be paid, and in some cases they
may have difficulty in getting them taken, even then.
Enquire from the ship Agent or Owner.
Take copies of all your characters signed by the
persons who have given them, and countersigned by a
Minister or Magistrate.
Take as good a lot of clothes as you can possibly
get, the more the better. Strong and useful; never
mind fashion. Read again the Government in-
structions on this point, page 18. Beware of slop
garments, selling ?at a great sacrifice, or large lots
of things at a small price; go to respectable people,
and if you pay a little more for your things, you will
get quite the difference in worth. If going with per-
sons who can make clothes of any kind, take stuff to
use on the voyage, or if your own trade can be woiked
on ship-board, make provision for doing so.
Take care to provide something useful to do ; and
if you can play on any musical instrument, by all
means take it, and copies of a good many tunes with
you. Many a heavy hour will this help over. But
you must be very careful not to make yourself dis-
agreeable by playing too much. A little kind feeling
and watching your time, will make you a general
favourite, if you play decently, and if your lot be to go
far away to some lonely station, your instrument will
be a most pleasant companion.
Jf paying for your own passage you will need Beds.


Bedding, and Tinware; also a knife and fork each,
one table spoon, one tea spoon, one tin plate, one
drinking can, one tin quart, and pint pot, a keg or can
for holding water, some towels, and common and
marine soap.
A bed for shipboard is very different to a foreposter,
being more like a child?s crib mattrass; such a one
may be bought for a few shillings.
You will need at least two boxes; into one put all
that you will not want on the voyage, and put into
the other all that you will be likely to require.
All packages of Baggage to be marked with the
name of the passenger and also the words? Wanted
on the voyage ,? or ? Not wanted on the voyage," with
the cabin to which they belong; and must be at the
dock, ready for shipment, at least two days prior to
sailing, Packages wanted on -the voyage for use
must not exceed, for each Adult passenger, one box
of the following dimensions, viz. 2 feet 6 inches in
length, 2 feet in breadth, and 1 foot 4 inches in depth,
in order that they may be placed below the berths.
Passengers must also provide themselves with small
bags, to contain sufficient linen for a month?s use, as
no package will be allowed about the decks, but will
be stowed where it can be got at once a month, or so
during the voyage. This does not apply exactly to
Government or Society vessels, their limits are made
known to their passengers.
A good supply of thread, needles, buttons, and small
wares should be part of your outfit.
In addition to the provisions supplied by the ships
it will add much to your comfort to take a few spices,
pickles, preserves, and some extra tea and coffee, or
cocoa.


If a canvas tent can be obtained, it may prove very
?nt not well to take goods; if you have a little
+ nnrp take full weight sovengns. or an order
(mtiie bank Australasia, the Union Bank of
. t nlia Gold is more profitable to take out now,

unless the passengers make themselves agreeable to
each other, all the rules in the world cannot make,
them comfortable. There are hundreds of ways in
which you may show yourself friendly, and your
own happiness will thrive best by taking great pains
to promote that of others. If you are a person with
the love of your Creator in your heart; if you hope to
be watched over and finally saved by the merciful
Redeemer, never attempt to hide the fact, rather try
by His help to' bring others to a like mind. But
on no account make a display of your piety as if you
thought yourself better than other people. Be as
cheerful and pleasant as possible and very slow to
take offence. If any of you have not been in the
habit of thinking hopefully and reverently of your
Maker, I beg you take a copy of the New Testament
and read how He has loved our race and how willing
He is to welcome all to His favour, even to the
extent of sending His Son into the world to redeem
man from his misery.


Chapter V.
WHAT' TO DO WHEN THERE.
John Speers, the Gardener, and some others
who are going, have been very busy making
ready. Some one has asked them what they
mean to do in a new place where they know no
body ; with this difficulty they come again to
Mr. Freeman who has been thinking over the
very same thing.
John Speers ?We have another question, if you
please Sir What is best to he done when we get there .
P Mr F- Look before you leap John, eh? Many a
man has sailed in a brave ship hut never reached
the port, a little want of skill by the officers a little
flaw in the timbers, or many other things not thong
of on shore, may send a ship to the bottom. is a
serious thing to go to sea. John but never that
God cares for all at sea as well as ashore. Th g
are changing so rapidly in Australia, that if I go
rohlnm particulars, I may very far mislead yom
There are some things pretty sure, however. Let us
mitvDOSG you reach safely* #
A day or two before landing get all your t imgs
clean, if you can, and in good order.
Now you are at the opposite side of the Earth to
Old England; Christmas comes at Midsummer,
and many other things are quite changed ; the
seasons, the winds, plants, birds, and so forth.


Before you go on shore, having learned all you
can about the colony on the voyage, make up your
mind to resist temptation : beware of the grog-shop.
Get your characters handy for showing if needs be.
You will soon find the Emigration Commissioners?
Agent, make yourself and your character known to
him, and ask his advice. Do not be in too great a
hurry to bind yourself to anything, but gather in
formation wherever possible. You will enquire par-
ticularly after your own trade, and most likely find
that such and such a master wants hands. It is
almost certain that before you can get on shore, em-
ployers will be seeking you on ship board. If such
be the case, seek the Commissioners or Society?s
Agent?s advice as to any offer made you; do not
refuse a good opportunity, but do not bind yourself
for a long term. If sent out by Government you may
remain on board free of expense for fourteen days.
Mrs, Chisholm?s Society provides tents for a few days
residence also. (See, ?How to go,?)
If you have any more money than you want to use,
Bank it at once, then it increases, while you sleep
and work. You possibly may not find what you want
in the town you arrive at, if so, it is folly to remain
in town where expenses are heavy. Gain some little
knowledge of the country, put up a few things in a
blanket, strap them on your back and away with you.
If you have your family, they will be able to find some ?
thing to do while you are away, or you may join with
some one for mutual care. Do not be afraid of asking .
questions, but use your best discretion in believing
what you hear. Some are very anxious to buy a
parcel of land immediately. But it is not wise to do
so ; first get to know the country, which you may do


while receiving good pay for your work; then after a
while, you may think about being a landlord. The Go-
vernment price is Tl per acre. By the list of trades
given before, you will know which is most wanted,
and on arrival you may find a particular demand.
Your own trade is likely to be the best suited for you,
hut if it happen not to be so, try the trade you can
turn your hand to next best, and so on. If (which is
not in the least likely), none of the.se answer, you
will be sure of work as a shepherd or hut-keeper, but
neither of these afford much worth emigrating for
to a man who can pay his way in England. Very
likely if you come to this, your employer will pay
you in produce of the stock under your care, besides
rations ; if so you will soon by prudence and zeal
be watching your own property, and before long
you may be flock-master on your own account.
The life is not hard but lonely and not improving
to a man. Sheep-farming is not a certain business,
but is at times very profitable. An excellent plan in
this and other trades, if you have any money to invest,
is to work for some one engaged in the business,
and so soon as you feel your way sure, to offer to
add your funds to the concern. For instance, when
you have been watching sheep for a twelvemonth and
know something of the business, you might offer to
add a couple of hundreds, or thousands to the flock.
Perhaps you know too well what it is to seek work
at home; there the work seeks you. You don?t so
much need to ask where you may get a living, as
where you may do best for yourself.
You will soon learn all these matters on the spot.
Bethink you of all improvements in your trade,
try inventions, write home for seeds of plants


you do not find in the country, and thus open
new ways for profit. Wherever you may go, my
friends, remember that you are founding and settling
a new country, and that your habits and plans will
become the habits of the country. Strive to be
?a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that
do well.? If in the lonely sheep-run, or on the farm,
or in the town, never cease trying to improve your-
selves, to increase your knowledge, and be helpful and
kind to those about you. Above all never fail in
humble lowly trust in God through Cueist, make
Him your friend and counsellor. He is as near you
there as in Old England, and has again and again in
his Holy Word offered his favour to those who seek
him.
But my friends, you perceive I have not told one
of you to go to the diggings, I say do not go. Why ?
because if you find no gold, or very little, you will
spend more than you make and be far worse off than at
home. If you have great luck, ten to one, it will do
you harm?? easy won, easy lost,? perhaps you would
bring your dust or lumps to town, get cash, be
idle?then come bad companions, drink and ruin.
In the meantime the best situations for trade are
taken by other men, and you lose your chance.
Depend upon it, a good place, where by hardwork
you may soon become your own master and before
long, even wealthy, is far better than pockets full of
nuggets. Don?t go to the Diggings.
Education for your children should be an important
part of your calculations, and as your position im-
proves have a kindly feeling for youi new country,
be a Patriot, as well as a Christian, and your children
may be as proud of Australia as you are of the Land
you are about to leave.

? Approval Circular,? calling for the payment re-

homes before the receipt of this order.
The ? Approval Circular? informs the emigrant
that he has been accepted to send ; asks for the pay-
ment according to the rates mentioned before, and
tells him very plainly how lb send it.


The ? Embarkation Order - ? comes next, and tells
him all he needs to know about reaching the vessel.
After all, no ? Approval Circular? may come to you,
then you may set out again in quest of some other
mode of going. All this time you should have been
getting your clothes well mended up. Waste
nothing. If any of your friends have clothing suit-
able for you, to spare, do not be too proud to accept
help,
