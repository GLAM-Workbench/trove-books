HINTS ON GARDENING.
JANUARY.
The hot winds during this and next montli are very trying to vegetation, the sad effects of which my move particularly
noticeable in gardens where the soil has not been worked deep and mulching resorted to. Melons, pumpkins, encumbers, etc.,
require constant attention, the shoots pegged out, and the laterals stopped; a plot of well-manured ground should be prepared for
a planting of ashleaf kidney potatoes, for Autumn; sow red beet, cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, kidney and runner beans. 27m
Field —Ploughing and digging should be vigorously proceeded with. Swede and other turnips may be sown at the end of the
month, also maize and sorghum.
Flower Garden —Thin out annuals as required, take up all bulbs as the foliage withers, transplant annuals in the vacant
spaces in showery weather, plant out dahlias for late blooming, carefully stake all tall-growing plants and bulbs.
FEBRUARY.
Kitchen Garden. —No delay should be made in manuring and forking deeply all vacant spaces, in preparation for Autumn
and Winter supplies ; if the weather be favourable, cabbage and cauliflower plants may be set out at the end of the month ; sow
cabbage, cauliflower, broeoli, turnip, radish, lettuce, mustard, cress, silver and spinach heel : thi-t latter is not a fleeted by hot
weather, and, being an excellent substitute for spinach, no garden should be without it ; plant kidney potatoes in moist situations,
transplant celery, and make a final sowing of French and runner beans. The Field. —The plough should he continued in active
operation/ The soil will thus have the full benefit of the early rains ; sow turnip seed, Gape barley, rye, and hires, for preen teed.
Flamer Garden. —Thin out annuals, remove those past flowering, continue to take! up bulbs, keep borders free* from weeds
and decayed leaves.
MARCH.
Kitchen Garden. —Plant kidney potatoes, transplant cabbage, cauliflower, and celery, remove! side shoots, and earth up in
dry weather; on a rich border sow prickly spinach for winter use, and, in addition to .seeds recommended for February, a sowing of
carrot, parsnip, onion, and peas (an early dwarf kind), can be made for spring use. The Field. — Turnip sends, for n. main erop,
should be sown, and previous sowings kept carefully hoed ; for a succession of green feed, observe last month's direel ions.
Flower Garden.-—A few annuals may still be sown, to bloom in winter; anemone, narcissus, ranunculus, snowdrop, ami
crocus bulbs, may be planted at the end of this month.
ABRIL.
Kitchen Garden —Growing crops must now have careful attention, and the hoe kept constantly in use ; earth, up potatoes,
cabbages, cauliflowers, and celery; continue transplanting for succession; prepare a bonier for peas, sow endive, lettuce, onion,
radish, spinach, mustard, and cress. The Field — Land intended for laying down clovers and grasses should now he ca reful ly prepared
by harrowing and rolling ; a farther sowing of turnip seed, also grain, including black oats, to cut for green feed, earn he made.
Flower Garden —Sow largely of the hardy annuals, viz.: —Clarkias, collinsia, candytuft, larkspur. Hemophilia, stocks,
mignonette, (fee. ; with these, perennials, auricula, antirrhinum, aquilegia, campanula, delphinium, polyaiillius, pentslemon, sweet
William, wallflower, pansy, Ac. ; to the bulbs named last month add tulips, sparaxis, ixias, exalts, and trilelia ; bulbs remaining in
the ground should be taken up, and the beds well dug and manured.
MAY.
Kitchen Garden — For spring use plant early dwarf peas and broad beans, with potato-onions, garlic, and esehallols ; sow
seeds same as last month, pay timely attention to thinning and weeding all growing crops ; cut asparagus haulms before Ihe seed
ripens, fork the beds over, giving a dressing of well rotted manure with a sprinkling of salt ; prepare hoi beds for cucumber ami
melon seeds. The Field—Make a general sowing of grain for green feed, to which may lie added held-peas and horse-beans ; con-
tinue to sow grasses, clovers, lucerne, Ac.
Flower Garden—ln addition to the bulbs named in March and April, plant gladioli, hyacinths, frilillaria, nmskaria, lily of
the valley, snowflake, ornithogalum, Ac., as early as possible, in vacant places; sow animals to take off the nuked appearance and
enliven the borders during the winter and early spring months.
JUNE.
Kitchen Garden —On a warm dry border continue to sow carrot, parsnip, cabbage, spinach, radish, lettuce, leek, onion, peas
and broad beans, plant eschallots, garlic, and potato-onions, also a few kidney potatoes ; all laud from which the late crops ha\e been
taken should now be prepared by manuring and digging, for putting in the main crop, which should be commenced not. later than
next month ; a sowing of cauliflower seeds will be necessary to come in in November, later they cannot he depended upon. The
Field —Operations same as May.
Flower Garden —Thin out and transplant annuals, herbaceous plants and perennials, in all vacancies; plant gladioli,
amaryllis, Japan lily, tigridia, Ac.
JULY.
Kitchen Garden — If the weather is favourable and last month's directions attended to, the following can be sown for a main
crop, in light, loamy, or well-drained viz. Carrots, parsnips, lettuce, onions, leeks, broad beans, peas, cabbage, cauliflower,
Brussels sprouts, broeoli, spinach, and radish ; plant cucumber, melon and vegetable marrow seeds in pots or in beds prepared last
month, also potatoes (early kinds), artichokes, rhubarb, and asparagus. The Field —Operations as in June ; sow mangold wurze] at
the end of - the month.
Flower Garden —Keep previous sowings thinned out, and transplant if required; continue to set out herbaceous plants,
flowering shrubs, bulbs, Ac.
AUGUST.
Kitchen Garden — Success, in growing vegetables on light sandy soil principally depends on having the seeds sown early ; no
fame should, therefore, be lost in having this done wherever the lauds are workable; but it will be better to delay a little if the soil
be stiff, clayey, or too moist; to last month’s list of sowing add red and silver beet, salsify, scorzonera, mustard, and cress; roots as


last month. The Field —On prepared land sow grasses, clovers, lucerne, trefoils, carrots, parsnips, mangold; plant field peas and
beans, maize, sorghum, and potatoes.
Flower Garden —Sow the hardier kinds of annuals at the end of the month, finish planting the autumn flowering bulbs,
and transplant perennials.

marrow plants, Ac.; in a warm border make a first sowing of French and runner beans, and continue to sow for a succession all
other kinds of vegetables as required ; plant out cabbage, cauliflower, and potatoes, thin out and hoe all growing crops. The Field
down grasses and clovers should be completed this month ; carrot, chicory, mangold, parsnip, tobacco, and other seeds as
in August; plant potatoes for main crop.
Flower Garden —Sow annuals, thin out previous sowings, the less hardy kinds, cockscomb, balsams, zinnias, <fce., can be sown
at the end of the month ; plant dahlias, gladioli, tuberoses, liliums, Ac.
OCTOBER.
Kitchen Garden —A busy month this ; the rapid growth of weeds will necessitate the constant use of the hoe ; keep the
earth well stirred between the rows of young growing crops, thinning out, earthing up, and staking where necessary ; plant broad
beans and peas, where protected from the hot winds; in open border sow capsicum, celery, cucumber, melons, Ac.; plant out previous
sowings from frames, also potatoes, French and runner beans, sow tomato, spinach, leek, lettuce, cress, mustard, radish, turnip, and
parsley. The Field —Carrot, parsnip, chicory, tobacco, turnip, and mangold seeds are still to be sown; also maize, sorghum, and
potatoes, and if the w'eather be favourable grasses and clovers.
Flower Garden. —Sow largely of hardy and tender annuals, thin out former sowing, giving the plants left sufficient space to
develop themselves, whereby a larger number of blooms will be produced, stake and tie up where required; plant dahlias.
NOVEMBER.
Kitchen Garden. —Where previous month’s directions have been attended to, the garden should now present a neat and
cheerful appearance, with crops in various stages of growth; all spaces from which autumn crops have been removed should be
manured, forked over, and sown ; pumpkins, melons, cucumbers, &c., will require attention, the leading shoots stopped, and the
laterals pegged out; mulch during hot dry weather ; sow Brussels sprouts, savoy, brocoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, to plant out in
February; put out capsicum, cucumber, celery, Ac.; sow other vegetable seeds as last month. The Field. —Mangold, maize, and
sorghum, can still be sown; weeding and hoeing must be carefully attended to, else the growing crops will greatly suffer.

for a succession, planted out; fill up vacancies by transplanting annuals previously sown.
DECEMBER.
Kitchen Garden. —The hoe must be kept in constant use, to keep down weeds, and loosen the surface soil among growing
crops ; attention must be paid to melons, cucumbers, pumpkins, Ac.; the shoots well regulated and frequently pinched back; manure
and fork to a good depth all plots from which crops have been taken, as they will be required in February for planting cabbage,
cauliflower, turnip, Ac.; encourage the growth of rhubarb, by applying liquid manure, plant marrowfat peas, French and runner
beans, sow turnip, radish, mustard, cress, and lettuce seed, water if the weather be dry; and, towards the end of the month, sow
