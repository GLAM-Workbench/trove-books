PREFACE.
The Land Act 1898 virtually constitutes the last chapter in Victorian
legislation dealing with the settlement of the Crown lands of the colony.
The systems of land tenures have been liberalized and extended, and
increased facilities provided for selection and settlement. By the new
Act numerous privileges and advantages are conceded to settlers and
Crown tenants generally, and it is therefore desirable that information
as to the leading provisions of the Land Acts should be placed before
the public in as concise a form as is consistent with clearness.
The Land Act 1898, with the exception of some few provisions relating
to present pastoral and grazing lessees, comes into operation on the Ist
July, 1899, and it may be anticipated that under its provisions the
remaining Crown lands of the colony will be rapidly settled upon.
The new and liberal tenures under licence and lease and perpetual
lease of agricultural and grazing allotments, together with the classifi-
cation of the Crown lands, constitute a special feature of the Land Act
1898.
The mallee country has been specially legislated for in the Malice
Lands Act 1896 and in the Land Act 1898.
A new departure in Victorian land legislation is embodied in Part
111. of the Land Act 1898, the provisions of which enable the Crown
to acquire from private owners rich agricultural land for the purpose
of subdivision into farms on which a valuable body of yeomanry
will, doubtless, be established.
This publication, with which is presented a general map of Victoria
showing the counties, townships, and railway routes, does not aim at
including all the provisions of the various existing Land Acts, but the
marginal notes will afford ready reference to the Acts or sections
thereof when fuller or more detailed information is sought.
R. W. BEST,
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey.
21st March, 1899.

LAND ACT 1898 AND OTHER ACTS
IN FORCE.
The law relating to the Crown lands of Victoria is contained prin-
cipally in The Land Act 1869, the Land Act 1890, the Land Act 1891,
the Settlement on Lands Act 1893, the Mallee Lands Act 1896, and the
Land Act 1898, there being several amending Acts of minor importance.
The Land Act 1869 is inoperative as to future selections, but a large
number of selectors thereunder have by the Land Act 1898 been granted
certain concessions as to payment of arrears of rent, and are given the
option of converting their present leases into perpetual leases, and of
surrendering part of and obtaining new leases under former terms for
balance of their holdings. Beyond this the selectors of the 1869 Act
are not materially affected by any legislation embodied in the subsequent
Land Acts. The Land Act 1890 effected a consolidation of The Mallee
Pastoral Leases Act 1883 and The Land Act 1884. The Mallee Act 1896
permitted selection of agricultural holdings under licence or perpetual
lease in the mallee country where, hitherto, selection had only been pro-
vided for in a tentative measure under which a limited number of
licences were issued. Under The Land Act 1884 (now embodied in the
?Land Act 1890) the numerous and well-known 42nd section agricultural
licences were issued as well as the 32nd section grazing leases expiring
on the 29th December last, but extended for twelve months by the
Land Act 1898.
ADMINISTRATION.
For the purposes of administration the colony is divided into districts,
which are merely arbitrary divisions, and in each of which there
are land offices under the management of land officers. The land
officers, as often as occasion requires, hold land boards to deal with
applications for, and other matters relating to, Crown lands. There
are land offices at the undermentioned places :
Ararat Hamilton
Alexandra Horsham
Ballarat Melbourne
Bendigo Omeo
Bairnsdale Sale
Benalla Stawell
Beeohworth St. Arnaud
Castlemaine Seymour
Geelong Warracknabeal.
CLASSIFICATION OF CROWN LANDS
The whole of the unalienated lands belonging to the Crown are Section 9, Land
divided into the following classes ; Act 1898 -
1. Good agricultural or grazing land.
2. Agricultural and grazing lands.
3. Grazing lands.
4. Pastoral lands (large areas).
5. Swamp or reclaimed lands.
6. Lands which may be sold by auction (not including swamp
or reclaimed lands).
7. Auriferous lands.
8. State forest reserves.
9. Timber reserves.
10. Water reserves.


The Governor in Council has power to increase or diminish the
area of land comprised in any class except increasing lands which may
be sold by auction.
POWER TO ALTER PRESENT CLASSIFICATION.
If any land in the first, second, or third class is too highly classed,
or if any land in the second, third, or fourth class is not classed in a
sufficiently high class, its proper classification will be determined by a
Land Classification Board or by the Governor in Council. No altera-
tion can, however, be made in the classification of any land after any
application to select such land has been granted.
Section 9,
Act 1898.
LAND CLASSIFICATION BOARD.
Section 8,
Act 1898.
For the purpose of classifying Crown lands there will be constituted
one or more Land Classification Boards. Each board will consist of
three (3) members, who will be officers of the Crown Lands Depart-
ment or other competent persons.
HOW CROWN LANDS MAY BE ACQUIRED
Crown lands available for disposal may be acquired under the
following systems :
1. Pastoral lease.
2. Agricultural licence and lease.
3. Grazing allotment licence and lease.
4. Grazing area lease.
5. Perpetual lease (agricultural, grazing, and swamp or reclaimed
allotments).
6. Sale by auction.
7. Lease for 21 years (swamp or reclaimed lands).
8. Conditional purchase lease (repurchased, and swamp or re-
claimed lands).
9. Residenceorcultivation licence up to 20acres (auriferous lands).
10. Grazing licence (auriferous lands).
11. Grazing licence (non-auriferous lauds).
12. Licence or lease for garden, business sites, &c.
13. Mallee block lease-.
14. Mallee allotment lease
15. Mallee agricultural allotment, licence and lease.
16. Mallee agricultural allotment, perpetual lease.
17. Mallee improvement lease (100 acres).
18. Village community allotment.
WHO MAY SELECT.
Any person, who is of the age of eighteen years, maj r select a
grazing area under lease, or an agricultural allotment or a grazing allot-
ment under licence or perpetual lease, or a mallee agricultural allot-
ment under licence or perpetual lease. All legal disabilities attaching
to married women selecting have been entirely removed by the Land
Act 1898.
AREA OF LAND THAT MAY BE SELECTED.
Subject to certain reservations till 29th December, 1899, in favour
of existing pastoral and grazing lessees, no person can hold under
agricultural licence more than 200 acres of first-class land, or 320


acres of second-class land, nor, under grazing allotment licence, more
than 640 acres of third-class land. No future grazing area lessee can,
including any land already selected or taken up and held by him, take
up more than 200 acres of first-class land, or 640 acres of second-class
land, or 1,280 acres of third-class land. No person can, including any
land in the mallee formerly selected by him, select a mallee agricultural
allotment of more than 640 acres of first-class land or 1,000 acres of
second-class land.
In calculating the quantity of land any person may select as an agri-
cultural or grazing allotment, an area of 200 acres of first-class, or 320
acres of second-class, or 640 acres of third-class land will be regarded
as equivalent except in the mallee country, where 640 acres of first-class
land will count as equal to 1,000 acres of second-class land.
FORMER SELECTORS.
In determining the area of land any person may select or take up as Section n, Land
an agricultural or grazing allotmenl or grazing area under the Land Act cflB9B ?
1898, any land previously selected by him will be regarded as equal to
third-class land irrespective of its quality. This does not apply in the
mallee where, if a selector desires to take up more than 640 acres,
including any land formerly selected by him in the mallee, the classifi-
cation of such laud must be ascertained.
PASTORAL LANDS.
Terms op Original Leases.
Under the Land Acts 1884, 1890, and 1891 leases of areas from
7,500 acres to 40,000 acres were issued expiring on the 29th December,
1898. The rent was based on the grazing capacity of the land at the
rate of Is. per head of sheep and os. per head of cattle. On the
expiration of the term of lease, the lessee will be entitled to payment
from the incoming tenant for certain improvements not exceeding in
value 2s. 6d. per acre of such land.
Present Occupiers.
Current Leasts extended for One Year.
The existing leases at passing of the Land Act 1898 are extended for section u,
a year, and therefore expire on the 29th December, 1899, but the Land Act 1898 -
lessee may, if he so desire, surrender such extension.
Right of Lessee to select Homestead.
The lessee has the right to apply before 29th December, 1899, to section 15,
select a homestead out of his leasehold (if he has not already selected Land Act 1898,
thereout) up to 640 acres of land not superior to third-class land, on pay-
ment of 10s. per acre. If, however, he has taken a homestead out of his
leasehold he may apply for the difference between the area previously
selected and 640 acres; but if the area applied for exceeds 320 acres,
the application will be referred to a Land Classification Board, for
inquiry into the proper classification of the land, and the Governor in
Council may grant such application. The previous homestead selection


will be regarded as third-class lahd. The right contained in the
existing lease to select a homestead of 320 acres (first or second class
land) is not curtailed.
Section 15, sub-
sec. (5), Land
Act 1898.
Renewals to Present Lessees.
Any pastoral lessee at the passing of the Land Act 1898 is entitled
to apply at any time before the 29th December, 1899, for a further lease
of his allotment, Governor in Council may grant the applica-
tion. Such lease can be granted without the land being made
generally available, and will issue subject to the provisions of previous
Land Acts as amended by the Land Act 1898. No person will be allowed
to hold more than one such lease. The annual rental will be fixed by
appraisement, and all improvements, save those provided for in the
Land Acts, will revert to the Crown on the expiry of the term. Out
of such new lease, the area that may be selected as a homestead
will be limited to 200 acres first-class, or 320 acres second-class, or
640 acres third-class, less any previous homestead selections. The
purchase money per acre will be �1 first-class, 15s. second-class, and
10s. third-class.
Section 17,
Land Act 1898.
Sections 20 and
21, Land Act
1898.
Future Occupiers.
New leases will be for a term expiring on the 29th December,
1909, and will be granted to the first person lodging an application
after public notice has been given that the land is available. Should
more than one application be lodged on any one day before the hour of
2 o?clock in the afternoon, the right to a lease of such allotment will
be offered for sale by public auction, after at least one month?s notice
in the Government Gazette , and the highest bidder by way of premium
will, on payment of same, be entitled to the lease.
Should there be no bidder the land will again be made available.
The minimum area is 1,280 acres, and the maximum area 40,000 acres.

AURIFEROUS LANDS.
RESIDENCE OR CULTIVATION LICENCES.
The division of the Land Act 1898 relating to auriferous lands
amends in several respects section 65 and section 67 (as re-enacted in
the Land Act 1891) of the Land Act 1890, under which licences will
still continue to be issued.
Annual licences (section 65) are issued for auriferous lands not ex- | e a �j^�j 5, 1g90
ceeding 20 acres, which entitle the holders thereof to reside on or culti-
vate the land on payment of an annual licence-fee at the rate of Is. per
acre ; provided, however, that where the area is under 10 acres but over
3 acres there is charged an uniform annual licence-fee of 10s.; and
where the area is 3 acres or under, an uniform annual licence-fee of ss.
In addition to the annual licence-fee a charge of 2s. 6d. is made for
the annual licence itself. No person can hold more than one licence.
Briefly, the licence is subject to the following conditions;? Right to
use of surface of land only ; licensee not to assign or sublet without
permission of Minister ; licensee either to reside on or fence the land
within four months from date of licence and cultivate one-fifth of the
area; save as to any portion occupied by buildings, miners to have free
access to any part of the licensed land without making compensation to
the licensee for surface or other damage ; and notices to be posted by the
licensee on the land indicating that it is auriferous.
By section 90 of the Land Act 1898 any holder of a licence under Section so,
section 65 of the Land Act 1890, when he deems he has paid rents equal Land Act ls9B '
to the value of the land, may apply to have the value thereof appraised,
and provided such value has been paid, the annual licence-fee will be
reduced to 2s. 6d., and the annual licence will be issued free of charge.
Section 65 confers no right to the fee-simple.
Applications, how made.
Every applicant for a licence under section 65 must affix to a post
or other conspicuous object, at or near each corner of the allotment
applied for, a legible notice in writing, setting forth that he is an appli-
cant for such allotment, the approximate area thereof, his name and
address, and date of his thus marking out the land, and must make appli-
cation in the form prescribed obtainable at the head office or any land
office, the application-fee being �l. The application will be dealt with
by a local Land Board, before which the applicant must appear in
person, or to which, if he is the only applicant, he may, instead, forward
a statement on form prescribed, and obtainable at the head office or any
laud office. Transfers, provided conditions of licence have been com-
plied with, are allowed to eligible transferees, fee for transfer being 10s.

and section 91,
Land Act 1898.


more than 1,000 acres), at a rent to be fixed by appraisement.
The licensee may, with the consent of the Minister of Mines, enclose
the whole or any specified part of his holding with a fence which may
be removed by him upon or at any time before the expiration of his
licence, but such fence must be removed, without compensation, by the
licensee whenever so ordered in writing by the Board, failing which the
fence becomes the property of the Crown, and may be removed at the
cost and expense of the licensee. Free access to such area must be
allowed at all times to miners and other persons specially licensed to
enter thereon ; the ring-barking of the timber on the land by the licensee
is expressly forbidden ; and the licensee will be subject to a penalty
(not exceeding �2O) if he fails to place upon the outside of the corner
posts of the fence (if any) enclosing such land such distinguishing
marks as may be prescribed. The licence is subject to other conditions
relating to transfers, resumption for public purposes, &c., and the land
so licensed may be rated under the Local Government Acts on the
annual rental thereof.
Section 91,
Land Act 1898.
Applications, how made.

centum), but where in the opinion of the Board it is undesirable that
the residue of the price of any land should be paid for by instalments
extending over twenty years, such residue may be made payable in any
number of half-yearly instalments less than 40. Stringent provisions
are contained in the Act prohibiting agreements preventing fair com-
petition at auction sales.

MALLEE LANDS.
Position of Mallee Country.
The territory known generally as the ? Mallee ? is situated in the
north-western district of Victoria, and comprises an area of about
10,000,000 acres. The mallee land bordering on the plain country is
mostly of a light chocolate and sandy loam character, and, in its natural
slate, is covered with mallee scrub interspersed with plains lightly tim-
bered with box, oak, and pines. The scrub can be cleared at a moderate
expenditure, and the land is well adapted for wheat-growing. The
smaller areas are known as ? Mallee allotments,? and the larger areas,
further north, and where the soil is more sandy in character,
as ? Mallee blocks.? The ? blocks ? are practically in their natural
state, are many square miles in extent, and are used for pastoral
purposes only.
Mallee Blocks.
Existing Leases.
Mallee block leases are for pastoral purposes, and are issued tenable Sections 147,
to the 30th November, 1903. The yearly rental is calculated on the im
number of sheep and cattle depasturing on the land, on the basis of
2d. per head of sheep, and Is. per head of cattle for the first five years
of lease, and 4d. per head of sheep, and 2s. per head of cattle for the
second five years, and thereafter 6d. is charged per head for sheep, and
3s. per head for cattle. The minimum rental in no case, however.
can be less than 2s. 6d. per square mile.
Every transfer of a mallee block lease must be approved by the section iso,
Governor in Council, and registered by the Board of Land and Works, Land Act 1890 -
no transfer to have any effect or operation unless so registered.
Annual Pent ?Returns required.
With regard to all mallee block leases issued prior to the 20th section 172,
February, 1896, for the purpose of ascertaining the rent, the lessee is Land Act 1890 '
required to furnish twice in each year, on the 21st June and the 21st
December, a return called ? Sheep and Cattle Bent Return,? giving the
actual number of sheep and cattle depasturing on the ? block ? on the
first day of the following months :?February, April, June, August,
Obtdte, and December, with the average for each half-year, and like-
wise another return called ? Travelling Stock Return,? giving the
number of sheep and cattle the property of the lessee travelling over
Crown land during each half-year, and on the first day of each of the
months mentioned above.
The minimum rental of 2s. 6d. per square mile is charged where the Section iei,
rent calculated on the stock returns is below that amount. There are LandAulbo �-
, ~. top . 1 ? p 1 , Section 179,
heavy penalties imposed tor furnishing false returns. Land Act im.
New Leases?Mallee Blocks.
New leases issued after the 20th February, 1896, come under the Section 4,
provisions of section 4 of the Mallee Lands Act 1896, and the rent ?fet isac.?
for the blocks will be fixed at a price to be determined by the Board of
Land and Works ; otherwise the conditions are the same as those of the
old leases. Any blocks reverting to the Crown are offered for sale
by auction, and should there be no bidder the land is made available for
873. C

Wo. c than one application before two o?clock on the same day the right to

highest bidder, by way of premium, secures the lease.
When a ?block? remains available, and only one application is
received, the lease is prepared on payment of lease fee, half-yearly rent,
survey fee, and improvements (if any), and no reference to Land Board
is necessary.

expired, be subsequently taken up in any manner, the value of the
improvements thereon, if not paid within one month, may be made
payable in half-yearly instalments, with 4 per cent, per annum, ex-
tending over the whole or part of the first six years of the licence
or lease.
S? JfiB9o Tlle conditiolls of lease are tlle same as those of the Mallee allot-
ment lease.
Mallee Allotments.
Situation , and how originally occupied.
fhe ?Mallee allotments ? are situated on the southern and eastern
fringe of the mallee territory, the country further inland and running
northerly to the Murray River being known as ? Mallee blocks.?
At the time of the passing of the original Act in 1883, it was con-
cluded that the land would be used for grazing only, the scrub being
somewhat difficult to get rid of, but the invention of the stump-jump
plough, and the use of a heavy roller to break down the scrub, enable
the settler to turn the land to better account. With these appliances
the land can be cleared at a cost of a few shillings per acre, and pro-
fitably used for the cultivation of wheat and other cereals. An uniform
rental of Id. per acre per annum is now charged as from the Ist July,
1897, in all cases where the Board?s consent has been obtained to clear
and cultivate.
Conditions of Mallee Allotment Leases.
Section is? The conditions briefly are as follow :
Land Act 1890. ~, , f , ? , .
1. do pay rent half-yearly in advance.
2. Not to assign, subdivide, sublet, or cultivate without the
consent of the Board.
3. To destroy vermin (rabbits, &e.).
4: To keep improvements in repair.
5. Lease voidable for any breach of or non-compliance with the
covenants.

under sections 97 and 99 Land Act 1890 (excepting the site
of the homestead), subject to payment for improvements.
7. Licences may be granted to enter on allotment to obtain
timber, stone, earth, &c.
8. Laud may be resumed for mining on payment for improvements.
9. Other lessees may cross allotment to get to public road or

of the land, will be laid before Parliament. If the Legislative
Assembly by resolution declares that it is expedient to acquire such
land, the Minister will introduce a Bill into the Legislative Assembly
to sanction the acquisition of such land, upon the passing whereof by
Parliament, the authorization of the acquisition of such land will
become absolute.
HOW PAID FOR.
All land acquired by the Board will, at the option of the vendor, be
paid for in Victorian Government 3 per cent, stock, or in money the
proceeds of the sale of any such stock.

ments will be so fixed as to cover cost of original purchase, cost of

principal, acquire the fee-simple of his farm allotment.


INSTALMENTS IN ARREARS. ?FORFEITURE.
Upon the breach of any condition, the conditional purchase lease is
liable to forfeiture, but forfeiture for non-payment of any instalment
may be prevented by payment thereof, with an additional sum equal
to 5 per cent, of such instalment within three months of the due date
thereof, or 10 per cent, of such amount within six months of such date;

Crown Solicitor will take such steps as may be necessary to enforce
payment thereof.
