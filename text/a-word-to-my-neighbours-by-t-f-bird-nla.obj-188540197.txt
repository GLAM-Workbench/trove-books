A WORD TO MY NEIGHBOURS.
THE
REV. T. F. BIRD,
(Pastor of Oxford-st. Church.)
L£L|C.,CJ'* CAMS
My dear Friends, 00 *
Providence has made meyoiir neighbour and I wish to he neighbourly.
The creed that I hold is that every member of a community has a
relation to every other member of the community; that there are nerves
of a common interest quivering in all our hearts, and chains of common
facts and possibilities linking our lives together. Your joys and sorrows
affect me, and my words and actions affect you unconsciously, even though
we never see each other. One great electric wire goes through the world,
taking a coil round each individual, so that we are perforce in the circuit
of universal news and needs, and must take our chance of shocks. Our
physical, and mental, and moral locks are all made on one principle, though
the patterns may vary, and one common key will open and shut us all.
The practical inference from such a creed is that we should all interest
ourselves in each other. That if God has put a well of refreshing
water in every heart, the owner of the heart and of the well should
always be ready to pump it out for the reviving of the thirsty and the
faint, and use it freely in laying the moral dust of the streets, even
though he does not live in them, and in quenching the fires that break
out in other people’s property. The deduction may be put in a word:
If nature has stocked us with sympathetic pulses we ought to stock life
with sympathetic deeds. The creed is a beautiful one, and the deduc-
tion is fair; but practical expositions of it are exceedingly scarce. We
only know of one who perfectly turned this creed into action, and lived
this noble faith before the world, and he was a Jew called Jesus who lived
so many centuries ago that the history of Him has grown rather dim.
His creed, however, lives yet, but, while still considered beautiful, is not
so much acted on as it might be.
It is this creed that I hold, and it is by way of attempting however
feebly to fulfil fts demands'that lam addressing myself to you. In your
common human experiences I have a part; and in your joys and sorrows
I may claim a share. lam anxious moreover to contribute, if possible,
to the stock of earnest and reverent thinking and pure and tender feeling
that are the richest treasures of any character and any household, I


would fain speak words to you that are suggestions of comfort and hints
of help; that may make your burdens lighter and bring wise uses out of
woe. Good intentions; pure unselfish purposes; the will to be and do
right rises within us all at times, and we become conscious that noble
character and noble work are possible to us. But somehow these gleams
of dawn-light do not brighten into day, but die back into night again.
On the wave of some sweet influence we are lifted, and feel a lightness
and vigor that we think will stay. But the wave ebbs, and we are left
morally helpless. Ckhe shadow that we all fear, and would all fly from
if we could, our homes; and in the darkness that weighs upon
the heart an unseen hand plucks up by the roots a living plant that drew
its sap and substance from us; and in the wrench of Death we are torn,
and go sadly through the days and months beyond. But the wounds close,
and the heart heals its hurt, and life grows hard and faithless as before.
Though prostrated by a stunning grief we regain our feet, and walk self-
trustingly and run wildly as before. lam anxious to come in, or rathei
to bring in some cheering Gospel message to you, just where sorrow
touches you, and loss is making you thoughtful; to enter in at these
times of solemn purpose and add a stimulus to your good intentions, and
help you to trample on your weaknesses and gain firmness and strength.
I desire in this paper to say two things to you. That we as moral
beings are conscious of one chief want, and that the Gospel meets this want.
What is the one thing we all most deeply want?—a want unspoken or
half-spoken, but real to consciousness and constant as Time; a want
that pulsates in every cell-like moment of the years? “To beloved,
some of the young will say; the heart wants a mate, and, finding its mate,
the life finds its heaven. This is perhaps the purest juvenile conception
of life, and it is impossible not to sympathize with it. The affections are
born explorers, and naturally seek out rich and pleasant settlements; and
the young regard humanity as made up of a collection of half-lives that
must match and become one with the utmost possible dispatch. Yet they
find after settlement in this juvenile land of promise, that there is yet a
want. “To be thought well of,” may be the notion of others, and in this
there is a root of goodness, a germ of moral health. The ambition to be
thought well of acts both as a stimulus and a guard. Having this aim
meanness, uncharity, wrong-doing are well-nigh impossible to us because
they are frowned upon, and we seek and do truth and purity because they
win us smiles and favours. But the truly honest conscience feels that
there are nobler motives than these for acting rightly; that there are
better tests of truth; and that praise is not proof. Moreover, the happy
victim of human approbation is never satisfied unless he appiove himsel .
“To be rich,” some of you say is the chief want of man. Money is the
main virtue. Alas, there is room for the satire, and even for some bitter-
ness in using it. As the cares and claims of a family press upon us, and
the two ends of the domestic management will barely meed, we gradually
eome to regard money as almost “the one thing needful. As the lich
become richer, the poor become relatively poorer, and the contrast is
more marked and the breach is widened between the classes. And as money


is an ever pressing want, and the burdens that wear our life out could be
relieved by it, we come to think that wealth is the same thing as happi-
ness. But there are better things than riches; and there are deeper
sterner wants than riches can remove; and one especially that would
haunt you even if you had a scoi'e or two of shares in the Great Extended
Hustler’s Company.
No, not one of these is the main want of us all. To control ourselves
—that is the want which underlies all moral difficulties and all sins; in
this lie our common weakness and common danger; 1 & / this want
spring the sad abuse of love and the dishonesty of “ vaixWmows;” it is
in this foundry that the iron fetters which make poverty hateful are cast,
it is this want that burnishes wealth into such fascinating brightness; it
is this Avant that takes the moral backbone, the column of uprightness,
out of our manhood; that teaches us to idle away the golden moments ; to
quarrel with facts; to go floundering headlong into bottomless moral bogs;
to covet, to steal, to kill. God help us !we all have this want more or
less. You feel it, —you to whom lam writing. In the wild pulse-
driven youth, in calmer manhood, in steady age, your mistakes and
failures and sins are the fruit of this want. You lack reins, or a firm
hand to hold the reins that dangle loosely beside you; you have no brake
for the Avheels that spin over the broken higlnvays, or your foot is asleep
or paralysed and cannot put it down; so Avhen the horses of passion bolt
Avith you, you are helpless, and the results are tragic. Self-control, that
is the spring of all power, and the guard of all purity in man. My friends,
lam not here to trouble you about beliefs or theories; but tell me truly,
are not your ways of living improvable ? Do not the defects in your
character, and the sin in your action arise mostly from your inability to
say “ No!” with sufficient firmness and at the right time ? That is about
the finest word, when well used, that a man can utter; though it is per-
haps even better that a man should make a “ No” by manly and irrevoc-
able deeds; and at least the “No,” to be a No, must be afterwards
shaped in life. To an unworthy aim, to a foul desire, to an unlawful
hope that vibrates from within, it is not always easy to telegraph back
promptly “ No!” To the genial appeal of a friend, to the jovial offer of
a comrade in cups, to the net-like smiles of a harlot, to the moral suction
of a crowd —the magnetic currents that draw us towards the centre of
every human whirlpool, how hard to say “ No!” For want of saying
“ No!” we all fail and sin grievously. God help you to say “ No!” when
sin in any form, from any point calls to you!
I said the Gospel meets this want that makes so huge a void in the
best part of our nature, —but how? Certainly not by putting an arti-
ficial backbone into us, and strengthening us up Avith moral stays of the
most approved pattern. A Gospel that converted man into a spiritual
pauper would be worth less than nothing. And a creature desiring to
be fed on manna and miracles, instead of growing and baking his own
bread by the nature’s JaAvs, has clearly lost all image of the
Creator, and belongs to a species, I trust, becoming rarer as the Avorld
groAvs older and wiser, though there are a few specimens left even yet.


Man does -not want to be shut up in a kind of moral Benevolent Asylum
and pampered by Providence with Gospel comforts, while all nature,
saving himself, is taxed for his support. The Gospel cannot meet man’s
needs by fencing him in. He wants not fences, but freedom, and will
have it either with or without the Gospel. Not to be controlled but to
be made self-controlling is man’s want. And the Gospel meets this
want by showing him how to do what no one can do for him. We have
an illustrated Gospel, illustrated not by pictures, but by life—a more
durable kind of engraving. The illustration is Christ. What the
Gospel says He does. His deeds utter and give shape to the truth.
Christ was self-control embodied. He yielded; He obeyed; He endured;
therefore He conquered. And we may win the secret from His life.
The secret is faith. “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
be saved.” The germ of moral greatness is submission, “He that
humbleth himself shall be exalted.” Obedience to God is the first and
last moral law. It is prophetic incipient purity; and purity in fact and
nature follows it. Self-control is a growth from obedience; it is the
enduring and progressive victory of faith.
My friends, if you wish to supply the want that aches within your
heart, and links you to all the rest of your morally-necessitous fellow-
creatures, begin low. The tall church spires that pierce the morning
mists above the city, and catch and herald the sunlight, began at the
ground. Those massive piles of masonry that front our river and line
our streets had their stones laid one by one, and laid on the earth. By
way of fulfilling this great want then, set this before you as the one aim:
Have respect to your conscience, and in that conscience obey God. God
counts you as His sons; pay filial honor to Him by obeying his commands.
Christ counts you as His brothers in labour, and love, and faith, in suffer-
ing and glory; pay honor to Him by accepting His relationship, and stock-
ing your mind with His principles, and living by His golden rule.
Reckon that you have no right save to do what God calls right; that
what is false is foul; that to say “Yes” in act, when conscience dictates
“No” is nothing less than moral self-destruction; that obedience is the
first principle of self-control; and that human nature completes, and per-
fects, and saves itself when it uses the proffered help of the Great Atoner
Christ, and acts by faith in unison with His self-sacrificing life. Should
will grow weak, and love seem spent, and faith be worn, and the
noble-statured .man of self-control, through base example or subtle
tempting, be ready to fall —look to Christ, think of Christ, pray the
Spirit of Christ into your failing hearts. “ Remember Him who endured
such contradiction of sinners against Himself, lest ye be wearied and
faint in your minds.”
