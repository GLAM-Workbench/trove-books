TO THE KING?S MOST EXCELLENT
We, the undersigned Members of Council,
gistrates, Landholders, Merchants, and
Free Inhabitants of the Col
Wales, beg leave to approach *4 our Majesty
with feelings of ardent loyalty and of unfeigned at-
tachment towards Your Majesty?s Royal Person
and Government; assured that even in this remo-
test settlement of the Empire, we, Your Majesty's
most dutiful subjects, shall not fail to participate
in the benefits of Your Majesty?s paternal
Entertaining such sentiments, and cherishing
such hopes, we beg to represent to Your Ma-
jesty, that the Colony of New South Wales, which
was originally established for the coercion and re-
formation of British convicts, in tl e year 1788,
has during the last seventeen years become the re-
sort of numerous free emigrants of all classes of
society from Great Britain and Ireland ; through
whose industry, enterprise and perseverance, con-
joined with those of the reputable portion of the
class of emancipated convicts throughout the
Territory, it has been gradually transformed from
a mere penal settlement into a flourishing Co-
lony, and has already attained a degree of pros-
perity altogether unexampled in the history of all
the other Colonies of the Empire.
We beg leave, moreover, most humbly to repre-
sent to Your Majesty, that it is our deliberate
opinion and conviction, that the form of Govern-
ment, which His late Majesty was pleased to
establish in this Colony, in the year 1825, when
a Legislative Council was appointed to assist
and co-operate with His Excellency the Governor,
is now no longer suited to the wants of the Co-
lony ; and that the colony has at length reached
such astateofadvancement as to render a Repre-
sentative Legislature highly desirable for the de-
velopement of its vast resources, and for the fur-
therance of the best interests of its rapidly in-
creasing population.
We beg, therefore, most respectfully to solicit,
that Your Majesty will be grievously pleased to
take the case of this flourishing Dependency into
Your Majesty?s consideration, and to authorise
the appointment of a Representative Legislature,
to assist and to co-operate with His Excellency
the Governor, in the future administration of its
affairs. And, as in duty bound, we, Your Ma-
jesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects, will ever
pray for Your Majesty's Royal Person,
Sydney, New South Wales,

UNTO THE HONOURABLE, THE COM-
MONS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND
IRELAND, IN PARLIAMENT AS-
SEMBLED.
The Petition of the undersigned Members of
Council, Magistrates, Landholders, Merchants,
and other free Inhabitants, of His Majesty?s
Colony of New South Wales?
Humbly Sheweth ;
That the Colony of New South Wales was estab-
lished by His Majesty?s Government, in the year
1788, for the safe custody, the punishment, and
the reformation, of transported felons.
That the said colony continued to retain the
character of a strirfly yeral settlement for thirty
years after its original establishment, or until the
year 1818; the number of families and indivi-
duals who arrived in New South Wales as free
emigrants, prior to that period, being compa-
ratively small, and the progress of the colony in
agriculture, in arts, in commerce and especially
in morals, being exceedingly slow, and being
also greatly retarded by circumstances and events
arising out of its penal character.
That since the year 1818, or during the last
seventeen years, a very large number of families
and individuals have arrived in the colony, as
free emigrants, and settled, as land and stock-
holders, merchants, mechanics, and labourers, in
all parts of the Territory; and that in consequence
of the virtuous principles, the industrious habits,
the enterprise, and the capital that have thul
been imported into the colony, to develops itï¿½
vast resources and to turn its available convict-
labour to the best account, it has now assumed
a totally different aspect from th >t of a mere
penal settlement, while its progress as a British
Colony has far exceeded all precedent or anti-
cipation .
That the population of the colony amounts at
present La, seventy thousand souls or thereby;
of whom fifty thousand consist of free emigrants,
natives of the colony, and persons who have be-
come free by penal servitude, the remaining
twenty thousand being convicts.
That the imports of the colony?consisting
chiefly of goods of British produce and manu-
facture?for theyear 1834, amounted to 991,990/.,
and its exports ?consisting chiefly of fine wool
and sperm and black whale oil?to 587,640/.;
the Colonial Revenue for that period being
161,'960/. 14s. 4 \d, and the expenditure
I 114,208/. 14s. (id. ; and that during the period
of twelve months, previous to the first of July
1835, the sum received by the Government for
Crown-land purchased by the colonists, in ad-
dition to the ordinary revenue, amounted to
60,628/. 4s. 6 d.
That while your Memorialists would earnestly
solicit the attention of your Honourable House
to the highly favourable state of things which the
Colony of New South Wales thus exhibits, they
would beg leave to express their own opinion?
an opinion founded on long experience and
careful observation?that the progressive advance-
ment of this important dependency of the empire
would be greatly accelerated, and the number
of virtuous and industrious free immigrants from
the mother-country greatly increased, were your
Honourable House to grant the free inhabitants of
New South Wales a Representative Legislature,
for which, they humbly conceive that the present
state of the colony in regard to population, com-
merce, revenue, and general resources, will afford
a sufficient indication of their entire fitness.
That although a considerable number of the
free inhabitants of New South Wales consists of
persons, who, having arrived in the colony as
convicts, have obtained their freedom either by
free pardon or by penal servitude, your peti-
tioners are firmly persuaded, that it would prove
highly conducive to the good government and
the moral welfare and advancement of the colony
to extend the elective franchise to the reputable
portion of this class of the community; as per-
sons of this description are equally interested
with the other free inhabitants of the colony in
promoting good government and obedience to
the laws.
Trusting, therefore, that your Honourable
House will deem this important Dependency of
the Empire sufficiently advanced for a Repre-
sentative Legislature, and grant its free inha-
bitants so invaluable a boon,
Your Petitioners, as in duty bound.
will ever pray;
Sydney, July 30, 1835 Sic., Sic., &c.
