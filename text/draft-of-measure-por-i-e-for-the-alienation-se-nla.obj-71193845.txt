PREFATORY.
This Draft is intended merely to embody in a succinct form
suggestions which may possibly be of service to those engaged,
or who may be engaged, in the work of Land Law Amendment.
In the preparation of this Draft, and in the arrangement of its
Clauses, I did not avail myself of the aid of anything published
bearing on the Land Question ; so that, however defective it may
be, it is more likely to answer the object I have in view, viz.
supplying hints with reference to land legislation, than if I had
availed myself of the labours and suggestions of others.

DEAET OF MEASUEE
FOR THE
ALIENATION, SETTLEMENT, AND UTILIZATION
OF CROWN LANDS
IN THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES,
IN TEN CLAUSES.
WILLIAM F_ER,GrXJSSOISr REID.
Clause First. ?The Halves of Runs held under pastoral
lease and such reserved lands as the Government may deem it
expedient to resume shall be resumed for purposes of settlement
under this Act; and Crown lands resumed for purposes of settle-
ment shall bear the title of Purchaseable, Indefeasible Areas,
and all titles issued with respect to Conditional Purchases on
Indefeasible Areas aforesaid shall be good and valid in law and
in equity, anything to the contrary notwithstanding. The grazing-
rights of Pastoral Lessees with respect to resumed Halves of their
Runs shall continue merely pending their conditional purchase,
and shall cease with respect to any holding conditionally purchased
as soon as it be purchased or taken up.
Clause Second.? lndefeasible Areas aforesaid shall have
their boundaries strictly defined, and shall be sub-divided into
Pastoral Holdings and Agricultural Holdings, the former ranging-
in size by the addition of sections, or fractional parts of sections,
from one section or six hundred and forty acres to twenty
sections or twelve thousand eight hundred acres, the latter ranging-
in size from forty acres to three hundred and twenty acres, which
shall be the maximum of an Agricultural holding. Agricultural
Holdings shall comprise land fitted for tillage. All Holdings
shall be surveyed and numbered, and the boundaries of each shall
be set forth on maps and on the land prior to being offered to the
public, and the Survey with respect to the number and proportion
of Holdings in either class, of differing, given areas shall be subject
to the directions of the Minister for Lands. If the Holding be


Agricultural, the letter A with its registered number added, if
Pastoral, the letter P, with the registered number shall be placed
on pegs or on trees, posts or pillars, at the angles of its boundaries,
another face of which might bear the descriptive letter and the
number of an adjoining holding; and in stony country, the
descriptive letters A or P with the number might be placed on
rocks or embedded boulders, at the angles and upon the line
of boundary, so long as accuracy of position be maintained. The
boundaries of a Holding shall from the date of its being taken up
stand unaltered, and a mark shall be placed by the surveyor at each
angle of the boundary, and the line of boundary shall be a straight
line between mark and mark. It will be the duty of the Minister
for Lands, upon the application of the Conditional Purchaser and
payment by the latter of a fee of five guineas, to send a licensed
surveyor to walk over the boundaries, point out boundary marks
and direct where additional marks may be placed, the more
distinctly to set forth the boundary. Should a month elapse from
date of receipt of application and no surveyor appear, the purchaser
shall obtain, if he desire it, a refund of the fee, and he will be at
liberty to engage a surveyor to delineate his boundary, or he may
dispense with the services of one if he think proper. In the
survey of Holdings, surveyors shall survey and mark roads, and
shall so order their road surveys as that each Holding shall have
a frontage to a road permitting access, direct or through junction
with other roads, to a village, town, or railway station, and, if
possible to a water-course, dam, tank, well or lagoon. Surveyor?s
marks must be durable and legible. A Commonage of one hun-
dred acres, or thereabouts, shall be reserved for the use of the
Holders of every ten adjacent or adjoining conditional purchases,
and for other purposes, as the storage and Conservation of water,
recreation, and sites for public buildings. At the Metropolitan
Lands Office and at all Court Houses, maps of resumed lands
available for conditional purchase shall be accessible to the public,
and the registered number, acreage, and the boundaries of each
Holding shall be displayed thereon. As soon as a Holding is taken
up, the word ? Taken ? shall be written or stamped on the map,
inside the tracing of its boundaries, so that it may be easily seen
what lands are available and what lands have been taken up.
To add to facility of reference, resumed lands shall bear on maps
a distinct tinting. A hand-book shall be attached to each map of
resumed lands, which shall give their position and distance with
respect to the metropolis or to the nearest line of railway, or
navigable water, the position and distance of neighbouring towns,
description of soil, surface characteristics, and means of water


supply. To assist in the defrayal of survey expenses, the Minister
for Lands shall, after finding the average cost per acre for survey-
ing Holdings, which must he uniform with respect to all Holdings,
?charge the Conditional Purchaser half the average cost per acre
for each acre he holds, and this shall be payable in three equal
biennial instalments, co-incidently with payments of purchase
money while these continue, the first instalment to be paid in
January following the receipt of bill of survey charges. The
Minister for Lands may at his option make full payment of this
survey charge a pre-condition to the obtaining a title deed, and
may charge four per cent, interest on arrears of payment; and
may in the event of sale of right, title, and interest, deduct what
is due of this charge, with or without interest added, from the
gross proceeds of sale. The Conditional Purchaser shall have a
proprietary right to all minerals or materials of marketable value
in or on his holding, but he shall have no right to barter, or sell,
or donate, or remove these from his Holding, until he obtain his
title. After resumed lands have been subdivided into Holdings of
the areas specified and allowed, any remanets of Agricultural or
Pastoral Land below the minimum acreage in either class may be
sold by auction or may be added to adjoining holdings, provided
the maximum acreage in either class, Agricultural or Pastoral, be
not exceeded by such addition, or they may be erected into
separate Holdings at the discretion of the Minister for Lands.
Clause Third. ?The price of Agricultural Holdings shall be
two pounds sterling (�2) per acre, payable in eight instalments of
five shillings per acre. The first instalment shall be paid when
the Holding is taken up, and each following instalment shall be
paid in January of each ensuing year until payment is completed.
The price of Pastoral Holdings shall be one pound sterling (�1) per
acre, payable in eight instalments of two shillings and sixpence
per acre. The first instalment shall be paid when the Holding is
taken up, and each following instalment shall he paid in January of
each ensuing year till payment is completed. Payments shall be in
bank notes or in current coin, or in both, and shall be tendered at
the Metropolitan Lands Office or at the Court House nearest to the
Holding. Males twenty-one years of age or over, by birth or natural-
ization British subjects, are alone eligible to become Conditional Pur-
chasers. Conditional Purchasers shall not be at liberty to
mortgage their Holdings, or any improvement or growing crop
thereon, or their right, title, and interest thereto ; but they may
procure money advances on their goods, chattels, industrial
appliances, or on their stock or garnered produce. The purchaser


of an Agricultural Holding may, if he be disinclined to continue
the fulfilment of conditions, at the expiry of two years from date
of first payment of purchase money, and after giving one month?s
notice to the Minister for Lands, dispose of his right, title, and
interest to and in his Holding by auction or privately by an
auctioneer, provided one-fourth of the cultivation condition be
fulfilled. The privilege of sale of right, title and interest shall
be conceded at the expiry of four years from date of first purchase
payment, and after like notice, if one-half the cultivation condi-
tion be fulfilled ; or at the expiry of six years from date aforesaid,
after like notice, if three-fourths of the cultivation condition be
fulfilled. The Minister for Lands shall receive eight per cent, of
the gross proceeds of sale of right and title, and the purchaser of
the right and title shall have his name entered as Holder is lieu of
that of the previous Holder, and shall continue the fulfilment of
conditions.
Clause Fourth.? With respect to Agricultural Holdings,
improvement conditions shall be the fencing of the Holding with
a post and rail fence of two rails, or three rails, similar to post
and rail fencing ordinarily used in fencing paddocks, and suffi-
cient to bar the ingress or egress of horse stock or cattle stock ;
the fence to enclose the entire area taken up. Separate gate
entrances to the Holding shall not exceed three in number,
and they shall be placed in the line of fencing that fronts a road
or lane/ With the permission, however, of an adjoining Holder,
one of the three entrances may be placed in that section of
fencing that bounds his holding; but he may revoke permission
at any time and close such an entrance to his ground, and remove
the gate, style, or slip bars protecting it, if such be not removed
by the owner. Entrances must be protected by gates or slip-bars,
which present an elevation similar to that of the fencing. Where
the ground is stony or rocky, a stone wall may be substituted for
post and rail fencing ; but stone walling must not be less than
eighteen inches thick, and in its erection the use of mortar shall
be optional, and it must be in height similar to ordinary post and
rail fencing. Where timber for fencing is scarce, and can with
difficulty be procured, the Conditional Purchaser may substitute
fencing of wire iron, or sawn hardwood provided he submit
specifications of fencing proposed to be substituted to the Minister
for Lands or his Agent. The specifications submitted may include
combinations of the materials mentioned, as hardwood posts Avith
wires, or with rails and wires attached, or hardwood frame
covered by corrugated iron, boards, pickets or palings. Before


erecting fencing proposed to be substituted, the Conditional Pur-
chaser must await receipt of notice that it has been officially
approved, provided that upon knowledge of the fact that the
specifications sent have reached the Lands Office or the Agent to
whom they were addressed, and a month passes without receipt
of official notice of approval or disapproval, he will be free
to proceed with the fencing proposed to be substituted ; but he
must adhere strictly to specifications, and when differing sets of
specifications have been forwarded, he may adopt the set he
deems most suitable. The Minister for Lands or his Agent may
in notifying disapproval of fencing specifications, state what style
of substituted fencing would be approved, when the Holder may
adopt the approved style stated or revert to post and rail fencing.
The other improvement conditions with respect to Agricultural
Holdings shall be the clearing, including the taking out of stumps,
ploughing and cropping one-third of the area of each Holding with
cereals or root crops, or both ; but of the one-third of the area
mentioned, a fourth part of it may, at the option of the Holder,
bear vines, fruit trees, or artificial grasses, either or together.
Ground under cereals or root crops must be re-ploughed
and re-sown or re-planted at least every alternate year. With
respect to Pastoral Holdings, improvement conditions shall be the
fencing of them under like rules and conditions as the fencing of
Agricultural Holdings, and the erection on each Holding of a
dwelling not less than thirty feet in length, twenty feet in breadth,
with or without skillion, and with side walls and end walls, if
hip-roofed, not less than ten feet high, measuring from base to top
of wall-plate. If gabled, the apex of gables must be at least
sixteen feet from the ground. The dwelling shall have at least
two doors, two windows, glazed or with shutters only; partitions
dividing it into four rooms, and a chimney. Tire materials used
in its erection may be bush timber and bark, with slabs for walls,
partitions, and chimney, and bark for roofing, but nothing inferior
shall be allowed ; and the Holder may exceed to any extent the
dimensions specified, and may substitute sawn timber, brick, iron,
stone, slates, shingles, tiles, for bush timber and bark, and may
improve it to any extent he pleases. The dwelling shall be occu-
pied continuously as a residence by the Holder ; and in the event
of its destruction prior to the expiry of tHa� term, it shall be
re-built by, or at the cost of, the Holder. Another improvement
condition with respect to Pastoral Holdings shall be the erection
of a stock-yard of the kind ordinarily in use, which must enclose
an area of at least two hundred and twenty-five square yards, and
must be sufficient to retain stock, A Pastoral Holding must be


continuously occupied by stock, viz., horses or cattle or sheep, the
bona fide property of the Holder, from the date he takes up resi-
dence until the lapse of one year from last annual payment of
purchase money. A year from the date of first payment of
purchase money shall be allowed for the completion of fencing
and the erection of a dwelling and stock-yard. In the case of a
co-partnery, the partner in whose name the Holding has been
taken up, and who has been designated to fulfil conditions and
transact on its behalf, shall fulfil the residence condition. The
residence of a Holder, Agricultural or Pastoral, upon his Holding
must commence at least three months after date of first payment
of purchase money, and it may be fulfilled under canvas or
in a temporary erection pending the completion of a permanent
dwelling, mid. it must continue until the lapse of one year from
date of fijsfTpayment of purchase money. With the Pastoral
Holder cultivation shall be optional. Proprietary rights of Con-
ditional Purchasers shall begin from date of first payment of
purchase money.
Clause Fifth.? When the fencing put up by the owner of a
holding forms a boundary for an adjoining holding, the adjoining
Holder, whose boundary it also forms, shall to the extent it forms
his boundary erect one-half of it, or pay half the cost of its
erection; but the Bill of Charges must distinguish labour from
materials, and must specify the number of days the work lasted,
the number of men or lads, or both, employed, the rate of wages,
which must not exceed the ordinary rate at the time the fencing-
in question was put up, and under the head ? Materials ? distinct
materials must be placed under distinct sub-heads, which must
constitute distinct items of cost, and Haulage, which must be
placed as a distinct item, must specify the time or the distance
and the nature of the traction, whether that of horses or bullocks,
with or without drays, waggons or timber carriages, or by boat,
vessel or railway train, and the cost and distance by each mode, if
more than one mode were resorted to, and the bill must be
endorsed as reasonable by a Magistrate of the Territory before
payment can be demanded. If the later or later-coming Purchaser
find that the fencing along his boundary for the half of which he
is liable has been put up, he may, in discharge of his liability, if
he prefer, erect a like description of fence of a length expressive
of his liability, along another boundary not yet fenced of the
Holding in question, with the consent of the Holder, in lieu of
payment of his share of liability ; or he might agree to erect a
shorter length of a costlier kind of fence, where he might be


directed, which would exactly express his liability ; or he might
erect a like description of fence to that on his boundary of a
length expressing his liability, where directed, on the adjoining
Holder?s land ; or he might defray his liability by paying part
and by giving a certain amount of labour in lieu of the balance ;
but these concessive modes of discharge of liability with respect
to boundary fencing must be the subject of a written and
witnessed Agreement which must specify exactly what is accepted
in discharge of liability, each party retaining a copy. When a
holder purposes to begin fencing, he shall notify his intention to
the Minister for Lands or the nearest Lands Agent, and this notice
shall be posted at the Metropolitan Lands Office and at the office
of the local Lands Agent, so that adjoining holders may be
enabled to confer with reference to the erection of boundary
fencing. Upon the completion by a holder of his half of fencing,
if the adjoining Holder concerned do not appear or commence
work, he must stop short and wait a month, and upon the expiry
of a month from the date of his leaving off should the adjoining
Holder or his men not appear, he may on behalf of the latter
complete the remaining half of boundary fencing, but he must
again stop if the party interested appear and offer to complete
what remains to be erected, and in such a case he must charge
only for what fencing is done in excess of liability, and for fencing
materials delivered along the boundary. The Holder, in fencing
his half of joint boundary, must begin at one end and work
continuously forward until it is completed, and if he capriciously,
or through bad management, enhance the cost of fencing so that
the Bill of Charges for fencing done on behalf of an adjoining
holder or owner exceeds the ordinary contract price for post and
rail fencing of the quantity set forth in the bill, a magistrate
shall not be entitled to endorse the bill as reasonable. When the
half of a boundary fence is completed, if it be two-railed the
remaining half must be two-railed, if three-railed the remaining
half must be three-railed. Specifications for a joint boundary
fence other than post and rail must not be transmitted to the
Minister for Lands or his agent without the assent of the
adjoining owner interested signified in writing. When the
fencing fronts a road, lane, or unalienated Crown Lands, the
approval of the Minister or his agent will be sufficient. When a
boundary fence has stood for one year or over prior to land
adjoining being taken up, the later Holder, should he prefer to
pay or should he be shut up to payment of his share of liability
by refusal of the prior Holder to accede to the other modes of
discharge of liability mentioned, may deduct at the rate of four


per cent, per annum from the gross amount of the bill. Any
individual maliciously tampering with a fence so as to weaken or
injure it, or wilfully driving stock or anything at or against it, or
breaking, it down or destroying it or any other improvement
made by a conditional purchaser, shall promptly repair and make
good the damage, and in default of doing so shall be imprisoned
with or without hard labour in one of Her Majesty?s jails or
houses of correction for a period not less than three months and
not more than three years, and with respect to a minor or minors,
fourteen years of age and under, should their parents or guardians
not repair or make good the damage done, they shall be sent for
a term not less than three months nor more than three years to a
reformatory or house of correction. Payment on account of
boundary fencing may be made at the option of the party charged
in six half-yearly equal instalments.
Clause Sixth. ?Upon the decease of a Holder, executors or
trustees, acting in terms of a will or bequest on behalf of a minor
or minors, may appoint an agent to continue the fulfilment of
conditions, including residence ; but when not otherwise directed
by Will and Testament, his Holding shall lapse to the deceased
Holder?s widow, if he left a widow, or if his wife were predeceased,
to his children, share and share alike, or in default of widow or
children to the surviving nearest of kin in the order of seniority.
The deceased Holder?s widow may continue the fulfilment of con-
ditions and have her name entered as Holder in lieu of that of her
deceased husband. When at death a Holder leaves children
uncared for, in default of Testamentary instructions with respect
to them any male relation offering, or in the case of competing
offers, the nearest male relation or the eldest, when relations
offering are equally close, offering to transact and to fulfil con-
ditions on their behalf and see to their interests, shall be
permitted to act as resident guardian and shall be registered as
agent in loco parentis, and may receive as may be stipulated by
the Primary Judge in equity from the estate certain remuneration
or a certain portion of the Holding, conditional upon fulfilling his
office until conditions are completed, over and above board and
residence for himself and, if married, his wife ; but the board and
residence of the children of a resident guardian shall be placed to
account of remuneration, and upon the completion of conditions
the portion ceded to the guardian shall be surveyed and detached,
and the rest of the Holding shall be subdivided into a like number
of equal portions as there are surviving children at the cost of the
estate, and each shall receive a title to his or her portion. Should


no relation or friend offer to act as resident guardian, the right
and title of deceased?s children to the Holding, together with
stock, crops, and industrial appliances, shall be sold, and the
proceeds applied to their benefit. Should a resident guardian
illtreat the child or the children under his care _or fail to fulfil
conditions, he may be called upon by the Primary Judge in
equity to shew cause why he should not demit his office, and may
upon conviction of illtreatment of a ward or wards or of wilful
failure to fulfil conditions, be removed from his office by order of
said Judge, who may appoint another relative or friend, offering
to act, to the post of resident guardian, or he may authorise the sale
of the right of deceased Holder?s family to the Holding, together
with crops, produce, stock, industrial appliances, &c., and the
application of proceeds to their benefit. A resident guardian
demitting his office voluntarily or under compulsion shall be
remunerated to date of demission according to agreement, but
shall forfeit his title to any portion of the Holding that might be
ceded to him as part remuneration for his services. When a
holding lapses, in default of Testamentary instructions, to the
widow or the nearest of kin of a deceased holder in the order of
seniority, either may employ an agent to reside on it and fulfil
conditions, and in the case of an agricultural holding either may
dispose of the right and title to the Holding at one of the periods
allotted for so doing. When a holder is confined under the
Lunacy Act, his wife, or if he were a widower or single, Ins
nearest of male kin of legal age in the order of seniority offering
to act may act as his agent and fulfil conditions on his behalf ,
but in default of any relative or friend offering to act as agent,
the Master in Lunacy or officer charged with seeing to the
property of lunatics, shall appoint an agent to reside upon the
Holding and fulfil conditions pending the lunatic?s recovery.
If the �Holding be Agricultural, and there be difficulties in
the way of continuing the residential agency, the Master
in Lunacy, or officer so charged, may, at one of the periods
appointed for so doing, sell the right and title of the insane
person to his Holding, but only after public notice made a month
before calling upon any friend or relative of the lunatic to act as
agent, and if in the interim any relative or friend of the insane
person offer to act as residential agent and transact on his behalf,
he shall, preference being given to relatives in the order of close-
ness of affinity and seniority, permit one offering, or one_ of the
number offering to take up the agency, to do so, and the residential
agent so appointed shall be accepted by the Minister for Lands
pending the completion of conditions. In all cases the wife of a


Holder insane, if she desire to act as agent and fulfiller of
conditions on Ins behalf, shall do so, and she shall be
accepted as her husband?s deputy by the Minister for
Lands during his confinement. In the case of the imprison-
ment of a Holder for any breach of law, his wife shall
be accepted as his deputy for the fulfilment of conditions
during his absence. When a Holding has been left to a minor or
minors executors or trustees may on behalf of either, dispose of
the right and title to the Holding in question, upon obtaining the
written consent of three of the nearest relatives of the party or
parties to whom it belongs. When a Holder at the date of his
death was a co-partner, his share in the holding as it stood when
Jio died shall be payable to whomsoever it was bequeathed, or to
whom it lapsed upon the sale of right and title to the Holding by
the remaining partner or partners, or upon the issue to either of
a title deed, should the party or parties owning the share of
deceased Holder be debarred from taking his place in the
co-partnery. The remaining partner or partners may, however,
at their option, liquidate deceased Holder?s interest in whole or in
part, prior to the getting of a title deed, or to the sale of right title
and interest. Upon the lapse of one year from last annual pay-
ment of purchase money, the Minister for Lands shall give the
Conditional Purchaser a title to his Holding, and should the givinw
ot the title deed be delayed two months thereafter, he shall for
every day of further delay, compensate the Purchaser to the
extent of �1 per clay, and the Conditional Purchaser may take
steps to enforce the giving to him of a deed of title, and the pay-
ment.oi compensation. When two or more Conditional Purchasers
comcidently take up a holding, the right to the ownership of it
shall be decided by the drawing of lots.
Clause Seventh. ?The unresumed portions of Runs shall
have their boundaries set forth on the land, and on maps, by sur-
veyors ; and shall be held under lease of ten years, and present
pastoral lessees shall have the preferent offer of leasing them at
the rental of one penny per acre per annum, payable yearly in
l V n 1 !? 6 le mon^l * n which the first rent-payment is made
shall be the month in which future annual rent payments shall
Je made, and the lease shall date from the date of first rent pay-
ment. Should any Pastoral Lessee decline to lease the unresumed
portion of his Run at the rental fixed, the lease shall be submitted
to public competition, and the party, or firm, offering the highest
figure, per acre per annum shall secure it; but before submitting
it to public competition, a valuation of improvements, made by


the retiring lessee on the unresumed portion, shall be executed at
the instance of the Minister for Lands, upon the basis of value at
the time of valuation, and the incoming lessee or lessees shall pay
the valuation amount in a lump sum when the first year?s rent
is paid, which must be at the conclusion of the sale, or, if pre-
ferred, it may be paid in ten equal, annual instalments, payable
coincidently with the payment of rental with interest upon the
nine remaining instalments of four per cent., upon amount of in-
stalment, added. The purchaser of improvements may, however,
if he wish to hasten the completion of payment on account of
them, enlarge the amount of any single instalment to any extent
he pleases. Should the incoming lessee or lessees give up the
lease before it expires, the remainder of it shall be placed under
offer, and the next lessee or lessees shall pay the remaining in-
stalments due on account of improvements when they fall due.
One-half the cost of valuing shall be borne by the retiring lessee
or lessees. The privileges of Pastoral Lessees, under this act, shall
be those of use and wont, or such as are ordinarily used and
exercised. The Pastoral Lessee, demurring to the valuation of the
Minister for Lands, whether as regards improvements on the re-
sumed or the unresumed portion of his Run, may have their value
decided by arbitration in the mode set forth in this Clause, and
any valuation once subjected to arbitration cannot be disturbed
but must stand unaltered ; and protests, or payments under pro-
test, and appeals to arbitration by incoming pastoral lessees or
Conditional Purchasers, shall only be permissible when the Min-
ister for Lands? valuation has not been tested by arbitration. As
to resumed portions of Runs, anterior improvements thereon shall
be valued only after these portions have been subdivided into
Holdings, and for each Holding that contains anterior improve-
ments there shall be a separate valuation, and the valuable im-
provements shall be limited to dams, tanks, wells, or water-holes
artificially made and lined with timber, stone, brick, cement, or
concrete, and to buildings, slab buildings excepted, and wire or
post and rail fencing. Slab huts, or other erections of bush timber
and bark may be removed, sold, or re-erected by owners. In all
cases valuation shall proceed upon actual realizable value at the
time of valuation. One-half the cost of valuing improvements on
resumed lands shall be borne by the party claiming value for
them. The Conditional Purchaser whose holding bears anterior
improvements shall pay the amount due on account of them in a
lump sum, when he pays his first instalment of purchase-money,
or in two equal, annual instalments, first instalment to be paid
when the first instalment of purchase-money is paid ; last instal-


ment, with four per cent, interest added to its amount, when the
second instalment of purchase-money is paid. Any purchaser of
a pastoral lease, or conditional purchaser, demurring to the
valuation figure of improvements may pay the amount due on
account of them, whether the full amount or a first instalment,
under protest, and appeal to arbitration, provided that the valu-
ation objected to has not already been tested by arbitration.
Arbitration shall proceed as follows :?Two arbitrators appointed,
one by the Minister for Lands, the other by the party seeking
arbitration, shall make, upon accepting office, a solemn declara-
tion in legal form that they are not related to the several parties
on whose behalf they act, that they have not taken, and will not
take, any bribe, directly or indirectly, but will honestly and to
the best of their ability determine and truly pronounce the pre-
sent value of the improvements they are now called upon to
appraise. They shall personally inspect each improvement that
forms the subject of appraisement. The valuation of the Govern-
ment valuers shall stand confirmed should the joint decision or
the differing decisions of the arbitrators as to value not both
exceed or diminish by �IOO or more the figure of their valuation.
When the Government valuation stands confirmed, the retiring-
lessee receiving the value of improvements who sought arbitration
shall pay the cost thereof: but should it be aside, the result
being diminished value, he shall pay the cost; but when the re-
sult is increased value, the Minister for Lands shall pay the half
of arbitration costs. When the Conditional Purchaser or the pur-
chaser of a pastoral lease seeks arbitration, and the government
valuation stands confirmed, or be set aside in the direction of
increased value, either party shall pay the cost thereof ; but if the
result be diminished value to the extent of �IOO or more, the
Minister for Lands shall pay half the costs. Costs shall not
exceed ten guineas for each arbitrator, and ten guineas for the
umpire, should one be appointed, and the fee of ten guineas shall
include incidental expenses, as stationery, &c. The parties to the
arbitration may, if they choose, defray lodging and travelling-
expenses, or lodge and convey their respective arbitrators or the
umpire. Should the arbitrators jointly fix a figure of value differ-
ing from the Government valuation to the extent of �IOO or more,
it shall be set aside, and their valuation shall stand. Should the
arbitrators fail to agree, and their differing values, one or both,
reach or exceed �IOO of difference from the government value,
they shall, if possible, mutually appoint an umpire, who shall
upon taking office make a like solemn declaration to that made by
the arbitrators ; and he shall inspect improvements and take notes


of their value, and after hearing the reasons of the arbitrators for
their respective findings, and after duly deliberating, shall give
his decision. If the umpire?s value does not differ by �IOO or
more from that assigned by the Lands? valuers, the official valua-
tion stands confirmed ; otherwise should it lessen or exceed by
�IOO or more the figure of official value, his valuation shall stand,
and the official valuation shall be set aside. Should the umpire
confirm the value assigned by one arbitrator, that arbitrator?s
value shall stand ; but when he decides differently to both Arbi-
trators, it will he his duty to give written reasons for his
decision when called upon by them to do so. The Minister for
Lands shall have power, when pastoral leases expire, to terminate
or renew them, or to resume or abridge the area covered by them,
as the exigencies of settlement may demand ; but in all cases re-
tiring or dispossessed pastoral lessees shall receive value for im-
provements made or bought by them on Crown lands within the
limits set forth in this Clause. Proprietary rights of Pastoral
Lessees shall begin from the date of first rent-payment.
Clause Eighth.? The Minister for Mines shall order a
Geological and Mineral Survey of lands, known to contain, or that
shew signs of containing, minerals, and should it be evident that
the most profitable mode of utilizing them is to reserve them for
mining purposes, they shall be so reserved, and shall be sub-
divided into mineral leaseholds. Mineral leaseholds shall be held
under lease from the Minister for Mines for the term of Fifteen
Years ; and sealed Tenders shall be invited for the figure of rental,
per acre, per annum. Should sealed Tenders not reach a reason-
able figure, the Minister may submit the rental per acre, per
annum to public competition. The highest tenderer or the
highest bidder, shall secure the lease, which shall date from the
date of accepted tender, or accepted highest bidding. The
successful tender, must, upon being notified that his tender has
been accepted, pay one year?s rent in advance, the successful
bidder must also pay one year?s rent in advance at the conclusion
of the sale, and registration of the name or names of the Lessee
or Lessees shall proceed when the first year?s rent is paid.
Payments must be in bank notes or current coin, or in both, and
may be made at the Mines? Office, or at a bank designated by the
Minister for Mines or, in the case of a sale, at the salesman?s office
Rent shall be due each year in the same month and day of month as
that in which the first rent payment took place. The proprietary
rights of Mineral Lessees shall date from the date of the first rent
payment. Should from any cause a Lessee or Lessees find it


it difficult to continue operations under the lease, either may
after giving a month?s notice of their intention to the Minister
for Mines at the expiry of five years from the date of first rent-
payment or at the expiry of ten years from date aforesaid after
giving said notice sell his or their right, title, and interest to
and in the leasehold by public auction, or privately by an
auctioneer ; and the party or parties purchasing shall be regis-
tered as Lessee or Lessees in lieu of retiring Lessee or Lessees,
and shall be subject to like terms and conditions, and shall make
an affidavit, or solemn affirmation as to the price, payable or paid,
and the Minister for Mines shall be entitled to ten per cent, of
gross proceeds of sale, which shall he paid to him at its con-
clusion by the vendor or vendors. Mining leaseholds shall be in
area not less than twelve nor more than twelve hundred acres, and
shall be surveyed and their boundaries set forth on the land and
on maps prior to being offered, and they shall have at least part
frontage to a surveyed road to allow of free outlet, and shall be
held subject to the condition that the Lessee or Lessees
lay or pile on the ground, inside their bounds, ready for haulage,
unsmelted ore or matrix, or stone, or materials containing ore,
or any thing of marketable value, classed mineral as coal, ker-
osene shale, &c., to the extent at least of one ton per acre per annum.
The Lessee or Lessees shall have power to construct, tram or
railways, and to use materials on their leased property required
in prosecuting their enterprise, or useful for residential purposes ;
and shall have the exclusive right of pasturage, cultivation and
residence on their leaseholds; and shall have power, subject to
the sanction of the Minister for Works, to connect their lines of
rail with the nearest Government railroad. Upon the expiry of
the lease the Lessee or Lessees shall have preferent offer of
renewal, and failing renewal they shall have their fixed im-
provements (mining shafts, drives, adits, excavations excepted)
valued by the Minister for Mines at his cost, who shall appoint
two valuers for the purpose, and they, the Lessee or Lessees shall
receive 75 per cent, of their actual value at the time of valuation
and if they demur to the value assigned they may appeal to
arbitration which shall proceed as directed in Clause seventh, and
be governed by the same rules, one arbitrator being appointed by
the' Minister for Mines, the other by the party or parties seeking
arbitration. The lease, with improvements shall he again placed
under offer and sealed tenders shall be again invited for the figure of
rental per acre per annum, and failing a satisfactory tender
the lease shall be offered to public competition by auction. At
the Mines? Office and at all Court-houses, maps of mineral lands


available for leasing shall be accessible to the public, and on these
shall be shewn the registered number, boundaries, and acreage of
each leasehold, and if possible, the minerals it contains, and as
soon as a lease is purchased, the word ? leased ? shall be placed
inside its traced limits on the map. A handbook attached to each
map, may state the position of each leasehold, with respect to the
nearest town or railway station, or navigable water, and may state
the minerals thereon, their nearness to the surface, and the strata
to be encountered in getting at them. Mineral Lessees shall not
be allowed to raise money on their leases or on their improvements,
but they may do so on their goods, chattels, moveable industrial
appliances, stock, garnered produce, or on minerals smelted or
unsmelted, including coal, kerosene shale, or precious stones,
ready for haulage.
Clause Ninth. ?Essential conditions, the non-fulfilment of
which on the part of the Conditional Purchaser or the Pastoral
or Mineral Lessee, shall render his holding or lease liable to
forfeiture, are with respect to agricultural holdings First, the
annual payment of the specific instalment of purchase money,
and payment on account of improvements valued and voluntarily
purchased by the Holder, as directed in this Act. Second, the
cultivation of one-third the area of the Holding, prior to the lapse
of one year from date of last payment of purchase money.
Third, the fencing of the Holding within or upon the lapse of one
year from date of first payment. Fourth, the residence of the
Holder upon his holding within or upon the lapse of three months
from date of first payment to the expiry of one year from
date of last payment of purchase money. \\htl i respect to
pastoral holdings, essential conditions are-First, the annual
payment of the specific instalment of purchase money, and pay-
ment on account of improvements valued and voluntarily
purchased by the Holder, as directed in this Act. Second, the
fencing of the Holding, and the erection thereon of a cottage and
stockyard, within or upon the lapse of one year from date of first
payment. Third, the depasturing upon the Holding of stock,
however few in number, the property of the Holder, from the date
he begins residence thereon to the lapse of one year from date of
last payment. Fourth, the residence of the Holder upon his
holding, within or upon the lapse of three months from date of
first payment to the expiry of one year from date of last payment
of purchase money. Essential conditions with respect to pastoral
lessees, are the payment of the rent as directed, annually in
advance, and payment as directed, of improvements valued and


purchased by the lessee or lessees. Essential conditions with
respect to mineral lessees, are the payment of the rent annually as
directed, and the laying or piling upon the ground, ready for
haulage, ore or materials containing ore, or anything of marketable
value, which may be classed mineral, as coal, kerosene shale, to
the extent of one ton per acre per annum. When inadvertent
violation of the essential condition with respect to stock de-
pasturing on a Pastoral Holding takes place through the stock
straying or being maliciously driven away, a fine of �2 per day
shall be imposed by the Minister for Lands, for every day the
Holding is absolutely free from stock, but this fine shall be wholly
or partially remitted if it be clearly proved that the Holder
exerted himself to bring his stock back. Holders, so long as
they make their home on their holdings, shall be at liberty to
leave them at intervals, but only under pressure of business, and
in their absence, should it be prolonged over one week, they must
designate a male of legal age to act in their behalf. The Minister
of Lands will be at liberty to allow one month?s grace for arrears of
payments and of improvement conditions, if he be satisfied that
the parties applying for grace, had exerted themselves to comply
with conditions. With reference to payment on account of
improvements valued, should a holding taken up contain no
improvements by a pastoral lessee, valuable and valued, of course
the Holder will have nothing to pay under this head.
Clause Tenth. ? The Minister for Lands on being petitioned
by both parties to a dispute, whether conditional purchasers or
pastoral lessees to settle it; and the Minister for Mines on being-
petitioned to settle any dispute by mineral leaseholders, may each
appoint two assessors and constitute a Court of Adjustment, and
the assessors shall sit with the Minister presiding, and adjudicate
with him in the matters brought before them. The parties to
the dispute shall sign the petition asking for a settlement, and in
it they must pledge themselves to abide by the decision of the
Court. In any dispute between a holder of Crown Lands under
this Act, and a mineral leaseholder, the Minister for Lands, if
petitioned by both parties, may settle it with the consent of the
Minister for Mines, or the Minister for Mines if petitioned, may
settle it and hold a Court of Adjustment, with the consent of the
Minister for Lands. The assessors appointed by the Minister
presiding, must not be related to him nor to either of the parties
to the dispute, must have no specific business connection with
them, and must have no interest in the issue. The joint decision
of both assessors, or of the Minister and one of the assessors, shall


be the decision of the Court, and the decision must in no
particular traverse this Act. When the Minister for Lands or the
Minister for Mines is petitioned by the parties to a dispute to
constitute a court of adjustment in the locality where they, the
parties, reside under aforesaid conditions, they shall do so, and
each party to the dispute shall nominate an assessor, and the
Minister petitioned shall nominate an assessor, who shall preside
and act as the Minister?s representative. The local Court of
Adjustment, so constituted, may try and determine any causes
relating to lands or leaseholds under this Act, brought before it.
Other disputants, who have petitioned for a local Adjustment
Court, may appoint as their assessors, those who may have sat in
previous cases. The Ministerial or presiding Assessor, shall be
paid one guinea by each party for each case. Each party to the
dispute shall be responsible only for the fee, two guineas of their
representative Assessor, and for the half-fee, one guinea of the
presiding Assessor. Parties may, or may not, employ attorneys,
if they do so, they must pay the attorneys they employ.
