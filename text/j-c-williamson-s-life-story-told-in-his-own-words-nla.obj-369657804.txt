James Cassius Williamson died in Paris on Sunday, 6th July, 1913,
at the close of his 68th year.
Six years ago Mr. Williamson told The; Bookffllow the story of
his life until that time. He revised every word in proof; and himself
reprinted this life-story, in book form, for circulation among his
friends. On the day after his death his representative in Sydney
received this cablegram from his widow:
Daddy died very peacefully to-day. Use BOOKFELLOW biography : he
liked it best.
Mary Williamson.
Mr. Williamsons autobiography is accordingly reprinted from
Thß Bookffllow in his own words, following.
There remains to add a brief chronicle of Mr. Williamson's later
professional days. Ihe year 1907 was the year of his withdrawal from
the most strenuous work that had been associated with his enterprises as
a theatrical manager. He began, in his own words, to take in sail.
But Ins professional interest persisted, and, almost until the end, some
part of his time zvas devoted to the further establishment of the vast
edifice he had built up.
In 1911 Mr. Ramaciotti retired from the Williamson management,
and Mr. Hugh J. Ward became a partner with Mr. Williamson and Mr.
Tallis. Later, the Williamson theatrical undertakings zvere amalga-
mated with those of Messrs. Clarke and Meynell; and the firm became
J. C. Williamson Ltd, Mr. Williamson remained governing director;
Messrs. George Tallis, Hugh J. Ward, and Clyde Meynell are managing
directors.
While he retained his full strength, Mr. Williamson liked to travel
to witness plays and performances in the interest of his firm. During
the last tzvo years, he virtually had retired from the direction of the
firm's enterprises, except in occasional consultations, and the business
has been conducted entirely by the managing directors.
Mr. Williamson’s will directs that the residence of his daughters
Marjorie and Aimee. during their minority, shall be zvith his American
brother and sister. He desired that his body should he buried in
Sydney, “if practicable”; but, having regard to the direction of his will,
Mrs. Williamson has consented to the urgent request of Mr.
Williamson’s family that he be buried zvith his father and mother in
America.

J. C. Williamson’s Life-Story
“I WAS born at Mercer, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on 26th August, 1845.
Mercer is a county town where my father was a doctor. Both
my father and mother were Americans. He was of Irish descent, she
of Scottish. Of course, I look upon America as my native country.
Sometimes people have said to me, 'Your fortune is bound up in Aus-
tralia now; why don’t you get naturalised?’ I don't see that. Aus-
tralia is my country, too, and I expect to spend the rest of my days
ihere, but I think a man should never deny his mother country.
“I had a good common school and high school education, and the
American schools in those days were excellent. One thing they seemed
to do was to make every boy wish to hit out for himself. That was
the first idea of every American boy in my time, to get away from
home as soon as possible, and start and make his own way. The
schools encouraged independence of character. I don't think they do
so now —I don’t know, of course, because I haven't been in close touch
with America for a long time—but it seems to me that the American
boy of to-day is less ambitious than we used to be. He isn’t so eager
to go ahead and do something for himself at an early age.
"While I was a boy our family shifted west to Milwaukee, the
capital of Wisconsin, where my uncle was a merchant in a big way of
business. There was a large family of us boys and girls, but I was
the only one with a turn for the stage, and I don't know that any of
my father's or mother’s people was ever inclined that way.
“Jimmy” was the Bloodhound.
“I used to act in amateur theatricals, and when I was sixteen I got
an engagement with a company at the Milwaukee theatre. I was full
of energy and enthusiasm, and did pretty well everything. My morn-
ings were spent in learning fencing and dancing. In the afternoon
I’d look after the box office, and at evening help the stage manager and
take my part —sometimes three or four parts.


“I remember I even painted some of the scenery for a performance
of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin.’ I knew nothing about scene-painting, but
I did the ice scene—with the blocks of ice made out of candle boxes—
and when Eliza and her child were escaping across the ice I shouted
and waved the red fire, and looked after the barking of the bloodhound.
I was the bloodhound.
“Well, one of the company arranged to go to Canada, and asked
me to come along. That was in 1862. I went to my uncle—who was
my guardian, my father being dead —and told him about it. I suppose
they saw there was no stopping me; but he said, ‘Remember, if you
go, you go for good: there must be no coming back unless you give
up the stage altogether. You can’t do a little of this and a little of
something else.' He wanted me to go to Harvard or Yale and study
for a profession. ‘All right!’ I said, and off I went, and from that day
to this I have been connected with the stage, and I can say truly that
I have made my own way and never had help from anybody to the
extent of a shilling that I didn’t earn.
“We played in Canada one year, and when the company broke up
I determined to come to New York. That was in 1863. New York,
of course, was the centre of our theatrical world, and it seemed there
wasn't much chance there for a youth of seventeen. However, I came
along, and met a Mr. English whom I had seen with the company in
Canada. He was running a high-class vaudeville entertainment at the
Olympic Theatre, and he told me that he was going to put on a farce
to play before his entertainment, and offered me a small part. I was
to be ‘Quicksilver’ in The Artful Dodger. He offered me ten dollars
a week, and I took it gladly. I was engaged in New York!
Engaged in New York.
“Well, when the rehearsals came on I saw there was likely to be
trouble. The principal actor objected to me playing ‘Quicksilver.’ The
fact was he had a friend of his own whom he wished to put on, and he
would not hear of me. So one day I went in and saw Mr. English, and
he said, ‘Jimmy, I can’t give you that part.’ ‘But,’ I said, ‘you’ve en-
gaged me.’ ‘Well,’ he said, ‘l’m sorry, but the fact is Mr. So-and-So
objects. He says you’re too young.’ ‘But,’ I said, ‘l’m engaged!’
T can’t help that,’ he said ; ‘you can’t have the part.’ The end of it was


he offered me another and smaller part. ‘But/ he said, ‘I can only give
yon five dollars a week!’ ‘Never mind; I’m engaged!' That was my
idea—to have an engagement. Five dollars is only £i a week, but I
didn’t care: I could live on that, and I went on and took the part. The
result was that in a few nights the actor who was playing ‘Quicksilver’
didn’t turn up, and I played ‘Quicksilver’ for the rest of the run of the
piece.
“I had an idea I could do better, so one day I went and saw the
elder Mr. Wallack. Wallack’s Theatre at that time was the leading
theatre of America, and there never has been a better company on the
English-speaking stage than Wallack’s company was then. There
were no stars, but nearly every performer was an artist worthy of
being starred : and if the same company could be brought together at
the present time under the existing conditions of theatrical affairs there
would not be a theatre in New York which would hold money enough
at regular prices to the salaries they could command. That is
because salaries were comparatively very low in those days. The
most I ever drew at Wallack’s was fifty dollars a week. They used to
stage the old comedies like Sheridan’s, and newer ones like Robertson’s.
I remember Charles Mathews was the light comedian one season, and
Charles Wyndham (now Sir Charles) was another.
“I called at the old gentleman’s house—he was over seventy at
that time. I met him just as he was getting into his carriage, and he
consented to see me the following day. The following day I called,
and was shown into a waiting-room—and I’ll tell you a singular
thing. Do you see that picture of John Kemble as Rolla hanging on
the wall? That was offered to me some years ago as a portrait by Sir
Thomas Lawrence. I made enquiries, and the history seemed to be
all right, it being the original study for his great picture in the Peel
gallery, so I bought it. Well, I couldn’t help thinking that I had seen
it before ; and one day, as I was looking at it, the memory came back to
me. It had hung in old Mr. Wallack’s house, in the room where I sat
waiting for him. I looked into the papers I had got with it, and sure
enough I found that it had been owned by the elder Mr. Wallack. So it
had travelled from England to America and from America to Australia,
and had come to remind me of my first important engagement.


Taken on at Wallack’s.
“When I was shown into the old gentleman’s room I told him I
wanted an engagement to fill a vacancy there would be in his company
next season. He put his hand on a pile of papers that seemed about
two feet high, and he said, ‘Do you see that, my boy? Two-thirds of
those letters are from people who want the little engagement you are
asking me for.’ Then we talked, and he asked me to call again. I
called, and found he had gone to the seaside. When he came back I
called again, and he told me he was going to give me the part. So I
came on at Wallack’s.
“Just before I joined I had a joke with Mr. English. He was
forming a company to go touring, and he met me one day and offered
me a place in the company. I thanked him, and said, ‘No; I didn’t
think I’d be able to; I thought of taking an engagement at Wallack’s.
That rather took him aback, for, of course, he didn’t believe the thing
was possible, because Wallack s was a close corporation in those days.
To show you the strength of their company at that time, they played
The Rivals in New York one night, complete to the smallest part. Every
part was played by an actor, and by a good actor too. The same night
the other half of the company played The School for Scandal in
Brooklyn, also complete, with a good actor for every part. All the
actors in both pieces belonged to the regular company, and either of
those casts would be considered star casts nowadays.
“I made my first big New York success as Dick Swiveller in The
Old Curiosity Shop , with ‘Lotta’- —America’s most popular star
comedienne—during a summer season at Wallack’s.
A Treble Recall and a Waiting- “Star.”
“Altogether I stayed wdth Wallack’s for seven years, playing all
kinds of parts, and gradually improving my position. Generally I was
cast for dialect parts. I took all dialects—French, Dutch, Irish,
Chinese, Negro, Yorkshire, Somersetshire—anything that came along.
Perhaps the greatest success of my young days was gained one night
that I was playing ‘Sim’ in O'Keefe’s play of Wild Oats. I had a
scene with Lester Wallack, who was a great actor. Now, Wallack’s
Theatre in those days was a regular home of stage tradition, so far
as the old comedies were concerned. The prompt-books contained all


the business that had been set down for the regular parts in all the
plays, often going back many years and commencing with the business
directed by the authors. The books were regarded as a kind of stage
Bible, and any departure from them was simply not to be thought of.
“Well, in this scene with Lester Wallack, between Rover and Sim,
I seemed to feel the part much better in my own way than in the way
it was set down for me by the prompt-book. I told that to the stage
manager —Mr. John Gilbert—and he was properly shocked. ‘My boy,’
he said, ‘it’s not to be thought of!’ But when I got on the stage I felt
as if I must take the part my own way after all, and I did. When my
scene was over I went back to the dressing-room, and after a bit (it
seemed quite a good while) a call boy came along and said, ‘Mr.
Williamson, you’re wanted.’ I came out wondering what was up, and
thinking the old gentleman was going to take me to task for altering
the business. To my surprise I was told to go on in front; the audience
had called for me —a remarkable thing in the middle of a scene. I
went on, and they applauded furiously. Then I went off and was called
back for more applause. Then I went off again, but the public would
not let Mr. Wallack go on with the scene, and a third time I was called
back, and we had to do the scene over again before they would let us
go.
“Well, now, Mr. Wallack was a star, and I was only a youngster,
and it was a very unusual thing that the star should be made wait while
the audience recalled the junior who had played with him. I always
think that was one of the finest things that ever happened to me; and I
was very proud of being specially complimented by Charles Fechter,
who was in front.
“ Where’s Jimmy Williamson ?’*
“One night old Mr. Wallack came to me and said that, owing to
the illness of John Brougham, I must play the part of Sir Lucius
O’Trigger in The Rivals on the following night. It is a very long
part, and there were only a few hours to get it up in. ‘Jimmy,’ he
said, ‘you’ve got to do it!’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘l’ll try.’ So after the play
that night I went home and wrote out the part, which took me till about
two o’clock, and studied it. Then I went to bed for two or three hours,


woke up, and had some strong coffee, and at it again. At night I
played the part letter perfect. That was my idea, always to be ready
for anything, and never miss a chance of getting on. The consequence
was that, in the last years of my time at Wallack’s, whenever there was
anything out of the way to do, they said, ‘Where’s Jimmy Williamson?’
“After that I got an engagement at the Old Broadway Theatre as
principal comedian; till in 1871 John McCullough, manager of the
California Theatre, came to New York looking for a comedian. The
California Theatre at San Francisco was a very big affair in those
times, and prided itself upon its superiority. Their leading comedian,
John Raymond, was leaving them, and after looking all round the
manager offered me his place. That, of course, 'was a high testimonial,
so I signed on at a very fine salary, and said good-bye to New York.
In San Francisco I had great success at the California, with occasional
trips starring round about. \\ Idle I was in San Francisco Dion
Boucicault, senior, father of Dot Boucicault, came over to play a season,
and 111 tell you how he dished the "Frisco reporters. They thought
themselves smart men, as indeed they were, and when Boucicault’s
season was announced they all sharpened their pencils, and it was
hinted that Dion was going to have a warm time.
How Boucicault Dished the Reporters.
“Well, of course, he heard all about it, and this is what he did.
On his first night he introduced a sketch called Boucicault in California.
In this he appeared at home in the Occidental Hotel, just arriving.
I was Murphy, his servant, with remarks on all and sundry; Barton
Hill came to tell him about the pieces he was going to play; then came
in an actress to play the part of a debutante with a San Jose reputation
(which is as if a debutante with a Parramatta reputation came to play
at Sydney)—and so on. Then came in the reporters, especially W. A.
Mestayer, as Bogus Push, of The Weekly Pill —and Boucicault talked
to the reporters. He told them his opinion of everything, especially
California—and left the genuine reporters without a leg to stand on.
He simply said on the stage everything they had to say in the papers,
and left them nothing at all to write. That always struck me as a
particularly happy instance of turning the tables.


J. C. WILLIAMSON —“off to California” in 18 71.
The figure standing on the right is that of J. C. W., his companions
in the picture are an A merican general and family.


“After three years of San Francisco I determined to try a trip to
Australia. Horace Greeley's advice, ‘Go West, young man! go
West!’ was a popular saying in America about that time and we deter-
mined to go still further West. Well, we came to Australia and landed
in Melbourne in 1874, and opened at the Theatre Royal with Struck Oil.
I suppose there's no better known piece in this country. I’ve met
hundreds of people who date their acquaintance with the theatre back
to that piece. Men meet me and say, ‘Look here, Mr. Williamson, I
know you well! I remember when I was a boy my father took me to
see Struck Oil.’
The history of “Struck Oil.’
“The history of the piece is rather interesting. While I was at the
California I was told that an old miner named Sam Smith had written
some plays and was anxious to sell them. I was looking round for
some things to take to Australia, so when a friend asked me if I would
go and hear him read one I said ‘Certainly.’ The piece the old man
wanted to show me was called The Blue and the Gray, but I saw there
was not much in that. ‘Well,’ he said, T have another piece if you'll
let me read it. It’s called The Dead, or Five Years Away.’ So he read
that, and it contained the basis of Struck Oil. I saw there was a good
deal in it, and a great deal that would have to be cut out and altered.
So I bought it right out, giving the old fellow a hundred dollars more
than he asked for it; and got a friend of mine—Clay Greene —to re-
write it. A little later, I went starring to Salt Lake City, and I thought
I’d try this piece. We rehearsed it, and I saw the last act wouldn’t
do. So one Sunday morning I started upon it and wrote and re-wrote
until I had made it suit my own notion, giving out the parts to the com-
pany as I went along. We played it the next night, and it went very
well, so we took it back to San Francisco and played it there, and I
brought it along to Australia.
“One of my friends—Mr. William Hoskins (so well known in
Australia)—said to me in San Francisco, ‘What have you got to take
out there?’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘l’ve got so and so, and so and so,’ —and I
mentioned Struck Oil. He said, ‘Don’t give them that in Australia on
any account; it will be an utter failure. There are no Germans out
there, and they won’t understand it.’ Then, coming over in the ship, I


used to have a look at it now and again, and read a bit here and there.
The captain stopped one day to hear me, and he said, ‘Now, if you’ll
take my advice, you’ll keep that in your box. A thing like that won’t
go down in Australia.'
“Well, I suppose I ought to have been discouraged, but I wasn’t,
and I’ll tell you how I came to play it on our opening night in Mel-
bourne. The night before we opened I had gone to the Opera House,
and Richard Stewart was there playing Prince Cassimir in The Princess
of Trebizond. About the only German he used was ‘Mein Gott in
Himmel!’ and that seemed to go down so well with the audience that I
said, ‘We’ll have Struck Oil .’ And, of course, you know how it caught
A Nightmare Adventure.
“In 1875 I went to India. It was at the time that the Prince of
Wales was visiting there —the late King Edward —and India was en
fete. I suppose there has never been such a time there since. I had the
honour of meeting the Prince of Wales in Charles Mathews' dressing-
room (for he was in India too), and I can tell you a story in connection
with Mathews. One night after the play a lot of English officers
came to supper with him, and I was there, and we had a very jolly
time, and sat up till three in the morning. Their talk was all military,
and they told us the awful tales of the Mutiny, of the well at Cawnpore,
the massacre at Delhi, and so on—a very gruesome set of stories.
“With all these things ringing in my head I went to bed and
dreamed of throat-cutting and smothering, and all kinds of horrible
things, and suddenly I woke to consciousness and realised that I couldn’t
breathe. I opened my eyes, and saw what seemed to me (scarcely
half-awake) a horrid black figure holding my nose with one hand,
while he brandished a razor in the other. I gave a fearful yell and
caught up the pillow and dashed it at him —sent him flying into one
corner of the room, and his razor into the other. Next moment I was
out of bed ready to defend myself, and I saw this darkey crouching at
the other side of the room, and chattering pitifully. He didn’t under-
stand what had happened to him, and for a moment I didn't under-
stand either. Then it came to me that it was the native barber who
was accustomed to come in early in the morning and shave me


while I lay in bed, and he had just been starting operations when he
got mixed up with my dreams of the Mutiny.
“After India a few months were devoted to a jaunt through Egypt,
Italy, France, and Germany. Then, on Easter Monday, 1876, I
opened at the Adelphi under the management of F. B. Chatterton, who
had also the Drury Lane Theatre. Chatterton was the author of the
much - quoted remark.
‘Shakespeare spells ruin.’
We commenced our
season with Struck Oil,
the engagement being to
star for three months
with the option on the
part of the manager to
extend. This option was
almost immediately exer-
cised, extending the
season from Easter to
Easter —twelve months
in all. We played Struck
Oil 100 nights, which
was a good run in those
times, thirty years ago.
We then went into
Irish drama, doing a re-
vival of Arrah-na-Pogue
with a big cast, includ-
ing such London favour-
ites as William Terriss,
Sam Emery, Mrs. Alfred
Melon and Shiel Barry

Feeney. We played Arrah-na-P ague i
success that the manager wished to cont
insisted upon putting up The Shaughraun
us in Irish drama, and
continue
“I wouldn't agree to this, because I knew the piece was Dion


Boucicault’s. It was copyrighted in America, but the copyright did
not extend to England, and legally we were free to play it. But
Boucicault would not give his consent, though the manager offered him
every inducement —and I held out that I would not play till Boucicault
did give his consent. The manager went so far as to cast the piece
and call rehearsals, and when he found I was determined he commenced
an action at law against me for breach of engagement, but the case fell
through. In fact, he had no chance, for I had Charles Mathews, Joe
Jefferson, and others ready to back me up, and prove that he had no
business to make the cast without the star’s consent. But the dispute
ended our Adelphi season, and after touring two years in America,
starring in Struck Oil, I decided to make another trip around the world,
and came back to Australia. That was in 1879, and I’ve been here
ever since; except for trips every two or three years to get new plays,
new people, and new ideas. I believe in keeping myself right up to
date.
"I had always said I would never go in for permanent manage-
ment, because you see a manager’s life is never his own; he has to be at
work all the time. I was doing well enough as an actor, and when a
star actor wants a rest he can simply knock off and take a holiday for
six months, or as long as he likes, and then begin again. But a manager
has no rest. Once he starts he has to keep going all the time. So I
had always said, ‘No management for me!’
At the Head of the Australian Profession
“But when I came to Australia the second time, I brought out
among other new pieces Pinafore, and the first thing I had to do when
I landed was to take out injunctions against the people who were play-
ing it without authority. Pinafore went very well, and then I got The
Pirates of Penzance. George Musgrove was running an opera com-
pany at the time with Tambour Major, and Arthur Garner was running
his English company, and they came to me and said, ‘We had better go
into partnership!’ Well, I held out for a bit, but eventually agreed,
and that started what people called ‘The Triumvirate,’ which lasted
for nine years. Then Musgrove went out, and Garner and I were
together for two years. Then I bought Garner out for a time until
Musgrove rejoined me. We were together for seven years, and I was


alone for four years until I joined forces with two new partners—
Mr. George Tallis and Mr. Gustave Ramaciotti—both friends long
associated with my affairs—Mr. Tallis as my Melbourne manager and
Mr. Ramaciotti as legal adviser.
“So now you’re got a very fair outline of my professional career.
A good deal of it has been spent in playing, but there’s a good deal of
it that has not been play by any means. The stage has given me a lot
of pleasure, a fair share of success, and a great deal of very hard work.
I think it is capacity for hard persistent work that the Australian-born
actor sometimes lacks. Sometimes he wants perseverance: he doesn’t
keep plugging away, and he doesn’t think enough of the stage when he s
off the stage. If a man wants to be a good actor he has to give his mind
to the profession all the time. It’s not enough to gain applause at
night, if you think so much about the applause next morning that you
forget to look out for the next chance. An actor should be always
studying to improve himself, always studying to fit himself for better
parts, always studying to make himself such a trustworthy man all
round that when there’s an opening ahead he’ll be chosen to fill it.
Australian Actors.
“In our profession it is difficult to know enough, and you can never
know too much. As a young man, when I was not engaged in a piece,
I used to go round to the other theatres, wherever I happened to be:
picking up an idea here, a wrinkle there, or storing away a little bit of
business for future use: watching the other fellows take a part and
deciding how I would take it if I got the chance, and so on; and, what
is most important, studying what to avoid in order to correct my faults.
Australian actors have great talent naturally—and, mind you, I’m not
making any sweeping condemnation; but I do think that it may fairly
be said that some are deficient in application, deficient in painstaking
ambition, too apt to forget that stage laurels will fade if they are not
continually refreshed by new achievements. It seems to be the fault
of the country. Things ripen too quickly. The fruit ripens quickly,
the crops mature quickly—but the harvests are irregular.
“In what I have said of Australian actors I allow for exceptions, of
course. But I’m speaking to you frankly, as you asked me; and speak-


ing with all kindness, because a manager in his own interest always
wishes to help people on if they’ll give him a chance—and some Aus-
tralian actors don't give the manager chance enough. They don’t
exhibit the qualities that make a manager say, ‘This fellow is ambi-
tious; he works hard, he takes his present part well —he is taking
trouble to fit himself for better parts. That’s the man I want.’
Managers in Australia never get enough of that class of Australian
actor.
“The women are better in that way. They work harder, and they
work more persistently. Then they seem quicker and more adaptable.
If you think of all the good Australian actresses we’ve had—though
I needn’t mention any names—you will see my point. They have
talent as well as the men,
and they stick more
closely to their profes-
sion. There’s any amount
of talent, but often it is
not talent that perseveres.
And as I’ve said that, I
ought to say, too, what
good colleagues I have
found in Australian ac-
tors, actresses and sing-
ers ; what fine support.
When they are interested
they don’t spare them-
selves in their efforts to
help, and their natural
aptitude is so great that
they learn very quickly.
What I would like them
to do is to maintain their
interest and their effort
all the time, because my
experience teaches me that’s essential. As soon as you let go in our
profession, you lose ground.


Advice to Players.
“Let me show you in one of my old scrap-books a notice which I
have always treasured and many times referred to with pride when
thinking over old times. It was written by Augustin Daly over 41
years ago, when he was one of the leading dramatic critics on the New
York press. He afterwards became, as you know, America’s leading
manager, and succeeded to the position formerly occupied by the
Wallacks.
(This is portion of the article referred to by Mr. Williamson.)
‘Room for the Little People of the Stage! Make way there! and
let us bow in the third and fourth rate actors, who, as ‘lords,’ ‘gentle-
men,’ ‘Marcellus and Bernardo,’ or ‘Catesby’ and the ‘Lieutenant of the
Tower,’ have so often in their turn bowed in the Star of the evening.
‘The first-rate actors have their chroniclers; the second-rate
actresses have their flatterers; who shall be the historians of the
neglected ones of the lower grade? Shall we not lift them from the
small notoriety of their favourite porter-house, and make them proud
of something more than the awful admiration of dirty little boys along
the street?
‘ls not the 'utility' man worthy of honourable mention beside
his distinguished co-labourers on the stage ?
‘Let us see.
Tn the first place, the position of the fourth-rate actor demands
of him the following qualities: Great versatility—for he must be one
night a comedian of the old school, then a gay fellow of the genteeler
comedy, then a nobler patriot of the ante-Christian era, then a respect-
able tragedian of the modern period, then a howling bandit in a cavern,

‘Great application—for he must study hundreds of new parts in
the course of the year;
‘Great patience —for he must wait and wait and bide his time for
advancement through many weary seasons;
‘Great hopefulness—for he must never despair;


‘Great amiability—for he must endure the insults of stars and
the jeers of his equals.
‘ln fact—it requires more real ability to be a fourth-rate actor
with his ceaseless and unnoticed labours, than to be a distinguished
star who has half-a-dozen stage pieces, which he enacts all the year
round, and who sees his name constantly mentioned in the papers.
‘lt is a matter of congratulation that we are now having a better
class of people in the humbler roles. If every stage only had a compe-
tent manager, to assist in developing the young talents, many famous
actors might be made of the staff at present under command.
‘As it is, Mr. Williamson, of Wallack’s company, Mr. Burrows,
of the Winter Garden, and Mr. Rockwell, of the Olympic promise (if
their modesty continues) to be actors of no mean order five years hence.
But Mr. Williamson will be better than them all—not because he is more
ambitious—-but because he is more attentive and less vain!
‘Will the little people of the drama take some brief advice?
‘Give as much time to your dressing as a great actor gives to his.
When Florence, the comedian, was a utility man he used to make his
own dresses and wigs for every little part he played—in order to look
the character he was cast for. Florence was only a poor boy, too, and
had to stint himself to do it.
‘Never be ashamed, when on the stage in the presence of a ‘star,’
to speak your lines with the emphasis you shall have studied in your
own chamber.
‘Do not spend your leisure in idleness with those on whose level
you now are, but retire early to your homes and study for a higher
position.
‘Do not criticise the actor above you in the discontented circles
of the green room, but try and learn from him how to be as good or
as great as he.
‘Fleury, the greatest of French comedians, when in his glory
under the Empire, one night consented to play a part of but one scene,
and in which he had but five words to speak. It was that of an insig-
nificant old seigneur, to whom an appeal is made by a poor woman
whose husband upon their wedding day is under arrest. Fleury seemed
to listen to her at first, with the indifference with which a nobleman


usually receives the applications of such rude and ignorant peasants as
she pretended to be; then all at once struck with the dignity of her
manner and sentiments he fixed his eyes upon her, and while continuing
to listen, as if by instinctive, almost involuntary movement, his hand
was raised by degrees to his hat, which he finally raised from his head
and lowered before her as if mechanically. When the wife was done
speaking the old man was in the attitude of most respectful obeisance.
The pantomime was so true, so delicate—it e xpressed so naturally the
feeling of respect and surprise at finding the woman so superior to
what she seemed, that the effort was electrical, and Fleury, who had
not spoken a single word, was greeted with the most tumultuous
applause.
‘A poor devil of an actor, who usually took the part, could not
understand this at all: ‘Only see,’ said he, ‘what prejudice does.’
‘Fleury got three rounds of applause just for taking off his hat; and I
never got any applause in the part —and yet I never move my hat at all.’
‘But this is one thing the Little People must learn, above all, and
remember—that if actors deserve it the public will reward them whether
they are ‘stars’ or not.
‘Always ask yourself what such or such a character would be apt
to do in real life and govern yourself accordingly—never forgetting
that in real life the simple message of a servant conveying important
news is always as impressive as the circumstances justify.
‘When a servant says, ‘Sir, your carriage is waiting,’ he will, of
course, do so in a business-like way. But should he have to announce,
‘Sir, your son is dead,’ in real life, he would undoubtedly exhibit as
much real concern in face and voice as the person whom he represents
would be likely to feel. This simple illustration presents the case.
‘Know the object of what you have to say, and ordinary discretion
will suggest the mode of saying it.
‘Since we have no school of acting whence professionals may
graduate, every humble performer must make his closet his college and
tutor himself. With his looking-glass, his book, and a good deal of
diligent observation and thought, every actor may be an artist, but it




is equally certain that with foolish company, and discontented mind
and disordered life—every drudge will remain such to his dying day.’
“I think those remarks are well worth a young actor-’s study.
“Australian children are wonderfully gifted. There are no brighter
children on the stage to be found anywhere. Go and see the children
dancing in the Pantomime now: it’s a pleasure to watch how well and
heartily they do it.
Australian Drama.
“About Australian drama? Room for it? Of course there is
room for it. Hundreds, I might almost say thousands, of plays have
been submitted to me, but the authors are either too literary, or they
forget the prime requisites of a play. What are those? Well, a good
play must have heart interest. It must hit the audience below the collar
button. And it must have head: it must have a good plot, and not
be intellectually below contempt. And in the third place it must admit
of an appeal to the eye. Perhaps I should have put these qualities in
the reverse order. The audience has first to be pleased through the
eye; then it must have the appeal to the heart; and then there should
be sufficient plot, sufficient intelligence, to leave a pleasant after-taste
in memory.
“If you look over all the plays that have been great successes, right
from the very beginning, you will find that all have these qualities.
There must be the love interest, there must be the plot, and the language
must not be above the head of the average playgoer. People go to the
theatre as a distraction, as an amusement, as a relaxation after the
toil of the day, so that they can drop their burdens and forget their
troubles for a little while. They do not go to be instructed, or to
be puzzled, or to be bored —and, being human beings, the same human
qualities appeal to them generation after generation. Take any play
that has been a striking success-—take The Silver King. That shows
you what I mean. We can revive that play time after time, and always
to good audiences. It has the love interest, it has the plot, and it is not
a stupid play—though it does not profess to deal in problems. There


is the child interest in it which always appeals to an audience, and it
admits of being well staged so that it attracts the eye.
Where Local Drama Fails.
“So far Australian drama has failed to give ns these things, or to
put them in the right way. Certainly an Australian play could be made
like In Miss our a, but not so well, because in Australia the types have
not crystallised yet. America has been longer settled, and the Dutch-
man, the Negro, the Yankee, the Irishman, have all become well-known
types of national life. In Australia it is not so, to the same extent.
“Struck Oil is another play of the kind I mean. There is the old
father—simple, honest, shrewd, and kindly, and his happy laughing
daughter. You see them together —father and child. The man goes
away to and Deacon Skinner comes in—the villain of the
piece—the same old villain that you find in a hundred pieces. There
seems to be nothing extraordinary in the story, yet that play always
holds the audience, because it is sincere, because it is human, because
it is true. Those are the keynotes of the play that lasts—humanity,
sincerity, truth.
“Of course, there have been some fair Australian plays. Alfred
Dampier did well with His Natural Life and Robbery Under Arms;
and those are typical Australian plays. Very good in their way, no
doubt, and in a sense representative. The fault I find with them is
that they always bring in the revolver. That is always introduced
when the dramatist gets in a difficulty. There is the bushranger, the
heroine, and the villain, and they get along all right up to a certain
point —then somebody must be shot in order to clear the air and let
the play proceed. That seems to me to show a certain poverty of
invention. A play should go easily and naturally, and nothing out-
rageous should occur in it. I suppose in convict and bushranging days
the revolver episode was the natural thing; but it isn’t the natural
thing now, and I don't see why it should be characteristic of Australian
drama. The Sunny South was another very good play of George
Darrell’s —his best, I think. That was Australian; and there again—
he had to use the revolver.


The Way to Write a Play.
‘•'Well, your authors have got to write better before they will make
a really successful play. The way seems obvious, and yet they don t
manage it. Authors bring plays to me; I have taken lots of trouble
with some of them; and I’ve pointed out this thing and that which
my experience tells me must be altered. They always profess them-
selves quite ready to alter and improve—always glad of suggestions,
and so on —but somehow they don't carry out the suggestions. They
take the play away and bring it back, revised, but the faults are there
just as before. It almost seems as if it wanted two men to write an
Australian play, one to create it, and another to put it into shape for
the stage. In the case of The Silver King the two authors had the
valuable assistance of the technical knowledge and stagecraft of Wilson
Barrett.
“Perhaps that is why so many journalists fail. Their ideas are
good enough, their language is good enough—sometimes a little bit
too good —but it isn’t the kind that tells on the stage, and they don t
get the situations right. Then, they don't seem to me to take enough
trouble at the beginning. Now, I have had good authors under contract
to me to write plays —Dion Boucicault and W. S. Gilbert, for example
—and I know something of the way they set about it. I was par-
ticularly impressed with the trouble Gilbert took with his scenario: it
was almost as long as the play. He wrote the scenario first to get his
general effect, his main points, and his leading situations; and he spared
no pains to put everything in the exact place where it was wanted for
stage representation. It was only after he had made a scenario that
would act that he set to work and wrote the play, filling in the language,
creating the characters, and polishing every line until, in any play of
Gilbert's, you will find that there is very little that can be dispensed
with—very little indeed that can be cut with advantage. The reason
is, as I say, that he has his careful scenario behind his language; his
play is built before it is decorated.
Words and Plot
“A drama may be literature, but the words are not the essential
thing about it. The essential thing is that it should live and move like


a piece of real life —and that depends on the construction. Words are
only the clothes, the dress of the drama itself. Struck Oil, for example,
was in a great measure written upon the stage, as you might say. My
part wasn’t even committed to paper until we had taken it all round
Australia. We used what we call a skeleton manuscript, with only the
cues given, and one night a good phrase would occur, another night
we would invent a little bit of business, and so on, until the whole thing
was different from the play as conceived by the original writer. But,
mind you, behind the whole there was always the living interest—the
heart-interest that I have spoken of. That must be the basis of a really
successful play: that is what gives it vitality. Then the play must be
built so that this interest can be effectively displayed, and last of all
you drape it with words to interpret the interest and construction to the
audience.
“Australian authors usually seem to go the other way about. They
write the words, and as long as the thing makes a continuous story,
and the language is good, they seem to think the play is all right. But
all they do in most cases is to dress a lay figure. You have to start
from the other end—start from human emotions, human instincts, and
base your plot on them, and only when you’re sure you have the play,
and the interest of the play, and the construction of the play, go on to
the language. In real living drama the language is the last thing to think
about.
The First Act.
“Another thing about a play is that when you get a good one it
goes of itself, it unfolds itself. I agree that the last act should always
be the strongest: too much strength in the first act is a mistake—because
you can’t live up to it. I remember a very interesting example of that
in a New York theatre. There was a play of Dion Boucicault’s—l
think it was The Shenandoah. The first act simply amazed the
audience —they couldn’t contain themselves. They applauded and
applauded. The stage manager came round to Boucicault in a great
state of excitement. ‘We’ve got them this time, Mr. Boucicault.’
‘No,’ says Boucicault, ‘no.’ ‘What?’ said the other fellow. ‘What?
don’t you hear that applause ?’ ‘No,’ says Boucicault, ‘we’re done.
The play’s a failure. That first act is too strong.’ And it turned out


exactly as he said. The play could not live up to the first act, and it
never succeeded. That shows you how stage experience and stage in-
sight come in. Of course the elder Bo'ucicault was a very clever man,
one of the very cleverest men that have been connected with the modern
stage. He was a great author, he was a great actor, and he was a great
stage manager- —a man with great ideas. ■*-
“It is always difficult to foretell the success or failure of a play
from the first act, and when I am telegraphing to my partners after the
first act of a first performance I am always very careful to add some
qualifying words. Sometimes the first act appears to go very well
indeed, but you can’t trust it. In order to be quite sure, you have to
wait. There is something in the attitude of an audience that tells you
things are going right, or they are not going right, some magnetism,
quite apart from the obvious signs. I mean by obvious signs, for
example, an audience coughing, or things like that. When you hear a
few little coughs, that clearing of the throat, you have to pay atten-
tion ; something’s going wrong. The play’s not holding the attention of
the audience. The man in the chair has lost interest, and as soon as he
ceases to be absorbed with the stage he turns his head away and gives
that little cough —the manager's danger-signal.
The Verdict of the Audience.
A very curious thing is the way in which intelligence about a play
is communicated. You produce a play on Saturday night. Everything
appears to go well, and yet you’re not convinced. The audience separate
and go away, and then—the fate of the play is settled between Saturday
night and Monday night. Perhaps you get flourishing notices in the
papers on Monday morning, after a first-rate house on Saturday night,
and yet Monday morning’s booking falls off, and Monday night’s house
drops to half, and the play does not run. It has failed to hit them,
somehow. The people settle it going home in the trams, or when they
meet on Sunday; I don’t know how. Time and again that has hap-
pened. A successful Saturday night; first-rate press notices on
Monday; and on Monday night—the audience missing! They’ve given
their verdict going home in the trams, and the air has carried it like
microbes


“Captain Swift was a case like that. We opened in Captain Swift
at the Princess's in Melbourne. It seemed a good play, with popular
Charles Warner in the title role; it had a splendid reception, got
splendid notices in the papers; and yet there was a poor house on
Monday night; and it only ran a fortnight. In England a manager
has time to recast and re-model his plays, and so he can convert a
failure into a success. Several of George Edwardes’ musical comedies
have been first-night failures. The audience simply wouldn’t stand
them—but he has improved them night by night, and turned them into
success. In Australia we can’t do that, because the average run of a
piece doesn’t give us time. In London people keep on going to the
house, and there is population enough to give the manager a chance at
mending.
English and Australian Audiences.
“Perhaps English audiences are creatures of habit to a greater
extent than Australian. They get used to an actor; they get used
to a theatre ; and as long as that actor and that theatre are abovO
ground they will never leave them if they can help it. The Australian
audience wants the actor and the theatre to justify themselves every
time. If an actor fails in a new part, it doesn’t matter how often he’s
succeeded before; the audience stay away until the actor or the theatre
offers them something better. Australian audiences are hard to please
in that way. They’ve been used to the best things, and they want the
best things all the time.
“You can be sure that sooner or later an Australian author will
make a good play on the lines I’ve suggested, and if it is good the
Australian audience will soon let him know. You can trust their
judgment, you can trust their appreciation. I have mentioned two or
three Australian plays; we have had one or two good musical dramas
like Tapu, with bright, original music; and I think that our pantomimes,
such as Djin Djin and Matsa, will bear comparison with anything of
the kind done anywhere. And in Parsifal, just now, you have a suc-
cessful play that’s made right on the Australian premises—our own
scenery, our own scenic artists, our own costumes, as well as our own
play. The whole thing is done here. In London it is quite different.
A theatrical manager sends for his costumes to one place, for his


scenery to another, and so on. I don't suppose there is a London
theatre that employs a permanent staff of scenic artists. Here we have
to do everything, as I say, on the premises.
“Australian audiences are in many ways the best in the world.
They are most difficult to please, for the reason that they have been
accustomed to nothing but the best. Almost every play is tried in
London or New York before it is staged here, and you never see the
failures. You get scenery and costumes as good as London’s, and
you get the most attractive plays. So audiences have naturally a high
standard, and when a manager falls below that standard they are apt
to complain. On the other hand, when they are pleased they support
you well. They are very intelligent, very responsive, and very ready
to excuse accidental shortcomings. When they do not like a play they
do not hiss or make a row, they simply stay away —and they stay away
with very great unanimity.
An Actor and His Part
“When the Australian audience likes you the applause is very
genuine. It’s a great thing to feel that you have an audience in your
hands, and that their emotions respond directly to those you are
portraying. The part I myself like best is the part which gives you
an opportunity to make an audience cry one minute and laugh the
next. ‘John Stofel’ is such a part, and ‘Rip Van Winkle.' The scene
where the old man is trying to recall himself to his daughter’s memory,
I have always considered a test of the strength of my acting. I’ve
never failed in that part to make tne actress who was taking the
daughter’s part cry —really cry. Never but once —the exception was
a woman who paid no attention at all: she might just as well have
been eating lollies. She wasn’t really concentrating her attention on
the business of the piece. So I said to her one day, ‘Why don’t you
wake up and listen to what is going on? Surely you have feelings:
surely you understand the scene ?’ After that she did pay a little more
attention, and she did feel the pathos. Before she had been letting her
mind wander, with the result that I could not touch her at all.
“An actor, I think, must keep control of himself. He must not
let himself, as people say, be ‘carried away by the part,’ for the result is


that he ceases to play the part. He is merely himself. But you can
feel a part intensely, and still remain in full possession of your facul-
ties. You can realise the way the thing is going/and watch it, and
decide how it shall go. To lose control so far that you forget you are
on the stage at all —well, I doubt if it ever happens; and if it did
happen, I should think the actor had made a mistake. He is there to
act the part, and if he forgets that he forgets the reason of his presence
on the stage.
Stage Aspirants and “Twang,’
“One thing I do not like to notice, and it is a thing I have re-
marked about before: that is the twang that so many Australian
children are growing up with. To my mind it is the result of simple
carelessness. The children are not taught at school or at home to speak
with the proper intonation. At the school, of course, the teachers may
he as bad as the scholars. I think parents are at fault for not correcting
their children in the home; I think teachers are at fault for not correct-
ing the children in the school; and I think the Government is at fault
for not correcting the teachers—for not saying that the first qualifica-
tion of the teacher should be that he can speak correctly the language
he is using. Government should insist that teachers are properly
trained before they become teachers at all.
“I hear this twang, of course, very frequently in the girls that come
to me and offer to sing or act. So many of them have charming voices
and excellent qualifications otherwise, if they would only speak cor-
rectly. Many, lam sorry to say, have no qualifications at all ; and I
think that girls who are aiming at a stage career should at the very
outset of their training see somebody who would tell them this—some-
body who would be able to say decisively that their voice, or their age,
or their appearance disqualifies them for the stage. That would save
many of them from wasting years at work which they ought never
to have undertaken.
Some Old Parts
“My favourite part —well, I can’t tell you that—l’ve succeeded in
many. ‘John Stofel' in Struck Oil was a very good part, of course;


and that part of ‘Sim’ in Wild Oats was very popular in its day.
Then I loved to play ‘Dick Swiveller,’ ‘Kerry/ ‘Rip Van Winkle/ and
lots of other parts which blended pathos and comedy. I can remember
the first big round of applause I ever got—it was when as a boy of
sixteen I took the part of ‘Ross’ in Macbeth, and was applauded for
the lines of Ross’s reply to Macduff: ‘stands Scotland where it did?’
Alas ! poor country ;
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be call’d our mother, but our grave ; where nothing,
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
Are made, not mark’d ; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy ; the dead men’s knell
Is there scarce ask’d for who ; and good men s lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or e’er they sicken.
“That seems a very long time ago now, and indeed it is a long time
since I thought about these things at all. Theatrical management
keeps you too busy for personal recollections. It’s not alone keeping
the companies going—though that is no light task in itself —but some-
times I have to take part in stage management. In Parsifal, for ex-
ample, I staged the play and invented things as I went along. Then
there is the continual labour of keeping in touch in order to be up-to-
date. Weekly letters come from our agents in London and New York
telling us what is going on there, and these have to be carefully con-
sidered. You have to keep an eye open for new men —for rising talent
both in the field of authors and in the acting field. You have to see
not only that the whole machine works, but that every part of it works
so well that there is the least possible friction.
A Manager’s Responsibilitju
“And then you keep a general look-out on what’s going on around
you. Often I come home from my office and bring my work with me,
and my secretary to deal with a heap of correspondence that can’t be
crammed into the day; and then, maybe, it s necessary to sit up till two
or three in the morning reading plays, or looking over the English and
American dramatic papers, so as to miss nothing that will be of service.
It requires constant watchfulness to keep you from falling behind and


I think I can say that I am well abreast of everything that is doing in
the theatrical world. But the labour it involves!—in addition to the
responsibility and worry. That is what has made me ask myself fre-
quently of late what am I getting out of it all.
“Here I am at 61, still straining at the collar. Well, I haven’t
many more years to play with, and I ask myself should I not try and
get a little leisure. There is no such thing as leisure in management;
the responsibility is always with you. And I think not only of myself,
but of my wife and children. I would like to give my children the
chances which I have often regretted missing for myself. My little
girl Marjorie, for example, whose picture by Eongstaff you see over
yonder—will soon be of an age to travel, and I should like her to see
the best pictures, hear the best music, read the best books, attend the
best theatres, and meet bright, clever people. That, I think, is the best
education a girl can have, and she should have it in her youth when her
mind is receptive.
“And while my children are growing up, I want to be with them.
To me it is the greatest pleasure in life to be in the company of children.
My other little girl had a birthday party in Melbourne the other day;
she is four years old; so all her little friends came to luncheon, and
afterwards went along to the theatre to see Mother Goose —there hap-
pened to be a matinee performance; and I tell you the day I spent with
them, watching them enjoy themselves so heartily, was one of the
pleasantest I can remember. There happened to be a lot of little girls
from the Orphan Asylum up in the gallery; and it was good to watch
them too.
“I’m not complaining. I’m explaining. In many ways I’m a
fortunate man. lam deeply and sincerely grateful to the friends and
partners, and actors and actresses, and other assistants, who have made
my success possible; and I am especially grateful to the Australian
people, who have given me so warm a welcome and have made me one
of themselves. As I told you, I’m still an American, for I don’t think
a man should disown the country he was born in. But I’m Australian
too, and when I have had the long holiday that I feel is necessary to
my family and myself, this is the country I’m coming back to ; this is the
country where I want to live and die.”
The; End.


H OLD ! after all those ardours. Calm ! —whose spell
Stirred such high-tossing tumult. Dead he lies.
Your strife of plaudits shall not raise his eyes
Curtained obedient to the prompter's bell;
And we , his mortal brethren , stay to tell
The part he played\ his merit and his prize ;
Lingering a little span to fling our cries
Beyond the verge of life : Hail , and Farewell !
Let him go hence with mercy : for he gave
Mercy to weaklings , justice to the strong.
Let him go hence with pity : if a wrong
Blotted his right , he knew it ere-his sleeping.
Let him go hence with pride: that over his grave
From harsh old eyes the difficult tears are weeping.


"J.0.W.”: Valedictory.
Mr. GEORGE TALLIS.
“When you have worked in the closest daily association with any
man for over a quarter of a century, the usual expressions of regret for
his death cannot come readily from the tongue. My memories of Mr,
Williamson crowd too fast one upon the
other—recollections of what he did in all
that time and how he did it —all the
associations that directly or indirectly
were his. The whole story of the years is
gliding before me, and I cannot set down
in cold words what I feel.
“A great personality has gone. In
our theatres we shall all miss his acute
perception, his large grasp of all that
appertained to his business: we shall no

less feel the loss of his friendship and his affection for his co-workers,
“One hears a good deal nowadays about “the personal touch. I
doubt whether any man had that in a greater degree than J. C.
Williamson. He was pre-eminently a man to lead, a man to get always-
the best out of everybody associated with him; and I am confident that
for long years his reputation and his achievements will loom large in
the theatrical history of Australasia.”


Mr. HUGH J. WARD.
“As an actor, I admired J. C- Williamson: as a friend I learned to
love him. We met nearly fourteen years ago, when I was playing the
part of ‘Baron Sands’ in a farce, ‘A Stranger in New York,’ at Her
Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney. Mr.
Williamson was looking on from a box.
The passage from the box to the green-
room was part of my way to my dressing
room; and, as I was leaving the stage, he
passed. He put his hand kindly on my
shoulder, and said, ‘A very good per-
formance.’ I thanked him for the com-
pliment, and we parted.
“I am afraid, in the press of years
and work, I forgot the matter. I did not
HUGH J. WARD.
then know how rarely was such praise given by Mr. Williamson. It
was his habit to thank always, but to praise seldom. He did not believe
in indiscriminate praise; he was very jealous for the standards of his
profession; to him a great actor was a great artist. I was not a great
actor; but he praised the work. ‘A very good performance.’
“That meant much to him. If I forgot, he remembered. Years
afterward I learned that he had been watching me —keeping tab. When
I took a company of my own, and went through India and Asia, I
learned later that he had followed the tour, and noticed the results. I
had made good in another capacity —as manager —he noted that for
a time when he might need me. Three years ago the time came. He
offered me the honour of a partnership. I accepted gladly. And I know
now that there was no omitted link in the chain of his judgment that
started from that fortunate performance of an unremarkable part in a
forgotten farce. That was the kind of manager Mr. Williamson was.
He was a master of men.
“What took his eye in that small part was the touch of the ‘legiti-
mate’ drama I gave it. Like himself, I had learned (I hope) to play
farce better in going through the whole range of legitimate drama
beforehand. That suggests another trait; the keen professional eye


his wide experience had given Mr. Williamson. He knew the actor's
profession from A to Z ; he knew the difficulty of acting', and (not in my
case, but always) it delighted him extremely to see work well done.
He watched a performance with the most expert eye, and valued a
hundred little details, small touches, that many even in the profession
would miss.
“Of Mr. Williamson’s acting I saw Tittle, but enough (in ‘Kerry’)
to realise how good and truthful an actor he was. Where he shone, in
my eyes, was in his superb talent for arranging and directing a per-
formance. Management is a difficult business; and we say that only
what you put in the house can you get out of a house. The final judg-
ment, which tells a manager whether he has lost or won, does not
depend on the play, it does not depend on the acting, it depends upon the
acted performance of the play.
“Mr. Williamson, in every given case, knew (it seemed to me)
exactly what made or did not make a performance—exactly what was
wrong or right in the way in which a play was to be presented to the
audience’s verdict. His eye held what I might call the absolute per-
spective of the stage. He knew just what weight, what place, what
balance, everything and every person, every emphasis on every part,
should take in the performance. That, in my opinion, is a very rare
faculty. In the supreme extent to which Mr. Williamson displayed
it, it represents a great natural gift, combined with the fruit of life-
long experience.
“When I joined the firm of J. C. Williamson, I learned gradually
to understand him better ; and I believe I can truly say there was a real
affection between us. I know that my own affection was strong and
sincere. Mr. Williamson, when you knew him, well deserved affection.
He was so much occupied during recent years, and his health was so
uncertain, that I have heard it suggested that he seemed unapproach-
able, aloof.
“That feeling vanished entirely in intimacy. Partly, perhaps, his
manner was born of his long years as a manager; he had found, as
every manager finds, constant occasion to hold himself in check, and not
to risk saying one word which might give rise to a misapprehension


of his meaning. Every large company of players—or of singers—is
continually in need of small adjustments. Grave disturbances are rare,
but small grievances abound, and Mr. Williamson showed particular
tact in making the wheels run smoothly at work. I know he tried to be
the friend—l am sure he was the friend—of every deserving member
of his companies : but he was often placed in the position of a judge,
and he could not always show the full extent of his feeling. When we
talked alone together, he showed a gay and delightful humour, full of
witty observation.
“Partly, perhaps, because we had both ‘gone through the mill.’ I
cannot remember that we had the least difference of opinion that
mattered to our friendship. More and more I relied upon him,
respected him, looked up to him and esteemed him. As a theatrical
manager, he was one of very few. I know none with his combination
of excellent qualities. As a man, he was so close to me that his death
at the summit of his professional career is my great grief and loss.”
Mr GEORGE L. GOODMAN.
“My association with Mr. Williamson commenced in 1880. As his
treasurer, business manager, and until three years ago (when ill-health
forced me to give up the work), in charge of all his private business, I
had opportunities which few have shared
to know how great and how many were
his titles to esteem. I think that every-
body who knew him really well must have
admired and loved him as I did. He was
every inch a man. He always hid his
charity ; and very few know (as 1 know)
how wide and all-embracing that charity
was. With any good excuse, he seemed
glad to give money away; he never, in a
deserving case, let slip an opportunity of
GEORGE L. GOODMAN
showing kindness to the weary, the way-worn, the beaten in the battle of
life. His loyalty to his friends was unfailing: he was like a rock to lean
upon. Losing him is like losing a part of my own life; as helper,
adviser, firm and true friend, no other man can ever take Mr.
Williamson’s place in my mind and heart.”


Mr. HENRY BRAGY.
“Mr. Williamson was my best friend. He was the best friend a
man could have-—the best friend a man could wish for. No other man
now living in Australia knew him so long as I. No other man (save
perhaps Mr. Tallis) could have known
him so intimately as I. I cannot say how
much I miss him. No one can ever re-
place him for me. Just, generous, wise,
far-seeing—he judged himself by a high
standard. It did not matter who the
person was who came to him with a tale of
something wrong—perhaps only a scene-
shifter—he would see him righted.
“I saw his opening night in Mel-
bourne in Struck Oil in 1874, just after
HENRY BRACY.
he came from San Francisco. He was then a young man of 27.
I was 24. I was singing with Lister’s Opera Company. We frater-
nised, and clasped hands never to lose our friendship. He went away
from Australia: I went away. But when, after 15 years, in 1889, I re-
turned to this country, I took my place as producer with Williamson,
Garner, and Musgrove, and have been in the closest touch with Mr.
Williamson ever since.
“He was a good actor, undoubtedly ; but a great manager. I know
no one now his superior—no one his equal—so far-seeing, so expert, so
sure. Sometimes, after we had been rehearsing a piece for three or
four weeks, he would come down and at once put his finger on the weak
place. And he was always right. Sometimes I have made mistakes;
they were mistakes that passed in London; but they did not pass Mr.
Williamson. He was always right.
“His death is the greatest possible blow to me. I am sorry for
Mrs. Williamson and the children. I am sorry for myself. He
was as much as a man could be to me. He was their all. No one
can replace him for us.”


Mr. GEORGE S. TITHERADGE.
“Mr. Williamson brought me to Australia to play The Silver King,
in 1883; and in the years since then I learned very greatly to respect
him as a manager and as a man. His combination of qualities for
theatrical management was highly un-
usual ; in fact, I do not know any other
living manager who possesses them in the
same degree.
“In the first place he was an actor,
and a good actor, with a very wide ex-
perience, and a very considerable
capacity. Then he understood very well
what I call the mechanics of performance.
He knew exactly what means to employ
in order to reach his ends, and I suppose
GEORGE S. TITHERADGE
he was very rarely mistaken in his judgment of plays, and of men. But
beyond these things he was a great organiser, a great strategist, a great
general of the stage. He had wonderful foresight and farsight. His
power of constructive imagination was very highly developed.
“Thus, with one side of his talent, he could see things and plan
them as he wished them to be, and with the other sides of his talent he
could always bring them to pass —executing, after the lapse (we might
even say of years) plans which he had conceived long before, and which
he had the patience and the skill to ripen to maturity.
“That is what struck me —his enormous power of generalisation,
combined with his enormous power over detail. You meet very good
business men, and you meet very good imaginative men, but you very
rarely meet a man who combines far-sighted imagination with the pro-
fessional and business and tactical sides that are necessary to give his
imagination shape in a solid edifice of accomplished results.
“That capacity of Mr. Williamson’s, to be both architect and
builder of his huge theatrical structure, always seemed to me quite
unique. I believe Mr. Williamson really dreamed theatrical things,
like a fairy tale. Then he went to work and created them, perfect to
the last bow on the satin rosettes of the princess’s little shoes.’’

Mr. EDWARD H. MAJOR.
“Mr. Williamson —what a man! what a general! He was known
by his old servants as ‘The Guv’nor-—and how well he filled and played
the part! He was a hard taskmaster, but an appreciative one, and all
his employees gave him that service of
affection which no money can buy.
“He was a staunch friend to every
one in his employ. A keen reader of
men —a strict disciplinarian; yet his em-
ployees always possessed an esprit de
corps seldom seen among such a large
body of people. A camaraderie the more
wonderful because it existed amongst all
sorts and conditions of men —the exigent

“Any man or woman who had the hallmark of J. Williamson in-
Australia was accepted, not only in Australia, but also in England and
America; as witness the positions gained by Australian actors abroad
who had won their spurs under the banner of ‘The Guvnor.'
“As a servant of J. C. Williamson during thirteen yeais, I am a
proud man to have been associated with him —he was loved by all who
came in contact with him—so just, so honourable.
“He was a great man —and a good man. Only those closely in
touch with him, as I have been for the last four years, have any idea of
the extent of his benefactions —as generous as they were secret.
“Standing at the back of the dress circle at Her Majesty’s Theatre
during the performance of ‘Kerry at the Scott matinee--Mi -

“It needed a man with a big heart and a big brain to win the
success he did, and leave no nasty taste in the mouths of people less suc-
cessful than himself. And that was J. C. Williamson—a big-brained
man, and a big-hearted man, as thorough in his friendship as in his
business.”
