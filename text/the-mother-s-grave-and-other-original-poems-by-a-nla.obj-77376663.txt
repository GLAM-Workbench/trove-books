PREFACE.
Dear Reader,?lt may he argued by some into whose hands
this little book may fall, why are we inflicted with a production
of this kind, when ive can be fed upon the dainties supplied in
the exquisitely beautiful works of our standard poets ? To
such I would answer: There are minds to be fed with whole-
some, commendable food, which would starve upon the lofty
grandeur oj Milton, even while admiring his genius.

�HE cheerful sun is going down, calm is the eventide,
And peacefully the villagers their footsteps homeward
guide >
A feeling fraught with sadness comes o?er me with the hour
My spirit droops, though not with pain I feel i s gen e
power. , n r
There is a charm in melancholy?let us wander forth,
And ere the glorious twilight fades, seek our departed
worth, . i n i
Among the silent homes of death our pilgrimage shall be,
To listen to the hallowed voice of truth and piety.
What soft and ernest tones are those now lading on me
Which fill the listener?s wondering breast with reverential
Mark welTthat plain but neat trimm?d grave, and then the
eye can trace , .. ,
A youthful form, on bended knees, beside that resting place.
Mark, too, upon the simple mound, a little rose tree growing,
How low to earth, with fragrant bloom, its little head is
bowing ; . . ,
The hand that placed it there in grief, no sculptured urn
could raise,
But this one truthful epitaph to that fond mother s praise.


Three mournful years have passed away since that fond parent
From H-who watched with anxious care around her dying
Yet oft when silent night steals on, he lingers near her
grave,
And offers up an evening prayer his erring soul to save.
And now he s left to battle on without a mother?s care
She s gone before to meet her God, but left him iany a
prayer ; J
And if there is a spot on earth his fond heart loves the best,
It is the hallowed pillow of that sainted mother?s rest.

A EHYME OF THE TIMES.
Jk MACHINE there is going, and seldom it stops,
? * * n a g or in the back shops :
Its wheels fly round like a train when in motion
And often ? tis noisy and full of commotion.
Whirr-r-r-r, clickity-clack !
List to its song while it speeds on its track 1
What is the matter ?
And why all the clatter ?
A maid will be wedded to-morrow I trow ?
Some -fingers are weary, but on I must go.*
Whirr-r-r-r, clickity-clack I
A robe must be finished her bridal to deck.


My bobbin is covered with fine silken thread ;
And all the night long, while you sleep in your bed,
A small dainty foot is pressing my treadle,
And bright sleepy eyes keep watch o?er my needle.
Whirr-r-r-r, ! Whirr-r-r-r !
One penny per yard and don?t reckon the fur.
What is the matter ?
And why all the clatter ?
To-morrow is Cup-day, and Lady M?Withers,
Bedizn?d in lace and decked out in feathers,
Will pay the old chap for my clickity-clack,
And bright golden guineas will follow my track.
Whirr-r-r-r, clickity clack !
Like a swift-winged bird I?m off in a crack ;
My speed is too fleet for a low sporting range ;
I cry for no quarter, nor fear any change.
Buy me or hire me,
You never can tire me,
I work for the noble, the wealthy, and gay,
Or any one else who will honestly pay.
What is the matter ?
And why all the clatter ?
The winter is coming, the cupboard is bare?
Keep oil in my couplings, I?ll fly through the air.
Whirr-r-r-r,! whirr-r-r-r!
I am working to-day for the aged and poor.
Live and let live?there is room for us all ;
And the proud and the haughty come down with a fall,
I shirk not my duty,
For worth is my beauty.


My labour is earnest, my time is well-spent ;
I work for the master with zealous intent.
There is plenty of matter
To cause all my clatter?
The sick and the wounded are ready to die ;
Fresh bedding is wanted, and places to lie.
In a neat little cottage, styled College-lawn Villa,
Whose garden can boast of a fine gladiola,
Where the pinus insignis fills up all the corners,
And things are all done as her ladyship orders.
Whirr-r-r-r ! whirr-r-r-r !
I?m christened ? The Noiseless,? and yet I am here.
The fact?s in the matter,
I?m done with all clatter;
Mounted with ivory and richly inlaid,
The pride of the mistress and young parlour-maid ;
My parts are anointed, and shining, and clean?
A beautiful thing is the sewing machine.

WOULDST thou live to be remember?d
When the evening sun has set,
And leave a cherished name behind thee,
Friend or foe will not forget ?
Grave no mark on gilded tablet,
Deeply cut with finest steel ;
Write upon thy neighbour?s feeling
All the love thy soul can feel.


Not the deed of might can raise thee
In the honest truthful mind ;
The hero of a hundred battles
Soon or late this truth will find?
Only good and worthy actions
Gain a conquest o?er the soul ;
All the wise and good observe them
Pointing upward to their goal.
Better than the world should praise thee,
Shouldst thou win thy brother?s love,
Is the welcome that awaits thee
In a brighter world above.
Let no cross, however weighty,
Crush thee in its mighty test,
All who?ve entered heaven before thee
Bravely toiled to enter rest.
Cjp Pome of gfe gojjjjoofc.
SN a pleasant little village in the fertile vale of Kent,
Was the home of happy childhood where my boyhood s
days were spent ;
Where the Medway takes its winding course thro many a
shady grove, ,
And the woodland songster tunes his note and tells his tale
of love.


From the noisy city far away, and yet not so remote
But one might see the old church tower, and hear the
cuckoo?s note ;
Where the pleasant sound of Sabbath bells would often greet
the ear,
O?er the water?s wafting sweetly their melody so clear.
Oh, how I loved the beautiful, in man and nature too ;
Where?er a noble deed was done, it made my young heart
glow ;
Where?er a lovely spot was found, my soul would seek the
place,
Enchanted with the beauty of nature?s smiling face.
I knew a little murmuring brook which cross'd the woodland
dell,
Where grew the scented violet?l remember it full well ;
For oft in coming home from school, fatigued with summer?s
heat,
We loitered by the cooling stream, and sailed our mimic
fleet.
I never thought that care would come, with stern and
wrinkled brow,
And mingle in my pleasant cup the draught I?m drinking
now !
Behind the curtain of my fate, could I have raised the veil,
An unseen hand was writing there decrees which never
fail.


Oh, how I miss those lovely scenes which graced the morn of
life,
For now the world?s a battle field, with much of toil and
strife ;
And sweetly comes the Sabbath morn, with rest unto my
soul,
To sing the great Creator?s praise, whose hand hath made
the whole.
Not that I shun the just decree which rests upon my head?
From morn till night with honest sweat I toil for daily
bread?
But oh, I feel a stern dislike to heathen laws that bind
A heavy burden on the hack, and slight the nobler mind.
Witter.
�OMETH Winter, stern and gloomy,
Stripping hare the forest tree.
Sheep are huddling close together,
Winds blow chilly o?er the lea ;
Sweets of nature?s milder seasons
Now their varied charms decline,
Gone are the birds from glade and woodland,
Songsters of the sweet wild chime.


Where are now those lovely flow?rets.
Blossoms whose perfume we love ?
Gone the rose and woodbine?s fragrance ;
No green leaves to deck the grove.
Rural haunts no longer tempt us,
From the firesides cheering ray,
Pleasant rambles through the meadows,
Vanished with an autumn day.
Yet I love thee, winter, dearly,
Covered in thy coat of snow,
Bringing friends around my ingle,
Rivalling the fire-side glow.
Bpeakest thou with voice of wisdom?
Mourn not o?er the lonely past ;
Cling not to the joys that perish,
God?s own truth alone shall last.

ON HER MOTHER?S PICTURE
SPHERE?S a picture that hangs o?er the old mantle-
@@ shelf,
And my father oft tells me it looks like myself ;
I had long wish?d to know whose sweet face it could be,
Till one day he revealed the fond secret to me.


I have watched him and seen him look np to the frame,
Then have heard him pronounce to himself my own name
I have kissed him when sad, for it grieved me to see
How he wept while he talked of things unknown to me.
I have grown up since then, and my father has said
Ev?ry day I grow like my own mother that?s dead ;
Oh, I felt a sad pride when he told me himself
?Twas my own mother?s likeness that hung o?er she shelf.
I know now the reason he kept it from me,
When I wonder?d so much whose sweet face it could be ;
For he knew I should grieve in the friend I had lost,
And he was not deceiv?d in the grief it has cost.
I can see his form wasting, and ev?ry day brings
A cold chill o?er my heart, when I think of such things ;
For I know that my father must leave me himself,
Like the sweet one whose image hangs over the shelf.
The flowers will bloom sweetly o?er woodland and dell,
And the birds of the forest their gladness will tell;
But I shall be lonely when father is gone,
And long for the home where no sorrow can come.
Cjie �ribge obtx % Stream.
�H, don?t you remember the bridge o?er the stream
Where we gamboll?d in infancy ?


And the small narrow ledge which our feet had to climb,
To leap to the old walnut tree ?
For years the old bridge by its pillar?s was stay?d,
But at last it has gone to decay ;
Yet still we are found in the pathway of life,
With our hair getting silvered and grey.
And don?t you remember the fishes we caught,
With only a pin for a hook ?
The stream was but shallow, the fish they were small,
But seldom the bait was forsook.
How strangely I feel when I think of the past,
Over trifles as light as the air !
For life is a stream that grows deeper and swift,
And pleasure is mingled with care.
Through rich scented meadow the streamlet ran on,
Where the kingcup grew in his pride,
And the edges of hawthorn grew thickly and tall,
Where the mowers at noon-day would hide.
Old Time with his scythe gleaming bright in the sun,
Has left us a space to recall,
For the blade and the stalk are fit emblems of life,
And the shadows around us will fall.
But there is a river whose waters are dark,
And we all must come down to its edge,
Though we gambol awhile in the morning of life,
Far away from its slippery ledge.
We know not the moment our summons may come,
For we?re passing away like a dream?
Then let us be sure that we find out the bridge,
That will carry us over the stream. *

SIMPLE mound of earth now hides our darling child,
That fairy form which haunts me still, those eyes so
blue and mild ;
And sweet wild flowers are blooming o?er the form we loved
so well,
Yet how we loved our infant child, these humble lines mav
tell. J
"With little Mary, side by side, we made her early grave,
The sister whom she never knew?we strove so hard to
save?
But he who gives the gentle life to ev?ry tender flower,
Made angels of our children both in life?s sweet morning
hour. 8
Those speaking eyes are closed in sleep, and silent is the
tongue,
Which like a little silver bell once on the senses rung 5
Yet often in my quiet hours I?m living o?er and o?er, & ?
The memory of my cherish?d ones, who now are gone before.
I open with a trembling hand, and eyelids wet with tears,
The treasures of a little store which I have kept for
And there among the silken locks of shining golden hair *
My blue-eyed infant lives again?l see my darling there.


How hard it was to give her up, ye who are parents know,
For there are some whose winning ways we never can forego ;
.And when the hope of meeting in a brighter world above,
Is blooming in our longing hearts, ?tis no sin thus to love.
'Oh, what a meeting that will be, when all life?s trials are
o?er,
Not one of them will be left out of all those gone before ;
I would not wish them back again into a world of sin,
"Those guardian angels of my life who help my crown to
win.

$ REMEMBER the brook, with its murmuring rill,
That drove the wheel-head of the old ivy mill
Where the stately old swan sallied over the stream,
And the water-cress grew with the trout and the bream ;
And I ought to remember the damsel so fair,
That dwelt on its banks with her innocent air,
Who bade me good morn as I went to my toil,
With a sweet native grace that fine manners would spoil
1 remember the cottage with ivy-clad roof,
That weather?d all seasons in fine waterproof,


With the orchard and stile at the end of the lane,
And often I wonder if things are the same ;
I know that the meadows with cowslips abound,
That nature is true as the seasons comes round,
And that spring will renew the sweet orchard bloom,
When man with his labour is laid in the tomb.
The stream will flow on when the old wheel is dry,
And the brook, in its freshness, go murmuring by ;
But the dairy so clean kept will have a new maid,
And some other cow will be under the shed.
Then let me frugal, and gather life?s flowers,
Which bloom by the way in all seasons and horn?s,
And let my whole life with a meaning be pass?d
Till, like the old wheel, I am time-worn at last.

Christmas in old England now
tfe The holly and the mistletoe
Are hung in cot and hall!
Old forms and faces greet each other,
The absent friend, the long-lost brother,
Are now within our call!
Let us be happy in its sway,
And bless the memory of the day
That bids our heart rejoice !

Wc hail thy universal call,
And join with heart and voice !


Who has not some old tale to tell,
To make the bosom heave and swell
In memory of the past ?
Some tale of friendship firmly proved,
Of love repaid, or sorrow soothed?
A theme that long shall last.
Bring in the old-time honoured log,
?Twill serve our sympathies to jog,
And keep them wide-awake 1
And while we taste the bounteous cheer.
Or share the goodness of the year,
We?ll hearken to the gate!
A mother awaits us thinly clad,
A mournful sister, brother sad,
Our bounty to entreat ;
And shall we close our hearts to day,
Or send them shivering away,
Where frost and sorrows meet ?
Oh, ye who throng the festive scene,
Where wealth reflects its golden sheen,
Pause in your mazy dance !
Remember hundreds breathe to-day,
Who crave the food you fling away,
A-while you are entranc?d!

WHEN countless multitudes in days of old,
About the pathway of the Great Redeemer throng d,.
Among the blessings which he then foretold,
This to the glorious catalogue belong?d ;


When thou a feast shall make, invite not those
Whose aim will be a grand return to give ;
But let thy act of charity disclose,
Arid show that love doth in thy bosom live.
Call not the rich, but let the helpless poor,
Struggling beneath their load, thy bounty share :
The blind, the halt, the maimed, are at the door ;
?Tis such as these will need thy tender care !
And when the day of reckoning comes, thou?lt find
A rich reward in Heaven will be thy share :
That not to these alone thy heart inclin?d,
But for My sake thou did?st a burden bear.
WE are a little hopeful band,
United firm in heart and hand,
The good we choose, the bad withstand,
Our motto, ? Onward ever ; ?
Nor can temptation turn astray
Our feet from wisdom?s pleasant way,
While we have strength to watch and pray.
Our band shall hold together.


The drunkard?s cup we never know,
His cup so full of bitter woe,
We pledge ourselves as on we go,
To touch it not forever ;
And while our God shall give us light,
We mean against all sin to fight,
And pray that He may guide us right.
And keep us all together.
Summer.
�LOYE to spend some summer hours,
Among the pleasant woods and flowers
Or on a mossy bank to lie,
And hear the streamlet gurgling by,
Happy, heedless, careless, free;
Underneath the greenwood tree.
1 have a right that nature yields,
To jump the style, and roam the fields,
Or climb the glorious mountain height,
Till almost giddy with the sight,
Happy, heedless, careless, free,
Beneath the vaulted canopy.
Or where the foaming ocean laves
The glittering strand with crested waves,


Awed by its majesty and power,
There I would spend a fruitful hour,
Happy, thoughtful, reverent, free,
Breathing health and liberty.
The workshop claims of toil a share,
The glittering mine with poison?d air,
Has buried many a stalwart form,
And palsied many a brawny arm ;
But all should have a space to see
The glorious sunlight streaming free.
mittful Spring.
SPRING-TIME is coming,
My heart shall rejoice,
And with a glad welcome
I?ll lift up my voice ;
Meadow and woodland
Soon loudly will ring,
Rejoicing in gladness
For beautiful Spring.
Spring time is coming
To gladden the year,
The sweet-scented blosoom
Will shortly appear ;


Pure as a virgin
And fresh as a child,
The breath of the morning
Will always be mild.
Spring-time is coming,
Already I feel
Its thrill in my visions,
Which soon shall be real
Old age will be sighing
O?er pleasures gone by,
And youth will be longing
New fortune to try.
Spring-time is coming
With balm in its train ;
The sick and the weary
Will rise up again ;
Oh, pause on its threshold,
Your offering to bring,
And welcome with gladness
The beautiful Spring.


SONNETS.

SUGGESTED BY A VISIT TO MELBOURNE PUBLIC CEMETERY
on July 5, 1880.
W>HILE round these walks in thoughtful mood I stray
Seeking to gather something for my soul ;
How many aching hearts are here to day.
Mourning for some who have gained a better goal.
And I havc C known that lonely feeling too,
Which nothing else in life can e?er appease !
?Tis only those who feel the trial know
How hard to kiss the rod in times like these.
Thus Jesus at the grave of Lazarus wept,
And groaned in spirit for the loved one dead ;
Although the Saviour knew he only slept,
How beautiful those few drops he shed,
Which show us how the dead can sacred be,
Till crowned we meet them in eternity.

SNTO a little world of precious thought,
The transcript of the great, the wise, and good,
Doth Providence direct ray mind untaught,
With inclination sweet so seek its food ;
Oh, who shall say these gifted minds for nought
With patient labour studied long and late,
When into one vast storehouse they have brought
Treasures of all that?s truly good and great.
Here ev?ry phase of human joy or woe,
With apt description giv?n, some truth reveals ;
Here we may sit and learn what others know ;
Our mind is quicken?d, and our spirit feel
That not in vain the midnight lamp has burn?d,
Where genius penn?d the knowledge we have learn?d.
WHAT art thou, Death, that fills the heart with fear,
Stern monitor of living souls, thy name
With dread solemnity falls on the ear!
A mightier leveller thou?wealth, honour, fame,
Are all alike to thee ; the cherished friend,
The dangerous foe, beneath thy stroke must fall;
Thou bringest all distinction to an end,
When prince and peasant lie beneath the pall ?
Yet art thou not supreme, for in thy wake
Doth follow heaven-born immortality ;


The fruit of life must ev?ry soul partake,
Its growth of sweet or dread reality,
And live again with waken?d joys or fears,
The life immortal, endless in its years.
SCENE I.?SYDNEY EXHIBITION.
STOOD enchanted, with my soul on fire,
(a� In wonderment where Art and Nature met,
So grand the theme, my mind could soar no higher !
So beautiful its memories linger yet ;
And while admiring crowds their tribute paid,
My feeble muse had strung her trembling lyre,
And I essay?d to sing what many said?
This glorious triumph will not soon expire.
I turn?d my eyes from this great feast withdrawn,
And, long upheld, my spirit soar?d away ;
O?er land and ocean swiftly I was borne,
Nor could my fancy for one moment stay,
Until at last it rested right before,
A rustic cottage porch, with open door:
SCENE 2.?THE COTTAGE HOME.
<?fpNSIDE that ? Cottage home,? a scene was laid,
Surpassing all my dreams, however sweet?
Drawn up to catch the gentle breeze which play?d,
There sat an aged dame on pillowed seat ;


Her eyes were upward turn?d?her hope was there?
And soft and sweet a gentle voice I heard?
A damsel worn and sad, but passing fair,
Was meekly reading from the Holy Word ;
I knew that form, I knew that voice so sweet,
I heard that aged parent bless her too,
And as she turn?d, the morning breeze to greet,
Our glances met, and we each other knew,
And then there was another blessing given,
A prayer that angels registered in heaven.
SELOYED Sovereign, Queen of Britain?s Isle,
The glory of thy name I fain would sing ;
How shall I spread thy worth?a son of toil
In simple faith, my artless lay I bring ;
?Tis not that deeds of valor gild thy reign,
My muse, inspired, her highest flights would try ;
The humbler poets sings a gentler strain?
Such notes are for a bard of dignity.
Thou hast, within thyself, a wealth of heart
To win thy people?s love?a soul endued
With heavenly wisdom?this, the better part,
Inspires my pen?Victoria the Good 1
(May that lov?d name in every heart resound)
Long be thy reign, with peace and plenty crowa?fi.


J&amftftfation of % Sabbatlr-
�gfs>OW sweetly dawns the hallowed Sabbath morn,
yiglk) All nature seems to share its holy rest;
The weary sons of toil, fatigued and worn,
Find consolation for the careworn breast.
Hush?d are the sounds of labour, yet there lives
A morning hymn in grove, and flower, and tree,
And with that unseen power the spirit gives,
The heart is turned to sacred melody ;
And can it be that thoughts and scenes like these.
Have not the power to melt the stubborn heart l
Lives there a soul so dead, so hard to win.
That in this holy bliss it shares no part.
O Lord, if such, forgive that sinful man, _
And breathe into his soul Thy life again.

SLOVE to think on childhood?s sunny day,
Of pleasant rambles in the woods and fields ;
Though forty summers since have passed away,
A pleasing solace to my mind it yields ;
My heart was light, for then I knew no care ;
Where primrose beds or violets grew I stray,
And gather posies steep?d in fragrance rare,
Or wanton with the boughs of lovely May j
Lut I have trod a rugged path since then,
My way has been where thorns and brambles grow.


And spring and summer come and go again,
To leave their shadows with a fainter glow ;
Yet I have hope nor storm nor flood can move,
Fix?d with the seal of everlasting love.

And reckon thee amongst my list of friends j
Ay, prouder than the king at whose command?
Beauty and wealth combine to serve his ends ;
?Tis not that nature in her lavist mood,
Hath made tkee beautiful in form and face ;
Thy qualities of heart and mind are good,
In perfect unison with ev?ry grace.
One thing thou lackest yet?let thy warm heart
In streams reflect a dying Saviour?s love,
The virtue of thy life thou wilt impart,
When bless?d with light and wisdom from above,
And every heightened charm thou shalt possess,
Will make thee altogether loveliness.

The day-god?s rising beams at beauteous morn,
The splendid sunset of a summer?s eve,
The awful grandeur of the coming- storm,
Doth on my soul a fix?d impression leave ;
But, oh, how glad and chang?d all nature seems,
When with new-born heart we bound to life ;
The flowers, the trees, the music of the streams,
Each blade of grass with melody is rife,
In praise of Him whose goodness we confess,
The Lord of life, and truth, and righteousness.

WHILE pressing forward always in its might,
Toward the bright unseen, its future home :


My soul hath ever welcom?d with delight,
The growing signs of better things to come ;
No talent given should e?er be misapplied,
The bud unfolding speaks of future bloom,
And ev?ry water we should sow beside,
To make perfection sure in life?s high noon ;
Were I to choose, my guardian angel here
Along life?s chequer?d path my guide should be,
A comforter that should my spirit cheer,
And keep my soul awake from lethargy,
Promoting every good within my power,
And calmly waiting for life?s closing hour.

W HEN dull cold earth shall hide me from thy gaze,
When death?s deep slumber shall mine eyelids
close,
Safe in my narrow bed, nor blame nor praise
Can wake my calm and hallowed repose ;
Make thou no show of tears about my grave,
But in thy quiet hours sweet thoughts I crave.
Pass not my memory unheeded by,
But give me holy thoughts in gentle hours;
When in forgetfulness life?s tumults lie,
And blissful eve doth close her tender flowers,
Oh, then bestow a thought upon the heart,
Which in life?s conflicts bore with thee a part.

My Charlie !
I feel sad and weary to-day,
Soon you, I, and baby must part ;
I know that I?ve not long to stay,
So press me once more to your heart
My Charlie !
Bring hither, my angel-like child,
?Twill soothe a heart lonely and sore ?
Let me kiss my own pretty child
And hear her sweet ? ag-hoo ? once more,
My Charlie !
Lullaby, lullaby,
My angel go to rest,
Fondle, my only child,
Your dying mother?s breast.
Lullaby, lullaby,
? My race is nearly run,?
Lullaby, lullaby,
? God?s will, not mine, be done.?
When Winter shall horn his rude blast
O?er the mound ?neath where my dust lay ;
Should memory waken the past,
Drop a tear o?er my cold bed o? clay,
My Charlie !

wlien fate severs hearts that love has united,
@@ Ah ! ?tis then we feel sorely life?s chastening rod,
?Tis then we feel keenly, our fondest hope blighted,
And seek consolation from an all-seeing God.
Oft I ?ve sought a heart that could beat for another
When anguish?d with fever, lone, weary and sad ;
Vainly I seek rest, my heart-burnings to smother,
And weep for the one that once made my soul glad.
Faithless she may whirl where Deceit?s cover
May hide for a time her soul-searing d# > A ways,
But too late ! ah, too late ! yes, she?ll surely discover,
That conscience to hearts just debts fairly pays !
Blindly she?ll bask in life?s hell-luring pleasures,
Till the cloud of affliction o?ershadows her sun,
Then vainly she?ll seek for Virtue?s lost treasures,
And grieve for the soul her mad Folly?s undone.
Why should I mourn for a just one departed ?
Why should I grieve for one living, tho? dead ?
To the grave soon I?ll totter, sad?broken-hearted,
And find rest for my clay in a lone icy bed.
Friends, brothers, strangers, hearts that have feeling,
Should you pass the green mound ?neath where my dust lay.
Heave a sigh, drop a tear, your pity revealing,
For one, who, while on earth, ne?er knew a bright day.

leaves are fading- and falling,
�fc) The winds are rough and wild;
The birds have ceased their calling,
But let me tell you, my child?
Though day by day as it closes,
Doth darker and colder grow,
The roots of bright red roses
Will keep alive in the snow.
And when the winter is over,
The boughs will get new leaves,
The birds come back to the clover,
The swallow back to the eaves ;
The robin will wear on his bosom
The vest that is bright and new,
And the liveliest wayside blossom
Will shine with sun and dew.
So, when some dear joy loses
Its beauteous summer glow,
Think how the roots of the roses
Are kept alive in the snow.


(Lines addressed to Miss K. S. by the Author, October 20th, 1880).
me little fair one, tell me,
Engaging thoughts will crowd my brain,
Like a naughty dream, they tease me,
Love ; to love?s to suffer pain.
Mem?ry often doth awaken
Eager hearts to some delight;
Kindred spirits?not mistaken ?
Arms the soul to win the fight.
Tell me, little fair one, tell me,
Things we all in fancy know
Youthful cupid, funny fellow,
?S bending now his deadly bow.

ONE morn in bleak December,
Sadly I remember,
An old man leaning on a staff
Came tapping at my door ;
His look was worn and haggard,
As to the door he staggered ;
His faint-like voice it uttered
Have pity, I implore.
What brought you here aged sire ?
I ventured to inquire,
Is it love for early rambling,
Or is it something more ?
My heart it fluttered madly,
As his tale so sadly,
Fill?d my soul with anguish ;
For bread he did implore.
Tears trickled down his furrow?d cheek
As tenderly and meek,


He spoke of a little girl,
Whom his soul did adore,
Her young spirit long had fled,
She slumbered with the dead ;
He stood homeless, a wreck
On life?s too troubled shore.
His clothes were scant and tatter?d,
His feeble frame was shatter?d,
And his wrinkled face bore traces
Of suffering galore.
W T hile he prayed that the morrow
Might end his earthly sorrow,
From his Father above, he
Did forgiveness implore.

(�pp)AREWELL, thou lofty monarch,
@@ r Prince of the forest glade,
Many are the happy hours,
I?ve spent beneath thy shade.
I loved to hear thy branches,
Soft singing to the breeze,
And gazing upon thy noble form,
Tow?ring in stately ease.
?Neath thy massive boughs I sat,
Deep musing o?er the past,
And praised thy fragrant blossoms,
Gone from my view at last.
Mighty giants of nature,
My pen shall some day tell
The wonders of thy greatness ;
Honoured friend, farewell.

as.the everlasting hills,
And richer than their wealth,
Is that pure stream which gently fills,
The fountain of our health ;
True as the shadow to the sun,
It points to sunny goals,
Whose treasure may be grasp?d and won,
By firm and temperate souls.
The fount that thousands seek in vain,
That hope so oft embowers,
That drops as sweetly as the rain,
Does on summer flowers.
That fountain is not far to seek,
?Tis traced on wisdom?s chart ;
It blooms upon a maiden?s cheek,
And leaps from heart to heart.
It has a beauty of its own,
A mirth that never dies,
When all its springs are kept in tone,
By temperate supplies.
It has a melody of song,
Whose music never jars,
But floats above all human wrong,
And mingles with the stars.


We wish for riches, and would keep
A guard upon our wealth,
Forgetting that we cannot reap,
Without the grasp of health ;
Until Intemperance firmly pinned,
Has blurred us with its stain ;
We find that we have sown the wind,
To reap the hurricane.
See pampered John, beguiled by use,
Feeds highly day by day ;
And drinks the strong fermented juice,
Of that which brings decay.
And just as he begins to scout
His heritage of woe,
John dies some day, and leaves his gout,
A legacy to Joe.
Poor Bill is drunk, James is sick,
And Jane begins to bawl ;
And troubles seem to loom as fast
As shadows on the wall.
Go ! trace it to intemperate hurt,
A mild ancestral treat,
As sure a thing in life?s desert,
As pudding after meat.
The husband, happy with his wife,
Must own the fountain?s truth,
For he is cheerful all his life,
And she wears well her youth ;
While all her children blown around
Their mother and their sire,
And share with them the healthy round,
And temperate desire.


So truth and love must be combined,
And have a temperate aim.
Then shall we have a healthy mind,
Linked to a healthy frame.
Our children?s voices then will bless
The homes that gave them birth,
And mingle with each fond caress,
Their melodies of mirth.
Oh ! may this crystal fountain tide
Be used by all the world ;
Its portals will be always wide,
Its banner never furled.
Go! seek it in the ? Templar ? cause
And learn to shun the bowl,
Which so infringes Nature?s laws,
And sears the human soul.
Then pledge with me this noble theme,
And may its pleasures bless,
The thousands who float down th? stream
Of misery and distress ;
And may the ? Templars ? be a guide
To those who seek for health,
And live to be their country?s pride,
A nation?s truest wealth.

lay on the cold couch of death,
Her face beaming placidly mild,
She gave up to God her last breath,
And thought of her far-away child.
My Mother.
She?s gone from this world of keen woe,
To a home in a far richer land ;
Like a Christian she conquered the foe,
And paid to King Death his demand.
My Mother.
She has reached the haven of rest,
Where eternally reigns peace and love,
She dwells with the happy and blest,
In the realms of her Saviour above.
My Mother.
Oh! weep not, dear father, for soon
Will end all your sorrow and pain;
Like a hero cling close to the cross,
God willing, you?ll soon meet again.
My Mother.
Mourn not sister, and brother,
Death?s burden we all have to bear,
Fear God and he kind to each other,
If a crown of glon you?d wear
Like our Mother.

�JESU, Lord of life and light,
My lips shall bless Thy sacred name ;
Thy praise shall be my soul?s delight,
For Thou hast borne my sin and shame.
When frowns the world upon my lot,
Do Thou, O Lord, my shelter be ;
The blessings Thy dear blood has bought,
Are worth a thousand worlds to me.
Can I refuse to drink the cup,
Which shall my chasten?d soul prepare ;
When Thou, my Lord, wilt bear me up,
And all my sorrows Thou wilt share ?
I?ll not forget Thy suffering life,
Thy bloody cross and painful death ;
Amid the world?s turmoil and strife,
Thy praises shall employ my breath.
Oh, let me live to do Thy will,
Till all the trials of life are o'er ;
Thy priase shall then my bosom fill,
In realms of bliss for evermore.
Benson, Printer, 180 Napier Street, Fitaroy, Melbourne.
