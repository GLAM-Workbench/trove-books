PREEAOE.
In preparing this second descriptive catalogue of Queensland
woods, an opportunity has been taken to correct a few errors
occurring in a former catalogue, printed for the Colonial and
Indian Exhibition. A large amount of additional information has
also been given as to the uses of the various trees, with more
local and native names, and further references to works where
detailed descriptions may he found and where plates may he
consulted.
The present exhibit contains 538 kinds of wood, probably
little more than one-half of what might be collected in Queens-
land did time allow, for no country in the world has a greater
variety of useful and beautiful woods.
The remarks on the practical characteristics of each sample
of wood have been supplied by Mr. Carl Madsen, of Messrs.
Pettigrew’s establishment, where the entire exhibit has been
prepared. F M B

meter. Tropical Queensland coast, New Guinea, and several places

C2‘s per cent. ; kernels, 37 5 per cent. Greenish-yellow oil, 43 per cent.; dry
residue, 27 per cent,; moisture, 30 per cent. Ashes of whole kernels, TG6 per


cent • ashes of exhausted residue, 6*15 per cent. Mr. Staiger finds the green
oil on saponification gives a bright-yellow soap, the green pigment of the oil
having changed into a bright yellow.
B.P.V.— Wood of a reddish colour and pretty wavy figure, strong andl
durable; a useful wood for the joiner and cabinet-maker.

more finger-like lobes. " Flowers large, white with a purple centre.

19—H. tiliaceus, Linn. ; DC., Prod, i., 454; Flora Austr., i.,,
218. Paritium tiliacrum, St. Hils Wight, Ic. PI. t., 7. Cotton-tree;

hoary-white on the under side. Flowers large; yellow with crimson
centre. Abundant on the Queensland sea-coast, and also the islands
of the Pacific, the West Indies, and Hew Guinea; in fact, on the
tropical coasts of both continents.
In Central America the fibre is known as “ majagu,” and in Bengal as
“ bola,” and being little affected by moisture is therefore selected by surveyors
for measuring lines. The Queensland blacks at one time used the roots and
young growth of this tree for food. In the West Indies, in times of scarcity of
bread-fruit, the mucilaginous bark is said to be sucked for food.

capsule oblong, the seeds enveloped in a silky wool. Found at the
Endeavour River and North Australia; also throughout India and
Burmah.

linear or lanceolate, three to six inches long, or consisting of from five
to nine linear-lanceolate lobes. Flowers bell-shaped, deeply lobed,
tomentose. Pods (follicles) ovoid acuminate, about one inch long.
This cui’ious tree is met with in many Brigalow and Dead Finish
scrubs in Queensland, and in times of long drought the trunks have
been the means of saving a large number of cattle. The succulent
stem, before giving to stock as fodder, is usually passed _ through the
chaff-cutter. Cattle do well on this food, and are exceedingly fond of
it; indeed it is said that they even eagerly gather up the chips as
they fly from the axe.

belonged to some other tree, not having correct samples or description of the

In general appearance this tree resembles one of the narrow-leaved Wattles.

Hill, it was afterwards noticed by the late Rev. B. Scortechini. There is little,
however, except size, to separate it from D. corymbosa, Sm.

120 —P. glabra, Vent., in Jard. Malm., t. 28; Flora Austr., ii,
273. A tree of medium size, the leaves of five to seven leaflets, which

four to five inches long ; flowers pink, in pairs Pod one and a-half
to two inches long and about one inch broad. Along the sides of
rivers and creeks in tropical Queensland, Northern Australia, New
Guinea, Southern India, and the Archipelago.
In India the wood is thought to be of little value on account of its being so
readily eaten by insects. (This is also the case in Queensland. ) It is, however,
used for solid cart-wheels. A large quantity of a pale sherry-coloured oil is
obtained from the seeds, which, besides being used for burning is considered to
possess medicinal virtues, especially in skin diseases and rheumatism, when ex-
ternally applied. Surgeon-Major Dymock, of Bombay, recommends this oil as a
cure in Pityriasis versicolor, and says that by rubbing the oil in twice a day,
several cases where the disease occurred upon the face, neck, and shoulders
were cured in less than a fortnight; he points out also chat this oil has the
advantage over iodine and Q-oa powder of not discolouring the part to which it
is applied. . , ,

pubescence on the infloresence and young growth. Leaves abruptly

without leaflets. Flower-spikes from one to 12 inches long*. Flowers
somewhat rigid. Pods two to four feet long, containing from 10 to
30 flattish round seeds often two inches in diameter. This plant so
common on the tropical coasts of Queensland, is common within the
tropics of both the new and old world. A single plant of this gigantic
climber has been said to cover the trees on some acres of ground.
The seeds are converted into match-boxes, and in India they are used
medicinally, and even used as food ; an infusion of the stem is used in
the Philippines with advantage for various affections of the skin.
According to E. Palmer’s paper on the plants used for food by the Flinders
and Mitchell River natives, these beans are used by them for food after being
roasted, pounded and soaked for several hours in water.

which is a native of tropical America, is taking possession of all the
waste ground and scrubs in the Brisbane district, and is one of the
greatest pests introduced. The fruit is often eaten by children, who
call them “ black currants,” but as the berries have been thought to
have made some children ill they are considered poisonous by many
persons. Some fancy articles having been made from the wood in

Flora Austr., viii., 145. The most beautiful palm of Australia, with
erect very tall stem, not plainly scarred by fallen leaves. Leaves

the base with short sharp prickles, below which the margins expand
into an entire, strong, lace-like sheath, which ends on the opposite
