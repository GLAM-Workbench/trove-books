Manifesto and Appeal of the Barrier District of the
Coal and Shale Federation of Australasia.
To the Unionists of Australasia,
DEAR COMRADE. iTHE MEMBERS OF THE A.M.A. HAVE BEEN OUT FIGHTING THE BROKEN HILL MINING COMPANIES FOR SEVEN MONTHS FOR BETTER CONDITIONS. THE PRINCIPAL CON-
O.TIONS BEING FOUGHT FOR ARE- A 6 HOUR-SHIFT. BANK TO BANK; THE ABOLITION OF THE CONTRACT SYSTEM; THE ABOLITION OF NIGHT SHIFT; £1 PER DAY AND COMPENSATION ON THE BASIS
OF FULL PAY FOR TIME LOST BY THOSE WHO MEET WITH ACCIDENT OR WHOSE HEALTH IS RUINED IN THE INDUSTRY. IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING. ALL, OR ANY OF THE ABOVE CON-
CESSIONS AN IMPORTANT PRECEDENT WILL BE ESTABLISHED THAT WILL GREATLY INFLUENCE MINING CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALASIA. WITH SILVER AT A RECORD PRICE. AND
WITH LEAD AND ZINC AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES WE ARE SURE TO WIN, PROVID«NC. OF COURSE, THAT WE RECEIVE THE FINANCIAL BACKING OF OUR CLASS IN AUSTRALASIA. THE MINING
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN. IN ORDER TO STA MPEDE THE MEN BACK TO WORK. BUT WE CAN SAY CONFIDENTLY THAT AFTER SEVEN MONTHS' FIGHTING,
THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE AS SOLID TO-DAY AS WHEN THE MEN LAID DOWN THEI * TOOLS AND CAME UP OUT OF THE MINES, DETERMINED NEVER TO RETURN UNTIL MORE DECENT CON-
DITIONS WERE WON. VICTORY IS NOW WITHIN SIGHT, BUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MUST CONTINUE TO COME ALONG. THE TROUBLE IS SURE TO BE PROLONGED UNTIL AFTER XMAS, SO WE
APPEAL TO YOU OUR FELLOW UNIONISTS. TO GIVE AS LIBERALLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORE ER TO KEEP THE FIGHT GOING. OUR MEMBERS HAVE ALWAYS LIBERALLY ASSISTED OTHER UNIONS WHEN
FIGHTING FOR BETTER CONDITIONS IN ANY PART OF AUSTRALIA. TRUSTING YOUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE GENEROUS, AND BE FORTHCOMING IMMEDIATELY.
J. J. O’REILLY. ACTING PRESIDENT.
W. O. BARNETT, GENERAL SECRETARY.
The following article was written
by one who knows Broken Hill rain-
ing conditions well, and was in-
spired as a result of noticing the in-
scriptions on the tombstones in the
Broken Hill Cemetery, in company
with a striking mate.
IF BLOOD WAS TRUMPS, WHAT
HANDS THE MINE-OWNERS WOULD
HOLD.
—Adapted from Charles Lamb.
Over four hundred dead Broken Hill
workers lie within the sandy, desolate
zone we had just traversed—four hun-
dred hard-working men and bright
youths, who had been killed in the Bro-
ken Hill mines*—were laid to their last
long sleep injhis cemetery. Of the four
hundred dead, about sixty had tomb-
stones, which had been erected to their
memory by some relation, friend, or or-
ganisation. As we walked among the
graves I read the inscriptions written
upon the headstones. They Irevealed, to
some extent, the grim, bloody tragedy
that has been enacted in the Broken Hill
mining industry for over thirty years,.
Yea, a ghastly, bloody sacrifice by honest
workers, in order to enrich a. brutal gang
of parasites, known as mining share-
holders.
Yes, the tombstones showed the sacri-
fice in sweat and blood of the working-
class in Broken Hill on the altar of divi-
dends from the very early days of the
field to the present. One of the many
Inscriptions read: —
Sacred to the Memofy of
THOMASS

Killed in B.H.P. Mpe.
December 7, 11886.
—Aged 34 years.
Another read:

Father.”
the best things of this world, at the ea®
pease of the blood and lives of the®!
mine toilers. Most of these people wer*
leading useless, frivolous lives of debauch-
ery, without even a care, or a thought
about their wage-slaves who worked un-
der brutal, murderous conditions in thei*
Broken Hill mining properties.
Yes, human life is cheap in the BrolksS
Hill mines—cheaper than mine horses ll
the eyes of the mine-owners.
Yes, over four hundred mutilated bodie*
of dead mine workers lie in the cemetery (
apart from the hundreds of others wh«
lie there, because of premature death*
due to miners phthisis and lead poison-
ing, they lie —where they do lie.
Let ' the truth be knows.,
they lie there because cheapnes*
in ' production w 7 as the prims-
pal consideration of the mining magnate*
and directors, in their indecent desire fo*
huge profits. The dispensing with a®
possible timbering, and working on th*
open-stoping system is responsible fot
many of the accidents*. The failure t*
provide dust-preventing devices was, an*
is, responsible for many more death*
Their general neglect to take measure*
to prevent accidents and to consider tht
health of their men is the reason way s*
many workers lie in the Broken Hil!
c nnetery. Human life is nothing to to*
Broken Hill mining companies. Hug*
dividends is their only concern.
When one, comes to look back at th*
awful death-toll of the Broken Hill mine*
and the hundreds maimed, and the thouis-
ands whose health has been broken *o*-
cause of industrial diseases, ONE WOR-
DERS HOW IT WAS THAT THIS
SHOCKING STATE OF THINGS WAS
TOLERATED SO LONG BY THOSB
WHO SUFFERED UNDER THEM. Fo»
over thirty years .the slaughter went
on continuously—the wheels of industry
never stopped when a worker waft kiLe#
—they continued to grind yfiore r ■>
fit; the worker was simply take*
out of the way, and the blood traced
covered up.
Mining capitalism has become abso-
lutely brutalised in its mad desire fot
increased dividends. AT LAST, AFTEB
And so on, right through the sixty
headstones, and right down to the pre-
sent, they showed the grief of some bro-
ken-hearted mother, wife, son or daugh-
ter for their martyred dead. The sixty
inscriptions showed that at the time of
their death only eight of the victims were
45 year® of age and over, while 30 of
them were 30 years of age and under, and
18 of them but 25 years and less. All,
with the exception of a few, were young
men in the very prime of their manhood.
The mine-owners of Broken Hill, in the
course of their soulless exploitation, have
had no conscience in regard to the ages
of their victims. I noticed that one was
a poor little boy, but 14 years of age,
the son of a widowed mother, forced,
probably, to the mines to assist younger
brothers and sisters. Two of the vic-
tims were but 16 years of age; two more
were 17 years of age; another one 18
years, and another 19 years. Boys,
youths, young, middle-aged, and old men
have been maimed and killed in the bru-
tal, bloody career of mining capitalism in
Broken Hill, in order that £26,000,000
prfits should be produced.
Yes, the tombstones show murdered and
battered victims, from the Big Mine, the
Central, the North, the British, the South
—yes, victims from every mining heil
along the line of lode.

Where They Lie.
Broken Hill’s Martyred Dead.
MANY YEARS, THESE LONG-SUFFEB-
INcr WAGE-SLAVES AWOKE. They
realised that the mine-owners, their direc-
tors, and managers had become so cal-
lous that they had no thought of eve*
attempting to minimise the frightful
carnage that was going on. The result
of the awakening was that the worker*
themselves decided to restrain, the minis-
owners’ brutality, and to restrict th*
number who were being killed and iat
jured, by stopping the industry when-
ever a fatal accident occurred. The idea
was to hit at the only heart the minim
bosses have—their pocket-book. THX
ACTION HAD THE EFFECT OF MAX.
ING THE MINE OWNERS TAKB
MORE PRECAUTIONS, BECAUSE V%
PAID THEM TO DO SO.
In 1916 the workers successfully agal*
improved the conditions by fighting fos,
and winning a 44-hour week.
Mr. Baillieu. a director of the Broke*
Hill mines, said at a recent conferene*
to representatives of the workers THAT
IT WAS NO GOOD OF THEM LOOKING
BACK INTO THE PAST. Let me he*i

past that we best know these companies,
There is absolutely nothing in their pa»J
or present actions that causes us to be-

After thirty year® the long black nigh*
is passing, and the day of 'better condi-
tions is dawning. The gallant tight el
1919, which is now raging, is the onlj
fight the Broken Hill mine workers haw*
waged during all their thirty years o|
