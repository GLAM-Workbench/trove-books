Ho. I -HYMN
Star-Spangled jjanner
O sav. can you sec. by the dawn's early light.
What so proudly we hailed in the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro’ the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming.
-4nd the rochet’s red glare, bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro’ the night that our flag was sti.l there ;
O say, does the star-spangled banner yet wave
‘ ! ’ er lhe land of the free and the home of the brave ?
Chorus—
O say, does the star-spangled banner, etc
0 ! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war’s desolation,
Blest with via’ry and peace, may the Heaven-rescued ’land
drawn we Power that hath made and preserved us a nation
: T:,cn c«»quer we must when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto : ■’ In God is oor trust ’ ’
An d the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave !
Chorus -
And the Star-spangled banner, etc,,

CHILDREN’S PRAISE
When mothers of Salem their children brought to Jesus,
The stern disciples drove them back and bade them depart,
But Jesus saw them ere they fled, and sweetly smiled and k.ndly said
Suffer little children to come unto Me.
Around the throne of God in heaven
Thousands of children stand,
Children whose sins are all forgiven,
A holy, happy band.
Singing glory, glory, glory be to God
on nigh.
On earth they sought the Saviour s grace
On earth they loved His name ;
So now they see His blessed face,
And stand before the Lamb,
Singing glory, glory, glory be to God om
high.
lesns we love to meet, on this Thy holy day,
We worship around Thy seat, on this Thy holy day.
Thou lender, heavenly triend. to Thee our prayers ascend
O’er our young spirits bend, on this Thy holy day.
Children will you go with us-to yon bright shore?
Yes ! we’ll go along with yon—to yon bright
Glory, hallelujah ! Praise ye the Lord.
Tell me the old, old story, of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the story simply, as to a little child.
For I am weak and weary, and helpless and defiled.
Tell me the old, old story,
Of Jesus and His love.
gentle Jesus meek and mild,
Look upon a little child;
Pity my simplicity.
Suffer me to come Thee.
Fain 1 would to Thee be brought
Gracious Lord, forbid it not.
In the kingdom of Thy grace,
Give a little child a place.
Children of Jerusalem, sang the praise of Jesus’
Children, too of modern days, join to sing the Saviour s praise.
Hark I Hark! Hark! while infant voices sing ,
Loud hosennas to our King.
Oh, how they sweetly sing ! Worthy is our Saviour King ,
Loud let His praises ring—Praise, praise for aye.

We are marching home to Zion, we are marching day by day ,
We are marching home to Zion, we are pilgrims on the way.
In the name of God our banners in the morning light we raise.
And with bursts of loud Hosannas every day we end in praise.
Marching onward, marching onward,imarching onward day by day,
We are marching home to Zion, we areipilgrims on the way.
We shall see the King in beauty, we shall see Him on His Throne ;
He shall shine a Sun in splendour, that a guiding light has shown
Day by day His grace increases, brighter hopes our spirits fall.
Day by day our songs of triumph nearer draw to Zion's hill.
