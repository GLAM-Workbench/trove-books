REMARKS
ON
THE THIRD REPORT
OF
THE BOARD OF NATIONAL EDUCATION
IN
NEW SOUTH WALES,
FOR THE YEAR 1850.
BY
THE RIGHT REVEREND
THE LORD BISHOP OF NEWCASTLE.
SYDNEY:
PRINTED BY F. M. STOKES,
BRIDGE STREET.




To the Honorable
The Members of the Legislative Council.
Gentlemen,
I desire to call your attention to the Report of the
National Board of Education in New South Wales
which was published last week as a Council paper.
. Man 7 Persons deeply interested in Colonial Educa-
tion have been anxiously waiting for the publication
of this document, expecting to learn from it what pro-
gress the Schools of this much praised System had
made; and whether its boasted superiority'over the De-
nominational System, with respect to the cheapness and
excellence of its Schools, was proved by convincing ar-
guments, or by any clear tabular statements of facts.
From the high character of the members of the Board
and from the liberal salary of the Secretary, it was not
unreasonable to expect, that this Report, with its tabu-
lar statements, would be drawn up with ability, indus-
try, and scrupulous regard to truth—that it would
be. marked by superior clearness , correctness, and
fairness. I ask you to peruse it, and read my remarks
upon it, and then judge for yourselves, whether it must
not be pronounced confused, incorrect , and deceptive.
I* *The Report is confused.
If there be any one point, on which we might expect
clear and accurate information in this Report, it is the
annual expense to the public of each child’s education
m the National Schools.
The great argument hitherto used (for we shall see
that it is given up in this Report) in favour of the Na-
tional system, has been its superior cheapness. The
enominational system was denounced because of its


enormous expense. In the Report from the Select
Committee on Education (1844) it is stated, (p. l .)
‘The first great objection to the Denominational sys-
tem is its expense’—and again, in the same page, ‘the
‘expense of public Education (under the Denominational
‘system) is about £1 per head : an enormous rate after
‘every allowance has been made for the necessary dis-
persion of the inhabitants of a pastoral country, and
‘the consequent dearness of Instruction.’
As excessive expenditure has thus been made the
great objection to the Denominational system of educa-
tion, and superior cheapness the great boast of the Na-
tional system, we might surely expect to find in this
Report of the National Board, a clear statement of the
annual expense of each child, both on the books, and in
actual daily attendance.
The Denominational Board has given this information
most clearly in its Reports. That Board is evidently
not afraid of the truth being known in this particular
In the Report of the Denominational Board for 1849.
we have the following tabular statement—
“ The following return shews the amount of grant to
‘each Denomination compared with the attendance and
‘the cost”.

Again in the Report of the Denominational Board

“The actual daily attendance of the children is be-
tween one third and one fourth less than their number
‘in the Books”.
From these clear and simple tabular statements, we
see at once the amount of public money received, and
expended by the Board; the number of children on the
books, attending the schools, which is the number of
children really educated. We have also the number of
children in actual daily attendance, or in average atten_
dance, as it is sometimes called, between § and £ (=
less than the number of children on the books. If from
these tables we calculate the average for all denomina-
tions, we have the following results.
1849. Each child educated, cost the Go- £ s. d.
vernment 15 1|
Each child in actual daily atten-
dance, cost 1 1 4f
1850. Each child educated, cost the Go-
vernment 14 4|
Each child in actual daily atten-
dance, cost 1 0 4|
Average Annua 1 amount of payment
of parents for each child 9 0£
Here all is clear and intelligible, no concealment, no
mystification ; but what is the case with respect to the
Report of the National Board ?
We have to find the amount expended in 1850, by
making extracts from tabular statements in three sepa-
rate folio sheets: and will it be believed that there is no
statement whatever (in a Report of 42 folio pages) of


the number of children, either on the School Registers,
or in average attendance during 18 50. Such however
is the fact; and we cannot, from this Report, learn in
any degree, what number of children were instructed in
the National schools during 1850; or the cost of each
child to the Government.
All the information we have given to us in this
lengthy Report of 4? folio pages —of which the Mem-
bers of the Board say (p. 4.) “We submit this as our
‘Report for the year ending 1850”—is a tabular state-
ment, (which I shall presently shew to be most confus-
ed, incorrect, and deceptive,) of the number of chidren
attending the schools on the 30th of September 1851—
and whether the number of children mentioned in this
table (appendix I. page 41) shews the number in ave-
rage attendance,or the numbers in occasional atten-
dance, is not clearly stated, though the former is evi-
dently meant to be inferred.
Is not this most delightful confusion? This attempt-
ed concealment and mystification, I have however, with
some labour and care endeavoured to remedy; and by
looking through the Reports of this Board for 1848
1849 and 18 50 —have, with every desire to be most
correct, brought out the following results.
I have tried to find out every school which has been
in. operation (for some have already failed and come to
nothing, and therefore are not included in Appendix I,
as the schools at Botany and Kempsey). 1 have sup-
posed the numbers given as attending each school June
1850, to be present during 1849; and the number
given as attending 30th September 1801, to be present
during 1850, which suppositions are most favourable to
the schools. I have also supposed the number of chil-
dren put down as attending the Schools to mean those
in average attendance, except in three cases, where I
can prove that the large number returned, is teally the
number on the books in occasional attendance. I


have wished to give a perfectly fair and truthful state-
ment, and to err in favour of the National system, ra-
ther than against it: and what is the result, which my
search into these confused documents has brough*
to light ?

The Report from the Select Committee of Education
1844, called the expenditure in the Denominational
Schools, of £ l per head, excessive } what should this
ex penditure be called?
Still the advocates of this lately popular system, with
its enormous waste of public money, will not be silenced:
they will still defend a system, which by a few plausible
and shallow arguments, they have been led to adopt:
and their answer to such an exposure, is this.
“Report for 1850 (p 4”) —‘How funfair is it to com-
pare the expenses of schools on the National system
‘(inclusive of all the cost of buildings incurred on com-
mencing them) with those of the Denominational
‘Schools, carried on for the most part in buildings long
‘since erected at the public cost.’
I can inform the members of the National Board that
many of the Church of England Schoolrooms have been
built, not from Government funds, but from private sub-
scriptions, and from grants made by the Church Societies
at home. The Lord Bishop of Sydney laid before the
Select Committee on Education 1844 (see report p 83)
a list of schools, the building of which was aided by
grants from the Church Societies at home, to the a-
mount oi£ 2,000, between the years 1836 and 1844.
The excuse however is plausible, and while facts are
concealed and mystified, effective. I have therefore
gone through the items of expenditure in the several


Reports of the National Board, and after deducting every
item for building, the result is as follows.
Expenditure exclusive

interpreted average attendance.

If from this table, we calculate the annual expense of
each child’s education, in the National Schools taking
the average of the three years,
the result will be 3 S . 2|d.
While in the Denominational Schools, the Annual
expense of each child s education, taking the aveage
of the years 1849 and 1850, is £1 Os. 10±d
Leaving out therefore every item of expense for build-
ing, each child in the National Schools, has cost the
public more than twice as much, as each child in the
Denominational Schools.
This statement will, I trust, open the eyes of the
Members of the Legislative Council, and of the public,
to the utter fallacy of the boasted cheapness of the Na-
tional System. And in truth the Members of the Na-
tional Board seem perfectly conscious of this fallacy:
they feel that the boast of superior cheapness will not
support their system. They have been resting on a
broken reed which has pierced their hand, and while
they have taken pains to conceal the wound as much as
possible, they have tried to provide their system
another support.
They say in this Report for 1850, immediately after
the passage which I have already quoted,
c ßut even if after making all these allowances more
'outlay were incurred in one description of schools than
'in the other, we have still to submit that the true
'question is not the absolute expenditure, but the ex-
'pense with reference to the end in view: and if it be


‘necessary, as we believe, to purchase efficiency by
‘more liberal provision, than has hitherto been made
‘for teachers, for school houses, and for school requi-
sites, the question is not whether the old imperfect
System has cost less than the new, &c.’
Here then the charge against the Denominational
System, of greater expense, is given up. The old imper-
fect system, as it is erroneously called,is allowed to cost
less than the new. Economy in the use of public
money —superior cheapness—are arguments which can
no longer be used in favour of the National System,
with the slightest regard to fact, or to the reluctant ad-
mission of the National Board. The ground is now
quite shifted ; the boast of superior cheapness is dropt,
and the assumption of superior efficiency is their sole
reliance.
I am quite prepared to meet them on this ground
also.
The superior efficiency, of one system of Education
above another may be tested in two ways.
Ist. By duly qualified and unprejudiced Inspectors
examining the schools of the respective systems, and
reporting that the children in the Schools of the one
System, are better informed, and better conducted, than
the children in the schools of the other system.
I should be most happy to have the two systems
tested in this way: and should be much pleased to hear
thatit was'the intention of Government, (after allowing
some period of preparation) to appoint Inspectors, who
might examine the Schools of each System, and report
as to their comparative efficiency. This has not yet
been done, and therefere this test cannot at present be
applied.
2ndly. There is a second test, however, of the effi-
ciency of Schools which may be applied, namely,
the value which parents set upon the education


of their children under the different systems. If parents
are willing to deprive themselves of the convenience of
keeping their children sometimes at home—or are
willing to pay highly for their children’s schooling, then
the education in such schools must be really valued by
them. The regularity therefore of attendance at
school, and the amount of school money paid for the
children, are valuable tests of the efficiency of the
School.
In the Report of the Denominational Board we have
clear data given to us, from which we can calculate the
regularity of attendance, and the amount of schoolmoney.
The average attendance of the children in the Deno-
minational School is between § and less than
the number on the Books. The average attendance
therefore is of the whole number; and the average
payment for each child is 9s. Of d. for the year, or 2s. 3d.
for the quarter.
In the Report of the National Board, there is a total
omission of any reference to these points : so that we
can gathei from it, nothing as regards regularity of at-
tendance, or the payments of parents. The omission is
however happily supplied by the account of the Gover-
nour General’s visit to the Model National School, in
the Sydney Morning Herald for 28th October last.
It is quite obvious that a school in a populous city is
more likely to be regularly attended, than one in a
thinly populated district—distance in bad weather, and
the greater useiulness of children to their parents in the
country producing this result. It is also quite obvious
that the superior excellence of tl e Model School and
Master, above the other Schools and Masters under the
same system, must tend to make parents set a higher
value on the Model School, than on others. So
that the regularity of attendance may be fairly expected
to be greatest, and the payments of the parents highest
at the Model School.


By comparing therefore the average attendance and
payments at the Denominational Schools, with the at-
tendance and payments at the National Model School—
we shall certainly not be acting unfairly to the National
System.
In the account of the Governor General’s visit to the
Model National School, we find this Statement:—
‘The number of children attending the School is 523,
‘the average attendance is 284, and the average payment
‘during the last quarter per each child is Is. s£d.’ The
ratio then, of the average attendance to the numbe r
of children in occassional attendance is §[% or J|..
Therefore the average attendance at the Model National
School, is to the average attendance in the Denomina-
ional Schools, as H:VI: : *3 : : 130 ;or the
average attendance at the Denominational Schools is
thirty per cent more than the average attendance at the
Model National School.
Again, the quarterly payment for each child at the
National Model School, is Is. 5\
And at the Denominational Schools, is 2s. 3d
Therefore the quarterly payment for each child at the
Model National School, is to the quarterly payment at
the Denominational Schools, as Is. s|d. : 2s. 3d : :
35 : 54 : : 100 : 154; or the payments of parents for
each child at the Denominational Schools, is fifty-four
per cent, more than the payments for each child at the
Model National School.
The reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that the
Denominational schools are more valued by the parents,
than the Model National School; and consequently that
the efficiency of the Denominational schools is superior
to that of Schools under the National system.
These results are most important : and it is strange
that the facts upon which they are founded, should have
found their way into the public papers, seven days after
the Report of the National Board was written, and yet


should find no place in the Report itself.
11. I pass to the second assertion that the Report is
incorrect.
The following careless errors may be noticed :
Atp. 2. 1 12, the Report says—
‘A statement of the receipts and expenditure for the
‘three quarters of the current year, will be found in the
‘appendices.’
There is no such statement of receipts.
‘At p. 2. 1 44, ‘Mr Wilkins (the Master of the
‘Model School) unites with great zeal and aptitude, a
‘long experience under the Lords of the Committee
‘of the Council on Educution.’
How long was this experience ? Do not the mem-
bers of the National Board know that a report has been
spread with something more than a smile through
Sydney and the Colony, to this effect.—That the request
of the National Board to the Governor General, asking
His Excellency to write to Earl Grey, and beg that he
would cause to be selected in England a well trained
Master for the Model National School at Sydney, result-
ed in Earl Grey applying most innocently, to His Grace
the Archbishop of Canterbury, for a Model National
School Master. That His Grace the Archbishop, not
knowing the novel and subtle confusion of names in this
Colony, most innocently selected Mr. Wilkins from the
Church of England traning school at Battersea. That
Mr. Wilkins was a pupil of the Bishop Designate of
Lyttelton. That he brought out with him a set of Church
of England school books ; and expected that he was to
be the Master of a Church of England Model School.
That the dismay of Mr. Wilkins was great when he
found out his sad mistake: that the dismay of the
National Board was greater, when they thought of the
derision which the mistake would bring upon them.
That the conscientious scruples of Mr. Wilkins were
somehow or other overcome, and the pupil at the train


ing School of the Church in England, became the
Teacher at the Model School, opposed to the Church, in
Sydney,
If this rumour be true, the experience of Mr. Wil-
kins must have been gained for the most part under
the training of the Church at Battersea, and not under
the Lords of the Committee of Council on education :
the merit of his teaching must be due to the Church of
England, and the account given in the Report must be
defective, if not incorrect.
In p. 3. 1 10, the Report says, ‘the average atten-
dance in Fort-street is now 523/ This statement is
so incorrect,,and tends so evidently to give an exaggerated
and false view of the success of the Model School, that it
is with real pain, I find it in a Report-signed by three
persons of such high character. The statement should
have been (as is shown in the account quoted from the
Sydney Morning Herald for 2Sth Oct. last,) ,the number
of children attending the school is 523, and the average
attendance is 284.”
At p. 26. 1 55. why is the amount under the head
of agency not brought forward between stationery and
salaries ? The sum total of expenditure for the three
quarters is thus considerably lessened, which may be
very convenient, but it is very careless and incorrect to
leave out so large an item as £lO5. 4. 2. Again was not
the agent paid any thing during the third quarter? H e
ceased to be Agent on the sth September, 1851, when
stipend for 232 days was due to him, which at £1 per
day, is a large additional sum.
In p. 42, the date of the appointment of the first
Master of Camden School is said to be 3rd Oct. 1850,
yet in the Report for 1849, the Camden school is said
to be in operation with 112 children.
Also the date of the appointment of the first master
of Clarence Town school, is said to be 22nd September,
1850, yet in the Report of 1849, this school is said to


be in operation with 59 children.
Again in the return of all persons employed by the
Board, since its first appointment, no mention is made
of the master of the school at Gundagai, which in the
preceding page is said to be in operation with 55
children.
In a Report in which so many important particulars
are, as we have seen, left out, the secretary seems
anxious to make up for his vexatious omissions in
some points by most tedious details in other points. He
has confounded an annual statement of accounts with
a copy of the daybook, and has not taken the trouble
to collect together the items of expenditure for any one
object, as the sums lavished on the Model School;
but any person interested in the subject must extract
fron different folios the numerous items, before he can
ascertain the whole expense.
To two of the items however contained in this copy
of the day-book, I would most earnestly direct the
attention of the honourable members of the Legislative
Council*
P. 8. i Incidental expenses.’ 1850 October 12th,
*Publication of Lecture on National Education, £lO.
I would ask, is this a proper expenditure of public
money? This lecture is, I presume, the one delivered at
Brisbane. If so,it wasably answered in another Lecture
delivered by the Clergyman of the Church of England,
then resident at Brisbane. But if the Denominational
Board had been asked to publish this second Lecture
at the public expense, they would I think, have an-
swered, that the public money was intrusted to them
to pay for the education of the children of the colony,
and not to pay for puffing their peculiar system.
Again, p. 26. ‘lncidental expenses.’ ‘ 1851.15 t July.
Kemp and Fairfax for half year's Morning Herald.
Will it be allowed that the public money should be
expended to furnish the Secretary, and the members of


the Board, the amusement of a morning news-paper ?
Are any terms too strong to express the indignation,
which must be felt at finding such an item of expenditure
in the accouuts of the Board of N ational Education P
Will not some member of the Legislative Council take
measures, that these sums may be refunded for the
public service. ?
Once more —the Report mentions as the first subject
of congratulation. (p. 1.) ‘that we have now in opera-
tion 43 schools, and that 52 more are in course of
‘formation’.
That is, we, the Board of National Education for New
South Wales, have now (2L October, 1851.) 43 Schools
in operation, of which upon investigation 7 prove to be-
long to the Province of Victoria, of which Province the
report says in its second page.—“As far as the Province
“of Victoria is concerned, the powers of the Sydney
“Board ceased at the close of the half-year ending 30th
“June last.”—What a careless error !
Then, can the 52 schools in course of formation, be
any subject of congratulation to those, who know by
what influence and arguments, persons have been per-
suaded to subscribe for their formation?
One argument used to induce parents to subscribe,
and assist in the formation of these Schools, has been
addressed to their avarice, in direct opposition to the
recommendation of the Report from the Select Com-
mittee on Education 1844. That Report states (p. 4.)
‘your Committee would also express their opinion,
‘that if it is intended that Education should be valued,
‘it must not be gratuitous, at least to those who can
‘pay for it.”
The Denominational Board, acting in the real spirit
of this recommendation, have directed that the Members
of the local boards should decide, what amount of pay-
ment each parent is able to give for its child’s education,
having fixed the highest and lowest payments at 12d.


and 2d. per week, except in cases when the parents are
too poor to pay any thing. And this rule has been so
well carried out, that each child pays on the average
2s. 3d. per quarter.
Whereas the common argument used to parents, to
induce them to favor the national system, has been,
that no one need pay more than a penny. Again and
again have I had to counteract this evil influence, by tell-
ing parents, that if they really had not the means of pay-
ing, they might send their children to the Church Schools
for nothing; but that if they could pay, it was their
bonnden duty to do so according to their means, from
2d. to l2d. per week, for the support of the Master. The
effect of this penny argument in favour of the National
system, is apparent in the fact already stated, that the
average payment of each child attending the National
Model School is 54 per cent less than the average pay-
ment of children attending the Denominational Schools.
This is surely no matter of congratulation to the
members of the National Board.
Again, the same appeal to the pocket, has been urged
upon the Tradesmen in different places, to induce them
to subscribe for the building of National Schools. In
page 33, of the Lecture omNational Education, which
has been published by the Board at the public expense,
there is this passage, the sentiments of which the Na-
tional Board may fairly be considered to have adopted
as their own.
* Besides, when you consider that for one hundred
‘pounds, which you may subscribe, three hundred
‘pounds, will be spent and circulated in your Town;
‘the very money contributed by you, returns three-fold
‘into your own pockets.’
‘This however ought to be the least consideration.
‘The great object is to educate the rising generation,
‘and to enable them and their posterity to assume their
‘position among the enlightened nations of the earth.


* All the civilized nations of the earth are engaged at
‘the present day, in a glorious rivalry of intellect.’
How persuasive is the former of these paragraphs !
How bombastic the latter ! How similar is the whole to
the appeal made by Demetrius to the workmen, in the
xix chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, verses 27, 28.
‘So that not only this our craft is in danger to be
‘set at nought: but also that the temple of the great
‘Goddess Diana, should be despised, and her magnifi-
cence should be destroyed. And when they heard
‘these sayings, they were full of wrath and cried out
‘saying, great is Diana of the Ephesians.’
The appeal to selfishness is, alas ! too often success-
ful, whether it be that your craft is in danger, or your
charitable contributions will return three-fold into your
own pockets. Decency however requires some plausi.
ble pretext for our wrath, or our zeal; and in the one
case, it is devotion to the great Goddess—in the other,
devotion to ‘the rising generation, and the glorious ri-
valry of intellect.’
As however the report is incorrect in including the
Schools cf the province of Victoria among those in
operation under the Board, so the Report is incorrect
in stating that 52 others are now in the course of for-
mation, when the Board must know T , that in the case of
more than one of the 52 mentioned in Appendix H, the
local patrons have resigned, and the Schools, as at
Cassilis, have been relinquished.
lII.—I shall be very brief on the subject of the
third assertion, that the Report is deceptive ; for
when I see the names attached to the Report I can only
suppose that the members of the Board are ignorant of
facts, and have not examined Appendix I (p. 41,) in the
Report.
I will not dwell again upon the statement in the Re-
port itself, that the average attendance at Fort-street is
now 523, whereas the real average attendance is only


284; nor will I dwell again upon the omission of the
£lO5 4s. 2d. in the expenditure of 1851 I will refer
solely to Appendix 1 p. 41 which I pronounce to be, not
only confused and incorrect, but also deceptive.
I*—Why is the table of Schools at present (October
21st 1851) in actual operation, with the attendance of
children thereupon given, while no table is given of the
number of children educated during 1850 ? Was it
not that in a Report professedly for the year ending 31 st
December, 1850, the number of children inserted in
this table, might be mistaken for the number educated
during 1850 ?
-ll* Why is the heading of the table, so ambiguously
worded, as not clearly to show whether the number of
children in the table refer to those merely attending the
school, or to those in actual daily attendance. The
note at the bottom of the page—‘the number of chil-
dren on the register is necessarily much greater’—
must however in common honesty fix the sense, in
which the entries in the table are intended to be taken :
namely, that the figures shew the No. of children in ac-
tual daily attendance.
How then can the No. in the Model School be put
down 523 instead of 281 ? The Members of the Board
may be supposed not to have looked minutely into par-
ticulars, and therefore in the body of the Report drawn
up by them it may be considered an error, tho’ a very
careless one; while in the case of tabular statements
drawn up by the Secretary from the returns of the
Masters, no such ignorance can be supposed to exist.
lll.—Again it may be desirable to make the No. of
children attending the Schools as large as possible, but
would it be supposed, that with seven of the Schools in
the table, the Board of National Education in New
South Wales have no connexion ? (Baccusmarsh, Ben-
alla, Colac, Pascoevale, Wangaratta, Warnambool, and
Yuroke, being in the province of Victoria, over which


the power of the Sydney Board ceased, on 30th June
last, nearly fivemonths before.)
IV. Among the Schools at present in operation is
numbered Riley-street School Sydney, and 184 children
are said to be in attendance upon it. Yet while these
184 children are reckoned in the sum total of children at
schools at present in operation, a note is appended to
this stating that it is now abandoned. It would seem
that this School is now merged in the new School,
William Street, Sydney, so that the same children are
reckoned twice over.
V. —lt is made a a matter of congratulation in the Re-
port (p. 3.) that, when the new school in William-
streetwas opened, as many as 282 children flocked to it,
Now certainly the children that flock to a school at its
opening, must be che number on the books, and not the
number in average attendance. Taking therefore from
the Model School, the ratio between the number on the
books, and in average attendance, this number of 282
must be reduced to || 282=156 nearly. A second case,
where the numbers put down in average attendance,
prove to be the numbers on the books.
VI. —There is a third similar case. Riley-street
School, and Crown-street School, appear to have both
merged in the New School in William-street: and as
the Board declare in the Report that the number
of children that flocked to the New School, realized
all their most sanguine expectations, the New School
must be more numerous than one of those which merged
hi it. Consequently 184 cannot be the number of chil-
dren in average attendance at Riley-street School, which
would make the School more numerous than William-
street School, where we have just seen 156 were in aver-
age attendance. Therefore 184 must be, the number of
children on the books, and the number in average attend-
ance must be (applying the same ratio) 164 = 104
nearly. In three cases then, we have proved those
figures to be erroneous.


All these errors, tending as they do, to the same ob-
ject, to exaggerate the number of children in actual
daily attendance, and thus diminish the actual cost of
each child’s education, prove irrisistibly not only the
utter absense of clearness and correctness, but also of
fairness, and must substantiate to every candid mind
the charges of confusion, error and deception, in this
Appendix I. p. 41, and the whole Report.
I conclude this painful subject with expressing a
hope that some Honorable Member of the Legislative
Council will move for a return of the No. of children,
both on the books, and in average attendance, in every
School both Denominational and National, for each
quarter of the year 1850. It will then be seen whether
my calculations are correct or not. The return also of
the amount of all fees, &c. paid to the Masters at the
National Schools during that year, would be very valua-
ble ; which return is given for the Schools of each De-
momination in the Report of the Denominational Board.
My calculations will, I am convinced, prove to be much
in favour of the National Schools, and should this not
be the case in every instance, I can take no blame to
myself, for I have used every exertion, and tried every
means to obtain correct returns, but I have been dis-
appointed through the sensitive coyness of those to whom
I have applied.
To shew that I have spared no pains to arrive at true
results, in the calculations which I have made as to the
number of children really attending the National Schools,
I annex the following Table, so that it may at once be
seen what the truth is.
It will be necessary to call attention to one point
only, namely to the way of calculating the annual ave-
rage attendance.
It is clear that if children cost so much per head an-
nually for their schooling, a child or a school will cost
only half as much for six months, as it will for twelve
months, and a quarter as much for three as for twelve


months. A very false therefore, and exaggerated result
will be obtained, if, when new schools are continually-
being formed, (as is the case with the National Board)
the number of children attending schools at the close
of the year, be taken to give the average for the year.
And the later the time at which the numbers are reck-
oned, the greater will be the exaggeration. Which
may account for the fact, that the only table of the
number of children attending the schools in the Report
of the National Board for 1849, is calculated for 30th
June 1850: and the only table in the Report for 1850
is calculated for 30th September 1851.
The correct way of obtaining the annual average at-
tendance, is by seeing how many months of the year the
school has been in existence, and then by multiplying the
number of children (reckoned as nearly as possible at
the mean of its period of operation) by the number of
months the school has been at work, divided by twelve.
Thus under a system which makes the annual cost
of a child’s education £l, suppose a school of 40 chil-
dren is opened at the commencement of each quarter
then we have—
one school at work 12 months
another 9 »
and the others 6 and 3 ~ respectively
and the expenses for that year will be
£4O for the Ist school at work 12 months
£3O 2nd 9 „
£2O 3rd 6 „
£lO 4th 3 „
making together £IOO.
If we reckoned the number of children in annual ave-
rage attendance, from the number in attendance at the
close of the year, we should much exaggerate the num-
ber, and make the schools seem much cheaper than
they really are.
Thus suppose we had—


School A commencing Ist Jany. and No. 31st Deer. 40
B l»**April 49
C 1...Ju1y 40
- D 1-Oct. 40
160
and were we therefore to reckon the annual average
attendance to be 160 ; we should make it appear that
£l6O had been expended, or that the education at the
schools was much cheaper than £1 per head.
If however we add, in another column, the time
each school is in operation, and calculate how many
children are educated for the whole year, by considering
a child educated for 9 months, £ of a child educated for
the whole year, and one educated for 6 months, only
l a child for the whole year &c, then a true and
correct result is obtained.
Thus

• Report, 1849.
t Changed* to William Street School.


The numbers in the column headed ‘'No. of children
attending 30th June 1850,” and “30th Sept. 1851,” are
taken from the Tables given in the Reports of the Na-
tional Board for 1849 and 1850—and are allowed by
me in my calculations to be the numbers in average at-
tendance, as the Notes in the different Reports would in
common honesty assert; though I am convinced it will
be found that they are only the numbers on the books or
Registers.
Three of these numbers have been corrected; as
mentioned by me in my proofs of the deception of the
Report, namely
Fort St. School—523 into 284—which is ££ of 523
Wm. St. School—282 156 H of 282 and
Riley St. School— 184 — 104 of 184
I have separated the Schools in Victoria, from those
in New South Wales, and have excluded the expenses
incurred in Victoria, from my calculations. The average
annual expense however of the Victoria Schools should
be known, up to the 30th June 1851, six months of this
year; when the Board at Sydney ceased to have any
control over them, or their expenditure.
The result is, as follows, from

£2240 5 54. ' IfcS
The amount of expenditure I take exactly from the
Reports, and in the Tabular Statement (in the previous
page) is seen how I calculate the number of children
in annual average attendance, so that the cost of each
child in average attendance in the Province of Victoria
has been =£2240 5 5|=£l3 6 8j.
168
Of this sum of £2240 5 5|, only 2 4 in the
year 1850, and j£60 0 0 „ ,» l85l,
— (Tu June 30th)
that is . . £ 113 2 4


has been spent in Salaries. Therefore if this money
had been intrusted to the Denominational Board, and
the rule of that Board been followed, of expending j 7 c of
the grant in Salaries and in Books and apparatus,
the sum expended by the Denominational Board in the
Province of Victoria would have been £ll3 2 4 plus §
£ll3 2 4 = £125 13 Bs. Yes ! £125 13 B£, instead
of £2,240 5 5} would in this case have been the sum
expended : but then the Denominational Board would
not have made the children in the unsettled districts of
the Province of Victoria, pay of the expense of
printing a puffing pamphlet , or T 35 of the expense of a
Mornittg Newspaper, for the office of the National
Board, at Sydney.
Should any errors be found to exist in this Table aris-
ing from erroneous data, l cannot blame myself. I asked
for accurate information from the Resident Patron of
Dunmore National School (a School which in the Re-
port of 1849, is returned as having 101 children in
average attendance) : and my Messenger brought back
the answer, “That the School had ceased to exist, was
“shut up, and the Registers had been sent to Sydney.” I
then applied through one of my Clergy to the Secretary
of the National Board, and when he declined to allow a
few figures to be -copied, from the School
application was made to the Honorable the Attorney
General: but all in vain.
I will make no comment on these refusals, but con-
clude with recalling to your minds the facts which I
have proved.
Each child attending the National Schools,
cost the public (exclusive of all building ex-
penses) the sum of £2 3 2}
Each child in average attendance at the
Denominational Schools costs the public,
(including all building expenses) the sum of £ l 0 10£


Each child on the books of the Denominati-
onal School, or each child educated in them,
costs the public - -- -- -- - £ l 4 4$
The regularity of attendance at the Denom-
inational Schools, is to that at the Model
National School as - - - * : 130 : 100
or thirty per cent more.
The payments of the parents for their chil-
dren at the Denominational Schools, are to the
payments at the Model National School, as : : 154 : 100
or fifty four per cent higher.
It' the figures in Appendix 1 refer not to the average
attendance, but to the children on the Registers
then each child in average attendance, will have cost
about £3 13 10 exclusive of all building expenses :
nearly four times as much a child in the Denomina-
tional Schools—and remember that inthe Province of
Victoria, each child has cost the public the sura of
£ 13 6 Bs.
Is not the Denominational system therefore superior
to the National system in the cheapness, and (as far as
pur present data will enable us to judge) in the excellence
of its Schools ?
I remain, Gentlemen
Your obedient faithful Servant
W. NEWCASTLE.
P. S. There is supposed to be a difficulty in the way
of a fair and equitable reappropriation of the Denomina-
tional Grant. Why should not the simple course be
pursued of dividing the Grant, according to the numbers
of each Denomination, as shewn in the recently publish-
ed Census returns for 1851. The only objection to this
fair and equitable course, is the supposed hardship in
causing Schools now in existence to be discontinued.
If this be any hardship, the Church of England would


Ire to encounter it, because by a
sent deficiency of £440, would be made up. The
!of Rome would not have to encounter it, for its
t deficiency of £777 10 would be made up. And
iot be considered a hardship for the Presbyterians
lalled upon to do for the sake of justice, what they
,een frequently doing from their own free choice,
immediate neighbourhood, they have within the
to or three years given up their schools at Hinton,
ville, Dunmore, Buchanan, and Dungog, and es-
aed National school in their place, making ovei
National Board, their school rooms at Dunmore
'ungog. Why therefore should they not be required,
se or make over to the National Board, so many
ir schools, as would reduce their expenditure to
lir and ju ß t proportion of the grant. Neither
| the Wesleyans have any great hardship to
nter. Their present proportion of the gran:,
I not be much diminished; and they also are such
is promoters of National Schools, that they could
easonably object to promote a just and equitable
on of the grant, by transferiug to the National

If the proposed addition of £BOO. had been granted
