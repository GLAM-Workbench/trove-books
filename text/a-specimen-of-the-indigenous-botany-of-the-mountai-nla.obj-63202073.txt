SPECIMEN,
DICOTYLEDONES.
I. THYMELE M, Jussieu.
The plants of this natural family, whose pre-
valence forms a feature in the Flora of the Cape
of Good Hope, constitute at least ten distinct
genera; and of these two only have been observed
upon our southern continent, viz. Pimelea , and
the European genus Daphne. Although some few
of the Pimelece have been discovered in the equi-
noctial portions of Australia, the greater number
have been found to exist in the parallels of our
colony and the southern parts of Van Diemen?s
Land.
1. Pimelea ligustrma , Labiilardiere.
A tall shrub, found in shaded subhumid situa*


tions. Banks of the Fish River and ravines near
Bathurst.
2. Pimelea linoides, allied to P. linifolia. Smith.
Involucris 4-phyllis: foliolis lat6 ovatis acutis
glabris capitulo subbrevioribus, perianthii tubo vil-
losissimo: ore4-punctato, staminibus exsertis stylum
subaequantibus, foliis oblongo-lanceolatis apicibus
callosis obtusis internodio plus duplo longioribus.
Frequent in permanent bogs and margins of cas-
cades, on the Blue Mountains.
11. PROTEACEiE, Jussieu.
It is a remarkable fact in the geography of
plants, that nearly the whole of this beautiful order
is confined to the southern hemisphere, where it is
very extensively scattered, without limitation to
any particular latitude, Embothrium having been
found in the higher parallels of South America;
and with respect to situation, it does not simply
exist on or near the shores, at a moderate elevation
above the sea, for some plants have been traced to
a perpendicular height of 4000 feet in Van Die-
men?s Land; and to a species of the above-men-
tioned genus, the Baron Humboldt has given its


natural spot of growth a mean height of 9300 feet
above the level of the ocean.
The Australian part of this extensive order
comprises at least twenty-three distinct genera, of
which only Persoonia and Cenarrhenes (a genus of
Labillardhre, till very lately imperfectly understood)
produce drupaceous fruits, the remaining larger
portion bearing dry capsules, more or less woody.
To the species of the several genera already
published by Mr. Brown, many new plants, more
recently discovered in the interior of our continent,
and particularly on its north-western shores during
the late voyages of Captain King, remain to be
added; and of any individual genus, Grevillea
has received the most considerable accession of un-
published species, belonging chiefly to Mr. Brown?s
first and fourth sections, the one having ecostated
coriaceous folliculi, containing seeds winged only at
the apex, the other remarkable for its round woody
capsules, containing two orbicular seeds, winged
quite round the margin, ? sernina undique lathis
alata,? as in the section Cycloptera of Mr. Brown.
3. Hakea propinqua.
Foliis filiformibus indivisis teretibus mucronatis


fructu vix sequalibus, capsulis subrotundis gibbosis
obtusis nodosis, perianthiis glabris, pedunculis in-
canis. A large shrub, at about eighteen miles on
the Blue Mountains. This species is nearly allied
to H. nodosa , Brown.
4. Hakea microcarpa , Brown.
This species, which was originally discovered on
the banks of rivers in Van Diemen?s Land, is very
frequent, from Cox?s River to a very considerable
distance around the settlement of Bathurst.
5. Greyillea rosmarinifolia.
Foliis linearibus strictis acutis mucronatis: mar-
gine revolutis: subtus ramulisque cinereis, stylis
utrinque glaberrimis, perianthiis extus lucidis; intus
basi sericeis, stigmata verticali. A shrub of robust
straight growth, and with reddish showy flowers.
Banks of Cox?s River.
6. Greyillea acanthifolia. / f-r
Foliis pinnatis glabris; lobis suboppositis tri-
fidis, racemis erectis, perianthiis lanuginosis, stylis
glabris. Tab. Peaty bogs on the Blue Moun-
tains and banks of Cox?s River. Collected on Mr.
Oxley?s first expedition in 1817.

cronatis; marginibus refraetis subtus ramulisque
incanis, perianthiis extus tomentosis: barba in-
teriore obsoleta, stylis apice villosiusculis. Allied
to G. tenuifolia , Brown. A shrub frequent with
the preceding on the grassy flats, Cox?s River.
8. Grevillea cinerea , Brown. A beautiful
species. Cox?s River, and Rocky Hills beyond
Bathurst.
9. Persoonia Chamcepitys.
Diffuse humifusa, foliis lineari-filiformibus acer-
osis sulcatis minutissim6 punctatis mucronatis,
pedunculis axillaribus solitariis, floribus in capitulis
apicem ramulorum, perianthiis pubescenti-
bus, ovariis maturis incanis stylo brevioribus,
pedicello glandulis hypogynis duplo longiore. A
remarkably long-branched, procumbent plant, ex-
tending its ramifications five feet on all sides of
the central root. Brushy hills, country north of
Bathurst. Flowers in December.
111. DIOSMEiE, Brown.
This natural family, which originally formed a
section of M. Jussieu?s Rutacea , until it was de-


fined as a distinct order by Mr. Brown, is a tribe
of plants, which, from several striking points of
character, uniform in every genus of the order, as
well as from its geographical extent (chiefly indeed
in the extra-tropical regions of this continent)
forms a peculiar feature in the vegetation of Terra
Australis. The genera of the colony are seven,
viz. JSoronia, Corrcea , JEriostemon , Phebalium ,
Zieria, Crowea, and Philotheca of Rudge, which
last scarcely appears generically distinct from JEri-
osfemon. Of all these ( Crowea and Philotheca
excepted) Port Jackson furnishes the botanist with
several species, even yet for the most part un-
published.
10. Zieria ohcordata.

laribus terminalibusve. Verge of the Regent?s
Glen, Blue Mountains.
12. Boronia ariemonifolia.
Foliis petiolatis trifidis; laciniis angusto-cuneatis

tusis; brev6 mucronatis concavis petiolatis glabris
carnosis, floribus solitariis terminalibus axillari-
busve. Verge of the Regent?s Glen, Blue Moun-
tains.
14. Eriostemon cuspidatum.

lorum dispositis. A tall handsome shrub, found in
bare rocky situations. Blackheath, Blue Moun-
tains.
IV. LABIATiE, Jussieu.
I have already observed, in a report upon the
herbaria formed during Captain King?s respective
voyages, and transmitted by me to England, that
the mass of this and another order ( Verhenacece)
very nearly allied to it, seems, in Australia, to
exist on its eastern shores, within and beyond the
tropic; and that the species in those herbaria are
referable to ten well-established genera. Among
these Premna and Vitex are most remarkable on
the north-west coast.


Of the European portion of Labiates , also indi-
genous to our colony, are to be found six remark-
able genera of plants, confined indeed to Terra
Australis, whose characters are formed from the
structure of the antherae, in some of which these
organs are in part barren and defective, whilst in
Prostanthera each has a calcarated appendage.
18. Prostanthera linearis , Prawn. Margins
of shaded woods, Blue Mountains.
19. P. violacea , Pr. Blue Mountains.
20. P. rotundifolia , Pr. A twiggy suffruticose
plant. Blue Mountains.
21. P. denticulata, Pr. Pine Hills near Bathurst.
2(J. Westringia angustifalia , Pr. A suffruti-
cose plant, growing with the preceding.
V. SCROPHULARINiE, Prawn.
The plants of this order are inhabitants of the
alpine regions of the higher latitudes of Europe,
as well as of the shores of every country within
the tropics which has been visited by the botanist.
Several Linnaean genera of this order exist in the
equinoctial parts of Australia, as also at the


southern extremes of Van Diemen?s Land, where
a species of the genus Euphrasia is traced to the
summits of its highest mountains.
The order is divided into two sections, compre-
hending species having two or four antheriferous
stamens.
23. Euphrasia paludosa , JBr. Boggy spots on
the Blue mountains.
24. E. scahra, Hr. Plains at Bathurst, &c.
VI. SOLANACEiE, Jussieu.
The Solanacece have been characterised by a
plicated monopetalous corolla, having as many
stamens (generally five) as there are divisions of
that floral envelope; nor was it until M. J. J. La-
the naturalist who accompanied General
D?Entrecasteaux, had discovered his Anthocercis,
upon the south-western shores of this continent,
that there existed any deviation from a corre-
sponding number of the respective parts of the
fructification of any genus of the order. The di-
dynamous stamens, with the bare rudiment of a
fifth, together with the form of the embryo, now


constitute a section of the order, of which the
genera appear to be limited to our Australian con-
tinent.
25. Anthocercis albicans.
Incano-tomentosa, foliis ovali-oblongis impunc-
tatis obtusis margine revolutis, corollae laciniis tubo
aequalibus, capsula sphaeroidea calycem aequante.
Tab. A shrub frequent upon Pine Hills in the
interior, being a third and hitherto unpublished
species of this interesting genus, originally disco-
vered by me in 1817, and again seen in October,
1822.
The seeds of A. littorea and A. viscosa *, Br.
were gathered last year by me on the shores of
King George the Third?s Sound.
VII. TREMANDREiE, Brown .
A small order in Terra Australis, consisting of
two genera of plants only, the one proposed by
Mr. Brown, under the title of Tremandra (being
* All tlic three species of this curious and interesting
genus are now growing in his Majesty?s gardens at Kew
Editor.


the type of this little family) and Sir J. E. Smith?s
long-established Tetratheca, remarkable for the
terminal bursting of the four distinct cells of its
antherae.
26. Tetratheca rubueoides.
Foliis quinatis senisve verticillatis linearibus
falcatis supra scabris, ramulis incanis, pedunculis
solitariis axillaribus cernuis. Allied to T. ericee-
folia, Smith. Rocky declivities, Blue Mountains.
VIII. MAGNOLIACEjE, Decandolle.
This important family was first considered, by
Mr. Salisbury, as distinct from the Dilleniacece,
with which it had been till recently associated, in
the ternary disposition of the several parts of the
flower, as well as the want of astringency in its
bark, which is highly aromatic and stimulant;
and although M. Decandolle has adopted this se-
paration, it was Mr. Brown who clearly defined
the extent and affinities of the two families.
The family of Magnoliacece , although extensive
in Asia and America, is limited to two plants in
Terra Australis, named in honour of the Dutch
voyager Tasman, the one a native of our colony.


and the other of the southern extremity of Van
Diemen?s Land (which he first discovered), where it
occupies the place of the celebrated Winter?s-bark,
(Wintera aromatica , Willdenow) of a corre-
sponding parallel in South America.
27. Tasmannia dipetala , Br.
A large shrub, frequent in shaded woods, gullies,
&c.
IX. POLYGALEiE, Brown.
The Polygalece are limited in Terra Australis
to three genera, of which M. Labillardi&re?s genus
Comesperma is the most striking; differing from
Polygala of Linnaeus and other authors, in the
shape of the capsule, and the tufted villous appen-
dages attached to the seed.
28. Comesperma coridifolia. Allied to C. con-
ferta, Lahill. Brushes on the Blue Mountains.
X. DILLENIACEjE, Decandolle.
M. Decandolle, in his learned enumeration of
the species of this family, has divided it into two
tribes differing from each other, in the apices of
the filaments being dilated to receive the antherae,
or narrow, and even sub-attenuated; as well as in


the shape of these organs. To that section, with
simple stamens, therefore, the Australian portion
of the order has been referred, whose number is
no less than seventy, of which the greater part
exists in various exposed situations of our colony,
and constitutes three genera.
29. Hibbertia saligna, Hr. A shrub among
brushwood in several parts of the Blue Moun-
tains, particularly about Spring Wood.
30. Pleueandra Cneorum , Decand. Brushes
on the King?s Table Land.
31. Pleueandra stricta, Hr. A suftruticose
plant, in barren brushy situations. Blue Moun-
tains.
32. Pleueandra calycina, Hr. Forest land
near Bathurst.
XL EPACRIDEiE, Hrown.
Upon comparing the floras of countries lying in
the same parallel, it is interesting to observe in
several families of two distant continents, so situ-
ated, a striking affinity and even an identity of
genera, common to both. Where, however, the
same genera have not been met with, in two widely


divided countries, situated in the same latitude, the
place of a tribe abundant in the one is often oc-
cupied by another equally extensive family, having
a striking affinity to each other, not only in the
structure of their respective parts of fructification,
but also in the physiology and physical properties of
the vegetables themselves. Thus the Cape of Good
Hope (in the parallel of Port Jackson) affords in its
heaths (properly so termed) a striking as well as a
beautiful feature in the flora of the southern ex-
tremity of the African continent; and although the
genus Erica does not exist in Terra Australis, the
extensive family named Epacridece (recently so
constituted), which has been referred to the Eri-
coidece by Jussieu, forms a numerous and nearly-
related substitute, occupying a large space in our
colonial flora.
Exclusive of several unpublished plants of recent
discovery, nearly one hundred and forty species of
this order (which are remarkable for the harsh dry
nature of their foliage) have been described by
Mr. Brown, two-thirds of which bear drupaceous
fruits, containing a definite number of seeds, and
hence constitute a section of the family named
z 2


Styphelece, whose maximum is, with the capsular
fruited division (the Epacridecn properly so deno-
minated), in the parallel of our colony. The whole
tribe is, with the exception of two plants in the
Banksian Herbarium, which are natives of the
Sandwich Islands, entirely confined to the southern
hemisphere.

XII. LEGUMINOSiE, Jussieu.
Mr. Brown has considered this order, from its
extent and wide distribution in almost every
country, as a grand class, divisible into at least
three principal families; viz. The Minwsece, as
left by Linnmus, now constituting several genera:
the Lomentacece, and the Papilionacece , the last
being in part decandrous, or having ten stamens
distinct from each other, and in part diadelphous,
with filaments united at their base.
1. JSlimosecE.
This leading division of the Leguminosa is so
extremely abundant in Terra Australis, as to give
a peculiar character to the vegetation. They belong


almost wholly to the genus Acacia , as formed by
Professor Willdenow, are mostly aphyllous, and
generally diffused over every part of the continent
that has been examined. A few, indeed, appear
to be limited to solitary spots on the north-western
shores, and no one species has been remarked so ge-
neral, as to be common to opposite coasts. Already
have upwards of 130 very distinct species been
discovered, most of which are unpublished. These
cannot be well defined in any Monograph upon
the family, unless reduced to sections, charac-
terized by the shape of the foliaceous petioles
(at present termed leaves by botanists), the capi-
tular or cylindrical inflorescence, and the form of
the pod.

XIII. MYRTACEiE, Jussieu.
It has been justly remarked that this order is
more strikingly modified in Terra Australis than
in any other part of the world, forming, in Euca-
lyptus and the genera immediately related to it,
four fifths of the forests; but, although so generally
diffused, it is remarkable that they are scarcely to
be found beyond it. The colony of Port Jackson,
and the southern settlements in Van Diemen?s
Land, appear not only to produce the greater num-
ber of the several species of Eucalyptus , but also


considerably larger timber, than the equinoctial
parts of the continent, where (at least on the east
coast) a permanent moisture and a greater regu-
larity of temperature exist, seemingly not genial
to their robust growth.

XIV. RHAMNEiE, Brown.
Bhamnece and Celastrince were formerly united
among the B/iamni of Jussieu, but disposed in
sections, differing from each other in the relative
position of the stamina in respect to the petals,
and in the character of the fruit, which (when
viewed with other important differences of fructi-
fication) induced Mr. Brown to modify and define
them as two distinct orders.
The following plants are all of the Bhamnece of
Mr. Brown.
77. Pomaderris ledifolia.
Foliis ovalibus ellipticisve glabris subtus albi-
do-sericeis, corymbis paucifloris terminalibus, caule
virgato. A slender shrub upon rocky hills, Cox?s
River.
78. Pomaderris andromedcefolia.

82. Daewinia taxifolia.
Foliis linearibus falcatis mucronatis sparsis.
Rocky declivities on the Blue Mountains.
XV. CUNONIACEiE, Brown.
This is a small family in Terra Australis, where
its three genera appear to be confined to its eastern


shore beyond the tropic. The' following solitary
individual is of a genus frequent in equinoctial
America, where some of its species form large
heavy timber.
83. Weinmannia australis.
Foliis ternis ovato-lanceolatis profundi aequali-
terve serratis sessibus, floribus terminalibus. Moist
shaded rocks. Spring Wood. Discovered in 1817.
XVI. TEREBINTHACEiE, Jussieu.
Jussieu, in the third section of this balsamic
family, has associated several genera, which more
recent examinations have proved to belong to Mr.
Brown?s Diosmece , a very distinct order, although
related to one large natural class. The genus
about to be mentioned, as having a species in the
accompanying collection, may still be retained in
the Terebinthacece , until a more fit situation be
found in the natural arrangement. Its species are
numerous and singular in Terra Australis, on every
shore of which they have been observed.
84. attenuata.
Dioica, foliis lineari-spathulatis punctato-scabris


basi attenuates: margine revolutis subdenticulatis:
apice rotundatis acutis integerrimis, racemis late-
ralibus terminalibusve. Channel of Cox?s River.
XVII. BUTTNERIACEJ:, Brown,
This small family has recently been separated
from the Tiliciccw of Jussieu, into which it appears
nevertheless gradually to pass. It contains several
interesting genera, four only being published by
Authors*. The present subject, Lasiopetalum, is
the largest genus of the family, and has been observed
not only in the colony, but also at King George s
Sound, and Dirk Hartogt?s Island off Shark?s Bay
on the west coast.
85. Lasiopetalum ruhiginosum.
Foliis oblongo-cordatis obtusis supr& lucidis mi-
nutissime punctatis subtus rubiginosis. King?s
Table Land, Blue Mountains.
XVIII. EUPHORBIACEiE, Jussieu.
The greater portion of Euphorhiaceee , which
are very numerous, exist in India and the equi-
* M. Gay has made five in his ? Monographic des Lasi-
opetakes, 1821.? ? Editor.


noctial parts of America, nor is the order wanting-
in Terra Australis, nearly one hundred species
having been remarked, for the most part on shores
within the tropics. Some genera, however, peculiar
to this country are natives of the colony of Port
Jackson, where the Linnasan genus Croton is in-
digenous.
86. Croton urticoides.
Dioicum, stellato-tomentosum, foliis lanceolato-
cordatis sublobatis imcqualiter serratis subtus mol-
libus, racemis axillaribus, caule lanuginoso fruticoso.
Cox?s and Macquarie Rivers.
87. Croton rosmarinifolium.
Monoicum, foliis linearibus obtusis revolutis
subtus ramulisque cinereis petiolatis, floribus axil-
laribus solitariis. A handsome shrub, eight feet
high, Cox?s River.
XIX. PRIMULACE/E, Ventenat.
This European order is limited to six plants in
Terra Australis, referable to three Linnaean genera,
of which Samolus is abundant on the sands of all
its shores.


Samolus , although it is allied to the Primula
family, differs nevertheless in the position of the
ovarium and seeds, as well as in the abortive cha-
racter of one half of its stamina, which are ten in
number.
88. Samolus littoralis , Brown. Arid brushes
on the Blue Mountains.
XX. STACKHOUSES, Brown.
This very small family, which consists of two
genera (one of which still remains unpublished),
was formed by Mr. Brown, upon Sir J. E. Smith?s
genus Stackhousia , long since announced to bo-
tanists in the 4th vol. of the Linnaean Transactions.
The Stackhousece are peculiar to our Australian
continent, over which (as far as has been explored)
they are sparingly scattered, being more frequent
in the vicinity of the colony.
89. Stackhousia linariifolia.
Foliis linearibus crassiusculis basi attenuatis ob-
tusis rectis incurvatisve, floribus 3-gynis, bractea
calyce duplo longiore. Plains at Bathurst.


XXL CARYOPHYLLEiE, Jussieu .
Almost every country beyond the tropic of Cancer
in the northern hemisphere abounds in the several
genera of this very extensive class of plants, which
M. Jussieu has arranged under seven sections, cha-
racterized by the number of their stamens and
styles.
In the southern hemisphere, the order appears
to exist only in about four of the genera of Europe,
and these seem to be limited each to a solitary
species.
90. Linum* marginale. (Flax.)
Calycibus acuminatis; foliolis margine mem-
branaceis, foliis lineari-lanceolatis acutis, floribus
terminalibus subcorymbosis monogynis, stylo apice
quinquepartito. Forest-land, interior.
XXII. ROSACEiE, Jussieu.
This order, which has lately been very judiciously
relieved by Mr. Lindley of one of its sections as
* M. Decandolle, in his Prodroraus, makes a separate class
of Lineaj, and indicates another Australian species, viz. Linum
angustifolium. ? Editor.


left by Jussieu, Pomacece being constituted a
separate order, is but barely represented in Au-
stralia; the following species, with three or four
of Pubus, being the only plants ot the order whose
indigenous existence I am aware of.
91. AciENA ovina.
Incano-hirsuta, foliolis profundi incisis pin-
natifidis; laciniis oblongis obtusis, spicis oblongis;
inferioribus remotifloris, caule reclinato subdemerso.
Frequent on moist lands, Bathurst, &c.
XXIII. UMBELLIFERiE, Jussieu.
This natural family appears to occupy portions
of every country in the temperate climates of the
northern hemisphere. Those genera which have
been remarked in our southern regions are very
few, and found to deviate most remarkably from
the usual Structure of the order, hence constituting
genera peculiar to the country.
92. Eryngium ovinum.
Foliis bipinnatifidis; laciniis linearibus spinoso-
rigidis divaricatis, capitulis sphsericis pedunculatis,
caule erecto sulcato dichotomo, foliolis involucri
linearibus mucronatis rigentibus. A plant, when


young, much sought after by sheep. Plains at
Bathurst, &c.
XXIV. COMPOSITE, Jussieu,
The Composite, like the preceding order, has its
maximum in Europe, although about 300 species
have already been discovered in Terra Australis,
being about one-eighth of the number that has been
described of the family generally. In our colony,
as well as in Van Diemen?s Land, the most in-
teresting genera are Aster, Beilis, Calotis , Cas-
sinia, Cacalia, and Eupatorium, four of which are
frequent also in Europe, Calotis and Cassinia
being peculiar to New South Wales.
93. Elichrysum albicans.
Herbaceum, lanuginosum, folds lanceolato-line-
aribus, ramis unifloris, pedunculis nudiusculis.
Allied to E. scorpioides, Labill. Forest-land,
Cox?s River.
94. Chrysocoma squamata,Labill. Cox?s�iver.
XXV. GERANEiE, Jussieu.
95. Pelargonium australe, var, minor. Rocky
hills, Macquarie River. .


MONOCOTYLEDONES.
XXVI. ORCHIDEiE, Juss. and Br.
It is singular that the parasitical portion of this
beautiful family, which abounds in every country
within the tropic, on the continents of Asia, Africa,
and America, should exist so extremely sparingly
in that of Terra Australis, whose extent within that
circle exceeds 700 miles of latitude. The observa-
tions, however, derived from two years? experience
in South America, upon these sumptuous plants,
so far as regards their habits and situations of
growth, enable me in some degree to account for
their partial existence upon our north-west coast.
On those shores generally it may be attributed to
their geological structure, to the absence of primary
mountains, or land above an ordinary elevation, and
hence to the absence of lofty dense forests. These
are necessary to that shade and permanent atmo-
spheric moisture, which constitute essential requi-
sites to the existence of almost the whole of the
tribe.
The terrestrial part of the order may, indeed,


be considered of rather rare occurrence, and the in-
dividuals of which they are composed are seldom
found abundantly in one spot. Yet we reckon about
100 species, the maximum of which have been
observed in the colony and Van Diemen?s Land,
and constitute genera peculiar to our continent.

P. S. As a supplement to the foregoing ? Speci-
men? of the botany of Bathurst, I have great plea-
sure in being able to give an account of a new and
highly interesting plant of the natural order Big-
noniacec�, which was discovered by me towards
the close of the year 1823, in the Blue Mountains.
The exact habitat is among shady forests, abound-
ing in the tree-ferns (Dicksonia antarctica, La-
bill.*), about twenty-two miles from the entrance
* This beautiful tree-fern, which was originally discovered
at the southern extremity of Van Diemen?s Island, where
alone it has hitherto been observed, I found also very general
in the dark forests on the mountain named by the Aborigines
Tomah, which is distant from the Hawkesbury ford, at Rich-
mond, about twenty miles. Some of the caudices or trunks
of these trees are thirty-five feet in height, and measure from
twelve to sixteen inches in diameter at their base. The
stupendous size and extraordinary windings of the climbers
within these shades, particularly a cissus with quinate leaves,
whose supple stems measured from twenty to twenty-four inches
in the circumference, the weight of parasitical orchidese, filices,
&c. borne by them, as they swing to the violent winds of
these elevated lands, added to the grandeur and magnificent
appearance of the tree-ferns, failed not to picture to me and
impress me with that exuberance of tropical scenery, which in
New South Wales is occasionally to be observed in the higher
latitudes (particularly at the Five Islands). Upon entering
the dark shades of these forests, the traveller is forcibly struck


of the new route which has recently been traced
out by Mr. Bell, junr.
The plant in question appears to constitute a
new genus of the order Bignoniacecs; and from
the circumstance of its having a berried fruit, it
belongs to the division ? fructu baccato,? and con-
sequently ranges near to Mitraria of Cavanilles.
The name now proposed for the genus is in-
tended to commemorate that of a gentleman who
has, in his judicial capacity, much aided the advance-
ment of the colony of New South Wales to its
present flourishing state; and whose important
researches there, in various branches of physical
science, will materially tend to confer that interest
upon our distant settlement which it so richly
deserves, and which yet remains in a great measure
to be appreciated.

A climbing plant with a rooting stem, which
adheres to the trunks of the tree-ferns, and is very
generally diffused in moist shady woods, where it
also covers the mossy and fallen timber, reminding
me much of the beautiful scarlet-flowering para-
sitical plants, known in Brazil by the name of Pe
de Cobra. In habit it also much resembles the
Begonia urticce of Brazil. It is found likewise
at the Five Islands or Red-point of the charts.
