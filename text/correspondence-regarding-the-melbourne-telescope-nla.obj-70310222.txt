CORRESPONDENCE.
I. General Sabine to William Lassell, Esq
Burlington House, London,
October 20, 1862.
Mx dear Sir,
I enclose a copy of a despatch from the Governor of Victoria to
the Duke of Newcastle respecting the erection at Melbourne of a
telescope of greater power than any previously used in the Southern
Hemisphere ; the despatch, with its accompanying papers, have been
sent by His Grace to the Royal Society, with a request that the Pre-
sident and Council will furnish him with a report upon the subject.
You will not have forgotten the correspondence which took place
in 1852 and 1853 upon the proposition which (being then President
of the British Association) I had the honour of making to the Presi-
dent and Council of the Royal Society, for their cooperation in
representing to Her Majesty?s Government the importance of esta-
blishing a telescope of great optical power in a convenient locality in
the Southern Hemisphere. Your own letters formed a very import-
ant part of that correspondence; and as you may not have copies
of them with you, I send by the same post which conveys this letter,
a printed copy of the whole correspondence.
The Duke of Newcastle?s communication will be laid before the
Council at its first Meeting after the recess (October 24th). We
may confidently anticipate that the Council will entertain the same
opinion as that of the Royal Society and British Association at the
former period, in respect to the importance of the objects to be ob-
tained by the employment of a telescope of large power in the locality
of Melbourne, and that they will also highly appreciate the distinction
which the Colony of Victoria will acquire by this act of its Govern-
ment and Legislature. But you will perceive, by the concluding
sentence of the Minutes of the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne


Observatory, it is requested that the Report solicited from the Royal
Society may contain ? an expression of opinion as to the most suit-
able construction of telescope for the purpose, both as to the optical
part and to the mounting, together with its probable cost, and the
time requisite for its completion.? Now these are precisely the points
which appear to have occupied the chief attention of those who par-
ticipated in the correspondence of 1852 and 1853; and it is probable
that the resolutions which were agreed to at the final Meeting of the
? Committee on the Southern Telescope ? on July 5, 1853 (page 45
of the printed correspondence), may be regarded by the Council as
embodying substantially the conclusions arrived at after such long
and patient consideration. The summary of these appears to have
been that the telescope to be recommended should be a 4-feet re-
flector with mounting, <fec., as recommended in Dr. Robinson?s letter
of June 30, 1853; and that it should be made by Mr. Grubb, under
the superintendence of a Committee consisting of the Earl of Rosse,
Dr. Robinson, Mr. De la Rue, and Mr. Lassell. Mr. Grubb?s esti-
mate of the probable cost of the Telescope, two Specula, a polishing
Machine, and a one-horse power Steam-engine was �SOOO ; but as
several things in the construction were necessarily experimental, it
was put at �6OOO, ?Mr. Grubb?s estimate of the time requisite for
its completion being a twelvemonth from the date of commencement.
The Council will probably desire in the first instance to learn
whether any modifications have taken place in the opinions as to the
telescope, &c. then entertained by the four gentlemen who were willing
to undertake the responsibility of superintendence. As you are at a
distance, and time is important, I have thought it worth while to
write in anticipation of such more official communications as may be
written after the Council has met. You will probably hear from me
again by the next mail; but in the mean time Dr. Robinson has
requested me to ask you if you have with you an estimate of the
cost of your 4-feet Newtonian with its mounting.
Believe me, my dear Sir,
Faithfully yours.
William Lassell, Esq. Edward Sabine,
P.S. It may be desirable that the person selected to use the tele-
scope at Melbourne (who, I presume, will be Professor Wilson)
should be in this country during a part at least of the time in which
its construction should be in progress, and that he should avail him-
self of such opportunities as may be afforded of making himself
thoroughly conversant with the methods, &c. adopted at your own
and Lord Rosse?s observatories.
Communications referred to and enclosed, in the preceding Letter, No. I.
Downing Street, 10th October, 1862.
Sib,
I am directed by the Duke of Newcastle to transmit to you, to be
laid before the President and Council of the Royal Society, a copy of


a despatch from the Governor of Victoria, respecting the erection in
Melbourne of a telescope of greater power than any previously used
in the Southern Hemisphere.
It will be seen from this despatch that Sir H. Barkly is desirous
of obtaining the cooperation of the Royal Society towards effecting
this object, and that he would be glad if they would furnish a report
upon this subject.
His Grace feels no doubt but that the Royal Society will readily
do whatever may be in their power for encouraging science in the
Colony of Victoria.
I am, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
The Secretary of the Royal Society. T, F. Elliot.
Governor Sir H. Barkly to the Duke of Newcastle.

Government Offices, Melbourne,
23rd July, 1862.
My Lord Duke,
The Board of Visitors to the Melbourne Observatory, over which
I have the honour to preside, being of opinion that the project long
entertained, of erecting in the Southern Hemisphere a telescope of
much greater optical power than that used by Sir John Herschel at
the Cape of Good Hope, would be materially advanced by an ex-
pression of interest and sympathy on the part of scientific men in
England, has requested me to bring the subject under Your Grace?s
notice, with a view to its being submitted for the Report of the Royal
Society of London and the British Association for the Advancement
of Science.
I have great pleasure in forwarding accordingly, with the approval
of my advisers, an extract from the Board?s Minutes, together with
the accompanying letter from its Honorary Secretary, Professor
Wilson, in which the reasons for this step are so fully set forth, and
the advantages likely to arise from obtaining a powerful instrument
for this purpose so clearly explained, as to leave nothing for me to
add beyond earnestly soliciting Your Grace?s good offices in the
matter.
It will be observed that the pecuniary cooperation of the British
Government is not applied for; but I need hardly say that even the
smallest donation from that quarter would much facilitate raising
the necessary funds.
I avail myself of this opportunity to put Your Grace in possession
of the Second Annual Report of the Board of Visitors, from which
it will be found that a commencement has been made in the erection
of the new Observatory, advocated in the Report previously trans-
mitted ; and I am glad to be able further to state that a sum of
�4500 has since been voted by the Legislature for the completion of
the requisite buildings.


Should it be possible therefore to add an equatorially mounted
telescope, the Astronomical Branch of the Observatory will be ren-
dered complete, and no greater expense than at present will be in-
curred for the Staff attached to it.
I have, <fec.,

The University, Melbourne,
16th July, 1862.
Sir,
I have the honour, by direction of the Board of Visitors to the
Observatories, to forward to Your Excellency the accompanying
extract from the Minutes of a Meeting held yesterday, and to express
a hope that you will comply with the request contained in it.
Though entertaining no doubt of the importance of the results to
be obtained by such a telescope as is recommended, or of the conspi-
cuous and creditable position which Melbourne would consequently
occupy in the eyes of all persons in Europe who take an interest in
Science, the Board is desirous of obtaining an expression of opinion
from scientific men in England, because it is due to those who may
be asked to contribute towards its accomplishment that the import-
ance of the object should be attested by higher scientific authority
than the Board can lay claim to; because also it considers that every
means should be used to obtain, so far as funds will permit, the best
instrument which modern skill and recent inventions render possible;
because, finally, the Board feel that, whether the cost of the instru-
ment be defrayed wholly or partially by private contributions or a
grant from the Legislature, public sympathy will be much more
strongly enlisted in its favour by a statement of the interest taken
in the matter in Europe, and by the approval of the Imperial Go-
vernment, than by any representation which the Board can make.
I have, &c.,
(Signed) W. P, Wilson,
Secretary to the Board of Visitors.
His Excellency the Governor.
Extract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Board of Visitors to the
Observatories, held 15 July 1862.
? The attention of the Board having been drawn to the following
circumstances:?
?I. That, as long since as 1849 the facts brought to light by


Lord Rosse?s Telescope were judged by the Royal Society of London
and the British Association for the Advancement of Science to be so
important as to justify them in making an urgent appeal to the Bri-
tish Government for the erection, at some suitable place in south
latitude, of a telescope for the examination of the multiple stars and
the nebulae of the Southern Hemisphere, having greater optical power
than that used by Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope;
which appeal there is little doubt would have been successful but
for the Russian war and the consequent expenditure;
? 11. That, since that time, Lord Rosse reports that he has dis-
covered systematic changes in some of the most important northern
nebulae;
? 111. That the interest and scientific importance of the solution
of the problem of their physical structure, as well as the probability
of its accomplishment, is thus greatly increased;
? IY. That some of the most important nebulae, and those pre-
senting the greatest variety of physical features in close proximity,
can be observed only in places having a considerable southern lati-
tude ;
?Y. That the geographical position and clear atmosphere of
Melbourne render it peculiarly suitable for this work, and that the
arrangements already made for the establishment of an Astronomical
Observatory on a permanent footing offer great facilities for carry-
ing it on;
? YI. That, independently of the especial object to which such
telescope would be applied, an Astronomical Observatory cannot he
considered complete without an equatorially mounted telescope of
large optical powers:
? It was Resolved, ?
? Ist. That, in the opinion of the Board, the establishment of
such a telescope in Melbourne would materially promote the advance-
ment of science.
? 2nd. That, before applying to the Colonial Government for any
pecuniary grant in aid of this object, His Excellency the Governor
be requested to obtain, through the Secretary of State for the Colo-
nies, an expression of opinion from scientific men in England as to
the importance of the results to be expected from it; the most suit-
able construction of telescope for the purpose, both as to the optical
part and the mounting; its probable cost, and the time requisite for
its completion.?
11. William Lassell, Esq., to General Sabine, R.A.
Malta, Nov. 6, 1862.
My dear Sir,
Your letters of the 20th and 23rd ult. reached me by the same
mail on the Ist inst., and from the former having an extra stamp on
more than the weight demanded, I presume it must have been in-
tended to come by the previous mail; it bears the London Post Mark


V
of the 22nd. The printed copy of the correspondence on the Southern
Telescope in 1852 and 1853, which you mentioned having forwarded
to me, I have not yet received. [lt has arrived this evening.]
It appears to me, however, that the question of the construction
of a four-foot equatoreal has very much altered in its bearings since
the date of that correspondence, inasmuch as the problem has been
completely solved by the erection of an equatoreal precisely of that
size and description in this island. I enter upon the subject with
diffidence, because I may appear to speak too much of myself, though
I may think that good faith arid the necessity of the case make it
inevitable. I believe that the telescope I have erected is more effi-
cient and powerful, and combines more fully the desired qualities of
a large telescope, than any which has yet been made.
After a year?s experience of its use, including some small additions
to its apparatus which have been made here, I have not become
aware of any material errors which have been committed in its con-
struction, nor have any improvements of moment suggested them-
selves which would greatly add to its convenience. Some slight
additions or variations I might suggest in the building of another
similar telescope, but none I believe of very great importance. The
construction of the levers for the prevention of flexure, renders it not
desirable to observe more than about 15� north of the zenith,
though the mounting is calculated to direct the telescope within a few
degrees of the pole; and I have not as yet observed (at any hour-
angle) within 35� of it, principally because the arrangement of the
revolving tower does not admit of getting conveniently at the eye-
piece in such positions. If required to observe there, some removeable
outrigger to the tower would have to be contrived. I found it im-
possible to get access to the eyepiece near the pole and the southern
meridian with equal convenience, and therefore sacrificed the former
to the latter.
I send you by this mail a lithographic drawing of my equatoreal,
should it be thought desirable to adopt its plan. (Plate I.) It is at
least not an untried scheme, and as Melbourne is within 2� of the
same latitude as Malta, scarcely any modification would be neces-
sary. In answer to your inquiry about the cost, I may say that,
including every expense which ought fairly to be charged, it does
not quite reach 2500 pounds. And this includes steam-engine,
grinding- and polishing-machine, casting apparatus, observing-tower,
and circular railway, erecting and dismounting in Liverpool, and re-
erecting here. If I were in Liverpool the same thing could of
course be done again, and for the same sum; and I should be almost
tempted (if it were desired) to offer my superintendence as a pure
labour of love. That, however, being out of the question, I should
be glad to furnish any information I possess upon the subject, and to
place my plans and drawings at the service (for copying) of any gen-
tleman who may be appointed to superintend and carry out the work.
And here I venture to repeat the opinion expressed in my letter at
page 17 of the ? Correspondence,? that the work must be executed
entirely under the direction of a single individual. A committee may


JJ3cmitc (ith.
lAS SELL?S NEWTONIAN REFLECTING TELESCOPE.


determine generally upon the plan, but the execution I am firmly
persuaded must he confided to one alone. Messrs. George Forester
& Co., of Yauxhall Foundry, constructed almost entirely the mount-
mg, and are, I doubt not, still in possession of the working drawings
made from my original sketches. The work is of the most sub-
stantial and accurate character, fit to endure with reasonable care
for ages.
I believe I may speak with confidence of the very great efficiency
of the mounting tor the most delicate work, such as measuring in
position and distance the faint satellites of Uranus, the satellites of
Neptune, and the faint neighbouring stars of planetary nebulae, as
well as measurements of the dimensions and forms of the latter
bodies. The micrometer I use consists of thin, or rather narrow
brass bars, moveable of course in position and distance. These I
manage to illuminate without letting any sensible light into the field;
and it is really a beautiful observation to see Neptune and his con-
spicuous satellites on the blackest field with a power of 1060, while
there is abundant light on the bars to allow of their being placed in
any required position with respect to the objects to be measured; the
position and distance are read off at one observation. Of course to
do this with all attainable accuracy, tests the driving motion ; and I
have attempted occasionally to follow a practice I had with the two-
foot equatoreal, of making the contact more perfect and more en-
during by a slight regulated pressure with the fingers upon the
tube; but I find this instrument too stiff in Ml to allow me to do this
without a painful amount of pressure; and therefore, when necessary,
I have recourse to the ? slipping piece.? This disadvantage in one
respect will be thought by some to be generally an advantage, and a
very valuable one.
I he various storys of the tower form each a snug chamber about
4 ft. 6 in. square, in which the observer is protected from the wind
or dew, though close to the eyepiece, and has his writing or draw-
mg materials on a fall-table close to his hand. The skeleton-tube is
a great improvement upon the closed one, and I attribute in a great
measure to this form, the fact that I am very rarely driven to close
the observatory from atmospherical disturbance; though of course
with so large a telescope and with high powers, some vibration is
always perceptible. I feared that this open form of tube would have
subjected me to drops of dew falling from the bars upon the mirror,
and had contrived a means of obviating it: but the annoyance does not
exist. On not more than two or three of the most dewy nights have
I detected some half dozen drops on covering up the mirror. I may
add that if they should remain unwiped they leave no stain ; the
alloy is so pure that I have as yet detected no indication of tarnish
whatever.
It is therefore by no means necessary to repolish frequently, though
there is no reason for hesitation on the ground of risk; for with the
usual amount of care in the operation, a good and efficient surface, at
least, may be always depended on. The process when resorted to
consumes a day, and the operation of taking out one speculum and


putting in another a like period. I may be observing today until
midnight, or until dawn with A, and before sunset tomorrow B shall be
in its place and ready for observation?the work of two individuals.
With respect to permanence of adjustment, I have never touched
the polar-axis screw since it was first set up, nor have any observa-
tions sufficed to indicate any sensible error. The inevitable labour
of turning so large a telescope about from 3 or 4 hours angle on
different sides of the meridian and at various polar distances, with
the apparent inutility of such an operation, has prevented my un-
dertaking it, since I do not pretend to give absolute places, since I
have no difficulty in finding any objects I want at once, and since
when I want especial accuracy, a star from some catalogue and the
micrometer enable me to obtain it. I believe the defining power is
quite equal to that of any two-foot equatoreal, which is more than
I expected originally to obtain. How well it defines it is difficult to
express in words, that can only be known by personal examination ;
or perhaps it may in some degree be inferred from the series of
drawings of the phenomena of the surface of Mars which I have
made during the late opposition. I acknowledge, however, that I
have not been able to do any justice to the number and variety and
delicacy of the shades and tracery of his disk. The best magnifying
power on fine nights was usually 760.
The full time occupied in the construction of my equatoreal was
between three and four years ; and although much less divided atten-
tion might be given to the erection of another than I was able to
afford, I do not think it could be accomplished in less than 18 months,
even if all went well and much diligence were used. In Mr. Grubb?s
estimate, page 37 of the ? Correspondence,? is the status of the ob-
server included, and the machinery necessary for placing him con-
veniently at the eyepiece in all required positions of the instrument ?
this is a rather formidable part of the work. Does it also include
driving motion, and cost of erecting for examination and taking
down ?
I feel that I need to apologise for the length of this letter, from
which I fear you will conclude that I have thought it better to say
too much than too little.
I have indeed thought it desirable to make the Committee as fully
acquainted as I can in a letter with the qualities of the instrument
I have put up, and have only to add that if they think it worth
while to depute any competent gentleman to come over and acquaint
himself with the construction, use, and optical powers of this tele-
scope, I shall be glad to afford him the opportunity of the fullest
examination, and to place what information I possess upon the sub-
ject at his disposal.
Believe me to remain,
My dear Sir,
Very truly yours,
William Lassell.
To General Sabine, R.A.,
President of the Royal Society.


111, The Rev. T. R. Robinson to General Sabine, Pres. R.S.
October 23, 1862.
The conviction of the importance of a searching examination of
the Southern Nebulae with an instrument of great optical power,
which I expressed in my letter to Lord J. Russell (Brit. Assoc.
Report, 1850), has been strengthened by the facts recently observed
by D?Arrest and others in the northern hemisphere, respecting
the variable character of some of these strange forms, and by Lord
Rosse?s observations lately communicated to the Royal Society,
which indicate in a few considerable proper motion and even physical
changes. It is evident that in the investigation of such variations
time is a most important element; and future astronomers will look
back with unavailing regret to the present opportunity of leaving
them so precious a record of half the sky if it be permitted to pass
away without results. As to the means of carrying out such a
survey, l am not aware that much can be added to what is contained
in the printed correspondence. Since its conclusion, Mr. Lassell has
successfully constructed a Newtonian of the same aperture (4 feet)
as that proposed for the southern telescope. This shows that there
is no special difficulty in such an enterprise, either as to the telescope
or its equatorial mounting; but I retain my original preference
for the Cassegrain as far more manageable, and, I may add, better
adapted to photography. The application of silver surfaces to form
specula which has been made by M. Foucault, seems very promising,
but has not yet been sufficiently tested by experience for me to re-
commend its trial in a case where failure would not only interrupt
our hopes of a great astronomical achievement, but would also
probably weaken the efforts of those who are endeavouring to
diffuse a taste for science in this prosperous and energetic colony.
There seems a tinge of exaggeration in the account of the telescope
which M. Chacornae is trying that inspires doubt; and some un-
certainty prevails as to the actual reflective power of the silver film.
Nor have we sufficient knowledge whether the process which availed
to figure a glass disk of 33 inches would be equally successful for one
of 48 inches; or whether such a disk might not be more affected in its
curvatures by changes of temperature than one of better conducting-
power. The Foucault system could easily be adapted to the small
mirror; or in the Cassegrain (as has been tried successfully) this might
be an achromatic combination silvered at its posterior surface. But as
to the great speculum, I think the usual material is safest at present.
T. R. Robinson.
General Sabine, Pres. R.S.
IY. Sir J. F. W. Herschel to General Sabine.
Collingwood, October 29, 1862.
My dear General Sabine,
I have received and carefully read the copy of the correspondence
of the present year in the matter of the great reflector for the Mel-


bourne Observatory, and the extracts from the Minutes of the Meeting
of the Colonial Board of Visitors of Observatories accompanying your
letter. In reply to the request contained in your letter, that I should
offer such remarks on the subject as may occur to me, I beg to say
that my opinion as to the desirableness of such an instrument at
that or some other equally well-situated station in the south hemi-
sphere has been of late materially strengthened by the instances of
change in the brightness and general appearance of nebulae in the
northern hemisphere, which have of late been brought forward, and
which, in two cases at least, appear to be undeniably authenticated
(that of the Nebula M. 80, and the last Nebula of Hind). To these
instances I am enabled to add another and, if possible, more striking
example of change which has manifested itself in the great southern
Nebula surrounding Argus. In a letter which I have lately re-
ceived from Mr. Eyre B. Powell, late Principal of Madras College,
(himself a good observer, and who has contributed very valuable
observations of double stars and computations of their orbits, and
whose statement of what he himself has observed during a continued
series of micrometrical measures of the stars around t) Argus may
therefore, I conceive, be fully relied on,) he expresses himself to this
effect.
? One point I consider particularly worthy of attention, viz.
that while in your diagram of the Nebula the southern end of the
curious oval vacuity is clearly bounded, it is now decidedly open.?
This oval, with its perfectly well marked and most completely closed
southern boundary, I was at peculiar pains to delineate with the
utmost precision, and the course of that boundary is marked by the
positions of small stars in close proximity to its edge most carefully
laid down (vide my account and figure of this nebula in my Cape
Observations) ; and as it seems impossible to cast any doubt on so
direct and circumstantial a statement as that of Mr. Powell, we have
here an instance of change which must be regarded as perfectly reli-
able ; nor can I imagine anything more important to our knowledge
of these wonderful bodies than to obtain as early as possible exact
delineations of the present state of this, and, of course, of all the other
irregularly-shaped nebulae of the Southern Hemisphere, by the aid of
a very powerful reflector.
As regards the general form and construction of the telescope?
referring to my former letter of March 1853, printed in the ? Corre-
spondence of the Southern Telescope Committee,? ?I should continue
to insist on the following points there specified, whatever be the con-
struction and mode of mounting, viz.:?lst. The use of a very perfect
internal collimator. 2ndly. The adoption of a skeleton tube. As
regards the uniform support of the mirror, since it appears to be now
a received maxim in the construction of large specula that they must
be polished in water, and lying on their backs on the actual system
of support which is to sustain them in the tube, this of course puts an
end to the idea of supporting them on beds of any elastic material
other than metallic, and the rusting of steel springs would be fatal
to their substitution. But the principle of swing suspension, by


a band round the edge to take off the distorting pressure of the
vertical component of the weight on a point or on a small portion of
the edge, I still regard as most important and indispensable.
Dr. Robinson, I observe in the letter sent me (which I reinelose),
continues to recommend the Cassegrainian construction. Its great
advantage in shortening the telescope I fully admit, but I continue
to regard this as much counterbalanced by the excessive distress
caused to the observer who shall have to continue observing for
many successive hours with his head elevated to a great angle with
the horizon, and in many cases to recline on an observing-chair. I
speak from feeling experience of this inconvenience (as contrasted
with the comfort of the Newtonian or the front view), and I am
persuaded it will act to shorten the hours of observation from mere
physical inability to go on. But I agree with Dr. Robinson in de-
precating the hazard of an experiment on so great a scale as the
construction of a silvered glass large mirror on the principle of
Steinheil and Foucault.
The only reason which would greatly weigh with me in favour of
an equatorial in preference to a meridian mounting is the immense
advantage such a telescope would afford for examining the physical
construction of comets. In this class of observations, as in that of
nebulae, increase of illumination is the paramount consideration. The
difference of appearance of one and the same comet under telescopes
of high and low illuminating power must be seen to be duly appre-
ciated. Mr. Lassell appears to find his recently constructed equa-
torial mounting work satisfactorily, but on this point he will no
doubt communicate the result of his own experience.
Finally, if the aperture 4-feet be not already held to be irrevocably
fixed upon, I should feel half inclined to open the question of a 5-feet
for the reconsideration of the Committee.
I remain,
My dear General,
Yours very truly,
J. F. W. Heeschel,
P.S. Nov. 19,1862. ?Since writing the above I have been favoured
with the perusal of Mr. LasselTs letter, dated Nov. 5, 1862 (and
herewith reinelosed). By this I find, Ist, that his system of levers
for the prevention of flexure in the mirror does not admit of, or at
all events renders it undesirable to observe more than about 15�
north, i. e., to the polar side of the zenith ; and 2ndly, that the con-
struction of his tower does not admit of getting conveniently at the
eyepiece within 35� of the pole.
Now these conditions would I fear be fatal to the use of the in-
strument at Melbourne, for the observation of the southern nebulae.
The immediate neighbourhood of the South Pole, indeed, is not rich
in objects of interest. There is, to be sure, a faint nebula within half
a degree of the pole (h. 3176), but from thence to S.P.D. 9� 59' (say
10�) (where there is a fine planetary nebula, h. 3241), there occur
only five nebulae, all of little interest. This region then might be
sacrificed without material injury. But the two nubeculae are


objects of paramount importance and interest. The nubecula major
extends from S.P.D. 18� to 24�, or fron zenith dist. 28� to 34�, and the
nubecula minor from S.P.D, 15� to 18�, zenith dist. 34� to 37�. The
great nebula about t] Argus itself is only 31� 13' from the pole,
and passes above the pole at Z.D. 20� 47', taking the latitude of Mel-
bourne at 38� S, Unless therefore Mr. Lassell?s construction can be
so very considerably modified as to allow these objects at least to be
observed with every possible advantage, I fear it must be abandoned.
Indeed I should consider perfect facility of observing up to 10� S.P.D.
or Z.D. 42� south quite indispensable.
J, F. W. Herschel.
V. The Earl of Rosse to General Sabine.
Dublin, October 30, 1862.
Dear Sabine,
I have not received the correspondence from Mr. White, but I
sufficiently recollect the purport of it. The only change lam aware
of, which has since taken place, is the construction by Mr. Lassell of
a telescope similar in aperture, and very similar in mounting to the
one recommended.
If Mr. Lassell is quite satisfied with his mounting, I do not see
why an exact fac-simile of it should not be made. There could not
be anything cheaper, and although I do not think differential obser-
vations beyond the range of the micrometer could be obtained with
much accuracy with it, as the position of the polar axis is maintained
by rollers, still for work upon the nebulae it would probably answer
sufficiently well. Upon this point, as also upon the question of
steadiness, if there was time, it might be well to consult Mr. Lassell.
Mr. Lassell, no doubt, as we do, has kept his patterns, and, I am sure,
would be most happy to lend them. That would save expense.
I think it essential that some one should accompany the telescope
as a mechanical assistant? he having been the principal operator in
grinding and polishing the specula. Some intelligent optical glass-
grinder who was sufficiently educated to read and understand all that
had been written on the construction of reflecting telescopes, would
probably answer.

Dear Sabine,
I have read Herschel?s letter with much interest, and agree with
him in everything. The only objection to the increase of size he
suggests is the expense, which probably would be more than doubled.
Believe me to be,
Truly yours,
General Sabine. Rosse.


YII. The Rev. T. R. Robinson to Major-General Sabine.
Castle, Parsonstown, Dec. 4, 1862.
My dear Friend,
Since my letter to you on the Southern Telescope, I have been fa-
voured by your kindness with a perusal of letters on the same sub-
ject from Lord Eosse, Sir J. Herschel, and Mr. Lassell.
Mr. LasselTs communication is very interesting, as describing his
success in constructing and mounting equatorially a four-foot tele-
scope, which seems a very good one, and with which he is un-
doubtedly doing good work. But with the conclusion to which he
seems to come, that this construction is the best possible, and should
be implicitly adopted, I am not disposed to agree.
It seems to me, if I rightly understand your wishes, that it is not
our province to decide on any particular construction, but in the first
instance to supply the Council with an expression of our general
opinion as to the feasibility and great importance of a Southern Ee-
flector; and secondly, to give whatever practical information we have
acquired since the former Correspondence. This the Council may,
if they think it necessary, make the subject of a separate communi-
cation to the Melbourne Astronomer ; but it is, I think, highly in-
expedient to bring before public men our discussions as to the best
mode of doing the work.
In reference to the first of these objects, I think the letters con-
tain all that can be required; but with respect to the other, Mr.
Lassell?s letter seems to be liable to several objections, based on
some facts which he mentions, and also on the lithograph which ac-
companies it.
1. The upright standards between which the telescope turns, are
weak. Mr. Lassell has felt this; for there appears a transverse
trussing marked ? removeable, ? obviously designed to prevent
flexure when the telescope is a few hours off the meridian: this I
fear would be an imperfect remedy. I cannot ascertain from the
drawing whether the declination-axis is provided with counterpoises
and friction-wheels to diminish its friction; but if not, it will bear
very severely on the flanches of this axis, especially in the position
of 6 hours off the meridian. The flexion of these standards may in-
terfere greatly with the adjustments of the instrument, if they be not
of equal strength.
2. The support of the polar axis on friction-rollers at its upper
bearings is, as Lord Eosse has remarked, fatal to any precise determi-
nation of absolute places. Mr. Lassell appears to admit this, but not
to think it of much importance, ?as he can always find an object
which he wants,? and, ? when greater accuracy is required, a star
taken from a catalogue with the micrometer will give it.? On this
I must remark that, in the first place, it is not always easy to identify
the stars of comparison, and that in nebular work there will be a
great waste of time unless the instrument can give position within a
small fraction of a minute. Mr. Lassell seems in fact not to have
taken much trouble in verifying his adjustments, and explains this
by ? the inevitable labour of turning so large an instrument about


from 3 to 4 hours' angle on different sides of the meridian and at
various polar distances.? It may be inferred from this that there is
considerable difficulty in moving it. He has stated in the Monthly
Notices of the Astronomical Society that the moving parts weigh 12
tons?a large mass certainly, but I think that with proper mechanical
appliances its motion should not require such hard work. The
counterpoise on the polar axis must make the movement in HI more
difficult.
3. The tower seems ricketty and even dangerous. There may be
guards for the observer not shown in the lithograph, but even with
them his position in a dark night will be perilous. And as Mr.
Lassell mentions that with this arrangement he cannot observe within
35� of the pole at any hour-angle, Sir John Herschel?s remarks are
decisive against it. If, in addition to ? the labour of moving the te-
lescope,? the observers have to manoeuvre this complicated scaffolding,
the most probable result is that it will scarcely ever be used except
near the meridian.
4. Mr, Lassell?s estimate of <�2500 for such an instrument is, I fear,
lower than any optician is likely to accept. I understand it to in-
clude the telescope, equatoreal, tower, and its railways, steam-en-
gine, machine for polishing and grinding, grinder and polisher, with
two specula, besides the cost of erecting, dismounting, and re-erecting.
If the specula be of the same proportion as Lord Rosse?s, they will
each be 2 tons; their raw material will cost -�400; and as a commercial
speculation, I do not think any one would undertake the risks of
casting, annealing, grinding, and polishing for less than �lOOO more,
which leaves a very small margin for the rest. But this concerns the
Melbourne gentlemen, who will of course obtain detailed estimates,
5. The report of the action of the skeleton tube confirms Lord
Rosse?s results from one which he had applied to his three-foot te-
lescope. I send a photograph of this latter, which I consider de-
cidedly preferable from its great mechanical strength and large air-
way.
6. There appears to be some difficulty about the levers which
equilibrate the mirror in the direction of its plane, so that they do not
act rightly more than 15� on the polar side of the zenith. This can
probably be obviated; but lam induced by my own experience (cer-
tainly on a much smaller scale) to think that the plan of supporting
the edge of the mirror in a flexible metallic ring will be quite suf-
ficient even for one of four feet, and that it should be tried before
recourse is made to the more complex arrangement. As to the back-
support, we know that the equilibrated levers used by Lord Rosse
work very well; but I cannot help speculating on an elastic bedding
such as worked so well with Sir J. Herschel, and recently with M.
Foucault. As it must be water-proof, we are limited to some
structure of metal combined with caoutchouc, or to a piston sliding
in an air-tight cylinder. For a six-foot speculum weighing 4 tons,
the pressure on each square inch of such a support is only 2-2 lbs.
7. Mr. Lassell asks if Mr. Grubb?s estimate includes a driving-
clock, and if he has provided for the status of the observer. The


clock is included, and also a differential hour-circle. As to the
other, since the eye-end of the telescope (Cassegrain) travels in
a sphere of only six-feet radius, an observing chair of simple con-
struction and moderate size is amply sufficient. Lord Eosse has
remarked that a skilled mechanic should take part in the polishing,
and afterwards accompany the telescope when erected at Melbourne!
In the principle I fully concur; but perhaps it might be better if
the Australian observer himself were to come over, and while the
process was going on, make himself familiar with all its details.
The polishing large specula is ? skilled work ? of the highest order,
and I do not think it can be effectually superintended by a mere
mechanic.
Sincerely yours,
T. E. Eobikson.

0 Malta, Dec. 1, 1862.
Mv dear Sir,
I have today had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 20th
ultimo, enclosing some remarks of Sir John Herschel upon mine to
you of the sth. I avail myself of the Alexandrian mail now hourly
expected for a few words in reply.
I fully appreciate Sir John?s requirements of ?perfect facility of
observing up to 10� S.P.D., or Z.D. 42� 5.,? and proceed to state how,
by a slight modification of my mounting, it would be completely
satisfied. J
By omitting the loose cross marked ?removeable ? in my drawing,
and giving about a foot more length to the wrought-iron supports of
the ends of the P.D. axis, the telescope would have a motion quite
up to the pole itself; and to ensure the effective action of the levers
for horizontal support, it would be only necessary, when the meri-
dional zenith-distance towards the pole became greater than about
15�, to turn the telescope on its axis 180� by the existing apparatus;
so that the eyepiece should point westward instead of eastward, and
bring the tower round to that side. It would also be necessary to
have a P.D. arc on the western as well as the eastern support, with
tangent screw and locking apparatus, to which in this position of the
telescope, the connecting-rod (being disengaged from its former posi-
tion and carried round with the tube) would have now to be re-en-
gaged. Thus the instrument by this slight addition would command
equatorially every star above the horizon.
To enable the observer to gain access to the eyepiece when the
object was near the pole, above or below, it would be necessary to
introduce a third rail, the same distance from the outer one which


that is from the inner, and to make the lowest beams of the frame-*
work of the tower to travel outwards on two parallel rails extending
from the inner rail to the new outer or third rail ?thus allowing
the framework of the tower to rest at pleasure either, as it now does,
on the inner and what would then be the middle rail, or on the
middle and new outer rail. This would ensure access to the eyepiece
in every possible position of the telescope.
Though I have had a very short interval to consider the subject,
I feel perfectly satisfied that the above easily-carried-out additions
would quite answer the requirements insisted on by Sir John Herschel.
I remain,
My dear Sir,
Very truly yours,
General Sabine. Wm. Lassell.
IX. The Earl of Eosse to General Sabine.
The Castle, Parson stown,
Dec. 3, 1862.
Dear Sabine,
Dr. Robinson has just shown me Mr. Lassell?s letter of Nov. 5. I
was not aware that his telescope would not reach the pole. Probably it
would be sufficient could it be made to do so at moderate distances from
the meridian. lam not sure whether I should not be disposed to
recommend in the first instance a common cheap wooden stand like
Herschel?s, or perhaps one on the same principle, but in the more
substantial form of our 3-foot telescope. With the lattice tube the
wind acts but little upon it. Such an instrument has done good
work in Herschel?s hands, and with us it is constantly employed in
making lunar drawings, the want of an equatorial motion being
scarcely felt. In such a case it would be only necessary to send out
the specula; and even that perhaps would not be necessary, as with
a competent person I should think they might be made on the spot.
I am only suggesting the cheapest and easiest way of bringing
great power to bear upon the objects in the Southern Hemisphere,
and not for a moment proposing an inferior method of mounting, if
the equatorial (the best) can be attained. As to the Cassegrain
form, my experience is limited to specula of 18 inches? aperture, and
very few experiments have been made with them; lam quite unable
to say whether they define as well as Newtonians or not.
I have been reminded by Dr. Robinson that in my last paper I
have omitted to mention a little expedient we have long been in the
habit of resorting to, especially in polishing with simple pitch, that
of raising the temperature of the room, and consequently of the
polishing tool, above the temperature of the speculum. In this way
the necessary yielding of the pitch is provided for, without softening
the surface in contact with the speculum. When the process is not
proceeding successfully, by then raising the temperature of the room


a few degrees good contact will often be procured, and the disappoint-
ment of a failure prevented.
This hint may be valuable to persons who have not so much expe-
rience.
Believe me to bo,
Truly yours,
General Sabine, Eosse.
X. The Earl of Basse to General Sabine.
The Castle, Parsonstown,
Dec. 9, 1862.
Dear Sabine,
I have forwarded LasselTs letter of Dec. Ito Dr. Eobinson. I see
no reason why LasselTs mounting, modified in the way he proposes,
should not answer, provided the main supports, which are to be
lengthened, are made sufficiently strong?much stronger than they
are at present. They, in my opinion, constitute the weak part of the
mounting. They are theoretically weak, and that they have been
found weak in practice is evident, as otherwise the moveable bracing
would not have been employed. The great merit of LasselTs mount-
ing is its cheapness; for it is almost all the work of a founder and
boiler-maker, and at Manchester and Liverpool there are special ap-
pliances which make such work cheap. In the case of the German
type there is much forging, turning, and fitting, and therefore there
is greater cost unavoidably; but where expense is not an object it
has many advantages. Lassell, I understand, casts his specula at one
melting, making use of a bell-founder?s cupola, and probably is enabled
to procure trained men, and every thing necessary (except the mould
and annealing oven) at some large bell-founding establishment. In
that there will necessarily be a great saving. Hitherto it has been
considered important that there should be two meltings, and there-
fore to prevent oxidation the melting-pot has been employed instead
of the cupola or reverberatory furnace ; but Mr. Lassell seems to find
the single melting sufficient: the only object of the second melting
is to procure an alloy more dense and more free from pores; but
that is a secondary object, compared to the all-important one, of
eventually polishing the speculum successfully.
Believe me to be,
Truly yours,
General Sabine. Eosse.
XI. Sir J. F. W. Herschel to General Sabine.
Collingwood, Dec. 10, 1862.
Mt dear General Sabine,
I sent the photograph by last night?s post, and I now return you
Lord Eosse?s, Dr. Eobinson?s, and Mr. LasselTs letters.
I concur entirely in the following points :
1. To recommend the supplying of a 4-foot reflecting telescope to
Melbourne, the large speculum to be of metal, not glass.
b 2


2. The mounting to be such as to be efficient for observing any
object above the horizon with ease and safety.
3. The tube to be a skeleton one.
4. The cost, if possible, not to exceed ,�4500, but not less than
.�5OOO to be applied for, as I really cannot imagine how it can be
completed and conveyed to Melbourne and erected there for less than
the former sum, leaving any profit to the artist employed.
5. That it is very desirable Prof. Wilson should come over to
look to the construction, and to see the process of polishing and
mode of observing.
6. That the means of repolishing the speculum should be fur-
nished.
I have read the three letters with all due attention,but, after giving
every weight to what Mr. Lassell says, I have still misgivings about
the adaptability of the equatorial construction to the purpose con-
templated, and I begin now to lean to the idea of an altazimuth
mounting in wood with a good deal of iron, bracing and tying about
it?the round motion to be on a circular iron railway, and a system
of pushing and pulling screw clamps to tighten up any local loose-
ness of bearing, so as it were to jam the frame in the position it is
to have during the observation, and to obviate all lateral totter arising
from warping or shrinkage of wood, or expansion and contraction of
iron. I cannot help fancying that an equatoreal so constructed as to
pass across the pole would require such a length of support for the
declination-axis as to be a fearful element of weakness, considering
the enormous weight it would have to bear in all sorts of positions,
and with no possibility of counterpoising any part of it. Nor can I
quite reconcile myself to the mode of sustaining the observer when
the telescope is directed to the zenith. Certainly Mr. Lassell?s tower
would have to be advanced bodily on its horizontal bar supports in a
way and to an extent that I should not like to depend on.
Now in an altazimuth mounting on my father?s principle, with ad-
dition of a framework for the counterpoises, there is no more diffi-
culty or discomfort in observing in the zenith, or between the zenith
and pole, or at or below the pole, than in any other direction. Any
object in any part of the heavens can be equally well observed, and
with a little contrivance, a slow motion to follow an object for a rea-
sonable time without moving the framework in azimuth might readily
be devised.
Such a mounting would be very far cheaper than an iron equa-
torial one (in which assuredly all the parts that are to sustain
weights variable in direction ought to be forged in wrought iron with
the utmost care). It has been proved efficient for the purposes for
which such an instrument is wanted in the southern hemisphere?
viewing and delineating nebulae and comets, and discovering new
nebulae, &c. It will give places quite satisfying Dr. Eobinson?s postu-
late ? within a small fraction of a minute? with dependable facility
(and that even when so roughly constructed as my 20-foot stand?
much more so when executed as works of the kind now are) ; and by
differential observations questions of proper motion, &c. would be


C H
U-uJ-J
,Cll i tinl
r\
fully within its reach. Any how, there must be no daring expert-
ment incurring risk of failure.
From Lord Rosse?s photograph it would appear that he has adopted
Mr. Ramage?s form of wood-work, in which the lateral stays rest on
a short cross-beam, and are much more highly inclined to the ho-
rizon than the front and back ladders. This (as I have pointed out
in my article on the Telescope in the Cyclop. Britannica) is an element
of instability, and for a telescope of this size would, I think, be very
objectionable. For the foundation frame I should be apt to propose
something in the nature of the annexed woodcut, in which the thick
lines represent wood, and the thin iron,?the large frame ABEF
A'B'E'F' being laid down first, and over it, connected by bolts, but
not by any mortising or letting in to the same level, but laid on it,
the cross pieces CD, HC of the transverse frame CDGH to support
the lateral represented in projection by dotted lines, Ga, Ha,
Db, Cb, attached aloft to ah, the ends of the cross top beam. These
cross-pieces, with two others, IK, JL (equally laid on the lower beams
and not under-cut), would form a bed for the rails carrying the lower
end of the tube and the speculum?the whole revolving on a cir-
cular rail on rollers, and the centre work being connected with the
wood frame by an interior iron ring bolted on to all the beams.
The whole to be strengthened by diagonal ties of iron ad libitum.
I cannot conclude this without once more expressing my strong
repugnance to the Cassegrainian and Gregorian construction, on the
grounds expressed in my former letter. I feel certain that it would
entail the sacrifice of much valuable observation from mere phy-
sical exhaustion in the observer.
I remain,
My dear General,
Yours very truly,
General Sabine. J. F. W. Hbbscitel.


XII. The Rev. T. R. Robinson to Major-General Sabine.
Armagh, Observatory, Dec. 15, 1862.
Mr dear Friend,
I send with this a letter from Mr. Grubb, in which he has stated
some matters which he wishes me to make known to you. He has
sent with it a photographic representation of his proposed construc-
tion, with references. His wish to make the aperture in the Casse-
grain speculum smaller, arises from a desire to lessen the thickness of
glass in the field lens of the lowest eyepiece (which he supposed to
be 9 inches aperture), and for the same reason he wishes to make
the aperture of this lens less in proportion to its focal length than I
had assumed, namely 0-5. I find that, taking this proportion 0-4,
and the focal length of the great speculum 32 feet, the aperture need
only be 7?3 inches; but then the field of view will only be 11' instead
of 13 -9 with 8-11 inches, the aperture which I had proposed.
I thank you for the perusal of Sir J. Herschel?s letter of the 10th
inst. There is much of it in which I fully concur; but there are
some parts which I think are open to objection.
1. I cannot at all doubt the practicability of equatorially mount-
ing a 4-foot telescope : even if Mr. Lassell had not shown its practi-
cability, it is a simple question of engineering; and lam sure any
competent engineer, looking at Mr. Grubb?s photograph, will see at
once that it is quite adequate to carry steadily a tube which with its
speculum need not be more than 4 tons weight. Mechanically it is
far stronger than Mr. Lassell?s ; and, now that Bessemer?s steel is in
the market, by the use of that material in the declination-axis its
strength may be doubled. I may also remark that, though the
equatoreal does cross the pole, its declination-axis is of no dangerous
length, and seems effectually counterpoised.
2. I am at a loss to conceive why Sir J. Herschel thinks a Casse-
grain or Gregorian will cause such ? physical exhaustion of the ob-
server.? The eye-end in Mr. Grubb?s plan moves in a less sphere than
that of a 12-inch achromatic; and I never heard that the Struves,
Bond, or indeed any one who uses a refractor, find such a difficulty.
On the other hand, I know by experience that climbing lofty ladders
or even walking up and down stairs for a long night?s work is really
fatiguing.
3. If it were a question between an altazimuth mounting and no
southern telescope, I would of course accept the former; but I think
that to adopt it without absolute necessity is a real retrogression
which would be bitterly repented, especially as we have no reason
to suppose that the Melbourne authorities are not disposed to do their
work well. Let us not raise up difficulties. It is undoubtedly true
that in Sir J. Herschel?s hands the 20-foot reflector has wrought
wonders; but there are few indeed like him, and even he must excuse
me for thinking that ho could have done still more with it, had its
mounting been equatorial. This at least follows from my own expe-


a - - r f ; ? ?> ? , P
ifience. On the one hand, I have worked a good deal with Lord
Rosse?s 3-foot, which is as steady and convenient as anything of the
kind can he, and with Sir James South?s 12-inch achromatic on a
good mounting of the same kind; on the other, lam familiar with
Mr. Cooper?s great equatoreal; and I must say that there can be no
doubt as to the superiority of the latter. Had it been altazimuth,
Mr. C. could not have published his Ecliptic Catalogue for many years
to come, I wish also to observe that I do not think a wooden
mounting desirable for so large an instrument; even in these
climates it is not durable, and under the hotter sun of Melbourne it
would probably be less so; nor will wood and iron act well together
under extreme changes of temperature.
It is obvious that micrometer measures off the meridian have much
difficulty except with an equatoreal.
The Cassegrain has great advantage over the Newtonian in respect
of celestial photography. The image in the focus of the great spe-
culum must be magnified. Now if this be done by an eyepiece there
are two evils. Glass stops a far greater proportion of the photogra-
phic rays than a speculum absorbs; and from the wide range of their
refrangibility, they cannot be brought to an accurate focus. Quartz
lenses would obviate the first, but not the second. On the other
hand, the second speculum of the Cassegrain performs the magnifying
without any help, and with perfect convergence of all rays to the
same focus.
Sincerely yours,
T. R. Robinson.
Major-General Sabine.
XIII. Mr. Grubb to Dr. Robinson.
Dublin, Dec. 3, 1862.
Mv dear Dr. Robinson,
The plans and estimate which about nine years since I trans-
mitted for the consideration of the Committee, at that time formed
to report on the erecting of a powerful telescope in the Southern
Hemisphere, having had the honour of being approved of by that
Committee (although the design was never carried into effect on
account of the British Government declining to supply the requisite
funds), it seems desirable, now that the same Committee are recon-
sidering the matter at the request of some of the spirited inhabitants
of Melbourne, that I should, as the successful projector on the former
occasion, prepare for laying before the present Committee such data
as circumstances occurring during the interval suggest.
I would then first state that nothing has presented itself to induce
me to alter even in details the original design, much less to disturb my
faith in its entire effectiveness, I have, however, made drawings to
suit the latitude of Melbourne, a copy of which on a reduced scale,
together with a descriptive reference, I propose shall accompany this


letter. Of the stability of the mounting I apprehend no doubt can
arise, while its freedom of motion is ensured by the introduction of
that peculiar system of equipoise first introduced in the large equa-
toreal exhibited by me in the recent International Exhibition. It
mi! be seen that the inversion of the polar axis in the present design
admits of using a comparatively small pivot for the lower bearing;
while the near approach of the great mass of the entire moving weight
to this pivot is most favourable to increased steadiness, and to both
ease and accuracy of the movement in JR. And if it be desired either
now or at a future time to erect a telescope of 5-feet diameter (in-
stead of 4-feet), I consider that the sizes given for the equatorial
mounting would safely carry the larger telescope. It is, however, an
error on the right side to have more than adequate strength and
Btifmess in the mounting, more especially where such extra strength
does not involve any undesirable amount of labour, or any extra con-
sumption of time in the required changing of the position of the in-
strument.
Tube.?A ventilated tube appears very desirable. The only drawing
of one which I have seen (Mr. LasselTs) appears to be liable to consi-
derable flexure; in short, if theory be good for aught, it must have a
good deal?to which, and not to its stiffness, I would look to account
for the apparent difficulty which I understand to exist of causing a
displacement of the image by a pressure by hand at the upper end of
the tube, the tube probably giving way at that end under the pres-
sure, without causing the other end, including the large speculum, to
follow. In the drawing which accompanies this letter I have indi-
cated a construction for the tube, viz. ? latticed,? with internal dia-
phragms, which combines rigidity with lightness and some approach
to elegance. 1
Details of focal length. ?lt may seem premature to speak here of
these, but as some disadvantage has been suggested as pertaining to the
use of a small metal of 9 inches diameter (in the 4-feet aperture of
the large mirrors), I think it desirable to mention that in adopting
the Cassegrain form of telescope, I consider that the focus of the large
mirror need not be more than 8 diameters, or say 32 feet, and that
in such case the lowest eyepiece may have a sufficiently large field
(assuming the pencil it produces to be 0-2 in. diameter), the diameter
of the small mirror, of the field lens, and of the hole in large speculum
being made 7 inches only. 8 P
The supporting of the large speculum.?ln respect of this important
point, I fully expect it will be found that there is no necessity for
incurring the inconveniences and disadvantages of an elastic support.
It is I apprehend conceded that the system of equilibrated support*
as originally devised by me, is adequate to the support at the hacJc of
the speculum. It appears also to be generally admitted that if the
lateral support of the speculum be effected by its being suitably slung
in an open hoop, or thus > same part being always below,
no flexure is produced. If so, then any plan by which the ? suitable ?


pi
if* III
slinging of the speculum in all positions would be ensured ought to
be effective, i. e. should not induce flexure in the speculum. Now
there may be several ways of effecting this; but I shall only describe
that one which appears to be perfect in principle, and has been quite
successful in practice in the case of a rather weak speculum, via. of
20 inches aperture and 1*25 only in thickness.
This speculum, previously ground to a tolerably true figure on
the back with the least possible reducing of its thickness, was next
ground true on edge. The speculum being supported on the lever
apparatus was ground and polished, and the lateral supporting effected
as shown by the annexed diagram:?
in which A represents a portion of the speculum; B section of a
trued ring or hoop having 2 diameters internally, the upper or lesser
diameter being such as moderately embraced the speculum, a single
thickness of fine cloth being placed between; C a second trued ring
attached by screws to the inside of the speculum box, D, and finally
trued after being permanently attached to D ; B is fitted to C, not
tightly, but so as to be free to move up and down, and B is prevented
from bearing at bottom edge upon C by an elastic medium (or springs)
between.
This method of lateral support appears to possess the following
qualifications:?viz. Ist. It supports the speculum laterally, equally
well in every position, and therefore no advantage results from keep-
ing the speculum in the one position, nor disadvantage in rolling it
into all positions. 2nd. Whatever portion of the speculum happens
to be above is not in close contact with the surrounding hoop (B),
and is therefore free to take its proper bearing on the back levers,
while the opposite or lower portion (or edge) of the speculum, in
pressing upon the ring B, discharges that portion of the ring B from
contact with C. It may be said that, although free movement is thus
provided for at top and bottom, it is not so at the sides; but it must
not be forgotten that in regulating the tightness (or looseness) of the
speculum in its ring B, and between the rings B and C, we have the
power, to any desirable extent, of keeping the hoop B from pressing
upon the sides of the speculum (near its horizontal diameter), and
therefore there is no reason to conclude that this arrangement will not
support a speculum laterally in every position of its edge with the
same freedom from flexure as the best regulated hoop will in a single
position.


Subsidiary Apparatus. ?For the convenient removal and replace-
ment of the large speculum, the apparatus intended to be furnished
consists of two strong]carriages, each moving on rollers (or wheels) ;
one of these is provided with a fork raised or lowered by a strong
screw, it is to be applied underneath the large counterpoise, the de-
clination-axis being horizontal, and left there as a support in the ab-
sence of the speculum.. The other carriage is provided with a suitable
table, also raised and lowered by a screw, for supporting the speculum
in its box while being either removed from, or attached to the tube
of telescope ; also of apparatus for enabling the observer to reach the
eye-end conveniently in all required positions of the telescope.
I was surprised to learn that any difficulty had been felt with re-
spect to such, and that it could be supposed that a complicated or
expensive apparatus was required. The comparatively small distance
of the place for the eye from the centre of motion, and the convenient
height of this centre from the level platform surrounding the instru-
ment are such, that for the great mass of observations the eye of the
observer when applied to the eyepiece will range within from 3| to
7 feet from the ground level. For this range I propose to furnish,
first, a modification of the ordinary observing chair, and secondly, a
carriage on which the aforesaid chair may be placed (run up upon),
the carriage to be capable of being raised or lowered while the chair
arid observer are placed on it, and to allow of the observer reclining
on the chair or standing, at pleasure, and with safety. For the few
cases not met by the above, I think that a good step-ladder with a
safety rail (made on the spot) will be adequate.
Hand motions. ?The large diameter of the telescope would cause
inconvenience to the observer in reaching to the edge while the eye
is applied to the eyepiece, I therefore have planned arrangements
for bringing the hand-wheels for such motions somewhere between
the eyepiece of the telescope and that of the finder.
Estimate. ?The residents of Melbourne having some time since
desired to have an estimate including one large speculum (only), and
exclusive of polishing machinery, I have estimated for either such, or
with the additional large speculum (ad libitum). With respect to
the prices named, I desire to make a few observations. I should think
it imprudent on my part to name a sum which would only pay pro-
vided every thing went smoothly, and no such thing happened as a
failure in the casting, or breakage in the completion, of the specula;
and I should think it very indiscreet to name a sum which would
curb me in executing the entire in a manner creditable and satisfac-
tory to all concerned, including myself. The recent strides in the
manufacture of steel would induce me to see how far this substance
might be advantageously substituted (of course not without adding
to the expense) in several parts where I had originally intended to use
either cast or wrought iron?for example, the declination-axis, and
the telescope-tube. Another observation I desire to make is, that
without wishing in any way to detract from the merits and excellence
of the workmanship of Mr. LasselTs large equatoreal, of which in-
deed I have only seen a lithographic drawing, and therefore could not

pretend to form an opinion?l say without expressing any opinion
as to the workmanship, I think that any one at all conversant in such
matters may see that the two constructions (viz. his and mine) are so
entirely different in character that it would be quite impossible to
judge of what one could be made for by knowing what the other cost.
In his instrument the steadiness, whatever it may be, is attained by
what I would call the brute force of tons of metal; in the other no
expense is spared to keep down the weight and friction to the lowest.
If my construction have (as I fully expect) decidedly greater steadiness,
and it is moved with one-thirtieth of the force required to move
the other, my labour in contrivance has not been in vain should it be
put into use.
My original estimate was �4500. There are some things now
added, and my present estimate will be �3BOO for one speqjilum only
and no polishing machinery, or �4600 for everything as before with
the present additions. The difference between these two sums, or
�BOO, would scarcely more than cover the actual cost of the items
to be furnished for it; but it is not unlikely that in any case I should
find it desirable to cast a second large speculum, and I place the ad-
vantage of taking the second speculum with the customer.
Faithfully yours,
Thomas Grubb.

XIY. The Earl of Rosse to General Sabine .
The Castle, Parsonstown,
Dec. 18, 1862.
Dear Sabine,
I return the copy of Herschel?s letter of the 10th, and have no
hesitation in saying that I fully concur in his six propositions. In
addition I should say that whatever form of mounting may be
adopted, provided the instrument is accompanied by some one
thoroughly competent to repolish the specula, the results will be
important. Each form of mounting has its own peculiar advantages
and disadvantages ; and the choice may be made, without prejudice,
to rest very much on financial considerations. Sir John Herschel
leans to the altazimuth mounting ; and no one knows better what can
be done with it, even in its simple form without counterpoises, than
he does. When thoroughly counterpoised, the whole stand moves in
azimuth with the hand, and the telescope can be pointed without
effort. A rack which gives a slow motion makes the micrometer
sufficiently convenient for observations close to the meridian.
Sir John Herschel suggests more framework and more wheels than
we employ; to that I see no objection: the additional cost would be
nothing; and as to the additional weight, the counterpoise would
sustain it at the expense of a little more central friction.
Sir John Herschel mentions Mr. Rammage?s stand: I have seen it,
and a very rickety affair it was. The wheels were much too close
together, consequently it had but a very small base to stand upon.
The timber was slight, badly put together, and there were no iron
knees, or iron braces.
In the case of a counterpoised stand like that of my 3-foot tele-
scope, the principal strain is from the upward thrust of the counter-
poise lever, which acts upon a ring round the central point, and so
raises the whole stand, leaving no more weight upon the wheels than
is necessary to keep all steady.
The lateral stays, to which Sir John Herschel alludes, contribute to


resist that thrust, and are not necessary to resist lateral strain, which
seems amply provided against by the distribution of the four wheels
upon the circular rail, the wide stretch of the ladders at the base, the
breadth of the hack trussing, the large scantling of the timber, and
the iron knees and straps. No gale has ever brought out any
symptoms of weakness; and even when lifted bodily off the rail by
the counterpoise-lever, there is no perceptible change of form. As
to Mr. LasselTs equatorial mounting, I concur in Sir John HerscheTs
mechanical objections to it; still, considering Mr. LasselTs long expe-
rience, and the positive way in which he speaks as to its efficiency,
I cannot doubt but that with its faults, whatever they may be, it
would still do its work in a satisfactory manner.
It only remains to consider the German mounting: that, I confess, is
my favourite; and were it my own case to be just commencing work in
the Southern Hemisphere, I should adopt it, if financial considerations
did not interfere. The fittings, however, should be for the Newtonian
as well as the Cassegrain, lest the Cassegrain should not define per-
fectly. Sir John Herschel objects to the labour of observing with a
Cassegrain, but Struve, Bond, in fact every one who employs a refractor
has the same labour; and lam not sure whether moving up and
down ladders with all the clothing necessary for a night?s work is
not more laborious. In choosing between the altazimuth and the
equatorial, we must recollect that Sir John Herschel has had a life?s
experience with the altazimuth, and that no observer is likely to be
able to use it as he did for a very long time.
With the equatorial the work is far easier; it will be done much
quicker, and probably much better.
Believe me to be,
Faithfully yours,
General Sabine. Rosse.
In consequence of Mr. De la Rue?s absence from England, the
President and Officers were obliged to prepare the draft of their re-
port to the Duke of Newcastle without having the advantage of
consulting him.
XY. Extract from the Minutes of the Council of the Royal Society,
December 18, 1862.
The President and Officers submitted the following Draft of a
Report to be transmitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in
compliance with His Grace?s request conveyed in the Letter of Mr.
Elliot, dated 10th October 1862.
� Deport of the President and Council of the Royal Society respecting
the proposal of erecting in Melbourne a Telescope of greater optical
power than any previously used in the Southern Hemisphere.
? 1 The President and Council learn with pleasure that the Board
of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory have proposed resolutions,
indicating their sense of the importance of erecting at Melbourne an


equatorially mounted Telescope of great optical power, and that the
proposal is favourably regarded by Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of
Victoria, and by His Grace the Secretary for the Colonies. In respect
to the importance which the President and Council attach to such
an undertaking, they need do no more than refer to the fact that in
the year 1850 the Royal Society and the British Association for the
Advancement of Science presented a joint memorial to Her Majesty?s
Government, in which they urged the establishment of such a tele-
scope at some suitable place in the Southern Hemisphere. The
scientific objects to be attained thereby are so clearly stated in that
Memorial, of which a copy is enclosed, and in the Resolutions of the
Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory, in July 1862, that
the President and Council feel it unnecessary to do more than refer
to these documents.
? 2, Since the presentation of the Memorial of 1850 an equato-
rially mounted telescope of greater optical power than that then
recommended has actually been constructed by Mr. Lassell, at his
own expense, in England, and erected in Malta, where he is now
occupied in making observations with it: we have now therefore
in addition to our previous knowledge the benefit of his experience.
In referring to Mr. LasselTs Telescope, the President and Council
wish it, however, to be understood that they do not conceive that it
should necessarily be copied in all respects; and that for the present
they think it best to leave the details of construction in many respects
open to further consideration.
"3. "When the subject was previously under consideration, letters
were written to some of the most eminent practical astronomers of
Great Britain and Ireland, requesting them to state their opinions as
to the best mode of construction; and a correspondence ensued, of
which a printed copy is sent herewith. After receiving the com-
munication from the Colonial Office of the 10th of last October, the
President wrote to the four gentlemen who were appointed as a
Committee on the former occasion to superintend the construction
of the instrument (in case the Government should accede to the
request), and also to Sir John Herschel, enclosing a copy of the
former correspondence, and asking whether their views had in any
way changed in the interval. The answers received from each have
been circulated among the others, as was done on the former occasion,
and have in most cases elicited additional remarks.
?4. Availing themselves of the information thus so kindly afforded
them, the President and Council have to recommend as follows
regarding the construction of the instrument contemplated.
? (a) That the telescope be a reflector, with an aperture of not less
than four feet. This is essential, as no refractor would have the
power required.
? (b) That the large mirror be of speculum-metal. Such mirrors
can be constructed with certainty of success, and at a cost which can
be foretold; whereas the recently introduced plan of glass silvered
by a chemical process has not yet been sufficiently tried on so large
a scale as that contemplated.


? (b) That the tube be constructed of open work, and of metal.
Lord Rosso has recently changed the tube of his three-foot altazimuth
from a close to an open or skeleton one, and it is understood that he
intends doing the same with his great telescope. Mr. LasselTs tube
is also an open one, which his experience leads him decidedly to
prefer.
? (d) The telescope should be furnished with a clock-movement
in right ascension.
? (e) Apparatus for repolishing the speculum should be provided.
?(/) With respect to the form of reflector to be adopted, some
difference of opinion exists, as the Newtonian and Cassegrainian
have each some advantages not possessed by the other. On this
point further correspondence appears desirable; but as the main
features of the scheme are the same in both cases, there does not
appear to be any occasion to wait till this point shall have been
finally decided.
? 5. With respect to the cost, something must depend on the soli-
dity of the construction and the perfection of the workmanship; but
if it be assumed that the workmanship shall be of the best descrip-
tion, and the instrument furnished, as seems desirable, with polishing
apparatus, and a second speculum for using while the other is being
polished, it is probable that the cost will not fall much short of
�5OOO.
?6. It is estimated that the construction of the instrument will
occupy about eighteen months.
? 7. It seems highly desirable that the future Observer should
come to England during a part at least of the time occupied in the
construction of the instrument, in order that he may become
thoroughly acquainted with all its details, and especially with the
mode of repolishing; and also that he may personally acquaint himself
with the working arrangements followed at the Observatories of the
Earl of Rosse and Mr. Lassell, who have expressed their willingness
to afford him every facility.?
Resolved,- ?That the Draft now read be adopted as the Report of
the President and Council, and that the President be requested
to transmit the same to the Duke of Newcastle.
Mr. De la Rue having returned to England was immediately
made acquainted with the previous correspondence.
XVI. Warren De la Rue, Esq., to General Sabine.
The Observatory, Cranford, Middlesex, W.
February 16, 1863.
Mv dear General Sabine,
I have read the correspondence in respect of the proposed Southern
telescope with considerable interest, and I return it to you under a
separate cover.


I think that to adopt the altazimuth mounting in the present
state of engineering science would be an inexcusable retrograde step.
As regards the two forms of equatorial mounting submitted for con-
sideration, namely, Mr. Lassell?s and Mr. Grubb?s, each presents
certain peculiar advantages, and counterbalancing disadvantages. It
is not a necessary consequence of Mr. Lassell?s plan that the telescope
cannot be placed within 30� of the pole, but must arise from faults
of construction in the Malta equatoreal, for his two-foot telescope
can be placed in a line with the polar axis. Moreover, a modification
of the observing-tower would render it available for any possible
position of the telescope. The strengthening cross-piece (the re-
moveable piece) between the uprights on the polar axis would not
have been necessary had the mounting been made sufficiently strong.
Mr. Lassell does not go in for great niceties of fitting, hence the
remarks in his communication about its forming no part of his plan
to determine absolute places: I may here add that the necessary
play in the supports of the great mirror allows of a minute difference
of tilting, which is greater in effect than any errors dependent upon
flexure, or from alterations in the position of the polar axis.
I think that it is absolutely essential that a system of supports
similar in effect to that suggested by Mr. Lassell should be provided;
the swinging ring does not prevent the distortion arising from the
mirror bending by its own weight, when in any other position than
pointed to the zenith. In order that the counterbalancing levers
should act properly, the telescope must rotate in a cradle, so that
the same radius may always be in a vertical plane. I have had no
experience with the Cassegrainian form of telescope, but can imagine
that this form would possibly afford means of correcting the aberra-
tions of the large mirror by changes of curvature in the small mirror,
but there would I conceive be a loss of light as compared with the
Newtonian. On the other hand, the observer would be more con-
veniently placed for regulating the movements of the telescope and for
directing it, although during the actual time of observing he would be
placed at a disadvantage in comparison with the user of a Newtonian,
which is undoubtedly the most pleasant to work with, from the
perfect ease of the observer, who may sit down in a chair, looking
straight before him, or at any convenient angle downwards, and is
thus enabled to draw in the greatest comfort.
Dr. Robinson is in error in supposing that the Cassegrain tele-
scope offers advantages for photography, the truth being that the
second reflecting surface must be done away with altogether, and the
sensitive plate placed directly in the principal focus of the great
mirror. Lessening the time of exposure is of the greatest moment,
and everything that conduces to that end is of the utmost import-
ance. It is very easy to enlarge the image afterwards: latterly I
have enlarged my lunar photographs from 1 inch (the size of the
original negatives) to 38 inches.
A provision must be made for the removal from time to time of
the second or small mirror, if it is contemplated to use the telescope
for photography.


Moreover the driving clock will require especial attention: it
must go smoothly, and must be capable of rapid adjustment to lunar,
planetary, and sidereal time.
Mr, Grubb?s photograph of a plan for mounting a 4-foot tele-
scope evinces, as was to be expected from such a man, considerable
originality and engineering ability, and I do not think that the
Royal Society could do better than recommend that he be instructed
to carry out the work. His estimate is moderate, and I should say
that �5OOO is a small sum for such an instrument as he would turn
out of hand.
I may here mention that the only disadvantage of his form of
mounting is the impossibility of moving the telescope all round the
polar-axis, as the supports of the axis would stop it; this is very
troublesome sometimes. In my own plan of mounting on the German
system this is obviated.
As regards the durability of metallic mirrors, and the desirability
of providing polishing machinery to be sent out to Melbourne, I have
a word to say. My mirror A has been hard at work for nine years,
and has been exposed to the destructive vapours of photographic
chemicals for five years and a half, and is as good as ever it was.
My diagonal mirror has been at work for fourteen years, and, although
I have three others in reserve, I do not consider it necessary to
replace it. I have taken the precaution to put boxes containing lime
in my tube, and these, by preventing the deposition of moisture, have
preserved my mirrors. My advice would be, let the observer use
the telescope, and not trouble himself about acquiring the art of
figuring mirrors?l defy him to acquire the art in less than from
four to five years. The possession of a polishing machine will be at
first of about the same advantage as the possession of a complicated
turning lathe would be to a gentleman desiring to become an amateur
turner. Each must buy his experience by trial and failure. The
finest figure may be spoiled in half an hour, and without the neces-
sary knowledge will not be readily regained. Even for the most
experienced the difficulties of producing critically fine figures are
very great.
_ mm �? ? ? . ? m . m ? ?
I have had a little experience with a silvered glass mirror of small
size by Steinheil. It was placed in my observatory, and care
taken of it, but in less than two years the silvering underwent a
molecular change, and broke up into minute scales. I think that
glass mirrors should only be used by persons capable of resilvering
them; at all events until their very general employment brings about
the establishment of commercial facilities for this being readily
accomplished.
I have written these remarks hurriedly, but I shall be much pleased
to afford any other information which you may think I can furnish
from my general experience in making and using reflecting telescopes.
I am, yours very sincerely,
General Sabine. Waeeen He la Rue.


XYII. Sir J. F. W. Herschel to General Sabine,
Collingwood, February 22, 18G3.
Mx dear General Sabine,
1 return you Mr, De la Rue?s letter, which I have read with
much attention.
If the equatorial form of mounting can really be rendered efficient
so as to carry the telescope up to and beyond the pole and reach
every point of the visible hemisphere with safety and comfort, as
Mr. De la Rue thinks, there is no more to be said, I have still
some misgivings, but I have no experience of such heavy mountings,
and in such matters experience is everything.
Mr, De la Rue?s remark as to the play in the support of the great
mirror, is of very great importance. I see no possibility of avoiding
Such play. The remedy is clear, and, as I conceive, imperatively ne-
cessary to be applied, viz. the use of a fiducial collimator, as used
by myself, and described in Phil. Trans. 1833, p. 488, and in my
4 Cape Observations,? Introduction, p. xiv. I wonder I did not think
of insisting on this point in my previous letters on this subject. Of
course the mirror must be capable of adjustment to the collimator by
screws moveable at any moment by the observer at the eyepiece.
I do not quite understand Mr. De la Rue?s remark on the system
of supports for the mirror. It seems to me that without a swinging
ring no system of back support can be effectual. With it a me-
chanism would certainly, as he states, be required to keep the point
of its suspension in a vertical plane.
It is very comfortable and reassuring to have both Mr. Lassell?s
and Mr. De la Rue?s testimony as to the permanence of polish of
their specula. This being the case, the observations of the latter
on the non-necessity (and indeed positive disadvantage) of supply-
ing polishing machinery appear to me worthy of all consideration.
I quite agree with Mr. De la Rue in deprecating the idea of
adopting silvered glass for the great mirror. It would be a most
hazardous experiment.
I remain,
My dear General,
Yours very truly,
General Saline. J. F. W. Herschel.

Dear Sabine,
I enclose De la Rue?s and Herschel?s letters, which I have read
with much interest. As to De la Rue?s, I perfectly coincide with
him in everything contained in the early part of his letter. Our 6-foot
mirror certainly tilts a little, which would vitiate all absolute de-
termination of polar distances without the aid of Herschel?s colli-


mating arrangement. The tilting affects also Right Ascensions;
but in a very slight degree, for which the collimator is also the remedy,
differential observations of course affording the ultimate check.
We have never made any effort to annihilate tilting; Mr. Grubb?s
arrangement of the supporting apparatus seems much better than
ours with the view to that object. Some inconvenience may per-i
haps be felt from sudden changes in the position of Mr. LasselTs
polar axis. We have never succeeded in detecting strain referable
to edge-pressure. As to Mr. De la Rue?s remarks on the durability
of mirrors, no doubt he is correct if the mirrors are always dry, so
long as they can be kept dry they are practically everlasting. My
experience, however, is, that in the hands of assistants they are
frequently wet, and I am not sure whether with the utmost care I
could take, unless I were to resort to some artificial means of keep-
ing their temperature above that of the air, I could secure them
from the deposition of dew arising from sudden changes in the con-
dition of the atmosphere while they were unsecured.
To employ quicklime in a lattice tube would be out of the ques-
tion, and in a close tube I have never thought the action would be
rapid enough to be effectual. From the ascending and descending
currents in a close tube I have always thought that the whole air
would be so often changed that quicklime would be of no use.
When the speculum is covered quicklime is effectual; and telescopes
under a dome are seldom dewed. My remarks apply to this climate;
how it might be in Australia I cannot tell, but so long as the spe-
culum preserves a fair polish it would be better not to meddle with
it; and while I recommend a polishing-machine to be sent out, I
should be very sorry to encourage its being employed unless when
absolutely necessary. I should advise also that a small polishing-
machine should be sent with two 10-inch mirrors for the astro-
nomer to practise upon. This would be a trifle; though without
some instruction in addition to that to be found in books, it might
be very uphill work to acquire the necessary tact to produce a fine
speculum; still I think machinery affords such facilities that with
a little instruction any educated man, with an aptitude for mecha-
nical pursuits, would soon acquire the knack so far as to succeed
moderately.
Believe me to be,
Truly yours,
General Sabine. Rosse.
XIX. Warren De la Rue, Esq., to General Sabine.
The Observatory, Cranford, Middlesex,
April 7, 1863.
My deap. General Sabine,
I return you Lord Rosse?s letter, which I have read with great
interest, I agree with Lord Rosse that the collimation-apparatus
of Herschel would afford the means of obtaining reliable determi-


nations of position by tbe differential method. I cannot but think
that Mr. LasselTs method of obviating the distortion of the large
mirror by edge-pressure is of great value; for even in the case of
my own 13-inch I have been able to detect a very slight effect in
the image when examined by moving the eyepiece in and out of
focus when the telescope was placed at different elevations. The
mirror is suspended in a swinging hoop, and each point of support
(in the system of triangles) has a ball-and-socket joint, so that I am
sure there is no ? stickage,? but nevertheless there is a slight dis-
tortion of the image. The mirror is nearly 1| inch thick.
I have never worked with a lattice tube, but nevertheless my
mirror has become occasionally covered with moisture, and I have
always managed to get it dry in about half an hour by placing the
lime-boxes in the tube and covering up the end. Most probably
with the lattice tube the mirror will become very frequently be-
dewed, and the remedy is not of easy application in such large
telescopes as that under contemplation; yet I think that it would
be found to be advantageous to provide means for covering the
mirror and making a short piece of the tube closed to contain a
lime-box, say about 18 inches of the tube, which would be amply
sufficient to contain a deep narrow lime-box such as I use. It
consists of an outer vessel, which contains an inner perforated vessel
holding the lime; and consequently a very large drying-surface is
presented by the arrangement.
I do not suppose that any inconvenience can result in sending a
polishing-machine with the instrument; but I should certainly feel
inclined to discourage its employment on the mirror supplied to the
telescope until the operator had fully mastered the art of figuring
mirrors by experience on a second mirror, which he ought to be able
to make equal to the original mirror before he attempts to touch
the latter.
Again, let me assure you that I am persuaded that the making of
the telescope could not be entrusted to a better man than Mr.
Grubb, and that no one is better qualified than Lord Eosse to ad-
vise as? to its construction. The foregoing remarks are merely put
forth as suggestions, to be considered with others which will neces-
sarily present themselves to those immediately concerned in the
planning out of the telescope which is soon, I hope, to prove
creditable to the science of England,
I am,
Yours very sincerely,
General Sabine . Warren De la Etje.
XX. The Rev. T. R. Robinson to Major-General Sabine, Pres.R.S.
Observatory, Armagh, April 13, 1863.
Mt dear Friend,
There are some points in Mr, De la Eue?s two last letters on which
I wish to make a few remarks, especially as to his opinion that it is
essential to use Mr. Lassell?s levers with the great speculum.


If it were impossible to obtain good definition with the hoop sup-
port, the use of them would be a matter of necessity, notwithstanding
their complexity, bulk, weight, and the inconvenience (if applied as
by Mr. Lassell) of their requiring the ponderous telescope to be
turned in its cradle when an observation is made off the meridian.
But my own experience, that of Mr. Grubb, of Lord Bosse, of Sir
John Herschel, of Mr. De la Rue himself, and even of Mr. Lassell
(before he contrived this support) prove that exceeding sharpness,
capable of separating the very closest double stars that have been ob-
served, has been obtained without them. Therefore even were the
lever arrangement absolutely perfect, the Correction of the very
slight residual defect which can exist with the hoop support is no
equivalent for the evils which I have mentioned as belonging to
them. But in fact they are liable to grave objections, greater far
than any which apply to the other. They must be very liable to
tremors from any vibration of the ground or agitation of the tele-
scope ; and there is a still stronger mechanical objection, that the
resultant of the mirror?s weight which is parallel to its plane passes
through its centre of gravity; while the plane of the opposing action
of the levers, though parallel to the former, is distant from it by half
the mirror?s thickness + the distance of the lever?s ends from the back.
This must produce a transverse strain of a kind most likely to distort
the mirror; and both Lord llosse and Mr, Lassell have shown that
friction on the back (which acts in this very way) does act inju-
riously.
Secondly, I do not think there can be any loss of light in the
Cassegrain as compared to the Newtonian. If the small mirrors are
of metal in both, then, as MacCullagh, Jamin and others have shown,
the reflexion at perpendicular incidence is greater than at 45�; if
the Newtonian have a prism, one of the requisite size will absorb
more light than is lost in the other telescope if (as is proposed) its
small mirror be a silvered achromatic which reflects 0-8 of the in-
cident light.
Thirdly, I suppose Mr. De la Rue?s idea of the necessity of lessen-
ing as much as possible the time of exposure in Celestial Photo-
graphy, arises from the difficulty of making the driving-clock act
regularly, and still more from the motion of the moon and planets in
declination. The last suggests the expediency of having a clock ap-
plied to the declination movement: as to the other, the Right As-
cension Clock ought (if it have a proper regulator) to keep a star
bisected for several minutes.
With my very limited practice of Photography, it would be rash to
controvert the opinion of so world-famed a master of that art; but
I may mention why I had the notion that there would be some ad-
vantage in having the original picture as large as possible. I think
that there must be a limit as to the least magnitude which can be
impressed on even the most sensitive collodion?that, for instance, if
an apparatus magnifying about 20 times (as is the case with a
mirror of 10-feet focus when taking a lunar picture) were used to
photograph a set of Nobert?s Test-lines, very few of the series would


be revealed. The molecules of the sensitive material have a certain
size, below which photography cannot go. Subsequent enlargement
of such a picture cannot develope what does not exist in it. Besides,
a copy which is enlarged by lenses cannot be so sharp as one by
metallic reflexion. No combination can be so achromatized that a
large portion of the most refrangible rays shall not be aberrant; and
though the most photographic of these do not go far beyond the line
G, yet Dr, A. Miller?s spectra show that others to a great distance
beyond H have enough of energy to blur an outline. Now as the
proposed Cassegrain would give an image equivalent to a focus of 156
feet (for the moon 17| inches diameter), and as the light of a 4-foot
mirror will probably suffice for this, I hope it will be admitted that
my error is not without excuse.
Fourthly, I still hold, after considering all that has been said, that
a polishing-apparatus is necessary. The first of the two specula
would of course be used until it becomes so tarnished as to impair
seriously its efficiency. Then it should be changed for the second
mirror, and then experiments should be made on repolishing it. As by
a recent contrivance of Lord llosse even a 6-foot can be tested while
on the polishing-machine, these experiments would not interfere
with the continuous use of the telescope; and lam confident that
long before the second one became unserviceable the first would be
again fit for work. But I certainly wish that there should be at-
tached to the instrument an assistant who, besides being able to
observe, should be already trained to the work of polishing.
I hope we shall soon hear from Melbourne, and hear good tidings ;
for, as Sir John Herschel has well remarked, the days that pass be-
fore this survey of the Southern Heaven begins are each an irre-
trievable loss to Astronomy.
Sincerely yours,

President of the Royal Society.
XXI. Sir J. F. W. Herschel to General Sabine.
Collingwood, April 24, 1863.
My dear General Sabine,
Lord Eosse?s letter of March 13, and Mr. De la Eue?s of April 7,
are herewith returned.
I am glad to see that it appears agreed, Ist, that the collimator
shall be adopted ; 2nd, that a lattice tube shall be employed.
I confess I had been astonished to hear that the metal now in
use absolutely resisted tarnish. It norv appears, however, that
when dewed it suffers. And that it will be dewed whenever during
its exposure a change of temperature from cold to warm, accom-
panied with a degree of moisture approaching the dew-point, hap-
pens is certain, whether the tube be latticed or not. Therefore I
see no help but to send out a polishing apparatus. But then this
entails as a necessity that the observer must be a man of skill and


energy, giving his whole heart, soul, time, and thought to the one great
work of using and keeping in order this magnificent instrument,
2ndly. That he must learn to polish, and must on no account
meddle with the great speculum till he has perfectly familiarized
himself with the operation of polishing and figuring specula by
practice on smaller ones; and for this I can hardly believe that a
10-inch size will he large enough. 3rdly. That the great mirror
should not be opened, even for inspection (further than to be satis-
fied that it arrives unbroken), till the whole instrument is erected and
quite ready for use, and that the greatest diligence should be then
employed to secure a great harvest of observations while the
surface is yet perfect, as it is more than probable that the first
attempt (and many more) to renew it will prove failures. And this
is all that occurs to me on the subject of these two letters.
I remain,
Yours very truly,
J. E. W. Heeschel,
XXII. Mr. Lassell to General Saline.
London, July 22, 1863.
Deak General Sabine,
On the occasion of my temporary visit to England I have had the
opportunity of looking into some of the correspondence respecting
the proposed 4-foot telescope for Melbourne, and, in consequence, I
should be glad to be allowed to state that I do not intend to con-
tinue my observations with the telescope of this size now erected in
Malta, and described in this correspondeuce, beyond the period of
twelve, or at most eighteen months from the present time, and that,
if this eqnatoreal should meet the requirements of the Melbourne
Committee, I shall then be glad to place it at their disposal.
I remain,
My dear Sir,
Yery truly yours,
General Sabine, It.A. William Lassell.
XXIII. Warren Be la Rue, Esq., to General Sabine.
(Extract.)
My dear General Sabine, August 8,1863.
While admitting the correctness of Dr. Robinson?s opinion, ? that
there must be a limit as to the least magnitude which can be im-
pressed on even the most sensitive collodion,? lam able to say that
the minuteness of details in astronomical photographs made with a
13-inch reflector is not limited by this cause. In a 4-foot reflector
the image would be nearly four times as large, and the structure of
the collodion would consequently interfere in a proportionately less

degree with the perfection of the image; I therefore urge on the at-
tention of the Committee' the advisability of making arrangements
for the removal of the second mirror, and of placing the photographic
apparatus in the focus of the great mirror.
My driving-clock will keep the image of a star on the wire of a
micrometer for several minutes, so that the difficulty in photographing
celestial objects does not result, in my case, from imperfections in the
driving-clock ; it arises solely from atmospheric disturbances. I am
persuaded that the proper direction to he pursued in developing
astronomical photography will he to increase the aperture of the in-
strument in relation to its focal length, and to diminish the term of
exposure as much as possible by also improving the chemical part of
the process.
I am, yours very sincerely,
Warren De la Eue
General Sabine.
