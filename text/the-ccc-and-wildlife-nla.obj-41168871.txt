coordinated through the office of Robert Fechner as the Director. These Depart-
ments and their functions are:
The Department of Labor is charged with the selection of junior enrollees (veterans
are selected by the Veterans Administration). The War Department is primarily
charged with camp organization and administration. The Departments of the
Interior and of Agriculture are primarily charged with the technical supervision of
field work projects.

The CCC and Wildlife
THE WILDLIFE THAT WAS AMERICA
ONCE, upon this continent, flights of
pigeons ?darkened the sun for hours on
end? by their vast numbers, so that chickens
went to roost at midday. Herds of buffalo a
mile square quickened western plains to an
undulant mat of dark brown wool. Ducks
and geese V?ed north and south with the seasons,
a million in a skein. The waters teemed; to
catch enough fish one had only to drop his
hook or net, again and again.
From Aleutians to Everglades, subarctic to
subtropic; between Rockies and Alleghenies;
in deserts, fertile plains, and rill-threaded
valleys ?from heights of almost 4 miles to
depths nearly a block below sea-level and, in
between, infinite gradations of climate and
temperature ?America has been favored with
myriad types of wildlife ?lumbering, half-ton Kodiak bears from Alaskan islands
to ounce-sized shrews on a Potomac island; California condors, winged monsters
10 feet from tip to tip feathers; and those enameled miniatures, the humming-
birds. This was America ?100 years ago.
That one must never kill excessively was an Iroquois commandment. Unfortu-
nately, Moses omitted it from the white man?s decalogue. Under Indian occupa-
tion nomadry prevailed; a village was here today, gone tomorrow. No area was
?worked out? to sterility. Abandoned, it sprang back to floral and faunal
normalcy. With the occupation of the land by white settlers, this wildlife began
to diminish, imperceptibly at first, but definitely, nevertheless. Whole sections,
now States, were expropriated. Buffalo, deer, elk, bears, either were killed off or
forced to seek less trodden ways. Trading companies stripped fortunes from
bison furs and the small game abounding. They ?left to posterity scarcely
more than scattered remnants of what had been a tremendous resource.? There
were 75,000,000 buffalo; even yet, after the years of comparative safety that
have followed an awakening to the prospect of extermination, their herds
in the United States have been built up to less than five thousand.

Cities and towns came nearer the game fields, and railways fingered out to them.
Nine months of each year, from the Civil War to the middle of the eighties,
hunters shot and snared without restraint millions of passenger pigeons, prairie
chickens, grouse, ducks, geese, upland plover, snipe, woodcock, quail. The eastern
markets literally devoured whole species. Other game species suffered set-backs
from which they have not yet recovered.
LAWS CAME SLOWLY
In 1870, for example, 36 States afforded waterfowl no legal protection whatever.
In 1900 only nine prohibited all spring shooting. By 1910, similar laws had been
enacted in five more. Under State protection, the rule was ?open season whenever
migratory birds were present; a closed, when they had departed.?
A bill to put the matter into national law, introduced in 1904, bore fruit 9
years later. On March 4, 1913, Congress passed a migratory-bird law giving the
Department of Agriculture authority to adopt regulations fixing closed seasons.
By 1918, under an international treaty, Congress provided the protective law
that is still in force for birds that migrate between this country and Canada.
Nineteen years later the agreement included Mexico,
In 1872 came the first sign of a national attempt to protect wildlife by providing
sanctuary areas. Yellowstone became a national park with a secondary pur-
pose ?to afford refuge for birds and game. In March 1903, the first Federal
refuge for the explicit purpose of protecting birds was created. The story of the
three decades between then and 1933 runs uphill and down, now hot, now cold-
Briefly, however, in spite of the 99 bird refuges covering over 1,600,000 acres,
and the 6 going big-game refuges, the decline in waterfowl numbers ?continued
to be incredibly rapid.? By 1933 the big-game situation was bad enough but
could have been worse; the wildfowl situation was desperate.
ELK ROAMED THE WEST


FLOOD, DROUGHT, DITCH,
AND DRAIN
Following the Swamp Land Act
of 1850, ditch and drain was a
national shibboleth for more than
half a century: 77,000,000 acres of
water and marsh disappeared in the
search for more and richer arable
farm land. Too often, the farmer
found revealed, for his pains,
barren or alkaline wasteland
unfit for crops, birds, beast, or
man.
In the 1930?s drought began to
dry the land up, the topsoil
cracked ?hot winds whirled whole
square miles of it up In one State
and dropped it on another, burying
homes, smothering stock and crops.
CANADA GEESE RESTING. UTAH
Tremendous areas of what had been important wildfowl nesting grounds in the
North, vast areas along the age-old flyways, wintering resorts in the South,
became biological deserts.
One writer records: ?In Oregon, previous to the drainage of its Lake Malheur
and Klamath Basin, great numbers of waterfowl were hatched each year; but
its two great duck and goose hatcheries were now drained dry as a bone. In
the Dakotas, for lack of water, residents were shooting domestic livestock.
Waterfowl mortality, in parts of the central North American breeding areas
reached a peak never before known. Dried ?pot holes? and small lakes were
littered with the putrefying bodies of young ducks. Some died in their nestsj
others perished in traveling overland with the adult birds in search of food
and water. Those that survived were forced to abandon large areas that
formerly had offered haven. Going southward the perishing birds found
thousands of ponds and lakes dried up where once they had been able to rest
and feed.?
Some still believed, because o. the great concentration of birds on the few areas
remaining habitable, that there was no valid decline in their population, that
perhaps the birds were simply altering their hereditary flyways. Only slowly the
one-time ?alarmists? became a majority. There developed a concerted demand
for Federal action.


THE PROPHET IS HEARD
The first week in 1934 witnessed the creation of the President?s Committee on
Wildlife Restoration. From a vast amount of material, this Committee sifted
facts bearing upon the status of mammals, migratory waterfowl, upland game,
song, and other Insectivorous birds.
The Committee found ?the destruction of our once-abundant wildlife resources
through waste and neglect one of the sorriest chapters in our national history.?
The decline in wildlife resources was attributed to ?the destruction and neglect of
vast natural breeding and nesting areas by drainage and the encroachment of
agriculture.? Recommendations were blunt: $2.5,000,000 must be earmarked to
acquire submarginal lands, $25,000,000 more must be spent to develop and restore
these acquired lands. The Committee?s report had wide circulation. Wildlife con-
servationists became ?restoration-conscious? ?an idea at which at least one Fed-
eral bureau, the Biological Survey, had been hammering for almost two decades.
Irony and luck are often blood brothers. They were in 1933-34. Drainage,
overgrazing; flood, erosion; drought, depression; strange stablemates these, but
they pulled American wildlife out of a deep, dry hole.
The United States was in a period of national economic adversity, brought
about in no small part by the same land-use practices that were driving many

forms of wildlife perilously close to extinction; and it was largely owing to the
Nation?s efforts to extend relief for man and agriculture in distress that the
Biological Survey was able to put wildlife restoration under the banner of sub-
marginal land retirement and drought relief, and thus obtain for wildlife a small
portion of the Federal moneys that were being spent to alleviate human distress.
In many instances the very drought-stricken and depleted lands now no longer
arable were once among the finest waterfowl-producing areas in the country.
Ducks came into better fortune. As far as habitat insurance is concerned, they
got their first big break on a national scale. The Biological Survey got $14,500,000
of emergency funds for 1934-35, to develop its long-needed refuge program.
The wildlife restoration program upon which the Bureau of Biological Survey
engaged had for its immediate objective the salvage of breeding stocks, scattered
remnants of the great resource of earlier days, and the rehabilitation and restora-
tion of available lands that are suitable for the production of wildlife and that are
absolutely essential to its maintenance. The character of these lands is such
that their withdrawal for the purpose is not merely desirable from the standpoint
of preserving the wildlife, but it is highly essential to the economic and social
welfare of the Nation. These are the lands generally classified as submarginal;
areas that, under cultivation, have never produced crops to compare in value
with the fish, game, furbearers, song and insectivorous birds that inhabited them
before they were wholly or partially destroyed by rashly attempted agricultural
operations or by drainage projects. These are some of the lands whereon the
Nation must erect the green, living, organic fortifications to protect the fertile
areas against soil erosion and damage by drought and flood.

THE CCC IS BORN
By virtue of ?Public, No. 5, Seventy-third Congress, 5.598, an act * * * to
provide for the restoration ol the country?s depleted natural resources,? among
other ?useful work,? through the agency of those unemployed, regardless of
?race, color, or creed,? approved March 31, 1933, the Civilian Conservation
Corps was born.
By the end of its first 6 months, 250,000 young men in 1,520 camps were at work
on conservation projects. By the fall of 1935, there were 2,427 camps or work
groups employing over 500,000 men.
Camps are now located in every State, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii,
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. They are working on National, State, and
private forest lands, agricultural lands, Federal refuges, National and State parks,
public domain, military, naval, and Indian reservations, and other approved areas.
Wildlife has benefited. Under a dozen or more Federal land-administering
agencies, CCC camps have carried on activities either directly or indirectly
concerned with wildlife.
These camps build fish-rearing ponds and wildlife shelters, seed and plant food
and cover, develop wells, springs, lakes, ponds, and streams, feed wildlife, and
carry on a miscellany of other wildlife activities. The CCC has, for example,
cooperated in a wholesale way with the United States Bureau of Fisheries in
developing, among others, the York Pond fish hatchery, in the White Mountain
National Forest, New Hampshire, which will have an annual capacity of nearly
20,000,000 eggs and be the Bureau?s chief source for brook-trout eggs. Forest

fire prevention on the national forests and parks has been greatly advanced by
protective facilities built and manned by CCC enrollees. Not even unregulated
hunting can be more devastating to wildlife than great forest fires. They create
frightful and immediate destruction; they also disturb natural balances so as to
prevent a replacement or increase in wildlife for many years to come. From
April 1933 through March 1938, CCC enrollees had devoted more than 4,000,000
man-days to fighting forest fires, had reforested over 1,300,000 barren acres.
Water-control structures, from large impoundments to ditches, have been con-
structed and maintained. Some have been specifically designed to aid wildlife;
many have been simply an incidental aid. The work has included clearing ponds
and channels and building check dams and dikes to stabilize water-levels and to
store water. Stabilizing the level of shallow, fresh-water areas fosters the growth
of aquatic and other vegetation that will furnish food for birds; storage water is
drawn upon to maintain a continuous supply of water in the marsh areas that
otherwise would be dry in summer, especially in the important waterfowl nesting
regions of the Northwest.
Where food plants for birds were lacking, the CCC has planted them. They
have collected seeds and tubers where plants were abundant and stored them for
future planting. Their plantings have also included shrubs and trees and field
crops to be left for waterfowl and upland game birds. They have collected,
treated sick birds, and later released them on Federal refuges. They have built
shelters and nesting and resting islands, erected fences to protect wildlife food and
cover vegetation from livestock. They have carried on erosion control work to
prevent silting up of waterfowl ponds and to protect the ranges of big game
animals.

STREAMS WERE IMPROVED FOR FISH
Administrative facilities have been bettered through a myriad of activities,
including surveying, constructing headquarters and service buildings, truck and
foot trails, fire lanes, lookout towers, boat-landings, patrol-boats and barges, and
telephone lines.
THE NATIONAL RESTORATION PROGRAM
Thus available manpower has come at the critical time in the development of
national wildlife policies. The Biological Survey?s restoration program, provi-
dentially financed by emergency and special funds, has been implemented by the
CCC. The areas acquired were in most cases merely prospective refuges. They
needed much development, and from the CCC camps came the workers for this
development.
During the past 5 years, CCC camps have been at work on 40 refuges or breeding
grounds along migration routes and on wintering grounds of migratory birds, as
well as on big-game refuges and in fur-bearing animal areas. Work by enrollees
at side camps has provided improvements on six other refuge areas.
The work of these CCC camps has a twofold objective: First, to make the
refuges more attractive to wildlife; second, to make such improvements as will
facilitate administration. The first of the two is of the greater importance. To
accomplish this the emphasis is placed on work that will assure unfluctuating
water supplies and restore food-and-cover-producing vegetation.


The vital relationship of the conservation, use, and control of water to the
successful functioning of refuges has received special attention. Biologists con-
sult with engineers to plan dams, dikes, and water-control structures to be built
by CCC enrollees. Each area is studied to determine its peculiar deficiencies and
the special measures needed to overcome them. Along the eastern coast, fresh-
water ponds have been provided in regions where salt water is predominant. In
coastal marshes, water levels have been stabilized to the great benefit of vegetation
and dependent animal life. In dry areas of the West, reservoirs have been con-
structed to conserve the spring run-oflF for maintenance of nesting and feeding
marshes.
The CCC job has also included the construction of nesting islands ranging from
those three-quarters of a mile in length down to the small muskrat-lodge type.
Some are planted with grass for duck and shorebird nesting; some are gravelly
landing bars for geese; a few are rocky to attract gulls, terns, cormorants, and
other birds. Not only do these islands furnish ideal nesting sites, relatively safe
from predators, but they serve also as wave breakers to protect shore lines from
erosion, and to favor the growth of aquatic food plants.
The planting in tremendous quantity of marsh and aquatic vegetation, shrubs,
vines, and soil-binding grasses has been a highly important accomplishment, both
in increasing wildlife productivity on refuges and in decreasing soil erosion. Dur-
TRANSPLANTING FOOD AND COVER PLANTS FOR WILDLIFE. NORTH DAKOTA


ing the past year alone, more than 1,000,000 trees were set out by CCC enrollees
on refuges primarily to provide windbreaks and wildlife cover; secondarily, to
landscape refuge headquarters sites.
To supplement the natural vegetative cover, on many of the refuges all but
destroyed because of long periods of drought, unchecked erosion, and overgrazing,
approximately 1,000 shelters of various types were erected for winter protection
of upland game birds and mammals. Many were of the lean-to type; others were
in the form of tepees; some were of the open-brush-pile variety.
To facilitate refuge management ?the second fundamental objective?truck
trails, bridges, lookout towers, fire lanes, telephone lines, small headquarters and
utility buildings, seed and tuber-storage cellars have been constructed. To keep
out livestock and prevent trespass, fences and boundary markers have been erected.
The gathering and planting of aquatic seeds and tubers, stream and lake-bank
protection, soil conservation, general clean-up, and salvaging of old buildings are
other contributions of the CCC enrollees to the program of refuge improvement.
Five years of CCC activity under the technical supervision of field agents of the
Biological Survey have brought about a remarkable physical transformation of
refuge areas, especially in the West. Now, becoming covered with mantles of
protective vegetation and having stabilized water areas, these refuges stand out
in marked contrast to the surrounding eroded dry lands.
ALL FOR WILDLIFE
But wildlife is not the concern of any one agency alone, for wildlife cannot be
separated from the land. It is an essential part of any natural area, and any
agency administering land is rightly an agency for wildlife conservation. The
Biological Survey is the Nation?s wildlife service, yet the total area of its 250
efuges does not approach in size the area of our national forests and national

parks. With the exception of waterfowl, there is thus naturally more wildlife
on Federal lands administered by the Forest Service and the National Park
Service than could possibly be accommodated on all the Federal wildlife refuges
administered by the Biological Survey,
One of the encouraging aspects of present attitudes toward wildlife is the fact
that all Federal land-administering agencies are interested in wildlife, either
directly or as a worthwhile byproduct of primary land and resource management-
This condition is well illustrated by the wildlife benefits resulting from the CCC
work for these agencies.
The CCC work of the Forest Service has improved the conditions for
growth of trees; increased the amount of ?browse? and cover for wildlife;
improved and restocked many fishing streams; built dams to stabilize water
levels; fed wildlife at large during critical weather. Wildlife objectives and
programs that would have had to be deferred, or laid by indefinitely, were given
large impetus by the Forest Service through its CCC camps, which in the 5-year
period have devoted almost a million man-days? work to wildlife.
Consideration by the foresters has been given to wildlife in tree-planting opera-
tions, and certain National and State forest nurseries are giving space to trees and
shrubs to be planted where they will contribute to better wildlife habitat.
The Forest Service says: ?Since July 1, 1934, expenditures for wildlife adminis-
tration on the national forests have gradually increased until, tor the fiscal year
1937, they were more than 4}i times that of 1933. Between 50 and 60 percent of
this increase may be credited to the CCC.?
Under the technical supervision of the Soil Conservation Service, CCC camps
have concentrated actively upon restoration of vegetative cover in combating soil
erosion. Thus increased wildlife habitat is also provided, and two programs are
advanced. In addition, enrollees have constructed dams, fenced off and planted

the banks of reservoirs so created. Thousands of check dams to prevent cutting
wasteland farm areas have been erected, miles of diversion ditches dug to distribute
water, and millions of trees, shrubs, and vines planted to hold the soil, including
permanent patches of herbaceous and shrubby wildlife food plants. Thus in
controlling erosion, havens for wildlife are created.
In its drainage work, the Bureau of Agricultural Engineering?s CCC workers
have been instructed to do no more clearing than absolutely necessary to improve
channels proper. Whenever practicable, brush so removed has been piled and
fastened down to serve as cover for birds and small game. The ditches, in many
instances, provide cover for

Dams have been built,

refuge areas posted by CCC workers under plans of the Tennessee \ alley
Authority?s Technical Agency. And, by throwing their CCC men into work di-
rected by the Regional Planning Studies Department, other dams have been
built, other thousands of wildlife food and cover shrubs and plants set out.
The National Park Service has used CCC labor to make its parks and monu-
ments more attractive, more suitable, and safer for wildlife. It, too, has lent its
cooperation in the building of diversion dams and water-control structures; in
planting to prevent sheet erosion and in field and aquatic planting or seeding for
food and cover; in building fish-rearing ponds and stocking streams; in feeding
and erecting shelters for wildlife. Near Knoxville, Tenn., a CCC camp, under
National Park Service and the State Department of Fish and Game supervision, is
building the largest quail and wild-turkey hatchery in the world, for stocking
lands where hunting is restricted.
In western and southwestern National and State parks, small pools for wildlife
use have been developed. In the arid Southwest, water holes built have been used
extensively by antelope and have proved attractive to deer and quail. Artificial
lakes have been improved as waterfowl resting and nesting grounds by means of
duck-food plantings and construction of nesting islands. Barriers have been con-
structed on sections of certain lakes providing sanctuary for game and nongame
birds, mammals, and spawning fish.
OTHERS MAKE IT UNANIMOUS
Wildlife has benefited also by CCC work done under the aegis of the Office of
Indian Affairs, the Division of Grazing, the Bureau of Reclamation, and other
agencies.

One of the most important phases of CCC work
on Indian reservations during these 5 years has
been the construction of reservoirs in the Great
Plains region and in the arid Southwest. Intended
primarily to furnish a water supply for stock,
these reservoirs likewise are a means of flood con-
tro lon small drainage areas. Hundreds of these
afford suitable resting and feeding places for ducks,
geese, and other wild birds; 30 were constructed as
especially adapted to the rearing of fish. Grouse,
pheasants, and other game birds have been dis-
tributed and protected on many reservations. For
the Indian Service also is included the stocking of
beavers, big game, and game birds, and the pro-
vision of winter shelters. On South Dakota and
Montana reservations extensive areas have been
fenced, and game animals restored to areas where
they formerly roamed free.
Through its CCC camps, the Division of Grazing
has fenced areas for wildlife purposes and reseeded
and planted trees, grasses, and range plants. In

Idaho and Oregon the CCC boys constructed enclosures around important water
holes as a means of protecting young sage grouse against the trampling of livestock.
Outstanding wildlife activity of the Bureau ot Reclamation s CCC camps is the
development of a refuge along the shores of the Lake W alcott Reservoir in southern
Idaho, which is being jointly supervised by the Biological Survey and the Bureau
of Reclamation. Similar projects are being carried on at other reservoirs in
California, Montana, and elsewhere in Idaho, and CCC enrollees Irom the rec-
lamation camps, as from other agencies camps, have been used for emergency
feeding and protection of deer and birds under adverse weather conditions.
A NEW DEAL FOR WILDLIFE
In the prosecution of the CCC program, as a whole, every attempt has thus been
made to integrate the knowledge and skills of wildlife technicians, foresters, park
experts, soil conservation specialists, and many others. Conservation was not a
problem to be satisfactorily split into neat, separate packages, each to be handled
without regard to the others.
Balance in CCC work, with regard to the whole problem of conservation, was
essential. As evidence of this, one will find wildlife technicians in soil conserva-
tion camps, in park and in forest camps ?as well as in camps devoted exclusively to
wildlife work. In Biological Survey camps there are foresters, engineers, and
other technicians not wildlife specialists. This integrated approach and handling
of the work has operated to benefit wildlife and all other phases of conservation.


F?39718A
THE WILD TURKEY IS COMING BACK
In this effort there was needed ?and is being obtained ?the constant coopera-
tion of nearly every Federal agency connected with wildlife or other phases of
conservation, and of the great majority of the State agencies connected with these
important problems. Thus it has been possible to reconcile points of view that
had seemed mutually antagonistic, and to obtain full and free discussion among the
many interested agencies.
Through the CCC the wildlife resources have been given another vital aid the
value of which is hard to determine by quantitative methods. More than 2,000,-
000 men, mostly youths, have been employed by the CCC. A high percentage of
them have at some time done constructive work to improve our wildlife resources.
They?ve rubbed shoulders with the problem. They are a youthful backlog of
informed, public opinion such as we have never before had in this country.
Wildlife, to them, is not simply something read about in books, shot, or fished
for now. It is a national asset, and they are conscious of its value because they
have helped to restore, preserve, and protect it. This wider dissemination of
practical wildlife knowledge may, in the long run, be the most valuable contribu-
tion to wildlife resources made by the CCC.
