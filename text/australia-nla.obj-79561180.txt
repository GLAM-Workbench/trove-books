AUSTRALIA.
In the history of the colony of New South Wales there occur
several remarkable passages, a review of which is calculated both to
supply matter of immediate interest, and t� furnish instruction for any
emergencies that may arise hereafter. A ?short glance at the past will
enable us more fully to understand the present position of the settle-
ment, and to speculate more securely on its future prospects. Its late
depression, indeed, (however paradoxical the statement may appear) is
in a great measure to be attributed to the influence of the same causes
which led to its unusually rapid advancement.
In the month of May, a.d. 1787, a fleet started for Botany Bay,
for the purpose of transporting convicts to, and planting a colony in,
that distant portion of the globe. The expedition, which was under the
direction of Capt. Phillip, comprised six transports, having on board
564 male and 192 female convicts, together with the necessary com-
plement of soldiers, and a few of their wives and children. In the
succeeding January (after touching at Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of
Good Hope) they arrived at Botany Bay, but owing to the badness of
its harbour, the scanty supply of fresh water, and poorness of the
surrounding soil, they removed to Sydney cove in Port Jackson. Here
they commenced pitching their tents, and erecting slab huts on the
cleared spaces of the barren forest, where scarcely more than half a
century afterwards, a city of 30,000 souls stretched its commodious
wharfs, and long lines of white streets, arewund one of the most pictures-
que and noble harbours of the world.
In the month of May following, the emtire live-stock of the colony
consisted of 2 bulls, 5 cows, 1 horse, 3 rrnares, 3 colts, 29 sheep, 19
goats, 74 pigs, 5 rabbits, 18 turkeys, 219 geese, 35 ducks, and 210
fowls*. It was not until the year 1797, tthat Mr. Mac Arthur laid the
foundation of the wealth of Australia, in tlhe importation of three rams
from the royal flocks at Windsor, having been previously in possession
of about 40 ewes and other sheep, procured from various sources. We
annex the following statements here, to shew, by way of contrast, the
rapidity of increase in colonial products, and shall return to the subject
more in detail when examining the present condition of the colony.
In 1843, the wool exported amounted to 12,704,899 lbs., valued at
383,647�. In the same year the sheep in the colony amounted to
5,055,337 ; pigs, 57,767 ; horses, 62,017 ; horned cattle, 1,017,316.
We may here pause to inquire to what we can attribute an increase of
wealth in a given period, and under peculiar circumstances, which defies
almost all parallel in history. Labouring under the disadvantages of
distant markets, and difficulties of transport, Australia has aheady
surpassed Spain in the supply to the mother-country of its fleecy trea-
sures. Under defective governments, with a promiscuous and not
unexceptionable population, and having its very existence in the com-
mencement of its career, threatened by the insubordination and idleness
of its convict community, it had grown, in the very short period of fifty

years, from the feebleness of infancy to a matured adolescence. Its
progress, no less steady than quick, could have arisen from no artificial
fostering, but must have been the necessary result of natural advantages,
of peculiarities of climate and of pasture. We have lately seen and
lamented how it has been arrested in its inarch of improvement, and
how an universal success has been supplanted by an almost universal
failure. But we may ask, has any change come over the character of
the country itself; has nature withdrawn the liberal hand with which
she scattered fertility on its soil and infused health into its atmosphere?
On the contrary, we conceive that the very richness of the country has,
in a measure, led to the poverty of its occupants ; that a too eager and
injudicious grasping at thie fruits it held out to be gathered by the
patient hand of industry, has for awhile defeated, though it cannot
altogether destroy, the boumtiful intentions of Providence.
We have here alluded too one cause of the distress prevailing in this
southern portion of our dominions?the adventurous spirit which
unexampled prosperity hadl encouraged. The consequence was that
hundreds, altogether withoout capital and almost without any title to
credit, rushed hastily into so profitable a trade. Money was advanced
at long dates, the only chamce of repaying which was the success of the
undertaking on which it wras risked. Debts were contracted at high
rates of interest, to be liquidated when interest had fallen. The prices
of all property were fictitiously high, and where credit was readily
given, credit was readily diemanded. When a reverse in profits and
prices, arising from severall causes, occurred, the public fall was great
in proportion to the height arrived at; and, as usually happens in such
cases, the sudden re-action oof moral feeling, arising from this state of
things, doubly aggravated! the mischief. Mr. Hood quotes from
Buckingham?s America somie passages which he conceives applicable to
the condition of New Soutlh Wales. ? But the remote and real cause
of this crisis,? says Mr. Buckingham, ? was first the habit which all
classes seem within the lasst few years to have contracted?of specu-
lating beyond their means, cof living beyond their income, of spending
money before it was acquired, and of keeping up the appearance of men
who had realized large forrtunes, while they were only in the act of
accumulating them; and so > long as the credit system allowed them to
import largely from Englamd, and to pay by notes and bills at long
dates, the evil day could be deferred, by one expedient succeeding
another.??p. 355.
Though the causes of tlhe deplorable situation of the colony were
more complicated than those which led to a similar state of things in
America, we believe that tlhe description of society above given is to a
certain extent applicable fcco both countries. But we cannot, in this
place, pass by the aspersions cast on the colony by those who are them-
selves not absolved from aril blame of contributing to its depression.
We allude to the mercantile; community of Great Britain. Tempted by
reports of its exuberant amd continued prosperity, the English mer-
chants forwarded goods upom goods to Sydney, until the warehouses of
the place were choked up with imports; and when their property was
sold for half, or less than Hialf its value, they vented their disappoint-
ment in abuse of colonial hionesty. The merchants of Sydney, rather
than return the goods to England, and dishonour the drafts of their


correspondents, applied to the local banks fior advances, and received
them. Fresh supplies of goods arrived froim home. The merchants
became more involved, and less enabled to paiy, as the goods would not
sell. The banks themselves fell into embairrassment, and the whole
country became involved. Regarding the miuch calumniated morality,
and the bad commercial faith of our trans-eqjuatorial dependency, it is
only just that we should take into consideration the very peculiar
circumstances in which it has been placed. Such a sudden change from
universal success to general adversity has mever, we believe, occurred
before, and the losers and disappointed, but who are still comfortably
blessed with the goods of this life, are imperfect judges of the degree of
guilt attaching to men whose wits have been sharpened by penury, and
whom hunger prompts to expedients. We cannot justify much that has
occurred in the colonial transactions, hut neither can we forget the vast
and improper facilities existing for obtaining; loans of money, of which
no doubt in many instances people recklessly availed themselves, but
which in many others would have been repaid, and the transactions been
of eventual benefit to the community but for the unfortunate occurrence
of so many counteracting circumstances.
We now come to an important feature in the history of New South
Wales?the discontinuance of transportation,. A gentleman, well qua-
lified to judge, had previously advocated the abolishment of this system*.
He affirms�convict labour ?to be much more expensive than free
labour, independently of the other glaring evils by which it is at-
tended but adds, ? besides the impolicy in (other respects of putting an
immediate stop to transportation to New South Wales, the sudden
adoption of such a measure would undoubtedly operate as a serious
check for a time to the progress of the cohonystill ? when the first
difficulties, incidental to the change, should have passed away, the
growth of the colony, springing from puraar elements, would be more
rapid, more vigorous, and infinitely more seouref.?
We cannot here enter into an examination! as to how far the amount
of crime, necessarily existing in a penal settlement, has been increased,
in the present instance, by the improper regulation of the system. We
however feel certain that no community raised on the foundation of
moral filth, can eventually prosper, unless some powerful and purifj'ing
leaven be mixed with it in intimate combination. There can, we think,
be no question, that the rapid rise of Australia was, in the first instance,
very materially facilitated by the employment of gratuitous convict
labour, but it seems equally clear to us, (that that supply must, and
should, in process of time, altogether cease.. The evil lay in the sudden
discontinuance' of the transportation systeem, whereby the colonists

f If in England the dearness of labour has the efiffect of raising the price of stock,
it is owing to the largeness of the population and thee extent of the demand, while the
greater wealth of the proprietor enables him to i hold back from the market till a
more convenient period. The greater resources on i which he can fall back, and the
more varied choices of occupation to which he couldd turn his hands, permit him to
discontinue breeding for a time; but in a country / like New South Wales there is,

and prices fall because the settler is compelled tto continue breeding, and to offer

were deprived of a large amount of labour, without the possibility of
obtaining any substitute for so serious a deficiency. Something like a
pledge had been previously given by His Majesty?s Secretary of State for
the Colonies, and approved of by the Lords of the Treasury, that the
proceeds of the sale of crown lands should be expended exclusively on
the importation of an industrious and moral population from the shores
of the mother-country. This object, whose importance was greatly
increased by the impure nature of the great mass of the colonial com-
munity, could not evidently be attained by private enterprise alone, as
it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to have secured the
services of the labourer, to the individual who had imported him at a
considerable expense, and who was, for that very reason, prevented
giving as high wages as would be offered by others, who had not
incurred a similar outlay. When, in 1831, grants of land ceased, and
the land was sold, and thie funds arising therefrom were considered
pledged to the introduction! of free labour, on the strength of this
confidence, the flock-raastter purchased largely, supposing that he
would have a larger numbmr of both assigned and free servants. But
the Colonial Government, aiding on an opposite principle, increased the
number of assigned servantts to such only as small agriculturists and
leaseholders, thus tempting tthe large flock-owner to purchase his interest
at the expense of his homesty. In the meantime, the Government
hoarded the money arising from land sales, and a partial emigration
only was effected, partly by' Government, and proceeding partly on the
bounty system. The flock-master, in order to supply the deficiency,
attempted to import Coolies from India, which was officially put a stop
to, assignment being discontinued at the same juncture, and the land
fund applied to other purposes than those to which it was originally
destined. The distress of the flock-master naturally ensued. His
flocks became burdensomely large, and he was often obliged to kill his
lambs to prevent the sheep from breeding. We have heard of an
instance of a gentleman who directed that his sheep should be sold for
what they would fetch, and if they found no purchasers, that they
should be driven into the river to perish. Thus the staple commodity
of the colony was destroyed, and the mother-country injured to a
corresponding degree, in hen - commerce and her manufactures. If, when
in old times, the settler hadl the benefit of the labour of the convict, and
placed against this advantage the saving he effected to the Government in
the food and clothing of thie labourer, such an argument was not held
to exempt him from contributing towards the expense of the additional
police and gaol establishment which the convict system rendered
necessary, he may now fainily urge that, as he, at present, derives no
benefit whatever from the ffelons in question, he cannot be equitably
called on to defray any portion of the outlay consequent on the removal
of iniquity from the shores of Great Britain to those of his adopted
country*.
* The quota of the expenditure of the colony on police and gaols, and the admi-
nistration of justice, from the year 1835, and chargeable in greater strictness to the
account of British criminals, amounts in round numbers to 790,000/. To provide
the amount required for the above services weighs as a burden on the colonist, pre-
venting the spread of education, and checking internal improvement. This is more
especially felt now that transportation has ceased, and the expenditure of the Home

Whatever be the merit or result of the questtion stated above, there
can be no doubt that the hasty and unprovidesd-for discontinuance of
the supply of forced labour was a heavy blow too the prosperity of the
land where it had been so freely available. Australia ceased to be a
penal colony in 1840, and next year the assignment of convicts to
private service was discontinued. Now, on exxamining the tables of
the amount of imports, we shall find that the imiports of
Thus the immense and unnatural amount of imports to which we
have before alluded, and which resulted from the prosperity, fictitious
and exaggerated, as well as real, of the settlement, appears to be syn-
chronous with the withdrawal of the supply of labour ; and the separate
evils were greatly aggravated by both occuring at the same period.
We now arrive at the consideration of what we are inclined to view
as another cause of colonial distress*, viz., the raising of the Govern-
ment price of land. We shall here again have recourse to the returns
of land sales, and we find that in
In the year 1841 the system of sale at a fixed price of 1 1, per acre
was introduced into Port Phillip. In 1842 the system of sale by
auction was resumed throughout the colony, at a minimum of 12s. per
acre; and in 1843, this minimum price was raised to 20.?. The raising
of the price of land was thus introduced about the period when the
causes before alluded to began to exert their baneful influence on colo-
nial prosperity. The immediate and large fall in the amount of the
sums realized at the sales is very striking, nor can we imagine how any
other result could have been anticipated from a regulation fixing that
the lowest price of land should be 20s. per acre in a country where it
Government for convict and military services has been diminished. It has been pro-
posed that the English Government should send out an equivalent number of emigrants
to liquidate its aforesaid debt to the colony. In Great Britain people are starving from
want of employment, and in Australia hundreds of cattle are being daily destroyed
for the sake of their hides and tallow only. Since the foundation of the colony, up
to 1810, 59,788 convicts were transported.
* We have often alluded to the distress existing in New South Wales. We can-
not give a more striking picture of its extent than by mentioning an instance of a
gentleman, who landed in Sydney, from England, in the middle of 1844. While
walking the streets, he was struck by the number and unusual excellence of the
cabs and hackney-coaches, and on remarking the fact, was given to understand that
these had been, a short time back, the carriages of the wealthy gentlemen of the
place, and had been transferred to their present use, with sometimes the horses that
drew them and the coachmen that drove them.

takes three acres (7 acres. Stryelecki, p. 459,) to feed a single sheep.
Surely the proper amount to be paid on this score can he safely entrusted
to free competition and the private interest of the stockholder. Be-
sides, as Mr. Hood remarks, there will no be offers to purchase when
the upset price of the land is above the public opinion of its value,
whereas, when stimulated by competition, if offered low, speculators
may be induced to pay more for it than either its real value or the
upset price.
When, in 1843, the settlers werte struggling under the pressure of so
many and such heavy the leading local bank failed to an
immense amount, not only entailinig the loss of the whole of the paid
up capital of 224,950�., but burcdening the shareholders with further
liabilities. We shall not here stopp to remark on the very unaccount-
able mismanagement to which the 1 bank of Australia owed its downfall,
but merely draw our readers? atteention to the paralyzing effect such an
occurrence, happening at such a poeriod, must have had on the well-being
of the settlement. As long, indeeed, as this incubus on colonial pros-
perity exists, no great improvemoent in its condition can be expected.
So many individuals are affected I by it, directly or indirectly 7 , that no
man?s solvency can be safely asssumed. Universal suspicion and dis-
trust are thereby engendered, as mo person will accommodate his neigh-
bour with credit of any species,-, when repayment becomes doubtful
from the possible prior liabilities of the borrower. Nor will land and
stock find a ready sale, when, in tlhe first place, a purchaser cannot be
sure as to the title conveyed, besicdes being fearful of not turning them
to good account in the general powerty, and of not being repaid for any
sales of produce during the general insolvency.
We shall allude only briefly to some remaining causes of colonial
distress, among which one very palpable one is that, in consequence of
the wars in China and India, and of the generally disturbed state of
trade, the price of wool in England fell from 3s. to Is. per pound.
This cause may of course cease at any time to operate, but as it origi-
nated during the above disastrous period, and was of most protracted
existence, we can hardly over-estimate its Injurious effects. The local
banks, in some measure, encouraged speculation at the commencement
by lending money without sufficient caution and inquiry. Discounts, in
the first instance, rose, thus giviing a favourable appearance to such
transactions; but in process of thine they fell, from the inability of the
borrowers to pay a high rate of imterest. Having, however, once made
the advance, the banks were indiuced to renew the bills, as the only
chance of regaining their moneyy, well knowing that to press their
debtor was to entail the loss of tihe loan. The evil which they helped
to originate they also helped to increase by somewhat harshly with-
holding all subsequent accommodlation. They themselves became em-
barrassed by the dealings which tthey had with the Local Government,
which kept large deposits in their hands, in return for which the latter
managed the public accounts. This might have been considered a
sufficient reciprocation of the favour conferred, but the Government
exacted from them an interest off 7 per cent., thereby compelling them
to make use of more money thani they could employ advantageously or
lend safely. When the sums in (question were called in, to pay for im-
migration, the banks had difficulties in meeting the call. We may here


remark that the above rate of 7 per cent:, on deposits was forced on the
colonial banks by the English ones, andl, besides encouraging specula-
tion, much money was thus looked up fr<om circulation, the? holders pre-
ferring security with such good interest, and the banks being afraid of
lending out to any great extent.
We have sketched cursorily the prevailing sources to which may be
traced the deplorable change in the aspect of colonial affairs. So many
concurring and untoward events are amply sufficient to account for the
darkest cloud that ever overshadowed the prosperity of any country
whatever; nor can we wonder at hearing that an estate, which would
formerly have been rented at 30s. an acre, was lately to be had, includ-
ing house, &c., at the rate of Is. 6 d? and that sheep have been sold at
la. 6d. a-head which would have realized from 40a. to 50a. not many
years since. The sun of brighter days has, however, begun to emerge
through the mists of a long adversity, and the - better prices and better
general state of things now succeeding, will assert the natural and in-
defeasible claim of the country to commercial importance. The price
of wool has already risen?the misadventures of the past will teach
wisdom for the future ; more prudent habits have been inculcated by the
lessons of a very sad experience, and the way to opulence, though
longer than it once was, will not be intersected bv so many bye-paths,
whose end was destruction. The reaction which must necessarily follow,
has been hitherto deferred by the circumstance of property after pro-
perty falling into the market, and thus keeping prices down at the lowest
level. Each succeeding newspaper teemed with fresh advertisements of
sales, nor have these melancholy announcements yet entirely ceased to
appear. Their total discontinuance will be the signal for fairer action
and healthier enterprize. The want of confidence universally generated,
has-been hitherto a main hindrance to recovery. Mutual accommoda-
tion has been prevented, and much capital locked up from being pro-
ductive. It is not easy in this country to understand the state of things
as existing in the other hemisphere. Sheep were-sold there in 1844 at
la. 4 d., whose wool alone would yield at the least 2a. a-head at the next
shearing, and cattle were disposed of at the same sale for 9a. , which,
when boiled down for tallow and gelatine, would produce about 18a.
per animai. It is hardly possible to account altogether for these facts,
without supposing a general panic, which paralyzes all exertion. We
gladly hail the symptoms of renewed health and activity.
We trust that the Government will not neglect to perform its part in
the struggle for recovery, by reducing the exorbitant upset price of
land. It might be well in the prosperous state of the colony, and when
people abounded in cash and hope, that the price of land should be fixed
at a high rate, in order to check the raslh and prevailing speculations in
this investment. The price, too, it may be said, should be fixed high
for another reason, viz., to prevent those; who come out as labourers from
turning independent farmers. We admiit the inexpediency of such an
occurrence, but we think it may be obviiated and great good otherwise
effected, by compelling these emigrants, Ibefore becoming landholders, to
refund the amount of money expended on their passage out. But no
mere sheep-walk can repay the purchaser at so extravagant a price as
20a. an acre, and he is moreover entitleid to have the money so raised,
laid out in the importation of emigrants,, or in the general improvement

of the country*. This we consider but fair, as England benefits by the
removal of her paupers without expense to herself, the whole charges of
bounty -emigration being defrayed from the land fund. If this fund be
misappropriated, or if the land meets with no purchasers, emigration on
this principle must of course cease. We here take occasion to correct
an important error which has obtained in Great Britain, viz., that
labour is superabundant in New South Wales, because accounts have
been received from there of people wandering about the streets of
Sydney without employment, of others emigrating to Valparaiso, &c.
These statements are in a measure true, but the inference drawn is
erroneous. The mistake has arisen from improper people having been
sent out. Shepherds, almost exclusively, are required, and the idle
emigrants who have arrivatd, with exaggerated notions of their own impor-
tance and claim to remuneration, prefer sauntering about the metropolis,
to watching flocks in the solitudes of the interior. We may give as an
instance of what w-e have alleged, the description of four individuals,
who in 1844 were sent mp as shepherds to a gentleman residing on
Hunter?s River. The first was a broken-down linen-draper, and arrived
in gay attire by the mail-ctoach. The second was an army man, and had
been, it was supposed, an tofficer. The third w'as a schoolmaster, and the
fourth candidate for pastoiral employment, was an old man with silver spec-
tacles, who had been waiter at an inn. Now', w r e ask, wdiat can be ex-
pected, w'hen the wants off the colonists are supplied after this fashion,
and at a time, moreover, wihen stock-holders were being ruined daily from
the difficulty of procuring ai sufficiency of cheap labour ? We repeat, send
out shepherds, or those calculated to become shepherds, and other
labourers will naturally fallow. How far the domestic requirements of
the settlers have been suittably met, may be judged of by the fact, that
in one instance (at least) the female emigrants, not of the most aristo-
cratic class, expected to Ibe waited on immediately on reaching shore,
with offers of marriage bjy the gentlemen of the colony.
We believe that the twesnty-shilling price of land has been advocated
by well-intentioned peophe in this country, in furtherance of the con-
centration system, and om the grounds, that when population is widely
spread, religious instruction and education are rendered impossible.
But it must be considered,, that to enforce this centralization in Australia,
is equivalent to a law for prohibiting the growing of wool. We trust
that we shall not be considered as comparing- the importance of the suc-
cessful cultivation of any imatural product whatever, with that of religious


knowledge, but we may be allowed to doulht whether the interests of
religion be forwarded by that compulsory fosstering which forbids occu-
pation, for which the country possesses a mairked natural fitness, which
are innocent in themselves, and which bear ran their face only an incom-
patibility with moral progress. Also (supposing that the object in view
can be obtained by the proposed method,) iff we take away wool-grow-
ing, we take away the very life of the colony, for on its wool, as on a
basis, rests its whole prosperity. By such ai measure then, we should
destroy a wide field for religious cultivation. If, moreover, sheep-sta-
tions spread, towns will eventually spring up at convenient distances.
Wealth will in process of time, accrue to the station-owners, and those
may be fairly taxed for the support of an itinerant clergy. We may
add, that the men so tending their flocks, are fitted, by the quiet and
seclusion of the life they lead, for receiving religious impressions, and
by reading, occasional visits, &c., they may be well prepared for enter-
ing with advantage on a new course whenever their period of servitude
expires ; whereas, congregate the same men in masses, and it will require
a far greater amount of time and effort to effect among them an equal
degree of good. In the system of forced concentration, we may sus-
pect an enthusiasm which aims at an object without regard to means?
means too, which when pointed out by nature so strongly as to seem
almost unavoidable, should be seized on and turned to account.
In page 272 of Mr. Hood?s work, we find an extraordinary statement
of the excess of the male over the female population. This state of
things, which has prevailed so long, must have been equally injurious to
the morality of the country and detrimental to its progress.
?Suppose the whole population of Australia were now grown up and wished
to be married, out of every hundred bachelors, only forty-one could find
wives. Supposing all the unmarried males, now of age, wished to be mar-
ried, out of every hundred only eleven could find wives. Supposing all the
free bachelors now in the colony wished to be married, out of every hundred
only eight could find wives ! As there are at present in the colony 06,366
unmarried males, and only 26,007 unmarried females, it follows, that before
every son of Adam could be provided with a daughter of Eve, there must
be introduced no fewer than 40,369 unmarried daughters!?
From later statements than Mr. Hood?s, we are enabled to show that
matters are improving in this particular. The increase of males in
1843 over 1842, was 2 - 8 per cent., while the corresponding increase of
females was 4' B per cent., thus correcting- the inequality of the sexes.
The proportion of females was?
In 1836, 39 per cent of males.
1841, 50 ?
1842, 59 ?
1843, 60
The gain of female children by deaths ini 1842 and 1843 was 246.
The comparative deficiency of the female sexs should he attended to in
the arrangements of the importation system, ;and, as connected with the
subject, it may he well to bear in mind, that tthe wife of a shepherd will
receive nearly as much wages apd rations as Iher husband.
It may be asked why, in the dearth of agricmltural and pastoral labour,
the importation of Coolies from the North off India, a race of men well
calculated for living in the Australian bush, was not persevered in. The
main difficulty in the continuance of this system was the intelligible


one of its being prohibited by the Government of India, in consequence,
we believe, of instructions from home. We confess that we do not un-
derstand why the introduction of these Indian labourers into the British
settlements of the South, is liable to greater abuse, or likely to be pro-
ductive of worse consequences than their introduction into such countries
as the Mauritius and West Indies, where slavery has already been, and
has, we may suppose, left some moral traces of its existence. Nor can
we foresee any insuperable difficulties which beset the Indian authorities
in guarding the right which all men have by nature of leaving one
country for another, against being taken an improper advantage of.
We would further ask, whether it be probable, or even possible, that
greater enormities can be committed in this so-called traffic, than have
already existed in the insidious transplantation of free-born Britons into
some colonial Atlantis ? We cannot think that the expense of convey-
ance from India would prevent a pretty general adoption of the measure.
The voyage from Hindostan is shorter than that from Great Britain,
and not only would tlie Coolie be content with lower wages than his
white brother, but the cost of his passage would be less in reference to
the cheaper nature of his food, and greater simplicity of his accommo-
dation. We can see no objection to the adoption of this plan until the
better circumstances of the colony create, as they certainly will, a
natural channel for free British emigration. We discern no danger of
a coloured race springing up to any extent, where the Coolie would be
constantly employed many miles distant from all social intercourse.
The supply of Coolie labour, would not necessarily check, but wmuld
rather have a tendency to increase, eventually, the influx of British
emigrants,
Mr. Hood seems not to have decided between the importation of
Indian labourers and the modified continuance of the assignment system.
The return to convict-labour should not, at any rate, be otherwise than
temporary, and last only till measures can be brought to bear for the
supply of a better description. Nor would we advocate its re-adoption,
until we see how matters will turn out in Australia, when the many
elements of convulsion! shall have subsided into quiet. Should, how-
ever, the convict plan be renewed, we conceive that its regulation is
capable of great improovement, and we are disposed to approve of em-
ploying the men as suggested by an intelligent settler (Dr. Mitchell) to
the colonial authorities.. The convicts might be assigned as shepherds,
and as shepherds or>Up, whereby we should secure the advantage of
solitary confinement, wvithout its accompanying evils of mental and
bodily injury. Such ai plan would, in fact, amount to solitary confine-
ment (if the term may be allowed) in the open air, and the absence
from bad company, and the peaceful and meditative nature of the life,
would have a direct influence in the reformation of the criminal. The
labour, moreover, would not, like that of agriculture, be too severe for
a weakly person, and punishment would be thereby equalized. Such a
mode of assigning the convict would remunerate the State which trans-
ported him, by encouraging the employment of her shipping, and in-
creasing the demand for her manufactures, while it would confer
corresponding benefit on the land where it was made to operate. In
7an Diemen?s Land the convicts are congregated in masses, and em-
ployed so as to render the advantage of their labour doubtful, and their


immorality certain. With reference to tthe same injudicious system, we
are confident that it is impossible to pointt out a more fruitful forcing-bed
of impurity than the convict barracks off Sydney, nor can we imagine
how it can be otherwise, where criminals are clustered together, and the
foulness of corrupt contact spreads from man to man, till the whole mass
becomes one moral sore. In no cases slhould the convicts be assigned
as mere domestic servants, to be comfibrtably housed, well fed, and
clothed in livery immediately after landiing, as a result of their trans-
gressions ; and we would deprecate too amy admixture of educated crimi-
nals with the ignorant and unenlightenedl-
- have dwelt at some length on the subject of providing a suitable
supply of labour for the Australian market. Without this, the growth
of wool, the staple article of the country, must inevitably languish. Of
the importance of this product we have already spoken, nor can its
value be easily over-estimated, when it can be made to rival that of
Germany in the fineness of its fibre, and when it is not necessary, as in
the latter country, to house the sheep at night, or to grow artificial pas-
turage for their sustenance.
The amount of wool exported in
1834, was 2,246,933 lbs., value �213,628
1838, 5,749,376 lbs., ? 405,977
1843, 12,704,899 lbs., ? 685,647
We shall pass briefly over some remaining particulars connected with
the well-being of the settlement. Capital is required in the country,
and if invested judiciously, at the present low prices of land and stock
(sheep being purchasable at about 10.?., cattle at 41., and horses at 20 1.
a head), would yield an ample return. An influx of capital, although
it raised the wages of labour still higher, would create relief by taking
off the hands of the present capitalists some of their superabundant
stock, and enabling them to turn their attention more profitably to the
remainder. By increasing the demand, it would also raise the prices
of produce in general. Though there be still the same amount of
money and of mouths in the colony as formerly, wethers for instance
do not sell for nearly as much as they used to do, because the owners
are compelled to send to market so many thousands which otherwise
they would have retained for shearing.
It has been suggested that the system of leasing might be introduced
more extensively into New South Wales. The Canada Land Company,
in the year ending 22nd Nov., 1843, sold 18,977 acres, and leased
132,395 acres, from which it is concluded! that the latter system is pre-
ferred by the majority of emigrants, who are generally small capitalists,
and not being called on for any large diisbursements, are enabled to
purchase stock, &c., with their surpluss money. But we question
whether this plan, however desirable in aa more advanced stage, would
be advisable at a time when the great wamt is that of labour, and the
chief difficulty is that of retaining laboureers to their engagements.
A subject which has excited great interrest in Sydney is that of the
squatting regulations. Into this we hsave no space to go deeply.
Squatters are those persons (and they aare very numerous) who have
occupied large sheep runs, beyond the located parts of the colony.
These pay a moderate tax to Governmenit, and dissatisfaction has been
created by the proposal to raise it. On the occasion of taking such


unlocafed portions within the colonial limits, the squatters urgently con-
tend for the right of pre-emption, that is, the power of buying the land
at the minimum price. The squatter should certainly be re-imbursed,
at a fair valuation, for all improvements he has made, 'but to give him
the exclusive right of pre-emption in regard to land which he has so
long enjoyed at a very low valuation, seems inflicting an injury on the
public. Moreover, the proposed right to purchase the land at a fixed
price appears faulty, in so far as it makes no discrimination between
the worst land and the best. However, we may refer our readers, on
this debated point, to page 252, &c., of Mr. Hood?s work, where they
will find an opposite view of the question.
It hardly falls within the scope of our present discussion to treat of
the merely political matters of New South Wales; they will be found
canvassed at some lengtli in the work we have just quoted. We will say
a few words only on one point, which is considered a grievance by the-
colonists, and an impediment in the way of their progress, viz., the high
amount of their civil list, which has been fixed at 81,60(W. per annum,
the population, at the time it was framed, being 130,000 souls, of whom.
25,000 were convicts; while in Canada the civil list amounts to but
75,0001, for a population of 3,000,000. The list has been determined
by Act of Parliament, and, as such, is beyond the control of the Legis-
lative Council. The latter body has been newly instituted, and as yet
can only be viewed in the light of an experiment; but hereafter, if it
gives proofs of ability and temperance in discussion (which after the
impetuosity consequent on a recently-acquired privilege has subsided, it
may be expected to do), it is possible that the expenditure in question
may be more subjected to its authority.
We must proceed to give a short view of some of the present statistics
of the colony, whence a notion of its prospects of recovery, and of its
general importance, may be obtained. We cannot understand why Mr.
Hood asserts that New South Wales has great individual wealth, but
no public wealth (p. 357), when in the next page he i - emarks on the
excellence of its climate and its adaptation to the production of market-
able commodities of almost every description. This latter surely con-
stitutes public wealth in the strictest sense, though it may not be yet
fully developed, or its development be checked by private interest or
public interference. Pulblic wealth is but the aggregate of the single
results of individual entesrprise, and this latter will not fail in time to
appropriate every advanttage which is offered by nature. The reason
why Australia repairs hear prostrate energies so much more slowly than
America, under similar circumstances of depression, may be sought
rather in the complexity of the causes of distress existing in the former
case, than in the deficiency of local resources.
ISor can we see any reason why Australia should not become, in time,
a manufacturing country. Tweed is already woven there, of colonial
wool, and dyed with colonial dyes, to a very large extent, and is gene-
rally used for clothing by the settlers; and on the shore opposite New-
castle, on the River Hunter, close to the spacious cloth manufactory
belonging to Dr. Mitchell, a gentleman of the name of Scott has, in
addition to large salt works, which are in full employment, and are not
the only ones in the country, an extensive iron-foundry, &c., where can
be manufactured ail articles in that metal, from the huge boilers re *

quired for the preparation of tallow and! gelatine, to the most delicate

We have already dwelt on the capability of the colony for the
growth of wool, nor is it less adapted pmrhaps for agricultural purposes,
in the many yet unappropriated tracts mf rich land, stretching along its
eastern shores. Much may yet be dbne in improving the general
character of its wool, as the cultivation of this branch of industry has
been chiefly in the hands of persons whose previous habits of life were
not adapted to do it justice, and with whom quantity and the unlimited
multiplication of flocks, for the immediate purposes of a remunerating
sale, were more attended to than quality and judicious management.
On this point and on the agricultural statistics of the colony, much
information will be found in the latter part of Count de Strvelecki?s
work.
The wheat of Australia, if relieved of duty, would, in spite of the
drawbacks attending on heavy freightage and high insurance, form a
profitable article of export to Great Britain. Mines of a rich copper
and lead ore have been discovered in the south, and quicksilver is said
to be common in some parts; while among the instances of colonial
wealth, we must not forget to include the very remarkable fitness of the
country for the growth of the vine, and in which it may hereafter rival
the most favoured regions of France and Germany. Coal of an excellent
quality is found in abundance in the neighbourhood of the Hunter
River; and tobacco grows luxuriantly. With its great range of latitude,
t'ie colony is suited for the production of the articles of tropical
as well as of colder climes, and the growth of sugar, silk, coffee, &c.
might be attempted with success. Its mineral treasures are only now
being developed, and among these we may mention the existence of fine
marble, which is worked in Sydney into mantel-pieces and other
ornaments.
We annex some tables of interesting matter connected with the
colonial ? health and wealth.?

mention this, as they will be found generally to ccorrespond with those in Mr. Braim?s

With reference to the means of internal communication, we find that
the vessels holding a register from the port of Sydney (including
steamers) are in number 272, from 8 to 418 tons burthen, of which 23
are whalers. The steamers are?
Tamar, 130 tons, to Newcastle and Morpeth twice a week.
Rose, 1 Iron boats, of 172 tons each, to Newcastle and Morpeth four times a
Thistle, I week.
Sophia Jane, 153 tons, to Newcastle and Morpeth once a week, to Wollongong
once a week.
Shamrock , 194 tons, iron, for Port Philip and Launceston once a week.
Sovereign, 119 tons, to Moreton Bay every ten or twelve days.
Maitland, to Port Macquarie once a week.
Emu, 44 tons, Comet, 50 tons, Kangaroo, 52 tons, leave for Paramatta three or
four times a day. Another small steamer is to be put on this line.
William the Fourth, 53 tons, to Clarence River twice a month.
Waterman, 12 tons, 1 To the north shore, opposite Sydney, every quarter of am
Ferry Queen, small, J hour.
We may here mention that steamers are built in New South Wales,
and the whole of their machinery made in the country.
We have not spoken of the picturesque scenery which surrounds the
southern metropolis. All books and all travellers concur in celebrating
its praises. Its noble harbour, where vessels of large tonnage can
anchor in contact with the shore; the bays and wooded islands, which
diversify its rippling waters; the botanical garden and government
domain sloping down to the ocean?s edge, with the villa-crowned hill of
Wooloomooloo in the distance, form a scene of unsurpassed natural
beauty, while elegant and capacious shops of every description, the
introduction of gas, and presence of the red-coated postman, attest the
progress of artificial life.


The foregoing statements will convey some idea of the general
condition and resources of the colony. It will plainly appear that it
possesses great elements of wealth, which will be developed hereafter
when matters recover from the sudden and severe depression resulting
from the various causes we have endeavoured to enumerate. The
reaction of distress was the more violent, in proportion to the full and
unchecked tide of prosperity which was flowing through the land. It is
the duty and should be the pleasure of the mother-country to lend a
hand in raising up her fallen offspring, an offspring on whom nature has
lavished vast capabilities of wealth, splendid harbours, and an impor-
tant geographical position. There is great individual opulence still
existing in the colony, but lying idle from the want of confidence in the
security of investments. Property has in most instances only changed
hands, and though it has suffered in the exchange, both from the act of
transfer and from having fallen into the possession of less capable
managers (and so far the injury is a public one), there is much yet
remaining in the country, and we trust more will flow into it, which will
in some shape or other become food for future exertion and enterprise.
We now take our leave of the great continent of the other hemisphere,
with the sincere wish that it may repair its disasters and renovate its
strength. It has gone through a fierce and fiery ordeal, and the storms
of cafamity will, we trust, have purified its moral atmosphere. Of late
we have seen the flames and the ashes only?the Phoenix is yet to arise
with wealth, and w'e hope wisdom, on its wings ; and we anticipate that,
if not ourselves, yet our children?s children will see the day when
Australia shall take her place among the nations of the world, the
entrepot of the isles of the East?the Queen of the Southern Ocean.
A TALE OF THE SEA.
(Continued from No. 211, page 188.)
It was remarkable that on no other part of the island, on that side,
could a landing have been effected. The beach was everywhere preci-
pitous, and its approach guarded by the most rugged rocks, against
which the sea dashed at all times with fearful violence. Ihe peak,
whose base they guarded, frowned above them with stem and imposing
solemnity. Severn! spars and planks from the shattered ship had
already been cast ashore. These were carefully collected by the ciew,
and removed higher up the land to a place of greater security. About
a furlong above the base of the hill, which was immediately explored,
we discovered a small plain, covered with sand, and almost entirely
encircled by a high rocky harrier. In several places there were deep
indentations between the rocks, large enough to shelter several peisons
from the weather. We were all soaked to the skin, and the only mode
we could now adopt to dry ourselves was to wring out our clothes, and
walk to and fro as fast as our already wearied frames would permit.
For this purpose we retired behind the projections of the rocky wall by
which we were surrounded, and having relieved our clothes fiom as
much salt water as our strength would permit us to squeeze from them,
we began walking, with all the vigour we could command, along the
sandy plain which we had fixed upon for our future dwelling, until it


should please God to rescue us from our direary prison, and restore us
to the home we had so recently quitted.
As the atmosphere was warm, and for thie last two hours the sun had
been reflected from the sheer sides of tine precipice upon the sand
below, on one side of the plain, our clothes were soon dried, and we now
thought of making some preparation for tthe night. There was still
above an hour to sunset, and some bales of cloth havino- been cast
ashoie, we carefully unpacked them, and laid them out to dry. Some
packets of calico were recovered, and some of the canvass belonging to
the stranded ship. Several of the men?s hammocks, too, were washed
on shore, together with a few chests of French wine, belono-ino- to the
cuddy stores. Some of the sailors visited the wreck, and ?secured
among other things a tinder-box, which being locked in a cupboard
under the forecastle, had fortunately escaped the wet. A cask of salt
beef was likewise recovered, and some flour, though the latter was nearly
saturated with salt water. Everything, however, was now a gain to
persons m our deplorable condition, uncertain how long we should be
able to provide the necessaries of life, upon ?a land not inhabited,?five
hundred leagues from a hospitable shore, and lashed by the merciless
waves of the vast South Atlantic Ocean. A carpenter?s chest was like-
wise lescued from the shattered hull, by the sailors who had ventured to
it in search of anything which might be useful in our present pitiable
emergency. All the canvass that could be found was brought to land
and this, together with some new sail-cloth, which had been thrown upon
one of the rocks within sight of the beach, was secured for the common
benefit.
Evening was by this time drawing on, and it was deemed prudent to
provide a place of repose for the three unhappy ladies, who, though the
greatest sufferers among us, appeared nevertheless to be far the? most
resigned. There happened to be a natural alcove on one side of the
hill of considerable extent; the entrance was lofty but narrow, and
within was a clear area of many feet, so that it formed a capacious
chamber. Into this spacious grotto a quantity of dry sand was thrown,
upon which the three wives of the officers were obliged to make their
bed, the hammocks being so wet, that they could not with safety be yet
applied to such a purpose. A piece of sail-cloth being fixed above the
enhance, and hanging down like the door of a tent, formed a very com-
fortable dwelling under our present disastrous circumstances. As the
night was warm, the crew were satisfied to make their beds upon the
sand, and embrace that sweet visitor sleep in the open air.
A large tent was pitched in the centre of the plain, supported by
some of the spars that had drifted beyond the rocks landward. Some
of the sails served as a covering. It was soon raised, and the space
beneath being carpeted with the most injured portions of the canvass, a
tolerably agreeable place of shelter was secured for the male passengers.
As we had taken no food since morning, a fire was kindled, and some
of the salt beef put on to boil. Cakes were made of the flour, a small
quantity of wine was measured out to each person, and we prepared for
the first night of our involuntary exile.
The appearance of the land upon which \we were cast, presented at
the first view no very cheering prospects for the future. It seemed to
be repulsively sterile, so far as we had been alhle to survey it. We had


yet observed no practicable path to the summit, which, on the side we
had landed, rose Shove our heads with a ruggedness and perpendicularity
truly terrifying. Here and there were thin deposits of mould, evidently
the remains of that decayed vegetation, which springs occasionally out
of stony deposits, and after a while leaves a sandy residuum, sufficient
to foster a few shrubs of the hardiest constitution.
We had not yet explored the peak, but such was the barren prospect
which it now presented, that we could none of us entertain any very
cheering expectations of vegetable supplies, likely to suffice our future
wants. Below the plain which we had selected as our place of refuge,
craggy and scarped rocks rose from the boiling surges, spreading their
foam into the air whence it occasionally fell upon us in a thin saline
mist. Upon these bleak-rugged masses the sea-bird was seen to sit in
stormy solitude, a type of wretchedness amid surrounding desolation.
Here often the unwieldy walrus reclined his huge body in the sun, and
basked in the senseless fruition of mere animal existence, as if peril
were the element in which it alone found enjoyment, and the dirge of
the drowned mariner were the song of its delight. No bird here sent
up its note of gladness to the skies, as a tribute of praise to the Creator
at once of life and of enjoyment.
After a tolerably satisfactory meal under the tent, which had been
erected from part of the ship?s canvass, we all retired for the night; the
ladies to their alcove in the hill-side, the crew to the sand outside
the tent, the Captain, officers, and passengers laying themselves down
within. Our fatigue had been so great and incessant during the
entire day, that I was not long in losing all remembrance of the recent
past in unquiet and feverish dreams, which left me in the morning little
refreshed. My head ached, and I was sick and depressed.
We ail assembled early to breakfast, which was composed, as on the
evening preceding, of salt beef, dough cakes, and wine. When this
had been dispatched, after prayers, which the Captain delivered extem-
poraneously, with considerable solemnity and effect, it was thought
prudent to collect all that might be obtained from the wreck, and any-
thing which the waters might have cast upon the rocks, from which
many useful articles had been already secured. A strong raft was
consequently constructed and launched into the creek, from which we
had landed the previous day. Several of the sailors again visited the
divided hull, and found, to their surprise, that she still held together.
Many bales of cloth were obtained little injured, a small tin case of gun-
powder, and some shot. There were, however, to our great disappoint-
ment, no more provisions : some bedding was recovered, together with
a few cooking utensils; but not much was added to what had been
already secured. Every thing was now laid upon the warm sand to dry,
so that we were enabled to provide tolerably comfortable beds for the
ladies and some of the more sickly of our male companions.
We did not appear to have much cause for rejoicing at our escape,
as we had not a supply of food for more than a few days, and as yet no
feasible prospect had presented itself of increasing our store. Up to
this time, we had seen nothing alive in the place which had afforded us
a temporary retreat from peril; neither, indeed, did any one claim to be
acquainted with the nature of the land upon which we had been cast.
So far as we could judge it was without inhabitants : not an animal had


yet approached us. The sterility of that porrtion of it which we had
hitherto surveyed, was such as to afford litttle promise of vegetable
supplies for our future need. What then wass to be done under pros-
pects so barren and uncheering ? We had been too busily engaged
during the day in making our sumptuary arrangements, to be able to
enter upon a more extended survey of the islaind, of which we had so
unexpectedly taken possession; but our apprehensions were of the
most gloomy description, when we discovereid that we were able to
secure so little provision from the ship, and Iheard no human voice to
welcome our recent escape.
The day passed off anything but cheerfully.. We had, nevertheless,
been wonderfully preserved, and were still in tlhe same hands which had
sustained us amid the perils of the deep and hiad brought us to a place
of safety. That Providence which had already come so opportunely to
our rescue, was able to sustain us upon the Ibarren rock, and to this
Providence some among us, at least, trustted in this sad hour of
extremity. But there were already murmurs; of dissatisfaction heard
among the crew; some of whom did not liesitate to declare that
drowning would have been a quicker and, therefore, a far better death
than lingering starvation. The majority of us, however, congratulated
each other upon our deliverance, and determined to make the best
provision we could for the future, under our present unpromising cir-
cumstances. Our minds being relieved from the immediate terror of
death, we were comparatively cheerful, though the thought of what
might soon be our condition, could not fail occasionally to dash that
cheerfulness with a shadow of darkening apprehension.
Again the gloom of evening was beginning to gather over land and sea.
The sun which had for some time poured its declining beams upon the
gray waters sank behind them bright and unclouded, leaving our little
community to the contemplation of that cheerless uncertainty, fre-
quently far more painful than a positive knowledge of the worst that
can befal. There is a certain collapse of mind, produced after long and
unrelieved expectation, oftentimes much more distressing than that
subjugation and stern repose of spirit, following the subsidence of hope
when the worst is known, and the mind resolutely and calmly made up
to meet it with bold fortitude, if not with pious resignation. None of
us were assured of more than immediate security. We were sensible
thi.'i within a week our bodies might be parching upon the sands
beneath our feet, where we should leave no record of our melancholy
fate for the satisfaction of those by whom the prayer was daily breathed
for our safety and prosperity. Gloomy as our prospect appeared, we

with a brilliancy which I never before remembereed to have beheld, con-
veying to our saddened souls, in a language, mutte indeed but sublimely

rance from the Fountain of Mercy, that the suffering w ? under the
protection of the same God who d stilled the raging of the sea,
