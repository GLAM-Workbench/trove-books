TO
THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF THE
BRAVE BOYS
WHO FOUGHT AND FELL FOR THE
HONOUR OF THE EMPIRE
AND THE GLORY OF
THEIR COUNTRY.


Preface.
A famous Scottish divine resolved to put into his sermons only what
would “both strike and stick.” That admirable rule could not be made
applicable to this history. The scope and purpose of the present volume
rendered it unavoidable that large portions -should be considered to be
“dry,'’ especially by readers in search of the entertaining, rather than the
informing. A more condensed and vivacious record might easily have
been presented to the public, but it appeared to the promoters that the
occasion demanded a more extended and complete narrative. This is the
first time in which these colonies have had the honour of helping the
motherland. More than this, the late war was among the most gigantic
and obstinate struggles to which the Empire has ever been called upon to
set her hand, and never was the patriotism of our country more deeply
stirred. It was, therefore, fitting that a history as full and complete as
possible should be submitted to the people of Tasmania, and that the
sacrifice and service of her people should be permanently recorded with
ungrudging fulness. This history of the Tasmanians in the Transvaal War
modestly aspires to compass this end.
Many of the diaries placed at the disposal of the proprietors seemed so
interesting that it was resolved to reproduce them almost in extenso. Con-
densation has never taken the form of “giving the gist of a paragraph.”
Unfortunately it was found that the matter prepared ran into 800 pages,
hence the chapters had to be pruned with an unsparing hand. This
contingency was not discovered until some fifty pages had been printed, or
further condensation might have been effected in the first two chapters.
As to the task of compilation, it need scarcely be said that every word
had to be transcribed, as the soldiers diaries were written on every
imaginable size of notebook, always in pencil, and often almost obliterated
by dampness or friction, so that the task of transcription was a most tedious
one; but, happily, enlivened by the interest of the things set down.
Though the book has been long delayed, still it has been prepared with
considerable haste, especially when the delays incident to so large a corre-


spondence are taken into account. Hence the proprietors bespeak the
kindly forbearance of their readers, and crave a generous judgment of the
result of their labours here presented. They venture to hope that the
public will appreciate their efforts to give every available fact and report
bearing upon the departure and return of our soldiers, as well as their
doings in South Africa, and that the number and quality of the illustrations
will be an acceptable feature.
The first two chapters on the History of the Transvaal and the causes
leading up to the war were felt to be a fitting introduction to any history
of the war. For the facts the author is under the greatest obligation to
Mr. E. T. Cook’s “Rights and Wrongs of the Transvaal War,” and, in a
lesser degree, to Sir Conan Doyle’s “Great Boer War.”
The promoters are deeply sensible of the obligations under which they
lie to the Press of Tasmania, and especially to the proprietors of the
Launceston “Daily Telegraph" for generously placing a file of that paper at
their disposal. Their thanks are due to the “Mercury” and “Mail” and
the Launceston “Examiner” for permission to use their reports and articles.
Among many other officers and men whose contributions were highly
valued mention may be permitted of Colonel Cameron, Colonel Wallack,
Major Morrisby, Major Lewis, Captain Perceval, Lieutenant Bisdee, V.C..
and Trooper H. H. Lacy.
The author is also indebted to several private persons, who, in some
cases, took great pains in supplying valuable information, and amongst
these mention should be made of Mr. Sale, father of the late Captain Sale,
of Launceston; Mr. Tasman Morrisby, Mr. W. L. Brownell, and Major
Richardson, Commissioner of Police.
In one or two cases the author has included rather severe criticisms of
officers, as the writers seemed to think their turn had come to have their
say. This was done the less reluctantly because the book is emphatically
a soldiers' book, and not in any sense a eulogy of officialism. He ventures
to hope that this will be regarded as not an undue extension of British
freedom of speech.

Chapter I. Kruger’s Characteristics.
THE FIRST FLASH—KRUGER’S DREAM—A UNIQUE PICTURE
—HATRED TO BRITISH—‘THIEVES, MURDERERS,
AND STRANGERS” “THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR”
SIMPLICITY’S REWARD —NO SOCKS JUDICIAL
CAPACITY—KRUGER’S BETE NOIRE—“I NEVER TAKE
SUPPER”—"THE FLYING DUTCHMAN”—A GHASTLY
MONUMENT.
S NO RECORD of the Transvaal War would be complete that
omitted to afford the reader a clear and lucid explanation of the
intricate causes which produced this stupendous effect, we shall
commence by unravelling the complicated web of events which
resulted in the historical Ultimatum of ex-President Kruger,
whose ambition caused his own downfall and ruined his country.
Dark and ominous clouds were gathering on the political horizon in
South Africa in the beginning of October, 1899. The position between the
Transvaal and British Governments was terribly strained owing to the
obstinate attitude of the former, who persisted in demanding from the
Colonial Secretary the impossible condition that they should be regarded as
a Sovereign International State in exchange for a satisfactory settlement of
the momentous questions at issue. This the English Cabinet emphatically
refused to do, as it meant losing all prestige and political influence in South
Africa, and would be equivalent to tearing up the Treaty existing between
the two countries.
The Pretorian political atmosphere was now rapidly becoming over-
charged with electricity, and the threatening storm burst on October io,
when the first flash struck the Colonial Office in London at 6.45 a.m. in the
form of a telegraphic despatch which plainly indicated that President Kruger
had decided upon war. It elicited the following reply from the Honourable
J. Chamberlain, which was forwarded to the Transvaal Executive through
Sir W. Greene, our British Agent at Pretoria, who was simultaneously in-
structed to demand his passports:
“ Her Majesty’s Government have received with great regret the pei-
emptory demands of the Government of the South African Republic.
"You will inform the Government of the South African Republic in
reply, that the conditions demanded by the South African Republic are such
as Her Majesty’s Government deem it impossible to discuss.”


lii forwarding his Ultimatum Oom Paul had played his last trick on the
political card-table—war, or the humiliation of British prestige in South
Africa. The arrogant and peremptory tone in which it was couched showed
a studied disregard of diplomatic courtesy; and charitably viewed could only
be regarded as expressing the sentiments of a Statesman who had lost his
mental equilibrium and fallen from the domain of intellectual politics into
the region of burlesque.
Such was the indulgent criticism of the British Empire and the verdict
of unprejudiced civilised society.
Preparations for the campaign had already started in Pretoria, where
the author of this Ultimatum—which by its audacity had electrified the
political world—is seated on a deck-chair in the verandah of his unpreten-
tious cottage in Church-street, sipping his favourite beverage, coffee, smok-
ing, and nursing an open Bible on his knee. As he watches the military
preparations of the burghers, preparatory to their departure for the front,
his eyes gleam with a suppressed but eager excitement. His great political
dream is about to b> realised and is rapidly assuming a material form. Pie
smiles piously as he fondly pictures himself already recognised as the
divinely chosen autocrat of South Africa.
History furnishes no parallel to the unique political picture of which
Oom Paul Stephanus Kruger forms the central figure as the author of a
war which he dramatically predicted would “stagger humanity!” Although
now advanced in years, his superior stature and powerful physique still mark
him as a man of no ordinary type. That he was a consummate actor, and
one that thoroughly understood his audience, is fully proved by the fact that
he managed to retain office during eighteen years. In the role of simple
patriarchal President he was superb; and his familiar figure seated daily on
the stoep of the Presidency in Pretoria, seeking wisdom in the Songs of
Solomon, was a masterpiece of impersonation.
As even the most trivial actions connected with his private and domestic
life were all carefully regulated with due regard to their effect on his political
reputation, it is somewhat difficult to dissociate the politician and the man.
Cai eless and not over clean in his personal attire, he resembled in this point
his fellow citizens, who felt naturally flattered at this conspicuous tie of
equality with their President, who so well understood that simplicity in
was something with everybody and everything with some. Nothing marked
him as the head of the State, except a much worn green silk sash (his plain
insignia of office) which might often be seen twisted around his neck in lieu
of a comforter.
His affected simplicity in manner and speech, combined with his ostenta-
tious observance of religious duties, gained him an unprecedented popularity
with the ignorant puritanical Boer, and invested him with a halo of sanctit}
in the eyes of the simple-minded burghers, to whom he was literally an
object of hero-worship.
Frequently he usurped the functions of the clergy and preached in the
Hopper Church opposite his own residence. This pious occupation afforded
him an outlet for his superfluous energies. When tired of inditing


despatches to Her Majesty’s Government and framing cables for the New
York papers, he worked up sermons which consisted mainly of diatribes
against Great Britain, and assurances that Heaven was on the side of the
Boer and against the scoundrelly Rooinek. As he held forth to his followers
in words of hot and strong eloquence in the Reformed Church (which situa-
tion our illustration so characteristically portrays), he knew full well that his
beloved burghers were fast learning to regard him not only as their President
but also as their High Priest and Prophet. His deliverances had not yet
reached the minatory stage, but gave every promise of soon touching the
cursing mark. The quoting of Scripture texts is a game at which two can
play; and Mr. Chamberlain’s record as a Sunday School teacher would have
easily,enabled him, if so inclined, to enter the lists with Oom Paul and to
have held his own with facility. But whether in the pulpit or on the platform
Oom Paul was never tired of reminding his countrymen that they were a
Sdivinely chosen and favoured people; and intimated, like Mr. Squeers, “that
if they followed his counsels they’d go straight to Heaven and be asked no
qustions.” As a specimen of his platform oratory, the following extract
from the “Times” is a fair sample:—“ All ye multitude, listen with full atten-
tion, that you may take hold of what I say. God is in our midst. I shall now
address the true burghers who are here to praise God for His almighty
deeds, favouring our entire people in the past days and now also. Yes ! for
you ,also, thieves, murderers, and even strangers. He works in his own
good time, for ye are also of God’s image. Thus I name you all his people.”
Here he paused to allow this charitable inclusion to sink into the hearts of
the frivolous strangers, and then qualified his concession by a word of cau-
tion to his true burghers. “But as for us burghers, it is for us to pay our
vows to the Lord.” The powerful emphasis which he placed on the words
“us burghers” completely chilled the slender hope held out to the “strangers,
thieves, and .murderers,” and left the peculiar and divinely chosen race of
Boers in exclusive possession of the road to Heaven !
Oom Paul’s actions and sentiments were all based on carefully calcu-
lated motives; and even his religious exhortations had their distinct value in
his political programme. As a coiner of political phrases Mr. Kruger was no
novice; and he never exercised his ingenuity in this direction to better
purpose than in putting into currency the term “Uitlander” (outsider). To
the Dutch mind, always so prone to view with contempt all foreigners, the
use of this name carried with it a sense of total exclusion from their own
social and political sphere, and, consequently, marked those to whom it was
applied as a totally inferior race. Its daily use and constant repetition
could, therefore, only serve to enhance the racial animosity and antipathies
already existing between Boer and Briton. And this is exactly what Oom
Paul desired.
Mr. Kruger’s religion had neither place nor toleration for foreigners,
and no room for that higher and nobler humanity which can embrace all
races and all creeds alike. Hatred of the British was in his eyes a cardinal
virtue; and his intense dislike to the Anglo-Saxon race forms the keynote to
the veiled hostility which marked his puzzling and intricate policy. No
3


principle was too sacred for him to violate in the execution of his designs,,
which were based on the Jesuitical maxim “that the end justifies the means.
His counsels in the Executive were powerfully influenced by this unconquer-
able aversion to the British race; and to humiliate them by vexatious and
harassing legislation was an important item in his ambitious policy, which
culminated in the Utopian idea of a federated South Africa—on the United
States principle—of which he was to be supreme head and dictator. To
achieve this aim, and feed his feverish political nightmare, he brought all the
force of his immense personal influence to bear on every class of the
community.
In the pulpit, on the platform, in the Council Chamber, and in the school-
room, the English were held up as objects of general execration; and by a
clever interpretation of texts, which completely hoodwinked his audience, he
pointed them out as the children of darkness, in comparison with whom the
Boers were angels of light. Trading on religion, and using every means
which an unscrupulous ambition suggested, it is not astonishing that racial
animosity was inflamed to a dangerous extent and threatened the political
extinction of the Uitlanders, whose rights and privileges were already
reduced to a purely nominal value, and whose personal liberty was at the
caprice of Kruger’s misguided and malicious policy of exclusion. Oom
Paul in his combined character of High Priest and President was
simply worshipped by the unsophisticated Boer, who regarded his utterances
as the direct result of Divine inspiration.
The amount of treasure which Hr. Kruger may have laid up in Heaven
is an unknown quantity, but ought to be verv considerable: his vast accumu-
lation, however, of worldly goods is beyond all dispute, as it places him in
the foremost rank among Transvaal capitalists. According to a South
African paper, he owns 190 freehold farms in the Transvaal—many on the
main reef. Pie is a large owner of town lands in and around Pretoria and
Johannesburg. He is the largest owner in the Rustenburg district. In the
Netherlands Railway and Dynamite Works and Hatherly Distillery, ex-
President Kruger is the largest shareholder, although his name does not
appear. Mr. Kruger owns a large and valuable estate in Cape Colony; also
one in Holland and one in Germany. He has two million sterling invested
in German consols. He has many minor interests in the Transvaal, amount-
ing to a considerable sum. Before the war of rebellion broke out, Paul
Kruger’s real estate was known by his own household to be worth between
nineteen and twenty millions sterling. These statements should, of course,
be accepted cum grano ; though we are all aware that Oom Paul is an im-
mensely wealthy man. It has been called a capitalists’ war by,our enemies,
but the greatest capitalist concerned in bringing it about was Mr. Kruger,
who stands a chance of being a very heavy loser. History is silent about
Mr. Kruger's charity.
The pomp and ceremony of a court had little or no fascination for this
wily President, who stuck to that primitive simplicity, which had hitherto
stood him in good stead. An amusing instance of this fact is related in the


' • 1
STEPHANUS JOHANNES PAULUS KRUGER.


“South African Review,” when Dr. Leyds tried to introduce that grandeur
which invariably surrounds a potentate.
“On the completion of the Volkraad’s buildings, the Secretary of State
had the old baize-covered tables swept away and introduced Maple’s best.
Spittoons were inaugurated, but kicked aside with contempt. His Honor
was elevated to an elaborately carved throne with a silver and bronze
stamped leather seat. This, however, availed little, as he still sported the
garish green foresterlike sash and his well-known soiled white cotton gloves.
Then came the ambitious state coach, built at a cost of £ISOO, with its solid
silver ornamentation and pale mauve satin upholstery. But although
supplied with a sumptuous green and gold livery to match the sash above
mentioned, he insisted on mounting the gorgeous hammer-cloth in dirty
flannel cricketing trousers, if his inclination took him that way. Nor could
Paulus and his associates be prevented from smoking the black and evil
smelling Boer tobacco, any more than they could be prevailed upon to wear
socks or to desist from expectorating on the cushions.”
Unlike other Presidents of Republics, Oom Paul carefully avoided any
approach to regal magnificence or ceremonial, preferring to maintain that
role of simple patriarchal and pastoral President, which so completely rea-
lised the bucolic Boer's ideal of perfection in a ruler. Yet he was intensely
vain!
Situated in Vanity Fair is a booth labelled the “Autocrat of South
Africa.” Pushing aside the curtain we see disclosed a marble monument
of ex-President Kruger, ordered and paid for by himself. It represents this
ambitious and unscrupulous Statesman in his usual top-hat and coat, and is
the result of two years’ labour by a Boer artist in Rome. Modesty blushes
to own that it was also unveiled by himself in the year 1898. In the back
ground is a coffin. This gorgeous receptacle is ready for his use when
required, and cost, with its delicately perfumed satin lining,, edged with lace,
and its solid silver ornaments, nothing short of £IOO sterling. Such dainty
and costly trifles as these are pretty strong indications of that egregious
vanity against which the Psalmist so strongly warns the true believer.
Probably Oom Paul missed that chapter !
In ,a judicial capacity, he was by no means wanting either in acumen,
discrimination or commonsense, as the following incident clearly proves ;
Two Boer brothers jointly inherited a farm, left them by their father,
in which they were each to have an equal share. They were, however,
unable to agree as to its division, and after a lengthened dispute, in which
neither would cede to the other's demand, they mutually agreed to refer their
case to President Kruger for arbitration.
After carefully listening to the arguments on either side and deliberating
for a few minutes, he delivered the following laconic but astute decision: —-
Turning to the elder of the brothers he exclaimed, “You being the senior
can divide the property into two halves;” and to the younger remarked,,
“and you being the junior can have the choice of the two halves.” Had he
but have accorded half as much justice in his dealings with the ITitlanders,
there would have been no necessity for the Transvaal War!


Mr. Kruger s faith in the Almighty was openly and frequently professed
by him ; but as his actions were not consistent with its words, its genuine-
ness is open to serious doubt. “He believed in God, but kept his powder
dry, and frequently referred to his favourite maxim, which was the Maxim
gun. But his faith in the “Almighty dollar’" was incontestable; and the fact
of his having safely secured his own few paltry millions, after having socially
and financially ruined the credulous Boers, is sufficient to stamp him as an
ardent worshipper of Mammon. His patriotism was as spurious as his
religion, and evaporated with the first indication of danger. The belief he
professed and preached so often, concerning the Divine destiny of his race,
failed to inspire him with courage at the critical moment; and as soon as
personal danger threatened him, he wisely concluded that absence of body
would under the circumstances best demonstrate his presence of mind.
The transparent nature of his excuses for immediate departure failed to
deceive even his best friends; as the pretence of obtaining European inter-
vention on behalf of his unfortunate countrymen was well known to be
utterly futile, and could not possibly, therefore, be legitimately regarded as
a justification for such a step. Yet this was his ostensible mission; and
thus now for the first time destiny forced him to show himself in his true
colours.
As soon as the Honourable J. Chamberlain took up his position as
Colonial Secretary, Oom Paul found that his diplomatic misrepresentations
and subterfuges were detected with unerring accuracy by a masterhand; and
that this energetic and capable Statesman would prove a veritable bete noir
if he persisted in carrying out his anti-British policy. With his usual
urbanity and regard for truth, he designated him as the Arch-fiend and
destroyer of political freedom and progress in South Africa, in addition to
several other equally flattering titles.
In him, however, Mr. Kruger was reluctantly forced to recognise—
although he sedulously avoided admitting the fact—that he was overmatched
by that keen sagacity which refused to be duped by the ambiguous and
mendacious assurances of the Transvaal Government; whose Parliamentary
measures for redressing the Uitlanders’ grievances took back with one
hand what they offered with the other. Mr. Chamberlain’s firm but cour-
teous attitude in demanding a tangible basis on which to negotiate, instead
of the shadowy ana vague proposals made by Mr. Kruger for the purpose of
gaining time, sent the political temperature of the latter up to fever heat.
One of Oom Paul's chief hopes of scoring a diplomatic victory, lay in the
cherished idea that a change of Government in England might result in a
change in her colonial policy. But in this respect he was doomed to
disappointment.
It was while seated at his desk in his private room in the Colonial Office
in London that the Honourable Joseph Chamberlain made his most
important and decisive move on the political chess-board in South Africa,
which was destined so effectively to checkmate Oom Paul and arrest for
ever his fanatical policy of oppression towards the Anglo-Saxon race in the
Transvaal.


In his now famous and historical reply to the most startling and
audacious Ultimatum known to Modern History, the Colonial Secretary
wrote the celebrated laconic and decisive paragraph with which his despatch
concludes, in the words which appear at the foot of his portrait. Its
emphatic tone, combined with its brief and perspicuous style, left no possible
opening for misinterpretation; while it at the same time upheld the dignity
and honour of the British Empire. The sting for Mr. Kruger lay in its tail,
which in one sharp and decisive phrase shattered all his hopes of ever
achieving diplomatically the object of his ambition—in essaying which he
had already wasted reams of paper in inditing his exhaustive and volumin-
ous despatches to Mr. Chamberlain. Had any single one of these docu-
ments borne the genuine impress of honesty and singleness of purpose, the
calamity of war might have been easily averted; but Oom Paul held the
political sagacity of England's leading Statesman just as cheaplv as he did
the resources of the British Empire, and thought himself sufficiently astute
to hoodwink the British Cabinet with the ambiguous phraseology which
marked his political chicanery. A long and devastating war has proved
the fallacy of his judgment.
It would be impossible to find a stronger contrast between any two
Statesmen in modern times, than that which existed between President
Kruger and the Honourable Jos. Chamberlain. Each was destined to play
an important role on the world's stage of international politics ; and each will
leave behind him an imperishable name in connection with the struggle for
supremacy in South Africa. But here the one similarity of their career
begins and ends. The record of the former will aptly illustrate the tragic
truth that “the evil that men do lives after themand his name will be for
ever associated with the opprobrium and obloquy which rests on the name
of a traitor to his cause and country; whereas the latter will be handed down
to an enthusiastic and admiring posterity as one of the most patriotic,
brilliant, and far-seeing Statesman of his age, who devoted his rare
intellectual powers and dominating force of character to the consolidation of
Great and Greater Britain, and to the welfare of the race in whose destinies
he had such implicit faith.
To the student of contemporary history, the past and present career
of this illustrious Statesman contains elements of the deepest interest. Like
all truly great public men, his views, thoughts, and actions are always in
harmony with the march and progress of events, and undergo modification
with the ever-changing perspective, resulting from the process of evolution
in the political world. The most prominent figure in the House of Com-
mons to-day, and one who towers above all his colleagues as the champion
of Imperial unity, is the Honourable J. Chamberlain, M.P., whose reputation
has already reached the high-water mark of fame. The story of his career is
the story of the growth, change, and development necessary to one destined
to become the creator of national influences. Steady and sound in his per-
ceptions, he thoroughly understands human nature and its need of “spurs”
and rewards in the unavoidable struggle of life. He recognises the truth
of the saying that “you cannot alter the value of the cards by re-shufflng the

RIGHT HON. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, M.P.


pack." And he has grown with his ambition. In a comprehensive ar-
ticle on this subject, the “United Australia" says : —“No one who remembers
the subordinate level at which the Colonial Office stood when it was placed
under his Ministerial charge can fail to recognise that he has practically re-
designed, if not actually rebuilt, the British Empire. To-day the colonies,
instead of being regarded as a sort of necklace of subordinate possessions to
the mother country, have come to be regarded as a phalanx of bulwarks or
buttresses to the Empire—a world-encircling belt of allies, who are ready
at any time to spring pantherlike to the assistance of their motherland.
The material for great transformation has been there irrespective of Mr.
Chamberlain, but he has seen it and utilised it, and is endeavouring to cry-
stalise it into a solid and compact nucleus, thus realising the truth of his
favourite motto, ‘Unity is strength.’ ” His strong and deep-seated belief
that the “proper study of mankind is man” animated him in devoting no
small amount of his time in studying and mastering the past and present
history of South Africa; and in 1880 these studies had already begun to bear
fruit. His attacks, consequently, upon the Government with reference to
the Zulu War, did not follow in the line of the blind onslaught of his
colleagues, but criticised fairly their shuffling and hesitating policy, Mr.
Chamberlain's position as a Cabinet Minister almost forced him to give
public utterance to some special pleadings on behalf of the Government’s
attitude towards the Transvaal in 1880 and 1884; but no one became more
keen than he in enforcing the prescribed limits of the Boer territory and
preventing encroachments on Bechuanaland.
Still, had not his horizon been enlarged by other influences, Mr.
Chamberlain as the defender of the Suzerain would have been far to seek.
So early as 1884 he is known to have had hankerings after the post or
Colonial Secretary. The question of Home Rule gave definite root to his
conviction that Imperial unity must be maintained at all costs. This idea,_
once so subordinate in his mind, now took precedence of all. It became
indeed what we might call the synoptic idea, and every other part of his
political attitude was coloured by his Imperialism. The ex-Mayor of
Birmingham began to realise that he was a citizen of an Empire, and when,
after ten years, his chance at last came round, he entered on the duties of
Colonial Secretary with a breadth of view and wholeness of purpose that
entitled him to be called a Statesman, and not merely a politician. Not
that the qualities which had made him so successful a Mayor had entirely
disappeared. Nature makes no leaps. The spirit which had induced him
to advance ten thousand pounds for a city’s improvement had also moved
him to put some of his money in the Royal Niger Company, and would move
him to any similar speculation to-day. But the parochial narrowness of his
early views quickly disappeared under the inspiring and leavening idea of
Imperialism, and when circumstances forced him once more to turn his
attention to the Transvaal, he was in no mood to shuffle or hesitate.
Perhaps he has come to realise that the safety of our dependencies in
the Far East depends on our supremacy in South Africa, or perhaps this
wider horizon has yet to come. Anyhow one thing is sure, that we have


in our Colonial Secretary a man really qualified to be entrusted with the
cares of the State, one whose mind seems to mellow only into broader and
more comprehensive vigour, and not to harden in a given groove. The
fear which he inspires in Continental diplomatists is a just fear. They know
that in him they have to face no demagogue or mob-orator, but a man deeply
imbued with a belief in his own race.
The history of the world, says Carlyle, is told in the lives of great
men. They are the mountain peaks from which the most forceful influences
radiate to the lower levels of the work-a-day world, and give direction to
the energies and the aspirations of the rank and file of humanity. They are
human and yet superhuman, in varying measure, for they work on a higher
plane than their fellow-men; and the sphere of their influence —be it greater
or less —is determined by their varying altitude of mind over that of the
millions around them.
The influence of great men is not invariably for the ultimate good of
those over whom they exercise it, and the last and truest test of their value
to the world lies in retrospect, where the acts of to-day and of yesterday
can be seen, reduced to the more compact compass of history, and freed
from the medium of class and party prejudice, through which current events
seem ever and inevitably deflected.
Inscribed on the world’s roll of honour, amongst its great and famous
men, is the name of the Honourable Joseph Chamberlain, whose humani-
tarian policy towards the African natives, as well as his broad and liberal
treatment of all nationalities, contained in its cosmopolitan population,
cannot fail to secure the victories and benefits which strew the paths of peace
under a just and enlightened administration.
The policy of “live and let live'’ which governs the rule in South Africa
has already produced the happiest results; for where the Union Jack flies,
slavery and oppression have no foothold. During the Kruger regime the
unfortunate natives were literally crushed under the iron heel of a relentless
despotism, and the Uitlanders reduced to a position of abject and humiliating
political servitude. It was also conspicuously marked by a total disregard
of the grave and important responsibilities vested in him as leader of the
South African Republic. With philanthropy, Oom Paul had in reality only
a bowing acquaintance; although, according to his professions, he repre-
sented an incarnation of all the Christian virtues. 1 lis powers of dissimula-
tion could hardly have been surpassed; but were not profound enough to
deceive Mr. Chamberlain. But the scene is changed ; and the glorious
charter of freedom for all alike has succeeded the bigoted tyranny, oppres-
sion, and corruption of the Transvaal oligarchy. For the teeming millions in
South Africa it means safety and prosperity; it means the defence of their
rights and privileges against foreign control or conquest, combined with
progress in those arts and sciences which are indispensable to the develop-
ment and growth of a nation. The scene-shifter was Mr. Chamberlain.
Prominent amongst the different traits in Oom Paul’s character was
his ungovernable and insensate ambition, which led him blindly onwards to


risk everything on one throw of the dice with a gambler’s infatuation. The
lives and homes of his beloved burghers were all cheerfully staked on the one
slender chance of defeating the richest and most powerful nation in the
world. In justification of his suicidal policy, he carefully instilled into the
Boer mind that England would inevitably be hampered by embarrassing
complications with other Powers; and to corroborate this statement caused
bogus cablegrams to be circulated and printed, announcing that “a rebellion
had broken out in Ireland, and that France and Russia had declared war
against Great Britain.” These deliberate and misleading fabrications were
followed up by the pious and reassuring announcement that the Boers would
enjoy the monopoly and assistance of that special Providence which
watches over the elect of this world. Duped on all sides, but unconscious
of the deception, they were naturally elated with the hopes of a speed}'
victory, and sallied forth like the Crusaders of old against the infidels or
TJitlanders, whom their ecclesiastical President so charitably alluded to in
his sermons under the heading of “thieves, murderers and strangers.” What
ever harm might befall the Republic, Oom Paul took every human precau-
tion that no harm should befall him. Day and night, with full steam up,
a special train awaited the orders of this “flying Dutchman” to convey him
at express speed to the coast, where a Dutch man-of-war was in readiness to
carry him to Holland.
Such was the picture the deluded and misguided Boers gazed on with
surprise and stupefaction, as they saw their idol flap his wings and prepare
for an ignominious flight. Leaning back amidst the luxurious surround-
ings of a first-class European residence was far more to Mr. Kruger’s taste
than listening to the death shrieks of his countrymen, whom his criminal
ambition and monumental folly had so rashly plunged into the horrors of
war.
“Conscience doth make cowards of us all” is a truth exemplified in Oom
Paul’s feverish anxiety to escape contact with the calamities and dangers
with which he and his equally culpable advisers had overwhelmed their
country. Spectrelike these stern realities now rose up and invoked ven-
geance on the head of this fugitive President, who was hastening to place
the broad ocean between himself and the country which he had deluged with
innocent blood. His attitude on this occasion is admirably described in a
poetical contribution to “Black and White,” which paints him as he stood
revealed to the keen and impartial eye of Truth.
A grim, ungainly, grey and downcast Oom,
Sat on a kopje in the gathering gloom.
He pruned his wing, this fowl of dingy feather,
And peered down South, and didn’t like the weather.
Murk were the thunder-clouds that rolled about
The pathway red of battle; loud the shout
And shrill the scream of slowly dying men.


Oom lit his pipe, and long he pondered; then
His mu sings were shattered, and a Voice
Louder by far than distant battle noise,
I hundered upon the ancient Boer’s head,
And rolled back messages of fear and dread.
“O elderly and much misguided fool,”
It cried; “O foolish, futile tool
“Of cunning workmen, sure the devils laugh
“do watch so old a bird thus caught with chaff.
“Dost thou not see, thou and thy Joubert too
“How hated schemers played their game with you?
“Dost thou not now begin to understand
“How Jack-a-Lantern Leyds, and all his band,
“Have used thee as the monkey used the cat,
“To get the chestnuts off the fire? Whereat
“The other beasts but laughed. Too late, old man.
“You mourn the madness yesterday began.
“T on cl have South Africa your oyster; well,
“You've only split your nails upon the shell.
“The past is past, and Nemesis now comes
“To punish this your folly in your homes.
“You've sacrificed your country for a dream
“And out of all the darkness scarce a beam
“Of hope is shining from your point of view.
“In British furnace you’ll be cast anew:
“A painful process. May you still survive
“And come out cleansed and purified, and thrive.
“A sea-deep ignorance has been your curse
“Since the ‘Great Trek,’ and now, from bad to worse
“You and your wretched nation slowly sink
“Till all South Africa begins to stink
“With your insensate barbarism. You
“Listened to lying voices, though yon knew
“Within your secret heart, these paltry elves
“Were representing nothing but themselves :
“ ’Tis not O’Brien nor the men now sent
“By Erin to our British Parliament
“That voice their country. Each has his axe to grind,
“And their theatric fustian, as you find,
“Is all outspouted with the usual view
“To foment passion here, not to help you.
“Leave such as these to fight with their own fears,
“Forget them. ’Tis the Dublin Fusiliers
“Represent Ireland’s gallant heart. Nor, Oom,
“Should you have fancied there was any room
“For two opinions or another word
“Of inner strife when once from sheath our sword


"is fairly drawn. Twas Nottingham s prime joy,
“Their Merry Andrew, first began to buoy
“Your ardent hopes, because you vainly thought
“Our Lab. was not a figure-head of nought,
“Prattling his airy nothings half in joke
“Through puffs from little cigarettes; whose smoke
“is not more evanescent in its end
“Than any earnestness your cynic friend
“Pretends to. Party is his paltry whim,
“Pie’s served his party better than it, him.
“The brand of Truth you'll get from Labouchere
“Won't, and by now you doubtless know it, wear.
“Such voices thinly scattered on our soil
“Are crackling thorns beneath the pot; they boil
“The kettle of a nation's righteous wrath:
“From which there now results a dish of broth
“Such as, my Com, you’ve never drunk before.
“Well may you scan the South; well may you pore
“On the dire chronicles of agony
“Sung by each sulphur-laden wind that by
“Drearily passes. This is the grim fate
“Of those who give a greedy ear to prate
“Of lying voices. Steward false and fell
“\ou've led your trusting nation into hell
“Of war. Alas, those voices oversea!
“But now you will have leisure mournfully
“To speculate upon their worth. Farewell,
“Already on the air I feel a knell
“That tolls the death of all your evil ways.”
Thus far the \ oice; then Oom in some amaze
Found 'twas his Conscience that had spoke to him
Like some indignant, deep-tongued seraphim.
He rose, and glanced to West and East and South :
Through the dim smoke a fire-tipped cannon's mouth
Belched sudden death ! The prospect soon grew gorier ;
Whereupon Oom returned him to Pretoria.
His fear of personal injury, together with the possibility of being taken
prisoner, acted on him with galvanic force, and hastened his preparations for
departure. The anxieties inseparable from great wealth weighed heavily
on his mind and formed an additional incentive to carry out his insurance
policy for Number One without loss of time. Amongst the thousand and
one apprehensions that assailed this timorous and flying President, there
was one of a decidedly comic nature, which sent a cold shiver through Oom
Paul’s moral and physical system. It related to the proposed despatch of
an Australian contingent —a probability which filled him with a vague sense
of alarm, owing to his ignorance concerning the inhabitants of distant


countries. ihe dialogue which took place in reference to the Australians
is thus reported in the “Eleventh Australian Tour”:—
When it was announced that Australia was going to send a contingent
to the war in South Africa, Kruger called on General Joubert and said to
him:—T see that some people called Australians are coming over; do you
know anything about them ?” “I don’t know much about them,” replied
Joubert, ‘but I am told on good authority that eleven of them beat ail
England a year or two ago, so they must be a pretty good lot.’ ‘Heavens,’
said Kruger, ‘and they say that five thousand of them arc coming here !’ ”
The ex-President has no doubt since come to the conclusion that the
Australians who visited South Africa came fully up to expectation.
Nothing was more acceptable to Mr. Kruger at this critical juncture
of affairs tnan any expressions of foreign sympathy for the Boer cause; and
his eagerness to welcome any evidence of this kind, without verifying its
authenticity or questioning its genuineness, led him to swallow at one gulp
an American illuminated address of sympathy containing 25,000 signatures,
dhis little burlesque was cleverly prepared by an enterprising Yankee
journal; and the address was presented by their messenger-boy (Smith), a
very smart specimen of young America carefully got up for the occasion.
He was formally introduced by Air. H. R. Davis, the editor, whose real
motive was, of course, to gain notoriety, and the powerful advertisement
which such a unique occasion offered. Quite unconscious of the fact that
not one-tenth of the people who had signed this address of condolence
knew where the Transvaal was situated, Air. Kruger received the deputation
with the most serious and profound smile of approbation and gratitude,
and in ponderous periods expressed his uetermination to “fight to the
bitter end.” He warmly congratulated this precocious youth on the noble
mission he had undertaken, and begged him to convey the united thanks
■of himself and the Boer nation to their sister Republic—America.”
Airs. Kruger, the patient and meek sharer of Oom Paul’s joys and
sorrows, rejoiced greatly over this pro-Boer expression of American sym-
pathy, blissfully ignorant of the fact that it was in reality nothing but a
monster international advertisement for a cute Transatlantic paper. From
the commencement of the war she evinced the keenest interest in its pro-
gress, and could frequently be seen on the stoep of the Presidency listening
with rapt attention, while her granddaughter read the latest news from
the front. Any capture or reverse to the “verdomde rooibatsjes” would
cause the old lady’s eyes to sparkle with animation and delight. The
spouse of the greatest “Ultimatumer” of the age is by no means a remark
able woman, save in the number of her descendants, who are almost too
numerous to count. Tante Kruger, as she is familiarly called by the
Boers, is just the stamp of wife for her husband—quiet, plodding, with
practically no interests outside her family—in fact, a typical halts vrou.
Through sunshine and storm she has stood by the President, ever ready to
encourage him in his ambitious schemes, or to do his bidding in the
humblest ways ; but never to command him, for she is of a past generation,


and lives in blissful ignorance of the New Woman, whose craze is always
that she may take the initiative, whether to make or mar. To such as she,.,
man is a creature of a superior order; and her view of woman’s highest
achievement is to recognise her position and delight in playing second
fiddle. Such wives are often the best leaders men can have, for they
never hinder a husband by putting him into two minds over a contemplated
step, through offering him advice as voluminous as it is irrelevant. In his
married life Oom Paul had no hindrance to the development of his schemes
and aspirations to sole power. She was certainly too good to be left
behind to die.
It is a significant fact, that amongst the intelligent classes in Holland.
at this period, the prevailing opinion with regard to the War and their
hope of rendering assistance was tempered both with moderation and
common sense; and as such was highly characteristic of the Dutch race.
The general idea prevalent was that the war was the result of intrigues
into which England had been forcibly drawn; that the Boers ought to have
made more reasonable concessions; and that without the gold mines no
casus belli would have arisen. A well-educated Dutchman, and one
whose experience was enlarged by extensive travel, expressed his country’s
sentiment on this question with pathetic force while seated in a cafe window
overlooking one of Amsterdam’s numerous canals. ‘‘We feel the blows as
though they were falling upon us; our sympathies are with the people, who
are our own flesh and blood, but we can do nothing. Don Quixote tilted
against the windmills. He was mad; we are a peaceful people not given
to heroics." There was very little talk of any active hostility to England,
with the exception of a few warlike utterances inspired by the impetuosity
and immatured judgment of the younger and more impulsive element.
However, the intellectual and phlegmatic Dutchmen did not expect that
England would prove merciless in victory; nor did they believe that Dutch
rule in Pretoria was free from grave and far-reaching corruption. They
indulged in no prognostications of ultimate success for the Transvaal: and
save for the slaughter and misery involved, their regrets would not have
been of a particularly serious nature. The Dutch seem to take their mood
from their cities. Those who know the country and its people were
not surprised at their manner of receiving the war news. They are a
people who, as a rule, say less than they think; and if they cherish regrets
do not cherish delusions. When a suggestion was made that England was
acting in vindication of national morality, reference was sometimes made
to the heroic efforts of Dr. Jameson three years ago to save English women
and children in Johannesburg from horrors unnameable. A deeply-read
student in politics thus summed up the situation, “Without Germany’s neu-
trality there would have been armed intervention. Diplomacy would have
ordered its mourning coach against Paul Kruger’s burial day, and active
work would have commenced round the grave of the President. As it is,
we have the famous policy of ‘Do ut des.' Germany will be neutral in the
Transvaal, and England will be neutral in Asia Minor. The New Eastern
problem has been anticipated, and what England wants in the matter of


Cape to Cairo will be granted in return for her quiescence when Abdul
Hamid brings his reign to a close. The Transvaal is the pawn on the
International Chess Board, in which Germany has ceded her interest.’’
Holland was undoubtedly influenced by the best thought of England,
France, and Germany. Movements that make for peace and progress find
sympathetic supporters in a country whose national life is singularly whole-
some and free from vice. Had the Transvaal been a Dutch Colony, in-
stead of an Independent Republic, it is more than probable that Holland’s
little army of sixty or seventy thousand men, and her fleet, numebring one
hundred vessels of war, would have faced the inevitable with the utmost
nonchalence, but the condition of affairs aroused the feeling, but limited
its expression and scope. Many hoped that the war would be short and
non-productive of European complications. A success for the Transvaal
was dreaded, as it was known that it would be merely ephemeral, and only
tend to increase the total cost in human life. As far as Holland was con-
cerned the effects of the war fell most heavily on the Jews, who almost
monopolise the Diamond-cutting industry. In fact, the trade in diamonds
is almost exclusively in the hands of the Chosen People; and the cessation
of output from Kimberley deprived these skilled workmen of their occu-
pation—hence the trouble in the picturesque Jewish Quarter in Amster-
dam, situated in the well-known Zwanenburgerstraat, the Achter Graacht,
and the long narrow Judenbreet-straat, with its fine old synagogue and his-
toric houses, where Baruch Spinoza was born, and where Rembrandt lived
20 years ago.
In these parts the Boers had a dangerous class of allies, consisting of
rumour-mongers, who were constantly spreading false tidings of British
reverses, and stating that England was encouraging the Basutos to take up
arms; and suggesting foreign coalitions against Great Britain; and in fact
intensifying party feelings in every possible manner. The headquarters
—the fons et origo novi, was in Brussels. The keen-witted, though phleg-
matic Dutchman did not require to be told that half the published state-
ments were false ; and that the rest could only be accepted with considerable
reservations. At the recent Peace Conference at the Hague it was clearly
laid down that friendly offers of intervention were not to be regarded as
an offence. This rule is excellent in theory, but the peace-maker who
applies it practically is liable to meet with only a luke-warm reception. In
balancing the pros, and cons, of the intervention question, one speaker re-
marked, “It should do us no harm ; can it do much good ? Besides, is the
path of a victorious nation to be blocked by a peaceful intervention?” The
Dutch are not lacking in humour.
The temperate views and opinions current amongst intelligent poli-
ticians in Plolland formed a striking contrast to the tone adopted generally
by Continental journalists, who vied with one another in wilfully mis-
representing facts and distorting truths, to say nothing of their puerile and
frantic expressions of joy whenever a reverse occurred to the British arms.
England learnt many valuable lessons through the Boer war. Nations
whom she had hitherto regarded as friendly Powers, and who were bound


by strong ties of gratitude for valuable services rendered them in the past,
were the very ones who occupied the vanguard in this senseless and
venomous attack on the actions and policy of Great Britain in South Africa.
It incontestably proved that a dormant jealousy and hatred to the Anglo-
Saxon race, with their vast possessions in every quarter of the globe, had
long existed in Europe, and only awaited so unique an opportunity to dis-
play itself through the medium of the press. T his it did in a spirit of
bitter animosity, degraded by a deliberate perversion of facts, which had
been rarely equalled and never surpassed in the records of journalism.
Transvaal gold, in the shape of bribes lavishly bestowed on a large number
of leading papers by Dr. Leyds (formerly Secretary of State of the South
African Republic) helped to intensify the malevolence of a press which was
as venal as it was unjust. England’s habitual apathy and disregard for
foreign opinion was changed into natural indignation at this general chorus
of execration, which, however, only served to brace her energies for greater
efforts in her African campaign. Dr. Leyds, who left in the early part of
the war for Europe, for the purpose of trying to obtain European interven-
tion (though without success) received through the “Black and White” cor-
respondent column, the following characteristic and amusing epistle from
Oom Paul; —
“My dear Brother, —
I fear that I must remind you that you have spent a great deal
of money, and so far shown us singularly small results. Gross caricatures
of the Queen of England are very much to my taste personally, and I was
glad to have the fall of Ladysmith announced from time to time; but one
wants more than that just now. In fact, we are about ready for European
intervention, and there does not seem to be any coming along. What
have you been doing now? You have travelled about a good deal from
one capital to another, and I hope you have kept the expenses of this as
low as possible. You know how particular I have been on the question of
travelling expenses. Considering that we are a simple race of peasant
farmers, I should think it would have a good effect if you had always
travelled third. And I would gladly have lent you my best frock-coat as
additional evidence that we are a rustic, coffee-drinking people, and do not
care about appearances. But it is too late to speak of that. The money
is spent, and there seems little to show. What on earth is the use of going
to see Emperors unless you do really see them? You ought to have got fn
somehow, and lam disappointed. I saw a photograph of you in the
papers the other day, and I did not like that either. You were got up
regardless of expense as the diplomat of fiction; it would have been much
better if you had pulled out the simple-burgher stop. And your quotations
from the Psalms of David are much fewer than they should be.
Between ourselves, I fear you will not make much of the peace party
in England, but you can try. Extol the courage and victories of the
British; avoid mentioning Majuba; say we want nothing but our inde-
pendence. If necessary, say we want even less than that, as long as you


gain time. Negotiations are a grand thing, and I owe much to them.
But the trouble is there is no peace party worth mentioning. O, why was
I ever led into this at all!
Yours in depression,
Paul Kruger.”
History furnishes no record as to the effect produced on the voluptuous
Leyds by this Krugerian effusion. There is little doubt but that in reading
between the lines he easily discerned Mr. Kruger’s restless impatience to
join him in his useless and luxurious Continental lour, where he would be
safe from the din and danger of the battlefield.
The next communication addressed to the übiquitous ex-Secretary of
State is a choice specimen of Gallic sentiment, with its usual dash of the
melodramatic. This sort of thing is supplied to order by several accom-
modating editors in La Belle France at so much per column.
[TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH.]
Most Dear and Honoured Comrade, —
It is with a thousand regrets that I hear that you now
turn your attention to the peace party in England. Still a little courage,
and great things may arrange themselves in France. Already you have
the noble enthusiasm. Only the tears and caresses of my wife prevented
me from placing my sword at your disposition. Perhaps, though, in my
journal I can render you still grander service. If you would drive those
cowardly English pigs into the sea, trust to France. If sarcasm can do it,
it will be done. I trust that it is not in despair of foreign intervention that
you have omitted to send to the office of my journal the customary
honorarium for announcing for the sixth time the fall of Ladysmith. It
would be welcome, and prevent ill-feeling and dissensions among the pro-
prietors, who regard you and your countrymen as brothers deserving their
warmest sympathy in your gallant struggle against British tyranny and
rapacity. 'Town with the Union Jack!
Accept, Sir, the sentiments, the most loyal, large, and profound, of
Yours devotedly,
The Editor "Petit Journal.”
This genuine and disinterested document is followed by a diplomatic
offer from an English pro-Boer journalist, whose impartial and lofty
enthusiasm for the Boer cause emanated from that never-failing and noble
source of inspiration —love of money.
My Dear Mr. Leyds,—
Though a stranger to you, I feel myself compelled at
this juncture to address you. I have read with tears—l am not ashamed
to say ft in my eyes of the noble efforts you are making in the cause of
peace. I understand through the medium of the daily press that, weary
KRUGER'S CHARACTERISTICS.


of the pretentious but hollow sympathy of the Continent, you are now
intending to turn your attention to England itself. Sir, you are right.
There are those here who sympathise with you. Petitions should be
prepared and the press should be influenced. But to do this you will
require the assistance of one who, like myself, has had experience of the
less prominent walks of life here. With a judicious expenditure of secret
service money, I think I should have no difficulty in arranging for the
British to clear out of South Africa at once, pay a handsome indemnity,
and apologise to Mr. Kruger.
In the meantime, I find myself somewhat embarrassed in the work that I
am undertaking in your behalf, by the fact that I am being pressed for
payment of the ridiculous sum of £i ys 46. for stout supplied to Mrs.
Micawber during a trying period, which I need not further particularise,
when that homely but nourishing beverage was medically recommended.
Should you care to forward me the trifle in question I must insist on
it being regarded as an advance on account. In this way you would leave
me free to act, and might count on the hearty co-operation of
Your sincere well-wisher,
Wilkins Micawber.
The last letter, although brief, is very strong in sentiment, though
somewhat weak in grammar. It is a model of straightforward composi-
tion, which must have acted like a tonic on Dr. Leyds’ jaded moral nature.
Dear Sir, —
I take up my penn to thank you for what you are going to do
about the pease party in England. If you are short, I can let you have a
bitt. These pease meetings are our best chawnst; and I’d two red clocks
out of the last one myself. So if you want a couple of bob to set another
pease-meetin' to work here, you've only to arst. But don’t have none of
them tickets. Rough and tumble’s what soots us best.
Yours obliged,
Bill Sykes.
Dr. Leyds’ game, although doubtless on a grander and more refined
scale than common robbery from the person, was based on no superior
morality. The Secret Service Fund of the “simple Boer herdsman” with
which he had been entrusted amounted to nearly £50,000. What became
of this large sum ? It would be deeply interesting to have full and reliable
information respecting Dr. Leyds’ expenditure incurred in purchasing
Continental opinion, and authentic details concerning the “Press fund.”
But when delicately approached on this subject by an inquisitive corre-
spondent he showed himself as sensitive as the mimosa plant. Half closing
his eyes, he treated this searcher after truth to a gentle diplomatic smile,
and assured him in the most polite and affable tone “that the discussion of
such a question would be inconsistent with his views of diplomacy.”
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.


Disclosures on this subject would doubtless open the eyes of those austere
moralists who point so confidently to the unanimity of the foreign press in
denouncing the Briton and siding with the Boer as proof-positive of the
wickedness and corruption of the British in venturing to protect British
subjects against the poor herdsmen of Pretoria.” The general feeling of
hostility towards England already noticed afforded Continental editors
subsidised with Pretorian gold an occupation combining pleasure with
profit, when they espoused the Boer cause and denounced the atrocious
Anglo-Saxon.
The success of the Boers at the commencement of hostilities greatlv
elated their Continental supporters, who were already helping them to dis-
cuss the demands they ought to make from the enemy, without calculating
that the fortune of war might possibly change. In five short stanzas en-
titled the “Foreign Press” this possibility is, however, amusingly predicted
by the composer.
Unless bad news should come once more,
And some disaster as before
Strike those upon our side,
We may, let’s hope, at last rejoice,
And hail with no uncertain voice,
The turning of the tide.
Chers confreres, who have been so kind
It’s probable, you will not find
Much reason to be glad.
Ah, non parbleu! Ah, sapristi!
You wish the news could always be
Invariably bad.
And Hebe Freunde, you as well
Rejoiced as each mischance befell
The troops in Africa.
You liked to read of each reverse,
And hoped that things were getting worse,
Ach Donnerwetter ja!
Although you now may feel regret,
Some circumstances sadder yet
May come with final peace;
Oh, think of that disastrous day,
When Feyds has no more cash to pay
And all his bribes must cease.
The situation will be strange,
You must desire a little change
Fike any other men.
One plat will suit you all, I trust,
With equal energy you must
Abuse each other then.


Loyds’ religion was of a different denomination from that of Kruger. In
an article which appeared in the “Cork Daily Herald he is classed as a
Catholic. Fatner O’Reilly, who was for many years Catholic Priest at
Wynberg, South Africa, denies the truth of this statement. He says, As
to Leyds, he must have concealed his Catholicity very successfully. I for
one should not be more astonished if I heard that Satan himself was a
loyal son of the Church.” It is evident that those who knew him best
placed the least confidence in him.
While Dr. was busily engaged in Europe exciting Continental
prejudice against Great Britain, and stimulating Anglophobia by every
means in his power, Oom Paul was feeding the Boers on the grossest
delusions with regard to European intervention. do many it might seem
a matter of wonder that they should be such easy dupes to the multifarious
deceptions practised on them by Kruger, but to those acquainted with theii
real characteristics it causes no surprise. Mr. George Lacy, writing to
“The Times,” graphically defines the Boer character with the authority of
actual experience gained during a lengthened residence amongst them.
“I know the Boer,” he says, “root and branch, stock, lock and barrel. I
have hunted with them in almost every hunting-ground in South Africa; I
have fought for them; I have traded with them throughout the Transvaal
and Free State; I have dug for diamonds and gold with them; I have been
with them on their land commissions and surveys; I have lived in their
houses and been a guest in hundreds of their farms; I have written the
biographies of all their explorers and the history of many of their greatest
deeds. And with all this knowledge of them my estimation is that they
are the craftiest, most hypocritical, most dishonest, most untruthful, cruel-
lest, most ignorant, most overbearing, most immoral and stupidest race of
white people in the world.” A heavy indictment, but a true one. “Their
apparent bravery,” he continues, “is a mixture of fanaticism and contempt
for us. They have the ingrained conception—one can hardly call it a
belief, for it is based on nothing more tangible than the constant reading
of the Old Testament —that they are God's chosen people, and are
invincible; but of what we understand by courage in cold blood, they are
incapable. I never knew but one Boer hunter who would do the dare-devil
things English hunters do as a matter of course. Boers will never hunt
dangerous game on foot if they can possibly avoid it; and in the matter of
approaching wounded animals they carry caution to its utmost verge. As
long as they are fairly successful, or hold an obvious advantage, they seem
brave enough, but the student of their wars with, the Basutos and the
northern and eastern tribes of the Transvaal knows that on anything like
a reversal they have done more running away than fighting. Neither are
they a religious people, unless the word religious is accorded a very forced
meaning. Religion is a thing of the heart and the soul; the religion of
the Boers is a thing of the lips. It is absolutely soulless.
“A more depressing spectacle than a religious meeting in a Boer's house
is inconceivable. It is a dull, droning repetition of familiar sentences,
without one grain of feeling or reverence in it. Their very fanaticism is a


mere distorted form of arrogance. Their supposed morality rests upon as
flimsy a basis. Considering that there is a whole tribe (the Griquas) in
South Africa who are the offspring of Dutch and Hottentots, it is incon-
ceivable how this claim could have been made for them. All the so-
called “Cape Boys” are bastards. I would go the length of saying that,
say, in 1870 there was not a single farm in the Orange Free State or the
Transvaal on which there was not a bastard child. I speak what I know,
and 1 know what I speak. The claim for their morality is the most
ludicrous of all the claims made for them. Their leading men have over
and over again declared that they do not regard coloured people as human
beings at all. As to the denials of their practice of slavery, it is superfluous
to reiterate the fact that they have always been slaveholders, and always
will be if they get the chance. Their cruelties to their servants have to
be known to be believed. The traveller who goes into a Boer’s house and
p.irtakes of a cup of coffee knows nothing of them. But the trader who
spends two or three days at each farm sees things as they are. Their craft
and hypocrisy have been amply demonstrated by the publication of the
diplomatic despatches, including their insolent and bombastic ultimatum,
which was practically a declaration of war.”
With such a virgin soil to work as the bucolic Boers, Oom Paul
experienced no difficulty in getting them to swallow wholesale his astound-
ing fairy yarns as fast as he could manufacture them; and their keen appe-
tite for sensational cablegrams caused their wily President many a chuckle.
“That 150,000 foreign troops had landed on South African soil to assist
the Transvaal forces” was received with unbounded enthusiasm, as well as
the equally veracious statement already alluded to “that various Continental
coalitions had conveniently and opportunely declared war against Great
Britain.” Their powers of credulity seemed to have positively no limit;
and enabled Mr. Kruger, consequently, to maintain their courage and hopes
at the highest pressure.
How easily their inexperience could be imposed upon is shown in the
case of a Boer farmer, who displayed great curiosity as to the explosive
power of lyddite, concerning which he made several enquiries during a visit
to Capetown. Meeting an Englishman, who was an old acquaintance, he
started to converse with him in the “taal” language (a sort of broken
English and hybrid Dutch), in which he eagerly enquired about the new
shells that were to be employed to crush Kruger. “What is die Lyddite
dingus that they praat about so much ?” asked the peaceful bucolic. “Well,”
replied the other, “it’s a thing full of something fired from a cannon, and
when it drops on a kopje and finds nobody there it jumps on to another
kopje, and so on until it finds a kopje with people on it, when it bursts with
a big noise and kills everybody dead.” “Allemaghtig,” exclaimed the
Boeotian, “but we’ll never be able to fight against that.”
The climax of absurdity, however, was reached when the rumour was
spread, and duplicity believed, by the simple burghers to be as true as
Gospel, that on completion of the war Kruger would be crowned King of
Westminster. A forecast of this event is given in a humorous contribution


in “Black and White,” which we reproduce for the reader's benefit: —“The
President and Mrs. Kruger, with their twenty-seven sons and 113 grand-
sons, who will receive the Order of the Bath before leaving, will leave
Pretoria for Durban via the N.G.R., attended by the remaining iransvaal
burghers and by Col. de Villebois Mareuil, and the other late distinguished
French, German, Bulgarian, Fenian, and New Caledonian Commanders-
in-Chief. His Honor and suite will travel in a train composed of six
state (open) carriages, drawn by a bogie engine, under an escort of mounted
Outlanders. The train will make numerous halts in order to enable the
passengers to avail themselves of a final opportunity to examine points of
interest along the route. There will also be frequent demonstrations
throughout the journey, but the Riot Act will be read if necessary.
“On reaching Durban they will proceed at once on board H.M.S.
‘Powerful,’ not in transports, as originally contemplated. A special cage
will be used for hoisting the illustrious travellers from the deck of the tug.
The ‘Powerful’ will make a short stay of a few hours at Capetown for the
purpose of allowing Mr. Kruger to leave p.p.c. cards at Government House
and at Grooteschuur; and will also call at St. Helena, in case any of the
tourists, who are historically inclined, may care to acquaint themselves with
the topography of this island. A file of Marines will be provided to act as
guides.
“His Honor will reach Southampton early on March 31st, and make his
state entry into London that morning. The Coronation troupe will entrain
at Clapham Junction, where a deputation consisting of Mr. Leonard
Courtney, M.P., Mr. W. T. Stead, Mr. Silas K. Hocking, and other well-
known pro-Boers, will be dressed in khaki awaiting to receive them. The
party will then trek to Olympia, the route chosen being over Wandsworth
Bridge to Eel Brook Common, thence to Walham Green, and along the
North-East Road. No eggs to be thrown.
“On reaching Olympia the troupe will be welcomed at the stage door
by Mr. Frank Fillis, who will present them with the freedom of the place,
subject to the usual fortnight’s notice, or summary dismissal in case of wilful
infringements of the rules. They will be expected to take part in a special
Matinee and do a coronation tour twice daily, this part of the performance
being stage managed by Dr. George Washington Leeds.”
We have given considerable space in this chapter to Oom Paul and his
peculiarities as a condition precedent to understanding some of the more
extarordinary acts in this tragico-comic drama. Some of the letters repro-
duced may be considered by some as unworthy of a sober history. They
are included on the principle that the mock-heroic, the picturesquely exag-
gerated brings most readily and strikingly before the general mind the
reality of a situation; just as it is truly said that the comic papers give a
more vivid picture in a few strokes of current events than columns of
“leaders.” The man who studies “Punch” week by week will be kept in
fair touch with the phases of the political situation, and some other situa-
tions, and the same may be said with some modifications of the “Bulletin”
in our own Australia.


Extended introductory observations are sometimes compared to a long
race before the jump, in which the runner’s strength is exhausted before he
comes to the fence, and there is some truth in the comparison. It is, perhaps,
better to regard an introduction as a clearing of the course; and time and
space expended on necessary exposition and historic setting often help to
make the whole drama clear and effective. We have taken considerable
pains up to this point to “clear the decks for action,” and some further and,
indeed, frequent historic and explanatory notes will be necessary to fairly
launch the story of our brave boys, and the part they played for Queen and
Empire, for the fight was begun under our late beloved Queen Victoria.
It was no small cause in which Tasmania took part, and the cry “For King
and Country” was as imperious in the ears of her sons as in those of other
children and grandchildren of the “Grey Mother,”
“Never a cannon’s booming,
Never a battle’s roar;
Never the marching of armies
Thunderous along the shore ;
But it stirred us in our sleeping,
And we turned in our cosy bed,
For we knew there were wars for England,
And we dreamt of England's dead.
Ah, ’tis no empty fluttering of a dream,
Our flag's proud gleam ;
Many and tired the fingers that have sewn it,
Seam by seam ;
Staining it with life’s crimson, and the blue
Of northern skies and seas, till winds have blown it
Wider than all their wonder and their dream.
The red lines of pulsing lives were the thread of it,
Pulsing lives that bled away for its sake beneath the spread of it;
Till the wide seas knew it,
And the winds of the wide world blew it;
And the hosts of England followed the flag till earth
Trembled under the tread of it.
Ep with it into the sky
Let it blow abroad, let its message fly
Like the grey gull over the deep,
As glad, as free,
There are names of pride emblazoned on every fold,
But deeper, more dear than ever was script in gold,
Names that can never sleep;
Though only the heart of love and the eye of God can see.”

AVING devoted so much space to Kruger and his cha-
racteristics, something must be said of Kruger's country,
for Kruger has certainly been the uncrowned King of
the South African Republic for the last quarter of a
century. Its history is his history. How did the “situation'’
come about? Until the outbreak of the war in October, 1899, the general
public knew next to nothing of the Transvaal and Orange Free State.
We have affected to be amused at the Boer’s ignorance of anything outside
his own veldt and mountain fastnesses, and no doubt that ignorance was
remarkable; but our own ignorance—the bulk of Britishers—of Kruger's
country was only second to theirs. A brief historic summary is all that
can be given here; still, since England’s war was the Empire’s war, and
Tasmanians are a part thereof, some recital of the history of our opponents
is as necessary, by way of introduction, in a book dealing specifically with
Tasmania's part of the struggle, as it is in a book written from the pinnacle
of the Empire.


The Boer has a striking and heroic ancestry; all the more heroic and
hardy because it is a mixed ancestry. Modern biological science has
shown that cross fertilisation in plants and animals insures a stronger
breed, and the earlier Boers had an ancestry from the stolid and resolute
Dutchman, with an intermixture of the best blood of France. These
Huguenots left their beloved France because they held something more
dear than love of country. They left their native iand for conscience sake
on the revocation of the famous Edict of Nantes. ihe outward circum-
stances of their life in the new land, where they intermarried with the
Dutch, were such as to beget self-reliance and resourcefulness. These
men in these South African valleys were no luxurious children of the
sunny south. Nature was to them a stern nurse, and they did credit to
her. They became hunters and marksmen, not from love of sport, but
from the exigencies of existence. From both sources they were Puritan
in religion. Indeed, one of the formative influences of their character
was “a dour, fatalistic, Old Testament religion,” and past memories and
present motives converged into a narrow and ardent patriotism. Com-
bine all these influences and all these equalities in one individual, and you
have the modern Boer —the most formidable antagonist who ever crossed
the path of Imperial Britain.” It has been aptly said that their ancient
theology is correlated with inconveniently modern rifles.
The Portuguese had been the pioneers in South Africa, but they were
more noted as explorers than as colonists, and their chief foothold is now
around Delagoa Bay. In the time of the English Commonwealth the
Dutch began to settle at the Cape, and in process of time they were joined
by the French Protestants. During the 18th century the little community
was so small and insignificant as to have little interest for the historian.
Their increase was comparatively slow, and their territory could scarcely
be said to tempt any outsider, however keen his earth-hunger. By the
beginning of the last century, however, a new interest was manifesting itself
in the Cape of Good Hope. It was a route to India. The world had
been stirred to its foundations by the Napoleonic wars —and the French
Revolution —their fights with us and their fights with themselves, and in
the settling up of the game Cape Colony passed into the hands of the
British. We had landed a handful of troops there in 1806, and had cap-
tured Capetown, and in 1814 we paid “six millions to the Stadtholder foi
the transference of this and some South American land.” It has been
well said that Castlereagh and Liverpool, the diplomats of the day, had no
dream of the strange items they were buying for the Empire. Here are
some of them:—“Nine Kaffir wars ; the greatest diamond mines in the
world; the wealthiest gold mines; two costly and humiliating campaigns
with men whom we respected when we fought with them ; and now, at last,
we hope, a South Africa of peace and prosperity.” To this inheritance
we had the incontestable dual title of conquest and purchase; the one unde-
fined question of which the slim Boer took large advantage was that of the
ownership of the vast “Hinterland.” We were the owners of South Africa,
but we had no defined Monroe doctrine, and in course of time the nomadic


Boer moved off into the adjacent territory, driving out the aboriginal
African with a ruthless hand. What was the position in this territory ?
This was a question that has been at the root of all our South African
trouble. But prior to this great Trek, but intimately connected with the
whole story, was the holding of slaves and the treatment of the natives by
the Boers. During these early years a considerable number of British
emigrants had settled among these Dutch, French, and German pioneers.
In 1820 they were about one-sixth of the white population. Ihey were
men of kindred race and religion, but they were slow to amalgamate. They
held fundamentally different views on the negro question. The British
Government has always played the unpopular part of the defender of
native servants, and the great movement for the emancipation of the slaves
was rushing as a great flood of humanity. And as the Boers were cruel
masters and greedy slave holders, our first trouble not unnaturally arose
out of this domestic question. The attempt to arrest a Dutch farmer for
ill-treating his slaves led to a local rising on a small but determined scale.
One or two outlaws were shot in a cave, and others were hanged at
Slaghter’s Nek. This was never forgotten by the Boers. The affair at
Slaghter’s Nek in 1816 may be taken as an illustration of the way in which
racial animosity fastened on any incident calculated to feed it. Six men
were hanged for an outbreak against British authority. The rope broke
and four of the men rose unharmed. The British authorities horrified the
Dutch spectators by hanging the culprits over again. “It was at Slaghter’s
Nek,” said Mr. Reitz in his appeal to the Dutch at the outbreak of the
war, “that the first bloodstained beacon was erected which marks the
boundary between Boer and Briton in South Africa, and the eyes of pos-
terity still glance back shudderingly through the long vista of years at that
tragedy of horror. It is well known that at the Jameson Raid Mr. Kruger
had in Pretoria the very beam of wood on which the six were hanged, and
that some of the burghers strongly favoured the idea of hanging the leading
Reformers on it.” (E. T. Cook.)
This was the outcome of the native question, but the trekking into new
territory set up a more acute case of disagreement. Why did the Boer
“trek” into what is now the Transvaal? Simply that he might be away from
British rule and might live his patriarchal life, and treat the coloured people
in the manner that he describes as “proper.” It is readily admitted that
in many individual instances the Boer’s treatment of his domestics was no
worse than that of individual Britishers, but his fundamental conception of
the “proper treatment” of them was impossible to the English people. In
the “Grondwet,” or Constitution, of the Transvaal, it was expressly laid
down (Art. IX.) that there should be “no equality, either in Church or
State, between white and coloured.” This is very essential to a clear
understanding of South African history. By contrast we turn to the state
of affairs in Cape Colony, and we find that any native who can fulfil the
conditions has as much right to vote as a white man, and does it. Mr.
E. T. Cook has pointed out (“Rights and Wrongs of the Transvaal War,”
p. 10) that so important a member of the Cape Parliament as Mr. Rose


Innes owed his seat at one time to the native vote. Dr. Livingstone, who
knew Boers and natives better than most men, said “The great objection
many of the Boers have to English law is that it makes no difference
between black and white. They felt aggrieved in their supposed losses of
the Hottentot slaves, and determined to erect themselves into a Republic,
in which they might pursue without molestation the 'proper treatment of
the blacks.' ” (“Missionary "travels in Soutn Africa,” p. 29.) Hence the
Great Trek of 1836. The emancipation of the slaves in all the British
dominions had just been effected at a cost of twenty millions sterling. Sir
Conan Doyle remarks that by this action “We spent our money, we ruined
our West Indian colonies, and we started a disaffection in South Africa,
the end of which we have not yet seen." But he hastens to add, “Yet if it
were to, be done we should doubtless do it." The fulfilment of this Christ-
ian enterprise entailed some inconvenience upon the Boer farmers, and in
consideration thereof three million pounds were allotted to meet this loss.
The carrying out of this financial scheme seems to have been tactless, almost
to the length of dishonesty. It gave a sum of something like £yo per head
for slaves, which was less than their current value. Added to this the
money was made payable in London, so that the burghers sold out their
claims to middlemen at greatly reduced values. This led to a storm of
indignation throughout the whole community. In disgust, if not in des-
peration. they quitted the country with their herds and ox-wagons, to the
number of about ten thousand. Among these voortrekkers was Paul
Kruger, a boy of some ten years. They went in small parties, and many
of them perished at the hands of the natives. In fact, thev constantly were
exposed to savage attacks ; but they seemed to have enjoyed this state of
affairs, for apart from the dangers the shooting down of Zulus was a sort of
sport. They occupied what is now the Orange River Colony and the
Transvaal, but other parties fought their way into what is now Natal, only
to find the British Flag flying, for a small company of Britons had settled
at Durban on the coast. The crucial question now arose, Who were these
people, and whose the new territory of which they had taken possession?
They were evidently British subjects who could not seize adjacent territory
and set up a claim to be an independent people. They were not absolved
from their allegiance to the British crown, and if any one might claim the
new territory it was the owners of Cape Colony. Here was a prolific
source of trouble. Fighting occurred over the matter at Durban in 1842.
This small fight was a significant one, as it turned the face of the Boers
away from the sea, with all its untold possibilities. Meantime the little
communities beyond the Orange River and the Vaal had grown in numbers,
but were practically without any form of government. They were by
no means at peace among themselves, and the Kaffirs were a constant
menace to them. “Lydenburg, Zoutpansberg and Potchefstroom were on
the point of turning their rifles against each other.” Further south “a
welter of Dutch farmers, Basutos, Hottentots, and half-breeds were living
in a chronic state of turbulence, recognising neither the British authority
to the south of them, nor the Transvaal republics to the north. The chaos


became at last unendurable, and in 1848 a garrison was placed at Bloemfon-
tein and the district incorporated in the British Empire. The Boers of
the Transvaal desired their independence in the new territory, and the
Colonial Office was by no means unwilling to grant it, and consequently
the Sand River Convention was signed in 1852, and in 1854 the British,
with equal alacrity, withdrew from the Orange tree State—in the latter
case against the wish of a large portion of the inhabitants. Indeed a
petition was presented against the withdrawal, and the Government actually
voted £48.000 to compensate those who were supposed to have suffered by
the change of government. Hie only stipulation in this granting of
independence was that there should be no slavery, and we can easily
perceive that this would touch an old sore.
We may here note in passing that in a few years, that is, by 1872, the
Home Government granted responsible government to the Cape Colony,
notwithstanding that the great majority were Dutch. The Dutch element
entirely predominated, and the Colony was governed by them. “A Dutch
Government was ruling the British in a British colony at a time when the
Boers would not give an Englishman a vote upon a municipal council in
a city which he had built himself.” (Doyle.)
Things, however, had not gone smoothly or successfully in the South
African Republic, as it was afterwards called. There had been frequent
fights with the warlike natives on either side. These constant fights and
factions have been aptly compared to the condition of the Tuscan Republics
of mediaeval Italy. “Disorganisation ensued. The burghers would not
pay taxes, and the Treasury was empty. One fierce Kaffir tribe threatened
them from the north, and the Zulus on the east. At this juncture Great
Britain stepped in and saved them, if not from extinction, at least from
bankruptcy, by annexing the country. This was done by Sir Theophilus
Shepstone, the British High Commissioner. This was in 1877. The
Sand River Convention was annulled. It would be idle to say that all the
Boers approved of this change, though it is usually mentioned by British
writers that they would shortly have petitioned for annexation had the
British delayed it. Burgers, who was then President, lodged a merely
formal protest, took up his residence in Cape Colony, and received a pension
from the British Government. Xot less noteworthy in the light of subse-
quent events is the fact that Kruger himself accepted a paid office under
Government. A memorial was signed against the annexation by a ma-
jority, but there was a substantial minority who took the opposite view of
the change. Thus, again, the Transvaal Boers became subjects of the
Crown. In this annexation Great Britain had no selfish motives, for the
Rand mines were unknown. On the contrary, “an empty Treasury and
two native wars were the reversion which we took over. It was honestly
believed that the country was in too distracted a state to govern itself, and
had, by its weakness, become a scandal and a danger to its neighbours.
There was nothing sordid in our action, though it may have been both
injudicious and high-handed.” (Doyle.)


We had to subdue the natives and the carrying out of internal reforms,
the establishing of a \ olksraad, and the fulfilling of pledges generally were
unhappily delayed in the process. Sir Owen Lanyon was not a happy
choice as Governor, and the Boers, becoming impatient, attributed to
duplicity what was due to “the law’s delay” and to red tape. The two
savage hordes were subdued, and the country was solvent, so that now,
after three years, the causes that made the annexation tolerable were re-
moved, and the impatient Boers rose in rebellion against the Government.
This was a well-organised and whole-hearted revolt. Every family con-
tributed soldiers, with the result that our tiny garrisons in various centres
were effectively shut in, while in the open country our few troops were
outclassed and outnumbered. We have learnt much since then. It was
a new style of warfare, and the leaders were not prepared for it. At
Laing s Nek a small force was shot down with an average of five bullets
in each man! ihis resulted from the British attempt to rush a kopje
where the Boer riflemen had ample cover, and our brave fellows were shot
down as at Magersfontein twenty years later. The skirmish at Majuba
Hill it was nothing more than a skirmish—was still more disastrous and
decisive. The circumstances were these: —A drawn battle had taken
place at Ingogo; then four hundred infantry held a hill, but were driven off,
rather ignominiously it must be said, by a swarm of sharpshooters, who
shot many of our men, advancing the while from boulder to boulder. Our
men had not learnt the art of keeping cover. That was not the Briton’s
idea of bravery; rather, that was only a method of stalking wild animals.
The whole skirmish was a matter of an hour or so; and no war was ever
concluded after such a trumpery scuffle—it was nothing better. The
Gladstone Government, with better excuses than is now generally allowed,
hastened to be rid of a nuisance, for that seems to have been the light in
which the affair was viewed. The settlement, the Convention of Pretoria.
1881, was a tragic mistake in the light of subsequent history. For one
thing, it was entirely misunderstood by the Boers, who chuckled over it as
the result of a tremendous licking of the British forces, whereas the
whole campaign, if one may use so large a term, was comparable only to a
street fight at an Irish wake. There was not a man in England that re-
garded any of the skirmishes, or all of them, as anything more than a pre-
liminary scrape. What the real fighting force and the reasonable pros-
pects of the Boers were it is perhaps impossible exactly to determine, but
our General declared that he held the enemy in the hollow of his hand.
Why, then, was this settlement made, and what was the character of it ? It
gave back Independence to the Transvaal with some shadowy form of
suzerainty as the chief condition. And the motive seems to have been this.
There was a widespread feeling in England that the previous annexation
was an injustice. “With them, as apart from politicians, the motive was
undoubtedly a moral and Christian one. They considered. . . . that
it was an unworthy thing for a great nation to continue an unjust war for
the sake of military revenge. It was the height of idealism, and the result
lias not been such as to encourage its repetition.” (Dovle.) The settle-


ment, politically considered, was hasty and muddled, and “the Convention
of Pretoria appears to prove that our political affairs were as badly con-
ducted as our military in this unfortunate year of 1881.’ lam anxious
to state the case fairly, and not to fall into the condemnation of sapiens post
eventu —being wise after the event. Mr. E. T. Cook says:—“lt is a
mistake to represent Mr. Gladstone’s policy as dictated only by mag-
nanimity. It was an act of high policy as well as of the highest morality,
and in the political sphere it had, on the state of facts then existing, very
much to justify it. It avoided some immediate dangers, and it made
possible some future advantages.’’ Lord Selborne said: —“Ihere were
reasons of policy as well as sentiment that made for peace. ihere was a
widespread sympathy with the Boers, among the population of Dutch
origin predominant in Cape Colony and in the Orange hree State, and
exercising throughout South Africa an important influence. A prolon-
gation of the war might have made that sympathy a source of serious
danger; the area of hostilities, and the consequences depending upon them,
might have been formidably increased. These considerations added prac-
tical weight to the moral considerations that pressed upon us. A more
impartial witness, however, and one who visited South Africa subsequent
to the settlement, is Lord Randolph Churchill. He writes: —“In justice
it should be added that the sagacious policy of Mr. Rhodes has only been
made possible by the termination of the Transvaal War in 1881, and by the
manner of its termination. The surrender of the Transvaal and the peace
concluded by Mr. Gladstone with the victors of Majuba Hill were at the
time, and still are, the object of sharp criticism and bitter denunciation from
manv politicians at home, quorum pars parva fui. [I was among them in
a measure.] Better and more precise information, combined with cool
reflection, leads me to the conclusion that had the British Government of
that day taken advantage of its strong military position and annihilated,
as it easily could have done, the Boer forces, it would have indeed regained
the Transvaal, but it might have lost Cape Colony. The Dutch sentiment
in the Colony had been so exasperated by what it considered to be the
unjust, faithless, and arbitrary policy pursued towards the free Dutchmen
of the Transvaal by Sir Bartle Frere, Sir Theophilus Shepstone, and Sir
Owen Lanyon, that the final triumph of the British arms, mainly by brute
force, would have permanently and hopelessly alienated it from Great
Britain. Parliamentary government in a country where the Dutch control
Parliament would have become impossible, and without Parliamentary
government Cape Colony would be ungovernable. . . On the whole I
find myself free to confess, and without reluctance to admit, that the Eng-
lish escaped from a wretched and discreditable muddle, not without harm
and damage, but possibly in the best possible manner, and that lessons have
been taught to many parties by the Transvaal War, which, if learned, may
be of the utmost value in framing future policy.” (“Men, Mines, and
Animals in South Africa,” 1891, pp. 23, 24.) Quoted by E. T. Cook.
The Rand mines were not discovered at the time of this settlement,
and the long-cherished intention to “drive the British into the sea,” of


which we have heard so much in recent years, was not so evident at that
time. Ihere was no reason why these sons of the soil of half-a-dozen
generations should not live alongside of us, and there was no imperative
reason then visible why we should wish to rule the whole of South Africa.
It is but fair to draw attention to the state of the case at the time. Subse-
quent events, however, soon brought about another state of affairs. I
cannot express what I conceive to be the true view of the case better than
by quoting again from Mr. E. T. Cook. He says“A study of South
African history points to a conflict of tendencies, of ideals, of ambitions.
The principle of British policy in South Africa in relation to the Transvaal
was local autonomy for that State, protected, however, and controlled in
its foreign policy by (meat Britain. The principle of Transvaal policy was
very different. Its ambition was to become an absolutely independent and
sovereign state, constantly enlarging its borders and throwing off daughter
Republics ; so that when the time came for the formation of the United
South Africa aimed at by the Afrikander Bond, the paramount power
should be that, not of Great Britain, but of the Dutch Republics.”
Ihe settlement of 1881 had, indeed, never been satisfactory to the
Boers, however magnanimous it might have seemed on our part. Kruger
said:—“ The Convention was only ratified by the Volksraad under com-
pulsion to prevent further bloodshed.” He complained that it was a
“unilateral document," and that the Transvaal had not “the status of a
contracting party. In the draft treaty which Kruger submitted in 1883
he took pains to embody an explicit claim to a Sovereign International
State. The Convention of London, 1884, did not, however, grant this
fully. Treaties negotiated by the South African Republic—this was the
new name given now—were subject to the approval of Her Majesty the
Queen. Kruger accepted this, but not as a final settlement. He looked
back lovingly to the complete independence of the Sand River Convention.
“Any settlement not founded on this basis,” he said, “cannot but be of a
merely temporary character-only upon that basis can a permanent settle-
ment be secured.” (E. T. Cook.) The Volksraad indicated by resolution
the direction in which further instalments were expected. Amongst these
was an objection to the delimitation of the Transvaal’s boundaries, an item
that soon brought trouble. Kruger complained loudly that he was “shut
up in a kraal,” and in attempting to get out he necessitated the despatch of
Sir Charles Warren, who proclaimed the Bechuanaland Protectorate in
1885. Kruger next tried to forestall Rhodes in Mashonaland. The
British Government offered Kruger an outlet to the sea—eastwards. The
conditions were that the harbour should not be parted with, nor any diplo-
matic negotiations be entered into, save with the approval of the British
Government. It is significant that Kruger declined this. He wanted the
outlet indeed, but it was another fly in the ointment of Independence, and
the old autocrat would have none of it. It has been tersely summed up
that the Boers “on the west tried to secure the controlling of the great trade
route northwards; on the north they coveted the territories of the Matabele
and of the Mashona; on the east they claimed that all the country which


lay between the Republic and the sea should be surrendered to them, so
that with a harbour and a sea-coast of their own, they might take their
place as a completely independent state in the family of nations.
It may be asked why we objected to the Boers pushing out into new
territory, since we had allowed them to settle in the I ransvaal, and had
acknowledged their right by Convention. ihe answer is that they con-
stantly embroiled the natives in all such colonisation, and they weie ex-
pressly limited in this matter by the final settlement of 1884, the Convention
of London. This should be borne in mind as constituting part of our
suzerainty at the time of the outbreak of this war, though a quibble
over the preamble of the treaty of 1884 and that of 1881.
So far we have dealt with the Boers’ grievances; now we approach the
time when the term “Uitlander is the keynote to the South African piob-
lem.” Everyone not a Boer or a Dutchman was a foreigner, an outsider,
an alien. These terms, and the idea behind them, had very specific and
inconvenient meanings. In the first place, there was a very positive and
offensive conviction that outsiders, and especially Englishmen, were inferior
to the Boers. In certain moods this is common to all nationalities, and
denotes only what we term Patriotism and pride of country. On certain
occasions it is the correct thing, sentimentally at least, to think we are as
good as the other fellow, and (secretly) perhaps a little better. But this
feeling does not persist in relation to other nationalities domiciled among
us, and sharing our common lot, identifying their interests with ours, even
though they may not be naturalised. Such a feeling would never emerge
in the British colonies with regard to German or French settlers. Amongst
the Boers, however, it is something far more than this. A member of
the British Empire has been looked upon as little better than a Jap. or a
Chinaman, and as belonging to a benighted race. This sentiment is all
the more extraordinary in a people on the whole rude and uneducated, and
behind the times in everything except in arms and arrogance. When all
due credit is given to their sturdiness and bravery; when full allowance is
made for all their good qualities; this is a true description of them. As
has been said, everything about them is of the 17th century, except their
rifles. Yet this loathsome assumption of specific superiority has been
ostentatiously paraded on all occasions, and that not in mere verbal boast-
fulness, but in concrete and practical ways. In the street an Englishman
was made to feel that he was despised, and the courts of justice would not
enforce his natural rights. In fact, he scarcely had any, even in Johannes-
burg, of which he owned a large part. At one time, following the example
of all civilised communities, it was easy to become a citizen of the Boer
States. But as the English increased, and therefore by all reasonable
arguments had a claim to greater consideration on the ground, especially, of
contributing largely to the revenue and holding property, rights of citizen-
ship became constantly more difficult. Disabilities increased. The Ilit-
lander was not a partner in the interests and rights of the country, but only
an alien tolerated to be taxed. His privilege was finally to pay exorbitant
taxes and contribute about four-fifths of the whole Transvaal revenue!


The Boer was accustomed to say in his childish way:—“ Why did the
Englishmen not stay away if they did not like the conditions ? Leave the
country to us; leave the gold where it is. We are a pastoral people, and
are content therewith.” That was the style of the argument. But as has
been pointed out, if they taxed him they were bound to give him rights
corresponding thereto. “No taxation without representation” is not a
mere creation of the British mind; it is a fundamental postulate of all
civilised government. If a man is compelled to find the expenses of the
government of the country he should have his say, not only in the disposal
of the revenue so contributed, but in constituting the authority exacting,
those expenses. The Boer compelled the Briton to pay, and pay exor-
bitantly, and refused to concede him any corresponding rights. It is not
necessary to go through the stages of these increasing disabilities and in-
dignities. They have been set out with great force by Mr. E. T. Cook
under “A Summary of ‘Reforms Backward.’ ” It is sufficient here to
indicate that from 1855 to 1881 one year’s residence, or the possession of
property, procured naturalisation, and that by 1890 the IJitlander could
elect for the First Raad only after a residence of ten years, and be eligible
for election only after fourteen years ! “It will be seen, therefore, that
as far as effective citizenship was concerned, the ‘reforms’ had consisted in
raising the qualification from (1) simple purchase, to (2) one year’s residence,
(3) to five years’, (4) to fourteen years’, (5) to fourteen years’ plus some other
conditions.” (“Daily News,” April 8, 1896.) With these monstrous
conditions and their consequent irritations and burdens, is it any wonder
that the Imperial Light Horse, composed mostly of smart business men
from Johannesburg, were eager to meet the Johannesburg Boers and Hol-
landers at Elandslaagte ? They were fellow-townsmen, and knew each
other well, and on the day—October 20 —the day of the first fight, they got
near enough to recognise each other face to face. They were the Jameson
Raid men, and our West Australian Karri-Davies was second in command.
These were some of the grievances of our kith and kin. Had anv
constitutional steps been taken to secure redress ? The answer is that
most patient and cautious efforts had been put forth to Mr. Kruger. “In
1894 he refused to ratify a draft Convention exempting British subjects from
military service.” He would compel them to pay nearly the whole of the
taxes and risk their lives in fighting for a country in which they had no
political rights ! “With nearly every European state he signed such a
Convention, with Great Britain he would not. His object was to embody
what he regarded as a concession in a general revision of the Convention
of 1884. It was on this point that the negotiations for Mr. Kruger to visit
London in 1896 broke down.” Article IV must be withdrawn, “because it
Is injurious to the dignity of an Independent Republic.” This, too, was the
trouble in the negotiations that immediately preceded the war in 1899.
Among the constitutional efforts to get some amelioration of their
grievances was a petition to the Transvaal Government from 13,000 IJit-
landers as early as 1892 —three years before the raid crisis—to which the
Legislature only returned laughter and scorn. There was an abrupt


attempt to force President Kruger into concessions. This was the begin-
ning of a long series of patient efforts to reason with the obstinate old
autocrat. Lord Loch, the High Commissioner in South Africa, paid a
visit to Pretoria to discuss the situation with Kruger in June, 1894. The
Transvaal was involved in trouble with the natives on the north of the
South African Republic, and Kruger was commandeering these aliens —
TJitlanders—to fight his battles. The slim Boer put it this way in dis-
cussing the franchise grievance:—“ They wanted the franchise, and at the
same time refused to be commandeered.” This was less than half the truth.
The franchise question was acute before the commandeering question arose.
And it was not until 1895 that it was proposed to give the franchise in some
special cases to TJitlanders who had served on commando, and this only with
the written approval of two-thirds of the burghers of the district where the
applicant resided. They were to go on commando, and they might by a
bare possibility be enfranchised, which was a very different thing. Mr.
Leonard. 0.C., wrote: —“I say it is difficult to perform military service as a
duty to the state when we are denied the rights of citizenship. . . Before
they claim our services as soldiers of the country they must make us sons of
the country. I. for one, when I heard of the outbreak in the north, thought
it would be a noble thing for Johannesburg to equip a force and present it to
the Government; but the attitude of the Government was such that we do
not know even if they would accept any gifts.” (Quoted by E. T. Cook.)
From Lord Lock's explanation of his visit, an explanation made after-
wards in the House of Lords, it appears that there was keen excitement and
much feeling in connection with his arrival at Pretoria. “I reminded those
who wished to present addresses to me that I was the guest of a friendly
Power, and I refused to receive any address unless proper consideration was
paid to the President, to his Government, and to the people of the South
African Republic.” The grievances were more acute in Johannesburg —
some fifty miles from the capital—and it was earnestly desired that Her
Majesty’s High Commissioner should visit the place and learn the nature of
them; but in deference to the earnest request of Kruger, as “an act of inter-
national friendship,” he abandoned the proposed visit. The wishes of our
people were sacrificed to the request of the old President as a favour. That
did not look like fostering conspiracy against Kruger’s country. Lord Loch
received instead a small deputation at Pretoria. The deputation was from
the Reform LTiion, formed in 1892. “to procure by every constitutional
means a remedy to the grievances under which we were labouring.” It
included the Hon. J. W. Leonard, Q.C., Mr. W. Hosken, F. H. Hamilton,
Mr. E. P. Solomon, and other professional gentlemen, and a dozen miners
representing different mines. This was their plaint:—“ Denied the fran-
chise, and having recently been subjected to the indignity of seeing a petition
presented by 13,000 residents—mainly subjects of the Queen —praying for
some relaxation of the unjust franchise laws, greeted with laughter and
scorn by the Legislature; having further been informed that not only we,
but our children born in the country, can never hope to participate in the
more precious privileges of citizenship; our wrongs have lately been accen-


tuated by the circumstance that the Courts and Governments of the State
have declared our liability to be called out at any time, without payment or
compensation, for compulsory military service, for the carrying out of the
laws in the making of which we can never have any voice, and in the
enforcement of which we have no interest.” Mr. E. T. Cook pertinently
points out that this was before the Raid and the Revolutionary Reform
movement, and that there were no “bloated capitalists” identified with it.
Lord Loch, in acceding to President Kruger’s request not to visit Johannes-
burg, wrote plainly to him of the serious nature of the situation. I will
again quote Lord Loch's words from Mr. E. T. Cook’s valuable work, p. 45:
—‘‘l am encouraged by your frankness to be equally frank with your Honor
to explain my views. . . of the existing situation. The British subjects
appear to me to have some very real and substantial grievances, which have
not. I think, received such a sympathetic hearing from the Legislature as the
residents of Johannesburg, who are the most important taxpayers in the
Republic, consider to be due to any respectable and responsible representa-
tion that they may make. . . . There is, I believe, an alien white popu-
lation at present in the Republic of about 40,000 persons. A few years may
see this small population almost doubled, and if they suffered under the same
grievances it would be impossible to avert the dangers which have recently
threatened. lam sure your Honor will not misunderstand my motives in
making these observations. They are made in the spirit of a true friend,
with a genuine desire to promote the prosperity of the people of this
country ; and I shall be gratified to learn that any grievances of which British
subjects may complain will receive the early consideration of your Honor
and your Honor’s Government.''
In a still more serious strain Lord Loch wrote home to Lord Ripon in
the following July:—“ Every moment an explosion is imminent. The
legislative and executive enactments which press so heavily on the great
industry which contributes upwards of £1,000,000 annually out of a total
revenue of little more than £1,250,000, without the population that produces
this wealth possessing any franchise rights or voice in the Government of
the country, have created a deep-seated feeling of dissatisfaction, shared alike
by the English, American, and German, and other foreign residents of the
country.” In the following October it was suggested in a despatch from
Lord Ripon that a five year’s probation should entitle to all the rights of
citizenship. I mention this here because it turned up later in 1899. After
reference to the fact that five years constitutes the period of residence in
England and “among civilised states,” he goes to say:—“ln the absence of
any special reasons, which are not apparent, it would seem reasonable that
the legislation of the Republic should follow that of this and certain other
civilised countries in making the qualification for a seat in the Legislature
identical with the qualfication of voting.” This shows that the same view
was taken of the situation by the Liberal Government as subsequently by
the Conservative.
As nothing came of these serious representations, we are prepared to
understand the feelings of the men who supported and led the ill-advised


and abortive Jameson Raid. Even if one could imagine it to ha\e been
successful it would have had to be disavowed, as it was an insurrection. It
is not necessary to detain the reader with any detailed account of this
comedy, as the circumstances are fresh in memory. It must be said at once
that while the provocation was great it cannot be defended. The Raid has
so manv ‘‘piquant points that some notice of it is imperative. The petition
of 1893, signed by 13,000 Uitlanders, has already been mentioned. The
raising of the terms of citizenship with the rapid increase of British popula-
tion, up to fourteen years, and the franchise being the only means by which
there was any hope of remedying grievances, these strangers drew up
another petition, this time signed by 35.000 adult males, a greater number
than the total Boer male population of the country. And it is interesting
to note that a few members of the Raad took a liberal view of the grie\ ance a
of the petitioners. Mr. Jeppe said:—‘They own half the soil, they pa\
half the taxes. . . What will become of us, or our children, on that day
when we may find ourselves in a minority of one in twenty, without a single
friend among the other nineteen, among those who will tell us that they
wished to be brothers, but that we by our own act have made them strangers
to the Republic.” The memorial was cast out by sixteen votes to eight, and
the franchise terms of the motion of the old President actually made more
stringent! It is said that Kruger showed his contempt for the people of
Johannesburg by visiting it only three times in nine years, though within a
little over an hour's train journey from his capital. It is thought that “he
mistook an agitation against the exclusive policy of the State for one
against the existence of the State.” Checked and scorned at all points, and
with no outcome from Lord Loch's mediation, there is little wonder that the
Reform Union put aside constitutional agitation for organised insurrection.
Arms were smuggled in, and drilling of volunteers secretly took place. Cecil
Rhodes, who was then Cape Premier, was in the plot, and lent his men of
the Chartered Company —police they were called —under Dr. Jameson, to
co-operate in the mad undertaking. It is impossible to believe that the
British Government had any knowledge, officially, and much less that it gave
any sanction to, such a fiasco. I quote a picturesque paragraph from Sir
Conan Doyle. —“It had been arranged that the town was to rise on a certain
night, that Pretoria should be attacked, the fort seized, and the rifles and
ammunition used to arm the Uitlanders. It was a feasible device, though it
must seem to us, who have had such an experience of the military virtues of
the burghers, a very desperate one. But it is conceivable that the rebels
might have held Johannesburg until the universal sympathy which their
cause excited throughout South Africa would have caused Great Britain to
intervene. Lmfortunately they had complicated matters by asking for out-
side help. Mr. Cecil Rhodes was Premier of the Cape, a man of immense
energv, and one who had rendered great services to the Empire. The mo-
tives of his action are obscure —certainly, we may say they were not sordid,
for he has always been a man whose thoughts were large and whose habits
were simple. But, whatever they may have been, it is certain that he
allowed his lieutenant, Dr. Jameson, to assemble the mounted police of the
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.


Chartered Company, of which Rhodes was founder and director, for the
purpose of co-operating with the rebels of Johannesburg. Moreover, when
the revolt at Johannesburg was postponed, on account of a disagreement as
to which flag they were to rise under, it appears that Jameson (with or
without orders from Rhodes) forced the hand of the conspirators by invading
the country with a force absurdly inadequate to the work which he had taken
in hand. Five hundred policemen and three field guns made up the forlorn
hope who started from near Mafeking and crossed the Transvaal border on
December 29, 1895. On January 2 they were surrounded by the Boers
amid the broken country near Dornkop, and after losing many of their
number, killed and wounded; without food, and with spent horses, they
were compelled to lay down their arms. Six burghers lost their lives in the
skirmish.” The Uitlanders of Johannesburg had their plans all upset by
the absurd impetuosity of Dr. Jameson, and they showed their wisdom, not
their cowardice, as has been suggested, in obeying orders from the British
Government, who at once disowned Jameson entirely, and did all it could to
discourage the rising. They were given to understand that unless the}
were quiet Jameson would be shot, and it was a kindness to him and his
that they laid down their arms. ‘‘Completely out-manoeuvred by the astute
old President, the leaders of the reform movement used all their influence
in the direction of peace; but the moment that they and their people were
helpless the detectives and armed burghers occupied the town, and sixty of
their number were hurried to Pretoria gaol.” Ido not think any other
Power would have acted differently, unless they wished their authority
despised. This ‘‘illegal inroad of filibusters” was of great service to
Kruger. It won him a measure of sympathy from the outside world.
These filibusters were not residents of the Transvaal, and had no sort of
personal grievance. For some time, therefore, the real issue was obscured
by this deplorable incident. Kruger could amass immense armaments as a
precaution against a similar attack. The British Government could not
very well offer any protest. “For years the Raid stood in the way, not
only of all progress, but of all remonstrance.” In this connection it is
interesting to quote Mr. Rhodes (speech at Vryberg, 1898): —“The greatest
raider in South Africa is President Kruger. Once he raided his own
people in the Free States, and twice he raided us in Stellenland and at Tuli;
in fact, raiding has been taught to South Africa by President Kruger.” And
the obvious remark here is, that he did it much more effectively and cleverly
than Rhodes and the Uitlanders did their “raiding.” And successful adven-
tures are much more easily pardoned by mankind.
There was a very strong and just feeling of dissatisfaction amongst the
Boers and the Dutch population of South Africa at the immunity of Rhodes.
He was allowed to retain his honourable position as a Privy Councillor,
and “his Chartered Company continued to have a corporate existence,”
although Mr. Chamberlain clipped its wings in military matters. All fair-
minded men will sympathise with Kruger’s words;—“lt is not the dog that
should be beaten, but the man that set him on to me.” For it must be
distinctly borne in mind that Rhodes’s position was entirely different from


the Uitlanders. Our hot sense of the injustice of the Transvaal to our
kindred must not obscure our judgment of the intervention of Cecil Rhodes,
who had on the spot the British High Commissioner, Lord Loch, to watch
the interests of British subjects, so that as Cape Premier he had no sort
of responsibility to the L itlanders. Sir Conan Doyle, who is by no means
unfriendly to Rhodes and Imperialism, says ; —“That great man has done
good service to the Queen both before and since, but it must be a prejudiced
admirer who will not acknowledge that our position in Africa would in
some respects have been stronger had he devoted his energy to Imperial
politics.”
Of these 63 persons from Johannesburg, all of whom were found guilty
of high treason, ten were not British subjects. There were six Americans,
one Hollander, one Bavarian, one Swiss, and one Turk. It is essential to
point out that these agitations were not prompted in anv preponderating
degree by capitalists. At this stage the capitalists were a negligable quan-
tity. they were for the most part of that middle class by which, in our
own country also, so much of the brunt of the battle of reform was borne.”
Gradually the capitalists came into the Reform movement, and as the
methods of constitutional agitation remained devoid of results, talk began of
an armed rising. I hat rising we have seen. To further quote Mr. E. T.
Cook ; The retrograde ideals of policy prevailing with Air. Kruger and his
set were now invested with a semblance of justification. The miscarriage
of the plot and the ludicrous incompetence displayed by the British as
conspirators, strengthened the self-confidence of the militant Boer
The Reformers in the 1 ransvaal w-ere in every sense disarmed. . It
will, I think, be clear that the Raid was essentially not the cause of the
trouble in South Africa, but a symptom of it, and that, therefore, though it
mar have furnished an excuse for Air. Kruger s policv it was no justifi-
cation.”
The report of tne South African Committee of Enquiry in regard to the
Raid, delayed until July 15, 1897, eighteen months after the “upsetting of
the applecart by Rhodes and Jameson, condemns the former in these mild
terms“He was Prime Alinister of the Cape Colony, and, beyond all other
persons, should have been careful to abstain from such a course of action as
that which he adopted. . . He seriously embarrassed both the Imperial
and Colonial Governments,” and so on in a similarly apologetic fashion.
The prisoners, as we know, underwent only short terms of imprisonment.
Indeed, it seems to have been Kruger's policy rather to “work the shekels”
in the matter, in preference to punishment. The Transvaal received in all
£212,000 in fines, and afterwards, in all seriousness, presented Great Britain
with a bill so scrupulously computed that its amount was £1,677,938 3s 3d,
considerably over a million and a half with an odd three shillings and three-
pence. Sir Conan Doyle says it is to be feareci that even the 3s 3d remains
unpaid!” This trifling bill was mostly for moral and intellectual damage.
Dr. Jameson and his coadjutors seem to have been handed over to the
British for punishment, and Lord Russell, the Chief Justice, read Jameson
a good lecture on the gravity of his crimes.


Kruger’s preparations “against another Raid,' as it has been said,
were amazing. From 1889 to 1895, the year of the Raid, payments fairly
attributable to “Military Expenditure,” though report set down under
“Special Payments,” “Sundry Services,” etc., were pretty stationary, from
six to seven hundred thousand, thus; —
For the year 1895, the sum was £741,654.
For the year 1896 (after the Raid), £2,007,372;
while, for the two following years, it was more than twice as much as
before the Raid. Truly, here was something to “stagger humanity” !
Some questions jwere asked in the Ffouse of Commons as to the
occasion of these importations. Ford Rosmead said that these
preparations were defensive. “Boers generally believe that the recent
Raid, if not instigated by Her Majesty’s Government, was at least connived
at, and that an attack upon their independence will be renewed on the first
favourable opportunity.’’
In the face of all the facts, Lord Rosmead, in 1896, advised the
Home Government to “sit still.” Every chance should be given to Kruger,
so that in the impending diplomatic struggle Britain might not be charged
with haste or provocation. There was therefore a lull before the storm.
Lord Milner (then Sir Alfred) was appointed to succeed Lord Rosmead in
February, 1897, some fifteen months after the Raid. All sections of the
press recognised the wisdom of this appointment. Milner was a level-
headed, patient man, the furthest removed from Jingoism. It was not a
little in his favour that he was born and educated as a boy in Wurtemberg,
and therefore, as a German, a man whose mother tongue is German, he
was closely akin to the Dutch, and had little difficulty in reading the Boer
journals, in the language of the country. We find him indeed complimented
at a banquet at Bloemfontein for his studies and proficiency in “the taal,”
the local Dutch dialect. It was necessary, therefore, that the Home
Government should wait for Milner to study the question, and form a
matured judgment on the spot. This was attained by the High
Commissioner chiefly by seeking a close acquaintance with the personality
and true inwardness of the Africander Bond. He visited Graaff Reinet
and received an address from the local branch of the Bond, in March, 1898.
The members protested their loyalty, and Milner replied—“Of course you
are loyal. It should be monstrous if you were not." He then went on
to enquire where any doubt about their loyalty came in. “If you had only
domestic questions to consider,” he said, “no such doubts would arise. But,”
he continued, “whenever there is any prospect of any difference between
them, a number of people in Cape Colony at once, vehemently, and without
even the semblance of partiality, espouse the side of the Republic.” This
attitude, he admitted, was not a proof of disloyalty, but it sprang from
kinship and fears that Great Britain had designs upon the independence of
the Transvaal. This was not the case, he maintained.


“It is that miprogressiveness—l will not say retrogressiveiiess —of the
Government of the Transvaal, and its deep suspicions of the intention of
Great Britain, which make it devote its attention to imaginary external
dangers, when every impartial observer can see perfectly that the real
dangers that threaten it are internal.”
After this plain speaking Milner was a persona non grata to the
extreme section. This honest exposure of the real inwardness of the
situation had no effect in lessening the tension of the state of affairs, now
electric.
“The situation at the end of 1898,” say Mr. E. T. Cook, “was this :
The British Government was “sitting still," and nothing had been done to
remedy the state of things,” which occasioned the Raid. Kruger had made
no attempt to meet the Uitlanders’ grievances, the industrial grievances
remained, while questions between the two Governments were multiplying.
The Chamber of Mines was protesting against the gold tax. Mr.
Chamberlain was continuing his protests against the Transvaal’s breach of
the Convention in the matter of foreign treaties. There was antagonism
of policy between the High Commissioner and Sir William Butler, the
Commander-in-Chief. Milner was absent on holiday from November, 1898,
to February, 1899, during which time the Commander-in-Chief was his
locum tenens. Amongst the questions in dispute between the Transvaal
and us was the treatment of coloured British subjects. It had formed
the subject of a special agreement with the Transvaal in 1897. Immediately
on Milner’s departure in 1898, fresh outrages had occurred. The British
Agent at Pretoria took a serious view of these, and Kruger promised
redress, and “expressed strong disapproval of the action of the Field
Cornet respecting Cape boys.” A commission was appointed, and its
proceedings published. The decision of the Transvaal Government was
in suspense, and at this juncture the Commander-in-Chief wrote a decidedly
pro-Boer letter relating to the matter to the Secretary of State. This
despatch showed Butler to be “more Krugerite than Kruger.” The
despatch concluded thus: “I am convinced by the knowledge of facts which
it is impossible to ignore that it is necessary to receive with caution, and
even with a large measure of suspicion, statements emanating from the
officers of this organisation” (the South African League). Kruger
afterwards repented of his leniency, and reinstated the Field Cornet. Owing
to this divergence of opinion between them the Commander-in-Chief was
withdrawn. Milner in reviewing the case of the reinstatement of the Field
Cornet protested strongly against it. “It is impossible that a persecution,
so systematic and persistent as that directed against these coloured people,
could take place if the Government were firmly resolved that it should
cease, but Kruger had no such resolve. It was part of the existing plan
of exasperating the British by a series of pin-pricks in addition to more
substantial grievances. “In December, 1898. three years had elapsed since
the Raid. The South African situation was the same as it was in 1895,
before the Raid, and in 1894, when Lord Loch visited Pretoria.” During


all this time the storm was gathering, and it was evident to everyone that
any small spark would explode the mine. This was supplied in an
unexpected quarter. The police in the Transvaal were known as “zarps, ’
that is the letters on their uniform, being the initials of the Republic, thus:
“Zud Afrikan Republik Police.” Hence an officer of the force was a
“zarp,” and one of these gentlemen bearing this sobriquet supplied the
spark that resulted in the explosion by shooting Edgar, a British subject,
who declined to be arrested in his own house for some trivial offence.
There had been a street brawl, or something of the sort. There is no
manner of doubt that this was a most unwarranted outrage. ihe
ci cumstances in no sense warranted a “dernier ressort of this kind. Mr.
E. T. Cook points out that it would be a mistake to make too much of the
Edgar case, but that it was not an isolated incident. Its sting was in the fact
that it was symptomatic of an accumulating list of grievances. ihe trial
was highly unsatisfactory from the point of view of British justice. The
judge practically directed the jury to acquit the zarp, which they did, and in
doing so he said he hoped the police would in like cases always djo their
duty. This was highly offensive, and grossly insulting to the Uitlanders.
They felt that no man’s liberty was safe. Grave scandals like the liquor
trade the police winked at, or were wholly incompetent to deal with.
Indignation meetings were held in Johannesburg, and reform committees
formed. A petition to the Queen was declined by the British Agent,
on the ground that its terms had been given to the press. Two months
later another petition, signed by 21,648 British subjects at Pretoria,
was presented to him. This went through Lord Milner to the Secretary
of State. Milner vouched for the bona fides of the petition, and heartily
endorsed its plea. This significant document reached London on April
14. 1899.
Meanwhile Kruger fell upon a brilliant idea, which might have spoilt
the petition. The Dynamite Concession was an acute grievance, and
Kruger endeavoured by means of it to buy over the capitalists by some
arrangement in regard to it, which was to divide the capitalists from the
general body of Uitlanders. “It was a clever scheme. If two favourite
theories of the pro-Boers had been true, it might have succeeded, viz., that
the agitation in Johannesburg was ‘a put-up job,’ of the capitalists, and
that they cared for nothing save their immediate pecuniary interests”; but
“the capitalists declined to accept any settlement on the political side, unless
the people of Johannesburg approved of it.” They, however, did
not approve, because they saw that Kruger’s scheme was “a palpable
sham.” The capitalists were prepared to saddle themselves with a
continuance of the dynamite scandal, with some modifications, as the price
of a settlement satisfactory in other respects. Kruger in his speeches at
this time indicated his conservative opinion that people had no right to
have a grivance. All they had to do with taxes was to pay them! “They
must go to their homes, and do their work, and he would do everything
for them.” He “would not be worthv to be the head of the state if he


did not guard the burghers’’—against the flood of newcomers. He made
“no distinction of nationalities, only between loyal and disloyal,” but “all
were disloyal who made any complaint about taxation without representa-
tion." This speech was appropriately made on “April Fool's Day.” But
the joke didn’t come off. This scheme was a reduction of the time for
obtaining the franchise from fourteen years to nine, and /was not to be
retrospective, however long the would-be voter had resided in the
Trasvaal. But there were so many fine contingencies that there was no
certainty of a man’s being enfranchised at the expiration of the nine years.
But there was no provision for any redistribution, and so the Uitlanders
would have only one member in a Raad of twenty-eight! This would
indeed be “a palpable sham,” for in addition to the above ratio “it was
surrounded by barbed-wire impediments.”
The petition to the Queen recited many grievances, but laid especial
stress upon the Public Meetings Act of 1894, by which freedom of speech
and the right to petition their Sovereign were denied them. They said:—
“The Government have arrested two British subjects who assisted in
presenting a petition to Your Majesty on behalf of four thousand fellow-
subjects. Xot content with this, the Government, when Your Majesty’s
loyal sub ec'.s again attempted to lay their grievances before Your
Majesty, permitted their meeting to be broken up, and the objects of it
to be defeated, by a body of Boers organised by Government officials, and
acting under the protection of the police. By reason, therefore, of the
direct, as well as the indirect, act of the Government, Your Majesty’s loval
subjects have been prevented from publicly ventilating their grievances,
and from laying them before Your Majesty.”
“The condition of Your Majesty’s subjects in this state has indeed
become well nigh intolerable.”
The bona fides of this petition was questioned in certain quarters, and
especially in the Johannesburg press, but it was entirely vindicated, and
it was moreover but an index of the sentiments of the whole of British South
Africa. Working men s meetings were held at the mines in support of it.
Petitions also from the British residents of Natal, Cape Colony (38,500
signatures), and Rhodesia were got up.
Lord Milner left the Home Government in no doubt as to what they
should do with the petition. He sent home a very significant telegraphic
despatch on May 4. It is a very outspoken document. The attempt
to represent the petition as the work of scheming capitalists he declared
to be “a wilful perversion of the truth.” “South Africa,” he says, “can
prosper under two, three, or six Governments, but not under the absolutely
conflicting social and political systems, perfect equally for Dutch and
British in the British colonies, side by side with permanent subjection of
British to Dutch in one of the Republics. It is idle to talk of peace and unty
under such a state of affairs.’ . . . “The case for intervention is
overwhelming.” Referring to Cape Colony, he continues: “Language is
frequently used which seems to imply that the Dutch have some superior


right, even in this coldny, to their fellow-citizens of British birth.
Thousands of men peaceably disposed and, if left alone, perfectly satisfied
with their position as British subjects, are being drawn
into disaffection, and there is a corresponding exasperadon on the
side of the British.’' He wants for the Uitlanders “a fair share in the
government of the country, [which owes everything to their exertions/’’
The last paragraph of this most significant despatch has these words:
“I can see nothing that will put a stop to this mischievous propaganda
but some striking proof of the intention of Her Majesty’s Government
not to be ousted from its position in South Africa.”
Many persons objected to the tone of this despatch, which Mr.
Chamberlain published on June 14. “What have we here?” said they.
“Striking ? Ah, you see the High Commissioner wanted to strike: he
,wanted instant war." His striking, however, was, in his own words, “a
fair share in the government of the country, which owes everything to
their exertions.’ Mr. E. T. Cook says of this document; “What made
Lord Milner s decisive judgment so weighty was the amount of evidence
on which it had been formed, and the careful temper in which that evidence
had been weighed.”
What was to be the attitude of the British Government? If this
petition was to be heeded, there was a strong probability of war. But was
that contingency, serious as it was, to tie the hands of the Empire? Dr.
Fitchett, of Melbourne, summed up the situation in the “Daily News,”
October 26, 1899, in these words: “Every colony would feel that its
security had received a swinging blow. The other possibility would be
that she could help, but would not. In that case she would not be the
Mother we had fondly imagined her. But now that England has spoken,
the very self-interest of the colonies, not to speak of their lovalty, impels
them to support her. for they know that disaster and failure in South Africa
would change the very face of the British Empire. The Transvaal question
is not alone a South African question, but an Australian question, and a
Canadian question.”
I he reply to the petition was of such a character as included a deter-
mination to face the rick of war, but did not exclude moderation and
patience. Mr. Chamberlain’s despatch was sent on May 10, 1899. A
few sentences will indicate its tone: “They are most unwilling to depart
from their attitude of reserve and expectancy, but having regard to the
position of Great Britain as the paramount Power in South Africa, and the
duty incumbent upon them to protect all British subjects residing in a
foreign country, they cannot permanently ignore the exceptional and
arbitrary treatment to which their fellow-countrymen and others are
exposed, and the absolute indifference of the Government of the Republic
to the friendly representations which have been made to them on the
subject.”
The despatch ends with the suggestion of a conference between
Milner and Kruger, “for the purpose of discussing the situation in a


conciliatory spirit.” A similar proposal had already been made by
President Steyn and Mr. Hofmeyer. The outcome of it was that tre g
Commissioner was to meet Kruger at Bloemfontein on May 31, i«99-
From this date until the ultimatum of October 9, negotiations were con
tinuous, and, it must be added, often acrimonious.
THE BLOEMFONTEIN CONFERENCE.
This was the beginning of the end. Those who have devoted special
attention to the negotiations from this point say that they are difficu t
to unravel and set forth. The subject had many complications, and minor
issues were often, on the part of the Transvaal, projected into the mam
current. It was largely a diplomatic game of chess, and certainly there
was much verbosity and wriggling on the side of Reitz, Kruger, and Co.,
so that it is often difficult to appreciate the purport and point of some o
these wordy despatches. And it is impossible to avoid the conclusion,
after a perusal of the documents, that the Transvaal never meant to redress
the Uitlanders’ grievances, or to grant any real reforms. During the
negotiations of these eighteen weeks there was, in Mr. E. T. Cook s wor b,
much misconception in the public mind as to the real issue. Some
question was seized upon as if it were simply, for instance, only a matter
of enabling British subjects to cease to be such through the franchise. But
the franchise question was only a means towards the amelioration of certain
acute grievances. It was thought that a measure of franchise reform
would tend to allay some of the most acute and dangerous differences, and
that other matters would more easily follow in a friendly direction. Milner
at Bloemfontein suggested a five years' franchise law, and Kruger juggled
with a hypothetical seven years’ law, and people asked if it were worth
while going to war over a matter of two years. But this was to miss the
significance of the situation altogether. “Each side was contending for
essential points.” In a speech subsequent to the conference, Kruger said
that the two Governments were “at loggerheads, and that colloquial
phrase, was none too wide for the facts. The differences at this time
have been summarised under three heads, viz.; (1) A series of disputes o\er
breaches of the Convention of 1884; (2) The Uitlanders’ grievances ; and (3)
The treatment of British Indians and the coloured peoples generally,
together with the claim of British subjects to the “most favoured nation”
treatment. “The British Government saw in the accumulating mass
evidence of deliberate bad will and bad faith. The Transvaal Government,
on its side, saw in the constant agitation of the Uitlanders and repeated
remonstrances of the British Government evidence of a design upon the
internal independence of the Republic.” Milner’s directions were that he
should stipulate for such terms as would ensure for the Uitlanders some
substantial and “reasonable concession to their just demands.” Hence he
put “franchise” first.” “No half-citizenship,” he says, “was, from my point
of view, and having regard to my main object, admissible, even for a time,
much less permanently.” Of course the franchise must carry with it


some measure of redistribution, as most of the Uitlanders were massed in
one constituency out of nearly thirty. “The conditions of a real settlement
from the British point of view were, then, an appreciable and immediate
measure of enfranchisement, free from vexatious and restrictive limitations,
and accompanied by an appreciable measure of redistribution.” —(Cook.)
Some very important letters were written at this time, and previously,
by Sir Henry de Villiers, Chief Justice of the Cape Colony. I quote
from his letter at this time to President Steyn, congratulating him on having
arranged this conference. He says : —“The franchise proposals made by
the President seem to me simply ridiculous. ... I fear there would
always be a danger of the Volksraad revoking the gift before it came into
operation. . . . But there can be no success unless the arrangement
arrived at is a permanent one, and not merely to tide over immediate
difficulties.” Other less scrupulous friends, such as Mr. Merriman and
Mr. Te Water, gave very different advice. Mr. Merriman advised Mr.
Fisher “to use (his) utmost influence” to induce “President Kruger to
concede some colourable measure of reform” —that is, the appearance of
reform; while Mr. Te Water wrote to President Steyn that “we must now
play to win time. Governments are not perpetual.” And three weeks
later: “It is honestly now the time to yield a little, however one may later
again tighten the rope.” (May 27, 1899.) The game of Kruger and his
friends, therefore, was to play with the situation rather than honestly to
face its requirements. When, therefore, Milner suggested a Five Years’
Franchise Law the President met it with a Seven Years’ Law, but to be made
inoperative by many subtle restrictions which would render it “a palpable
sham.”
After long preliminary discussion, the President asked Lord Milner
to propose a scheme. “The heads of his scheme were these” :
“The full franchise to be given to every foreigner who —
(a) Had been resident for five years in the Republic.
(b) Declared his intention to reside permanently.
(c) Took an oath to obey the laws, undertake all the obligations of
citizenship, and defend the independence of the country.
(d) Was a person of good character, and possessed a certain amount of
property or income.
(e) A certain number of new constituencies to be created.”
“The vital points here were the simplification of the oath, and immediate
admission to full burghership on taking it.” Kruger would have none of
this scheme, and proposed one of his own reducing the time from fourteen
years to seven years, but with no effective redistribution, and with many
restrictions. This struck the pro-Boers at home as extremely liberal, and
they asked why should Milner quarrel over two years ? But they never
thought of asking the same question of Kruger, If the two years had been
the only point of difference, why was Kruger so emphatic in describing


Milner’s scheme as “tantamount to handing over the country to foreigners i”
His own was something entirely different, and he meant it to be. The
essence of the British case was “immediate” reform, even though it should
be only a small measure; whereas the essence of Kruger s case was delay
and ambiguous promises. Under Kruger s scheme the Uitlandeis longest
in the country could not get the vote in less than two and a half years,
a few only could get it after five years, and the great majority only after
seven years, supposing that there had been no other obstacles in the way.
Hence “Mr. Wessels, the leader of the Pretoria Bar, denounced the terms
as ridiculous, and it was calculated that if similar provisions were in force
in Cape Colony not one man if fifty now on the register would ever get
there.”
Mr. Kruger refused to budge, and the conference broke up, leaving
the situation more hopeless than before, because both sides were still more
“at loggerheads.”
Mr. Chamberlain's reply to the Uitlanders’ petition had been withheld
until after the conference. Lord Milner was now instructed to present it,
as “a new situation” had arisen. On June 14 Kruger told the Raad that
“he did not know what was going to happen. ihe other side had not
conceded one tittle, and he could give no more. God always stood by
them. He did not want war, but he would not give way any more. Both
sides were equally determined, only Kruger was very much better prepared
and knew better what the end would be.
Was it mere obstinacy on Lord Milner’s part that he rejected Kruger 5
Seven Years’ Law? Here is his answer: “I cannot but feel that if the
President’s plan had been accepted, the discovery of its unworkableness in
practice hereafter would have led to even greater discontent, to even more
bitter and strained feelings between the Government of the South African
Republic and its Uitlander population, than those which unfortunately
exist at the present.” (Despatch of June 14.) There was nothing aggres-
sive about the policy of the British Government, Milner says: “It has been
one of singular patience, and such, I doubt not, it will continue; but it
cannot relapse into indifference.” The moderate attitude of the High
Commissioner was generally commended at the Cape, where many of the
politicians were Dutch. Mr. Rose-Innes. “one of the most generally
respected” of Cape politicians, wrote in the “Cape Times” : “I think Presi-
dent Kruger’s franchise proposals inadequate, in that they afford no present
relief to the present danger, and are too complicated. . . . The whole matter
will then depend on whether President Kruger is prepared to make con-
cessions, and meet the English proposals in a reasonable and open spirit.
On him more than on any other single person depends the grave issue of
the future.” Kruger’s next move was to pass his “Seven Years’ Franchise
Law,” with some modifications, the nature of which was not revealed. This
law was passed on July 23, and promulgated on July 29, “with an explana-
tory memorandum by the State Secretary. These documents did not reach


the Colonial Office until August n.” The law was full of obscurity, and
Sir Henry de \ illiers pointed out that the necessity for an explanatory
memorandum was its own condemnation, as no court of law could be bound
by this explanatory document. The next step was a desire on the part
of the British Government for a joint enquiry into the provisions and
restrictions of this bill, to ascertain if it would give immediate and substantial
representation to the TJitlanders. And also to discuss the establishment of
a Court of Arbitration to deal with disputes over alleged breaches of the
Convention, together with the remaining subjects of dispute as already
summarised. This desire was formulated in a long and carefully-prepared
despatch, and a summary of it was immediately telegraphed by Milner
to Pretoria, in which he said: “Personally I wish to add the expression of
the earnest hope that Government South African Republic may accept this
proposal, and .. . that enquiry should be held as soon as possible.” “It
was a reasonable and conciliatory offer.” —(E. T. Cook.)
THE QUESTION OF “SUZERAINTY.”
1 his term of ill omen now emerges, and much fruitless discussion has
raged round it. Whether the term was the right one to describe the
relationship of Great Britain to the Transvaal may be doubtful, but the
thing generally understood thereby, that is, some control over the foreign
relations of the country on the part of Great Britain, is expressly set out
in the Articles of the Convention of London, 1884. But there was a dispute
about some of the Articles, that is, the interpretation of them. And for
this a Court of Arbitration without any foreign element was proposed by
Great Britain. This suzerainty question has played some strange pranks
since the period at which we have now arrived by pro-Boers and lingoes
alike. Hence a few quotations may be permitted here in relation thereto.
Lord Derby, the then Colonial Secretary (1884), in explaining the Con-
vention of London to Parliament, said:
“Whatever suzerainty meant in the Convention of Pretoria (1881), the
condition of things which it implied still continues; although the word is
not actually used, we have kept the substance. We abstained from using
the word because it was not capable of legal definition, and because it
seemed to be a word which was likely to lead to misconception and mis-
understanding.” The word suzerainty had been used in the preamble of
the Convention of Pretoria (1881). The Transvaal deputation to London
tried hard to get the suzerainty mentioned in the Convention of Pretoria
“abolished,” and complete independence, not merely internal independence,
recognised. This was refused, and they reluctantly accepted Article 4of the
1884 Convention, which specifically asserts a certain control over the foreign
relations ol the Transvaal. But there was an undue sensitiveness on the
part of Lord Derby, towards Boer susceptibilities, and this, it seems to me,
confused the issue in some measure. In his despatch to the Transvaal
Government, which was published at Pretoria after the Convention of
London he had dropped out the word “internal” before independence. Lord


Derby stales the effect of the Convention thus“ There will be the same
complete independence in the iransvaal as in the Orange Tree State. ihe
conduct and control of diplomatic intercourse with foreign Governments is
conceded. The Queen’s final approval of treaties is reserved. The dele-
gates appear well satisfied, and a cordial feeling exists between the two
Governments.” This is manifestly contradictory, for there could not be
“the same complete independence in the Iransvaal as in the Orange
Free State” if the “Queen’s final approval of treaties is reserved. Mr.
E. T. Cook says, “It would be interesting to know how the word “internal
came to be omitted” from this version, for it was certainly not Lord
Derby's real meaning.
During the preliminary negotiations the i ransvaal delegates had sub-
mitted a foreign arbitration clause, but this the Government refused to
entertain, “either in form or substance." The British Government thereby
specifically reserved their right o' final approval in treaties with foreign
Powers. Several infringements of these terms (clause 4) have taken place
on the part of President Kruger, calling forth “protests from the Home
Government. And it is in this matter that the question of “suzerainty
has arisen. Here was the crux: the w r ord had been dropped, yet Mr.
Chamberlain insisted upon it. But against this must be put the fact that
Kruger introduced the word, denying both it, and what lay behind it.
There was no “suzerainty” in the Convention, Kruger said, therefore there
was no sort of control over him on the part of Chamberlain. The
Colonial Secretary was, therefore, bound to defend what Lord Derby had
described as the “protectorate, or suzerainty, or recognition of England
as Paramount Power." Mr. Reitz, on the other hand, in one of his de-
spatches (May 9, 1899) speaks of “the inherent right of this Republic as
a Sovereign International State.” In some of the Boer arguments on
despatches, attempts were made to qualify the conditions of the Convention
by an appeal to the rights of nations, not bound by similar limitations.
This was a very “slim” procedure, and was quite sufficient to put many
orators off the track. But the Conventions between the two parties were
not such as subsist between two independent Powers; they specified the
terms on which Great Britain granted self-government—a most important
distinction. Mr. Chamberlain pointed out in this “suzerainty” discussion
wdth Dr. Leyds that the preamble of the Convention of Pretoria (1881)
w r as understood as governing the articles of the London Convention (1884),
as this latter was an “emendation” of the former, and spoke of itself
as substituting a fresh set of “articles,” thus preserving the old preamble.
That preamble not only asserted suzerainty, but also conferred “complete
self-government” subject thereto. “If, therefore, the preamble was
abolished, the right of self-government must go to, together with the
suzerainty.”—(Cook.) This was necessarily not the intention of the late
Convention. But this discussion has only a technical or academic interest;
for apart from any such term or fact, every State has a right to make
friendly representations to any other State in reference to its own subjects;
and, further, to go even the length of making war to protect their interests.


It was, however, in this connection that the question of a Committee of
Joint Enquiry was proposed, together with the interpretation of clauses of
the Convention, and the terms of the new Franchise Law. At the Bloem-
fontein Conference, which was subsequent to much of this “suzerainty”
question, Kruger agreed to the formation of a Court of Arbitration, “from
which any foreign element should be excluded.” The proposals, how-
ever, came to nothing. The old President did not want his “grotesque
and palpable show” enquired into. And “Reitz seemed to treat the whole
thing as a big joke.” For Kruger war had no terrors. He could say
these gentle things: “Defeats such as the English had suffered in the
war for freedom, and later under Jameson, had never been suffered by the
Boers.” And he objected to the proposed enquiry, because “it was not
an International Commission, and by accepting it a very direct encroach-
men of the English in internal affairs would result.”
When the text of the new Law became known it was clear that it
was “wholly inadequate to its pretended purpose.” Kruger liked to have
the honour of making proposals himself, and it must be admitted that
he and his lieutenants were past masters in the art of “slim” diplomacy.
Rather than submit to any enquiry, he proposed a five years’ offer. On
August 12 the State Attorney outlined to Sir W. Greene yet another
Franchise Law. From this new suggestion great things were expected.
A peaceful settlement seemed in sight. Roughly, the main points were
these: —Five years' retrospective franchise; details of new Law to be
mutually discussed; old and new population to have equal rights in the
election of Commissioner-General and President; Rand to get eight new
seats out of 36; new members of Volksraad to use their own language.
These hopeful terms were qualified by the condition that it was not to
form a precedent for future interference in the internal affairs of the Republic,
and the suzerainty question was not to be insisted upon (that is, discussed),
etc. Sir W. Greene showed Mr. Smuts a draft of his telegram to Lord
Milner, at the same time saying that he could not undertake to say the
terms would be accepted, but he was satisfied himself. If these proposals
were definitely made by the Transvaal Government, the British Govern-
ment pledged itself, not to accept them, but to consider them on their
merits, as a substitute for the joint enquiry. On August 15 the proposals
were formally made, but with many new limitations, which altered their
significance amazingly. Two days later additions still more amazing were
sent, which were to be regarded as a continuation of the “despatch.”
They were “expressly conditional on Her Majesty’s Government consent-
ing to” various things, and the Volksraad would not be consulted unless
an affirmative reply should be received. That is, the only persons who
could make the Law had not been asked, nor would they be asked unless
the British Government practically tied its hands on the mere chance that
this same Volksraad might be pleased to pass the Law. What was at
first “of the nature of a friendly rapprochement” was now “reduced to
a regular ‘Kaffir bargain’ on the T give that you may give’ (do ut des)
principle.” Sir Henry de Villiers thinks that this raising of the terms was


consequent upon a telegram from Dr. Leyds, giving “hopes of European
intervention, and the return of Wolmerans from the Orange Free State,
gave hope of assistance from that quarter.'’
The proposals themselves differed considerably from those which
Sir W. Greene gathered from Mr. Smuts. The language question—a burning
question and a vital one—was dropped out. What was the true inwardness
of all this? Let Sir Henry de Villiers answer. “Throughout the negotia-
tions they have always been wriggling to prevent a clear and precise
decision.”
Sir W. Greene was instructed to point out the discrepancy between
the formal proposals and those offered to him by Mr. Smuts. The reply
was, “I do not believe there is the slightest chance of any alteration or
amplification of those. It will be necessary, therefore, for you to arrive
at your decision on the terms stated as they stand.” There was scope for
alteration to make them more peremptory; none for conciliation. Mr.
Chamberlain’s reply was dignified, and not over-conciliatory. Still it was
right “in substance.” It was “what the occasion required.” Enquiry into
the working of the new Law was necessary on the part of Sir W. Greene,
who was always on the spot, so that it should not be “hampered with any
conditions that would impair" its effect. “With regard to the suzerainty, Her
Majesty’s Government would refer the Government of the South African
Republic to the second paragraph of my despatch of July 13.” When
we recall the terms of that despatch this reference is rather stinging. “H.M,
Government concur generally in the views expressed in your despatch”
(Milner's of May 17), “and have no intention of continuing to discuss
this question with the Government of the Republic, whose contention . . .
rs not warranted either by law or history, and is wholly inadmissible.” The
despatch was sent on August 28, and on the previous day Mr. Chamberlain
made an “injudicious speech" at Birmingham. He said; “Mr. Kruger
procrastinates in his replies. He dribbles out reforms like water from a
squeezed sponge, and he either accompanies his reforms with conditions
which he knows to be impossible, or he refuses to allow us to make a
satisfactory investigation of the nature and character of these reforms. . . .
The issues of peace and of war are in the hands of President Kruger
and his advisers.” This reference to war is followed by the words: “The
sands are running down in the glass!” This was hardly the best mode
of expression for a responsible Minister in a grave crisis, although it was
but an index of public sentiment. All this was sufficiently “riling” to the
obstinate old President, but, as Mr. E. T. Cook justly observes, “It would
be an insult to Mr. Kruger to suppose that he went to war because Mr.
Chamberlain spelt Convention with an “s” (that is, meaning the plural),
and called him a “sponge.”
The situation at this time has been summarised thus (British despatch
of August 28); —
(1) Grievances of the Kitlanders to be settled by Five Years' Franchise
Law, if British Agent reported after enquiry that it would give immediate
and substantial representation.


(2) Disputes on interpretation of clauses of the Convention of 1884
to be settled by Court of Arbitration.
(3) Remaining disputes to be referred to a conference between the
President and the High Commissioner.
This was the bona-fide attitude of the British Government during these
critical days.
A long reply to Mr. Chamberlain’s despatch of August 28 was sent
on September 2. It was a piece of laboured ambiguity, the main point
of which was that the ‘“non-existence” of any suzerainty had been clearly
stated in its despatch of April 16, 1898, and “it simply wishes to remark
here that it abides by its views expressed in that despatch,” and that the
five years’ offer had lapsed.
The “pacific desires” of H.M. Government were evidenced next in a
note of September 8, “a note which was received with almost universal
satisfaction in this country.”—(Cook.) It expressed the willingness of the
British Government to accept the terms of the five years' offer, as made
to Sir W. Greene, but without any nullifying restrictions, but it “abso-
lutely repudiated the view of the political status” maintained by the Re-
public, and would not “consider any proposals” which are made
“conditional on the acceptance” of these views. The note closed by saying
that if these terms were unacceptable they would “reserve themselves the
right to reconsider the situation de novo, and to formulate their own pro-
posals for a final settlement.” There was no trifling or ambiguity here.
Neither was there any “raising of the terms.” An honourable peace was
still open to Mr. Kruger, but an enquiry was the last thing that would
suit his “palpable sham” of a Franchise Law. Yet it was an absolutely
essential condition for Great Britain, whose subjects were clamouring for
emancipation. To seem to promise no further interference, and yet accept
on the Uitlanders’ behalf a wholly illusory and ineffectual settlement, would
be little short of criminal. “It was with the utmost anxiety that all friends
of peace awaited Mr. Kruger’s word” at this critical stage.
This continuous duel of negotiation has now become so exciting that
at the risk of an unconsionably long chapter we must note its main
course.
Mr. Chamberlain’s despatch of September 8, which was delivered to
the Transvaal Government on the 12th, pleased even the pro-Boers in
England. Mr. Courtney “hailed with satisfaction the latest despatch of
Mr. Chamberlain. It was a rebuke to the fire-eaters, and a rebuke, most
of all, to one whom he must designate as a lost man, a lost mind —he
meant Sir Alfred Milner.” All sections of the press praised the pacific
tone of it. The reply of Mr. Reitz, of September 16, was long and verbose,
and was chiefly notable for its charge of bad faith against the British
Government in relation to the pourparlers with Sir W. Greene. It calmly
asserts that the five years’ proposal was “induced by suggestions given by
British Agent to State Attorney, and these were accepted by this Govern-
ment in good faith, and on express request, as equivalent to an assurance


that the proposal would be acceptable to Her Majesty’s Government.
The proposals were made by Mr. Smuts to Sir W. Greene, who ‘ had
no authority to, and did not, accept the overtures. He was informed
before these proposals were submitted in writing, that the British Govern-
ment would not regard them as a refusal of their terms, but would “consider
them on their merits.” This last despatch also emphatically denies that
it ever agreed to the use of the English tongue, together with ‘‘the language
of the country.” Mr. Chamberlain’s reply was singularly dignified and fair
in tone. It would not “pass over in silence the charge of a breach of
faith;” the proposals were not “induced by suggestions given by British
Agent to the State Attorney.” It cannot admit that the British Govern-
ment substituted “an entirely new proposal” for the invitation of a Joint
Commission of Enquiry.” This is proved by quoting the opening words
of the note of the State Attorney, which were as follow: —“With reference
to your proposal for a joint enquiry. Government of South African Re-
public have the honour to suggest the following alternative proposal, ’
which was that suggested to Greene. “With regard to use of English
language . . . the proposal seems as reasonable as the privilege of using
Dutch language enjoyed by Dutch members of Legislature of the Cape
Colony . . . and Her Majesty’s Government can only express their
astonishment, etc.”
To return to Mr. Reitz's despatch, September 16, “it was negative
all along the line.” “What it suggested was a reversion to the old lines,
and an enquiry into the exploded Seven Years' Law.” “Mr. Reitz tries
to suggest that Mr. Chamberlain consented to keep the seven years’
enquiry offer alive. He did nothing of the kind.” —(E. T. Cook.) The
proposal was made in the hope of obtaining certain much-desired con-
siderations in return. Mr. Kruger, however, withdrew the proposals when
he found that the “conditions had been declared unacceptable” to the
British Government. The conclusion seems to be that Mr. Kruger had no
honest intention of meeting the case of the Kitlanders at all. Chief
Justice de Villiers, writing to Mr. Fischer, of the Orange Free State, says
he could “understand a war in defence of the South African Republic
after it had made reasonable concessions to the demands of the new-
comers, and after it had displayed the same desire to secure good govern-
vent, as is seen in the Orange Free State; but of such a desire I have not
seen the faintest trace.”
The chief hope for peace now lay in hastening slowly. The Jingoes
were eager for final terms, de novo, as Mr. Chamberlain had indicated on
September 8. The Cabinet met on September 22, and it was decided
not to proceed at once to formulate fresh proposals. An “interim” despatch
was sent on September 22. (The earlier telegram of the same date was
chiefly a reply to the charge of “bad faith.” etc.) The text of this short
despatch was not published till the morning of September 26, the day
after it reached the Transvaal. It was received with general satisfaction
and relief. I quote the last paragraph:—“ The refusal of the Government
of the South African Republic to entertain the offer thus made, coming


as it does at the end of nearly four months’ protracted negotiations,
themselves the climax of an agitation extending over a period of more
than five years, makes it useless to further pursue a discussion on the
lines hitherto followed, and Her Majesty’s Government are now com-
pelled to consider the situation afresh, and to formulate their own pro-
posals for a final settlement of the issues which have been created in
South Africa by the policy constantly followed for many years by the
Government of the South African Republic. They will communicate to
you the result of their deliberations in a later despatch.” During these
anxious days the Chief Justice of Cape Colony, “as an old and tried friend
of the Dutch,” wrote an urgent letter to Mr. Fischer, in which he put
the case in its naked seriousness thus: —
“Before it is too late I venture to make a final appeal to you, and
through you to others in the Orange Free State, who have any influence
with President Kruger and his Raad. Ido not, of course, know what
the contents of the next British despatch will be, but if they be such as
can be accepted without actual dishonour, I hope they will be accepted.
The South African Government cannot go to war if your Government
should consider the despatch one that ought not to be rejected.
“Supposing a war does take place. Is there any chance of the Trans-
vaal obtaining better terms when the war is over ? The question should
be most seriouslv considered by all friends of the South African Republic.
The whole might of Great Britain will be brought into play, and the war
will not cease till the Transvaal is entirely subjugated. What will the posi-
tion of the Republic then be?
“Judging from the forecasts of the intended despatch, it will at all
events formulate all the British demands. If that be so, there will not
be the danger of further demands being sprung on the South African
Republic. It will surely be for the interests of South Africa that a full
and final settlement should now be arrived at.
“What I feel in the matter is this; however badly the Transvaal
may have been treated from a diplomatic point of view, there is at bottom
good ground for the irritation against its Government. . . .
“My fear is that the proposals will be summarily rejected, but that
the day will come when everybody who had a hand in such rejection
will bitterly regret his action. I am assuming of course that the pro-
posals are such as can be accepted without dishonour. . . .
“You will excuse my troubling you with this incoherent and hastily-
written letter. It is only my anxious desire to preserve the peace of
South Africa and save the Republics from destruction that has induced me
to write it.”
Every word of this was justified by subsequent events.
Mr. Morley, who was a pronounced pro-Boer, had said that Great
Britain must “insist” on the five years’ franchise, to which the “British
Weekly” replied; —“The weakness of Mr. Morley’s case is that he is


afraid to say what he knows to be true —that we cannot go on with
diplomacy for ever. We asked nothing but what is reasonable, and we
mean to have it. They are the best friends of the Boers at the present
crisis who urge them to yield gracefully, and to trust our country.”
The last British despatch did not call for any immediate reply, as it
in effect only stated that the new situation, formerly referred to, had
arisen. Mr. Reitz filled in the time by sending belated and useless replies
to some earlier despatches. “On both sides the pause was used to prepare
for war.” The new British proposals were naturally wider than mere
franchise reform.
Mr. Schreiner and his colleagues at the Cape made an appeal for
compromise to the Home Government on September 22, and received
this telegram on the 25th; —“Her Majesty’s Government appre-
ciate their anxiety; Her Majesty’s Government have shown, and
will continue to show, every consideration to the Government of the
S.A.R., consistent with the maintenance of British interests; they pro-
foundly deplore the fact that up to the present all their efforts to secure
a peaceful and satisfactory settlement have been unsuccessful, but that it is
still open to the Government of the S.A. Republic to do so without any
sacrifice of independence.”
The next most important move was a telegram from Millner to
President Steyn, in reference to the movement of troops, etc. It was
essentially pacific in tone. “The present position is that burgher forces are
assembled in very large numbers in immediate proximity to the frontiers
of i\atal, whilst the British troops occupy certain defensive positions
well within those borders. The question is whether the burgher forces
will invade British territory, thus closing the door to any possibility of
a pacific solution. I cannot believe . . . that your Honor would
countenance such a course, which there is nothing to justify.” Peace
is more difficult, he admits, “after expulsion of British subjects with
great loss and suffering; but until the threatened act of aggression is
committed I shall not despair of peace, and I feel sure that any reason-
able proposal, from whatever quarter proceeding, would be favourably
considered by Her Majesty’s Government, if it offered an immediate
termination of present tension, and a prospect of permanent tranquility.”
These were certainly not the words of a “fire-eater,” but the}'
elicited no friendly reciprocation. It has been pointed out that with
all Mr. Kruger’s love of Scriptural telegrams, there were several passages
that, if adopted, would have made the war impossible, e.g., “One law shall
be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among
you.” (Ex. xii., 49.) “Ye shall have one manner of law, as well as for
the stranger as for your own country; for I am the Lord your God.”
(Lev. xxiv., 22.)
Sir Alfred Milner had received a long telegram from President Steyn
the day previous to his quoted above, “the substance of which,” he says,
“I have communicated to Her Majesty’s Government.” And he says he


thinks there is “a conclusive reply to your Honor’s accusation against
the policy of Her Majesty’s Government, but no good purpose would
be served by recrimination.” This was on October 4 and 5. The British
Cabinet met on September 30, but they did not disclose their deliberations,
or the specific demands made for “a final settlement,” partly because they
were in a state of military unpreparedness, and it was pretty certain that
their proposals would mean an ultimatum to the Boers in their present
temper. The British Government were waiting some move on the old
President’s part, in answer to their last despatch, although in it they
promised to “communicate the result of their deliberations in a later de-
spatch.’ The breaking of that ominous silence gave the answer, an answer
also to the whole enigma of months of quibbling. With this long and
impertinent reply we draw to the close of a long chapter. The terms of his
ultimatum of October 9, 1899, were these:
“Sir, —The Government of the South African Republic feels itself
compelled to refer the Government of Her Majesty the Queen of Great
Britain and Ireland once more to the Convention of London, 1884, con-
cluded between the Republic and the United Kingdom, and in which its
XlVth Article secures certain specified rights to the white population
of this Republic, namely, that (here follows the said Article).
“This Government wishes further to observe that the above are only
rights which Her Majesty's Government have reserved in the above
Convention with regard to the Uitlander population of this Republic, and
that the violation only of those rights could give that Government a right
to diplomatic representations or intervention ; while, moreover, the regula-
tion of all other questions affecting the position or the rights of the
Uitlander population under the above-named Convention is handed over
to the Government and the representatives of the people of the South
African Republic.
“Amongst the questions, the regulation of which falls exclusively
within the competence of the Government and of the Volksraad, are
included those of the franchise and representation of this Republic, and
although thus the exclusive right of this Government and of the Volksraad
for the regulation of that franchise and representation is indisputable, yet
this Government has found occasion to discuss in a friendly fashion the
franchise and the representation of the people with Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment, without, however, recognising any right thereto on the part of
Her Majesty’s Government.
“This Government has also, by the formulation of the new existing
Franchise Law, and the resolutions with regard to representation, con-
stantly held these friendly discussions before its eyes.
“On the part of Her Majesty’s Government, however, the friendly
nature of these discussions has assumed a more and more threatening
tone, and the minds of the people in this Republic and in the whole of
South Africa have been excited, and a condition of extreme tension has


been created, while Her Majesty’s Government could no longer agree
to the legislation respecting franchise, and the resolution respecting repre-
sentation in this Republic, and finally by your note of September 25, 1899,
broke off all friendly correspondence on the subject, and intimated that
they must now proceed to formulate their own proposals for a final settle-
ment ; and this Government can only see in the above intimation from
Her Majesty’s Government a new violation of the Convention of London,.
1884, which does not reserve to Her Majesty's Government the right to a
unilateral settlement of a question which is exclusively a domestic one for
this Government, and has already been regulated by it.
“On account of the strained situation, and the consequent serious
loss in and interruption of trade in general, which the correspondence
respecting the franchise and representation in this Republic carries in its
train, Her Majesty's Government have recently pressed for an early settle-
ment, and finally pressed by your intervention, for an answer within forty-
eight hours (subsequently somewhat modified) to your note of September
12, replied by the note of this Government of September 15, and your
note of September 25, 1899, and thereafter further friendly negotiations
broke off, and this Government received the intimation that the proposal
for a final settlement would shortly be made; but, although this promise
was once more repeated, no proposal has up to now reached this Govern-
ment.
“Even while friendly correspondence was going on, an increase of
troops on a large scale was introduced by Her Majesty's Government,
and stationed in the neighbourhood of the borders of this Republic.
“In answer to an enquiry with respect thereto, addressed to His
Excellency the High Commissioner, this Government received, to its
great astonishment, in answer, a veiled insinuation that from the side of
the Republic (van Republikeinsche zeyde) an attack was being made on
Her Majesty’s colonies, and at the same time a mysterious reference to
possibilities, whereby it was strengthened in its suspicion that the indepen-
dence of this Republic was being threatened.
“As a defensive measure it was therefore obliged to send a portion
of the burghers of this Republic, in order to offer the requisite resistance
to similar possibilities.
“Her Majesty’s unlawful intervention in the internal affairs of this
Republic, in conflict with the Convention of London, 1884, caused by
the extraordinary strengthening of troops in the neighbourhood of the
borders of this Republic, has thus caused an intolerable condition of
things to arise, whereto this Government feels itself obliged, in the interest
not only of this Republic, but also of all South ' Africa, to make an end
as soon as possible, and feels itself called upon and obliged to press
earnestly and with emphasis for an immediate termination of this state
of things, and to request Her Majesty’s Government to give it the-
assurance:


(a) That all points of mutual difference shall be regulated by the
friendly course of arbitration, or by whatever amicable way may be agreed
upon by this Government with Her Majesty’s Government.
(b) That the troops on the borders of this Republic shall be instantly
withdrawn.
(c) That all reinforcements of troops which have arrived in South
Africa since July i, 1899, shall be removed from South Africa within
a reasonable time, to be agreed upon with this Government, and with a
mutual assurance and guarantee on the part of this Government that no
attack upon or hostilities against any portion of the possessions of the
British Government shall be made by the Republic during further negotia-
tions within a period of time to be subsequently agreed upon between the
Governments, and this Government will, on compliance therewith, be pre-
pared to withdraw the armed burghers of this Republic from the borders.
(d) That Her Majesty’s troops which are now on the high seas shall
not be landed in any part of South Africa.
“This Government must press for an immediate and affirmative answer
to these four questions, and earnestly requests Her Majesty’s Government
to return such an answer before or upon Wednesday, October 11, 1899*
not later than five o’clock p.m.; and it desires further to add that in the
event of unexpectedly no satisfactory answer being received by it within
that interval, it will with great regret be compelled to regard the action
of Her Majesty’s Government as a formal declaration of war, and will not
hold itself responsible for the consequences thereof, and that in the event
of any further movement of troops taking place within the above-mentioned
time in the nearer direction of our borders, this Government will be com-
pelled to regard that also as a formal declaration of war.
“I have, etc.,
(Signed) “F. W. Reitz, State Secretary.”
From President Steyn, Lord Milner received the following:—
“The high-handed and unjustifiable policy and conduct of Her Majesty’s
Government in interfering and dictating in the purely internal affairs of the
South African Republic, constituting a flagrant breach of the Convention
of London. 1884, accompanied at first by preparations, and latterly accom-
panied by active commencement of hostilities against that Republic, which
no friendly and well-intentioned efforts on our part could induce Her
Majesty’s Government to abandon, constitute such an undoubted and
unjust attack on the independence of the South African Republic, that no
other course is left to this State than honourably to abide by its Con-
ventional Agreements entered into with that Repubilc. On behalf of
this Government, therefore, I beg to notify that, compelled thereto by the
action of Pier Majesty’s Government, they intend to carry out the instruc-
tions of the Volksraad, as set forth in the last part of the resolution referred
to by your Excellency.”


“Active commencement of hostilities” was an inexcusable piece of
Dutch lying.
There was only one possible answer to Kruger’s impertinence and
the lying of his neighbour, Steyn. The reply may be described as gentle-
manly when the provocations are considered:
"Her Majesty’s Government have received with great regret the per-
emptory demands of the Government of the South African Republic. You
will inform the Government of the South African Republic, in reply, that
the conditions demanded by the South African Republic are such as Her
Majesty’s Government deem it impossible to discuss.”
The pro-Boers of England made excuses, and set up claims which
the Boers never meant or made. Kruger claimed to speak in the name
of South Africa. He uses the phrase twice in his ultimatum. In a speech
at this time he says: “God would support them until they were totally
free of England.” "He would go on commando,” said the Chairman of
the Rand, “with the determination that once for all their Republic must
now become absolutely free.” Whereas Lord Salisbury said that we were
striving “to secure the most elementary justice for British subjects;” but
the friendly efforts to this end, met constantly by wriggling and shuffling,
were always construed into a violation of the "Convention of London, 1884,”
and “interference in the internal affairs” of the Republic. Mr. E. T. Cook
truly says: “The ultimate question to be solved was whether British inhabi-
tants in a South African State were to be placed on a position of equality
with Dutch, or whether they were to be consigned to a position of political
servitude?” A striking light has been thrown upon these protracted
negotiations, as here briefly summarised, by the subsequent events, in which
our own Tasmanians had an honoured and not inglorious part.

Some account of the man who was unanimously elected to lead
forth our first Tasmanian soldiers will be demanded of me, and I am glad
to be able to give the following brief but authentic details: —
Cyril St. Clair Cameron was the son of the late Hon. D. Cameron,
of Fordon, Tasmania, at which place the future soldier was born on the
sth December, 1857. He was accordingly just over forty when the war
broke out, but 1 believe his health was not the best at this time, owing
to some years’ residence in India. At any rate, during much of the
campaign he was spoken of as looking extremely ill. Young Cameron
was educated at the Church Grammar School, Launceston, the High School,
Hobart, and at Edinburgh University. Appointed Sub-Lieutenant Royal
South Down Militia, 21st February, 1877; 2nd Lieutenant Ist (King’s)
Dragoon Guards, 22nd March, 1879. Volunteered for active service in
Afghanistan, and was transferred to the 9th (Queen’s Royal) Lancers,
and took a draft of 52 men and 170 horses for that regiment to Kabul.
In May, 1880, on special escort to Sir Lepel Griffin, when he negotiated
at Zimmar with the Ameer Abdurrhaman the terms on which Afghanistan
was to be handed over, and was presented to that Monarch. Took part
in General Roberts’ celebrated march from Kabul to the relief of Kandahar.
A.D.C. to General Sir Hugh Gough, V.C., at the reconnaissance in force of
the 31st August, 1880. Was present at the Battle of Kandahar, and took
part in subsequent pursuit of the forces of Ayub Khan. Served with the
9th Lancers at Muballa, in India, from January, 1881, till September,
1885. Accompanied the 9th Lancers to England, and in 1889 was ap-
pointed Adjutant of the Staffordshire Yeomanry. In 1890 was appointed
Brigade Adjutant of the Staffordshire and Warwickshire Yeomanry, under
the Duke of Sutherland. Retired from the 9th Lancers 30th lime, 1894,
with the rank of Captain, and with permission to wear the uniform of that
regiment on retirement. On the 30th August, 1887, Captain Cameron
married Margaret Honey wood, daughter of General Sir William Temple
Hughes, K.C.B.
Commanded the Ist Tasmanian Contingent in the South African war
from October, 1899, to December, 1900. Received the thanks of both
Houses of the Tasmanian Parliament on return. Elected a Senator of the
first Commonwealth Parliament. Selected to command the Australian
Coronation Corps, which was invited to attend the Coronation of His
Majesty King Edward VII. at Westminster Abbey.
SERVICES IN SOUTH AFRICA.
Captain Cameron landed at Capetown on the 27th November, 1899.
Engaged in the operations around Colesburg from February 4th to the
24th, 1890, when he was wounded and taken a prisoner. Deserted by
the Boer escort at Jagersfontein Road Station, 13th March, as Bloemfontein
had been occupied by Lord Roberts. On recovery from wounds, resumed
command of the Tasmanians at Bloemfontein, and after refitting the
contingent, moved with Colonel Henry’s 4th Mounted Infantry Corps to


CAPTAIN C. ST. CLAIR CAMERON,
OFFICER COMMANDING FIRST TASMANIAN CONTINGENT.


Karee Kloff, on the 23rd April. Took part in Lord Roberts’ advance on
Pretoria, and present at the battle of Brandford, 3rd May. Action at
V 7 et River, sth May. Advance on Zand River, 9th May. Action on Zand
River, 10th May, where he was again wounded. Operations round Eden-
dale, 13th June to 22nd July. Took part in final advance, when President
Kruger was driven across the frontier in Portuguese territory at Koomati
Poort, and was present at the battle of Belfast, 24th to 27th August,
Operations at Swart Koppies, Veltevreden, and IJitkompot, and capture
of Kaapohe Hoop. Mentioned in Lord Roberts’ despatches, and received
the honour of Companion of the Order of the Bath (C.8., Military
Division). During the campaign the gallant captain was promoted to the
rank of Major. It is a matter of special interest that our first com-
manding officer was a Tasmanian born and bred.
The matter of this chapter is largely taken from the ‘‘Tasmanian
Mail,” by the courtesy of the editor and proprietors. I have reproduced
the telegrams which led up to the actual commencement of hostilities.
This will enable the reader to recall the excitement of those ominous
days, and to witness the actual opening of a campaign that was to furnish
so many surprises. Thus before we break away from the main theme
and confine ourselves to the narrower interest of the “Tasmanians in the
Transvaal War,” the reader will be enabled to see the war fairlv launched,
and to picture to himself the vortex into which our (Tasmanian) patriotism
has drawn us.
From the moment of the sensational Boer ultimatum, which expired
at 5 p.m. on October 11, there was a feverish desire in all the colonies
to be permitted to send men to share the burden and the glory of the
Motherland. Tasmania, usually somewhat slower than the rest, was equally
smitten with the ardours of patriotism, and “sniffed the battle from afar.”
I cannot vouch for the literal accuracy of this quotation, but the fact is
there all the same. It was a new sentiment to us as a people in these
Southern Seas. We have few of the individuals among us of whom Dryden
wrote who
“Fought all his battles o'er again;
And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain.”
But the restless blood of the old Sea Kings was in our veins, and those
least instructed in history were made aware of the scornful defiance with
which we as a nation and as individuals were held by those men of the
veldt. The straitened relations between the Transvaal Government and
the Uitlanders had been the subject of almost weekly remark in our Euro-
pean telegrams; so that it was not alone the need of the “hoary Mother”
that moved us, but that deep-seated hatred of oppression and bombast
on the part of an impertinent set of herdsmen, towards whom, on former
occasions, the British had shown great patience. Such was the interest
taken in the crisis that I can testify that it was the last word a clergyman
heard before he entered the pulpit, and, unless the sermon was sufficiently


powerful to lead the mind from earthly things for a while, it was the
subject of comment from the church door homewards. I shall never
forget the injury which, a little later, a church officer, who was postmaster
in the town, did me one Sunday morning as I was passing up to the pulpit.
He whispered the impossible words:
“BULLER’S DEFEATED!”
i his was one of the startling series of surprises which, if anything
were wanted, helped to rouse the whole string of colonies in every quarter
of the globe. The following are the telegrams from October 12 to 17.
The first actual firing seems to have occurred in connection with an
armour train carrying guns to Mafeking:

The Transvaal Ultimatum.
KRUGER’S HAND FORCED BY THE BOERS.
THE BRITISH REPLY.
LONDON, October 12.
The discontent prevailing among the Boers at the long delay in com-
mencing hostilities forced Kruger’s hand, and impelled him to send his
recent ultimatum to Great Britain.
Dr. Clark, one of the agents for the Transvaal in London, states
that President Kruger’s ultimatum to the British Government was ready
three weeks ago, but he had hoped that it might be withheld until the
British Parliament met.
The Afrikanders at the Cape considered that this would be a false
move, and one likely to alienate many of their sympathisers.
Great Britain has replied to Transvaal that it is impossible to discuss
the peremptory ultmatum sent by Kruger.
The “Daily Chronicle” regards this statement as another of the
many excuses invented by the Transvaal Government.


The Manchester Guardian says that this last act is made in absolute
despair by the Boer President.
Opinions of Public Men
. L° r d Rosebery, in a letter to the press, says in view of the Boer
ultimatum the British nation ought to close up its ranks and relegate
controversy to a more convenient season. No Government could repeat
the ignoble conclusion of peace consented to after the Majuba reverse.
The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, speaking at Paddington, said the
Transvaal oligarchy, fearing the hour of their domination ending, had forced
on war, even when Great Britain desired to establish conditions rendering-
peace possible.
The Right Hon. H. H. Asquith, speaking at Dundee, and Dr. Parker,
speaking at Bath, supported the Government.
Mr. Asquith strongly advocates an unbroken front being shown by
all shades of political opinion in support of the Government.
Earl Onslow, ex-Governor of New Zealand, speaking at Guildford,
said the co-operation of the colonies showed Europe that Great Britain
had military reserves outside the British Islands.
The constituents of the Right Hon. L. H. Courtney, Unionist member
for Bodmin; and of Mr. J. Mackenzie Maclean, member for Cardiff, have
censured their condemnations of the Government’s Transvaal policy.
Great Meeting in London.
THE LORD MAYOR PRESIDING.
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ENDORSED.
A wildly enthusiastic meeting of London citizens has been held at the
Guildhall, the Lord Mayor presiding.
Patriotic songs were sung by the assembly, and the Royal ensign was
waved from the platform, and in other parts of the hall.
Amongst those present were Sir John Lubbock, Mr. Herbert Glad-
stone, Mr. A. G. Sandeman (Governor of the Bank of England), Right
Hon. W. Lidderdale (Director of the Bank of England), Mr. J. K. J.
Hichens (Chairman of the Stock Exchange Committee), and Sir Julian
Salomons, Q.C. (Agent-General for New South Wales).
A resolution was unanimously passed supporting the action now being
taken by the Government.
The Lord Mayor, on emerging from the hall, was cheered by 10,000
persons assembled in the streets.
A stockbrokers’ procession to the hall was a remarkable feature of
the demonstration.
THE FIRST CO XT IX GENT.


Commencement of Hostilities.
BOER ACTIVELY AGGRESSIVE.
LONDON, October 12.
The Boers are advancing by way of Laing s Nek, the pass between
Transvaal and Natal, towards Ingogo, which lies between Charleston and
Newcastle, the frontier town of Natal.
Laing’s Nek was the scene of a sharp encounter during the last
war. At present over 1,000 men of the Liverpool Regiment are stationed
there under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel F. S. Mellor.
So far the Boers’ advance is unopposed, and Newcastle will probably
be occupied to-night.
No resistance will be offered to the enemy, the Governoi of the Colony
having counselled present subjection pending advance of British forces
from the southward.
The Boer forces, about 10,000 strong, concentrating for some time
at Utrecht and Vryheid, north-east and east of Newcastle, are now descend-
ing on the Buffalo River drifts, across the Natal and Transvaal frontier,
east of Dundee, where a British force is stationed.
Several thousand Boers are now in the vicinity of the Tugela River,
near the Zululand border, and at Mount Intwa.
Two thousand more are at Maritago, occupying the railway line there,
and cutting the telegraph wires.
October 14.
The Boers have destroyed an armour train on the Capetown and
Bulawayo line, between Mafeking and Vryburg, carrying guns to
Mafeking.
Lieutenant Nesbitt, who was in charge of the train, and also his
engine-driver, were slightly wounded. The rest of the escort party were
unharmed, but were made prisoners.
The Boers were drawn up in strong force, and held the line, and
although Lieutenant Nesbitt warned them that he must proceed, they opened
fire, which the lieutenant and his small force of fifteen men gallantly returned
from the shelter of the train.
The combat lasted several hours, during which the Boers tore up
the rails, bombarded the train with shells, derailed the cars, and ultimately
overpowered the Britishers, and took them prisoners.
Lieutenant Nesbitt’s engine-driver, Flowerday, declares that the Boers
concentrated the firing of shells on the engine exclusively, persisting in
firing for fully fifteen minutes after the flag of truce had been hoisted.
October 15.
Lieutenant-General Sir G. S. White, who recently went to the front
from Durban, made a reconnaissance, but failing to draw the Free Staters
now encamped at Van Rimsnars, in the vicinity of Van Reenens Pass, has
returned to Ladysmith.


The Boers, 10,000 strong, who invaded Natal from across the border,
have occupied Spitzkop and Newcastle without resistance, and are
strengthening their positions.
1 ransvaalers, Free Staters, and 400 Hollanders occupy Newcastle.
M. Joubert is now fortifying Laing’s Nek, and strong commandos have
passed Ingadane, heading southward.
All railway stations northward of Glencoe have been dismantled in
accordance with British defensive operations.
The enemy has occupied Charlestown, as well as Newcastle, and with-
out opposition.
BRITISH MOVEMENT FROM MAFEKING.
ADVANCE TOWARDS TRANSVAAL BORDER.
WITH HEAVY GUNS AND AMBULANCE CORPS.
LONDON, October 12.
A strong detachment of Colonel Baden-Powell’s command has left
Mafeking, marching towards the border, where a Boer force, under com-
mand of General Cronje, is encamped.
Colonel Baden-Powell’s force is supported by a body of artillery
having heavy guns, and there is also an Ambulance Corps.
Women and children have been withdrawn from Mafeking, and are
being sent southward.
The presumed object of the movement is to beat off the Boers
from attacking the position and prevent any combined movement of Boers
and Free Staters.
Mafeking is on the main railway line from Capetown to Bulawayo,
and the enemy capturing the position would be able to seriously imperil
Kimberley and intervening places.
All available troops stationed at Capetown have been hurried north
to guard the railway at Mafeking.
October 14.
Colonel Baden-Powelbs column, which marched from Mafeking towards
the border of the Transvaal, only made a reconnaissance, which ended in
the column being entrenched in a strong position.
It is believed that Mafeking is now completely isolated.
Mafeking is on the Bechuanaland border of the Transvaal, due west
of Johannesburg, and about 30 miles from the point where the notorious
Commandant Cronje is laagered with 6,000 Boers.
AT THE FRONT.
THE FORCES IN PROXIMITY.
OPENING OF HOSTILITIES.
LONDON, October 15.
The Boers, true to their savage proclivities, are but little inclined to
observe the amenities of civilised war.


The Vryburg hospital train, while hastening to Kraapan to help the
wounded, was nearly wrecked owing to destruction of rails south of
Maribogo.
The Boers also pointed a gun at the Red Cross train as it returned.
It is reported that the British have engaged in heavy fighting at
Spytfontein, south of Kimberley, to prevent Free Staters junctioning forces
with the Boers at Modder River.
The enemy have cut the railway lines at Modder Station, and now
threaten to march on locality known as Fourteen Streams, in the vicinity
of Kimberley.
October 16.
The Boers are prosecuting the campaign vigorously, and with all
possible expedition are securing strategical positions prior to arrival of
British reinforcements.
They have formed a large camp, defended by 16 guns, at Dannhauser,
between Dundee and Glencoe, and their outposts touch both of these
places.
Glencoe is about 25 miles north of Ladysmith, the temporary head-
quarters of General Sir George White, who is now commanding the British
forces in South Africa.
The Boers have also occupied positions at Brakwal and Besters, on
the branch line between Harrismith and Ladysmith.
The force comprises Boers and Free Staters, the latter having recently
marched through Van Reenen’s Pass and junctioned with their Transvaal
allies.
General Sir George White has ordered that Dundee shall be evacuated.
Three thousand civilians have been transferred to Ladysmith.
There are 9,000 British troops at Ladysmith and 4,000 at Glencoe.
Although two Boer forces, both numerically stronger than the de-
fenders, are converging on these positions, General Sir George White is of
opinion that he can hold Ladysmith until reinforcements arrive.
It is probable that the first heavy engagement will be fought here.
Firing of ordnance and rifles has been heard in the direction of
Kimberley, and it is believed a demonstration has been made by the
Boers.
The wires are cut, and Kimberley is isolated.
The latest message received thence was “All’s well.”
Kimberley has four thousand armed defenders.
Free Staters now hold possession of the railway from Kimberley to
the Orange River, on the Natal boundary.
The wires between Vryburg and Kimberley have been cut.
On the British Bechuanaland border, where Colonel Baden-Powell’s
force is now entrenched, the Boer forces, under Commandant P. J. Cronje,
are moving southwards, and have already reached Belmont, near the
Orange River, which forms the boundary of Cape Colony.
Seven thousand Boers are now laagered at Dijaagers Drift.


THE BOER FORCES.
“The Times” correspondent spent four days at Sandspruit, and reports
that he found 8,000 Boers encamped over a wide area. Their supplies
seemed abundant, but water was defective. He estimates that there are
now 13,000 Boers on the northern frontier of Natal, 3,500 near Mafeking,
and 3,000 near Kimberley.
No important operations are at present expected, since the British
forces will remain on the defensive until the Army Corps has arrived.
Military experts anticipate that the Boers at a very early stage of the
campaign will run short of provisions.
ORANGE FREE STATE.
LONDON, October 12.
President Steyn, of the Orange Free State, has informed Sir Alfred
Milner that the Free State will adhere to Transvaal in the present war-
like issue.
An Orange Free State force is now in the vicinity of Olivershock, in
the Free State, south of Harrismith, and is threatening Colenso, on the
Durban-Pretoria railway, a few miles south of Ladysmith.
The force is advancing through Van Reenen's Pass.
October 15.
Sir William Dunn, Bart., Liberal member for Paisley, has resigned
his position as honorary representative in London for the Orange Free
State. He denounces the action of Mr. Steyn, President of the Free
State, declaring that such action is suicidal, and at variance with the
wishes of the Free State burghers. Sir William strongly supports the
position taken up by Mr. Chamberlain.
President Steyn, of Orange Free State, has issued a violent procla-
mation against Great Britain. He denounces what he terms her un-
scrupulous contortions of treaties, her craft, and greed, and violation of
the rights of the Boers. He declares that England has for a long time
sought a pretext to annihilate the Afrikanders.
The force of Free Staters who crossed the Natal border and threatened
Colenso are now within 15 miles of Ladysmith, which is 28 miles from
Van Reenen’s Pass, through which the invaders entered Natal.
A serious disaster has occurred to trains crowded with refugees from
Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State. Whilst on the journey
to Capetown the trains came into collision at the Victoria-road station,
in Cape Colony.
Eight of the passengers were killed and many injured.
A strong body of Free Staters have entrenched at Lintwa Pass,
’ evidently determined to avoid Sir George White’s force in the open.
It is believed that a large portion of the force will join the Boers
via Debters Pass,


A treason proclamation has been published at Aliwail North, and
martial law in Mafeking, Vryburg, Barkly West, and Herbert, on the
Orange Free State borders.
A Blue Book has been issued, which reveals insincerity on the part
of President Steyn, of the Orange Free State. He accused Great Britain
of having actually commenced hostilities prior to President Kruger’s
ultimatum. Sir Alfred Milner, the High Commissioner for South Africa,
declares that tlie statement was baseless.
CAPE COLONY.
Sir Alfred Milner has proclaimed as treason any attempt to abet the
Transvaal Government.
Intense indignation is expressed at the tactics of Mr. Schreiner, Premier
of Cape Colony, in recalling Civil servants who had joined the Kimberley
camp, on the ground that the Cape must observe neutrality.
Private J. Roberts’ Diary.
The whole of the diary was copied out, and it was intended to publish
it, but limitations of space have necessitated the cutting out of large
portions.
October 19. —Left Scottsdale by the morning train for Hobart.
October 20. —In barracks with Tasmanian Contingent for our week’s
training. Was orderly for the day. Sworn in for service in South Africa.
October 21. —In barracks, and measured for suits and boots; also

October 27. —lip at 4 a.m. Left Hobart at quarter-past 6. Great
crowds came to see us off.
[The latter part of this sentence is a bit blurred, as if a tear had fallen
on it. It was doubtless a tender memory for Mr. Roberts, and one of
the words looks suspiciously like “kissing!” But then, it might be only
“cheering.”—J.B.]

an engine, which had to be blown off the line. Other trains down were
stopped here for a time. Lord Kitchener was in one. Rained heavily in
the night.

ing all who could stop to stay till the war is over. Lady Roberts and other
ladies were there. Pay day. I drew £5.

Fourth M.I. went about a mile to the eastwards of Pretoria, and formed
outposts on a front some distance from one another. Party of Boers under
Steyn supposed to be trying to go south. We saw nothing, and returned
to camp at 7 a.m.

night. Slept in the open with the baggage-guard. Wet night, and
caught cold.
October 23. —Fine. Up at 4, and went to the transport depot for
another wagon to bring down remainder of our things from camp. All the

Colonel Henry, thanking them for their services. We left Pretoria a little
after Bin trucks. Reached Smalldee about 5 p.m., stopping a short time at

Friday, December 7. —Fine. Packed all kits and got them on deck.
Had a bath, and put on a new rig-out.
Thus abruptly, and without any reference to the feelings stirred within
him, our good friend ends his diary. No doubt he meant to record the
landing and reception by the “Tassies” at home, but we can imagine that
he was made a prisoner on his arrival by those young ladies—sisters, no
doubt—to whom he wrote so faithfully. At any rate, he leaves us here to
fill in this blank for ourselves. lam sure the reader will thank him heartily
for so diligent and faithful a record, as I hereby do for myself. It has taken
me a great many hours to copy his two well-worn diaries, but they were
relieved from weariness by the interest and value of the narrative.

I QUOTE the following from Major Lewis’s “On the Veldt,” p. 112:-
“By the 12th we arrived at Donderpoort, distant some eight miles
from Pretoria. On the following morning I rode into the city.
Tying my horse up, 1 walked down the main street. As I went
along someone spoke to me. I had passed him by without noticing him.
it was Major Cameron. Hard life and exposure had told. He looked so
ill that I thought he ought to have been in hospital. I spent most of the
afternoon with him and Captain Wallace Brown. They were camped
about two miles out, and expected to leave South Africa very shortly. The
next day (Sunday) I rode over to their camp, taking with me a good many
of my men, who had friends in the first contingent. We spent a very happy
day together.”
CAPTAIN CAMERON’S GALLANTRY.
RENSBURG, February 10.
In yesterday’s brush Captain Cameron, of the Tasmanian contingent,
showed coolness and courage, always leading the advance, and coming in
last in retreat. Captain Salmon, who has never been in action before,
showed exceptional skill in the management of his men, and won commen-
dation.
A correspondent writes, suggesting that the Government should cable
to Sir Alfred Milner, Governor of Cape Colony, asking for official informa-


tion concerning Major Cameron. Our correspondent adds that so far only
press information as to the Major's being wounded and taken prisoner by
the Boers had been published, and, failing Government acting in the way
suggested, he proposes that a subscription list be started to raise funds
necessary to send a cable and pay for the reply. An official intimation
would do much to allay anxiety now prevailing as to the exact position of
Tasmania’s gallant leader. —“Mercury.”
In answer to my enquiry as to Bernard Morrisby’s name being absent
trom the official returns of killed and those who died, I have received the
following very interesting communication from Mr. Tasman Morrisby, of
Kettering, under date of April 13, 1903: —
“Dear Sir, —In answer to your enquiry of the 7th re ‘Tasmanians in the
Transvaal War,’ my son, Bernard W. Clair Morrisby, joined the South
African Light Horse as a scout at Capetown, and was shot while scouting
at Plewinan’s Farm. He was a refugee from the Transvaal on the outbreak
of war. My eldest son, Percy T. B. Morrisby, is a member of the Rand
Rifles, and was not in active service. My son, A. Clayton Morrisby, was
O.M.S. of the Remount Camp at Worcester, and resigned to occupy a civil
appointment in Rhodesia just before declaration of peace. R. C. Morrisby
is my son—the G. is an error (in list of men). F. E. Morrisby was my
nephew. My dear boy Bernard was not found until two days and a night
after he was shot, and was still alive, but unconscious. The report in the
‘Mercury’ of June, 1900, has been confirmed by other private letters.
Tasmanians have well borne their share.—Yours, etc.,
Tasman Morrisby.”
This is a military record of which any father may be proud. I shall
have much pleasure in including the young hero’s name in the Roll of
Honour, though he went not forth with our boys. He is of their company
in the army of the noble dead.
The following extract from a letter by Private Angus Gillies, kindly
lent by the Rev. C. Jones, will be read with interest. Private Gillies was a
member of the first contingent:—
KROONSTAD, June 28, 1900.
Rev. C. Jones.
“Dear Sir, —I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February
27. No doubt you are aware of the fact long before now that I was taken
prisoner by the Boers on March 5 ; rather this than being the victim of a
hostile missile. It is a peculiar sensation to experience when you see a
large body of Boers around you with loaded rifles pointed in vour face,
some saying, “Hands up ! Hands up !” others, “Loot em dot!” (“Shoot him
dead!”) There were 120 Boers, and only five of us. We fired on the
Boers to try and keep them in check, but they were too many for us. It
was a narrow escape for us all. I can realise the anxiety mv aunt would be
in concerning myself when reported missing. I wrote to you when a
prisoner of war, asking you to tell my aunt that I was all right. There were


nearly 4,000 British prisoners. When yon got handed over as a prisoner
ot war so many men formed a mess, and each mess was supplied with one
iron pot, one bucket, and one tin can to cook your own food. The follow-
ing rations were issued to each man for a week: —2lb. of flour, 2lb. of meal-
ies (maize), 1402. of sugar, %lh. of tea or coffee (ground mealies for coffee),
30Z. of salt, 1 lb. of bread daily, 1 lb. of meat only. No tea or sugar was
issued for several months. We had to be satisfied with boiled water to
drink. We played football, cricket, and numerous other amusements were
indulged in to occupy our time. Galvanised iron sheds, open in the front,
were erected for us to sleep in. No plates, cups, or spoons were obtainable
tor several months, and kippered herring tins were used for plates, and jam
tins for cups. You could purchase stores, but everything was expensive
that you bought, and what money I had did not last me long. The Tasma-
nian Government sent a sum of money for prisoners of war to purchase
necessities, which was very acceptable to us. I quote a few prices of goods :
—Jam, 25.; sugar, 2s. per lb.; lard, 25.; flour, is.; baking powder, 55.;
cocoa, 65.; oatmeal, is. per lb. Gospel meetings were held every evening
amongst the prisoners in a large tent erected for the purpose. The Wes-
leyans and English ministers from Pretoria visited the prisoners of war, one
every week, and held services. No papers or reading matter was allowed
to the prisoners. The only time we received any news was when prisoners
arrived. Typhoid and enteric fever were very prevalent, owing to bad
sanitation. The hospital arrangements were unsatisfactorily carried out —
over 150 patients in the hospital, and over 50 deaths. —Yours sincerely,
Angus Gillies.”
In a letter from Major Cameron to Colonel Legge, reporting the death
of Private J. Butler, of the second contingent, and Lance-Corporal Betts,
published in the “Mercury” of August to, 1900, there is enclosed an interest-
ing report. Major Cameron writes :
“I enclose a casualty return showing casualties to men in action up to
the 30th June, 1900, also a return showing men who have had their horses
shot in action. I also enclose a return showing officers and men who have
given assistance to men who had lost their horses in action. lam pleased
to report that the officers and men of the contingent continue to uphold the
high reputation which they have gained. —I have, etc.,
C. Cameron, Major,
Commanding Tasmanian Contingent.”

The following extracts from a letter of Private F. C. Briant appeared
in the “Mercury” of June 1, 1900: —
KAREE KLOOF, May 2, 1900.
“On May Iwe had another battle seven miles from here. We got on
our way by daylight in extended order across a plain about five miles long.
As we advanced on a rise we got a volley at us. We kept going, and gave
the enemy a warm time for three hours. The Victorians did good work.
The Boers poured their favourite pom-pom and Maxims into us, cutting our
horses up badly. We only had two pom-poms and one Maxim. Their
first shot put our Maxim out of gear. We retreated and dismounted, and
gave them a taste of our sharpshooting. My horse in the meantime got
shot in the leg, and I had to let it go. I ran for about 200 yards, when H.
Betts came galloping along behind me and stopped. I got my foot in his
stirrup and lay across his saddle. He then galloped out of the firing line.
Only for him I must have been taken prisoner. I did look peculiar hang-
ing across the horse like a sack of potatoes. I felt we would get out all
right. Betts’s horse was shot in the leg also while we were both on it, but
it did not seem to hurt. Afterwards I saw a horse going like mad. I was
after it, and managed to capture it, and went and joined our men again.
Then I had my revenge. The Victorians lost a lot of horses, but only one
man shot and one taken prisoner. Lumsden’s Horse also lost heavily,
losing 16 men. This was the first fight they had been in, and they say they
don’t want any more. lam scribbling this off as we are striking tents to
go further up the line to Brandford. We have just had three days’ rations
served out, and will also have to sleep in our top-coats for a few nights.


1 suppose you were glad to hear that I was made full corporal from
April i. lam more pleased at getting my stripes than if 1 had left Hobart
with them." (Palmam qui meruit ferat.)
In the same issue of the “Mercury” the following brief letter appears in
reference to the death of Bernard Morrisby from the officer commanding
French's scouts. It is addressed to his father, Mr. T. Morrisby,
Glenorchy;—
lam extremely sorry to have to inform you that your son was
severely wounded whilst doing his duty at Arundel. He died two days
afterwards in the hospital, Arundel, having, I am glad to say, suffered no
pain whatever. He was a great loss, as he always did his work extremely
well, and was a most useful scout.”
“This letter came unexpectedly from Bloemfontein, and has no date,
and is not a reply to any of the letters of enquiry sent to the front, so further
particulars are anxiously awaited.”—“Mercury.”
In the official list of deaths the name is given as Frank Edward
Morrisby, son of W. E. Morrisby, Bellerive, the date being 25th June, 1902.
(See Mr. T. Morrisby’s letter at beginning of chapter.) It is manifest,
however, that two different men are referred to, inasmuch as the following
extract from F. E. Morrisby appeared in the “Mercury” of October 19,
1900. It is dated September 4: —
“We are having plenty of fighting, but I think it is all over now, except
a bit of sniping, so expect to be home soon. lam well and strong, but
much thinner. If we go on much further we will soon be in Delagoa Bay.
Have had rather a rough time in trying to get back to the company. Have
been attached to all kinds of regiments and men, but still rubbed along all
correct. The weather is getting very hot, especially in the day-time ; rather
colder at nights and early morn. We all look rather shabby and knocked
about; food at times none too good, but withal sufficient to meet require-
ments. Poor Harry Betts, as you no doubt have heard, has gone. He
was a real gentleman and a thorough soldier, and met a soldier’s death. He
was ever ready to do a good action and a kindness. He is greatly missed
by all here. Remember me kindly to all friends.”
Here is a letter relative to the capture of Major Cameron from Colour-
Sergeant A. V. Giblin. It is this kind of letter that one enjoys reading,
notwithstanding that the conclusion shows that Mr. Giblin has talent for
riction as well as history. He writes: —“Heard that Major Cameron was
missing; Hough’s horse also. No other casualties. Heritage had
brought out a First City man (First City Volunteers, Grahamstown), who
was thrown from his horse under fire. Bailey, from Avoca, did the same
for another. This First City man, in his excitement, dug his spurs into
Bailey’s horse, and tore the coat and shirt off his back, Bailey cursing him
freely, but bringing him out safely. Heard later that Hough’s horse had
got away from him. Major told him to take his; Hough refused. Major
ordered; Hough obeyed. Major took to a donga, where he found Head-
lam having a pot at ’em, 'Clear out!’ says the Major ; ‘you’re exposing my


position!’ So Toby cleared. Neither Heritage nor Brown knew about
all this. After going about a mile in an extended line —you know we work
as loose as possible, 10 yards to 20 yards interval—Heritage discovered
Major missing, and rode back, followed by G. Lowther. When they got
within a quarter of a mile of where Major left they found Boers had come
on too strong; so forced to retire. Next day sent out flag of truce to Boers,
who said they knew nothing about the Major. That afternoon sent out
strong patrol, who searched the place thoroughly, but failed to find any
trace of him. Heard two days later that Major had worked his way back
about half a mile; then was cut off, and lay down. Gave 'em shot for shot
as long as his ammunition lasted, only about 50 rounds, and when they
came up took off his coat for it and went for ’em with his fists."
The writer of the letter, however, wishes to add: —“This was only one
of the usual camp yarns. As a matter of fact, the Major held out until
they potted him in the leg. Then, seeing he had no chance of getting clear,
he bashed his carbine on the nearest boulder and surrendered."
Lieut.-Colonel Martin has received a letter from a Tasmanian at the
front, dated February 26, from Elandsfontein. The writer refers to the
engagement of the 24th February, in which the Tasmanians participated,
and mentions the circumstances that led up to the capture of Major
Cameron, as reported in yesterday’s issue by another member of the Tasma-
nian unit. Private Hough, to whom the Major offered his horse, did not
want to take it, but the gallant leader insisted on him taking it and making
his way to cover as quickly as possible. He states that the Tassies have
done some hard work, and have acquitted themselves nobly. On the date
in question, when our boys were seeking cover, Lieutenant Heritage had a
particularly rough time of it, and bullets were flying all round him, making
the dust fly round his horse, and it was a miracle that he was not hit.
Before he got away from the enemy’s fire he came across one of the Cape
Colonial Volunteers in distress, about 80 of his company who passed by
having apparently missed him. Lieutenant Heritage got the man on to
his horse, and after conveying him for a distance of about 800 vards
Lieutenant Brown came to his assistance. The writer also stated that in
the same engagement Private Bailey, of the Fingal Company, Second Bat-
talion, distinguished himself by rescuing a comrade under heavy fire.
When the Tassies reached the main body in the evening profound regret
was expressed when it was announced that their leader was missing, as all
the men had the utmost respect for him. The continued acts of bravery on
the part of our boys will be read with interest, and all their friends in the
colony will agree that they are upholding the honour of their island home.—■
“Examiner.”
Major Cameron, in a letter to the Commandant from Nooitgedacht, is
able to give a splendid report of his men. It is under date September
8, 1900: —•
“I have the honour to report that since my last letter of August 11,
when the two contingents were on special duty protecting the coal mine


three miles from Brugspruit, we have taken part under General Pole-Carew
in the operations around Belfast and the subsequent advance for the release
of the prisoners. On the morning after the action of the 26th August near
BePast I was directed to inform the Tasmanian contingent that General
Pole-Carew was extremely pleased with their conduct during the previous
day’s fighting. The officers and men continue to give me every satisfaction,
twenty-five men have applied for employment in South Africa, but they
do not desire to leave the ranks until their services in the fighting line are
no longer required. Corporals Chalmers and Collins and Privates Collins
and Fenton Smith have rejoined.”
On September 12, from TJitkompot, he writes further:—‘T have the
ncnour to report that the Tasmanian contingent had the advance in a strong
reconnaissance made by Colonel Henry, Fourth Imperial Corps, yesterday,
nth instant. I regret to have to inform you that your casualties were; —
Private Bailey, first contingent, wounded in the head. He died at night.
Private A. F. Richardson, second contingent, seriously wounded in the right
thigh. His horse was also shot. Private F. B. Horton had his horse
shot. Private E. Bailey behaved in a most gallant manner. His horse
was killed under him. He then went to the assistance of Private Richard-
son, and was shot almost immediately after. I wish to bring under your
notice the excellent work done by Captain Brown on the occasion. The
N.C. officers and men who were sent behaved splendidly.”
In a Launceston paper of same date is the following from Trooper
Thos. Fitzgerald, of the Tasmanian contingent, to his mother at Ross. He
writes from Watervalboven under date September 1 : —“We commenced
our march from Brough’s Springs on August 20, and reached here yester-
day, after some heavy fighting, without loss to the Tassies. I cannot write
a long letter, as we are still on the move. I got a mail this morning, which
was very welcome.” September 4 —“ We have had some heavy fighting
since we left Wonderfontein until we reached Belfast, and- the heaviest was
on Sunday. lam not sure of the date. None of the Tassies got wounded ;
their good luck seems to stick to them, and we always get out right, thanks
to Major Cameron. He is a splendid officer, and well liked by his men.”
EARLY LETTERS.
The four following letters appeared in the “Daily Telegraph” (Laun-
ceston) of January 19, 1900. The first is from their special correspon-
dent :
COMPLAINTS REGARDING RATIONS.
ENSLIN CAMP, Dec. 18, 1899.
The Tasmanian contingent arrived at Capetown on Sunday, November
26, and every man was glad to see land once more. Taking the trip on
the whole, it was a splendid one.
At 4 a.m. the men were marched to Maitland camp, a distance of five
miles from Capetown. They remained in camp for five days, and during


their stay at Maitland they were fitted out with light khaki uniforms and
putties and the Lee-Metford rifles, with magazine attachments. The day
before leaving Maitland the Tasmanians visited the public baths to indulge
in a good wash, which every man was in need of.
On December I the Tasmanians left by special train for Orange River,
and arrived at their destination on December 3, when tents were pitched.
After camping for four days, orders came to hand to pack up and proceed
to Belmont. After getting things ready, the troops marched out on their
journey, led by the Tasmanians, and after marching all day and night on 1 lb.
of bread and 2oz. of meat, the allowance issued each man, the troops arrived
at Belmont, a distance of 26 miles, tired and sleepy. At the parade next
morning after our arrival Colonel Hoad congratulated the troops on the
successful manner in which they performed their march.
After camping at Belmont for three days the troops left on march
again for Enslin, a distance of 14 miles. Enslin is 695 miles from Cape-
town. The men are in good health, with the exception of Sergeant Hal-
lam, Lance-Corporal Collins, Private Collins (the youngest member of the
contingent), Privates Pedder, Greenbank, M'Guinness, and Black, who have
been sent to De Aar. The men have plenty of work to do at Orange
River.
I saw several of the Boer prisoners and wounded, and around the hills
close at hand you could see the dead bodies of the Boers who had been shot
lying on the ground just covered over with stones. Captain Cameron sent
14 to cover over the dead bodies of the Boers which were exposed.
At the camp we are now at there are several graves of men who have
been killed whilst in action, notably Commander A. P. B. Ethelson, Major
F. H. Plumb, Captain Guy, sen., who were killed on November 25, 1899.
Lance-Corporal Fleming and Private Williams erected a neat fence around
their graves.
We see ambulance trains passing through nearly every day with the
wounded.
Every morning the men have to turn out at 2.30, and stand to their
arms at 3 a.m., in the event of an attack.
During our stay here the scouts have captured five Boer spies, and it
is reported that the Boers are not far away from the camp, and therefore
we are always ready for an attack. We were called out one night, but after
taking up our positions and waiting for some time, we had to return with-
out having the pleasure of coming in contact with our opponents.
During the day the heat is terrible here, and the nights are cold. On
December 17, while some of the Tasmanians were out for wood, they came
across a Boer village, and on entering one of the premises they discovered
that it contained the best of furniture, and they made use of some of the
most important articles, besides some new potatoes, peas, and onions, and
a nice heifer, which one of the men shot.
Indignation is expressed among the men at the provisions issued. For
breakfast the men receive one pint of coffee and some dry bread or biscuit.


Dinner consists of boiled meat, and water to drink; and for tea one pint of
tea and dry bread or biscuit. Sometimes jam is issued, a quarter of a
pound to each man for the day, but this is a luxury, and not often seen.
The troops are expecting to make a move from this camp every day.
There are over 1500 troops camped here. Copies of the “Daily Telegraph”
are greatly appreciated by all the Tasmanians here.
Writing to Mr. Maher, of St. John-street, Launceston, from Enslin,
under date December 19, Private Alfred Button, of Evandale, says : —“Most
of the members of the contingent are well, but six are in the hospital. The
climate is very hot, and the sandy, dry character of the country does not
seem to agree with all the Tasmanians. Water is scarce, and sometimes
not very good either. It has to be brought by train, or else obtained by
sinking wells. We are now learning the hardest side of a soldier’s life, and
becoming acquainted with the hardship he endures on active service. I
will be glad when the war is over, and do not think it will last very long, as
General Buller means to close in on Pretoria shortly. The Boers have
lost their best stand, which had taken them weeks to build. I have seen
their positions at Orange River, Belmont, Graspan, and Enslin. We
arrived at Capetown on the 26th, and left the boat next day. We camped
at Maitland, four miles out of Capetown, rested there four days, and received
the issue of the Lee-Metford magazine rifle in place of our own Martini-
Enfields. Both have the same bore, .303, but the former have new dagger
bayonets, but lam afraid we won’t have much chance to use them. We
could see the lyddite shells bursting in the air from the kopje above our
camp in the battle of Spytfontein, a mile this side of Kimberley. We are
guarding the railway line and telegraph wire, which were destroyed when
we came here, but have since been repaired by the Royal Engineers.”
In a letter to an acquaintance in Launceston, Bugler Davis writes from
Enslin under date December 19: —“We are now 696 miles inland. . . .
After our encampment at Maitland, we were ordered to De Aar, and arrived
at midnight, when we were ordered on to the Orange River. We camped
at the latter place five days, and then received orders to go on to Enslin,
a distance of 42 miles. We marched 26 miles in 24 hours, including a rest
by the roadside for a couple of hours at midnight. We arrived at Belmont
at 9 o’clock in the morning, and all were pretty well done up. We had
nothing to do in the afternoon, so had a look over the battlefield. This
is the first place where the British had what they call a fight. We went up
to the kopjes where the struggle took place, and found a few Boers hardly
buried under the soil. The country up to Orange River is very bad,
scarcely a blade of grass from Capetown to the river, but from there to
where we are camped it improves a lot. We are about 15 miles from Mod-
der River, and from our outposts we can see and hear the naval guns firing.
There was a great fight up there on Thursday, when the British had to
retire. The Black Watch suffered the worst. They lost all their officers
but six. The Gordon Highlanders lost their colonel, and they came back
to our camp terribly disappointed. They told us it was the first time they


have had to retire. They thought they were going to do the same as they
always have done—go straight through and win—but when they got within
a hundred yards of the Boers the order was given to retire. They did not
know who gave the command. When they were at a safe distance they
were formed up in hollow square, and the general, in addressing them, said
a great mistake had been made. Who had made it, he said, he did not
know, nor did he or anyone else ever expect to know. He said that he
would not attack again with infantry for a while, but would bring all the
artillery he could lay his hands on to the front.
Since being out here we have received only two mails. You would be
surprised to see the number of troops, particularly artillerymen, going to
the front, marching past us every day. I don’t think we will get a show
yet of going right up to the firing line, as we are attached to the Gordon
Highlanders, and they are not to go to the front for some time. There was
great fun in camp the other night. The scouts came in and reported that
the enemy were coming on to attack. There was a great bustle for a while,
and then came orders that we were to go into the trenches up on the kopjes.
We waited there till midnight, but not a sight of a Boer did we see. I
don't know how long we shall be here, but if we get orders to move on we
shall probably proceed to the Orange Free State, so Colonel Hoad tells us.’’
Private Elliott writes as follows to some relatives in the city, under
date December 18:—“ The news of the death of Mr. R. Marshall, the Laun-
ceston city missionary, came as a great shock to many members of the con-
tingent who were intimately acquainted with him. It seems six months
since I left Launceston, and, as things are going, it will probably be five
or six months before we return. We had the pleasure of capturing five
Boers on Monday, and had great trouble with them. I had to mount
guard over them, and, it is needless to say, I had to watch myself. An
elderly Boer tried to “get at” me, and I am afraid only for the arrival of the
colonel that I would have been forced to use my bayonet. Several times I
was menaced, and at length we had to put him in irons. We are now only
12 miles from Kimberley, and a few miles from Modder River. A great
battle has been going on at Spytfontein, about seven miles distant, since
Monday, and we catch glimpses of it from here. There has been terrible
slaughter on both sides, but from present indications the Boers are getting
the worst of it. It is said that the enemy lost close on 4,000, and the
British casualties are put down at 300. It is the biggest fight since the
war started. We have not had a shot at the Boers yet. The roar of the
big guns can be heard distinctly from our camp, and we often see the shells
striking and shattering the rocks. There is a constant demand on us by
refugees for assistance, and at the present time we have about 100 civilians
(men and women) in camp. I won’t be sorry when the war is over. It is
terribly hot, and lam getting as thin as a broomstick. You would hardly
know the members of the contingent. Shaving is an unknown luxury, with
the result that all are growing beards, and we look a dirty lot. The com-
missariat arrangements are not at all complete, and consequently there is


some grumbling. We have to purchase milk from the blacks, and it costs
us gd per pint. We receive very little intelligence here from the outside
world, and as for the war—well, I think you know more about it in Tas-
mania than we do. We have to guess what is going on away from our
immediate vicinity.”
FROM THE LATE CORPORAL BETTS.
A LAST LETTER.
(Reprinted from “Mercury.”)
0.F.5., Kroonstad, May 17, 1900.
“Dear Father,—l managed to get a horse after all, so left with the
mounted men when they set out from Bloemfontein on the 21st ult. It
took ns three days to reach Karee Kloof, about 50 miles from the capital,
and about six miles from the Boer lines. On the 24th ult. we went in a
strong force to reconnoitre the Boer position. A few shots were exchanged
between our scouts and their patrols, but no damage was done!
On the 30th ult. we went out again in full form, and got more than we
wanted. At first we drove in the Boer patrol, and advanced some distance,
when they began to fire a couple of big guns into us.
At one time I thought we were going to suffer. We got into a cross-
fire from the two Boer guns, and for a few moments you heard nothing but
screeching and exploding shells. One shrapnel burst just over our horses,
and the bullets seemed to strike amongst them as a handful of shot does in
a pool of water. Luckily, the men were in front firing, so there was only
one man to four horses. When the shell exploded, I expected to see some-
one fall, but, apparently, no one was hurt.
We were without big guns at the time, so had to retire, halting and
firing as we retired. As we were retiring from our second halt, a couple
of our fellows became dismounted by one horse bolting, and another being
shot in the leg. One fellow scrambled up in front of my horse and laid
across the pommel; as he was no light weight, the position was very laugh-
able—like a sack of flour in front. We got away without any accident. As
we retired towards our outpost, a couple of our guns on the kopjes began to
tell, so the Boers returned to their position. We remained on the veldt
until nightfall, when we found we had seven horses wounded. One was
shot from side to side through the saddle-cloth, while another was shot
through the head, and a third through the withers. My horse received a
slight wound in the leg from a shrapnel.
The range at which we were firing varied from 1800 yards to the limit
of sighting.
The Boer firing seemed to be short. I saw a bullet strike about five
yards to my right. It did not ricochet, but turned over a few inches and
remained. From this I think it would be better to fire high, because, if
the bullets were too high to strike the men while firing, they may strike the
horses in rear, and, without a horse, one man is out of action for a time, and
sometimes two men, as it often means “double-banking” another horse to


save the man whose horse is damaged. Besides, at a long range the bullets
would not be far beyond the mark, as they fall at an angle of about 45deg.
The Boers advanced and fired on their horses.
The Lumsden’s Horse got cut up a bit.
It is said there were between forty and fifty casualties on our side, but
i cannot say. None of the Tassies were touched, although there were a
couple of narrow escapes. One man had his water-bottle hanging to the
saddle perforated by a bullet, and his trousers brushed by it. Another man
had his water-bottle struck.
On the 3rd we were turned out at 2.30 a.m., leaving camp at 4 a.m.,
with three days’ provisions.
Firing commenced about 8 a.m. We were on the right all day, and
did not fire a shot, nor was one fired at us. The Boers were driven back,
and we advanced about ten miles. Most of the work was done by the left.
We kept on the move till the 10th, coming in touch with the enemy
now and again. Last Wednesday, the 9th, we came up with the outpost
of the Boers, and halted next day, as we had a rather awkward river to cross,
the Zand.
Thursday, 10th inst. —We were on the move by daylight, and got over
the river without much difficulty, a few shots being exchanged on both
sides.
As soon as we began to move ahead, things became rather lively. We
were told off to the left. It was not long before we came in for some shell-
ing. At first they shelled the bank over which we had advanced. Perhaps
they thought we were a cover for a gun. But soon they began to pick up
our range, so we retired.
No damage was done, but I did not feel inclined to laugh when a shell
lodged and exploded within four yards of the rear of my horse. The horse
gave a jump, and I thought it quite becoming to conform to its movements.
In the afternoon we had a little rifle shooting, and the Major had the hard
luck to get a bullet through his arm; I suppose it was the only bullet that
came our way. The Major did not take any notice of it. In the evening
we came in for more shell firing. This time we were a cloak for the artil-
lery, and were stationed in a patch of maize. They had two guns playing
on us. It was rather an anxious moment. As the ground was soft, the
shells buried themselves before exploding. As soon as our artillery com-
menced firing the Boer guns became silent.
The Major has been ordered to hospital, so I doubt whether we will
see him again till the finish. French entered here at 12 o’clock last Friday
night. We came in next afternoon. The Boers evacuated the town,
which is a very small place.
Edwards and Chalmers are in good form. Major Murray, of New
South Wales, has been appointed to take command of us, so it is said. Any-
way, he is camped with us. With best love and kind remembrance to all.—
I am, your affectionate son,
Harry Betts.”


George Tairbrass Richardson, son of Major George Richardson, Com-
missioner of Police, Hobart, was born on the 22nd August, 1877. He joined
the draft of the first contingent as a private from the Zeehan Rifle Company.
Previous to his joining the latter force he served three years in the Southern
Tasmanian Artillery, gaining an efficiency certificate each year. He went
out under Captain Riggall, whom he always mentioned in his letters home
in the highest terms, and eulogised him for the great interest he exhibited
in the men s welfare, and for the way in which he looked after them. On
arrival at the Cape, and after staying a short time at Victoria West, he, with
the others of the draft, left there on the 14th April, when he found only 56
of the first contingent remaining, the others being in the hospital and miss-
ing. He continued with the contingent, and suffered with the others the
usual hardships and exposure attending on war. In describing some of
the experiences on the march from Bloemfontein to Pretoria, he says in one
of his letters : Do not think lam sick of the life by the description. It is
quite the reverse. I never had such a picnic in my life, and am enjoying
the very best of health. I have not had a day’s illness since I have been
in South Africa.’ This time the Tasmanians were part of Lord Roberts’s
advance-guard. On the 29th day he received his first baptism of fire, and
I give } ou the description in his own words : —“On Tuesday, 29th, we made
an early start for Johannesburg. Plenty of outpost shooting was heard.
I saw a train going for all it was worth. At 8.55 a.m., we were making
for a ridge of a hill with J Battery at a quiet trot, when all of a jump we
were fired on, first with pom-poms, to find the range, then with 12-pounders.
The first shell struck close to the last gun, and the gunners took no notice
of it, and we had to do likewise. Following on this we got it pretty hot.
Shells came all around, and on one occasion between the two ranks. A
good many of them missed bursting. Two bullets came and ploughed the
-ground up under my horse’s feet.” He was in the firing line, off and on, all
the time up to the middle of September, when he was wounded in the leg
by an expanding bullet at Machadorp, and invalided to Johannesburg. The
following is an extract from his letter, in which he gives a description of the
scrap in which he was wounded in the thigh, and in which Trooper Bailey
was killed :—“I will tell you how the whole thing happened. About Bor 9
a.m. a strong body of mounted men, with a pom-pom, under Colonel Henry,
went out to clear some hills and gullies of a few of the enemy who we heard
were left behind. We were in advance, and we must have done a march of
10 to 15 miles (I might mention the pom-pom capsized, and when it was
wanted it was out of range; while they were getting it up we were still
marching on), and the Major made us charge a kopje wth fixed bayonets,
and we found nothing there, so after that Captain Brown sent four of us
to go up on a very smooth kopje to have a look round. We advanced at
thirty paces interval in the following order:—Bailey on the right, myself
second, A. Horton third, Sergeant Lee on the left. The beggars were
splendidly concealed, and we got right to the foot of the hill, and could have
•only been 100 yards off, or 150 at the most, when all at once came a crack,


crack, all round us. My horse was hit in the head first shot, and I could
not get him round; all he would do was to rear up, which he did once or
twice, and then I got a poke in the leg and fell off my horse. 1 sang out
when I was hit, and Bailey cut past me and asked me where I was hit.
He had not got very far when he, poor fellow, was hit in the brain. I did
not know about this until later. Well, our fellows in the rear kept them
from getting up and having a shot at me while I was on the ground, and
they roused them off and carried me .well to the rear (my leg was quite
useless to me) and laid me alongside of Bailey, who was unconscious. The
doctor was soon there, and on sight told us it was all over with Bailey.
When he did what he could for him he started on me, found the bone was
not broken, but did not know whether it had been touched, and the bullet
was still in my leg. He bandaged me up, and tied my leg to a rifle, and
I was then carried for about two miles on three rifles by my comrades to a
‘Dhanjibhoy,’ and then had a drive across country for about ten miles. It
was dark long before we reached our destination. Bailey died in the
‘Dhanjibhoy’ with me at about 6 p.m. He was one of the hirst Contingent,
and was a fine young fellow, and had only joined us two days previous to
this. He had been away in the hospital with enteric. I had been messing
along with him ever since we left Kroonstadt. They left us at the South
Australian Camp, as it was five miles less to go than our own. The
South Australians could not do enough for us, and turned the camp upside
down. They rigged up a ‘kipsie’ (a small tent) for me, and gave me every-
thing I wanted, cnly unfortunately I did not feel inclined for much. The
next morning they buried Bailey, and did it properly. They gave him a
proper firing partv, and decorated his grave with small white stones, and
put a large flat stone at his head, and a wooden cross covered with tin at
his feet; and the tin was perforated with ‘Private Bailey, Tasmanian
Mounted Infantry, 1900, R.I.P.’ I believe a photograph was taken of it
and sent to Tasmania. They told me the name of the place was Moorns
Spruit; they told me this in case his people would like to place a headstone
over his grave. Dr. Jim was very pleased with the way the South
Australians treated us, and the pains they took over the grave. At 12
a.m. a bullock wagon came for me to take me back to Machadodorp, 18
miles away. I knew what the roads were like, and when I saw the empty
wagon I thought to myself I am going to have a lively 18 miles of it,
and I did. Thev certainly made three shifts of it for me, and sent an
Army Medical Corps down with me. Every time the wagon would
go over a stone it gave my leg particular fits, but I eventually got to
Machadodorp at 10 o’clock the next morning. They put me into the
hospital, which used to be the hotel, and the first thing they did was to
give me a wash all over, which I wanted, I can tell you. On Friday, ifitlb
was the day the bullet had to come out, and Doctor Forde, a Captain in the
Royal Army Medical Corps, with two Major Doctors in attendance and
Doctor Jamieson.” After a couple of months he had sufficiently re-
covered to be invalided home to Tasmania in the S.S. Wairera. On the
formation of the 2nd Imperial Contingent, in the early part of 1901, he


was appointed the Senior Lieutenant, and left Tasmania in the S.S.
Chicago, and served with that Contingent during the time of its stay in
South Africa, having command of one of the Squadrons in the absence
of its Captain. He was mentioned in Despatches from Lord Kitchener.
On the return of this contingent he remained in South Africa, and for a
time was attached to Doyle’s Scouts, and on peace being proclaimed he
received an appointment in the Repatriation Camp at Volksrust, which he
holds at the present time.
Experiences in South Africa
BY TROOPER E. McGUINNESS. FIRST TASMANIAN
CONTINGENT.
When we landed in South Africa we were very soon acquainted with
the sun’s warmth in that part. We were inarched out on the pier and
formed up where there had been any amount of coal handled. We were
then in heavy marching order; the straps were touching me up a bit. We
had needless cross straps which were doing no good, and stopping the
circulation. I could have marched away easily enough, but could not
stand there as though we were cut in alabaster. I turned to my brother,
who was very near me, saying, I would give £5 if they would march away,
but only the sun replied with extra severity to the back of my neck, and
the next thing I remember was a fearful rumbling noise, and a terrible
pressure as though I was six fathoms under the sea. As my senses were
returning I thought I was dying, not then knowing that I had fainted. I
next could see Sergeant-Major Costello before me, telling some of the
soldiers to undo my collar. By the appearance of my uniform, one would
have thought I had had a contract to sweep chimneys. Major Cameron
very considerately offered me some kind of a lozenge, which gave me great
help, and in less than 10 minutes I was in the ranks, and marching toward
Green Point, or rather Maitland, where we were to remain a few days for
equipment. We afterwards entrained for somewhere, I don't think that
any Australian knew where. I might say our force then consisted of
500 men, who were all Infantry, with the exception of a Company of
Victorian Mounted Infantry; the rest being West Australians, South Aus-
tralians, Victorians, and Tasmanians. We passed through De Aar and
unshipped at Orange River. We then started to Belmont, and marched
all day ; then, as night drew near, we were told we had to continue the march
all night; and we were also informed that we would probably fall in with
2000 of Cronje’s men, who were getting away from Magersfontein to join
other Commandoes. I shall never forget that night, as we laboured on
with fixed bayonets all night. I honestly longed for the dawn of another
day. which might, perhaps, give us a better prospect than that which we
were facing on that memorable occasion. However, we found ourselves
still pressing on. Plenty of our men grew tired, and, despite everything,
would drop off to sleep in our 10 minutes’ interval. But there was no
THE FIRST CONTINGENT.


sleep for me. I heard every sound in the distance. I grew irritable and
nervous because some of our men dared to sleep, and that when the fight
came there would be less men to resist the enemy. I realised that night
what war really was. But in this hour of my trial I can very confidently
say my heart was still good. I never in all my experiences wished myself
safely at home. Nevertheless, I thought we were very inadequate for this
piece of work. We formed up several times during the night, imagining
the Boers were upon us. I could imagine our confusion, how very un-
disciplined we were; how Australian would kill Australian, and how Boer
would kill Boer. No man could discern friend from foe, and friends in
the din of the conflict and darkness would be our worst enemies. I felt
the point of my bayonet, and thought truly we had made them nice and
sharp, but we were dashed lucky if we were not the first to get a poke with
them. But still they pressed on, and they all looked brave. Perhaps
I did myself; but as for their experiences, well, I can only give one.
Ihe next day we halted at Belmont and camped. We had seen no
Boers ; our skins were entirely whole. I strolled away from the rest, and
in a nice little sunny corner I sat down to think, and to take stock of
myself, leaving the company for more able minds. I laughed a bit to
myself, and vowed after the previous night I would never meet trouble
half-way, and concluded my meditations by saying—allowing that I was a
rational being—there would be mighty little fighting done in the night.
Daylight fighting, therefore, would be the order of the day. A far happier
thought that. I felt grand, what man had done I could do. I was quite
willing to try. My courage seemed to rise to a bursting condition. I
had passed through the fiery furnace and had come out harder and better,
although I kept it to myself. I thought we were fully fledged soldiets
then. I had never realised this before.
This place revealed to us what we had never seen before; dead men
were lying about. About three days prior to our coming in the Battle of
Belmont had been fought. Our Major, who was at this time Captain in
rank, came across one unburied Boer, and imagining he was a solitary,
asked for volunteers to help him make him a little tomb vault from the
many stones lying around. Of course every man, nearly, volunteered, but
we knew of many more who were not fortunate enough to have graves duo-
for them; but we were mute about that lot. They were a bit high, you
know; rather superfluously seasoned for Tasmanians. These dead Boers
were all in private clothes.
Our next move was to Enslin, a railway siding some 30 miles distance
from Kimberley. We passed through Grasspan as we were coming here.
The slain were much in evidence here, but no more burying for the Tassies,
we were too old for that now, especially if they were on towards a week
old. We could see from here the battle of Magersfontein, and saw the
shells bursting all along the range of kopjes. By and by the Gordon
Highlanders came down to us, maimed, and lame, and weary, leaving many
of their dead brothers on the battlefield. As they were lying out in the
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.


boiling sun in touch with the enemy, the sun skinned their legs where they
were not covered with their kilts, drawing their sinews in the knees, and
making them objects of much commiseration. We were privileged to
offer them some assistance in carrying their water, and putting up their
tents, a service they have not forgotten to this day, for whenever they saw
us afterwards they hailed “Good old Tassies.” Time ran on, we had been
at Enslin about three weeks. We were getting very discontented. We
thought we were condemned without a trial as regards fighting, and had
simply been dropped here on a line of communication, taking for granted
that we were suited for nothing else. However, a change came; news had
come from somewhere. The men were all fallen in, all officers were at
their post, and Colonel Hoad had something to say. “It had been
thought essential to mount all Colonials. Were all the men agreeable?”
The modest “Yes” came out rather quickly.
The next move was a trifle premature. About 80 mules were brought
out. The men were compelled to lead these cantankerous brutes around
in a large circle. The men were supposed to keep these sulky quads in a
brisk walk, which was quite impossible. I had a perfect plum, with ears
back, and chalky eye; he would have defied the Devil. The Captain’s eye
was upon me, and, of course, there is no allowance made in the army, not
even for a fishy-tempered mule. The next thing was —“McGuinness, what
do you mean? I’ll pull your jaw for you. It strikes me you are the
biggest mule; there is a pair of you, anyhow.” I believe I went white with
anger. Lieutenant Reid was near me, but that made no difference. I
was stirred, and I cursed him openly and inwardly. I expected Mr. Reid
to report me, but he remembered that we all had souls. I had got into
disgrace once with this officer (Mr. Reid) on the Coogee to Melbourne,
but I thought afterwards that he was quite right, and so after this event
Mr. Reid started to go up in my estimation. I spoke openly before Non-
Coms., Sergeant-Major, and men, of Captain Cameron's injustice. I fumed
openly about my disagreement with the whole affair, concluding that the
author of this infernal affair was mad. Very truly the men who got the
Emperor’s zebras ready for him were not mad, because they were paid for
it; but the author of it was. After this we entrained for Naaupoort, going
back to De Aar Junction, and thence to Naaupoort, where our horses were
to be in readiness. Some horses were served out there, but the Tas-
manians had to go to Rensburg, about 26 miles north towards Orange
River, on the way to Pretoria, and there got their mounts.
The Tasmanians, or about 40 of them, under Captain Cameron, were
sent out to Jasfontein, a farm about seven miles east of Rensburg. The
West Australians were put at Slingersfontein, not so far east, and the
Victorians were put on the extreme west, about seven miles from Rens-
burg, at Maiber’s Farm. My brother and I, and two or three more, with a
few details of Victorians, West Australians, and South Australians, were
sent out to join Captain Cameron, about 10 men in all, in command of
Captain Salmon, of Victoria. When we reached Jasfontein we found that
THE FIRST CONTINGENT.


that day we were to face the enemy for the first time. Three divisions of
Troopers were got ready, about 15 or 16 men in each patrol. Captain
Cameron’s patrol, Captain Hamilton, of the Guides; and Captain Salmon,
of the Victorians; in all 50 strong.
OUR FIRST FIGHT.
We started out about a mile from the farmhouse, passing a large kopje
on the right, on which we had an outpost of about 10 men. Soon, as we
rounded the kopje, and rode up the plain, we could hear shooting in the
distance, the rifles’ sound coming from our left about a mile along a range
of hills leading parallel from us. Major Cameron’s men were on the left,,
and Captain Hamilton on the right, and Captain Salmon’s men the centre.
My brother and I were with Captain Salmon. The firing became hotter,
so we put spurs to the horses to leave these warm corners behind us. The
horses were very fresh, and one or two of our worst riders had some
difficulty in keeping their seats. Corporal Reynolds was quite powerless
to control his. It galloped here, there, and all over the shop with him.
1 never saw a man look more distressed. He lost his hat at last.
He was fairly broken up, and his horse seemed inclined to take him into
the Boer lines. Just at this time we got a messenger through to say Cap-
tain Hamilton was surrounded, and also Captain Cameron’s lot.
The Boers were rushing our men to close quarters, but were losing
a good many men; our boys were too sudden at 50 and 60 yards.
All were lassies, with the exception of four or five in our patrol. The
Boers seemed very much inclined to swarm up the kopje and take our men
by numbers, but already they were losing too many men; besides, our men
were too few to sacrifice so much life for; and again and again their leading
men were falling. Their next move was to shoot the horses, but the
Tassies were not all together. As about 30 Boers were crossing the gap to
get to the horses, two of their number fell, The rest slunk back, and took
refuge behind the ridge. Captain Salmon gave orders to ride to the
kopjes immediately before us, where the other two parties were. We
galloped close up under the kopjes, all abreast, but the red dust hid us
from the enemy, which was very fortunate for us, for it made guess work
for the Boers, when they concentrated their fire on us. The Boers at this
time were between us and our men, and made it impossible for us to-
junction, but the enemy were so astonished at the quickness of the move,
and at the same time entirely bewildered as to what would follow, that they
did not observe our besieged parties effecting their escape; and as our
leader had given the word to right about, retire, Captain Cameron’s men,
and Captain Hamilton s, were all pouring out too. Everv man retired in
his own way in extended order, some taking the right and left. But some
of our brave boys were missing, two of our soldiers were shot dead, and
Mr. Lambie, a reporter, who was with us, was also killed, and four more of
our men were taken prisoners. It was here, too, where one of our men
got cut off, had his horse shot, and obliged to fight his way out, which

he did very bravely. It is reported that he despatched three of his foes
while following on foot from the scene of action, and I doubt not for one
moment the assertion, knowing the warm corner where Victor Peers was
located. He had assisted one of his mates, whose horse had been thrown
in a wire fence, but in the hour of his need he was not thought of by his
mates, who, strange to say, had not noticed when he was rendered horseless.
We all had a very narrow squeak, but we were doomed to have another
before the day was ended. Captain Cameron had smelt gunpowder, and
seemed quite as anxious to take it. When we all rallied on the plain,
out of range of the hills, he gave orders to touch the kopjes which were
on the right of us, as we were going out, and were hostile enough, if rifle
fire were any criterion to go by. But we got quite over to the hills, and
riding through a gap took possession of a small kopje. The enemy seemed
a bit quiet, but they knew we were on their heels. Close by the kopjes,
and along the plain where we had passed before our first attack, was a
farmhouse. We guessed that this place was a stronghold for the enemy,
because the previous day a small patrol of our men got it pretty warm ;
they had ventured too close. The result was a Remington was shot, and
Bob Gillies got one through the hat. Bob was under the average as
regards height, so had cause to congratulate himself.
Captain Cameron noticed half a dozen men riding in our direction
from the farm, and immediately gave orders for six of our men to ride up
and kill, or take them prisoners. We were to engage them at hand to
hand fighting if they would not surrender. Our best men, I think, had
been sent along to the end of the low kopje, but in addition to horseholders
there were about 10 or 12 men who were disengaged. I was holding four
horses myself. But this little band of warriors didn’t seem to be forth-
coming. I felt very ashamed to see the hesitation, and felt angry too.
I jumped up, tied three of the horses together, and mounted my mare for
one. In a minute we were starting, but our muster was four —Lieutenant
Reid, Corporal Whitelaw, F. Page, and myself. The Boers caught sight
of us coming out in battle array, and wheeled back to the farm. Page
then held our horses, and we three scaled the hills lower down. We took
up a nice position in the rocks. I noticed about 50 Boers riding through
a little break very near us. I drew Mr. Reid’s attention to them, He
seemed delighted. He thought our time had come to make a name for
ourselves. “Right, we shall have a good show at that lot. Get ready
but don’t fire till I tell you.” The Boers were about 80 yards from us, and
making in the direction of the farm. This would have brought them
within 30 yards of us, as they passed under the kopje.
Just at this moment someone was sent to us for a general retire;
the Boers were swarming on our men from above. We had cut it very
fine. We were on our horses very quickly, but already our men were a
long way out on the plain, bullets whistling over their heads in all direc-
tions. Captain Cameron came down to us, and we five retired together.
IHE FIRST CONTINGENT.


We kept our horses apart as much as possible. The bullets striking
the dust ahead, and between us, showed that they were trying very hard
to bring us down.
I should have mentioned that Corporal Whitelaw in our first encounter
stopped to assist a man who had been thrown from his horse, exhibiting
much coolness and gallantry. This unfortunate was the before-mentioned
Corporal Reynolds.
According to our own calculations, we must have shot 20 Boers this
day. The “ Diggers’ News,” a Boer paper, acknowledged that number,
and they were careful not to overrate their own losses.
We will pass on now to Reitfontein. We were in front of this place
for several days. The Boers were opposing us from the ranges in front.
They gave us plenty of pom-pom every day as we were hovering in front
of their position. But one morning they sent a couple of guns to aid us
a bit. So we set out, and rode close up to their position. The Uitenage—
or some name like that, I don’t exactly know; we used to call them the
rotten eggs—they were supposed to do the scouting, and we the supports.
This Imperial squadron were very poor scouters; they hung too close
around the supports. Captain Cameron had sent along two or three times
to their leader to get his men further ahead. At last he grew tired of it.
He then sent me and three more on the left to ride up to this low range
where the Boers were holding the previous day. The Imperial officer
began to get disappointed and annoyed with his men, and as we darted
ahead of them and searched the kopjes, he said, “ Follow the b Tas-
manians ; you can’t lead them.” However, we broke through the hills
at this particular part without any opposition, and then rode across the
plain, keeping a fair distance away from some kopjes on the right, where
the Boers were giving us plenty of rifle fire, with an occasional pom-pom
or two.
We kept out round this lot, then passed away down a wide passage
of plain, leaving kopjes on either side of us. The two guns were brought
through and into the open, but did not follow us down the passage. The
Imperial U were still supposed to be scouting, but their services were
getting all worse and no better, and they had drifted right back into our
line, which made a line of horses about a mile long. We were about 30
yards apart.
Already small parties of about 50 and 60 Boers were seen by some
of the men changing their positions, and this was communicated to Captain
Cameron, and he himself had seen numbers of men riding in the hills
and imagined they were British. The wirecutters were sent out to gap
a fence which was coming abreast our horses leading to the kopjes, where
the men were tumbling about awaiting our reception. I was among the
number who carried wire-cutters. We were making gaps about 100 yards
apart. I had just cut a very nice gap and allowed a few troops to pass
through when I heard one of our men fire at a party coming along the
ridge. I didn’t look up; I reckoned we would get it warm very shortly,
and hurried in making a little extra clearance of the entangled wire.
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.


I was well away on the left. Captain Cameron was on the right, and
my brother, who was on the right near the captain, told me the follow-
ing: —Captain Cameron saw a number of Boers in front of him and asked
my brother what they were, and he replied they were Boers. Captain
Cameron said, “ I think not; they are friends.” But he must have changed
his mind. Next minute he ordered, “Jump off and give them a volley.”
The men responded, giving the Boers a lively time; but next minute the
enemy, seeing the game was up, opened out all along our line from right
to left. The noise of the rifles was immense. Alf. Huff’s horse broke
away from the holder, and cleared out for all his worth. The men were
come into a hot nest, and had to get out as best they could. The men
were all retiring square off the same way as they came in. Captain
Cameron said to Huff, “ Take my horse and get out of it.” Huff remon-
strated for a while, saying, “The horse is strong, sir; he will carry us
both.” “Doas I tell you,” roared the captain; “be off.” The man rode
away, gloomily enough, I’ll vow. We had a long gallop. When we got
almost out of range we got another very hot cross-fire. Two horses were
shot, Alty Parker’s and an Imperial’s. Captain Wallace Brown picked up
one of the men and allowed him to ride on the saddle behind him, the
behind man pushing his rescuer almost off the horse, causing great weari-
ness and distress, so much so that they both rolled from the saddle.
When all the men got together they found the captain was missing, and
only two or three knew of this very singular story.
My comment on the matter is this : That Captain Cameron did wrong
in throwing himself away in such a manner. It was his place as leader of
the men to look after them, to preserve himself for his men’s sake, and not
make another man look small in having to blab out to his companions
that he had saved himself at his captain’s expense; and that this leader, for
some reason of his own, remains behind to fire a few cartridges at
the enemy, and when those few cartridges are spent is reported to have
begun on the Boers with his fists—which report I disbelieve. If I did that
myself, and won such laurels in public opinion for the act, people could
call me the best man under the sun, and say I was a true Briton, yet 1
would allow to myself that I was a fool. Yes, I would much rather have
seen Captain Cameron ride out, to lead his men another day. After our
captain was taken we were attached to the Remington Guides, and we
enjoyed the grand rides that this new experience afforded us. We had
some very peculiar cases of sorrow on the part of Boer women when
taking someone connected with them who had formerly been fighting, and
whom we were arresting as rebels. The tears and cries of the women were
very touching. We set out on an expedition to look for five of our men
who were missing. They had gone out and had not returned. Home-
ward came back after a while bringing in a darkie who had told him a story
about a number of Boers driving off horses and cattle about five miles
from camp, and were heading them over the Orange River, about 23 miles
from Colesburg. We set out immediately for the place, Lieutenant
Heritage and five men, including myself and the darkie.
THE FIRST CONTINGENT.


The Kaffir brought us up to a farm house on a nice flat, but secluded
from us by a very rocky ranges but we got access to it through a gap, and
then putting spurs to our horses, we surrounded the house in two minutes.
I rushed my horse’s head into the back door, while our officer took the
front, which fronted us as we rode up, and as I was peering through the
house, with gun in ready position, Heritage was coming in the front door.
revolver in hand, his eyes not deigning to behold the pretty girls all
around him, but blazing and expectant, and searching every corner of the
house. I couldn’t help smiling as I saw his nostrils extended, and his
whole bearing thoroughly indicative of a warrior on the warpath.
I forgot to mention that we had exchanged horses, so as I am going
back to my story I will give the reason. Lieutenant Heritage had got hold
of a Boer’s saddle. It was new, and of course looked very nice indeed.
It seemed more of the jockey principle than anything else. But our leader
was nearly thrown a dozen times this morning, as the pace was rather
furious.
“ Here, M‘Guinness, take this horse of mine and see if you can manage
him; you are a good rider.” So returning to the ladies, whom we had
almost paralysed with fear, Heritage asks in awful tones, “ Where are
the men in this place?” They were too frightened to speak, although they
could talk very fair English.
The girl which was very near to me had her arms lifted, and could not
get them back in position. I never saw anyone more helpless or more
horror-stricken. Her eyes came in my direction, and I assured her we
would not hurt them. Our two other men were out 100 yards from the
back and front, in case we were shot. Just at this time Alf. Homeward
beckoned me from his post. I made over to him as fast as I could. He
says, “ There are about 20 Boers mounted down at that farm. They
have ridden down the garden fence, and then back into the yard.” I went
back and reported it to Mr. Heritage. He made one bound and on his
horse. “ Come on, lads. Green, Banks, and Homeward, keep guard over
this place.” We started away in a hurry. The horses were excited, and
I felt certain Heritage wouldn’t have a show with my mare. It always
made my arms ache to hold her, and I was a better rider and stronger than
he. Almost every day when watering the animals, as it was the custom to
lead one and ride the other bare-backed, it was very often the cry, “There
goes M'Guinness’s mare, bolted with someone.” Soon Heritage was
going straight for the farm, which was about three-quarters of a mile
away, galloping madly; the mare was off in earnest. We spurred our
horses, and galloped for all we were worth, yet we could not come up
alongside of him. I shall never forget that nigger out on our left a bit,
sjamboking his pony, and looking on at us with his white teeth grinning,
and striving to keep pace with us. Georgy Walker and I wanted to be
there at the finish —we thought three would have a better show than one—
and as the mare slackened a trifle we dashed into the yard as soon as
our leader. We examined the house, and got only one Boer, with a few
firearms. What Homeward had seen were ostriches.
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.


Our trip back was very funny. We were ordered to take men and
women too from around the borders, as the Boers often got communica-
tions through the women. So our party consisted of three girls, two
elderly women, and one man. One woman, judging from the likeness,
was undoubtedly the mother of the young man who was our prisoner.
We gave up our horses to the three girls—Georgy Walker, Lieutenant
Heritage, and myself—the elderly ladies feeling more safe on the ground.
We took the shortest cut to camp, passing along the side of Baboon Kop.
The girls who were mounted seemed to take very little notice of their
situation. They rode about 100 yards ahead of us. They were good
riders, and if it had not been for their friends on the ground I reckon they
would have politely said “Good-bye.” No good Britisher would have
fired within 20ft. above their heads. If it had not been for the loss of
my horse I would have liked to see them go. They were better mounted
than the other two of our boys who had horses, and the girls were lighter,
so it would have been a good chase.
It seemed very hard to take mothers and daughters from their nice
homes; those empty homes to be left to the mercy of the soldiers to
plunder and break everything they came across. I even saw Christian
pictures that had been pulled from the walls and broken, and strewn all
among the feathers of ducks and geese, and the remnant of various other
things littered through those beautiful rooms, all giving such conclusive
evidence of the vileness of the spoilers. I was the first to enter their house
and to see it in its beauty and refinement. But oh, to see it a fortnight
hence! What wreck and what ruin! If those women had only known.
One of the elderly ladies felt all this, I’m sure. It was a very pitiable
sight, and one which I shall never forget, to see the young man and his
mother walking together. They spoke very little indeed. What a terrible
trouble and sorrow had now befallen them! They had all in one moment
to realise and meet it. They were already being driven far away from their
home—the home where they had left everything, perhaps never more
entitled to one single article that it contained. The mother, who was
getting old, and needed comfort, would have no home. The son, who
probably had been fighting, would be tried as a rebel, perhaps shot, or
banished for ever from his country. And, above all, they loved each other,
and in one brief hour they must be parted for ever.
One rather amusing thing happened on the way, in which our gallant
officer was worsted. He had a fashion of substituting names to the girls
when addressing them, such as Milly, Nelly, Ada, and such like.
He says, “Were you not afraid when we rushed the house, Gerty?
“ Yes,” she admitted.
Our officer seemed a bit sweet on this girl, and had been walking by
her side for some time as she rode along. I'm aware of this fact, because
he called me back because the girls seemed more free, and inclined to
talk to me more than to this gentleman. His own words: “ Keep behind
with those who are walking, M'Guinness; we can see what we are up to
then.” I suppose he thought he could see what I was up to.
THE FIRST CONTINGENT.


“ If you had had a gun would you have shot me?”
“ Yes,” she answered.
“But you wouldn't now, would you?” This last with a nice little
affectionate look and smile.
“ Yes, I would,” she replied, quickly, without even a pretence to look
pleasant.
“ Here you are, then,” he answered, with a blush, as he handed her
the rifle.
She took the gun a little abstractedly, then handed it back again, this
time with a smile.
A word or two here about Lieutenant Reid. Up to May 2nd
he was officer for our section. He took ill about the same time as myself,
which was about this date; we both had enteric. I got into disgrace once
with this officer, but I think it was my own fault, so I forgave him for that.
But afterwards he always seemed like a friend to me. I was often to
blame about many things, and breaking some of the commandments, that
were many. But when it came to work I was willing, always there, and
tried to do it thoroughly, whether it was night watch, attack, or any other
duty, and I got to be one of Mr. Reid’s favourites, I’m sure. He always
was, and always had been, very strict with every soldier, believed in dis-
cipline, but not humbug, and I believe he was generally liked. One time
I reckoned I was in for it for disobeying almost a direct command. I
thought I should get stable picket for a fortnight—that is, to keep watch
over the horses every night—for punishment; but I owned up quick and
lively, nothing was said, and I thought my sentence was pending. How-
ever, nothing came of it, and after knowing this that my fault had been
looked over, it proved to be a better lesson to me than any other which I
had been taught over there. I wouldn't have offended Mr. Reid after that
if I had been paid for it again and again. He was a splendid judge of
horses, and he would have them attended to. Hugh mv
brother s, horse was kept better than any other horse in the lines, accord-
ing to Mr. Reid’s own words. I gave mine as much attention, but some-
how she never looked so well dressed as his. We were distinguished by
oar officer this way . My brother Hugh was MHuinness ;I, M < Guinness
H \\ hen we reached Bloemfontein in April I was recommended for
promotion from Mr. Reid.
Our captain at this point had reached us again, and they were all
generally pleased to see him. He had recovered from his wound, which
he had received when captured. But Captain Cameron wasn’t “ having
any. He said he had his mind made up about two. Those two were
Stephenson and \ ictor Beers. \ ictor Peers had only just rejoined us
again after his wound at Jasfontein. But I had spoken my mind openly
many a time, and I think it made a difference. Captain Cameron should
have placed some importance on the recommendation of his officers, as
he had yet been with his company so very little. The first seven months
until 1 was smitten with enteric, I always prided myself on having not

missed one duty, either by sickness on the boat, vaccination, or from any
other ailment while I had been in the country.
Captain Cameron made some peculiar selections as regards non-coms.
The men that had most to say, the men that could sing out well “Halt, who
comes there?” and ‘‘Stand, friend, advance one, and give the countersign,”
when they were being instructed had a big chance of promotion. But
our commander had not then learnt that cheek was not courage, and that
a bluffy noise was not a strong heart. And another thing I noticed was
the cooks were generally promoted. If a man could make a fairly good
stew he must be a man of brains, of courage, and endurance. Captain
Cameron was generally good to the men, and most of the men thought
him a great man, and I will give him all that is due. He could speak to
men very kindly, and was a perfect gentleman in some things. But in
this I will not forget him. He always seemed to think and expect men to
be less enlightened, and less intelligent, and less worthy of honour than
himself. He didn't talk much with the men usually, and when he did he
generally struck on some with any amount to say for themselves, and
he would appear to be greatly struck and surprised at the ingenuity and
wisdom which proceeded from these mortals’ lips. Hence his promotions.
We stayed in Bloemfontein two weeks, to be thoroughly equipped
with clothes and a few more remounts to replace others which were falling
out. Here the 45 or draft of the First Contingent overtook us. My bro-
ther Fred had come up with this lot. This addition made three M‘Guinness
brothers. We all ran out to see the Second Contingent, as they were
usually called. My eyes ran up and down the ranks as the men were lined
up to be inspected by Captain Cameron, to see what my brother was
like, but for the life of me I couldn’t see him. His whiskers were grown so
long that he was past identification by me. If anyone had said the man
the nearest, like Ned Kelly, is he I would not have had any difficulty in
knowing him.
Starting from Bloemfontein to Pretoria there was a splendid show of
mounted men, about 6000 strong —Tasmanians, South Australians, West
Australians, Victorians, Canadians, with dashes of Imperial mounted, such
as Loch’s Horse, Lumsden’s Horse, C.I.V. Mounted, etc. These were all
in charge of General Hutton, in combination with Lord Roberts’s big
march to Pretoria. We came in touch with the enemy at Karrie Kloof,
about one day’s march from Bloemfontein. Here we hovered about for a
few days while the attack was being planned. Here was the first place
that I had symptoms of enteric. I first fancied I had caught neuralgia in
the brain through lying out at night watch without my field cap. Day
after day came along, and my pains increased in the head, and I began to
have no appetite at all, and feel generally miserable. It was now
Sunday, and on the morrow we were to have a big fight. This afternoon
I was feeling so ill I lay in the tent, and had given up all hopes of joining
our men on the morrow. A little later the cry came along, “All men
with fit horses stand to them.” All men rushed out, and I followed. I
knew my mare was fit enough if her master wasn’t. I could scarcely see
THE FIRST CONTINGENT .


my horse. The men were numbered, and I determined if I could sit on
my horse in the morning I would go.
That night I remember little. They brought me a letter in; it was
the letter which I was always the most anxious to get. I wanted to know
whom it was from, but my pains only just allowed me to note the address
to see if it was the right one, and 1 then put it in my pocket safely. I woke
up several times in the night and seemed to lay awake hours, and could not
remember anything about South Africa, or where I was. My pains had
turned me delirious.
Monday morning came; we were up and had our horses ready to go
out three hours before daylight. I felt much better early in the morning,
when the fresh, cold wind was blowing on my face. We started and had
ridden a good distance before daylight. At daylight we got a few shots
close in front of us. We were ordered off our horses, and the horses given
over to the holders. We crept up toward the high ground, from whence
the shooting was coming. We were getting it pretty warm. Our men
were firing, too, in return very rapidly. They could see nothing to keep
firing at, so I reserved my fire till we got closer. I felt very discontented
at seeing nothing to fire at, so I knelt up from a creeping position, and I
saw two Boers standing straight up in a little hollow, and firing as quickly
as they could handle their guns. They were about 100 yards from me. I
took aim at one of these quick-shooters, with careful aim. I can't say
was one left, because both had dropped —perhaps one killed or wounded,
and the other fellow thought he was safer in the grass.
The Victorians on our extreme left were getting it warm enough ;
they had several casualties. The Boers were coming in driving numbers
fair in front of us now. Shells were screeching over our heads, and pom-
pom shells were falling all among us. We had with us no artillery. I
believe there was a very strong force of cavalry to have come round on
our right to flank the enemy, but for some reason or other they didn’t
show up till three hours later, the result being that we, after making the
attack, had to drop back again.
It was a perfect battle scene that day—smoke, bullets, and shell very
much in evidence. Things were getting very warm indeed; ammunition
carts were being peppered, and the groups of horses were shelled, making
some of the holders very nervous. At last the word was passed along to
retire, and the men rushed for their horses. Jack Hope was holding one
group of horses—Fred Bryant’s, someone else’s, my own, and his own
horse. As we came up, Hope said, “Your horse is shot. Fred,” and as he
(Bryant) was there first, he at once ran back on foot. I got on my mare
after they all had started to retire, and was heading round to the enemv
side to see if all our men had gone; then I galloped steadily after our men.
and came up to Hope,who was running out of breath and leading his horse.
I imagined he must be wounded through the arm or shoulder and couldn't
mount his horse. “What’s up, Hope?” I said. He exclaimed that his
horse wouldn’t let him mount. I told him to stop and I would assist him.
I then held his horse, took his rifle while he mounted, then handed it
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.


to him again, but he seemed too fatigued and too frightened to hold it.
He then made a dash off full gallop, and dropped his rifle again; this time
he wanted to leave it, but I assured him Captain Cameron would get on
to him if he left it, and I once again held his horse for him. Again seated,
he galloped off furiously. I followed on a bit, and overtook poor old
Harry Betts, with Freddy Bryant lying horizontally across his saddle, one
foot in Harry's stirrup and his stomach resting on the pummel of the
saddle. It was very laughable to see Freddy’s face, with his cheek puffed
out with wind and his mouth closed. Freddy’s whole features plainly said
that he was undergoing grinding torment, but was quite hopeful of sur-
viving it, and Harry Betts’s assuring words were, “I will stick to you,
Fred.”
I often think of poor Harry leaving Hobart. Some little girls came
up to the Barracks to say good-bye to him. He was their teacher. I
took them in to where Mr. Betts was. They never saw him again. Harry
Betts had a very good quality, which made him a very distinguished
soldier. He was always ready to volunteer for any errand that was neces-
sary, where others were slow to speak. Harry’s offer was always given,
though the task might be more unpleasant than hazardous, which latter
might have suited Harry better.
Just after this I looked back in the direction from which we had
retired, and a little to the right I saw a man running, or at the fime I
imagined it to be a man. I had already headed my horse round, thinking
perhaps it was one of the Tassies. I then made a start for the man, but
stopped again, thinking that I was mistaken. Just now I was assured it
was a man and that he needed help, for I distinctly saw him wave his rifle
to me, for he could see me much more plainly, being mounted on my
creamy mare; besides there was not so much smoke .where I was. I
thought to myself I must go now, he calls me, and I’m not frightened; if I
am, it is the first time yet. They are very close to him, and they might
shoot him long before he can get clear of them. Anyhow, if I cannot save
him they will soon take him prisoner. I galloped straight for the man.
Even now I always think it a marvel why that man was not killed. As I
rode along I could see the bullets cutting each side of him. He seemed to
run this way, then that, in his alarm, and appeared to be very excited and
exhausted. I drew my mare a little to the left to escape the trail of bullets
that was cutting all around this unfortunate, although. I suppose, they
very likely were as thick around me, but probably were shooting high, and
the noise from the horse’s hoofs drowned the ping, ping of the bullets.
When I pulled up alongside of the man, he said, “Oh, there are two
mates back there —one dead and one wounded. I looked ahead, but could
see nothing. But we were in no place to argue the point. I started out
on a reality, so I wasn’t going to look for uncertainties. “Well, the best
thing we can do is to save ourselves if we can. Jump up behind me; J
can help you, but can’t do any more.”
The man handed me his rifle, which I laid with mine in front of me.
He then put his foot on my boot and sprang lightly behind the saddle.
THE FIRS 1 CONTINGENT\


Two or three seconds and we were galloping in the direction the others
had gone for all we were worth. I had given the mare her head, and she
herself made the same wild pace which she had made very often before.
We rode for three or four minutes. Neither of us said one word, we
seemed to be playing too big a game. It was a period of excitement,
anxiety, and suspense. All we did was breathe a little extra hard, and
seemed to wait expectantly, wondering whether we would feel the stinging
of a bullet pass through some fleshy part or the dull thud in a more vital
place. A little later the man said, “Where does their shooting come in
now?” I laughed and made no reply.
He then said,“ What is your name, old man? By Jove, I’m thankful.”
He seemed to be making too much of it, that he made me feel very
awkward. I didn’t want any praise. I hadn’t at this time thought about
anything. I wanted nothing, only to help a comrade, and the quicker he
dropped that part of it the quicker he suited me, and at the time the
whole matter seemed very disagreeable to me to be talked of. All the
satisfaction I then gave him was this —“Oh, I’m a Tasmanian, old man,
that is near enough.” I didn’t feel inclined to blurt out my name. He
seemed very disappointed at me refusing to give him my name.
I felt convinced afterwards that the Boers ceased fire as soon as I
got the man on the horse. We came out of the fray pretty luckily—that
is, the Tasmanians. We had two horses shot and one man slightly
wounded—my brother’s horse (Hugh JVTGuinness) and Freddy Briyant’s,
and Charley Stevenson slightly wounded. My brother at the same time
had a piece of his bayonet blown off with a piece of shell. The Lumsden
Horse and Lock Horse suffered more than we —they had 15 casualties
each. The Victorians on our left had a very warm corner. They had
some rather serious loss, under Colonel Tom Price, who did some very
good work.
I had the good fortune, if you could count it such, to strike exactly
on to Major Cameron when I came up to our company with my cargo.
Our men had again halted, and were giving the Boers a little more
independent fire, as the enemy seemed to be giving chase, and firing from
their horses.
[I here append a letter from Colonel Cameron, which M‘Guinness has
brought under my notice: —“The Nile, January 6, 1902. —Dear Sir, —I am
very pleased to hear that you are desirous of serving again in South
Africa with the Contingent to be sent out by the Commonwealth. I
shall be very pleased to recommend you for any appointment you apply
for, as my knowledge of you both in camp and in the field warrants me
in saying that you will do your duty thoroughly in whatever sphere you
have to act. I reported you for gallantry in the field, both to the Tas-
manian Government and to the Commander-in-Chief, Field-Marshal Lord

APTAIN ARTHUR HORTON RIGGALL, D.5.0., is the son
of Mr. Thomas Riggall, of Somercotes, Ross, and was educated
at Horton College in its palmy days. After completing his
school days, he followed the pursuits in which his father was
engaged—a pastoralist, which is the common description of
landowners in the Midlands, as farming in the ordinary sense of the term
is almost unknown in these grazing areas. And, like many a noble Roman
in the old days, the Captain was called from these quiet pursuits to go
and lead a band of his countrymen in the interests of the Empire.
He was appointed Special Service Officer to the Tasmanian Govern-
ment, and left for service in South Africa, December, 1899. Was recalled
from Melbourne to take charge of the second batch of men (technically
known as the Draft of the First Contingent) during training and transit.
Left for the seat of war January 18, 1900. Landed in South Africa
February, 1900. Served on L. of C. at De Dooms and Victoria West till
the end of March, when he was sent round to Beira to take charge of the
Tasmanian Bushmen’s Contingent, who had come out under Colonel
Wallack. Commanded the Bushmen and composite squadron with Car-
rington till his recall to Rhodesia, when they were transferred to Brigadier-
General the Earl of Erroll, known as the 2nd Mounted Brigade, under
Lord Methuen. Appointed D.A.A.G. to the Earl of Erroll and officer
commanding the composite Bushmen’s Regiment (C.8.R.). Took part
in all the operations in Western Transvaal until invalided to Mafekingwith
enteric fever. Was sent to England in December, and finally invalided
home, April, 1901. Took part in 16 or 17 engagements, and burnt the
stores at Zeerust. Awarded D.5.0., etc.


CAPTAIN A. H. RIGGATIv.

Departure of the Second Draft.
A HEARTY SEND-OFF.
Well before 5 o'clock yesterday morning there was activity at the
Barracks, and much well-ordered bustle of preparation. The men of the
draft had wound up their private affairs, accpiitted themselves creditably
m their drill, borne themselves admirably under a new and stringent
discipline; and they were ready to go where duty called, with all the
British soldier's carelessness of cost and consequence. They were paraded
at 5.45, and at 6.15 they formed fours and commenced their march to the
railway station. In the commencement of that march—the actual setting
off for stern service and the rigours and risks of war—there was food for
serious thought and all solemnity of reflection ; but that was obviously no
time for open indulgence in the softer sentiments, and no single man
gave any sign of faltering. Ahead of the column marched the Head-
quarters Band, playing “The Girl I left Behind Me”—a simple melody
whose merry lilt has many curiously sad associations. It has been the
last home-music of so many brave fellows—the incongruously cheerful
accompaniment of so many sobs and heartbreaks—that, in a way, it has
become one of the saddest tunes of the day, for all its sprightliness.
But the men of the draft marched forward, heads erect and consciences
clean as to the raison d’etre of this outing, ignoring the chances of sv ift
THE FIRST CONTINGENT.

death in the certainty of honest work for home and humanity. War is a
sad business, but clean fighting is an excellently manly exercise; and these
Tasmanian lads looked abundantly fit for any straightforward exercise of
that kind. With the troops were Colonel Legge (the Commandant),.
Colonels Reid and Wallack, the Rev. J. B. W. Woollnough (Senior
Chaplain), Major Just, Captain Reynolds, and a large number of men of
the local forces.
There was noted no trace of any decrease of the popular heartiness
of approval of this enterprise. Six o’clock of a misty morning is a
somewhat early hour to leave one’s bed in this quietly-decorous city;
but there were thousands afoot in the streets along the line of march.
Even at 5 o'clock, and even earlier than that, the folk came out in
knots and singly, and trickled in ever-increasing numbers towards the
Domain. By 6.15 there was a great crowd in the vicinity of the railway
station, and the streets ,were thronged. Everywhere the men were
heartily greeted; if that curiously disordered creature known to our
pained democracy as the Pro-Boer was out he very thoroughly restrained
himself, which was unquestionably wise of the Pro-Boer, since otherwise
many patriots would have been gleefully eager to make a toy of him.
The weather was cheerless—muggy as to atmosphere, dispiriting as to
tone and general quality. A close and breathless morning, damply veiled
with a thick Scotch mist. But nothing less than a shower of fire would
have driven the appreciative populace to cover, and nobody paid attention
to Swithin, for all his ill-intentions. The general enthusiasm attained its
acme as the men reached the railway station, and cheers were frequent
and of the first magnitude. For obvious reasons, the crowd was not
allowed entrance to the stone platform at which the troops were entrained.
A few of the outer public did gain entrance, admitted on some principle of
selection not made known; but, with this slight exception, the platform
was reserved for the Forces and such others as were officially connected
with the Government. The Governor arrived early, accompanied by the
Private Secretary (Mr. Alex. Rawlinson), and remained until the troop-
train had left for the North. Among others present were the Premier
(Hon. N. E. Lewis, M.H.A.), the Principal Under-Secretary (Lieutenant
G. Steward), Messrs. Bradley and Humphrey Page, Ms.H.A., and Mr.
Back (General Manager of Railways). A large number of men of the
volunteer forces, and a bevy of bright-faced cadets accompanied the draft
to the North. The train got under way at 6.45, and Hobart had seen the
last of the second draft, till
AT LAUNCESTON.
At 10 minutes to 2 on Thursday the ranks were re-formed, the route
to the wharf was lined by members of the Defence Force, and an enormous
crowd assembled on the square in front of the Customs House and
Messrs. Huddart, Parker, and Co.’s sheds. As the draft rounded the
corner the enthusiasm of the crowd was let loose in a splendid ovatiom

which was augmented by the firing of rockets from the steamer Wakatipn,
and the playing of bands. The steamers at the wharf and the barque
Norman Macleod were crowded, and every possible spot from which a
view of the steamer “Coogee,” on which the men embarked, could be
obtained, was fully occupied. About 10 minutes past 2 the “Coogee” moved
away from the wharf, and then another outburst of enthusiasm took
place. The men were loudly cheered, and the waving of handkerchiefs
was continued till the steamer rounded Town Point and started on her
voyage. There was not the same light-heartedness in the send-off as on
the occasion when Captain Cameron’s men left, as the aspect of affairs
in South Africa is now much more serious than it was considered then
But still the farewell was none the less hearty, as the knowledge that they
are likely to see some rough work made the action of the men all the
more praiseworthy in the eyes of the general public. Everyone in the
crowd re-echoed the Commandant’s sentiments, and wished the men
“God-speed, and a safe return to Tasmania.”
Among those who took part in the demonstration were the Premier
(Hon. N. E. Lewis), the Minister of Defence (Hon. G. T. Collins), the
Mayor (Mr. E. H. Panton), and aldermen of the city. The police, under
the direction of Superintendent Driscoll, kept the line of march clear,
so that the military were not hampered in their movements.
At Nubeena on the 15th inst., the Rev. J. Hebblethwaite, delivered
an interesting lecture on the Transvaal War up to date. There was a
good attendance, and a collection was made in aid of the Patriotic Fund.
Mr. Hebblethwaite intends repeating the lecture in different parts of the
district.


CONTINGENT CHAPLAINCY QUESTION.
The Rev. P. N. Hunter left Hobart for Zeehan yesterday per s.s.
“Mahinapua.” As previously announced, he goes back to resume duties
until the appointment of a successor. We are authorised to state that
on Wednesday last the Bishop made arrangements with Mr. Hunter to
return to his parish for a month. After that he proposes to assist him
in every way to join the Tasmanian contingent in Africa, with the sanction
of the Government. Mr. Hunter pays his own expenses. In the course
of yesterday Archdeacon Whitington, in reply to the chairman of the
meeting at Queenborough on Tuesday evening, stated that he could not
receive a deputation without the Bishop's consent, and that as matters had
now been arranged, there was no need to proceed further.
THE DEPUTATION REPORT.
(To the Editor of the “Mercury.”
Sir, —Archdeacon Whitington, in your to-day’s issue, hastily and
wrongly assumes that the report of the deputation to the Bishop was the
work, and represented the recollection, of a single member of the deputa-
tion. It was actually written by one person, then revised and re-written
by a second; and it was a correct report. The Archdeacon supplements
it, but withholds the Bishop’s undignified reply to the unjustifiable remarks
of one gentleman present which he gives.
But why did the Archdeacon doubt the accuracy of the report? Does
he not see that doubt of its accuracy implies disapproval of this Diocesan’s
conduct should it turn out to be correct ?
Would Archdeacon Whitington have refused to allow our brave
voting soldiers the ministrations of the man whose companionship and
syr pathy they desire? I more than doubt it.—Yours, etc.,
January 18. A Member of Deputation.
THE BRITISH AND THE BOERS.
(To the Editor of the “Mercury.”)
Sir, —I should like to add a few words to the remarks of your corre-
spondent “Briton” in to-day’s “Mercury.” If the Government officials
who are alluded to are induced by hereditary antagonism to England to
support the cause of the Boers, it will be well for them to listen to the
words of an Irish Catholic Bishop in South Africa, which indeed are
worthy of the consideration of all doubters.
Bishop Gaughran 0.M., Vicar Apostolic of the Orange Free State,
writing from Kimberley to a friend on the staff of the Boston “Herald,”
says —“I am not an Englishman, and my sympathies are not generally
with England, but I can safely say that very seldom had England a more
just cause for war than in the present case.”
These are weighty words, the words of a man on the spot, who knows
all the circumstances, who does not love England, but who does love truth,


as his sacred office requires ; and who in the interests of truth is impelled
to say what he knows and what he thinks of the present crisis.—Yours, etc.,
January 17. W. Humphrey Page.
As these men joined the First Contingent under Major Cameron on
arrival at the front, their doings are pretty much merged in the First
Contingent. For the sake of clearness, however, I have kept the material
relating to them as much as possible separate.
Notes from Diary of H. H. Facy
Trooper Facy writes with great fluency, and has kept very full notes
of his experiences. As my space is limited, I shall have to omit much.
Indeed, the diary is essentially a private record, much of which was not
intended for publication.
Bellerive, Monday, ist January, 1900. —As I had instructions to attend
at the Barracks at 3 p.m. for the purpose of being medically examined as
one of the Second Tasmanian Contingent (draft of First) for South Africa,
I was unable to go anywhere, so came across to town by the 10 boat, and
met J. M'Cormick. At 3 p.m. we steered a course for the Staff Office
of the Headquarters Tasmanian Defence Force, and were examined by
Lieutenant-Surgeon Giblin, and both passed successfully.
Hobart, Tuesday, January 2nd, 1900. —Up at 4.30 a.m.. Was in my
uniform, so caught the 7 boat, and went straight up to the Barracks and
fell in with the first squad of the Second Tasmanian Contingent. The follow-
ing were on parade: —F. Adams, J. M‘Cormick, Horton, E. Evans, Ellis, J.
Douglas, P. Doolan, O. Vaughan. We paraded from 7 to 8. Breakfast
8.15. Went down to Bidencope’s, and were measured for our new uniforms.
Dismissed for the day at 4.30. Caught 5 boat home. Town at 7, and went
down to see the Northern men arrive, and marched to Barracks, headed by
Headquarters Band.
Hobart, Wednesday, January 17th, 1900.— All hands fell in for the
first time to-day to have our photos, taken by J. W. Beattie in full march-
ing order for the papers. Went through the painful operation of saying
good-bye. Both father and mother cut up very much, and hard work
to keep from breaking down myself.
Hobart and Launceston, Thursday, January 18th, 1900.— Up a little
after 4. Breakfast and into our swags, etc., and fell in at 6 a.m. to start
on our journey to South Africa. Marched to station, headed by Head-
quarters Band, and all of Hobart were out to bid us farewell, and such
a good send off ,we got. Left about 6.40, arriving in Launceston about
12.30. At every station there were crowds to cheer us. A tremendous
crowd in Launceston. Dismissed to say good-bye for quarter of an hour.
Marched to “Coogee.” Left wharf about 2.30 amidst deafening cheers.
Passed through the Heads about 5.30, and passed out of sight of dear
old Tassie about 7.15, so all hands assembled aft and cheered for our
tight little island home.


5.5. “Moravian,” Melbourne, Tuesday, January 23rd, 1900. —About 9.30
Captain Riggall (1 am his orderly) sent me up to Melbourne to purchase
him a deck-chair, etc. I did other little jobs for some of the boys, and had
quite a load to return with. On my way back met T. G.'s girl, so escorted
her down to the boat to see her lover. We started about 1.30. A splendid
send-off from the 6,000 odd people on the wharf. Passing Queenscliff I
was called on the bridge with the flags, and sent “Good-bye” to the
Battery ashore. They, in reply, sent “Wish you God-speed and safe
return.” Replied, “Thank you.” Then they wound up with “Good-bye.”
I managed the messages better than I expected. After tea Captain Riggall
handed me a telegram received by him from our Commandant, which I
read to all the boys ; “Wish you and men God-speed and safe return. Glad
hear good accounts of the Contingent.”
[The notes of the voyage, though transcribed by me, have had to be
cut out for want of space.]
5.5. “Moravian,” January 25th, 1900. —About 2 this morning was
roused up by E. Smallhorn to come and help eat some sardines, sand-
wiches, and some hot coffee. One of the night stewards brought it along
(good boy!). Sighted two or three steamers to-dav.
5.5. “Moravian/ February 17th, 1900. —A beautiful day. Roused up
again this morning same time to have another supper of sardine sand-
wiches and coffee. At 10 a.m. had a full kit inspection in full marching
order. About 5-3° we had church parade for all hands on the poop deck.
It was one of the most solemn services I have ever attended. More than
one tearful eye; almost so myself (why not ?). There is no telling how
soon some of us may die now. (“There is but a step between me and
death.”) Sighted land about 7 a.m. Passed “Southern Cross” (Australian
troopship with N.S.W. Mounted Infantry on board) about 8 a.m. Abreast
of Cape of Good Hope at 3-3Q- Passed s.s. Aberdeen (same line as
Moravian ) and s.s. “Scott about 4 and 5 p.m. respectively, outward
bound. Arrived and dropped anchor off Capetown at 7 p.m. Good news
on arrival—Kimberley relieved and Lord Roberts within three miles of
Bloemfontein, but Ladysmith still unrelieved. A e do not go ashore until
to-morrow, perhaps not until Monday. At noon to-day, when abreast of
the spot where the Birkenhead was wrecked vears ago, all hands assem-
on their respective parade grounds and presented arms, bugles
playing the Royal Salute.
Capetown, Sunday, February 18th, 1900. —Steamed into wharf about
noon. All the morning we were busy getting readv to go ashore. Fell
in about 2 o clock on the wharf, kits placed on baggage wagons, and
marched up to camp at Green Point. Directlv we arrived, pitched our
tents. Tommies (3rd Buffs) very kindly brought us tucker for tea. If
they had not we should have had to go without. In the evening were
yarning to some of the wounded that have been through some & of the
fierce engagements. In this camp there are about 11,000" representatives
of nearly every regiment in the British Army. Quite interesting to varn


to them. I collected all the boys’ letters this morning, and this evening
gave them to our doctor, who will post them in Capetown. The ground
here is very sandy. We are divided into five tents —Sergeant Adams in
charge of No. I, Corporal Doolan of No. 2, Corporal Smith No. 3, Ser-
geant Beresford No. 4, and Lance-Corporal Smallhorn No. 5. lam with
the latter. Bert Pegg, R. Pitt, S. Riley, Chilcott, Butler, and Tilley are
with us also. Major Murray and our two officers are together, and his
orderly (O’Connor) is with us, too. Don't know yet when we go up to
the front, but the sooner the better.
Capetown, February 19th, 1900. —A very warm day, but windy, so our
camp terriblv dusty. No drills all day; not allowed to drill; good job,
too. Had our roll called about 9 o’clock. After dinner several of us
went down to the shore and had a swim in the Atlantic Ocean. Very
cold. Had tea; then Corporal Doolan, Smith, and I went into Capetown
and had a look round. Never struck such a dust-hole in my life. Town
looked very lively with “Tommies. Fumed in by 10, tired and covered
m dust; very unpleasant.
Capetown, Tuesday, February 20th, 1900. —Very dusty again. Fell in
about 8.30 and marched round Capetown with about 4000 other volunteers
and Tommies. Received a grand reception. In the afternoon was in the
Soldiers’ Home, writing letters. Chilcott and I had a cup of tea there:
then went into town. On the way in we met Gunner Coombs, of the
Canadian Artillery, so we went with him to the Y.M.C.A. rooms, and
had beautiful refreshing cool shower (bath). Then young Spotswood (for-
merly of Hobart) took us upstairs, and had tea with him. We sat there
smoking and reading until about 8.45. We had to hold ourselves in
readiness to go up to the front this evening, but did not go. Things
militaiy are mixed up here in Capetown. We may get our marching orders
any time to go at an hour's notice.
Capetown, February 21st, 1900. —A beautiful and windy day. Doing
the same as yesterday morning. Took train to Rondebosch (eight miles
out), to see Victor Peers, of the First Contingent, who was wounded at
Rensburg on the 9th inst. He had a very narrow escape, but acquitted
himself splendidly.
Capetown, February 22nd, 1900. —After breakfast O Connor and I
were busy straightening up officers' tent. Fell in about 11 a.m.; then
marched into Capetown to the Castle, and had our tea. Lee-Enfield rifles
and dagger bayonets issued out to us. Fell in again about 2.30, and had
Lee-Metford and dagger bayonets issued to us. Marched back and dis-
missed about 4 p.m. Bert and I went to “Skee bang” to write. I wrote
up this diary.
Capetown, Friday, February 23rd, 1900. —Took train to Capetown,
then to see Sergeant H. Hallam, of the Ist Tassies, in the Hospital there,
with an abscess in his stomach. He will soon be well again and at the
front. C. Pedder is also there, but is to be sent back home; has pneumonia
Badly. We leave for up country to-morrow to duty somewhere. Had


bandoliers and 100 rounds of ammunition served out to us. We put s°'
in our bandoliers, and balance in pouches.
Capetown and train, February 24th, 1900. —Had an early dinner, then
struck tents and got our things and everything ready to leave. Wore
bandoliers for first time. Fell in about 2 p.m., then marched into railway
station en route for De Dooms (about 129 miles from Capetown). Left
about 5 p.m,, eight in a compartment. I was in a first class, so very
comfortable. About 10.45, at Wellington, we had a cup of tea and buns.
But we had plenty to eat, as several Tassie people were down to see us
off, and gave us fruit and biscuits, etc. Very interesting to see the nigger
children en route.
Drain and De Dooms, February 25th, 1900. —Upon awaking, found
our carriage shunted on to an off line at De Dooms, we having arrived
there at 4.30, and, of course, the train went on to its destination with the
other troops aboard, who are wounded soldiers of almost every regiment,
who have recovered, and are going to the front to fight for the Queen.
May they have better luck than before is my earnest wish. About 6.30
some of the Railway Pioneer Regiment (who have been stationed here
the last few weeks, and we relieve them) kindly brought us some hot cocoa,
bread, and butter, to which we did good justice. About 10 we erected
out tents, made the kitchen, latrines, etc., then each man carried his
respective accoutrements across to his tent and put same in. Then we had
a game of football with the R.P.R. (Regiment of Volunteers from Johan-
nesburg). Had “bully beef” and biscuits issued for dinner and tea. We
are camped about 100 yards from the railway station—a nice spot, with
Australian gum trees around us. Thank God, there is no dust, but rocky;
so we cut down green boughs and strewed around our tents. After tea,
had another game of football; then a yarn to some of the R.P.R.’s. Guard
of three privates and one N.C.O. were mounted round camp upon arrival
here. Our duties are to patrol the line 13 miles, so 15 men sent out
accordingly after tea. They are on until morning. Only on at night time.
De Dooms, February 26th, 1900. —After tea we received word to
strike camp and proceed up to Victoria West some time in the earlv morn-
ing. About 8.30 we started to strike camp, and were finished about 10
p.m. Then had time to be in at a fireside sing-song at the invitation of
No. 4 Company of the R.P.R. They also struck camp this afternoon,
and go north in the morning. They slept in the railway goods shed.
After the sing-song we lit a big fire and made some tea, then dozed about
till midnight.
Train, Tuesday, February 27th, 1900. —Still waiting about for the
train to embark upon, which we did eventually about 3.30 a.m. Left for
Victoiia West (290 miles up) at 5 a.m.; then tried to sleep, but only gor
occasional dozes. Stopped at T. River about 10 a.m. for a wash,'then
upon leaving had tinned meat, biscuits, and jam served out to us, so had
breakfast. At Matiensfontein, 1.30, had dinner. In addition to what
we had served out to us, we had salmon, tomatoes, and vinegar (the lat-
ter two were looted), so did very well. At Prince Albert Road we man-


aged to get some hot water, and made some tea, so had a good feed out
on the platform. Had one other meal under way. At this latter place
read the official telegram from Lord Roberts that General Cronje had sur-
rendered with about 4660 Boers at Paardeburg at 7.4 this morning. At
last we have Majuba avenged, and, strange to say, on the anniversary of
that sad disaster in 1881.
Victoria West Road, February 28th, 1900. —Arrived at Victoria West
about 5 a.m., then immediately put our accoutrements on and marched to
our camp. Fortunately, six huts were already up, and all we had to do was
to take possession. We are camped on very flat country, 4175 ft. above sea
level. After tea we had a look at Lord Kitchener, who arrived from
the front here about the same time as we did. He is down to make ar-
rangements to send a column out west to put down the rising of rebels.
Stayed two hours, and went back again. Had a swim in a mud hole:
dirty, but refreshing.
Victoria West Road, Ist March, 1900. —Had instructions given us in
case of attack, which we expect any moment from about 1000 Boer rebels
away to the nor’-west. After dinner we were marched to our respective
posts in case of attack. We are stationed in twenties around the camp
and railway station. Read official telegram this morning that General
Buller entered Ladysmith last night. Hurrah! About 9 a.m. General
Cronje, his wife, and two sons, en route from where Lord Roberts cap-
tured him to his prison at Simonstown. I had a good look at them,
and by the look of the former it is a d d good job he is captured. About
10 p.m. an alarm was fired, so all hands had to fall to arms and get to
the posts. We all thought we were attacked, but unfortunately (?) it
was a false alarm. Naturally we were on our mettle for a time, expect-
ing fire. It took us only about 2p2 minutes to dress and get to our
posts, for which Captain Riggall expressed his high approval. Fun at
the canteen. Choveaux borrowed a sergeant’s stripes from Sergeant
Clerk, of the D.E.0.0.R., and had as much beer given to the Tassies as
thev could drink, consequently several “drunks,” which necessitated a
good rounding on by our skipper.
Victoria West Road, 2nd March, 1900. —About 10.30 a trainload (750)
of Boers from Paardeberg, captured by Lord Roberts, passed through;
second lot (about 500) again at 3. Had several yarns to same, also filled
their water bottles for them. Several of us got small trophies from
them, myself getting a good few. They looked a savage lot, but seemed
contented; no more fighting for them to do. They put one in mind of
such men as one would meet in the backblocks of Tassie—regular farmer-
looking, but some very ignorant and pig-headed by their remarks.
Victoria West Road, 3rd March, 1900. —More prisoners (500 odd)
passed through to Capetown, so of course had a good look at them. The
140 New Zealanders left this morning, all mounted, and took a nor’-west
direction —something in connection with those 1000 rebels. Disappoint-
ing we cannot go somewhere; all eager to be in the thick of it. This
evening O’C (not officer commanding, but O’Connor!) came with me


while 1 “commandeered” two fowls from a Dutchwoman s hen roost.
Plenty of commandeering going on —pigs and fowls. (Serve em right!)
Victoria West Road, Sunday, March 4th, 1900. —After tea had a
grand game of football, our captain and doctor “bucking in well. About
7.30 train arrived, en route for Naauwpoort, with 3rd Battalion Welsh
Militia. Got in carriage with some, and had a good yarn, also getting
two of their badges. Have a good collection of other trinkets together
now. The New Zealanders and West Australians have formed a flying
column to march on Prieska, Kenhart, and Carnarvon (N.W. of Cape
Colonv), to suppress the rising of the Cape rebels.
Preto; ia West Road, March sth, 1900. —The West Australian M.R.
(90) arrived, and left again this afternoon in the same direction as the
N.Z.’s yesterday. Hard lines we can’t go. After dinner went for a
swim with others in a shallow mudhole. About 8 a trainload of Welsh
Militia stopped here, en route for the front; a very jolly and lively crew.
Of course I got some badges from them. Last of the prisoners passed
through. Very sorry to see an Australian among them, so gave him
a bit of my tongue, which was very choice. “Commandeered” two fowls,
so I had dinner with two sections (assisted by “Uncle Tom” and G.
Blyth).
Victoria West Road, March 6th, 1900. —About 4 a.m. heard two
shots, so up and into clothes and arms and then to posts. It appears
that “Napper” Evans on main guard sentry fired on about 40 niggers who
did not answer his challenge. We were disappointed at not having a
go. Were sorry that Evans did not hit anyone for revenge. The “Dukes”
did some rifle shooting at the butts this afternoon. There passed through
a trainload of all sorts of “Tommies” early this morning. At 8.30 APCor-
mick and I were detailed off to watch some suspicious flashes from the
neighbouring kopjes. Were out until 1 a.m., then turned in. Game of
cricket immediately after tea. Hospital tent put up this morning for
our sick, who are three. Captain Riggall bought a Mauser rifle from
a ‘Tommie" en route to the Cape for 30s. Ellis got a Martini-Henry
also for a Kruger sovereign.
Victoria West Road, March 7th, 1900. —A very hot and beautiful day.
Had three shots each at 300 yds., very bad shooting. I got 4- —o —3 —-7.
Strange rifle and only three shots. Top score by Charlie Hayes, 54 —2
—ll. Posted a “Cape Times” home this evening.
Victoria West Road, March Bth, 1900. —On guard up to 6 p.m. Dur-
ing my hours off put in the time sleeping, writing, and smoking. This
morning T.G. and C. commandeered a case of biscuits, and in afternoon
case of condensed milk from the station—a very daring thing, but they
were soon equally shared out among the various tents, also the officers.
(“Honour among thieves.”) A. Chilcott ill to-day.
Victoria West Road, March 9th, 1900. —Parade at 6.30 a.m. After-
noon and evening writing a letter home to father, also posted Harr/
Paul a “Cape Times.” About 9 p.m. G. Blyth, “Uncle,” and I comman-
deered a kid out of a kraal. Carried the meat back to camp just as


“Tattoo'’ sounded, a dare-devil trick. Captain read challenge from the
“Dukes” to play them cricket to-morrow. We accepted their challenge,
an armed party in all sorts of curious dress taking the acceptance back.
Packett and Tilley (our section and tent) commandeered some cabbages,
marrows, and pie melon from a Dutch farm about three miles from
camp. We Tassies are living very high indeed on commandeering, our
officers enjoying the fun, but of course they “know nothing about it.”
Quite right they shouldn’t.
Victoria West Road, March 10th, 1900. —The doctor and I picked our
cricket team to play the Dukes this afternoon. Started at 2 p.m., our
doctor (captain) winning the toss from Lieutenant Spence; we batted
first. I only got 3 when I dribbled a ball slowly back and just knocked
the bails off. We got 55 and three wickets for 47. The Dukes got 116.
I think we shall finish next week. Tasmanian Infantry, first innings—
Galvin 5, Packett 2, Playes 1, Parish 18, Wellard 7, Burton 1, Captain
Riggall 4, Lient. Jamieson 7, Potter o, M. Best o, Facy 3. Sundries, 7
55. D.E.0.V.R., first innings—Falconer, Williams, Spence, Green, Wal-
ker, Steinbach, Cook, Lee, Phillips, Neill, Denton—ll6. “Dukes” won
by 61 runs on first innings.
Victoria West Road, Sunday, March 11, 1900. —Had a good dinner
on roast sucking pig, cabbage, and marrow, all commandeered; doing
well. Fell in at 4.15 p.m., and marched to railway goods sheds for
church parade. After tea busy writing for awhile, then I met Trooper
Hughes (brother-in-law of Captain Cameron), of the Canadian Cowboys,
so had a nice yarn in our tent; also in our tent Captain Green, of the
Dukes, representatives of Canada, Cape Colony, and Tasmania. Some
of our boys got a letter to-day, but none from Australia. Flow anxiously
we are looking forward to hear from home! One can appreciate the re-
ceiving of letters under the circumstances we are in.
Victoria West Road, March 12th, 1900. —Shooting on range. Can-
not shoot with the Lee-Enfield —pulls too heavy, and one cannot take
a fine sight. Must be a full one. G. Blyth and Encle commandeered
about a dozen tins of preserved fruit, red-hot, right under the eyes of
the officers; “their troubles!” The Canadians very kindly gave us a
quantity of smoking and chewing tobacco to-day.
Victoria West Road, March 13th, 1900. —Took a letter across f o
the Commandant for the captain. It was about a case of fancy biscuits
that Rafferty commandeered from a rail truck a week ago, but unfortu-
nately he was seen (“his troubles !”). This morning a telegram received
from captain of First Tasmanians, saying we were urgently needed up
there with them, and to forward on immediately. Of course we have
to get the necessary order to go, which our captain tried hard to get.
All very anxious to do some fighting. On 30th January, 1854, conven-
tion signed by British Government gave the Orange Free State their
independence under their protection; from yesterday it again goes back
to British rule by the capture of the capital.


Victoria West Road, March 14th, 1900. —Came off guard at 6 a.m.,
but the flies would not let me sleep. hrom 4to 6 a.m. Chilcott and I
(on sentry) had a lively friendly sparring match, greatly against proper
order, but it was so cold we did it to get warm. After clearing up
the officers’ dinner things, “Uncle” and I did their washing. ihe boys
in a very bad mood, as also the three officers at being stuck here doing
nothing, and not being sent somewhere where some fighting is being
done. D 11 hard to be sent this far and not see active service, but
perhaps we may have a chance yet. lelegram posted outside section
telegraph here: —‘‘Lord Roberts occupied Bloemfontein yesterday. ihe
Union Jack flies over the Presidency vacated by Mr. Steyn. ihe Mayor,
the State Secretary, and the Landdrost and other officials met Lord Ro-
berts two miles outside the town, and presented him with the key of
the public offices. The enemy has withdrawn from the neighbourhood.
The inhabitants gave the troops a cordial welcome.” Well done, Bobs,
but hard lines the “Bloodthirsty 45" cannot help in a small way. Bert.
Pegg, George Richardson, and I had a very refreshing swim before tea.
Victoria West Road, March 15th, 1900. —Was just turning in (9 p.m.)
when two shots were fired, so all hands immediately fell in at their re-
spective posts, fully armed; but it turned out that one of the Dukes (ex-
Sergeant Clark) fired them off purposely out on the veldt, to prevent a
row amongst his comrades, as they were half-tight (they had a pay-day
to-day), and threatened to give their officers a rough handling. How-
ever, our Corporal of Guard (R. P. Smith) locked him up in our guard
tent for the night. Sergeant Adams and six of his first section left by
train about 11 p.m. for 16 miles up the line to guard the Brakepoort
Bridge for a week. Twenty odd of the Dukes went down to Beaufort
West to-night also.
Victoria West Road, March 16th, 1900. —Another warm day. Had
a cap on, and got a bit sunstruck, so had a headache and felt bad all
day. I commandeered a little teapot this evening (you vagabond!). Lent
captain my diary this afternoon to write his up, back about a fortnight.
He has been unwell to-day also. When will we get some letters? Fully
two months since we left. Surely we must be forgotten. “Out of sight,
out of mind.” Perhaps the mails are “bung up.” Choveaux went into
hospital this evening—dysentery, etc.
Victoria West Road, March 17th, 1900.— Too unwell to parade at
6.30, but all right towards dinner time. Sing-song to commemorate
St. Patrick’s Day. Expecting an attack, so slept in clothes, with loaded
rifle in tent.
Victoria West Road, March 18th, 1900. —Church parade at 8.30. Only
five went, and not myself. Oh to receive letters! Was one of a party
who volunteered to bury a pig and two goats (“high”) just outside our camp
boundary. Captain also helped us. He uses the pick and shovel very
well. Not a nice job by any means.
Victoria West Road, March 19th, 1900. —Roused at 3.45; had break-
fast, then fell in at 5 a.m., and marched to Victoria West village (a distance


of nine miles), arriving about 7.15. We are told off to patrol the kopjes
around the village, as some Boer rebels were supposed to have been seen
in the neighbourhood yesterday and Saturday. We marched for about
five miles in fours, then extended to two paces, halted just outside the
place, and had something to eat. Each man had a
tin of Maconochie’s rations and four biscuits given him before leaving.
Then marched to Court House and had a little spell. About 8.30 a
Dutch parson (Rev. Moray) very kindly gave us a cup of hot coffee and
bread and butter each. Oh, how we enjoyed it, after our fast forced
march! About 9.30 Rafferty and I had bikes given us, so were told off
as scouts under the guidance of Mr. Hasketh, of the Intelligence Depart-
ment, to ride out beyond the village for five miles. Upon arrival at a
waterhole we planted our bikes and mounted a big kopje, and walked
about three miles across the top, trying to find traces of the rebels, but
found none. Got back to where our bikes iwere, and found Major Murray
waiting, he having scouted the opposite kopje to us; so then rode back
to the village. Our doctor then took us to the Commercial Hotel and
gave us a dinner there (2 p.m.), but had a very refreshing shower bath
previously. We had a spell till about 5, so then the doctor came and
roused us, so left. He rode and we walked (the others having left at
4.45). On the way a buggy overtook us, so the doctor and Rafferty
got in, and I rode the horse. Got back to camp about 7.30, “dog tired.”
Out at the village we received our first letters since leaving home. Oh,
the joy! I got the most, viz., nine. The boys had a bit of fun in the
Courthouse whilst waiting for a sharp shower to cease, in carrying out
a mock trial on George Blyth for commandeering a pig. He received
25 years. “Uncle Tom” was also up for milking a black cow, but owing
to the evidence being contradictory was acquitted, as George Blyth turned
Queen’s evidence, he having held the cow’s horns whilst he did the joD.
Tom Galvin, judge; “Rat” Williams, Crown Prosecutor; Ern. Smallhorn,
crier; R. P. Smith and R. P. Doolan, counsels for defence. The officers
enjoyed the fun immensely.
Victoria West Road, March 20th, 1900. —Felt a little stiff after the
bike ride yesterday, otherwise am tip-top. Some of the boys knocked
out with yesterday’s tramp. Of course I re-read my letters again to-day,
and also papers as well. I received a “Tasmanian Mail.” I received more
letters this morning.
Victoria West Road, March 2ist, 1900. —A beautiful and warm day,
but before sunrise it was very cold. Fell in at 2 p.m., and fired against
10 of the “Dukes.” Result—Tasmanians 266, Dukes 189 —77 lead for
Tassies. We shoot them again at 400 yards to-morrow. Corporal
Smith and six men went out to relieve Sergeant Adams and his six men
at Brakepoort Bridge.
Victoria West Road, March 22nd, 1900. —Another very cold morn-
ing, but turned out very warm day. In afternoon fired in finish of match
against the Dukes. Beat them again by 67 —114 altogether. Wrote


to 8., and enclosed four ostrich feathers for him to give to mother, in a
large envelope the captain gave me.
Victoria West Road, March 23rd, 1900. —Very wet and miserable af-
ternoon and evening. Busy writing to R.P. Officers tent flooded out.
Took their things across to the hotel, and slept there. Most of us slept
in railway goods shed and ladies’ waiting room. It can rain here, and
no mistake. W. commandeered a case of from off the platform
this evening.
Victoria West Road, March 24th, 1900. —A dull day, very sloppy
underfoot. All hands busy at fatigue work, making their tent trenches
deep. Shifted our officers’ tent this morning to a higher spot, and out
of the low-lying water.
Victoria West Road, March 25th, 1900. —Dull and cloudy up to 4
p.m., then rained verv hard. After dinner I sneaked away and had a
yarn to Miss . She very kindly brought me some pudding and
sauce in a saucer, which was very nice. [My readers will, lam sure, re-
joice in our hero’s good fortune and winning ways. I could not omit
this genuine touch of a soldier’s fascinating manner and its reward in
pudding—and even sauce. What “boys'’ we sent out!] Several washed
out again, so slept in same quarters as last night. Before turning in was
teaching Choveaux and Rafferty the semaphore signalling. Not much
room certainly, but the former got on very well.
Victoria West Road, March 26th, 1900. —Roused from our peaceful
slumbers about 5 a.m. to go three-quarters of a mile up the line to ren-
der assistance, if needed, to those hurt in railway accident. Last night’s
heavy rain washed a dam away, which then washed a portion of the line
also away, and a troop train suffered. The engine, tender, and three
trucks and four carriages fell over on to the side and buried in the mud.
Consequently two of the Northumberland Fusiliers were seriously hurt,
and some of our boys carried them on stretchers across to a Dutchman’s
farmhouse, where our doctor attended them. Others were hurt slightly.
There were details of the Gordons, Seaforths, and New Zealanders on
board, en route for the front. G.B. commandeered a case of meats, and
Sergeant A. a case of port wine; both shared out amongst ns. Held a
drum-head court-martial on for ill-treating a young black boy,
George. We told him we considered him beneath us for his unsoldierly
conduct. Gave “Shove” and Rafferty another go at signalling.
Victoria West Road, March 27th, 1900. —G.B. and “IJncle" comman-
deered two ducks and one fowl to-day. Trooper Thureau, of the 2nd
N.Z. M.R. (he and his mate have been here on sick list some time now)
put some of our boys through mounted rifle drill this morning.
Victoria West Road, March 28th, 1900. —Fell in at 3 p.m. for kit and
ammunition inspection. “Uncle” and I washed the captain’s and doctor’s
things. When we went to get them in when dry, discovered that several
articles had fallen down, so must wash them over again to-morrow. One
of the boys commandeered a case of Jewish Passover bread this evening.


[Surely one of the devil’s own!] Corporal Smith brought a black boy, Cor-
nelius, down with him. He is for officers and third section.
\ ictoria West Road, March 29th, 1900. —A beautiful day. Rewashed
the articles that were soiled yesterday. Immediately after tea had a
squad of about eight at signalling. G.B. and E. had a fight over behind the
butts, a mile from camp. They quarrelled last night. They shook hands
afterwards, and parted good friends. The captain very unwell to-day.
Victoria West Road, March 30th, 1900. —Captain very ill indeed to-
day, so had to make him arrowroot and sago for his meals. Never
do for him to knock up. Percy Smith, “Shove,” and I went for a re-
freshing swim in a hole about i]/ 2 miles from the camp. Afterwards
“Uncle” Tom took M. Best up to the hospital at Deelfontein. He has a
cold on his renae.
Victoria West Road, March 31st, 1900. —Another beautiful day.
After dinner the doctor, captain, “Uncle,” and I went for a swim in a
splendid hole, where we could have a decent swim and dive. Captain
a little better, but still unwell, necessitating making arrowroot for him.
“Rat” Williamson and George Blyth brought back half a bag of large
crabs; eventually cooked them for their supper.
Victoria West Road, April Ist, 1900. —Sergeant Harry Hallam, Pri-
vates V. Peers and Lathey passed through to join their Tassie comrades.
Needless to say were very pleased to see them, and had a good yarn to
them. They have been in hospital at Capetown, former and latter ill,
Peers wounded. The captain received word to join the Bushmen and
leave us. All the boys took it to heart terribly, as we do not like the
idea of his leaving us. There is not a single one of the 45 that would
not risk his life for him. There is a chance of my going with him,
too, as lam his orderly. Posted three papers to mother.
Victoria West Road, April 2nd, 1900. —This afternoon the captain
received word to proceed to Capetown and take command of the Tas-
manian Bushmen. All the boys have the hump, and terribly cut up
at losing him. Igo with him, so it’s all right for me; but still Ido
not like the idea of leaving my comrades, but must make the best of a
bad job. We leave by the Kimberley mail in the morning at 8 a.m.
Train, Tuesday, April 3rd, 1900. —We left by the Kimberley mail at
9.30, and received a splendid send-off from the boys. I was in a second-
class carriage with E. Wilmot, from Naauwpoort. Large stone weighing
300 odd pounds discovered on the line.
Capetown, April 4th, 1900. —Roused about 1 a.m. by one of the
Dukes, who is in my carriage, as about 50 yards of the line was washed
away; but fortunately it was discovered in time, or it would have been
a case of “What oh, she bumps!” Were detained four hours through it.
Arrived in Capetown at 12.30 p.m., being six hours late. Upon arrival
took captain’s and my own “dunnage” to the Grand Hotel, whilst he
went to find out about our movements. Had no dinner, then messed
about Capetown all afternoon. Plad tea at the Rand Restaurant. Quite
a treat to get into civilisation once more, but felt lonely on my own.


We have followed our hero's fortunes for over four months, and he
and his comrades of the “Bloodthirsty 45“ have done nothing of actual
warfare. We have seen how disappointed they have been, and now his
history and that of the “captain” is to be related under another contin-
gent. The history of the Draft of First Contingent (for this is the official
title) is soon to be merged in that of the First Contingent already at the
front under Captain Cameron (afterwards major). Captain Riggall now
takes charge of the “Tasmanian Bushmen’s Contingent,” supported by
his faithful orderly, H. H. Facy, whose racy notes have detained and en-
tertained us so long.

HE third batch of men, known as the Tasmanian Bushmen’s
Contingent, left Hobart on March 27, 1900, under the com-
mand of Lieutenant-Colonel E. T. Wallack. Colonel Wal-
lack is the son of the late Captain Harry Wallack, who served
in the 9th Foot (now Norfolk Regiment) and the
77th Foot (now the Middlesex Regiment). He was also
for many years in Her (late) Majesty's Honourable Corps of Gentle-
men-at-Arms. While in the 9th Regiment he went through the Great
Sikh War. Colonel Wallack was educated privately under tutors. He
joined the Permanent Staff in Tasmania, April, 1885, having previously
held a lieutenant's commission in the 4th Battalion Middlesex Regiment.
Shortly before the transport Atlantian left the wharf on Monday the
officers of the First Battalion assembled on board and presented Colonel
Wallack with a handsome leather dressing case. The presentation was
made by the officer commanding the battalion, who wished the Colonel,
on behalf of the officers, a safe journey to South Africa, and a triumphant
return to resume his command of the Tasmanian Infantry forces, and
assured him he left with the best wishes of all his officers. Colonel
Wallack feelingly thanked the officers for their gift and good wishes, and
expressed a desire that if it should be his lot to return to Tasmania
he would find all the officers he had left behind still in the service. It
was the intention to entertain the Colonel at a dinner on the eve of his
departure, but owing to the delay in the arrival of the Atlantian this could
not be done, hence the somewhat hurried presentation.

UEUTBNANT-COLONEL E. T. WAEEACK.
COMMANDING TASMANIAN BUSHMAN’S CONTINGENT-


Lieutenant-Colonel E. T. Wallack, Tasmanian Permanent Staff, was
sent out to South Africa as a special service officer. He was placed
in command of the First Tasmanian Bushmen to take them to Capetown,
where he was to hand them over to Captain Riggall.
He embarked at Hobart on the troopship Atlantian on March 5, 1900.
On arrival at Capetown he was ordered to proceed to Beira, South-East
Africa, to join Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Carrington’s staff. The
Bushmen went with him, and were there handed over to Captain Riggall.
Colonel Wallack ;was at once appointed staff officer, to disembark
and forward to Marendellas the Rhodesian Field Force. He then joined
Sir Frederick at the camp at Marendellas, and was appointed to the Head-
quarters Staff of the R.F.F.
While at this camp he trained the 4th and sth New Zealand Contin-
gents in the use of the magazine rifle, and assisted to raise the Rhodesian
Field Artillery.
Colonel Wallack served with Sir Frederick Carrington until the
General returned to Rhodesia, and was present at the operations against
the Boers in the Elands River, Marico, Zeerust, and Ottoshoop districts,
August Ist to September Ist.
He then joined Brigadier-General the Earl of Erroll, and served with
that officer in the active operations at Ottoshoop and its vicinity, Septem-
ber Ist to October. On October 17th Lord Erroll’s command joined
the Ist Division, and Colonel Wallack was attached to the staff, and was
present in the campaign in the Western Transvaal until January 7th, 1901.
From January 9th to 18th in hospital from injuries to the eyes, received
near Jacobsdal. January 19th, appointed staff officer for Mafeking com-
mand ; held this position for six weeks, and then proceeded to Capetown
on duty in connection with arrival of fresh colonial contingents. On
March 29th rejoined the Ist Division at Kimberley, and April Bth pro-
ceeded to Fourteen Streams, and from thence to Doornfontein, 0.R.C.,
and carried out the musketry training of the Imperial Yeomanry.
On May sth proceeded to Cowan Farm and rejoined Headquarters
of the Ist Division, and was placed in command of the troops stationed
there—about 1200 of all ranks—until granted leave on June 18th.
Was invalided for 10 weeks in England; returned to South Africa
on November Ist, but was too ill to proceed to the front. Left for Aus-
tralia, November 14th, 1901.
Mentioned in Commander-in-Chief’s despatches, April 2nd, 1901, and
awarded C.8., medal, and three clasps.
The following is a list of the members of the Bushmen Corps who
are about to leave by the troopship Atlantian: —Sergeants A. M. Boyes,
Battery Point; J. J. Gardiner, Queenstown; Farrier-Sergeant J. Smith, St.
Leonards; Corporals V. Smith, Flowerdale; H. Cox, Kindred. Troopers:

The inspection of the Bushmen Corps by the Commandant
(Colonel Legge), announced for 11.30 o’clock on Saturday morning, did
not take place until close on 1 o’clock. The men, mounted on their horses,
were then marched round the Barrack Square, and examined by the
Commandant. Some of the horses were difficult to keep in line, but the
appearance of the men generally was satisfactory.
Presentation to Trooper Towers.—Mr. T. S. Todd, on behalf of the
Cascade Brewery, on behalf of the Wesley district presented Trooper
Towers, who is one of the Tasmanian Bushmen Contingent, with a silver-
mounted pipe and tobacco pouch. Mr. Todd, chairman of the Weslev
Road Trust, made the presentation, and remarked that the services ren-
dered by Trooper Towers in the district were highly appreciated. Patri-
otic songs were gone through, and many speeches made wishing him God
speed. Trooper Towers acknowledged the gift and good wishes in
manlv fashion. The little ceremony took place on Saturday at the Vic-
toria Tavern.
Presages of the Future.
WHY MORE AUSTRALIANS ARE WANTED.
It will be seen from our telegrams that the message sent to the
Government of Victoria from the Imperial Government, as to more men
being desirable, does not in the least imply that there is any fear of


-foreign intervention. ine British Government has made the discovery
that the Australasian forces are well adapted lor a guerilla war, and that
is the war which has been threatened by Joubert when the big battles
.are over. For our own part, we do not believe that the Boers will pro-
long the strife when once they are fairly beaten in the field, because they
have their farms to look after, and they have families to support. ihe
true cause of the whole bad business was the belief that the British could
be easily beaten, as every resident in South Africa has said; and when
once this delusion is destroyed there will not remain much stomach for
further fighting. Moreover, it is well to remember that as soon as the
goldfields are secured there will be a rush of miners, who this time will
all be armed, and, we may expect, organised into volunteer corps, ihey
will know how to deal with the Boers quite well, apart from the Im-
perial troops left in the country, besides which Kimberley, Ladysmith,
Mafeking, and other places will be strongly held, and will be bases of
operation for the future. As for the fear of intervention which we hear
of from time to time, we do not believe that it has any warrant. No
doubt France would be pleased if such a thing was possible, but there
is a very salutary fear of the British fleet, which keeps the peace of the
world in quite a remarkable manner. And we may point out to those
friends of peace who screamed out about the increase of the fleet that
without that increase there might have been intervention and a war which
involved some of the largest nations in the world. It was said that this
increase was a threat likely to awaken hostility, but we can now see
that the hostility was always there, but it is controlled by a salutary fear
of consequences. All this points to the moral that if Great Britain de-
sires to live in peace, and found those colonies which have become such
remarkable monuments of her wisdom, she must be prepared to defend
Ferself against all comers.
Events at the seat of war in South Africa are now the hourly* ex-
citement of Tasmanians of all degrees, as they are flashed through piece-
meal by the cables. With the British all over the Empire, the people
of this colonv rejoice or sorrow as the news received is good or indicative
of loss of life and temporary reverses for our arms, the presence of our
own “boys in kharki” at the front adding not a little to the intensity with
which we watch the progress of hostilities. The fierceness of the struggle
just at this particular juncture has not abated by a single jot the deter-
mination of Tasmanians generally to take their part in the work of the
British Empire in bringing the world under the humanising and civilis-
ing influences which will protect the interests of native races where the foot
of the white man is beginning to encroach on their domain; and, as will
be seen elsewhere, the third contingent from this colony, a draft of moun-
ted bushmen, well fitted to act as scouts, or perform other incidentals
of guerilla warfare, is even now leaving for Capetown, a part of the Aus-
tralian Contingent of “bushies,” whose presence in the Transvaal will,


we hope, help to produce a speedy and satisfactory termination of hos-
tilities. From the Governor and Lady Gormanston downwards, through
all ranks of society, Tasmanians are thoroughly identifying themselves
with the national movement, and are subscribing their money freely, not
only to a patriotic fund, which will help to succour those who are in-
jured in the war, or those they leave behind them, but to a Union Jack
Society, which will furnish comforts to the men in the way of clothing
suitable for the emergency.
Our Part in the War.
A NATIONAL TRIBUTE TO BRITAIN’S GREATNESS
The weeks immediately preceding the departure of the Tasmanian
Bushmen for the Cape have been marked with a display of loyal enthu-
siasm such as was never seen here before, and which would have been
creditable to any place in the whole wide British Empire. We do not
say that there has not been at least one occasion—the time of the Cri-
mean War —when public feeling was as strong and as deep as it is to-
day ; but there has never been an occasion when Hobart has made so
great and striking a demonstration. Indeed, day by day the enthu-
siasm had grown in strength, until at last there was an assemblage from
morning till night, so orderly, so well dressed, so enthusiastic, so loyal,
that it could not have been surpassed in any part of the world. Many
persons wondered where the crowds came from. No doubt a large
number came from the country, but the city itself also turned out in
holiday array, and the turn-out apparently included all the young women
and children in the city. What is more, no more enthusiastic and de-
monstrative crowd, within proper bounds, could be seen anywhere—a
fact.which shows how deeply the feelings of the people have been stirred
by recent events, and how thorough is the great Federation of the Empire
which is now being made. The old simile is still the best one; that
which was long in solution has been suddenly precipitated. The one
thing wanted to complete and perfect the great union has been supplied,
a community of feeling, a union in joy and in sorrow. The news brought
by the telegraph circles the world, and as it passes gives to each British
community the same feelings, a common joy. a common sorrow, but no
common doubt, no common fear, as to what the end will be. The whole
vast Empire is tuned, so to speak, to one note. That note is like the
sound of a trumpet, loud, defiant, and vibrating in the heart of every
loyal subject, the diapason closing full in those mighty cheers which may
be said to follow the sun in his course round the world. The scene was
the outward evidence of a great inner part, the union of minds, the union
of sentiments, the union of hearts, all beating responsive to one great
impulse. This demonstration was most effective and impressive, because
it was preparation for the reception of men from another colonv. and

the heartiness of their reception was the living proof that the colonies
are one. 'lney were not strangers, but friends. 1 hey seemed not to
have expected the reception which they received, but Hobart at no
time would have allowed such a body of men to pass unwelcomed, while
the arrival of the New South VVales Bushmen Corps formed just a fit-
ting climax to the rejoicings of the previous days. All are alike the
soldiers of the Queen, who represents the great sentiment of the Km-
pire, which has revealed itself in a dawn of thunder peals that amaze and
frighten the nations of the world. —“Tasmanian Mail.”
Corporal J. Coleman’s Notes.
TASMANIAN BUSHMEN’S CONTINGENT.
It was on the sth of March, 1900, I left Tasmania in the transport
“Atlantian” with the First Tasmanian Bushmen. My first impression of
South Africa when our troops first landed at Beira was not favourable. The
surrounding country seemed anything but encouraging for our future wel-
fare. From the cool climate of Southern Australia and Tasmania we
found ourselves plunged into oppressive heat, with little shelter from the
midday sun, and water undrinkable without first being boiled. The coun-
try is very flat and swampy, and therefore very unhealthy in the rainy
season. The flat country continues for many miles inland, and we found
at Bamboo Creek, which is 60 miles distant, almost the same features in
our surroundings. As Bamboo Creek is the end of the narrow gauge,
and the beginning of the wider, we had to make a stay until we could be
taken on. After waiting impatiently for three weeks, with men falling
sick and horses dying thick and fast around us, we were at last entrained,
and in a surprisingly short time found ourselves getting into better and
more hilly country. A few native huts are seen in clusters along the
line, with here and there gangs of natives employed in keeping the line
in repair. The natives afforded us much amusement while at work by
their mode of singing and keeping time with their picks or shovels. Halt-
ing at Massakissi for several hours, we found the place controlled by a
few English people interested in the railway, and the natives more
numerous than usual. Fruits are grown here, including bananas, peanuts,
Cape gooseberries; while tomatoes are found growing wild by the side
of the line. Travelling onward, we are pleased to reach Umtali, and
to find ourselves once more in British territory, with naturally pleasant
surroundings. Having again to change trains, we alighted, and landed
our horses ; but this time a mistake was made by camping on the flattest
and lowest part of the town. Here our horses continued falling away.
An improvement was made by shifting them to a high and drier part.
Umtali is a pretty little town, and with some fair buildings; but it seems
isolated, and living is very expensive. Being impatient to get to the
front in time for some fighting, we were much annoyed at being delayed
here for a whole week. The Canadians, who had landed at Beira after


us, had already been sent on with their big gnus. The country between
Umtali and Marandellas is indeed very picturesque. Here and there we
see in the distance what appear to be many stone houses, with a tower
and church or two; but on nearer approach we find them to consist of
huge boulders, some standing in wonderful positions on top of one an-
other, and rising to a great height (Marandellas). After a journey of
14 hours we reached Marandellas, and are pleased to meet some of our
comrades, who had gone on before, and to find that, although it was after
midnight, they had waited up to welcome us and get some supper ready.
Marandellas has very few buildings outside the military encampment, but
it owes its importance to its position as a military base and to the na-
tives, who are in great force around here, under a chief named Maran-
della. It was near here that a few fights were fought with the natives
at the time of the Mashona war, and forts are found where the natives
entrenched themselves against our forces. It seems that they were not over-
sure that our attentions would not be turned to them on this occasion,
as they seemed much relieved when our object was explained to them.
The forces now included Tasmanians and part of New South Wales, the
remainder of the New South Wales men having mostly gone to the front,
or were on their way to Bulawayo. On the Saturday before leaving, the
Tassies and South Australians, who had lately arrived, met in a friendly
game of football, the result, after a hard contest, being slightly in favour
of the former.
Preparing to March. —On Monday afternoon about 50 Tasmanians
and 50 New South Wales men lined up in preparation for their overland
trip to Bulawayo. It was to be our first march since landing in Africa,
and we all looked forward to it with pleasure; it was a march of about
three weeks. The party was under the command of Captain Riggall,
of the Tasmanian Bushmen, with Lieutenant Adams next in command.
The leaders more directly in touch with the men were Sergeant-Major
Heller, of New South Wales, and Sergeant-Major Goucher, of the Tas-
sies, S.M. Goucher being especially liked by the men for his sympathy
and forethought in looking after their needs and comfort. The mode
of travelling in Africa is totally different from that adopted by us in the
smaller continent, but of course the circumstances are very different.
There were 16 waggons in our train, and many of the men whose horses
had died were allowed on top of the loads to ride. What would be
quite a common occurrence to most Africans was to us a constant source
of interest and amusement. The novel way of yoking the bullocks, and
then the peculiar noises made by the drivers, and the swishing of their
whips, will ever be remembered by Australian bushmen. We adopted
the usual way of travelling—that is, going on most of the night, and sleep-
ing and resting in the heat of the day. The bullocks were “outspanned”
about 8 a.m., and “inspanned” again at about 40r5 in the afternoon. In
the meantime the horses and bullocks were allowed to wander at plea-
sure amongst the abundance of wild grass on the wayside. About 10
p.m. another halt is called; this time the horses are tied up to trees or


to the waggons, and a picket is mounted to keep watch until 2 a.m., when
a start is made in the early hours. The horses, travelling' very much
quicker than the oxen, generally allow them an hour or two start.
Although perhaps dreary to a long resident in the country, there were
always some aspects to cause interest to us. One day there would be
a patch of scrub, with plenty of firewood, and water. Later on we would
emerge into more open country, with little bushy trees planted at regular
intervals, as in a garden, making ns think of the apples we used to enjoy
so long, long ago. At times there was scarcely a bush as far as the
eye could see—nothing but mile after mile of ripening grass, looking in
the distance like acres of corn. When viewed apart from its many dis-
eases, the possibilities which the country opened to us seem enormous;
but when we see horses dying in such quantities, and read in the papers
of the tremendous ravages amongst cattle, we are in doubt whether it
would be wise to leave our cattle runs in Queensland and New South
Wales to take up more extensive runs in mighty Africa. Probably in
course of years nature will adapt itself to cattle life in Africa, and then
the profits to be made through dealing in this line would be very large.
The yarns that we had heard about lions, crocodiles, etc., were enough to
make the hair of any ordinary citizen stand on end; but besides being
soldiers we are bushmen, so instead of being frightened we were desirous
of meeting some of these man-eaters —that is, providing we met them in
daylight, with a large number of rounds of ammunition in our belts.
Nearing Bulawayo.—Drawing near to Bulawayo at the end of our
320 miles’ march, we found the timber very much scarcer, and had some-
times to resort to bringing cow-dung to make a fire. Occasionally we
had to carry water a distance of two or three miles, but we were mostly
warned by our conductor when this was scarce, and had it slung on
the waggon. No lions were seen by our party coming through, though
likely places that we were warned about were passed. An armed party
was mounted by the captain at night, and fires also lighted. A few
crocodiles were seen by some of the men, and we found some large species
of snake, which Sergeant-Major Goucher had skinned. We passed through
several little towns on the road, the most important being Gwelo, which
is about a hundred miles from Bulawayo. Another fair-sized place is
Enkeldoorn, where we left two or three sick men in the hospital, and
took out two who were fairly recovered. Charter is simply a station
for the B.S.A. Police, having few other buildings besides a store. We
were pleased to at last see the lights of Bulawayo from our camp fires,
and next morning we straightened ourselves a little more than usual, for
now we had come again into civilisation. After a short stay at Bula-
wayo, we had orders to saddle up and take train to Mafeking, which we
reached after a day and a half journey. The sights here as we looked
round the little town were heartrending, to see the houses smashed so much
with the bullets and the big guns. Our next move was for Rustenberg,
Guard of Convoy. This we were delighted to do, as here we thought
we would soon be in the fighting line. After a few days we reached


Zeerust, which is a small town in the Transvaal, and then on to Elands
River, in charge of convoys for Rustenberg. Almost every day we ex-
perienced the ring of bullets round ns. Up to this time we had not met
face to face with our friend Boer, though we were anxious to meet them.
On these marches we had plenty of guard and picket always on the
lookout for our friend. We experienced the living very hard at times;
we did not go short when we sighted a poultry yard or any such thing
on our track. The Tassies were not behind if a duck or turkey or even
a “grunter” was in sight. After trekking to Rustenberg and then back
to Zeerust, we had a day or two rest from marching; but we had other
work to go to, making forts and guards and pickets and patrolling, so
were always on the move at something. Alarms were given to see how
quickly we could turn out, as the enemy was supposed to be not far
away. We then received orders to tie up, so we were quickly in line,
and then we were asked who would volunteer to go out that night. Of
course we all volunteered, but as only 25 were required that night some
had to stand out. I was one amongst the 25 who went out. We marched
to Elands River, two days’ march, and a day or two later we were sur-
rounded by the enemy. This was on the 4th of August, 1900. There
were about 500 Australians, and the enemy was some 4000 strong. We
only had one Maxim and one muzzle-loading gun; our Maxim jammed.
We faced them with one muzzle-loading gun.
“East, south, and west, and nor'ward,
Their shells came screaming forward,
As we threw the sconces round us in the first light of the sun.
We got our Maxim going, and the field gun into place,
She stilled the growling of a Krupp upon our southern face.
Who would wish himself away,
Fighting in our ranks that day,
For the glory of Australia, and the honour of the race?
They called us to surrender, and they let their cannon lag;
They offered us our freedom for the striking of the flag;
But we sent the answer in—
They could take what they could win;
We hadn’t come five thousand miles to fly the coward’s rag.’’
—After Kipling.
It was a sad sight to see hundreds of horses and cattle lying dead,
and our mates killed, by our side. I was one of the unlucky men —I
was cut down by a Mauser. I got two bullets through me; I had the
little finger of my right hand blown off, and a shot through my left side,
just under my shoulder; so 1 was laid aside, only to listen to the ringing
of the bullets. It was a long twelve days there, looking out for the
relief, but at last it came.


We saw the guns of Carrington come on and fall away ,
We saw the ranks of Kitchener across the kopje gray,
For the sun was shining then
Upon twenty thousand men,
And we laughed, because we knew, in spite of hell-fire and delay,.
On Australia’s page for ever
We had written Eland's River —
We had written it for ever and a day.”
My next move was into hospital to Mafeking, and then down to Kim-
berley, where I remained till I was well.
Trooper Ronald M’lnnes’s Diary.
Trooper MTnnes writes that his diary was stolen with his kit at
Mafeking. “Since then I have contented myself with making a few notes
at odd times when I had nothing else to do. lam sorry that I can
send you nothing better.” readers will, I am sure, be interested in
these notes, for the writer of them has a remarkably caustic pen. His
forte is criticism, and in this his notes are in striking contrast with nearly
every other contributor. The spirit of the man is seen in his frank ex-
pression of opinion—sufficiently dogmatic—in a postscript to his letter,
quoted above. “P.S.—Can’t say I approve of the title of your book, as
the war extended over a tract of country probably three times the size
of the Transvaal, and probably as much fighting took place outside of it
as there was in it, and I think that fully half the Tasmanians serving out
there never entered the Transvaal.” I beg to reply, with due meekness,
that no one was ever asked to “approve of the title” of the book, and,,
further, that the war was with the Transvaal. This was the Government
with which England went to war. This was, I believe, the heading in
many newspapers right through the conflict. This is the title of the most
striking book on the subject, “The Rights and Wrongs of the Transvaal
War.” All the other Boers, Germans, Irish, and nondescripts were
allies of the Transvaalers. Personally I did not choose the title, and
perhaps this will appease the critic. But I promise my readers much
more lively criticism in the following pages. I have not felt justified
in omitting any strictures, but I must not be held as endorsing or ap-
proving them all.
“Mafeking, January 14, 1901. —Arrived in Mafeking from Kimberley
and Vryburg, and joined troop on the 10th. On the night of 14th had
a heavy rainfall, flooding all the camp. Passed half the night sitting on
my clothes to keep them dry; six inches of water over blankets. All
hands started quacking like ducks and splashing round barefooted. Most
of our blankets and kits covered with mud, but everyone treated it as a
joke. After breakfast all hands lined up before the Commandant, as
our pay was being mixed up by our officer and pay sergeant, who were-

looking out for their own interest too much for our liking. Got pay
in afternoon. Mine amounted to £y.
January 16th.—On patrol to-day for first time since rejoining. The
veldt is looking splendid —everything green and fresh after the heavy
rains. Grass is very plentiful. Went to funeral of a Victorian bushman
yesterday. _ ,
January 18.—Rained heavily. Band playing “Dead March tor Bed-
ford, who died yesterday.
January 20. —Our white-livered officers and N.C.O s have given one
of the boys fourteen days’ hard labour and myself twenty-one days C.B.
May the devil speedily take them for his own!
January 28. —Tasmanians and South Australians left by train for
Tarings, to rejoin the column under Lord Methuen. Arrived heic at
Tarings on 29th (yesterday), and went out to the camp, about a mile from
railway station, near the river, which is at present dried up, with the ex-
ception of a few large pools, which serve for watering horses and bathing
in. The water is very muddy. The veldt for a good distance around
camp is quite bare, and the ground is loose, sandy soil. The dust is feai-
ful when the wind blows, which is nearly always. I think it has been
blowing for four or five months without ceasing for more than a few
hours at a time. It is one of the worst things we have to put up with
in this campaign. A camp in the loose soil is sure to turn to a bed of
dust in a few days, and it seems to be labour lost to wash ourselves or
our clothes, for everything is filthy in a few minutes after. A great deal
is said about the patriotism of the colonials, but there is a great
number of them at present in South Africa who will not fight again out-
side of their own country. They are heartily sick of it—not of fight-
ing, but the want of it, and sick of the petty tyranny of junior officers
who are incompetent, and as scum always rises to the top I guess that
is the reason they are in that position. There are some fine fellows
amongst the officers; the devil help us if there were not, for there are
a lot of bad ones. Worse and worse! Camp is in a plain with loose sand
several inches deep, and Tarings “takes the bun” for being the dirtiest and
dustiest camp we have struck. We take our horses out to graze. Poor
wretches! A lot of grass they get. There is none within three miles.
On 31st we got orders to get ready to trek at 4.30 next morning.
We pack kits, and have no waggon to carry them, so they are sent into the
railway station, under the charge of “Yours truly,” ’cos I am not well
enough for the march. Weather is fearfully hot, and yesterday and to-
day it has threatened to rain, and we hear a little thunder, and that
is our share.
February 13th. —During the past week we have had some very heavy
rain, especially last night. The bare veldt round the station is covered
with pools of water. The train is late this morning too. Leaving Tarings
after about a fortnight’s stay, I went with baggage to Fourteen Streams
(as the station is called), on the Vaal River. The place gets its name
from the river here dividing into fourteen streams at the point where


the railway bridge spans the Vaal. The bridge is a fine one of ten spans
of about 40ft. each, and is built of iron. Four spans were destroyed
by the Boers. This is where Holloway played a leading part. After put-
ting in about ten days at this place, all details were ordered to proceed
to Klerksdorp to join Methuen, but when we got to Kimberley we were
ordered to go into camp, where we are at present.
March 4. —In hospital to-day with bad teeth and general collapse.
After three months in hospital I was sent out into the convalescent camp,
where I put in about fifteen days. This camp is a disgrace to any civilised
country. The patients, instead of resting before returning to their regi-
ments, are made to do guard and picket duty, fatigues, etc., even when
excused duty by the doctor. The camp is run by a few non-com. officers,
who are probably wanting in pluck, and prefer to remain in camp instead
of going to the front. They are very comfortable, and want for no-
thing. There is no system whatever about the working of the camp,
everything being muddled through anyhow. Men are forced back into
hospital through being harassed and overworked, when a little rest at
the start would have fitted them for duty. The camp itself is filthy, no
attempt being made to drain it properly, although the camp has been
here about ten months. Sanitation is almost ignored, though the men
themselves are a great deal to blame in this respect. The food is not
so good as we get on the trek. Bread and jam and boiled beef or mut-
ton is the fare, and no vegetables, while the meat is generally well mixed
with sand and flies. Some parts of the hospital are little better. The
marquee I occupied last month was flooded by every heavy rainfall,
and often lay on the floor for two or three days. Once or twice this
marquee was blown down, and I got drenched several times. As a
result of this and the treatment I received at the convalescent camp, I
am in hospital once more with rheumatism.
April 12th. —To-day is the 18th, and the N.S.W. and South Aus-
tralian Bushmen have gone to Worcester, en route for home. The Tas-
manian Bushmen, having been sent to Vryburg to take a convoy of
supplies to Kuruman, will not follow for some time, and it will probably
be at the end of the month that they will get to Worcester. I intend
joining them when they pass through Kimberley, for I can do with an-
other week’s rest. To-morrow (20th) a convoy leaves for Capetown, of
invalids. One of the Tasmanians is going with it, with the intention of
going to England.
May 4th. —Tasmanian Bushmen passed through Kimberley to-day,
on their way to the coast to mobilise for home, leaving one man at Vry-
burg wounded, and myself and another in Kimberley Hospital. I am
still here, thanks to the “careful” attention of the young students, who
have come out here to practise on us. These cubs are on a par with our
half-fledged officers, who have passed through here on their way home,
without a thought of how we who are left behind were to get along. They
know we have no money, and care very little. Our noble Lieutenant
Adams came into the hospital some time back, and left again without com-


ing near us. This is the sort of creatures we have to lead us. I expect
he came to see one of the giddy things called nurses, who put in all
their spare time gadding about with the young doctors and any officers
they can pick up, to the neglect of their patients. It is a wonder some
of them do not develop the bubonic plague, for they have rats very
bad.
May 16th.—Got marked out of hospital last Sunday specially to join
mv company at Worcester, but am still here in this cursed place called
Convalescent Camp (save the mark!), unable to do duty, and cannot get
away, for a man here is beneath the notice of the high-and-mighty things
that we have to look after us. They only recognise the claims of a body
of men that is likelv to be useful, but a single individual is as nothing to
the powers that be. Thieving and drunkenness run riot in the camp.
The noble animal called “Tommy” is on view without any gilt or paint,
and the least said of him the better. I like him best a long way off. Ar-
rived in Capetown on Sunday, about the 12th May—just in time to see the
bushmen off to embark. They had not taken a berth for me, so couldn t
go, and didn’t care. Spent a fortnight in Capetown; got my discharge
from the Bushmen, and, wishing to see the country north of Johannes-
burg and Pretoria, I joined the Bush Veldt Carbineers, said to be com-
posed mostly of Australians, and with exceptional advantages and extra
pay for oversea colonials with experience. Advertised as a special corps.
“Quite right.” It is a “special corps,” with a view (on the part of the
officers) of making money. The whole thing is about the worst com-
bination in South Africa—a rotten swindle from the beginning, engi-
neered bv Jews, storekeepers, and others, who have but one object, and
that is to make monev somehow, no matter how the men got on. There
are a lot of good men with experience in the corps, but a great part are
Jews and Boers, who have surrendered a few months back, and who have
greater Hbertv than the British, being allowed to go back and forth to
the Refugee Laager and the town, while we are shut up almost as much
as convicts; indeed, it has been suggested that the camp should be called
the B.V. Convict Station. We have scarcely any rest, having to do half-
a-dozen different guards and two outposts, besides several patrols each
dav, and little more than too men in camp. Every other man in camp
is an officer, or non-com. officer, who have a very good time. Polo-
playing each dav bv the officers, each of whom has two polo ponies (the
best in camp), besides his own horse, and we have to do the work with
the worst. Some of our mounts are no larger than a full-grown donkey,
and one out of every six is on the sick lines. Sometimes the officers will
get up a shooting party, and go out ten or twelve miles, and of course
have to have an escort of a dozen or more to see that the “Beastly Boahs”
do not snipe them. The latest is forty recruits from the Refugee Laager,
Boers who have been in the bush veldt looking after their cattle, while
others did the fighting. These cowards are coming in now in large num-
bers. with all their cattle and sheep, waggons, etc., and are allowed to
keep them, being in the laager, and a lot of them are given rifles, horses.

and ammunition, and they are free to go and come as they please. I m
sure that something will happen when these men come into camp tor it
is out of all reason to expect true Britishers to serve along with such crea-
tures, and it shows the stamp of officers we have who would do such a
thing. (N.B.— This move did not come off, owing to the attitude of
the B.V.C.’s.) The Australians and others are up in arms against it.
I do not think that Lord Kitchener knows what is going on, for he would
not insult us by putting us on a level with these Dutchmen.
July ist. —About forty men of “C” Squadron sent to relieve BA .C. ®
stationed at Cheenespoort and Streipoort, about 22 miles S.E. of Pieters-
burg, and on the road to Lydenburg. About 100 of the Wiltshires are
stationed at Chunespoort, a very narrow pass in the Lydenburg range,;
and might be held by a few men against an army. The River Zano
runs through this pass. On the east side of the entrance the kopjes
are very steep, rising abruptly from the river bank to the height of about
1 oooft., and crowned by a wall of rock resembling the Great Wall of
China. It is from 50ft. to 200 ft. in height, and extends nearly the whole
length of the ridge. On the west side is a huge kopje somewhat re-
sembling a saddle or the hump on a camel’s back. A wall of rock runs
from this to a point in the ravine opposite the end of the wall on the
other side, forming a natural gateway, or poort, as it is called by the
Boers About a mile from the place are kaffir kraals, and daily we ge
a visit from some of the niggers, carrying fowls, eggs, and kaffir beer,
which they barter for blankets or clothing. The women build our huts
for us as we are without tents, and the nights are very cold, our blankets
being’ covered in the morning when we sleep out. The hills around
are full of baboons and little grey monkeys. Jackals make themselves
heard at night around the camp, and there is a fair amount of small game
around, such as partridges, ducks, springhare, etc. Plenty of wood and
water, and niggers to fetch them, and not much duty, goes a long way
towards making a pleasant time in camp. We are allowed to shoot game
out of earshot of camp, which would be about two miles. The officers
brought in a small bok, called Duiker, alive this morning, which they
caught while out shooting. Boers are reported near the outposts, and
a patrol is about to start after them. Most of the Boers who surrender
are in a miserable state, rotten with fever and crippled with rheumatism,
and are greatlv surprised to find that they are well treated when they
come in * Kaffir women from the kraals near by were engaged to build
o-rass huts for us, and just as they were about completed eleven of us
were ordered back to Pietersburg, and after a rest of two or three days
sixty men of “B” and “C” squadrons, with half a dozen waggons, started
for the N.E. to join “A” squadron, 75 miles out, starting at 12 p.m. on
the 10th. We reached our destination at 5 p.m. on the 12th, and found
4 ‘A” squadron encamped on Briscoes farm, with about 40 Boeis, with
women and children and waggons, which they had captured further to
the N.E. Six Boers were killed, and one man on our side, who was a


surrendered burgher —Van Buhren by name. There are two fine farms
here, about a mile apart, with large orchards, oranges being very plen-
tiful, and there is plenty of good water close by.
14th. —Shifted camp to-day about a mile and half back to a large
fort on the top of a kopje commanding the road and overlooking a fine
farm (Lovedale Park, Cooksley’s), and orchard, situated near the road
on the south side.
Sunday, 15th. —Boers left to-day, under escort, for Pietersburg. Am
on guard at farmhouse, and have been listening to a band of niggers sing-
ing hymns and sol-fa music. It seems strange to hear niggers singing
in this out-of-the-way place, near the Limpopo, the same old tunes that
we sang at home, and it is a treat to hear them, for the niggers—men
and women—sing all the parts and keep excellent time, with a frosty-
looking old nigger, dressed in a long coat, as leader. Oranges, lemons,
citrons, bananas, and other fruits are grown on this place, while maize
is to be seen nearly ten feet high. When not on duty, such as guard or
picquets, we have a lazy time; plenty of Kaffir boys to cook our scoff, fetch
wood and water, wash our clothes, groom, feed, and water our horses,
and fetch coffee to us in bed—all this on active service. This corps is
nothing more nor less than police. We have no guns, and there are
as many Boers in the vicinity as there are men in the 8.V.C., so that
there will not be much fighting, for they have a very strong position, and
are reported to have two guns. This fort is called Fort Hendrik, and
the district Little Spelonken. Tuli, on the other side of the Crocodile
River, is about 4 miles distant, with the Zoutspanberg range of mountains
in between.
To-day (July 19th, 1901) the British flag was hoisted, and the fort
was re-named Fort Edward, in honour of his Majesty King Edward VII.
A salute was fired, the National Anthem sung by the troops, and a bottle
of whisky broken (carefully, into a bucket!) to christen the flag, and the
troops treated to whisky, and our photos taken by one of the ladies
present —for even in this out-of-the-way place we have the ladies, two of
the notorious Colonel Schiel’s sons being present. They are in the In-
telligence Department here, under Captain Taylor. The officers and ladies
are having their photos taken outside the gate of the fort, with a tattered
old L T nion Jack in the background, mounted on a waggon.
July 24th. —Twenty men were sent out towards Pietersburg last Fri-
day to meet a convoy of ox waggons, which we met about 30 miles out.
Camped at river one night, and several jars of rum were looted off the
ration waggon. Great hubbub about it, and two men were put under
arrest for being the worse for liquor. On Monday we reached the fort,
and last night a case of rum disappeared. Several more arrests were
made, including the sergeant-major (Morrison), who cleared out this morn-
ing towards Pietersburg in a buggy. Eight men were sent out after
him, but it is doubtful if they will catch him, as he got two hours’ start.
Most of the men and officers have gone north-east to try to capture some
Boer convoy reported in that direction.


25th. —A small party of ns (fifteen in number), Lieutenant 1 icton in
command, set out north-east at 10 a.m., taking a more easterly direction,
about 20 miles from the fort. Camped about 36 miles out at a i 01-
tuguese house, moving on early next morning a few miles to the next
farmhouse, occupied by a man named Ash. After a halt of a few minutes,
five men and a sergeant, including myself, were sent on ahead to recon-
noitre. We took up a position on a low ridge, about three miles out, and
on both sides of the road. The first to come along was a Cape cart,
drawn by two men, two Boers sitting on the front of the cart, and one
riding a’ donkey bringing up the rear. These were allowed to pass,
and the sergeant and two men, who were on the opposite side of the
road, followed up through the grass. I did the same on our side, the
other two men remaining behind on the kopje. When within 100 yards
the sergeant and party opened fire on the Boers, I following suit. We
succeeded in wounding a dog and the two oxen, while the Boers cleared
off through the tall grass. The others of our party, hearing the firing,
now came up and got into position. Before this, however, two natives
came up, and a mob of. cattle and a saddled donkey. I got these hidden
away, and when the lieutenant’s party came up we sighted a waggon and
cattle. These were passing, when we rushed out and captured them.
There were two Boers and two boys, each armed, but their arms were
all on the waggons. We then set out for the fort with our capture,
and reached the Swiss Hospital, six miles from camp, on the evening of
the 27th. Earlv next morning the prisoners and cattle set out for the
fort, under a small escort. The remainder of our party, twelve in number,
returned to Hayes’ farm, where we were to wait for the officer and the
escort to reioin us.
2 gth.—We have now reached Da Tonsega, about 36 mih s from camp
fort, and await Lieutenant Hannan’s party, who are out about 17 miles
N.E. We are in the midst of our enemies at present. A party of Boers
weie encamped on a kopje a mile and a half distant from this place the
night after we came through with the prisoners and cattle, while forty
mounted Boers were in pursuit of us up to this place. Commandant -Kelly
is reported in the vicinity, with his commando of sixty Boers. A few
davs back a party of Boers raided Schiel’s farm, taking away a lot of
cattle. There is' bush and tall grass all over this part of the country,
and it is very much broken, especially between the Swiss Hospital and
the fort, which part is very hilly. The hospital is well situated, and
is a very nice building, splendidly fitted out. One of our sergeants is
tiiere at present with two broken ribs. Llannan s party passed a few
miles to the south in the night, en route for the fort, so that our small
party of fifteen is practically on its own. A reinforcement is expected,
however.
August 1 st. Ten more men arrived last night, and early this morning
we set out, leaving one man in camp. After riding about six miles to
Ash’s farm we made a halt of about an hour, and then divided into small
parties, for two mounted Boers were reported in the neighbourhood, and


several waggons on their way in, about a mile and a half from Ash’s farm,
ihe party on the left Hank sighted the two Boers and gave chase. They,
however, did not try to escape, and surrendered quietly. A few minutes
later three waggons were seen, and we soon had them surrounded and
the men disarmed. An ambush was laid for the other waggons, which
were some distance behind. These were successfully captured in detail,
and by two o’clock were all laagered at the drift close by—seven waggons
and two Cape carts in all, drawn by oxen and donkeys, fourteen prisoners,
and about 17 rifles, with a quantity of ammunition, and about 30 women
and children, and a number of cattle. A very promising start for the month.
The whole convoy reached camp at Da Tonsega’s between 8 and 9 o’clock
at night, proceeding to the fort to-day (August 2) with a small escort.
Our next move is already planned, for a well-known Boer farmer (Klop-
per), whose farm is near the Swiss Hospital, with a party of about ten
men and five waggons, with some of their families, are laagered forty-five
miles north-east, and probably we shall be on their trail to-morrow. On
the day following the despatch of prisoners we set out at 3 a.m., 13 all
told, including the sergeant and the Swiss guide, reaching the kraal of
the Kaffir chief (M’wamba), who sent in the information concerning the
Boers, at midday, the guide going on with a native to locate the Boers
and find out their strength, etc. He returned at midnight with a good
report, having been quite close to the waggons, and heard the Boers talk-
ing. They apparently did not know there were any British in that part
of their country. At 3 a.m. we set out, and after a tedious ride of nearly
12 miles we got near the camp. Leaving our horses to look after them-
selves, we set out on foot, getting round the further side of the laager,
and about 50 yards from the waggons. It was breaking day, and some
of the Boers were sitting round the fire. Out we rushed, dashed through
the spruit between, and with a yell of “Hands up!” we were upon them.
1 hey were so much taken by surprise that not one of them moved. We
soon turned the rest out of blanket, and made them fish out all the rifles
and ammunition. d here were thirteen Boers, including two or three
boys, and a good many women and children. Some of the kids were
only a few months old, and their mothers dead, while others were ill with
fever. The Boers had killed two rhei bok the day before, and a lot of
guinea fowl, so we soon had a good breakfast prepared, and the most of
the Boers and the women were quite sociable before we started to trek.
I think that most of the poor wretches were glad that we had taken
them. Their leader, Klopper, is a fine-looking Boer of about 50, and
his wife, second or third, is very pretty, and only 18 years old, and has a
baby about six months old. About 9 a.m. we set out for Fort Edward,
75 miles away; four ox waggons, one donkey waggon, two light carts, and
about 75 head of cattle and donkeys, and three horses, which were sorrv-
looking objects. The whole convoy reached the fort on the fourth day
of trek. On our way out to capture Klopper I was attacked with fever,
but held on till the capture was made, and then kept in the saddle, with
the exception of two or three halts on the way, the rest of the journey as


far as the Swiss Hospital, where I have outspanned, having ridden 100
miles after getting the fever and without sleep, travelling the last 40 miles
at a temperature of 103, arriving at the hospital in company with the Swiss
guide at 7 o’clock in the morning. The Elim Hospital, as it is called,
is a fine building, and all the people are Swiss, the doctor being a mis-
sionary as well. There is a mission station about a mile away, all Swiss
too —very nice people, all of them. There are four of the B.V.C. beside
myself here with fever and other complaints, our doctor having left the
fort, and gone to Pietersburg, on the 29th of July. Captain Hunt went
out last week from the fort to M’jagi, and attacked \ iljoen’s house with
only fifteen men, while the Boers were 50 in number. Captain Hunt and
Sergeant Eland were killed, and two Viljoens and three other Boers
were accounted for on the other side. A stronger party, under Lieu-
tenants Morant and Picton, followed the Boers, and came up with them
two days later; and by a huge piece of bungling on the part of the former
were allowed to escape, leaving all their provisions and two carts on the
laager. Such affairs as this are cpfite common, and will continue so
while we have such creatures for officers. Little wonder that the war
continues ! Here is a specimen of the wonderful ability of some of them.
A sergeant-major, belonging to a party which had captured some Boers
with their waggons and cattle, was sent further on with eight men and
one of the captured Boers to bring in half a dozen waggons and eleven
Boers who were laagered in another part. A hen within half a mile, the
sergeant-major sent the Boer to tell the other Boers to come out and
leave their rifles and surrender, thus giving the Bocis warning enough
to defend their laager, as well as giving the messenger a chance to join
them, and all could have escaped had they wished. The same genius
conceived the brilliant idea of stacking all 0111 rifles and putting a guaid
over them, so that the Boers could not rise and take them from us while
we slept. Yet these are the “things” we have to obey. How the Boers
must laugh when they see our leaders make such idiotic blunders, which
the most ignorant Boer would be incapable of! [lt would be interesting
to hear the other fellow’s version.]
August 18th.—Went out two days ago with thirty others under Lieiw
tenant Hannan to do something or other (I have not yet found out whether
they had anv definite object or not). We rode about /O miles with-
out any result. We have been on short rations foi seveial days, and
now we are without either biscuits, flour, or sugar. No news of outside
affairs, anv further than Pietersburg. We don t know how the war pio-
gresses (and don’t care). Had a fight last week with about 60 Boers;
our casualties, one wounded, while another accidentally shot himseh
through the chest and arm coming back. The Boer loss not known.
August 22nd. —A trooper shot himself through the fingers and leg
through a revolver accident this morning. A small party left for Leyds-
dorp. Boers still coming in. De Beers and several men on their way,
under escort.


August 28th.—Two native spies were shot this afternoon; was detailed
for firing party, but missed it.
September Ist.—Eight Boers captured and shot, and later on three
more got a free ticket for “Kingdom come,” as one trooper said. A night
attack by a party of B.V.C.’s on a Boer laager resulted in a glorious
victory, killing two children and wounding another! A missionary was
found between here and Pietersburg shot through the heart, and his
mules and buggy were found in the bush. About twenty Boers left last
week under escort for Pietersburg. This part of the country is getting
cleared of them.
September 20th.—Have not had a change of clothing for two months,
and no soap for a fortnight. Convoy of provisions arrived several days
ago. Several bales of clothing came out from Pietersburg, and weather
\eiy cold and wet, but cannot get any clothing, as the only officer here
is too thickheaded to do anything for us, and we all have to wait until
the officers come in, while we have to boil our clothes frequently to kill
the 'vermin. If some of these dunderheaded creatures, wearing stars,
found their proper level, the majority of them would be earning their living
with the pick and shovel—brainless idiots, whose only thoughts are for
the liquor that they swill, like the pigs they are.
2 ?th. Party left this afternoon for Fort Trichard in the Zoutpansberg
Range, where two Boers are hanging out. It is doubftul if they will
catch them, but if they do I expect there will be two Boers less to-morrow,
according to the methods of the B.V.C.’s.
October 2nd. A troop under Lieutenant Morant brought us as pri-
soners Commandant Kelly and party. They were captured by them near
the Portuguese border, eleven men, and three waggons. Another lot of
six Boers were brought in a few days after, and all were sent into Pie-
tersburg.
October 13th. Three large parties of Boers are reported in the neigh-
bourhood, and the garrison has to stand to arms from 4 till 5 every morn-
ing, while men are posted during the day on the kopjes some distance
from the fort. Rations are finished, with the exception of a few bis-
cuits, and we will be reduced to living on mealie pap if a convoy does not
arrive soon.
2l? t- Convoy of provisions came in to-day, and a relief garrison.
2 5th- —Pietersburg. On arriving nearly all our officers were arrested,
and will be sent to Pretoria for trial. They are all implicated in some
dirty business which took place in Zoutpansberg district. The corps will
probably be disbanded, as there are only about a hundred and twenty
men left.
26th. 1 laved a cricket match with the Gordon Highlanders, and lostj
played again next day, and lost again.
28th and 29th. —Won two matches against Artillery.


October 30th. —Have been at Pietersburg a week. All the garrisons
at Fort Edward and Majajgie and all the officers from each are under
arrest, five, and the sergeant-major, six. No one is allowed to leave
till the enquiry is over, although a lot of men are time-expired, and a good
deal of growling is the result. The corps is in bad odour at present, and
I shall not be sorry to quit it when my time is up.
November 3rd. —Convoy to Chunespoort and Streipoort.
November 13th. —News came in from Yankee Lewis the Liar that
he was surrounded by about 600 Boers, and that a convoy in charge of
Lieutenant Baudinet was also unable to get through to the port. All
officers and men, with the exception of half a dozen, went out to-night at
10 o’clock to relieve Lieutenant Lewis. This Lewis took out a party
some time back to attack a Boer laager, and, getting within 15 00 yards
of it, he opened fire, though nothing could be seen to fire at, and after
a few shots were fired in return by the Boers he gave the order to retire,
and fled, as if the devil were after him. Later on he started with a convoy
to Spelonken, and when fifteen miles from Pietersburg he shut himself up
in a fort at Klepdam, put three-fourths of his men on guard, and sent in
word that he was unable to go any farther, and that the country between
him and the fort at Spelonken was swarming with Boers. A party was
sent out, but Lewis would go no farther, and brought back the convoy
to Pietersburg. There were no Boers nearer than a hundred miles dis-
tant. [One would like to hear the “other fellow’s” story.]
November 16th. —Beyers’s commando, Pretorius, and one or two other
parties surrounded the Fort at Spelonken. There were about 300 Boers.
A convoy in charge of Lieutenant Baudinet got through, and seventy men
went out from Pietersburg to reinforce the garrison, and drove off the
Boers, chasing them for sixty miles, killing and wounding five, and taking
prisoner Beyers’ lieutenant, who had his horse killed. The Boers fled
westward, past Myra. Some very fast riding was done in this chase;
first trek ninety-six miles, without unsaddling, and this was kept up for
four days and nights, covering nearly 380 miles. Most of the horses
were knocked up, and several died from exhaustion. The Boers made no
attempt to stand, although outnumbering us three to one.
December Bth. —A party of Boers belonging to Beyers' commando
occupied a kopje about four miles east of the town of Pietersburg, and
the B.V.C. were ordered out to drive them off. The Boers, however, did
not wait for us. Their object in coming so close to the town was to
induce some of the refugees to join them. Six of these were missing
from the camp this morning.
December 10th. —Left Pietersburg this morning for Pretoria for dis-
charge, arriving in Capetown on the 151k. Embarked for Hobart on
18th on the “Aotea,” reaching Hobart on the 9m January, after a very fair
trip of 22 days.
[Here follow some notes of the earlier part of the campaign.]


Trooper R. M’lnnes Notes,
FIRST TASMANIAN BUSHMEN AND 8.V.C..
THE NOOK, Tasmania.
Landed at Beira from S.S. Atlantian on 12th April, 1900, after a
lengthy sojourn of forty days on board. At Capetown there was a bit
of a difficulty with the firemen, and some were put in irons. \ olunteers
were called for, so with two other Tasmanians I descended to the infernal
regions of the old Hungry Goose Liner and shovelled coal a rather
trying experience, for we had to get what sleep we could in the day-
time, and on a troopship carrying nearly 600 men and as many horses
there is not much chance of a nap in the daytime. I was not sorry when
we dropped anchor in the River Pungue at Beira. After a few days
here some of the boys were sent to Marandellas, nearly 800 miles from
the coast. Two-thirds of the Tasmanian Bushmen were left at Bamboo
Creek, 61 miles from Beira, with the horses, for nearly three weeks, with
another week at Lmtali, without a change of clothing, and only about
a dozen blankets among the lot, our kits and other gear having been
sent on ahead. While at Bamboo Creek we saw the Canadian Artillery
pass through to relieve Mafeking. Most of our horses died before reach-
ing Bulawayo, where we arrived about the last week in May. A very
cordial reception awaited us, and the people of Bulawayo did their best
to make our stay a pleasant one. The next move was to Mafeking, where
the gallant 8.-P. held his own against big odds. Mafeking in my opinion
is a bad place to attack if held by resolute men, for there is no cover
for an attacking party, as the surrounding country for some miles is al-
most flat. The kopjes that we read about (Cannon Kopje, Game Tree
Hill, etc.) are conspicuous by their absence when one is on the scene.
The so-called kopjes are nothing more than a slight swell in the veldt,
scarcely noticeable, and affording very little cover unless entrenched. There
is some broken ground about the banks of the Molopo River, which runs
close by the south side of the town. This is, however, occupied by the
Baralong Staadt, containing several thousand natives, who gave the Boers
a warm time when they attempted to storm the town on that side. It
is said that a great many of Eloff’s men who fled when the attack failed
were cut to pieces by the natives as they retreated through the Staadt.
From Mafeking we trekked to Zeerust, a distance of forty miles. While
here we saw General Carrington pass through with a small column to
the relief of the gallant little band of bushmen and South Rhodesian Volun-
teers who were besieged at Elands River by De la Rey, with a large force
of Boers and artillery. The garrison had only an old seven-pounder
muzzle-loader and a Maxim for defence. Two Tasmanians were among
the besieged—S.M. Goucher and Trooper Phelan.
The attempt to relieve them by General Carrington proved an utter
failure, and some very hard things have been said about the half-hearted
way in which the attempt was made. Then followed the retreat to
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.


Mafeking, which no Australian who took part in it will forget. The re-
treat was orderly enough, for there was plenty of time, as no signs of
Boers were to be seen in pursuit. An immense pile of stores, estimated
at ±IOO,OOO worth, was set fire to; and then how the Boers must have
laughed at the spectacle of nearly 2000 men, with about a dozen guns,
running away from nothing! for it is said that only 25 Boers entered
the town after the British forces left it. Certain it is that De la Rey
did not follow, and the Boer force under Commandant Lemmer was not
more than 800, and without artillery, which occupied the district when
evacuated by the troops under Carrington. After a rest of three or four
days we marched out again to Malmain, 22 miles, and found the village of
Ottoshoop occupied by the Boers, who fled at our approach. Early next
morning the advance guard came into action with the enemy, and by
midday a general engagement was in progress, the Boers occupying a
long ridge crossing the main road to Zeernst, and four miles from Mal-
main. By nightfall the enemy had been driven from every position and
scattered. Our loss was light —about half a dozen casualties. After
occupying the position for a couple of days, the troops retired into Otto-
shoop, when General Carrington left us, earning an unenviable reputation
among the men under his command. Then followed a spell of garrison
duty for six or seven weeks, varied only by an occasional patrol and
a combined attack by three columns on the Boers at the head of the
Malopo River, which resulted in the capture of a number of Boers and
their laager. Soon after this I was laid up with an attack of malarial
fever, and had to travel in a truck behind a traction engine into
Mafeking over a stony road —a fearful experience—and to move
on to Kimberley soon after. While at Mafeking Hospital my kit
(containing my diary, a record of the trip, and other events up to Novem-
ber, when I entered hospital) was stolen by the hospital orderlies. This
was a common occurrence, and patients were frequently robbed, especially
those who were too sick to look after their kits when entering the hospital.
While in garrison at Ottoshoop several very good sports meetings were
held, including horse-racing, and were thoroughly enjoyed by the troops.
The Tasmanians won several events. Open-air concerts proved a great
success, some first-class talent being brought to light. There were about
800 mounted men in the garrison, and a battery of artillery, with several
Maxims and pom-poms. These troops were shut in Malmain for nearly
two months, chafing under the restraint and “spoiling for a fight,” well
mounted, and with horses in splendid condition, while infantry were being
dragged about the country in pursuit of well-mounted men, who eluded
them without the slightest difficulty.
On the arrival of General Methuen the garrison formed his column,
and remained with him until May, 1900, doing good work all through the
Western Transvaal. The troops serving under Lord Methuen were
unanimous in their praise of him, and he won the respect of everyone by
his kind thoughtfulness of his men. He is a thorough soldier and a
perfect gentleman, who worked hard and without show, doing his duty


conscientiously and well. No leader in the late wai is deserving of more
praise than Lord Methuen.
[This is very unlike Trooper MTnnes’s usual estimate of officers, but
it is not unlike his usual cock-sureness.]
A. V. Dyer’s Notes.
The third contingent to leave Tasmania for service in South Africa
was a company of 53 mounted men, who formed Tasmania s contribution
to the First Australian Bushmen. These men were selected to act as
scouts, and I believe the idea of sending men thoroughly trained in bush
work originated in Victoria. In Xew South Wales the cost of sending
500 men was borne entirely by the people, and at first the Tasmanian
Government decided to enrol 25 men and send them as pait of the Xe\v
South Wales Contingent; but the people took the matter up, and sufficient
money was soon collected to make the number up to 5X and it was decided
that they go as a separate contingent, and represent Tasmania.
The number of applicants was very large, and considerable difficulty
was experienced in selecting the men. Many a sad face was seen as
the Commandant (Colonel Legge) or the judges of riding informed the
eager volunteers that they would not suit, and I recollect seeing several
break down and cry like children when told to go to the Headquarters’
Office for their railway pass back to their homes.
The contingent was in barracks at Hobart about three weeks, and
left for Africa in the troopship “Atlantian” on March sth, 1900.
The people of Tasmania gave us a splendid send-off, and it will be
long ere any man of the corps will forget the march from the barracks
to the wharf. The “Atlantian” dropped anchor in Table Bay on the last
day of March, the run across taking just 26 days, and theie was great
excitement to hear the latest war news. The day before we reached
Capetown, a passing boat signalled “War still going on,’ but a member of
the contingent who had (or said he had) learned the Morse code at
school, saw the sun flashing on an empty tin on shore, and declared it
was a heliograph message, which he was unable to properly read, but he
said he distinctly saw something about “Peace declared,” and opinion
aboard was divided as to whether the signal from the boat or the heliograph
message was to be believed.
Our minds were speedily at rest when we got the newspapers from
the watermen at Capetown, and read of Lord Roberts’s advance on Bloem-
fontein, and the same afternoon some of the officers who had been ashore
brought back the news that we were to be sent up to the front at once.
This "also proved incorrect, for after spending three days in Table Bay
we left under sealed orders, being told that the regiment had been selected
for special service. What this was to consist of we were left to guess.
Some of the firemen and stokers had managed to get away at Capetown,
and volunteers were called for among the troops to go below and help
stoke the vessel. Three of the Tassies (Hillier, MTnnes, and Dyer)


volunteered, and with several of the New South Wales men went below
and took their turn with the regular hands in the stokehole—not a very
enviable place to work, with the thermometer in the coal bunkers standing
at 130 degrees.
A nine days’ run up the east coast of Africa brought the “Atlantian”
to Beira, a seaport in Portuguese East Africa, and here it was that our
contingent first set foot on the Dark Continent.
The horses had to be landed in lighters, for there were no wharves at
Beira that the “Atlantian” could get alongside, and this took several days.
As they were taken ashore they were turned loose in a large paddock on
the outskirts of the town, and given a chance to stretch their legs after
six weeks’ standing in their pens aboard ship.
It was here that we learned that the contingent were to be taken up
to Rhodesia, and from there march south to Mafeking, and there was
universal joy among the men at the prospect of having a hand in the relief
of Baden-Powell and his gallant band.
The journey across Portuguese East Africa to Marandellas, a station
about 40 miles from Salisbury, took about three weeks. The first 60
miles of the railway line was narrow gauge, and the horses were taken
to Bamboo Creek, where the narrow line ended, and for want of sufficient
trucks had to be kept there a fortnight and taken up further as rolling
stock became available.
I might mention that Bamboo Creek is a hunter’s paradise; almost
any kind of game, from a lion to a gemsbok, is to be found there, and
often of a night, while on stable guard or picquet, we could hear the lions
roaring in the distance.
At Marandellas the Government had erected large buildings, and had
stored an immense amount of provisions for horses, and men, and it was
from here that the relief column started for Mafeking. Although the
Tassies were the first men to get to Marandellas, we were not included
in the column that helped to relieve Mafeking; an escort of one hundred
■Queenslanders was chosen for that much-coveted undertaking, and they,
with the battery of Canadian Artillery, were sent through to Bulawayo
on mule coaches, teams of mules being harnessed to the guns, while we
followed with a large convoy of ox waggons. The trip lasted 19 days,
and was a regular picnic, travelling through a beautiful well watered
country. We had a splendid time of it, and were allowed to amuse our-
selves hunting, etc., through the middle of the day, when it was too warm
for the bullocks to travel.
Arriving at Bulawayo, we went into camp for a few days, and were
allowed leave of an afternoon and evening to have a look round the
town.
I was surprised to find Bulawayo lighted by electricity, and a very
well laid out town. Some of the buildings there would be a credit to
any city, notably the Grand Hotel and hospital.
Our contingent left Bulawayo on Sunday morning, and travelled bv
rail to Mafeking, a distance of about 500 miles ; the last few miles before


we reached the far-famed town we could plainly see the traces of the Boers
occupation, and we passed Colonel Plumer’s deserted camp.
My first impressions of Mafeking were disappointing. I had thought
to see the place in ruins, and many of the fellows seemed to think because
it was not so the hardships of the siege had been much overrated.
A few days spent in Mafeking, where those who had lost their horses
coming through Rhodesia were supplied with remounts, and we started
off on the warpath in earnest.
By this time the contingent had dwindled down to about 40 men;
the others had stayed behind, some in hospital, and a few secured positions
on the staff in Rhodesia.
Our first duty in the Transvaal consisted of escorting a large convoy
from Mafeking to Elands River. It was an uneventful trip, and apart
from stealing a few fowls and pigs, we had no adventures.
At Elands River we overtook one or two convoys that had gone
before. They were encamped on a hill there, and had started to entrench,
as it was reported the place would soon be attacked by a large number of
Boers.
This report proved only too true, for it was here that the First Aus-
tralian Bushmen proved what they could do in the fighting line when hard
pressed.
A handful of men (about 500) encamped on a stony ridge here defied
De la Rey with fifteen hundred men and any amount of artillery for 13.
davs, and during that time almost every living creature that was exposed
was blown to pieces with the shells the Boers threw into the camp. Tas-
mania was represented by Sergeant-Major Goucher and Trooper Phelan,
the remainder of the contingent being ordered back to strengthen the
garrison at Zeerust, some 40 miles away, a couple of days before Elands
River was surrounded.
While escorting a small convoy of waggons between Zeerust and
Elands River the Tassies received their baptism of fire, and a lively time
it was.
There were thirty of us in charge of six waggons, and some few miles
from Zeerust we were attacked by considerably over a hundred Boers, who
had the advantage of choosing a place to attack.
In the end we were driven back, and the enemy captured the convoy,
which they destroyed. We had Coleman, Kemsley, and Cowan wounded,
and Riley captured, in this affair; and it was only when further resistance
was useless that we withdrew. It was at this time that General Sir F.
Carrington, after a futile attempt to relieve Elands River, withdrew, and
destroyed all the stores that had been accumulated at Zeerust. It seemed
an awful shame to see a heap of provisions, clothing, etc., valued at between
£50.000 and £150,000, destroyed by fire, and a force of men, close on two
thousand strong, retreat to Mafeking without firing a shot. Two days
in Mafeking, and orders came to proceed into the Transvaal again, and
retake Zeerust.


ihe second day the column was engaged from daylight till dark, and
onr fellows were in the thick of it, the first troop taking part in a charge
across half a mile of open country to get provisions off a kopje the Boers
were occupying. For this and other services rendered, the Tasmanian
Bushmen were specially thanked by the General.
A few days later our contingent, with a squadron of New South Wales
Bushmen, were sent out to make a reconnaissance along the Malopo River,
between Ottoshoop and Mafeking, and a few miles from Ottoshoop we
came on the Boers at some farmhouses in a valley. There were a large
number of the enemy posted along a ridge behind the farmhouses, and
things got warm for us in a short time.
Jacson, who was riding some distance ahead of the troop, was shot
dead as he was turning his horse round to give the others warning.
It appears that the officers had orders not to engage the enemy, and
the men were ordered to retire, while two 15-pounders that we had with
us shelled the Boers' position. When the Dutchmen saw our game, they
made a determined attack, and some severe fighting ensued.
Two of the Tasmanians, Douglas and Lawson, did not hear the order
to retire, and while trying to stop the Boers, who were now coming after
the retreating Bushmen, Douglas was severely wounded; one bullet struck
him under the right arm, and passing through his body came out above
the left hip, while another bullet broke two of his ribs. Lawson, his
companion, who was some distance away, shot one man who called on
him to surrender, and then ran for it, followed by a shower of bullets.
Lie got away without a scratch, and rejoined his mates. Douglas was not
seen by the Boers, and was left lying some hours, till three Boer women
from the farms close by heard his moans, and came and carried him to their
place, where they nursed him with the greatest care for four days; then
one of the girls took a message into Ottoshoop, and an ambulance waggon
was sent, and brought him in. After six months in hospital he recovered,
but was invalided home, and when the contingent returned in June, 1901,
he told me he was just about to start back again, to have another slap at
the Dutchman who shot him.
The Red Cross waggons brought in Jacson’s body, and he now lies
in the Dutch Cemetery, on the banks of the Malmain River, with a neat
headstone to mark his last resting place.
The headstone was produced in Mafeking, and erected some time
after his death, when the contingent again passed through Ottoshoop.
About this time (August, 1900) Sir Frederick Carrington was sent back
to Rhodesia, and Lord Errol took command of his column.
During the few weeks we served under Lord Errol’s command the
contingent was used exclusively for scouting and advance work, and we
were complimented by the G.O.C. for the manner in which our work was
done.
We were constantly engaging the enemy between Lictenburg and
Zeerust, but the country was very rough, and I fear that very little good
was done, for tne Boers generally managed to get away. On one occasion


at Kaffir Kraals, however, we managed to cut off their convoy, and cap-
ture a lot of waggons, with ammunition and other stores, also several
prisoners. After being six or seven weeks under Lord Errol, the Tas-
manian Bushmen joined Lord Methuen’s column, and with the South
Australian Bushmen and three squadrons of the New South Wales corps,
we were formed into a regiment, and known as the Composite Bushmen,
the command of which was given to an English officer, Major von Donop,
From November, 1900, till March, 1901, the regiment took part in all
Lord Methuen’s operations, and during that time we travelled the Western
Transvaal, from the Marico Valley to the Vaal, and from the railway
line on the west to Rustenburg and Potchefstroom in the east, and also
had a trip through the Orange Free State.
To describe the many engagements our contingent took part in during
these five months would take more space than I would be allowed. One
fortnight, from 2nd to 16th February, 1901, while travelling between
Taungs and Klerksdorp, the column was fighting every day, and lost 16
killed and 43 wounded, and captured 5000 head of cattle and 15,000 sheep.
Several of the Tasmanians had their horses shot, and others had mar-
vellous escapes during this trip, but all escaped being hit.
On the night of March 31st, while encamped between the Vaal River
and Hoopstad, in the Free State, the column was attacked by a considerable
force of Boers, who had crept up through the long grass, and had managed
to get past the outposts.
The corner of the camp where the Tassies lay came in for particular
attention from the enemy, and as I was turning into my blankets about 9
p.m. they opened fire on us at short range.
It was a moonlight night, and the men were quickly fallen in, and the
hot fire returned. With the aid of a company of Northumberland Fusiliers,
who fixed bayonets, the attack was soon repulsed, but not before the
Boers had managed to get away with over one hundred of our horses,
that were being guarded by some blacks on the opposite side of the
road.
The horses were being brought along to supply fresh mounts to any
of the men who chanced to lose theirs through being shot, sickness, etc.,
and it was evidently a smart bit of work on the Boers’ part to capture
them.
The first week in April our contingent left the Composite Regiment
at Warrenton, and were sent up the line to Vryburg, where we formed
part of the escort to a large convoy that was being sent out to Kuruman,
a mission station, about one hundred miles west of Vryburg in Bechuana-
land.
This country was at that time infested with rebels, and only a few
months before our trip a convoy, valued at £25,000, was captured by them,
half-way between Vryburg and Kuruman.
This trip was the last we did in Africa, and from the time we left
Rhodesia the most peaceful, the men not being asked to fire a shot, in
defence of the convoy.


However, we had considerable fun shooting at the numerous flocks
of hartebeste, springbok, etc., that the country around that part abounds
with. While at Kuruman I visited the famous caves there, also the
mission station, and saw the tree planted by Dr. Livingstone on the day
he was married. The caves are very beautiful, and are said to extend
over twenty miles. They are rather dangerous without a guide, and
after going about a quarter of a mile, and losing my torch in a deep
water hole that I fell into, I decided to get back to camp and leave the
caves to others of a more adventurous turn of mind. On the trek to
Kuruman the Tasmanian Bushmen were represented by eighteen rank
and file, and were under the command of Sergeant Kemsley. Our officers
and the remainder of the contingent had been left behind at the various
places through sickness, etc., and when on the return journey the day
before we reached Vryburg, Lieutenant Adams rode out to meet us with
the news that we were to mobolise at Worcester, and proceed home. I
don t think there were many of the corps sorry, as during the fourteen
months we spent in South Africa the contingent had travelled over a lot
of country and done some hard work.
A week spent at Worcester, where we met many of our comrades,
who had been in hospital with wounds or sickness, and we were sent down
to Capetown, and left there in the S.S. “Aberdeen” on Sunday, May 19th,
1901, arriving in Launceston by the “Coogee” on Wednesday, June 12th,
having been absent from Tasmania fifteen months and seven days.
In this short account of our doings I have made no attempt to record
everything of consequence that the contingent was concerned in. An
account of that sort would require a book to itself, and a more able pen
than mine to write it; but on looking over this it occurs to me that I
should have mentioned some of my old comrades, whose conspicuous
bravery was mentioned by Lord Kitchener in despatches from head-
quarters.
Amongst these were Kemsley, MTntyre, Cox, Dowling, and Barwick,
for rescuing comrades who had lost their horses, under a heavy fire;
also Gerrand, Rockett, and Hillier, for distinguished service. Captain
A. H. Riggall, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, com-
manded the contingent up till the time we joined Lord Methuen, when he
was laid low with enteric fever, and invalided to England. I know every
man of the contingent will agree with me in saying a braver, better, or
more popular officer never left Australia.

APETOWN, April 4th, 1900. —It appears we are to leave for
Beira, some 300 miles beyond Delagoa Bay, and 1760 miles
from Capetown, in the “Euryalus,” with the Victorian “Bush-
rangers” to-morrow. We were too late for the “Atlantian,”
C 5
with the Tassfe Bushmen, as she left at 4 o’clock this morning for
the same spot.


5.5. "Euryalus,” April 6th, 1900. —Up at 7.30, Got hansom and
took our “dunnage” down to the Clock Tower Docks to go on board.
Loafing about until 11 a.m. before going on board, with some of the
V ictorian Bushmen; then we were two hours getting on board, as the
tug called at several transports before we got alongside. When I got
the skipper's things into his cabin, 1 had something to eat, kindly given
me by some of the Bushmen —first I had to-day. We left Table Bay
about 5 p.m. Had tea just after leaving. lam messing with 83. These
Bushmen are real Australians, so am in good company. I never was
asked as many questions in my life before. Quite a crowd around me.
V ery sleepy and tired, so slept soundly.
5.5. “Euryalus,” April 6th, 1900. —Put most of the day in sleeping.
Again to-day was asked a lot of questions about Africa, and the ports I have
been in, etc. Do not feel in the happiest of moods at leaving my com-
rades behind. Am having smooth passage.
5.5. “Euryalus," April 7th, 1900. —Having a grand trip. About 7
a.m. we were off Port Elizabeth, noon abreast of Port Alfred, and at 6
p.m. passed East London. Put in the day reading a book called “The
Birthright." Am in sight of land all the way. The country looks bare
and barren —just like the Karoo, where I have been lately. After tea
had a bit of a sing-song around the piano that is on the upper deck.
Beira and “Atlantian,” April 12th, 1900. —A very warm day. About
5.30 a.m. the “Euryalus" up anchored, and followed the “Palatinnia” into
the channel. She then anchored (too shallow, low tide), and we proceeded
to the harbour. After a bit of messing about we finally dropped anchor
in the cove off Beira, and alongside of the other transports, with the other
Australian Busiunen on board, including 54 Tassies. Reading and mess-
ing about the ship all day. D n sick of the monotony. Did a bit
of signalling to the “Atlantian,” and found out about the Tassie Bushmen
who are on board here. Colonel Wallack also aboard. After tea I
brought the captain’s things and my own on board the “Atlantian.” Was
very soon at home, as I knew the following amongst them : —S.M. Goucher,
Sergeant A. Boyes, Corporals F. Johnson, R. Mace, Eric Burgess, Troopers
“Kick” Butler, “Long” Harry Hood, “Chalker,” and Bob Chant, Billy
MTntyre, F. Brain, and one or two others. Never experienced such a sur-
prise in my life to meet old chums again under such peculiar circumstances
in such a “God-forsaken hole.” Put in quite a pleasant evening, yarning
about Tassie. Could see them unloading horses from off the “Atlantian.”
They put them in horse boxes, slung them over the side into punts, then
towed them to the beach.
Beira, Good Friday, April 13th, 1900. —Up at 5.30. After breakfast
was helping to put the horses in the boxes, ready for putting over the
side into punts, all the morning. In afternoon stripped and helped to
clean out the stables by hosing it. All the Tassie horses (56) were put
ashore this morning. Part of No. 1 troop went ashore with them, as a
picquet. From the flat-bottomed punts the horses walked down a gang-
way into the water, and so ashore.


Beira, April 14th, 1900. —At 4.30 we entrained for Bamboo Creek, 6i
miles up. We eventually got away at 5 p.m. Had bully beef and biscuits
about 5 p.m. We passed through very thickly timbered country. Some-
where about 10 o’clock we settled down for a sleep. I did very well. We
are travelling in temporarily covered trucks on a 2ft. gauge, just like a
train. S.M. Goucher took a party on ahead to the Bosi camp at Maran-
dellas two days ago. They consisted of F. Brain, Dyer, Douglas, Tolman,
Tolmier, Smith, Coleman, and Dowling.
Bamboo Creek, April 18th, 1900. —Awoke at 2 a.m., and found we had
arrived at Bamboo Creek, having taken nine hours to do 61 miles. Marched
to where our other boys were, then we turned in, having straw to lie
on and our blanket over us, but in the open. After tea, Lette, Butler,
self, and a few others went for a wash in the creek. We entrain on a
wide gauge railway for some place beyond Umtali, on the border, within
the next few days.
Bamboo Creek, April 19th, 1900. —Very warm to what we have been
accustomed in Tasmania. After tea Butler, Johnson, and a few others
went round the township for a stroll, having got leave. We have only
two tents for all the Tassies, and these are used to stow the arms in and
for the sergeants; the rest of us have a crib made of green boughs, to
keep the sun off. The S.A. and W.A. Bushmen arrived here this morning.
We get along splendidly with our newly appointed lieutenant, a real
“battler” for our rights, so have two good officers in that respect —and,
by Jove, we need it. Did some washing, etc. In afternoon took two
horses with the rest to the creek for water and exercise. Kick Butler
and I took a stroll beyond the camp boundaries. He was appointed Lieu-
tenant Adams’s orderly, so we do not need an order to leave the camp,
as “bushmen” have the privilege. “A” squadron, N.S.W., left for Umtali
this evening. We shifted our diggings to opposite side of camp. Actually
slept in a bed this evening with Kick.
Bamboo Creek, April 25th, 1900. —In afternoon helped to clear our
camp up, then secured some niggers and cut some long grass to go in the
captain’s “humpy” and our own. Lieutenant Lowther went on to Maran-
dellas this morning, along with some Canadians. This evening’s train
brought a mixed lot of R.A.M.C., A.S.C., R.E., and Kaffirs for driving
the transport waggons, etc. Expect coming this way, shall not be able
to receive any letters. The last few days have been going about very
disreputable, having “punctured” the seat of my trousers! [You will be
lucky if you have any trousers left before you finish. Many a boy had to
cut the bottom off to patch the top.]
Bamboo Creek, April 26th, 1900. —After breakfast Farrier-Sergeant
Tom Smith re-allotted the horses. I had a fine bay pony with dark points
given me, and numbered 18. Several had theirs taken from them, which
naturally caused a bit of grumbling. We then took horses out for exercise,
so I took mine into the creek, and gave him a good washing; then had
a swim myself. This afternoon there were rows amongst the Kaffirs that
arrived from Beira yesterday, which necessitated one being tied up to the


fence. He was drunk. Billy MTntyre and “Curly” Barwick very unwell
to-day; sore throat and strain respectively. Lieutenant Adams gave me
a pair of pants last night, so this morning I cut about a foot off the legs,
and had a decent pair once more. Tore the old ones up to clean my horse,
rifle, etc.
Bamboo Creek, April 27th, 1900. —In the evening there was a general
sing song, at which some Tassies sang. I sang “Sons of the Sea.” Trooper
Dowling's horse died to-day when down exercising. First death of a Tassie
horse since leaving Hobart.
Bamboo Creek and Train, May Ist, 1900. —Before breakfast got our
things together, as we are off to-day for Umtali. Had an early dinner, and
then got on board the train. The balance of our horses were trucked
before dinner. We had a very monotonous and slow ride, there being one
officer, 18 non-coms., and men. The rest had gone on. The train consisted
of engine and tender, one horse truck, one truck we and 20 N.S.W. men
were in, and a loaded truck of goods; but the engine could not even pull
that small load up the steep hills, but repeatedly had to stop and get more
steam half-way up an incline. Could almost walk faster. About 15 miles
out had to stop and drag out of the truck Boyes’ dead horse, and a few
miles further had to do the same to George Towers’. They both had the
African horse disease, and got down and were trampled on and suffocated.
After these performances we had to take turn about staying on the truck
with them to try and pacify them. We left Corporal George Towers behind
with bronchitis. Very cramped up in our truck, as we had supplies,
ammunition, etc., with us, so had difficulty in getting any room for sleep.
The country we passed through is very thickly timbered, with very long
grass; think it would be very difficult to walk through. The places we
pass are as follows: —Silver Hills, Inchape, Amatongas, Dongola, and
Mondegas. The latter place we arrived at about 1 a.m. Are only 83 miles
from Bamboo Creek, and 144 from Beira; good travelling, 83 miles in 12
hours! We are getting along by degrees to the front.
Mondegas and Train, May 2nd, 1900. —A beautiful cool day, much
cooler than Bamboo Creek. Upon arrival here at about 1 this morning
we watered the horses and turned in wherever we could, some staying in
the truck, some on the ground, others in the railway station, but I got
into a comfortable railway carriage, and slept on the floor. Was roused
about 2.30 a.m. for horse picquet in the horse truck for an hour. On
turning out a little after 6 we untrucked our horses, fed and watered them,
then walked them round for exercise for an hour or two.
Umtali and Hospital, May sth, 1900. —Awoke very unwell. Ate almost
nothing for breakfast. Afterwards laid down in our tent, and there until
about 5.15 p.m., then was carried on a stretcher to the Umtali Hospital.
Upon arrival there I sponged myself all over, then got into bed. Many a
long day since lying between sheets. Temperature after turning in 102
degrees. Had some powders given me, quinine, pills also. Felt very bad
indeed all day.


Hospital, May 6th, 1900. —Spent very restless night, and felt no better
to-day. Temperature, 8 a.m., 101 ; noon, 102; 4 p.m., 104; 8 p.m., 104;
going up every time. No appetite for anything. Some of the boys came
to see me this afternoon. Very kind indeed.
Hospital, May 7th, 1900. —I spent a very restless night. No better
to-day, if anything, worse. I just lay half asleep and half awake all day,
and scarcely eating anything. One of the nurses sponged me all over, about
4.30, with cold water, to try and bring the fever down, as have been too
high—los during the day. Kick Butler and Eric Burgess been up to see
me this afternoon. Stanworth and Towers left here this afternoon : both
have fever. Was really ill; didn't care for anybody or anything.
Hospital, May 861,1900. —Much better this morning, as temperature
was 99; midday, 99; at 4 and 8, 101. Had a little better sleep last night,
but perspired a great deal, which did a world of good. Some of the boys
up to see us sick ones in the hospital. Very kind of them to pay us daily
visits, as the camp is over a mile and half from here.
Hospital, May 9th, 1900. —Same as yesterday; morning, 99; afternoon,
101. Do not seem to go down yet. Captain Riggall came to see me this
afternoon.
Umtali and Train, May 14th, 1900. —About 10.30 we four Tassies
(Johnson, Lee, Hamilton, and self) fell in and helped the Victorians down
to the station with 90 horses, to be entrained for Marandellas. Afterwards
we had dinner on the usual bully beef and biscuit and tea with the 90
Victorians that go on. Then we got in our carriage, with four or five West
Australians, who also have had fever, and the train eventually left about
3.30 for Marandellas. We sick ones were very comfortable in a first class
compartment. About 5.30 we were waiting at a crossing for a passing train,
and seized the opportunity to have tea. Got hot water for the tea out of
the engine. Put down the trucks about 8 p.m., and turned in pretty tired.
I wrote a few lines to Corporal R. P. Smith, Second Tassies, at Victoria
West Road, asking him to forward on to me any letters. Posted a
Rhodesian “Advertiser” to father to-day.
Train and Marandellas, May 15th, 1900. —Awoke about 5.30 and found
we had arrved at Marandellas, 125 miles from Umtali, and 347 from
Beira. Then helped the Victorians unload some of their “dunnage.” After
that Hamilton and I went across to the hotel and purchased a cup of hot
coffee; very refreshing. Then fell in and marched about ij/2 miles to camp.
Upon arrival we found that the Tassies had left yesterday for Bulawayo.
Biscuit and bully beef from the S.A.’s for breakfast. After that we put
up a tent, then collected the rubbish our mates had left behind them. Then
we took a walk down to the creek, and had a refreshing wash. After that
we took a walk round the town, and found Tom Smith and “Curly”
Barwick. They both have been promoted to Staff-Farrier Sergeant-Major
and Staff-Farrier-Sergeant respectively. We go on to Bulawayo to-morrow
with the S.A.’s.
Marandellas and March to Bulawayo, May 16th, 1900. —All the after-
noon getting our few things together, then helping the S.A.’s load the


waggons. About 5 p.m. we left for Bulawayo on foot, behind the transport
waggons. A little distance along the road we got on the transport waggons
and rode. About five miles along a tyre came off one of the waggons, and
we had to halt for the night. We then lit a fire and had some tea. Camped
alongside a running stream, but crossed the “spruit" first. Turned in
alongside of the S.A.’s.
March to Bulawayo, May 20th, 1900. —Sunday.—Again a beautiful day.
Unspanned” about 2 a.m., halting at daylight, the mounted men following
us at about 7 a.m. Had difficulty in getting firewood, but plenty of drinking
water, as we are just across a spruit. Fell in after breakfast for usual
arms’ inspection, then each man paraded with pannikin, and had “mooshler”
given him. Then had a doze under our waggon —lalla larper panzey. In
afternoon helped load the commissariat waggons. Trekked about 5 p.m.,
halting about 8.45 for “scoff." The mounted men did some field
manoeuvres. They do not leave till daylight, as no water this side of
Charter. Able to sleep better on the waggon this evening. Camped to-day
on level veldt; no Kopjes anywhere in sight. Some Rhodesian Volunteers
passed us this morning. They have been under Colonel Plumer, and are
returning home to Salisbury broken down in health.
March to Bulawayo, May 21st, 1900. —Left our temporary camp about
2.30 a.m., arriving at Charter at 5 a.m. Slept better last night since leaving
Marandellas; road being better. As usual helped getting water and fire-
wood during the day. F. J. and I went back and had a look at Charter.
Only a “one-horse show.” We trekked at 5 p.m., but only got a mile or
so along the road when met some heavy road, so had to get off our
heavy waggon on to a lighter one. Parts of the way we had to walk,
“incobics” knocked up. Got to our camp about 9 a.m.; had “scoff." We
left four heavy waggons behind, and they caught us while at supper.
Charter is on the junction of the road from Marandellas and Salisbury to
Bulawayo, and is a small place, consisting of a “pub.,” store, and B.S.A.
Police huts, P. 0., and telegraph in a mud hut, and run by a B.S.A. police-
man.
March to Bulawayo, May 22nd, 1900. —drekked at 3-3° a.m., and only
went a few miles when we halted for the day. Johnson and I were
roused from our slumbers on the ground, so tried to make ourselves com-
fortable on a fresh waggon, but impossible. As usual did our share of
getting firewood, then had a sleep under a tree till dinner time. In
afternoon helped load waggons again. We had our tea before leaving as
an experiment, but found it unworkable. Trekked about cpiarter to 5,
halting for the usual few hours about 8 p.m. I then made some coffee
for F. J. and self, then had a yarn to one of the Zulu drivers. Burnt my
right hand very badly to-day, but one of the Zulus cured it for me with
salt and water. Had my hair cut with horse clippers, so naturally very
close.
March to Bulawayo, May 26th. 1900.—Usual trek about 2 a.m., then
halted about 5 on the right bank of the Sebakwee River. Did usual carrying


of wood and water during the day. After breakfast I lay down under a
shady tree, and read. After dinner helping to reload waggons again. F. J.
and I shifted on to another waggon, as the one we were on was too heavy.
Mounted men came up at about n a.m.. Where we halted all day is alive
with ants; very uncomfortable. There is also a hotel and stores. Sergeant
Rundle inspected our arms this afternoon.
March to Bulawayo, May 27th, 1900. —Sharp shower about 5 a.m., but
turned out a beautiful day. Inspanned usual time, halting at 6.30 a.m. We
did just on 20 miles during the night. We halted in a shady spot; plenty
of wood, trees plentiful. Got a little wet just before daylight, so dried
our blankets, etc., in the sun. After breakfast had a good sleep till dinner
time. Went down to the spruit and had a very good wash all over; stripped
off. Trekked 4.30 p.m., but F. J., Peter Mann (a S.A.), Hamilton, and I
walked with our rifles, but saw nothing to shoot. Several Mashona boys
knocking about our camp to-day selling “satana” (monkey) nuts, Kaffir
beer (to drivers only), and sweet spuds. About half a dozen officers rode
past us to-day, part of Sir F. Carrington’s staff. The mounted men
caught us about 12.30 p.m. This evening we had a bit of fun with the
drivers over the boundary line of Mashonaland and Matabeleland. Some
said the Sebakwee River divides the two, and others the Gwelo, and so
they argued.
March to Bulawayo, May 28, 1900. —Trekked and halted at the usual
time. We five Tassies walked half way, and then same number of S.A.’s
walked the rest. We hace to take it in turns, as the cattle are knocked up.
Several of us went to see the grave of O.M.S. J. N. Walton, died May 22,
1900.
March to Bulawayo, May 31, 1900. —Outspanned about 5 a.m., within
a mile of Gwelo. We had to walk the second lap, but not being called,
we slept on. Did not object at all. Being mess orderly, did not go for
water and wood, both of which were a good distance. In afternoon F. J.,
Hamilton, and I got permission from Captain Hubbe to go into Gwelo and
see Cowen at the hospital, who was left there when our Tassies passed
through five days ago. We stayed until about 5 p.m., then picked the
waggons up as they passed through. Posted letters written this morning.
Whilst at the hospital I wrote a few lines to Captain Riggall, telling him
of our whereabouts. Wilkinson and three S.A.’s were taken to the hospital
with fever, and left. Five N.S.W.’s, who were there with fever, came on
with us. Just before we halted our waggon gave a “beautiful bump,” and
almost pitched Frank J. and me out, so we walked till we outspanned. Gwelo
is the largest town we have passed on this march, and looks quite English.
There seemed to be “malinga canteens.” A good few bikes were knocking
about. We heard here that Mafeking was relieved on May 16th, jointly
by Colonel Plumer and Colonel Mahon, from the north and south respec-
tively. How gallantly has Baden-Powell defended himself since October
12 against overwhelming odds, and then come off best! Two hundred and
sixteen days he was besieged. True British pluck. We had fresh meat —
five sheep—issued to-day.


March to Bulawayo, June i, 1900. —Trekked about 2.30 a.m. Did
not walk this lap. About 200 yards to go for water, but good distance for
wood. The latter will be very scarce to Bulawayo now. After breakfast
I lay under waggon reading. Inspanned at 4 p.m.. Did over two hours’
walking. Passed across a very large plain. Could see for miles just grass,
with a tree here and there. After getting aboard the waggon, ours stuck
in a spruit; had to get seven spans to pull it out. Road very heavy.
Halted for tea 8 p.m. Had fresh meat for breakfast and dinner, a luxury
after bully beef for the last two months.
March to Bulawayo, June 2nd, 1900. —Outspanned about 6 a.m. Our
team halted about half a mile behind the others across the spruit. Reading
and writing in afternoon. Are going for a long trek. Mounted men
caught up about 10.30 a.m. There was a change made this morning in
drivers. Passed across the Shagani River this morning.
Arrival at Bulawayo, June 7th, 1900. —Helped unload the waggons and
got our “dunnage” put in the humpy, where we put the night in. The
mounted men arrived in barracks about an hour after us. About 4 p.m.
we got leave, and went down to the Tassies’ camp, and had tea with them.
Sergeant-Major Goucher gave us four £l, so went into town. Came home
with Dick Lee, and had a bit of fun over pulling down a Dutch flag. He
strongly objected. We also called in at a baker’s shop and commandeered
some cakes. Got “bushed” coming home. [That sounds bad!] Arrived
in barracks about 11 p.m. Bulawayo is very much like Australian towns.
The “humpies” we are in are made of mud, with iron roofs and earth
floors; very comfortable. We are still with the S.A.’s.
Bulawayo Barracks, June Bth, 1900. —A cloudy day; rain threatening;
flies troublesome. After breakfast two waggons came into barracks with
the “dunnage” belonging to our comrades, so we helped unload them. They
eventually marched into here about noon, having left their previous camp.
They are quartered in the row of humpies alongside the S.A.’s. After
dinner fell in and did fatigue duty up at our horse lines. Were putting
posts to fasten the horse lines on to. Dick Lee and I had a front stall
ticket given us for a concert at the Empire Theatre, so we went. Eric
Burgess sang twice, and was encored. Plad to leave about 11 p.m., so
walked home with Bob Lawson and Kick Butler. We four were transferred
back from the S.A.’s to our own comrades this afternoon. Glad to be
back again, although we got along splendidly with the S.A.’s whilst on the
22 days’ march from Marandellas here.
Barracks, Bulawayo, June 9th, 1900. —A wet morning, and cold after-
noon, just like Tasmanian winter weather. Was mess orderly for No. 4
mess. Went over to the officers’ quarters and saw the captain re my
carrying on as his orderly. Bob Lawson has acted since I had the fever
at Umtali.
Barracks, Bulawayo, June 10th, 1900. —Fell in at 6.15 for stables, and
at 8.30. Then at 10 took horses out, and was grazing guard until 3 p.m.,
when horses were brought back.


Barracks, June 14, 1900. — Leaving to-morrow for Tuli, 135 miles
distant, and within 25 of Rhodes’ Drift, which leads from Rhodesia into the
north of Transvaal, and on to Pietersberg. All the Australian Bushmen
have now arrived, and we are formed into the hirst Australian Brigade
of three regiments, Rhodesian Field Force, made up as follows: 5 00
N.S.W. First, 55 Tas., 100 S.A., 300 Queenslanders Second, 250 \ ic.,
125 W.A. Third; total, 1330. The Canadian Artillery and 100 Queens-
landers were at the relief of Mafeking. The former are at Tuli, and the
latter returned here to join us; 200 N.S.W. are at Tuli, and 200 down this
side of Mafeking. Major Tunbridge, 0.C., Second Regiment; and Colonel
Carew, D.5.0., 0.C., First Brigade, R.F.F.
Bulawayo Barracks, June 15th, 1900.—A1l the morning getting our
things together, also part of afternoon. Fell in about 3 until 4 p.m., then
dismissed, and told we were not going to Tuli to-day, so had to unload
the waggons again. H. H. and I went into town and had a good dinner
at the Charter Hotel. Corporal Rollie Mace appointed our second
lieutenant, Corporal Johnson appointed sergeant, Lance-Corporals Rockett
and Stanworth made corporals, and Troopers Harrison, Riley, and Coleman
lance-corporals. All No. 1 troops are mounted, and we in No. 2 are on
foot. A great deal of dissatisfaction caused by this. Had a pay to-day
of £1 14s.
Bulawayo Barracks, June 16th, 1900. —Was mess orderly to-day, so
did no other duties during the day. After dinner we had to pack up our
dunnage, but after having clewed everything down were told quietlv that we
were not going to Tuli; the second messing about. Fell in for Agricul-
tural Hall guard (stores, ammunition, etc.), at 6.15, along with Corporal
Sodan (Queensland). Was first relief, so went on at 7 until 9 p.m. Had
a game of football this afternoon.
Bulawayo Barracks, June 17th, 1900. —On sentry go, 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.
Sat round very nice fire. Also on again from 7 to 9, and last go 1 p.m.
to 3 p.m. Had our tucker sent down to us from barracks. Relieved at
7 p.m. Mail arrived for us to-day, but nothing for me. Very much dis-
appointed at not getting any letters.
Bulawayo Barracks, June 20th, 1900. —Hamilton and I got leave so went
into town to see Corporal J. B. Stanworth (Tas.) box Duckett (N.S.W.)
the best of ten rounds, for the winner to get 75 per cent., and loser 25
per cent, gate money. On the seventh round our comrade won, the other
having given in. A splendid fight, indeed, admitted to have been the best
ever seen in Bulawayo. Back in barracks about midnight. Have a very
bad cough to-day; came on me yesterday. The balance of the 300 Queens-
land Bushmen went away to Mafeking, and left us about 20 sick horses.
At the boxing match I was usher to the £1 is. seats; rather a good thing.
Bulawayo Barracks, June 21st, 1900. —On the sick list with bad cold
and cough to-day. Paraded with sick at 8.30 on “light duty.” Had a sleep
during the morning. Started a letter to father before tea; finished it after
tea. Cough very troublesome during the day. Promotions during the last


few days:—Corporal Mace, to lieutenant; Sergeant-Major Goucher, to
warrant officer, regimental sergeant-major; Sergeant Boyes, to sergeant-
major; Corporal Johnson, to sergeant; Lance-Corporal Rockett, to
corporal; Lance-Corporal Stanworth, also to corporal; Troopers Harrison,
Coleman, and Riley, to lance-corporals.
Bulawayo Barracks, June 22nd, 1900. —Mess orderly, so did no other
duty during the day. After tea went into Bulawayo. Bought a book of
views of Bulawayo (2s. 6d.) and surroundings, and three Mafeking siege
photos. Had them wrapped up and posted to father; it is his birthday on
July 4th. [Good lad.] After that went to the Empire Theatre to a
smoke social given in honour of us and Imperial Yeomanry. Back into
barracks at midnight. The balance of N.S.W. men left for Mafeking
to-day.
Bulawayo Barracks, June 24th, 1900. —A real winter’s day. Took
horses out for water at 10, and left them to graze under the charge of the
picquets. Fatigue at 11, stacking hay. After tea I wrote to Captain
Tinning. First post went at 8.45. Tattoo at 9.15- Lights out at 9.30.
This morning Ted Jacson and I had a row. He got me by the scruff of the
neck, when I swung round and hit him twice in the jaw, then scruffed him.
Stanworth and others then stopped us. Glad to say Ted and I were the
best of friends again very shortly after. Both lost our tempers. [You
should have given the show at the Empire Theatre. Poor Jacson’s name
will be found in “The Last Roll Call.”]
Mafeking, June 26th, 1900. —Telegraph lines down, houses ruined, and
other evidences of there having been some fierce encounters. Arrived
here about 10 a.m., having taken hours doing the 490 miles. Upon
arrival we loaded our “bits of things” on to a waggon, and pitched our
tents and horse lines about half a mile from the station, and west of the
town. Was tent orderly. Llave long way to go for water. Very busy
till night putting things straight. We are camped along with the Queens-
landers, some N.S.W., S.A., and Vic. Have six tents—(l) sergeant, (2)
Corporal Kemsley, (3) Lance-Corporal Riley, (4) Corporal Stanworth, (5)
farriers, (6) officers. In our tent we have Corporal Stanworth (in charge),
self, Lance-Corporal Harrison, Troopers Sweeney, Midgley, Cox, Pieter-
son, R. Chant, W. Chant, and Jacson. Had a look round at some of the
bomb-proof shelters and pits dug in the ground. Everywhere can be seen
these forts across the veldt around Mafeking. The town has indications
of the rough usage it received at the hands of Cronje and Snyman, several
buildings having large holes in their roofs and walls. The country is
level veldt as far as the eye can see all round. A large running creek
(Molopo River) is to the westward of the town, and it was in these quarters
that most of the fighting was done; also, the relief column entered Mafeking,
under Colonel Plumer, on May 16th, at 3 a.m. This column consisted of
Rhodesian Volunteers, B.S.A. Police, four guns, Canadian Artillery, and
100 Queenslanders, belonging to our Australian Brigade of Bushmen.
Splendid country to defend, as open veldt. It seems wonderful that 8.P.,
with just a handful of men (about 800) kept at bay 7,000 for 217 days. We


left behind ns at Bulawayo Charlie Mitchell, who is clerk with the Staff
Officer, Lance-Corporal Sims, who is going under an operation, as he is
trying for a lieutenancy in the British Army; and Corporal Towers,
Troopers Hood, E. Burgess, MTnnes, Gerrand, Wilkinson, and Cowen,
to look after 20 odd sick Queensland horses. On the trip down Heathcote
missed the train somewhere up the line. We do not know how he managed
it, but expect him down to-morrow, with the next lot of troops from
Bulawayo.
Mafeking, June 27th, 1900. —Before breakfast Jacson, Stanworth, and
I went across to the B.S.A. Police quarters, to have a wash. All Aus-
tralians in camp (250) fell in at 10 a.m., and marched down to the Baralong
staadt.
Mafeking, June 29, 1900. —Fell in at 11, and marched to the river for
a wash, which I sorely needed. Upon return everything was astir, as we
shift camp two miles across the veldt, so up to about 8 p.m. time was put
in shifting, loading waggons, unloading again, pitching tents, then making
them snug. Then we had our tea. Sickness has broken out among the
Australians, and also in town. Heard such “mulgers” as bubonic plague,
measles, and typhoid fever, that am not certain what it was. Must be
something bad to rouse us out at the time they did. Posted Mafeking
papers to father.
Mafeking, June 30, 1900. —A very windy, cold day. Fell in at 6.30 a.m.
with two from each corps as a quartermaster’s fatigue party. We were
told off to dig a trench. Finished our trench (Cox and I) about 10.30.
Had rough, stony ground to go through. After that we erected a guard
tent down at the well. Did nothing all the afternoon, but were in readiness
to fall in when wanted, so wrote letters.
Mafeking, July Ist, 1900. —A cloudy, chilly day, with cold, cutting
wind. Fell in mounted at 6.30 a.m. for drill. Rode across to Game Tree
Hill, and had a good look at the Boer trenches. A severe fight took place
there on December 26th. The British attacked, but were repulsed, with
over 20 killed. Fell in at 9 a.m. with the quarter guard, Sergeant Johnson
•in charge, Corporal Stanworth, with nine other Tassies.
Mafeking, July 2nd, 1900.—Sentry go, 3to 5 a.m.; pretty cold. Our
guard was relieved at 9 a.m. Then Stanworth and I went down to the
well and had a good wash. No duty till afternoon. Heathcote and I fell
in at 2.30 for fatigue. We had to pull picquet line posts up from the
old camp and carry them across to the railway station.
Mafeking, July 3rd, 1900.—A beautiful day. At 6.15 walked horses
about for exercise, and on return groomed until breakfast. While out
this morning had a good look at some British trenches to the west.
Mafeking and March, July 4, 1900.—Got properly away from Mafeking
by 4.30. No. 1 troop is advance guard, and No. 2 rear guard. Each guard
has two patrols out 300 to 600 yards at right angles to the first and last
waggon respectively each side. W. H. Chant and I were in the left and
rear patrol. Duty: Examine every corner and keep a sharp look-out.


Halted for “scoff" at 8 p.m. Stanworth and I slept together on the
ground. We left behind at Mafeking Sergeant-Major Goucher and Micky
Phelan, his batman.
March to Rustenbnrg, July sth, 1900. —Very cold last night, but a
beautiful day, and dull again in the evening. Roused about 3 a.m., and
trekked at 4. Chant and I patrol on rear left again. Outspanned about
8.30 at Beerman’s Drift, on the borders of the Transvaal, and as I was
mess orderly, was busy at that job all day. I had a good sleep after
dinner. Trekked at 4 p.m. Four others patrolled for our rear guard this
evening. Plaited about 8 p.m. We have to keep a sharp look-out, as reports
have reached us that some Boers are between here and Rustenbnrg. Guard
is mounted every night, consisting of a non-com. and nine troopers. After
scoff, “Stanny” and I slept together, this time under a waggon; too much
frost and dew out in the open. We outspanned all day just across Bier-
man's Drift, and just close to John Boieters’ farm. This Boer was a month
round Mafeking, went down to Modder River with his uncle (General Piet
Cronje), and was afterwards sent to Natal, along with 400 other Boers. He
fought against us at Spion Kop, Colenso, and Tugela River.
March to Rustenbnrg, July 6th, 1900. —Trekked at 4 a.m.; halted about
8, and passed through the Dutch town of Ottoshoop, and half a mile
further on we crossed the Malmani River, and a mile from that we out-
spanned about 11 a.m. We had a lot of time wasted at that Drift; very
steep and deep. After Mafeking was relieved 4,000 Boers camped here,
the day after, retreating before Baden-Powell.
March to Rustenbnrg, July 7th, 1900. —We had a sleep until about 2,
and then dinner. Trekked out at 4.30 p.m. About 9 we passed Commandant
Botha’s house. The S.A.’s and some Queenslanders caught us up just
before reaching there. We outspanned about 10 p.m., camping just outside
of Zeerust. The country we passed through is splendid, we having left the
open, endless veldt that surrounds Mafeking, are now in hilly,
picturesque country, with Dutch farms all along the road, cultivated
paddocks, and well irrigated; country exactly like Tasmania. Around
Botha’s farm it does one good to see. The Tassies are the advance guard
now, and the S.A.’s and Q.’s the rear. We have 28 waggons on our convoy
now, having picked three more up at Ottoshoop. Last night’s extra duties
knocked us up a little. Frank Brain came in for a bit of “chaff,” but takes
it good-naturedly like a man.
March to Rustenbnrg, July Bth, 1900 —Did not trek out at 3 this
morning. Reveille went about 6.30 a.m. After breakfast groomed horses
and took to water. Whilst down at the spruit watering, Stanworth and I
commandeered a duck each. We had a great chase after them. Groomed
again and saddled up. Trekked out about 5 p.m. We camped all day just
across the Malmani River, and half a mile from Zeerust, and it took a
considerable time to cross, so it was fully two hours after before our rear
guard passed through Zeerust. Had several drifts to cross, including the
Klein-Marico River, before we outspanned about 10 p.m. We only did
two miles, but passed through terribly rough roads in the Klein-Marico


Drift. Some of us commandeered over 20 fowls, two pigs, and lemons
where we outspanned. Had a little “scoff,” then “Stanny and 1 turned in
under waggon. Passing through Zeerust we could see into the windows
from our horses, and it put the thought of home into our minds to see
the warm, comfortable tea tables, and us doing a perish out in the cold,
and “scoff,” such as it is, later on. The S.A. and Q. went on ahead on
their own” this evening, and camped to the north-west of the town.
March to Rustenburg, July nth, 1900. —Had grand dinner of stewed
ducks and fowls, as result of commandeering. Jacson, Stanworth, and I
bought a half-grown pig for ss. [Chalk it up. First record of a soldier
buying anything that was loose!]
March to Rustenburg, July 12th, 1900. —Irekked out about 2 a.m.,
halting at 8. On guard till n, then had a short sleep. Inspanned about
2 p.m., crossed the Elands River, and outspanned in the camp a mile beyond
at 5. Cannot go any further on, as the Boers are in possession of the
country leading into Rustenburg. After tea Corporal Stanworth had
charge of 20 Tassies, self one of them, to sleep behind stone-walled fort all
night, in case of alarm, which is expected any day or night, as the Boers
threaten to attack this fort. The camp is on high, rising ground, to the
east of the drift across the Elands River, and has good commanding
position of the surrounding country. Would take an overwhelming force
to “houst” out. There are supposed to be about 250 all told, made up with
O.’s, N.S.W., S. Rhodesian Volunteers, Rhodesian Regiment, B.S.A. Police,
Tassies, and 20 S.A.’s, who arrived three hours after us with the convoy
of 14 waggons. There is a y\h. screw gun and a Maxim, in charge of the
B.S.A. Police. Countersign for this evening, “Survey.”
Elands River, July 13th, 1900. —About 5 a.m. we were all roused up,
and I was told off as a sentry to keep a look-out until daylight. Came
off duty about 6.30. After breakfast was one of a fatigue party told off
to help build stone breastworks. In afternoon was on Q.M.S. fatigue
unloading stores. All hands fell in at 5 p.m., to hear orders by Major-
General Baden-Powell. Countersign, “Maidstone.” This evening had to
sleep under stone wall breastworks again. Before turning in Jacson and
I had a good yarn to one of the B.S.A. Police, who was in Mafeking during
the siege. A patrol of 40 N.S.W.’s went out this morning, under Captain
Thomas, and had a sharp skirmish with 50 or 60 of the enemy, about 15
miles to the south-east. Captain Thomas’ horse was shot from under him,
Sergeant Raymond shot in the shoulder, Lieutenant Zouch shot through
the pants, and one captured and disarmed, then let go. The latter was with
two waggons on his own, his horse having knocked up. The party escorted
the waggons into camp. In conversation with Nicholls, of the 8.5.A.P., he
gave me an instance of the kind of man Colonel Hore (second in command
during the siege) was, who is in command here with us now. During the
siege he was in a bomb-proof shelter while a sergeant watched through a
telescope the way Big Ben was pointed. “Sergeant-Major, which way is
that big gun pointed?” “On the women’s laager, sir.” “Oh, thank God.”
A few minutes later he would ask again. “This way now, sir.” “Oh, my

THE BUSHMEN’S CONTINGENT IN BARRACKS.


God,’ and he would dart down below into his kennel, and would not show
himself for hours after. [I do not believe this yarn a bit.] Truly a great
contrast between gallant 8.-P. and his next in command. Dyer taken to
hospital here with rheumatism; very bad indeed.
Elands River, July 15th, 1900. —Hamilton and Dyer in hospital, both
very ill. Upon returning everything was astir, as we return to Zeerust this
afternoon, in charge of 20 empty waggons. About 3 p.m. saddled up and
trekked. Ihe 20 S.A.’s go with us. Our No. 1 troop act as advance
guard. Passed a large convoy on its way to Elands River, in charge of
some Vies., Q., S.A.V., and R. Reg. There were 40 cattle waggons, three
mules, and two light carts. We gave them four boxes ammunition, by
order. Outspanned about 8.45, about eight miles out. We travel much
faster with empties. Upon leaving the Elands River camp we commandeered
four cases jam, each dozen pound tins, three bags sugar, and a case choco-
late (501b.), case of biscuits, and a 3-gallon keg of rum. The latter was one
of the most daring jobs ever heard of, for we swopped a Government horse
for the rum. In fact, the other packages were taken off the waggons we
escorted from Mafeking in broad daylight, and within sight of officers and
the transport riders. All we boys are disappointed at turning back when
almost in touch with the enemy, as two or three commandoes are close
to this camp. However, we may get a chance yet. We are under Major-
General R. S. S. Baden-Powell's command.
March to Zeerust, July 18th, 1900. —Trekked out from Coutzee’s farm
at 4 a.m., and outspanned at Roi Spruit about 10 a.m. We passed Vaal
Kop at 6.30. Had a good breakfast and dinner, all in one, about 11 a.m.
After that to stables, watered horses, and turned them out to graze. Had
a sleep, and tea about 5 p.m. After tea, had two hours' sing song; one of
the Dutch transport riders present, and sang for us; also some of the
S.A. s. We lay at anchor till the morning, then go on to Zeerust, six miles
away. Lit a good fire, and turned in early, all our No. 3 mess around it.
The cask of commandeered rum seems to be playing a natural part, several
being half seas over ’ all day, also yesterday. Those that were tight should
have known better.
Zeerust, July 20th, 1900. —We four picquet, the four patrols (that go
out every morning at 6), and two others had to stand to our horses ready
saddled, and be armed, in case of attack, half an hour before sunrise, to be
ready if wanted. At 6.30 picquets cleaned horse lines whilst horses led
around for exercise. Grooming at 8.30; then took horses to water, and out
to graze. Upon return was told off on fatigue to cart away dung from
horse lines. Afternoon on fatigue, building stone breastworks to south of
our camp. Went out for horses about 8 p.m., and watered them on the
way to the lines. Stanworth, Jacson, and I took charge of a bush humpy
to sleep in; much better than on the dusty ground. Jacson told off C.B.
as long as we stay at Zeerust. Three traction engines with three trucks
of “scoff” arrived this afternoon from Ottoshoop. Four W.A.’s came with
the convoy. They are temporarily attached to us half-hundred Tassies. At


our 8.30 parade orders read out, in which Farrier-Corporal Lute and
Farrier Frank Tolmie promoted first rank of farrier-sergeant and farrier-
corporal respectively.
Zeerust (Saturday), July 21st, 1900. —We had £1 each given us this
afternoon. Usual routine this morning. About 11 a.m. the alarm was
sounded, and the horses were galloped in, saddled, all hands mounted, and
fell in smartly. Then we were taken out to the north-west of the camp,
patrols sent out, and scouts. I was one of the advance; went about two
miles from camp over the top of a high kopje, but saw nothing. It appears
that some of the S.R.V.’s saw some moving objects on top of the kopjes, 01
scorea, and also heard two rifle shots. Moving objects nothing more than
chimpanzee monkeys! We really thought we were in for “fun” this time,
but again disappointed. Our camp was the scene of excitement and hurry-
ing about. The 88th Battery soon had their two 15-pounders ready. All
cattle driven in, and mule waggons harnessed up. This morning at 5.30 all
hands not on duty turned out into the trenches, fully armed, and dismissed
after daylight. Handy in case of an attack.
Zeerust, July 23rd, 1900. —The whole camp roused about 9 p.m., and
turned out to their respective trenches. These false alarms do more harm
than good; some day it will be a “cry of wolf.” The boys had a pretty
uncomfortable time last night, as there was no cover from the rain. Appears
a N.S.W. trooper fired two shots by accident.
Zeerust, July 24th, 1900. —Upon return to camp, on fatigue building up
the breastwork; at it in afternoon also. About 3.30 p.m. went out for
horses, groomed, fed, and then put rugs on. After tea “Stanny” and I
busy getting our and horses’ “scoff” ready for patrolling to-morrow. Read
out in this morning’s orders that two of the S.R.V.’s were fined £5, six
months’ hard labour, and then dismissed the Volunteer service, with
ignominy, for being drunk on parade. Punishment given by our Com-
mander, General Baden-Powell. Plainly shows what a good, strict
disciplinarian he is.
Zeerust, July 25th, 1900. —Stanny and I out on patrol. Left camp
about 6 a.m., with our horses and one day’s rations, and went out towards
Kattafyn Staadt (tribe of Bechuanas), due west, and about 15 miles from
our camp. About 8.30 we outspanned at Wright’s farm, seven miles out,
and had some “scoff.” Had a yarn to a miller named Piet Fraser, 300 yards
further on. Arrived at the Staadt about noon, then went through and off-
saddled at the B.S.A.P. camp. All the six away on patrol towards Base-
port, and only one, Barclay, there; so had lunch with him. Got back to
camp about 6.30, very dark and cloudy. Upon getting back to camp a
mail awaited us. Gerrand and MTntyre went along to Commandant
Botha’s farm, five miles towards Ottoshoop, to commandeer some sheep
and cattle. They got back with 102 sheep and 10 head of cattle.
Zeerust, July 26th, 1900. —At 6 a.m. 10 others and self went out
patrolling, under Farrier-Sergeant Lute, to north-west of camp for ijA
hours. After breakfast fell in with axes, and were all the morning felling


trees on the north-west side of Fortress Kopje, so as not to block the view
of the look-out there. Did nothing in afternoon, as it was late when we
returned. Corporal Stanworth (in charge), Douglas, Cowen, and I fell in
for Landdrost guard at 4.45. Blankets sopping wet; bush humpy no good.
Zeerust, July 28th, 1900. —A mail reached us to-day, and I got two
letters from mother, dated July nth and 16th. After tea turned in and had
a read of the papers which “Jackey” received. A commandeering party of
about 20 went out this morning.
Zeerust, July 29th, 1900. —Out on early patrol at 6 a.m. After break-
fast I fell in with other Australian Bushmen and some of the Tommies of
the R.A. for fatigue, pulling down stone walls on Fortress Kopje. These
stone walls were built about the year 1837, when Mosilikatze, a Matabele
chief, an off-shoot of the Zulus, made his final stand against the Boers, the
latter having trekked north from Cape Colony. Of course the niggers
were repulsed, and they finally cleared out north, through Khama’s country,
into Matabeleland.
Zeerust, July 30th, 1900. —On guard all day. Dismissed at 5 p.m.
hours of sentry go, 11 p.m. (last night) to 3 a.m. This was long and dreary
duty; 9to 11 aim., and 3to 5 p.m. At 6.30 were shifted up to the camp,
as it is the usual thing for this post. After tea turned in, and had a read.
Got things ready for to-morrow’s patrol along with Frank Brain.
Zeerust, July 31st, 1900. —F. B. and lon patrol. We reported our-
selves to the camp Sergeant-Major Pearce, of N.S.W., and he ordered us
to patrol along the road towards Riensburg. We had a cup of coffee
at a Dutchman’s house just after crossing the Klim Marico Drift. Halted
about 7.45, boiled our billy, and had breakfast about four miles out from
camp. We got as far as Rooi Spruit about 10 a.m., and off-saddled. Then
had a sleep. We were roused by an invalided 8.5.A.P., who helped relieve
Mafeking. Got up, boiled the billy, and had dinner; saddled up, and off
back about 3.30. Stopped two miles out, and made a drink of coffee. Camp,
5.30 p.m. Whilst out we paid a visit to the women's laager, about three
miles from Zeerust. In this camp are the women and children of the Dutch
now on commando, who up to lately had been provisioned by the British
Government; but a proclamation recently by Lord Roberts, that all women
must join their husbands, has almost broken up the camp.
Zeerust, August 2nd, 1900. —L. M. got a hiding from two non-coms,
early last night, and L. M. came back into camp and got two comrades
and brought them down, who gave them a good hiding in return. [A true
touch of soldiers’ life.] The screaming I heard was from the onlookers
while the fight was going on. About 1.15 one of the S.R.V.’s, who is
detailed for telegraph operating purposes at the Landdrost, came along,
very drunk, which necessitated my leaving my post to help him to his Kir,
which is just opposite. Altogether, the 11.30 to 1.30 sentry duty was very
interesting to me at all events. Between duty to-day had plenty of fun
with our I.Y. prisoner, Rose-Innes, who was very funny indeed.
Zeerust, August 3rd, 1900.—Usual morning duties. Then I fell in
along with several others from the various corps in camp for fatigue work,.


under Major Biddulph, R.A. We were cutting down brushwood at the
northern side of Relief Kopje, to make breastworks to stop horsemen.
Had a very refreshing sleep in afternoon. In the evening was yarning to
Snookes, a S.R.V., a lasmanian, brother to Snookes who was with me in
Signalling Corps in Hobart. General Carrington’s column moved off last
night towards Elands River. He is going to relieve the garrison there,
which is besieged by a large force of Boers. Does not seem to have
sufficient force.
Zeerust, August 4th, 1900. —Stanworth (in charge), Cowen, Lyon (S.A.),
and self on kopje patrol, and left camp at 6.30. We got over the pass down
the donga a mile the other side, and halted for breakfast about 8.30. After
breakfast we had a good sleep all the morning. Had dinner about 12.30.
Had scarcely finished when a fierce grass fire was upon us, and we just
got out of the donga in time. We then rode across to Sefton’s farm
(brother to Thos. Sefton, the Zeerust Magistrate). He very kindly invited
us in, and gave us a very refreshing cup of tea. Got home by 5.45. Had
tea, and then very busy reading letters, having received 21 by to-day’s
mail—44 to date. [Such a list of girl writers; but I won’t tell!] They
were old, but very acceptable letters. About 8 p.m. we Tassies got word
to fall in, as a mounted escort was wanted to take six waggons to Carring-
ton’s column, who is retreating before the Boers.
March to Wonderfontein, August 6th, 1900. —Heard artillery fire, then
received fusilade of bullets. MTntyre, Beveridge, and myself a right flanking
party, never got a shot. Meanwhile the rest of the boys were giving it
to them hot from behind the waggons and off a small kopje in front.
Several of the Boers were seen to fall, but our horses and cattle were
receiving terrible punishment, as also two or three of our boys. Lieutenant
Adams ordered a retirement. Could only get one waggon away; had to
abandon the others, as also seven of our number, who were Corporals
Kemsley and Rockett, Lance-Corporal Coleman, Troopers Cowen, Hood,
Darling, and Lance-Corporal Riley. Whilst the others were retiring,
four of the right flanking party stayed behind to watch where the
Boers made to, but we received such a hot fire from the unseen foe that
we had to retire. We halted behind Coutzee’s farmhouses (1 y 2 back), then
Sergeant Gardiner called out MTntyre, Gerrand, Sullivan, and myself to
go back and look for the other seven; Corporal Ricksby, of the S.A., being
sent into Zeerust with report, and the remainder retired on Vaal Kop. We
first of all rode about a mile in a north-west direction up a valley, then
took a northerly direction for half a mile. Sullivan held our horses to feed
whilst Gardiner and MTntyre together, and Gerrand and I together, had a
good look round. After about half an hour’s spying we discovered a horse-
man coming our way. We waited until he was within 600 yards, when we
were both of the opinion that he was a Boer, so we fired twice each. It’s
hard to say what our first shots did, but with my second I dropped
him. Subsequent events proved that the ball passed through the animal,
then through the calf of the rider’s leg. But, worst of all, we discovered
that it was a nigger on a donkey. We were very sorry for the mistake,


but he had no business riding about the veldt when fighting was going
on. However, I carried him to the Kaffir kraal close by, and dressed his
wound, the donkey, of course, being dead. After this Sullivan held our
horses whilst we other four sneaked along the top of the high kopje behind
Coutzee’s farm, and had a good look around, but found nothing to raise
suspicion. After chewing a little dry biscuit (first since last night), we rode
in a northerly direction for three miles, which brought us to a donga, so
we rode down this towards the scene of our late “scrap.” At a farm-
house a mile above Kleinfontein, we spied two armed Boers, but thought
it better not to fire on them, as it might have prevented us accomplishing
the object we returned for, viz., the rescue or finding the whereabouts
of our comrades. We then crossed the donga again, and made for the foot
of a tall kopje half a mile away, where G. and I dismounted and sneaked
up to a height, where we could command a good view of the flat vedlt.
We discovered horsemen galloping in open order towards where we had
our fight, and after a good deal of looking and discussion amongst our-
selves, we came to the opinion that it was the advance guard of General
Carrington’s column, who had been fighting all day a mile this side of
Wonderfontein. However, not being quite certain, we approached them
very cautiously, as we had a doubt that they might have been part of the
2,000 odd Boers he was bombarding this afternoon. We were not sorry to
find that they were a squadron of Imperial Bushmen. We then immediately
rode hard for where we had our fight, a mile and a half away, and came
to the farmhouse there, where we discovered all but Riley. We were that
pleased and overcome with joy that we very nearly embraced them, that
pleased they were safe. But, sad to say, Cowen was wounded in the elbow,
Kemsley in the calf of the leg, and Coleman shoulder and hand, but Harry
Hood and Dowling were safe, and helping medical man bandage others,
for Sir F. Carrington’s men were passing the house at the trot, in their
retreat towards Zeerust. Unfortunately Riley was taken prisoner. After
an eager yarn to the wounded three, as to their doings, etc., they were put
in the ambulance waggons, and the other two rode on a mule waggon, for
their horses were killed. We five then had a good look round the scene
of our fight. It’s a wonder how we escaped with such a small casualty list,
for at the spot the Boers took up they had us at a disadvantage. We rode
along the long column, and reached Vaal Kop, where we found the rest
of our party, and reinforcements from Zeerust. After a good, sharp ride
we reached camp about 8.15, tired and jolly hungry, as we had only a nibble
of biscuit all day, and dirty ditch-water to drink. Our O.M.S. had to
get us all fresh blankets, because all our others, with our topcoats, mess
tins, “scoff,” etc., were on the waggons that the Boers captured. Naturally
we had plenty to yarn about with those who did not participate in the fight.
Well, this was the first time we Tasmanian Bushmen were under fire, also
myself, and had we been led properly the five waggons would not have
been captured. One thing was very certain, and that was not one of our
men wavered in the slightest. [Suppose the officer had not ordered a
retirement, you might have lost the other waggon, and all been captured.


A soldier’s private criticism of his officer’s conduct must always be received
with caution, since it is easy to be wise after the event; besides, an officer
has reasons for his actions, of which his men may be ignorant.] We
had six horses (Hood’s, Cowan's, Kemsley’s, Dowling’s, and a S.A.’s)
killed, and several oxen.
Zeerust, August 7th, 1900. —Again to-day we had plenty of talk about
yesterday’s fight. From Bengali's account, Jim Riley made a bold defence
before he was caught, because he saw the whole affair.
Zeerust and Retreat on Mafeking, August Bth, 1900. —Came off picquet
at midnight, and had about two hours’ sleep, when was roused by “Jackey”
to come over to the Commissariat Stores to help ourselves to whatever we
wanted. [Which was much as usual.]
Retreat on Mafeking, August 10th, 1900. —Roused about 3.15, and
under way about 3.45 a.m. We were left advance flanking party. Halted
the east side of Mafeking about 9 a.m. All the morning was put in rigging
up horse lines. Each man sleeps behind his horse; no tents. Afternoon
also messing about. After tea I answered E.M.’s letter. We had detached
to us Vies., Queenslanders, W.A.’s, who were details with General Carring-
ton’s column, and were in the Elands River fight last Sunday, and the
Morico one on Monday.
Mafeking, August 14th, 1900. —Usual toil for the officer. About 10
a.m. all hands fell in and an urgent order read us by Sergeant-Major
Boyes, to the effect that all available men fall in at 1 p.m., with one shirt,
one pair socks, waterproof, two blankets, towel, and soap, the balance of
our kit to be left behind, in charge of some of our men left for that
purpose. Of course that put us in a bustle, until we eventually moved
off, about 2 p.m. Farrier-Sergeant Tolmie, Troopers Hamilton and
Beveridge, and Lance-Corporal Harrison, were left, and, of course, the
three wounded —Kemsley, Coleman, and Cowen —have not recovered to
come with us. In addition, Lance-Corporal Riley is in hospital unwell,
the rough night he had when he escaped from the Boers played up with
him. We are going through to relieve the garrison at Elands River at
any cost, under Sir F. Carrington. The column consists of about 1,500
men, made up with eight 15-pounders of artillery, four pom-poms, six
Maxims, two galloping Maxims, 1,000 mounted men, and 200 infantry.
We Tassies (along with us being other Australian Bushmen details) are
called now Second Squadron, First Brigade, and acted this afternoon as
advance of the main guard. We halted at Bierman’s Drift about 7 p.m.
for the night. After coffee and smoke Stanny and I turned in together
behind our horses as usual. I left my diary with Hamilton to register
and post home to Harold for me.
March to Relief of Elands River, August 15th, 1900.—Another
beautiful day. (I started to write this on the battlefield of Malmani. Our
artillery is shelling the Boer trenches. Am one of the reserves, and lying
behind shelter as I write. Hie N.Z.’s just arrived, and charging the kopje
to rescue 50 Bushmen—2o Tassies.) Up and standing to arms half an
hour before daylight. We are left rear guard for the column to-day, so


we did not get away from Bierman’s Drift (just heard one of the Tassies
remark that artillery fire now going on is better than firing ofif crackers on
Queen’s Birthday), until about 9.30. Halted for a rest about 11.30 at
Lowe’s farm. After having some “scoff” we laid down and had a much-
needed sleep. Under way again at 4.30, and reached Ottoshoop. The
general opinion in camp is that we are right for a fight to-morrow. We
camped for the night on Mafeking side of Ottoshoop.
March to Relief of Elands River, August 16th, 1900. —A very warm
day. Up an hour before daylight; had a little “scoff,” and fell in mounted
about 6.30. At daylight rifle fire could be heard to the north-west of
Ottoshoop. N.S.W. Imperial Bushmen fired upon by the enemy. All
a bustle in the camp. After a little waiting about we eventually marched
out in the direction of the pending battle of Malmani, passing Lieutenant-
Colonel Wallack en route, who waved us cheering words as we passed
him. We marched about four miles, and to the E.S.E. of the town halted,
four guns (15-pounders of the 88th) coming with us, and they quickly
went into action, and fired two or three dozen shells about 2,400 yards
to the north-west at a mob of Boers, behind cover of a small kopje. The
enemy very quickly scattered away. Very soon we received the order dis-
mount and fall in behind horses for dismounted work, but being a horse-
holder, I had to stop. Our men advanced in open order to the top of a
ridge, and were quickly firing away at the Boers 1,000 yards in front of
them. In the meantime the roar of the four 15-pounders and two pom-
poms could be heard shelling the Boers from our left. Rifle fire was now
carried on all round from the I.Y.’s, K.M.C., and Australian Bushmen;
Maxim also going, too. After our boys had been firing about three-quarters
of an hour, and the big guns also, the Boers cleared from the kopje they
were in, and about 50 Bushmen rode at the gallop and took charge of the
spot. Now commenced a continuous rifle fire from the lately occupied
kopje, and the Boers, yoo or 800 yards beyond, until 4 in the afternoon,
when a general advance was made by about 300 N.Z.’s, 150 Imperial
N.S.W., and 80 S.A.’s, under the artillery fire of two 15-pounders and two
pom-poms, when the enemy were put to full retreat, our men capturing
the positions, and holding them all day. Half an hour afterwards two 15-
pounders that had made a right flanking movement about 2 p.m., could
be heard, their distant fire pouring shrapnel into the retreating enemy, it
now having become dusk. During the day the two remaining troops
escorted two guns of artillery about half a mile to the north-west, and the
latter opened fire on a party of the enemy at a house, every shot telling,
for they were soon seen to “scoot.” We returned to our former position’
and halted in front of the ridge we were on all the morning, but the bullets
were falling round too thick, that we retired behind the ridge for shelter;
the artillery in the meantime shelled the Boers, and silenced their fire’
Whilst out in the open Sergeant Johnson’s horse was killed, and the bullet
that killed him passed through and hit Lieutenant Mace on the water bottle
strap, and fell on the ground spent. Had not Johnson’s horse been there
the lieutenant must have been hit through the heart. Whilst the mounted


Australians made the general advance and cleared out the Boers, we
remaining troops acted as reserves. It did our hearts good to see the
accurate shooting of the artillery, and the steady, determined advance of
the Australian Bushmen. We slept upon the ground we fought upon. Four
of us built stone protection, pulled some grass to lie on, then turned in.
We only had our topcoat and some horse blankets. We mounted guard,
and I did from 12.30 to 2.45 a.m. Our men took charge of the various
kopjes we captured during the day, and slept there. We suffered pretty
badly with thirst to-day, and only had a little “scoff.” There is no doubt
about it the Boers got a rough handling to-day, and we received a little
loss, but cannot find out the exact number of casualties. A notable thing
is that representatives from Old England, Canada, N.Z., N.S.W., Vic., Q,,
S.A., W.A., and last, but by no means least, little Tassie, took part. Im-
perialism if you like! This is the first time the 88th Battery of R.A. were
in action, they being the youngest battery in South Africa, only formed
three years. Their’s and the two pom-poms' fire were splendid. General
Lemmer had charge of the Boers; Brigadier-General Lord Errol of us.
One of Paget’s Horse was heard to say when our boys were charging the
kopje in the morning, “God bless the Bushmen,” with his clasped hands
above his head.
Halt at Malmani, August 17th, 1900. —We halted all day in the same
spot we took up last evening, as also did all our other troops. We put
the time in laying about under the shade of our horses. I managed to
boil my billy with grass; no timber near us. About 4.30 we moved away
as escort to the two artillery guns that were at Zeerust with us, and took
up a position a mile further along the road as rear guard to the column.
The whole column halted for the night about 300 yards in front of us. At
night could be seen the camp fires of our outposts on the kopjes surround-
ing us. Our casualties yesterday were : Killed, two officers and three men;
wounded, two officers and nine men. The enemy’s were over 70, from
what we heard, but it may be wrong; still, they suffered severely. Had
no wash all day until evening, when we took our horses to water, half a
mile away. My first wash since evening. Wasn't it refreshing, eh?
Ottoshoop, August 22nd, 1900. —Our squadron fell in at 8.30, then
about 500 mounted men and two of Biddulph’s guns marched off in a south-
east direction from Ottoshoop, when about noon our scouts were fired
upon. We Tassies and details were on the left, and were ordered into some
bushy country, where we had about three hours’ fighting. The big guns
fired four shots into some houses, and scattered the Boers. It was then
we had our go at them. We were in a tight fix towards the last, but retired
out of danger. The most sad part of the day’s fighting was the loss of
Stanny’s and my mate, Ted. Jascon. Poor chap, he was retiring for cover
when a bullet struck him behind the ear, and stopped behind his right eye,
and death must have been instantaneous. However, Stanny managed to
get him put on our ambulance waggon, and he was brought into camp.
Upon forming up after our fight we found that Bob Lawson and Douglas
were missing also; but the former turned up before we had gone two miles.


He was left in some scrub, and a Boer was coming towards him, when he
shot him dead and “scooted,” when an ambulance man gave him a mount
until he caught us up. Needless to say, we were very pleased to see him
back. Of Douglas we knew nothing; he must have been captured. We
Tassies and details did all the fighting to-day, and we accounted for at
least nine dead Boers and 17 horses, so goodness knows how many were
wounded. The N.S.W. Bushmen captured their Field Cornet, and brought
him back with us about 4.20 p.m. to here. The devils used explosive
bullets at us. One struck a tree I was behind, and went off like a pistol
shot. The talk upon return to camp was of poor “Jackey,” who was a
favourite with us all, and a d—n good soldier. Whilst behind a tree
for cover I dropped off to sleep, but an explosive bullet woke me with a
start. Brigadier-General Lord Errol complimented Captain Riggall, who
conveyed it to us on return, on the splendid work done by us to-day.
Ottoshoop, August 23rd, 1900. —After breakfast we shifted our horse
lines and waggons 100 yards across the road. Then Stanny and I went
along to the “Pill Box’s” quarters, and wrapped poor old Jacson up in a
blanket, ready for burial. At 2 p.m. we had his funeral. Stanny and I, with
Rockett and W. H. Chant, were his pall-bearers, whilst Sergeant Johnson
had charge of the (dozen) firing party. All our officers, remaining men,
and Colonel Wallack (he is here on General Carrington’s staff), followed
him to his last resting-place. We buried him in the graveyard across the
Malmani River. We had a Scotch cart to carry him in. The Rev. Captain
conducted the funeral service at the grave. May God grant that this will
be the last and only job of this sort we may have in South Africa!
Night March on Zeerust, August 24th, 1900. —One of the most
uncomfortable days have yet experienced—windy and dusty. Marching
until about 6 a.m., when we halted about three hours, and had a little
“scoff.” Under way again at 9 a.m., and eventually reached Zeerust at
2 p.m., camping to the north-west of the town, and a little way from where
we camped before. Some of Lord Methuen’s cavalry had some sniping
at the Boers around Botha’s farm as we passed. We must have travelled
between 30 and 40 miles during the night. Passing a Dutch farmhouse
we commandeered some lemons and oranges. Had a good feed about 8
p.m.; had no dinner. Turned in early, as we had no sleep last night. We
met some of the Bushmen who were besieged at Elands River, and they
performed one of the most gallant and brilliant feats of the war in holding
out for 14 days, until relieved by Lord Kitchener on August 17th. There
were only 500 men there, and they had only one muzzle-loading 7-pounder
and a Maxim ; whilst the Boers shelled them with eight big guns. The first
day 1,500 shells were fired in an acre of ground, killing most of the horses
and mules and cattle, only leaving a few of each alive. When Carrington’s
column attempted to relieve them on the sth August, they had even com-
menced to lumber up and “scoot,” when the former retired on Mafeking.
That was on the second day of the siege, and still the garrison held out
eleven days longer. The latter gave way to cheering when they saw C.’s
column in sight, but their hearts broke when they saw him turn round


and run! The casualties during the siege were 17 killed (11 whites and six
blacks), and about 50 wounded. Sergeant-Major Goucher and Mickey
Phelan were there, but escaped unhurt, only the former had an accident
with his horse, which fell on him. From all accounts Lord Kitchener had
possession of Oliphant’s Nek (miles the other side of Rustenburg), whilst
Lord Methuen was driving De Wet towards him, but the former had to
evacuate his position to relieve Elands River, so De Wet got through and
escaped. Had Carrington relieved Elands River by August sth, when he
very faintly attempted it, Lord K. would have been able to prevent De
Wet getting through Oliphant’s Nek, and between him and Methuen they
must have captured him, and his long convoy, which would have very much
hastened the end of the war; because De Wet under, the worst would be
over. The Boers cleared away from Elands River two days before
Kitchener arrived here, as they must have received word of his approach,
so the latter had practically no fighting to accomplish his purpose.
“The Australians have been so split up during the campaign, that
though their valour and efficiency were universally recognised, they had
no single large exploit, which they could call their own. But now they
can point to Elands River as proudly as the Canadians can to Paardeberg.
They were 500 in number, Rhodesians, Victorians, New South Welshmen,
and Queenslanders, the latter the larger unit. Two thousand five hundred
Boers surrounded them, and most favourable terms of surrender were
offered and scouted. Six guns were trained upon them, and during 11 days
1,800 shells fell within their lines. The river was half a mile off, and every
drop of water for man or beast had to come from there. Nearly all their
.horses and 75 of the men were killed or wounded. With extraordinary
energy and ingenuity the little band dug shelters, which are said to have
exceeded in depth and efficiency any which the Boers have devised. Neither
the repulse of Carrington nor the jamming of their only gun, nor the death
of the gallant Benett, was sufficient to dishearten them. They were sworn
to die before the white flag should wave above them. And so Fortune
yields, as Fortune will when brave men set their teeth, and Broadwood’s
troopers, filled with wonder and amazement, rode into the lines of the
reduced and emaciated but indomitable garrison. When the ballad-makers
of Australia seek for a subject, let them turn to Elands River, for there
was no finer fighting in the war. They will not grudge a place in their
record to the 130 gallant Rhodesians who shared with them the honours
and the dangers of the exploit.”—(Doyle’s ‘‘Great Boer War,” p. 445.)
Zeerust, August 25, 1900. —Put the day in yarning to those who were
besieged at Elands River, and in writing to father. Do not know where
I can post it, but probably at Mafeking. In the evening Stanny and I
took a stroll down town. It looks a complete wreck since we were here
last. Upon return to camp were yarning around the fire for an hour or
so. Fifty of our squadron, under Lieutenant Adams, mounted up on to
a kopje behind our camp, on picquet for the night. Only about ten of us
left in camp, all told. Great yarning going on to-day with those of the
Australian Bushmen who were in Elands River siege, and we Tassies and


details. Sergeant-Major Goucher and Mickey Phelan over yarning as
well.
March to Ottoshoop, August 26th, 1900. —After breakfast we nine who
remained in camp last night saddled up, and rode two miles to the top of
a pass overlooking the camp, and were there on the watch until 11 a.m.,
then returned to camp, and joined the rest of our squadron. (They were
on picquet all night.) Lord Methuen’s column underway for Mafeking
at daylight. Carrington's column formed the rear guard, and we were
right on the rear, with Biddulph’s four guns. It was noon before we left
Zeerust, and outspanned for the night about 5 p.m., a mile before reaching
Lreneral Lemmer's house, or eight miles out of Ottoshoop. After having
some ‘‘scoff," Ragged (Vic.), Burrows (N.S.W.), and I were told off to
guard a burning Dutchman’s house for the night. We were over a mile
in the rear of the column. We did turn about of two hours. I was put in
charge. Rather a risky job, as we are far away from the others. Several
rebel houses burnt to-day. The advance guard of Methuen’s column had
some sharp fighting at Botha’s farm, as they did also further on. From all
accounts they annihilated 200 Boers with our four pom-poms. They mis-
took our pom-poms for their own, and rode into the open towards them,
and when within 200 yards, our men let them have it pretty hot. What
they did not kill Brabant’s Horse finished, for they cleared and ran against
the latter 600, who left Zeerust for Pretoria yesterday afternoon. BothaT
house and several others en route were looted.
March on Ottoshoop, August 27th, 1900. —At daylight we three had
a look round the burning house we have been guarding all night. We
commandeered some odds and ends, photos, bucket of lemons, etc. Recalled
about 8 a.m., and upon returning found everything under way again, we
forming right flanking party for Biddulph’s guns. Outspanned four miles
outside Ottoshoop. After unsaddling, I had a little sleep, for we had
very little last night. About 4 p.m. the column moved off into Ottoshoop.
We Tassies were sent about two miles to the left to draw the enemies’
fire, and drew it we did, for the bullets flew about us thick. Biddulph’s
four guns soon scattered them. Some of us retired behind cover, and
let them have it with our rifles. This was the first time that have fired
a shot yet; still, have been under fire four times now. Four or five of us
had the satisfaction of “rousing” some away at 2,000 yards’ elevation. A
W.A. had his horse killed, and Bob Lawson’s was hit on the near side hip
very badly. Lucky none of us were hit, for we rode to within 300 yards
of them before they fired, from behind rocks as usual. We got into camp
at Ottoshoop about 6.30. Found Jim Riley, he having come through from
Mafeking last night; has been in hospital unwell. We also discovered that
Douglas is safe, but badly wounded. The bullet struck him in the left
shoulder. The Boers treated him very kindly, and sent into here for an
ambulance, which carried him in, and then on to Mafeking. Lord Methuen’s
column went into Mafeking to be refitted. For the last two months he has
been chasing De Wet, and should have captured him but for 8.-P.’s jealousy
and Sir F. Carrington’s cowardice.


Ottoshoop, August 28th, 1900. —Started to rain after tea, with plenty
of thunder and lightning. Wrapped up ready to post some photos, used
stamps, and cigarette cards. These I gave to Kick Butler to post in Mafe-
king. He has an Imperial commission in the First Battalion, Derbyshire
Regiment, and goes into Mafeking, and on to join them at Wynburg within
the next few days. From information received, 60 Boers killed and wounded
by our artillery last evening; also that 135 killed and wounded two days
ago by Methuen’s advance left flanking party. The used postage stamps I
bought off Dyer. He commandeered them at Botha’s house. It was
looted when we passed it on the march from Zeerust to here.
Ottoshoop, September 4th, 1900. —About 2 p.m. we Tassies and about
another 50 or 60 of P.H.'s, and N.S.W.’s, with a pom-pom, left for Mafe-
king way. After a hurried march at the canter we reached Lowe’s farm,
where we found the convoy outspanned, and that it was a “nulger” about
losing the two, but their gun escort of Imperial Vies, had been sniped at,
with three wounded and eight or nine horses killed and wounded. We
burnt a house near, and then chased a mob of Boers four miles towards
Lichtenburg, and burnt seven or eight other houses, then returned, and
reached camp at 8.30. We had a splendid opportunity of capturing or
cutting up a mob of about 50 Boers, but our officers very foolishly exposed
themselves, and the Boers turned and cleared. They were riding right up
to about 50 of us and the pom-pom. We were out of sight, and in splendid
cover, so could have had them nicely. What d—n fools some men are
to throw away such good chances to have the Boers at their own game.
[Sapiens post eventu.] Captain Riggall is appointed to the staff, so he
was not with us. Captain Baker (N.S.W. Bushmen) was in charge of us
all who went out. S.M. Boyes and Stanworth with his party returned from
Mafeking this evening.
Ottoshoop, September sth, 1900. —After F. Brain and I went down to
the Malmani River and had a good swim ; were back in time to go out
for the horses, then ride them to water as usual. We were paid to-day.
Troopers got £5 each, while the sergeants got £lO. This is Rhodesian
pay.
Ottoshoop, September 6th, 1900. —As usual looking after the lieu-
tenant’s and my horse during the day, and doing a good loaf in between.
Billy MTntyre unwell to-day. After tea he, F. Brain, and I took a stroll
down to the 88th Artillenr lines, and had a good yarn to M‘Donald.
Ottoshoop, September 9th, 1900. —Very windy. Roused at 4 a.m., and
just had time for a little “scoff,” and fell in with the rest of the Bushmen
about 5, and acted as advancing scouts on the left of Lord Errol’s column,
and went in a southerly direction, towards the spot where poor Ted Jacson
was killed. Just before reaching there we Tassies were fired upon, and our
No. 1 troop charged the timber they were in, and roused them on to a
troop of N.S.W., who captured six dismounted men, and 13 more got away.
When getting to the spot where Jacson was killed we burnt all their
houses. After a lot of galloping and messing about, we took up an easterly
direction for awhile, then south again, and came to opposite where


Methuen’s column were shelling some Boer houses, and we lassies were
ordered to charge the position, but could not get across the swampy Molopo
River, so came back. The column then travelled north-east, and came out
on the Lichtenburg road, and travelled on about a mile and then halted for
about an hour or so, and had a little “scoff.” After that we moved a little
further south to water our horses, then went away to the right to take up a
position for the night, but had only just off-saddled when ordered to saddle
up, to return to Ottoshoop. Needless to say we obeyed this order very
cheerfully, as all hands were feeling tired out after such rousing about we
had been getting. 1 had a terrible headache, and my eyes were painful.
Reached camp about 8 p.m. It’s many a day since I felt so tired, almost
too tired to sleep. This morning Lord Douglas went from here with a
column down the Lichtenburg road, and at daylight we could hear the
boom of his artillery, lyddite being used occasionally. Lord Methuen *
column moved out from Mafeking and attacked from the south; we could
hear his artillery “barking,” especially the deadly pom-poms. From what
I could gather, 30 odd prisoners and 20 waggons were captured between
us and Methuen’s column. A good number of the Boers escaped, together
with their leader, General De La Rey; but still Douglas gave them a rough
time. I did hear that Major Biddulph shelled the Boers in their sleep, and
they were seen to “skedaddle” in their shirt tails in all directions. Good
enough. Burning houses could be seen everywhere. As a matter of fact,
our column were doing the “tailing-up” part of the engagement.
Ottoshoop, September 11, 1900. —This morning we could hear heavy
artillery firing in the direction of Lichtenburg. Lord Douglas at De La
Rey again, but this latter gentleman has been reinforced with 12-pounders
and pom-poms. The former evidently had his lyddite guns at work, judging
by the thunderous roar. Pom-poms barking very often. Methuen's guns
went down the Lichtenburg road this morning, very likely to reinforce
Douglas. This afternoon “Curly” Barwick, Beveridge, and I had a 100
yards’ flat run; the former scratch, and B. had seven yards. Beveridge
won easilv; 30s. lost. We had helmets issued to us this afternoon.
Ottoshoop, September 12th, 1900. —About 11.30 received orders to go
out for our horses and be ready to move off by 1 p.m. After hurried dinner
saddled up and moved off across the river. Appears the Boers were sup-
posed to be in strong force on two kopjes about two miles in a south-east
direction from here. We Tassies again sent out to draw their fire. When
they commenced on us we dismounted, horses retired, and we took cover
behind recently-erected earth and stone works, where we fired away at the
Boers at over 2,000 yards. We could see them moving about on top of the
kopje. The two guns of the N.Z. battery started firing at them, but their
practise was very bad indeed. It wanted our friend Biddy with his four
guns of the 88th. We were lying behind shelter firing until about 5.30.
Then we retired, under a hail of bullets, out of range; then on into camp.
At dusk we had a pom-pom at them. With us on the right
were some N.Z., N.S.W., and S.A. The Boer rifle fire was the fiercest
have yet heard. Captain Hubbie was killed and two wounded, all of the


S.A. s. Ihe former was hit by the last shot but one fired at dusk—a stray
unlucky shot truly. This afternoon's fight meant to attract the Boers’
attention whilst Methuen went into Mafeking. But has he gone into Mafe-
king? My opinion is he has an outflanking movement on the boards to
surround them. No doubt about it the Boers are in strong positions.
Ottoshoop, September 13th, 1900.—A beautiful day, but spoiled by the
damnable stench of dead horses.
Ottoshoop, September 17th, igoo.-Were relieved on the kopje out-
post by some N.S.W. s about 11 a.m. F. Brain and I just came back from
the river, aftei having a good wash. As usual did a good loaf in camp.
We supplied a fatigue party of ten to bury dead horses this afternoon. We
had some klobber issued to us. My share was a pair of boots, towel,
shirt, socks, jack knife, a haversack, and tunic. Nothing doing in the
fighting line lately. The Boers are still entrenched on the kopjes where
we were shelling them on the 12th. It seems to be the general opinion we
are going to let them stay, for a while at least.
Ottoshoop, September 18th, 1900. —Arms inspection at 9 as usual,
d hings have been pretty quiet in camp lately. T his morning I received two
opened envelopes, with post marks of February 17 and 26, from mother
and A. respectively. Enclosed in the latter was a strange letter, dated in
April, from Broken Hill, from “Lil” to “My dear Will.”
Ottoshoop, September 19th, 1900—In the morning Tim Riley and I
took a stroll round town. Upon return, dinner time, we found the horses
in from grazing and being saddled. A patrol of Boers seen by our southern
outposts (“Papa s Horse”), also by the northern ones (N.S.W. Bush-
men). Both fired on our outposts, so we Tassies escorted two of the
N.Z. battery of 15-pounders out to both outposts, but nothing more seen
of the Boers. General opinion that they will make an attack on our convoy
coming from Mafeking to-morrow, so we will make a demonstration in
force along the southern side of the road towards Lowe’s farm in the
morning. Away this afternoon about three hours. Upon return W. H. C.
and I had a few words, which ended up in our having a pretty willing fight
for about 15 minutes, neither of us getting the best of it.
Ottoshoop, September 21st, 1900. —All the morning Tim Riley and I
have been getting things ready for running a totalisator in this afternoon’s
sports. We eventually were prevented from running the same by the
officers. The following was the programme:—loo yards flat race; hop,
step, and jump; tug-of-war, 10 a side, one team from each Colonial or Im-
perial corps; wrestling on horseback, six men a side; ditto, fugitive race.
This consists of a team of two men, one mounted and fully equipped, and
the other on foot; the mounted man to ride over two hurdles, pick up the
dismounted man on his horse, and ride back over the hurdles ; jumping in
sections, four a side, one team from each Coloniad or Imperial corps, points
given for pace, style, and turn-out, competitors fully equipped; driving
competition, for artillery; officers’ race, half-mile, for officers’ horses,
“owners up;” officers’ race, quarter-mile, on mules, bareback. Our tug-of-
war team were Riley, Hillier, Packet!, Johnson, Sweeney, Hood, Gardiner,


Sime, Beveridge, and Sullivan, but were beaten by the N.Z.’s. Our team
for the jumping in sections won; N.S.W. Bushmen second, S.A. s third.
Our team consisted of S.M. Boyes, Sergeant Gardiner, Troopers Gerrand
and Sullivan; and they all rode Tasmanian horses. The fugitive race was
very exciting, and won by N.S.W. Bushmen; S.M. Boyes and Billy
MTntyre second. This was run off in heats. Johnson and Bob Chant also
won their heat, but the former dropped his rifle, and was disqualified for
final. The bareback mule race for officers was very laughable. Some of
the boys competed in the other races, but were unsuccessful. Tim Riley
and I left before the sports were over, and did outpost duty, rode out to
the houses below, and had some fun with the Dutch girls there. All hands
had to wear bandoliers and have rifles that went to the sports. Enjo}ed
the races tip-top; a bit new to us after our rough work lately. We supplied
ten men this morning as escort to Lowe’s farm.
Lowe’s Farm Garrison, September 24th, 1900.—Usual arms inspection
at 9 a.m., and a long garrison order read out. Almost all the boys on
guard, picquet, or patrol to-day. Major Barker gives the poor unfortunate
Tassies plenty to do. He acts the king to perfection. Besides doing the
usual work to the two horses, I wrote a lengthy letter home to mother.
Lance-Corporal Sime, Peterson, Cox, and I went on guard at 6 p.m., at one
of the destroyed houses, about 100 yards from here, but after doing about
two hours, the N.S.W. came and relieved us, as they also did to another
guard we were furnishing. We are going out commandeering to-morrow,
hence this messing business. As we were short-handed, Cox (batman to
the sergeant) and I volunteered for guard. Both are naturally exempted.
As we draw our supplies from Mafeking whilst here, Arthur Dyer took the
Scotch cart into that place this morning for same. He also has numerous
orders from us to bring out in the form of luxuries. The skipper and Bob
Lawson came out from Ottoshoop this afternoon for four or five days.
The former is on the Earl of Errol’s staff. From all accounts we shall not
be long now before we journey round to Pretoria to join our second
regiment of Australian Bushmen.
Lowe’s Farm Garrison, September 25th, 1900.—Fell in at 9 a.m. and
went out commandeering in a southerly direction, under Major Kelly,.
Q.M.I. About three miles out,we came across a good many Dutch houses,,
scattered about on the banks of the Molopo River. We could not get
much, as Lord Methuen had taken everything available when he passed
thrcfugh eight days ago. However, I struck the school house, but finding
the door locked, I managed to get in through a window, so was able to
commandeer two forms, two tables, and a hat-rack for the officers; and on
my own account I collared a Dutch wall map of the S.A. Republic, a Dutch
Bible, and a quantity of Dutch children’s school books. At Mrs. Lemmer’s
house (mother of General Lemmer, the Boer leader whom we attacked at
Buffelshock), we also got a Cape cart and a quantity of harness. Of course
naturally—[O, certainly, don't mention it] —several of the boys got fowls,,
pigs, vegetables, etc., on their own account. The first house we visited was
Mrs. Joubert’s, mother of the Boer we captured the day poor Jacson was-


THE BUSHMEN’S CONTINGENT PASSING THROUGH ELIZABETH SIREET, HOBART


killed. He was a field cornet, and was captured in this house. We were
about two miles from the scene of that fight. We returned to camp about
2 p.m. I took the rollers off the Dutch map and wrapped it up to post to
mother, to be mounted and given to father.
Lowe’s Farm Garrison, September 26th, 1900. —We went down to
have arms inspection, but not being enough in camp it was dispensed with.
After this I rode across to where the Dublin Fusiliers are camped (Lowe’s
other farm towards Mafeking), to post some letters, but had to bring them
back and post them here with a N.S.W. corporal detached for that duty
All of us fell in about 5 p.m., under Lieutenant Mace, to escort 20 empty
waggons (they are for Methuen for commandeering purposes), into Ottos-
hoop. I was one of the party who acted as advance scouts. Reached there
safely about 8 p.m., and after a little waiting about we returned in close
order, and came to “anchorage” about 10 p.m. We had a good tea (11 p.m.)
on roast sucking pig.
Ottoshoop, September 30th, 1900. —All the* boys with nine exceptions
up at 3 a.m. Went out on outpost duty to a kopje about two miles north-
west from camp. As Mr. Mace did not go, I stayed behind with the others.
I answered R. C.’s letter this evening. A strict and careful watch has to
be kept now, as the commando three miles south-east from us is getting
very “cockey,” and may attempt an attack on the town. Report had it
that if we did not surrender or clear out before 9 a.m. yesterday morning
they would shell us, but nothing came of it as yet. They tackle the wrong
men when they ask Australians to surrender or run. [Hear! Hear!]
Elands River defence should have taught them that, as that garrison con-
sisted of half Australian Bushmen.
Ottoshoop, October Ist, 1900. —A windy, miserable day. Things very
quiet in camp. [You did all the crowing yesterday.] There are only about
half a dozen of us, but still we have all the horses to feed and water. In the
evening 1 wrote to G. E., answering her two letters. I also did a “Cape
Argus” up to send to father.
Ottoshoop, October 17th, 1900. —Stables, 7-3°; arms inspection, 9 a.m.
About half a dozen of us had a swim. Before getting dressed we were
running foot-races. Corporal George Kemsley came on to this kopje fit
for duty once more. He has quite recovered. Needless to say we were
very pleased and overjoyed to see our popular comrade back again. Cole-
man and Cowen were also at Kimberley when he left. The former had the
little finger of the right hand amputated. The latter not so fortunate. George
heard very little of Douglas, but thought he went down to the Imp. Y.
hospital at Dielfontein, between De Aar Junction and Victoria West Road.
October 19th, 1900. —In the saddle by 1 a.m., with Fourth and Fifth
N.Z.’s. Tassies acted as scouts, so were behind with their horses until day-
break. Then the fun commenced. From where we were there was a
splendid view. The troops could be seen advancing out from Ottoshoop:
but when crossing the open veldt in front of the B.’s Hock Range the
“ping-pong” of the Mausers told us that they were firing on our men. Very


quickly two of our 15-pounders and one pom-pom were pelting their posi-
tion. After about an hour’s heavy shelling our mounted men advanced on
the position, and very quickly had possession. We now had orders to bring
the horses up to the kopje the N.Z.’s had taken, and upon coming up with
them found that the kopje was taken without any opposition. The two
big guns and pom-pom had now galloped across to the foot of the easily
captured kopje, and were soon in action, shelling the retreating Boers.
After about two hours’ messing about we returned to camp, as escort to
the General, Lord Errol. It was not long (2 p.m.) before we were back in
our outpost kopje having our breakfast (?) and dinner in one. After that
I had a couple of hours’ sleep, as we had none last night. Turned in very
early after tea. Upon return we found that a party of our force had also
captured the two big kopjes to the south-east of where we were fighting,
thereby doing good work, as this was the very position we shelled on
September (?) when Captain Hubbe of the S.A.B. was killed. The best
news of all is that we are going to hold them. The object of to-day’s attack
was to let a convoy of four traction engines pass through to Methuen,
who is camped this side of Zeerust somewhere. A strong escort went
through with it. A good day’s work was done, as the Boers lost their
strong positions through the early dawn attacks. It should be a easy
matter to smash Lemmer and Co. up now. The following took part in
to-day’s fight;— First N.5.W.8., 100; 5.A.8., 70; Tassies, 25; Imp. Vies.,
250; Imp. N.S.W., 50; Fourth N.Z., 100; Fifth N.Z., 100; Paget’s Horse,
150; besides four 15-pounders and two pom-poms; so about 800, and all
Australians. From what I could gather our casualties were nil. Have
not heard the Boers’ yet, but I know they had a good few. One of the
prettiest sights I have ever seen was the attack at daylight, from our
position on the extreme left; we could see everything so plainly.
“Chivying” of Boers, October 24th, 1900. —Thunderstorm again about
II a.m.; the third night it has rained, and the second I got wet through.
Were relieved from outpost duty about 5 a.m., then returned to camp, and
had just time to get a little “scoff,” then off after the flying column that
left camp about 2.30 a.m. We followed the spoor, which took us away
behind Buffel’s Hock, and down towards the lead mines. We rode pretty
hard, and came up with them at 8.30 a.m. We then went in the advance,
and were soon in the thick of it, driving the Boers from kopje to kopje. At
last we drove them out into open country, and as they galloped across the
open country a battery of artillery let fly shrapnel all together, then we
took after them, and never yet did I have such an exciting ride. Unfortu-
nately they got the start of us. Now we came in touch with Lord Douglas’
column, who had started from Zeerust, and drove all before him at daylight.
We could hear his artillery going very strong before we started from
Buff el’s Hoek. It appears he had a pretty tough job at first to drive them
from a strong position, but the lyddite did the trick. Several dead Boers
were passed. After we had the exciting chase we paid a visit to some
Dutch houses, but found nothing suspicious. We then rode leisurely along
until we reached the Dutch village of Kaffer’s Kraal, where we had some


“scoff” and off-saddled. We camped here for the night, and turned our
horses into a paddock of green wheat. In the afternoon we went into a
Dutch house close by our camp, and had some music. George Kemsley,
who speaks Dutch, got two very nice girls to play and sing for us. As we
had commandeered a good many sheep, we killed some, and had a good tea
with boiled “spuds.” Turned in early, and down came the rain. We had
no blankets, as our waggons could not be found, so only had our top-
coats and horse blankets; some did not have the latter. Some of our boys
missed us when we had the exciting chase, but they had also an exciting
run after the Boer convoy, and succeeded in capturing thirteen loaded
waggons —food and ammunition. To-day we worked under Lord Methuen,
Lord Errol being on our right, whilst Lord Douglas worked from Zeerust.
The Boers should remember the Australian Bushmen for a good time to
come, for we gave them a good “chivying!” About 40 prisoners taken,
and a great many killed. Our casualties were slight, only two or three
killed and about nine wounded. Douglas’ column camped about a mile
opposite us.
Return March to Buffel’s Hoek, October 25th, 1900. —Roused about
5 a.m., and sent straight away on outpost duty.
Buffel’s Hoek, October 28th. 1900. —Went out commandeering, and
visited a good many Dutch farms on the left hand side of the road. By
Heavens ! we punished the poultry and vegetables. A disgraceful thing
occurred at a house belonging to Mrs. John Botha (son of the commander,
and killed around Mafeking in February last). She was away from the
house when we got there, when we ransacked the whole house. When she
returned and saw the house with everything upside down, she wept very
bitterly. What was commandeered we were ordered by Major Kelly to
return. But I got a photo of “Big Ben” being fired into Mafeking. It was
a pity the widow was not in the house when we arrived, which would have
prevented this sad incident. [Presumably “son of the commandant” should
be “widow;” or that the son was also dead, and the lady his widow.] We
commandeered horse feed chiefly, and a little mealies. I got three fowls,
one duck, one coloured rug, photo of “Big Ben,” four spoons, two knives,
one fork, and a gridiron. We had a thoroughly enjoyable day. After tea
we boiled down all the fowls (12) and sucking pigs (2) we members of
Riley’s gang commandeered, and they will be very easy to carry cold in our
haversacks.
Another “Chivying” of Boers, October 29th, 1900. —Reveille about
2.30 a.m. Early breakfast on commandeered poultry. Saddled up and
“aboard” by 4 a.m., at which time we moved off with Lord Methuen’s
column. We Tassies were right flanking advance party, S.A.B.’s, advance
scouts, and 50 of the Fifth N.Z. left advance flanking party. We extended
fully a mile from the column, and had plenty to do. We moved down
towards Kaffir’s Kraal again, and upon reaching there our fighting com-
menced ; but the Boers were soon put to flight. We drove them right back
and over the high ridge to the north-east of the village, sniping at them,
and being sniped at in return. We then travelled out in the direction of


Zeerust-Rustenburg road, and came in communication, with helio, with
Lord Douglas’ column, who had worked out from Zeerust towards Val-
kop. After a halt of about an hour, when E. Kemsley’s group (he, Dowling,
Brain, and self) were detailed for outpost, we returned to camp at Kaffir’s
Kraal for the night. We reached there about 2 p.m., so soon had a feed.
Messed about during the afternoon watering my and the lieutenant’s horse,
having a wash, commandeering green feed for the horses, rigging up a
shelter for the night, and cooking, etc. About a dozen prisoners
were taken (three by the Tassies), also some ammunition. Two Dutch
farmhouses were burnt; usual thing, our men fired upon from them. The
Commander-in-Chief’s orders are then carried out, viz.—burnt. Bob
Gerrand never turned up when we camped this afternoon. We are all
hoping nothing has happened him.
A reported incident of Boer women treachery, which is supposed to
have occurred when Lord Douglas’ column was working up from Zeerust
down to where we met them last Wednesday. His advances were fired
on from a house, the pom-poms let drive at it, the mounted men closing all
round to prevent escape, but not attempted. Lpon examining the house
a Dutch woman was found dead, and another with one arm off, both done
by the pom-poms. Mauser rifles found, also ammunition, but not the sign
of a Boer. These facts tend to prove that we very often are fired upon
by the female folk. The above was one of the numerous yarns that go
the rounds of the camp, but is believed to be true. About 500 head of
cattle were also commandeered. The force out to-day consisted of about
1,000 mounted men, Fourth Battery of R.A., two howitzers of the 37th, and
same battery that “lyddited” the Mahdi's tomb at Omdurman on September
2, 1898, two pom-poms, and several Maxims.
Methuen's Camp, October 31st, 1900. —The crowd that went out to
Kaffir’s Kraal last night returned about noon, completely knocked out,
having been in the saddle pretty nearly all the time. It appears a Kimberley
scout got wind that 25 Boers were in the habit of sleeping in a certain
house every night, so this expedition went out to effect a capture, but
unfortunately he took them to the wrong place at daylight. Over 20 Boers
were seen to “do a get" from the house to which he should have taken
them. After this they seem to have had a pretty warm time, for a South
Australian (Trooper Millman) was killed, shot through the lung, and
another had his leg broken, through his horse falling on him. Fortunately
none of the 20 Tassies was hit. The whole affair seems to have been
messed up. This is the first time the Tassies have had fun without my
being there. As the boys that went were done, we that remained behind
did horse picquet to-night, and I did 8 to 11. My poor little black pony
came back with a very bad back, so had to bathe it. First time anything
has happened him since my getting him on July 3rd last. Riggall went to
the field hospital here in camp this afternoon. He looks very bad, and
seems to have been run down. Nothing heard of Bob Gerrand yet.
Kaffir’s Kraal, November 8. 1900. —We are under the command of a


Captain x\nderson, of the 1.Y., both Major Barker and Captain Riggall on
the sick list, are in Mafeking Hospital.
March to Lichtenburg, November 9th, 1900. —All hands roused at
midnight, and the column moved off about half an hour later. We Fassies
right in the rear of the convoy, as rear guard. We had a very slow and
tedious job right '‘aft.” Passed through the village of Wonderfontein,
about 9 a.m. had a long halt, as our advance guard were in action driving
“Jackey the Boer” before them. Their laager was at this place, and about
seven or eight waggons (loaded with ammunition, which was immediately
destroyed), were captured. At this place we came in contact with the Ottos-
hoop garrison (Fifth 1.Y., about 100, with guns), and between us 35
prisoners were captured. Two very serious mistakes were made. The O.
garrison mistook some of our men for Boers, and commenced firing and
shelling them, happily without mishap, although close shaves. Again our
artillery shelled some I.Y.’s on our left, but nothing serious. About noon
we halted at Wondergat (“Wonderful Hole”). We now had our breakfast
and dinner in one. We had a much-needed sleep after; none last night,
except a few dozes while under way. Took horses to water at 4 p.m., and
the horse I was on swam right out into deep water, so I got wet through.
The place we watered at was a large hole like an old volcano crater, and
practically bottomless.
March to Lichtenburg, November 10th, 1900. —Roused at 1.30 a.m.,
and under way by 2.45. Until daylight we rode in close order, then were
right flanking advance party. We had a troop of N.S.W. attached to us
for the day. We had nine connecting files 200 yards apart, then we rode
along in line, with four in front and four on our outer flank, so we were
over a mile from the column. On approaching Mavana, a village two miles
before reaching Lichtenburg, the fighting commenced, by the Boers!,
dropping a few shells amongst us. The column changed direction to the
left, and gave chase, with the result that a pom-pom was captured, but
their 15-pounder escaped. Upon changing direction we came out of touch
with our connecting files, with the result that we did not follow them. We
rode on into Lichtenburg, and then waited the column’s return. About n
a.m., we halted on the western side of the town. After dinner Cox and I
got a pass from the lieutenant, so took a stroll round the town. We met
an English parson, also a Dutch ambulance man, and had a quiet interesting
conversation with them both. I found out that Commander Vermoos was
opposing us, also that a Piet Lemmer, supposed to be the brother or cousin
of the General, was killed yesterday around Wonderfontein and Wonder-
gat; about eight killed in all. About 6 p.m. I was one of a party of 12,
under Sergeant James (the Vic. Bushman who has been attached to us
over two months), for outpost duty, about a mile to the westward. Do an
hour each, and I go on at midnight. In conversation with the Boer “pill
box” this afternoon, he stated that the Boers think Lord Roberts has gone
home, and that we Bushmen are leaving shortly. But I impressed upon
him that neither he nor the Bushmen will leave the country while a Boer
remains on the veldt with a rifle. He also stated that the Boers admitted


having received a very rough handling at our hands at Kaffir’s Kraal on
October 24th, and he knows for certain that over 100 have left the com-
mando, and returned home, utterly sick of the war, and defied their leaders
to do their worst. Men are returning home daily, knowing that the struggle
is hopeless now. An important thing he also told us was that Louis Botha,
De La Key, De Wet, Lemmer, and ex-President Steyn met about Elands
River a fortnight ago, and held a council of war. Although nothing is
known yet of their decision, the majority of sensible Boers are hoping
peace will be the result. It took Botha 48 days to come from the Eastern
District to E. River.
Methuen's Camp, Lichtenburg, November nth, 1900. —A report
circulated to-day in camp that Major-General Hunter had a successful
running fight with Chris. De Wet around Bothaville, 0.R.C., killing 30 and
wounding 35, also capturing 100 odd prisoners and seven of his guns; three
Krupp, two 15-pounders, and two pom-poms. Unfortunately, De Wet and
Steyn were seen to escape immediately the first shot was fired [which is
nonsense]. This splendid work by Hunter has practically burst up De
Wet’s followers, so it should very much hasten the end of hostilities.
Apropos of Lord Methuen’s thought for the troops under him, on strolling
through our lines, as he does almost daily, he noticed the N.Z.’s had no
tents, although raining hard, so told them he would see they got them,
also more blankets. An hour or so after tents and a big bundle of blankets
arrived in their lines. He said : “It was a damn shame such good and
splendid troops were so neglected, contracting disease, through the care-
lessness of the Q.M.S.” [Fancy Methuen swearing so !]
Chasing of Boers, November 14th, 1900. —A drink of hot chocolate
and fell in at 12.30 a.m. After about four hours’ march in the dark in south-
east direction, at daylight we came in touch with the Boers, who were
laagered in a strip of dense timber. After a few shots were exchanged
between them and our advance scouts, we gave chase, and after a six miles'
gallop they suddenly halted on a clear ridge, and poured in a very heavy fire
at a range of 1,500 to 2,000 yards, we being all of a heap, having run against
a wire fence. We all (about 280 Bushmen, 5.A.8., N.5.W.8., N.Z., and
Tassies), dismounted, and secured what little available cover we could get,
such as ant heaps and water furrows, and fired away for about half an hour,
when the three 15-pounders came into action. Their practice was very
bad, the shrapnel bursting on the ground beyond the Boers. However,
they very quickly mounted and took off again, and we after them. They
again halted and opened fire on us again, after galloping back about one
and a half miles, but the big guns soon put them to flight. We then rode
slowly on, and were watching them on a low ridge three miles away. But
we were ordered to retire. Previous to this Lord Errol took about 2CO
mounted men, three 15-pounders, and a pom-pom away to the left, and
before we commenced firing his guns were heard “barking” furiously.
When we dismounted the first time the Boers fired one shot from a big
gun at us, but fortunately it fell 1,000 yards short. A great mistake was
made by some of the officers in charge of us Bushmen, to the effect that


Lord Methuen’s orders were not carried out, in performing a right flanking
movement, by which, with the co-operation of Errol on the left, we must
have completely surrounded the Boers and made a substantial capture. My
candid opinion is that the men are mostly to blame, as when chasing the
enemy they are practically unmanageable in their excitement. Australians
need a very strict and stern officer when going into action, otherwise their
good fighting capabilities are thrown away. 1 he country we were operating
in to-day was very open and plain veldt, scarcely a tree, and no rocks to
be seen anywhere. It seems a shame that when we do manage to get
“Jacky the Boer” out in the open things are messed up so. To-day
was the hottest fire I have been under yet. I managed to almost empty
one bandolier. When we dismounted the second time I happened to lose
our boys, but secured a good position close up to the Boers (1,000 yards),
and had a few good shots. The shells from our guns were screaming very
close over my head. We all returned, and reached camp at Lichtenburg
about 11.30, having no casualties, except a few horses hit. About 12
prisoners taken, but little known of their losses, though some are known.
After a good feed all hands were soon asleep, and this is how the afternoon
was put in. On picquet to-night, and did duty 6to 10. I was indeed ready
for the blankets then. We had out to-day about 5 00 mounted men ; six
15-pounders of the Fourth Battery, and two pom-poms, besides three
Maxims. When marching out this morning nobody knew our destination,
another proof of Methuen’s good generalship; even Lord Errol did not
know . Scene of action: Barber’s Panns. When on my own this morning
I had several easy shots at three “Jackies,” and one dropped. Whether he
was killed or wounded I could not say.
Ottoshoop, November 18th, 1900. —Put in the day and evening writing
to Horace, giving him an account of our doings since I wrote last from
Lichtenburg on the nth inst. I also made out a return to send to him,
giving an account of what had become of the 55 Bushmen since leaving
Tasmania. Out of the original number only 26 are left, ten of whom are
non-coms. That does not include Corporal Stanworth, Troopers Hood,
Sweeney, Dyer, Tolman, and Hamilton, who, to-day, sent in their names
as desirous of joining the S. African Constabulary. To-day I went into the
sergeants’ mess, as Mr. Mace “grubs” with them. But he left us this evening
to join his regiment, the N. Lancashire, he having been granted an Imp.
Commission in May last. He came round to each one before leaving,
shook hands, and wished us good-bye. Needless to say we wished him
the best of luck and success in his new sphere.
Vergenoeg, November 23rd, 1900. —Were supposed to have been
recalled from outpost about 3 a.m., but “Curly” Barwick could not find us
until daylight. All the mounted men in camp moved out about 4 a.m.,
went into Jacobsdal, about five miles away, as Boers were reported there.
They cleared upon seeing us. All the Dutch families were packed off into
Mafeking, and justly so, too. They returned about 11 a.m. We were too
late to go. On picquet, and whilst out I wrote to father. Picquet again
to-night, and I drew first shift, 6to 10 p.m. Heavy artillery firing could be


heard early this morning in the direction of Kaffir’s Kraal. Do not know
who it was.
Vergenoeg, November 24th, 1900. —Was busy all the morning helping
Sergeant-Major Boyes make out the pay-sheets. We are being paid from
the day of leaving Hobart, March sth, to end of October, less what we have
already had. Mine dates from April Ist, when I left the Second Contingent.
[Draft of First.] I drew £2O ss. 2d. Have already had £33 4s. lod. After
dinner several of us rode into Zeerust to see the sports. Harry Beveridge
and I competed in the wheelbarrow race, but ran third in our heat. I was
the barrow. Our team (old Bushmen) had the tug-of-war, but were bustled
out of it. Kemsley and Sweeney were our representatives, and the rest
were picked from the S.A. and N.S.W. The sports were very enjoyable,
a band playing, besides a good number of well-dressed Dutch girls. Of
course the officers monopolised them —[hard luck!] —and we unfortunate
troopers could not get a “look in” at any price. There were a great number
of “gentlemen in khaki” present, including our two Generals, Lord
Methuen and the Earl of Errol. Returned to camp about 6 p.m. Twelve
of our lads on outpost duty this evening.
March to Lichtenburg, November 26th, 1900.- —Had a light thunder-
storm last night, then thunder, lightning, and rain for reveille about
midnight. As I had no hrose, I helped load waggons. The fighting portion
of the column moved out towards Lichtenburg at 1 a.m.; we on waggons, at
3. The Q.M.S. of Paget’s Horse rode on waggon I was on. Before reaching
Lichtenburg experienced a severe thunderstorm, too much for me to
describe the rain and thunder, except that it was severe. Found my horse
before outspanning; a nigger had him, so rode part of the trek. Reached
Lichtenburg at 6 p.m., camping inside the town on the south-east corner.
The mounted men and artillery reached here at 11 a.m., without opposition
from Boers. Turned in soon as had some tea, very tired. Kemsley, Brain,
Dowling, and I slept in a Dutchman’s outhouse (fowlhouse).
Lichtenburg, November 27th, 1900. —After breakfast our Q.M.S.
brought us down a very acceptable mail, so spent the morning and part
of afternoon in reading my nine letters and several newspapers. Three days
behind in my diary, so wrote it up after tea. The Boers fired on our party
out for wood this morning. All hands in high spirits to-day upon receipt
of the ever-welcome home mail. It is over a month since our last lot of
letters.
Lichtenburg, November 29th, 1900. —No rain for a wonder. Put the
day in answering letters and in reading. On picquet, but horses required
very little attention, as we let them loose in the paddocks where we are
camped. The return cricket match, Australian Bushmen v. England, was
played this afternoon, and we were beaten by seven runs. Scores, 50 and
57. Our representatives were Barwick and F. Johnson, who only got
2 and o.
Lichtenburg, November 30th, 1900. —Put the day in writing mother.
On outpost duty (one officer, one sergeant, and 12 others) to-night.
217


Sergeant Boyes in charge, and we did duty on the north-west end of the
town. A funny incident happened when going on outpost duty. We marched
on to the parade ground, when it rained hard, so we got under the shelter
of a large building. A squad of Tommies marched past in the rain
to their post, and we Australians serenaded them by singing loudly, “For
you are the soldiers of the Queen,” etc.
Lichtenburg, December ist, 1900. —After dinner went along to the
market and saw an exhibition of boxing. Stanworth made a good show,
and secured second prize in the 11 stone class. Went to a sing-song in
the evening, Lord Methuen present, also this afternoon at the boxing.
Trek and Kaffir’s Kraal, December 4th, 1900. —No Boers to be seen
again to-day. “Jacky” evidently does not like wet weather. Riley unwell
to-day, and he also attended sick parade this morning. Has malaria also.
Trek and Jacobsdal, December sth, 1900. —Reveille at 3.30 a.m., and
trekked out at 5, for Jacobsdal. Outspanned about 10 a.m. Too unwell,
so rode on waggon. Spent a very restless night. Quartered in empty
Dutch houses, and it seems quite at home to have a roof over our heads
again. It’s a good many days since I slept under one. A mail for us; I
got only two and two papers. Tasmanian papers are exceedingly welcome,
as we can see how things are going on in dear old Tassie. One can appre-
ciate and feel proud of his native land when away for such a time. F.
Johnson very unwell to-day ; he, Riley, and I sick parade this morning. I
have a nasty lump in my left groin, no doubt caused by a veldt sore, which
has appeared in the back of my ankle. Difficult to walk; am breaking up
it seems !
K.K., Trek, and Wonderfontein, December Bth, 1900. —Twenty of the
boys turned out at 3 a.m. to go commandeering. A pom-pom went with
them a little after daylight. They had plenty of sniping. Received a
hurried order about 11 a.m. to pack up and away. The boys had just time
on return to have their dinner, when the baggage convoy moved off. The
cause of all these sudden movements is supposed to be a supply convoy
being stuck up at Wonderfontein that left here this morning at 2 o’clock
for Lichtenburg. A strong force, with guns, moved out from here at noon
to relieve the convoy, and we formed part of the escort to the baggage
convoy, so we are practically divided into three lots. I rode on the waggon,
not well enough to ride yet. Our boys were left advance flanking party,
and when within six miles of Wonderfontein they were fired on. It appears
MTntyre, R. Chant, Pietersen, and Alf. Leete were on a small kopje dis-
mounted, and, looking round, when suddenly the Boers opened fire from
out some timber. Their horses immediately stampeded towards the enemy.
Alf. Leete started to run and catch them, but the Boers’ rifle fire was too
warm. “Curly” Barwick, F. Brain, Sergeant James, Harry Cox, and
Herbert Dowling very pluckily rode out and picked up the men. G.
Kemsley also lost his horse, having had a fall when trying to stop the other
four runaways. Heathcote and Harry Hood also deserve great praise, for
they pluckily rode out, too, to assist the five, and helped them considerably.
From what they told me, it was a great wonder none of the lads was


hit. Ihe big - guns were in action for over an hour to drive the Boers from
their positions. It appears the Boers followed us up and attacked our rear
guard. Outspanned at Wonderfontein at 6 p.m. Just as night fell heavy
tiring was carried on between the Boers and our outposts. Some of our
volleys were a treat to listen to. With both fights to-day we had no
casualties, but don’t think the Boers came off so well. The supply convoy
was right when the column caught up, but the former drove the Boers off.
Had a wretched ride on the waggon to-day; very much off, indeed.
Irek and Malmani Eye, December 9th, 1900. —Reveille at 3.30, and
trekked out at 4.45 a.m. for Malmani Eye; outspanning about 10 a.m.
The supply waggon went out for Lichtenburg long before we left, and a
little after daylight we could hear the big guns going strong for fully two
hours. A Boer doctor came into our lines this morning for medicine, and
stated that they suffered heavily yesterday, but would not say to what
extent. A little better to-day. The five men who distinguished themselves
yesterday have had their names sent to Lord Methuen, through our O.C.
(Major von Donop), for special mention.
Trek to Lichtenburg, December 13th, 1900. —Reveille at 3,30, march-
ing out for Lichtenburg at 4.45 a.m., reaching this place about 10 a.m.
I on the waggon again. Our mounted men trekked an hour before the
convoy, and were part of the supply convoy’s escort. Our group made our
usual double waterproof kir. Put the day in writing home to Cecil, in
answer to his last. Order this evening of a move against the Boers at 1
a.m., so turned in early. Grazing guard to-day, and when out started a
letter to C.
Lienfontein, December 14th, 1900.—Reveille at 12.30, fell in at 1.30
a.m. The whole column out. Some of the I.Y. and big guns moved out
an hour before us. We marched for about six miles in a south-east
direction. A little after sunrise the fun commenced by “spotting” our
enemies ahead of us. Major von Donop took us (composite reg. of Bush-
men) to the right of the column at a gallop, trying to cut remnants of
their convoy off, which we were successful in doing, after fully an eight-mile
gallop. We secured 10 waggons, with 82 trek oxen, 700 head of cattle,
800 sheep, four Cape carts, six prisoners, five mules, 12 horses, quantity
of forage, mealies, and ammunition (soft-nosed bullets). So we 180 odd
did very well. Whilst we were carrying on our “wholesale thieving,” we
could hear the 15-pounders and pom-poms of the crowd that came out
an hour ahead of us, and the column’s big guns also. We had a skirmish
with a few Boers; I fired off over 20 rounds at long range. On our return
K,, 8., D., and I commandeered, “on our own account,” a big fat turkey,
five fowls, a portmanteau, and a quantity of hide reins (to use for our kir).
The column also captured 12 waggons, 500 head of cattle, 400 sheep, some
young horses, and a large quantity of small arms’ ammunition, but no
prisoners. One of the I.Y. was slightly wounded. Several Boers were
known to be knocked over, but through a mistake of our guns shelling the
A.V.R. (Imp. Vies.) fully 40 Boers escaped. On our return we rode on


to the captured waggons, and led our horses in camp at 6 p.m., tired and
hungry.
Lichtenburg, December 16th, 1900. —Too late for church parade, so
went down and heard the sermon and Lord Methuen’s customary speech
after. He touched very feelingly on General Lemmer’s death; also the
foolhardiness of the Boers. He told us of a reverse that befel General
Clements, between Rustenburg and Pretoria, from De La Rey, in which
half of the Second Battalion of the Fifth Fusiliers were captured. Had a
scratch game of cricket in the afternoon, and reading in the evening. This
evening an empty ox convoy went into Mafeking with a strong escort, with
guns. “Curly” Barwick, Stanworth, and Riley went with it, and took three
condemned horses, and they will bring remounts back, if any at Mafeking.
Methuen’s Camp, Lichtenburg, December 17th, 1900. —Detailed for
brigade mounted orderly, and reported myself at the orderly tent at 6 a.m.
Had very little to do during the day. Wrote home to R. in the evening.
Our boys played a scratch match of cricket this afternoon. In to-night’s
orders applications were invited for signallers for Lord Errol’s brigade, so
I intend having a shot at it in the morning.
Methuen’s Camp, Lichtenburg, December 18th, 1900. —After break-
fast I went down to Lord Errol’s headquarters and reported myself to the
lieutenant of signallers. He told me he would send word along this after-
noon if my services should be accepted as a brigade signaller. In the
afternoon we Tassies played and beat the N.Z. at cricket. Scores : Tassies,
61 for eight wickets (innings declared closed); and they got 48, so a victory
for us of two wickets and 13 runs. Our team was S.M. Goucher, Gardiner,
Johnson, Cox, Hood, Packett, Heathcote, Brain, MTntyre, James, and
myself. Our bowling was done by Cox (2), James (2), Packett (3), and
self (2). About 3.30 received word to report myself at signallers’ quarters,
which I did. Had a trial with the flag, and taken on. Our lads went
away this evening as part of escort to an empty ox convoy to Ottoshoop.
I lent my horse to Frank Brain. I cannot permanently take up my
quarters there until my horse returns, so will just go across for drill.
Trek and Ottoshoop, December 23rd, 1900. —Reveille at 2.30, and
marched out at 4 p.m., eventually camping two miles from Ottoshoop about
II a.m. Again I was detailed as signaller to the left flanking party, who
were N.S.W. Imp. Bushmen, same as yesterday. After having something
to eat, had a sleep. When taking my horse to water I had an enjoyable
swim in the Malmani. After tea went for a stroll, and found Tim Riley
and Stanworth camped with the N.Z. Our boys are camped further in the
town, but shift camp out here in the morning. Felt very much off this
morning. Lichtenburg evidently does not agree with me, as last time
leaving I was also unwell.
Ottoshoop, December 24th, 1900. —Reveille at 2.30; paraded at 4 a.m.
A large convoy is going through to Zeerust, and the column will see that
it passes through safely. A little sniping on the left flank, but a few pom-
pom shots settled matters. I was signaller to the left flankers. Before
reaching Jacobsdal the column halted for an hour or two until the convoy


passed along on its way, then we returned, reaching camp about i p.m.
Had a swim after dinner. After tea went across to see the boys, and
stayed all night, Christmas Eve, and we had a splendid bit of fun. Speeches
and songs the order of the night. I turned in with Stanny.
Methuen s Camp, Ottoshoop, Christmas Day, 1900. —A perfect day.
Put the morning in writing home to father. Church parade, but did not go.
Lord Methuen preached. Our Christmas dinner was Ai. A tarpaulin was
for a tent, and the dinner was cooked by Bill Sweeney, which con-
sumed of roast beef, roast spuds, peas, plum pudding, sauce, tarts, and plum
cake. Sweeney made all the pudding, and Tim Riley the cake, and both
were real good, no mistake. All hands (officers and sergeants excepted)
dined together, and a real enjoyable time was spent. Shall never forget
my Christmas dinner 1900 eaten in South Africa whilst on active service.
Ate so much that I had to sleep the effects off during the afternoon. Things
were lively in camp to-day and evening, singing and cheering to be heard
all round. Big heads for some of them to-morrow.
Ottoshoop, Boxing Day, 1900.—Reveille at 2.30, and march out at 4
a.m. We went down the Lichtenburg road for a mile, crossed the
Malmani River, and passed to the south of the Swartz Kopjes, and made
across country towards Kaffir's Kraal, and came out on the K.K.-
Jacobsdal road. Then the order was given to canter, and we cantered all
the way into Jacobsdal; very rough ride. Reached there at 9, and left again
at 10. Had a good many stoppages on the way back, and reached camp
at 1.30 p.m. Another large convoy went into Zeerust to-dav, and we made
a demonstration in force so it would get through safely. Sniping on the
right when turning up towards Jacobsdal. I was detailed as signaller to
the right flankers (troop of A.1.R.). Escort to the convoy had a little
firing between Buffel’s Hock and Jacobsdal. After dinner I had a swim.
Turned in early, as very tired. Slept outside of tent. As a result of
yesterday’s imbibing, out of about 50, only 17 turned up on parade (Paget’s
Horse). Several other units in same box. The wife and family of Com-
mandant Botha were brought in with us to-day. Will be sent into
Mafeking.
Irek and Mafeking, December 30th, 1900. —Very wet and miserable
until about 10 a.m., then it cleared up a beautiful day. Reveille at 2,30,
packed everything up, then fell in a little after 4, but it was fully 5.30 before
we were away. The rain evidently delayed things. I was detailed as
signaller to the guns. We reached Mafeking about noon, camping on
eastern side of the town. M‘Cadden and I went into town, and had a good
dinner, returning soon after. Went back about 4.30 p.m. Had tea at the
Soldiers' Institute, then went to a young Irish fellow’s house and had a
yarn, returning to camp by 9.30. This fellow, John Tellie, came from the
same town in Ireland as M'Cadden, viz., Belfast. This afternoon and even-
ing had a very severe attack of neuralgia; in great pain.
Mafeking, December 31st, 1900. —M'Cadden put the day in in Mafe-
king, having dinner and tea there. Made several small purchases. This
THE BUSHMEN’S CONTINGENT,


morning 1 posted, registered, to Harold, a portion of my diary, and in the
afternoon wrote him, advising him to that effect. The Bedford Band was
playing outside of the Mafeking Hotel in the evening. The town was
very lively and gay to-night. The place is very much improved since I
was here last, August 14th.
Mafeking, New Year's Day, 1901. —A fine day. M‘Cadden and I spent
the afternoon at the Soldiers’ Institute, and wandering about the town. In
the morning I had my photo taken by D. Taylor, on my horse, in full
fighting rig, and again as a signaller. I ordered a dozen of first and half
of last, to be forwarded to Harold when done. I wrote C. this afternoon.
About 8 p.m. we went round and had a yarn to Mr. Tellie until after 11 p.m.
Trek to Tarings, January Bth, 1901. —Reveille at 2.30; march out at
4 a.m., outspanning at Goed Hoek at 9.30 a.m. After “scoff” things were
a little astir in camp, through Boers sniping at our eastern outposts.
Several squadrons of mounted men went out, but nothing of importance
occurred. Lieutenant Martin, M'Cadden, and Thomas out, and we in camp
had the helio and flag going in reply. Every day now we shall have two
or three of us signallers on outpost duty. Toothache and neuralgia still
bad. After tea this evening Walker and I took a stroll round the refugees’
laager, and had a yarn to some of the Dutchmen.
Trek to Blickfontein, January 17th, 1901. —Reached Blickfontein about
11 a.m. Last night the long ox convoy trekked out at 5, and this morning
they were met by an escort from Kuruman, who took half of the convoy
on, the Schweitzer-Renecke Garrison (mounted police) going on with them,
whilst the Sixth 1.8.’s joined us when near Blickfontein; our advance guard
had a bit of sniping at a few Boers. About 3 p.m. we received orders to
saddle up and away, and after a io-mile gallop we camped for the night
at Whit Pann. It appears a commando were at this place this morning;
but the devils cleared out when they saw us coming. Divisional orders to-
night stated that this column had relieved the garrison of Schweitzer-
Renecke, bringing black and white refugees, for whom homes were found
at Vryburg and Taungs ; 5,800 sheep and 200 head of cattle were confiscated.
The Lieutenant-General received word that Daniel’s Ouiel was besieeed
o
on January sth, and the garrison then called upon to surrender, but the
Lieutenant-General sent word along that he would relieve them on the 20th.
At Blickfontein we heard that the Boers had retired, and that this column
has been successful in preventing the Boers trekking south. All this good
work done practically without a shot being fired. Hurrah!
Bavian’s Kloof, January 22nd, 1901. —Resting. Our baggage convoy
came into camp about daylight. The following came out in divisional
orders:—Orders by Lieutenant-General Lord Methuen, K.C.U.0., Com-
manding Western District, Bavian’s Kloof, January 22, 1901.
I. The Lieutenant-General thanks the division for the cheerful way it
has performed the hard march during the last 15 days. The trek was 247
miles, and 60 miles were covered in the last two days. The objects of the
march have been attained, because, in addition to withdrawing the garrison

Trek, February 2nd, 1901. —Warmest day experienced in South Africa
yet. _ Marched at 5 a.m. in a north-easterly direction, but did not know our
destination. Was one of the connecting links between scouts and column.
A hen about 10 miles out some trouble occurred over finding insufficient
water, so had to move in a westerly direction towards Pridemoe and out-
spanned about noon at Faurescaf for the day. The ox convoy moved out
last night from Paiings, and we came up with it where mistake over water
was discovered, as it outspanned there. The escort consisted of 100 C.B R’s
two pom-poms, Sixth Fusiliers, and North Lancs. Our camp is about
four miles from where the ox convoy outspanned. When drawing water
for the ox convoy some of the escort had the Boers “sniping” at them
pretty freely, but nobody hit, thank God. After tea I paid a visit to the
boys for a yarn.
Trek, February 3rd, 1901.—At noon church parade, as a funeral service
for her late Majesty, who was buried yesterday. Much sympathy expressed
for the South Aus. in their sad losses to-day. The country passed through
to-day very nasty for us, but suitable for the Boers’ treacherous guerilla
warfare. Dodds was with Worthington when he was shot, so he bound his
wound up for him.
Trek, February 4th, 1901.—Trekked out from Uitvalskop at 5 a.m..
halting at Fbenezer at 9? after doing about 10 miles. Ihe Boers commenced
on our advance and right flankers, when only five miles out, so had to drive
them back. The country was flat and scrubby, which suited them to a
“tee.” Another of Warwick’s scouts wounded, and Boyd, who was up with
THE BUSHMEN’S CONTINGENT ,


them, bound his nasty wound for him. Ihe second time our signallers, with
the scouts, acted the ambulance man. We camped in hat spot, with thick
scrub, having no cover for the outposts. Ihe Boers were sniping Nos, I
and 2 post all day, and about 5 pun. they (Tenth IA.) retired on the camp.
The C.B.R. were sent out to settle things again. Lord Methuen very
much put out at these men deserting their post, and rightly so, too. Had
the Boers known this, just fancy how they could have smashed things
up! Not the first time this regiment has done the same thing. The
extreme right flankers to the ox convoy in trouble again with Jacky.
They were four N.Z.’s, and thinking the men they saw in front were British
(dressed in khaki), rode quietly up to them, and the Boers thought the
N.Z.’s were Boers also, so this mistake was the means of saving their lives,
for the Boers told them so. After taking the N.Z. horses, saddles, and
accoutrements, they were allowed to return to the column again. All Dutch
houses passed were looted, and the families brought along: they will be sent
to Vryburg or Tarings eventually. To-day I was just behind the scouts,
signaller, connecting with the column. Camped within two miles of rail-
way line.
Trek, Schweitzer-Renecke, February 10th, 1901 (Sunday). Reveille
12.30, marching at 2 a.m. We make an attack on Boers. I was detailed
to the left screen, and about sunrise two Boers fired six shots at us. Shortly
afterwards the column came up at the canter, which was kept up until
within a mile of Schweitzer-Renecke. Here the fun commenced in right
earnest. The Boers were in strong force on a stony ridge quarter-mile
beyond the town, and paid particular attention to our advance, who had
secured cover within the town. In the meantime Lord Errol had taken a
strong party, with two big guns and pom-poms, to the right as an out-
flanking movement. Just as he started off we in the front had two 15-
pounders in action, but “Jacky” would not make a stand when such good
firing was performed by these gunners. The shrapnel was bursting with
a splendid accuracy. Whilst these two guns were in action a party of
horsemen were seen away to the left, which was Colonel von Donop, with
the C.8.R., one pom-pom, and two Maxims, who moved out at 11.15
last night. He worked on our left flank, and made a wide detour. The
Boers were driven from their strong position behind the town, and the
left flanking party came in touch with them, and eventually drove them back
to the eastward. The column then made a wide circuit, and returned to the
town, camping on the east side, and right bank of the Hartz River, by
10.30 a.m. Our casualties were two slightly wounded, whilst three dead
Boers were picked up and one captured. Lpon returning to camp after
the fight a few of us had a look round the positions held by the Boers, and,
judging by the empty cartridges, they must have expended a good number
of rounds of ammunition. I picked up four different kinds of ammunition,
viz.—Mauser, Lee-Enfield, Martini-Henri, and Manlian. After dinner had
a good sleep.
Wolmeranstad, February 14th, 1901. —Boyd and I roused at 4 a.m,.
and out with the C.B.R. at 5.30 a.m. Were commanded by the G.O.C. to a


A Lionfontein, distant about five miles from camp due south. We
went out for the purpose of blowing up a mill and commandeering, but
could not find the former. Some of the N.Z. captured two Boers after an
exciting chase. I was stationed on a very high kopje, between the village
and our No. 5 outposts, so as to be in communication with the camp.
Could not manage the helio at all; my first attempt alone, but luckily Boyd
came to my help. Ihe first message sent in was, “200 Boers, with guns,
moving south-east; send reinforcements at once.” Just as this was sent
in Ford Methuen came up and wrote the following message for us to
send;—“ Enemy has made a westerly retrograde movement, so do not send
reinforcements. We could plainly see about 200 Boers beyond this village
whilst on the kopje. Ten South Aus. were my guards. We all returned
to camp by 11 a.m. About 2 p.m. the Boers made an attack on our
d post, who were reinforced, and drove them off. Then they tackled
Xo. 4 (north-east) post in force. About 150 mounted men, a pom-pom,
and two 15-pounders turned out. The kopje on which the outpost were is a
long, strong, high one, running down to nothing the camp end. The men
and guns took up a position on one end of the kopje, when a heavy rifle
fire from both sides ensued. The pom-pom fired a great number of shells.
The big guns took up a position on the flat plain below the kopje, but had
no sooner come into action than ‘Jscky opened fire on these two guns with
two of their (supposed to be) 7-pounder Krupp guns from the top of the
kopje. Now a splendid artillery duel was carried on up to nightfall. Our
guns even continued firing in the darkness. About 5 p.m. we brought out
a third big gun. The Boer shells very seldom burst, but they performed
good practice, and had they burst, considerable damage would have been
done to our gunners. They were using segment shell at us. Our casualties
were five wounded, and 15 horses killed. We took six prisoners. The
Boers must have suffered very heavily. There must have been over 500
attacking us. The first time I have witnessed an artillery duel, and it is a
fine and exciting sight to the onlookers, but should think it would not be
very “happy” to the directly interested. We signallers viewed the sight
from the top of our waggon. No doubt about it, the Fourth Battery of
R.F.A. is a good one, and would run Biddulph’s 88th very close. We are
certain of a good fight to-morrow, and, if I judge rightly, “Jacky” will be
losing his two guns shortly.
Syberfontein, February 15th, 1901. —I had the opportunity of viewing
the position held by the Boers yesterday. There were three dead Boers
together, and never have I seen a more horrid sight in my life than two of
them looked. A pom-pom shell had evidently struck them full in the face,
so they were practically unrecognisable. As I write this I fancy I can see
the ghastly sight now. Everywhere were signs of great slaughter on the
Boer side. Ten dead bodies were picked up by us and buried. Disgraceful
that the Boers did not bury their dead. About four miles on our way the
fun commenced again, and the Boers were driven from ridge to ridge, until
we finally outspanned for the day, about noon, at Syberfontein, after
trekking about 14 miles. Again to-day the Boers must have suffered con-


siderably, for four dead bodies were reported picked up by us. The
country passed over was bare and undulating, so good chance for our
artillery. Our gunners dropped about half a dozen shells right among a
party of Boers riding in close order, without them knowing of our close
proximity; they suffered by it. We had one slightly wounded to-day.
Thompson on outpost, and then relieved by Walker. Dodds, Mac., and I
also on to communicate with our outer station. Boers seen all the after-
noon around us, riding aimlessly about the veldt. I commandeered two
ducks and a fowl, and between us we had them, twelve fowls, for tea. Our
baggage convoy and supply column trekked four, five, and six deep, so were
close up together.
Trek, Rietfontein, February 16th, 1901. —Another day’s fight. When
about four miles out the enemy opened fire on our scouts. The C.8.R.,
under Colonel von Donop, rode away on the left flank, and chased about
300. The latter suddenly halted, dismounted, and poured in a murderous
fire at a range of 400 yards. Our boys returned their fire, and expended
almost all their ammunition, when “Jacky” retired. The C.B.R. had four
wounded (two N.S.W. and two S.A.), and one missing (Russell, of N.Z.),
but supposed to have been killed. Whilst the C.B.R. were in action another
party of our men were engaging the enemy on their right, or left of the
convoy. The big guns did some excellent shooting again, driving the Boers
from ridge to ridge. Colonel Meyrick had a third party on the right flank,
and had a lively fight of it, he also driving the enemy before him. One
of the Warwicks’ scouts wounded with him. We had about an hour’s
halt at a spot called Rietpan, and then made for where we camped, which
was at Rietfontein. The former place is about six miles from the latter.
We on the left were out of touch with the supply column and baggage
convoy. Total casualties, six to-day. We marched again at 11 p.m., so
only had one and a half hours’ sleep. Are making a night’s forced march
somewhere on to “Jacky’s” laager. Did about 14 miles to-day. Again to-
day the waggons trekked three, four, and sometimes five deep.
Trek, Paardepleats, February 17th, 1901. —A beautiful day. Com-
mencement of this day found the column marching wearily along towards
“Jacky’s” two laagers. I was detailed to the left screen, and we caught
two Boers, who practically rode into our hands. At dawn we altered our
direction to the left. About 6we came on top of a ridge, and saw one or
the Boer laagers. The column very quickly came up and made straight
for it, and, by Jove, the most exciting bit of fun it has ever been my lot to
experience. Colonel von Donop took a party away to the right, and ahead
of us. Very funny to see the Boers trying to gallop off with their Cape
carts, but a few shots after them soon altered their tactics. Some of our
boys had an exciting chase after two Boers and a Cape cart loaded with
ammunition, which they captured. We made a large haul of prisoners, Cape
carts, waggons, cattle, sheep, horses, and mules ; while Colonel von Donop
galloped ten miles further on and captured their main laager. The total
capture to-day is as follows; 38 prisoners, 22 boys, 71 Cape carts and
waggons, n,ooo sheep, 2,000 cattle, 100 horses, 60 donkeys, and 6.000


rounds of ammunition (a lot of which were soft-nosed Mausers). Capital
haul, and the largest made by Lord Methuen yet. Well done, “Paul,” old
man! No doubt of it we caught “Jacky” on the hop this time right enough.
It was a very amusing sight to see our troops returning to camp with
all kinds of loot, from a fully-saddled horse down to a fowl, and back again.
Never shall I forget the sight. The laager we captured was the “Vrouw”
one, so a large number of women and children may be counted in our list
of captures. Poor “Mr. Boer” must feel uncomfortable this night, so he
may try and regain his lost property. After our midday “scoff” Thompson
and I had a very interesting stroll round camp, to have a look at the
prisoners and captured Cape carts and waggons. We were just in time to
see the Provost Marshall (Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, R.A.), take down
the names of our prisoners. We have 43 prisoners in camp now, who are
guarded by the N. Lancs, infantry. Twelve months to-day since we
anchored in Table Bay (the Second Tas. Contingent), in the s.s.
“Moravian.”
Trek, Hartebeestfontein, February 18th, 1901. —Marched at 5.15 a.m.
Baggage convoy, supply column, refugee waggons, and captured Boers’
laager trekking eight deep, so as to be close together. What with cattle,
sheep, and waggons, we have a very large convoy to protect. Just after
we moved out a large number of Boers were sighted ahead. When five
miles out our advance was fired on by some Boers from off kopjes on our
right and left. Our big guns were then brought up and a pom-pom, and
commenced shelling the nasty-looking kopjes ahead. Whilst this was being
done the Boers commenced shelling us from the left front, but the half-
dozen shells they fired buried themselves in the ground without exploding.
My first experience of being actually under shell fire. Now the Tenth I.Y.
advanced in open order, and received a murderous fire. They gained cover,
and advanced on top of some kopjes. The A.l.R.’s, Third 1.Y., Sixth 1.8.,
and some of the C.B.R. (including our boys), followed soon after in the
order named. After dismounting, they advanced to the top of this rocky
kopje, and, by Heavens! what a fire they received. It sounded as if a dozen
Maxims were turned on them. The big guns came across, and went into
action at 800 yards from the concealed enemy. The nature of the ground
and position held by the Boers were such that shrapnel had very little
chance of doing much damage, it being very rocky. The three other big
guns were in action from the head of the convoy, and shelling both sides
of the pass that we must pass through. Colonel Meyrick, with the five I.Y.
and a pom-pom, were having a lively go on the right, and at one time
it was necessary to fire the pom-poms at 200 yards, so things there were
pretty lively. Most of the fighting was on the left. After about two hours’
fighting it was found that the force on the left was not strong enough to
drive the Boers out, so the N. Lancs, were sent for, but “Tommy” altered
things. After another hour’s tough fighting, the Boers were driven from
their strong positions, but we had suffered, and that very badly too. It
was a heart-breaking sight to see the top of the kopje, after the Boers were
driven away. Everywhere could be seen our dead, dying, and wounded,


with the ambulance men at work. “Tommies, Yeomanry, and Australians
all together. Colonel Meyrick was successful in his work on the right, for
he drove them before him. He also suffered very badly. When looking at
the position held by the Boers, it seemed impossible to dislodge them. From
information gathered later on in the day from friends, there must have been
o - . -
over 2,000 Boers against our 600 odd, for we scarcely had that many in the
firing line. Boers could be seen hovering all round our laagered convoys
(which were placed in rows of 10), and the C.8.R., under Colonel von
Donop, had to guard them, together with eight Maxims, two pom-poms,
and three big guns. Several times during the stubborn fight it was
necessary to bring up more ammunition for both artillery and rifles. It was
after 2 p.m. before the convovs could pass down the steep pass and outspan
on the level veldt beyond for the day. Had the opportunity of looking
through the little town here. Several of our shells came into it during the
fight, but nobody seems to be hurt, except a few houses wrecked. Our total
casualties are 61 all told. A.l.R.’s suffered the most, having Lieutenant-
Colonel Kelly, Lieutenant Parker, and Mann all badly wounded, besides
three killed and eight others wounded. N. Lancs, had six killed and about
ten wounded. The Sixth I.Y. had one killed and four wounded; Tenth I.Y.
some killed and wounded; Captain Warwick badly hit. There were 16
killed and about 45 wounded, some very badly. Lord Methuen was heard
to say that to-day’s fight was the hardest and toughest since Magersfontein,
when taking into consideration the positions we attacked, and the small
number of our men against superior numbers of the enemy. Captain
Warwick, of Warwick’s Scouts, and Chief of Methuen’s Intelli-
gence Department, was amongst the wounded. Our General feels
this loss. It was a never-to-be-forgotten sound to hear
the ping-pong of the Mausers, the sharp metallic ring of
the Lee-Enfields, the nasty bark of the pom-poms, and the thunder-
ing boom of artillery. I imagine I can still hear it. As yesterday was the
bright side, so to-day was the black side of warfare. It was 4 p.m. before
we camped, and never were men more ready for their meals, and we needed
no rocking to sleep. Lord Methuen seemed very downcast at our heavy
losses. He is exceedingly feeling in that respect. Thank God none of our
boys were hit, though some had very narrow escapes. Lieutenant Adams
had a bullet through his' tunic, and just missed his heart: lucky fellow!
When camping it came on to rain hard, brought about probably by the
heavy artillery fire. We have only 80 rounds of big gun ammunition left
in the column, and still 14 miles off Klerksdorp. We cannot stand such
another day’s fight. Am fully convinced that artillery is indispensable,
although it does little damage when compared with rifle fire, but, still, it
has very demoralising effects. But it seemed to-day as if “Jacky” would
not be demoralised. If we only had the gin. howitzers to pelt lyddite things
might have been more easy for us. The Boers made a verv determined
attempt to regain their lost property. But Lord Methuen is a grand
general: we have perfect confidence in him. Of course, it is impossible to
know what the Boer casualties were, but they never would have retired


from their strong positions had they not lost heavily. We picked up three
dead bodies. Ihe people in Hartebeestfontein told ns that they were very
busy taking away dead and wounded, so that looks like business. We had
seven commandoes of 2000 odd men against us, and some names of the
leaders were De Beers, Du Toit, Vermaar, Potgieter, and De Villiers.
Iwelve months to-day some of the second contingent landed. How time
flies ! People in England and Australia imagine the war is over; let those
“street-corner generals” come out and see for themselves !
Klerksdorp, February 21st, 1901. —The following appeared in this
evening s Divisional Orders : —l\ . “The following message has been re-
ceived from the Commander-in-Chief:-—-“The General 0.C.-in-Chief desires
to express his highest appreciation of the excellent work done by Lord
Methuen, both in marching and in fighting. At the battle of Hartebeest-
fontein they showed the greatest gallantry and dash, and the C.-in-C., in
thanking Lord Methuen and the officers, desires to place on record the
distinguished services of this column.' ” Comments are needless, on the
strength of the above, of our recent tough fight at Hartebeestfontein, when
such a general as Lord Kitchener passes to us such praise. But this can-
not return to life the gallant men that fell in the sad encounter.
Trek, Doornfontein, February 25th, 1901. —Leave Klerksdorp at 5 a.m.
After about 15 miles' trekking we outspanned at noon at Doornfontein.
We had no opposition from “our friends” en route, but about 5.30 p.m. we
were compelled to bring into action two 15-ponnders to shell about 50 Boers
who were coming rather too close to our outposts. Good practice was
done at 6500 yards. ihe dozen shells fired were very close to the enemy
indeed. Orders round camp for all hands to sleep with boots and clothes
on, also rifles and bandoliers handy, in case of night attack. “Jacky”
may let us have some of his pig iron during our slumbers. Sergeant Dodds
left us this morning, and is going to rejoin his contingent (third Q.M.1.)
somewhere about Pretoria. We were all very sorry to lose him, as he is
a capital signaller, besides good company. To-day we heard some very
cheerful war news. De Wet lost one 15-pounder, one pom-pom, and 50
prisoners to Plumer. General French made the following splendid cap-
tures : —IOBO waggons, 155,000 sheep, 18,200 cattle, 100,000 S.A. ammuni-
tion, 79 prisoners, 284 (known) killed and wounded, 190 surrendered. What
a haul! This Boer reverse happened at , and Louis Botha in com-
mand of 7000, whilst French had 10,000 men. The way “Jacky” is catch-
ing things lately he cannot hold out much longer against us, but the
majority are to be pitied, as they are so cruelly misled by those commanding
them. We left Klerksdorp on the northern side, travelling due north. I
believe we shall be a few days out, and eventually anchor at Potchefstroom
for four or five days. The ox supply convoy (only 30 odd waggons) started
an hour before us, but our advance soon came up with them.
Trek, Eleazer, February 28th, 1901.—March at 5 a.m. After a short
trek of about eight miles we outspanned for the day about 8.30 a.m. at
Eleazer. Thompson outpost to-day. When Thompson was out this
afternoon Lord Methuen came up and was in a very chatty mood. He


told them during his conversation that we did splendid work two days ago
in destroying the Boer granary at Palmietfontein. It appears it was a race
between our column and De La Rev, as this latter Boer general had sent
waggons to take all the forage and foodstuffs away. But again our slim
general was first “on deck.” Lord Methuen also mentioned that our out-
posts and Colonel Benson’s were instrumental in preventing 300 Boers
joining Smuts’ commando, and that they had to return to the Gratz Rand.
Trek, Palmietfontein IP, March Ist, 1901. —A very wet and miserable
morning. Reveille at 4, trekking at 5.30 a.m., and did nine miles, out-
spanning at Buffels Doom gold mine. Of course, it has not been working
since the war began, but when under way employed 200 whites and 3000
Kaffirs. It is on General Cronje’s son’s farm, and was bought by a Jew
for £65,000. Captain Martin took our tent to-day, and we had to be content
with the tarpaulin stretched across the waggon; so we were comfortable
and dry. After tea went down to see Billy MTntyre. Had a sing-song
down there. Five of the signallers were “snap-shotted’’ by an A.I.R lieu-
tenant when conveying firewood to our camp. As usual, it was portion of
a Dutch farmhouse, I having a book-case, glass door frame. Had great
fun when “burring” things up, breaking glass, cracking wood, hammering,
etc.; made a great noise.
Trek, Klerksdorp, March 2nd, 1901. —We moved out from Palmiet-
fontein 11. at 5.30 a.m., and only had six miles to reach Klerksdorp. IJpon
nearing the town, Boyd, Thompson, and I made straight for the dry can-
teen, but they only had a few articles, such as matches, milk, tinned fruits,
etc. No sugar to be had at all. Cheapest “winkel” have yet struck in
South Africa. After leaving this place we were passing an English lady’s
house, when she very kindly asked us in to have a cup of coffee, an offer
which we very readily accepted. Boyd had met this kind old lady when
here before. By Jove! it was a treat to speak with an English female once
more, and she was so kind and sympathetic in her conversation. Boyd
and I arrived at the Tivoli Hotel; then I went to the P.O. and sent £1
postal note to the “Cape Times Weekly Edition” as 12 months’ sub. to their
paper, commencing from February. They are to forward same to father’s
address. This done, I rode round to the Soldiers' Institute. On my way
back to camp I passed our boys’ lines, and had a yarn to them.
Trek, Wolochins, March 4th, 1901. —Trekked out about 4.30 a.m., out-
spanning at Wolochins about 10 a.m., after a trek of 12 miles. Mac and
I commandeered two fowls, whilst Boyd brought in a sucking pig. About
eight miles out the advance of our supply convoy came suddenly upon 35
Boers, and managed to capture two, one being a native of New Zealand.
He has been out here 14 years —seven years old when he left N.Z. Before
the war he was overseer on one of the gold mines about here. Has been
on commando since October, 1899. Was not operating against us at
Hartebeestfontein. Was commandeered to fight, and is very glad his hard-
ships are over for a time. He passed the remark that “Jacky” is having
real rough times of it now. From all accounts we are trekking towards
Warrenton. This evening report about camp that Botha has surrendered


to Lord Kitchener; whether the report is true or not we do not know, but
are living in hopes it is.
\\ olverspruit, March 6th, 1901. —All day we could hear big guns. The
column “bagging in evidently. Boyd and I slept in Gosnell’s patrol tent.
Eight Boers surrendered to us this morning, and they told us of an attempt
made by De La Rev, with 1300 men and two guns, to capture Lichtenburg,
but were repulsed with 70 odd casualties, whilst 30 were captured. It
appears our men got to work with the bayonet when the Boers were in
the barbed-wire entanglements, which are all round that town. The Boers
were after the ammunition we have there. But, of course, we objected,
with the above results.
Trek, Commando Drift, March 7th, 1901. —Trekked 4.30 a.m., out-
spanning about 9.30 at Commando Drift, after doing eight miles. Boyd
and I rode along with the convoy. Have to be very careful not to knock
my hand. Trekking down the Vaal River. Boers sniping camp from
across the river during the afternoon. The column came into camp about
11.30, having marched about 15 miles from Klipfontein. As far as I could
gather from those who have been on this forced march and attack on Wol-
meranstad, the following are particulars: —Left Koedverdraai 7 p.m. on
sth; marched all night till 5 next morning, when Wolmeranstad was sur-
rounded dnd a rush made, but only half a dozen Boers to be found. The
column “anchored" till 2 p.m., when a return was made to us (the convoys),
but the Boers made such a stubborn stand on some ugly kopjes east of the
town that the column made a detour to the right, and thus avoided these
nasty kopjes. From all accounts the firing on both sides was similar to
Hartebeestfontein. About 7 p.m. they camped at a spot called Klipfontein,
out on the open veldt, where they put in a very cold night. Next morn-
ing (this morning) they marched at 5.30, reaching us at Commando Drift
as stated above. The casualties were only six wounded, which is very
remarkable, considering the heavy fire and ugly position. The expedition
was far from being a failure, for the notorious renegade Englishman, Frank
Pearson, was captured. He is a native of Manchester, and was Landdrost
of Wolmeranstad.
Trek, Bloemhof, March 10th, 1901. —Trekked out from Vlakkraal at 5
a.m., the third line of transport having trekked at 3, with strong escort of
infantry. The second line (baggage column) also, with escort, trekked at
5 a.m. The column, with first line of transports (ammunition column),
trekked about 5, and marched several miles on the right flank of the
second line. Ontspanned at Bloemhof for the day about noon, having
done 12 miles. This afternoon a Boer came into camp under flag of truce,
offering to exchange Major Paget, of Paget’s Horse, for Frank Pearson,
whom we captured a few days ago. This offer was refused by Lord
Methuen. The latter is of too notorious a character to let go so easy,
although it is rough on the old major. About 2 p.m. an attempt was made
to cross the Vaal River with an empty ox waggon, but failed, as the river
is in too swollen a condition. It is the intention of the column to go to
Hopstad, in the 0.R.C., to withdraw the garrison from there. The drifts


we have passed are unfordable. During the attempt at fording the river
it was necessary for us to bring into action a 15-pounder to disperse some
Boers who were sniping our people out of some timber. Four shots were
sufficient. The column had a little fighting to-day. The advance came
suddenly on 50 Boers in a hollow, when they made for some scrub, but our
15-pounders, pom-pom, and Maxim cleared them out. We had no casual-
ties. This evening my finger was very painful, no doubt caused by the
damp and cold atmosphere.
Trek, Kreepan, March nth, 1901. —Trekked from Bloemhof at 5.30
a.m., outspanning at Kreepan at noon, having travelled 15 miles. By way
of a change no Boers seen, consequently a holiday from fighting. Saw Dr.
Douglas this afternoon, and he changed a wooden splint for a tin scoop on
my finger. He is very gentle indeed. The ox supply convoy trekked
out at 4 p.m. towards Christiana, under escort of the third and fifth I.Y. and
guns. Started a letter to mother, as in this evening’s orders a mail closes
at Div. Headquarters, 7 p.m. to-morrow.
hourteen Streams, March 16th, 1901. —Reading papers in the morn-
ing. After lunch M‘Cadden, Walker, and I took a stroll across the river
per temporal rail bridge to the dry canteen at Warrenton camp, and pur-
chased a few stores, etc. The large iron bridge is not repaired since the
Boers blew up both ends last May, so there is a temporary line running
across on a temporary bridge half a mile below. Lord Methuen very ill
to-day with enteric. No one wishes him a speedy recovery more than I do.
hourteen Streams, March 17th, 1901. —Had another mail to-day. Two
home letters. Church parade at 9.30, but, sad to say, I never got up in
time. Having a grand spell. Down to see the boys to-day. Answered
Ashley's letter this evening. Lord Methuen not any better to-day.
Fourteen Streams, March 24th, 1901. —Sunday. A very wet day and
night. Church parade in the morning, and reading in the afternoon. In
the evening went down and had a yarn to the boys. The third, fifth, and
tenth I.Y. regiments shifted camp across the Vaal River to Warrenton,
which is just opposite this camp. The waggons were trucked and taken
over per rail, whilst the horses and mules were led across the railway bridge,
dhe river is still too high to allow of using the drift. All the column moves
across.
Fourteen Streams, March 25th, 1901.—A perfect day. Signalling
practice in the morning. Went to show Dr. Douglas my broken finger,
and he took the splints off. Very tender and sore now. Then I went to
give the boys a look up.
hourteen Streams and Warrenton, March 26th, 1901. —Immediately
after breakfast started to pack up, and had waggon up at railway station by
10 a.m. After putting the waggon on the truck we led our horses and
mules across the railway bridge. During this risky operation Trooper
Jack Ryan, of the A.I.R. (batman on Lord Errol's staff) was accidentally
knocked off the bridge by the two horses he was leading and drowned. We
could see him battling with the surging water for 300 yards ; then he dis-
appeared. Could find no trace of his body. Dick Walker and I rode


half a mile down the left bank of the river, but could see nothing. During
this I gave my broken finger a nasty knock whilst getting on “Snowy,”
and think I broke it again. I bound it up. After hours of waiting about,
we got the waggon off the rail-truck, and got settled down in camp just on
nightfall. As I had no dinner, was able to do justice to my tea. C.B.R.
and Headquarters also came across to-day, so the whole column is over
now. We commandeered about 500 horses, 600 head of cattle, 1000
sheep (killed 400, too much trouble driving them in), six Cape carts, two
waggons, and a good number of refugees. I was with the advance to-day.
We reached camp at about 4.30 p.m. at Boesmansput, so had been in the
saddle 11 hours, and must have travelled 25 miles. Had a nasty headache
upon reaching camp. The Boers we were engaging had been driven ahead
by the Kimberley column, and were 600 strong, but split up into three
parties. A few Boers were amongst the refugees. We were close to
Swartzkoppiefontein, 10 miles from Boshof, and the camp was eight miles
off Christiana. The convoys trekked about 15 miles, outspanning about
midday. birst time on duty since my finger broken. It has set crooked,
so very awkward.
Trek, Leeuwfontein, March 30th, 1901. —A fine day. (9 p.m., 31st
March—Was interrupted in writing to-day’s diary by a Boer attack on the
camp ; bullets cracking overhead like whips.) Marched at 5.30 a.m., out-
spanning about 11.30 at Leeuwfontein, after doing about 10 miles. About
three miles from camp the right screen was fired on, and an hour afterwards
a squadron of A.l.R.’s had a lively time from about 300 Boers who were in
a good position on a rocky bluff on the right flank. They were sent to
drive in a mob of sheep, but met with such a determined resistance that a
pom-pom and a i6-pounder were sent out, which very quickly put “Jacky”
to the right-about. His sheep were secured by us. About 3in the after-
noon the Boers attacked our eastern outposts, when the third regiment,
1.Y., and a 15-pounder smartly turned out and drove them back, with
considerable loss to the enemy, as several riderless horses were seen to
gallop away on the veldt. Three of the I.Y. were wounded. Again to-
day I was with the advance. Did some looting on a small scale just before
outspanning. This morning the refugees’ horses and cattle were sent into
Christiana, under escort of 30 of the third I.Y. and 50 N. Lancs. Dis-
tance, eight miles.
Trek, Steenbokspan, March 31st, 1901. —A very hot but splendid day
and moonlight evening. Reveille at 4, and marching at 5.30 a.m. Ont-
spanned at 2 p.m., after a tedious trek of about 18 miles. During the
march a few shots were fired at our left screen (C.8.R.). About 9 p.m.
was in the hut, just starting to write up yesterday’s diary, when I was inter-
rupted by hearing “Pint!” “crack “crack !” overhead, caused by the Boers
attacking camp. We signallers made a rush for our rifles and bandoliers ;
then advanced in open order to the front of our lines (as usual, camped
on edge of the camp), under (our) Captain Martin, where we laid down in
the long grass and waited for further developments. When the firing first
commenced all lights and fires were extinguished immediately, and an alarm
shot fired by one of the pom-poms. Then our men advanced on foot to


the quarter whence the attack came from. The sharp, metallic ring of our
Lee-Enfield rifles plainly showed that “Jacky” was seen in full retreat.
About 10 things were quiet again, with the outposts doubled all round
camp. It was really praiseworthy to notice how smartly and quickly all
hands fell in to defend the camp, to the accompaniment of the so-much-
heard “ping-pong” of the Mausers. No confusion noticeable anywhere.
Subsequent events proved that this attack was made to the north-east of
camp, whilst some Boers were driving off 380 cattle, which we have been
picking up each day, and were in kraals to the south of the camp. Our
casualties from this night were one native killed, one officer (Captain Bates,
fifth 1.Y.) and four men wounded (one since died, belonging to fifth Fusi-
liers), and one native wounded; total, seven casualties. We considered it
very rude and ungentlemanly of “Jacky” to disturb our rest, especially on
a Sunday night. S.M. Gardiner and Farrier-Sergeant Leete under arrest,
pending a court-martial, for fighting in camp. The former charged with
fighting in camp and creating a brawl, whilst the latter is charged with
striking a superior officer. The O.C. (Colonel von Donop), C.8.R., held
a preliminary enquiry on the subject. When the party of A.I.R. went
out to bring in the sheep on the right flank 200 Boers chased them, but
they galloped for cover and poured in a rattling volley, with the result that
several saddles were emptied, and the rest ran away.
Irek, Groot Ganna Pan, April 2nd, 1901. —Put in a sleepy morning.
Packed up and trekked at 3.30 a.m., and did six miles in a sou'-easterly
direction, outspanning at Groot Ganna Pan. The rest of the column
came out from Hoopstad, and picked us up at nightfall, where we camped.
It was very late before we got settled down, as a long convoy now, of refu-
gees from Hoopstad. The garrison was withdrawn, which consisted of
600 odd men and two guns of the 9th battery, R.A.; four companies of
third battalion, 5.W.8.; and 160 mounted men, belonging to fifth Fusiliers,
M.1., Berkshire M.1., and the two 15-pounders of ninth R.A. The former
have been there since May 17th last, while artillery have been eight months.
1 hey have had no tobacco for four months, clothes in rags, sniped at
almost every day, and downright glad to leave. About 35 Dutch refugees’
families were also brought away; iq.ooolb. bully beef, large quantities of
beef, jam, etc., were burnt. This column has 2250 men available for the
firing line now.
Boesmansput, April 5, 1901. —Ox convoy and baggage trekked
same style as yesterday, whilst we started off in a westerly direction for
about seven miles, then suddenly turned and marched back to where we
had just left, and caught our friends’ looking over our last camping
ground. They were chased out, then our five 15-pounders and pom-poms
opened fire on them as they galloped away across the open veldt. The
guns were in a splendid position, on a high ridge. The Boers made for a
wooded knoll, but the five guns pelted about 150 shells at them, so they
retired sou’-west. We then right-wheeled and came on into camp at
Boesmansput, which place we reached about noon. The convoys had done
only 10 miles, and had outspanned. About 4 p.m. a Dutchman came in


with a white flag to tell us one of our men (trooper of the third 1.Y.) was
left behind wounded. An ambulance waggon was immediately sent after
him. It was exceedingly good of the Boers performing this kind act, so
there are a few humane-hearted men with them yet. To-day was Good
Friday—second I have spent in South Africa now.
Warrenton, April 9th, 1901. —Quite a welcome sight to see our general,
Lord Methuen, walking about camp again. He has just recovered from a
slight attack of enteric, and has been to Kimberley.
Warrenton, April 10th, 1901. —A fine day. During the day I answered
A.R.’s letter. Reading other part of the day and evening.
Warrenton, April nth, 1901. —A beautiful day. Helio practice in the
morning. Reading in the afternoon. Duncan and I were across yarning
to Rowlands on his Mafeking siege experiences.
Warrenton, April 12th, 1901. —Reading all day. After tea I took a
walk round the C.B.R. lines and had a yarn to Goucher on the wire that
reached headquarters on the old Australian Bushmen returning home at
the end of the month. All hands in high spirits, naturally.
Warrenton, April 15th, 1901. —Walker, Thompson, Austin, and I went
for a swim in the Vaal this morning. Reading rest of day and evening.
It’s right enough, we are off home shortly! The fifth and tenth 1.Y.,
along with about 600 new 1.Y., went five miles out to near Content Station
for better grazing, also for new I.Y. to be taught riding and shooting
under Colonel Wallack.
Warrenton, April 14th, 1901. —Another fine day. Church parade,
9.30 a.m. Loafing and reading rest of day and evening. C.B.R. in high
spirits at prospect of an early return home. Hurrah!
After breakfast camp was shifted across railway line, western side, to
between the large water tanks and the Warrenton railway station. The
C.B.R. did not move, as they entrain south on Wednesday. After dinner
I went across to see Lieutenant Boyes, and was just too late to hear Lord
Methuen address and bid them good-bye. The following appeared in
Divisional Orders this evening:—l. “The following extracts from Army-
Orders, South Africa, are published:—No. lof April 3rd, 1901. Gallantry
in action. The undermentioned sergeants have been brought to special
notice of the General Commander-in-Chief: —
Tasmanian Bushmen (146), Sergeant G. Kemsley; Ist N. Lancs. Reg,
(2566), Sergeant Hodgson.—Hartebeestfontein, February 28th, 1901.
X. Reg., 1.Y., (4891), Sergeant E. O. Rice.—Wolmerastad, March
6th, 1901.
HI. All troops of the following Australian contingents will entrain on
the 17th April for Capetown, there to embark for Australia:—South Aus-
tralian Bushmen, who came out under Captain Hubbe; Victorian Bushmen,
who came out under Captain Dobbin; Queensland Bushmen, who came
out under Major Tunbridge; West Australian Bushmen, who came out
under Major Vials; New South Wales Bushmen, who came out under
Colonel Airey.


The reason that our boys are not mentioned is that they are away
escorting a convoy, Vrybnrg to Kuruman (90 miles), so unable to entrain
south on the date mentioned in D.O. They will not be back till the end
of the month. The C.B.R. gave their horses in this morning.
Warrenton, April 16th, 1901. —All the Busbies in high spirits; all shav-
ing beards off, etc. Colonel von Donop returned from Capetown this
morning. He has been down battling for our Rhodesian pay. It’s not
settled yet, and has gone to the War Office for decision. He fell all hands
in this afternoon, and addressed them, besides ordering a nip of whisky all
round. Billy Baker had tea with us this evening—the last before leaving
the column.
Warrenton, April 18th, 1901. —“Brigadier-General the Earl of Errol
regrets that the time has come when he must say good-bye to the Mounted
Brigade. He wishes to take this opportunity of thanking all ranks for the
cheerful manner in which they have carried out his orders during the time
they have been under his command, and to express his admiration of the
way in which they have behaved on all occasions, both in camp and in the
field.”
Warrenton, April 19th, 1901. —The following appeared in Divisional
Orders this morning;—“ The following terms are offered to oversea
Colonials in South Africa. All corporals and privates to be promoted
sergeants, if recommended by O.C.'s. All sergeants to be promoted lieu-
tenants, and all officers to be given a step in rank if recommended by their
O.C. The pay for all ranks to be on the scale of S.A. Irregular Forces.
Officers, N.C.O.’s, and men will be posted to their respective colonies as far
as possible, and will be borne in excess of establishment until absorbed.”
\\ arrenton, April 20th, 1901. —In Divisional Orders this evening:—“ll.
The names of any men of the following contingents of Bushmen are to be
communicated to this office: —N.S.W. First Bushmen, Third Contingent of
\ ictorian Bushmen, Cameron Scouts, Queensland Bushmen, South Aus-
tralian Bushmen, West Australian Bushmen." No Tasmanians mentioned
again. Had two letters from home to-day, besides several papers. 1
answered Ray Perkins’s letter to-day.
Warrenton, April 22. 1901. —Captain Martin handed me, when leaving,
the following letter:—“ Private H. H. Facy, Second Tasmanian Contingent,
has been with me as a Brigade Signaller for several months. His conduct
has been highly satisfactory, and the signalling work performed by him in
the field excellent. I have great pleasure in recommending Private Facy
as being strictly sober, honest, smart, and a good signaller.—(Signed)
Montagu Martin, Captain, Signalling Officer, Earl of Errol’s Brigade, First
Division F.F..” Before dinner Teddie Adams, Peter Kerr, and I went
down to the Vaal for a swim.
Warrenton, April 26th, 1901. —Reading most of the day and evening.
Wrote a few lines to M‘lntyre at Vrybnrg, and then walked to the station,
and gave same to M‘Cadden, Signallers, to leave as he passes; for the Sig-
nallers left for Mafeking during the afternoon. I explained to MTntyre


Colonel \\ . s proposal of us Tassies staying out longer.—“Hackhona
meenei.”
Warrenton, April 27th, 1901. —A fine day. Reading and loafing all
day. Nothing particular to note. [Alas, our faithful chronicler is getting
spent out!]
Warrenton, May Ist, 1901.—Johnson and I took a stroll up to the
railway station and saw a Mrs. Cox, of Kimberley (one of the ladies we
visited last night). We also had an interesting conversation with a Mrs.
Markstahler (another of the ladies we met last night). Had great “chiak-
ing about the “Young W idowA About 9.30 p.m. we had our equilibrium
disturbed in a somewhat startling and strange manner. We had just
blown out the candle, when we heard (as we thought) the report of firearms
towards the A.S.C. stores ; so, thinking “Jacky” was “on deck,” we up and
cleared out of our tent with rifle and bandolier, and discovered that there
was a large fire burning. Subsequent events proved that two Kires had
caught fire, and cartridges, tins, jam, and bully beef were exploding with
loud reports. The Dublin Militia turned out at the alarm, which their quar-
ter-guard bugler sounded, so we immediately made a run for their parade
ground for orders, when an outpost of theirs beyond their camp, seeing us
in the bright moonlight, and thinking we were Boers charging the camp
(how ridiculous, but nevertheless true!), fired several shots at us, which
were that close that it was not “beer and skittles.” S.-M. Goucher's sonor-
ous voice quieted them in this foolishness. Upon reaching their trenches
we found them lined with those d Irish Militiamen, and they kept firing
away at random, goodness knows what the object aimed at was, perhaps the
stars, or cattle straying harmlessly about the veldt.
Worcester, May 7th. 1901. —After breakfast I found a shady spot
under some gum trees, and wrote up my diary. After that I wrote to
M‘Cadden, Signaller, Mafeking. Loafing about the camp all dav. After
tea went and saw the N.S.W., S.A., W.A., Vic., and Q. Bushmen off.
Things were very rowdy indeed. Several accidents. Met a great many
of old “koppers” amongst the Victorians. There were a great many
“drunks” this morning.
Worcester, May Bth, 1901. —A very windy day, with heavy rain in the
evening. Brain, MTntyre, Dowling, and I went to the Library in the
morning. Lunch at a restaurant. Put the afternoon and evening in at the
Temperance Hotel, besides having tea there. We had plenty of music.
[A verv wise choice on such an occasion.]
Worcester, May 13th, 1901. —A cold, windy, and showery dav. Stayed
in all morning. In the afternoon MTntyre and I went to the Librarv. In
the evening, varning to Johnson, Brain, Burgess, and Lette, who are in
lodgings. We are getting sick of this waiting about for orders to embark
for home. The sooner such orders reach us the better. [“For Satan
finds,” etc.]
Train, Capetown, May 15th, 1901. —A fine day. Reached Capetown
about to a.m., and the train ran right on to the Docks to land the Irish
Yeomanry, who came from Worcester by the same train. A party of our


boys were left behind to load our dunnage on waggons, and the remainder
of us marched out to Green Point Camp. About 4 p.m. M Intyre and I
went into town by train, strolled about the streets, had tea at a in
the evening we went to the theatre to see ‘The Manoeuvres of Jane.’ Re-
turned to camp about 11.30. We Tasmanians go by the Aberdeen, which
is expected any hour. Met Jerry Gerrand, one of our LB. s, this after-
noon.
<Capetown, May 19th, 1901.— As the tug moved off we gave Lieutenant
/ dams (who is remaining in South Africa) three cheers. Upon leaching
the “Aberdeen” (White Star liner R.M.S. “Aberdeen”), out in the Bay, we
were allotted our berths for'ard in the steerage. Billy M Intyre, Fiank
Brain, and Herbert Dowling and I secured a four-berth cabin together.
There are 32 men, one W. officer, and Lieutenant Boyes in charge of us
altogether, also 34 details of the colonials on board, with Colonel Smith,
R.A., in charge of all. About 5-3° P- m - the anchor was weighed, and we
steamed out of Table Bay for “Home, sweet Home, leaving South Africa
behind. I have been in South Africa 15 months and two days, having
anchored in Table Bay in the R.M.S. “Moravian ’ (same line as this) on
February 17th, 1900. We have left behind in South Africa Mitchell, Ger-
rand, Heathcote, and Kerr, who are getting their discharges; whilst Harry
Hood and Beveridge are left behind in Kimberley and Vryburg Hospitals.
MTnnes came into Green Point Camp this morning, so too late to come with
us. We are bound direct for Melbourne, and D.V., weather permitting,
we should reach there in 20 days.
Then follows a full diary of the trip home. Before the
necessity for reduction had emphasised itself I had closed with
the following words; —We have now fairly landed our young
hero in the bosom of his family. Every line of these diaries has been tran-
scribed by me; that is to say, I have had to extract this lengthy and splendid
account from his MSS. (about one-hundredth part has been omitted), yet
it has never been tedious, owing to the interest of the story. My readers
will, I am sure, commend me for taking advantage so fully of Trooper
Facy’s notes. I started out with the intention of leaving out much, but I
found it very difficult to reject a sentence, especially after he got properly
under way. I only express my real convictions when I say that these
diaries were quite worthy of being published by themselves, and I hereby
express my indebtedness to their author for his consent to use them at my
discretion.

ARRIVAL OF SS. "HARLECH CASTLE."
(From the “Mercury.”)
PARALLEL with the custom of the ancient Romans, who were
wont to sit,
“The livelong day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass,”
was assuredly witnessed in Hobart yesterday. From the time the cabled
news was received that the “Harlech Castle” had left Melbourne with the
returning Tasmanian Contingent aboard suppressed excitement prevailed,
and as the hours, speeding slowly, were ticked off round the clock the
excitement grew and grew, until it may be fairly said that not a household in
the entire community was free from its influence. “When is she expected?”
was the constantly reiterated question, and the replies, prompted by the
“wish that is father to the thought,” were for the most part wildly im-
probable in their conjectural variety. Any and every hour from sundown
on Thursday till early dawn on Friday was named, and the note of prepara-
tion throbbed. A good many people were up all night. A good many
more were out of bed before the larks commenced to preen their feathers
and offer up their morning carols. Before the milkmen had half-finished
their rounds hurried breakfasts had been swallowed, holiday clothes donned,
bright bouquets and loyal colours mounted, and the streets dotted with


eager groups of people hurrying to the Domain or to the river steamers
advertised to meet the “Harlech Castle” transport. By 9 o'clock military,
civic, and administrative officials and magnates had put in an appearance;
office-bearers and members of the benefit societies were bestirring them-
selves in anxious preparation, and the crowd in the thoroughfares —men,
women, and children, “friends, countrymen, and lovers”—perceptibly in-
creased. The excursion steamers were crowded early, and the wharves
also, by those waiting for some definite news of the transport's movements
before investing their modest shillings. The Domain was crowded as
quickly as on regatta day, and along the route of intended procession people
were taking up positions in windows and balconies. At 9.30 the “one gun”
was fired, notifying that the “Harlech Castle” had “entered the river” forty
miles away; and patiently the people waited, satisfied for the moment with
this one gleam of comfort. At 10.30 the statement was circulated on nauti-
cal authority that the vessel had not passed Wedge Bay, and could not
possibly therefore reach Hobart before 12.30, or even later. The crowd,
still increasing, possessed their souls in patience while gazing expectantly
riverwards. At 11 a.m. Trinity bells rang out a welcome peal, which the
wind wafted to the returning heroes. It served also to cheer those ashore
who had become weary of lengthy waiting. Some discussion arose among
managing committees as to change of arrangements, and it was decided to
curtail proceedings to suit altered circumstances. Thanksgiving services
were postponed until evening; the sports at New Town were abandoned,
and it was decided that the landing of the troops should be followed close
upon by the review, Governor’s welcome, march through the streets, and
tlun straightway to the luncheon. All things considered, it was a wise
limitation. At 11.30 “two guns” banged the signal that the transport had
entered the river, and again there was a thrill of relief. “Another hour and
a half and we shall see her,” said the folks one to another, and they betook
themselves, those who had wisely provided, to sandwiches, and flasks, and
were patiently content. A good many recruited strength in a more sub-
stantial manner, and the hotels and restaurants found brisk custom. The
firing of the two guns was the signal for the Defence Forces, town and
country, mounted and infantry, and cadets, to muster on the Domain and
await orders. They made a sturdy martial array.
AN IMPOSING AQUATIC DEMONSTRATION.
SHIP WORKED BY TASMANIAN SOLDIERS.
When the ship passed Scamander on Thursday evening she was steam-
ing at the rate of nearly 10 knots, and it was then expected that she would
reach town about the time announced to the Premier by cable. The vessel,
however, did not come up to expectations, and it was 8.30 a.m. before she
hove in sight from the Mount Nelson Signal Station, which fact was con-
veyed to the public by the firing of a gun from the Queen's Battery, and it
was a few minutes after 1 o’clock before the vessel anchored off the Cattle
Jetties. From Port Phillip Heads to Hobart the average speed was only


eight knots. This, however, does not represent the vessel’s best steaming
capabilities. The delay was due chiefly to the ship being worked by a
scratch crew composed of members of the contingent. Most of the sailors
and firemen deserted at Melbourne, and it fell to the lot of the troopers to
make up the deficiency. The way they worked won the commendation of
the ship’s officers. Had it not been for the desertion of the crew, the
‘‘Har lech Castle” would have arrived several hours earlier. The Eddystone
lighthouse-keeper was signalled on Thursday afternoon to announce that
Hobart would be reached about noon next day, but the ship was too distant
for tiie signal to be made out.
The reception accorded to the soldiers on the river was well in keeping
with former similar demonstrations. Hundreds of people were early astir,
and many flocked to the wharves and Domain, and waited about in anxious
expectancy some considerable time before the vessel was signalled. Several
of the river steamers had nearly their complement of passengers aboard as
early as 7.30, though there was no sign of the expected ship. The vessels
that went down the river to meet the transport were all gaily decorated with
bunting, and the people, too, donned their colours, and many carried
miniature Union Jacks and red, white, and blue flags. Buildings about the
wharves and all vessels in port also flaunted the usual colours. The
“Nubeena” was the first steamer to leave the harbour, and she had a good
complement of passengers, many of whom had been waiting since 5.30 a.m.
The ‘‘Silver Crown” followed with a full number, mostly Bellerive residents.
This steamer, besides being gaily dressed, carried a motto on either side in
blue letters. One was, “Well done, Cameron,” and the other, “Welcome to
our boys.” The “Warrentinna,” “Taranna,” and “Ivy” left the Cove some
time later, each having a large number of people aboard. At 10.15, when
the “Nubeena” was off South Arm and the “Silver Crown” off Brown’s
River, a large steamer hove in sight from Pearson’s Point, and the excur-
sionists got ready to give vent to their pent-up feelings, when the vessel was
made out to be not the “Harlech Castle,” so anxiously looked for, but the
“ Tckoa,” from London. At about n o’clock the skipper of the “Silver
Crown” thoughtfully landed his passengers at Brown’s River, allowing them
time to assuage their hunger and thirst which the few hours on the briny
had given them. Shortly after this the troopship was met by the five
steamers above mentioned and a couple of launches. There was then much
cheering, band music, and waving of flags, etc., to which the soldiers lustily
responded.
Somewhat later the Harbourmaster boarded the “Harlech Castle,” and
lie also took off in the launch the Premier (Hon. N. E. Lewis), the Minister
of Defence (Hon. G. T. Collins), the Mayor (Lieut.-Colonel J. G. Davies),
the Master Warden of the Hobart Marine Board (Captain J. W. Evans,
M.H.A.), Captain Steward, and Mrs. Cameron, her daughter, and two sons.
The private secretary, on behalf of his Excellency the Administrator,
aho boarded the steamer and welcomed Major Cameron.
The Premier briefly addressed the soldiers and welcomed them back,
and said he would take the opportunity of speaking to them further at a
later stage.


As the ship steamed up the river to the vicinity of the Cattle Jetties she
was met by a fleet of some thirty yachts and boats of various descriptions,
most of them being gaily dressed, and from one or two of them rockets and
miniature guns were fired. The scene was now most imposing. One of
the officers aboard the “Harlech Castle” said of all the receptions in the
other ports where the steamer had called, this was the best.
The “Harlech Castle” dropped anchor off the Cattle Jetties in eight
fathoms of water. The Commandant (Colonel Legge) and his staff then
went aboard. He congratulated Major Cameron on his safe return, and
expressed the hope that he would soon recover from any lingering illness.
The troops were afterwards taken ashore in the steamer “Lottah,”
In addition to the soldiers whose names were published on the 27th ult.,
there have returned Sister Hutchinson, who did much nursing at the Cape;
and Sister Wallace, who went through the siege of Kimberley.
Troopers Judge, Smith, and Harris, who missed the steamer at Mel-
bourne, came across by the steamer Westralia, and arrived here several
hours earlier than their comrades. , ,
Trooper Ellis, of the N.S.W. Lancers, died aboard the “Harlech Castle”
on November 18 of pneumonia, and was buried at sea the same day.
THE WELCOME HOME.
A MEMORABLE DAY.
If there could be devised any test or gauge of what is known as public
enthusiasm, as it has existed in Hobart during the century or so of the city's
variable history, it probably would be found that no inconsiderable part of
the whole had been crowded into the last twelve or fourteen months. There
was considerable patriotism even at the early dawn of the actual crisis of
affairs in South Africa; steady and exultant faith in the resources of the
Empire; stern and deep indignation over the malignant injustice of that pur-
blind hierarchy whose contumacy in . persistent maltreatment of British-
subjects in the Transvaal was literally forcing the Empire into arms. But
this first glow of enthusiasm was as nothing when compared with the white-
heat of patriotic fervour which accompanied the formation of the Tasmanian
Contingent for service in the mother cause. For that cause, counting no
minor and insular cost, Tasmania freely gave her sons—the best of all she
had to give, the best she could have given in any circumstances. On the
setting forth of the contingent there was necessarily keen enthusiasm. They
were staunch, clean, stalwart fellows, excellent soldierly material, rich in
grit, and character, and spirit; and we loved them the more, the more reso-
lutely we sent them forth. They went forth in effect as champions of our
loyal faith in Britain, on the maintenance of which faith great issues hung.
Needless to say, how valiantly and earnestly these Tasmanians did their
duty! The modern soldier fights under the eye of his brother at home, as
no other soldier ever did. These Tasmanians were closely watched from
start to finish, and brother at home was never called upon to blush for any
one of them. Here, in quiet Hobart, we come into singularly close touch


for a time with the rough camp life of our champions on the veldt, and
familiarity bred no contempt for anything but the rules of bastard-Dutch
pronunciation. The men wrote letters home, and the letters frequently
found publicity and an eager audience; crude letters generally, written at a
rush by bush young fellows, with excellent digestion and imagination
proportionately fertile; letters, indeed, with the defects of their qualities, but
with that the frequently admirable qualities of their defects; letters hot and
honest, if at times exaggerated, and mostly clean and tonic as are our widths
of environing sea. The point it is sought to make (thus clumsily) is that
Tasmania, having seen her sons fight, and therefore having read the records,
is even prouder than she was at the outset. As brothers and sons we loved
them, but as they came back to us their homely qualities have an added
lustre. We have bred a batch of soldiers, and, having been put through the
fire and divers temptations, the batch comes back with no brand less admir-
able than the hall-mark.
As early as Thursday night the town was very lively and elate, with
crowds already in from the country round about. On Friday morning
Hobart woke up determined to do the thing pre-eminently well. It woke,
too, extraordinarily early. Whole families were out long before the time
when, in ordinary circumstances, the most industrious family begins to think
about its breakfast. One man, not given to the early habit, sprang out of
bed in quaking dread of the time, having that day to be down in town by
nine. It was 5.15 precisely, 5.15 of a lovely morning, with a breeze cool
as the breath of Psyche, and as fragrant, soft as the eyes of a nursing
mother. In Liverpool-street a famity was going out to the Domain—
father, mother, four children, bags and baskets, and all proper festive
■furnishings in little. The smallest toddler dropped behind the family, and
stood at pause, with a toy flag in one wee fist; a chubby dot in that wilder-
ness of pavement. For a moment the mannikin stood perplexed, trembling
towards tears. Right ahead of him beyond the family (now crying back
encouragement), the sky was still resplendent with a remnant of the panoply
of the dawn. Three-and-a-half strutted bravely forward, with the flag wav-
ing sturdily. He was .a, man going to meet the soldiers, who were, to
baby eyes, somewhere out beyond the mystery of the sunrise. A man
must not cry, however soon his family deserts him. That is why we grown
fellows so often look hack regretfully to the privileges of childhood.
At first the thronging folk confidently expected that the “Harlech
Castle” would be in by 9 o’clock. Long before that crowds of people
visited the wharves, intent on a trip down-river in some steamer setting out
to meet the troopship. But the signal gun had not been fired, and no
steamer went down-river. By 8.30 the streets were gay with strollers, all
in the garb of holiday, khaki and crimson standing out strikingly among
the more prevalent fabrics and tints of spring. On the Domain the first
family was only one in a company of hundreds. The whole stretch of park
land—from the University to the river, from Government House to the
foreshore below the battery—was dotted with groups of people, drawing to
a denser crowd around the battery itself. A few minutes later the first


signal was fired, and all men stood in a crossfire of opinions. The ship
would put on steam and be in by 10 o’clock or so —the ship was going dead
slow, and would not be in till noon. Beyond noon no conjecture seemed
to carry, and, after a little, none seemed to be decided on. In the city
meantime the Mayor had made enquiries, and ascertained that the ship
would not reach the wharf before 12.30 or so at the earliest. Obviously,
then, there must be further derangement of the programme. The thanks-
giving services in the churches were postponed till night. As to the sports
at New Town, the committee hoped till the last, and at the last the sports
were perforce abandoned. As the day drew on the crowd in the Domain
increased enormously. By 12.30 it was estimated that at least 20,000
people were afoot and waiting. By this time, too, the “Harlech Castle’
was in sight, coming seemingly with amazing slowness up the river.
Expectation grew to fever heat, particularly among the immediate relatives
of the soldiers coming home. You could pick them out now, infallibly,
these near relatives —here a father, unendurably buoyant and cheerful; and
there a mother, taking no special trouble to keep a grip on her emotions,
agitated and shaky as to mood ; here a brother, and there a sister ; and here—
well she is not a relative as a rule. And everywhere a big quiet happiness,
traceable to the fact that the boys were coming home with an excellent
record, but most directly to the fact that the boys were coming home. A
large space about the jetties, including the jetties themselves, was reserved
for relatives of the men. The mistake made previously of issuing so great
a quantity of tickets as to make the reserve insufferably crowded was not
repeated.
After what seemed to these watchers an interminable time, the
“Harlech Castle”—grey and unbeautiful, a “tramp” undisguised—anchored
in the stream abreast of the jetties. Here the private secretary went off,
and welcomed Major Cameron on behalf of the Administrator.
By this the excitement was intense. It was with difficulty, even in the
reserved enclosure, that the police cleared the jetty sufficiently to make the
landing of the men safe and practicable. On the jetty head were the
Treasurer (Hon. B. S. Bird, M.H.A.), the Minister of Lands (Hon. E.
Mulcahy, M.H.A.), the Hons. F. W. Piesse, C. E. Davies, Dr. Butler, R. S.
Scott, J. H. M‘Call, H. I. Rooke, and W. Dodery, M’s.L.C.; the Hon. Adye
Douglas, President of the Legislative Council; and the Hon. Nicholas
Brown, Speaker of the House of Assembly; Sir Edward Braddon, and
Messrs. Hartnoll, Hamilton, Burbury, Aikenhead, Fowler, Dumaresq, Wal-
duck, Best, W. H. T. Brown, Woollnough, Nicholls, Hope, and Sadler,
M’s.H.A.; and two or three prominent civil servants. At 1.40 a tender
brought off from the troopship the Premier (Hon. N. E. Lewis), the Mayor
of Hobart (Alderman J. G. Davies, M.H.A.), the Chief Secretary (Hon. G.
T. Collins, M.L.C.), and the Under-Secretary (Captain George Steward).
At 1.15 the tender came in with the returned soldiers. The scene
ensuing is rather for suggestion than description. The police were power-
less to keep the jetty clear, and as the launch drew alongside, an eager
crowd surged down to meet hem. These are the bare facts. Also, it


may be said that the meetings were for the most part of the most affection-
ate character. Beyond that it is difficult to go. Probably no men returned
from war ever received a heartier greeting or a kindlier one from the
general crowd. The greeting a returned soldier receives from his mother
is not discussable in print. Some of these fine fellows, who had passed
alert and dauntless through the shadow of death, stood unflinchingly amid
a terror only akin to all hell let loose—thought it no shame to let the tears
fall as they sprang to grasp their mothers. Moralists talk of the brutalis-
ing influences of warfare! Moralists, especially when they generalise, are
mostly fools. [I vote with the moralists. —J.B.]
Necessarily, the chief figure among the home-comers was that of Major
Cameron. When he was first noticed, standing quietly by the side of his
wife on the bridge of the tender, there was a burst of cheering typical only
of the genuine Ladysmith celebrations. Cameron has worked hard, taken
manifold perils as a part of the day’s routine, borne great responsibilities
with conspicuous distinction; all this we know here in Hobart. Only,
dazzled by the glamour of the man’s position, we have been apt to forget
the human creature concealed somewhere behind the commanding officer.
When they saw him yesterday close at hand, the public realised that Major
Cameron had suffered as well as worked. He is visibly older than he was,
gaunter; his figure has a less youthful buoyancy than it had, and his face
is more deeply lined. But he is a man of very striking presence, a soldier
every inch, with the habit of command writ large all over him. So much
of a soldier is he, in the khaki, new from Africa and serious work, that he
is a somewhat stern and incongruous figure in a crowd making patriotic
holiday.
After a few minutes’ conversation with friends, the men were drawn up
and marched to the parade-ground.
THE REVIEW.
The review was not one of the features of Friday’s programme that it
was voluntarily decided to abandon. The uncontrollable enthusiasm of
the people, however, who surged in all directions, and shattered every rank
as soon as it was formed, compelled the authorities to do so against their
inclination. Every attempt to keep a space clear proved futile. The
efforts of the police in this direction were jeered at ; the danger of being
trodden down by the troopers’ horses exercised no restraining influence on
the surging crowd. A clear space was temporarily maintained between
the lines of the members of the Defence Force, who were formed up outside
the enclosure, and extended near to the place where the carriage of his
Excellency the Administrator was drawn up. Along this space defiled the
Mayor and aldermen, followed by the Headquarters Band and the returned
troops. When opposite his Excellency the troops were halted, and imme-
diately afterwards the crowd, led away by excitement, took charge. The
clear space was immediately taken possession of by a hustling, noisy mob.
No place was sacred; no individual received consideration. His Excel-
lency and Lady Dodds, Ministers of the Crown, the Mayor and aldermen,


even the troops themselves, were unceremoniously pushed in all directions.
All means of escaping from the crush were blocked. ihe mounted
troopers and members of the police force struggled incessantly to maintain
a semblance of order; in every direction their efforts were unsuccessful.
Several ladies fainted in the confusion, and a timid doctor was noticed
sheltering himself behind the stalwart form of a Minister of the Crown.
Eventually the troops were collected together, and, headed by the Head-
quarters Band, marched towards the city boundary. The other members
of the Defence Force, followed by a drum and fife band and another brass
band, joined the procession. Members of the hire Brigade in uniform
also took part, and, preceded, followed, and surrounded by an excited and
cheering crowd, the city boundary, at which an extension archway had been
erected, was eventually reached.
The following was the parade state: —Staff, 8; Permanent Artillery,
16; Southern Tasmanian Artillery, 66; Tasmanian Engineers, 39; Mounted
Infantry, 48; First Battalion Tasmanian Infantry, 302; Southern lasma-
nian Cadets, 128. Total, 607.
The march into town was commenced amidst tremendous cheering
and (so far as the perspiring crowd was concerned) most inspiriting dis-
order. At the city boundary—the corner of Park and Liverpool streets —
the Mayor and Aldermen were waiting. Major Cameron drew up on his
grey charger, and the Mayor read an address. The Mayor read excellently,
with undisguised emotion. Major Cameron sat motionless as a statue in
bronze, with only a little flicker at the temple as indication of emotion at
all. As the Mayor finished, the crowd pressed dangerously from the rear,
and the Major mentioned that he would reply later. The address was as
follows: —
Major Cameron, Officers, and Men of the Tasmanian Contingent.
Welcome to Hobart.
It is a delightful task and a happy occasion for me when I am thus
called on, by virtue of my office as Mayor, to offer you, on behalf of the
people of Hobart, my sincere and hearty congratulations on your safe
return amongst us. The picture presented now in South Africa is a very
different one from that which lay before you when, a twelvemonth ago, you
set out on your great self-imposed, patriotic task for Queen and country,
and the cause of right and humanity in general; and, though there may be
a tendency on the part of some of the unthinking ones to minimise the
extent of what you have been able to achieve, you may well believe in the
sincerity of my every word when, on the part of the people of the Tasmanian
capital city, I tell you how your gallant deeds during the campaign in South
Africa have won for you a well-earned fame throughout the British Empire,
and have been, and are still, a source of pride to your fellow-countrymen
everywhere. Major Cameron, the promotion you have received for your
valiant acts on the battlefield, together with the ordeals and hardships you
have undergone in still more trying times of waiting for conflict, clearly
demonstrate the wisdom of the representatives of the colony in appointing
you to the command of the Tasmanian troops. I sincerely hope, with the
246


blessing of Almighty God, that you will soon be restored to health and
strength, and that your wife and children may enjoy the comfort and happi-
ness for many years to come of the presence and assistance of the husband
and father who has done so much to keep up the reputation, not only of
his native land, but also of the grand old country from which his forefathers
sprang. Though but few in number, as compared with the representatives
of other colonial possessions in South Africa, Tasmania enjoys the pride
of place in having no less than two —viz., Lieutenant Wylly and Trooper
Bisdee—who have been the recipients of special honour by having the V.C.
conferred upon them for conspicuous acts of bravery. May they each live
long to enjoy their renown, and to carry their reputation for daring deeds
in the teeth of danger into the calmer walks of everyday life in which they
will now resume their places. The gaps in your ranks are indications of
the losses we have sustained through fever and other exigencies of warfare
of many of those brave fellows who left this colony last year to take part
in the great battle for freedom. We have still to express our thankful-
ness to the Great Giver of all good things for having in His infinite mercy
spared so many others to return to those nearest and dearest to them. I
am sure yon will all join with me in the wish that Captain Riggall and the
officers and men of the Tasmanian Bushmen’s Contingent, and Captain
Lewis and the officers and men of the Tasmanian Imperial Contingent, all
of whom are away doing duty for Queen and country, may be blessed with
health and strength to successfully carry out the good work they have in
hand. May their hardships be few and their successes many; crowned by
a safe return to their adopted homes when the time comes for them to close
their service. In conclusion, let me once more give you a sincere welcome
to this citv. —J. G. Davies, Mayor of Hobart. December 7th, 1900.
THE STREETS AND DECORATIONS.
It must be a long time since so many people assembled in the streets
of Hobart at the same time as were seen yesterday. There could be no
doubt the number vastly outnumbered that which turned out on the
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Day, in 1897. A great concourse assembled in
the streets in the evening of the day that the news of the relief of Mafeking
arrived, but it was a Saturday night, and the ordinary habits of the multi-
tude on the last day of the week helped, of course, to swell the patriotic
and rejoicing crowd. Yesterday was an ordinary week-day, but cheerfully,
indeed eagerly, the whole population of the city and suburbs laid aside
business, and went forth to welcome back the Tasmanian troops from the
war. Manv of them went forth very early. It was expected that the
“Harlech Castle” would reach the harbour between 8 and 9 o’clock, and
in order to secure good places in the Queen’s Domain near the cattle jetties,
where the returning soldiers were to land, some set out from their homes in
the suburbs as early as 7 o’clock, taking with them camp stools, upon which
to await the arrival of the troopship from Melbourne. Most of the people,
however, held their souls in patience till the one gun, announcing that the
vessel was signalled, was heard. Then they estimated that the “Harlech


Castle” would reach the harbour about noon, and as the forenoon wore on,
the swollen streams of people flowed from all points of the compass towards
the Domain. Some went to the ends of the piers at the wharf, where they
had a good view of the river, and could well see the vessel, with the soldiers
on board, as it approached. But they were not many. Somewhere about
noon two guns, fired from the Queen's Battery, announced that the ship
was off the Iron Pot, and then the popular bustle and excitement was
observable everywhere. An hour later the “Harlech Castle,” with its
attendant flotilla of steamers, was seen off Castray Esplanade, heading for
the jetties in the Domain. This was the moment of supreme excitement
and expectation. At this time the streets were filled with, apparently, the
whole population of Hobart, and, of course, many visitors from the country
districts, all wearing their holiday clothes. And here a word must be said
about the weather. It was a typical summer day: warm, but after all not
uncomfortably so, free from dust, and just enough wind blowing to display
the million flags that floated over the whole settlement. There was a
wondrous display of flags, the prevailing one being the good old Union
Jack, in which the men who were about to be welcomed had been so deeply
interested during their recent absence from the colony. Standing at the
intersection of Elizabeth-street and Liverpool-street, and looking up those
main thoroughfares, beautiful vistas were seen. At various parts of the
city lines of flags were hung across the road from house to house, with gay
effect. There were inscriptions. For instance, the legend, “Honour to
the Brave,” was displayed over the Murray-street side of the General Post
Office; “Welcome Home, Tasmanians,” was the greeting from the Chief
Secretary’s office, in Murray-street; and the Treasury next door hung out
a Latin sentiment, “De Patria Bene Meritos Patria Salutat” (roughly, “The
well-deserving are saluted by their country”); “Welcome to Our Bovs”
came from a dwelling in Macquarie-street; and the Australian Natives
expressed themselves in a scroll extending across Liverpool-street, “Brave
Boys, the A.N.A. is Proud of You.” As usual on these occasions, the
house of Mr. John Mitchell, in Harrington-street, was surrounded, as it
were, by a grove of poles and flags. An American insurance company in
Macquarie-street hung out the Stars and Stripes. A shop window in Eliza-
beth-street exhibited a joke. It was a boar’s head, labelled “Kruger’s
Head.” The lads of the Boys’ Home paraded the streets in the forenoon,
carrying flags, and playing “The Old Countree.” The office of the
“Mercury” made its greeting thus:—“ Brave Sons, Welcome Home;” the
Federal flag flying close by. At the hospital all the patients who could
come to the front, and the neatly-dressed nurses who could spare a few
moments gave a welcome by their presence. But the most artistic thing
to be seen was a triumphal arch of green boughs across Liverpool-street,
close to the railway station, at the spot marking the boundary of the city,
and erected by the Tasmanian Engineers. It had a general resemblance to
a suspension bridge. On the Domain side it had the words, “Tasmania
is Proud of Her Sons,” with a portrait of Major Cameron, surrounded by
the legend, “Well Done, Cameron.” The brief but expressive word


“ Bravo!” was inscribed at either end of the arch. On the side next the
city were the words, “You Have Nobly Done Your Duty.” A ludicrous
disappointment occurred at this spot, while the great mass of the people
were awaiting the coming of the procession from the jetty. There was
a commotion in the crowd, a rush hither and thither, and presently an
avenue was formed in the multitude, and forth marched an elephant, who
with supreme indifference threaded his way through the crowd and turned
down Macquarie-street. Presently this distinguished stranger was followed
by a camel, who looked from side to side, and appeared to be more
interested in the crowd and the buildings than his huge friend a little ahead.
The animals belonged to Wirth’s Circus. It can only be added that
altogether the display made in the city was worthy the occasion, and served
to fix in the memories of those who saw it a picture which will not easily
be effaced.
Very modest preparation was made for illuminating the city during the
At a number of the smaller places of business Chinese lanterns
were visible, and the tall chimney of the Electric Light Company’s works
was illuminated with several arcs. In front of the Exhibition Building
two gas lights in a shape of a crown and star lighted that part of Macquarie-
street. There were no other forms of illumination to be seen in the princi-
pal streets, nor were there any fireworks.
THE PROCESSION.
It was to be regretted that the late hour of the day at which the
“Harlech Castle” arrived prevented the projected procession through the
streets. It was to have started from Franklin Square at n a.m., but, as
the steamer did not reach the harbour until i o’clock, it was impossible,
when more essential engagements were considered, to have the procession.
A large number of members of public bodies and friendly societies were to
have taken part in it, and, as a fact, assembled at their respective head-
quarters for the purpose. It was after 2 o’clock when the contingent
reached the triumphal arch in Liverpool-street, and the Mayor and corpora-
tion presented their address of welcome to Major Cameron. The procession
that did take place comprised the Mayor and corporation in open carriages,
members of the Defence Force, the Tasmanian Contingent, Police, and Fire
Brigade. After the presentation of the address, however, the Mayor and
corporation fell out of the procession and proceeded to the Exhibition
Building to receive the guests at the luncheon.
The Defence Force mustered strong, and with the contingent made a
respectable display. The general staff was represented by the Comman-
dant, Colonel Legge; Captain Perceval, Brigade Major; Lieutenant-
Colonel Reid, Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General; Captain Parker,
Field A.D.C. The officers of the contingent were:—Major Cameron,
commander; Captain Wallace Brown; Lieutenant F. B. Heritage; Surgeon-
Lieutenant Jamieson, and Sergeant-Major Costello; also Lieutenant J.
Walch, S.T.A., etc., special service officer with the Royal Artillery in South


Africa. 1 hen there were the following corps, with the officers named: —
Southern Tasmanian Artillery—Lieutenant-Colonel Evans; Lieutenant
horrest, Adjutant; Lieutenants Spencer and Bone. First Battalion Tas-
manian Infantry Regiment—Lieutenant-Colonel Watchorn, commanding;
Captains Hickson, R. W. T. Westbrook, Samson, Tinning, and Coldstream;
Lieutenants Chambers, Lord (Adjutant), Bennison, J. H. Johnson, E. O.
Bisdee, Simmons, and Cruickshank. Tasmanian Mounted Infantry—Cap-
tain Steward; Lieutenants Hore, D. C. Lewis, and Swan. Cadet Batta-
lion Captain W. H. Buckland, commanding; Lieutenants Snowden (Adju-
tant), Bond, Manning, and Davies. There were also in the procession
Colonel Bernard (retired) and Colonel A. H. Warner; Colonel Collins,
Launceston Artillery (Minister of Defence), not in uniform; and Captain N.
E. Lewis, Southern Tasmanian Artillery (Premier of Tasmania).
The police force on duty (many of whom were, of course, in the proces-
sion) numbered 18 troopers and 35 footmen, the former coming from the
suburbs and the country districts. The mounted officers were :—Relieving
Superintendent Cook, Superintendent Pedder (acting as marshal), Sub-
Inspectors Webster and J. Reardon. The unmounted officers were:—
Sub-Inspectors Connors, Kemp, and Mitchell. There were also six
sergeants.
Ihe route of the procession was Liverpool, Harrington, and Mac-
quarie streets, and along the way the sidewalks were crowded with people,
and the windows, balconies, and other places of observation filled with
enthusiastic spectators. The procession proceeded to the Exhibition
Building, where the contingent and others were to be entertained at
luncheon.
THE BANQUET.
I he banquet given by the Mayor and corporation, aided by the Govern-
ment, took place in the old Exhibition Building shortly before 3 o’clock,
and was a brilliant and successful function in every respect. The decoration
committee most effectively transformed the interior of the building, which
has been cleaned up and repainted, into a richly-decorated saloon, using
flags, banners, streamers, bunting, Chinese lanterns, festoon work, choice
flowers, and evergreens for the purpose, the effect being exceedingly bright
and pleasing. Among the numerous mottoes were “Home, Sweet Home,”
“Welcome to Our Boys,” with “Wylly, V.C.,” and “Bisdee, V.C.,” on
either side, then came Bobs, Kitchener, Buller, Baden-Powell, French,
Hamilton, White, and all the rest of them, writ large, not forgetting Lord
Salisbury and Air. Chamberlain. The catering was entrusted to Mr. D.
C. Haywood, who laid out the tables in superb style, the viands being
choice and varied, served a-la-Russe, and it certainly did him much credit,
winning the warm commendation of the reception committee, it being a
record luncheon in numbers for Hobart. Everything was splendidly
served, there being no hitch of any sort. At the central tables the more
distinguished guests were seated, whilst to the right and left in three
parellel lines ran the tables for the troops. The ladies of the banquet com-


mittee, consisting of Mrs. Lewis, the Mayoress (Mrs. J. G. Davies),
Mesdames A. C. Parker (hon. secretary to the ladies’ banquet committee),
E. L. Crowther, Atkins, and Henry Dobson, took entire charge of the
waiting, having to assist them, as on the occasion of the departure of the
contingents, a large number of young ladies of the city, all dressed in white,
with sailor hats, and all wearing military favours. A member of the
reception committee was stationed at the table ends, to aid in giving general
directions, and the waiting was ample, the young ladies being most assidu-
ous in their efforts in supplying everybody. Miss Cowell, of New Town,
sent 100 choice buttonholes for distribution among the returned troops,
which they all received with apparent pleasure. Mr. J. W. Beattie, from
the band gallery, took a photograph of the gathering, a copy of which will
be reproduced in the “ Tasmanian Mail,” and will certainly prove to be a
historic picture. The reception committee were:—The Mayor, aldermen,
and Town Clerk, Archdeacon Whitington, Messrs. J. W. Evans, M.H.A.,
J. Colvin, T. Bennison, E. Grant, H. E. Packer, W. J. Watchorn, A. C.
Kellock, J. Patterson, F. R. Seager, A. E. Risby, E. Hawson, J. Gates, W.
T. 1 horpe, R. S. Milles, F. Back, J. W. Israel, W. J. J. Reynolds, and T.
Baron; and they did their work well.
Upon the arrival of Major Cameron and his heroes they received a
tremendous ovation from the company already assembled, including the
young ladies in white, who frantically cheered and waved their handker-
chiefs. The men were accompanied by some of their friends, and were
evidently much impressed by the character of the reception. There was a
bronzed, travel-stained look about their faces, and, whilst some bore the
appearance of having suffered much in various ways, the majority looked
stronger and more robust than their friends expected to find them. They
said they had all “picked up a lot” on the voyage. Major Cameron, who
has been twice wounded, and has endured hardships at the hands of the
Boers, who took him prisoner, looks a much thinner man than when he
took his departure for South Africa last year at the head of his contingent.
But whilst he was speaking it was evident that his indomitable spirit is
unaltered, his voice being clearly heard all over the building in sharp,
measured tones. There was, however, a care-worn look about his features.
After the returned soldiers, members of the Tasmanian Defence
Forces, numbering some hundreds, had filed in, and just as every seat was
being occupied, Nurses Wallace (who was in Kimberley during the siege)
and Hutchinson were escorted to seats, and received special recognition.
The Mayor (Alderman J. G. Davies, M.H.A.) presided, having on his
left Mrs. Major Cameron, and on his right Lady Dodds; next to Mrs.
Cameron sat his Excellency the Administrator (Sir John Dodds, K.C.M.G.),
and next to Lady Dodds, on the right, Major Cameron; then Mrs. Lewis
(wife of the Premier), the Mayoress, the Premier (Hon. N. E. Lewis) in
uniform, Hon. G. T. Collins (Chief Secretary), Hon. B. S. Bird (Treasurer)
and Mrs. Bird, Hon. E. Mulcahy (Minister of Lands), the President of the
Legislative Council (Hon. Adye Douglas), the Speaker of the Assembly
(Hon. Nicholas J. Brown), Hon. F. W. Piesse, Archdeacon Whitington,


Mr. Warren Dodds (his Excellency’s private secretary), the Town Clerk

The banquet over, the Mayor ascended the rostrum and proposed the
loyal toast of “The Queen,” which was received with cheers, and the Head-
quarters Band played the first few bars of the National Anthem.
Major Cameron then ascended the rostrum, and was greeted with loud
and prolonged cheering. The cheering having subsided, he called for
order for his Excellency the Administrator to speak.
His Excellency, who was received with cheers, said;—
Major Cameron and officers and men of the contingent, —W hen the war
began in South Africa, and the British territory was invaded, the British
people throughout the world, with a determination as spontaneous as it was
unanimous and emphatic, resolved that in the struggle Great Britain should
not stand alone. (Cheers.) This was not the result of any request for
aid; it was the voluntary act of the free and unfettered communities of the
Empire, which desired to help the mother country to give to all lands,
acknowledging her influence, her own system of Government, the name of
which is freedom. (Cheers.) It was the awakening of the nation to a
higher conception, a clearer view of national and Imperial obligations. It
was engendered by a sense of justice and a passionate desire to prove the
patriotism of kinship, and it gave birth to the new Imperialism, which
involves the spirit of unity throughout the Empire. (Cheers.) It was
felt here in Australia that it must be shown to the invaders, aye, and if need
be, to the world, that even at great sacrifice British subjects intend to
protect British rights and guard the honour of the flag. (Cheers.) Aus-
tralia wished to make it clear that the sea, of which Britain is mistress, is
not that which divides, but that which unites the colonies with the mother-
land. Of this work the manhood of Tasmania claimed its share ; and you,
the chosen from many who desired to go, left these shores encouraged and
strengthened by a people’s prayer for your safe-keeping. Your courage
was so high and your devotion to duty so unselfish that we confidently
reposed in you this great trust. We charged you to guard the national
honour, and to keep inviolate the fame of your own land. In fulfilling
those duties you have done heroic deeds, and have won the respect of your
brothers in arms from across the sea, and in all the qualities of soldiers you
have proved yourselves the equals of the finest troops in the world.
(Cheers.) You have maintained discipline and borne yourselves as men
with self-respect, and we rejoice to be unaware of one single act that is a
dishonour to our Tasmanian soldiers. (Prolonged cheers.) It is no fault
of yours that you do not wear that coveted guerdon of valour which two
of your Tasmanian comrades have received. It was only lack of opportu-
nity that prevented you from doing what Lieutenant Wylly and Trooper
Bisdee have so gallantly done. They have proved what kind of men


Tasmania sent to help the nation’s cause, and we know —yes, well we know
—that if occasion had arisen, there is not a man who stands before me, not
a Tasmanian, who has worn the Queen’s uniform in South Africa who
could not have acquitted himself in such a way as to deserve to wear upon
his breast the simple yet glorious legend in bronze, “For Valour.”
(Cheers.) Right well has your brave commander, Major Cameron,
justified your pride and confidence in him. Nobly has he fought—not for
the first time—for his country’s honour. (Loud cheers.) Yes, nobly
have you all done your duty, sacredly have you kept the trust, and, in the
name of Tasmania, I give you, with exultant pride and with all my heart,
that recognition of your great services which Lord Roberts himself has
asked for on your behalf. Some of your comrades will never return; they
have died a soldier's death, but remembrance of their heroism will live in
Tasmanian hearts in the years to come. They will share with you endur-
ing fame. (Cheers.) But, although we mourn the loss of our honoured
dead, we feel that the sacrifice has not been in vain, for it is a glory to be
sprung from a British race, and a proud privilege to take part in our
nation’s mission of justice, civilisation, and peace. (Cheers.) We are
impressed with the truth of those splendid lines: —
“Oh, England, shouldst thou one day fall,
Shattered in ruins by some Titan foe,
Justice were thenceforth weaker throughout all
The world, and Truth less passionately free,
And God the poorer for thine overthrow.”
(Cheers.) The recognition by the colonies of their obligations to the
Empire, exemplified as it is by your self-sacrifice and splendid patriotism,
has met with its due reward. Mr. Chamberlain, speaking for the people
of Great Britain, has said that, “In future we recognise in our dependencies
absolute equality of right and possession in all that we claim in regard to
ourselves.” He has further said: —“l have endeavoured to secure that
the colonies shall understand that they can depend upon us, even at the
cost of war, that wherever a British subject is, there he is protected by the
British flag, and so long as he is within his rights, so long he may believe
that where the single individual is, there is the whole force of the British
Empire.” (Cheers.) This declaration of Imperial policy by the Secretary
of State for the Colonies affects you in your character as citizens, and it is
as citizens no less than soldiers that I address you to-day. Mr. Chamber-
lain’s words convey the real significance of the desire for unity of the
Empire, to which your action has given such impelling force. Herein lies
the chief value of your services, the like of which it has never before in our
nation’s history been the glorious privilege of the colonies to render. You
have also helped to give to others the freedom which you yourselves enjoy,
and to lay the foundations of a just and lasting peace. And now in God’s
good providence you have come back to us, some bearing honourable
wounds, and all —all crowned with honour. (Cheers.) Gratefully we
thank you for your services to the state, proudly and gladly we greet you


because of the honours you have won, and lovingly we welcome you home
because you are our own. (Prolonged applause.)
Major Cameron, on rising to respond (accompanied on the rostrum by
Mrs. Cameron and the ladies of the banquet committee), was again accorded
prolonged cheers. He said; —Your Excellency, your Worship the Mayor,
ladies, gentlemen, and comrades, —This is an occasion unique in our
experience. It is the home-coming of ourselves among our friends to-day.
(Cheers.) The gracious words that your Excellency has greeted us with
on this auspicious occasion, as well as the gracious reception we have
received from you all, will long dwell in our memories and in our hearts.
(Cheers.) The spontaneity of the reception is extraordinary. We have
witnessed the reception accorded by the other colonies to their returning
contingents, but for depth of feeling, warm love, and kindliness this far
exceeds anything we have yet seen. (Prolonged cheers.) And now, on
behalf of the contingent and the men who have already returned, I tender
you our deep-felt and sincere thanks, for not only your kind expressions,
but also for the kind and loving manner in which we have been received.
(Cheers.) We do not deserve all the eulogiums showered upon us.
(Shouts of “Yes!”) We went to South Africa, as I told you at the time
we left, leaving our best behind us, but we have never hesitated or halted.
We went with the hope of being able to determinedly and quietly do our
duty. (“You have!” and cheers.) We did not aim at anything higher;
that was our ideal. We had the glorious records of the British army
before us, and we had to try in a humble way not to do as they have done,
but to try to emulate their example—(“You have done it!’’)—and we do
not consider that we deserve all that has been said in commendation of us.
You must not run away with the idea that we have been specially selected
by Providence to do what we have been doing. You, each one of you,
could do the same work as we did, and have done it better. (“No, no!”)
We want you to realise that it is a very easy thing, but a very unfortunate
thing, to try to spoil men who have simply tried to do their duty.
(Laughter.) We have come back to return to our avocations, our homes,
and our friends, and to be among our local squads, carrying with us all
these flowery compliments, and, I suppose, will be looked upon as some-
body to be emulated. (Cheers.) We have only in a humble and small
way had duties to perform, and we have performed them to the best of our
ability. (Cheers.) And now, your Excellency, I wish to conclude these
few remarks by saying that each man in the contingent realised, as your
Excellency has pointed out. that the honour of Tasmania was in our keep-
ing—(cheers)—and if you consider that that confidence was not misplaced,
we are amply rewarded. (Loud cheers.)
Hon. Adye Douglas, President of the Legislative Council, read the
resolution passed by the Council, congratulating Major Cameron. He
added that the Major and the men had shown their devotion to the colony
from which they had sprung. He was not a native of Tasmania himself,
but he should be proud of being a native of Tasmania, if he did not happen
to be a native of another part of the world. (Laughter.) He did very


heartily congratulate Major Cameron and his men on their conspicuous
achievements, and he hoped that Tasmanians would on all occasions show
by their actions that they were an integral part of the British Empire, and
worthy of that distinguished honour.
Hon. Nicholas Brown, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, said he
had too much consideration for Major Cameron and the Tasmanian Con-
tingent, as well as those who took part in welcoming them back, to repeat
the resolution agreed to by the Legislative Council. He contented himself
with handing the address of the House of Assembly to Major Cameron.
He would only say this, that 14 months ago he bade him, on behalf of the
branch of the Legislature which he represented, a cordial and hearty
farewell. Now, on behalf of the same House, he gave him and his contin-
gent a most cordial and hearty welcome home. (Applause.)
Three cheers were given for Major Cameron, and “He’s a Jolly Good
Lellow” was vigorously sung.
Major Cameron then announced to the members of the contingent the
J n £H& ernen t s made for them for the rest of the day and next morning, and
impressed on them the necessity for punctuality.
The Commandant proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the Mayor and
corporation, the committee, the ladies, and all who had taken part in pro-
moting such a splendid-banquet, and this was responded to with three loud
cheers from the military.
The Mayor thanked the Commandant and the forces for the
compliment. He was very proud to have had the honour of doing some-
thing towards the entertainment of such brave and gallant representatives
of the colony in the war, and he was sure that was the spirit which had
prompted the ladies to assist so ably. (Cheers.) The Premier and his
Government had done their share in promoting the banquet.
The proceedings then terminated, and the returned men rejoined their
friends outside.
THANKSGIVING SERVICES.
The special thanksgiving services arranged for the morning were held
at night.
St. David’s Cathedral was packed, large crowds having been patiently
waiting outside for some time before the doors were opened. A large pro-
portion of the men of the contingent professed the Anglican faith, and these
were all present in the church. The service was of a very solemn and
inspiring character. The Dean of Hobart read the prayers, which, with
the hymns, were specially appropriate to the occasion. A musical prayer
was read “for those who have fallen in the war.”
TROOPER BISDEE.
In connection with the arrival of the troops from South Africa by the
“Waiwera” yesterday, the chief surprise of the day was furnished by the


discovery of the fact that Trooper Bisdee, V.C., was on board. No
notification whatever had been given, either to the Government or the
shipping agents, as to what men were aboard; consequently the attendance
of onlookers at the wharf was not nearly so large as in ordinary circum-
stances it would have been. Had there been any previous intimation that
Trooper Bisdee was aboard the “Waiwera,” the crowd would have been,
worthy of our recent performances in that line. Bisdee was speedily
recognised by the people on the wharf, who cheered him very heartily.
Captain Steward took charge of Trooper Bisdee at the wharf, and straight-
way took him to the Minister of Defence. Mr. Collins found some very
cordial words to say; and there all official reception ended, so far as the
Government was concerned. Meantime the people take a proper interest
in the honoured young soldier, and he will be duly lionised whenever and
wherever the public sees its opening. It is rather rough on the public
when a decorated hero slips in unawares.—“ Mercury,” December 13, 1900^

THE GUERILLA WARFARE.
WITH THE TASMANIAN BUSHMEN.
MANNERS AND HABITS OF THE BOERS.
Staff-Sergeant E. C. Mitchell, of the Tasmanian Bushmen, in a letter
received at Launceston yesterday, writes from Hammond’s Kraal, under
date November 26:—Guerilla warfare continues to be carried on by the
Boers, but with daily increasing enthusiasm and success. The two most
important generals in the field of operations are Louis Botha and De Wet.
The former is apparently still hanging about Pietersburg district, which is
180 miles north of Pretoria. lam told that the nature of the soil is soft
and swampy, therefore transport riding would be next to impossible. I
think Pietersburg district is the only part of the Transvaal that has not been
occupied by Britsh troops up to date, and none of our generals appears too
anxious to undertake such a trip. The loss in trek oxen and mules would
be severe. Generals Paget and Plumer are likely to start next week. The
strength of their combined columns would be a trifle under five thousand
men, all Australians, with the exception of 800 infantry, made up of
Gordon Highlanders and Munster Fusiliers. Captain Riggall, in com-
mand of the first Tasmanian Bushmen, and along with the South Aus-
tralians, are in the Klerksdorp district under Lord Douglas. I have met
several New Zealanders who fought side by side with my mates in the
Ottoshoop district, where so many brave officers and men fell. Thev
describe Captain Riggall as a splendid man under fire, his coolness and
bravery being very noticeable. We are all waiting patiently for the end


of this prolonged struggle. Things are no more settled now than they
were three months ago. Sometimes we get encouraging news, and for
a while are quite jubilant over the position of things in general; next day
we meet a comrade with a very dull expression on his face, and at once
say, “Hullo, Jack, what are you looking so down-hearted for to-day ?
“Oh,” he replies, “all yesterday’s news has turned out to be mulgar or fairy
tales circulated by some individual who likes to cause a sensation and
relieve the monotony of camp life.” The great thunderstorms of Soutn
Africa are well known to every colonial by now. We get them almost every
second day or night. I have not seen such heavy downpours of rain in
Tasmania; it is feet here instead of inches. It is impossible for a man to
realise the pleasures of campaigning in South Africa unless he has spent
the rainy season on the veldt, with only one double blanket for his roof, and
saddle for his pillow. The sick are paraded every morning at 9 a.m.
Sometimes their number will reach a century. ihe majority suffer from
rheumatism, brought on by sleeping on damp ground; out of the remainder
the medical officers can always find a percentage of enteric and malarial
patients, who are sent straight away to the hospital. dhe absolute end
cannot be far off. Repeated reports indicate uttter want of heart and
food on the part of the enemy, and continual additions are being made to
our enormous list of prisoners, which must very soon reach seventeen
thousand. A particularly encouraging sign has been the improved attitude
of the farmers, who are evidently beginning to regard marauding bands
with a very unfriendly eye. Only a few days back two farmer burghers
brought in two armed Boers as prisoners into General Paget's camp. I
will try and forward you a few lines relating to the knowledge, manners,
and habits of the Boers, having lived amongst the Freestaters for nearly six
years in the eighties. I take every opportunity of conversing with loyal
Boers with a view of picking up their language quickly. It is impossible
to libel the Boer. If he speaks truly he must plead guilty to ignorance of
the most sublime order. He leans upon no knowledge, for education is at
a discount among the grown-up Dutch of the Transvaal. The Boers
throughout the length and breadth of the Transvaal—with exceedingly few
exceptions—really believe that they are the Chosen People, and their
brutal conduct towards the blacks who are in the South African Republic
is carried on in the belief again that those poor fellows are the wicked and
condemned Canaanites. Their ignorance proceeds from their mode of
living and their stubbornness in persisting that the finger of Providence is
over them to keep them from harm. They put aside all books and news-
papers when such things fall into their hands, which is very seldom, and
regard news and information conveyed by such means as lies. They believe
nothing in print, saving the Testament, and they believe the word of no
man but their own nationality. Their world is the Transvaal; its people
are the Chosen Ones; they can fight and beat into a shapeless heap the
warriors of any other nation (so they say), and the Boer nation is the most
powerful in the world. But the future of the rising generation is better.
Within the past few years schools have risen in the town districts, where


the manners of the Boer are taught, and his limited knowledge dispensed,
but this will improve. Where children are living up country these schools
are not of any use to them. There is no regular curriculum in the schools,
ihe Boers’ idea of the world beyond Capetown is, as I have said, incredible
for its absolute ignorance. The teachers in the new Transvaal schools are
the daughters mainly of German and Dutch immigrants. They may know
how to read and write and trace their finger over a map of South Africa,
but they know little else. The children are mainly taught reading and
writing and the geography of South Africa. The population of Pretoria,
so far as civilians are concerned, is increasing at the rate of about one per
day, and it is only a very powerful plea that procures one the coveted per-
mission to travel by rail to the capital from seaport towns. Everyone here
is looking forward to the execution of those proposals hinted at by the High
Commissioner as to stamping out this semi-guerilla warfare. The Dutch
themselves are as sick of the contest as the British, and many would be
glad to hear that the marauding bands had been put down at last. These
people can get no work to do, and their little stores of cash, laid aside for
the proverbial rainy day, are fast disappearing, while there appears to be
little prospect of their earning any money for some time to come. A
rather despondent view of the situation is now prevailing in Pretoria, and
the general impression appears to be that March will be here before the
refugees are allowed back in any appreciable number.
LORD METHUEN’S OPERATIONS.
A SUCCESSFUL MARCH.
Sergeant E. C. Mitchell, of the Tasmanian Bushmen, who are
operating with Lord Methuen’s column, writing from Klerksdorp under
date March 5, forwards the following account of Lord Methuen’s successful
march: —Lord Methuen has just completed one of the most successful
expeditions of the war, which he has performed in very quick time, after a
march of a fortnight, and fighting almost every day.
His column left Tarings on February 2, 1901, and fighting commenced
almost immediately. On the 3rd a sharp skirmish took place at Uitval’s
Kop in thick bush. The Boers laid in wait in the bush, and the troops had
to clear the position, which they did in a most gallant manner. The Boers
were in front and on the flanks in force. After some sharp fighting the
Boers retired, our loss being one South Australian killed and five Bushmen
and two South Australians wounded, among the latter being Lieutenant
Dempsey. The wounded were sent into Vryburg, and the column moved
on. The next day four Boers were captured by some of the advance
scouts, and during the night the camp was attacked, but the Boers were
beaten off without loss on our side. It is impossible to say what loss the
Boers suffered. The next day the enemy’s position was searched with
pom-pom fire, driving them out, leaving behind five waggons with women
and children, who were subsequently allowed to go. Later in the day
another lot of women and children, with waggons, were captured and sent


to Vryburg for safe keeping. On the 9th the column reached Doornbult,.
about 25 miles east of Vryburg, from whence provisions were obtained.
Our pickets were sniped all afternoon, and two native scouts were
wounded.
From thence the column marched south-east, and reached Schweizer
Renecke on the next day (10th). The Boers were in possession, and had
gone to some trouble to establish and make themselves comfortable. The
telegraph lines to Lichtenburg and Wolmaranstad had been repaired, a
Landdrost and J.P. appointed, and they w r ere pursuing the even tenor of
their way quite serenely, until our arrival upset matters somewhat. A
small force of ours was sent to work round to the north-east to co-operate
with the main column, but unfortunately did not get into the exact position
required to hem the Boers in and cut off their retreat. The Boers took
up a position on the opposite side of the Hart’s River, which was flooded,,
and awaited the attack. Our artillery opened fire and shelled them with
considerable effect, their loss being considerable. Among the killed was
a nephew of Commandant Tolle de Beer, and there were a number of
wounded also. A mounted force and a gun of ours swam the river and
cleared the position, the Boers flying eastwards.
Next day, the nth, the column marched twenty miles north-east to
Makouwspan, which was reached without incident.
At midnight the column moved on south-east to Wolmaranstad, 30
miles distant. Our scouts came in contact with a party of Boers on the
road before dawn, wounding one Boer and a horse. Commandant de
Villiers was on the left of our line of march, but did not oppose us. Before
entering the village the Boer forces worked round our left and tried to get
in ahead, but our artillery shelled them vigorously, and they cleared, after
suffering some loss, which, however, could not be ascertained. The Boers
in the village cleared out smartly, and the notorious Commander Pearson
narrowly escaped being captured. He was in a cart, and one of the horses
stuck, and our scouts were getting dangerously close, when the jibbing,
animal moved on, and, the horses being fresh, he got away. A pocket-
book belonging to him was picked up, in which was written a proclamation
purporting to be issued by Lord Roberts, offering £50,000 each for the
capture of Steyn and Kruger, £30.000 for De Wet, and other rewards for
other Boer leaders. The concoction of lies was evidently intended for
publication. Four Boers were caught, three of them Griqualand West
rebels.
We found that the prisoners held by the Boers at the place had been-
sent away the night before, accompanied by the valiant and fire-eating
officials, and were out of our reach. Among them was Major Paget, of
Paget’s Horse, and six burgher prisoners condemned to death for assisting
the British by the Boer Court recently held there.
The convoy, with infantry escort, arrived at Wolmaranstad during the-
afternoon of the 13th.


On the 14th the Boers attacked onr outposts with artillery, to which
*our guns replied. Shelling was kept up till dark, with what effect was
unknown, but next day as the column moved up eight dead Boers were
picked up. Our casualties were two of the yeomanry wounded and several
horses.
We learned afterwards that the Boer plan was to hem us in in
Wolmaranstad until General De la Rev’s commando arrived, the intention
being to capture the whole lot of us, but their courage failed them com-
pletely, and they cleared away to our front. A lot of stock was captured
here, and a number of undesirables were brought away.
The column moved out on the 15th, skirmishing going on in our front
and on the right, and four dead Boers were found in a mealie field, but it is
more than probable that many others were killed, as we had no time to
look for dead bodies. We reached Uitval, about 15 miles N.N.E., that
-day.
Next day the advance in the same direction was continued, the Boers
hanging on to our front and flanks most tenaciously, and reached Rietfon-
tein, 15 miles further,, and about 25 miles due west of Klerksdorp. Here
a party of mounted men and a couple of guns made a wide turning move-
ment to the left to intercept some waggons seen in that direction, but they
succeeded in getting away. De Villiers’s commando hung on to our right,
and there were other parties in front, and even round to the rear. Six of
our men were wounded during the day’s skirmishing. At 11 p.m. on the
16th the main column left for Paardeplaats, 20 miles north-east, thus
making a detour to get round Hartebeestfontein, where it was known the
Boers were assembled in force, and had with them a lot of their own
prisoners. Here we learned that at Brakpan, about two miles to our left,
a laager had been established, and the column moved there under cover of
a ridge till quite close to the laager. The whole lot was captured, consist-
ing of 40 odd prisoners, 40 waggons and carts, 1500 cattle, 6000 sheep and
goats.
Camped at Paardeplaats, and moved on next morning at 5 o’clock for
Haartebeestfontein, 12 miles south-east. A little in front of Haartebeest-
fontein a force of Boers fully 1500 strong was encountered in a practically
impregnable position. We had to descend from a tableland about 500 ft.
on the lower level, and the edge of the high plateau was cut up into a
series of rocky spurs, ridges, pinnacles, and rocky ravines, through which
the column had to thread its way, exposed to a front and enfilading fire
from concealed marksmen all the way. The struggle was a desperate
one, and lasted from early morning until midday. The Boers outnumbered
our fighting men two to one, and comprised detachments from the com-
mandoes of Liebenberg, Celliers, de Villiers, Vermas, Potgieter, and Tolle
de Beer, and the position is known as Haartebeestfontein Poort. A hot
rifle fire at short distance, as close as 20 yards, was kept up by both sides,
and the Boers contested every foot of the way. Two of our guns were
moved forward, and did good service at short rifle range. The Boers had
a 7-pounder Creusot gun, with which they shelled the column as it


advanced. Early in the morning the Fifth Yeomanry attacked the Boer
position on the right of the road, drove out the enemy, and held the
position. When the Boer position on the left was reached by the ienth
Imperial Yeomanry and the Victorians the enemy poured in a hail of bullets
from ridge, spur, kopje, and gorge, and the task of clearing them out
seemed almost a hopeless one. Our fellows showed extraordinary bravery,
and stuck to their work, regardless of losses, determined to win the day
or die in the attempt. The action commenced at dawn, and at to o’clock
very little progress had been made. Lord Methuen ordered up two
companies of the Loyal North Lancashires, who formed part of the convoy
guard, under Major Murray. They had to advance over an open space,
during which time several were hit, but they moved forward grandly, as if
on parade, and got to their positions, from which they poured in a deadly
fire, which soon began to weaken the enemy’s resistance, and a little after
midday the Boer fire slackened perceptibly, and eventually they cleared in
all directions. During this action the Lancs, lost severely. Lieutenant
Hewett was killed while directing his men, Lieutenant Creek was shot
dead about one hundred yards from the enemy’s position, and a colour-
sergeant, corporal, and three men were killed, and seven or eight were
wounded. The poort, or gorge, was then occupied, while the convoy and
the large flocks and herds came through.
The Boer loss could not be ascertained, but 18 dead bodies were seen,
and there is no doubt they must have lost very heavily. The Boers reck-
oned that it would be impossible for our force to drive them out, and they
had counted upon an easy victory. A Boer stated that he could scarcely
believe that such a small force of British, or in fact any force, could have
driven them out, the position having been strongly entrenched. The
column was greatly encumbered with the large number of stock and wagons,
but they were all safely got out of the veritable hell’s gate without losing
any of them. After forcing the positions large quantities of grain and
stock were captured. One thousand bags of grain were destroyed, and a
large quantity of forage. Our casualties were 34 wounded and 15 killed.
Among the wounded were Colonel Kelly, A.1.R., wounded in leg severely;
Captain J. Warwick, div. staff, severely in thigh; Captain Wilson, sth
Yeomanry, dangerously in stomach (since dead); Lieutenant Mann, V.R.,
severely; Lieutenant Molloy, 10th Yeomonry, slight.
The next day (Monday) the column rested, and on Tuesday about
noon entered Klerksdorp, with 15,000 small stock and nearly 5000 cattle.
The total casualties in the expedition were 16 killed and died of wounds,
and 43 wounded. The wounded men were placed in the local hospital
until Thursday morning, when they left by train for the Rand.
Out of 25 men of the 40th squad of 10th Yeomanry 14 were hit at
Hartbeestfontein.
On Tuesday evening the sad task of burying the dead was performed.
The bodies of the two officers and 13 men who had laid down their lives
for their country were conveyed to the Klerksdorp cemetery, followed by as
many of the troops as could be spared, the service being read by Chaplain


Lieutenant-Colonel Simms, Chaplain Captain Baordman (N.S.W.), and
Lieutenant Cell, I.Y. Four Boers who were brought in were buried at the
same time in a burial plot adjoining, Mr. Naude and Chaplain Simms
officiating.
Lord Methuen and staff remained till the close of the ceremony over
the British dead, and were also present at the interment of the Boers.
WITH LORD METHUEN’S COLUMN.
PRISONERS SHOT BY THE BOERS.
In a letter received at Launceston yesterday, Sergeant E. C. Mitchell,
of the Tasmanian Bushmen, operating with Lord Methuen’s column, writes
from Klerksdorp, under date March 7: —
Lord Methuen’s column left here on Monday last, and returned on
Friday evening, after having had a most successful patrol up the Schoon-
spruit Valley, reaching within seven miles of Ventersdorp. This valley is
very fertile, and irrigation furrows are brought all the way out of the spruit
up the valley, which is very flat at the bottom. All stores of grain and
forage found in the barns and store houses were destroyed. Sniping was
continued from off the ridges all the time we were out, but there were no
casualties on our side. In addition to the food stuff destroyed, about 1000
head of cattle and 4000 sheep were captured, also several prisoners.
The Boer refugee camp here is assuming big dimensions. The women
and children are well fed and housed in comfortable tents, and are much
betrer off than many British refugees in the colony. There are all sorts
and conditions among them —some to whom the present life, with its liberal
supply of food and good shelter, is a sort of earthly paradise; and others
who look back with regret to their well-stocked farms.
The whole community were shocked a few days ago by the news
brought in by Mrs. R. M'Lachlan, of Hartebeestfontein, of the execution
by the Boers of her husband, her father, brother-in-law, and two others (J.
R. Boyd and J. Matthews). Some two months ago these five, with W.
Ahrens, C. J. Theunissen and Mr. Savage, were condemned to death at
Wolmaranstad, for assisting the British, but it was never thought the
sentences would be carried out. In the case of five of the prisoners, this
has now been done. The judge of the court was a Mr. Douthwaite, a
Scotchman by birth, but a burgher, formerly field-cornet of Potchefstroom.
C. j. Rothman, of Klerksdorp, was State prosecutor. Whether there was
any legal assistance for the prisoners is not known. The sentences were
re "erred to the authorities at Pieterburg for confirmation. R. M'Lachlan
was bookkeeper at Wentzel and Lombard before the war, and left for Eng-
land prior to hostilities breaking out. His wife was a daughter of Mr. J,
P. Theunissen, of Lopfontein, near here, and is hardly 20 vears of age.
Some five months ago he (M'Lachlan) got to Kimberley, and, with the two
young Theunissens, made application to the authorities for permits to
return, though at this time Klerksdorp and Hartebeestfontein were in
the hands of the Boers. They could not get permits, so returned without,


leawng in a cart via Hoopstadt. They were taken prisoners soon after
entering the State, and brought to Klerksdorp, where they were allowed
out on bail until the British operations ended in the occupation of Klerks-
dorp, when all the prisoners were removed to Wolmaranstad. The charge
against JVTLachlan was that he declined to take up arms against the
British. J. R. Boyd was a British subject, and occupied M‘Lachlan’s
position when he left. His crime is understood to be that, having been
arrested on some charge and sentenced, he sent a letter to the British to
that eff( ct, but his messenger took his letter to the Boer commander
instead, atid, according to Boer ideas, this made him a spy. Theunissen
was a farmer, near Klerksdorp, and Ahrens lived on the same farm.
Matthews was a Bloemfontein man. The crime of the three last named
was that they took the oath of neutrality when the British came along, and
refused to take up arms again. These five were the men executed. They
were taken out in the veldt, and shot by men of General De la Key’s com-
mando. Ihey were all killed by the first volley, but Boyd, when he fell
into his grave showed signs of animation, and a bullet was put into his head
as he lay there. Mrs. M‘Lachlan, who was at Hartebeestfontein at the
time of the execution, or murders, which occurred on Saturday week,
February 23, arrived at Wolmaranstad on the following Monday, and had
the bodies disinterred and placed in coffins, and properly and reverently
buiied. The Boers have three more British subjects awaiting their doom.
The sentence of death was passed on them ten days ago, but De la Rev has
not yet confirmed the sentence. The commando of Klerksdorp burghers
under General Liebenburg, who took the above prisoners, were all
persona iy known to the executed and condemned men. Nicholas
Theunissen (brother of J. D.) is on the commando, yet, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, no attempt has been made to reduce the sentence.
They apparently drew the line at carrying out the sentence, and the work
was done by De la Rey s crowd, who came from another part of the
Transvaal.
March 15. —Lord Methuen's column marched into Fourteen Streams
this morning, and, from hearsay, we are to remain until the new troops
relieve us, which should be about the end of this month. It is the wish
of every man that Captain Riggall will return to the Cape in time to take
the contingent back to Tasmania.”
THE RETURNING BUSHMEN.
TO LAND AT LAUNCESTON TO-DAY.
THE RECEPTION ARRANGEMENTS.
PARADE THROUGH THE CITY.
Footballers and soldiers probably form the bulk of the passengers on
board the steamer Coogee, which is expected to moor alongside the
Launceston wharf about 10.30 this morning. The Fitzroy team, which is
coming over to play an exhibition match against this city’s football experts,
has a reputation of many years' standing, but it is doubtful whether their


many seasons of play and training have given them such an insight into
their manly sport as twelve months’ experience has revealed to their
fellow passengers, the Bushmen, in the grim game of war.
The first detachment of Tasmanian Bushmen left Hobart on the trans-
port “Atlantian” on Monday, April 5, 1900, under Colonel Airey. Two
additional contingents left subsequently at short intervals. The soldiers
returning by the “Coogee” are from all the companies sent out. The
Australian forces in the South African campaign were combined and
dissevered so often that much of their distinctness was lost. The majority
of the Tasmanians went under Sir Frederick Carrington into Rhodesia, and
put up some of the “tallest” marching and fighting records of the war.
The Bushmen have assisted during their campaign in the capture of about
17,000 sheep, 4250 head of cattle, 760 horses, 140 wagons and carts, and
have also captured over 200 prisoners. As to killed and wounded of the
enemy, these are unknown quantities. The casualties sustained by the
Bushmen have been one killed (E. R. Jacson), four wounded (Coleman,
Cowen, Douglas, and Kemsley); the last named was able to
return to active service. A very small average were troubled with
sickness of a serious nature, only two (Towers and Captain Riggall) being
ill enough to be invalided home. On July 4 the Tasmanians started from
Mafeking for Elands River with 28 wagons of provisions for Major-General
Baden-Powell at Rustenburg, arriving at Elands River on July 12. They
were prevented from continuing their march, as it was reported there were
too many Boers about. They consequently left Elands River on July 15
with 14 empty waggons for Zeerust. It was a day or two after their leaving
that the celebrated and heroic defence of Elands River commenced, in which
Sergeant- MaMr Goucher and Trooper Phelan of the Tasmanian Bushmen
took part. This, by common consent, is regarded as one of the most
brilliant incidents in the war. Sergeant-Major Goucher and Trooper
Phelan are amongst the 35 Tasmanians who are expected to land from the
“Coogee” to-day. The following list, giving the names and addresses of
the returning men, will be found useful: —
Lieutenant Boyes, Battery Point. Warrant-Officer Goucher, Hobart.

The honours conferred on the First Tasmanian Bushmen have been
numerous, and redound to the credit of the corps, and to the honour of our


tight little island. Lieutenant-Colonel Wallack receives a C.8.; Captain
A. H. Riggall receives a D.5.0.; whilst, in addition to the foregoing
Sergeants A. J. Gardiner and G. W. Kemsley, Troopers R. Chant, R.
Douglas, A. G. Hillier, and the late E. R. Jacson, have been honorably
mentioned in despatches by Lords Roberts and Kitchener.
The “Coogee” will, weather permitting, arrive at her berth about 10.30
this morning. The headquarters band of the Second Battalion will be
stationed at the landing place, and after Lieutenant-Colonel Martin, officer
commanding the headquarters’ companies, has officially welcomed the
officers and men, they will be escorted through the principal streets of the
city by the band. The destination will be the Albert Hall, where the
Mayor and Aldermen, the Military Commandant, and other prominent
citizens will address the returned Bushmen.
THE BUSHMEN’S RETURN.
WELCOMED AT LAUNCESTON.
JUNE 12, 1904.
The city was at its best yesterday, when the detachment of Bushmen,
under Lieutenant Boyes, returning after bearing a distinguished part in
the South African campaign, landed from the “Coogee” en route for Hobart.
Owing to thoughtful arrangements, made at the instance of the Chief
Secretary (Mr. G. T. Collins), the citizens were enabled to take the home-
coming warriors in hand for a day, and give them a thorough welcome on
their first setting foot on Tasmanian soil. To do this meant that the troops
should spend at least one day at Launceston. Accordingly arrangements
were made for quartering them on Wednesday night at the Metropole,
Brisbane-street, and the providing of a special train to convey them on to
the capital this morning. The Mayor and the citizens at once agreed to
make the best of the opportunity. The programme for the day included
an official welcome to the soldiers by the Mayor and Lieutenant-Colonel
Martin, officer commanding the headquarters’ companies of the Second
Battalion, a parade through the principal streets headed by the headquarters’
band, and a formal reception at the Albert Hall. After luncheon, the
attractions of the football match Fitzroy v. Northern Tasmania were free
to the troops, and in the evening they were entertained at a smoke social
in the Albert Hall by their brothers in arms of the headquarters’ companies.
The day, like its predecessor, was perfect for the purposes of an outdoor
demonstration. The keen, invigorating, winter air was happily tempered
by unclouded sunshine, and when the fogs rolled off from the river, and
revealed to the returning Bushmen the city which they had run many
chances of never seeing again, the prospect must have moved them
considerably. The soldier, of all men, must experience peculiar feelings
and sensations on returning from a foreign war to his own country.
A dense fog at the Heads delayed the “Coogee” for upwards of two
hours, but all the morning the city streets were thronged with crowds of
people, eager to take part in the public welcome to the soldiers. A timely


hint thrown out by the Mayor resulted in the majority of the buildings
being made gay with flags and bunting.
It was close upon 2 o’clock when the eager, watching crowd upon the
wharf caught sight of the “Coogee” coming slowly up the bend in the river.
As soon as she rounded into the harbour, a row of figures, clad in the
well-known khaki, were discerned in the bow, and cheering commenced
without further delay. Swarms of small boys perched upon the wharf
buildings commenced the greeting with shrill yells of delight, which were
intensified as the boat drew nearer, and the bronze-faced campaigners began
throwing cartridges ashore. As the steamer came to her moorings, the
adult portion of the crowd took up the cheering, and continued it, with
brief intervals for breath, for the full half-hour which elapsed before the
men were got ashore and marshalled behind the Garrison Band. A hurried
handshake and the passing of congratulations constituted the brief official
welcome at the wharf. The band led off towards St. John-street, to the
brisk tune of Warrant-Officer G. Harrison's adaptation of “The Australian
Tommy Atkins,” changing to “The Minstrel Boy” as they wheeled around
the Custom House corner. At this point the lady friends and families of
the contingenters joined the overwhelmed heroes, and the homely and
picturesque scenes of former military home-coming were re-enacted. The
streets were lined with spectators, and the troops proceeded amid ceaseless
volleys of cheers to Brisbane-street, whence they continued in triumph, per
George, Cameron, and Tamar streets, to the Albert Hall.
In the banqueting-room of the hall the troops became the guests of
the Mayor. Amongst those present were Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron,.
C.8., Lieutenant-Colonel Martin, Major Room, Captains Riggall, D.5.0.,
Chapman, Smith, Hawley, Croft, Heritage, Edgerton, Sadler, and Rooke;
Lieutenant Boag; Mr. C. W. Rocher (town clerk); and Alderman Wilson;
and a large number of ladies were also admitted, and were highly interested
spectators of the reception.
After the usual loyal toasts had been honored with great enthusiasm,,
the Mayor addressed a few words of welcome to Lieutenant Boyes and his
men. His Worship remarked that it gave him very great pleasure to
tender them, on behalf of the citizens, a most hearty welcome upon their
safe return home. (Cheers.) He regretted very much that the brief
notice of their arrival had not given time for more extensive preparations
to receive them, but what they had been able to do was done sincerely.
(Applause.) Well might Tasmania feel proud of the men she had sent to
fight shoulder to shoulder with the armies from every part of the British
Empire in South Africa. They had all done well. They had been honored
and praised in all quarters. From time to time the cable had forwarded
news of their deeds, showing that they had extended the name and fame of
Tasmania as it had never been carried abroad before. They had been
praised for their soldierly qualities, for their bravery, their discipline, and
general good conduct, and those were the first characteristics of good
soldiers. But, while they were welcoming the living who had come back,
they must not forget those who would never return. He felt sure that


those who had made sacrifice of their lives would never be forgotten, and
that the deepest sympathy of the people would always be accorded to their
sorrowing relatives. (Cheers.)
Colonel Martin, who was received with cheers, proposed the health
of the Bushmen, coupled with the name of Captain Riggall, D.S.O. He
also extended a warm welcome, on behalf of the military, to the returned
troops. He would not detain them long, because he knew, as soldiers,
they wanted no other encomium beyond the consciousness, which he was
sure they all possessed, that they had done their duty. (Cheers.) Ihe
true soldier wanted no other reward than that. It must be gratifying to
them to know they had done so well through the campaign. He congratu-
lated them on their splendid appearance of health. Only one of their
number, Private Jacson, had been killed in action, and he had been asked
to mention that a handsome tablet had been raised in the “Examiner" office,
the scene of his former labour in civic life. (Cheers.) They were all
heartily glad to welcome back the members of the contingent.
Captain Riggall, who was received with loud cheers, said, in response,
that, as an officer of the Bushmen, he had to thank them for the toast.
Whilst in South Africa they had never forgotten that they were Tasmanians,
and had always striven to maintain their high reputation as such established
by other contingents from the island. (Cheers.)
Lieutenant Boyes also met with a stirring reception. They had a
“good time" in South Africa, and would be ready to take up arms again
in a future war, but the warm reception they had got that day inspired
them with a desire to rest, at least until the present war had ended.
(Laughter and cheers.)
After further congratulations, the gathering broke up, the band leading
the troops to quarters, playing on the march the “Hymn of thanksgiving.”
Ihe men under Lieutenant Boyes are:—Warrant-Officer Goucher,
Quartermaster-Sergeant Smith, Sergeants Barwick, Johnson, H. Kemsley;
Corporals Rockett, Stanworth, and Tolmie; Lance-Corporal Riley; Farrier-
Sergeant-Lette; Troopers Adams, Burgess, Brain, Butler, Cox, Chant (2),
Dwyer, Dowling, Facy, Gardiner, Hillier, Hamilton, Lee, Lawson,
MTntyre, Packett, Peters, E. N. Phelan, Sweeney, Sullivan, Tolman, and
Douglas.
Sergeant Whitelaw, who left with the first contingent, and who
subsequently distinguished himself in the field by saving the life of a
comrade, came by the “Coogee" yesterday. He is now a member of the
Pretoria police force, holding official rank, and is visiting Tasmania on
furlough. He will shortly return with his wife and family to South
Africa.
THE RETURNED BUSHMEN.
WELCOMED AT HOBART.
Hobart, Thursday.—When the special train arrived this afternoon
from Launceston some thousands of persons assembled outside the
enclosure to bid the returning Bushmen a welcome, and congratulate them


on their safe return home from South Africa. The relatives and friends
having been allowed to spend a few minutes with the men on the platform,
the word to fall in was given, and promptly obeyed, when the Administrator
(Sir John Dodds) inspected the troops, and in passing, said a few kindly
words to each. Headed by the Garrison Band, the troops were marched
to the Town Hall, followed by thousands of citizens. The men were ac-
commodated with seats on the platform, and short addresses of welcome
and complimentary words of eulogy were uttered by the Mayor, the
Premier, and Chief Secretary, to which Lieutenant Boyes and Quarter-
master-Sergeant Goucher briefly responded. After partaking of refresh-
ment at the Coffee Palace, a large majority attended a thanksgiving service
at St. David’s Cathedral, where Dean Kite delivered an interesting and
eloquent address on the words “Welcome home.” To finish up, a smoke
concert was given the troops at the Town Hall, which proved a great
success.
WELCOME TO CAPTAIN RIGGALL.
A welcome social to Captain A. H. Riggall was held in the Town Hall,.
Ross, on Wednesday evening, and was an unqualified success. The hall
was crowded with an enthusiastic audience. The building was beautifully
decorated, and round the dado of the hall were the names of the members
of “D” Company who are now on their way to South Africa.
The guest of the evening was received at the hall door, and conducted
through an arch of steel, formed by bayonets of the Ross detachment,,
who were ranked up the aisle, and an arch of Union Jacks, designed by
ladies ; after which he was heartily welcomed by the officers and men of the
detachment.
Lieutenant Priestley, in a neat speech, asked the audience to give Captain
Riggall a hearty welcome. The rules of the service forbade him making
any reference to his personal bravery, but the world now knew that he had
the Distinguished Service Order (D.5.0.) conferred upon him by Earl
Roberts.
Captain Riggall, in replying, thanked the members of the detachment
and the public for their hearty welcome. He was then presented with a
handsome hunting bridle and breastplate, the presentation being made by
Captain Heritage on behalf of the Ross detachment. He was also
presented with a hunting saddle from the residents of Ross, the
presentation being made by Mr. Thomas Parramore.
Musical selections and singing were indulged in during the evening,,
and refreshments were provided by the ladies.

LETTER.
NE of the most successful of our contingents was put under the
command of a young Tasmanian with comparatively small
military experience, though of ample military enthusiasm.
Major R. C. Lewis is the second son of the late Neil Lewis, and
was born at Hobart in 1862. His elder brother, Sir Elliott
Lewis, was Premier of Tasmania during the war. The future Major was
educated at the old High School, Hobart, and followed commercial
pursuits. He joined the Southern Tasmanian Artillery at the age of 22,
and two years later, in 1886, he was promoted Lieutenant, and Captain in
1889. Eleven years later, in igoo, he was given the command of the Lirst
Imperial Bushmen, a squadron of 129 officers and men. These he
commanded through their South African experiences. While in hospital
the command devolved upon the late Lieutenant Sale (afterwards promoted
Captain). He was promoted Major in 1902, and was awarded the D.S.O.
The Major received a medal and four clasps.
There had been much disappointment among volunteers when the 52
Tasmanian Bushmen were selected, so great was the desire to go to the
front. Consequently, when Mr. Chamberlain signified his willingness to
accept and equip a further contingent of 2500 Bushmen from the
Commonwealth, there was great joy amongst our Tasmanian youth. This
contingent was to be maintained at the Imperial cost, and the various
States lost no time in giving effect to the wishes of the Imperial authorities.
“Definite preparations were commenced at Hobart about March 15.” Lrom
Major Lewis’ valuable little book “On the Veldt,” it appears that 900 men
volunteered for places, where only about 116 could be accepted.

The Bushmen embarked, April 26, in the “Manhattan.” Ihe ship was
bound for Beira, and while the Bushmen were in port there, an incident
termed “ insulting the Portuguese flag” took place. A hawker had come
aboard, and one of the troopers tendered him a sovereign in payment for
some trifle, but he contended that it was only a shilling, so the troopers
helped themselves to his stock to make up the balance of trade, and on his
retiring to his boat, pelted him with rotten potatoes. Shortly the injured
man came back in a police-boat flying the Portuguese flag, with an official
aboard. Him also they pelted, which was certainly an aggravating
circumstance. The police officer fumed in Portuguese, and, apart from his
evident sense of something dreadful, displayed in his manner, nobody was
any the wiser as to the gravity of the complication. Finally, however, the
Captain and Colonel Rowell went ashore to appease the irate and injured
officials. They were told that the killing of half-a-dozen bumboat men
would not have mattered much, but an insult to the flag was a “casus belli.”
The matter was finally settled by paying some trifling expenses, and a
profound apology being made. And so the ship was permitted to proceed
on her way to Durban. Having experienced great delays before setting
out, they at length landed at Durban, where they went into camp for a few
days, and were then ordered aboard again on the 15th June. They got
away next day for Port Elidabeth, landing on the 18th. From Port
Elizabeth the Bushmen proceeded by train to Kroonstad. The sameness
of the journey was somewhat soothed by the joy of the prospect of going
to the front. Lord Roberts had entered Pretoria, and there was a general
conviction that the war picnic was over. So it was with considerable
deligffit that the Tasmanians were started inland. The distance from the
coast to Kroonstad was 577 miles. Here part of the Regiment, who were
ahead of the Tasmanians, annexed some of the horses belonging to the
latter. Things were much mixed, and considerable resentment was
engendered—all fruitless enough in such circumstances. About 100 men
of the Regiment were left fuming behind at Kroonstad. Says Major
Lewis, “We left Hobart on the 26th April: we moved out of Kroonstad
on the 24th June. Thus we have been practically two months in going to
the front, men and horses travelling all the time.”
They were going out to escort a convoy to Lindley. Their mounts
were sadly over-burdened with impedimenta. In addition to men,
accoutrements, and ammunition, they were loaded with “blankets, great-
coats, saddle bags, heel-ropes, mess utensils ; in fact we looked more like
travelling tinkers than anything else under heaven.”
They were joined by a battery of four guns of the C.1.V., under Major
M £ Eacharn. There were 70 each of Tasmanians, W.A.’s, and S.A.’s. The
country was the rolling veldt without any kopjes. Here is the position
the first night: “Truth to tell our position was not the most comfortable
in the world ; and again our verdant innocence was to blame. There was


HIRST TASMANIAN IMPERIAL BUSHMEN’S CONTINGENT ON BOARD TROOPSHIP “MANHATTAN,” AT HOBART WHARF.


not a drop of water to be had in that part of the veldt; and the drink that
was not to be had we all very badly wanted. In onr haste at getting away
in the morning we had come away without water-carts: the fact will
furnish crying comment on onr greenness to any old campaigner. that
kind of foolishness carries its own penalty, and you soon cease to be foodsh
in any such damaging way. ... If yon want anything in South
Africa you must just hustle for it. The regular forces know that, and, as
I say, we learned it pretty soon. Meantime we squatted with parched
throats, and had various tantalising dreams: we of Hobart, of a great
mountain side where a clear rivulet meanders through the eucalyptus to a
very pretty brewery at the bottom.” (“On the Veldt”).
Next day they had their baptism of fire in a small skirmish with some
three hundred Boers. The Tasmanians had the honour of escorting the
C.I.V. guns into action ; and afterwards Wylly led a small party to drive off
some Boers who had crawled round to the right. Soon the Boers
retired, and the British—there were some Yorkshires and Ministers with
them—advanced upon their position. They found the Boer Commandant
dead and two others wounded.
At 6 o’clock next morning they continued their march, and soon heard
firing ahead. They were in a country abounding in small streams now,
and many of the “drifts” were difficult to cross, especially for the traction
engines and trucks. Soon signs of the enemy appeared, but they were
unable to stay the advance of the column, as the garrison at Bindley held
the hills near by, and co-operated with the escort. A Boer prisoner
informed them afterwards that there were about 4000 men attacking the
convoy of a little over a thousand. “About noon the boom of a distant
gun was taken by the Boers as a signal for a determined artillery attack on
the rear and left flank of the convoy. The Boers were making a very
savage attack now, and pushing it home determinedly.”
The Tasmanians were the rear screen, and in retiring the last time
were sped on the way to a bit of cover by a hail of bullets from a range of
three hundred yards. “In that short half-mile gallop eight of the
Tasmanian hordes were either killed or wounded.” “On a fair estimate of
possibilities, it seemed that we should all be bowled over, but we had yet
to learn that rifle fire is really extraordinarily harmless, all things
considered.”
In this scramble Wylly's horse fell, throwing him heavily, and got
away. Lewis, 0:1 Reegan, endeavoured to help Wylly, but his ex-hunter
was unamanageable, and went with the crowd. Wylly regained his horse
by the help of some of the men whose horses had been shot. Trooper
Littlejohn’s horse fell heavily, pinning his rider to the ground, and Farrier-
Sergeant Jim Shaw came up, dismounted, and extricated him, and “placed
him on his own horse, and then with great coolness and judgment,
combined with a very smart piece of horsemanship, brought him safely in
under that heavy fire.” Major Lewis says, this act—one among many
similar on the part of others —seems to him to be worthy of special
notice. “Trooper Bisdee and Trooper Firth went out to try and bring


Lieutenant Wylly in; but they missed him, and got back safely,” Major
Lewis, reviewing this fight after the campaign was over, writes: “Notwith-
standing the mad rush and gallop, the men were perfectly calm and cool,
and halted steadily when we took a position to stop the Boer advance.”
In their next half-mile retirement Trooper Firth was very badly wounded,
and was brought in by Trooper Angus Adams. Major Lewis’ charger had
received a wound and gradually sank. The Boers retired to laager, and
the Tasmanians’ first sharp fight was over. Bindley was reached as the
bugle was sounding the last post. But as the Boers had shelled the town
for six weeks at daybreak, the Tasmanians did not sleep till sunrise,
though “dog-tired.”
After a few days’ stay at Bindley, the Australians left as advance guard
to a convoy at Bethlehem, but for the present the Tasmanians remained
behind, and a portion went out to meet a small convoy bringing ammuni-
tion, with which was Lieutenant Perkins, having too of the 1.8.C., and
30 Tasmanians with him. “We were glad to be all together again.” Here
two Tasmanians did a smart piece of work (elsewhere noted) in getting a
despatch through to General Clements, ten miles away, during the night.
The Tasmanians picked up the convoy at noon next day. It was a
day of small fighting, and several Australians were wounded, including
Major Rose of the W.A.’s. “During the afternoon the Boers crept up a
mealic field and poured a galling fire into the 38th Battery, being afterwards
very smartly dislodged by a party of South Australians and West
Australians of the 1.8.C.” Nearer Bethlehem General Clements was
engaging the Boers. Later he junctioned with the Australians, and a
big gun of the Boers had to be located, which was done by a demonstration
in force. Next morning at daybreak the Boers sent shells whistling about
the convoy. The Yorkshires lost heavily that day in storming the kopje
where the gun was. The Tasmanians were now acting as rearguard.
In Bethlehem there were about 15,000 men camped, who had to be
fed by convoy. Here Major Lewis met an old High School boy, Bobby
Gordon, who was serving with the Gordon Highlanders, with the rank of
-Captain.
A week was spent about Bethelehem, and on the 13th July they went
out to escort a telegraph convoy some fifteen miles in the direction of
Bindley. Here Major Lewis had an illustration of the accurate range of
the Boers—in many cases previously measured. “On arriving at the ridge
1 saw a Tommy squatting placidly behind a rock. He squinted up at me
and said, ‘Don’t look over there; they’ve got the range.’ Of course my
curiosity immediately led me to look over, and in very quick time a couple
of bullets swished past so close that I could almost feel the wind of them.
I dropped down at once, and went a few yards further round. Here the
range had not been measured, and I could get my glasses to work with
more safety.”
Between Bethelehem and Twin Hills a heavy artillery duel took place,
in which the Toer guns had the great advantage of being well masked. The
Tasmanians escorted the guns into action. Major Lewis records that in


retiring to a better position he saw a Tommy knocked over by a shell. It
was the wind from the close-passing shell that did it. “He got up again
none the worse, making remarks appropriate from his point of view. Ihis
happened 20 yards or so from me; the shell passed, I suppose, four inches
or so from Tommy.”
The next move of the Tasmanians was to escort an empty convoy to
Winberg. They were the only mounted men, and had to do all the
scouting. They started with insufficient supplies, and on arriving at
Senekal were able to purchase a few stores. Nothing of interest happened
till they reached Winberg on Saturday. On Sunday it rained heavily, and
on Monday they started on the return with a full convoy, wet and dispirited.
No drink could be bought in Winberg, though Colonel Barter offered five
pounds per bottle for whiskey. The precious stuff could not be procured.
The men, however, got an issue of rum that morning.
On the 28th July they heard guns in the distance. On Monday they
arrived at Slabbert's Nek. The Yorkshires and Ministers had forced the
passage of the Nek, and had driven the Boers back. In these movements
Prinsloo had got surrounded, and had surrendered to General Hunter, with
5000 Boers, the largest capture of the war. Of the prisoners 2500 went
away with Clements in the direction of Kroonstad. General Paget had the
remaining 2500 to take to Winberg.” This surrender was on July 31, 1900.
Major Lewis was taken with the Tasmanians to help General Paget
with his prisoners into Winberg. On arrival there he got some of the
Boer horses. The prisoners were handed over to the garrison for entrain-
ment to Capetown. The Tasmanians then went by train to Smaldul,
Elandsfontein, and Pretoria, where they marched past Lord Roberts.
This march past the Commander-in-Chief was one of the most
memorable incidents in the experiences of the contingent. There had been
some delay in reaching Pretoria, and speedily on arrival a staff-officer
informed Major Lewis that they must hurry up, as Lord Roberts was
waiting. They were in poor form as regards appearance for such a review,
being unwashed, and were well begrimed from travelling in the open
trucks of a troop train. They scrambled into shape by the appointed
time. “We went 300 yards or so, and then halted for a minute while Lord
Roberts was informed that we were on our way. The great General,
accompanied by his wife and daughter, and his staff, came down to the
gate of his grounds, and at the word ‘Walk march!’ my men were off as
one man. The Tasmanians had no reason to fear the rivalry of any troops
in South Africa; but their dress and appearance gave unmistakeable
evidence that they had been on the veldt. They were not in form for
church parade. There was a variety of rig as to hats and helmets. Where
a man had lost one hat he had got another, and among us we had by this
time a very odd collection. Some of the men had handkerchiefs tied
round their trousers to keep the useful garments together. Then our
bridles were defective. In the majority of cases, the spare rein had been
converted into a sling for the rifle, as proper slings were never issued to
us. In many ways we were a most discreditable lot of nondescripts ”
(“On the Veldt,” p. 74).


Major Lewis further remarks: “1 took up my position on Lord
Roberts’s right hand, and saw the men go by. I have reason to be proud
of that march; every line perfect. The General questioned me briefly as
to the men’s health—asking where we had been, and so on. Next he
admired the horses, and asked if they were the mounts we had brought out.
I said, no : they were nearly all Boer horses. On this he complimented me
on the soldierly appearance and steadiness of the men. I took that com-
pliment at its value
Of my brief interview with Lord Roberts, nothing remains to be
recorded. Just as he had been described to us, we found him, a very
alert and wiry little man, bearing the marks of his vast responsibility. His
manner had in it everything that was admirable; you saw that his gentle
courtesy and kindliness were inbred. You have only to see Lord Roberts
once in order to understand the wealth of the soldier’s affection for him. ’
In this march past of the Tasmanians the men were followed by the
two waggons. After that came the Major’s Cape cart, “driven by a black
boy who, for the moment, fully believed himself to be the person of most
consequence in South Africa."
Passing over several months, the experiences of which are recorded
elsewhere, I come to Major Lewis’s notice of the “Warmbad affair." “On
September ist 20 of our men, under Lieutenant Wylly, assisted by 20 men
of the Army Service Corps, with Captain Brooke in charge, were out
after cattle. They got into a tight corner in very difficult country out in
the direction in which we Tasmanians had been two or three days
previously. The guide of the party, a Hollander named Cooper, was shot
through the body and taken prisoner. We got him back nine months
after at Pietersburg apparently not much the worse, although he had a
pretty rough time. Unfortunately, the losses we sustained did not end with
Cooper. Trooper Walker had his horse shot dead under him, was pinned to
the ground as the beast fell, and so became a prisoner of the Boers. At the
same time, Trooper Jeff Brown was mortally wounded, and his brother,
Corporal Brown, sustained severe injuries. Captain Brooke, Lieutenant
Wylly, Sergeant Shaw, and Trooper Willoughby were also wounded.
Troopers Ellackaby and Campbell had their horses shot. Campbell had
an extraordinarily narrow escape. A Boer bullet struck him on the
bandolier, exploding a cartridge. This served to turn the Boer bullet, and
Campbell suffered no hurt. Trooper Clark gave up his horse to
Willoughby, and took his own chance on foot with Blackaby. They got
safely into camp under cover of the darkness. Meanwhile Trooper Bisdee,
of TasmaniaI—afterwards 1 —afterwards a Lieutenant of the Fifth Contingent—succeeded
in bringing in Captain Brooke under an exceptionally heavy fire. Bisdee’s
personal risk was extreme, and the act won him his V.C. Lieutenant
Wylly also gained a V.C. in that nasty little affair. Wylly was himself
wounded, but he stayed in that fire till he got Corporal Brown into a place
of safety. Wylly subsequently covered the retreat of the patrol by using
his rifle, and was in turn helped out by Trooper Groom, who came back
for him.” Groom, one is glad to know, afterwards received the D.C.M.


“There were sad faces that night around onr camp fire, and much
speculation as to the hope of seeing some of the missing ones again, but
they struggled in one by one. Clark, who had so generously given his
horse up, wandered in presently plucking a fowl, which operation he con-
tinued while he chatted with his comrades. Clark had stayed around to
gather in that bird on the way home, and he ate her with every evidence of
satisfaction a little later.
“Trooper Walker was still among the missing, and we scarcely expected
to see him again for some time to come, but he appeared as the night wore
on. The Boers had stripped him of whatever they considered valuable,
and now sent him with a messenger inviting us to send over an ambulance
for poor Jeff Brown. We sent the ambulance; but it was stopped half
way by a Boer officer, who would not allow it to proceed. As to Brown’s
fate we were left in uncertainty until we met the guide, Cooper, at Pieters-
burg in April of the following year. Then we learned that Brown died of
his wounds the night of the capture. He was a great favourite, and his
loss was deeply regretted by every man of us.” (“On the Veldt,” pp. 96-7).
I'he main events of the First “Tibs” are recorded in Trooper Bisdee’s
notes which follow, and in letters, so that it is not necessary to make further
extracts from Major Lewis’s interesting narrative.
“The events which follow I believe you have, and should begin with
our arrival and detraining at Kroonstad. The chief item of interest there
was the fact that we had to go straight ‘on trek’ to guard a convoy taking
supplies to Bindley, although our horses had only just landed after eight
weeks’ voyage, and four days in the train. The consequence was
inevitable, that in a very short time we had practically none of our
Tasmanian horses left, and were mounted on Boer ponies captured from
Prinsloo’s surrender.”
Diary continued from June 22, 1900. —
“We eventually arrived at Kroonstad after four days’ journey, arriving
late at night, and remained in the train until daybreak next morning, when
we had to get our tents and baggage out and carry about a quarter of a
mile to where our camp was to be pitched. This long gap in the record
has been caused by my inability to get another book, and must be filled
up in detail by the letters written home, in which I have described every-
thing up to date.' [lt should be mentioned here that this diary was
written for the sake of private and family interest, and the above explana-
tion was not intended for the compiler of this record. I have, however,
thought it best to quote it.—J.B.]
“It is now six weeks since we camped at Kroonstad, but we were not
allowed to stay there long. Indeed most of the S.A.’s started off the
same day to escort a convoy, and we were obliged to boot and saddle up at
daybreak on the next day (Sunday), and started away with only a cup of
coffee, and rode one mile out of the town, and there halted for'about five
hours, expecting every minute to be orderd to start, and having had no
breakfast we were hungry. There was a great rush for horses, as only half
of them had been sent up, and consequently one troop had to remain.


Lieutenant Perkins being unwell, this lot fell to No. i troop. My horse
did not come up from Port Elizabeth on account of a running at the nose,
and several others of the best were kept also. Lieutenant Walter laid me
on to a cream pony which was wandering about the lines, and had come
from an adjoining camp (Roberts Light Horse). 1 secured him, and he
has since turned out “trumps, being one of the few that have stood the
racket. Ihere are very few of our own horses left now, and what there
are are wrecks. ihey had no chance, coming straight from off the ship
on to the train, and straight off the train on to a long march. They only
get oats when on the march, and sometimes not much of that. There is
plenty of grass about here, but it is dried up, and the horses do not care
to eat it. As soon as there is a spring they will do well with it. Our chief
occupation since our arrival at Kroonstad has been escorting convoys of
provisions from the various Government depots to where the troops are sta-
tioned, and also empty convoys, thence to the depots and back. Our first
convoy was from Kroonstad to Lindley, and turned out the most eventful
that we have experienced yet. De Wet was hovering about Lindley, and
was determined to stop it. On the third day out we were attacked at the
front, our advance guard being fired upon, but not hurt. Our squadron
was told off to escort the guns, and we were soon under fire. Almost
the first thing that happened was a bullet striking Corporal Stocker’s hand
just in front of me, and grazing the wrist passed on through the jaw of the
next horse, and was cut out of his cheek. This, and the loss of a horse,
were the only casualties as far as we were concerned, and there was one
S.A. wounded, and I think a gunner. We soon drove them back, or rather
the guns did, for we only looked on and watched on the flank. The C.I.V.
infantry did some firing under cover of the guns. The Boers lost four or
five men. We were not attacked again until the next day, about midday,
when they attacked us in the rear, and made a most determined attack. We
were rearguard on this occasion, and got the full brunt of it, being very
soon supported by the S.A.’s and W.A.'s. We managed to keep them off,
and get our convoy to Lindley safe, but had a very hot time of it on
several occasions. Once a shower of bullets hailed all round us as we
retired, and Mr. Wylly being missing, Lieutenant Sale and I turned back
to see if we could find him, his batman, Firth, following with a spare horse.
Wylly, however, had managed to get away all right, although he had a
fall, and we got it hot as we galloped back. It is astonishing that we were
not perforated. Firth got a bullet through his ribs, and was only just able
to get away, and has been away from us ever since, although he soon got
over the wound, which, however, was a near thing just touching his heart.
We arrived at Lindley on a Monday, as usual, and stopped there several
days, escorting the empty waggons back. The remainder of the squadron,
except 27, joined us before we left Lindley. Our first experience of fight-
ing was not at all what I expected. One does not see any enemy at all,
as a rule, and the artillery does most of it. We generally have to skirmish
about, or draw the enemies’ fire so as to show their whereabouts. The
Tommies get their full share, however, very often marching straight
through the firing line. Our first experince of camping out in the open


was not at all pleasant, as for the first few days we did a starve, not being
up to scouting about for ourselves, and our Quartermaster-Sergeant emg
new to his work. The frosts, too, were very severe, and the early hours
of the morning were by no means warm. It did not take us long, however,
to find out how to keep off Jack Frost, and we nearly always have a bit oi
mealie on hand, and make a fire of cow dung when wood is not available,
and manage to do fairly well. We also now have another Q.M.S. who
knows his business well.
"From Findley we went on to Bethlehem after the rest of the squadron
had joined us, driving the Boers back as we went. There was fighting
every day, but we did not get a great deal of it, being chiefly in the rear-
guard. There were several sharp engagements, and on one occasion our
guns were nearly taken owing to the escort being too far away under cover.
The C.1.V., however, averted this, but we lost several gunners. The day
before we arrived at Bethlehem we joined a force under General Clements,
who proceeded to take the town while we drew the fire elsewhere. All the
Australians, with a strong force of Yeomanry and other cavalry, made a
detour round the right flank, and got properly shelled, and retired without
casualty. It was a splendid sight to see all the horsemen (about 1000) al-
together. We remained for about a week at Bethlehem doing little except
foraging for wood and tucker, then started off one day to find where the
telegraph line had been cut. About 10 miles out we were greeted with
bullets from a kopje standing out on the plain. The Boers were completely
hidden by large stones, and although we shelled and fired at them, we were
unable to shift them, and were obliged to return home without having done
anything. The next day a larger force went out after them, but the wily
Boers expecting this had cleared. After this a general movement was
made against the Boers. The first day saw a fair amount of fighting, but
with no decisive result. Some of our men were under very heavy shell
fire, several shells falling within a few feet of them, but they were quite
unharmed. It seined as if we were specially guarded. The fighting was
continued afterwards, and the Boers were eventually surrounded near
Friesburg, but we were sent to Wynburg with an empty convoy, and back
with a full one under Colonel Barter, and by the time we had returned, the
Boers had been given 12 hours in which to surrender, and wisely surrend-
ered, 5200 of them, with 200 waggons and 11 guns. De Wet and Scheepers.
however, had cleared as usual. The journey to Wynburg and back was an
eventful one. We were chiefly in the advance guard, and in that capacity
were often able to secure a little wood, bread, and mealie, which conduces
very much to a soldier’s well-being on the road. There were farm houses
all along the road, and I noticed one especially, Clark’s farm, which was
beautifully planted out in trees, chiefly gums and wattles, Which were in a
very flourishing condition, the latter almost bursting with blossom. In
this country a few good trees are a welcome change from the everlasting
plains.
August 15. —We stayed at Slabbert’s Nek until Sunday, sth, when
we again started for Wynburg, this time to help escort the prisoners to
the train, whence they were going to Capetown, and thence to Ceylon. The}^


were very quiet all the way, except for singing songs every evening, and
sometimes also during the march, so that there was nothing exciting to
liven the march, which was as slow as a funeral, following one after the
other in single file on each flank. We arrived at Senekal on Tuesday, and
at Wynburg on Thursday, when Stocker and I paid another visit to the
widow who supplied eggs and bacon. We found ten others there, and we
fairly ate her out. On Tuesday we again set out for Smaldeel, arriving
there on Saturday afternoon in a terrible duststorm, which nearly blinded
us. Sunday, however, turned out a beautiful day, and we had a good
rest doing mending, etc. Monday, the 13th. —Left Smaldul at about 4 p.m.,
after waiting about all day since 6 a.m., putting the horses and our stores
on the train, which went about 30 miles, and then stopped for the night.
Here we found water ready and boiling, which was very welcome, and is a
regular institution at the stopping places along the line. Trains do not
run at night north of this place yet. An early start was made next morn-
ing, after a night spent in being squeezed like sardines in the Quarter-
master's tent, and we got very little sleep that night. We arrived at Kroon-
stad in good time, and stopped there for the rest of the day. From here
I forwarded a piece of empty shell to the Cape for transmission home—T
wonder if it will ever reach there—and also got a lot of O.F.S. stamps
to send home. Kroonstad is in a state of emptiness of everything except
army stores, of which there are stacks. No jam, or anything of this des-
cription, no matches, and very little sugar. I managed to get a little
at is per lb. We were transferred to an open truck to sleep and travel in,
and the night being warm, it was not at all bad. We started soon after
6 a.m. on Wednesday, and had a lovely day for our open-air travelling,
getting a good view of the surrounding country which, however, was of the
usual O.F.S. stamp. We arrived, Wednesday, August 15, at the Vaal
River just before 6 o’clock, and went on to Elandsfontein, which we reached
about 9, and stayed there the night. We camped as usual in the trucks,
but at 3 a.m. we were rudely awakened and turned out of ours, as it was
the front truck, and was being taken to Krugersdorp, while the rest of the
train was bound for Pretoria. We were very nearly taken off in it, leaving
the rest of the squadron behind. It is not half so bad sleeping in open
trucks as one would imagine, or else we have become hardened to such
trifles. We slept well, and were very loth to turn out. It would be differ-
ent, however, if a cold wind were blowing.
At Elandsfontein one begins to see the effect of the mines, things being
in a more up-to-date style. The station is well fitted up, and lighted with
electric light all through. At 3.30, being turned out of our bed, we made
some early morning tea, finding some coppers with hot water. The water,
however, took some time to boil, and we had to make a rush for the train
at last, although it really did not start until after 5 o’clock. This was said
to be about 40 miles from Pretoria, although miles are very variable here.
Friday, August 17. —Pretoria—And now we’ve marched into Pretoria.
We arrived here at about 9 a.m., not sorry to be at our journey’s end. Pre-
toria is certainly a beautiful town. People seem to have tried to make up


for the bareness of the plains by planting trees all over the town. Pines,
gums, and wattles, the latter in bloom, line the streets and gardens. 1 here
are also thickets of trees planted in about 50 acre blocks, chiefly gums,
planted at about two feet apart. They are apparently nurseries, but unfortu-
nately they have omitted to transplant them, and so they have grown up
slender and long (like our lime kiln). I expect some of the Uitlanders are
responsible for the trees.
Almost the first person I ran against here was A.H., of the First Con-
tingent. He has fallen into a good billet on account of being a good tele-
graph operator. He starts with £l5 a month, and as soon as he gets under
way he will get £2O per month. We were soon lined up from the
station, having got everything together, and marched through the town and
past Lord Roberts. I fear we did not present a very smart appearance,
but what could be expected when we had just finished a four days' journey
on open trucks. I, for one, was black. The town, like nearly all the
others, is quite empty of luxuries of life, and is just kept going by the army
supplies. We camped for a few hours just outside the town, and then
started off on horse back to a camp about 3 miles out. We were in the
rear with Mr. Wylly, and, unfortunately, missed the others, and wandered
about armed until about 8 o’clock at night, and at last camped near where
we had started, and the others came back to us all thoroughly tired.
Saturday, August 18, 1900. —All went out skirmishing yesterday look-
ing through houses, etc., several of which were burnt down on account of
containing something suspicious. Nothing else occurred until about 3
p.m., when we on the right heard shots on the left. It appears that a party
of Boers came within range of some of our left hand rear, and they had a
bit of a duel. The pom-pom guns, however, soon sent them to the right-
about. To-day we started out from camp at 8 a.m., expecting a bit of a
scrap, and it was not long before we got it. I, unfortunately, am horse
holder, having got into a No. 3, but I can hear them hard at it on the hill
in front of us, and several Boer shells have come over the hill and lobbed
not far from us. We are now N.E. of Pretoria, near the railway to Pieters-
burg.
Sunday, August 19. —We have been continuing our march about the
line. To-day we went out skirmishing to the right, and had a few shots,
but nothing much. We are now camped at a place called Waterfall
[Waterval?] where the Boers kept their prisoners. Most elaborate
arrangements had been made to prevent escape. The enclosure was fenced
with a network of barbed wire, interlaced in a most wonderful way about
seven feet high and four feet wide. Electric light was also laid on all over
the place, so that there was no darkness to aid an escape. Arriving in
camp the first sight that greeted our eyes was the mail. Letters ! Letters 1
Who can realise the value of letters until he has been cut off from all news
of home? It is the next best thing to the home-coming itself. I got a very
fair proportion, in fact I believe the largest, and read on late into the night,
drinking in the news like some one starving with thirst. They were all
very interesting, especially R's. and H's. Hope to get letters more regu-
larly now.


Monday, 20th.—Roused out early this morning, 2.30, and made a night
march, still following the line. We come into contact every day with the
Boers, but they always retire after a few shots. Sometimes they manage
to get at us at short ranges, and do some damage, but not often. One of
our men (Cooper) was badly wounded to-day. We had a bit of a scrap,
but with no casualties, except that my pony ran a nail into his foot, and is
very lame. I had to follow the waggon for the rest of the day. We
arrived in camp late.
-Tuesday, 21st. —We made only a short stage to-day, and, our men
being in the right rear, did not get any fighting. I was obliged to follow
the waggons again, my horse being very lame. \ ery steep drifts to cross
over Pinto River, or some such name, in which most of the waggons got
stuck, and had to be pulled out by a lot of tommies pulling on two long
ropes. iris caused some delay, and 1 took the opportunitv to have a good
bathe, washing my underclothes at the same time. I was obliged to puc
them on before dry, having no others with me, but being a very hot day
there was no evil remit. Got a fine feed for my hor:e out of a “green
stuff' paddock, and also caught two guinea fowl. Camped at Eland’s
River. I forgot to mention that Baden-Powell, with a lot of Colonial
Mounted Troopers, passed us yesterday, but he had no Tasmanians. The
Tasmanian Bushmen are somewhere about Zeerust, having had a very bad
time of it at Eland’s River (not the place where we camped, but further up
the river).
Wednesday.—Still following the waggon until midday, when we
arrived at a bridge on the line which had been broken down by the Boers
(called Pienar's Bridge). Here there was the remains of a fairlv large
store and hotel, which had been looted by the Boers and thoroughly gutted.
Here we heard that all the mounted men had to push forward and join
Baden-Powelhs column, which is following up the Boers, and expected to
press them hard, their horses and cattle having been reported as nearly
knocked up. Hearing that, I determined to make a desperate effort, and
be in the swim, so borrowed a horse, and with Lette started off in pursuit of
our squadron at about 4.30 p.m. We had to go a long way, and fortu-
nately picked up a scout before dark, and he accompanied us to the camp,
which we did not reach till very late. He was a most interesting com-
panion, telling us how he did the scout’ng. He knows every inch of the
country, and speaks all the languages perfectly. His work is most
exciting at times, and often dangerous. Our men were camped at a place
called Warmbad, which is famous for its hot springs, and we revelled in
delicious hot baths to our heart’s content, and for once in a way became
clean. Our squadron arrived just an hour or two too late, B.P. having
driven the Boers out of the place and away through the passes, capturing
some of their waggons, and releasing a lot of their prisoners.
Thursday, 23rd. —Did nothing much to-day except outpost duty.
Friday.—All mounted men away again after the Boers in hot purusit.
I was not able to get a mount, and my pony was still very lame, so had to
remain behind with the waggons, consoled by the thoughts of good baths
daily.

w
FIRST TASMANIAN IMPERIAL BUSHMEN’S CONTINGENT ON PARADE, HOBART.


Saturday, 25th. —Put in charge of the waggons while here, and having
an easy time of it. Splendid bath this morning, and did a good read and
some writing. I took my horse for a good feed on some Boer’s green-
stuff. Land irrigated about here, and beautiful gardens in consequence.
Sublime lime or citron trees, not sure which—wish they were oranges ! The
latter have all been taken.
Sunday.—Had a quiet day, and followed our morning service as far as
possible in the Prayer Book, which makes one feel in touch with those
at home. Had a long talk with Quarter-master-Sergeant Williams on
things in general and psychology in particular. He has evidently thought
a lot about it and on matters of religion. It is pleasant to be able to
have a talk with someone who talks sense and not obscenity. [I heartily
concur in the sentiment and in the expression of it. J.B.]
Tuesday, 28th. —Our squadron returned last night, and we got orders
to inspan and go to meet them, which we did, but had to roam about until
after two o’clock before we found a camping place.
Wednesday, August 29. —Another lazy day which, however, was
full of rumours of De Wet surrendering, and Grober also, and that Steyn
had surrendered at Pretoria. These rumours generally bring forth a
cheer, but always lacked confirmation, so that we have given up believing
them. General Baden-Powell left by train this afternoon on his way home
to England. He received an immense ovation as he went away, and told
his men that the war was nearly over, and Kruger was expected to sur-
render within 48 hours. I hope he may, but doubt it. A good alteration
was made in the mess arrangements. We were formed into seven messes
of 10 to 12 men each to do their own cooking, etc. It will work very
well.
Thursday, 30th. —Thirty-six of us went out patrolling the district.
We came across over 60 Kaffirs armed with Martinis. They all met at a
kraal, and had a great confab with the guide, which was very amusing, and
evidently so to them, for there was great hilarity over it. They are going
to bring in their rifles, and a lot of cattle and corn. No breakfast until we
came in at 4 p.m. Fairly hungry.
Saturday, August 31st. —Roused at 3 a.m., and sent out on a wild goose
chase. Like the famous Duke of York’s men, we marched up to the top
of the hill and marched back again. It appears that some Boers were
known to be in a certain house, and we were going to surprise them. Day-
light, however, came too soon and spoilt our little game.
Sunday, September Ist. —Warned last night that we should be called
at 2 a.m. to repeat the day before’s movement, but this was countermanded
during the night. I expect Boers were lying in ambush for us. Twenty of
us sent on patrol in the afternoon under Captain Brooke and Lieutenant
Wylly to secure some cattle. Had a terrible experience, which I shall
never forget. We were led through a narrow neck into a veritable death
trap. I cannot understand how the officers did not realise the danger. This
neck led into a sort of basin with steep rocky hills rising in front. They
opened fire on our five advance guardmen at short range, and then upon all


of us, and how we got away at all is most wonderful. As it was we had’
four wounded, Wylly slightly, and Sergeant G. Shaw and Willoughby and
Corporal Brown rather worse, and J. S. Brown very seriously, and the
guide also severely wounded. The two latter fell into the hands of the Boers,
and we fear they are in a critical state. The others are being attended to
by the ambulance. The bullets came round us as thick as hail, and
exploded with loud report as they struck. Captain Brooke was unhorsed.
I gave him mine, running alongside myself, as he also received a slight
wound in the leg. Corporal Brown’s horse was shot, and Wylly gave him
his horse, as he was wounded badly in the foot. Groom then picked up
Wylly on his horse, and we rode for our lives. Two men, Clark and
Blackaby lost their horses (Clark gave his to Willoughby), but managed to
evade the Boers, and arrived in camp late. Walter’s horse was shot, and
he, stopping with J. S. Brown, was captured by the Boers, who let him go to
report upon Brown’s case, and send an ambulance in. Altogether it has
been a terrible experience, and seems so utterly foolhardy to go into such
a place without scouts well out in front and good supports behind. All for
the sake of a few cattle !
Monday, September 2nd.—Heard to-day that the Commandant was
irate at Walter’s being let go, and does not intend to give up the other two-
men. Good news in one way, as they would hardly want to keep dying
men. Some of our men and the Yorkshire Yeomanry, and all Hickson’s
Horse went out to-day reconnoitring, and found the Boers in large force,
but did not engage them.
Tuesday, 3rd. —Roused at 4 a.m. All available mounted men to turn
out. We just reached the General’s quarters when the Boers sent us
greeting with several shells into the camp, rousing up the lazy ones in double
quick time. This is a new experience. They did no damage except kill
a bullock for us, which, being “meatty,” was promptly skinned for the
supply department. The Boers appear to be nearly all round us. We
dismounted amongst the scrub for some time, waiting for developments,
and about 9 a.m. we were sent down the line to escort the engines and rail-
way men, the line having been torn up, and the telegraph cut about six miles
out. The train last night was derailed, engine topsy-turvy. I believe no
one was hurt. We arrived on the scene of the accident without opposition,,
and are now guarding it whilst it is being repaired.
Wednesday, —Rest to-day. Prepared for Boers, but they were
kept in check and driven back by our friends, the guns.
Thursday, Ath.—Reveille at 4 a.m. Started patrol round by Bush Kop
at 5 a.m., arrived home at about 9.30, and rested for the remainder of the
day. Got orders to saddle up and prepare to move camp, bag and baggage
at 6 p.m., and started for an all night march.
Friday, 7th. —Marched all last night, with an hour’s rest at about mid-
night, and arrived at Pienar’s River at 6 a.m. Were glad of a rest for the
day. Very hot. Read letters received on Thursday, brought up by
Lieutenant Perkins and the rest of the men from Pretoria. Thev no sooner
arrived at Warmbath than they had to return straight back. Burburv and


Brown, and all those we left behind at Kroonstad, joined us again. Started
again at 5 p.m. for another night march.
Saturday, Bth.—Marched till 1 o’clock this morning, then had a rest for
three hours, when we were sent off again patrolling after some Boers sup-
posed to be in the vicinity. Some of our men came across two of them
and gave them a hot time, but they got away, leaving bandoliers and meat
bag. We stopped most of the afternoon at Saltpan, a large salt factory
close by a salt lake, which lay in a deep basin. It looked like a lake frozen
over. Started again at 5.30, and marched on to Waterval, which we
reached at about midnight, very tired.
Sunday, 9th. —Very glad of a rest to-day. Shifted camp to a cleaner
place, and pitched our tents. We scarcely knew ourselves in tents, and in
fact the first night slept outside. Too much joy at once may be dangerous.
There is a great idea about that this move is the beginning of the end, and
that the war is practically over. I hope it may be so.
, Monday, 10th.—Another day of rest. Had a splendid bathe.
Tuesday, nth. —Reveille at 5 a.m. A party of 20 went out on patrol
to burn a house. My pony’s back is inclined to be sore, so stayed in camp.
Orders came for a corporal and six men to go with waggon for wood to
make a bonfire. No reason given, but it looks like some joyful event to
come off. Is it peace? No, it did not mean peace, but only a concert!
S.S. “Waiwera,” November 30, 1900. —Many things have happened
since the above was written. lam now on my way home, where I hope to
arrive in about a fortnight, but will try to remember what have been our
movements in the meantime. After a day or two at Waterval, during
which we enjoyed the luxuries of tents, we started on the march again,
leaving Brumby in charge of the tents and spare baggage. This time we
proceeded NW. of Pretoria, and in three days arrived at Crocodile or Lim-
popo River, a fine stream in which we daily had a most delightful bathe, in
spite of warnings against crocodiles, one of which was said to have been
seen while we were there. The weather, however, being hot, the water
could not be resisted. On our way to the Crocodile River we stopped at
a. native village called Hebron, a most interesting little place—little mud
houses, all built in rows, and very neat little walled-in gardens in front of
each, with small gaps just large enough for anyone to get in. Some of
those yards have very neat designs painted on the walls with a red and
white mud. There was also a little church, with a good cabinet organ
which I used to go and play, glad to get a little music. The Mission
House was close by; but the Missionary, whose sons were fighting with the
Boers, had disappeared, leaving his wife and children. There was a Bible
in the church in the Kaffir language, which was very peculiar. We also
passed another native village (Jericho), but this was not built in streets;
although, to my fancy, much more picturesque with the round huts, the
thatch roof extending beyond the walls, making a low verandah. I noticed
here a man washing a baby while the woman crushed the mealie.
We stayed at Crocodile River for a couple of days, being chiefly occu-
pied in burning houses on account of some Australians having been fired

upon in the vicinity. This is a horrible phase of the war, but seems to be-
necessary, although I should be inclined to think it would exasperate the
Boers rather than bring them to their senses. We were then ordered to
return to Waterval, but not to stay more than a couple of days. We then
marched in open order towards Hammaan’s Kraal, and camped just beyond,
meeting with no opposition. On the following day we turned to the right,
and scoured the country N.E. of Pretoria, but without firing a shot. We
secured a lot of sheep and cattle, and after a very long march were very glad
of a fat lamb for tea, which I had commandeered from the sheep. Ihe
following day we again went scouring the country, going north, and drove
some Boers before us into the hills, but still no shots were fired, and
eventually we returned to a place called Simon’s Kraal, or Abraham’s
Kraal, and stopped there for about ten days while General Paget “parleyed”
with Erasmus with a view to getting him to surrender. Some arrange-
ments were come to between them that neither army was to move in certain
directions for six days, while the Boers sent delegates to Delagoa Bay
to see if Kruger had really cleared out, and if Komati Poort was really in
our hands. This move gave them plenty of time to have a rest and then
clear out, and, of course, upon Erasmus’s return he had not any intention
of giving in. The time we spent here was very slow, and I did not feel a +
all well—too listless to do anything. The heat and inaction did not suit
me.
Some sports were got up, in which the Tassies came off with flying
colours. Captain Lewis won the Steeplechase on Brewer’s chestnut (one
of the S.A. horses); Guy Wylly won the tandem, with the captain second.
The latter should have won easily, but was pulled off by his leader swerving
just at the winning-post. Barwise and Peter Clarke ran first and second in
the 100 yards flat race, and J. Hutton, Barwise, and Clarke first, second, and
third in the 440 yards. The day’s sport, altogether, went off very well.
I was very glad when we got orders to boot and saddle and proceed on
the march again. We went from here to a place called Rhenoster Kop,
a most picturesque little settlement, with the country around somewhat
broken to relieve the monotony, and apparently very fertile. Here we
stayed for two days, sending out the usual patrol parties to be fired on by-
Boers in ambush. On one occasion two of our men were wounded—■
Fleming and Smith. The latter was caught by the Boers while watering
his horse. After they had slightly wounded him in the arm, firing at him
at close quarters, they robbed and buffeted him and let him go. His
nerves have since been quite upset. From thence we proceeded to within
six miles of Pretoria, halting for one night at a most dismal place on our
way. We did not arrive there until dark, and it was almost impossible to
find wood or water. Plowever, we weathered this, and were very glad to
camp again next day in good time.
All this time we had been under Colonel Hickman, with the 49th
Yeomanry, with General Paget in command, who had also Plumer’s column
—chiefly Australians and South African colonials—under him. We often
wished that we were under Plumer instead of Hickman. General Paget


had also with him on foot the Munster Fusiliers, a splendid regiment, who
had to be carted about in mealie waggons, as we were a flying squadron,
and went too fast for infantry. During the last march I got a nasty shaking
up. Wishing to give my pony a spell, I rode an Argentine which was
not being used. ihe brute fell into the first hole he came across, and
rolled over me, and then galloped with my foot in the stirrup and head on
the ground between his legs. He was kicking about in all directions, but
fortunately missed me, and plenty of help was at hand to lift me up and
extricate my foot. It was a very nasty experience, and I felt the effects of
it for some days. Having arrived near Pretoria, I rested a day. The
captain got orders to march again, but I was such a wreck by this time that
he sent me, together with several wounded or lame men, viz., Burbury,
Smith, and Garrett, to Pretoria to go out and stop at Waterval with
Brumby and Joe Lester until they should come back there. On the way
to Pretoria we passed the First Tasmanian Contingent’s camp, and called in
to see them. I soon found the two Chalmers, who looked very well, and
had some "afternoon tea" with them, which was most acceptable. I
also looked up the two Collins, and had a chat with them. Lord Roberts
was coming out to them on the following day to try and get them to stay on
a bit longer, their time being up; but they are all too eager to get home,
and thought they had done their share. I little thought I should be
following them up so closely. We got to Pretoria in good time, and sent
our horses back by some of the men who were in town, and then managed
to get a bit of tea, and laid our weary limbs on the hard metal at the railway
station and slept well, no train going to Waterval before 5 o’clock next
morning. Smith, Burbury, and Garrett went by this, but I stayed to help
Groom, who was to get some goods from the Army Store and take to
Waterval. He and I roamed about the town all the morning, getting
a good breakfast for 2s 6d, and then set to work at what turned out to be
a fairly big job, as we had to pack all the things in boxes and get them
ready for the train next day. We eventually got to Waterval safely with
all our things. Here we proceeded to make ourselves comfortable in a
tent; but the next day, having a bad cough on my chest, I went to see the
doctor, who promptly sent me back to Pretoria, and I was soon installed in
No. 2 Model School Hospital. Here I remained in bed for nearly three
weeks, most of the time on milk diet, and I became a skeleton. However,
everyone was most kind, especially the Sister, and I was quite sorry to
leave when the doctor suddenly announced to me that I was to be sent
down to the Cape, en route for England. He had previously told me that
I should not be able to join active service again, and that I should be sent
home, and at first I really did not know which I would rather do, but
came to the conclusion that it would never do to miss a chance of going
to England like this. On arrival at the Cape, however, I found there was
no intention of sending any of us to England, or, in fact, anywhere just at
once. The hospital officials there pay no heed whatever to the
recommendations from Pretoria, and one of our men (Taylor), who is with
us now, did not in the least wish to come out here, as all his people are
in England. We are hoping to be sent home in May.


Our journey down in the train took us nearly six days owing to delays
on the way. We were fortunate in not being attacked by the Boers, as
they had been very active along the line of late, and we quite expected to
have to stand to arms at any time. Of course there were no arms, as it
was purely a hospital train, and so should be free from attack at any time,
but there is no trusting some of these Boers. We were all well looked
after on the way down, and the tea we got was excellent—the best I have
tasted since leaving home. Everywhere else it has been horrid, with the
exception of some I made from tea and milk sent by E. The scenery on
the way down was varied. The plains on the O.R.C. were looking very
pretty and green —a great change from when I last saw them; but further
south they still kept the same brown look, having evidently not got the
rain which they had in the north. The northern part of Cape Colony was
very barren and useless-looking country, and remained so until we came
through the mountain passes, which were lovely. The mountains rose on
each side of the line in a most precipitous manner to the height of about
3000 ft., and the sight was a glorious one, as we passed for miles through
a regular gorge. After passing these the country gradually improved in
appearance, until about 100 miles or so from the Cape we saw cultivated
fields, with crops already cut, waiting to be carted in. They seemed to
be very fair crops.
We arrived at Salt River in the evening, and were sent back to Wyn-
burg, where we spent the night in the train, and in the morning were
hurried off to the Wynburg Hospital, which was nicely situated in a sort
of park, with a beautiful avenue of tremendous gum trees leading to it.
The only patient from No. 2 Model School Hospital who came down with
me was an English Artilleryman named Cross, who had been in the hospital
just three days longer than I with rheumatic fever. The poor fellow’s
agonies at first were dreadful to behold, but he mended wonderfully quickly,
and was out of bed before I was. I did not expect to be in bed long, but
it seems that besides the cold which had got on my lungs I had a "fever,
which kept my temperature going up and down in a most wonderful way!
and also kept me in bed. I always thought that three weeks in bed would
be a terrible thing, but I felt the third and fourth day more than any, and
after that I got quite used to it. ! his man Cross and I became quite
chummy, and made all sorts of arrangements as to what we would do in
England; but we were divided at Wynburg, all Australians being sent to
Woodstock, near Capetown, and we are not likely to meet again as thino-s
have turned out.
At Woodstock we soon found that we might have to wait for weeks
before getting away. We were fairly well looked after, especially myself,
as I was still looking very thin, and had all sorts of extras. We had a
splendid lot of men in our ward. I especially admired a Canadian
Sergeant, who had a great stock of “yarns,” and kept ns alive with his
stories. f met at Woodstock two of our men who had been sent down
some time before—Taylor and Corp. Brown, the latter having been
wounded in the ambush at Warmbad, but has quite recovered now. He


rushed into my ward-room one evening in great excitement, and pointed
out to me a paragraph in the “Cape Argus”—
“A GALLANT BUSHMAN.
‘‘The V.C. has been awarded to Private Bisdee, of the Tasmanian
Bushmen, for rescuing officers at Warmbath.”
[Lieutenant Bisdee did not intend this entry for publication; but my
apology to him for using it, and his observations thereon, is that fame must
endure its penalty, and it would be a wrong to my readers to deprive them
of one of the most interesting items in this whole history.—J.B.]
I was utterly dumbfounded, and could not believe my eyes, but there
it was sure enough, and I can scarcely realise yet what it means. I knew,
of course, that Captain Brooke had recommended me to General Paget,
but I only expected to be mentioned in despatches. I could not sleep for
thinking of it. What excitement it will cause at home! I shall be
almost afraid to land, but I expect all enthusiasm will have been exhausted
on the arrival of the First Contingent a few days before. I hope I shall
not have to make any speeches. [You just will, then.]
On Sunday, November 18, all Tasmanians and New Zealanders were
ordered to get their kits and be ready to start on Monday by the
“Waiwera,” which was due that day. So we considered ourselves fortunate,
but she did not arrive then, nor yet on Tuesday until late at night. I got
leave to go into Capetown on Tuesday to get something I wanted, such as
deck shoes, etc. Capetown is not a bad city for the capital, but the streets
are very narrow and crowded. Nearly everything is very dear; but,
nevertheless, we got as much lunch as we could eat for pel, which was
certainly not expensive. The place is crowded with refugees from Johan-
nesburg, who are very anxious to get back, and also with immigrants
from everywhere, especially Australia, who want to get up to the mines,
but will have to wait some time yet.
Monday, December 3. —We all got on board on Wednesday afternoon,
and started at 6 p.m. The “Waiwera” is not a very large boat, but is a
splendid sea boat, as steady as possible; so much so that I have never
yet missed a meal! I was only sick once. To-day she is pitching more
than she has all through, and I confess to a rather uncomfortable feeling.
We were all lined up to-day, and asked if there was anything we wanted
in the shape of money, etc., as the paymaster was on board; but when
reminded that it was usual for each man to receive a gratuity of £5 upon
leaving they acknowledged that, but said that they had no money to pay it
on board ! I wonder why the paymaster was there ? Each of the hospital
patients received an Absent-Minded Beggar parcel, which was very accept-
able, containing a suit of pyjamas, a shirt, vest and pants, handkerchief and
cap, and pair of socks. We were then escorted to the steerage, and
shown our cabins. The cabin accommodation seemed to be rather close,
but has turned out very fair —a Paradise to what we had on the “Manhattan”
—but that was an inferno. The food is also very fair, and the passengers
a much better class than I expected; in fact, there are many ladies and


gentlemen who were unable to go first class on account of its being full.
This is not a passenger boat, and has only seven or eight first-class berths,
and all the rest are steerage. Taylor and I enquired if we could not pay
the difference and go first; but, as mentioned, it was full. So far we have
had very good weather, and have averaged 280 knots. The last day or two
we had a strong wind behind us, which drove us along well, and raised a
tremendous sea, which, however, did not seem to affect the boat much, and
was a magnificent sight. Such waves, curling over with splendid crests
of spray! We have now a strong head wind, which is quite a different
matter, and she is rolling and pitching a good deal, so will finish up for
the present.
S.S. “Waiwera,” Monday, December 10. —We are now getting nearer
home, and expect to arrive on Wednesday. We have so far had a very
smooth passage, as far as the pitching and rolling is concerned, but most
unpleasant weather all the same, always cold and rainy. We have been
fortunate, however, in seeing several icebergs, which looked very majestic
and grand, but would have been more so if the sun had shone upon them.
The most noteworthy thing that has happened to me is the breaking of my
Swan Fountain pen, which has been a great friend all through the campaign.
It is a most unfortunate occurrence.
We have a very good lot of passengers on the whole, especially for the
steerage, many ladies and gentlemen amongst them. The “khaki” members
of the passengers are mostly first-class men, but there are a few from each
who make fools of themselves, and keep other people awake at nights. It.
is a favourite pastime of this set to throw empty tins about the saloon by
way of music. There are two newly-married couples and one young lady,,
who, I believe, is coming out to be married, and stacks of children, who
kick up a great row at times, but, on the whole, are very good ; and one
very large family of Poles, mostly very pretty children.
Our chief amusements are reading, for which I procured some of
Dickens’s and Thackeray’s works, and also Kingsley’s “Yeast” and
“Hypatia,” and Mrs. H. Ward’s “Marcella;” whist, chess, deck billiards,
and glee-singing in the evening. I find the books I got more than enough
to keep me going. Most of them required a good deal of reading. Some
sports were also got up, and have not yet been quite finished. A tug-of-
war between the military “invalids” and civilians was won easily by the
former, who ran away with their opponents. Cock-fighting, pillow-fighting,
and potato races, egg and spoon, etc., etc., were all run yesterday. Every
Sunday a Mr. Heyn, from the first saloon, reads the service, which consists
of the prayers and hymns, as he does not rise to a sermon. We have
some very fair songsters, but no stars. The Mr. Heyn mentioned above is
coming out to inspect a large order from the Admiralty for blue gum piles,
which a firm in Tasmania has undertaken. He says that if this contract
is satisfactory there is a very large business to be done with the Admiralty.
So I hope that the timber merchants in Hobart will rise to the occasion
and only offer the best timber.


Sunday, March 10, 1901. —I have now been home just three months,
and feel as if I had never been away, except for a sort of dream. We
arrived at about 3.30 on Wednesday, December 12. The passage up the
river was most delightful, more especially to us who were returning home.
The geraniums at Lower Sandy Bay were the admiration of everyone.
One could imagine that we had been away for five or six years by the
eagerness with which we recognised various places. As Hobart drew in
sight we looked to see if anyone was on the wharf to meet us; but Mr.
Richardson (Commissioner of Police) came on board with the harbour-
master to see if his son was with us, and informed us that no one had any
idea that we were coming. Young Richardson was on board, and told
his father who the rest of us were. He told us the glad news of Guy
Wylly’s having also got the V.C., at which I was more than delighted, and
we also heard how the First Contingent had just arrived about four days
before us, and what a great reception they got. I was rather relieved to
hear that we were not expected, as I did not quite know what was going
to happen.
As we came alongside a small knot of people gathered to see who was
there. Among them were Jimmy Counsel, Alfred Holmwood, and young
Crosby, and I was soon recognised, and found myself the centre of observa-
tion. Those on the wharf gave three cheers, and I was urged to make a
speech. I did not, however, rise to the occasion, and, fortunately, we
soon had to bundle off with our luggage. When we got off everyone
wanted to shake hands at once, and I began to feel uncommonly glad that
there were not more people there.
We were then lined up and marched to the Town Hall, leaving our
baggage to the mercy of a parcel delivery van, and when I got mine again
it was minus some beautiful ostrich feathers and deck shoes which I had got
at the Cape. In the Town Hall we were entertained with light refresh-
ments and a welcome from the Mayor, and, to my horror, 1 was asked to
return thanks. This was the beginning of my troubles! I got up and
said something —goodness knows what! I was not sorry when it was cut
short by the order to line up again and proceed to the Coffee Palace. I
was not, however, to be let off thus lightly, as the news had spread over
Hobart, and a crowd had collected in front of the Town Hall, and as soon
as I came out more cheering started, and, of course, this time there was no
getting out of it; so I had to stand up on the steps and harangue the
multitude. It is a most queer sensation to find oneself suddenly famous,
and I must own to an uncanny sort of feeling when I saw everyone eyeing
me, and a lot of inquisitive individuals following me everywhere. [They
did the same, my dear fellow, with Scipio Africanus at Rome.]
I met several relatives and people I knew, who were very astounded
to see me. Mr. and Miss E. L. I found looking for me at the Coffee
Palace, and I at once took refuge at “Ellerslie,” after having seen a number
of those who had returned of our contingent at the Coffee Palace. Needless
to say, I received a most hearty welcome on all hands. E. and B. and L.
and Z. had been in town to see the First Contingent arrive, and had just


SNAPSHOTS ON THE FIEEU, BY LIEUTENANT BISDEE, V.C.


returned home. ihe two first immediately came back and met me at
Ashfield. Ihe other returned men were taken to the theatre on Wednes-
day night, and saw a biograph representation of scenes at the war. 1
stopped in town all i hursday to see Colonel Legge, and get through any
other departmental business, and went off home by the 10.30 train on
hriday, E. and B. going with me.
We here take our leave of the gallant trooper with a keen sense
of the truth of the maxim that bravery is always modest. These
notes, especially those written after his return, were intended to complete a
private record for family reference; yet, considering the distinguished hon-
our which he brought to Tasmania, there is no word that suggests an
undue estimate thereof, or that renders them unsuitable for publication.
My readers will, I am sure, be delighted to read something of our hero’s
sensations under a sudden exposure to the light and huzzas of fame. When
I begged to be allowed a free hand with his diaries he very modestly
expressed his “alarm” at the use 1 proposed to make of them.
EXTRACTS FROM A LETTER
Received from Sergeant E. W. Stephens, of the First Tasmanian Imperial
Contingent.
“Rhenoster, December 2, 1901. —Hobart is probably reading to-day
the news of a big engagement we (Paget's Brigade) have just had here. I
fancy it will be called the Battle of Rietfontein. Soon after the date of my
last letter we came through Pretoria to the east, and joined the Fourth
Regiment again; that is, the South and West Australians, with whom we
came out. We had been out here before, through Sybrand’s Kraal, and
on to Rhenoster. This time we met Erasmus and Viljoen close to
Sybrand’s, and have had three days’ hard fighting, finishing up with a
desperate “go.’' We left camp at 2 a.m. on Friday, and had a long slope
clear of trees to mount, and over the top into the Rietfontein Valley, which
is also clear of trees, but full of rocky knolls and small kopjes. We got a
few stray shots from the Boer g\h. gun as we were going up the rise, and
then there was a lull. We dismounted about 400 yards from the top of
the hill, and advanced on foot, and when we got on to the sky line —whiz! —
bang!—we did get it hot. We all had to drop down flat, and there we
were for fourteen hours, firing and getting fired at. If you raised your
head you would get a volley into you. The Boers had a Maxim, which
they turned on the West Riding Tommies, and cut them down whole-
sale, killing their Colonel. The Boers had a grand position behind these
rocks at 200 yards distance, and we could not shift them until late at
night. We retired a few hundred yards at dusk to get something to
eat and drink, and then out again, and were hard at work digging trenches
until 3 o’clock next morning. However, at daylight we found the enemy
had retired into the valley. We have been having a bit of sniping since
Friday, but nothing to speak of. Our casualties on Friday numbered
about 100, and 25 killed among them. Out of that number New Zealand
6, South Australians (lying alongside of us) 2, Queensland 1, Victoria 1.


So you see our luck was in again. Most of the fatalities were caused by
the fellows getting up to see better where the Boers were, which was
foolhardy under the circumstances. The Boers certainly made a fine stand
against our fire, which must have been deadly at times, as we picked up
and buried 30 of them. Letters seem to come all right now, as the postal
authorities know our whereabouts better than they did. I got ten letters
and various papers. lam fairly well, though a bit run down.”

OTES from Trooper Douglas Brownell’s Diary for 15 days in
July, 1900. —July 15 —Left Pretoria at 6 a.m. with Colonel
Hickman’s Horse under General Mahon, reached Nitrel’s Pass
at 9.9 a.m., and got through unopposed. Found body of
Gardiner, one of our comrades, who was shot previous night.
Queenslanders determined to avenge his death. On seeing our column
safely over the ridge, the Boers made off in a northerly direction, making
their retreat safe by setting the veldt on fire. There was a strong wind
blowing at the time, and the flames spread so rapidly through the long
grass that we had some difficulty in saving part of our transport; as it
was, one ambulance waggon had to be outspanned and left to the mercy
of the flames. In lending a hand with the waggons, I was soon left
behind by our column, and when going off at a full gallop to regain my
former position, the horse trod in a rabbit burrow, fell heavily, and rolled
on top of me. However, I was on again in an instant, but got a severe
shaking. At noon our course turned due east, and we reached Waterval
at 6 p.m., where we camped for the night. Only five weeks previous
to this nearly 4000 of our men were held in captivity here by the enemy.
Ere this you have read many descriptions of the place from the various
war correspondents. The enclosure contains several acres, hemmed in by
innumerable electric wires, which made it utterly impossible for any to
escape. There were also extensive galvanised iron buildings in the
enclosure, used for sleeping accommodation. A neat little store and hotel
stood near. This was looted, in spite of screams from the Boer women.
Just before dark General lan Hamilton joined us, bringing with him the


Seaforth, Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, also four batteries of
artillery, besides Maxims and Gatlings. It was a fine sight seeing them
go by in full marching order, bagpipes playing, etc.
July 16.—Reveille at 5 a.m. and off at 6. In the advance guard we
march north, and at 12 noon came suddenly on the enemy’s rear guard.
Bang, bang, ping, whiz their volleys; they are all at us, but owing to the
thick scrub we cannot locate the enemy, and in the confusion the order
comes, “Retire!'’ We do so, but not until Sergeant Maxwell and a.
trooper, both Queenslanders, are shot dead, besides two being wounded.
We then wait for the infantry to come up, who very soon start a flank
movement, and the enemy make off as fast as their horses will carry them.
“Prepare to mount.” “Mount.” “Walk, march,” are the three monotone
orders, which come in quick succession, and we are once more on the move.
Reach Haman s Kraal, where we camp for the night. The enemy had
been in laager here for some weeks, and their fires are still smouldering.
Some had evidently intended making themselves snug for the night, as we
found a number of straw beds, one of which I was fortunate enough to
secure.
July 17. —Reduced to three-quarter rations. Move off at 7 a.m. For
several miles we retrace our steps in a southerly direction, then heading for
Middelburg. Reach Silverdal at nightfall, after travelling 19 miles. I
covered the distance on foot, carrying full kit, my horse having a sore
back. Nothing worthy of note taking place during day. Scents report
a strong Boer commando moving parallel with us on left flank.
July 18.—Reveille at 5 a.m.; off at 6.30. Very warm during the day;
great scarcity of water. Still leading my horse. Come to the conclusion
that walking is a “mug’s game." At 1 p.m. enemy start sniping from
kopje on left flank, but distance is too great for their fire to have any effect
on us. We hear to-day that Botha is on left flank with strong force, and
may have general engagement any hour. Arrived at waggon drift at 4
p.m., after a tramp of 17 miles. Reduced from three-quarters to half
rations. This evening the names of those willing to go to England are
taken; 90 per cent, of the Queenslanders sign, myself included.
July 19. —Move off at 7 a.m. Still walking. Pass through some
very scrubby country. Reach Orange Grove a little after noon, where we
camp the night. A very pretty little place, surrounded by high kopjes.
July 20. —Reveille at 5 a.m.; off at 6.30. As my horse is very unfit
for use, he is moved to the rear, there to receive a charge of lead.
lam placed in charge of Staff Officer’s waggon. We had not moved
out of camp five minutes when the loud report of a big gun rang out from a
hill overlooking our camp, and before we could get our heads round we
heard the peculiar sound of a shell as it sped on its deadly errand. All
eyes were turned upward; then a deafening sound, and with it a cloud of
smoke and dust arose some 400 yards beyond us. That is only a “sighter,”
I said to my mate, and sure enough three successive shots came right in the
midst of ns. A nigger who was walking within ten paces of me had half
his head blown off. It was a sickening sight. To explain matters, I


should mention here that the infantry and most of the heavy artillery had
moved out of camp half an hour previous to this, and as the picket on the
hills came in without being relieved, the enemy took their advantage by
running up half a battery of artillery and two pom-poms on a kopje over-
looking our camp. It was a splendid position, the range being 4700 yards.
For the next half-hour the enemy worked their guns with considerable
effect on our transport. The waggon in the rear of mine had one mule
fairly cut in two and three others mangled, whilst another, still farther in
the rear, carrying stores, had to be abandoned, and set on fire. However,
the enemy were not going to have it all their own way for long.
Fortunately the fine Elswick Battery, consisting of six 3-inch naval guns,
were to bring up our rear, and as yet had not moved out of camp. Amidst
curses and oaths, the drivers switched horses on to the guns, and in a few
minutes were off at a gallop to take up a position under shelter of a kopje
in the rear. Whilst doing so the enemy brought up a pom-pom, and for
a time made things very unpleasant for them. In the meantime our
transport was getting a good shelling, and, unfortunately, my two Kaffirs
ran the staff waggon hard and fast against a tree. The other transport soon
pushed ahead, and left me to my fate. Then came what I most dreaded.
The Boers singled me out, and shell after shell came over and around me
in rapid succession, one grazing the top of the waggon and passing my head
within an arm's length. Besides, many others were falling within a
radius of 20 yards from where I stood. My two drivers were terrified,
and wanted to clear off, but after threatening them with a bullet they
decided to stay, and grin and bear their uncomfortable position. During
this fusilade, which lasted half an hour, I had outspanned the whole team,
and hitched some on to rear of waggon, and in this way managed to get
clear. About five minutes before we got away our two 4.7, which were
about the first to leave the camp, had headed back, and when veering within
150 yards of us put about a dozen of shrapnell into the Boer Artillery,
which soon made them retire. At the same time the Elswick Battery,
which was the first to get into action, had been doing some splendid work,
the second shot throwing a Boer gun out of action. The noise of artillery
for a time was terrific. This was varied at times by some tearing rifle fire
and pom-poms. The latter have a most demoralising effect on friend and
foe alike. As soon as our transport got out of range of the enemy’s
guns they did not wait to try conclusions with our superior artillery, but
rushed their guns six miles further on, and again started banging at us,
but it soon turned to an artillery duel. Our siege gun and two 4.7
guns took up a position on the open plain. The Boer guns were situated
on a kopje six thousand yards on the left flank. For a couple of hours
there was some very heavy firing on both sides. All this time I was
about a quarter of a mile from our guns, and could see the whole thing to
advantage. The enemy’s shells were very accurately placed, and had
they been the same stamp as ours our loss would have been considerable.
As it was we had 19 casualties. I certainly owe my life to the poor quality
of the Boer ammunition. It was a splendid sight watching our lyddite and
shrapnel bursting on a kopje. The enemy lost heavily here, and after


seeing their chance was a hopeless one retired. We then moved four
miles further on, and made our camp in the timber. I omitted to mention
that during the day two Boer waggons, which were sent out to gather in
the spoil from our abandoned transport, fell into our hands, being captured
by us.
July 21. —Reveille at 5 a.m.; move off at 6.30; on half rations. During
the day we have an uninterrupted march of 14 miles through open country.
Fourteen Boers taken prisoners. Camp for the night at Dwan’s Drift.
July 22. —Camp the whole day, clean rifles, etc. Sergeant comman-
deers a horse for me from the Imperial Light Horse lines. All the
morning Boers have been sniping at our pickets. At 12.30 one of our
field batteries went out, and made an attempt to get one of the enemy’s
Long Toms, which was stuck in a drift six miles from here; but the attempt
proved fruitless. However, on returning, they shelled a Boer house to
pieces, where Boer snipers had taken refuge.
July 23. —Reveille at 5 a.m., moved off at 6.30; rear guard shelled when
leaving camp. Royal Horse Artillery soon dispersed enemy. At 2 p.m.
we reached Bronkhurstspruit, a name venerated by the Boers. Close
beside where we are camping are the graves of over 300 Britishers of the
94th, who fell with Colonel Anstruther in 1880. When bringing in
supplies for Pretoria, just before entering the village, we came upon the
house of Field-Cornet Erasmus, now General; in less than 20 minutes the
place was a perfect wreck. Some of the troops were even hacking a grand-
piano to pieces for their camp fires. Some of the I.S.H. found a quantity
of jewellery and other curios. The Delagoa Bay Railway runs through
here. About a quarter of a mile from the station we found a fine iron
span railway bridge blown to pieces, the Boers doing this to prevent our
forward movement. A convoy arrived this evening, which means full
rations to-morrow.
July 24. —Left Bronkhurstspruit at 7.30. In rear-guard, very warm
during the day. After an uneventful march of 17 miles we reach a small
village, where we start to camp for the night. When half-way through our
tea orders came to pack up at once, and march six miles further on to
Balmoral. However, we had no sooner moved off when the rain came
down in torrents, and the night became as dark as pitch. Before covering
the first mile there came on one of the heaviest thunderstorms I had
seen; sheet and forked lightning came in rapid succession, lighting up the
kopjes and showing our column for miles. Very soon our road became a
river bed, and one by one the waggons were blocked. At 11 p.m. it
was quite evident that our transports could not get through, so a large
number of troops were sent back on guard. My position was in the
middle of a drift, where I stood knee-deep until the small hours of the
morning; it was a time I shall not soon forget. Our big 6in. gun, drawn
by 20 oxen, became hard and fast in the mud, and for a couple of hours
a whole company of men were straining every muscle to get it free.
Fortunately, I was not the last to stay in this unenviable position, as I
had a despatch to carry into camp. It was with the greatest difficulty


I found my way in. Every mile or so I kept coming on to the sentries.
‘‘Halt!’ “Who goes there?” “Friend,” I would shout in reply.
“Advance, friend, and give the countersign.” I would then make my way
to a thin, light streak, which I always found to be the bayonets; find
sentries standing at the charge. “Poland,” I would give as the counter-
sign. “Pass on, friend.” On reaching the camp I found the troops in
a pitiable plight; very few had ventured to sleep in their wet blankets,
most of them preferring to stand round the fires in pouring rain. How-
ever, I turned in, in spite of everything, and next morning could scarcely
move for stiffness. All through the night a large number of our chaps
had been trying in vain to bring in the transport. Our losses from
exposure and overwork were very heavy. One officer and three High-
landers found dead next morning; besides these, many more had to be
carried away to the hospital, 250 mules, 140 bullocks, and nearly 100
horses also died. Just before reaching Balmoral the Boers had cleared
out in a couple of trains towards Lydenburg.
July 25. —The storm which had worked such havoc during the night has
abated, and once more the sun is out. We camp half the day, and spend
time in drying blankets, clothes, etc., whilst the Royal Engineers are still
digging waggons out of the drifts, making roads passable, and getting
dead mules, horses, and oxen off the track. At 1 p.m. the order comes,
“Strike camp and right about turn.” We then retrace our steps, only
covering six miles in the afternoon, the first three miles being literally
strewn with the dead transport animals lost during the night. Two more
men died to-day from the effects of the exposure. We hear in orders
to-night that, disastrous as our forced march was, it had the effect of
driving the enemy on to French, who cut them up severely, capturing a
number of their guns. Quite a treat to have a dry blanket to jump into.
July 26.—Reveille at 5 a.m., off at 6; by a short cut, make Bronkhurst-
spruit in 14 miles. We find a garrison in the town, also a party of Royal
Engineers repairing railway bridge and mending culverts, which had been
blown up for miles. Camped here for the night.
July 27. —Off again at 7-3°> i° direction of Pretoria; about dinner-time
the Boers stubbornly resisted our forward movement. Firing was kept
up for a considerable time; but after flanking them they made off
under cover of some kopjes. After travelling 13 miles reached Diamond
Hill, where we camp for the night. General Prinsloo’s homestead is
situated here. This we looted and burned to the ground. I had the
duty of falling a large gum tree across the dwelling-house. Passed
through some fine country during the day.
July 28.—Reveille at 6.30, moved off at 8 a.m. in advance guard; on the
go all day, passing through some very hilly and well-watered country,
our track in parts being extremely rough and difficult. Very little
opposition from enemy. Camp in a gully surrounded by hills.
July 29. —Away at 7.30. Still passing through hilly country; no
enemy in sight during the day. Passed the spot of some recent engage-
ment, and nearly stifled by the odour of dead horses. Reached Silverdal
very late in the night, where we make our camp.


July 30. —March off to Pretoria, reaching there at 3 p.m.; camp three
miles outside town. No chance of writing a letter. A few additional
notes, which may be of interest. If you want to picture me on the veldt
you must not imagine that I have the spick-and-span rig as when I left
Tasmania. Just before coming in from the front the last time we looked
more like tramps than soldiers. My attire consisted of the following; —
An old khaki helmet, pair of light tweed pants smothered in gore, with
half a leg torn off, exposing a sun-burnt leg (no putties), white bandolier.
In day time rarely wear a coat, but sling bandolier over a brown singlet.
The General said as long as a man carried a rifle and 140 rounds of
ammunition that was all he wished for. You would be very much amused
to see a party of us coming in about dusk. Say, one company, 100 men,
all whistling, and each carrying a log of wood across his saddle, and,
perhaps, a few fowls dangling from his stirrup-irons. On an extra
good day, goats, pigs, geese, turkeys, etc., on nearly every saddle. We
have no cooks; each man lights his own fire and cooks for himself.
These notes were written in the Field Hospital, Johannesburg, where
Trooper Brownell is lying with both knees crushed, the result of his horse
falling with, and on, him; otherwise he is in excellent health and spirits.
WITH THE TASMANIAN BUSHMEN.
SOME STIFF FIGHTING.
The following letter, under date December 5, has been received from
Ouarter-Master-Sergeant R. J. Williams, of the Tasmanian Imperial
Bushmen Contingent, serving in South Africa:—“As I have to chance
posting any letters I send it is impossible for me to put the name of the
town in, and as we are continually on the go marching and fighting, I
get very few opportunities of sending you any news as to our movements.
The war as a war has been over some time, but there are several
commandoes of Boers, who are moving about the country, and they take a
lot of catching. However, slowly but surely we are wiping them out,
and may expect to leave the country in another couple of months. The
rainy season has set in in earnest, and you can imagine travelling and
fighting without shelter, and often enough wet through all day and night.
This exposure, combined with the effects of sickness, wounds, and death,
has reduced our squadron sadly, and instead of the fine body of 120 men
who left Tasmania we can barely muster 68, and we have every prospect
of further diminishing our numbers as the rainy season has set in,
and enteric and malarial fever are very prevalent, and troops sicken
every day, wet and exposure doing their work. I have just received
word that two bags of mails were destroyed by Boers, and I have every
reason to believe that a long report of mine to you was in one of the bags,,
so I must just go over the ground again. We have been marching round
and round, burning and destroying, and dispersing commandoes of Boers,
and at present we are halted at Este Fabreiken, 10 miles east of Pretoria on
the Delagoa Bay line. You will, no doubt, remember my describing the
fight we had with the Boers at Warmbad on September 1. Well, it gives


me great pleasure to be able to tell you and Tasmania that Trooper John
Bisdee, of the Tasmanian Imperial Bushmen, has gained that coveted
honour the V.C., and in the opinion of us, his comrades, he deserved it
fully, and we are proud men this day to think that out of the Imperial
Bushmen comes the first V.C. to Tasmania, and I would like to thank
Captain Brooke, of the Army Service Corps, publicly for his strenuous
efforts to get irooper Bisdee’s valour recognised in the proper quarter,
and it is due in a great measure to the captain’s persistent efforts that due
recognition followed. To enumerate all the little towns we have visited
would take too long, and would be uninteresting, as they all resemble
one another, and with the exception of our forced march from Jericho to
Rustenburg to cut off De la Rey from joining De Wet we have not had
any real hard fighting for the past six weeks. On October 23 we marched
from Matapau to Jericho, and our advance under General Plumer captured
a small party of Boers, with some waggons and stock, and from them we
learnt that there were several parties of Boers in the vicinity, with two
or three guns. About 3 p.m. we came into action with their rearguard at
about 500 yards, and a brisk rifle fire took place. We finally drove them
out of position, and hotly pursued, but we were recalled, as the General did
not deem it prudent to leave his convoy unprotected. It had been raining
very heavily the night before, so the waggons on the march made no
dust, and were completely hidden in the bush, which enabled us to surprise
our wily enemy, and succeeded in capturing five of them asleep on the
banks of the creek. In conversation with the prisoners we discovered
the fact that most of the Boers were kept in ignorance of the British
annexation of the country, and when they were told that the British had
occupied Pretoria early in June, would not believe it, their Generals having
told them that Germany was coming to help them, and that Ladysmith,
Mafeking, and Kimberley had all fallen into their hands, and we were
being defeated all along the line. It is hard to credit such colossal
ignorance, but when you see the class of men one can easily understand
it: a more ignorant race of men and women it would be impossible to
come across (for whites). We went into camp at a place called Jericho,
and General Plumer took out his division on the right flank, taking all
guns but two of the Canadian Battery, which he left for the protection of
the camp. Early next morning at daylight we had ample proof that our
enemy had guns, as they started shelling the camp at daylight, and, to
add insult to injury, they were firing i2lb. British shells at us. Their
shooting, taken on the whole, was bad, as we only had two casualties, whilst
after a brisk cannonade out two guns silenced theirs, and General Plumer
came galloping back with his battery and all our crowd (Australians),
with the result that the enemy beat a hasty retreat. However, we followed
them up, and succeeded in capturing their two guns and 90 men.
THE AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL BUSHMEN.
IN THE FIGHT AT RHENOSTER KOP.
Trooper W. L. Eddy, of the Tasmanian draft of the Imperial Bush-
men, writes to his parents at Lefroy from Rhenoster Kop under date


December 2 as follows:—“I will give you a little about the fight we had the
other day. It was a terrible go in, lasting 14 hours. Our casualties
numbered 116. The following is the address read to us by the General;
‘ The Major-General wishes to record his high appreciation of the gallant
conduct of the troops under his command during the recent engagement.
The enemy were in a strong natural defensive position, which they were
forced to evacuate by the intrepid advance of our men under an
exceptionally heavy fire. He considers it unwise to select any special
regiment for particular mention. He also wishes to express his sympathy
with the First West Riding Regiment in the loss of their commanding
officer, also with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles for the very heavy loss
they have suffered both in officers and men. He also wishes to point out to
his troops that the moral effect of this engagement on the Boers must be
very great. He thanks all ranks for the way they have behaved, and
wishes to express admiration for their bravery and devotion to duty.—
Major-General Paget.” “In publishing the above to the mounted troops
in his force Brigadier-General Plumer wishes to say how proud he was
to have in his command troops who behaved in action as the two brigades
did on November 29 at Rhenoster Kop.—Brigadier-General Plumer.”
LETTER FROM TROOPER GLEESON.
Mrs. N. Gleeson, of Chudleigh Junction, has received the following
letter from her son, Trooper D. Gleeson, of the Tasmanian Imperial
Contingent, about whose condition various rumours were some time ago
privately circulated, but which his friends will be pleased to see were
without foundation. The letter is dated Observation Hill, Pretoria,
January 18, and runs as follows:
“Just a few lines to say lam still alive and well. We have been camped
here for the last few days, having a spell, which we wanted, as we have
done some long marching lately, and the days are very hot now, though
the nights are always cool, and some of them have been wet lately, which
makes things very disagreeable.
“Last time we left here we made a forced march to hold a pass north
of Rustenburg. We were up at 2.30 for several mornings, and marched
all day. Our waggons with the tents and bedding could not keep up
with us, so we only had what we could carry on our horses. We got
to the pass all right, and then it commenced to rain, and during the
few days we were there it was raining more or less all the time, so we had
not a pleasant time of it. We expected the Boers would come through
while we were there, but we were disappointed, as they did not put in an
appearance. We could have given them a lively time if they had come,
as we had plenty of cover in the rocks.
“After leaving there we came back to Pretoria again. We called at
a Kaffir village on the way, and took a German missionary parson and
several of his relations prisoners for giving the Boers information. We
camped at Commando Nek for a day, and then went to hold a pass at
another place. The road ran up a big valley and from the hill on our left


the Boers kept sniping at us all day, but they could not do us much harm.
We got plenty of grapes and peaches from the gardens at the farms as we
’.vent along, and they were a great treat. We arrived at the pass at 4
o clock in the afternoon, and all the guns were run in position. We had to
build breastworks of stone, and we had to lie behind them all night, and
as it rained heavily we had rather a bad night of it. Our waggons tried
to come up to us with rations next day, but the Boers attacked them, and
they had to retire again. We had only one day’s ‘tucker’ with us, so next
night, as soon as it was dark, we left and made back to where the waggons
were. We expected to be attacked, but we were not, and at 3 next
morning we got to the waggons. We were all very tired, as we had very
little sleep for two nights, so we lay down and slept well for three or four
hours. After that we went in pursuit of some Boers towards Johannes-
burg. We captured some waggons, but as we ran out of ‘tucker’ we
came in here. I Bear we are to leave again in the morning. I don’t
think we are likely to get home for another six months.”
The following extracts from letters by the late Captain Sale, of
Launceston, have been placed at my disposal. They will be read with
deep interest, especially as the gallant Captain is now among the immortals.
[Lieutenant Sale was at this time in charge of No. 3 troop of the
Imperial Bushmen.]
“Wynberg, July 21, 1900. To Mr. T. J. Sale, St. Leonards. —We
left Bethlehem on Sunday with a convoy to this place. On Friday
following we went with a party about 10 miles out to mind a telegraph line,
and struck a party of Boers on a range of hills, and shot a lot at one
another, but at long range; they had no guns. The wire was mended, and
we would have got away all right only a party of Yeomanry somehow got
in too close without supports, with the result that eleven of them were
mi-sing when they came back. Next morning a party went out and
found three dead. The rest, I suppose, were wounded and taken off by
the Boers. The next day I went out with my troop to get some horses.
We saw a few Boers, and had a few shots at them, and from them, while
bringing in the horses, but no one was hurt on our side, nor, I think
on theirs either. I think they are ‘artists’ in their style of firing. We
only brought in a few horses that were any good. The second day out
from Bethlehem to here we came across a large body, supposed to be 1500,
with four guns. For some time there was only rifle fire in front; then
our guns started shelling where the main body of Boers were supposed
to be. Soon their guns started putting shells back, and their fire was
ve™ accurate. They had one gun, which evidently outranged ours, and
our fellows could not even locate it. Their shells, however, very seldom
burst, which was a good job for us. We were put as escort for the guns,
and had to lie down near them doing nothing. Since then we have not
done anything very exciting. We are going to start back again on
Monday. I think they are trying to surround De Wet, but he is very
slippery. Nearly all our horses are more or less knocked up; not from
overworn: so much as from only getting a few oats to eat, and the grass
being only like dry chips, they will eat very little of it.”


“Wvnburg, August 9, 1900. —We have just arrived here again from
Slobber’s Nek. We arrived there too late to take any part in the fighting;
we heard the guns shelling the place the day before we got there.
The Boers did not make much of a stand. I believe De Wet managed
to get away with about 1500, but the rest surrendered, I think, with six
guns and between 4000 and 5000 men. We came here to escort about
2000 prisoners. They did not give us any bother, and I think they are sick
of the war. They sing hymns every night. Some of them are very fat
old tellows. I was in their lines having a yarn with them the other day.
A few of them can speak English, and from what I can gather they think
they have a fair show of winning. Their losses have not, I think, been
very great. One old fellow told me he belonged to the Archberg Com-
mando, and they had been pretty well right through the war, and numbered
about 500 strong, out of which they had only about 25 killed and 25
wounded. I enclose one of their proclamations, which I got from him.
I believe it to be the last Mr. Steyn issued, and may be interesting to
ke< p.
“Warm Baths, August 27, 1900. —We arrived at Pretoria on the 17th,
and had a march past Lord Roberts’s quarters, where he inspected us.
They say he inspects all troops that come through. We have left the
South and West Australians, and are on our own for some time now.
It is much better. We only stopped near Pretoria about four hours. I
got into the town, and had a warm bath, which I wanted badly. There
are some fine buildings in the centre of the town. All the Dutch towns
have a sort of square within, with the principal buildings around it. We
thought we were going to have a spell of a few days, but we were sent out
in the afternoon, and went about four miles and camped. The next day
we went out with a small column, got in touch with the Boers, had a bit
of shooting, and went into camp again. Next day we started out with
a larger force, and occupied a pass on the railway to Pietersburg, about nine
miles out. We had got there about an hour with the mounted men and a
pom pom, when the Boers showed up. They shot five or six of the
Yeomanry patrol, who ought to have come in before, and we put the
pom-pom on them, so they retired behind the hill at a gallop. We had a
rifle fire going on for the rest of the day. The Boers had a big gun, but
it did us no damage. We were reinforced by the infantry, and there was
no sign of the Boers next morning. We moved on next day to try to
overtake them, and exchanged a few shots. The next day we went on
after them, but they got on the railway above us, and, I believe, went
up the tailway. They have an engine running. The Boers cut about
the country in a remarkable manner. I think they generally move at night
without any convoy, and have a strong rearguard of mounted men behind.
The next day we got in touch with De Wet (the other lot was under
Grcbler), and drove him up past this place. We arrived here first about
four days ago. We had one of our men (Cooper) wounded coming in.
We ha' e not heard since how he is getting on. We were on the left
flank, and he was shot before he had time to dismount. This place has
a number of hot-water baths in it and one big hotel. The water comes


■from a hot spring. It is evidently a new place. The next day after we
arrived we went with a mounted force, including Baden-Powell’s, to try to
get round the Boers to the north. We seldom mount more than 50 men
all told now, so many have got no horses or have been left behind at
-c.fferent places. We had a man wounded the first afternoon out. He
was hit in the leg; his name is Butcher. Baden-Powell took possession
of a township called Nylstroom on the 26th. We acted as his escort
and then his guard to the town. I got a beautiful Mauser carbine, which
lam going to use instead of a rifle. We came back here again yesterday.
I believe the position was not thought a very safe one. This country has
far more timber than the Free State, and we have no trouble to get
firewood.”
The following extract appeared in the “North-West Advocate.” It
was received by Mr. A. C. Curtis, of Ulverstone, from Lieutenant Sale, who
wrote under date November 23, 1900, from North Pretoria:—“We have
been camped here for the last three days. It is about ten miles from
Pretoria, close alongside the big Transvaal whisky manufactory. You
can’t get any of the produce there now, but we don’t want it, as we got
.a good stock when we came through Pretoria. We have been going to
leave here every morning at 5 o’clock, but it has always rained for three
or four hours, and it has been put off. Some of the First Bushmen have
been agitating to be let go home; so we were all paraded yesterday before
General Paget, who gave us to understand that there was no chance of
any more troops being sent back for some months to come, and I expect
there will be a good deal more fighting in a small way yet. I don’t know
yet which way we are going when we start, but expect it will be some time
before we get back.”
“Since writing, so far, I have been carrying this in my pocket. We
are now at Roynestor’s Kop [Rhenoster ?]. We struck some Boers on
the second day out. I was acting as galloper for Hickman and Plumer,
and saw everything that was going on; but it knocked my horse out, the
ground being very stony. There was a lot of firing, but not many
casualties, as we did not come to close quarters.
“The next day we only went about three miles. The artillery got
some shells beautifully on to some Boers —about 200 —who were, I think,
lying in wait for an advance (which happened to be us); but it did not
come off as they wanted, for we found out that they were down there
and they got the shells in getting away. It was a fine bit of sport seeing
them go. Of course, they were all mounted, and it was a long range;
but I think some of them got knocked over. The next day (November
28) we went about eight miles, when there was a bit of shelling between
the Boer guns and ours. I suppose they wanted to find out what sort of
guns we had got. We heard they meant to make a big stand next day,
and it turned out to be correct. The ball opened when we had gone
about three miles. At 8 o’clock the New Zealanders were in advance,
and had 20 men knocked down in about half an hour. We occupied
a long front —about six miles—which made the firing line very thin, as


there were only about 1300 of ns for duty. The Boers occupied a very
commanding position (which I wish I could draw for you, but can’t)
1 hey were all along a rocky ridge, which was just below the grassy plain
on which we were, and they were out of sight. They were about 500
yards from our skyline, and were so situated that our big guns could not
be sighted on to them at all. We had to lie flat down all day till it was
dark. ihe firing was very heavy on both sides. We had 95 casualties,
and I think the Boers had more. They cleared out during the night.
Our own little lot, which consisted of Lewis, myself, and 30 men (the others
are all left behind at different places) only had one man slightly hit, and
he did not have to go to hospital.
I am afraid this letter is very Boerfied, but there is nothing else to
write about. I think it was young Adams who was doing a ‘skite’ about
me. He really gave me credit for what he did himself. He is a plucky
little fellow, and one of the best we have efot.”
Soon after this Major Lewis took fever, and the command devolved
upon Lieutenant Sale, who was now promoted Captain. Major Lewis
writes in “On the Veldt”: —“When I left the squadron at Rhenoster
Lieutenant Sale took up the command. . . . Sale was a reliable and
popular officer. His qualities were soldierly in the highest degree. His
constitution was apparently unwearable. In short, he was thoroughly
well qualified for the position he now assumed. He received promotion
to the rank of Captain for good work rendered” (p. 135).
Here follow some extracts from his letters while in command:—
‘‘Observation Hill, near Pretoria, January 16, 1901. —Since Christmas
we have been over a good lot of country. We have been going in lately
for rather quicker movements, taking a day’s food on the horses, and tw r o
days’ more on the Cape carts for the squadron. It means that only
one blanket each can be taken, so if it rains we have rather a wet time of
it. The men are kept pretty well on the go, and this constant trekking
soon reduces our numbers, and we pick up fresh men from the detail
camps. A lot of men have been getting enteric. I was in some of the
hospitals in Pretoria yesterday, and saw some of our men, also Captain
Lewis.”
“Hopetoun, Cape Colony, 24th February.—Came by train on the 3rd
from Balmoral to Naaupoort, and left there on the 9th on trek to block De
Wet, who has crossed into this colony. We had been going very hard since
we started, and I think he has got the biggest shaking up he ever had. We
got all his convoy, his two guns, and a lot of ammunition. The last day
before reaching here we went about 40 miles. He, of course, has a great
advantage over us. All the farmers seem to be Dutch, and he com-
mandeers, their horses, and so has pretty fresh remounts. We passed
some hundreds of horses they had ridden to a standstill. On the last day
we left camp at 5 a.m. Our lot was out on the left flank, and the country
was very rough and rocky. We were coveringg the ground between the
Orange River and the convoy. About 3 o’clock we had a bit of sniping,
but the Boers would not stand, and we went on till 8.30. I only brought


six men of our lot into camp; all the rest of the horses being knocked up.
Of course we had no transport or food, so just lay down with our horses
alongside till morning.
“The Victorian Bushmen had a great piece of luck, being on the right.
They had level ground and easy going. They got a bit ahead, and just
before camping came on to a Boer laager with their guns outspanned,
and the Boers cleared off and left them. We got about 80 prisoners
during the day. They seemed almost as much knocked up as we were,
and I have never seen them show so little fight. We go out again to-
morrow. I ought to say I have not missed a day so far. I applied to
the General for a fortnight’s spell for the men. They have, I believe,
been more constantly on the move than any other troops that have
been here, and I think they need it, and will get it when this trek is over.”
“Brandford, 12th March, 1901. —I wrote last from Hopetoun. We
came from railway station near that town (Orange River station) through
De Aar, on the branch line to Naauwport, and up to Springfontein. We
started from there towards Philopolis. In the first six days out we went
156 miles. We came through the town of Fauresmith, which was almost
deserted, and had some rather nice houses in it. We camped near it for a
couple of hours at midday. Our horses and mules were pretty well done
up. On last day’s trek into here we were rearguard, and counted 30 dead
horses and 50 mules that had died. We were to ; leave here this morning,
but it rained hard through the night, and we have not gone yet. About
10 o’clock we got orders to come into town, and the men are now camped
in the school-house. It is very crowded, but it is better than sleeping on
the veldt. ... I have about 50 men now, and have managed to get
them all horses and two to spare.”
The following letter from Corporal H. R. Reynolds, of Deloraine,
appeared in the “Examiner” of August 20, 1900: —“The Tassies under
Captain Lewis, Lieuts. Wylly and Sale, had the honour of leading the guns
into action. We received our baptism of fire with no disgrace. Corporal
Stocker was slightly wounded in the hand. After holding our position for
some time No. 3 troop, under Lieut. Sale, was ordered further to the right,
to drive back with the help of some Yeomanry a party of Boers on a kopje,
who were pouring a cross fire into our gunners. We advanced with
rushes, firing each time, until we were within 400 yards of them, when we
fixed bayonets and waited, under cover of a small kopje, to gain breath
for our final rush across a piece of clear veldt to the foot of a stronghold.
Our boys showed great spirit in advancing on the kopje, and they charged
into the stone enclosure in fine style, but while we were getting ready the
Boers had made off. Three of the Tassies, including the writer and some
of the Yeomanry, were the first on top of the rise, and great was the
disappointment when they had to unfix bayonets. The Boers retired on
all sides, leaving two dead, one dying, two badly wounded, and one or two
slightly hurt. Our boys took two or three prisoners. On continuing
our march we fell in with them again, and several shells came our way,
which made us duck our heads and then laugh at one another, the sensation


being very peculiar. Our guns then got to work on them, and then
retired under cover of our rifles. Then our warmest moments came, and
we had to retire under a cross fire from close range without any protection
whatever. Things got quite lively, and horses went down on all sides,
seven being shot, and others falling on the rough ground. Jim Shaw,
from Deloraine way, distinguished himself by returning under the worst
of the fire and taking up Trooper Littlejohn, whose horse was shot dead.
Lieut. Wylly was unfortunate in having his horse trip and fall. He had to
run for shelter for a couple of hundred yards under a severe fire. Trooper
Bisdee, Captain Lewis, Sergeant-Major Shegog, and Sergeant Stephens,
under cover of our fire, caught his horse and returned to meet him. As
soon as we found that Lieut. Wylly was not with us Troopers Bisdee and
Firth started back for him, and the latter was wounded as soon as he
showed himself above the bank. He was shot through the shoulder, and
the bullet went through his chest, just grazing his lung, but he is now
doing well. The Tommies did splendid work all day. We reached
Lindley at 9.30 p.m. that day with the convoy, much to the surprise of the
garrison. They were on short rations, and did not expect us. The next
day we went out after three trucks, but did not see much of the Boers. A
few fired on our scouts from a farmhouse, but did no damage. Then
our guns got to work on the farm, and 20 Tassies were sent to take it, but
the birds had flown. We hunted the house, but did not have time to
get away with any stock or remounts, as a party of Boers were seen
advancing towards us. We got back to Lindley all safe with about 2000
sheep and a lot of cattle. On Saturday we went with the convoy on its
way back to Kroonstad, about 16 iffiles, arriving about 5 p.m. At 11 p.m.
we saddled up and returned to Lindley, arriving at 5 a.m. on Sunday.
General Paget, from Lindley, and General Clements, attacked the Boers
and drove them back from this place. All the Australian Imperial Horse
were out except us, and as our horses had done an extra amount of scouting
we did not go. On Monday a general advance was made from Lindley
towards Bethlehem, General Clements advancing in the same direction,
away on our right. Heavy fighting took place all day, driving the Boers
slowly before us. On Tuesday they made a stand, and gave our boys
plenty of work. A captain and lieutenant of the Artillery were killed,
and two gunners wounded. Two guns were lost for some moments, but
the C.I.R. Artillery got the range, and did very good work in preventing
the Boers using the gun. The Australians, Remington Scouts, and
Imperial Yeomanry gallantly recaptured them.”
Writing from Pretoria (says the “Examiner” of October 10, 1901),
Trooper John Whitmore, of Derby, a member of the Bushmen’s Contin-
gent, reports himself well. He got over a mild attack of enteric, and
since then has seen some heavy fighting, and undergone some severe
hardships. “On leaving the hospital,” he writes, “I was nine days on
patrol duty, sleeping on the ground at night with only one blanket, and
the regulation overcoat —not much covering to keep out the terrible
night frosts we have here. Not a spark of fire was allowed to be lighted.


This and an empty stomach, or nearly so, for the allowance of two biscuits
a day can hardly be called a ‘blow out,’ is no fun. During this time I
experienced the unpleasant sensation of being fired at, and two shots came
that close that I had to feel round myself to see if I was hit or not.
We have just rolled ourselves into our blankets when the order is roared
out, ‘Stand to your horses!' Then ‘Saddle,’ and away we have to go, and
likely enough march until 9 the next night, and little to eat to keep the
strength up. Lucky we are, too, if we get water. For weeks at a time
I have not had enough to wash my face. We look sometimes so ragged
and dirty our mothers would not own us.”
Following this bright letter, in the same column of the “Examiner,”
are these two items of interest:—
“A NASTY ACCIDENT.
“Trooper R. Guest, of Evandale, reports having met with an accident
while the Bushmen were on their way to relieve Baden-Powell at Rusten-
burg. Guest, with some others, was galloping to cut off four Boers,
when his horse fell in a rocky creek, and came down on top of him. The
horse had to be shot, and Guest was carried to the ambulance, and
subsequently taken to No. 2 hospital, at Pretoria, whence he wrote on
August 26. He speaks in high terms of the treatment in hospital. Guest,
describing a tight corner he was in with another Tasmanian and 18 New
Zealanders, says that out of five who were lying together he was the only
one to escape unwounded, and he had a narrow squeak, getting a slight cut
under the eye with a bullet, just deep enough to fetch blood.”
“BOER CHARACTERISTICS.”
Trooper Louis Lette, of the Tasmanian Bushmen's Contingent, thus
describes the Boers who were captured by General Hunter on the Basuto-
land border, and of whom he was one of the guards:—“We were five days
travelling with them. They are a queer lot. I saw a good bit of them,
and was in their camp nearly every night. They start singing towards
evening, and sing nearly all night. We are mounted now on their horses
and saddles. They are splendid hacks. Most of them will amble eight
miles an hour, and are used to the climate.”
The following letter from W. Wadley, who did noble work at the death
of Sale and Walter, and afterwards died of enteric fever, is of considerable
interest from its quaint simplicity. I have printed it as written. To
correct the spelling and grammar w r ould take away its charm: —
“Bindley, Friday, 29th March, 1900. —My dear Mother and Father, —
lam not very well at present. I have a very bad cold, but still I hope
you are all well at home. I have herd nothing about Tassy sence I left,
but there is no place like it. Mother, I don't think it is any use writing
back to me, because I might never get them. None of us as received any
letters from Tassy yet, but we might get them all in a heap before long.
Father, I enjoyed myself were the battles has been. We land at Port


Elizabeth, and was in the train for 3 days and 4 nights, and the nights
were very cold without any beding, and in a cattle truck at that, about
40 of us. I was one of the first to go with the horses. We stoped about
4 times to feed all the way through, we fed at Cradock twice feed Spring-
fontein, and Blomfontein, and then we went through to Kronstad were we
got off all about the line was nothing but graves and dead horses were
the battle as been fort the British has got a wooden cross to there graves.
Mother We left Kronstad on Sunday the 24th for the front that was to get
a convoy into Bindley which we did after a good fight. We marched all
Sunday till about 12 o’clock at night without anything to eat or drink.
I was one of the scouts that day and I came across about 150 dead horses
in one heap and they was a little ripe to. We did not go far the next
day Monday we started about 4 o’clock in the morning and marched
till about 1 in the afternoon and prepared ourselves for battle because one
of the scouts got fired at a few miles in front of us. We got up about
3 in the morning and Tuesday and before the frost was off the grass they
was firing at us we cut in all directions because we was all in a heap
the bullets going very close pass me but they did not hit me. 1 was
alongside of a man when he got his horse shot in the shoulder and another
one of our horses got shot through the jaws but the big guns was soon
fixed and very soon sent them ticking they was all around us, but we
very soon drove them away, there was about 20 boars in a stone yard
pouring the bullets into about 30 of us and we was doing the same at them
but they had the best shooting because we was on the flat and them on a
hill all the cover we had was crawing from one ant hill to another we
sneaked up to about 400 yards of them and they was still firing at us and
then we got orders to fix bayonets and when they saw them they was
soon on there horses and away I saved the buts of the first bidet I fired
at them. The big guns nocked a few over we was fighting pretty well
all day on a drink of water and a hard biscuts, there is about 3000 of us
all together. We camped again about 8 o’clock that night and up again
about 4 Oc The Tassy’s was the rearguard of the Convoy on Wednesday
and after we was on the march for about 4 or 5 hours the boars come up
on the left side of us and in to us but we very soon scouted for shelter for
our horses and then doubled back and in to them we sent them back again
after a few shots. And after we got on our horses again and got going
nicely again there was a good big force come up at the back of us and my
word they sent the bidets at us very thick and quick, they was coming
that close to me I was bobing my head we was in a good place for them
we had to gallop for about half a mile for shelter and they was flying after
us all the way they only shot 4 horses and wounded one man they carat
shut a little bit. The Sergeant I was batman for had his horse shot dead
and the captain’s horse was wounded and died the next night which made
the fifth. I was not the last into cover I kided myself (? pretended)
I was racing, so I let my horse out to his prettyest, we dismounted and
doubled back at them but we did not fire many shots before we had to
fly to our horses again and get a better possion at them so it was another
gallop up a hill and they made good of us while they could see us firing all


the time they was curing the dust up all around us but hit nothing
going up the hill. We got in a fine place at them and we got at them
pretty strong and they was still letting go at us but when the big gun went
off they were soon shut up. They are very good with the big guns they
can drop the shells were they like the (y) make a big dust after they burst.
We got in to Lmdley that night about 10 Oc. We had to go back the next
day and gather some stock we had another bit of a fight but the big gun
wound them up there was a lot of cattle brought in and sheep we got
orders to kill a sheep or two for our selves and I was not long before I
had a piece on the pan. We have not been out at all to-day and the days
rest has been very well excepted because my cold was winding me
up I got some stuff for it to-day and it is getting better. Tell Hardman
that I have no more paper to write to him but you can tell him that it
is splendid glazing land the grass in places is over my knees. It would
be terribly lonely over here on a farm. Father I hope you are getting
on all right with your work. give my love to Biddy and tell her the latest
or let her read this letter and Ada the same. I think we are off again
to-morrow, remember me to all about. I feel satisfied now I have had a
scap and it is the same as the other men used to say that it hant all beer
and skittles but a drop of beer would be well excepted. Excuse bad
writing and mistakes as lam not in very good form. So I will finish
in wishing yon are all well. I remain your Son W. Wadlev.”
Trooper A. A. Johnstone’s Notes.
1 retoria told of a city in distress when one sees the wrecked buildings
and the troops everywhere one looks. Pretoria has some very nice
buildings in it, but the town itself has a very rusty appearance, like all the
other Dutch towns. Here we marched past Lord Roberts. The great
General, accompanied by his wife and daughter and his staff, came down
to the gate of his grounds, and at the word “Walk, march” we all marched
past, and on about a mile. We saw the rest of General Paget’s Brigade,
all making active preparations to move out. The General said we had to
move off with him straightaway, which we accordingly did, out to Wonder-
boompoort that night, and I remember well it was a bitter, cold night,
and as hard a frost as ever I saw in 1 asmania. This was our first night
in the Transvaal. It was a little different to the open veldt, which we
became accustomed to in the Orange River Colony. It is a much broken
country, with ranges of hills and valleys. Next morning we had reveille,
4 a.m., and we Tassies had to take advance guard out to Waterval. After
going five miles we came on to the enemy. They had taken up a position
■on the top of a kopje. I suppose there were about two hundred of them.
They retired when they saw us advancing. We went up to the hill,
and could see them on another hill about three thousand yards off. Our
captain sent a rider back to General Paget to report Boers ahead, and he
sent the guns up to cover our retreat. While we advanced to them the?
opened fire on us when we got about one thousand yards off them, and

FIRST TASMANIAN IMPERIAL BUSHMEN’S CONTINGENT AT MESS-


we dismounted and gave our horses over to the horse-holders. Then we
advanced on foot for a little way, and took what cover we could, and
hred at them, when they opened fire with a Long Tom on us, and then
our guns started on them, and soon drove them off. Then we advanced
again, only to get into it hotter still. The bullets were whistling round
my head, and I fully expected to be hit every second, but we kept returning
the fire as fast as we could, when our guns again opened on them. Then
there was an artillery duel for about two hours, when the Boers cleared,
and we got on to W aterval and camped. Our casualties were four
wounded, they being Yeomanry. I thanked my lucky stars that night.
Here we received our first mail of letters since landing in South Africa.
They were sent out after us with the convoy which followed after us from
Pretoria, and we were all very pleased to hear from home, as we had been
in South Africa then four months.
August 21. —Reveille 2 a.m.; so we had very little rest that night. We
marched in the darkness from Waterval nine miles, then halted and waited
for daylight. As soon as it became light we could see Boers ahead, and
we Tassies were put in advance, and after going two miles further towards
a Kaffir kraal the Boers opened fire on us, and we had no cover, with the
exception of a few rocks here and there, behind which we took cover as
well as we could, and opened fire on them. Then the pom-pom galloped up
and opened fire, and the Boers brought ther guns into action, and fired at
us, and then we were fairly at it for eight hours. After we had driven
the Boers off General Baden-Powell, with his Brigade, ioined our column.
Then he took the advance with his men. They were mostlv Australians,
who had won favour with that General at Elands River battle after the relief
of Hafeking. \\ e trekked on till dusk that evening; then camped. We
were now 5000 strong with the two columns.
August 22. —On again. We were advance this day, and the country
was flat, with very few hills. This starts what is called the Bushveldt. It
is all thorny bushes, something like a gooseberry bush, onlv the thorns are
much longer and thicker. We had a terrible job to get our horses
through this place, as they did not like the thorns at all, and when we got
through the thickest our horses' legs were all over blood. We now arrive
at Pienaars River, on the Pietersburg line. The railway bridge over the
river was blown to pieces by the Boers, thus stopping the supply train from
crossing until the bridge was reconstructed. Here we halted for half an
hour, then on again six miles, and camped. We had only two hard biscuits
each served out that night, and that had to do us until the next night. I
ate one that night, and kept the other till next morning; then ate it, and
had to go till night before I could get any more, and when I did get some
the next night it was only half a one, as they only had one biscuit between
two men. and could get no more until the supply train caught us up.
August 25. —On again 25 miles march to Warm Baths. Here we had
another scrap with the Boers, and captured a part of their train just leaving
Warm Baths and some prisoners. Here Cooper was badly wounded in
the thigh. Here we found on the captured train four tons of flour, and


we all took some, and that night we had a good fill. I made some jepaties
with flour and water. They were not the best, but they went down all
right, and I had a good sleep that night. We stayed here two days, then
went on to Nylestroom with General 8.-P. On our way to this place Lew
Butcher was wounded. We were away two clays, then returned to Warm
Baths on the 28th August. That night we had to dig trenches, as we
were expecting an attack, but it never came off until September 4, which I
will tell you later on.
September 1. —Out on patrol, 20 of us Tasmanians, under Lieutenant
Wylly, and 20 of the Army Service Corps under Captain Brookes. We
went through one of the passes into the Warm Baths ranges, and after
going through the pass we went about two miles. There were four
Tasmanians sent in advance, and the guide, Eddie Cooper. I was one of
the other 15 just behind the four in advance, and the other 20 men in our
rear, about 500 yards. We came to a donga, and I then saw a small
piece of wood smoking just on the bank of the donga. I said to Sergeant
Shaw, “The Boers are close here. Look at that piece of wood there a-
smoking.” I said, “Those four ahead couldn't have seen it. ' Just then
the crack of a rifle, and 50 more perhaps, when Sergeant Shaw said,
“Dismount, men, and take cover.” Just then Captain Brookes's horse
came galloping back, and Lieut. Wylly said, “Get out of this, men; they are
heavily entrenched on both sides of us.” Just then Captain Brookes
came running as well as he could. He was badly wounded through the
right shoulder. We mounted our horses with the speed of lightning and
galloped out. Here Bisdee jumped off his horse, and Captain Brookes
got on by Bisdee’s help; then Bisdee jumped up behind him, and galloped
out of the rifle range with the rest of us. The bullets were cutting up the
dust just like a hailstorm. In getting out Trooper Willoughby was
wounded in the left thigh, and fell from his horse. Lieut. Wylly jumped
off and picked him up, and put him on in front of him, and Lieut. Wylly
himself was slightly wounded in the left arm, also Sergeant Shaw was
slightly wounded, and Corporal Brown was wounded through the right
ankle, and his brother, Jeff Brown, was wounded and taken prisoner by the
Boers. After we had galloped out of rifle range we pulled up to help
the wounded, and after tying something on their wounds as best we could
we made off as fast as we could to get out of the pass before the Boers
could cut us off, and just as we passed through the pass the Boers mounted
the hill and fired at us, but we had got well out of rifle range then, and we
made all haste to camp. I often think of that day (September 1, 1900).
It was a narrow squeak with all of us. The bullets seemed to crack like
whips; they were nearly all explosives they were using that day. Back to
camp, the news soon spread all round, and we had many enquiring as to
our day’s adventure. This was where the two V.C.’s were earned by
Lieut. Wylly and J. H. Bisdee, both members of the First Tasmanian
Imperial Bushmen.
September 2. —We had a rest, and September 3 we Tassies were
sent out reconnoitring, and, not seeing anything startling, we


returned to camp at 2 p.m,, and at 3 p.m. the Boers opened on our
camp with their guns, and gave us a lively time for about two hours. We
had to stand to arms all night. Next morning at daybreak the Boers put
their shells again into our camp, and this state lasted all day. They put
between 80 and 90 shells into the camp, with very little damage, only
killing two men. That night the enemy retreated, and next day we
stayed in camp till 6 p.m.; then trekked all night back towards Pretoria,
and reached Pienaar's River at 6 a.m. next morning. Halted here to
feed horses and mules; then on again at 8 p.m., trekked all night to a
place called Kaffir’s Kraal, which place we reached at daybreak next
morning. Stayed there for one hour’s rest, then on again to Waterval, and
pitched camp to have a rest, which we all needed badly enough. We
stayed here for five days, then left Waterval en route for Heilbron.
Reached Heilbron that day, and next day on again to Crocodile River,
and went out burning farmhouses down, and had a little fighting with the
enemy; then returned to Waterval on September 19. Stayed there two
days, and we were all refitted out with whatever we wanted in the line of
saddlery. Then on again to Waggon Drift and Silverton, at which place
we met General Paget’s Brigade. Here we captured 40 prisoners with
waggons, cattle, and sheep after a little fighting. We stayed here one
night, and next morning we Tassies were sent out on patrol. The Boers
opened fire on us, killing one horse —Trooper Mace’s. The same day we
followed them up to Sybrandt’s Kraal. This is where Erasmus’s home
stead is, one of the Boer Generals. Here we found 20 waggons loaded
with Boer women, whom the Boers left behind them in their flight. We
halted here a little while. Here Erasmus came in under the white flag to
see the General as to terms of surrender, and General Paget gave him five
days’ armistice to ascertain if President Kruger had left the country, and
during the five days we had to stand fast; that is to say, we were not to
move out of certain bounds during that time. We had a programme of
sports of different kinds, and passed the time away in that manner. After
the five days we had heard nothing of Erasmus, so had orders to move on
the 6th by moonlight to Sibera's Craal [Sybrandt’s Kraal ?]. After trek-
king eight miles came on to Boers’ outpost, and drove them off, and went
on to Craal. Halted till daylight; then on, and overtook the Boers
just as they got into the Warm Bath ranges. This part of the country
was too rough to follow them in. We then returned due south to
Reitsfontein. Here we encountered the enemy again, and had two more
of our men wounded—Troopers Smith and Flemming. We followed them
up, fighting them every day for four days. We then ran out of provisions,
and had to return towards Pretoria, and camped eight miles outside
Pretoria, and while here we heard that the first Tasmanian Contingent,
under Major Cameron, were camped in Pretoria. I got permission off
Captain Lewis, with several others, to go in to see them. They looked a
lot of wrecks. They were then about to leave for home. After getting
supplies on our convoy we trekked about the North-Western Transvaal,
for six or seven weeks, having skirmishes with the enemy nearly everv
other day up to the 29th November, 1900, when we had a general engage-


ment with the Boers at Rheinoster Kop. We mustered about 4500 men,,
and the Boers’ strength was supposed to be 7000. The advance was made
at 5 a.m., and at 6 a.m. the Boers opened fire on us. We held a firing line
of seven miles, and we were in the open veldt with no cover at all, only the
long veldt grass, while the Boers were heavily entrenched and behind rocks..
This fight lasted 17 hours without ceasing, and we failed to move their
positions, and about 11 o'clock at night their firing stopped, although we
lined for about seven miles along the Boers’ left during the night. British
casualties amounted to 280 killed and wounded. Next morning at day-
break we were sent out skirmishing around till 2 p.m.; then returned to the
main body and camped for the night. Next day we were out again, and
had a little fighting, and returned to camp. It now became the Tassies’
turn to have a little rest; so we stayed in camp for three days. On
December 5 we Tassies were sent out on patrol in the morning, and we
found the Boers were trying for an attack, so we returned to camp and
reported to General Plumer.
December 6.—A1l hands digging trenches ready for an attack by
enemy.
December 7. —We had to stand to arms from 4 a.m. till 8 p.m., and in.
trenches all that night. Next day the same thing, but no attack was
made.
December 9. —Moved off at 4 a.m. 12 miles further east towards
Oliphant’s River. Here we had a little fighting for six hours; then the
Boers retreated, and at 5 p.m. we Tassies were sent out on outpost all
night.
December 10. —We were out on patrol, and had a little fighting; then
back to camp at 4 p.m. Had orders to move at 12 o’clock, moon rise.
The Boers were supposed to shell our camp at daybreak, so we moved
back to Rietsfontein and camped there. Here we stayed for a few days
to stop the Boers from crossing back towards Pretoria.
December 16.—1 was sent out with 50 Queenslanders to capture Boers’
outpost. When the Boers found we were coming on to them they
mounted their horses and galloped away, I being one of four men on the
extreme right, which the Boers had to pass. We dismounted as they gal-
loped by us at a distance of about 800 yards, and fired at them, killing
one horse and wounding one of the Boers; then we mounted our horses,
and took after the other four. We captured three of them, but the fourth
man had a very fast horse, and we could not catch him, so had to return
with the other three and the wounded Boer to camp, and handed them over
to General Paget. We stayed at Reitsfontein for four days, when I
took that most dreaded enteric fever.
December 21, 1900. —I was taken into field hospital at Reitsfontein.
Had eight days there; then I was sent in ox waggon to Bronkerspruit sta-
tion, a distance of 80 miles. I was then put into the train with 70 more
sick men, and sent to Pretoria, where we were admitted into No. 2 General
Hospital. I was put into the enteric wards, and did not know any more
for six days. When I came to my senses again, I began to realise my


position. They were burying the dead at the rate of 20 men daily, all
dying with enteric fever, and I made up my mind to kick against it as
well as I could, and lam glad to say that I pulled through all right. After
being in hospital 14 weeks, the doctors let me go out of hospital into the
Australian detail camp at Dasport, just outside Pretoria. Here I found
out where my contingent were; they were then at Pietersburg; and I, with
some more Australians, was sent up to join them, and when we arrived
at Pietersburg there were no horses to mount us on, so we could not
join our men there. It was at this place where Lieutenant Walters and
Captain Sale were killed. We were then sent back by train to Pretoria,
where we stayed doing garrison duty till May 28th, 1901, when we left
Pretoria by train to Standerton, arrived at Standerton, May 29th, and went
into camp next day. We were fitted out with horses and saddles, and
on June 1, 1901, we left Standerton with General Plumer's column to
trek back to Pietretief. Arrived at Pietretief on June 9. We were
fighting all the way along. Left General Plumer's column here, and we
Australians of the First Imperial Bushmen were now under orders for
home. So we had to trek with empty convoy to Utrecht, and after
travelling for nine hours came to Piet River. This is the place where
the Zulus cut the British up during the Zulu War. We camped here
for the night; then on again next morning, through the Drakensburg
Mountains, and arrived at Utrecht on June 18. This place is a small
village, with about three hundred inhabitants. On this trek we had
fighting every day, more or less. We stayed at Utrecht two days.
June 21. —On again to New Castle, crossing the Buffalo River. This
river is the border between the Transvaal and Natal. Arrived at New
Castle June 22. Here we handed over our horses and equipment.
June 23. —We left New Castle by train for East London; passed
Ingogo, just under Majuba Hill, and through the tunnel under Laing’s
Nek, where there was some heavy fighting in the early part of the war.
Arrived at Stormberg, where General Gatacre had his reverse, and lost
so heavily. Here we mobilised on the 29th June, and left again for East
London July 4th. Arrived at East London July sth, and boarded the
transport “Britannic,” and steamed out for Australia, July 6th, 1901. We
had a very rough trip all the way to Albany, and after stopping there two
days continued on to Tasmania. We arrived home in the early part of
August, 1901. For myself, I shall never regret my experiences on the veldt.
THE RETURNING BUSHMEN.
RECEPTION AT MELBOURNE.
TASMANIANS DUE AT LAUNCESTON THIS MORNING.
Melbourne, Tuesday.—The troops were landed from the “Britannic”
this morning in bright, pleasant weather, and carried by train to Spencer-
street. They marched from there via Collins and Swanston streets to
the Victoria Barracks, where they were entertained at lunch and warmly


welcomed. The Tasmanian section sailed during the afternoon by the
“Coogee” for Launceston.
THE RECEPTION ARRANGEMENTS.
Hobart, Tuesday—Captain Collins, the Victorian Secretary of Defence,
has wired to the Premier that the Tasmanian troops left by the “Coogee”
to-day. When they reach Launceston arrangements similar to those made
when the last troops arrived will be followed. The troops will leave
Launceston on Thursday morning shortly after 9 o’clock for Hobart.
WELCOMING THE TROOPS TO LAUNCESTON.
TO-DAY'S ARRANGEMENTS.
The Tasmanian soldiers who arrived in Melbourne by the s.s. “Bri-
tannic,” in company with a large body of troops belonging to the various
states returning from the South African campaign, are expected to come
across from the seat of the Federal Government in the “Coogee” this
morning, landing at about noon.
The Tasmanian officers on the “Britannic” were Captain Lewis, Lieu-
tenants Page, Reynolds, and Williams. The list of the non-commissioned
officers and men comprised;—Sergeant-Majors Cracknell and Shegog,
Sergeants Townley, Stephens, Summers, Gerrand, H. T, Davis, Brewer,
Farrier-Sergeant Hutton, Corporals Barwise, Ward, Brownell, Rye, Farrier
Bellette.
Troopers Blackaby, A. M. Brown, Berenck, Bridley, Burbury, Cliff,
Crawford, Costello, Cooper, Crosby, Dudfield, Eddy, Ferguson, Firth,
Geeves, Gardiner, Garrott, Guest, Green, Gleeson, Hayes, Heyne,.
Humphreys, Hodgkinson, C. A. J. Johnstone, A. A. Johnstone, Jackson,,
Keogh, Kenworthy, King, Litchfield, Littlejohn, M‘Leod, McGuire, O’May,
Shields, Skinner, Storey, Walker, Williams, Whitmore, Willoughby,
Whelan, Westbrook.
Lance-Corporal Harrison and Trooper Hood (Tasmanian Bushmen),
and Trooper Hart (of the last Imperial Contingent) were also on board.
The Mayor (Alderman F. K. Fairthorne) late yesterday afternoon
received a telegram from the Chief Secretary (Mr. G. T. Collins), advising
him of the expected arrival and sojourn of the troops in Launceston until
to-morrow, when, if necessary, a special train would be provided for their
transportation to Hobart. The shortness of the notice, however, and
a number of prior engagements, precluded the Mayor from making the
arrangements which he would have liked for the reception of the troops,
and he wired to this effect to the Minister. At the same time, he promised
to give Captain Lewis and his company as hearty a welcome as possible
under the circumstances. It is understood that the Mayor and aldermen
will board the “Coogee” on her arrival, and, on behalf of the citizens, wel-
come the soldiers back to Tasmania. Afterwards, if it can be conveniently
arranged, the troops will be invited to meet the Mayor and aldermen at
the Town Hall. In the afternoon the soldiers will be entertained at the
concert for the Barnardo Homes.

RETURNING SOLDIERS.
WELCOMED AT HOBART.
Hobart, Thursday.—A special train, with the returned members of the
Tasmanian Imperial Bushmen Contingent, arrived from Launceston this
afternoon. The troops were warmly welcomed at the station by the
Administrator (Sir John Dodds), Ministers, and friends. Greetings over,
the men fell in, and, headed by the Garrison Band, marched through the
principal streets to the Town Hall, being cheered en route by thousands of
spectators, who occupied every possible position from which a good view
could be obtained. Going down Macquarie -street, Captain Lewis was
seized by some of his old comrades, who hoisted him shoulder high, and
conveyed him in that position to the Town Hall, which was crowded
beyond its standing capacity.
The Acting-Mayor (Alderman Smith) presided, and in a few well-
chosen words welcomed Captain Lewis and his men back to Tasmania,
at the same time eulogising the good work performed by them.
The Premier (Mr. N. E. Lewis) who was received with cheers, said
that, on behalf on the Government and the people of Tasmania, he desired
to offer to Captain Lewis and his gallant band a most hearty welcome home
to Tasmania. She sent them away some 14 months ago, wishing them
God-speed, and now they were glad to have them back again. had
secured high honours, obtaining two Victoria Crosses, and several D.S.O's.
Lieutenant Wvlly had been decorated at the hands of the King, and
Lieutenant Bisdee had returned to Soutn Africa to try and add yet another
LIEUTENANT G. E. WYLLY, V.C.
LIEUTENANT J. H. BISDEE, V.C.


clasp to his honours. (Cheers.) On occasions like that, however, their
sympathies should naturally go out to the fathers and mothers of those
who had gone down while discharging their duty. That Contingent alone
had lost six, but those who had now returned had raised the prestige of
Tasmania. (Prolonged cheers.)
Mr. G. T. Collins said, as one who had been closely allied with the
Defence Force for many years, he desired to endorse what had been said by
previous speakers. The contingent had more work to do than any other
that had left Tasmania. (Cheers.) Captain Lewis and his men had
followed the good example that had been set them by Major Cameron—
(loud cheers) —with the result that there was not a black mark against any
man sent away. (Cheers.) He joined with the Premier in sympathising
with the fathers and mothers of those who would not return. The men
had returned covered with glory, and he hoped they might be long spared
to enjoy good health and prosperity.
Colonel Legge (Commandant), also, on behalf of the Defence Force,
welcomed Captain Lewis and his men back to Tasmania. The members
of the Contingent would always be remembered because of the good work
done by them. He trusted the men would be able to get back to their
usual avocations, and suffer no evil effects from their experiences in South
Africa.
Mrs. Benson sang “Home, Sweet Home,” with organ accompaniments
by Mr. Haywood.
Captain Lewis, on rising to respond, was received with deafening
cheers, and when order was restored he said the song just rendered he
heard sung on the veldt under most trying circumstances, causing tears
to flow copiously from many a manly eye. The welcome accorded to
himself and men he highly appreciated. It was worth going to South
Africa in order to receive such welcome on their return home, although
one did not always think so. He thanked the men under him for the
readiness with which their services were rendered on all occasions. He
also thanked those responsible for the selection of such a capable body
of men.
The proceedings concluded by the singing of the National Anthem,
after which the majority of the men attended a thanksgiving service at St.
David’s Cathedral, and during the evening were entertained at a social at
the Town Hall. —(August i, 1901.)
SEVERAL OF THE SOLDIERS SUFFERING FROM MEASLES.
Hobart, Friday.—Captain Lewis, who only returned to-day from South
Africa with the Tasmanian Imperial Contingent, has developed measles,
and is now confined to bed. Charles Jackson, of Hamilton, another
member, is similarly attacked, and suffering from a chill, has been removed
to the hospital. It is feared other members will be likewise stricken.


AUSTRALIAN CASUALTIES.
TWO TASMANIANS KILLED.
London, Friday morning.—Lieutenant F. G. Hum, of the West Aus-
tralian Bushmen, and J. C. Rose, of the New Zealand Rough Riders, have
been discharged from hospital, and resumed duty.
Corporal W. C. Lawlie, of the New Zealand Mounted Infantry, has
been severely wounded, and Private William Fraser, of the Tasmanian
Bushmen, has been killed at Pietersburg.
Lieutenant A. Sale, who was severely wounded at Pietersburg, has
succumbed to his injuries.
OFFICIAL INTIMATION OF THE SAD NEWS.
Hobart, Friday.—The Administrator (Sir John Dodds) has received
the following cable from the Governor of Cape Town;—“ April n, Lieu-
tenant C. H. Walter killed near Pietersburg on April 8; Lieutenant Arnold
Sale, died from wounds received near Pietersburg, April 9.”
The Chief Secretary (Mr. G. T. Collins, M.L.C.) sent a telegram to
a friend of the late Lieutenant Walter, asking him to break the news
to Mr. Walter of his son's death, and also to Mr. Sale, intimating the
sad news, and expressing the sympathy of Ministers at the unfortunate
occurrence.
Both lieutenants went to South Africa with the Tasmanian section ot
the Imperial Australian Bushmen, which left Hobart under the command
of Captain R. C. Lewis, on April 26, 1900.
Lieutenant Arnold Arthur Sale, who was 30 years of age, was a son
of Mr. J. Townsend Sale, of St. Leonards, who was for many years
manager of the Union Bank of Australia at Launceston. He was a fine,
manly young fellow, and greatly esteemed by a large circle of friends.
The deceased received the fatal wounds in an engagement at Pietersburg,
when Colonel Plumer made a rapid advance on the town.
Lieutenant Walter’s parents reside at Caulfield, near Melbourne. He
was 24 years of age, and well and favourably known in shipping circles;
and when he enlisted as a trooper in the contingent he was engaged as
purser on the s.s. “Wareatea,” trading between Launceston and Strahan,
Being a good horseman, a fine shot, and having a natural aptitude for
military duties, he quickly passed through the ranks, and was appointed
to a lieutenancy shortly before the departure of the contingent.
The cable message also states that Private William Fraser, of the
Tasmanian Bushmen, was also killed, but no such name appears in the
lists of the contingents.
A GUN FOR TASMANIA.
Hobart, Wednesday.—Captain Lewis, D.5.0., prior to leaving South
Africa wrote to the Chief of Staff, Pretoria, for a Maxim gun to be


given to Tasmania, the capture of which was cine to the following Tas-
manians ; —Lieutenant Stocker (then acting-sergeant), Corporal Kenny
Ward, Troopers Bnrbnry, O’May, Firth, Skinner, Crawford, Hamilton,
King, and A. Hayes. The following answer has been received by Captain
Lewis: —“ The General commanding-in-chief regrets he is unable to comply
with this request at present, as the gun is serviceable, and is consequently
required for use. A note will, however, be made of this application, and,
if possible, this particular gun will be presented to Tasmania at the con-
clusion of hostilities. By order (signed), John Heaslam, D.A.A.G., for
the Colonel on the staff.”
POM-POM FOR TASMANIA.
Fhe Hon. the Premier has received a despatch from the Agent-
General, notifying him that a pom-pom gun has been awarded Tasmania
as a trophy of the South African war, and in commemoration of the part
played by Fasmanians in the capture of a gun at Olifant’s River in April,
1901. The Agent-General has also informed the Premier that 15 guns
and 2500 rifles and carbines are available for distribution among the
colonies that sent contingents to the South African war, but at the time
of his writing no decision had been arrived at as to the allotment of the
same. The Agent-General will undertake the transmission of the pom-
pom.—4/3/04.

DEPARTURE OF THE TASMANIAN CONTINGENTS.
Hobart, Wednesday.—The departure of the troopship “Chicago” to-day
was shorn very much of animation by reason not alone of the troopers
who had preceded her, but by the fact that she had been delayed over
three weeks through quarantine regulations, coaling necessities, loading,
and the like. However, there was a spicy interest observable. The
camp at Newtown was broken up before 8 a.m., and an hour later the
Tasmanian contingent, headed by the Garrison Band, marched down
Elizabeth-street, up Liverpool-street, and to the transport, by way of
Murray-street. Some hundreds of people had congregated on the line of
route, and before the troops had lined and been given general leave to
dismiss to their various quarters, they were besieged by female and mre
friends. In some instances affectionate farewells were given, but, taken
all round, there was a gay scene of hilarity in the fact. This was intensified
by the troopers scaling every coign of vantage, and good-humouredly
waving their adieux. The transport moved off from the wharf shortly
before I o’clock, and was accompanied down the river by steam tenders
and a host of sailing and rowing boats. After the men returned from
general leave they were formed into a hollow square, when Mr. B. S. Bird
(Treasurer), on behalf of the Ministry, addressed the officers and men
conveying the best wishes of the people of Tasmania for their success and
safe return. He referred to the good work the previous contingents had
done, and hoped that the present Tasmanian Contingent would render an
equally good account of themselves. At the request of the officers of
the First Battalion Tasmanian Infantry Regiment, he presented Lieutenant-
Colonel Watchorn with a handsome pair of field glasses, a suitable in-
scription accompanying the same. Lieutenant-Colonel Watchorn suitably
replied, and in doing so made special reference to the exceptional conduct
of the men under his command, and their willingness to carry out their
duties. During the forenoon Lieutenant-Colonel Watchorn received a
telegram from Lieutenant-Colonel Legge (commandant of the Tasmanian
Defence Force), now attending the Defence Conference in Sydney, bearing
testimony to the conduct of the contingent, to which Lieutenant-Colorel
Watchorn replied: —“Your valedictory telegram received; many thanks;
read out on parade, and much appreciated.”
THE TRANSPORT “CHICAGO.”
A LETTER FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WATCHORN.
Hobart, Wednesday.—The Premier (Mr. N. E. Lewis, M.H.A.) has
received the following letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Watchorn, dated


from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, April 23 : —“We arrived here on the
20th, having experienced strong head winds for the past five days, conse-
quently we ran short of coal. The captain put in here for 100 tons. Our
men arrived safely and well and in the best of spirits, with the exception
of 279, Private Hart, who has had typhoid; also one of the ship’s crew.
Private Blyth (258) fell and broke his leg on board while taking part in
an obstacle race. All sick were landed to-day and taken to the military
hospital here. The men disembark to-morrow to entrain in the afternoon.
We are told that our percentage of loss was small, losing only five horses
—three from colic, and two from old age (both being over 20). I found
that the feeding required very strict supervision and constant attention.
I had to stop the allowance of oats altogether. Sergeants Wingfield and
Devitt deserve special mention for their untiring energy and attention to
the horses in the absence of a vet. The conduct of all on board the
“Chicago” has been good, and I have every reason to believe we shall give
a good account of ourselves.”

A HOT ENGAGEMENT.
THE DEATH OF PRIVATE WARBURTON.
Mr. F. C. Brooks, of the Royal Oak Hotel, has received a couple of
letters from his son, Private G. R. Brooks, of the Second Tasmanian
Imperial Contingent. From the first letter, written from Craddock camp,
on April 28, the following extracts are made: —
“Since I last wrote, we landed at Port Elizabeth, and as soon as we
landed they issued to us rifles, bayonets, and another bandolier. They
gave us a dinner in the afternoon, and then we got aboard the train. They
told us that in five hours' time we would be amongst the Boers, and we
had to keep our rifles loaded, but nothing occurred. We were all day
and a night and part of the next day in the train, and Craddock, where we
left the train, is 184 miles inland. It is a very pretty little Dutch town,
situated in a gully. We have been camped here four days, and are to be
attached to Colonel Hay's flying column. The Boers are reported to
be within ten miles, and we have patrols out among the hills every night.
There was a skirmish here two days before we came. Eight of Brabant’s
Horse were captured while out on patrol. We are having a good time;
guard is the worst part about it, as we don't get much sleep. We have
all been supplied with English cavalry saddles, and they are much better
than our own. We have no tents; just a blanket or a sheet for shelter,
and one to roll up in, and a waterproof sheet. lam writing this letter
on my rifle bucket. Staircase (his horse) is doing all right after his trip.
Captain Spencer is in the hospital, and a good many of us are bad with
colds. Mine left me before I landed. The country about here is just
like Mount Lyons—little kopjes out on the flat. There are no trees at
all only little bunches of scrub. The men are all eager to have a scrap


with the enemy. We can hear them fighting about ten miles out. Ihe
pom-poms can be heard going through the day. We are getting on all
right as far as ‘tucker' is concerned. All sorts of reports come into
camp, but we can't put much faith in any of them. We are about eight
hours behind Launceston time. Word has just come into camp that we
are wanted five miles out, to reinforce a column, so I suppose we will have
a jig with them to-morrow."
The next letter is dated Mortimer camp, May 9, and states ; —“Ever
since I wrote last I have been in the saddle. We are attached to Scobie s
flying column, and they keep us on the move. I don t know what it is
to sleep at night, but just get a couple of hours through the day. ihey
are using us as scouts, and we are about a day in advance of the column.
This morning, while on outpost duty, my mate shot at a Boer who was
trying to creep into our lines, but missed him, as it was too dark. This
morning, about 6 o'clock, about eighteen of us and twenty C.IA .’s went
out mounted on patrol. We had got about six miles when we came across
two horses, belonging to the Boers, so we followed up their tracks. It
led up a valley, the hills on both sides being very rocky. We had six
scouts about 400 yards ahead of the rest. This was my first experience
under fire, and it was a funny feeling. Anyhow, the Boers let our scouts
go on right by them, until the main body got well up the gully, and then
the first thing I knew was the snap of a Mauser. It sounded just like
a stockwhip. Then they let go a volley into the midst of us. I saw
my mate knocked clean out of the saddle, and three more in front of me.
I was completely stunned for a second or two, until a bullet struck Stair-
case in the butt "of the tail. All the rest were off their horses, and trying
to get cover. As soon as Staircase was hit, he gave a bound, and nearly
unseated me. I was about to get off him, when another bullet struck
him on the knee, and he went down with me. I managed to get clear
of him, and crawled on my hands and knees to a bit of a gutter, where
the rest were. The bullets were whistling all round me. This all occurred
in a few seconds. We were completely trapped. They were firing from
both sides and ahead of us. It was a proper cross-fire, and 1 can teil
you it was hot. There were 200 of the enemy, and we could not see
one of them. The lieutenant gave the order to retreat, every man for
himself. How we got out of it I don’t know. We left four stretched
out, and five horses killed. All I was thinking of was where I was going
to get hit. We could hear the snap of the rifles, and then the hissing
sound of the bullets, and the ping of them when they struck the ground
about us, and sent the dust up. One whizzed by my head, and I could
swear it burnt me as it went by; but anyhow, I got out of the gully, and
snapped the horse of one of the chaps that had been shot, and on to his
back and into camp for help. We took the ambulance out with us, but
when we got half-way we met them coming back in twos and threes. We
had three of our fellows wounded, and one of the C.I.V. One of our
chaps, Dug. Brownell, was taken prisoner, and two C.l.V.’s. The C.I.V.
that was wounded was hit in the arm, and one of our own fellows, War-


burton, had the top of his head blown off. They reckon he will not
get over it. One of the other two wounded was my mate. The bullet
ploughed his forehead, and laid him out for an hour or two. The other
was wounded in the cheek. The bullet cut his chin strap in two, and it
was a narrow escape for him. Cyril Maddox was with us, and got out
all right.”
Ihe letter was continued on the following day, as follows: —“Since I
left off writing we have been out to where we were ambushed. Every man
in camp had to go. The Boers had not shifted. We rode up to within
a mile of the pass, and dismounted, and one half climbed the hills on both
sides, the rest went up the gully. We took them completely by surprise,
and engaged them for about eight hours. We don't know how many we
killed, but we came across one shot in the head, and one or two wounded.
We never lost a man. We drove them from their position into Brabant’s
Horse, who killed seven of the enemy, and 26 horses, so we did very well
for our first engagement. The Boers stripped Dug. Brownell of every-
thing he had on him, and he came into camp in that state. Young Smith
has been in the hospital with dysentery, but is all right now. lam sorry
to say we have lost our first man. Poor Warburton, from Westbury, has
died from his wounds, a wire having just come from the hospital. He was
a nice chap. I have got the first cartridge I fired, and will bring it home
with me.”
SECOND IMPERIAL.
WITH A FLYING COLUMN.
A TASMANIAN’S EXPERIENCES.
Corporal J. Orr, with Gorringe’s Flying Column Scouts, writes to his
brother at Underwood:—
Glenconner Station, Cape Colony, October 7.
Gorringe’s flying column has had a jolly rough time lately. The wily
Boer has kept us more than fully occupied. General Smutz, the Boer
commandant, is as cunning as they make them, and although an enemy
I must acknowledge his ability as a leader. We have been following him
for a month, and the column never got into touch with him until last
week. Then he ambushed us in some very rough country, and for about
half an hour caused a regular panic amongst a lot of our men. The country
was bushy, which compelled the troops to keep on the road, so when the
order to retire was given the squadrons retreated on to the pack mules,
which were following up behind. Their progress being thus blocked, all
order was lost, and one could see nothing but a confused mass of horses,
pack mules, and men, both black and white, the poor niggers being pushed
aside by their lords and masters as if they had no lives to lose. The Boers
were concealed in the thick bush close by, so the scouts and a few of the
17th Lancers who were in front took up a position among some rocks and
covered the retreat of the main body. Lieutenant Macdonald, the officer


in charge of the scouts, received three wounds. Sergeant Donner, also of
the scouts, and an officer and a private of the Lancers were also wounded.
To make up for this slight reverse, a Boer picket of five was captured, and
the unlucky devils were shown no mercy, being sent to the happy hunting-
ground straight away.
This last week we have been very short of supplies, and have lived
on a biscuit and fresh air until we arrived at Glenconner. It is on occa-
sions such as these that thoughts of home and apple pie thrust themselves
upon a fellow's mind, but he pushes them aside, and, like the philosopher,
turns to the corner of his biscuit and muses on the frailty of the human
race, or else the stomach. But here we are alive and well at Glenconner,
with heaps of tucker and the prospects of an early reveille in the morning
and more of Smutz.
On the 17th September, at Modderfontein, Smutz and his commando
of 400 Boers attacked the 17th Lancers’ camp, and were successful in
carrying off all their rations, horses, guns, rifles, and ammunition. V\ hat
they did not want they burnt or destroyed. There were only no men in
the Lancers’ camp when it was attacked, and they fought like demons, well
maintaining the reputation of their motto, which is “Death or Glory.”
Poor devils, they would not surrender, and lost 35 killed and 50 wounded.
This is an enormous percentage of casualties for the number of men en-
gaged; in fact, it was one of the most disastrous affairs of the campaign.
Our column was camped only nine miles off, and the scouts were out on
patrol. We heard the firing, and climbed a kopje to reconnoitre. On
reaching the top the Boers were just in the act of rushing the camp. Being
too far off to render assistance, we galloped to a ridge overlooking the
camp, and fired heavily into the Boers at 1700 yards. Our fire had the
effect of throwing them into confusion, but they soon recovered when they
found out we only numbered 13. We dared not come closer, and in spite
of all we could do we had the mortification of seeing them trek away with
their valuable prize. The Boers did not get off scot free, for they left
behind 12 killed and wounded.
After the fight the camp presented a terrible spectacle, the ground
being covered with the killed and wounded. To make matters worse, they
were stripped o'f their clothes, and the sufferings of the wounded were
very severe. The dead were buried next day in two trenches, each of
which held 16 men. The officers, three in number, were taken to Tar-
kenstadt, and buried in the cemetery there. This is by far the worst affair
I have taken part in. We captured six prisoners last week, two of whom
were Germans, and woeful-looking specimens of humanity. We took
another, dressed in one of the dead Lancers’ clothes. He received no
mercy, being shot 15 minutes after capture.
Everybody now is asking when will this weary, tiresome war end, and
why has it taken a nation like Britain so long to subjugate the Transvaal
and Orange Free State Republics. The principal reasons are the enormous
obstacles that have had to be surmounted by our troops. The country
affords splendid facilities for the carrying on of guerilla warfare, which


the Boers adopted soon after the commencement of the campaign. Their
object has been for a long time not to fight, but to prolong the war in the
hope that some other Power would intervene, and to cost England as
much as possible. This object they carry out by refusing to stand and
fight, unless when covered, or when far superior to the force opposing
them.
The marvellous mobility of the Boer commandoes is another reason
why the war is still unfinished. Unhampered by guns or transport, they
can trek through any part of the country, and, when closely pursued,
retreat to places which are inaccessible to the majority of the columns,
which are compelled to travel by the road. It is in positions such as
these that the Boers made a stand, protected by the nature of the country
from shell and rifle fire.
The life of the Boers must be a miserable one, for they carry no
supplies with them, and consequently have to rely on what rations they
can commandeer from the farms. This is necessarily small, for a farmer
is only allowed to keep a fortnight's provisions, the quantity being regu-
lated by the number of his family. The Boers in the colony chiefly live
on mutton, the supply of which is unlimited, as there are innumerable
flocks of sheep. But in the Transvaal and Orange Free State even this
supply is cut off, for all cattle and sheep have been removed from the farms.
So you see the Boers lead a hand-to-mouth existence, their only good
time being when they capture a convoy or take possession of a town.
the sympathetic attitude of the Dutch farmers also greatly assists
the Boers in keeping away from our troops. The farmers know where
we are, and inform the enemy of our movements, consequently we have
to act warily to prevent being caught in a trap. Of course it is treason
for a farmer to give intelligence to the Boers, and if found out it means
St. Helena or Ceylon; but blood is thicker than water, and they risk it—
and, well, what could you expect?
These few facts will give you an idea of the tremendous difficulties
that our troops have to work against, and I trust you will not consider
it to the discredit of the British soldier that the war is still unsettled.
How much longer the war will drag on I cannot say, but set it down
at a few moie months at the most. There has been none of the glorious
fighting that you read of in former wars, when men stood up and either
gave or took their gruel. It is fighting against an invisible foe, concealed
among rocks or bushes, and who retires as soon as you locate him and
make things warm. We are always working under disadvantages, and
seldom know of the enemy’s presence until the ping-pong of the rifles
breaks upon our eats, and a hail of bullets comes whizzing around our
heads.
From Trooper A. A. Hunt’s notes, which record mostly the same
movements as Lieutenant Bisdce and others, I make the following ex-
tract:—
Joining the waggons, we went back into Dordrecht, and spent Xmas,
which was much enjoyed. We got presents from Capetown, such as


plum pudding, chocolates, tobacco, cigarettes, pipes, etc. After Xmas,
we trekked out again to Barkley, patrolling this part of the country for
some time. Went back into Dordrecht, and from there to Stormberg,
where we entrained for a place called “Three Sisters.” Joining Colonel
Doran’s column, and getting out the second day, we came upon them
camped under a kopje, where they had been waiting for us. Crossing a
flat piece of country to the kopje, and coming up within 200 yards of
them, they poured in a heavy rifle fire, wounding six of our men. Driving
them off, they retired to another kopje, where they made a good stand.
In looking back to our rear, we noticed a commando of 200 Boers, under
Commandant Wessels, who were coming up to reinforce Commandant
Malan. Seeing us, they turned in a different direction, coming out again
in our front; and, firing a few shots, they retired west, having killed four
and wounded ten, and taking two prisoners, one a commandant named
Judge Hugo, who was shot through the head. [“Having killed, etc.,”
evidently means that the Bushmen had done this.] We learned after-
wards that Commandant Malan was also wounded through the leg.
Trekking back to our waggons, and having had dinner, we went out in
search of the enemy again, but, having had enough, they soon got away. A
day afterwards Commandant Hugo succumbed to his wounds, and was
buried near a Dutch farm.

(Sailed in the “Chicago,” 263 strong, Colonel Watchorn in Command.)
DIARY OF FIRST MONTH.
April 20. —After a pleasant trip across the Indian Ocean, we dropped
anchor in Algoa Bay on Saturday, the 20th of April, 1901. The bay was
crowded with ships, steamers, and sailing transports, bringing troops and
provisions for the seat of war, and presented a very busy appearance.
April 21. —Sunday. Church parade at 11 a.m. “Mohawk” transport
arrived at 12.30 with a draft of the Warwick Militia on board. Sailed
again for East London at 2 p.m. As they passed us they cheered, and we
returned the compliment.
April 22. —Raining all day; still on board.
April 23. —Colonel addressed the parade at night, telling us we would
land next day, but would not be allowed about the town, as we were going
on by train to the front in the afternoon. Everyone pleased to get
ashore, and anxious to have a look at the Boers.
April 24. —Landed at 11.30, Port Elizabeth; fell in on the wharf, and
marched to Ordnance stores, and got served out with rifles and side-arms.
Were entertained by the ladies of Port Elizabeth, who gave us an up-to-date
spread in the Town Hall.
April 25. —Arrived at Cradock, noon, and detrained; went into camp,
eastern side of town. Boers reported about 18 miles out.


April 26.—Got new saddlery issued, the saddlery we brought out
having been condemned on landing. Small detachment of Cape Mounted
Rifles, about 150, left camp to locate Boers.
April 27. —Kit bags issued.
April 28.—0n guard. Camp routine: Reveille at 5.30, feed horses
at 6, breakfast 8, water horses 9, clean up 9.30, feed horses 12, dinner 1,
parade 2.30, water 4, feed 5, tea 6, feed 9, lights out 10 p.m.
April 29. —Full dress parade. Thirty horses arrived from Port
Elizabeth.
April 30. —Still in camp.
May 1. —Struck camp, and moved out about four miles; halted, and
went into camp at Orange Grove farm. Boers were expected to attempt
to cross line here, and we were placed to block them. Reported that
an engagement took place between Midland Mounted Rifles (M.M.R.) and
Boers; defeated. Thirty men told off for outpost; posted along the road,
as it was reported the Boers coming that way, but saw nothing of them.
Our orders were to fire at anyone on sight.
May 2. —On outpost duty; 24 hours of it.
May 3. —Several columns seen moving in the distance. We are
posted on a high kopje. Can see for a long way. Outpost relieved at 5
p.m. Raided a Boer farm at 9.30, seven of us being told off for the
purpose; information has been received that the rebels were in the habit
of visiting it. Had our journey for nothing, as we found everything
correct, no one being there but the farmer and his family. Returned to
camp at 10.45, an d turned in, but was roused out again at 11.30. Had to
saddle up and form escort for waggons, with supplies for the M.M.R. Had
an all-night job of it.
May 4- —Met a party of the M.M.R., who took over the convoy at
11 a.m., so we had twelve hours in the saddle. Halted one hour to have
something to eat. Aloved on again, and reached our own camp at 5.30
p.m., tired and hungry. Railway line blown up about 10 miles from
us. A small patrol of C.M.R. got into trouble, and lost corporal killed
and five men wounded.
May s.—Struck camp at 7 a.m., and marched down the line to where
it was blown up. Camped; found line repaired; no sign of Boers. Owner
of farm where we camped was an Australian; name of station, Limebanks.
Had a very dusty ride of it. Farmer treated us like a gentleman.
May 6.—Forty of No. 2 went out on patrol, and visited four Boer
farms, looking for rebels, but without success. Country very rough and
hard on the horses. Six of the C.C.C. (Cape Cyclist Corps) joined us to act
as despatch riders. No. 1 Company patrol captured a Boer, but let him
go again, after taking his papers from him. About 60 Boers were seen
on a kopje this morning, about three miles from here, and 180 passed
through two days ago. Colonel Scobell’s main body passed through
Craddock to-day, to try and head them off. As it is expected they will
come back this way, we have dug trenches round the camp, and posted
extra guards, so we are prepared to give them a good reception.


May 7. —All hands stood to arms at 11.30 last night, and slept in the
•trenches to 7 this morning. It was reported the Boers had cut the
telegraph between here and Craddock. Found out that they had crossed
the line about two miles from here, and camped for about two hours in
a gully just below our outpost. They were three hundred strong, and we
expected an attack.
May B.—Out again last night, all hands being roused out at 10.30
p.m.; got orders to saddle up in full marching order. Marched off at
12.15, an d kept going till daybreak. Our troop (No. 3 B squad) were
halted and served out with 200 rounds extra ammunition, and marched
to the top of a kopje commanding a view of the road to the railway line.
The Boers are being driven this way. Colonel Scobell came in touch
with them three times yesterday.
May 9. —Camped at Drennan all night. About 9 a.m. an order
came for a strong patrol to go out and visit the kopjes around us. After
being out two hours, we were recalled; went back to camp, fell in, full
marching order, and started for Mortimer; got about half-way, when a
despatch came from No. 2 Troop, A squad, to come on with all possible
speed, as Lieutenant Blyth was hemmed in, and Lieutenant Richardson
wanted all the assistance he could get. So we went full gallop for about
five miles, when we sighted some horses and men about a mile away on
our right, which proved to be No. 2 Troop, A squad, under Lieutenant
Richardson; so we joined them. Just as we did, a report came in that
Lieutenant Blyth, No. 1 Troop, A squad, was clear, and had retired on
Mortimer; and as it was getting dark we did the same. When we reached
camp No. 1 was already there. In the morning the account I got of
the affair from one of No. 1 Troop was as follows:—No. 1 and some of
the Scottish Sharpshooters were ordered to search some of the kopjes in
the rear of Mortimer. About three miles out they entered a long valley
between two kopjes. There was a belt of scrub and a dry watercourse
(donga). The scouts, four in number, being in advance of the patrol,
entered the scrub and crossed the donga without seeing the Boers, who
were lying in the donga. When the patrol got within 200 yards of the
scrub the enemy opened fire, wounding three horses and one man. The
patrol retired, but the scouts were not so fortunate. Two got clear away,
the other two Tasmanians being cut off. They dismounted and returned
the fire of the Boers at 50 yards’ distance. Warburton received a wound
in the head, and Brownell a bullet through the sleeve of his coat. They
fired all the ammunition. Brownell shot both the horses to prevent the
Boers from getting them, and then surrendered. Brownell was stripped
of his clothing, and then set free. At 7.30 he took the ambulance out,
and brought Warburton in to Craddock Hospital, where he died on Satur-
day, the nth.
May 10. —Orders to saddle up as soon as we were roused at 5.30. We
were marched out three miles, and then got orders to dismount and advance
to attack the position where No. 1 got fired on yesterday. The order
was—A squad on the right, 77th Scottish Sharpshooters centre, B squad


left; a few of us were sent as left Hankers to go round a big kopje and
see if anyone was there. Before we reached the top, we could hear tiring
on the other side, so we hurried up a bit and got on top. We could hear
the bullets “pinging” past, but could see no Boers, as they were under
cover in the scrub, where they stuck for a couple of hours, and then
retired; so we got a shot at them, but don’t think we did much damage.
Returned to camp at 12.
May 11. —Out after them again; left camp at 8 a.m. Rjode out
three miles, and then had a big climb over a kopje to try and get them
in the rear. We did some hard climbing till 3 p.m.; took up a position,
but they had left. Could hear the sound of artillery in the distance.
They ran up against M.M.R., and got cut up a bit. They turned back,
and crossed the line at Limeback, and made for the hills again.
May 12.—Expected a spell to-day, but got orders to fall in, full
marching order. Saddled up, and started at 10.45 a - m - Went in the
direction of Craddock. Blowing a full gale, and the dust something
frightful, right in our faces. Pitched camp at 7 p.m. on a Englishman’s
farm, five miles from Cradock.
May 13. —Had a spell, and rested our horses. Colonel Scobell visited
camp, and was very pleased with the appearance of the men and horses.
May 14. —Saddled up, and moved off at 9 a.m.; passed through Cra-
dock. All the people turned out to have a look at us. Camped three
miles north of Cradock at 2.30.
May 15. —A day’s spell, awaiting orders.
May i6.—Moved off at 11 a.m., back through Cradock, and followed
on in rear of Scobell’s column. Halted at 5.30.
May 17. —Joined Colonel Scobell’s column this morning, consisting
of one section Royal Horse Artillery (R.H.A.), two 12-pounders, and one
pom-pom; half-section Royal Field Artillery, with howitzer; three squads
of Cape Police, with two Maxims; one squad C.M.R., section Royal Engi-
neers; two troops Diamond Fields Horse; some of the First and Second
Brabant’s Horse, and fighting scouts, Kaffirs, in all amounting to about
1000 men. The convoy was one and a half miles long. Marched 35
miles, and camped for the night at 11.30 p.m.
In a letter accompanying Trooper Emery promised further notes, but
they never came to hand.
Extracts from Trooper S. M. Ibbott’s Notes
The iqlb. guns which were with the columns usually used shrapnel
shell. These did very little damage, as they were of not much use for
the kind of warfare that was carried on in Cape Colony, although good
for columns operating in the Transvaal and 0.R.C., where the enemy were
mostly met with in force, and so inclined to be aggressive. The presence
of guns with the columns did a great deal towards causing many of the
Boers, especially when in small bands, or commandoes as were met with
in the colony, to evade the British as much as possible.


Howitzer guns, firing lyddite, were with most of the columns, but
these were of little use, except in a fight of some importance. The report
of pom-poms is unsettling to troops, and does not do so much damage
as one would suppose. Maxims were not up to their supposed standard
of usefulness in the latter part of the war. The Lee-Metford service rifle
is a good weapon, but an improvement could be made with the magazine,
which is not strong, and takes some time to fill, in this respect being
inferior to the Mauser. The climate of South Africa is a good one, the
air being clear, dry, and healthy. The troops as well as inhabitants
are subject very little to colds, coughs, etc., etc. A deal is heard of the
prevalence of enteric in South Africa, but if this campaign had been carried
on in almost any other country fever and sickness would have been present
in a far greater degree. [Why?] In comparison with the number of troops
operating there has been less serious sickness than has been known in any
other Anglo-foreign war. [?] The hospitals were managed well. Good
treatment was given patients by nurses and doctors, but the orderlies of
the Royal Army Medical Corps were very often guilty of neglect and
carelessness towards the patients. In some of the temporary up-country
hospitals this was especially the case. They, however, would do whatever
was wanted of them for bribes.
For the first three weeks after arrival in the country we were not
attached to any column. It was during this time we had our first
encounter with the Boers, a little below a station called Mortimer, on
the Port Elizabeth line. It was at this time that Trooper Warburton was
mortally wounded. We were then attached to Colonel Scobell’s column,
which consisted of ourselves and Brabant’s force, with artillery, made up
of two 141b. field guns, one howitzer, one pom-pom, and one mounted
iv±axim. When first attached to this column we were kept moving about,
round about Craddock district. We then moved north and north-east to
Cyphergat. Here the column was broken up, Scobell taking command
of another. While with him we had to be on the move every morning
between 6 and 7, and go till midday, when we halted for an hour, or two,
or only half an hour, then off again, and kept going till camping time,
any time between 5 and 8. When a night march was contemplated, a
halt would be called a couple of hours before sundown, after which we
would be set going again, and travel till 11, perhaps 2, or later. These
night marches were made for the purpose of stealing a march on the enemv,
but were very trying to both horses and men, coming after the hard and
long day’s work.
On June 3 we joined Colonel Gorringe’s flying column, and with them
we travelled to Lady Brand, Barclay East, and towards the Basutoland
border. (His column was composed of ourselves, A squadron, 17th Lan-
cers, and sometimes B and C squad, Cape Police, Nesbitt’s Horse, and
Cape Colonial Defence Force, with two 14-pounders, one pom-pom, and
one Maxim on packhorse.) Here some of the Boers, whom some of the
columns hoped they had cornered got back past them. We then turned
back across the colony, and got to Burghersdorp, where we left our


waggons and got pack mules. After this we were kept moving about
between O.R. and Steynsburg and south of that place. It was here that
Kruitzinger (the chief commandant in the colony) was surprised and driven
across the O.R. On returning in the following December and trying to
break through the line of blockhouses near Hanover-road, he was wounded
and captured. Later on, near Tarkastadt, the disaster happened to C.
Squad., 17th Lancers. The column was moving with a broad front
Tasmanians on the left, B. Squad, left centre, A. Squad, right centre, C.
Squad, on the right, a distance of a few miles separating each. At midday
C. Squad, halted in an opening with kopjes on each side. Beneath the
kopje on one side was a donga. Smuts’ commando was not far off, and,
getting to know of the Lancers' position, he doubled back and surprised
them. The main body of Boers got on to the kopje on the opposite side
of the donga, while others, getting into the donga, followed it up, till they
were close to the squad., and then opened fire, with the result that most of
the British got away as best they could, leaving behind them their Cape-
carts and baggage, 36 men being mortally wounded and killed. Some
escaped to A. Squad., but when they (A. Squad.) arrived the affair was over.
Smuts was gone after setting fire to the Cape-carts, etc. After operating
for some time in this part of the country, Smuts was closely pursued in the
direction of Port Elizabeth, which place he reported he was going to take
possession of. In the latter stage of this pursuit he was pressed so closely
the last two or three days that his commando could sometimes be caught
sight of. This was near Bellevue. Here it was expected that he would
be caught, as he was forced to go through one of two passes leading to
Bellevue. A body of troops were expected by train to guard this pass to
Bellevue. The town guard and district voh, which were guarding it, left
it to go to the other, and while it was thus unprotected he whipped through,
thus escaping and breaking up his commando. During this march we
experienced the hardest time we had had while out there, mostly moving
off at 3 a.m., and going till dark at night.
On October 9th Colonel Gorringe’s column was broken up, the
different corps for about a fortnight being stationary, or acting indepen-
dently. We then were taken charge of by Colonel Lukin for about three
weeks, and again broken, ourselves, Lancers, Nesbitt's Horse, and
Artillery entraining and joining Scobell’s column at Stormberg, November
14th. Scobell’s column was made up of Cape Mounted Rifles, 9th Lancers,
Yeomanry, and for a while Kafifrarian Rifles, two iqlb. guns, one pom-pom,
one howitzer, and Maxims. With this column we operated in the country
between Stormberg, Barclay East, and Rhodes until Christmas time, when
Scobell returned to England; for a while we were attached to Colonel
Munro’s column, consisting of B. Squadron, 17th Lancers, Bethune’s
Mounted Infantry, New England (Zealand?) Rifles, some Yeomanry, and
Artillery. About the beginning of February we entrained for a station
near Richmond-road, on Capetown line, and were attached to Colonel
Doran’s column of Yeomanry and Artillery, when at last some close engage-

merits were taken part in. When first in the country with Colonel Scobell’s
column we were in pursuit of Scheeper’s commando; with Gorringe after
Kruitzinger and Smuts; the second time with Scobell after Fouchee and
Wessells ; with Munro after ditto; with Doran after Malan, Lotagan, and
Theron's commandos.
You are welcome to make any use you please of these notes, and I hope
they will be of service to you in your work, which I trust will meet with
the success it deserves. As you will see, the notes are only a rough outline,
and you must put it all into proper language.—From Trooper Stephen
Hears Ibbott.
[The language is eminently satisfactory.]
LETTER FROM COLONEL WATCHORN.
Lieutenant-Colonel E. T. Watchorn, in command of the 2nd Tasma-
nian Imperial Bushmen’s Contingent, wrote under date Deelfontein, March
6:—“ I wish to draw your attention to an error which appeared in your
columns on Monday, January 20, in which it mentions two sergeants of
the 2nd Tasmanian Imperial Contingent having distinguished themselves
at the capture of Commandant Erasmus and two other Commandants.
This should have been Quartermaster-Sergeant D. M. Lyne (No. 193) and
Transport-Sergeant Coombe (259). The facts were that Colonel Gorrings
called for volunteers to storm a kopje on which the enemy were known to
be. Sergeant-Major Young, of the Cape Police, selected seven men, four
of whom were Tasmanians. They instantly charged the kopje, and found
by the fire that there were a large number of Boers there. Without
hesitating they galloped right into their midst, and succeeded, as before
said, in capturing three Commandants, and shooting and capturing other
Boers. The Boers, thinking there were a large number of khakis coming,
became disorganised, and fled. Sergeant-Major Young, on being inter-
viewed. stated that if he had twenty Tasmanians he would go anywhere.
I am pleased to have had these two sergeants mentioned in despatches.
Am sorry I was unable to have had the other two mentioned, who were
equally as brave. Numerous instances of the bravery of our men could
be given, but will furnish matter for a future occasion. This is merely to
correct the error which occurred in the name of Sergeant Coombe. One
instance I should like to mention, showing what the Boers think of
Australians. When Commandant Scheepers was interviewed previous to
his execution, and asked what troops were feared most in the field, his
reply was, “ Give me 600 Bushmen and I would go anvwhere.”
LETTER FROM TROOPER BLACKBURN.
Zeehan, November 10, 1902.
Dear Sir, —In reference to yours of the 14th October, I would have
answered sooner only it never reached me until the 3rd November, so
I will give you an account of our travels as well as I can remember.


We landed at Port Elizabeth on April 24th, 1901, and proceeded by
train to Cradock, and as Cape Colony was then in a state of rebellion we
were kept there. We were in camp there for a few days, and then trekked
down ihe line for about five miles to a place called Orangegrove, to guard
a pass, where we stopped for a few days, and then went to Mortimer to
protect the line there, as Boers had wrecked a train the previous night.
Next morning (the nth May) a troop of the 2nd 1.1.8. went on patrol,
under Lieutenant Blyth, and they rode into an ambush, where we lost one
lad and two slightly wounded and one captured. Trooper Warburton,
who was well ahead with Lance-Corporal Brownell, was fired on at close
range. They fought until there was only death staring them in the face, so
they shot their horses, and then Warburton received a bullet through his
head and Brownell was forced to surrender. He was stripped and let go.
Next day we went out to meet them, and found them about three miles out
of Dassedue, where we engaged them until well in the afternoon, and then
they were forced to retire, their losses being slight and ours nil. A few
days after this we joined Colonel Scobell’s column, when we trekked up and
down the line for a few days, and part of the column —the C.M.R. —had a
small skirmish, resulting in the wounding of a Commandant and capturing
him, also three or four others, and capturing thirty odd horses. We
then had a few night marches of not much consequence, and then trekked
to Cyphergat, where we had our first experience of snow, finding in the
morning when we awoke the ground white, dotted here and there with a
head poking out from under the blanket.
That day we were transferred to Colonel Gorringe’s Flying Column.
That was early in June, and we then trekked towards Jamestown, and
near there we had a rearguard action with the Boers, their losses being
slight and ours nil. From there we trekked on towards the Basutoland
border, and then on the Bth June we tried to surprise Commandant Myburg
at his house, but found him missing. During the day the Boers attacked
our observation post, and by the time we arrived with the guns we were
only able to fire a few shots. Next day we again engaged him near Lady
Grey at Dreifontein, with the Lady Grey town guard and some of the
Qth Lancers on our right. We had a first-class engagement, shifting the
Boers about 4 o’clock. The country was very rough and hilly, so we
could not make much headway. We had several horses shot that day, but
no men wounded, and the Boer losses were several. We chased them up
for a few davs and then went into Burghersdorp for a refit, and not
before time, as some of the lads had to put blankets around themselves,
whilst going through the town, for decency sake. We had a week’s spell
there, but I think it did us more harm than good, for the second day there
it started raining, and notwithstanding that we managed to borrow a few
tents from the garrison we were completely flooded out, there being from
six inches to a foot of water all over the flat where we were camped bv 6
o’clock in the morning, and it was 2 o’clock before we were shifted to
higher ground. And before we had time to dry and air our blankets we
had a mounted parade. What with an empty stomach (for our rations


were all washed away) and wet clothes it was miserable. During the
next few days there were ten to fifteen men going to hospital with fever
daily, so it was a blessing when we got to Dornhook. We split up, B
squad of Tassies and the C.P. going around by Shank’s siding, a few
miles above Steynsburg, and the rest of the column round by Theybus. A
few miles below Steynsburg the Boers ambushed several and captured two,
but we came along with the guns just in time to save the rest. It was
then about dark, so we could not do much. Next day a squad of Tas-
manians went into Steynsburg and were joined by C squad of the 17th
Lancers (Death or Glory Boys). And no mistake they were fine fellows —
in fact, were like brothers. [A neat compliment to yourselves !]
We were then kept on a flying patrol, under Major Sandyman, of the
17th, for a couple of months, and barring the bringing in of a few rebels ano
ridding the country of all the horses about the farms, we did little. But B
squad with the column had more fun, for in September they had a very
fair engagement, resulting in the killing of Commandant Erasmus and
the capture and wounding of three more Commandants, also capturing
Kritzinger, private secretary, and killing, wounding, and capturing about
thirty men. During that time we were patrolling the flank of the column.
About the 6th September we again joined the column near Venterstad,
and proceeded towards Dordrecht, after Commandant Smuts, who had
just crossed the Orange River near Aliwal North. We then chased him
around Jamestown and Dordrecht for a few days, down near Tarkastad, and
owing to the heavy rains and flooded rivers it made things very awkward
for both, notwithstanding our column only had one blanket and water-
proof on mules, and our rations on mules, it was difficult to proceed. But
one evening we were blocked at the river—Smuts one side and we the
other. We crossed to our waist to surprise the outposts, and after a smart
gallop we succeeded in getting two of them; but that day’s work proved
fatal to us, for we drove them on to C squad of the 17th Lancers, and
as Smuts was on to them in khaki they thought it was us, and out of 109
of the 17th there were only twenty not hit. Close on 40 were killed,
including all the officers but two, Major Sandyman being severely wounded,
but afterwards recovering. The Boers captured about 100 horses and
nearly as many mules, which gave them a good footing again. Although
the Boers won the day they lost very heavily. During the next couple of
weeks we regained most of the horses and captured several men, and they
were fast going down the line towards Port Elizabeth, so when we left
Adelaide (near Kingwilliamstown) we started a series of night marches,
having reveille at three, and sometimes marching all night. That lasted
until the Ist October, when we drove them over the line at Cheldon
[? Sheldon] siding. We then altered reveille to 1 a.m., and came in
touch with Smuts. A few days after meeting him, in the Zuurberg ranges,
near Sunday River, about noon, we engaged him till after dark, capturing
a couple and killing and wounding a few. Next morning we were up again
at 1 o’clock and caught up to him at noon again, but dispersed them after
a few shots. It was there that Smuts was reported to have been slightly


wounded in the cheek with a shrapnel bullet. A couple of days after we
drove them on to Somerset District Mounted Rifles, and notwithstanding
they held the heights they surrendered as soon as Smuts got within 2000
yards, so the Boers got a fresh supply of horses. (These Somerset D.M.R.
were a local band of Dutch descent; they were court-martialled, but let
off.) Next day we shot three on observation post, but were caught in
ambush near Sunday River Valley, at Break-Neck Pass. No mistake it
was a rough shop. They lined the pass, and when we were fairly in it they
let go. They shot Colonel Gorringe’s horse from under him and wounded
an officer and two men. Their losses were one killed and seven wounded.
We dispersed them after an hour’s stiff fighting. The fighting chiefly fell
on the 17th Lancers, as they were advance that day.
Smuts then split up his commando, some going across the line near
Victoria West Road, on the Cape line, and others keeping to the Zuurberg
ranges. We then went to Glenconnor siding for supplies and remounts.
Colonel Gorringe then left for Egypt and Lieut.-Col. Lucas took command
for a few weeks. Towards the end of October we again got in touch with
the Boers near New Bethesda, making a night march on them, and after
a few hours’ fighting we got several horses, killed three men, and captured
fifteen. It was there that Corporal J. Orr, of the Second T. 1.8., with two
others, captured three Boers on observation post. We followed them up
closely for a few days, sometimes seeing them, but not getting close enough
to fire. We had much difficulty then in finding them, as they split up,
we having to follow the “ spoor.” We then went into Biejes Poort, on
the Cape line, where we broke up. The Lancers and we went to Colonel
Scobell’s column, in the north-east district. That was early in November.
We trekked from Stormberg towards Jamestown, and each regiment there
was working independently. We came in touch with the Boers near
Roeneck, at Kray River, resulting in the death of Corporal J. Orr, T. 1.8.,
and a 17th Lancer, and a G.F.C. and one T. 1.8. captured. They were in
the scouts at the time, and rode right into them. Two days after the
G.F.C. killed two and captured four, including a Field Cornet. At Roeneck
we had a difficult task before us, as the country there was rough and
treacherous. Tip to the middle of December not much occurred, only as
we were chasing Fouchey (Fouchee) towards the Basuto border we cap-
tured five of his commando, and as they were getting escorted by six of
the Barkly East troops to Barkly they were re-captured and one of the
Barkly East troops got shot. All through that district it was very rough,
steep mountains, the Eastern Drakensberg. We lost two of our scouts
belonging to the G.F.C., and we continued the chase until we got them
hemmed into the Basuto border, but by mistake we got into the Borderland
Police, and the Boers stepped back. Tt was some time before we found we
were fighting our own men, which resulted disastrously for the Grenadiers,
and one of ours, a Lovett scout, was slightly wounded. The countrv was
so rough that each regiment had to work independently of the other." We
then went to Dordrecht for Christmas, where we spent a jolly one, with
no money or clothes (it was not the War Department’s fault), but our


troop officers shelled out handsomely from their own pockets. We had a
plumduff for dinner. We then trekked around the district, chiefly patrol
work, bringing in an occasional rebel and a few horses, until the end of
January, when we were sent to join Colonel Benjamin Doran’s column to
try and break up Commandant Smuts’s commando, who were getting very
troublesome around Beaufort West way, and the second day out we came
in touch with him about 7 a.m. Almost the first volley two of our men
fell—Stewart, wounded in the leg, and North, in the head and body—and
also an I.Y. officer, and as the skirmishing went on Sergeant Adams, of
the T. 1.8., got grazed on the thigh, also a sth Lancer in the ear, and one
captured. We were engaged for about five hours, and beat them ofi in
the end. Judge Hugo and another Commandant were killed and another
Boer mortally wounded. We then chased them on towards Carnarvon,
not coming in touch with them again. A few days later we got in touch
with Malan's forces outside of Richmond, at a place called Tafelberg, and
had a very good running fight, which lasted all day. We met them about
6.30 a.m., and Malan and staff had a very narrow escape of being captured,
he only gaining the kopjes about thirty yards ahead of us, after a five miles
gallop. Then they put a volley at us, putting five bullets into one horse:
but we soon got them on the go again, and kept on till well in the after-
noon, resulting in Corporal Johnson, of the T. 1.8., being slightly wounded,
and the Boers lost Commandant Rudolph and four others killed and several
badly wounded. We chased them up for a couple of days, and then cap-
tured their only Cape cart. During April Malan had several very narrow
escapes from being captured, but then peace negotiations were started, so
we did very little more, and early in May we started to mobilise, and the
majority were very glad to go home. During the time out in Africa we
saw all the fighting area of Cape Colony from the western province, which
was a karoo desert, to the north-eastern district, which was a first-class
grass and farming district, but only crossed the river once. That was when
Kritzinger was driven across. It was at that time that Sergeant Coombs
and Q.M.S. Lyne got the D.C.M., and Private Arthur Bingley took the
most prominent part in the single-hand capture of Commandant Erasmus,
but by some oversight another got the V.C., and Bingley was forgotten.
Our casualties were small:—Killed in action—Private Warburton and Cor-
poral Orr. Died of disease —Q.M.S. Lyne, Private Fagan [? Phegan],
Hutley, and Cowell. Wounded severely—Privates North and Stewsrt;
slightly, Sergeant Adams, Corporal Johnson, Privates Burton and Saunder-
son. Another, also Privates Blyth and Scott, accidentally whilst marking
at target practice; and three captured. That is not a bad record out of 250
officers and men. And, in conclusion, a word for the Boers. Although not
once have they attacked us, I can honestly say on one or two occasions,
especially at Tafelberg, the Boers showed the greatest courage and bravery.
When one of their own was wounded they would return under a hail of
bullets, strap him on his horse, and take him to a place of safety. That
I saw on a few occasions, and they would never abandon a wounded com-
rade unless he was too bad to take away.


P.s. —Sorry I cannot give yon correct dates and more full details,
but as I am from home at present, cannot get my diary, but this is a
correct account as far as it goes. —Yours truly,
Pvt. H. S. Blackburn, 130, 2nd T.LB.
There is no doubt about its being a correct account, as it is corro-
borated in every detail from other sources. It is, moreover, a very read-
able and vivid summary of the doings of the Second “Imperial Bushes.”
LETTER FROM TROOPER G. SHEARING.
I wo or three letters from Trooper Shearing have been kindly sent in.
They are mostly written on small leaves of a pocket-book. The unaffected
simplicity of the narrative constitutes their interest. I shall therefore
give one letter —all I have space for—with spelling and punctuation as
written. lam sure it will be read with interest in that form.
Sunday, June 16, 1901, burghersdorp Town.
Dear Mother and Father just a few lines hoping to find you all in good
health as this leaves me at present we have had a rough time of it since
I rote to you last we have had 3 engagements the last one we killed 22 of
the enemy only one of our boys was wounded slitely we were fighting for 2
hours and then found we were shelled by our own men with the big guns
the shells bursted all around us it was a misstake they took us for the
boers luckly none of us was hit one bursted about 10 yards from Lieut,
bisdee he is fetching a piece of it home with him we had two terrible nights
in the snow without blankets. We nearly frost to death we are having a
week spell at present in the above I own nearly all our Tassy horses are
dead, but we have got others in their place we are up on the borders of Cape
Colony and the orange free states the second fight we had 2 of our men
got astray we have not heard of them since that is 3 weeks ago the last
fight we had was on General Myberg farm the boer leader he had 300 men
with him after we drove them out we looted the place, taking everything
we could lay our hands we lived on luxury for a few days the last week we
have been destroying all we can get hold of it is the only way to deal with
them.
I heard 20r3 of our chaps have returned home. I don’t know if it is
true they were very bad I know. I don’t know where joe johnson is I have
not seen this last month he lost his horse and stayed behind in a town
it is very likely he will join us here before we leave. I hope he does. I
have not got any letters from you yet we saw the Tasmanian mail with
the chicago in it the day we were leaving we never see a paper except we
come to a town, and that is not very often I wish you would try and send
me a paper now and again did you get my 2 letters" and the feathers I sent
to you it is hard to get letters here I am getting fat over here in spite of how
we have to rough it I have gained nearly a stone some of them are 2 stone
heavier there is a big trial on in this town there is 20 riables getting tried
I think 3 of them will stand a good chance of getting a bullet into them the


others will get about 12 years hard labour a few of us went to hear the trial
yesterday it is a terrible place for wood you have to burn all sorts of robous
to cook your bit of tucker cow doung or anything you can pick up they
stock all the manure in a heap and then cut it out in square cakes that is
worth 2oi a ton for fire fuel.
I will give you a bit of our last battle we knew the boers were not far
away but we did not know exactly were they were we were all riding along
the road together about 500 of us all merry as could be until we got into
a pass a nasty place it was there was only just room for the waggons to go
in the road all at once we were fired on in front there was no such a thing
as retiring we could not get back for the waggons we had to run straight
into the bullets they were flying around us like hail storm one hit my horse
on the hoof, another hit her on the tail, going in one side and out the other.
One had the rifle knocked out of his hand with a bullet it is a mirickle that
there was not 20 or more of us shot they kept blazing away at us until the
big guns got to work at them that shifted them for a little while then we
took our horses under cover and rouched the copji they were in then they
had to run across a clear plain and how did we give it to them we knocked
them in all directions then they got on another hill and they made it a
bit lively for us we had to cross the same plain after them and under the
same circumstances but they did not succeed in dropping any of us but they
went quite close enough for me at any rate it was pitch dark when we got
back to camp when we got camped I mean they gave us an extry dose of
rum that night we are atached to Colonel Gorringe’s flying column now are
having more fighting than the rest I suppose we will stay with him now least
I hope so as he is a good man I think I have told you all the news this
time except that we are all hanging into rags and lousey as bandicots but
that is nothing in this country we are having fine weather and getting
plenty to eat and having plenty of fighting, so what more do we want but
we can’t get any beer that is strictly forbidden. You can’t get a drink with-
out an order from an officer and only one drink at that well I have told you
all this time so good by and God bless you all. I remain your loving son,
G. Shearing.

Give my love to all as you can rite as often.
From part of a letter enclosed I make the following extract: —“We
had great fun at General Myberg's farm he is a boer general we looted
everything he had a big engune that he used to grind his flour with we
smashed it to pieces we got a fine lot of dryed fruit of all descriptions and
jam and butter eggs some got a bit of money bedding and clothes any
quantity of them the officers got some fine pictures we could have got some
but we had no where to carry them one picture was of old Kruger and his
rovl familv I bet it cost fifty pounds.”

Diary of Lieutenant Bisdee, VC
Note. I had extracted eighty MS. pages from this dairy, but as space
forbids its inclusion I am most reluctantly compelled to use only twelve
pages. It would be impossible to condense the whole, hence I have
selected the first twelve pages of my original extract.
Honour and shame from no condition rise;
Act well your part, there all the honour lies.—Pope.
HE first entry is dated Newtown Camp, March 22nd, 1901.
Having carefully read this admirably-written diary, I find
it difficult to do justice by condensation, and I therefore
propose to reproduce nearly the whole of it. Of course, there
is necessarily much that is more or less monotonous
in any record of the kind, but the days of apparently useless marching out
and again returning are part of the game of war, and they are essential
to the coherency of any record of the operations of the contingent. In
parts that are more or less private names will be replaced by initials. I
shall omit, for want of space, most of the notes on the voyage, where life
was much the same as on other troopships.
Mr. Bisdee was a returned trooper with a much-coveted distinction,
and, I may be permitted to add, a gentleman by birth and breeding, and was
therefore in every way fitted for an officer’s position. When he applied to
Colonel Legge he was told that he was too late, but so good a man was
not to be missed, and he modestly tells us:—
“ Next morning he told me that he had been able to get me a place
in the Fifth Contingent.”


On Friday I set to work to get equipped, and was soon under way.
Captain Perceval picked me a horse. She soon developed lameness, so I
got another, one which Page had strongly recommended. This one is a
great success. ... I have been put in charge of the 3rd division of No.
1 Company, and they appear to be a very good lot of men. Sergeant Drew
has had a lot of experience, both in South Africa and also in the Cuban war.
Corporal Facy I knew well before, as he was picked to go with the First
Imperial Bushmen, and Lance-Corporal Orr I met on the Sydney trip, and
he seems a very smart young fellow.
S.S. “Chicago,” Sunday, March 31. —We embarked on Wed-
nesday, March 27th, just a year, less one month, since our
embarkation on the “Manhattan.” Referring to his mother he
says:—l am glad to say she was more cheerful at my departure on this
occasion. It was hard to tear oneself away after so brief and pleasant a
time at home. ... A large crowd assembled at the wharf, but people
were not nearly so enthusiastic as on former occasions. We had not much
time to say good-bye to all friends and relations, and I fear I must have
missed many out. I received a number of presents just at last from [a list
of young ladies with pretty names !], which came as a very pleasant surprise.
We made a start at about 12.30 noon, and soon got out of sight of
“ home.” . . . The following morning the Tasmanian Contingent pre-
sented a sorry spectacle, and “stables” were attended by about a dozen
men. . . . There are still a number hors de combat. Dr. Bingham
Crowther is on board going to South Africa with us, and is taking great
pains to improve their lot. [The brave lieutenant was ill also, but, being
orderly officer, he had to set his teeth and] “had to set too whether I could
or no, and consequently was much better for it.” Referring to the men’s
food, he proceeds:—The officers’ mess compares rather favourably with
this : Oysters, fish, soup, all sorts of poultry, cold joint, vegetables, salads,
puddings and pastry, and fruits. With a bill of fare like this every day one
is tempted to think that some of these delicacies might have been spared for
the men. At any rate, they might have got good butter and plenty of jam.
To-day being Sunday a church parade was held in the troop deck.
Colonel Watchorn asked me to read the lessons, and I got Dr. Crowther
to read the sermon. The room was rather stuffy, but it went off very well.
The doctor’s sermon was rather long, for which I got the anathemas of
most of the congregation! [Be shorter next time, doctor.] .. . Brent
and I seem to be the only performers on the piano, but most of us can
make a noise, which at times is rather overpowering in this small saloon.
Just now five or six of the officers are singing songs decidedly secular or
comic—spoiling Sunday evening.
Thursday, April sth, 1901. —Passed Cape Leeuwin, W.A., yesterday,
and saw the last of Australia for some time. So far have had rough
weather and head winds, and have not made more than 10 knots. Last
Tuesday evening the men gave a concert on the lower deck, in which some
of the officers joined—Brent, Spencer, and Reynolds. Some of the songs
were very good. Boxing was the order of the day Wednesday evening. .. .


Was sorry to lose Groom (transferred to No. 4), but got a good man in
his place, Corporal Laughton (Paddy's brother).
One horse died a day or two ago, over which a long enquiry was held,
which did not appear to elicit much information. Have been reading
Wolseley's “ Soldier’s Pocket Book,” which contains much useful informa-
tion. Pie evidently knew what he was writing about. . . . Read also
the Gospels and Epistles set apart for this week (Passion). To-morrow
will be Good Friday. . . . Yesterday (Easter Monday) we had a great
day’s sports, the chief interest being centred in the tug-of-war between
divisions. This was carried off by No. 1 division in the first company, a
doughty set of men. Of course the 3rd division was just as good! But
somehow or other they got beaten. ... In the final heat of the
obstacle race an unfortunate accident happened, G. Blythe breaking his leg
at the shin through slipping on the ladder. . . . The only other com-
petition there was time for was pillow lighting on a greasy pole over a sail
full of water, which was most amusing.
On Easter Sunday we had a service on deck. It was my turn for
orderly officer, and I was unfortunate enough to come across a sentry asleep
at his post, and had to report him. This is a most serious offence, punish-
able with death when on active service. The colonel, however, let him off
with two days in cells, after enlarging upon the enormity of the offence. It
is one of the duties which I dislike, but, of course, discipline must be
preserved.
Thursday, nth, 1901. —Yesterday went through the ordinary routine.
In the afternoon took charge of our division, and had to put them through
various extension motions and physical drill.
War on board! A much more serious offence, however, is the incapa-
city through drink of . He was confined to his room, but broke his
arrest and collected the non-coms, together to ask them to stand by him
against the officers. He will probably be suspended for the remainder of
the voyage, and tried by court-martial at Capetown.
Saturday, April 20th.—We have now arrived close to Port Elizabeth,
where we are going for coal and instructions. The sports committee
finished up by a concert. The colonel presented the prizes to the winners
of the heavy and light weight boxing contests to Private Isles and Lance-
Corporal Edwards respectively, complimenting them on their coolness and
pluck. Bofth lies and Edwards attempted to respond, and succeeded in
saying what they did not mean. The coastline appears familiar, as it is
about ten months since I was along here before.
Sunday, April 21st. —Port Elizabeth. Beautiful day. Held a short
service on deck as usual. Full dress parade. Seven of us went ashore this
afternoon, but were not prepossessed with what we saw. Electric trams
were very good, and run smoothly, but with the exception of the middle of
the town, where there are some very fine buildings, there is not much to
see. The people are a very heterogeneous lot, the native element being very
evident, and in some cases apparently very well off. I saw one little black


girl going to Sunday school in bright blue plush and red satin, with stock-
ings and shoes to match.
I see by the papers that Plumer has got into Pietersburg, and that
Lieutenant \\ alter has been shot, which lam extremely sorry to hear. I
hoped we should have had a hand in clearing that line. Perhaps we shall
now. The Boers appear to have been very much harrassed everywhere, but
are still holding out, although in a very sorry plight.
Wednesday, April 24th. —Railway. Here we are again speeding on the
same route to the front as about 10 months ago we travelled to Kroonstad.
Our destination this time, however, is Cradock, north of Cape Colony*
where a small commando has been giving some trouble. We are to join
Colonel Hague, who is scouring the district with a flying column. We
left the “ Chicago” this morning, sending away a tremendous load of
baggage in two lighters, and leaving ourselves by another. We first
marched up to the stores, where the men were supplied with rifles and
the officers with carbines, and then we went to the Feather Market, where
the good people of Port Elizabeth had prepared a lunch for us, which was
very acceptable. They go to a lot of trouble to receive contingents
hospitably, as a great many troops have lately passed through here since
the plague in Capetown.
I did not meet any of those I had met before, but someone let the
cat out of the bag, and I was soon seized upon for signatures. After being
fully equipped as to arms and ammunition we marched the Ist Company
down to the station, and made a start about 1.30 p.m., the others following
about three hours later. As to the journey, the country is greener than on
my former trip, and there seems to be a little grass about. The rainy
season has just com to an end—or rather I hope so.
Cradock, Saturday, April 27, 1901. —We arrived here at about 8.30 on
Thursday morning. The second train caught up to us once on the way, and
arrived here about an hour after us. We immediately started to detrain the
horses, and were soon in a grand muddle. No breakfast, no arrangement
for feeding horses, not enough nosebags, and about a dozen trucks to
unload. The Q.M.S. got orders to issue no rations till the trucks were
unloaded—goodness knows why! I had No. 1 Company marched up to
the “ tucker” truck and given a ration of biscuits and bully beef, after which
they got to work with a will. Eventually we got all our horses and baggage
out to camp, about half a mile out, and then set to putting up our bivouacks.
The amount of equipment drawn is something wonderful, far more than we
require. All our saddles were condemned at Port Elizabeth and English
cavalry and Australian saddles were sent out in place of them. The former
are fairly good, but rather heavy. The others are awful things, and I hope
we shall be able to get some of our own back. We have telegraphed for
them to come up. There was a parade this afternoon in full marching
order, and, barring the saddles, everyone was fairly well equipped. The
Q.M.S. has a lot of stuff to return. Suche was given a command to-day in
No. 1 company in the place of M'Cormick, who is appointed adjutant. He
will make a smart officer, and seems a very good chap.


Roodwal Camp, Thursday, May 2nd. —We shifted camp to
this spot yesterday, arriving here about 11.30 a.m. We were some time
getting off on account of getting all the spare baggage packed up. We
have eight wagons, two Scotch carts, one Cape cart, and four pack mules,
which seems a lot for 250 men. On Sunday we had some mounted drill,
as usual, and in the evening went to the English Church, 68 men and
M'Cormick and myself, and we packed the little church full, although the
clergyman, Mr. Lee, had got a lot of chairs specially for us. He is a
jolly old chap, a regular Irishman. One of the hymns was “ for absent
friends,” which I suspect he had on purpose. On Monday and luesday the
ordinary camp routine went on, nothing much to do except issuing equip-
ment, of which we have far too much. I went into Cradock several times to
get several things, such as a lantern and light axe, and also a light canvas
tent, which Blyth and I, who sleep together, had made on the Egyptian
principle, and it is a great success in every way- On Tuesday afternoon the
division leaders took charge, and gave some patrolling and skirmishing
exercises.
Thursday Night, May 2nd. —Out on outpost with my division. The
Boers having been seen close round we have to be on the alert. I have
only one non-com. to post the men, Corporal Orr, so I am doing non-com.’s
work myself. Robinson and Taylor are on other picquets. We have a
lovely moonlight night, and I am writing this by moonlight, sitting in a
Kaffir kraal, having just been round the outposts.
There are several farmers about here, mostly Dutchmen, and some of
these are keeping the Boers going. The farm next our camp belongs to a
Mr. Michan, who claims to be of French extraction, and very loyal, but one
has to be very careful and not believe all you hear. He is very well off,
having made a fortune out of goats and ostriches. He is a great believer
in Angora goats.
Sunday, May sth, igoi. Line Bank. —Received orders last night to
shift camp to here, which is down the line 13 miles from Cradock. This is
only about five miles from Rood Wal, but we had to go nearly all the way
back to Cradock to get on to the road here, as the hills intervening are very
steep. A commando of Boers is reported to be only about five miles from
here (Scheeper’s),so we may possibly have a scrape shortly. We have a very
good camping-ground, not shut in like out last, and consequently much
easier to look after, not requiring half the number of outposts. We are
close to a farm occupied by an ex-Australian “jackeroo,” who treats us
right royally. He asked us all into lunch when we arrived at about 2.30
p.m., and invites us there whenever we feel inclined to go. He is a young
fellow, married, apparently about four years. The only other inmate of
the house besides his wife and young children is a lady help or governess,
Miss Andrew. (His name is Drake.) It is pleasant to see an Australian
again. On Friday the Colonel, Adjutant, and I rode out along the Graaf
Reinet-road, and, through a very deep pass, which was fortunately clear of
the enemy, otherwise we should probably have been wiped out. Yesterday
Blyth and I rode into Cradock to arrange for the parson to come out


to-day, but he was ill in bed. It was fortunate that no arrangement was
made, as we moved on.
hriday, May 10th, 1901. An Eventful Week. —Monday I spent in camp,
being 0.0. for the day. I did some reading and writing. In the afternoon
reports of all sorts came in re Boers being all over the place, and a party
of 40 Boers attacked the C.M.Rs. at Cradock. The Colonel took this as
a feint, as no possible good could come of it, and expected an attack on
the camp. Consequently all the men were roused out at 10 p.m., and
started to dig trenches and fix up bag shelters, and putting out pickets
all over the place. We then lay in the trenches all night; and wasn’t
it cold! The attack never came off, however, and morning arrived without
any excitement. Ihe men could not make out what it was all about, and
were rather sorry it ended in nothing. On Tuesday reports still flew about,
and I was sent out with a strong patrol to patrol Mortimer and down the
valley towards Drennan and back. Hallam and Chalmers were sent out
to Dreifontein. I visited several farms—Jordaun’s, De Klerk's, Biltings,
and several others. Air. and Airs. Jordaun were at Cradock, but an old
man and his elderly daughter were there. I tried to gain some information
from them, but could not get much. We noticed two men galloping away
from the house before we came, but this they denied. I think they are
very suspicious. De Klerk is supposed to be very loyal, but I ha’e ma
doots. These Dutch seem to be very clannish.
We arrived home at dark ven r tired, so I had some tea, and soon
turned in. I had not been in bed half an hour, however, when despatches
came in for our regiment to move out at once and guard the line from
Alortimer to Dassu Dieu, so as to keep the Boers from crossing the line
westwards. Boot and saddle without delay, and by 10 p.m. we were on
the march. Lovely moonlight night, just the time for a good march. Every
man was well armed, and we had no waggons, all provisions, etc., etc., were
to come on the following day. We marched along exactly the same route
as I had been that afternoon, and nothing eventful occurred on the way.
We surrounded one suspected house and searched it, finding all right. We
halted at Drennan at about 3 a.m., until daylight. We exptected to meet
Boers at every turn, but found the way clear. After dividing what rations
were on the waggons amongst the men. we started on again. We had been
leaving various divisions along the line. Hallam and I were the last two
between Dassu Dieu and Stone Bridge, about two miles. We passed over
some very rough ground to get there, which Suche had to protect, but
which did not need it. I placed two picquets out, and Hallam two, and
we were prepared and even anxious to receive cavalry that night. AA T e had
no provisions, expecting some to come by every train. On Wednesdav
night our picquet heard several loud explosions, which they supposed to
be the Boers blowing up the line, and they proved correct. They broke
it up and cut the telegraph wires not far from Suche’s outposts, and got
through. In the afternoon of Thursday Blyth took a patrol towards
Ganna Hoek, and got caught by a party of Boers in a narrow pass, and
had to run the gauntlet. He got three men wounded —one seriouslv, being
SECOND IMPERIAL BUSHMEN.


shot through the head—and four horses. Brownell had his horse shot,,
and, after wounding several Boers, had to surrender, having run out of
ammunition. He was stripped of everything, save his trousers, and sent
away back. Warburton, the badly-wounded man, was brought in in an
ambulance, and has been sent to Cradock. He had a piece of his skull
shot off, but when the ambulance came to him he was asleep and snoring! !
On Tuesday evening we received orders to concentrate at Mortimer. This
meant another night march for us, but we are getting used to doing with-
out sleep, or snatching it when we can. We had had no provisions while
we were at Dassu Dieu, but we soon replenished our larder by comman-
deering some flour and baking powder, butter, fowls, mealie, and salt, so
we were well supplied. A large consignment of rations arrived by train
just as we were starting back. These we sent back. We arrived here
(Mortimer) at about 9 p.rn., after a very dark and unpleasant ride. We
missed the road several times, till Leigh Hewitt came to the rescue several
times and guided us. We got orders last night to reconnoitre about
Ganna Hoek, and made a reconnoisance in force. About 150 men went
out, and soon came across the Boers. Several men rode up too far ahead,
and got fired upon, whereupon they lost no time in retiring. We had three
divisions on each side of the road, on the hills, dismounted, and we returned
the fire. No damage was done on either side, and we returned at about
2.30 p.m., having located their position. Camp here at Mortimer is not
a very good one, being pitched on a series of rubbish heaps. We are
quartered in a large room, apparently built as a store. Fifty C.M.Rs.
stationed here under Captain Booth and Lieutenant Taylor.
Saturday, May nth. —All available hands went out again to-day to
Ganna Hoek, and found the Boers had decamped. Kopjes very steep and
strong; splendid grass; abundance of game. Arrived home very late and
very tired.
Sunday, May 12th. Halesowen.—Late up. Sleeping in the big room at
Mortimer. Arranged for patrol to go out to get horses seen yesterdav, but
orders came to shift camp at once to Halesowen. We arrived here at 4
p.m., and pitched camp on an open rise. Marching all day in a duststorrm
Elliot's farm, three miles north of Cradock, Wednesday, May 15th. —
Arrived here at about 2.30 yesterday, staying at Heathcote’s farm at
Halesowen only one day. During that time I stayed in camp and spent
most of the time writing letters.
TROOPER THOMPSON’S LETTER.
Sir, —You have kindly asked me to write an account of our doings in
South Africa.
We left Tasmania on March 27th, 1901, and after a very pleasant
passage arrived at Port Elizabeth about April 24th. We disembarked
four days later, and took train for Cradock, about 170 miles inland.
Cradock is rather a nice little town itself, but the surroundings are any-
thing but pleasant, there being only karoo veldt and a few mimosa bushes


scattered along the low ridges. We had about four days there, getting
our horses in going order; and then we went on trek. Our first business
was patrolling the line for some distance below Cradock, and it was whilst
doing this that we had our first encounter with the Boers. We cannot
take much credit for the fight, as everyone was new at the game, so we
did not then do much damage.
Shortly after this we joined Colonel Scobell’s column, and had the
extreme pleasure of knowing what it was like to be jerked over a big
lot of country surrounding an imaginary enemy, and experiencing some
very rough weather. I can't help saying it, but I think Colonel Scobell
was a fool; he had a lot of niggers for Intelligence, and the way they
had in surrounding other columns was something deadly. I will give
you an instance of his cleverness. He had us marching from 6 one
morning till about 4 the next morning, and then he posted us all along
some ridges, to wait till the Boers, as we supposed, came along. The
party we were waiting for came all right, but they weren’t Boers at all:
it turned out to be Colonel Gorringe’s column, and Colonel Scobell and
his black scouts were heartily wished to be somewhere else outside
Africa,
Almost immediately after the above affair we became attached to
Colonel Gorringe's column, and found out what hard work was in real
earnest; but with Colonel Gorringe it was not so annoying. He worked
us very hard, but we had the satisfaction of knowing that it was not all
a wild-goose chase. On the third or fourth day after joining him we
had our second bout with the Boers, and we did much better work than
on the previous occasion, and gave every satisfaction to all concerned.
Colonel Gorringe complimented us on our smart work, and had never
credited Tasmania with producing such good fighting blood.
We remained with Colonel Gorringe for seven months, and in that
period we were made acquainted with the ins and outs and ups and downs
of guerilla warfare. We trekked harder, lived rougher (and had very
little satisfaction for it) than any other column on the field. We also
hold the record for both long and short marches. Our short march was
after General Smuts, who, I must say, had marvellous luck in escaping
us. For four weeks we were on his heels every day, and in that time
we covered something between 750 and 800 miles. Our longest day was
64 miles in 24 hours. It was at the close of that long march that Colonel
Gorringe left us to take an appointment in Egypt. We were all sorrv
at his leaving, as he was a thorough gentleman, and there was not a
man in Africa more keen on the Boers than he was. We started with
him without any reputation, and when he left us we were considered one
of the best fighting regiments in Cape Colony. Our next move was with
a Colonel Lukin. He was O.C. of the C.M.R.’s, but he did not reign
very long. I think too much of the little black bottle was his chief trouble,
so they appointed him to something in charge of a district where there
were no Boers.
SECOND IMPERIAL BUSHMEN.


We next joined Colonel Scobell again, and found that he had changed
his scouts, hut was still as erratic in his movements as ever. He had
made a name for himself in the time that we were away. He had, with
more luck than good management, got Lotter and commando boxed up,
and the consequences were that he carried another star on his shoulder,
and a chest like a pouter pigeon! Our second dose with him was of three
months’ duration, and it was a very hard dose to swallow with all hands.
We had to continually replace our scouts, as more often than not when
they went out they were either killed or wounded. I think that there
must have been a lot of the sky pilot about him. He never seemed satisfied
with the veldt, but always had us climbing mountain after mountain, with
no possible benefit. He finally ended by dragging us to the top of the
Drakensberg Range, about 8500 ft. high, and then back to Dordrecht, our
headquarters for Christmas. Here he took suddenly ill, to everyone’s
relief, and was ordered home. After dodging about for a week or two,
we entrained at Stormberg Junction, to join Colonel Doran. He was
the slowest man we had been with, but somehow we managed to have
several bouts with the Boers, and each time improving our reputation.
He liked us very well as fighting men, but I think if it had been possible
for him to have got another regiment he would have dispensed with our
services. He tried to run the column on as cheap a line as possible, and
the T. 1.8. had altogether different ideas on the subject. It was a sore
point with the colonel to have to give a farmer compensation for his
garden being destroyed and his fencing poles taken for firewood. He
had stacks of guards to see that nothing was touched, and any amount
of fresh orders; but he might have saved himself the trouble, as the
most honest man in civil life will become the biggest thief on active service,
and the Tasmanians generally were no exception to the rule. They seemed
to delight in stealing anything that came in sight.
We did our full 12 months of active service, and although we were
the first regiment to be called upon for anything that required pluck and
dash, although we had such regiments as the 17th and 9th and sth Lancers,
also Connaught Rangers, on the same columns with us, we were always
preferred to any of the others. [Speak up, Tassie!]
The Boers I think were good fighters; they seemed to have real good
judgment, and were very stubborn when they liked; but I cannot say
the same for the Dutchmen, who used to join the colonial corps, and
others who were used for Intelligence; they appeared to be the wasters,
as they would sooner run than show fight. I think it was chiefly on
this account that so many good men lost their lives. They would be
mixed up with a lot of different nationalities in an irregular corps, and
put too much faith in them, and in consequence were left in the lurch
when it came to a tight corner.
I hope my poor effort will meet with your approval, and also that
I have not gone beyond your limits; so I will close with wishing you every
success with your publication.


A. C. Pegg’s Diary.
April 24, 1901. —Landed in South Africa. At Port Elizabeth was
entrained for Cradock, after being served with rifles, bandoliers, and
bayonets. Our horses are sent on after us. Stay until the Ist May in
Cradock, and get fully equipped. A few articles of what are drawn :—Saddles
and bridles, patrol cans, nose bags, emmergency rations, and field bandages
for the troopers, and a full convoy, including waggons and mules, Scotch
carts, Cape carts, with black boys for drivers, made up of kaffirs chiefly.
May 1. —Move out of Cradock to hold the railway line about a day’s
march south, halting first at a siding called Limebank, where we threw up
earthworks in front of trenches. From Limebank we move to Mortimer,
still on the railway line.
May 7. —Boers under Scheeper’s blow up and cross the railway line
a mile or two Cradock side of Mortimer.
May B.—First troop of “A” Squadron go out patrolling, and are
ambushed at a place called Ganna Hoek by Scheeper’s commando. Jack
Warburton is fatally wounded, Saunderson and Burton slightly wounded
about the head. Warburton and Brownell are taken prisoners and
taken into the Boer lines, where three of the enemy lie wounded. Brownell
gets the D.C.M. for fighting until the ammunition runs out which he car-
ries, while the body of the unconscious man, Warburton, is lying near him.
These men, when they knew there was no escape, shot their horses. About
a half-dozen horses are shot.
May 9. —The squadrons go out and have another skirmish with Boers.
They retire after a couple of hours’ fighting. Our casualties are nil.
May 11. —Hear that J. Warburton has succumbed to his wound,
which is through the top of the head. This is Tasmania’s first cable of
our arrival.
May 12. —Move towards Cradock again, but halt at a siding, Snowdon.
Heavy rain.
May 14. —Move through Cradock and halt at a camp previously called
Starvation. Very cold. Saw a very large tribe of baboons.
May 16.—Join Colonel Scobel at Cradock and move north.
May 17. —March 42 miles. Halt finally at 11 p.m. The Tasmanian
horses suffer severely from cold, want of food of an acquired taste, and
long marches.
May 19. —The scouting intelligence of the column engage about 40
Boers.
May 21. —Split up the column. Tasmanians move Cradock way,
while a patrol of Brabant’s Horse go out to the east. They capture 40
Boer horses.
May 22. —Get some remounts, mostly Cape ponies. Tasmanian horses
dying very fast. The dismounted men are sent on to Conway by rail,
not having enough remounts.


May 24. —Move from Conway towards Middelburg, but turn back and
go Maraisburg-road. The big guns have some practice in honour of the
late Queen Victoria. Saw an immense hock of spring bok.
May 25. —A continuation of saddle up and unsaddle owing to so many
despatches coming.
May 26.—Move through Maraisburg late at night. In afternoon
through bad intelligence we are galloped on to a position which the Boers
are supposed to be holding, about six miles from the town. Return ta
Flaak Poort. Two Tasmanians break their horses’ necks.
May 29. —Start to climb the Stormberg Ranges. Very cold. Snow-
ing fast. Two men nearly die with the cold. Our blankets are not able
to be brought up after us. Allowed no camp hres, as the commando of
Boers, which are in our front, are camped at the bottom. In the morning
our rihes have to be heated over hres owing to the bolts being frozen
fast. We are also very ragged, not able to get enough clothing. Colonel
Watchorn was our officer.
June 1. —Climb higher up the mountains to a small coaling town,
Syphergat. Colonel Scobel leaves us. He gives us a good working
name in our presence. Still terribly cold. Our blankets are stiff of a
morning with snow, sleet, frost, etc.
June 2. —Go off the mountains to join Colonel Gorringe.
June 4. —Working with Gorringe. We engage a few Boers for about
an hour. Mobile columns driving the Boers north. We hre on our
own men to stop them from riding into the Boers at a farmhouse.
June 5. —Pass hundreds of dead horses through the day. Some every
few yards.
June 7. —After Myburgh’s commando. Loot his house in the Lady-
grey district. Major Murray shells the Boers on our right flank. A
rush to arms, and hold some kopjes on Myburgh’s farm. A spy is caught
by the C.D.F.
June 8. —Move back on the Ladygrey-road. Locate the enemy at a
farm, Driefontein. A column is supposed to be holding a pass in their
rear, but through some small incident fail to get there. The big guns
first open on the Boers. “A” squadron of Tasmanians are ordered to the
left flank, and “B” to the right, while the colonials of Cape Colony are
sent round to hold a pass on the rear right flank. The Tasmanians
advance very fast on to the Boer position, which is a very flat-topped
kopje, and a splendid position to retire from. The R.H.A. are covering
the Tasmanians’ advance; but they advance so quickly that we are taken
for the Boers, and two pom-poms and two 15-pounders are turned on us,
but with no effect, although the shells burst all around. Intelligence says
that 16 of the enemy were killed or wounded, while one of our men was
missing, and two or three wounded, belonging to the C.D.F. Hear that
the Boers are fighting among themselves, some wishing to surrender.
June 10. —Cross Kraai River for the fourth time, going towards
Burghersdorp. Tommies stick their arms in a tree for honey up to the
shoulder, and the old Dutch lady calls them anything but gentlemen.


June 13. —Camp in an oat paddock near Burghersdorp. The G.F.C.
give a social on the eve of their departure.
June 14. —Move through Burghersdorp and halt near. We are issued
with a pound of wood or coal per man per day to do cooking. The object
of our camp is for rest and warm clothing, which is fulfilled before going
on trek again.
June 21. —Issued with bell tents, but have not time to trench them.
About midnight starts to rain in torrents, and continues all next day. We
are flooded out of bed, the tents also are flooded. Our camp is like a
lagoon, saddles, bridles, blankets, rifles, bandoliers, and, in fact, all
accoutrements are washing about in the water. The consequences being
that after a lot of Tasmanians and others are sent to the hospitals suffering
from different complaints. Our missing men turn up by train. The
two we fired on galloped into Major Murray’s column. A return social
to C.D.F.
June 27. —Move out on Steynsburg-road. Our rest was much
enjoyed. The garrison play Tasmanians and Tommies football, mostly
Rugby. Tug-of-war, tent pegging, and riding young horses spend a great
deal of time. The remount camp near Burghersdorp had 3360 young
horses in it, mostly farmers’ wild ones driven in. Carry 200 rounds of
ammunition per man. From 27th until July 2we travel Steynsburg
direction in zig-zag style. Having mostly 3 a.m. reveille, and find it very
cold. Between Stormberg and Steynsburg there was wild game in
abundance of nearly every sort.
July 2. —The Tasmanians split in halves, “B” Squadron going under
Colonels Watchorn and Gorringe, and “A” Squadron under Captain
Henderson.
July 3. —Cut railway line at Theibus Siding, near Steynsburg.
Gorringe’s scouting intelligence engage a Boer patrol, and have a willing
time for a few hours, losing nearly all their horses; and but for the timely
assistance of the column with the big guns, would have lost them all, and
perhaps been taken prisoners. J. Orr, T. 1.8., had his horse shot dead
under him; and Scritchley, Tasmania, had his water-bottle blown off.
July 6.—Captain Henderson, with “A” Squadron of Tasmanians,
joins Captain Sandiman, of the 17th Lancers, to hold a pass in the
mountains six miles from Steynsburg. Patrols are sent out every day
to reconnoitre the surrounding country. From here we go bok shooting.
The hills are abounding with deer of many kinds. Van Reenan’s home
is near our camp.
July B.—Break up camp and move to Steynsburg, where we wait for
a convoy to go patrolling in the rear of various columns. George Blyth,
who broke his leg on “Chicago,” going to South Africa, joins us again.
July 11. —Leave for four days’ patrol, fully equipped. The Tasmanian
advance guard over very mountainous country. Halt at a place where we
get orders to hold Doom Hoek, and a very treacherous-looking place 22
miles from town.


July 12. —Doom Hoek. —Parties go out deer shooting with much
success. The first and second troop Tasmanians go on Cossack post.
Orders given in case of an attack to take and give no quarter. Have to
shift camp owing to so much dust; was just blinding. Camp alongside
of Van Reenan’s father’s farm. Allowed sit>* oats per day per horse.
July 15. —Move close to Maraisburg, and camp, and leave five men
with some spare rations, but the Boers drive them away; but they burn the
foodstuffs first. The object of our patrol is mostly to pick up a few
rebel farmers, burn anything in the line of grain and grain flour, old arms
or ammunition, and, in fact, any contraband of war; also shoot all wild
horses, that seem to be very plentiful. Getting very hard work, climbing
mountains, doing outposts and fatigues. A patrol goes out, consisting
of 20 men, for a rebel farmer. The way his wife and family take it to
heart is only a sight for times of war, as he only had a few moments to bid
them good-bye, and for how long nobody knew. Every day we seem to
be expecting a skirmish with the Boers, but the columns in our front keep
the country clear.
July 17. —Move on over very rough country to the Stormberg Ranges,
to where we spent the night of the 29th of May, and, similar to that night,
it was snowing. After leaving Menzie’s Nek we next made for Molteno,
having always to get rations from the garrisoned places.
July 20. —Move back towards Steynsburg, through Doom Hoek, but
turn south again. Take a rebel for having in his possession enough
provisions to last 100 men some few days. We were issued with what
was for the enemy, so did not mind a rebel of his sort, on the condition
that we could catch him at the right time. We also found two horses
at an Englishman’s farm in a donga, with two sheets of tin over them.
They were useless, as they were more bone than flesh.
July 23. —Pass through Maraisburg, and halt at Vlaak Poort for two
days.
July 25. —:Have two or three days’ climbing the mountains; it is
thought to shoot wild horses. At night come down to camp, a very tedious
journey, and to us for very little reason. About 7000 feet was scaled each
day, and so rough that our horses were continually falling on the incline.
After leaving the mountains make towards Tarkastadt.
July 30. —Tarkastadt. —Have a concert at the Soldiers’ Home at night.
The Tasmanians take a prominent part. Some Tasmanian sergeants come
from Captain Lewis to join us.
August 1. —Move south to Winterberg Ranges. Tarkastadt Town
Guard are attached to us for a few days. The columns are forming a
cordon round Kritzinger.
August 2. —Halt on the mountains. Our cordon round the enemy is
40 miles long. We throw up sangers and dig trenches at a place called
Zuur Plaats, do observation posts, outposts, and patrol the country for
miles round. Near here the Tasmanians caught a Dutchman moulding
bullets; also got a lot of out-of-date firearms. Kritzinger attacks the 17th


Lancers to break the cordon, but without success; but afterwards breaks
through the Midland Mounted Rifles, a Cape colonial corps.
August 7. —Left for Modderfontein afterwards, the scene of the 17th
Lancers’ reverse, when the officers of “C” Squadron were all either killed
or wounded seriously, and 42 of the men killed and 30 odd wounded, out
of 106. We halted at night near the finest orange grove that I ever saw,
the size of them being immense, and growing as thick as the trees could
hold them.
August 10. —We enter Maraisburg. Saw some immense flocks of
spring bok. Do not think lam exaggerating when I say that there were
thousands.
August 12. —Maraisburg. —Amuse ourselves by tug-of-war among the
troops. This town only for one and one-half English families would be
entirely Dutch, although in a long-possessed British colony. The Boers
have taken a blockhouse between Maraisburg and Steynsburg, and crossed
the line. Very heavy volley firing.
August 14. —Reville at 3 a.m., and gallop about six miles to reinforce
Gorringe, who has surprised Kritzinger’s commando and been fighting for
some days, capturing Commandant Erasmus and a Field Cornet, as well
as about 90 horses, with all equipments, blankets, and provisions. A
despatch sends us back to Steynsburg for supplies for Gorringe’s flying
column.
August 16.—We start after Gorringe with an oxen convoy, consisting
of 720 oxen and 70 black boy drovers. It is useless to try and tell what
sort of a noise was made by these natives. We pass over the ground that
has been fought over. Empty shrapnel were found lying about. Some
half-dozen cases were found within a few yards of a farmhouse, while the
contents were found strewn for chains around. Empty cartridge boxes
were found, showing that the men had evidently used their own bandolier
supply and drawn on the convoy ammunition, while behind each rock were
lying hundreds of empty Lee-Metford cartridge cases. An escort meet
the waggons from Peuterstadt, and we return to Steynsburg.
August 21. —After getting remounts we again make for Peuterstadt,
where we remained until G.F.C. comes along for us. They have crossed the
river after the enemy into the Orange Free State. Twice while we were
waiting we are informed by bad intelligence that the Boers are attacked
by some unknown column, which meant saddle up and get away at a
moment’s notice. The rest of the time was spent patrolling, cricketing,
writing, reading.
September 5. —Move out of Peuterstadt a few miles to join G.F.C.,
and leave the 17th Lancers, who return Tarkastadt way. We move off
Burghersdorp direction, and, instead of dog biscuits, we are issued with
1 lb. of flour per man.
September 10. —We are going Jamestown direction. The weather
is getting very cold. Get another drenching at night. Plenty of snow.


September 13. —Near Sterkstroom the weather was cold beyond a
joke. We are following up Smuts’s commando with between 700 and 800
men.
September 15. —Swamped out of bed at midnight. Make a fire and
lie down by it in my great coat. Roads in very bad state; impassable
for convoy.
September 17. —Raining still, but not so heavy. A hasty reveille;
about 10 minutes to get up, get scoff, roll bedding, and saddle up and move
off, the object being to capture a Boer picket of five men before daylight,
and then surround the whole commando, but owing to a donga being
flooded we were unable to cross, so that when we found a crossing place
it was near daylight. When the first man put his head over the skyline
the Dutchmen fired explosive bullets at him. Then we all opened fire,
and they put up their hands, but as the firing never ceased they thought
they may as well be shot getting away as standing with their hands up;
and were therefore able to inform their Commandant that we had made a
move from the place where we camped for two days owing to the wet
weather. Our prisoners proved to be two Free Staters who had been
all through the campaign, from the very first shot, and neither had been
even wounded or sick. One, on being asked as a joke where his girl
was, replied that she was alright in a concentration camp; and when asked
about the proclamation on the 15th September, 1901, he said that he had
heard of so many proclamations that he took no heed of them, and treated
them, likewise to his comrades, with contempt.
September 21. —Since the 17th have been getting very hard marching,
and very little food for three days; scarcely getting anything but what
we could pick up ourselves in the line of bread, mealie flour, mealies,
poultry, pumpkins, etc., but found these very short. We also do very
late marching and very early reveilles, chasing Smuts south into the
Cradock district.
September 24. —Travelling slightly north since the 21st. Our convoy
is lightened. Every man that has two blankets is ordered to burn one;
also, if you have any spare kit of any sort, such as extra clothing, curios,
etc., they have to be done away with. Each mule is to carry 20 men’s
bedding. Nearly every day we have seen some few of the enemy, who
seem to have been killing a lot of horses, mostly English, which were
taken from the 17th Lancers on the 17th. Sight the Tarkastadt Hills.
“B” Squadron of 17th Lancers take some prisoners wearing their
comrades’ clothing, i.e., British; one having on a peculiar striped shirt
belonging to the late adjutant. These were immediately shot. They
were also wearing the “death or glory” badges (Lancers).
September 27. —Since the 24th been travelling south, getting one or
two prisoners every day, and among them were two Europeans. We get
into very mountainous country, with an abundant growth of shrubs and
grass. Been doing all night marching.
September 28.—1 was kicked by a remount from Sheldon Siding, and
was rendered unconscious for three and a half days. Was sent to


Grahamstown Public Hospital, where I was taken care of splendidly by
Doctors Drury and Williams. After the column had been remounted
they moved out to surround the commando, on an all-night march, at a
farmhouse in the Sunday River Valley, but owing to false intelligence on
the part of our scouts surrounded the next farm to where the commando
were camped. From now until the 14th of November I heard very little
of the column, only that they had been doing some very hard marching
over extra rough country, and doing some little fighting, killing a terrible
lot of horses, and sending a great number of men to the hospital who were
unable to stand the hard work, night marching, little sleep, foot slogging,
and, worse than all, the scarcity of food.
November 14. —The Tasmanians are detrained at Stormberg from
Biesje’s Poort, where we join Scobel. Gorringe is leaving to fill a position
in Egypt.
November 15. —We move out Molteno direction, but turn afterwards
towards Jamestown. Take an oxen convoy as far as Jamestown.
November 18.—Our scouts are surprised by a Boer patrol on Fuchee’s
commando. We have three men killed and three wounded. Jack Orr,
of the Tasmanians, was killed, Geo. Blyth taken prisoner after being
stripped, while T. Lyall had a very narrow escape. The other men who
were killed were first wounded, and then afterwards shot with a revolver.
November 19. —Camp all day near Private Orr's grave. Lieutenant
Bisdee, \ .C., reads a burial service over him, and then his grave is done
up splendidly by the men.
November 20. —Moving through very rough country. Take six
prisoners belonging to a newly-formed commando of a deserted soldier
from the Cape Police and another colonial corps. These men were sur-
prised while bathing in a dam.
November 22. —Move into the Drakensberg Mountains. Doing a
lot of night marching.
November 24. —Besters, the deserted prisoner, is shot by the 17th
Lancers. He proves to be a very brave man.
November 26. —Patrolling the Jamestown district. Have a few
exciting chases after small parties of the enemy, getting one or two
prisoners and a bit of saddlery, horses, rifles, etc.
December 1. —Move towards Basutoland border way. Very heavy
rain and very wet blankets.
December 4. —Have crossed Kraai River on the De Wet bridge. A
night surprise on Myburgh's house, but the commandant is missing.
December 5. —Re-cross Kraai River going to Dordrecht. Tasmanians
on patrol nearly every day and night.
December 18.—Up to the 18th, where we met a convoy of supplies, we
have been having a very rough time in the mountains round Barkley East,
not being able to get enough to eat, and killing a lot of horses/which
means that a lot of men are left walking. We had one man taken prisoner
whilst scouting.


December 20. —We camped near Dordrecht, where all the other corps
got outfitted with clothing, rifles, saddlery, and remounts but the
Tasmanians, and it does not seem to matter about them. Spending a few
days of camp life.
December 25. —Have a church parade on the veldt. All ranks attend.
Only the men actually on duty are absent. Get a duff from the field force,
also tobacco, cigarettes, pipe, matches, and paper and envelopes. Have
a concert in the evening. Go some miles out with a mule waggon and get
posts out of a farmer’s fence to burn for wood.
December 27. —The column moves out Barkley East direction. I
stay at Dordrecht, and take some prisoners, under a Seaforth Sergeant
and ten men, to Bloemfontein. One was a very shrewd-looking German,
who had twice before escaped his captors.
January 23. —I joined the Tasmanians again at Dordrecht.
January 24. —All but a few details go out on patrol Jamestown
direction, and return on the 28th for remounts, after a lot of night
marching, early reveilles, etc.
January 29. —Move towards Jamestown.
February 1. —Camp at Stormberg, after passing through Jamestown,
February 3. —Awaiting orders to move, putting the time in playing
cricket. Hear that two armoured trains have collided, and that the Boers
had killed 17 men, and very seriously wounded the Stormberg
Commandant.
February 4. —Leave 4 a.m. for Molteno, and leave Molteno, on the
Syphergat line. Leave two troops with the convoy.
February 7. —Return to Molteno. Saw nothing of Boers, as they
had doubled back and crossed the railway line. Saw a kaffir wearing
nothing but a whitewashed skin. This, he informed us, was to keep the
sun and cold off.
February B.—Waiting to entrain for “Three Sisters” Siding.
February 11. —Leave for “Three Sisters” from Stormberg with horses,
saddles, and convoy.
February 13. —Join Colonel Doran at “Three Sisters.” Get a full
outfit of everything.
February 14. —Krom River station passed, and camp.
February 17. —Left the Krom River camp for a drive in the western
districts, and find it a very rough part. Two squadrons of the Coldstream
Guards hoof-pad after us, and at midday halt. The ambulances are sent
back for men that have dropped on the road.
February 18. —Flad a skirmish with the Boers under Malan, Fouchee,
and Wessels. Trooper Bes of Tasmania shoots a sub-commandant to
Malan, ex-judge of the Free State (Hugo). We also shoot one or two
others and wound some, including Malan, who is shot in the hand. Two
Tasmanians are wounded, W. North is shot through the chest, and R.
Stewart is shot in the leg. Some Yeomanry and Fifth Lancers are also
wounded.


February 20. —Send out scouts to locate Malan, who has crossed the
line to the south of Victoria West.
February 21. —General Stephens engages enemy all day on our left
flank. Moving towards Carnarvon, over the Karoo desert. Very short
of rations, and a lot of our horses are dying of poison through eating a wild
bulb that grows among the karoo.
February 24. —Camp at Carnarvon. The Tasmanians get in trouble
for taking charge of a bar and breaking things up a great deal.
hebruary 25. —Move out Victoria West way. A parade of Tasmanians,
and a lecture over the Carnarvon affair by our Colonel.
February 27. —Within a mile of Victoria West. Rained hard until
the morning of the 28th.
March 1. —Marched to Richmond-road, on railway line.
March 2. —Pass through Deelfontein, and turn back after Conroyd’s
commando, who has been trying to cross the line. Got a list of the
Federal Contingent’s names.
March 3. —Move on to the railway, where our advance is fired on
by men at blockhouses, and in about eight minutes two armoured trains
come on the scene, but our helio just prevents them from shelling us.
March 5. —The Coldstream Guards leave us; we are sorry to lose
them. We get some large boxes of cake sent from friends in Tasmania,
which we should have got before Christmas.
March 7. —Camp at Richmond all day; then move off on a night
march.
March B.—Surprise Malan’s commando, who has to get away very
quickly leaving their dinner for us, which was very acceptable.
March 10.—Ffave a skirmish with Malan’s commando. We kill one
man and wound five, including Sub-Commandant to Malan (Rudolph),
who was successor to Hugo. Here we galloped the Boers about 10 miles,
only once giving them a chance to take a position. We had 18 horses
shot, and one man wounded, Corporal Johnston, who was shot through
the top of the hat and down the jaw bone.
March 13. —Move into Murraysburg just as the Boers go out. The
inhabitants tell us that the Dutch got a very rough chasing on the 10th.
March 15. —Get into Richmond short of rations.
March 18.—Leave Richmond for Victoria West-road, but turn again
Murraysburg direction.
March 21. —Send a patrol into Murraysburg, thinking to surprise a
few Boers who patrol that place. Been having very wet 'weather.
March 22. —Move into Oudeberg supply camp, near Graaf Reinet.
Still bad weather. Offer my services for an extra six months with a lot
more Tasmanians.
March 25. —Move out on to the Kandiboo Mountains. Still wet
weather.
March 27. —On the Aberdeen-road. We hear that our kits at
Burghersdorp had been burned by an accidental fire.


March 29. —Nell Port-road. Locate the Boers, who very soon after-
wards are missing. The big guns are used, but without effect. Lieutenant
Brent, of the Tasmanians, and an intelligence, are taken prisoners by five
Boers.
March 30. —Arrive at “Three Sisters Siding,” Get news of further
■contingents from Tasmania.
April 2. —Leave “Three Sisters,” going Murraysburg direction. Just
camp, when it starts to rain in torrents, and in 20 minutes our camp is
boot-top deep in water; men and blankets saturated. We have to shift
camp to higher ground.
April 3. —Locate Malan with 17 men. The gunners get a little more
practice; also have a bit of rifle fire, following them up for three or four
miles.
April 4 —Camp near Murraysburg.
April 5 —Move towards Biesje’s Poort, and halt at farm called Skit
Kraal.
April B.—Left for Oudeberg, and halt at Mahay’s. Tasmanians get
into row for looting the town, which is not garrisoned, and a general
Boer hospital.
April 9. —Do a very fast trek to Zuur Poort, through the Kandiboo
Mountains.
April 10. —March into Oudeberg again. Wait here for men of our
column who have gone away to hold small towns against the Dutch, who
are reported to be in strong force. We put in our time until the 22nd
rifle shooting. Outposts Geo. Blyth and Scott, of Tasmania, are wounded
by a ricochet bullet at temporary butts. At this camp “A” Squadron
refuse to take clothing on the grounds that if they could not get enough
for all they would not have any. We had not enough within five-sixths.
April 22. —Leave for Murraysburg; column returned.
April 24. —Move out past Murraysburg to Aberdeen signal station.
April 27. —Move on to the Richmond-road.
April 29. —Near Victoria West. Locate the Boers. The intelligence
have a black boy murdered by Malan’s men.
May 1. —Camp at Skit Kraal and halt.
May 2. —I, with five other Tasmanians, go with two intelligence and
two natives to a farm—Boxfontein—to surprise the occupants of the house.
We get Fouchee’s brother, who was seriously wounded in the head.
May 3. —Mobilising orders, very acceptable. We give in all our
horses to the rest of the column.
May 4. —Move into Victoria West station on the east. Off horses
of the other regiments left on the veldt. We are much envied by the
“Tommies.” Colonel Doran gives us a speech, in which he says that
he would like to see men like Tasmanians fighting an honourable foe instead
of chasing bands of rebels about a very broken country.
May 5. —Getting plenty of beer, and making fair use of it.
May 9. —Left for Port Elizabeth in coal trucks, and not half enough
room to lie down.


May ii.—Landed Port Elizabeth. Run on to the wharf in the train;
off the train into a lighter ; and then on to the S.S. “ Devon.” I leave in the
"Devon” for the Coronation on 14th, at Algoa Bay.
JARDINE’S NOTES.
I quote one or two entries from Trooper Thomas Jardine’s notes.
There are some curious things in this diary, and 1 am sorry I cannot find
space for more.
May 6.—Caught first louse on myself. Captured a suspected Boar
(sic). After his papers were taken he was released.
May B.—My birthday to-day. The funniest I have ever put in.
May 9. —We had to commandeer food this morning for rations. I
was put on making scones. I mixed my dough in a blanket; it was a
sight worth seeing!
May 11. —Our division fired on the Imperial Yeomanry in mistake for
Boars when out to-day. The Midland Mounted Rifles caught the Boars
we were fighting yesterday [Seems to have been a successful boar hunt.]
killing six of them and capturing 20 horses.
June 10. —Brought up before the Colonel for disobeying orders. Got
several days’ extra picquet. The trial a farce. [Hard luck, old man.]
June 12. —A raid was made on a fowlhouse belonging to a Dutchman,
this evening. The camp is one mass of feathers!
June 17. —Was sent out this morning to look after horses whilst
grazing. Had a good look in my clothes for live stock. Had a good
catch. Was in Court House hearing trial of rebels. Colonel Watchorn
put J. S. in gaol for four days for not cleaning a sergeant’s horse. It
appears the Colonel is trying to make us all convicts.
June 23. —The Colonel is like an old woman. He is alwavs saying,
“Remember you are Tasmanians.” [Our hero had a bad cold and a sore
throat when he made this entry.]
June 29. —Whilst waiting (for column) had a sing song at the farm.
I received a cup of coffee from the girl for singing a song.
November 19. —The burial service took place this afternoon over our
dear departed friend and mate, Corporal J. Orr. Mr. Bisdee conducted
the service, which was very touching.
December 27. —A fight took place between D. lies, of Gormanston,
and G. Saunderson, of Queenstown, for £2O a side; fight to a finish; bare
knuckles; but fight under Marquis of Queensberry’s rules. The fight
started at 4 p.m., and lasted till 6.30, 52 rounds being fought. It was the
best fight that any of the crowd had ever seen. Both men received heavy
punishment. The fight will be finished on our next out span. [There is
no further reference to this prize fight. It must be remembered that this
was Christmas week.]
April 13. —Colonel Watchorn said he held an interview with
Kritzinger, who said he shall never forget the way we drove him out of
the colony. He also spoke very highly of the Australians. Received
two barrels of ale as a present from Colonel Henniker.
SECOND IMPERIAL BUSHMEN.


April 21. —A very amusing incident occurred between a few of our
boys and General French up at the Y.H. canteen. French came up to
them and asked them where the drinking was. They gave him two pints
of beer, which he drank. French offered them 2s to get some more, but
they refused.
RETURNING TASMANIANS.
Hobart, Friday.—The Governor is advised by the General of
Communications, Cape Colony, that the “Papanui ’ left, with six lasmanian
Bushmen, for Hobart, on May 18.
TASMANIANS IN ACTION.
A letter from Victoria West-road, dated April i, gives details of an
action in which the Tasmanian troops played a prominent part. On
March 10 Colonel B. Doran’s column, in pursuit of the Boers east of the
line, between Nelspruit and Victoria-road, came up with a commando of
about 150 at Taibosch Poort. The Boers, to delay the pursuit, opened
fire on the advanced scouts, but the Tasmanians turned their right flank,
and they retired, hurried by a few well-placed shells. The column promptly
moved through the poort, and closed up on the heels of the retreating'
enemy, near Middlemount. Three kopjes commanded the road, and were
held by the enemy, and the column had to check until the Tasmanians
threatened the enemy’s right. The guns had again got into play, when
the main body cleared helter-skelter clean out of touch. But a party of
about 30, moving to the right, were received by the “Tibs” (Tasmanians),
who gave chase, and narrowly missed bagging the lot. A convenient
kopje, however, interposed, and the enemy, in excellent position, held off
the Tasmanians until the guns came up. A hot fire was turned on the
kopje, and the route was resumed, but not before “toll” was taken. The
Commandant and six other Boers were wounded, one dying during the
retreat. The only casualty received by the British column was a Tasmanian
slightly grazed on the face by a bullet.
STARTLING STORY OF METHUEN’S DEFEAT.
Lieutenant Jennings, of Grimsby, who was in Lord Methuen’s disaster,
writing to his father, says:—“ The rearguard were overwhelmed by about
20 to one. About half the force was composed of colonials and half-castes,
whilst it also included several Dutchmen. All these scoundrels,” he
writes, “cleared off, some of them without even firing a shot, and they never
attempted to make a stand. They galloped off like sheep, although I
understand Lord Methuen implored them to make a stand. Our units
were overwhelmed in detail. The guns came into action within too short
range. Major Paris, with some of the sth Imperial Yeomanry, who got
into a kraal and refused to surrender, were shelled and driven out, and
although a few of them escaped, most of them had to surrender, I began
to attend to the wounded, and was being marched off a prisoner when De


la Rey came up, and I asked him to allow me to stay and do what I could
for the wounded. He consented, and I saw our dear general lifted into a
waggon and taken away. Poor fellow, his leg was shattered above the
knee. He said afterwards : ‘Thank God it was not my column and they
were not my men that ran away.’ Boers say that he and French are the
only two generals they fear and respect. The Yeomanry did well, but
shot badly. Had the colonials only stood their ground half as well
they would have saved the situation. The colonials and half-castes may
do for scouting, but not for a desperate stand against superior numbers.”
RETURNING SOLDIERS.
ARRIVAL OF THE “MANILA” AT HOBART.
AN ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME.
Hobart, Sunday.—Hobart has been in a great state of excitement
all day. According to arrangement a gun was fired when the troopship
entered the river, which took place a little after 9 o’clock, and from that
time the pier was filled with an excited crowd. Shortly after 10 o’clock
the vessel berthed alongside the Alexandra Pier, when the returning troops
were greeted with prolonged cheers and shouts of welcome. Relatives
and prominent citizens had been granted special cards, which afforded them
the privilege of going alongside, while outside the barrier an immense
concourse of thousands of people thronged every point of vantage.
Happiness beamed on every face, with the exception of a few, whose joy
was so great that tears took the place of mirth, and the impression was
that no greater contrast could ever be experienced than that over witnessing
the troops depart for the seat of war, and then to meet them returning
home victorious, accompanied with the glad tidings of peace. Among
those on the pier to welcome the troops were the Premier (Mr. N. E.
Lewis) and Mrs. Lewis, the Treasurer (Mr. B. S. Bird) and the Misses
Bird, Colonel Legge, Lieut.-Colonel Wallack, and other officers of the local
defence force. The Headquarters and City Bands were present, and
sustained cheerfulness by playing selections of patriotic airs. The men on
the whole appeared in excellent health and spirits, although some showed
signs of the long campaign. After a short delay the men were allowed to
go ashore until 10 o’clock in the evening.
At St. David’s Cathedral a thanksgiving service was held at 3 o’clock,
at which many of the troops were present, special seats being set apart for
them in the nave. Suitable prayers, chants, and hymns were used, and
Canon Shoobridge delivered a telling address of welcome to the men. The
Cathedral was crowded to excess, many having to stand in the aisle,
while hundreds were unable to gain admission.
Yesterday Trooper Inch (No. 691), of the New South Wales Bushmen,
while suffering from insanity, the result of a sunstroke, eluded his warder
while exercising on deck, and jumped overboard. Life buoys were thrown
to him, which he refused to take advantage of. A boat with the second


mate and a crew was lowered, but failed to pick up the unfortunate man,
who was drowned.
On June 2 John M. Laing, one of Brabant’s Horse, died from asthma.
The Tasmanians will be disbanded to-morrow. The “Manila’ leaves
at daylight for New Zealand via Sydney.
LAUNCESTON MEN RETURNING.
Amongst Colonel Watchorn’s returning men are many _ who
volunteered from Launceston, and their friends are, of course, overjoyed
at the prospect of receiving the bronzed warriors home again. Evening
parties and other family foregatherings are being arranged, and in some
instances the reception is likely to take a semi-public form. In one case
the gateway to a cottage near St. George’s Square was yesterday adorned
with an arch of evergreens, over which floated in all the glory of snow-white
calico and red letters the simple but warm-hearted words, “Welcome to
Dan.” If the home-coming in the city is not on the same scale as the
public welcome at Hobart, it will at least be as hearty and as acceptable in
a homely way.
HOME FROM THE WAR.
Hobart, Monday.—The troopship “ Manila," with the New South
Wales and New Zealand troops aboard, took her departure for Sydney at
11 o’clock this morning. It is understood that some of the former missed
their passage, but no official report has been made upon the subject. The
work of paying off the Tasmanian portion was commenced this morning,
and will probably occupy some time, consequent upon a few of the men
failing to put in an appearance, and it may be mentioned that the sum of
£ 10,000 was deposited with the authorities to meet the claims of the men,
some of whom will draw up to £IOO each. It may also be stated that the
“Manila,” which brought them here, has been under charter to the Imperial
Government for nearly two years, at an outlay of some £50,000 per year.
HOME FROM THE WAR.
WELCOME SOCIAL AT HOBART.
Hobart, Monday. —A promenade concert took place in the skating
rink at the Exhibition Building this evening to welcome Colonel Watchorn,
commander of the Second Imperial Bushmen, and the officers and men
under his command. According to arrangement, the returned troops,
together with members of the local defence forces, fell in at the barracks
at 7.30, and, headed by the Headquarters Band, under the command of the
acting bandmaster, Sergeant Vincent, marched through some of the
principal thoroughfares to the place of meeting. The streets along the
line of march were thronged with sightseers, so much so that some difficulty
was experienced by those holding the right of private entree to gain
admission, despite the vigorous efforts of the police, under the command


of Superintendent Pedder. The programme was a choice one, selections
being well rendered, chiefly that of “ Home, Sweet Home,” by Mrs.
Benson, which was encored, and responded to by the rendition of “ Auld
Lang Syne,” the chorus of which was taken up by the audience with
much enthusiasm. Messrs. N. E. Lewis (Premier), B. S. Bird (Treasurer),
and E. Mulcahy (Minister of Lands), were present. An apology was read
from his Excellency the Governor, who was absent owing to illness. The
Mayor (Alderman Kerr) presided.
Mr. Lewis made a lengthy speech, in the course of which he congra-
tulated Colonel Watchorn and the men under his command on the
excellent work done by them in South Africa during their 16 months’
absence. Of 250 he had taken away 167 had returned with him, 43 had
been left behind on duty, others had been invalided, and six had left their
bones on the veldt, never to return. From King Edward downwards the
colonial troops had received the highest encomiums for their work. The
Boers had proved worthy foes, and his wish with regard to the remaining
Boers was that they would soon become participators in the blessings that
the British had so long enjoyed. (Applause.)
The Mayor also addressed the returned soldiers in a most sympathetic
manner, expressing the hope that in days to come they would be able to
tell their grandchildren of the deeds they had done. (Laughter.)
Colonel Watchorn, who on rising was received with rounds of applause,
on behalf of himself and the members of the contingent under his com-
mand, returned thanks for the cordial welcome accorded them. He
detailed at some length the work accomplished by the contingent during
their 16 months’ absence, and was pleased to say that they had the
pleasure of being attached to Colonel Gorringe’s command, whose duty
was to capture, if possible, Judge Smuts, whose object was to descend upon
Cape Elizabeth. This man and those under him they had chased over
hilly country for 800 miles, and during this period the troops were called
upon to endure much hardship, having at times to turn out at an early
hour with horses covered in snow. He referred to the fact that Colonel
Doran, one of the smartest Imperial Cavalry officers, had seen proper
to report in the highest possible terms of the colonials—men who he
admitted could shoot and ride straight. (Cheers.)
The proceedings concluded with a smoke concert.
CHURCH GRAMMAR SCHOOL MEMORIAL.
A meeting of the past and present boys and friends will be held at the
Church Grammar School this evening, at 8 o’clock, to decide upon a fitting
tribute to the memory of those boys of the school who have fought for
their country in South Africa.
WELCOME TO LILYDALE TROOPS.
On Wednesday evening, in spite of the wet and stormy weather, a
large gathering of people was present at the station to greet the two


returning troopers. Right in the middle of a furious downpour the two
warriors alighted, and were immediately made the centre of an admiring
crowd of friends, all anxious for the honour of the first hand-shake.
Trooper George Somerville, in spite of a long bout of the dreaded enteric
in South Africa, looked hale and hearty, and had just time to respond
shortly to the warm-hearted greetings of his many friends and relations,
before taking train for his home at Wyena. Trooper W. C. Carlin looked
in splendid condition, and was received like his comrade-in-arms, both
being given quite an ovation.

IVE lots of soldiers had left Tasmania, making up four contin-
gents, during the two years of the war. Between the last two
Imperial Bushmen nearly 12 months had elapsed, and now,
after nine or ten months of weary guerilla warfare, there was
an impatience to see it brought to an end that prompted the
desire to send further troops. Some mutterings of this desire began to
be heard in the end of 1901, and during December the matter was brought
to the point of action. There had been some slight misunderstanding
between the Federal Premiers and the State Premiers in the matter. The
Federal Government was quite willing to take action, but desired some
hint of willingness from the Home authorities. The following press
extracts (“Daily Telegraph”) will explain the progress of the movement: —
Melbourne, Thursday.—Referring to the proposal that additional
Australian contingents should be raised for service in South Africa, the
Prime Minister (Mr. Barton) said last night: “The present position does not
warrant any such step. We have from the first said we will not take the
initiative in such a course, but if an official intimation came to us from
the Imperial authorities that more of our men were needed, we should
have to reconsider the situation. Of course, the question of expense
would not affect our decision, because presumably the men would go
under the same conditions as those despatched in the past, when the Home
Government paid all expenses.” (Dec. 13, 1901.)
TASMANIA TO SEND 60 MEN.
Sydney, Tuesday.—The Federal Premier and military commandants
were in conference last evening, when the details were arranged in con-


nection with the despatch of the federal contingent to South Africa. Ihe
force will consist of nine units, each consisting of 121 of all ranks, and
will be raised as follows: —New South Wales, three units; Victoria, three
units; Queensland, one unit; South Australia, one unit; West Australia
and Tasmania, each half a unit. The pay is to be at the rate of is 2d per
day until embarkation, when the pay will be 5s a day. Only unmarried
men will be selected, and preference will be given to those who have seen
service in South Africa.
A cable has been received from Mr. J. Chamberlain, to the effect that
if any member of the contingent wishes to allot any of his pay before
starting, it may be deducted and paid in Australia; the balance will be paid
in South Africa.
Hobart, Tuesday.—The Commandant (Colonel Legge) has received
instructions from the Federal Defence Department to prepare quarters
for the Tasmanian quota of the Federal Contingent, which is to consist of
60 men, who will be equipped, but are not to take any arms, unless other-
wise ordered.
The Premier (Mr. N. E. Lewis) desires it to be known, for the infor-
mation of those intending to join the Federal Contingent, that applications
for selection should be addressed to the Commandant, and not to the
State Government. All matters regarding equipment, etc., will be dealt
with by the military authorities, who are responsible to the Federal
Government. (Jan. 1, 1902.)
Melbourne, Wednesday.—The following clause appears in the attes-
tation form to be signed by candidates for enrolment in the Federal
Contingent:—“l do not expect to receive, for myself or any of my relatives,,
any compensation whatever from the Commonwealth Government in case
of disablement or death.” (Jan. 3, 1902.)
Hobart, Monday.—The first Commonwealth Contingent is now fully
equipped, and ready for embarkation on the 16th, and for the second
upwards of 275 new applications have been received, making a total of
800, for which there are 121 vacancies. The list of those who have applied
for commissions will be submitted to the Minister of Defence bv the
Commandant (Colonel Legge), with his recommendations attached.
Horses are bringing a high price, some of those already purchased having
cost from £25 to £4O each. (Feb. 20, 1902.)

Captain Perceval, the Staff Officer for Mounted Infantry and District
Paymaster at Hobart, is an Englishman, but if you search the map of
England from Berwick-on-Tweed to Land’s End, and from St. David’s
Head to Yarmouth, you will not be able to discover the exact place

CAPTAIN A. W. B. PERCEVAL,
.COMMANDING E SQUADRON, FIRST BATTALION, A.C.H.


where he was born. Puzzle —Where is it? In the Scilly Isles, off Corn-
wall. Never heard of the Scilly Isles? Well, 111 tell you something about
them, and then it will be interesting to hear concerning a man who was
born there, and has travelled in the ‘‘Drayton Grange from Capetown
to Melbourne!
The Scilly Islands are about 27 miles off Land’s End, and occupy
about 30 square miles of sea room. The group is composed of a vast
number of large and small islands, and of rocks and ledges duly named.
The large islands, however, number six, and are named St. Mary 5, St.
Martin’s, Bryher, Tresco (where Captain Perceval was born), St. Agnes,
and Samson. Samson, curiously enough, is the weakest —in prosperity
and population. It is uninhabited. The five others muster a total popu-
lation of 2,044. St. Mary’s is the largest in extent, having an area of 1,528
acres, and has also the most numerous population—l,29o. Then, there
are 30 smaller islands than those just mentioned, and 100 rocks and ledges,
each of which has an identity and a name for the mackerel fishers from
Cornwall, and no doubt, in the long ago, were handy to the bold, bad
“Pirates of Penzance,” and other spots on the Cornish peninsula, in the
pursuit of their adventurous profession.
An old Cornishman, who now lives at Launceston, in the Tasmanian
Cornwall, and is affectionately known to his friends as “the converted
pirate,” tells me that “Scilly” is a corruption jof “Sillis,” which in the Cornish
dialect, means “Conger eel;’’ and, as the retired pirate is both a fisherman
and a bit of a philologist and antiquarian, I have no doubt he is right.
And, by the bye, the Scilly Isles have considerable interest for the anti-
quarian. Tresco contains the ruin of an abbey of the tenth century. For
monks were there in Athelstan’s time, and from the reign of Henry I. to
that of Henry VIII., the Isles belonged to the Abbey of Tavistock, in
Devonshire. The first Henry seems to have been generous to the monks
of Tavistock —the last Henry “suppressed” them.
Their preaching, prayers, and fastings
are still the peasants’ themes
Around the coast of Cornwall.
The Island of St. Mary’s has an interesting old castle of the reign of'
Queen Elizabeth—Star Castle, bearing the Royal monogram “E.R.” and
the date 1593; and the island of Tresco has its “Cromwell Tower,” built
by the Parliamentary forces of the Revolution period. Tresco gave shelter
to the Bonnie and fugitive Prince Charlie in 1745. For two and a half,
centuries the Godolphins—Duke of Leeds family—leased the Scillys, but
it was a man with the rare name of Smith—Angus John Smith —who was
the best friend of the islands in modern times. He was not an absentee.
In 1834 he leased the islands, made his home on Tresco, and lived there
for nearly 40 years, during which he abolished the w r recker, promoted
industry, provided means of education, and became the patriarch of the
Isles. In 1872 Mr. Smith w r as succeeded as Lord of the Isles, or “Lord
Proprietor” by a nephew 7, Mr. T. A. Dorrien-Smith—a “double-barrelled”


name which has been frequently mentioned in South African war news
during the last three years. Mr. T. A. Dorrien-Smith has himself served
in the 10th Hussars in the sixties and seventies, but his kinsmen—perhaps
his sons ?—Lieutenant Arthur Dorrien-Smith and Lieutenant Edward
Dorrien-Smith have served, the one in the Rifle Brigade, and the other the
King’s Shropshire Light Infantry, in the late Anglo-Boer war, and both
have been decorated with the Distinguished Service Order. A word about
the trade of the Scillys; The staple exports are the early potato and the
yellow narcissus! As much as a hundred tons of flowers are exported
every spring from Scilly Isles.
But we were talking of Captain Perceval. Well, he was born in the
Scillys in October, 1859, just when a panic regarding a French invasion
of England was “on,” and the formation of volunteer corps of riflemen
began under the auspices of the Government. His father was clergyman
in charge of the islands; and we may be sure the Rev. Mr. Perceval actively
assisted Mr. Smith in his work of civilisation. Young Perceval got his early
education from private tutors, and was then sent to All Saints School,
Clifton, near Bristol, the headmaster of which was a gentleman named—
Smith. When Captain Perceval was 18 or 19 years of age, he went to
Queen’s College, Oxford.
The professors at Oxford at that time included the illustrious IMax
Muller, Professor of Philology—an uncle by marriage of young Perceval’s;
and the Rev. G. W. Kitchin, afterwards Dean of Winchester, and who at
this time was college tutor to unattached students. Captain Perceval spent
three years at Oxford, and left about 1882, after taking his degree of
Bachelor of Arts. It was at Oxford that he began his military career.
While at the University, he served in the ranks of the Ist Volunteer Oxford
Light Infantry.
Then after leaving Oxford, he had a commission for some years in
the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, 31st Regiment, now the East Surrey. Most
people know now that the numbering of the regiments in the British army
has been discontinued for some years past, and that the regiments have
now territorial descriptions. While serving in the 31st Regiment, Captain
Perceval attended the School of Instruction for Auxiliary Forces at Aider-
shot, and attained the first-class certificate for the rank of lieutenant;
coming out second in a class of 20. The Commandant of the school at the
time was Major Cox, afterwards Colonel of the Royal Irish Fusiliers; and
the Adjutant of the school, Major Collette, of the Shropshire Light
Infantry, who had served in the Afghan war. The Adjutant of Captain
Perceval’s own regiment was Captain R. H. W. H. Harris, who recently
commanded the 2nd Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment in South
Africa, and was wounded ten times in one day! He must indeed have
been in pretty much the same state as the Irish private who said he was
so perforated by bullets, that the man in the next bed in the hospital got
cold from the draughts that passed through him! Captain Harris was
mentioned in despatches by Earl Roberts. No. wonder. He may be
“mentioned” at many dinner tables and in a few plays and novels.


In 1888, Captain Perceval came to Australia—to accept the position
of Chief Modern Language Master at the Brisbane Grammar School —a
big Government establishment, under the- headmastership of Mr. R. H.
Roe, an old Christ’s Hospital or Blue Coat School boy. He held that
position for four years, and then spent some time in the bush, on a large
cattle station in the Upper Dawson district of Queensland.
We next find Captain Perceval at Launceston, Tasmania, in 1892 or
1893. He attained a commission in the 2nd Battalion Tasmanian Infantry
Regiment, of which he became Adjutant. In 1897 he was promoted Cap-
tain. Then he was appointed District Adjutant on the permanent staff of
the defence force. But in 1899 and 1900, he was back again in Queensland
on a year’s leave from Tasmania, attached to the Queensland Mounted
Infantry, C Company, under Captain W. Deacon, now Major Deacon, C.8.,
who has distinguished himself in the late war in South Africa.
On his return to Tasmania, Captain Perceval was appointed to the
Headquarters Staff at Hobart, as Infantry Staff Officer. While the Anglo-
Boer war was proceeding, Colonel Wallack, C.8., went to South Africa,
and during his absence Captain Perceval filled the office of Chief Staff
Officer in Tasmania with distinguished ability. He had abundant oppor-
tunity of showing his talent and resources. It was an unusually important
period; for during that time all the forces in Tasmania were reorganised,
and military affairs were adjusted with the Commonwealth Government,
which took over the defence force from the State Government, and the
visit of the Governor-General, the Marquis of Linlithgow, and the Prince
and Princess of Wales to Tasmania took place. Captain Perceval had his
hands full of work at that time—work that required the exercise of tact
and caution, but the period was passed through with conspicuous success.
Those who were in Tasmania at the time and were brought into contact
with Captain Perceval will remember his unfailing courtesv and the seem-
ingly automatic way in which military affairs “went.” And during the
“Duke and Duchess visit,” while the Chief Staff Officer was as active and
alert and courteous as ever, he was suffering acutely from an accident to
the foot, of which nobody knew anything till all the festivities were over.
When the Ist Regiment of the Commonwealth Horse was organised
for service in South Africa, Captain Perceval was given command of E
Squadron, and went out to the seat of war in command of all the troops
on board the troopship “Manchester Merchant,” composing 400 men with
300 horses. The troops were landed at Durban, and Captain Perceval
took three train loads of them to Newrastle close to Laing's Nek, and
Majuba Hill—a 36 hours’ journey by rail. The troops camped at New-
castle for some time, and were there joined by the rest of the regiment,
under the charge of Colonel Lyster, who has just assumed office of Com-
mandant of the defence force of South Australia. From Newcastle all the
troops went up through Johannesburg to Klerksdorp, in the neighbour-
hood of which they remained some weeks. After the declaration of peace,
the regiment then forming part of Colonel Thorneycroft’s forces trekked
to Elandsfontein, where they gave in their horses, and entrained for New-


castle to give up their arms and accoutrements in preparation for embarka-
tion. While near Klerksdorp, Captain Perceval was selected to command
a representative squadron of his regiment sent to the peace celebration
service at Pretoria —a joint service, in which all the religious denominations
took part, as in the memorial service for Queen Victoria, held in the Queen s
Domain, Hobart, last year, by the Imperial troops then visiting Tasmania.
Six thousand troops assembled on parade in Pretoria on that occasion, in
the presence of Viscount Kitchener and his staff. Hie spectacle was a
magnificent one, which those who witnessed it will never forget. While
at Pretoria on that occasion, Captain Perceval and his men were camped
with representatives of 45 different regiments.
Captain Perceval, as has been hinted, returned from South Africa to
Australia in the now famous (some will say “infamous") troopship “Dray-
ton Grange." He left Durban, Natal, on the nth July last, reached
Melbourne on the 7th August, and went over to Launceston by the s.s.
“Pateena,” which reached her berth in the Tamar on the 9th August. He
is now back in the old headquarters office in the Military Barracks at
Hobart, that interesting old building which was guard-house in the long
ago, when the Imperial troops were still in Tasmania. Some of the men
whom Captain Perceval took out to South Africa were discharged in that
country; others were left in hospital, two died of disease. Those were
Sergeant Morrisby, of Bellerive, and Private Fitzallen, of Ross, both of
whom died of enteric fever at Klerksdorp.
Captain Perceval is married and has a family of two boys and two girls.
It is not often that the soldier and the scholar are combined, as in Captain
Perceval. A man who shines at Oxford and Aldershot is rare. But the
Percevals are versatile —they have given a Premier to England, and no
doubt as the Staff Officer and Paymaster at Hobart is a young man, with
varied experience and undoubted talents, he will do further credit to his
name in the army of the Australian Commonwealth now being organised.
Captain Perceval’s ancestors, both paternal and maternal, have for
some centuries occupied distinguished positions in both army and navy.
One of the latter —Spencer Perceval—was Prime Minister of England, as
mentioned above, and Major-General Lord Grenfell is a near relative on
his mother's side.

E Squadron, First Australian Commonwealth Horse
One of Them.
On Saturday, February 15th, 1902, the first unit of Tasmanian troops
embodied for active service by the Commonwealth of Australia embarked
on His Majesty’s troopship “Manchester Merchant” at Hobart. Although
this unit was the sixth body of troops to leave Tasmania for service in
South Africa, no falling-off in the quality of either men or horses was per-
mitted; the only difficulty experienced in raising the squadron being that
of selecting so small a number out of some 700 eager applicants. The
embarkation of three officers, 60 non-commissioned and men, and 63
horses was carried out smartly and without a hitch of any sort, after


which leave was granted till a late hour to all, except those on duty on
board. Early next morning everyone was on board, and the vessel left
the new wharf at 10 a.m. amidst the farewells of several thousands
assembled to see the departure. The troops already on board when we
embarked consisted of the Field Hospital and Bearer Company of the
Australian Army Medical Corps, under command respectively of Major
Green and Major Howse, V.C., each assisted by several other medical
officers. The presence of these officers, and of their well trained and
equipped corps, was much appreciated by all, as they not only bestowed
much skill and unremitting care on the few cases of sickness that occurred
during the voyage, but also gave a most valuable course of lectures on
ambulance work and first-aid to the wounded. Socially, too, they took a
prominent part in promoting games, sports, and general good fellowship.
Captain Percevai, as senior combatant officer, was in command of all the
troops on board during the whole voyage. The usual details of life in a
troopship were soon attended to, and carried out with regularity up to'
the moment of disembarkation.
Calm weather prevailed during the run to Port Adelaide, which was
reached early on the morning of the 19th. Here we took on board D
Company, 2nd Battalion, together with Major Burnage, 3rd New South
Wales Bushmen, and Chaplain Green; in all, seven officers, 122 n.c.o. and
men, with 122 horses, and sailed at 2.30 p.m. Occasional rain-squalls
were met with, and a heavy swell soon reduced the numbers of men “fit
for duty,” but eventually the anchor was dropped in Gage Roads late on
the 25th. Early next morning we were alongside the wharf at Fremantle,
where we were joined by E Company, 2nd Battalion—6l of all ranks, and
61 horses, thus bringing up our numbers to 353 of all ranks, and nearly
300 horses. At 2 p.m. the same day we said good-bye to Australia for an
indefinite period. The recent arrivals on board were soon “run in” for
their share of duties, and routine was the order of the day, from reveille at
5.30 a.m. till lights out at 10 p.m., the time being well filled with scrubbing
decks, stable duties, medical inspection, parade, etc. Every morning and,
latterly, every evening as well, a large sail-cloth bath was rigged on deck
and kept filled with fresh sea-water. This was taken advantage of daily
by almost every man, and no doubt contributed largely to the general
health of the troops. An early issue of coffee and biscuits, arranged by the
C.0., was much appreciated by all who had to turn into stables at 6 a.m.
The messing throughout was excellent, and Captain Couch and his officers
were untiring in their efforts to promote the welfare and amusement of
the men. The daily inspection of the decks was religiously performed,
although Captain Couch was one day heard to remark, “It’s not much use
going round; I never have any fault to find.” The decks certainly were
wonderfully clean, being scrubbed daily and dusted wth clean sand; those
occupied by the A.M.C. in particular were irreproachable. The voyage
was uneventful, but the monotony was relieved by exercising the horses
on the upper deck whenever weather permitted, and by a two-days’ sports
meeting—at which our fellows took 80 per cent, of the prizes—winding


up with a big concert and prize distribution. At last, on Friday, Marcii
14th, the high land south of Durban appeared in sight, and we anchored
in the open roadstead at 6 p.m. Much to our disgust, no notice was taken
of our arrival until the following morning, when a tug came off with a
staff officer on board. More or less satisfactory replies were receLed to
our eager enquiries as to the state of affairs —at any rate, the war was not
over, and we were not too late. The sad news reached us also of Lord
Methuen’s unfortunate capture and severe wound. On the tug we saw a
face familiar to many of us —that of young Gerrand, who served under
Captain Lewis, and now wore sergeant’s stripes. Corporal Larner and a
party was sent up to Pietermaritzburg to draw the articles necessary to
complete our equipment, while the rest of us passed the time as best we
could on board until early on Monday morning, when we got alongside
the wharf. Here was a busy scene-gangs of chanting coolies moving
heavy burdens, soldiers, trains, horses, and the usual crowd of idle sight-
seers. Stalwart native police, clad in little besides a couple of knob-kerries,
paraded the wharves and streets, and woe to the misguided hawker or
other native who hesitated to obey their guttural orders; those knob-
kerries were not carried for show, but for use.
After a few hours’ hard work, ourselves, our horses —in wonderful
condition and spirits—and all our impedimenta were transferred from ship
to three waiting trains, the first of which, in charge of Captain Perceval,
left Durban at 3 p.m.; the second, under Captain De Passey, and the third,
under Major Green, A.A.M.C., following at intervals of an hour. The
writer travelled in the first of these. We reached Inchanga in time for
a much-needed feed of biscuit, bully, and tea —large quantities of boiling
water being found awaiting us. On board the train again, we clanked and
rattled on through the night, picking up equipment at Maritzburg, and
leaving there our surplus kit in charge of Lance-Corporal Pegg, and
reaching Mooi River at the uncomfortable hour of 4.30 a.m. Owing, no
doubt, to the cold and darkness, we failed to see the appropriateness of
the adjective (Mooi; pretty); but the R.S.O. was roused out of his tent
without ceremony, and soon showed us where the watering and kraals
were. In a few minutes every horse was off the train, led to water, taken
to the kraals and fed. This must have been much appreciated by the
poor creatures after their long confinement in the trucks. All aboard
again, and away by 7 a.m. A lovely morning, and the line runs through
picturesque country, reminding one of some parts of Australia, a similarity
increased by the frequent occurrence of large patches of wattles and blue
gums. A halt of about an hour was made at Frere, where we had an
opportunity of making acquaintance with an important feature of the war —
the blockhouse. This one, garrisoned by a corporal and four men of an
English volunteer regiment, stands on the river-bank near the bridge-head
—a new bridge, with the ruins of the former one, destroyed by the P>oers,
lying beside it. Passing Chievely—of armoured train celebrity—and
Colenso, we reached Ladysmith while it was yet light, and saw from the
train the pretty little town, showing little trace of the long siege, except


the well-known big hole in the tower of the Town Hall, the commanding
hills that surround it, and the site of the neutral camp—Fort Frank. Our
guard a Scotchman, of course —was an excellent cicerone, and did the
honours of the line to such of us as were—whatever the South African
equivalent of “new chum may be. He had himself served in one of the
local corps during the early part of the war, and was quite “au fait” with
its history, the crossings of the Tugela, Elandslaagte, Washbank, Glencoe,
Dundee, were pointed out with all the interest of one who had played a
part in the stirring scenes those names recall. At 9.30 p.m. we at last
steamed into our destination—Newcastle. Transport was ready, and after
untrucking our horses, looking very different from the sleek animals that
had left the ship, 36 hours before, we marched out to camp on the high
ground, about three miles beyond the town. Here our units, that had
travelled together from Australia, separated, the A.M.C. going to a camp
of their own, and D and E Squadrons, 2nd Battalion, joining their head-
quarters near Kitchener’s Kop. We camped close by, and met with every
kindness from Lieutenant-Colonel M'Leish and all under his command.
On the 21st March Lieutenant-Colonel Lyster and the remainder of ours
arrived, so we shifted camp and joined them. Then ensued a somewhat
tedious, byt no doubt necessary, period of detention, varied by outpost
duty at night on the hills north of the camp, where shots were frequently
heard, train escorts, and patrols to Monkey Pass, about 15 miles out —a
change much appreciated by both men and horses, as the former enjoyed
the novelty of scene and the clear, running creek, and the latter revelled
in the excellent grass. Our turn for this duty was on the sth April—no
doubt the man who had an exciting time with a monkey, under the
impression that the latter was a Boer spy trying to approach the post,
remembers the date. Both General Lyttelton and General Burn-Murdoch
came and had a look at us. They seemed pleased with the horses of the
regiment, and the former assured us that there would still be plenty for us
to do, which comforted us considerably. Some very heavy storms passed
over the camp. The lightning was something to remember, and the joys
of outpost duty on such nights, crouching on the exposed hillside amid
blinding lightning, drenching rain, and inky darkness, are more easily
imagined than described. If you moved a few yards to visit a piece of
dead ground, you probably took several most disconcerting headers over
successive ant-heaps, and dropped into what had been a road, but was
then a very respectable spruit. However, grass was good and abundant,
and no doubt the horses benefited by the rest.
At last, on the 9th April, orders came for us to move, not, as we had
hoped, northwards towards Pietersburg, but to Klerksdorp, in the Western
Transvaal. On the 10th the New Zealand Brigade, who were camped
near us, entrained, followed by ourselves a little later, while the 2nd Bat-
talion went by road over Laing’s Nek and entrained at Volksrust for the
same destination. As our guard—another Scotchman—told us that the
districts through which our route lay were still somewhat disturbed, and
that the regular train usually halted all night to avoid sniping, we did


not expect to get through without incident. Nor were we disappointed. Just
after dark, and when near Vlakfontein, sharp firing was heard. The train,
halted under cover of a blockhouse, whose little garrison was busy pump-
ing lead into the veldt around, and a small party of officers descended to
reconnoitre. The firing ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and as it was
too dark to see anything, the train proceeded. We reached Johannesburg
about dawn. No stop there, merely ran on to the line and proceeded. We
passed Krugersdorp (of Jameson raid celebrity) and halted at Frederick-
stadt early in the afternoon. After waiting here some time, we untrucked
the horses, and allowed them to graze, trucking them again before dark.
Then the cause of the long halt became known. One of the New Zealand
trains, which preceded ours, had met with a serious accident, causing the
death of 16 men and the disablement of 13 others. Frederickstadt was left
after dark, and Klerksdorp reached at daylight next morning. The first
view of our new locality was not prepossessing—simply a sea of red mud,
with squalid houses emerging at irregular intervals. Waggons were bogged
beside the train, but in a wonderfully short time things were straightened
out, and an hour after arrival we were clear of the town, and moving on
to our new camping ground just outside the blockhouse line. Every one
was now beginning to know his duties, and campwork became less irksome
in consequence.
On the 15th, Colonel De Lisle took command of the new Australian
Brigade, now forming part of Colonel Thorneycroft's force, and held an
inspection. The function was, however, interrupted by the arrival of
orders to move out to meet a Boer force, which was being driven towards
us by Colonels Kitchener and Rawlinson. Our squadron occupied a long,
low kopje, where rows of little stone schanzes, behind which were heaps
of empty cartridge cases, showed that the ground had already been used
for other purposes than peaceful pasturage. Here we remained for some
hours, sending patrols far to the front and flanks, but seeing nothing of
the enemy, who, we afterwards heard, had sheered off towards the Vaal.
From our position, however, we had a magnificent view, and saw the
whole column march in and camp in front of our own lines. Two com-
panies of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders encamped close beside us
on the ridge; whence, as soon as relieved, we returned to camp.
On the 18th, orders arrived to move again, this time to take part in a
“drive” westwards towards the railway line, near Vryburg. It was neces-
sary, however, to establish a regimental depot for the storage of surplus
stores, care of sick men and horses, etc. As some similar establishments,
left under junior officers, had not been a success, Colonel De Lisle directed
that a senior officer should be placed in charge. Accordingly, Captain
Perceval, as senior captain of arms, and Captain Bruche, who occupied a
similar position in the 2nd, were detailed to command the depots of their
respective regiments, or battalions, as they had been previously called.
Moreover, as the number to be taken on trek by each regiment was strictly
limited to 400, Lieutenant-Colonel Lyster decided to leave our squadron
at the depot, promising, however, to relieve us immediately on his return.


i his arrangement, of course, dealt a severe blow to our hopes, but, not-
withstanding a certain amount of excusable grumbling, the squadron set
to work with a will, struck and cleaned up the regimental camp, and
formed the new detail camp and re-mount depot just inside the barb-wire
fence that surrounds the town. In addition to our own fellows, we had
with us a number of men left behind for various reasons by all the other
squadrons, and nearly 300 horses. The work of making the camp on
very rocky ground, forming the horse-kraals, of iron posts and barb-wire,
was heavy and continuous, but, after the first two days, and when men
began to settle down and know each other, everyone worked well and
cheerfully, realising the necessity of the arduous and often unpleasant
duties we were called on to perform. Reveille sounded daily at 5.30 a.m.,
roll-call at 6, then morning feed. After a while it was arranged that the
night picquet should make out and give this feed, thus leaving the others
free to get their breakfasts, etc., immediately after roll-call. After break-
fast, morning stables, watering, grazing, and cleaning lines. After dinner,
more grazing, watering, and evening stables. After a while, our Q.M.S.,
Morrisby, was appointed Q.M.S. for the two regimental camps, and Private
W. Berwick, acting transport sergeant, having charge of all the rations
and waggons, and over 60 mules. The greatest care was necessary with the
horses, as, though \ et.-Lieut. Barbeta was in camp, he was almost
destitute of the necessary drugs, etc., for doctoring them. The fever
season was not yet over, and nearly every morning, in spite of everv care,
there were at least one or two dead horses to remove.
On the 22nd Lieut. Barwise was ordered to join the columns for
duty with D squadron; his orderly, Private Morgan, accompanied him;
Private Gayson was already attached to the same officer as a signaller.
These three, therefore, were fortunate in being in what proved to be the
last drive of the war.
Early in the morning of Sunday, 27th, word went round that a party
of Boers was approaching. In a moment the whole camp was on the
alert, and after a while the party came in sight over a h»w ridge. An
officer, in pyjamas and British warm, with revolver in pocket, went out
with a few men to meet them, when they showed a white flag and
approached. The party consisted of 11 men and bo_v*, two women, one
child, 18 horses, and 18 cattle, with one waggon. I hey had only two
rifles, and said they could stay out no longer, as they had no ammunition
The leader, a fine-looking, intelligent fellow, spoke English well. Thev
were handed over to a sentry of the South Wales Borderers and taken to
the Concentration Camp.
On May 3rd Private Haigh went to Capetown to assist in the Pay
Office. He was there promoted to the rank of sergeant, and did not
rejoin the squadron until we re-embarked at Durban.
On the 9th the Australian and New Zealand officers on the station
gave a dance in the Exchange. The hall was prettily decorated, and the
Australian emblem—kangaroo and emu—executed in colours on a water-


proof sheet by the Q.M.S., 2nd Battalion, occupied a prominent position.
Borne of the Dutch ladies present took the emu for an ostrich, but the
kangaroo was beyond them.
On the 13th Lance-Corporal A. T. Mailing, who had been doing duty
in the Army Post Office, was sent on the same duty to V ryburg. The
regularity with which we received our mails was largely due to his care and
ability.
It was known that there was a Boer commando camped somewhere in
the bush country near the Vaal River, about ten miles out, so on the 19th,
by way of a little “harmless diversion,” Captain Perceval, with Lieutenant
Riggall, and their two orderlies, Blacklow and Swifte, set out for a ride
in that direction, previously sending word to the nearest blockhouse that
they were going out shooting, presumably buck. Few of the latter being
seen, and none killed, the party off-saddled, and knee-haltered their horses
close to a waterhole, boiled a billy—a difficult business, owing to the
absence of any fuel but dry reeds—and ate their lunch of bully beef and
biscuits, one of the party keeping watch. While this was in progress a
small party of Boers galloped out of the bushes and made a dash for our
horses, which were feeding close by. On seeing four rifles pointed at
them over the edge of the bank they fired, wheeled round, galloped off, and
took cover further up the spruit. Firing was pretty brisk for some time,
several of our party having close shaves, though fortunately no one was
hit. Blacklow’s horse, however, got a bullet through the haunch, which
laid it up for some weeks. The Boers eventually decamped one by one,
creeping up the spruit some distance before mounting, and galloping off
towards Rietkuil, when we returned to camp, slowly, on account of the
lame horse, and taking occasional shots at karon, etc., on the way.
On the 21st the column returned and camped close to the old site.
The same day Mr. Seddon, Premier of New Zealand, arrived by special
train, and drove out to the camp with a large escort, where he addressed
the New Zealand troops formed up in square to receive him. General Sir
lan Hamilton, as senior officer present, replied, and spoke well of the good
conduct, discipline, and usefulness of the New Zealanders.
On the 22nd we left the Depot and joined the column camp, expecting
to move out in a day or two on another drive. Two days later the column,
consisting now of Ist and 2nd A.C. Horse, New Zealanders (Ist and 2nd
Regiments), Carrington’s Bushmen, and Doyle’s Scouts, with two pom-
poms, and Field Hospital, moved some miles out and camped again at
Boschkop. Pte. Fitzallen, who had been taken ill while at the Depot,
died in hospital on the 30th, deeply regretted by all. Always ready, cheer-
ful, and eager to do his duty, he was a great loss to all of us.
After church parade on Sunday, June Ist, General Mildmay Wilson
announced that the terms of peace had been signed by the Boer
and that the war was therefore at an end. The news was received with
great cheering, although some experienced an undercurrent of regret
that they had not had more opportunity of showing what they could" do


in the way of actual fighting. Next day, while on parade with the
regiment Corporal j. J. Joyce’s horse —an awkward Russian pony fell
with him, injuring his arm somewhat severely, and necessitating his
removal to hospital, where he remained for some weeks. Orders having
been issued from Army Headquarters for a united service of thanksgiving
for peace, to be held in Pretoria on Sunday, June Bth, a representative
party of ours, consisting of 25 non-commissioned officers and men, was
selected and placed under the command of Captain Perceval. Leaving
camp at dark on the 4th, we travelled with a number of others —Seaforths,
New Zealanders, Bushmen, etc. —bent on the same errand. Reaching
Pretoria about midnight, we all with some difficulty found our camp, and
turned in without delay. The following day was devoted to drill in the
early morning, and sightseeing in the afternoon. Several of our fellows
had fought in the vicinity when out under Lieut.-Col. Cameron, and were
well acquainted with all the landmarks. Saturday was spent in rehearsing
for the following day’s ceremony, which meant a hot and dusty march to
the Artillery Barracks, some three hours standing on parade there, and
the return march to camp.
Sunday.—The same march, but this time to the Church Square, in
the centre of the town. Our camp turned out detachments from no fewer
than 46 different regiments. The parade was a splendid spectacle; the
square was closely filled by nearly 6000 troops, the windows and roofs of
the houses occupied by civilian sightseers, while on the large platform,
covered with red cloth, and decorated with plants and flowers, stood the
Commander-in-Chief and his staff, the Bishop of Zululand and clergy, and
a number of nurses. Before the commencement of the service Lord
Kitchener distributed a number of decorations to officers, men, and nurses;
Lieut. Maygar, of Victoria, received the V.C. The service, in which all
denominations joined, was most impressive, and the singing, led by the
massed bands, really splendid. Each unit marched back to camp inde-
pendently, but even so we were all pretty footsore, having had lately but
little practice in going afoot. But I think we all agreed that it was worth
it. Monday evening saw us once more in the train; we found our own
camp again, late on Tuesday, after some difficulty, as the regiment had
moved to a new site during our absence. The next few days were taken
up with the usual duties and parades, at one of which the whole of Col.
Thorneycroft’s force was photographed. Here Pte. H. E. Wright, who
had been acting as orderly to Col. Thorneycroft, and had latterly spent a
short time in hospital, rejoined, and Sergts. Adams and Sandison, with
Pte. Ross, from Col. Watchorn’s contingent, joined our squadron. It is
a pity that arrangements were not made for more of them to join us; we
heard that fifty of them were anxious to do so. On the 19th we had an
inter-squadron rifle match, five men a side, 10 shots each at 500 and 600
yards ; prizes for first and second teams, first and second individual scores.
The results wereAt 500— E squadron, 312; B, 261; D, 255 ;A, 235 ;C,
231. Lieut. Riggall, 45, first; Sergt.-Major Briant, 43, second. Darkness
coming on the longer range was not fired. We trekked next day, and


as it was found impossible to complete, the stakes put up by each squadron
were returned. Starting early next day (20th), the Ist and 2nd A.C.H.,
pom-poms, and field hospital proceeded by easy marches to Elandsfontein,
where we were to give in our horses. dhis order was a great disappoint-
ment to many of us, who hoped that, although the war was over, we
should be kept in the country for some months to police disturbed
districts and bring in recalcitrant burghers. We passed through the
pretty little town of Potchefstrom —the old capital on the 21st, camped
at Buffelsdoorn on the 22nd, at Doornkop on the 24th, and entered
Johannesburg on the 25th. Marching through the streets we saw some-
thing of the great preparations made for celebrating the coronation on the
following day; passed a number of mines just getting to work again,
including the famous Simmer and Jack, and reached our camping ground
early in the afternoon. The same evening the news of his Majesty's
serious illness reached us, and caused great alarm and regret. . We
afterwards heard, too, that on this day O.M.S. F. E. Morrisby died at
Klerksdorp. His death was mourned by the whole squadron; always
capable, obliging, and keen in the interests of the squadron, he had won
the esteem, not only of his comrades, but of all with whom he had been
brought into contact. The squadron unanimously decided to devote the
whole of the sports fund, supplemented by further subscriptions, to erect-
ing suitable headstones over his and Fitzallen’s graves.
Next day we saw the last of our horses, as they marched away to the
Remount Depot, a good many of our original Tasmanians among them.
The camp seemed strangely empty after they had gone, but the pariing
had to come, and—there were no more night horse-pickets.
Saturday, the 29th, saw us once more entrained for Newcastle, where
we arrived next day. Here Lieut.-Col. Lyster took command of the
Australian Brigade, Major Lee being appointed to the command of our
Battalion, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.
After a week spent in handing in arms, etc., and discharging men who
decided to remain in the country, we left by rail for Durban on the Bth
July. Of the journey on board the “Drayton Grange” enough has
probably been heard, suffice it to say that, having transhipped to the
“Pateena” at Melbourne, we reached Launceston on the 9th August, every
man having been paid up in full and handed his discharge before landing.
Launceston, ever hospitable, and well to the fore in anything connected
with soldiering, gave us a hearty reception at the wharf, and a dinner at
the Metropole, after which everyone was at liberty to depart to his home..
If we did not win as many laurels as our predecessors it was because, not.
the will, but the opportunity was wanting.

TIONS WALLACE TO GO MAJOR MORRISBY’S
NARRATIVE—LIST OF OFFICERS AND MEN—DEPAR-
TURE POSTPONED APPRECIATION BY THE
IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT—TROOPER M'LOUGHLIN’S
EXPERIENCE.
HE following leading article appeared in the “ Daily Telegraph”
Launceston, during the period of the Commonwealth Horse
movement. The “ psychological atmosphere” is ganged in it,
and hence it is suitable as an introduction here.
“There are several signs of the times which indicate that the war in
South Africa may at last be regarded as having entered upon its final
stages. Lord Kitchener does not embellish his despatches with prognos-
tications concerning the future. Still it is impossible to read his frequent
reports of the work done during given periods without recognising the
fact that the process of exhausting the enemy is going on week in and
week out without cessation. There must be a limit to the endurance of
the Boers against the pressure of superior force, even with such advantages
as they possess in the form of knowledge of the country and sympathetic
assistance from portions of its population. One sure and certain sign of
the improved state of things is the almost complete immunity of the
railway lines from attack or outrage, and this may further be regarded
as substantial proof of the effective nature of the military operations. It
implies not only that the country through which the main arteries of com-
munication run has been cleared of the enemy, but that the precautions
taken to keep him out of it are sufficient to ensure the safety of the traffic.
While so much has been accomplished over a vast area of territory, the
forces not wanted for protective purposes are scouring the country and
chasing the few remaining belligerent Boers from pillar to post, and surel) r
if slowly reducing their numbers and crippling their means of further
resistance. The fortunes of war will doubtless continue to bring an


occasional reverse to our troops, but that is only what might be expected
under the most favourable set of circumstances. Writing from Capetown
about the middle of December a correspondent stated that the work of
attrition goes steadily on, and that there is an abundance of testimony
that the wearing down process, applied continuously and energetically, is
having an intensely demoralising effect upon the enemy’s commanders and
commandoes alike. The feeling there is tersely described in the sentence.
Tf we are to believe the evidence of our senses, active hostilities are
hastening rapidly to a close.’ The news that Lord Kitchener is concen-
trating remounts for what is supposed to be a great effort to bring the war
to an end will revive interest in the military movements until the result
is known.”
The following notes of Major Morrisby’s career, together with the
vivid narrative, have been compiled from data generously placed at m)/
disposal by that officer: —
Major Arthur Morrisby was born 29th December, 1847, a t Sandford,
in Tasmania, and is a son of the late John Morrisby. He was educated at
the Rokeby and Mornington Schools, kept by the late I. O. O. M'Ardell,.
and engaged in agricultural pursuits at Rokeby, and also for some years
in shipping produce to the Sydney market from the northern part of ias-
mania, until 1891, when he moved to the West Coast mining fields, and
engaged in mercantile pursuits. He was elected a member of the
Municipal Council of Clarence in 1890, and a Justice of the Peace for the
district. For the previous seven or eight years he had been a corporal in
the Southern Tasmanian Artillery, and was known as a successful rifle
shot. In 1892 he was elected at the head of the poll as a member of the
first Town Board of Zeehan, and also first chairman, and was made a Justice
of the Peace for the district of Macquarie, and was at that time, and is
now, senior Justice for that district. He held the position of chairman of
the Town Board (excepting an interval of a few years) up till February,
1901, resigning from the board when leaving for Africa in 1902. He
also held the positions of chairman Cemetery Trust for Zeehan, chairman
of Zeehan Board of Advice, member of Strahan Marine Board, member
of the Zeehan Licensing Bench, and other positions, resigning them at the
same time. In 1896 he organised and raised a company under the auxiliary
forces at Zeehan, and was appointed captain in September of that vear. This
company furnished many men in every contingent that went to Africa.
He volunteered for service in Africa with the First Contingent. When the
Commonwealth decided to send a second contingent in 1902, he applied
for and obtained the command of the Tasmanian quota, a full company of
(including officers) 121 men. This was styled E Company, 3rd Battalion,.
Australian Commonwealth Horse. Went into camp at New Town on 29th
January, 1902, and proceeded to enroll men, and expected to embark in the
“Englishman” in March, but through an outbreak of scarletina and measles
the embarkation was delayed, and it was only through the ship being de-
layed at Hobart in taking in cargo that, at the last moment, the company
was allowed to go.

CAPTAIN A. MORRISBY,
COMMANDING K SQUADRON, THIRD BATTALION, A.C.H.


The following clippings from the “Daily Telegraph” will indicate
the progress of the movement for a second Federal Contingent. The
dates cover the period from February 15 to March 25 :
THE FEDERAL CONTINGENTS.—THE SECOND TASMANIAN
QUOTA.
Hobart, Monday.—The arrangements for the despatch of the Second
Commonwealth Contingent are being pushed on rapidly. Ip to the
present no fewer than 122 men have passed all tests, so that a few will
have to be weeded out, as only 116 rank and file are required. The number
sworn in is 94. The horses are coming in very well, 84 suitable animals
having been purchased, while others are coming in freely, and there will be
no difficulty in making up the required number.
CAPTAIN MORRISBY ENTERTAINED.
Queenstown, Wednesday.—Captain Arthur Morrisby was entertained
last night at Hunter's Hotel by a number of his Queenstown friends. The
chair was taken by Mr. R. C. Sticht (general manager of the Mount Lyell
Companv), and the proceedings were most enthusiastic.
THE COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.
It is understood that among the commissioned officers associated with
Captain A. Morrisby in the second section of the Federal Contingent will
be Lieutenants Shaw, Sturton, and Swan.

Through the length of time in camp the men were kept very busy at
drill, and instruction in trench-making,'Sangar-building, and other details,
and in consequence were very smart, and said to be the best drilled men
who had left Tasmania. The officers, besides the captain and 0.C., were
Lieuts. R. A. Swan, C. R. A. Chalmers, H. A. Shaw, R. N. A. Stourton.
Embarkation of 121 horses took place on the morning of the Bth April, and
the ship “ Englishman,” in command of Captain Roberts, sailed for
Freemantle, W.A., at 2 p.m. same day. There were on board, besides the
Tasmanians, a company of 120 men and officers and 121 horses, same
battalion, from Queensland, under Capt. Echlin. Reached Freemantle
on the 17th same month, and embarked a half company —63 officers and
men and same number of horses—of No. 2 Battalion, from West Australia,
and after taking in 1,000 tons of coal left again on the morning of the 20th
for Durban, Natal. The voyage was a good one, and nothing of moment
occurred beyond the fact that seven of the Tasmanian horses died on
the way. Various amusements were organised for the men, consisting of
tugs of war, sports, concerts, etc. The officers wrote papers on military
subjects, debated them, and afterwards read them to the men. Reached
Durban Bay on 9th May, and went alongside the wharf on the evening
of next day. Disembarked horses and men and luggage next day and
moved out to the camp in Lord’s Show Ground, about ijA miles outside
Durban. Remained there four days, and left in train for Newcastle at 4
p.m. on 16th May. The train contained all the horses, m (ten short) men,
and luggage of E Company Tasmanians, under the command of Capt.
Morrisby. Reached Pietermaritzburg at midnight, where arms and
ammunition were served out, and all military directions given and a proper
look-out arranged for. Arrived at the Mooi River Station at 7 a.m.,
detrained the horses and fed and watered them. Men breakfasted, and at
8.50 a.m. the horses were again entrained and a start made. Saw evidences
of fighting at Willow Grange, Enslin, Estcourt, Annandale, Chietz (where
Lord Roberts’s son is buried), also Colenso, and saw the battlefield and spot


where Lieut. Roberts was killed. Arrived at Ladysmith about 2 p.m. on
iyth, and stopped an hour to water horses. Had a good look round to see
objects of interest. Passed through Elandslaagte and Glencoe Junction,
where the first fights took place, and arrived at Newcastle 9.30 p.m. same
day. Stayed in train all night, and early in the morning disentrained the
horses, which were watered and fed. After the men had breakfasted tents
were requisitioned and loaded on the waggons, as well as luggage, and
sent to the camp at Kitchener’s Kop, about two miles out of the town, with
a fatigue party to pitch tents. The horses were sent out under charge of
Lieut. Shaw, and as they passed out of the town were met by Gen. Lyttlc-
ton, who was much pleased with them. Later on all the men marched out,
and their arrival was reported to Col. Wallace, C.O. of the Battalion!
New castle is a town in the northern part of Natal, about 30 miles south of
Laing’s Nek, and was occupied by the Boers early in the war. Kitchener’s
Kop, about two miles from the town, is a small rocky eminence, with a
fort and stone walls on its summit, to assist in protecting the town. All
round are numerous forts and blockhouses, following the different roads,
all for the same purpose, for at this time Newcastle was a large depot, and
large convoys of waggons left there nearly every day for different points.
North of Kitchener s Kop was Signal Hill, on which was mounted a fine
4.7 m. gun, which commanded the railway to Laing’s Nek, and could
actually fire a shell into the Orange State on the west, and the Transvaal
on the east, across the Buffalo River. From Signal Hill a fine view was
obtained of Majuba Hill, and later on a number of officers (including the
writer) obtained permission to visit this historic spot. Leaving Newcastle
by train at 7 a.m., and arriving at Charlestown (after passing through the
tunnel at Laing’s Nek), which is situated immediately on the border of
Natal and the Transvaal, a walk of about eight miles back reached the
summit of Majuba, where the tomb erected to the officers and men who,
with Sir G. Colley, fell there in 1881, were of great interest, and anyone
who had read the accounts written of that fight could follow it easily. Sir
G. Colley was buried near Mount Prospect Railway Station, where we took
the train on return. The horses having developed bad colds, the battalion
were kept in camp at Newcastle for some weeks nursing them up and in
getting replaced from the depots those that died. At the end of May the
horses were getting in good trim, and the battalion were expecting every
day to be ordered to the front, when news arrived that peace was signed,
and although all acknowledged that this was a good thing, still there was
general disappointment at not having a chance for a brush with the enemy.
During the stay in camp strict discipline was kept up, constant drill, and
rifle shooting in as near to actual conditions as possible. Great prepara-
tions were made at Newcastle for the Coronation festivities. A oreat
review was held in the Market Square on Thanksgiving Day for Peace and
two rehearsals for the march past on the 26th June. In the rehearsal
everything was gone through, including dismounting and forming up in the
Market Square for divine service, and then mounting again and going out
to the parade ground, about a mile in another direction. At this review


upwards of 9000 mounted (nearly all colonials) and 3000 infantry took part,
and it was a splendid sight indeed. The men were all in actual fighting
trim, and not for show purposes. In the vicinity of Newcastle were camped
colonials from all the States of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Natal,
and to celebrate the occasion the officers of the Australian and Natal con-
tingents met and arranged for a meeting of representatives of the other
contingents. This meeting decided to mark the event of so many colonials
being in the town by having a banquet on the evening of the King’s
Coronation Day, June 26, and at which it was anticipated 350 officers would
be present. Col. Addison, of the Natal Carrabineers, and Capt. Morrisby,
of Commonwealth Horse (E Company), were appointed as a sub-committee
to carry this out, but as no room suitable could be obtained in Newcastle
(the Town Hall being engaged), and no one would undertake the catering,
it had to be abandoned, and as the Coronation was postponed it was,
perhaps, just as well. Next day, 27th, Capt. Morrisby went on a week’s
leave to Johannesburg and Pretoria, and while there heard of the death of
his nephew at Klerksdorp. After returning from Pretoria he went on to
Klerksdorp and saw the grave and obtained particulars, etc., returning to
Johannesburg next day. On getting on board the train at Elandsfontein
next morning found himself a fellow-passenger with Gen. Botha and Louis
De Wet, and travelled with them to Newcastle. In the meantime all the
horses and arms had been turned in, and the men were under orders for
home. An incident occurred at this time of a rather exciting nature. A
large horse depot existed about three-quarters of a mile from the camp,
and during the night the enclosure gave way, and a stampede took place of
about 4000 horses. The men were called to light grass, straw, or anything
they could get to frighten the horses and keep them away from the horses
in our lines, but they passed through a portion of the camp, carrying away
with them about 150 of our horses. Some of these were recovered about
40 miles distant, and the track of the stampede could be traced by finding
horses with broken legs, necks, etc. All the Australians being mobilised at
Newcastle, preparations were made for embarkation, and the various units
were marched off, the 3rd Battalion being the last to leave camp, on the
morning of the 10th July. The battalion left camp under command of
Capt. Morrisby, and marched to Newcastle, and in ten minutes were en-
trained, and guards placed in each truck (the men travelled in open trucks)
to maintain order, and especially to prevent throwing pebbles at the native
pointsmen, a favourite form of amusement on the part of Australians, but
fraught with considerable danger, as the pointsmen were afraid to remain
at their work. The guards were successful, as no single instance occurred
on the way down to Durban. The whole battalion were in one large train
with two engines, but on reaching Ladysmith it was divided into two,
Major Clarke taking command of one and Capt. Morrisby the other. At
Maritzburg a half company of Scottish Horse came into the latter train,
and eventually arrived at the Junction. The train was delayed here some
two hours, during which time the men ate and drank everything they could
get at the railway refreshment room, paying for what they got and not


misbehaving in any way. In consequence of several disturbances caused
through returning colonials at Durban, the Australians obtained a very bad
name, and orders were given that our men were to be taken another route
to the Bluff, so as not to pass through the town. The train arrived along-
side the ship “ Drayton Grange” about 12 a.m. on the nth, and after being
medically inspected were embarked, the ship moving out into the bay ai
3 P- m -> with 2000 men on board. Several of the men of E Company
(Tasmania), including Lieut. Swan, decided to remain in Africa, where they
are doing well. The intention was for the ship to remain at anchor 24
hours before sailing, but as a heavy southerly wind came up about 7 in the
evening, anchor was raised, and she left for Australia. Through the night
and next morning a heavy gale was blowing, with a high sea. Capt.
Morrisby was appointed field officer for the day, and a disagreeable duty
it was. Over two-thirds of the men were sick, and it was difficult to get
sufficient men well enough to make up the different guards, while the
scene at night when going about the ship relieving sentries was sickening.
The heavy winds and seas, fortunately principally from behind, continued
most of the way, and somewhat intensified the inconvenience caused
through the outbreak of measles which occurred on board. The medical
officers on board were at their wits’ end to provide accommodation for the
sick, for the hospital On board only contained 45 cots. The officers gave
up their smoking room, orderly room, and promenade deck, and by the
time Albany was reached upwards of a hundred men were in hospital, while
quite the same number reported themselves as being unwell. No men were
allowed ashore at Albany, while Col. Lyster cabled for instructions. The
local health authorities were not agreeable for the sick men to be landed,
and eventually two companies—A and B of 3rd Battalian—were landed at
the quarantine station, so as to provide more room for the sick. That it
was a fatal mistake to take the sick men later events proved. Albany was
left on Sunday morning, with the weather cold and rough. On Monday
morning the first man died, followed by another later in the day—Pte.
Gundy, of E Company (Tasmania). Every day saw a funeral, sometimes
a double one. The last man—Pte. Hodgman, E Company (Tasmania) —
dying on Wednesday evening, and as the ship was within 24 hours’ steam
of Melbourne his C.O. arranged for the body to be kept on board. Queens-
cliff was reached at 4 p.m. on Thursday, and on Friday morning the sick
were landed at Portsea Hospital (over 90 men), with the exception of a few
who were too ill to move, and were taken on to Melbourne. The ship was
anchored off Williamstown and arrangements made with an undertaker,
who came on board and took the body of Hodgman on shore and even-
tually sent it to his friends in Tasmania for burial. At noon on Friday
the men of E Company transhipped from the “ Drayton Grange” to the
“Pateena” for Launceston, arriving there on the afternoon of the 9th
August. Most of the men were paid off in Launceston, and received their
discharge, the remainder being discharged in Hobart. Capt. Morrisby
was placed on the retired list with the rank of Major.


In April, 1899, Mr. Morrisby was elected as the representative of the
District of Gordon (West Coast) in the Legislative Council, and on his
departure for Africa his constituents did not wish him to resign, so he
left his resignation in the hands of the member for Pembroke, to be used
if necessary, but returned in time to take his seat in Parliament in Septem-
ber. On the Ist August of this year (1903) Mr. Morrisby was sworn in as
a member of the Executive Council, and as representative of the Propsting
Ministry in the Legislative Council.
LETTER FROM TROOPER W. J. M‘LOUGHLIN.
River Plenty, September Bth, 1902.
Dear Sir,—ln answer to your circular letter, which I received on the
14th of last month, I have the greatest pleasure in giving you all the
information I can, as far as I know, during my service in the South Airiccm
war in 1902. Well, sir, we left Hobart on the Bth April, 1902, and we had
a most lovely time of it, as amusing as could be obtained, on the troopship
“Englishman.” And we arrived at Durban port, South Africa, on the 9th
May, 1902, and disembarked off the “Englishman on the 10th May. And
then we took our horses to Durban Show Ground for three days. During
the three days we were there we drilled two days out of the three
on foot. On the fourth day we left Durban for Newcastle by the half-
past four train that afternoon, and took two days and a night, which was
very uncomfortable, as we were packed like apples in cases. After about
seven and a half hours’ travelling by train we reached Pietermaritzburg at
12 midnight. We stayed there one and a half hours, in which we were
armed with rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition, to be divided among 119
of us. We also had orders then given us there that if we were attacked by
the enemy half of us were to get out of right and left of the train, and we
were not allowed to fire without orders. But we passed through all right
to Newcastle on the 14th May, and went into camp at Kitchener’s Kop,
where we stayed for 18 weeks in a most trying way to us all. After we had
been in camp at Kitchener’s Kop for three weeks we went out on patrol
in search of Boers, which we failed to find that day. The following day we
were ordered to Buffalo River, as there were supposed to be 500 Boers
entrenched there. We left at 4 o’clock that morning for there, but we
failed in finding them. Well, sir, I suppose you know that you cannot
get much information from me, as we only got there six weeks before peace
was declared. We were in South Africa about three months, and that
being my first time we were not under fire. But as far as I know I shall
let you know our first thing to do was to make a sanger, which is made like
a stone wall, with loopholes left in it to shoot out of. It saves exposing
yourself under the fire of the enemy, and then when we are compelled to
leave that place by the Boers we make manholes, which we lie in, and still
keep on making them until we gain their position. And then we go on
march to whatever place we are ordered, all day and night if required,
perhaps reach a town or kopje at 9 or 10 p.m. after a hard day’s travelling.


without breakfast, dinner, or tea. When we arrive to where we stop for
the night perhaps you are ordered on Costic post (Cossack ?), about two
miles out from the column, or else on guard or picket, which is no pleasure,
I can say. Then you can eat your biscuit and a bit of bully beef, which is
not very good, with a drop of cold water, and not good at that. You are
called in of a morning perhaps without any breakfast or not any time to get
it: you have to eat it as you go along.
Well, sir, I cannot tell you anything about warfare, but only what 1
have gone through myself during my short time. But I must say the work
which has been done by Gen. Sir Redvers Buller when he was trying to
relieve Ladysmith was marvellous; the graves are as thick as they can
be. It's no doubt his work was wonderful when he relieved Ladysmith,
which is a perfect ruin.
We disembarked from the train at the Bluff, and then embarked at
once on the “Drayton Grange” for Australia. More to our sorrow it was!
It was no doubt we were crushed in like sardines that there was no room
to move at all. If it had not been for our Captain Morrisby I don’t know
Low we should have got on.

HE Australian Commonwealth Horse, consisting of three con-
tingents—to use the familiar term —were practically all one in the
sense of being the response to the desire for a certain number of
men. Some 2,000 were to be sent from Australia, and these
separate units were all sent within about three months. Before one
squadron was despatched another was under training, so that what has
been said previously by way of introduction, and concerning the situation,
applies to the present chapter. Most of the material for this chapter
necessarily consists of press cuttings recording the progress of prepara-
tions and departure of the men. There are two or three items which refer
to Major Morrisby’s squadron, but which appeared under a later date,
and I have arranged them here in the order of time. This history would
not be complete without some reference to the “Manhattan” command, of
which Colonel Wallack was relieved. This incident elicited universal
sympathy for Colonel Wallack, but it is not a matter in which the opinions
of a civilian would be in place. This much seems clear—that there were
some very rowdy elements among the men under his command. And
possibly the new Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Forces was anxious
to magnify his office. In any case, the incident was a regrettable one.
Captain Kenneth Ogilvy was selected to command C Squadron of.
the Australian Commonwealth Horse. The captain is the son of Mr.
A. J. Ogilvy, of Richmond, and is descended from the Ogilvys of Inverqu—

harity, Scotland. Mr. Ogilvy, senior, came to Tasmania in the early
sixties, and settled down at Inverquharity, Richmond, where the future
captain was born about 30 years ago. Young Kenneth was educated
mostly at private schools, but spent some time at the Hutchins School,
Hobart. The captain has been for some years the occupier of his father s
estate, and has followed agricultural and pastoral pursuits. Early in life
he joined the Tasmanian Volunteer Force, holding the rank of lieutenant
for some years, and was known as an enthusiastic soldier and officer. In
1901 he was promoted to the rank of captain. Upon the formation of the
last contingent, viz., C Squadron of the Bth Battalion, Australian Common-
wealth Horse, he was given the command.
Peace was declared within a fortnight after the departure of Ogilvy’s
men, and consequently there was no opportunity of doing stirring deeds for
King and Empire. They embarked in the troopship “St. Andrew on
May 21, 1902. I may be permitted to quote a few sentences from Captain
Ogilvy’s letter: —
“ We were disembarked at Durban, and were started off for the front.
Orders for our recall reached us at Newcastle, Natal, within sight of
Majuba and the Transvaal border, and three months from our departure
saw us home again, without the satisfaction of having done anything for
King or country. I hope you are putting in a good word for our men, as
well as for their Os.C. Both at their work and in their idle time my
experience was that the Tasmanians were as good as the men from any
of the other states, and far better than some. Their work was conscien-
tiously and creditably done, and they were more gentlemanly, and were
never so blackguardly as the representatives of some of the other states.*
“The men who comprised C Squadron, Bth A.C.H., were, I believe, as
good a lot of men as ever were sent from Tasmania, and I am very proud
to have been privileged to command them, even for so short a time.”
Captain Ogilvy’s references to the conduct of some of the Australians
are, unfortunately, only too true. It cannot be doubted or denied that a
good sprinkling of the “riff-raff” was among the Australians, and while
they were very popular as soldiers, the report of British experts shows that
they were not remarkable for discipline. Lord Roberts said in his
evidence before the Royal Commission: —“ If they could be trained better
they could be still more valuable, for they are most excellent material.
Their officers also need to be better trained.” And again—“lt was pointed
out to me generally that the colonials did not look after their horses. Our
own men were not over careful, but the colonials were less so.” See
appendix for further reference to this subject. Tire last contingent left
on May 21, 1902.
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WALLACE RELIEVED OF THE
COMMAND.
Sydney, Thursday,—A sensational development occurred prior to the
departure of the transport “Manhattan” with the 3rd Battalion of the Federal


Contingent on board. It transpires that Major-General Hutton, who
inspected the troops on board on the previous day, deemed it advisable to
relieve Lieutenant-Colonel Wallack, C.8., the officer commanding the
battalion, of his command. Grave irregularities in discipline are alleged to
have taken place. As near as could be ascertained at the hour of sailing,
there were 25 men of the battalion missing. Steps were taken immediately
to get hold, if possible, of these absentees.
THE “MANHATTAN” COMMAND.
STATEMENT BY MAJOR-GENERAL HUTTON.
Melbourne, Monday.—Major-General Hutton says nobody regrets
more than he the action he felt it necessary to take on the troopship
“Manhattan” at Sydney. The appearance and behaviour of the men
showed him something was wrong. This lamentable condition would
never have come about under a man of the necessary force of character.
A strong man was needed, and it was imperative one should be found
to take command.
SYMPATHY WITH LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WALLACK.
Adelaide, Tuesday.—The troopship “Manhattan,” with the Sydney
Battalion, resumed her voyage to South Africa on Monday afternoon. The
number of men who deserted at Sydney has been definitely ascertained to
be 11, and their names have been forwarded to Major-General Hutton.
It is apparent there is a considerable feeling of sympathy on board for
Lieutenant-Colonel Wallack, who was relieved of the command, and it is
stated the desertions were in no sense due to any action on his part, as he
had taken all proper precautions to guard against the men leaving the
ship. Moreover, the discipline among the men during the voyage round
from Sydney was excellent.
A letter written by a correspondent on board the “Manhattan” contains
the following passage: —“The dismissal of Lieutenant-Colonel Wallack,
C.8., came as a bolt from the blue. He had already endeared himself to
the officers, and won the respect of the men. We felt his loss very much,
and none of us said good-bye without emotion. The colonel himself bore
up like an officer and a gentleman.”
RETURN OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WALLACK.
Lieutenant-Colonel Wallack returned to Launceston by the “Pateena”
yesterday to take up his former duties in the Tasmanian Defence Forces.
He was met on arrival by Sergeant-Major Mason and Captain Heritage,
and left by the afternoon train for Hobart.
In view of the great amount of local interest aroused by the recent
incident on board the “Manhattan” at Sydney, when Lieutenant-Colonel
Wallack was deprived of the command of the departing contingent, the
EIGHTH BATTALION , A.C.H.


officer was approached so that it might be ascertained if he had anything to
say regarding the matter. He intimated that he occupied a very delicate
position, and his tongue was tied at the present juncture. He evidently
had a full explanation to make, but was forced to remain silent while his
case was sub judice.
Hobart, Saturday.—A list of the men who form the “O’
(Tasmanian) squadron of the Australian Commonwealth Horse is given
below. The names of the officers are not yet available, but it is under-
stood they will be published in a day or two.
It will be seen that (including five officers) the list is two short of
the 12i which is to form the squadron. These two are absentees in
hospital, who may not be able to go; consequently their names are not
inserted. One is suffering from the kick of a horse, the other from
pneumonia. There are other men in readiness to take their places if n
is decided to leave them behind.
Four commissioned officers only will accompany the squadron, as
it has been decided to leave one of the subalternships open to be filled
up by some deserving Tasmanian contingenter already in South Africa.
Thus the squadron will leave here 120 strong, among them being, of
course, the captain and three subalterns.
The following is a list of the names; —

tingent and their equipment, in order to see that instructions have been
carried out.
The following are the commanding officers of “C” squadron;

and Stephens. A fourth subaltern will be appointed from among the
Tasmanian non-commissioned officers already in South Africa. Lieut.-
Colonel Le Mercier will command the eighth battalion; Major J. F. W.
Osborne will be second in command; Major H. G. Brown will be pay-
master of the sixth and eighth battalions, and will be stationed at the

THE TASMANIAN “C” SQUADRON.
ADDRESS BY THE GOVERNOR.
Hobart, Friday.—The Governor (Sir Arthur Havelock) inspected
the “C” Squadron of the Bth Battalion Commonwealth Contingent Horse
at New Town this afternoon. There was a large attendance of ladies and
gentlemen relatives of the men. The Premier and Chief Secretary were
present. His Excellency, after a minute inspection, delivered a ver\
eloquent and extremely sympathetic speech. He said the squadron con-
sisted of men who would do credit to any country. It was possible the
hostilities would cease before they reached South Africa, but there would
still be a lot of work to do, and he was confident they would do it well.
Whilst he admired their courage and patriotism in going to fight the battles
of the Empire, he felt a tinge of regret that so many of our best and
staunchest young men were leaving us. He hoped that at any rate most
-of them would return to Tasmania rather than remain in South Africa.
He most earnestly wished them good luck and God-speed. He then
requested Captain Ogilvy, who is in command, and his officers to be
brought to him, that he might shake hands with them before they left.
This was then done, and he shook hands with them warmly, and addressed


kindly words to them. The commander subsequently addressed the men.
He said he was proud of the manner in which they had shaped. Their
good conduct and attention to discipline in camp had been exemplary. He
predicted that they would acquit themselves splendidly in South Africa.
THE TASMANIAN “C” SQUADRON.
EMBARK THIS MORNING.
Hobart, Tuesday.—At 8 o’clock to-morrow the “C” Squadron of
the Australian Commonwealth Contingent will take their departure from
camp at New Town for the purpose of embarking on board the troopship
“St. Andrew,” number 73, which, without exception, is one of the largest
and most complete of all the vessels of her class that have yet arrived here.
As she lay alongside Prince’s Wharf, four-master as she was, she drew
20ft. aft and 17ft. for’ard, after which she took aboard several hundreds
of tons of cargo, consisting of hay, chaff, and oats, and upwards of one
hundred tons of locally manufactured jam for the comfort of the troops
serving in South Africa. In the event of present arrangements being
carried out the horses will be placed on board about 9 o’clock, after which
the departing troops will be afforded a brief opportunity of saying good-
bye to their friends and relations. It may be mentioned that supplies
have been furnished in a most satisfactory manner by the following firms:
Saddlery, Genders, Launceston; uniforms, Bidencope and Son; great
coats, Templeman and O’Brien; boots, Blundstone, Liverpool-street;
haversacks, Jack Shea; pots, mess tins, and equipments, Marsh and Co.,
C. Davis, and T. J. Cane; blankets, Johnston Bros.; socks, etc., Eric
Lewis; other clothing, Fitzgerald, Brownell, and W. H. Mulcahy. All
contracts were placed in the hands of local firms, and nearly every article
made in the State, the only importations being the badges on the hats,
•shoulder straps, and water bottles. Dr. P. C. Boyd, well-known in PTobart,
will accompany the troopship as far as Adelaide, where the medical officer
allotted to the troops will proceed on board, and Dr. Boyd will return to
Tdobart.

Prisoner’s Experiences.
FROM PRIVATE C. BROTHERS, FIRST TASMANIAN
CONTINGENT.
N MONDAY, February sth, 1900, forty of the First Tassies, those
most used to horses and the best riders, under Major Cameron,
with Lieutenant Heritage, marched out from Rensburg, about
seven miles to Jasfontein, an outpost held by a few Remington
Guides. The next day our horses were sent out to us.
The next morning, Wednesday, the 7th, long before daylight, the
first mounted patrol of Tasmanians started to patrol the country around
Jasfontein. I happened to be one of the patrol, and I don't think that
any who were there will ever forget it, for the good laugh we all had at
Lieutenant Heritage’s expense (who was in charge of the patrol) I think
was enough to make us remember; he had never been used to riding, and
anyone who has can well imagine the figure he would cut. If he has
forgotten it now, I well know he did not, for a few days at least. Anyway,


we scoured the country for some miles around without seeing any signs
of the enemy, who were reported to be somewhere in the neighbourhood.
But the next day our patrol was destined to see something of them,
for when about eight or nine miles from camp, when nearing a farm-
house, the Tasmanians were fired at for the first time by the enemy, with
the result that the guide was wounded and taken prisoner; the remainder
of the patrol got back to camp all right, and reported to Major Cameron,
who sent word at once to Rensburg. The next morning reinforcements
arrived from Rensburg, consisting of the remainder of the Tassies and
some \ ictorians, under Captain Salmon. We then started on a recon-
naissance to try and ascertain the real strength and position of the
Boers.
After we had ridden about a mile we divided into three parties, Captain
Salmon, with the Victorians, going in one direction; Major Cameron, with
some of the Tasmanians, going in another. A few of us unlucky Tassies,
much to our disgust, were told off to go with Captain Hamilton, who had
charge of a few Remington Guides and French’s Scouts in another direc-
tion.
When the party I was with (Hamilton’s) had ridden a few miles and
were nearing an extra rough range of kopjes, with a rather narrow pass
through them, Captain Hamilton ordered Lance-Corporal Hynes, of the
Tasmanians, with two of his own men that he could trust, to gallop on in
front through the kopjes, and if all was clear the rest would follow. Hynes
chose Gilham and myself. We galloped on in front through the kopjes
all right without seeing a sign of anyone, and the remainder were follow-
ing ; eight of them were in advance of the others, when the Boers came
galloping round another kopje, firing off their horses to try and cut the
lot off, but did not cjuite succeed, although eleven of us were trapped right
enough; the remainder galloped to the right, and though under a hot
fire for a time, got away without a scratch. We still had hope of getting
away, though we could not see where or how, as about two hundred Boers
were round us.
We galloped to the nearest cover, dismounted, and crawled up the
kopje, and opened fire on the Boers, as we were all determined to make a
fight for it, and do our best to get back again. This happened before 9
o’clock in the morning. Meanwhile a hot fire was kept up on both sides,
but we had not been at it many minutes before I heard Gilham call out
that he was wounded, shot through the shoulder, and in trying to get
under better cover he received another through the heart.
The next one to fall was Button, who was the last man on the
kopje, as he had been helping to get the horses under better cover behind
some rocks. He came up to within five or six yards of me, and I don’t
think he fired a shot, when the poor fellow got one through the heart.
I saw him fall, and he never moved after. With two of our best men
down (and they were good men) it was getting pretty warm. The bullets
were flying thick, but the seven of us kept on firing, and keeping under


cover of the rocks as much as possible; the other two were holding the
horses. We emptied a few saddles, and wounded a few horses. Anyone
could not help but feel sorry for them. The Boers found it was getting a
bit too hot for their horses, and did not lose any time in getting them under
cover. They then closed in all round us on foot, making good use of the
rocks for cover, until about half-past 4 o’clock in the afternoon they had
crawled up to within a hundred yards of us, calling out for us to throw
up our hands. With two more of our number wounded and our ammuni-
tion just about done, and no hope of being relieved, we decided among
ourselves that it would be only madness on our part to hold out any
longer; that we were beat by force of numbers was quite clear, and much
against our grain we gave up. After taking over our arms and horses, they
started at once to take us to their laager, which was about a mile away
behind another range of kopjes. We told them straight that we would
not walk, so they mounted us on their horses, some of them riding ours,
which were much better animals than theirs. When we arrived at their
laager the first man we saw was Mr. Hales, the war correspondent, in a
very sorry condition, who told us that Mr. Lambie, another war corre-
spondent, was shot dead, and that in the fray he had been thrown off his
horse and was taken prisoner by the Boers. In a tent was our guide, who
was wounded the day before; he was in a very low condition, through loss
of blood, and he had lain on the veldt all night, and was only found by
the Boers some time during that day. We were all hungry, as we had
not had a mouthful since daylight. All they gave us was a few dry rusks
and some coffee without sugar or milk, but we had to make the best of
it. Meanwhile we were arguing the war question with the Boers, until
they got tired of it, so they marched us off to a shed that was half-full of
hay, and told us we were to stay there for the night. We were all tired
and sleepy, so, as we had not much rest for the past week, we thought
we might as well make the best of it, and have a good sleep.
We had just taken our boots off and lain down on the hay when our
guards roused us up, and told us we had to clear out of the shed, as they
wanted it for their wounded. They acknowledged having thirteen killed
and eight wounded, which they blamed us for, as they said we had no
right to hold out as long as we did when we found we were surrounded,
but should have given in without firing a shot, but we could not see it
while there was hope.
Anyway, we got up, and they took us back to the laager, and we
had to put in the remainder of the night on the open veldt, without a great-
coat or blanket. In the morning we were all huddled up in a heap nearly
frozen. They roused us up again at daylight, and after giving us some
more rusks and coffee, mounted us on a mule waggon, and started with
us under an escort, well mounted and armed, for De La Key’s main laager.
After a very rough ride we arrived there some time during the afternoon,
and were taken before General De La Key, who said we were to be given
something to eat, and to sleep under a waggon that night.


Next morning we were roused up again early, and put on board the
train for Bloemfontein. Arrived there about dark, and marched straight to
the gaol. We did not like the idea of it much, but when we arrived there
they gave us plenty of blankets, but nothing to eat, that night. Next
morning they gave us our first mealie pap, horrid stuff, without sugar or
milk. None of us liked the look of it much, but well I remember a
Tommy who had been a prisoner there some time saying, “It’s no use,
chums; you’ve either got to scoff this ere bloomin’ stuff or go with-
out;” which we proved to be true, so we had to make the best of it. We
were kept in Bloemfontein gaol just a week, and by the end of that time we
were getting a bit too thick, as they were bringing in more prisoners
every day. We were then put on board the train for Pretoria. We fared
pretty well all the way up, as at nearly every station there were sympathisers
who brought us plenty to eat and books to read. When we arrived at
Pretoria we were taken to the racecourse, and quartered there for another
week, but we got on much better than at Bloemfontein; got better food,
and more of it.
All of us were beginning to look pretty rough for the want of a
shave, and we did not like the idea of looking like Boers, and as I had a
few shillings left decided to purchase a razor for the use of the lot, which
I did off a Boer for seven and sixpence; and after my old comrade, Jack
Hutton, who acted as barber for the company, had gone round us all, we
felt much better. But we were getting on too well; in fact, there were
getting too many of us for them to look after on the racecourse, and they
thought we would be safer behind the barbed wire, so we were once
more entrained for our final destination while prisoners—iWaterval—
where we arrived Thursday, ist of March. After we were taken to our
quarters, which were open sheds, and had a look round, and a talk to
some who had been prisoners three or four months, we came to the con-
clusion that things were not going to be too good, which we found out
later on to be the case. For the first few weeks there our rations were
the horrible mealie pap, which was musty and full of weevils, and a pound
of bread a day per man, and that was nearly as bad as the pap, for we had
to toast it before we could eat it. We were not allowed any tea, coffee,
or sugar, but we made such a row about it that after the first week
they allowed us a little coffee and 14 ounces of sugar a week per man, also
one pound of meat once a week per man.
We had plenty of change up to this time, and things did not seem so
bad, but now it was getting monotonous in real earnest; nothing to do,
and no news of how things were going at the front. Many were down with
the fever, on an average one death per day amongst us. We began to
think it would have been better to have fought to a finish than to die
like rats in a hole. But the unexpected turned up to us (Tassies), as we
received £5 per man, paid over by the American Consul, sent from Tas-
mania, and never was money more appreciated, for we could fare a little
better, as we were allowed to buy anything in the eating line. But we had
to be careful and only get what was really necessary, as everything was
PRISONER'S EXPERIENCES


so very dear, a liver would not last long. Anyway, things were much
better, still very monotonous. Had to pass away the time just anyhow;,
would not care to go through it all again; only those who have been
deprived of their freedom have any idea what it is like. A good many get
desperate and try to make their escape, but most of them were brought
back, some of them after roughing it on the veldt for a week or two. Still
some managed to get clean away. A good many were working hard at a
tunnel from one of the sheds undergTound to get out. They intended to
work away until outside the barbed wire, and the line of sentries, and then
some very dark night break through, and make a dash for freedom. With
the earth from the tunnel they puddled it up and made mud walls for the
sheds. It was not noticed by the Boers, because every one was making,
mud walls, digging the earth from the surface. Anyway, the tunnel was
never used as a means of escape; it was only just completed at our
release.
Things went on in this monotonous way for weeks, until we noticed
a restlessness amongst the Boer sentries. At times they would get very
excited, and do a great lot of talking amongst themselves at night, when
they thought we were all asleep. But we were not, all of us anyway. Some
who could understand their language would mostly be listening, and found
out that things were not going too well with them, and that they expected.
Pretoria would soon be taken by the British. Of course this made us
more anxious, and every one was making calculations as to when we
would be released. But the Boers began to get more anxious; they evi-
dently did not want us to be released just yet, for they came with their
usual lies and told us we were to be handed over to the British as they
could not keep us, their provisions getting short. (As far as I could see
the typical Boer thinks he has done a very clever thing when he makes
a Britisher believe what is not true.) But we did not all believe this. Any-
way, they said that all who were captured first were to go first, and they
persuaded a lot of the poor Tommies to pack up ready for the train that
would take them over to the British. Although many of us tried to
persuade them that they were only to be taken to a more secure place, and
tried to get them to rebel, they would not believe us, but would go; many
of them never to return to old England, for instead of being handed over
to the British they were taken down the Delagoa Bay line to a place far
worse than Waterval, which many of us expected would be the case. The
train did not start until late in the afternoon, and one of our number, Jack
Hutton, said, They will take the rest of us to-morrow, but they won’t
take me alive, for now I know our own troops are not far away, I'm going
to clear out to-night or die in making the attempt”—and he kept his word.
Somehow or other he managed to get a pair of wire cutters that had been-
smuggled in, and as soon as it was dark he went and deliberately cut a track
through the wire entanglement. How he managed it without being detected
by the sentries no one knows, but he did it; and then he persuaded one of
the Remington Guides to go with him. They got everything ready to
start, but when they got to the hole that Jack had cut one of the Boer.-


sentries had shifted his position right opposite it; but Jack was not to be
beat so easily; he seemed desperate, just fit for anything. He just as
deliberately cut another hole, and they both crawled out without being
seen. He told me after that as soon as they were past the line of sentries
they ran for all they were worth as far as they could, then had a bit of
rest, and a talk over things; then kept on going as fast as they could for
the remainder of the night. As soon as it was daylight they stopped and
lay down for the day for fear of being seen. That day they could hear
the guns at Pretoria, so did not distress themselves; they travelled on a
bit further the next night, and at daylight the next morning were halted
by one of General French’s scouts, who took them for Boers, just outside
Pretoria. Jack said, of course, we did not mind that, for he felt sate
then.
Meanwhile the remainder of us at Waterval put in the night talking
over the war, and how and when we would be released. The next day we
■could hear the guns at Pretoria. Every one was quite excited: The Boers
did not attempt to take any more away. We found out afterwards, because
the line was cut. So we amused ourselves all day by pointing towards
Pretoria, and asking the Boers how they liked it. There was not much
sleep that night; bonfires were made of our stretchers and any other wood
we could lay our hands on all round the enclosure. All the men sang
patriotic songs until they could sing no longer, whether the Boers liked
it or not. They dared not say anything.
The next morning by daylight everyone was up on top of the sheds
looking very anxious in the direction the troops were expected to come.
The Boers were looking very glum; they knew their game was played out,
and the Tommies were continually calling out to them and asking them
how they liked it now, and saying, “It will soon be our turn now, Bug-
wiskers.” Just about sunrise we thought we could hear rifle shots; a few
minutes after three Boer scouts came riding over a ridge for all they were
worth, one of them without saddle or bridle, hanging on to the horse for
his very life. We could see where the bullets were cutting the sand up
all round them, and hear the rifle shots in real earnest. As soon as they
came in the Commandant walked out to the ridge. As soon as he got there
he opened a white flag, then there was a cheer from over three thousand
•of us. Some of the roofs of the sheds gave way with the weight of men
and fell in, but that did not trouble us much. We were very soon over the
wire entanglement, tore the big Boer flag down that had been waving over
us for months, and it was just as quickly torn into shreds. Some of the
sentries cleared out, while others said they were satisfied, so laid down
their arms, which we quickly took possession of, also their ammunition,
together with their pom-pom and Maxim. Then we went through their
tents and collected all their revolvers. By this time the troops had come
up, and we were all very eager to hear the news. They told us they got
into Pretoria the afternoon before, and that we would only be a day
behind them; and of course they wanted to know how we had been getting
on. This was some time between 9 and 10 o’clock. A couple of hours


went like as many minutes in this way, when between 12 and 1 o clock.
the train came in sight to take us into Pretoria, but was sainted with a
shell from one of General Botha’s Long Toms. He had taken up a position
a few miles further back. As soon as he started to shell the train it put
back a couple of miles or so, as to be behind a range of kopjes. We all
got orders to clear out at once and take our coats and blankets with us,,
as we would probably have to sleep out in the open, and it would be
almost impossible to get blankets in Pretoria for a time; so we started at
once, some taking blankets and others great-coats, and some too eager to
take anything. The lot of us were like so many sheep clearing across the
veldt, when the Boers opened on us with their Long Toms. Then there
was a scatter of coats and blankets. Many did not trouble how they got
on at night; all that troubled them was to get away from the Boer shells
which were dropping in amongst us pretty thick, but all the damage they
did was to tear up the ground where they struck, as none of them ex-
ploded. If they had been good shrapnel and burst properly I’m afraid I
would not be writing this now. Anyway, we reached the train all right,
and arrived in Pretoria about three in the afternoon, after being prisoners
for one hundred and ten days, the like of which I never wish to go through
again. My first thought now was to find out the Tassies, and hear what
news I could from home, as I had not heard any for about five months; it
did not take me long to find them, for they were camped just outside the
town, taking a much-needed rest. Their horses were a sorry looking lot ;
they had done some very hard work on the march to Pretoria, with very
short rations. Poor brutes, I’m a lover of a good horse, and like to see
them looking well; it grieved me to see them looking as they did, but it
could not be helped, it was war. Most of the men were looking well, and
getting well used to the game of chasing Boers. Lieutenant Heritage was
in command ; both Major Cameron and Captain Brown were behind some-
where.
After we had a good all-round talk and something to eat, we were
ordered back with the rest who had been prisoners, which we did not like,,
as we wanted to go on with our own again, but we were told there was
no help for it, as we must go through a form of court-martial; also be re-
equipped with arms and horses, and we knew that would take time. So we
had to say good-bye again for a time, hoping to get back with them as
soon as possible. The next few days we spent having a look round
Pretoria, as we had nothing else to do until things were properly fixed
up.
After we had given an account of how we were captured, we were
armed with Mauser rifles, as there were none of our own make available.
We were then sent down the line to Klip River, where they feared an
attack, and remained there for a couple of days; then started again for
Kroonstadt, the nearest remount depot. The next morning after we arrived
at Kroonstadt the First Tasmanian Imperial Bushmen landed there. It
was a bit of a surprise for us to see a lot more wearing the Tassy uniform,,
for up to that time we had heard nothing of any more men being sent from


Tassy. Amongst them was Len. Hutton, Jack’s brother, who up to that
time thought Jack dead, through some mistake in the report that first
reached Tassy; it being Button instead of Hutton that was killed.
We thought we would soon be re-equipped, and on our way to join the
old lot as we now called them, but such was not the case. We were kept
humbugging about really doing nothing, and with a lot of details, it was
not too pleasant. There’s nothing like being with your own, but we could
not get fixed up. Jack Hutton got full up of it. He said, “I’m off with
the Bushmen, along with my brother; they can fix me up;” and so they
did. The O.C. of the detail camp made a bit of a fuss over it, but it was
no use, Jack had gone during the night. The rest of us were still some
time before we got fitted up, but we did so at last, and entrained again for
Pretoria. The horses were jammed into cattle trucks just anyhow, and
we were crammed into coal trucks almost on top of one another; but it
was only just a little of active service. Anyway, we arrived at Pretoria
again all right, but were not allowed to join our own contingent, who are
only a few miles out. Still kept with the details, and sent out through
Irene with remounts for General Hutton’s column; remain with the
column for a few days, and we got plenty of work as escort and scouting
for the Royal Horse Artillery, who were in action every day. At last we
were sent across country to join our own contingent, and we were not
sorry, as we had had quite enough of being ordered about by just any-
body.
We reached the old crowd safely; they were camped at Edendale, and
were jolly glad to see us, for they were getting short of men, so many
being down with fever; besides, they had been having a rough time of it
at Edendale, with plenty of night duty out on the kopjes, besides often
being sniped at. It was there that Corporal Betts was killed a few days
before we arrived. We soon got into the old go of things, which was
much better than being with a motley crowd of details or shut up behind
barbed wire. It was over a month from the time we were released until
we rejoined our own contingent.
Just a month after we first four Tasmanians were captured, five more
were taken, making nine of us. After we were released we were wanted to
join the Pretoria Police for three months on double pay. Corporal White-
law was the only one to accept it. Lance-Corporal Hynes we left still in
hospital; the rest of us thought it our duty to go back to the rest of the
contingent as soon as possible, which we did. As we enlisted foi active
service in South Africa, we thought it would not look well for us to
accept anything else, for the people at home would say we only did it for
the extra pay and less risk of hot lead. Through being prisoners of
course we missed a lot with the contingent, including Diamond Hill and
Johannesburg, for which special medal clasps were given; and, of course,
we also missed the bullets that were flying thick at those places. Still,
we would have preferred to have been there to where we were. It was the
fortune of war, and could not be helped. We were captured and taken

HE saddest work of the soldier is the burying of comrades. By
the testimony of all, this is the duty that most unmans a man. It
is not from any thought or fear of death, but rather a sense of
loss and ill-luck. The same feelings that arise under ordinary
circumstances in the loss of a friend are here reinforced by a sense of the
“hard luck” to him and to them. My task here is much easier, because
I am separated from the “young heroes” by time and circumstance, and,
reversing Mark Antony’s plea, “I have come to praise Caesar, not to bury
him.” My duty is to write their eulogium, to recall their services and
heroism, and to lay a wreath of kindly words upon their stainless memory.
Even the heathen of old said, “De mortuis nihil nisi bonum”—“Say nothing
but good of the dead.”


Despite every effort, I have failed to get any information from the
friends of several of the brave boys who died in their country s cause, and
there are no public facts available. It is, therefore, with extreme regret
that so little can be said of several of them in this chapter. 1 have men-
tioned them in the order of time and their contingents, as far as possible.

lost their lives. I append the list.

THE EAST ROEE CAEE


It will be seen that the First Contingent, under Major Cameron, lost
more heavily in the number of deaths than any other, except the First
Imperial Contingent, under Major Lewis. In the number killed in action
they double any other, although Sale and Brown died from wounds; and,
for all practical purposes, were “killed in action.” Unhappily I have been
able to obtain information, up to the present, of only four out of the six.
Taking the order of dates we have:—
BUTTON, ALFRED, next of kin, as supplied by the Defence Depart-
ment, William E. Button, Fingal, Tasmania. He was killed in action,
February 9th, 1900, near Jasfontein, in the vicinity of Rensburg, in what
was practically the first fight of the Tasmanians. In the same engagement,
and apparently under the same circumstances,
GILHAM, ATHERBY, was killed (Feb. 9, 1900). From Private J.
Roberts’s admirable diary lam able to give this note. “February 9. Very
warm. Up at 2 a.m. Fed and watered horses. Left camp with horse
patrol under Captain Hamilton at 6. Located the Boers in kopjes about
four miles from camp. I rode back for Captain Cameron. Came back with
him with all the Tasmanians, and a few Victorians and W.A.’s. Divided
into two parties, I was with Captain Cameron’s half. We skirmished over
veldt and kopjes. Came across strong party leaving farm house. Fired
at them, and had very heavy fire returned. We dismounted and climbed
kopjes and returned their fire. Stayed there for two hours firing, then had
to make a dash to get away, as they were in big numbers and flanked us.
We galloped across open country in a storm of bullets to another kopje,
and fired volleys into them. We then had to retire on to our camp, as they
were too strong for us. Our loss were Mr. Lambie, war correspondent,
shot dead, Pearce shot through the neck, Gilham and Button, two guides,
missing; Hynes, Hutton, Swan and Brothers taken prisoners. Some of
our horses were wounded. The Boer losses as far as we know, were 11
killed, some wounded, and two taken prisoners. The Rensburg detach-
ment left in the evening, the rest of us kept watch round camp all night.”
C. Brothers who was taken prisoner on this occasion, supplies this fur-
ther information: —“We were in advance of the others, when the Boers
came galloping round another kopje firing off their horses to try and cut
off the lot, but did not quite succeed, although 11 of us were trapped right
enough. The remainder galloped to the right, and though under a hot
fire for a time, got away without a scratch. We still had hope of getting
away, though we could not see where, or how, as about 200 Boers were
around us. We galloped to the nearest cover, dismounted, and crawled up
the kopje and opened fire on the Boers, as we were determined to make a
fight for it, and do our best to get back again. This happened before 9
o’clock, meantime a hot fire was kept up on both sides, but we had not been
at it many minutes before I heard Gilham call out that he was shot through
the shoulder, and in trying to get under better cover, he received another
through the heart. The next one to fall was Button, who was the last
man on the kopje, as he had been helping to get the horses under better

cover behind the rocks. He came up to within five or six yards of me
and I don't think he had fired a shot when the poor fellow got one through
the heart. I saw him fall, and he never moved With two of our best
men down (and they were good men) it was getting pretty warm. m
bullets were flying thick, but the seven of us kept on firing, and keeping
under cover of the rocks as much as possible. ihe other two were hold-
ing the horses.”
BARKER, THOMAS WILLIAM, son of Jacob Barker, Penguin,
died of enteric fever, on June 15, 1900, at Deelfontein, Cape Colony. Prom
a letter from his father, dated November nth, 1902, it appears that Pri-
vate Barker was born at the Lorth, Tasmania, and was within a fortnight
of 26 vears of age. He was a son of the soil, and had always been cngagen
in farm work, and like many others, had taken a turn at road work. He
was always a good son to his parents. It is pleasing to record that he was
a decided Christian. About three years before he left he was converted,
and tried to do what good he could. He was a member of the Christian
Endeavour Society, and he was also a good soldier, as Major Wallace
Brown can testify.” The following appeared in the “‘Advocate.’ ; ‘Ho-
bart. Wednesday.—The Governor received a cable from Sir Alfred Milner
to-day stating that Private T. W. Barker, of Penguin, died of enteric fever
at Deelfontein on June 15 (as previously reported in the “Advocate.”)
“Major Brown, of Ulverstone, received yesterday from the Premier
(Hon. N. E. Lewis), an official intimation to the effect that Private T. W.
Barker, of the First Tasmanian Contingent, had succumbed to enteric fever
at Deelfontein, in Cape Colony, on the 15th instant. Major Brown being
unable to proceed personally to Penguin, immediately sent in the communi-
cation to the Rev. C. Mason, upon whom devolved the duty of breaking
the sad news to his relatives, who reside near Penguin. Universal regret
is felt and expressed at the early death of this young man, who was well
known as a smart and intelligent soldier, as well as for his honesty and
straightforwardness. Private Barker acted for some time as ‘ batman ’or
orderly to Lieutenant Wallace Brown (in South Africa), who has frequently
mentioned him with the highest praise.”
BETTS, HENRY A.—Corporal Betts was the son of Mr. J. R. Betts,
of Pont vide, now of Franklin, and was killed on patrol 20th June, 1900, near
Donkerpoch. lam glad to be in a position to furnish a pretty full account
of this fine young soldier.
His Excellency the Governor received the following cablegram from
Sir Alfred Milner last week: —“Regret to inform you that Corporal H. A.
Betts was killed near Donkerpoch on June 20th.” The late Mr. H. A.
Betts was a member of the Brighton Detachment of the Brighton Auxiliary,
and joined the First Tasmanian Contingent as a private. He appears to
have been promoted during the campaign. He was 21 years of age, and
a native of Hobart, as is his father (Mr. J, R. Betts), some time adjutant of
the Rifle Regiment, and captain Infantry Reserve Force. Corporal Betts
was on leave from his position as assistant teacher at Macquarie-street State

School. Corporal F. C. Briant, writing from Karee Kloof on 2nd May last,.
sa y S ; —“My horse in the meantime got shot in the leg and chest. I had to-
let it go. i ran for about 200 yards, when H. Betts came galloping up
behind me and stopped. I got my foot in his stirrup and lay across his
saddle. He then galloped out of the firing line. Only for him I must
have been taken prisoner. Betts s horse was shot in the leg also, while
we were both on it, but it did not seem to hurt.”
Mr. Bernard Shaw, P.M., has written to the parents, saying.
“Although we heard the news of his death only this morning, I have hcmd
many people in town to-day express a high opinion of him, and regret to-
hear of the end of his career. And that is how all who knew him speak.
—-“Tasmanian Mail.”
Major Cameron, writing under date July 1, 1900, from Edendale, to
Colonel Legge, says: —“I also regret having to report that Lance-Corf oral
H. A. Betts was killed on June 20 whilst on patrol duty. The death of
Lance-Corporal Betts is a very serious loss, not only to the Contingent, but
to the Tasmanian Regiment to which he belonged, for his devotion to duty
was an example to all. He assisted a comrade who had lost his horse in
the action of the 30th April, near Karee, to a place of safety.”
Trooper F. E. Morrisby, in a letter dated September 4th, 1900, writes:.
—“Poor Harry Betts, as you no doubt have heard, has gone. He was a
real gentleman and a thorough soldier, and met a soldier’s death. He was
ever ready to do a good action and a kindness. He is greatly missed by
all here.” That is a fine testimony, and happy is the man whose
inspires such words. It reminds me of a marginal reading in the Book of
Proverbs —the true reading, I think; “That for which a man is desired is
his kindness.”
In Our Hobart Ladies’ Letter (“Tasmanian Mail”), is the following
pretty reference: —“All Tasmania is deeply grieved to hear of the death of
Private H. Betts. Like his father he had the talent for making friends,
wherever he went, and he was universally esteemed. A day or two after
he sailed a little black cat made its way to ‘Stoke.' Lady Dodds and Miss
Gatehouse, with the usual kindheartedness of women, took it in and made
much of it, and were much interested to find, when enquiries were made,,
that it had been the pet of Private Betts.”
NOTE. —A Memorial is erected in Anglican Church, Pontville, to his
memory.
BAILEY, ELLIOTT HENRY, son of Thomas H. Bailey, of Avoca,.
was killed in action on the nth September, 1900, near Fitkompot. Captain
Cameron, in a letter from Uitkompot, under date September 12, 1900,
writes :—“I regret to have to inform you that our casualties were—Private
Bailey, First Contingent, wounded in the head. He died last night.”
“Private E. Bailey behaved in a most gallant manner. His horse was
killed under him. He then went to the assistance of Private Richardson,,
and was shot almost immediately after.”


A northern paper has the following:—‘‘Avoca, Tuesday,—The sad
news which was wired to Mr. C. W. Foster by the Premier, that Private E.
Bailey, who went with the First Tasmanian Contingent, had been killed in
action in South Africa, was received with deep regret. The bells were
tolled at the respective churches, and all the stores closed at 6 o’clock, and
at 8 o’clock between 60 and 70 residents assembled in Mr. Foster’s Flail.
Mr. Adams, who was voted to the chair, spoke in feeling terms of the
sad event, which he said was somewhat softened when they remembered he
died in active service. He died as a true soldier always wishes to die, for
his Sovereign and country. The chairman, in the course of his remarks,
paid a high tribute to the late Private Bailey’s bravery, when in a hot
engagement he so nobly returned under heavy fire and rescued a disabled
comrade.”
And again;—-“ Our Avoca correspondent writes :—The circumstances
under which Private met his death, as chronicled in your journal of
the 22nd, was read here with feelings of pride and sorrow; pride that the
only man we had sent forth to help the mother country had fought as a
brave and resourceful soldier, had done his duty like a man, and that he
was one who had a kind heart and a ready hand for a comrade in distress;
sorrow, that he was no more who had so gallantly borne himself that the
verdict of one of his immediate officers reads thus;—‘He was a general
favourite, a good soldier, and a plucky fighter.’ Flis relatives and friends
may be sure that he was as reverently and tenderly placed in his narrow
bed in African soil, as if he had found a resting place in his native land amid
his kith and kin."
1 quote again from a letter by Private Fvichardson: —“On Tuesday,
the nth, I had the misfortune to be wounded in the right thigh with a soft-
nosed bullet. You will have heard about it long before this reaches you.
Dr. Jameson told me he would write and tell you how I was getting on. I
will tell you how the whole affair happened. About Bor 9 a.m. a strong-
body of mounted men and pom-poms, under Colonel Henry, went out to
clear some hills and gullies of a few of the enemy, who, we heard, were left
behind. We were in advance, and we must have done a march of 10 or is
miles. I might mention the pom-pom capsized, and when it was wanted
it was out of range. While they were getting it up again we were still
marching on, and the major made us charge the kopje with fixed bayonets,
and we found nothing there, so after that Captain Brown sent four of us to
go up on a very smooth kopje and have a look round. We advanced at
30 paces in the following order:—Bailey on the right, myself second, A.
Hortin third, and Sergeant Lee on the left. The Boers were splendidlv
concealed, and we got right to the foot of the hill, and could have only been
100 or 150 yards at most off when all at once came a crack, crack all around
us. My horse was hit in the head first shot, and I could not get him
round. All he would do was to rear up, which he did once or twice; and
then I got a poke in the leg and fell off my horse. I sang out when I was
hit. Bailey cut past me and asked where I was hit. We had not got
very far when the poor fellow was hit himself, in the brain. I did not

know about this until later. Well, our fellows in the rear kept them fiom
getting up and having a shot at me while 1 was on the ground, and they
roused them off, and came and carried me well to the rear (my leg was quite
useless to me) and laid me alongside Baimy, who- was unconscious. The
doctor was soon there, and on sight told us it was pH over with Bailey,
When he did what he could for him he started r-. me, and found the bone
was not broken, but did not know whet In i it had bei n touched, and the
bullet was still in my leg. He bandaged me up and tic i my leg to a rifle,
and I was then carried for about two miles on three rifles by my comrades
to a “dhanjibhoy,” and then had a drive across country for about 10 miles.
It was dark long before we reached our destination. Bailey died in the
“dhanjibhoy” with me at about 6 p.m. He was one of the First Contingent,
and was a fine voting fellow; had only joined us two days’ previous to this;
he had been away in hospital with enteric. I had been messing along wild
him ever since we left Kroonstadt. 1 hey left us at the South Australian
camp, as it was five miles less to go than our own. The South Australians
could not do enough for us, and turned the camp upside down. They rigged
up a “kipsie” (small tent) for me, and gave me everything I wanted; only,
unfortunately, I was not inclined for much. Then next morning they
buried Bailey, and did it properly; they gave him a proper firing party, and
decorated his grave with small white stones, and put a large flat stone at
his head, and a wooden cross covered with tin at his feet. The tin was
perforated with "Private Bailey, Tasmanian Mounted Infantry, 1900.
R.I.P.’ I believe a photo has been taken.”
TROOPER BAILEY’S GRAVE IN SOUTH AFRICA.


BLACK, HENRY MITCHELL, son of Mr. William Black of Cressy,
<died of enteric fever, April 18th, 1901, at Bloemfontein. Private Black
was born near New Norfolk 23rd September, 1879, was therefore in his
22nd year. Mr. G. R. Fenton, of Uxbridge, was his grandfather, and he
had many relatives in that district. His parents resided for some years at
“Meadow Bank,” prior to their removal to Cressy. The following letters
explain themselves. Lieutenant Heritage writes :
“Kroonstad, Orange Free State, 16th May, 1900.
“Dear Mrs. Black,
“It is with the greatest regret that I have to inform you regarding the
death of your son, Pte. Black, from enteric fever at 2.30 a.m. on the 18th
April in the field hospital, at Bloemfontein.
“He had suffered from ill-health almost from the time of his arrival in
South Africa, but had rejoined as cured before marching through the Free
State, succumbing, however, to an attack of enteric fever, as I have said,
shortly after his arrival at Bloemfontein. Private Black was of a most
willing and obliging nature, and his death was much regretted by us all.
I attended his funeral on the afternoon of his death, along with a number of
his comrades. With sincere sympathy, your obedient servant,
“Francis B. Heritage.”
Major Cameron wrote under date of August 9th, 1900, from Brug-
spruit, Transvaal: —
“Dear Madam, —
“The death of your son Henry, which occurred at Bloemfontein on the
18th April, was felt very much by both myself and all his friends in the
■contingent.
“I visited him several times during the week he was in hospital, and I
saw him for the last time on the evening of the 17th April. He died at
2.30 a.m. next day.
“He was quite delirious when I went to see him, but for a brief space
he looked at me, and then said, ‘Captain Cameron.’ I took his hand, and he
again became unconscious of his surroundings.
“He was buried with military honours in the cemetery south of the city
of Bloemfontein, where so many of our gallant fellows have found a last
resting place
“If there are any things in his kit at Cape Town they will be carefully
looked after and brought home when we return to Tasmania. He had
nothing with him except his arms and his clothing, which had to be
destroyed.
“He was a hard-working, brave lad, and I felt his death as the loss of
a personal friend.
“I most deeply sympathise with you and your husband in the loss you
have sustained, and I trust that the knowledge that your son’s services and
'gallantry in coming forward to fight for the Flag and uphold its glorious


traditions have been appreciated not only by Tasmania but by the Empire,,
will, in some way, help you and those who were dear to him, in braving the
grief which his death has caused. Believe me to be, my dear madam, yours
very sincerely,
C. Cameron, Commanding Tasmanian Contingent.”
Writing from Bloemfontein under date April 19th, Major Reay, corres-
pondent of the Melbourne “Herald,” says: “Unhappily I have to make an
addition to the lengthening list of our losses from disease. The latest
victim is a tine young Tasmanian, Private Black, who died of typhoid fever
at one of the local hospitals on the 18th inst. Black was one of the first-
comers, and had seen six months’ campaigning, came safely from under
showers of Boer bullets on several occasions, and throughout all carried
himself like the gallant soldier he was. All for what? To reach the Free
State capital, go into hospital, and die of a miserable disease. Casualties
on service we expect to have, and the folks at home know that this one or
the other held dear may any day be struck down by a Boer bullet, or rent
by a shell. When the enemy claims a man we yield him, sadly, it is true, yet
in a spirit which recognises the strict justice of the demand. We cannot
expect to do all the killing, and yet all escape being killed. It is quite a
different thing when disease rears its ugly head and seizes upon one of our
gallant young fellows. Bitterly do we grudge him, and bitterly do we com-
plain of conditions which make the ravages of disease so easy as they are
here. Poor young Black ! He was unmarried, I learn, nor will a mother’s
hot tears pay a tribute to the gallant dead. Ido not know whether he has
brothers and sisters in Tasmania, but it is understood he has.” Another
letter from Major Cameron was received by Lieutenant Cole, of Cressy,.
conveying similar sentiments.
The following belonged to the draft of First Contingent;—
BUTLER, JOSEPH, son of Mr. Richard Butler, of Longford,.
Tasmania, died of peritonitis, June 1, 1900, in the hospital at Germiston.
Private Butler was 25 years of age, having been born at Longford, and
was a farm labourer. There is not much information available about him.
He left Launceston on the 18th January with the draft of 45 men, and joined
the First Contingent at Bloemfontein in April. A note from Major Wallace
Brown to his father states that he participated in the “fighting at Brandfort,
Vet River, Zand River, and also in skirmish at the Vaal River, and gains
the Johannesburg clasp. Was admitted to the hospital at Germiston on
30/5/00.” According to these dates he died the day after he was admitted'
into the hospital.
DOOLIN, R.P., “Draft Contingent, joined a corps of cattle rangers.
Died September n, 1901.” Up to the present this is the only reference
I can find to this man. His name appears in the “Mercury” list of:
January 4, 1901, as Corporal, and he appears to have belonged to the
Southern Tasmanian Artillery,

THE LAST ROLL CALL.


PITT, ROLAND PHILIP, son of Mr. Frank Pitt, of Deloraine, died
of enteric fever, June n, 1900. In answer to our enquiries Mrs. Pitt has
written the following modest account of her heroic son;
“Dear Sirs, —In answer to yours of the 3°th October I am sending a
photo of my son, the late Private Roland Philip Pitt. He was the third son
of Thomas Pitt, and grandson of the late A. F. Rooke, the ‘ Retreat,
Deloraine, born at Hagley, September 14, 1874* He took a great interest
in the volunteers, and joined the Deloraine Company at an early age. He was
also a member of the Ulverstone Company for three years. He then went
to Queenstown, and from there to Zeehan, where he was in the employ
of the Western S.M. He volunteered for actice service December 24* 1899*
and left Launceston with the Second Contingent January 18th, 1900, and
joined the First Contingent, under Major Cameron, at Bloemfontein
in April. He took part in the advance to Pretoria, the Sand
River, battle and occupation of Kroonstadt, but was sent back from
there at the end of May, and died of enteric fever at Norval’s Pont, the nth
of June, 1900. Ido not know if these simple facts are what you require.
My son’s experiences in South Africa were much the same as those of his
comrades, whose letters have been published in the daily papers, so it is not
necessary to quote them. Yours truly, M. Pitt.”
Yes, “these simple facts” are just what the public likes to know, and
we are very glad to get them so concisely put. We should have been glad
of some of his “experiences in South Africa,” which “were much the same
as those of his comrades,” because the letters in the press are forgotten, and
the experiences of our brave boys are worthy of permanent record; for
they are part of the most striking passages of Tasmania’s history for 100
years.
NOTE.— A Framed Photo has been hung in the Town Hall, Deloraine,
to his memory.
GALVIN, THOMAS, was the son of Mr. Joseph Galvin, of Launces-
ton, and died of enteric fever, August 19th, 1900.
All efforts to obtain details of the life of Trooper Galvin have been
fruitless. This much, however, can be said of him, he was one of “our boys'’
who did his duty—even unto death.
NOTE. —A Lamp has been erected at Beaconsfield to his memory.
Out of the 52 Tasmanian Bushmen who left on the sth March, 1900, by
the “Atlantian,” only one lost his life, viz.,
JACSON, E. R. Very little information relative to Edward Roger
Jacson is available. The official list sets down “next of kin” as Mary
Jacson, Invermay, Launceston. I quote the following from Trooper H.
H. Facy’s diary. (Facy and he were great comrades): —“Ottoshoop,
August 22nd, 1900. We were in a tight corner towards the last, but retired
out of danger. The most sad part of the fighting was the loss of Stanny’s
and my mate, Ted. Jacson. Poor chap, he was retiring for cover when a
bullet struck him behind the ear and lodged behind his right eye, and death

must have been instantaneous. However, Stanny managed to get him put
on our ambulance waggon, and he was brought into camp We
Tassies and details did all the fighting to-day, and we accounted for at least
nine dead Boers and 17 horses, so goodness knows how many wounded,
. The devils used explosive bullets at us. One struck a tree I
was behind and went off like a pistol shot. The talk upon returning to
camp was of poor ‘Jackey,’ w ho was a favourite with us all, and a d
good soldier.” Under next day’s date he proceeds: “Stanny and I went
along to ‘Pill Box’s’ quarters [the doctor’s], and wrapped poor old Jacson
up in a blanket ready for burial. At 2 p.m. we had his funeral. Stanny
and I, with Rockett and W. H. Chant, were his pall-bearers, whilst Sergt.
Johnson, had charge of the (doz.) firing party. All our officers, remaining
men, and Col. Wallack (he is here on General Carrington’s staff), followed
him to his last resting place. We buried him in the graveyard across the
Malmani River. We had a Scotch cart to carry him in. The Rev. Captain
conducted the funeral service at the grave. May God grant that this
will be the last and only job of this sort we may have in South Africa!”
Since writing the above I have come across further information in the
“Examiner” of October 5, 1900.
LETTER FROM CAPTAIN RIGGALL.
“Tasmanian Bushmen’s Contingent,
“Ottoshoop, August 29. 1900.
“Sir, —It is with extreme regret that I have to write to you re the death
of Lance-Corporal Jacson, of my contingent. Of course the news was
wired at once, but I thought a few lines from me would be acceptable, and
give you a better idea of how he met his death than the mere bald announce-
ment of the same.
“We, in conjunction with about four other squadrons, were ordered out
on the morning of the 23rd, the object of the movement being to take the
enemy’s attention off some guns coming in from Mafeking. We formed
the left flanking party to two 151b. guns we had with us, and the Kimberley
mounted corps formed the advance guard. We kept about two miles to
the left of the Mafeking road, and saw no trace of the enemy till about six
miles out from Ottoshoop. Then one of the scouts was shot through the
shoulder from a thick clump of bushes at 60 or 70 yards range. I was or-
dered to send a troop out to my left front, and scour some timber, and we
had not gone a mile when we located the enemy in a strong position in some
farm houses and stone kraals and wooded kopjes.
Jacson was permanent scout to No. 1 troop, and of course was some
distance in front with three others. On coming under fire the horses were
sent under cover, and the men advanced in skirmishing order, and became
at once engaged in a lively duel. Ihe scouts had advanced to within about
200 yards under cover of some hillocks and other cover, when poor Jacson
incautiously exposed himself, and a volley was fired at him. Only one bul-
let struck him, just behind the ear, and passing down through his head,
killed him instantlv.


“We avenged him afterwards by knocking over eight Boers and 16
horses, but this does not compensate one for the loss of one of the smartest
men in the squadron. Smart, intelligent, obedient, and always there when
wanted, his loss will be hard to replace; but on the other hand he died doing
his duty with his face to the enemy, and if one has to die, how can one die
better? We buried him next day in the quiet little Dutch cemetery acfioss
the Malmani Drift, and there he sleeps quietly enough beside three others.
We have put up a head stone, and covered the mound with blocks of
stone.
“Douglas was missing after the fight, also Lawson. Lawson shot his
man, and caught us up, but Douglas was shot lying down, in the shoulder,
the bullet coming out near his hip. lam glad to say he is doing well. We
have been twice complimented by the G.O.C. for good work, and indeed
I cannot speak too highly of the way the men behave under fire. \\ hen
you have to draw fire before you can locate your enemy requires nerve.
You are probably standing up looking through your glasses, when ‘pist’
past your ear, and then the report warns you that Brother Boer is about.
Since Jacson's death we have had another fight, but I am glad to say we
had no losses, bar one horse killed and one wounded.
“And now, sir, it only remains for me to say how we appreciate the
papers you send us, and how we look forward to a Tasmanian mail. In
haste
“ (Signed) A. Horton Riggall, Captain, O.C.
“Second Squadron First Brigade, R.F.F."
A LETTER OF SYMPATHY.
Amongst the letters received by Mrs. Jacson by the mail was one
from an old servant of the family, who has been fighting in the ranks of the
Shropshire Yeomanry field force. It is dated Mafeking, August 29, and
expresses the heart-felt grief with which he had heard of Lance-Corporal
Jacson’s death. It had been the dearest desire of the Yeoman to meet the
Lance-Corporal, but unfortunately he had been one day too late, as the
sad event occurred the day before the Tasmanians joined the column. The
writer of the letter was in camp with the Tasmanians on the day Lance-
Corporal Jacson was buried, and he informed Mrs. Jacson that her late
husband was loved and respected by everybody with whom he came in con-
tact, and was regarded to be as brave a soldier as had ever been on the
South African veldt. This is what deceased’s own comrades told the Yeo-
manry. The troops gave deceased ‘a beautiful funeral with all military
honours,’ as a last tribute to as brave a soldier as ever fought for Queen and
country.”
I take the following from a long and interesting letter by Sergeant J.
J. Gardiner, which mostly covers the same ground as the foregoing
accounts :—“The ambulance picked up Jacson, who was shot through the
head. No man in the contingent was so well liked as Jacson. Always
ready to do whatever he might be called on, with a genial smile, he soon


won all members of the contingent as friends; and it did not stop there, for
wherever he went, or no matter with whom he came in contact, it was the
same. It was the man’s natural self that made him a gentleman. It was
next day that we missed him most. I and four others dug his grave, and
at 2 p.m. the contingent followed him to his last resting place, the usual 12
with reversed arms leading the way. After the service had been read and
the grave filled in, everybody seemed to file off by themselves, as if they
wished to be alone—such was the gloom cast over us. We buried him in
the Ottoshoop Cemetery, a stone bearing the following inscription being
placed at his head:—
“TR. E. R. JACSON,
Tas. 8.C.,
Killed in Action,
Ottoshoop,
22/8/00.”
The General has since complimented our Captain on the part we took,
and if I may, I should like to add a little. This is the third time we have
been in action, and I can safely say that the people of Tasmania have every
reason to be proud of the behaviour of the bushmen. They growl at only
one thing: it is that they do not get sufficient chances of getting to the
front. Our casualties are: One killed, two wounded, and nine horses
killed.”
The losses in the First Imperial Contingent under Major Lewis, D.5.0.,
were'very heavy. Two were killed; two died of wounds, and two of fever.
Two of these fell out of the ranks in 1900, all the others held on to 1901.
Taking the order of dates we have to mourn:
BROWN, GODFREY HUGH, brother of Mr. W. H. Brown, of
Penguin. Private Brown “died of wounds, September 20, 1900.” This is
the official record supplied by the Defence Department. On turning, how-
ever, to Major Lewis s “On the Veldt,” p. 96, I find the date given as
September 1. On one occasion the Major’s man mistook Tuesday for
Sunday, but Ido not know how to explain a discrepancy of 19 days! lam
glad to be able to quote the following interesting details of Private Brown’s
death. I see he is called “Jeff,” from which I suspect that “Godfrey” should
read “Geoffrey.”
“On September Ist 20 of our men, under Lieutenant Wylly, assisted by
20 of the Army Service Corps, with Captain Brooke in charge, were out
after cattle. They got into a tight corner in very difficult country, in the
direction in which we Tasmanians had been a few days previously. The
guide to the party, a Highlander named Cooper, was shot through the
body and taken prisoner. ... At the same time Trooper Jeff Brown
was mortally wounded, and his brother (Corporal) sustained severe injuries
Captain Brooke, Lieutenant Wylly, Sergeant Shaw, and TrooperWilloughby
were also wounded. . . . Meantime Trooper Bisdee, of Tasmania,
succeeded in bringing in Captain Brooke, under an exceptionally heavy fire!

Bisdee’s personal risk was extreme, and the act won him the V.C. Lieuten-
ant Wylly also gained a V.C. in that nasty little affair. Wylly was wounded
himself, but he stayed in that fire until he got Corporal Brown into a place
of safety. . . .
“Trooper Walker was still among the missing, and we scarcely
expected to see him for some time to come. But he appeared as the night
wore on. The Boers had stripped him of whatever they considered valu-
able, and now sent him with a message inviting us to send over an
ambulance for poor Jeff Brown. We sent the ambulance, but it was
stopped half way by a Boer officer, who would not allow it to proceed. As
to Brown’s fate we were left in uncertainty until we met the guide Cooper
at Pietersburg in April of the following' year. Then we learned that Brown
had died of his wounds the night of his capture. He was a great favourite,
and his loss was deeply regretted by every man of us.”
LETTE, LOUIS FRANCIS JOHN, son of W. D. Lette, of Penguin.
Private Lette died of enteric fever, October 16th, 1900.
Trooper Wadley, in a private letter, incidentally mentions him in these
cordial terms; —“One of our men died a few weeks ago with the fever, Lew
Lette. He used to be at Young’s. There is a few know him about the
Swamp. Petrie has his pony. He was a fine blok, brave has a bulldog.”
Never mind the grammar and spelling; the sentiment is right and the
finest thing one soldier could say about another. Poor Wadley died later
of the same fell disease. I regret that application to his relatives for bio-
graphical details elicited no response, as in some other cases.
McLAREN, PERCY, son of Robert McLean, Ulverstone, was killed
in action January 22, 1901, near Bronkhorstspruit. The reference to
Trooper McLaren in Major Lewis’s book is brief owing possibly to the
fact, as I assume, that the Major was absent at the time in hospital. Here
is the reference:—“ Sundry small engagements ensued. Just outside
Bronkhorstspruit Trooper McLaren was shot dead whilst scouting on the
26th January. He had been in hospital, and had only returned to the
column three days previously.” The date I take it is a slip, since it is
given in the appendix as the 22nd, 1901.
One of his comrades in a private letter thus describes the scene and
circumstances of McLaren’s death: —“We were looking at the graves
where the rearguard got cut up so badly in the 1881 war; and out on the
right kopje we could see the Boers. Two groups were told off to hold a
kopje, so the eight of us galloped up to the foot of it and dismounted,
and started up the hill. We just got on top and the Boers were coming up
the other skyline about 500 yards from us. They saw us before we saw
them, and very soon the explosive bullets were flying around us. We all
laid down in the grass and started firing. We got up and advanced to the
place. They made us lay down a few times. I went away to the left, and
McLaren, who got shot, went away to the right. A half-caste laid in the
grass till he got right close to him, and shot him in the stomach. , . We
got to the spot where the Boers were at first, and we could see them out of

range. The nearest man to McLaren went to him and spoke a few words
to him, and then went to the doctor; but when the doctor got there he had
received another bullet in the mouth and out of the head, dhis bullet
seemed a mystery to me. We made a stretcher with two rifles and two or
three puttes, and carried him off the kopje. It was a terrible sight to see.
We took him to Balmoral, and then half-a-dozen of us dug a grave for him.
This letter was written March 13, 1901. The writer died of enteric fever.
The following is an account of Trooper McLaren’s death at Bronk-
hurstspruit as near as I can remember it:—“We moved off early on the
morning of the 22nd January, 1901, from Bronkhorstspruit along the road
to Balmoral, a station on the Delagoa Bay Railway. Soon after passing
the graves of the British soldiers, who were massacred in 1881 by the Boers,
sniping began on the right flank. We (the Tasmanians), were on the right
flank of the convoy that morning under the command of Capt. Lewis,
D.S.O. The road lay up a valley flanked on the right by a low ridge, with
undulating country beyond. It was on this ridge that the snipers were
hiding, and accordingly Lieutenant Sale ordered twelve men up on the
ridge to dislodge them and occupy the position till the rearguard should
come along to relieve them. We watched our fellows gallop up to the
bottom of the ridge and dismount, hand their horses over to the horse-
holders, and begin to advance. A few Boers were seen, who speedily
retreated before the fire of our men. As the firing increased Lieutenant
Page ordered the rest of us up, and by that time the Boers were apparently
driven off, as we could see numbers of them galloping away in the distance.
It must have been about the time Lieutenant Page got there with his men
that poor McLaren was shot. As far as can be gathered McLaren, who
was on the extreme right, must have walked almost on to the place where
a Boer lay concealed in the grass. The man fired, and the bullet passed
through McLaren’s body, inflicting a fearful and fatal wound. Trooper
Ward, who was close by, heard the shot, but as it was so close he supposed
it to be McLaren’s own rifle, and so lost the chance of shooting the man.
A little later, however, he saw the man making off in the rocks, and fired one
or two shots at him, but as far as he could tell without effect. One or two
others of our men also had shots at the Boer. Poor McLaren, who was
sinking fast, called Ward to him, and after giving him a message to convey
to his parents and some of his comrades, told him to go on firing, as he
(McLaren) was past human aid. We were now ordered off, as the rear-
guard had come up by this time. All except a few of us remained in
ignorance of McLaren’s death, but were informed a little later by one of
our comrades, who had gone for the ambulance. This news came as a
great shock to us, for we could not have been at a very great distance from
him when he fell. His death cast a general gloom over our company, as
apart from losing a good and noble comrade, we had the fact brought home
to us all very forcibly, that anyone of us might meet with the same fate.
McLaren’s body was brought on to Balmoral in the ambulance, and after
being sewn up in a blanket was buried in a little Dutch cemetery close by
The grave was dug by a party of us, who volunteered for the work, and


about 4 o clock in the afternoon poor McLaren’s body was borne to its
last resting place by his comrades. After the burial service was read by the
Cnaplain, the grave was covered, and a rude cross erected by his comrades
to mark the spot. “ L D , Burbury.”
WALTER, CRESSW ELL HERBERT, son of Mr. John C. Walter, of
Caulfield, \ ictoria, was killed in action near Pietersburg, April 9, 1901.
The following letter from Lieutenant Walter’s father gives in a concise
manner some interesting personal details, for which I am very grateful.
“Malvern Grove, Caulfield, Victoria, 22nd October, 1902.
ar .“^ r ’ answer to your circular requesting information as to
my son s life and death I should in the first place point out that he can
scarce!) be called a Son of iasmania, as he was born in Caulfield on the
7th October, 1873, and baptised in the name of Cresswell Herbert. Immedi-
ately before he enlisted as a private he was engaged as purser in one of the
Lnion Company s steamships, and joined the Tasmanian Corps, being on
the spot, rather than run the risk of delay by coming to Melbourne.
During the month of drill, etc., before sailing, he was promoted to Corporal,
Sergeant, and Lieutenant, and before he died was recommended for a
captaincy.
“Of his action in the field I have very little to relate, as he seldom
wrote particulars. He was a general favourite with officers and men. His
death took place at the taking of the town of Pietersburg in the following
manner: —Captain Sale and my son were riding into the town, when the
former was picked off by a man in ambush, and fell to the ground.
Cresswell immediately dismounted to assist his comrade, and in that duty
received his fatal shot from the same rifle. A movement in the long grass
led to his discovery, when the man held up his hands saying, * I surrender. ’
The men very promptly pointed out that he was too late and riddled him
through. The man had evidently presumed on the leniency generally
shown, and supposed that whatever he had done he had only to surrender
to save his life, but in this case he was disappointed.
“I am sending herewith some slips from the papers and a photo, which
you will, I hope, return as you promised, as his portrait is in great request,
and the slips are valued as matters of reference. I am, dear Sir, yours
■very truly,
“ Jno* C. Walter.”
HOW THE TASMANIANS FELL.
SHOT BY A SNIPER.
London, April 12. —Further details are published of the fighting in
which Lieutenants A. A. Sale and C. H. Walter, of the Tasmanian Bush-
men’s Corps, lost their lives.
The Tasmanians formed part of General Plumer’s force, which was
advancing on Pietersburg. When nearing the town six of their number


passed a place where a Boer sniper had carefully concealed himself. Ihe
Boer opened fire on the Tasmanians, and killed Lieutenants Walter and Sale
by two successive shots, ihe Boer sniper was afterwards killed. Aigus,
April 13th, 1901.
“News has been received in Tasmania concerning the cable message
published on Thursday reporting the death of Lieutenant \\ alter, of the
Tasmanian battalion of the Australian Imperial Regiment. Lieutenant
Walter was the youngest son of Mr. J. C. W alter, of Caulfield, and was an
old Melbourne Grammar School boy. He was for some time with the
Union Steamship Co. of New Zealand, and left their employ to join the
contingent. He obtained speedy promotion. He was a popular and
plucky officer, and the news of his death has caused great regret."
An illustrated paper has this letterpress accompanying Lieutenant
Walter’s photo.:—“ The late Lieutenant C. H. Walter, whose portrait
appears on this page, was one of the Tasmanian officers recently killed at
Pietersburg, in South Africa, but, although a member of the 1 asmanian
Bushmen’s Corps, he was a Victorian by birth, being a son of Mr. J. C.
Walter, of Caulfield, while he had many relatives and friends in this state.
Happening to be in Tasmania when the corps was formed, he volunteered
for service as a private, but owing to his zeal and capacity was rapidly
promoted, first to be sergeant and then lieutenant, sailing with the latter
rank to South Africa. He was a very popular, plucky, and capable officer,
just cut out for an army career, in which he would have been sure to
distinguish himself, but for the sad chance befalling the little detachment of
Tasmanians sniped by a solitary Boer, who shot in succession its two
officers and one of the privates. The greatest sympathy is felt for
Lieutenant Walter’s relatives, and his loss is also keenly felt by very many
friends.”
Major Lewis, D.5.0., in his book, “On the Veldt,” thus refers to the
sad event above narrated: —“Captain Sale had been shot from cover in long
grass only thirty paces distant. The grass in this country often grows four
feet high, and the Boer was quite concealed. Lieutenant Walter soon came
to his fallen comrade’s assistance ; a shot rang out from the same rifle, and
Walter fell dead. The same enemy shot both the officers' horses. Mean-
time Trooper O’May, who was acting galloper, and was close by, had his
horse shot from under him. O’May himself escaped. All this time the
Boer lay concealed at a few yards distance. Whenever our men fired he
fired, so that we could not tell by the sound of his shots where he was
hiding. And now Trooper Wadley, of Tasmania, showed his mettle.
Braving that hidden relentless rifle, he crawled up to Sale, and tried to stop
the flow of blood. Wadley escaped the Boer’s bullet only to die of enteric
a week later. Presently our brave Westralian doctor, Gibson, came gallop-
ing up. He, with his usual pluck—fearing nothing, caring nothing—went
straight to the assistance of the sorely wounded man. Gibson is all heart
and nerve. Exposing himself carelessly, he leant over poor Sale and
attended to his hurts. The Boer had two shots at the doctor; but neither
shot told Meantime, however, I am getting away from this


solitary Boer and his victims. The man had done harm enough; but it was
absurd to think that one Boer could bar our progress. A hundred men
were called up, and in extended order of about one horse’s length they
galloped through the long grass. But they could not locate the man, and
they went on. Hah a dozen Tasmanians, however, were not content with
that, and remained behind to satisfy themselves as to their cool enemy’s
whereabouts. After a little, the Boer, thinking that all had passed, showed
himself, and attempted to sneak away. He was a dead man in an instant of
time, pumped full of bullets. But we had paid dearly enough for his life,
dwo officers, one trooper, and no less than five horses had fallen to his rifle.
This Boer proved to be a schoolmaster in Pietersburg. He was a non-
combatant, and he sneaked out by himself to shoot unsuspecting men as
they passed practically within arm’s length of him. This, I take it, is
scarcely war.”—“On the Veldt,” pp. 144-6.
The remainder of this graphic account will be given under the next
name.
.SALE, ARTHUR ARNOLD, son of Mr. J. T. Sale, of Launceston,
“died from wounds” on the 9th April, 1901, at Pietersburg, S.A. Captain
Sale went out as second Lieutenant with the First Imperial Contingent (or
Bushmen), under Major Lewis, D.5.0., the other Lieutenants being
Perkins, W alter, and Wylly. 1 quote from a letter from Mr. J. T. Sale
under date of September, 1902 : —“My son, the late Captain A. A. Sale, who
was mortally wounded at Pietersburg, while in command of the First
Imperial Tasmanian Bushmen on the Bth of April, 1900, Lieutenant Walter
of the same contingent, and Private Fraser, of the West Australians being
shot at the same time by the same person, a Boer sniper (who proved to be
a schoolmaster) concealed in the long grass.” Having referred to Major
Lewis’s book and the account there given, he proceeds “I send you by this
post a photo of Captain Sale, and could send you some interesting extracts
from his letters, but hardly know what to send without knowing more about
the sort of book you intend publishing. If either of you should be in
Launceston at any time I should be glad to see you on the subject.”
I quote again from page 144 of Major Lewis’s book:—“ April Bth. The
day will dwell in the memory of all our squadron. On this day the troops
were formally to enter Pietersburg. The Tasmanians had the honour to be
the first to enter the town. Captain Sale, with a small troop, marched
through the place and out to a ridge beyond. From good cover at some
distance a party of Boers was sniping. Moving out in that direction, Sale
was suddenly seen to fall from his horse. He had been mortally wounded
by a Boer who fired from cover in long grass only 30 paces distant.” The
remainder of the account has been reproduced under Lieutenant Walter’s
name above, down to these words ; —“Poor Sale died of his wounds early on
the morning of the 10th. All that skill could do for him was done; Dr.
Gibson’s attentions were tireless and unremitting. At one time the doctor
hoped to pull him through, but the inscrutable Fates willed it otherwise.
His wound was severe, and the shock to his system had been excessive.


“The bodies of Captain Sale and Lieutenant Walter were laid side by
side in the cemetery at Pietersburg. At the head of the grave stands a
plain white stone, all visible that remains to mark the passing of two
staunch and loyal comrades, two most brave and honourable men. iheir
remains were borne to the grave on the guns of the pom-pom battery, in
charge of Captain Rotten and Lieutenant Wilson. The Rev. Mr. Day, of
Queensland, read the funeral service; three volleys of ball cartridges were
fired over the grave; the trumpets sounded the “Last Post,’ and so the sad
ceremony ended. At the grave were General Plumer and the staff, and
every squadron or company was represented. Many a brave fellow was
deeply moved; some completely broke down. If ever there was a time
when men’s tears were excusable, surely it was now! Two young officers
who had gone through the same hardships, and shared the same meagre
pleasures —men who had endeared themselves to their comrades in a
hundred ways —were to be seen no more amongst us. They had died, not
by braving the accustomed perils of war, but by what was practically the
treachery of a murderous hand. The thing was altogether most pitiful.
If animosity to the Boers flamed that day to a positive white heat of hatred
in the hearts of the Tasmanian troopers, who can murmur?” “On the
Veldt,” p. 147.
The following is the official report of the death of Captain Sale: —“Piet-
ersburg, N. Transvaal, April 10, 1901. To Colonel Legge, Commandant
Tasmanian D. F., Tasmania. Sir, —In the absence of Captain Lewis, it is
my most painful duty to have to report to you the deaths of Lieutenants
Sale and Walter, who were both killed whilst bravely doing their duty
during the entry of the British into this town on the Bth inst. Lieutenant
Sale, who for some time had been in command of this contingent, was the
first to fall shot through the groin by a sniper, who lay concealed in the
long grass, not 50 yards distant. All possible aid was rendered by both our
own medical officer (who was on the spot immediately),and the Royal Army
Medical Corps, but of no avail, as poor Sale died about 36 hours after, I am
thankful to say, with very little pain. Lieutenant Walter, who had
just ridden to Mr. Sale, was giving an order when he fell shot through the
heart, a victim to the same sniper, who, indeed, succeeded in shooting a
West Australian dead before he was discovered by our men, at whose hands
he met the fate he so richly deserved. We have suffered a great loss, one
which can never be replaced, and shall ever remember Easter Mondav, 1901,
as the saddest day we have experienced in the country. Tasmania will
mourn with us two of our bravest officers and truest men. The men unite
with me in asking that our deepest sympathy be conveyed to the relations of
both officers in their great bereavement. They were not only good officers,
but true friends to men of all ranks.
“It is also my sad duty to report that the death of Trooper Geoff H.
Brown (No. 30), has been confirmed. On our arrival in this town I saw
the guide who was wounded with him: the latter states that poor Brown
lived only about 10 hours after he was shot; although everything possible

was done by the Boer doctor. The case was hopeless. 1 have the honour
to be, Sir, yours obediently,
“Louis G. E. Page, Lieutenant,
“Fourth Tasmanian Imperial Bushmen Contingent.
The following reference is from a letter by Trooper Maurice Hales
(son of the late Archdeacon Hales, of Launceston), of the West Australian
Bushmen:—
“In camp Pietersburg, April 13th, 1901. —The column arrived here on
Easter Monday morning the Bth, and they rode through and up the rise
to the N.E. of the township, where there was a sharp bit of sniping, in which
I regret to say Lieutenant Walter, of the Tasmanians, was shot dead, and
Lieutenant Sale wounded, and Trooper Frazer of ours shot and died 10
minutes afterwards. Lieutenant Sale was shot just as he was dismounting,
and while he was lying on the ground continued giving orders to his men
to keep under cover as much as possible and charge. We were all dumb-
founded when we heard the news down the line, and had hopes of Sale’s
recovery, but when we arrived here I was shocked to hear he had died at
1 o’clock that morning, and was buried that afternoon. I was greatly dis-
appointed at not being able to attend his funeral. It was surprising to see
how widely known and respected he was, especially among our regiment,
and was worshipped by the Tassies. He was fearless and careful in the
execution of his duties, and was looked upon by his superiors as an able
leader and true soldier.
“His comrade, Lieutenant Walter, was also highly respected as an
officer and a man. Some of us have served under him on several occasions,
and always found him an able and good officer; and like Lieutenant Sale,
always trying to do the best he could for the men under him. And as to
our man Fraser, he was a favourite in the troop, and always willing and
game under fire. It seems hard to realise that we shall see them no more.
The Tassies are much cut up about it. They were the advance guard, and,
of course, were the first fired on. Several had very narrow escapes, many
of their horses being hit, one, I am told, having seven bullets in him.”
WADLEY, WILLIAM ISAAC, next of kin Mr. William Wadley,
“Como,” Bishopsbourne, Tasmania, died of enteric fever, April 18, 1901.
Trooper Wadley, who was a brave fellow, was born near Bishopsbourne,.
December sth, 1879, and had, therefore, only just come of age. His death
took place at Pretoria.
Major Lewis points out how bravely he bore himself when Captain Sale
was shot at Pietersburg. Wadley went up to the wounded man while the
sniper was still concealed close by, and tried to stop his bleeding. “Wad-
ley escaped the Boer's bullet only to die of enteric fever later.”
From his private letters we find that he was always brave and unselfish,,
ever in the thickest of danger, and never thinking of himself. He does not
seem to have ever been wounded, but he had fever twice, another illustration
of the fact, that disease generally kills more than war does, in war time..
Trooper Wadley had a poor opinion of the shooting of the Boers, at any


rate in the earlier letters he wrote home. Possibly his respect might have
increased with fuller experience. Perhaps it is the characteristic of brave
men to minimise danger, for there can be little doubt that the Boers are
excellent marksmen.

TWO GALLANT TASMANIANS.
TWENTY-TWO BOERS KEPT AT BAY.
London, May 21. —A splendid instance of gallantry on the part of two
Tasmanians is reported.
I he two lasmanians were Privates Warburton and Brownell, who were
in the detachment under Colonel E. T. Wallack that recently engaged Com-
mandant Scheepers, at Gannashoek, in the Cape Colony. On that occa-
son three Tasmanians were wounded, and one was captured. The next day
the Tasmanians again attacked the Boers, expelling them from the position
without sustaining any loss.
Brownell and Warburton were intercepted by 22 Boers at Gannashoek.
Sheltering themselves behind trees the two men opened fire upon the enemy.
They made splendid practice, and three times repulsed the Boers, who were
closing in upon them, many of whom fell by their bullets. Eventually they
had to shoot their own horses in order to provide themselves with cover.
Behind the bodies they still maintained a desperate resistance.
At last Warburton was shot in the head. Brownell continued to fire
until he had used up his last cartridge, and he then surrendered. After he
had given himself up one of the Boers shot him in the shoulder. Brownell
was stripped of his arms and accoutrements and then released,
Warburton subsequently died from his wound.
[Private Brownell is a son of Mr. W. F. Brownell, a well-known resi-
dent of Newtown, Hobart. He went to South Africa with the first
Tasmanian Contingent in 1899, an d was invalided home with the troops
which returned under Colonel Tom Price in the “Harlech Castle” last year.
After a short rest he returned to the front with the last Tasmanian
Contingent in the transport “Chicago.”]

An Ambush Story.
THE LAST STAND OF TWO TASMANIANS.
SPLENDID GALLANTRY.
Ihe following (says the “Cradock Referee” of 16th May) is a detailed
account of the affair at Gannashoek last week, when two Tasmanians with-
stood the attack of 22 Boers for several hours.
At 8.40 a.m. orders were received by No. 1 Division Tasmanian M.I.
to saddle up, and shortly after they were joined by a division of the Imperial
Yeomanry, the combined force numbering 45. They headed towards a road
which led through the pass to the west of Mortimer. At this point Lieu-
tenant Bligh 1 Blyth] ordered Corporal Brownell to take four men and move out
on the right flank about a quarter of a mile from the main body. All went
well until they reached some thick scrub which lines the left bank of a sloot
(a dry creek), ihe hill on the right stood up almost perpendicularly to a
height of about 200 feet. Finding it impossible for the flankers to keep in
line, Corporal Brownell cantered over to the officer, and suggested that the
men should go in file 20 or 30 yards apart, which was agreed to, but he had
no sooner got back to Warburton, when the sharp crack of rifles rang out a
few hundred yards in the rear. They immediately took cover in some
scrub, and the officer whistled to the men to retire. The enemy commenced
firing rapidly on the retreating force, and the two Tasmanians, finding them-
selves entirely cut off, kept in the scrub.
In the meantime the main body had retired under a heavy cross fire.
Troopers B. Saunderson and Burton were both slightly wounded in the
head while retiring, and several others had their horses shot under them,
ihe Boers evidently thinking that all the men were now in the rear, came
strolling up the sloot in a very careless fashion. When level with the first-
mentioned Tasmanians, about 30 yards distant, these covered them, but
hesitated to fire, thinking the Boers were part of some colonial corps. But
the Boers spotted the horses, which were close by, and without a second’s
warning, sent a dozen bullets whizzing round the ears of the two men. The
Boers found excellent cover under the bank of the sloot, and brisk firing
was kept up 01 both sides for some time, the only cover the Tasmanians
had being some small stumps about nine inches in diameter. A lull then took
place for fully half an hour, during which time the troopers shot ten Boer
horses. They then took the slings off their rifles, rid themselves of belts,
bayonets and other useless gear and refilled the magazines.
The second attack came very suddenly, and after a few minutes one of
the enemy knelt upon the bank to get a good shot at Brownell, but received
a shot in the stomach from the Tasmanian. The Boers caught the man by
his boots, and pulled him under the bank.
Another pause then took place of an hour’s duration, the Boers calling
out, “Hands up, you dogs.” Seeing they had no chance, Brownell
told Warburton to shoot his horse while he did the same to his, but War-
THE LAST ROLL CALL


burton refused. Eventually they shot both horses, ihe Boers had not
fired at the troopers’ horses, doubtless expecting to capture them. ihe
poor animals had stood the racket of the firing splendidly, and it was hard
to have to knock them over.
The third and final attack soon came. The suspense felt by the troopers
was awful. They had taken cover behind their dead horses, but, thinking
this insufficient, they crawled back about ten yards to the rear of their
former position, and found shelter behind some small stumps. Ihe enemy
then pushed their attack more determinedly than ever, shouting to the
troopers as before, and Warburton was hit in the head, falling unconscious
across Brownell, who, after firing the last shot in his magazine, surrendered.
After putting down his rifle, one cowardly wretch deliberately fired at him,
the bullet cutting away the shoulder part of his tunic and shirt. It was a
trying moment for him with fully a dozen rifles covering him when he got
to work with bandages to dress his comrades's head, on seeing which the
Boers cooled down. He was soon stripped of all his valuables, including
a belt and sheath knife, £4 and a letter. All that was left him were his trou-
sers and boots. After Warburton’s wound had been bound up, the Boer
corporal took Brownell to his lieutenant, who gave him a dressing down
for trying to hold out against such superior numbers.
It appears that the number who had been around the two men were 22.
They said they had allowed the two to pass within twenty yards of their
hiding place, and had they left their cover to rejoin the main body, they
must inevitably have been riddled. The lieutenant would not allow any of
his men to stay and assist Brownell with his wounded comrade, but gave
them a blanket. It was a dreadful sight, Warburton lying in a semi-
conscious state, whilst the three Boers shot by them lay a few yards off,
stretched on blankets. The man who had been hit by Brownell was
evidently sinking rapidly. Shortly afterwards they reached the ambulance,
and got back to camp.
Next morning Warburton, on being roused, said to Brownell, “Well,
Doug., how did we shake them up?” adding that he trusted in the Lord.
In spite of every attention in the hospital, the poor fellow expired. He had
a soldier’s funeral in the village cemetery. Jack Warburton stuck to his
comrade gallantly, and his courage was of the V.C. order. He was a great
favourite in the division, and his memory will be cherished by all.
ORR, JOHN, eldest son of Mr. William Orr, of Underwood, Tas-
mania, was killed November 18, 1901. Corporal Orr was born on the 23rd
April, 1880, at Moor Row, Cumberland, England, and was, therefore, just
about reaching manhood. He came to Tasmania with his parents about
16 years ago, and had followed the life of a farmer until the “Call to Arms”
rang in his ears.
He was a member of the Second Imperial Contingent, under Colonel
Watchorn. His brother writes that he has “a half-crown and a two shilling
piece that were struck by a bullet in his belt. They are completely doubled
up; also a note book partly shot away. He kept a diary, but the Boers


took that with lots of other useful things.” His brother, Mr. Thos. Orr,
sends also some interesting newspaper extracts, but as there is no name I
do not know from what journal, nor am I able to give the date.
The Commandant has recently received some interesting letters from
Lieutenant-Colonel Watchorn, including an official report of the death of
Corporal Orr, an extract of which is given that may be of interest to the
public.
CORPORAL ORR’S GRAVE IN SOUTH AFRICA
“I have the honour to report for your information that during the
engagement with the Boers on November 18, 1901, at Reitpoort, a farm
about 13 miles east of Jameston, No. 213, Corporal John Orr, was killed,
and that No. 258, Trooper G. H. Blyth had his horse shot and was captured,
and after having been stripped of his leggings, rifle, bandolier, etc., his
pockets searched and money taken, he was released. Corporal Orr rode
within thirty yards of the enemy, when he was shot in three places, and died
instantly. He was riding at the head of his column in his usual place,
scouting. His loss is deeply regretted by every man in his regiment. He
was a general favourite of the whole column, everyone recognising his ster-
ling qualities and bravery as a soldier. He had frequently distinguished
himself by capturing Boers, both when single-handed, and when with his
comrades, the last occasion being when he and No. 268, Charles Cawthorn
galloped up and captured a picket of five armed Boers. He had made a


study of scouting, and took a great interest in his work, and everyone
recognised him as one of the very best scouts the column had?”
Lieutenant-Colonel Watchorn has sent other letters which are un-
official, that deal chiefly with the long trek which his column had under
Colonel Gorringe (whose place is now taken by Colonel Scobel) in pursuit
of General Smut’s commando.
The next “cutting" contains an extract from Private C. Richardson’s
letter (no date). “1 suppose you already know about our recent bit of bad
luck having Corporal J. Orr shot. Poor fellow ! His was a proper soldier’s
death. While scouting he rode within 50 yards of the Boers before they
opened fire. Then, after being hit by two bullets he got on his horse and
galloped away about 200 yards, when an explosive hit him in the back,
exploding inside and killing him almost instantly. We buried him on the
spot, and did his grave up beautifully. I have a stone off his grave which
lam sending in this. A farmer hard by told our men that the Boers had
left three hours before, so we helped ourselves to the things in his house,
and what we couldn’t take we smashed. Orr was a grand fellow, and as
brave as a lion. He was a general favourite with the whole lot of the
contingent, and I am sure their heartiest sympathy goes home to his people
in their sad bereavement.”
Lieutenant Bisdee, V.C., writing to his mother from Reitfontein under
date November 20, gives high praise to poor Orr’s good qualities. He
writes; —“l feel as though I had lost a personal friend, having had so much
to do with him. His straightforward manly bearing, and bright honest
face quite won the hearts of all who came in contact with him. His was a
most exceptional character, brave and fearless in danger, upright and
honest. A hen acting as my sergeant, any order given was certain to be
carried out without any trouble. The men, though nearly all his seniors
m age, would do anything for him. As corporal of the scouts he won
golden opinions from all his officers, who have specially mentioned him
several times. In this capacity, which is always one of considerable risk,
he did some very pluck)-' deeds, which in others have been rewarded by
special honours, but a scout must do his duty right away from the view of
his comrades, so that the bravest deeds are unknown and unrewarded here,
though doubtless they have their reward elsewhere. So a noble character
has passed away, and every day we miss his cheery voice. The Boer who
shot him was behind some rocks, and waited till he came within 20 vards.
He did not go more than 30 yards before he fell. . . . Yesterday I
read the burial service at the grave, at which the whole contino-ent
attended.”
L\ NE, DOUGLAS MORTON, son of Mr. Henry Lyne, Fingal, died
of enteric fever, May 4th, 1902. Q.M.S. Lyne was born near Swansea, May
26th, 1877, and was, therefore, within three weeks of 25 years old. His
death took place at Norval s Pont. He had been for some years in the
Bank of Australasia, before joining the company. He joined as a trooper,
but before leaving was made corporal, and other promotions speedily fol-


lowed. When the column was broken up, and the Tasmanians attached to
another, Q.M.S. Lyne was allowed by Colonel Watchorn to go with
Lieutenant Cooper, Army Service Corps, and retained his rank in Colonel
Jervis s column on extra service pay, under Lieutenant Cox up to the 22nd
April, on which date he left to join the Tasmanians, who were mobilising to
return home. On the 26th he was removed from a troop train at Nerval's
Pont, suffering from enteric fever, and in a very dangerous condition. He
succumbed on the 4th May, and was buried the following day.
Abundant testimony to the bravery of young Lyne is borne by his
superior officers and comrades alike. Lieutenant-Colonel Watchorn, in a
letter published elsewhere, speaks of him thus: “Examiner," April 5,
1902: —‘T wish to draw your attention to an error which appeared in your
columns on Monday, January 20th, in which it mentions two sergeants of
the Second Tasmanian Imperial Contingent having distinguished them-
selves at the capture of Commandant Erasmus and two other command-
ants. This should have been Quartermaster-Sergeant D. M. Lyne and
transport Sergeant Coombe. The facts were that Colonel Gorringe
called for volunteers to storm a kopje on which the enemy were known to
be. Sergeant-Major Young, of the Cape Police, selected seven men, four
of whom were Tasmanians. They instantly charged the kopje, and found
by the fire that there were a large number of Boers there. Without
hesitation they galloped into their midst, and succeeded as aforesaid in
capturing three Commandants and shooting and capturing other Boers.
The Boers, thinking there were a large number of Khakis coming, became
disorganised and fled. Sergeant-Major Young, on being interviewed,
stated that if he had 20 Tasmanians he would go anywhere.”
No. 2 COMPANY, SECOND IMPERIAL CONTINGENT, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Watchorn. There were only two deaths out of this
batch, though their strength was 118. One of these died before some of
those above-mentioned.
COWELL, FRANCIS GEORGE, son of Mr. Arthur Alex. Cowell,
Cam, Somerset, Tasmania, died of enteric fever, November 25th, 1901, at
Deelfontein, South Africa. Trooper Cowell was a Victorian by birth,
having been born at “Bringalbert,” near Apsley. In 1892 the family came
to Tasmania, and the subject of this sketch remained at home until the
sentiment of the Empire seized him. Cowell seems to have been promoted
to the rank of Lance-Corporal. The following two paragraphs from the
“Daily Telegraph” November 26th and 29th, 1901, are self-explanatory.

LANCE-CORPORAL COWELL DANGEROUSLY ILL.

DEATH OF A TASMANIAN.
Hobart, Thursday.—The Premier has received an advice to the effect
that trooper F. G. Cowell, of the No. 2 Company of the last contingent,
which left this state on March 27, 1901, had died of enteric fever at Deel-
fontein on the 25th inst. Deceased was reported to be in a dangerous
condition some days ago. He was a son of Mr. A. A. Cowell, of Somerset,
River Cam.
HUTLEY, LEONARD, P., son of Mr. James Hutley, of St. John-
street, Launceston, died of enteric fever, February 14th, 1902, at East
London, South Africa. Trooper Hutley was the youngest son of Mr.
Hutley, of the Post Office, Launceston, and was born in that city on August
12th, 1879, and was therefore in his 23rd year.
From private sources I gather that he had a pretty rough time through
severe weather and illness. He does not seem to have said much himself
about his soldier s life; and, through the burning of the storehouse, where
his kit was stored, neither diary, papers, nor other memorials reached his
friends. Two letters received from his nurse indicate that his attack of
fever was severe, and that he was unconscious a good part of the time.
FIRST BATTALION AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH
HORSE. —Of the hirst Battalion of “E” Company Australian Common-
wealth Horse, under Captain Perceval, which embarked per “Manchester
Merchant, February 16th, 1902, two men only lost their lives. Of these
the first was :
FITZALLEN, ALBERT EDWARD, son of Mr. J. Fitzallen, Ross,
Tasmania, died of enteric fever on the 30th April, 1902, after a short sojourn
in South Africa. Trooper Fitzallen was very young, having scarcely
reached 20, and generally enteric was more fatal with the younger men.
Military enthusiasm was strong in the Fitzallen household, for members of
the family appear in three different contingents. One went with the First
Contingent, under Major Cameron; another served 15 months under
Colonel Watchorn. These brothers came back safely; the third, however,
who is the subject of this sketch, was the family’s sacrifice to the god of
war.
There are but few cases in which three brothers gave their services to
the Empire. Among these were, I believe, Major Wallace Brown and two
brothers, one of whom, “Jeff,” fell in the fray.
Young Fitzallen was a native of Ross, and was a blacksmith by trade.
His age is given in the Nominal Roll as 19 years and five months. He was
not quite the youngest is his company, Trooper Crooks being only 18 years
and three months.
MORRISBY, FRANK, EDWARD, fourth son of William Edward
and Mary Consett Morrisby, died of hepatic abscess at Klerksdorp, June
25th, 1902. Young Morrisby, who had attained the rank of 0.M.5., was
born at Glenorchy, March 10th, 1874, and was therefore 28 years of age.

TROOPER FITZALLEN'S GRAVE in SOUTH AFRICA.


He was educated under Mr. M'Ardell, Mornington School, Bellerive, and
subsequently went to the Scotch College, Hobart, then under the head-
mastership of Mr. Ireland, and for nine years prior to his leaving for South
Africa he was in the Tasmanian Civil Service (clerical branch).
Some time prior to the announcement of his death the following
appeared in the “Mercury”“The Premier (Hon. N. E. Lewis, C.M.G.),
has received advice from Capetown, through His Excellency the Governor, ’
intimating that Q.M.S. Frank Morrisby was, on June 15, dangerously ill at
Klerksdorp. This non-commissioned officer left Tasmania on February
16th with “E Company of the First Commonwealth Contingent, which
was despatched for service under the command of Captain Perceval.”
Subsequently the following obituary notice appeared in the “Mercury”;
- The news of the death of Q.M.S. Morrisby, at Klerksdorp, from abscess
of the liver, came as a great surprise and shock to his wide circle of friends
and acquaintances. The fourth son of the respected Council Clerk and Sub -
Inspector of Clarence, deceased had held the position of clerk at H.M. Gaol,
Hobart. When the call was made on the colony for troops, Frank
Morrisby, or Sancho, as he was familiarly called, resigned his position,
and enlisted under Colonel (then Captain) Cameron. He went through
some stirring times with the gallant colonel, and on completion of the
contingent’s service in South Africa he returned to Hobart. But the
martial spirit was too strong in him to permit of his settling down to a
humdrum life, and he again joined the forces and returned to South Africa
with the rank of Q.M.S. Of robust build, hardy-looking, and well set up.
he was one of the last men one would think of being knocked down by
disease. Many were expecting to hear good accounts of him from the
seat of war, and his sudden and much-to-be-lamented death has come as a
great shock to all. Wide sympathy is expressed for his family.”
The following “noun sentences” are taken from the “Tasmanian
News”:—
That the death of Frank Morrisby in South Africa has come as a great
blow to those who knew him.
“That ‘Sancho,’ as he was popularly called, was a man who was loved
by all.
“That his heart was, metaphorically speaking, as large as his body.
That he was never known to say an unkind word to anyone.
“That his genial disposition made him a favourite with all.
“That he possessed a wit that was always brimful of good nature and
consideration.
That it seems that the best are always taken, and the least worthy left
That ‘Sancho’ looked like a person of whose life a lease could be
taken.
That the perfect tepes of manhood are always the first to succumb in
South Africa.
That it was thin wiry fellows who seldom met with any harm.
_ “That fever or anything else never seemed to come the way of any slim
individual.

Of the SECOND FEDERAL CONTINGENT, A.C.H. (Tasmanian

Grange,” on that memorable return trip.
CTJNDY, CHARLES, son of Mr. W. Cundy, of Ballarat, was born in
Hobart, and was only a little over 20 years of age. He died of pneumonia
on the 2nd August, 1902. The following letter from his former employer
will be of interest:—
“Sorell, December 9th, 1903.
“Dear Sir, —Cundy worked for me for two years, and a better or more
reliable lad I never knew. He was a member of the Sorell Detachment
“D Company First Battalion, Tasmanian Infantry Regiment, and was
always regular at drill. He tried to get a place in some of the earlier
contingents. He was born in Hobart about 20 years ago, but of his
parents I can say nothing. He was such a really good lad that I would
have kept his place for him for any length of time. The memorial to
Cundy and Hodgman was erected by the members of the contingent to
which they belonged.—l am, yours faithfully,

out under Captain Morrisby in April, 1902. Our young hero was too late
to see any active service, and died just before reaching home on August
2nd, 1902, the same day as his comrade, C. Cundy. His friends do not
wish to say any more of him than that he was a healthy-minded, clean-living
country lad, who did what he conceived to be his duty.
Tasmania’s National Memorial.
TO HER FALLEN SOLDIERS.
The following is taken from the “Mercury” of July sth, 1901 : —Shortly
after noon the crowd began to gather about the conspicuous spots on the
Queen’s Domain where the stones mark Tasmania’s reverence of the
memory of the soldiers who went out with her contingents, and fell nobly
fighting in the ranks of the British forces in South Africa. The base only
of the monument, of course, is in position at the present time. The site is
the slope a little above the junction of the Domain Road and the road to the
Cricket Ground, and contiguous to the obelisk and drinking fountain
standing to the memory of the late Charles Meredith. It overlooks the
harbour and the city, and no visitor to the Domain who has eyes to see will
pass without observing the memorial. The stone is grey granite, and was
appropriately brought from an Australian quarry, that at Harcourt, in
Victoria. It is firmly based on a wide bed of concrete. The stone, which
was to be set in position in the Royal presence, was one and a half tons
weight, and the face towards the harbour was polished, and bore the
inscription:—“ This memorial stone was laid by H.R.H. the Duke of
Cornwall and York on the 4th July, 1901,” in plain block letters. It is
generally understood that a fine equestrian figure will form the principal
part of the memorial. The assembling crowd seemed to be thoronghlv
impressed with the solemnity of the occasion. Rank above rank they
quietly thronged the hillside, and conversed in subdued tones about the
occasion of their being brought together. The men whose memory the
monument will perpetuate were known to many, and the personal qualities
of the brave departed and the story of how they died making the supreme
sacrifice for home and country, formed the subject of general converse.
The Tasmanian troops, some of whom had marched side by side with
the fallen ones were drawn up in a semi-circular array in front of the stone.
The soldiers wore crape on their arms, and many of the civilians present
also wore tokens of mourning. Colonel Legge (Commandant) and the
officers of his mounted staff, had formed an appropriate group in the
vicinity of the stone. Behind them was a stand for privileged spectators.
The names of those who fell, inscribed on parchment and placed in an
hermetically sealed box, were laid in the foundation, as well as newspapers
containing announcements of events, viz., the first meeting held
in connection with the erection of the monument, the death of the Queen,
accession of King Edward VII., arrival of the Duke and Duchess of
Cornwall and York in Australia, and the names of the executive committee
and others who took part in the work of having the memorial erected.

THE EAST ROLL CALL.


5H p
Cheering from the outskirts of the crowd announced the arrival of the
Royal party in carriages, following in the customary order of procedure,
including the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York and suite, the
Governor-General (Lord Hopetoun), Lady Hopetoun, and staff, the
Administrator (Sir John Dodds, K.C.M.G.), Lady Dodds, and Mr. Warren
Dodds (private secretary).
When the Duke and Duchess stepped from their carriages the military
presented arms, but his Royal Highness, observing that the men remained
at the present, requested the officers in charge to give the word “shoulder.'’
This having been done, and several formal presentations having been made,
his Royal Highness received from Mr. Alan Walker, the architect for the
structure, the silver trowel and the mallet with which the stone was to be
laid. The trowel is one of the most unique that has yet been presented to
his Royal Highness. It takes the form of the map of Tasmania, and as far
as harbours, bays, rivers, etc., are concerned, is strictly correct. The
trowel is of sterling silver, and the handle of rich Tasmanian blackwood,
with the Ducal crown on the top. The mallet is also quite as unique and
original, taking, as it does, the exact shape and form of the blue-gum seed,
or capsule. Mr. Alan Walker was the designer of both the trowel and
mallet. A rich Morocco case contains the trowel and mallet, which is the
gift of Messrs. W. Golding and Sons to the committee.
Mr. Bernard Shaw, president of the committee, then requested his
Royal Highness to lay the stone, at the same time giving him some
particulars of the object for which they had assembled, and mentioning that
nearly iiooo had already been collected towards the memorial.
Rev. J. B. Woollnough, chaplain to the Defence Force, read a prayer.
His Royal Highness, in laying the foundation stone, said
“I declare this stone to be well and truly laid. We are met together
to do honour to our gallant brothers who have fallen in South Africa, and it

is with great satisfaction that I have laid the firT stone of a national tribute
to their memory. Tasmania has, indeed, every reason to be proud of the
services which she has rendered to the Empire, for nearly 600 officers and
men have left their island for the war, and this force enjoys the
honourable and unique distinction of having gained the first two
Victoria crosses bestowed upon members of the colonial corps durirg
the campaign. But out of this splendid muster which I have
quoted, sixteen, alas, have not returned, and it is to perpetuate their
memory that we are here assembled, and I am sure you will join with
me in offering our heartfelt sympathy with those who, in them, have lost
their dearest and best. Such memorials as that which will rise from this
spot are not only tributes to the dead. Is not each one a testimony to that
living spirit of pride of race. Is it not this sentiment which has given, yes,
and will give again, your brave contingents, and has made even death easy
to their gallant comrades, whose names will be engraven, not only on the
monument you raise, but in the hearts of their loving fellow countrymen,
of pride of a common heritage, and of a fixed resolve to join in maintaining
that heritage which sentiment, irresistible in its power has imposed, and
united the people of this vast Empire.”
Amongst those present at the ceremony were the Premier (Mr. N. E.
Lewis), the Chief Secretary (Mr. G. T. Collins), the Treasurer (Mr. B. S.
Bird), the Minister of Lands (Mr. E. Mulcahy), Dr. M‘Call, Sir Phillip
Fysh, Mr. R. C. Patterson, the Bishop of Tasmania, Dean Kite, Mr. G.
Richardson (Commissioner of Police), Judge MTntyre, Mr. H. E. Packer.
The members of the executive committee in attendance, Mr. B. Shaw
(chairman), Mr. P. S. Seager (treasurer), Messrs. E. Hawson, W. H.
Dawson, A. J. Nettlefold, W. H. Hudspeth, and A. Morton (hon.
secretaries), were presented to H.R.H. the Duke of York.
His Roval Highness the Duke of York afterwards made an inspection
of the assembled troops.
Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall and York received from
Mrs. Lewis, wife of the Premier, a handsome bouquet of white flowers, and
Miss Youl, sister to Mrs. Lewis, presented a similar bouquet to the
Countess of Hopetoun.
The party then drove off to witness the axemen's contest, and the
gathering dispersed.

ROM Mr. J. L. Coombe’s interesting lecture I quote the following
(30th January, 1902). On New Year’s Eve, at Barkly East, when
the shirts were issued, we put our heads together and burst forth
into song to the tune of “Just One Girl”:—
There’s a shirt in each Tassie’s division,
Only one ! Only one !
We don’t want clothes is Teddie’s decision,
Our time’s done, nearly done;
We are climbing cold kopjes at daybreak,
All in rags, all in rags;
Some of us make ourselves tunics,
Out of old oat bags.
(Chorus.)
Just one shirt! only just one shirt!
There are others, I know, but they’re stiff with dirt;
Sun or rain, we are just the same,
We’ll be frowsy for ever with just one shirt!
The poet adds, And two more verses, which, we fear, are lost to
literature.


MEDICAL AND OTHER PAPERS.
Dr. B. Crowther’s Notes.
During my early connection with the South African war, I was
attached as medical officer to the 4th Battalion, Mounted Infantry (having
in addition the sth and 6th Lancers, 18th and 19th Hussars, Royal
Dragoons; in all some 1500 troops under my charge at Middelburg,
Transvaal). The daily visiting of these, in scattered camps, occupied some
hours of riding, and from 60 to 80 patients were daily seen in special tents
furnished for the purpose. In addition to attending troops, the sanitary
and hygienic arrangements of camps had to be seen to, and every detail
appertaining to the same reported on, and sent weekly to senior medical
officer. The diseases were of ordinary kind, the historic veldt sore being
much in evidence, due, it is supposed, to an insect of the bug family, which
burrows in the skin, causing ulcer of same, with enlargement extension,
making difficult to heal. Wounds for this reason are long healing. At
the hospitals, both brick (many churches being commandeered for this
purpose) and canvas, much surgery was one's constant lot to see, and at the
time, some 60 of severe wounds (bullets in some cases passing through
body without serious complication), compound fractures, etc., were of great
interest; for, in many cases, so urgent were they, that it seemed impossible
to save limbs ; but careful removal of bone fragments, draining, and strict
antiseptic, with splinting, made excellent limbs (which our forefathers, or
even in more recent years, would have amputated). After three months
of the above work our battalion was ordered on trek, and a different class of
disease from unavoidable causes resulted, chiefly diarrhoea, dysentery,
fever, bad skin affections, etc., were daily seen. Much depended on water
(which was supposed to be filtered or boiled). Birkbank filters, ordered for
all camps, were not always available, and wood being scarce, boiling was
out of the question. The sanitary position and water supply of troops
when marching was uncertain; and although the water and latrines were
■especially located and ordered, Tommy drank water and defecated
anywhere, and much of the fever arose from same; also flies conveying
contagion to food. I once saw meat safe in station left open, meat being
covered white with lime, which flies had brought from resting on white-
washed latrine. In this way fever is introduced, from fecal matter to food.
The South African fly, of blue metallic hue, is very active, and has entered
largely into spread of disease here. Water also, through contamination
with dead stock (often found in spruit), from near which camp water was
drawn. Much of the tin, or bully beef, so called, had from time to time to
be condemned, and doubtless contributed to gastric affection. The want,
also, of underclothes and soap, in the latter part of the campaign, with Fifth
and Sixth West Australians (I was medical officer to) was very bad, and
much skin affection resulted, as also from the horse blankets (which in
forced marches was used as under blanket for soldiers; the horses being
lousy conveyed same to men). In many cases one coat and trousers were
the dress, and I have often seen the men washing same, and remaining in
tent till dry. The great heat of summer soon affected us. The teeth also


(from absence of lime in water, and unsuitable food) was a serious matter;
and many coming to South Africa with good sets, lost most of same in a
year or so; in spite of the liberal treatment of the Imperial authorities in
sending out special dentists. In this way many were invalided home,
unable to get necessary nourishment through teeth bad. It is remarkable
that venomous reptiles do not more largely contribute to disease, for the
scorpions are enormous and numerous, and I have frequently killed same
around the bed on the ground. Snakes, also; I know of one of our officers
in the Fifth and Sixth West Australians sleeping on same, which had
crawled under his coat, used as pillow, and crushed from pressure of
shoulder, which measured three feet.

The Fight at Night System-
THE BRAKENLAAGTE DISASTER.
As illustrating the new Boer system of carrying on the campaign, the
following extract from a letter written by Lieut. Murray, son of Mr. K. L.
Murray, formerly of the Railway Department, is extremely interestng:—
Reitkuil, October 21. —Another rest day after a long night march, and
the hottest fight I have yet taken part in. About 800 Boers had laid a trap
for us, expecting us to night march on to them. We went in another
direction, however, and after riding all night and taking a few prisoners,
we halted for breakfast. From our prisoners we heard dark hints of the
Boers massing to cut up Benson. They were going to teach him to “fight
at night," as they termed it. From our halting place we could see
hundreds of men round us, and expected a good rearguard action directly
we started to retire. The Boers were awfully cunning. As an example:
There was a big lot of men ahead, riding like our mounted infantry. So
like were they that two of our M.I. galloped up to them. This encouraged
the Boers, and to try and further deceive us, they rode away over the sky
line, taking our two men with them, and fired shots away from us. They
then galloped back towards us, and stopped when they got over the hill,
just as if they were our men and had been driven back. They halted there,
expecting, doubtless, that more of us would go over to them. Colonel
Benson, however, knew too much; none of us moved, and presently they
became impatient, and opened fire on us. Our breakfast was finished to
the accompaniment of 15-pounders, pom-pom, and rifle fire. About 8.30
a.m. we started to retire to this camp. I was with the advance guard.
On both flanks, rear, and guns from the hills a tremendously hot fire was
kept up. No mistake, this commando must be the pick of the Boer army.
They fought magnificently. As our rear or flank guards retired from
ridge to ridge they would gallop up and shoot like Old Nick. The rattle
of the ping pongs was tremendous, varied by the crash of the 15-pounders


and the pom-poms. One man, mounted on a fine black horse, was firing
a Martini as he galloped about, and the puffs of smoke were most
conspicuous in the almost unclouded air. Nowadays the absence of smoke
from all kinds of firearms, the absence of a visible enemy, the sound only
of the explosion and of the “zip” of the bullet forms one of the most ner\e-
trying parts of warfare. The two regiments of M.I. fought splendidly
under great difficulties. They had a good many casualties, the doctor
of the 25th being killed. Poor chap, he had only been ten days
in the country; and several men are expected to die. We don’t
know what damage we did the enemy. Their hospital waggon
took one of our officers, who was hit. Colonel Townsend, P.M.0.,
has gone out with one of our ambulance waggons, to see if the Boers will
give him any of our wounded they may have. Townsend went to them
before, to try to get the two men who galloped innocently into the Boer
ranks. One was the doctor, and was shot dead. The Boers took
Townsend’s horse, and threatened to keep him, too, delaying the waggon
for about two hours while they collected their men together to attack us as
we retired. Colonel Townsend told me that they are just the same dirty-
looking men as those we take. We reached camp about 2 o'clock, and I
slept all the afternoon.
October 30. —Never to be forgotten Brakenlaagte. I have just seen
poor Lindsay buried, with Colonel Benson, Colonel Guiness, Captain Ayre
Lloyd, and Captain Inglis. There are many others to be covered up.
You will have heard of this great disaster long before you get my letter,
and I hope they put me down as “very slightly wounded.” Of all the
officers who held that ridge against vastly overpowering numbers I am
the only one able to attend the funeral. I will try and tell you some-
thing of the fight from the first.
We started at 5.30 yesterday morning, expecting a lot of fighting,
as we knew the Boers were massing to cut us up. We were at the head
of the column, and all went well till we reached this place. \\ e were
suddenly ordered to the rear, and occupied a ridge, where we had a severe
rifle fire on us, which increased every minute. My men were falling all
round as we retired from ridge to ridge. At last we reached the one the
guns were on, and poor Lindsay said, “Now, Murray, we’ll make a stand
here.” It was a very bad position, but we couldn't leave two 15-pounders.
So I left my horse, then shot in four places, and got the men into firing
line. The position was such that we couldn’t see the enemy after they
had galloped down the slope from the last ridge until they were within
40 yards. They poured on with the greatest daring, the leaders walking
slowly at the head of their horses, waving on their men with carbines or
short whips. The men ran from ant hill to ant hill, and kept up a fire
which only Magersfontein could have equalled. We stayed desperately
and fired away. At one time I had a regular duel with a man leading
a grey horse, and who walked up that slope as if going to a picnic and
was tired. I fired at him and the bullet must have gone close, for he
looked round, saw me, and fired at me. I heard his bullet, and let go
MEDICAL AND OTHER PAPERS -


again and again; he was aiming at me for his third shot when mine went,
and he fell. I cannot say whether I hit him or not, as the fire was terrific.
When he fell I looked round, saw the Boers swarming on our flank as
thickly as in front, and felt that all was over. I said good-bye to everyone,
and thought a prayer for all my dear ones. Just then I saw Lindsay clutch
at his breast and collapse. Finns, on my left, rolled over in convulsive
struggles. Men all round were giving half jumps into the air and rolling
over, some with screams and groans; but all who could fought on. I felt
a bullet go through my clothes, and burn me, as it seemed. So severe
was the shock it almost knocked me over. But the end was not yet.
For what seemed like an eternity the desperate men fought on. All the
gun horses were shot. The gunners twice fired before they were killed
—like everyone else, they simply died at their posts. Then an expansive
bullet struck my legging, spread out and tore a hole in my right calf. The
shock was wonderful.
I suppose I fainted, for I do not know anything that happened after-
wards until I heard a voice saying, “Are you badly wounded?” and, looking
round, after getting up on my knees, I saw a young Dutchman stripping
a wounded man. I strove to think out the position, and in a minute or
two I struggled to my feet. My hat, spurs, carbine (one I took from a
Dutchman at Tantesberg), bandolier, revolver, and belts were gone. Seeing
a man riding about, I hobbled up to him, and asked him if he were the
commandant. Tie was civil, and when I said I would like to look after
the wounded, he said he would see I was not interfered with; he promised
also that he would try to keep his men within bounds and stop the looting
and undressing of wounded. Then he remarked, “Your colonel. General
Benson, is wounded badly,” and pointed out the colonel leaning on his
arm. I went over and asked him if he was badly hit, and he said, “Yes,
in the leg and through the stomach.” He looked awful, and I felt that
there was no hope for him.
Then I went to find Lindsay. There he was just as he fell, stone
dead. I had a great love for Lindsay; he was the truest gentleman I ever
met in South Africa. I felt for him more affection and admiration than ]
thought one man could feel for another. I had been closely associated
with him in many a tight corner, and had penetrated beneath a veneer
of mannerism to know the true hearted, kindly gentleman he was. I can-
not say what I felt when I knew that I could do nothing for him.
Lieutenant Woodman was groaning a few yards away, so I went to him
and gave him some water and put my coat under his head. Then I found
poor Inglis shot through the forehead. And so on I went. I found a man
of the R.A.M.C. How he got there I don’t know, but he and I went
about with water from one to another of the wounded—British or Boer.
I was hobbling painfully down the far side of the ridge, among the hail of
shell fire, and dropping bullets from our own people, who were still holding
the much stronger position where the cannon was, and throwing up
trenches. Then I only had a towel to wet and bring from the water to dak
foreheads, etc. (I had given my water bottle to the man, who was able to


go easily about from one to another, giving each a mouthful), when I met
one of our officers, Lieutenant Wardrope, walking about in a dazed state.
He had been shot through arm and shoulder. He was trying to get to a
farm near by. A Boer rode past us with half a dozen water bottles that
he had taken from dead and wounded. I asked him for one to take water
back to men crying for it. He replied, “Oh, yes, I'll give you plenty water
bottles,’’ and cantered away. The brute! This decided me. I was not
much good limping about with a wet rag, and didn’t like to leave Wardrope,
who was very helpless, so I went with him to the farmhouse, and there found
a Boer picket, who stripped us of everything we had on any good, and gave
us in return some filthy rags. One vagabond was quite humorous. He
wanted my leggings, and said, “I have a heart, and am civilised. I would
not take anything from you that you would not give me; but I ask you,
from your heart, will you give me your leggings.” He said this and much
more of the same kind in broken English, with his hand on his heart and
many gestures of face, etc. I told him he would have to take them off,
which he did. There was a great ragged hole'in one, caused by the
explosive bullet. I got some water and washed the wound, which looks
much worse than it really is. It is a sort of trench across the calf, about
3l4in. long by ij/Hn. wide and lin. deep, in about the best place I could
get such a wound. This picket kept us all night huddled in a small mud
room, with sheets of galvanised iron as roof. Bad as it was, we were
lucky to be there, as a tremendous thunderstorm burst over the place, and
the rain poured in torrents. Imagine the poor wounded fellows out all
night lying exposed to it all.
With the first signs of dawn we got out, and found the Boers had left,
so we started to struggle into camp —very sparsely clad, no boots. There
were eight of us altogether, three wounded, viz., Wardrope in arm and
shoulder, a private of the M.I. shot through the thigh, and myself: also two
officers —one Mounted Infantry and one Buffs —and three men of the Buffs
who had been made prisoners. One of the men rigged up a white flag so
that we should not be fired on by our pickets. But, oh, the scene on the
battlefield. The Dutch were not only robbing wounded of valuables, but
of clothes; also the dead. I saw myself poor Lindsay’s breeches and
drawers pulled off, and most of the dead were stripped quite naked.
It was an awful sight when the sun broke through the mist and shone
on the green ridge to see the white glistening bodies lying dotted about on
the green grass, and where the guns had been a white patch formed
of the naked bodies of the many poor fellows who fought their last fight
there. Major Murray was there, shot through the forehead and stomach;
Captain Lindsay, through heart and right breast; Captain Inglis, through
head, and so on, all dead, and all stripped naked by these savage brigands,
who have been sympathised with and praised by people who ought to know
better, even in Melbourne. Lieut. Kelly was so riddled with bullets that
his clothes were not worth taking; they were left on him therefore. Of the
nine Scottish Horse officers who had fought there all were hit, five fatally,
viz., Major Murray, Capt. Lindsay, Capt. Inglis, and Lieuts. Woodman and


Kelly; and four who will most likely recover, viz., Lieutenants Finns, A A ard-
rope, and Campbell, and myself.
Directly we got to camp I found that Colonel Benson had died, and
that Colonel Woods Sampson had assumed command, so I reported to him
as fit to take a trench in the anticipated fight. He was extremely kind and
considerate; was very pleased to see me, and spoke of the magnificent \v ay
the Scottish Horse had behaved. He would not hear of me taking duty
just then, but sent me to have my wounds attended to, with the under-
standing that if any attack was made I was to be allowed to take my place
in the trenches, which were dug all round the camp, and were being
improved all day, as every man who came in said the Boers intended taking
the convoy that night.
It seems that we had been fighting, practically, the whole Boer
Transvaal army. All the prominent Commandants except Ben Viljoen and
Schalk Burger being there—Louis Botha and his brother Christian Botha,
Grobelaar, Trickhardt, Prinsloo, Oppenheim, and Smut, all with their
separate commandoes. Our losses in the Second Scottish Horse were, from
the commencement of the retirement, 70 casualties. Of those who made
the stand at the guns two alone were unwounded. I cannot say for certain
by how many the enemy outnumbered us, but as well as I can ascertain we
had, including artillerymen and Scottish Horse, 85, 60 of whom were
Scottish Horse. The enemy were at least 1000 strong. Some information
makes their number much greater. One Dutchman told me there were
about 700 “at this ridge only,” and, in ordinary Dutch parlance, that means
three times as many, or 1200. However, I think we may safely say from
1000 or 1250. Their casualties were about 60 killed and 130 wounded —an
estimate which came from Commandant Smut.
Ist November.—AVe have three Boer cloumns round us. We managed
to get barbed wire around our trenches, and every preparation made to
resist the expected attack last night. They tried at about 12.30, but were
met with such furious volleys from our trenches, in which all, officers and
men, passed the night, that they retired, and this morning a relieving
column reached us. We leave here to-morrow for Standerton, a station
on the Durban railway, where it crosses the A^aal River. Being senior
officer, owing to the death of all my friends, I am commanding the
regiment.
Brugspruit, 4th November.—We have been travelling all day and
every day since we left Brakenlaagte (pronounced “Barkenlargte”). Our
first orders were to go to Standerton, but the wounded could not bear that
journey, so we came west, and after travelling about 18 miles, Colonel
Barter took our Boer prisoners and the wounded to Springs, a station on
the railway from Elandsfontein, and we came on here. This station is on
the Koomati Poort line, between Pretoria and Middelburg. lam ordered
to the latter town hospital, and leave by the 4 train this afternoon. I have
been getting on all right, not able to get about much, but still able to direct
and command the regiment in all work except actual riding with the men.
We were not troubled by the Boers en route.


Colonel de Lisle’s relief column consisted of 700 mounted men —among
them some South Australians. The officers all called on me. Several I
knew before. They had done over 70 miles in 20 hours to our relief.—
Lord Kitchener knew of the Boers massing for our benefit, and had five
columns ready to assist us, but could not find out exactly where we were.
If only those five columns could have come to Brakenlaagte in time, we
should have heard little more of General Botha and the rest of the Boer
Commandants.
An Army Surgeon’s Views.
DR. CROWTHER RETURNS FROM THE WAR.
After about ten months’ closely packed experience as an army surgeon
in South Africa, Dr. Bingham Crowther has returned to Tasmania, arriving
by the “Pateena yesterday in Launceston, and proceeding to Hobart by the
express. It will be remembered that when the Imperial Government asked
the Commonwealth for the services of four surgeons for the Boer campaign,
Dr. Crowther accepted one of the positions as Tasmania’s representative.
He arrived at Port Elizabeth, South Africa, on April 21 last year, and was
immediately appointed to a composite English body of 500 men, known as
the Fourth Battalion Mounted Infantry. After seeing a fair amount of
service with this section he was, at his own request, transferred to a West
Australian contingent, his intention being to get actual experience of the
relative qualities of English and Colonial troops. Dr. Crowther’s first
movement on again setting up on Tasmanian soil was to walk up the
Cataract Gorge, which, after a leisurely inspection, he pronounced one of
the most refreshing and beautiful sights one might meet in a year of travel.
In the course of his service with the army, Dr. Crowther has seen a
good deal of actual fighting, and has formed some pronounced opinions
upon brother Boer and the country he is being fought for. The Transvaal
he speaks of as a country well worth fighting for, and he talks in almost
glowing terms of its wide expanse and great depth of fertile soil. Its
minerals, of course, come in for expressive encomiums, but the veldt, with
its rich grasses and large arable tracts, where even now the wily Boer can
contrive to raise huge crops of mealies for the sustenance of men and
horses in the field, has appealed largely to the doctor’s admiration. Dr,
Crowther does not intend to return to South Africa himself, as he points
out that the country has its disadvantages, difficult enough, in all conscience,
for the agriculturist to contend with. Tremendous thunderstorms,
accompanied by deluging rains, are frequent during the summer months;
these, and the intervals of fierce heat, make the climate very trying. The
farmer finds the country the chosen haunt of many strange and ruinous
insect pests, and even the herbage at certain seasons is permeated with
a poisonous growth, known as the wild tulip, which has a deadly effect


amongst herds of cattle. But with proper treatment, no doubt, such as
the British Government will be able to facilitate once peace is achieved, and
the conquest complete, these things may be stamped out, and the rich
volcanic soil be got to yield its vegetable riches to the adventurous farmer.
Dr. Crowther traversed great tracts of this often treeless, but well-grassed
area, with the forces under General Bruce Hamilton in his successful drive,
when from 1200 to 1500 Boers were captured in the course of two months.
The battalions often moved only by night, taking the saddle in the dusk, and
riding, with the aid of kaffir guides, across plains, kopjes, and rivers, often
a distance of 60 miles, before halting. Here and there along the route
were evidences of how the Boers had inhabited the vast country and dealt
with its resources prior to the war. Their cultivation of the prolific soil
amounted, in most instances, to the mere scratchings around the house,
raising sufficient cereals for home consumption, storing little, trading less,
exporting none. They appeared to have vegetated in their isolated homes
just as do the kaffirs, whom they affect mightily to despise. Bold fighters
he found them, even to desperate adherence to a lost cause, but stubborn
opponents of progress; even when they saw how foreign capital and
railroads opened up the Rand they stubbornly shut their eyes to its
advantages, and were thus made the tools of the Kruger party in obstructing.
British progress on the Vaal. Active hostilities, thinks Dr. Crowther, will
continue a year at least from the present, and then, perhaps, there may be
another three or four years of guerilla fighting, before what is aimed at, a
complete subjugation of the Boer element, has been achieved. That they
fight well is the one impression which all war news has conveyed to us.
Dr. Crowther, who has been in some hot corners during the course of
General Bruce Hamilton’s advance, says: —“I remember one day a whole
regiment of British filed down through the uneven ways of a large spread
of country shaped like an enormous basin, whose high rim was a ring of
sharp hills, miles in circumference. We had been told of some Boers
refuging in a farmhouse in the bottom of the basin, but on arrival found, as
so often occurs, that the birds had flown. We were preparing to camp at
the place when we saw parties of Boers on horseback galloping over the
hills towards us. We saw them come up over the ridges, and against the
skvline, and then dash down for the shelter of intervening rocks. We
opened fire to keep them off, for though they were only a few scattered
bands we were a compact body, and quite unprotected in our position from
their fire. We blazed at them as they crept nearer, flitting daringly from
rock to rock, risking bullets and all until they got so close around us that we
were obliged to strike out through the cordon in the nearest direction, and
we thought ourselves lucky to escape with a few casualties. The Boer
always fights so, and while there is grass on the veldt to feed his horses and
stock, and while he can continue to grow his mealie patches in remote
quarters of that vast country for his own sustenance, and draw his supplies
of weapons and shot from a quarter not yet understood, the programme will
be one of ambush, chase, and capture to an end, which, though certain,
is bv no means near.” ,


Another Tasmanian Honoured.
FOR GALLANT CONDUCT.
The name of another Tasmanian has been added to the list of those
specially honoured for gallant conduct in the Boer war, that of Quarter-
master-Sergeant Arthur L. Johnstone, second son of the late
William J. Johnstone (of the firm of Johnstone and Wilmot).
Joining the Victorian Imperial Regiment, which was made up of
1000 men, as a trooper, Air. Johnstone quickly passed through the ranks,
and was promoted to Quartermaster-Sergeant. In referring to the stir-
ring incident which earned for the young Tasmanian the Distinguished
Conduct Medal of the King, the “Argus” says; —“Three members of the
Victorian Imperial Regiment, two of whom have been recommended for
promotion, are specially mentioned in an army order, dated headquarters,
Pretoria, June 28, and forwarded to the Defence Department by the
officer commanding the field force, Graaf River, Aberdeen. Sergeant D.
Sandford, Kyneton, has been brought to the notice of the General Com-
manding-in-Chief for his gallantry in extricating a man whose horse had
fallen on him, and bringing him in under heavy fire. The promotion
of Corporal Hewitt to the rank of sergeant, and of Trooper Highland to
that of corporal, has been sanctioned by the General Commanding-in-
Chief in recognition of distinguished gallantry in the field. Corporal
Hewitt, under a heavy fire, entered a farm with Quartermaster-Sergeant
Johnstone, in response to a call for volunteers, and brought out four
armed Boers. Trooper Highland, on the same occasion, though himself
wounded, rode back to cover the retreat of another man. Their promo-
tion, in the event of its acceptance, was to take effect in each case from
the date of the performance of the act. May 13. The ‘Army and Navy
Gazette’ announces that Quartermaster-Sergeant Johnstone, of the
Victorian Imperial Bushmen, whose name is mentioned in connection
with the foregoing, has been granted the Distinguished Conduct Medal
of the King in recognition of gallant conduct during recent operations
in South Africa.” Quartermaster-Sergeant Johnstone, who has returned
to Launceston, hardly expected that the incident would have merited
such an honour.
An Excellent Record.
THE FIRST CONTINGENT'S ENGAGEMENTS.
WAR MEDALS AND CLASPS.
In an army order relating to medals and clasps for service in the
South African war recently issued by the Imperial authorities, it is
stated: —“His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to confirm
the order given by her late Majesty Queen Victoria that a medal will be
struck to commemorate the military operations in South Africa. The


medal, in silver, will, provided the claims are approved by the Com-
mander-in-Chief, be granted to all officers, warrant-officers, non-com-
missioned officers, and men of the British, Indian, and colonial forces,
and to all nurses and nursing sisters who actually served in South Africa
between October n, 1899, and a date to be hereafter fixed; to all troops
stationed in Cape Colony and Natal at the outbreak of hostilities, and to
troops stationed in St. Helena between April 14, 1900, and a date to be
hereafter fixed.”
The medals for the Tasmanians are to be presented at Hobart next
week by the Duke of Cornwall and York, but the clasps, each one
denoting a noteworthy engagement, are to be given at a subsequent date,
as a return has only recently been prepared. In dealing with the first
contingent (which includes the second draft) alone, it will be seen that
they played an important part shortly after the commencement of the
campaign. They assisted in a reconnaissance in force at Jassfontein,
and, in addition to numerous skirmishes, had general engagements, in
order, as follow: —Colesberg district, Karee Kloof, Brandsford, Reit
River, Zand River, Vet River, Vaal River, Germinston (Johannesburg),
Pretoria, Diamond Hill, Belfast, and \ ellefreden. Clasps, however,
are only given for Johannesburg, Diamond Hill, Belfast, Cape Colony,
Orange River State, and Transvaal, and the following explanation is given
in the general orders ;
“A clasp inscribed ‘Johannesburg' will be granted to all troops who,
on May 20, 1900, were north of an east and west line through Klip River
station (exclusive), and east of a north and south line through Krngers-
dorp station.
“A clasp inscribed ‘Diamond Hill’ will be granted to all troops who,
on June 11 or 12, 1900, were east of a north and south line drawn through
Silverton Siding, and north of an east and west line through Vlakfont.
“A clasp inscribed ‘Belfast’ will be granted to all troops who, on
August 26 and 27, 1900, were east of a north and south line drawn
through Wonderfontein (the garrison and troops quartered at Wonder-
fontein on those dates will not receive the clasp), and west of a north
and south line through Dalmanutha station, and north of an east and
west line through Dalmanutha station.
“A clasp inscribed ‘Cape Colony’ will be granted to all troops in Cape
Colony at any time between October 11, 1899, and a date to be hereafter
fixed, who receive no clasp for an action already specified in the ‘Cape
Colony’ nor the ‘Natal’ clasp.
“A clasp inscribed ‘Orange Free State’ will be granted to all troops
in Orange River Colony at any time between February 28, 1900, and a
date to be hereafter fixed, who receive no clasp which has been already
specified for an action in the Orange River Colony.
“A clasp inscribed ‘Transvaal’ will be granted to all troops in the
Transvaal at any time between May 24, 1900, and a date to be hereafter
fixed, who receive no clasp for an action in the Transvaal which have
been already specified.”

There are, of course, numerous other clasps for engagements in
which the Tasmanians did not take part. There is a total of 467 clasps
for the 126 men of the First Contingent, made up as follows:—51 men,
5 clasps each; 16, 4 each; 37, 3 each; 15, 2 each; 7, 1 each. The strength
of the Contingent for each was as follows:—Cape Colony, 125 men;
Johannesburg, 74; Diamond Hill, 66; Belfast, 75; Orange Free State, 118;
Transvaal, 8.
The following is a complete list, enumerating, as well as those who
have returned hale and hearty, the names of the men who have been
killed in action, died of their wounds, taken prisoners, or invalided at
various times during the campaign:—

Imperial Tasmanian Bushmen.
PRESENTATION OF MEDALS.
BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR.
The members of the First and Second Imperial Tasmanian Bushmen
who saw service in the late South African war received their medals
and clasps at the hands of his Excellency the Governor (Sir Arthur
Havelock) on the 20th inst. The presentation of the medals was
undertaken by his Excellency the State Governor at the request of his
Excellency the Governor-General (Lord Tennyson), who presides over
the Defence Force of Australia, the force being now under the immediate
control of the Federal Government. Ten members of the First Imperial
Bushmen who went to South Africa under Major R. C. Lewis, D.5.0., and
forty-one who went to the war with the Second Tasmanian Bushmen under
Lieut.-Colonel E. T. Watchorn, C.8., received medals and clasps.


The weather was inclement. The morning broke cold, gloomy, and
rainy, and though by 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when preparations for
the day’s function began in the Queen’s Domain, the rain had ceased for
some time, the weather was still cold and cheerless. The ceremony took
place in the Domain in front of the Queen’s Battery, and as may be
supposed, after heavy rain had fallen, the ground was wet, and in some
places muddy. Those who were able to “keep off the grass” did so
without warning. Fortunately, at what the military men called “the
saluting base,” where the proceedings took place, there was a space of
ground without grass, and upon this as many as were permitted assembled.
But the great bulk of the civilian spectators, who numbered altogether
about 500, were assembled on the grass on either side of the Battery, and
a favoured few occupied the hillocks within the Battery itself. Many
came early—say, at 2.30 or 2.40 —and though by that means they may
have secured good positions from which to see what passed, they had the
disadvantage of a long wait. It had been announced that the function
would take place at 3, but his Excellency the Governor, no doubt by
arrangement, did not arrive till half-past 3, at which hour the proceedings
began.
Had the weather been fine the function would have been altogether
a pleasant and impressive one. But standing in the open-air in cold weather
in an unsheltered place does not promote comfort, and under such
conditions people are likely to become selfish and impatient. Perhaps
this is why not a single cheer was raised throughout the whole proceed-
ings. Besides the men who were to receive medals 176 members of the
Rifle Regiment, the Artillery, and the Cadets were on the ground under
the immediate command of Lieut.-Colonel Evans, and the khaki, red, and
dark blue uniforms harmonised nicely. The men who were to receive
medals assembled at first within the Battery fence, but joined their
comrades of the Garrison when the latter arrived. Two or three of the
returned Bushmen were in civilian’s clothes.
A low platform was placed upon the ground in front of the Battery,
and upon this a table bearing the. medals. His Excellency, who drove
to the spot, was accompanied by Lady Havelock and Captain Gaskell,
A.D.C. He alighted at the platform, and then the carriage was driven
round to a spot between the Battery and the platform, from which Lady
Havelock could see the function of the day without leaving her carriage.
His Excellency was received by Lieutenant-Colonel E. T. Wallack, C.8.,
the Acting Commandant, who remained in attendance upon the Governor
during the function. The names of the men as they were presented to the
Governor were announced by Captain Perceval, one of the staff officers,
who also handed the medals to the Governor. On either side of the plat-
form officers of the Defence Force were gathered, with just one Army
Chaplain among them. A curious feature was the number of policemen
upon the ground. There were no fewer than 20 footmen and two
troopers present —about one-half the whole Hobart force. The men were
under the direction of Superintendent Cook and Sub-Inspector Kemp.


Among those present were the Hon. W. B. Propsting, Premier; the Hon.
Dr. McCall, Chief Secretary; the Hon. C. Lyne, Minister of Lands and
Works; the Hon. Nicholas Brown, M.H.A.; Mr. Justice Mclntyre; Mr.
G. Richardson, Commissioner of Police; Colonel Warner, Mr. C. J.
Mackenzie, Mr. B. Shaw, P.M.; Alderman W. Smith, Mr. W. O. Wise,
Secretary to the Law Department; Mr. D. W. Addison, Secretary to the
Premier; and Dr. B. Crowther.
On the arrival of the Governor and party the Headquarters’ Band
played the National Anthem, and, of course, the military saluted. The
Governor then inspected the troops paraded. The men who were to
receive medals carried no arms. Before proceeding to present the
medals,
His Excellency the Governor delivered a brief address. He said he
was proud to comply with the request of His Excellency the Governor-
General, to present the medals. He congratulated the officers and men on
receiving, in the presence of their comrades and friends, that mark of their
Sovereign’s recognition of their attachment to the Throne and the Empire.
The medal would serve as a memorial of the patriotism and courage which
had moved them, men of Tasmania, to fight in a distant land for the
cause of the great nation to which they belonged. It testified to the deep
devotion to their glorious flag which inspired them in common with all
true Britons. They were proud to have won that distinction, and Tas-
mania was proud of them. (Applause).
The officers and men who were to receive medals and clasps then
approached His Excellency one by one and saluted. The Governor
handed his medal to each, and cordially shook him by the hand. It was a
matter for satisfaction that among the 51 who received medals, the
Victoria Cross and the Distinguished Service Order were represented.
The following are those to whom medals and clasps were presented:—

The Australian Contingents.
WHAT EACH COLONY FURNISHED.
OVER 14,800 MEN SENT TO AFRICA.
Sir J. Forrest, Minister of Defence, has had an interesting return
prepared giving particulars of the contingents sent to South Africa by the
whole of Australasia since 1899. By careful calculation it has been shown
in this return that the lands under the Southern Cross sent .324, or nearly
one man in every 300 of population. On a proportionate population basis
Western Australia heads the list of the seven States, as she sent 923 men
from a community numbering 182,553 persons, viz., .505, or one man in
every 200, while Victoria has the lowest percentage, viz., .203. New South
Wales comes first in numbers with 4756 men; New Zealand next with
3003 men, and Victoria third with 2445. Altogether Australasia has sent
14,806 men and 12,112 horses to South Africa, of whom 7527 men are still
serving at the front, 3856 have returned, and 307 were killed in various
ways. The following is the full return: —
The dates to which this return is made up are; —New South Wales,
17th; Victoria, 4th; Queensland, Bth; South Australia, 14th June; Western
Australia, 29th May; Tasmania, 6th June; New Zealand, 26th June, oi
the present year.
The return also shows that three Victorians and one Tasmanian
obtained commissions in the Imperial army, that 28 Westralians joined the
South African Police, and that 51 Queenslanders were discharged in South
Africa. i i 1


National Anthem
OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE.
The following copy of the anthem, which was composed in 1880, has
been forwarded by Trooper G. White, of the Tasmanian Bushmen: —
I.
Burghers, push the cause of freedom on,
And sing our national welfare.
Free from foreign oppression,
That in our small Republic
Law, order, and right may rank
Foremost in the State,
Foremost in the State.
11.
Although our country has a small beginning,
We enter the future without fear,
Trusting in God, who is always near;
He who never repels them who on Him build,
And does not for the strongest steam yield.
And does not for the strongest steam yield.
HI.
Prosperity to our beloved country,
The people, the President, the road,
Yes, prosper to our song,
The Free State and her throng,
In great deeds and free from home,
For centuries to come,
For centuries to come.
This is probably a somewhat literal translation and halts rather
badly.

HE materials of this chapter are wholly taken from the “Daily
Telegraph,’’ Launceston. This will account for the “northern”
nature of many references, especially the church services. It is
scarcely necessary to say that had Hobart papers been available
on the same generous terms, the items pertinent to the occasion
would have referred more exclusively to the capital. Few of my
readers are probably aware that back numbers of newspapers are
generally a shilling per copy for each year backwards, that is to say, a ten
year old “Mercury” costs ten shillings for a single copy, while last year’s
copy is a shilling.
The “Diary of the War” will be found useful as affording at a glance
the main features and dates; as also the order of the departure of the
Contingents kindly furnished by Captain Perceval.
THE “DAILY TELEGRAPH,” TASMANIA.
TUESDAY, JUNE 3, 1902.
“No more welcome news has reached Tasmania for many a day than
the Governor-General’s announcement of the proclamation of peace in
South Africa. The reception accorded to the information, which was by
happy arrangement committed to the care of his Excellency for circulation
throughout the Commonwealth, showed how glad the inhabitants of this
small portion of King Edward’s dominions were to hear that the negoti-
ations between the British Government and military authorities and the


Boer leaders ended in a decision on the part of both the victors and the
vanquished to stop the war, and also in their agreement to terms and
conditions for the future peace, order, and good government of South
Africa. During the past two and a half years there were several occasions
when the whole Empire joined in enthusiastic demonstrations of joy over
the triumph of British arms. But it may be safely said that boisterous,
appropriate, and impressive as those national celebrations were, the
rejoicing over the signing of the treaty of peace which began yesterday
and will be continued to-day are not less worthy of the British people. On
those occasions our gladness was marred by the thought that they were
stages in the long and bloody campaign, and that more valuable lives
would be lost before the end could be reached. Now we are able to show
the world that although when driven into war we are still capable of
upholding the honour and prestige of the nation whose deeds on land and
sea have for centuries secured for it the respectful consideration of other
powers, that whilst we are by nature a warlike people, still peace is
precious to us, and that its arrival in honourable form is balm for our
reverses and more in harmony with our desires than the prospect of
additions to the longer list of our victories. Thrilling as the readiness of
the Empire to respond to the trumpet call to arms was, the chimes of the
bells of peace and the uplifting of the song of thanksgiving are not less
soul-stirring. Both are essentially characteristic displays of the senti-
ments with which the heart and mind of a great nation must be moved as
the occasion requires. If it is to maintain its greatness a nation must be
great in war and great in peace.
If the Boers and their Dutch sympathisers prove to be reasonable
and loyal citizens of the Empire the task of building up the Commonwealth
of South Africa will be comparatively easy. But too much must not be
expected. It will take a long time, under the most favourable of circum-
stances, to rub off the jagged edges of the past. In the meanwhile we can
afford to rejoice that the end of the war has arrived at last, and while the
amnesty for those who have rendered themselves liable to the pains and
penalties of British law is in the hands of his Majesty the King awaiting
Ins royal signature, it is a pleasing coincidence that peace has come as a
birthday gift to the heir of the throne, who has played a great part in
recent times in the work of uniting the Empire.”
THE ARMY APPRECIATED.
London, Saturday Night. The Government has congratulated
Viscount Kitchener on his energy, skill, and patience in the conduct of
the campaign, and asked him to convey to the troops the Government’s
profound sense of their spirit and endurance in meeting every call, as also
on their bravery in action, their excellent discipline, and the humanity
shown by them throughout a trying period. Viscount Kitchener has re-
plied, sincerely thanking the Government on behalf of the army.

Australia’s Contribution to the Army.
Since the commencement of the war the Australian States have been
steadily sending contingents of men to the front. At first this duty
devolved upon the several States, but the last two contingents have been
dspatched by the Commonwealth Government. An interesting return
has been prepared by the Federal military headquarters’ office, which
shows that Australia and Tasmania have sent in all 16,022 officers and men
and 16,468 horses to South Africa. New South Wales heads the list with
5984 officers and men, and 5785 horses; next comes Victoria, with 3552
officers and men, and 3788 horses; and the figures for the other States are:
—Queensland, 3007 and 3403; South Australia, 1421 and 1534; Western
Australia, 1222 and 1177; Tasmania, 836 and 781.
The number of officers and other ranks killed or who died in South
Africa is shown by the following table: —
Another interesting return shows the number of officers and men sent
to South Africa from the various States of the Commonwealth, also the
population and percentage to population sent from each State, as follows:
Peace Services.
IN MANY CHURCHES.
Throughout the island yesterday “Peace’’ services were held in
churches of almost every denomination. In some of the city churches
reference to the happy conclusion of the Boer war, couched in congratu-
latory terms, were made from the pulpit, whilst in others the whole
PEACE PROCLAIMED.


service, including singing, preaching, and prayers, were made as appro-
priate as possible to the occasion.
CHURCH OF ENGLAND.
At St. John’s, in the morning, special hymns were sung in com-
memoration of the peace, and special prayers and litany were said.
Archdeacon Whitington, the preacher, took his text from the final verse
of Psalm xxix., “The Lord shall give his people the blessing of peace.’’
After the benediction the worshippers sang the National Anthem. Collec-
tions taken up during the day for the church extension fund amounted to
£4O 5s gd.
Full choral services were held at Holy Trinity Church in the morning
and evening, the National Anthem being sung at the conclusion of each
service. Appropriate sermons were delivered by Rev. E. G. Barry.
PRESBYTERIAN.
At Chalmers Church Rev. A. R. Osborn, M.A., preached from Rev.
xxi., 24, making particular reference to the culmination of the struggle in
South Africa. The hymns selected for the service had special reference to
the blessings of peace.
There was a good attendance at St. Andrew’s, the service being bright
and hearty. Amongst the hymns sung was one from church praise, which
contained the very appropriate verse:
“Praise to our God whose bounteous hand
Prepared of old our glorious land
A garden fenced with silver sea.
A people prosperous strong and free.
Praise to our God through all the past
His mighty arm hath held us fast,
Till wars and perils, toils and tears
Have brought the rich and peaceful years.”
Rev. H. Jones, M.A., preached an eloquent sermon from the words in
Psalm xlvi., 9, “He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he
breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder, he burneth the chariot
in the fire.”
METHODIST.
The pulpit at the Patterson-street Methodist Church was occupied by
Rev. J. Haslam, who at the morning service gave an interesting discourse
bearing on the declaration of peace, which, he said, was a proper cause
for rejoicing. He showed that human history was a long story of war,
and he hoped that the end of the South African struggle would be the
beginning of a long reign of peace. Hymns suitable to the occasion were
■sung, and the service concluded with the National Anthem.


At the Ferederick-street Methodist Church last night Rev. A. Madsen
spoke upon “Peace through submission,” and in the course of his address
touched upon the three main principles: That the enemies of the Empire
in South Africa were hostile in heart to British rule; that the longer the
Boers fought the more they lost and stood in jeopardy of entire destruc-
tion ; and that peace came when the Boers surrendered and accepted the
British terms. The speaker went on to show that the Boers were now
members of the British family, and heirs to the national inheritance.
BAPTIST.
At the Baptist Tabernacle yesterday morning a service of thanks-
giving for peace was held. Rev. W. J. Eddy preached a special sermon
from the words, “He maketh wars to cease,” Psalm xlvi., 9. The aim of
the preacher was to justify the war just closed, not only as necessary in
itself, but as a war which would aid in making wars to cease. At the
evening service, Mr. Eddy incidentally mentioned that five young men
from the Tabernacle had been on active service in South Africa, viz.,
Troopers A. Button, J. Elliott, E. Garrott, and D. Crabtree, and Corporal
E. Morgan, the first mentioned having filled a grave on the African veldt.
The subject was continued in the evening, when a number of lantern slides
were shown illustrating the horrors of war and the blessings of peace.
Jackson’s “Te Deum” was rendered by a full chorus at both services.
AT THE CAPITAL.
Hobart, Sunday Night. —Special thanksgiving services were held ac
St. David’s Cathedral this morning in connection with the peace celebra-
tions. The pulpit was draped with the Union Jack, and there was a large
congregation. Special psalms and hymns were sung, and prayers of
thanksgiving were offered. The sermon was preached by Dean Kite, who
took for his text the words, “In everything give thanks.” He said that in
every part of the world where the Union Jack waved similar services were
being held, but in no part were found more loyal subjects than Tasmania,
who had given her best and bravest to the Empire. At the conclusion
of the service the National Anthem was sung. Thanksgiving services were
also held in every church throughout the city.
Jubilation at Hobart.
Hobart, Monday.—Old residents will well remember that it was in
1856 when the lengthy and bloody struggle between Russia and Great
Britain terminated, in other words, the Crimean War, in connection with
which many brave men fought and died in Great Britain’s cause. The
end, however, justified the means, and readers of local history will not
have forgotten with what exultation the glad tidings conveying the wel-
come news of the cessation of hostilities in Britain’s favour was received
throughout the whole length and breadth of the British Empire. In those

clays there was no direct steam communication, no electric cable service,
consequently residents had to be content to receive news from the Old
World when it arrived, and it was only when a long-delayed mail came to
hand that colonists were placed in possession of what had taken place
during the long interval of time. The news that Britain had been victor-
ious in the Crimea was celebrated in Hobart in a manner never previously
witnessed, the chief feature being the display of fireworks in front of what is
now known as the Tasmanian University, the result of which is not likely
to be forgotten by those who saw it. Since then nothing of similar
character has been witnessed in Hobart, with the exception of the few in-
cidents in connection with the South African war, now, it is to be hoped,
at its close. The relief of Mafeking was undoubtedly one of the chief
features in connection with the late war, when people simply went wild
with excitement, and had an opportunity of giving vent to their feelings
of thankfulness ; but it remained for the receipt of to-day’s cablegram from
Mr. Chamberlain announcing the welcome intelligence that the war was
over, to afford citizens scope for a further outburst of excitement. The
opportunity presented itself shortly after 10 o’clock, the announcement
being made public by the firing of five guns from the Queen’s Battery by
the members of the permanent force, and from this out, business for the
day was practically at a standstill.
At noon there was a monster gathering outside the Town Hall. The
Mayor, Aldermen, and Ministers of State, with many public functionaries,
took up a position on the balcony, and delivered addresses. The various
speakers, so far as could be heard, spoke in terms of jubilation at the
termination of hostilities. The Mayor congratulated the State on the
result. He had much to say, but his heart was too full to speak at length.
(Cheers).
Mr. Lewis (Premier), said the long-looked for and long-wished for
news had reached them that morning from Mr. Chamberlain, who had
cabled as follows to Sir A. E. Havelock:—“The representatives of the
Boer forces in the field have accepted the terms of surrender offered by
His Majesty’s Government.” To which Sir A. E. Havelock replied:—
“With reference to your telegram of June I, my Ministers request me to
offer His Majesty’s Government the congratulations of the Government
and people of Tasmania.” (Cheers.) The Chief Justice wrote to the
Premier as follows : —“I have already mentioned the matter to the parties
in Court this morning. They want us to go on, and in view of the fact
that two judges must leave town next Monday it is necessary to finish
the work in hand during the week. We don’t intend sitting to-morrow,
but are going to sit for longer hours on the following days. If you are
going to the demonstration, and think it well to do so, you might mention
that I am sorry to be absent.” The Premier then read the following:—
“His Excellency will be glad if the Premier will say on his behalf that he
rejoices with them on the termination of the war.”
On the receipt of the cablegram from Mr. Chamberlain Mr. Lewis
despatched a message, intimating that, “upon the announcement of the


declaration of peace great rejoicing took place throughout iasmania
consequent upon receipt of welcome news.' Mr. Lewis continuing,
referred to the events of the past two years and upwards, during which
Great Brtaiu had fought a long war, resulting in the loss of many valuable
lives, and the expenditure of large sums of money, with the result that
the world had been shown what determination and strength could over-
come. As the result of the peace negotiations, those who were enemies
yesterday were friends to-day—(cheers)—and under the British flag would
find freedom and toleration. The most regrettable part of all was that of
the 800 Tasmanians who had volunteered for service in South Africa, 21
had died in various ways. | There were more afterwards.] He regarded
the peace negotiations as a most auspcious beginning of the reign of King
Edward VII. Thev had a good right to thank Divine Providence on the
announcement of peace. (Cheers).
The Headquarters' Band played “Rule Britannia,” the words of which
were joined in by thousands of bystanders.
Mr. G. T. Collins (Chief Secretary), in response to calls, said the occa-
sion was one that did not call for a lengthy speech from him. They
should thank Almighty God that peace had been proclaimed. He had
taken a very great part in sending the men from Tasmania to fight the
Boers, always with this hope that peace would soon follow, and that the
time would shortly come about when the enemy would recognise that
under the British flag the Transvaal would be a good place to live in.
(Cheers). He hoped that every church would be opened that day, and
thanks offered up for peace having been proclaimed, and which he
regarded as another step in the direction of Imperial Federation. (Loud
cheers).
The Mayor announced that special services would be held at St.
David’s Cathedral by Dean Kite, and at the Town Hall by Ministers
representing the Council of Churches.
The “National Anthem” and the “Doxology” concluded the proceed-
ings, after which the numerous crowd dispersed, by which time the city
was decorated with bunting, and business became stagnant. People
paraded the streets carrying flags and national colours. At the request
of the Rev. Findlay the Minister of Education granted the State School
children a half holiday, which was followed by most private establishments
of a similar character.
A thanksgiving service in connection with the proclamation of peace
was held at St. David’s Cathedral this afternoon, when the seating accom-
modation was taxed to its utmost, many being content with standing room.
Amongst those present were: —His Excellency the Governor, accom-
panied by Lady Havelock and suite. The military was represented by
the Premier (Mr. N. E. Lewis), Mr. G. T. Collins and Mr. E. Mulcahy.
A large number of military men were also present, including Colonel
Legge, Lieut.-Colonel Wallack, Colonel Warner, and Major Evans.
Service began by the choir, assisted very heartily by the immense congre-

gation singing the “Old Hundredth;” then special thanksgiving prayers
were intoned by Dean Kite, after which the appropriate Psalm, cxxxvi,
was chanted. The lesson selected was from Micah iv., after which th~
Dean ascended the pulpit, which was draped with a large Union Jack, and
delivered an address, which for eloquence and pathos was most intense,
and will leave a lasting impresion on those privileged to hear it. ihe
text was “God is love.” Ihe preacher said that they could fully realise,
as they all knew, that the war was a most just one, being undertaken to
help the oppressed, and make a stand for justice. Ihe citizens of
Tasmania could feel proud of the help they had sent, while there was also a
sad side, that of the 800 men who had gone forth to assist the mother
country over 20 had lain down their lives for it. 1 hey should also feel
specially glad that peace would reign over the Empire and the Coronation
of King Edward VIE The “Te Deum” was then sung, and the service
closed with the “National Anthem” and the “Benediction.”
