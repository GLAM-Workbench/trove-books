NEW SOUTH WALES.
Settlement, Position, and Extent
Discovered by Captain Cook in 1770, and first
settled in 1788, the real history of New South
Wales begins with the 19th century, at about which
time the introduction of Merino sheep—mainly due
to the enterprise of Captain Macarthur —laid the
basis of Australian commerce. In 1851 the
southern districts were formed into the Colony of
Victoria. In 1859 the northern districts were
formed into the Colony of Queensland.
The boundaries are marked by 28° 10 and o» 28
south latitude, and by the 141° east longitude.
The total superficial area is estimated in round
numbers at 200,000,000 acres. The coast line from
Point Danger to Cape Howe is aoout /00 miles
long. The extreme breadth is about 700 miles.
Physical Aspect
There is great diversity of physical aspect in such
a vast extent or country. At a distance varying
from 25 to 120 miles, from the seaboard, a lunge
of mountains, from 8,000 feet to 7,000 feet in
height, stretches from north to south, throwing out


spurs in every direction. Tins mountainous region
forms the watershed of the country. Numerous
streams flow down the eastern slopes into the sea,
while the large rivers, Darling, Lachlan, Murrum-
hidgee, and Murray, with their tributaries, drain
the western slopes. The coast-line is indented with
flue harbours —one of them, Port Jackson, unsur-
passed in the world.
Natural Divisions of the Country.
The natural great divisions of the country, arc tire
eastern seaboard territory, the central range, and
the western plains. The seaboard districts undulate
with hill and valley, and possess on the alluvial flats
the richest soil, adapted to every kind of cultivation.
Much of this portion rests on a vast basin of coal.
The central division is rich in minerals. sooner
are we off the coal areas than we are in a region in
which are tracts abounding with gold, copper, lead,
tin, and other minerals. The extensive plains in the
interior, forming the third great natural division, are
specially adapted for pastoral pursuits. Millions of
sheep and cattle feed there on the natural grasses of
the country.
Climate and Health.
Situated in the temperate zone, with wide plains
in the interior with ranges of lofty hills, and with
its shores washed by the Pacific, the climate of


Tscw South. Wales approximates generally to that of
southern Europe. There are all varieties of climate,
however, to be met with—from frost and snow for
a great part of the year on the higher ranges in the
south, to a tropical though dry heat in the interior.
Along the sea coast the climate is pretty uniform.
The range of the thermometer is much less than in
anv country within the same parallels ot latitude in
the northern hemisphere. The European consti-
tution readily adapts itself to the climate. The air
is clear, the light brilliant, the sky for a great part
of the year almost cloudless, and the nights most
enjoyable. In vital statistics the colony compares
favourably with most parts of the world, and, not
seldom, instances of great longevity are brought to
light.
Increase of Population.
The progress of the population may be seen from
the following figures
In 1841 there were 149,GG9.
In 1851 „ „ 197,108, after giving up 08,335 to I ictona.
In 1801 „ * 358,278, after giving up 25,000 to Queens-
land.
In 1871 „ „ 519,182,
In 1874 M „ 584,278.
At present the population is over 000,000.
The number is steadily increasing at the rate of
1,200 annually for every 30,000 of the inhabitants.
But in such a vast country, abounding in wealth and
resources, there is room for a population of many
millions.


Roads and Railways.
More than 10,000 miles of road are open, afford-
ing free intercommunication with every part of
the country. More than £2,500,000 have been
spent in ten years on common roads alone, and
the work of still further opening up the country is
annually going on. Mail coaches run through
every district.
Railways were first commenced in New South
Wales by a private company. In 1555 the Govern-
ment obtained an Act, which enabled it to pur-
chase the railways and plant of the company, and
railway construction has been carried on by Govern-
ment ever since. The existence of the great central
range delayed the progress of construction by
presenting great engineering difficulties, but these
have been overcome, and lines now cross the raime
' O
north, south, and west. The Great Northern line
starts from Newcastle, and has been opened for more
than 120 miles. It is intended to connect this line
with Queensland on the north and Sydney on the
south, the distance to the latter being about seventy
miles. The Great "Western and the Great Southern
lines both start from Sydney. The former has
been finished to Bathurst, the capital of the west, a
distance of over 110 miles, and will probably bo
carried to the river Darling. The latter through
Goulburn has reached Gunning, a distance, of 165
miles, and will probably before long be extended to


the borders of Victoria and South Australia. The
works are delayed for want of labor, irial survey s
have been completed for many miles south, west,
and north. The Line across the ]Bluc Mountains
to Bathurst ascends to a height oi 8,500 feet, and
descends by means of zig-zags both massive and
ingenious. The rates ot carriage are geneiaby
lower than those of any of the other Australian
•colonies. Agricultural produce, once carried at
bd. a ton per mile, is now carried at
there arc nearly 450 miles of railway open. As
the lines all belong to the State, they promise to
form an ever-increasing source of revenue, and
lessening of taxation to the public. In 1874, on a
total of 400 miles open, the entire earnings were
£530,575, and the working expenses £257,703,
yielding a net return of £278,872, or about 4 per
<7 O #
cent, on the cost of construction.
Post Offices and Telegraphs.
Wherever there is a township there is a post
office, and every village in the farthest interior nas
mail communication. The postage on letters within
Australia is 2d. per \ oz., while all newspapers are
carried free.
There are three separate ocean mails for parts
beyond Australia made up every month, via Torres
Straits, vid Galle, and met San Francisco. The rate
of postage to England is 6d. the half ounce.


Telegraph lines intersect the country in every
direction. There were open in

The number of messages sent were in 1874 —£70,326;.
and in the first half of 1875 —331,362. Telegrams
from all parts of the World are daily published in
the newspapers.
Education.
Education is a department of the State. All
schools supported by the State are under Govern-
ment inspection, and the same course of secular
instruction is adopted in all. The course includes
reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography,
object lessons, singing, drawing, geometry, algebra*
and Latin, with permission to teachers to produce,
if possible, higher results. All the teachers are
examined and certified. Every town and consider-
able village has its State Primary School, and
itinerant teachers are appointed to visit the families
of settlers scattered through the bush. The fee for
tuition is a shilling a week, and where this cannot
be met there is no charge.
O
The University of Sydney was established and
endowed in 1851. Its guaranteed annual income
from public funds is £5,000, and it has the power
of granting degrees in arts, law, and medicine.


Provision is made for Affiliated Colleges of the
four principal religions denominations, with the
guarantee from public funds of half the cost of the
buildings where the denominations have contributed
the other half, and £SOO per annum towards the
salary of each Principal. Under these provisions
three Affiliated Colleges have been erected.
Social Condition.
Nearly all the associations and institutions of
«/
European and American life —social, political, and
religious —have their representatives in the Colony.
Of Journals there are more than a hundred. Every
considerable town, every interest, has its one or more
papers published, once or oftener every week. There
are Banks with branches in almost every township in
the interior. Law holds its sway over all classes,
and is purely and efficiently administered in all its
branches and jurisdictions. Life and property are
secure; the means of living easy and manifold;
wages and profits high ; education is generally
diffused; and the comforts, elegancies, and amuse-
ments of life are varied and numerous.
Trade and Commerce.
New South Wales is advantageously situated for
purposes of trade and commerce. She is not only
the centre of the group of Australasian colonies and
of the islands in the South Pacific, hut looks out

More than one-half of the Australian shipping is
owned here. The inward and outward tonnage of
4,385 vessels engaged in the trade of the colony in
1874 was 1,990,894. In the ten years from 1864
to 1875 inclusive the seaboard trade of New South
Wales amounted to —
The total value of the trade in 1871 amounted

Or in all £23,639,342, with a balance in la\ out of
exports of £1,051,864. These figures exhibit an
import trade of £l9 165., and an export trade of
£2l 12s. 9d. per head of the population, which is
at the rate of more than double the import trade,
and nearly quadruple the export trade of Great
Britain, per head of the population, for the same
year.

The following table exhibits the increase of trade
with population in successive periods :
The revenue has likewise proportionately increased
from £406,056 in 1851, to £4,126,303 in 1875. Of
this amount about £1,000,000 vras obtained from
customs, and £90,000 from licenses. The land
revenue amounted to more than £2,000,000, and the
receipts from the national railways to more than
£500,000. The revenue from taxation is officially
given at £2 Is. Bd. per head of the population for
1874. The tariff, which is established for purposes
of revenue only, is one of the simplest in Australia,
free trade being the avowed policy of the colony.
Riuers and Harbours.
Besides the rivers which flow into the Pacific, and
the mouths of which form harbours available for
trade, there are several harbours along the coast.
The coast line is well lighted from north to south,
and large sums of money are annually spent in
improvements connected with the harbours and


rivers. Storm signals are placed on all the principal
promontories, which, together with the sea-ports, are
connected by means of the electric wire with Sydney.
The following are the principal harbours: —
Trial Bay, midway between Sydney and Queens-
land, is an excellent shelter for all classes
of ships during S. & S. E. gales.
Tort Stephens , 25 miles north of Newcastle,
runs into the country due west for about 14
miles, and has even a larger water area
than Port Jackson.
Newcastle , at the mouth of the Hunter, is the
great coal port of the Colony. Vessels of
2,000 tons burden can load there.
Broken Bay , 16 miles north of Sydney Heads,
at the mouth of the Hawkesbury, is a' fine
harbour, with a bold entrance, but is inferior
to Port Jackson in the draught of water at
the entrance.
Tort JacJcson, unsurpassed in the world, is
separately described below.
Botany Bay , 8 miles south of Sydney, has an
area of 20 square miles, but is shallow.
Jervis Bay , a large and sheltered bay in the
south, is at present mainly resorted to as
a harbour of refuge.
Twofold Bay , in the south, is 5 miles from east
to west, and 3 miles broad.


Besides the above there are Wollongong, Kiama,
Shoalhaven, Ulladulla, and Moruya, small harbours
on the south-east coast, where breakwaters, wharfs,
and jetties, adapted to the coasting trade, have been
constructed.
Sydney and its Harbour.
The magnificent expanse of water called Port
Jackson, with its lake-like scenery, stretching away
for 8 or 10 miles inland, is one of the embellish-
ments of the world. The hold coast fronting the
Pacific is suddenly broken, and the giant cliffs form
a portal to an estuary, with an enormous extent of
shore line, capacious enough to shelter the navies
of the world. So completely is the harbour shut in
that, until an entrance is fairly effected, its capacity
and safety cannot he conjectured. A vessel making
the port sails in a few moments out of the long swell
of the ocean into calm deep water, protected on every
side by high lands. The elevated shore is broken
into innumerable hays and inlets, extending inland
for miles. Some of the hays form of themselves
capacious harbours. The bosom of the whole is
dotted over with picturesque islets, which form no
impediment to navigation. The depth of water is
sufficient for the largest class of ships afloat. The
harbour of Port Jackson proper has an area of 9
square miles, Middle Harbour, one of its arms,
3 square miles, and the shore-line of the whole
is 5J miles. Prom the Heads to the city the


distance is 1 miles, beyond which the waters
extend for 8 miles further. The breadth varies
from three-quarters of a mile to 2 miles or more.
There are nearly 5 miles of Government and private
wharfs.
The greatest length of the city, including the
suburbs, is nearly 4 miles north and south, and
the greatest breadth about 3 miles east and west.
There are more than 120 miles of streets, besides
minor thoroughfares. The population, including the
suburbs, is over 160,000, and the funds dispensed
by the Corporation last year amounted to £IBO,OOO.
The Botanic Gardens, Domain, Hyde Park, Prince
Alfred Park (on which stands the Exhibition Build-
ing), Belmore Gardens, V ictoria Park, and Moore
Park with an area of 500 acres, furnish easily acces-
sible and ornamental grounds for recreation.
Pastoral Wealth and Progress.
New South Wales has justly been reckoned a
peculiarly pastoral country. Probably no other
country in the world can show such advances in
pastoral wealth and resources. Natural pastures,
miles in extent, may be met with all over the colony,
but especially in the western district *, where many
varieties of the fattening salt bush flourish. The
pastoral stock and holdings represent a capital of
£10,000,000, which is annually largely increasing.
The natural grasses alone are sufficient for the feed


of tlie vast flocks and herds. The total area leased
at less than three farthings an acre for pastoral
purposes is nearly 150,000,000 acres. The “ runs”
vary in size from 5,000 acres to 100,000 acres, several
adjacent blocks being often included in one holding.
There are many men in the Colony who began life-
as simple shepherds who have realized wealth and
affluence, while several of the “squatters” possess-
more than a hundred thousand sheep.
Lice Stock.
The fme-woolled sheep of the colony came origin-
ally from the choicest flocks of Prance, Spain, and
Saxony. In the process of acclimatisation there
has been a very decided gain in the softness of the
wool, and an improvement in its elasticity. The
wool has increased in length, but diminished in
density, so that the weight remains the same. The
coarse-woolled sheep are chiefly depastured in the
Coast districts, where they thrive better than the
merinos. Three-year-old wethers of this breed
weiah when killed from IGOibs. to 2001bs. each, but
O
the fine-wooled merinos are of a smaller type and
average about 50fbs. The average of lambing is 80
per cent., and an average clip is about dibs, of
washed wool per sheep.
The principal breeds of horned cattle are Short-
horns, Herefords, and Devons. The finer specimens
will compare with most in England. Agricultural


societies hold yearly exhibitions of stock and pro-
duce in the chief districts of the Colony; and some
specimens at the last Exhibition in Sydney fetched
over 1,000 guineas each. Pleuro-pneumonia has at
times proved very destructive; hut foot and mouth
disease, rinder pest, and other malignant diseases of
cattle, are unknown in New South Wales.
All the best breeds of horses thrive here. Animals
worth £2O here fetch an average of £BO in India.
India draws from New South Wales remounts for
cavalry regiments.
Llamas and alpacas have been naturalised, and
there are several flocks of Angoras. The fleece
forwarded to England has sold for 2s. 6d. a pound,
and the clip weighs sometimes 6 lbs.
The following returns show the progress and
resources of New South Wales in the matter of
live stock: —

In 1874 the value of pastoral exports, including
wool, tallow, shins, salt and preserved meats, and
live stock, exceeded six millions sterling. The value
of the local consumption is in addition to this large
amount.
It will be seen from the above returns how great
is the annual increase in stock of all descriptions,
and how eminently adapted to pastoral purposes are
the vast interior plains of the Colony. Perhaps in
no part of the World do animals thrive and fatten
more readily, or with less cost to the breeder, than
in Australia. On the great salt-hush plains, which
are almost exclusively devoted to the rearing of
stock, the breeder incurs no expense in providing
fodder for the winter, the climate being so mild
throughout the year. Water, the great want of
central Australia, is now being retained at very
considerable expense by the lessees or squatters on
the dry and waterless but splendid grazing lands
lying back from the rivers, and as these become
utilised the increase in the Hocks and herds of the
Colony will continue in the same ratio as heretofore.
As a proof of the very fattening qualities of the
pasturage, it may be stated that both cattle and
sheep, after travelling some ten or twelve hundred
miles to market, are found to produce meat equal
to that of any country in the World. Pedigree
animals have been repeatedly imported from Great
Britain, and year by year, as evidenced by the
increasing number of stock exhibited at the Shows
B


now held throughout the whole of the inland towns
of the Colony, as well as at the Metropolitan Show
in Sydney, it is plainly seen that not only in point
of numbers hut in quality is the live stock of the
Colony progressing.
Agricultural Resources.
There are large tracts of rich soil which are
adapted for profitable cultivation. The law offers
every facility for the acquirement of land. Anyone,
even minors if not under sixteen years of age, can
take up land —the best available —from 40 acres to
640 acres, at 20s. an acre, of which a fourth is to hs
paid down, the remainder hearing 5 per cent, interest.
Another 20s. an acre is to he expended on improve-
ments (a term very liberally construed) during a
period of three years, during which time the
purchaser must also reside. Titles to land once
registered under Torrens’ Act can never be called
in question. The operations of agriculture or
husbandry are never suspended by winter, and crops
of some sort or other may he produced in succession
from January to December. The area of land taken
up for cultivation increases every year. The number
of holdings in 1874 was 35,131, and the area under
cultivation was 464,967 acres. Many poor farmers
who began with small holdings have attained to
wealth and independence. More than 50,000 persons,
or nearly a tenth of the entire population of the
Colony, are connected with agricultural pursuits.


Cereals, Fruits, &c.
The Lest wheat-growing districts arc to he found
on the table-lands from 2,000 feet to 4,000 feet high.
The price in Sydney averages between ss. and 6s.
per bushel.
Tobacco is grown chiefly in the northern coast
districts and in the south-west. The quantity grown
has varied very much from year to year; more than
1,500,0001b5. have been produced in one year.
Maize is raised throughout the coast districts as
far south as the 36th parallel of latitude. The
cultivation is easy, and the crop is soon ready. A
failure is rarely known. The yield on the richer
descriptions of land has been 120 bushels an acre
for the first crop, and 65 bushels an acre afterwards..
The average on the whole crop of the Colony in
1874 was 30 bushels an acre. The market price
in Sydney is between 2s. and 3s. a bushel. Large
quantities are annually exported.
Sugar-cane has only lately begun to be cultivated.
In 1874 there were 8,540 acres under tillage, of
which 4,087 acres produced 6,855 tons of sugar..
The sugar growing districts are on the northern
rivers. The heaviest yield has been nearly 60 tons
of cane an acre, and even 90 tons have been ob-
tained. An average yield is 35 tons, producing
nearly 2\ tons of sugar, besides molasses. The
sorghum or imphee, which has so much of saccharine
matter, thrives well.


The Grape Vine finds a home in numerous
districts, both north and south, and in the interior.
All the finest European varieties are now to he
found in the Colony. There are several large vine-
yards in operation. The yield of wine has averaged
from GOO gallons to 700 gallons per acie, though
certain kinds of grapes have produced over 1,000
gallons per acre.
All the fruits of northern and southern Europe
are grown Avith success. There are orange gioAes
as magnificent as may be seen in Spain or 1 oitugal.
As many as 10,000 oranges have been obtained
from individual trees. Oranges are largely exported
to the neighbouring Colonies, and many proprietors
of orangeries who began life in a very small way have
reaped a fortune. The retail price of common
varieties in Sydney averages a shilling a dozen. The
olive, caper, fig, strawberry, raspberry, gooseberry,
currant, custard-apple, guava, banana, edible nuts,
almonds, passion-fruit, loquat, quince, plum, nec-
tarine, pear, apple, and peach, all thrive.
The potato thrives well, and the yield is large.
Barley, oats, &c., ar© groAvn chiefly for fodder.
Lucerne hay may be cut from four to six times in
the year in fa\ 7 orable seasons on the alluA'ial flats.
Mangold-Avurzel, turnips, and pumpkins arc used for
feeding only the very choicest cattle, native grasses
being sufficient for the rest. ArroAvroot thrives ;
cotton succeeds well on the northern rivers. The


bark of several indigenous acacias is used for tanning
purposes. The rheea (or grass-cloth plant of China)
and the New Zealand flax are grown easily. The
mulberry tree thrives, and the finest varieties of the
silkworm have been introduced with success.

New South Wales abounds in minerals. Accord-
ing to competent authorities, the auriferous districts
of this colony are far larger than those of any
other in Australia, and as rich as the richest, if
not more so. Up to 1871 only alluvial washings
were carried on, and the wealth lying in quartz reefs
was comparatively neglected. And yet, besides
coining millions of pounds sterling in her mint,
she exported gold to the value of £40,095,823.
There were then upwards of 16,000 miners en-
gaged. Since the veins have been worked and
quartz-mining has come into operation, there has
been an extension in this direction apd the results
have, in a few instances, been unexpectedly rich.
The Emu Creek gold-field alone sent by escort to
Sydney, from October, 1866, to‘September, 1871,
182,061 ounces of gold. Emm two mines on lluav-
kins’ Hill the yield in six months was gold to the
value of £162,850, after paying escort fees and mint
charges.
The proclaimed Gold Eields extend with short
intervals the entire length of the colony, with a


breadth of 200 miles. They comprise an area of
13,656 square miles. It is highly probable that rich
and extensive gold fields will be discovered for many
years to come. There are immense tracts in the
interior which have not yet been prospected. In
many miles of country the rocks that belong to a
golden area yet remain in their original condition,
and will so remain till some fortunate adventurer
stumbles by accident on a tangible encouragement.
All the great gold-fields of the west are within
two days’ journey of the capital, and there is not
any mining settlement which may not be easily
reached. The gold mining centres present the
appearance of orderly and thriving townships, with
schools, churches, journals, shops, and places of
amusement. The authority to dig or mine for
gold is given to all who apply for it. It costs only
10s. a year, and entitles its possessor to take up
ground upon any gold-field to the extent of 60 feet
by 60 feet to 111 feet by 114 feet, according to the
■class of mining pursued upon the particular field.
If a man wants to open a quartz mine he can take
up 50 feet along the line of reef, with a breadth of
100 yards on each side. His miner’s right also
entitles him to occupy half-an-acre of land for his
dwelling, and to an electoral vote. A man may
take up as many claims as he likes if he will only
work them. Sluicing claims extend to 10 acres.
Some mines that have been since worth two or
three hundred thousand pounds, were taken up a


few years ago by one or two poor men in virtue
of their miners’ rights.
Since 1870 the export of gold has been as follows: —

Coal.
The Coal measures of New South Wales extend
from the 29th to the 35th parallel of south latitude.
Sydney is the centre of a coal basin, the coal having
been traced about a hundred miles to the north to
the south and to the west. The areas seamed with
this valuable mineral are so vast that two lines of
railway pass over them at distances of 100 miles
from the metropolis, while the Great Northern runs
through coal fields over its entire length. The quality
is of the best, and admirably adapted for steamers.
The squadrons of the British Navy stationed in the
Pacific are all supplied with coal from the colony.
In the markets of India and China it competes with
English coal.
The following are the returns of the coal raised:

1873 1,192,862 665,747
1874 1,304,567 790,224


The trade is rapidly increasing. The exports now
reach the following widely-distant places : —All the
other Australasian Colonies, Fiji, New Caledonia,
and Honolulu; California and Valparaiso; Java,
Sumatra, and the Moluccas ; Manilla, and Singa-
pore ; Hongkong, Amoy, and other Chinese ports ;
Japan and Russian Asia; Calcutta, Bombay, and
the Mauritius. More than a thousand vessels are
annually engaged in this traffic.
Copper, Tin, &c.
Copper is found in many parts. In 1874 there
were thirteen copper mines, hut few of them have
been systematically worked. Some of the native ores
arc extremely rich, and furnish a large percentage
of pure metal.
Tin was first made known in 1852 by the Bev.
W. B. Clarke, hut not commercially worked till
1870. The quality is of the-very best, and takes
rank beside Straits tin in the English market.
The average cost of raising a ton of tin ore is about
£24, the selling price of which in Sydney is from,
seven to nine pounds below the London price.
Other Minerals. —The Colony is rich in depo-
sits of brown cannel oil coals and oil shales. They
exist in many places at wide areas apart. Iron ores
are widely disseminated. The principal beds are
hematite. In several places there arc coal, limestone,,
and iron in immediate proximity. At Mittagong


in tlie south, and Wallerawang in the west, pig
iron has been produced. There are silver and lead
deposits near Yass, and near Scone on the Hunter.
There are also deposits of silver ore at Beigalia
near Moruya. Cinnabar is found in the Mudgee
district, and antimony ores have been worked in the
Clarence and other districts. Diamonds, opals,
rubies, and other gems have been found in various
parts. The number of diamonds found in New
South Wales updo the end of 1872 was estimated
at between 5,000 and 0,000, the largest having been
one of 5J carats, and the smallest one-tenth of a
grain.
Industries and Manufactures .
rphe progress of New South "W ales in industries
and manufactures is very marked. The latest and
most approved labour-saving appliances and steam-
driven tools have been introduced, and the manu-
facturers here are able to compete with those ot
Europe in the supply of many local requirements.
The rivers and coasts of the colony teem with a
plentiful supply of fish. Mort’s freezing process has
been introduced lately with great success. Eish
preserved by this process are transported by lailuay
to inland cities and towns. The bays and estuaries
along the coast furnish natural oyster-beds many
miles in length, and nowhere in the world is this
delicacy so plentiful and cheap. The whale-fisheries


are also deserving of notice. In 1811 the export of
oil amounted in value to £221,000. But of late
this industry has been much neglected, and in 1871
there were only two ships employed, and the value
of the produce was only £2,897.
Wine-making is a settled industry. The wines
of the Alhury district, in the south, are known in
all the neighbouring colonies as well as London,
The produce of the Hunter Elver districts has won
medals at the Great International Exhibitions of
London and Paris. The production in 1863 was
111,888 gallons, in 1872 it was 113,321 gallons of
wine and 1,766 gallons of brandy, and in 1871 it
was 681,258 gallons of wine and 859 gallons of
brandy. The consumption of local wines is increas-
ing every year in Australia. Numerous breweries
established here turn out beer of excellent quality.
There were 31 breweries in 1871.
Tobacco of local manufacture is finding its way
into favour. Large quantities of Virginian leaf
are imported for manufacture. One of the largest
manufacturers of tobacco in the world, from Virginia
in the United States, has fitted up extensive premises
in Sydney. The quantity manufactured in 1871
was 11,980 cwt.
The preserved meats of New South Wales have
acquired a reputation in the markets of the world.
Salted and preserved meats to the value of £107,335


were exported in 1874. The manufacture of
jams and confectionery, aerated waters, &c., give
employment to numerous hands.
The manufacture and working up of leather em-
ploys nearly 7,000 hands. In 1874 the value of
hides and leather exported amounted to £192,688.
Sydney carried off prizes and medals for manufac-
tures in leather at the Melbourne Intercolonial
Exhibition in 1875.
With wool in abundance, the manufacture of
■cloths, tweeds , blankets , &c., is being rapidly and
profitably developed. In 1874 the production was
458,880 yards of cloth and tweeds. One manu-
facturer alone at present turns out 3,000 yards of
cloth per week. The making up of shirts and
sewn-clothes gives employment to numbers.
Illuminating and lubricating oils are manufac-
tured from kerosene shale. Soap is largely made,
and the weight manufactured in 1874 was 82,270
cwt. In the same year tallow was exported to the
value of £99,649; and tallow candles were manufac-
tured to the weight of 11,724 cwt.
Metals, Earths, &c.
In iron the manufactures of New South Wales
promise to attain to large dimensions. The iron
foundries and engineering establishments here have
produced iron steamships, dredges, lighthouses,
locomotives, bridges, cylindrical piers, and agricul-
tural implements. Every description of the heaviest


kinds of rough work, as well as the finest kinds of
work required for engines, is turned out. There are
also several galvanized iron factories.
i
Tor reducing copper and tin ores there are
numerous smelting works. The poorer copper ores
from neighbouring Colonies are sent to he smelted
in New South Wales. The Hunter Paver Company’s
Copper Smelting Works at Waratahhad twenty-one-
furnaces in. 1872. More than 30,000 tons of ore-
w r ere operated on, and the production of pure copper
was nearly 2,000 tons. The consumption of coal in
the furnaces was about 26,000 tons, and more than
100 men were engaged at the works. The increased
production of tin has necessitated a corresponding
increase in smelting works.
The manufacture of bricks, encaustic tiles, drain-
pipes, and other descriptions of pottery is carried
on by the aid of steam-driven machinery. There is-
constant building work going on in the numerous
cities and towns which are springing up in all parts-
of the country. The capital especially has of late-
years entered on a course of architectural improve-
ment which is converting rows of stores and shops
into streets of palaces. Marble, granite, freestone,
and limestone arc to be found in abundance in the
Colony; and work in earth and stone furnishes
employment to many thousands of masons and
other labourers.


Ship-building. Docks, &c.
There is a Government Dock at Cockatoo Island,
in which 11.M.5. “ Galatea,” of 26 guns and 3,227
tons, was docked. Mort’s Dock is also capable ol
.accommodating the largest class of mail steamers
that come to the port. The Australian Steam
Navigation Company has a slip capable of taking
up a vessel of fifteen hundred tons, and there are
.also smaller private slips and floating docks.
There are numerous varieties of valuable timber
in New South Wales, useful for every description
of ship and house building and furniture. There
is even an export in cut and sawn timber of con-
siderable value. The export in 1871 was valued at
£51,131. A license to cut timber is to be had
for 205.; for cedar alone the charge being £3.
Shipbuilding is carried on in many places along the
coast, and South Sea Island cruisers for the Imperial
Government have been constructed here, and met
with approval. There are numerous joineries for
the supply of woodwork of houses and furniture.
All the cabs, carriages, carts, drays, omnibuses, and
other vehicles required, are made in the colony, and
the proof of the skill of the workmen in this depart-
ment of industry may be seen in the equipages
which daily run along the thoroughfares of the
capital. -


Conclusion.
Those desirous of further information are referred
to the pamphlet published by Mr. Charles Robinson,
entitled “ New South' Wales, the Oldest and Richest
of the Australian Colonies,” or to the larger work,
“The Industrial Progress of New South Males,
published under the auspices of the Exhibition
Commissioners of 1870, and also to the work pub-
lished by the Government entitled 4 'Mines and
Mineral Statistics of New South Wales.” Enough,
however, has been said above to show that New
South Wales is a territory of vast and only very
partially developed resources, and that it offers
every attraction alike to the capitalist, to the man of
ingenuity, and to the industrious workman.
