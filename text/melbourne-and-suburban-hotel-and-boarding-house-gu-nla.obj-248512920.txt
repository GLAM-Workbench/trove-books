The Attractiveness of Melbourne
(Hv A Stay-At-Home Tourist.)
A New Zealand gentleman who recently made
a tour of the Australian capitals, said he pre-
ferred Melbourne to them all. He found here
a stately grace and dignity, an intellectual en-
vironment, and a solid commercial prosperity,
that appealed to a man who could look below
the surface of things and see the permanence
and substantial character of the prosperity the
Victorian capital is now enjoying. Melbourne
holds a distinguished place among the cities ot
the Empire. Her merchants contrive to get
through a vast amount of trade, the shops in
the leading streets vie in appearance, and in the
business done, with any of the great emporiums
of the world, and the people go about the affairs
of every-day life without unseemly rush and
without the feeling that one must hustle or get
left.
What first strikes the visitor is the admirable
manner in which the city is laid out. Absolute
regularity of outline may become monotonous,
but there is no doubt about its convenience and
usefulness to the stranger, who wants to move
round and see everything without pestering
strangers with questions. The city was planned
after the pattern of a chess board. All the
streets, even in the suburbs, are practically at
right angles to one another. You cannot get
bushed as long as you know north from south,
or the direction from which you started. If
you know your destination in a certain direc-
tion, keep right on, and you are sure to get
there.
Then how broad and imposing are the streets !
What room there is for movement! In some
cities, the crowd in Collins-street on a Saturday
morning would be a crush. Ihe spacious pave-
ment gives ample leeway, and the throng moves
along without jostle or disturbance, and,
whether bent on pleasure or pursuing the calls
of business, you proceed without interruption.
The stranger will be arrested by the imposing
buildings he sees everywhere—tall, magnificent
structures, sending storey on storey up to

heaven, and presenting fine architectural facades
that are a tribute to the taste and public spirit
of their owners.
Collins-street, the chief business artery of the
city, is divided into two portions, of which
Elizabeth-street is the point of separation. To
the west are the banks, the insurance offices,
the headquarters of the great shipping com-
panies, the Stock Exchange, and the offices of
importing and indenting firms that have their
warehouses elsewhere. At the extreme end, the
visitor will come across some of the great wool-
broking firms, and everywhere the handsome
establishments in which all these varying in-
terests are housed will be found diversified by
imposing shops, which display the manufac-
turing wealth of Australia and that vast array
of imported wares which find a ready market in
the Queen City.
The visitor will do well to pause at what is
known as the Equitable Corner, upon which Is
erected the massive pile called Equitable Build-
ings, and built by the famous Equitable Life
Assurance Company of New York. That spot
may be said to mark the turning point of the
land boom —that mad period of feverish excite-
ment and over-speculation, the consequences of
which are felt in Melbourne even yet. The land
on which the Equitable’ Buildings are reared
was bought for the enormous sum. of £2200 per
foot for the Collins-street frontage—the largest
price that had ever been paid for city property
in Australia —and save under special and
peculiar circumstances, it is not likely to be
exceeded until the population of the Common-
wealth shows an extraordinary increase.
Proceeding on his way, the observer will join
the fashionable parade on what is known as
The Block —that is, the north side of Collins-
street between Elizabeth and Swanston-streets.
If it be Saturday morning, he will there see Mel-
bourne at her best. Bevies of beautiful girls
are walking up and down, laughing and chatting
gaily.
You will not “see” Melbourne unless you
take part in the Saturday morning stroll
pass the music shops. It epitomises the
grace and charm, and possibly the folly,
of Melbourne. Visiting journalists have des-
cribed it in all the glowing imagery of florid
prose, and artists, among them the celebrated
Melton Prior, have made it the subject of
pictures which have given Collins-street a
reputation all over the world.
Having exhausted The Block, the wayfarer
will probably cast an eye on the offices of the

two morning newspapers, of which he may have
heard something. Here are forged the thunder-
bolts that shake Ministries and make the ner-
vous politician tremble. A visit to one or both
of the ofhces may be included in the itinerary of
a stay in town with much profit, for the modern
newspaper depot is a marvellous combination of
machinery and effective organisation.
Up the hill past Russell-street, the stranger
will find himself in the medical quarter, and it
is to be hoped his call to the city has not had
for its main object an interview with any of the
famous specialists whose brass plates glitter in
the noon-day sun.
Other streets of the metropolis, notably
Swanston-street and Elizabeth-street, are well
worth seeing, for they have many very fine
shops. Flinders-street deserves a stroll in
order to inspect the magnificent frontage of the
Central Railway Station, that occupies more
than the entire section on the south side between
Elizabeth-street and Swanston-street.
Bourke-street he will reserve for night. Most
of the theatres are then within his vision. The
whole thoroughfare is brilliantly lighted;
crowds fill the sidewalks, displaying charac-
teristics in contrast to the aristocratic parade of
the morning. A lot of good-humoured banter
is being exchanged. This is another slide in the
kaleidoscope of Melbourne. It is interesting
and characteristic, and for points of contrast,
humour and variety, will present as many
features as the popular street scenes of
American or Continental cities.
Having exhausted the street life, which he
will have done when Chapel-street (Prahran)
and Smith-street (Collingwood) have had their
turn, the stranger will begin, probably, to look
round the intellectual and artistic attractions of
Melbourne. If he be a man of wide sympathies
and interested in the higher culture, we should
strongly advise him to make his first explora-
tions at the Melbourne University. The
various schools are now admirably equipped
with specimens and apparatus, and on the
medical and surgical side they display the latest
results of human achievement in the fight
against disease. It would be necessary, of
course, to choose a time when the classes are
not at work, but the visitor who obtained per-
mission to inspect the greatest educational in-
stitution in the Commonwealth will derive much
pleasure and instruction from the experience.
While in the neighbourhood of the Univer-
sity, the inquirer w ould do well to round off the
day by a visit to the Zoological Gardens. These

are replete with attraction, not only in the
characteristic associations of a zoological dis-
plav, but in a remarkably fine collection of native
fauna. Pursuing the informative side of his
sojourn in the metropolis, the seeker after
knowledge will, of course, see the Public
Library, in Swanston-street, and also the
National Gallery, where he will make acquaint-
ance with the work of the great masters of the
palette, and witness the beginnings of that Aus-
tralian art which should one day have an
Academy of its own. The General Museum, in
the same building, and the National History
Museum, in Russell-street, offer the keenest
pleasure to the student and refreshment to the
receptive mind. It is hard to make money in
this world, but after an inspection of the Mint
the visitor will probably consider it a very simple
process.
Outdoor attractions in Melbourne are of the
most diverse. The traveller will not fail to see
the Alexandra Drive, with its rookeries, lawns
and flower beds and fine stretch of road, the
beauties of which have done so much to destroy
the absurd tradition that the Yarra is a thing to
be avoided. This will take him to the Botanical
Gardens, situated on the most picturesque spot
around Melbourne. 'The Gardens command a
lovely panorama of the city and northern
suburbs, and whether it be from the point of
view of botanical interest or effective arrange-
ment, the Gardens themselves are undoubtedly
the finest in Australia. The visitor must also
inspect the Queen’s Statue, overlooking the fine
park on the right of the entrance to Alexandra-
avenue.
Short journeys by tram or railway will take
the wanderer to the seaside resorts of South
Melbourne, St. Kilda, or Brighton. Each has
fine stretches of beach and brainy atmosphere,
while the drive to Brighton by road, past the
bold Red Bluff at Elsternwick, will be regarded
as one of the most enjoyable experiences of the
trip.
If the stranger would like a half-hour’s blow
on the briny, he can go to Port Melbourne by
rail, a ten minutes’ journey, and take one of the
steamers across Hobson’s Bay to Williams-
town. There he can see the fleet of grain and
wool ships loading up cargo with extraordinary
expedition for the European markets, while a
short walk will take him to the Back Beach,
which is fast establishing itself as a holiday ren-
dezvous.
While at Port Melbourne, either on going or
returning from Williamstown, the great mail

steamers and ocean liners may be inspected
from the Railway Pier, and if the observer
strikes a day when one of the Orient or P. and
O. boats is leaving for England, he will take
part in an animated scene, for the practice of
seeing one’s friends off on a trip has developed
into a fashionable rite, and there is, colour,
movement, and every form of emotion in the
leave-taking, cheering and fluttering of hand-
kerchiefs that accompany the occasion.
The wharves in Melbourne, stretching from
Queen’s Bridge, at the bottom of Market-street,
present a striking kaleidoscope of Melbourne’s
sea-borne commerce. During the past 10 vears
the navigation of the river has been wonderfully
improved, and vessels drawing j 6 feet have
berthed close to the centre of the city, among
them being the ill-fated Waratah, and that sport
i I calamity, the Pericles, which struck an un-
charted rock in the Australian Bight when the
sea was without a ripple. All the inter-State
steamers berth in the river, and it is a stirring
sight to see them crowded with passengers,
while the cranes are whirring with feverish ex-
citement in the stowage of gigantic machinery
and bales of produce, which Melbourne dis-
tributes all round the continent,
Pursuing his investigation into the commer-
cial aspect of Melbourne life, the visitor, if he
arrives during the wool season, should en-
deavour to go through the great wool ware-
houses. This will give him an idea of the
immensity of Australia’s greatest industry, for
we are the largest wool-growers in the world,
and the manufacturing industries of other coun-
tries would be sadly crippled if it were not for
the abundance and quality of Australian wool.
American and Continental wool-buyers are eager
bidders in the Melbourne wool market.
Melbourne’s ecclesiastical edifices have an
abiding interest. The two Cathedrals must not
be missed, and within a stone’s throw of one
another in Collins-street are the leading
churches of the nonconformist denominations.
If the Federal Parliament be in session, the
sightseer is sure to wander up to the handsome
building at the top of Bourke-street, there to
listen to the stirring debates that even the
mildest question seems nowadays to be capable
of agitating. Even should the legislative halls
cease to reverberate with the eloquence of Aus-
tralian patriotism, Parliament House is well
worth seeing. The same remark will apply to
the State Parliament, which meets at the
Exhibition, There are some excellent speakers

in both the Council and the Assembly, and State
politics still touch the life of the people in all
their most important domestic interests.
If a race meeting is in progress at the head-
quarters of the turf, far-famed Flemington must
command attention; and no record of Mel-
bourne’s charms would be complete without a
reference to her numerous parks, the size and
beauty of which are unequalled in Australia.
And now for a few thumb-nail sketches of
extra metropolitan attractions.
Sandringham affords a very pleasant outing,
having a fine expanse of beach and a bold cliff,
on which you get a cool breeze on the hottest
day. You can reach Sandringham by rail from
Flinders-street.
Beaumaris. —A tram ride will take you to this
pretty bay-side resort, shortly, it is to be hoped,
to be connected by electric coach or rail with the
city. There are many delightful bays and
nooks about the coast, and the road from Black
Rock, where the holiday-maker is sure to pause
for a time, is lined with masses of tea-tree, that
furnish a perennial shade. All this part of the
coast is worth inspection, and the journey by
train may be completed in a very effective
manner by going on to Cheltenham, through


market gardens and orchards, returning to Mel-
bourne from Cheltenham by rail.
Mentone is another shore spot on the east side
of Port Phillip, and fast becoming a residential
suburb of great importance. It is only 14 miles
from Melbourne, and is reached by train from
Flinders-street. Many handsome villas adorn
the Beach-road, overlooking the sea, and the
beach, which travels for miles, offers splendid
bathing facilities.
Mordialloc, further on, has its railway ter-
minus (dose to the beach. It has become a
favourite resort for holiday trippers and Sunday
excursionists, and presents a variety of amuse-
ment in sea-bathing, boating on the Mordialloc
('reek, dancing, and many other allurements.
Aspendale and Carrum have both bounded
Into popular favour within a few years. They
make an excellent camping ground, which the
tall tea-tree scrub specially favours. The tents
are often most elaborate structures, supplied
with all the latest conveniences, even to the
electric light, and life in such agreeable circum-
stances is elevated to a fine art. Mixed bathing
is the mode at Carrum and Aspendale, the wide
expanse of sea, protected by a natural bar,
giving opportunities for a dip, which both sexes
appreciate to the full.
Croydon, between Melbourne and Lilydale,
lies in a most beautiful fruit district, surrounded
In hills, forming a valley that has a perpetual
charm. Beautiful walks are the feature of the
Croydon country. Very little effort finds one
among secluded nooks, brilliant in flower and
foliage, or a short walk enables one to reach an
eminence commanding a lovely view of the
spreading country. Croydon has a beautiful
even climate all the year round, notwithstanding
its proximity to Melbourne, and as a summer
residence it is much favoured by business men
who do not want to go too far away from the
cit v.
Montrose is the nearest point to the city at
which the holiday-seeker finds himself in real
mountainous air, for it lies on the slope of the
Dandenong ranges, and a brisk walk w ill take
the pedestrian to an altitude in which he is in-
vigorated and strengthened to a degree that
surprises the city dweller. The views to be ob-
tained are gorgeous, the panorama of undulat-
ing plains that spread away to the south being
a mass of colour.
Heidelberg Is only a short journey from the
city, but It plunges the visitor at once into
country scenes and fresh, fragrant meadow
lands. The Yarra here is remarkably pretty,

and quite denies its reputation as a woebegone
stream of the popular humourist.
Warrandyte is not so well known as it ought
to be. It can be reached by coach from Heidel-
berg, and the river views, the peace and repose
that everywhere prevail, well repay an afternoon
spent in this picturesque locality.
Greensborough, on the Plenty, is a popular
Sunday trip. The week-ender finds here good
fishing, and often excellent sport for his gun.
South Morang, on the Whittlesea line, is
another fine picnicking ground, which is every
year attracting more attention. The elevation
is high enough to take one into pure fresh air,
and the Plenty, flowing through a rugged, rock-
bound valley, presents not only effective scenery,
but at times good fishing for the skilful angler.
Sassafras is reached by a delightful drive
from Bayswater, the first station on the line
between Ringwood and Fern Tree Gully. Here
we get into the very bosom of the fern country.
Deep gullies intersect the sides of the hills, and
along these massive ferns spread out their
waving antlers, always giving a solemn beauty
and majesty to the silent scene. The eucalpyti
are of enormous height, and for the Australian


who knows how to appreciate the elusive charm
of these giant trees, they are a source of ever-
lasting pleasure. Mount Sassafras, nearly 2000
feet above sea level, is well worth the climb, for
it commands a vast area. Sassafras is a
popular resort, and strenuous efforts are made
to protect its beauties from the sacrilegious
hands of the vandal.
Olimla, close by, is away up among the
heights where the tired city man can get away
from the world and feel himself at peace. The
view from the summit of Mount Olinda is
superb. In every direction is a sparkling pano-
rama of loveliness. The bay dances in the
sunshine ; Melbourne has that inevitable haze
that always hangs over a big city, but through
the vast aggregation of buildings can be seen
their principal features, standing out with a dis-
tinctness and sharpness of outline that makes
them easily identified. The mountain views
are magnificent; so striking, indeed, that many
people spend their holidays at Olinda year after
year, and never tire of its stately grandeur.
