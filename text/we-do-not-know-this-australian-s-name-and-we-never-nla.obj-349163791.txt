the Hon P. J. Keating, mp
AT THE FUNERAL SERVICE OF THE
Unknown Australian Soldier,
11 November 1993
We do not know this Australian’s
NAME AND WE NEVER WILL.
We do not know his rank or his
battalion. We do not know
where he was born, or precisely
how and when he died. We do
not know where in Australia he
had made his home or when he
left it for the battlefields of
Europe. We do not know his age
or his circumstances whether
he was from the city or the bush;
what occupation he left to
become a soldier; what religion,
if he had a religion; if he was
married or single. We do not
know who loved him or whom
he loved. If he had children we
do not know who they are. His
family is lost to us as he was lost
to them. We will never know
who this Australian was.
Yet he has always been among
those we have honoured. We know
that he was one of the 45,000
Australians who died on the Western
Front. One of the 416,000
Australians who volunteered for
service in the First World War. One
of the 324,000 Australians who
served overseas in that war, and one
of the 60,000 Australians who died on
foreign soil. One of the 100,000
Australians who have died in wars
this century.
He is all of them. And he is one of
us.
This Australia and the Australia he
knew are like foreign countries. The
tide of events since he died has been
so dramatic, so vast and all-
consuming, a world has been created
beyond the reach of his imagination.
He may have been one of those who
believed the Great War would be an
adventure too grand to miss. He may
have felt that he would never live
down the shame of not going. But
the chances are that he went for no
other reason than that he believed it
was his duty the duty he owed his
country and his King.
Because the Great War was a mad,
brutal, awful struggle distinguished
more often than not by military and
political incompetence; because the
waste of human life was so terrible
that some said victory was scarcely
discernible from defeat; and because
the war which was supposed to end
all wars in fact sowed the seeds of a
second, even more terrible, war
we might think that this Unknown
Soldier died in vain.
But in honouring our war dead as
we always have, we declare that this
is not true.
For out of the war came a lesson
which transcended the horror and
tragedy and the inexcusable folly.
It was a lesson about ordinary
people and the lesson was that
they were not ordinary.
On all sides they were the heroes of
that war; not the generals and the
politicians, but the soldiers and
sailors, and nurses those who
taught us to endure hardship, show
courage, to be bold as well as
resilient, to believe in ourselves, to
stick together.
The Unknown Australian Soldier
we inter today was one of those who
by his deeds proved that real nobility
and grandeur belongs not to empires
and nations but to the people on
whom they, in the last resort, always
depend.
That is surely at the heart of the
Anzac story, the Australian legend
which emerged from the war. It is a
legend not of sweeping military
victories so much as triumphs
against the odds, of courage and
ingenuity in adversity. It is a legend
of free and independent spirits
whose discipline derived less from
military formalities and customs
than from the bonds of mateship
and the demands of necessity.
It is a democratic tradition, the
tradition in which Australians have
gone to war ever since.
This Unknown Australian is not
interred here to glorify war over
peace; or to assert a soldier’s
character above a civilian’s; or one
race or one nation or one religion
above another; or men above
women; or the war in which he
fought and died above any other war;
or of one generation above any that
has or will come later.
The Unknown Soldier honours the
memory of all those men and women
who laid down their lives for
Australia.
His tomb is a reminder of what we
have lost in war and what we have
gained.
We have lost more than 100,000
lives, and with them all their love of
this country and all their hope and
energy.
We have gained a legend; a story of
bravery and sacrifice and with it a
deeper faith in ourselves and our
democracy, and a deeper
understanding of what it means to be
Australian.
It is not too much to hope,
therefore, that this Unknown
Australian soldier might continue to
serve his country he might
enshrine a nation’s love of peace and
remind us that in the sacrifice of the
men and women whose names are
recorded here there is faith enough
for all of us.
