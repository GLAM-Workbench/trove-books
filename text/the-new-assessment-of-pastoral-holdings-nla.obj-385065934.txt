PREFACE.
THE theories and deliverances of politicians and
experts upon the Land Laws and the Grazing
industry may be more or less valuable, but for the
hard facts we must go to the merchants’ ledgers.
The testimony given before the Land Board at
Dubbo is presented, in the belief that it will be of
value to those legislators who have not had oppor-
tunities of acquiring such a practical knowledge of
the risks attached to grazing pursuits as will enable
them to deal intelligently with the amendment of
the Land Act of 1884.

EVIDENCE
Taken by the Land Board at Hubbo, on the
Oth and 10th February, 1887, re the
Assessment of the Wonbobbie Holding.
Ciiaulks William Lloyd, Run Appraiser, being duly sworn,
states : Inspected the leasehold area of Wonbobbie Pastoral
Holding on 13th, 17th, and 18th November, 1886; my report is
true and correct; the water supply is natural and permanent ;
it has frontage to the Macquarie River, Ewenmar, Marthaguy,
Backs Boothaguy, Merrigal, and Weemabung Creeks, as well as
to large swamps; this supply is sufficient to keep the land fully
stocked ; the artificial supply is three dams on Freehold—none on
Leasehold; no supply from underground sources; the soil is,
generally, of very good quality—no rock formation or stone ; the
country, as regards quality and soil, is nearly all good for grazing ;
it is level and thickly timbered—patches of Myall, interspersed
with clumps of Box and other timber; the scrub is fairly and
correctly shown on tracing, but I think from riding through it
the proportion of scrub is not as great as shown on tracing; a
good deal of it may be described as open country good for grazing
purposes ; the scrub consists of Budtha, Pine, and Belar ; part of
the scrub is not edible, and is worthless ; about one-third of the
scrub and forest does not contain edible trees; I estimate the
grazing capacity at one sheep to 2| acres ; it is a fattening
country; the timber is so interspersed over the area that it is
impossible to particularize it; there are some forfeited improve-
ments situated on portions 57 and 58, Parish Killendoon, con-
sisting of skeletons of a house and shed, which I consider of no
value; the three dams on freehold are necessary for the working
of the run ; they are used in combination with the leasehold
area ; I believe the Marthaguy would not be permanent without
the dam at head station; this is my first visit to the district, and
I know that this season is one unparalleled for rain, and conse-
quently I found grass and water abundant; the cattle portion of
the run was covered with water, and there were very extensive
swamps ; supposing the rainfall in 1886 to have been over 30 inches
and in 1882 to have been 4 inches, in the latter year the country
must have been in a very bad state ; I was informed by some of


the station people that the creeks were permafiont in ordinary
seasons, and that is what I ground my report on, together with
the observations I made ; the frontage to the Macquarie River is
about one mile; this would not be available for many sheep, on
account of its narrowness; I consider the other creeks and swamps
permanent in ordinary seasons ; I mean that there are permanent
holes in the creeks ; I did not sound any of the creeks ; I strike
an average of the past ten seasons to get an ordinary season ; I
consider the last seven or eight seasons very dry ones ; going to
the head station I went through three-quarters of a mile of what
is marked on tracing Pine scrub; Icannot give the proportion of
scrub on the area ■ a good deal of what is marked scrub on the
tracing is not what I call scrub ; I examined a good deal of the
scrub ; it is so mixed up with the open country that it is very
difficult to give the proportion; some of the scrub is in belts,
others in clumps ; I don’t consider Budtha edible ; Saltbush was
growing in the scrub ; there is Wilga, Pine, Belar, and Yarran in
the scrub; these are not edible; Salt-bush, Cotton-bush, and
Herbage grow in the scrub ; I would expect to find the Herbs in
the scrub in ordinary seasons ; I arrived at my estimate of the
carrying capacity from the nature of the soil and herbage, con-
sidering it would grow there in ordinary seasons, and supposing
the water to be permanent; supposing the rainfall to have been
as slight as it was from 1882 to 1884, the carrying capabilities
would be much less ; I would not be prepared to say what it
would carry in extreme seasons; I saw a great many selections
on the run of extensive areas ; I should say average good land
was selected ; the selections were scattered over the run; this
would depreciate the value of the run, and it would cost more to
work it; ringbarking would improve the carrying capacity,
particularly in the scrub; this is the only way, I think, the
country could be improved; the run was lavishly improved.
RESUMED AREA.
Inspected this area on the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th November,
1886 ; the natural water supply is permanent in ordinary seasons ;
the creeks are Marthaguy, Roothaguy, Merrigaland Weemabung ;
the natural supply, combined with tanks, is sufficient to keep the
land fully stocked; the tank is on Water Reserve 754 ; it is
45 yards by 40 by 4 feet; excavation 7201 yards ; there is a dam
on Roothaguy Creek about 400 yards by 6by 3; it throws back
a large quantity of water, and is, I believe, permanent; the water is
thrown back on selections ; the dam is on Camping Reserve 1324,
and I should think cost at least .£5OO ; I do not know the capacity
of the dam, so cannot give any estimate except approximately;
there are two dams and tanks combined on Freehold ; the soil is


that usually found in good Myall country ; there arc large
patches of scalded clay on which no vegetation grows ; I saw
more on this area than on the other ; the position of the scrub
as shown on tracing is approximately correct; I should say from
passing through it that there is really not so much scrub and
timber as is shown on tracing ; the country is thinly timbered ;
on the plains Myall and Rosewood; on the scrub and forest land
there is, Box, Pine, Oak, &c.; the country is fattening ; I esti-
mate the carrying capacity at one sheep to three acres ; the
country not scrub is thinly timbered with the exception of the
river frontage on the Leasehold; the water supply is the same as
on the Leasehold ; I have only experienced the present extra-
ordinary good season on this run \ from personal knowledge 1
can’t say whether the water supply is permanent or not; looking
at tracing I see that there are six belts or clumps of scrub
depicted thereon ; I cannot give the approximate area; I should
say about 3000 or 4000 acres of the area is scrub ; it consists
of Pine, Budtha, and Belar, which are not edible \ the dam on
camping reserve is almost surrounded by alienated land ; the
scalded plain is in patches of 20 or 30 acres; the Resumed Area
is nearly as good as the Leasehold Area for grazing purposes ; the
only thing is that the Resumed Area contains noxious plants and
a greater proportion of scalded plain ; the best portion of the
area is in the centre, including Water Reserve 1125, which is ten
miles by one; the grazing capabilities could be improved by
ringbarking and clearing the scrub ; there are travelling stock
reserves through both areas, which in the Resumed Area are 2840
acres in extent and on the Leasehold Gl3O acres.

Robert George Dulhunty, Stock Inspector, Dubbo*
states: The returns for Wonbobbie Pastoral Holding are as
follows: —
Horses. Cattle. Sheep.
1881 ... 140 ... 1,500 ... 63,000
1882 ... 70 ... 200 ... * 80,000
1883 ... 60 ... 150 ... 44,352
1884 .., 54 ... 84 ... 30,000
1885 ... 37 ... 130 ... 22,622
After that the returns were made to the Coonamble Stock
Inspector ; in 1884 the Wonbobbie lessee made claim for refund
on account of the deaths in sheep, reducing them from 30,000 to
8000 or less; no refund was made ; they stated that at the time
they made their return they could not muster the sheep to count
them and 30,000 was the estimate of the sheep they had on ; a
subsequent muster proved them to be something less than 8000 ;
I have been Stock Inspector since 1878, and have travelled the
5


country ; I have boon a. grazier for many years in this district—in
fact from my boyhood ; I have known Wonbobbie in good and
bad seasons ; I also know that it has been selected on a good
deal ; selectors generally take the best land ; in ordinary sea-
sons, taking the whole run, I should say it would carry a
sheep well to three acres; that is not considering the selections
taken out of it, but just as it stood when I knew it first.
isot!} ( Si s™ d ) B ° duliiunty.
Thomas Buckland’s evidence is to the following effect; —
Owing to the indiscriminate way in which the selections were
taken up throughout the whole length of the run, a very large
portion of the remaining land is not available to the lessee with-
out trespassing across selected or conditional leased land, and the
Government having (it is believed illegally) granted conditional
leases out of the Leasehold Area, the quantity of grass available to
the lessee has been still further reduced from the area it was
believed that he held secure for the term of his lease.
Moreover, the selections, legally and illegally, have taken up so
much of the frontages to creeks and watercourses, that the run
has been deprived of all the best grazing land : in fact, in riding
over the run, I find that where a good spot of grass appears, it is
a selection This holds good both on the Leasehold and Resumed
Area.
Owing to the run being divided into small patches of country
by the numerous intervening selections and conditional leases, a
larger number of men are required to protect the stock than when
the run was intact and capable of carrying thrice the number
which it is possible to keep now. In fact, the work for the
boundary riders is doubled, as there is the same length of run,
with on'y two-fifths of the area, and an almost impossibility to
overcome in the trespass upon so many holdings.
The effect of the large number of selections and leases on the
Leasehold Area is to render the fencing a.i intolerable burden and
wrong.
If the Board will look at the map, they will see that the run
was entirely fenced in ; this, with the dams and other improve-
ments, was valued by a disinterested valuator as costing £30,000.
All this fencing and some of the dams are now valueless to the
owners of the run ; moreover 33 miles of paddock fencing have
been absorbed by selections, for which no payment or compensa-
tion was obtained, except £35 recently received.
Notwithstanding that the entire boundary of our run is fenced,
we are now called upon, under the Act of 1884, to contribute one
half to the fencing-ln of conditional leases, which we believe to
have beep takep out of our leasehold area illegally


This fencing will remain upon the land after our lease expires,
and will therefore become the property of the ultimate owner,
and the so-called conditional lease, being really a conditional
sale, the present holder of the conditional lease will have a valu-
able asset to which we have contributed one-half the cost, and we
have no redress it appears. Moreover, where our conditional
leases adjoin a selector’s 'ease we pay half the cost of fencing;
he has the right of ultimately becoming the freeholder—we have
not; he will therefore get our fence.
Again, where a selector’s conditional lease is bounded by the
stock route, which is upon our Leasehold Area, or camping place
similarly situated, we are called upon to fence. To this stock
route we have no exclusive right, it is in fact open to anyone who
will drive stock and swear that they are travelling in terms of the
regulations. In fact, in bad seasons we do not get a blade of
grass, as certain owners of sheep, having runs some distances on
each side of Wonbobbie, drive their sheep up and down the route
as long as grass is found upon it.
A considerable reduction of rent is required on account of the
area included in the stock route and camping place, which
exceeds 10,000 acres, we believe.
In ordinary seasons two stockriders additional are required to
watch passing stock through the run by the route. Moreover,
the value of the leasehold area has been much reduced by the
Chinese and other Burr brought upon the run by the travelling
stock.
The appraiser’s report appears to have been carefully and con-
scientiously drawn up, but no one, viewing the run in its present
condition, can form a correct judgment of its value and carrying
capacity in dry or ordinary seasons. Only once before has it
had so fine an appearance for grass.
The district in which Wonbobbie is situated is notorious for
the severity of the droughts, to which it is continually subjected.
Twice during my connection with the property the losses have
brought the owner to ruin.
In the drought now just at an end we lost the whole of the
cattle and horses, and the sheep were reduced to 5033. Between
the shearing of 1883 .and the 30th June, 1884, 48,420 sheep died,
and of two years’ lambing, only GO3 were weaned. One mob of
cattle were travelled and sold, and they realised <£7o or £BO less
than the expenses. Another mob were sent away for agistment,
and only forty-five head were recovered—the charges exceeding
their value.
There is in the report a clerical error, or the appraiser has been
misinformed as to the area.


The leasehold area is said to have a carrying capacity of
22,000 sheep, or one sheep to acres :
22,000 x 21 2 , equal 55,000 acres.
The original acreage at the’division of the run was, for the Lease-
hold Area, 45,687 acres j subsequently there have been some con-
ditional leases granted, and the actual area must now be under
40,000 acres—l believe much less. The Resumed Area is estimated
to carry 23,000 sheep, or one sheep to three acres—23,ooo x 3
equals 69,000 acres. The area at the division of the run was
45,698 acres. There have been so many selections taken up, and
conditional leases granted (Bundilla block being almost or quite
absorbed), that the area cannot exceed 35,000 acres at the most.
Dams were constructed and remain intact, but several have
been surrounded by selections, and are no longer available for the
stock of the runholder. The only dam entirely free to our own
stock is the homestead dam.
To show the risks and the uncertainty of grazing upon droughty
country like Wonbobbie, 1 may mention that the late owner had
at one time a margin of value over and beyond the debt (then
.£15,000) of upwards of £60,000. The first drought which he
suffered loss from reduced him to the verge of ruin, but he
recovered, and had a small margin beyond his indebtedness, but the
last drought commenced with rather dry seasons, and the
expenses thereby were increased—-the debt being on the Ist
January, 1883, £36,000, the gross return from wool being
£7,640. As the severity of the drought increased, so did the
expenses and the debt, and at the shearing of 1884 we only
sheared 108 bales of fleece wool, producing a gross return of
£1,283.
The debt is now £66,782 os. 9d„ and the gross return of wool
last year was £3296 only.
The original area of the whole of the blocks was 150,800 acres,
and the assessment paid £656 10s.
On the 31st December, 1884, we paid £656 10s. for the year
1885.
On the 31st December, 1885, we paid upon the Resumed Area
£143; Leasehold Area, £235 Bs. On the 31st December, 1886,
we paid upon the Resumed Area, £l4O 10s. ; Leasehold Area,
£235 Bs.

Evidence in chief of Thomas Buckland continued ;
In the early part of 1886 the dread of a return of the
drought was so very great that I was in doubt whether to sell off
the stock or not; at that time the selectors were stealing our
water and drawing it away in tanks on drays, and were digging
trenches to draw the water out of our holes ; I prosecuted them
but only lost money, and verified the old saying that “It is bad to
go to law with Satan when his imps are in court ” ; in other
words when a Warren jury is in court; bearing on the question
of fencing I have recently paid £2O for half share of fencing 40
acres which I am unlucky enough to own on Weemobah Block ;
I am afraid to stock up the Resumed Area for fear of all the land
being taken up by selectors any Thursday and my stock sacrificed ;
Water Reserve 1125, an area of ten miles by one, was taken up
in one week, and for one piece of land there were six applicants;
I have ridden over the country three times but 1 have not
managed the station ; I have been connected with the run about
nineteen years ; the wool last season was from purchased sheep,
and was sold unusually low; I entered into possession of the run
in May, 1884, as mortgagee ; the last holder was a Mr. Bird, who
was compelled to sequestrate his estate at the instance of Mr.
Ffrench soon after I went into possession.

Frederick Edmund Body states : —I am a grazier residing
at Bundemar and was formerly manager of Wonbobbie station ;
I left Wonbobbie in August, 1881 ; I went to Wonbobbie
in 1868 ; the run was 150,800 acres in area in
1873 ; there were no selections or alienations on the run; it was
not fenced j the rent was, I think, a little over £4OO ; when it
was intact, at the time I speak of, it would carry in ordinary
seasons a sheep to three acres, having been watered by dam and
tanks ; we began to improve in 1873 ; in 1877 there were about
50.000 or 52,000 grown sheep and 20,000 lambs weaned early
in 1877 ; the 20,000 lambs would be the score foe. the previous
season; in May, 1877, we sent away about 23,000 sheep on
account of a very severe drought; when the drought broke in
February, 1878, there were on the station 15,000 sheep, which
were kept alive till the rain came by cutting Myall; we lost
about 40,000 in this drought, being more than half we had ; the
23.000 sheep we removed were away twelve months and were
shorn at Brewarrina; we calculated the travelling expenses and
agistment for the 23,000 sheep, and they stood us in nearly 6s a
head ; we continued the improvements and erected altogether
155 miles of fencing ; there were no alienations of any kind on

When I left Wonbobbie in 1881 these improvements were all
in good working order; we were improving from 1874 to 1878 ;
selectors appeared on the run in 1881 after I came away; the
run is pretty well cut up by selectors ;thc Leasehold Area at date
of division of run contained 45,785 acres; the original area of
the holdings was 150,800 acres; the area left on the run
to be divided when it was divided was 90,000 acres odd; this
shows that 60,800 acres have been alienated ; I may say that that
area—6o,Boo acres—is the very pick of the whole run and the
water frontages ; since the division has taken place, and on the
Resumed Area, I see by map that 15,000 acres have been alien-
ated; 10,000 acres out of the 15,000 were taken up in Reserve
1125, which had been cancelled ; these reserves were made on
my application, and were picked spots of the run for grass and
water ; Reserve 1125 was the best spot on the run, and protected
Urobulla Waterhole, which in 1868 was the only water for twenty
miles available for stock; we had to drive our saddle horses from
Wonbobbie Homestead to this hole once a day for water-—a
distance of six miles; the water for domestic use for Wonbobbie
was got out of a hole in the creek, which was unfit for use with-


out boilingl know the Leasehold Area and the way it has been
cut up ; taking into consideration the good land that has been
taken out of this area, and the loss of water frontages, and only
leaving the Pine scrub and timbered country, I estimate that the
area would carry over a series of ten years, taking one year with
another, a sheep to five acres ; this estimate would also apply to
the Resumed Area; I have experienced three droughts during
my time on the station, and I know what they are; I have
been living on that station and on an adjoining one
for the last nineteen years, and I speak from that expe-
rience ; I know the scrubs on the Leasehold Area ; at
the present time there is grass on them; since I have
been in the district I have never seen such a good season as this
for water, as the creeks have been running since April, 1886, up
till now, with the exception of one month; in ordinary seasons
the scrub will not stand stocking, as there is no feed in it; the
water supply, except the frontage on the Macquarie, is not
permanent; I have seen the creeks as dry as the table, except
two holes in the Beemunnel Creek—one on each area—which are
permanent; I have never known them to be dry ; they would
water probably each about 3000 sheep ; there is only a mile
frontage to the Macquarie, and this would water about 700 sheep ;
the natural water supply is not sufficient to keep the land stocked ;
in 1868 all the sheep we had on was about 4000, which we would
have had to travel but for the rain coming on ; all the rest were
travelling; this was before the dams and tanks were erected ; I
saw the creeks dry in 1868, and have not seen them dry since,
but they are all dammed now, which, I think, makes the water
permanent ; there is some plain and open country left; I have
taken this into consideration in my estimate of the grazing
capacity; the thinner portions of the scrub could be greatly
improved by ringbarking; parts of the scrub could not, I think,
be improved ; scrub No. 10 could be rung at a cost of Is. 6d. an
acre, and would much improve the land ; some of the scrub at the
back would cost 7s. or Bs. an acre to ring; in fact, I don’t think
you could get anyone to tackle it; the freehold and conditionally
leased land held by the lessee is about 6500 acres 'out of the
66,500 alienated; if the scrub were rung more water would have
to be made to enable any additional stock to bo carried ; the Salt
and Cotton Bush are disappearing from the scrub, owing to
droughts and bush fires ; in an ordinary season these bushes do
not seem to grow; they dry up and perish ; the Macquarie
contains permanent water, but I have seen it a chain of holes.

These improvements are required, and are used in connection
with the working of the run ; the Urobula House has been
selected, and I will have to erect another one; I keep a record of
the rainfall at Wonbobbie, and it is as follows :
I have managed the country in good and bad seasons; the
present season is one of unparalleled goodness; the carrying


capacity of the Leasehold Area is from four to five acres to a
sheep, taking into consideration the seasons we have had and the
way the area has been cut up by selections; there is a large
portion of about 10,000 acres which we cannot occupy on account
of its being covered with water; we have not had sheep on this
land since November, and at the present state of things I don’t
think we will be able to use it for six months; the Resumed
Area will carry much the same as the Leasehold; the present
season is one unparalleled in the district for abundance of water
and grass, and in the seasons of the years 1882-3 and part of
1884 there was hardly a blade of grass on the run, and we had
to feed the stock on scrub ; in 1882 we returned 8000 sheep ; in
1883 44,352 sheep ; part of these were sold and part died, and we
had a very poor lambing on account of the drought; in 1884
we returned 30,000 sheep by guess as we could not muster our
sheep on account of the drought; we mustered them subsequently
and only mustered 5,636 ; the discrepancy was caused by death
from starvation and want of water; in the beginning of 1884 the
flock was GO,OOO, including lambs, and they by deaths in that
year were reduced to 5,636 ; we had no lambing in 1884 ; in 1885
wo had 12,000 lambs out of 16,000 ewes; in the beginning of
1885 we bought nearly 30,000 sheep, paying 12s. 6d. for ewes
and Bs. 6d. for wethers ; the natural water supply on the lease-
hold area is not permanent; I have seen all the natural water
supply dry, except the river, for nine months during 1883-4 ; we
had to fence off some of the larger holes to keep our sheep out of
them as they were so boggy ; the smaller holes were perfectly dry ;
we had to depend on the artificial supply which is on Freehold;
the natural supply on the Resumed Area is not permanent; I have
seen it all dry for about nine months; about half the stock were
on this area, and subsisted on the artificial supply on Freehold ;
the Macquarie River is permanent, but only about 1000 sheep
can water at it; about one-tenth of the leasehold area consists of
scrub in which no feed grows in ordinary seasons; there is a sort
of feathery grass in the scrub at present, but not Cotton and Salt
Cush; the Cotton and Salt Bush usually grow in what is called
open country and on the plains; there is about one-tenth of the
Resumed Area scrub containing the same grass as Leasehold scrub
at the present time; I have applied for permission to ringbark
the whole of the Leasehold Area ; in addition to ringbarking I will
have to make more water on the land; I will at least have to put
on two more dams or tanks of about 6000 yards each, which will
cost about <£Boo ; McAlary, a selector on the run, has applied for
10,240 acres on the Resumed Area as a scrub lease ; his lease
includes <£l6oo worth of my improvements; Bertha Schneider
another selector, has applied for 2040 acres adjoining.


The area taken out of the Resumed Area under the Act of 1884 is
over 10,000 acres in addition to McAlary’s and Schneider’s scrub
leases; I think the Resumed Area is now only about 25,000 acres,
and it is divided and cut up by selections; the sheep returns
are :
Cattle. Horses. Sheep.
1886 ... 279 ... 39 31,978
1887 .. 869 46 43,236
Our flock was reduced in 1883 to 5G36 \ we increased it by pur-
chases to 22,622 in 1884 \ in 1885 we sold 4000 sheep, and
bought about 10,000 ; it will cost one shilling per acre all
round to ring the leasehold area j I estimate the laud will carry
a sheep to three acres after it has been rung • my woolshed is 26
miles from the Nevertire Railway Station, and I have paid
£2 10s. for carriage, but now do my own carriage ; I have never
had the carriage done for less than £2 ss. per ton.

day of February, 1887. j
Charles William Lloyd, recalled, states :—ln estimating
the carrying capacity, I took a general view of the country
passed over; I might have included some of the purchased
land and conditiorially leased in my estimate, as it was impos-
sible to distinguish them exactly, none of the leases being
fenced in. In my inspection I kept on the Crown lands as much
as possible; my estimate is on the Crown lands which I believed
to be Crown lands ; I don’t think I could have made any material
mistake; lam aware that certain improvements are alleged to be
situated on portion 54, parish Killndoon, and on theWonbobbie
holding ; I did not see these improvements as they were (shewn
in tracing) completely isolated from any Crown lands, being sur-
rounded on three sides by alienated lands and on the fourth by
the Crown lands of another holding ; therefore I did not value
them; with reference to the improvements said to be situated on
portions 57 and 58, I saw the improvements from the opposite
side of the creek (which was too high to cross); there was the
skeleton of a house and shed, which were roofless, and I consider
them valueless for the working of the run ; I saw some of the land
was cleared and grubbed, and I consider worth £3 10s. per acre.
