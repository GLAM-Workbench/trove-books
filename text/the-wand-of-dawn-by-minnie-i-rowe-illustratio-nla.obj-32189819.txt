CHAPTER 1
Bushland
Did you ever live in Bushland, or even go
there for a holiday? If you did you know
that it is the loveliest place in the whole
world ?where big, scented gum-trees stand
very close together, holding up towards the
sky long silvery arms full of fluffy, creamy
flowers, and lovely, red-tipped leaves with
big, green caterpillars and wriggly, shiny
black ones crawling over^them ?and birds
nests, full of soft pink babies hiding among
them ?not to mention beetles, shining like
green jewels?and little, warm cuddly pos-
sums ?and, oh! a whole host of other splendid
things whose names I have forgotten.


Then there is the little creek that races
and sings all day and loves to play pranks with
the grasses and maiden-hair that lean over him
to hear, and then ?suddenly find themselves
decked out in diamond necklaces.
And these are only a few of the things
that make Bushland such a fine place!
Would you believe that a little girl who
lived there could ever be lonely?
Well, she could, for Meg told me ?and
she knows, because she proved it, as you
shall hear.
But then, that was before she had found
out the most wonderful thing of all?l must
whisper this like a secret, because they are
so shy?There are fairies in Bushland!!!
Meg told me ?and she knows?for she is
the one who found them!
This was the way it happened!
When she first came to Bushland she
was happy all the day. In the mornings,
when the magpies were singing, she went to


school, and the path ran along by the little,
gurgly creek, and round by the deep, quiet
pool (where Bob brought her one night to
see the stars dance, when he threw pebbles
into the water), then across the fern gully,
and up the side of the little hill, before she
came in sight of the school; and she always
saw many fine things to tell the Teacher-girl
about; and at playtime there was fun! Some
of the lessons were like games?and alto-
gether the day passed very quickly.


Then came a time when the tall, thin
Doctor-Man said she must not go to school
again for the whole summer; but she did not
mind a bit, because Bob became a better play-
mate than ever, and bought her dolls and
sweets and picture-books. He often took her
out, too, to play among the gum-trees, and
told her stories ?and, altogether, she was very
pleased with the Doctor-Man.
But, soon, came a time when, although
Mother smiled and joked a good deal her eyes
were very red and her face was very white ?
and Meg found out that it was because Bob
was going to a place called The War a
place which she was afraid was different and
horrid. Then Bob laughed at her for a goose,
and told her it was the very best place for a
fellow to be ?but, of course, a little sister
could not go too ?why, she must stay at home
and look after a fellow?s dogs and things!


CHAPTER 11.
The Porch of Fairyland
When Bob came home on leave, Meg
thought that he looked handsomer than ever
in his uniform. What she admired most was
an ornament that he wore in the front of his
cap.
When she told him so, he laughed, took
off his cap, and put it on her head. Then he
held her up to look at herself in the mirror
above the mantel-shelf, and began to explain
to her all about the beautiful rising-sun badge
that Australian soldiers wear.
At first, Meg had just thought that it was
pretty. Then, as Bob talked, she felt that he
was wearing something sacred and splendid;
and she began to understand why Bob was so


eager to go and fight in the terrible war that
everybody was talking about.
The last day Bob was home, he and Meg
went for a long walk in the bush. They took
their lunch and a billy, for this was to be a
real picnic.
I have not time to tell you much about
the wonderful day they had together; but you
already know what a jolly place Bushland is,
and perhaps you also know that there the
birds seem to be having a concert every day.
But, this day, Meg thought, as she listened to
love-songs, that never before had they
sung so well!
Perhaps they knew Bob was going far
away across the sea, and wanted him, wher-
ever he went, to carry in his heart the echoes
of the wild Bushland music!
They both felt that they must make the
very most of every minute, for to-morrow
they must part; and if, to Meg, all the well-
known things seemed to be even lovelier than


usual, maybe it was because of an unspoken
fear of the loneliness that would be hers when
Bob was gone.
By-and-by, they found the very place to
have lunch?a lovely bank, covered with
maiden-hair, and toadstools, and moss.
It was so pretty that Meg declared that
she really and truly believed that the fairies
themselves had planted it, and that maybe it
was the very porch of Fairyland. Bob agreed
that it was quite likely, but said that they
must wait till after he came home again to
make sure, as Meg was certainly too tired to
walk any further just then, and, besides, he
was much too hungry.
So they set to work to light the fire, and
it was great fun making the billy-tea.
Then Bob took Meg on his knee, and they
did enjoy their lunch. Mother seemed to
have thought of all the things they liked best!
When they had eaten all they wanted, and
had fed all the lizards and birds with crumbs


and sugar, Bob took from one of his big
pockets a fine box of colored crayons and a
small drawing-book. He told Meg that he
had brought them home from Melbourne for
her. He showed her how to draw a toadstool
with a yellow lining, and a kookaburra that
laughed at them from a gum-tree, and a fat
green frog that panted with fear when Bob
held him in his hand!
It was a tired little Meg who laid her head
on the pillow that night, and when her mother
heard her laughing in her sleep, she knew
that the kind Dream-Angel was whispering
to the child of the happy day that was past,
and not of the sorrowful one that was coming
so swiftly.


CHAPTER 111.
Passing the Time.
After Bob had gone Meg missed him
dreadfully, and was so restless and unhappy
that Mother thought it would be better for
her to start going to school again; but then
came the news that the little bush school was
to be closed. All the children who were old
enough would have to go to the big brick
school three miles away, but that was much
too far for Meg; so it was plain there would
be no more school for her for quite a long
while.
But Meg soon found that there were
many ways of passing the time.


Letters and post-cards started to come
from Bob, and wasn?t she glad she had learned
to write so that she could answer them!
She spent hours and hours writing about
all the things she knew he would like to hear.
Mother would tell her how to spell the hard
words, and in every letter she would put
drawings prettily colored with the crayons
he had given her.
Meg always printed the names plainly
underneath, lest he should think the fowls
were a flock of parrots, or that oranges were
beginning to grow on the big gum-tree by
the gate; for those round yellow things were
really stars peeping through the branches at
night.
She found it very hard work to learn to
sew, for she so often pricked her fingers, and
knots would come in the cotton; but she kept
on trying till at last it seemed quite easy; and,
in every parcel Mother sent to Bob, there was

Nodrog?s long ears were very sharp




a soft brown handkerchief which Meg had
hemmed for him!
So the weeks and months slipped away
more quickly than she could have believed.
Sometimes she went for walks in the
bush, but not so often as she used to, for when
she thought of the happy days she had spent
there with her dear big brother who was
now so far away, she could not help feeling
lonely and sad.
One morning, when Meg and her mother
had risen very, very early, Meg went out in
the first pale light of dawn. She stood near
the gate, gazing, as she would often do, at
the place where she had caught the last flutter
of Bob?s handkerchief, as the coach disap-
peared over the hilltop, and longing for the
day when she would watch that spot for the
first sign of his return.
As she stood there, with aching heart
and swimming eyes, the sun rose slowly,


sending up rays of red and golden light which
rested like a crown of glory on that far-off bit
of brown road.


CHAPTER IV.
Nodrog
Now we?re coming to the fairies!
One sunny day Meg went for a long walk
into Bushland, and at last came to a bank she
knew ?the same lovely bank, still covered
with maiden-hair, and toadstools, and moss;
but, ah! Bob was not there, and as she remem-
bered the day she sat there on his knee, drink-
ing billy-tea, she felt she could no longer bear
to be without him, so she threw herself down
with her face in the moss, and cried?and
cried?and cried for Bob!
Poor little Meg! You?d hardly think a
little girl had so many tears!
By-and-by she turned her head, and, quite
close to her, there was a big brown toadstool
with a shiny green lizard lying on top of itjx


and under it there was ?what do you think?
a piled-up heap of white, sugary manna!
Ah! now the tears dried up, and her eyes
began to dance ?for she liked manna; but
she was just a weeny bit afraid of lizards, so
she tried to ?shoo? him off, but he only
wagged his head and stopped there.
Then, very carefully and slyly, she slipped
her hand up to the heap, and had just got the
nicest bit between her finger and thumb, when
she heard a sharp squeak, ?I say, drop that!?
And ?would you believe it??where the
lizard had been, there was the queerest little
man staring at her with big, round eyes.
She was so surprised that she blinked?
and?when she opened her eyes, there was
the green lizard once more.
queer! I believe I thought he was a fairy,
and??here she grabbed a piece of manna
and popped it in her mouth???l?m sure I wish
he were!?


As she spoke, in the very twinkling of
an eye, the lizard was gone, and there once
more was the mannikin, nodding solemnly at
her and saying:
?Now you?ve been and gone and done
What can?t so easily be undone?
These cakes of mine are a risky dish,
For, wish and taste, and you?ll get your
Meg felt a little afraid, for the wee man?s
nods looked a bit threatening?and then it
sounded so dreadfully clever to talk in poetry
?but she sat up very straight, and said, quite
politely:
?Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Fairy-Man,
but I like manna, and I was told the little
black locusts made it, so of course I couldn?t
know it was your cake, and for that matter,
you know, I didn?t even know it was you!??
She stopped, almost out of breath with such
a long speech, and waited for him to say some-
thing; but he only sat and looked at her. She


felt very uncomfortable until it came to her
that perhaps he was trying to think some more
poetry, and she knew how hard that was,
because she herself had had to try once, for
the Teacher-Girl.
So she looked about her, trying to seem
quite at ease, and all of a sudden it seemed to
her that the bird-songs had never sounded so
sweet ?and never had she seen so many butter-
flies and flowers ?and was it her fancy, or
did she catch stray glimpses of wings more
bright than any butterfly?s?
She felt rather puzzled by so much beauty,
and, turning to her new acquaintance, she
said, shyly, ?Please, it?it?s a fine day, isn?t
it???
The answer came so sharply that she
jumped:?
?All but a dunce would understand
It?s always fine in Fairy-land!


him, for no one had ever spoken to her like
that before.
?I?m not a dunce, and even if you are a
fairy, I think you are very rude, and I don?t
like you, so there!??
At this, the little man laughed and laughed
till Meg could not see the top of his face at all
?and this made her realize that she was look-
ing up at him.
Oh dear, oh dear! How she had shrunk!
At last he managed to pull a straight face
and said, teasingly:
?Hoighty, toighty! Meg, my dear,
You are a dunce, or you?d not be here;
For now you?ve come, you?ll stay, you
The king will never let you go!?
Meg felt sad at these words ?for she felt
there was somebody she wanted even more
than the fairies, if only she could remember
who it was!


CHAPTER V.
The King s Promise.
But she had no time to think any more
about it just then, for all at once the air
seemed full of the sound of bugles and drums,
as if an army were coming; and the little man
smoothed his hair and straightened his wings,
and stood up straight and smart like a soldier.
Meg listened closely and thought she could
hear clear little voices calling out, ?Long live
the king!? And then came, marching round
a big gum-tree, a whole host of fairies and
brownies; some were on foot and some were
mounted, and in the very front came the king
himself, driving in his own wonderful chariot.
Meg could hardly believe her eyes when


she saw that wonderful procession. The
wheels of the king?s chariot were round, pink-
lined mushrooms, while the seat was of egg-
shell, and alongside marched jaunty attendants
holding over him a dainty cob-web canopy.
Perhaps the quaintest and most wonder-
ful thing about this royal chariot was the
steed to which it was harnessed. He was a
big green mantis that pranced along with
head high, as if proud to think that a king
rode behind him.
Some of the fairies went dancing along
on foot; some used their own dainty and
delicate wings; while others were mounted
in the queerest fashion! They were actually
riding on frogs, and dragon-flies, and grass-
hoppers!
But what delighted Meg most of all were
the cunning little brownie bandsmen with
their strange bugles and drums.
I wonder have you ever, in the heart of


BusKland, heard those tiny drummers, with-
out for a moment dreaming that the fairies
were passing by?
As soon as they saw Meg and her com-
panion, all the fairies stood stock still and
stared at them, and the king said, in a stern
voice:
?Nodrog, you knave! Where have you
been so long??
The little man went forward, bowed him-
self before the king, and began speaking in
a low voice. Meg knew that he was talking
about her, for the king kept looking at her,
and soon he stepped out of his chariot, came
forward, and, taking her hand, said, ?You
were very foolish to come into my kingdom
without being invited, but your looks please
me, lovely maiden?and I must try to make
you happy. Pray tell me why you were
crying when Nodrog found you. Whatever
you wanted, you shall have it at once!?


Meg felt very nervous, and wished that
Nodrog were near her, but he was standing
back among the other fairies, and the king
was waiting for an answer, so at last she
managed to say, ?Please, your Majesty?l
was lonely!?
?Lonely!? he said, in a scornful voice.
?How silly! But a king?s word may not be
broken, so tell me whom you wanted to see
?and you shall have your wish!?
At these words Meg?s heart stood still ?
and then went thumping joyfully?for wasn?t
that what she wanted more than anything
else in the world?
But ?alack and alas! ?would you believe
it? ?she could not for the life of her
remember who it was she wanted to see. Oh
dear, oh dear! Now she was missing the
chance of a lifetime. Whatever should she
do? She wrung her hands, and racked her
brains; but it was of no use, she could not


remember, and the king?s face was becoming
red and angry-looking, for he was not used
to being kept waiting. So she thought she
had better say something, even if it were not
quite right, and, do you know, the only people
whose names she could remember were folk
who lived in a book somebody gave her?oh!
now she nearly had it ?who was it gave her
the book?
But just then the king made an impatient
movement as if he were going to slap her,
and she jumped, and blurted out, ?Oh ?I
wanted Red-Riding-Hood and Goldilocks, and
?and ?some other people who live in a book
of mine.?
The king looked quite pleased at this,
and said, ?Oh! well, that?s all right. They
all belong to my kingdom. 1 was afraid you
might ask for someone who does not live in
Fairy-land, for then 1 should have had to let
you go away; but now you will be able to


stay here for ever, Nodrog, come! Take the
maiden to see these people she wishes for.
and afterwards bring her along to my palace.?
Nodrog came and stood beside her, and
the king and his company passed on with a
great flourish of trumpets and prancing of
steeds, and left Meg and Nodrog alone once
more.
She looked about her with a strange feel-
ing of being lost ?till Nodrog took her hand,
and said, very gently, ?Come along, Meg!?
Then she found herself swiftly flying
through the air, and it felt so delightful that
she forgot everything else and laughed aloud
for glee.


CHAPTER VI.
Old Friends.
Soon they came to earth again by an
open, grassy place, with trees and ferns
all round, and lovely spider orchids, and
monkey-violets and early Nancies peeping
out everywhere from shady corners. When
Meg looked closely at them she saw that they
were real little faces set on slender bodies,
with delicate green wings folded about them,
and she cried out, ?Why, Nodrog, are the
flowers all fairies too??


He nodded and smiled, and chanted the
following little song in his clear voice:
?Flower-fairies, shyly peeping,
Open eyes so sharp and bright,
And whether you?re awake or sleeping
Watch you always?day and night.
And all the flowers also nodded and
smiled at her to let her know it was true.
She was just thinking of all the bunches
she had picked, and hoping it didn?t hurt
much, when she heard a voice singing a sweet
song.
She peered about her, but could not see
anyone, and when she asked Nodrog who it
was, he only laughed at her, and said, Wait
and see!?? And the sight that soon met her
eyes was well worth waiting for, for who
should come walking in but Red-Riding-Hood
herself, and this was the song that she sang:


' Everybody knows my name,
And knows my story, too;
But even fame gets somewhat tame,
It?s time for something new!
Meg felt so joyful at seeing one she had
loved for a long time, but had never hoped
to meet, that she was just going to rush out
and introduce herself, when Red-Riding-Hood
called out, in a happy voice:
?Here comes a lassie that I know!
Hurrah! Now things won?t be so slow!
Dear Goldilocks ?how do you do?
I?m very glad to welcome you.
Goldilocks came dancing in, with her won-
derful hair floating round her, and, as she
came, she sang merrily:

?Good day to you,
Red-Riding-Hood.
How gay is life,
When girls are good?
And good and glad
We?ll be to-day,
For wolves and bears
Are far away!??
She suddenly stopped singing and listened,
for a sound of sobbing was heard, and Nodrog
whispered to Meg:
Oh! can she be hungry?
Or has she been bad?
The new-comer carried a long crook in
one hand, and a very wet handkerchief in the
other, and as she came she wailed out:


?Has anyone seen my woolly sheep?
I don?t know where to find them!
I?m worried so, I cannot sleep?
I?m sure I tried to mind them!??
The kind hearts of Red-Riding-Hood and
Goldilocks were touched by her sorrow, and
they ran to comfort her. Soon she was able
to smile at them through her tears, and she
said, in quite a cheerful voice:
?Well, if the pesky things will hide,
I guess that I?ll just let them bide!
Why should 1 grieve the whole day through?
I?ll just stay here, and play with you!?


CHAPTER VII.
More of Them
She had hardly finished speaking when a
little lady, who seemed to be limping a bit,
and who was wearing a wonderfully lovely
dress, came in. The others went to meet her,
and she said to them:
?Dear Maidens! Tho? perhaps you know
I love the ball-room gay,
Where lights, and eyes, and jewels glow
Until the break of day,
Just now, no dancing I may do,
For see! I?ve lost one little shoe!
So, if you?ll only be so kind,
Pray let me stay with you
Until my charming Prince shall find
His Cinderella true!?


?I?m glad to meet you, pretty maids,
I?ve been alone since morn ?
And was feeling rather weary
Of blowing up my horn;
out:


However, Blue-Beard, for it was he, took
no notice of Boy-Blue, but walked right in,
and, bowing low, said:
I would not seek another bride
For years ?and years?and years!
For happiness I long have sought,
But ?tis a bird not easily caught.
Ah, ladies dear! your looks are kind?
Be to my faults a little blind!
Pray let me join this band so gay,
And spend at least one happy day!?
The girls put their heads together, and,
after a few moments? whispering, Goldilocks
stepped forward and said:
?Well, Blue-Beard, you with us may stay,
And, for to-day, may with us play;
But mind! Just in a friendly way!?


At this, Boy-Blue stepped back and said
no more, but he did not look very pleased,
and perhaps there might have been trouble;
but there was a sudden crackling of twigs, and
a girl came rushing in with wide-open eyes
and a scared look on her face.
They crowded round her to see what was
the matter, and as soon as she got her breath,
she said:
?Oh! I have had an awful fright!
A great, big spider did alight
Right near me ?on my tuffet!
I never shall forget the sight?
I nearly was a dead Miss Muffet!
But now, dear playmates, you will cheer me,
Then she peered nervously about her and
said:
?I hope that beast is nowhere near me!?


At this, Blue-Beard threw back his head
and laughed loud and long, for there, clinging
to the back of her dress, was the spider, and
she had brought him with her all the way!
However, before Miss Muffet could find out
what he was laughing at, Boy-Blue had
brushed the spider off, and even Miss Muffet
had to laugh to see how quickly that spider
ran out of sight, when Boy-Blue chased him.


CHAPTER VIII.
Meg in the Moon
All this time, Meg had hardly dared to
breathe for fear that she would wake up and
find that it had all been a lovely dream. But
now, she put out her hand and touched
Nodrog, to make sure he was real, when she
noticed that he was staring up into the sky,
so she looked up too ?and saw what do you
think? Why?the moon ?looking like a
bright silver boomerang, and growing larger
and larger every moment, for wonderful to
tell, it was coming down!
Meg rubbed her eyes, for surely this was
too good to be true! But no ?when she
looked again she could see the pale face of
the Man-in-the-Moon looking down.


By this time the other little folks had seen
the wonderful sight, and they were all gazing
up silently and eagerly?for, even in the magic
world they lived in?this was something new
and strange.
The moon came sailing down nearer and
nearer, until it was lower than the tops of the
tallest ferns that grew around the clearing.
Then it stopped still, and the Man leaned
right out and, after having a good look at all
the company, began to sing this queer, sad
little song to them:
?I live right up in the sky, you know;
They sent me up there long, long ago,
When the sad old world was young and gay,
And I?ve never been back until to-day!
But when I saw this meeting glad,
It made me, oh! so lonely and sad!
So, as I?d nothing to do for an hour or two,
I just left the sky, and sailed down to you!
But soon I must hurry back once more
To light up the world when day is o?er.


Here Meg could contain herself no longer,
but walked right out into the middle of the
party. Nodrog followed, looking a little
cross, for he had not meant her to show her-
self.
But they were not a bit surprised at seeing
her, and when he started to introduce her to
them, they all seemed to know her quite well,
and smiled at her, and stroked her hands and
her hair. Then they began to dance round
her, singing a tune she knew very well indeed
?but the words were quite different!
?Sing a song of Fairy-land,
And of playmates gay!
For we?ve met together
Ere this happy day!
We?ve met you oft in Dream-land,
And in Book-land too,
Oft we?ll meet hereafter
Our friendship to renew!


In the days of childhood,
We are loved full well?
Often too in Grown-up-land
If they?d only tell!
And where?er you may be,
When other friendships pall,
We will always come to you,
If you?ll only call!?
While they were singing, a wild and won-
derful wish came into the heart of Meg, and
she whispered: ?Oh, dear, dear Nodrog! I
do want to sit in the moon.?
At first Nodrog was not willing, but
she begged so hard that, at last, he took
her hand, and, before she could wink, there
she was, to her great joy, sitting beside
the Man-in-the-Moon. He looked at her
with his sad eyes, and Meg felt so sorry
for him that she slipped her hand into his
and said: ?Poor Man-in-the-Moon, I?m so


sorry that you feel lonely up in the sky. But,
then, I should think you would always be able
to see anyone you wanted to! Now, with a
puzzled frown, ?there is someone I want to
see very, very much, if only I could remember
who!?
But she had no time to think then, for he
leaned towards her and whispered:
?Come right back to the sky with me,
And never more will we lonely be!
Meg s eyes shone! Up to the sky! Why,
that would be even better than Fairy-land?
but it was not to be!
Nodrog?s big ears were very sharp, and,
before she knew what had happened, he had
hold of her hand?and she found herself on
the ground with a bump. Nodrog stood there
looking very angrily first at her, and then at
the Man-in-the-Moon, and as soon as he could
speak for temper, he said ?and for once he
forgot to speak in poetry ? Home you come


to the palace this moment! A nice fix I?d be
in if you went sailing off to the sky! As for
you,? turning to the Man-in-the-Moon, ??the
king will see that this shall be your last trip
down here, you white-faced, thieving knave!?
He seized Meg?s hands, in spite of all her
struggles to free herself; and, although all the
little folk begged him to stay longer, and said
that they had hardly started to play, and that
Meg had not even been introduced to Jack and
Jill, who had come in while they were singing,
he simply would not listen to them, but off he
flew with her, and they were quite a long way
on their journey before his anger started to
cool.


CHAPTER IX.
The Time Fairies
At first Meg was so cross at being whisked
off in such a hurry that she would not
speak to Nodrog, or even look at him,
but they were passing by so many pretty
things that she began to forget her disappoint-
ment, and many times she wanted to ask him
to stop, only she was too hurt to ask him a
favor.
But at last she saw something so beautiful
that she quite forgot she was offended, and
cried out, ?Oh, dear Nodrog, what?s that??
Now Nodrog, who was really a very kind
and good-tempered little fellow, was very glad
to make up their quarrel, so he stopped at
once, and said: ?Why, Meg, those are the Time
Fairies?l thought you knew some of them


quite well! This is their workshop, and what
they do here makes a great difference to all
the people who live in the world. We won?t
stop long, for they are very powerful, and I
believe even the king is a little bit afraid of
them. At any rate, he?ll never let them inside
his palace, so all the rest of the fairies keep
away from them.?
There stood the biggest mushroom Meg
had ever seen. It had a flat top, and round
the edge were black markings that made a
kind of border that seemed to remind Meg of
something she had seen before; and six beauti-
ful fairies danced about the black markings.
The one nearest to Meg wore a dress of
delicate pink, while her wings had, I think,
all the lovely colors there are, and the veining
was of gold; she had a happy, eager face, and
she carried in her hand a slender wand tipped
with fleecy pink stuff, from which rose lovely
golden rays of light.
?That is Fairy Dawn,? whispered Nodrog.


Slowly Meg turned her eyes to the next
one, whose name was Daylight. Meg noticed
the firm and earnest face, and felt that she
would be able to do great deeds. She was
dressed from head to foot in shining gold, and
when Meg looked at the top of her wand, it
was so dazzling that she had to turn away
her eyes at once.
After so much brightness it was very
pleasant to look at the next fairy, who had a
very gentle face, and kind gray eyes, and silver
hair. She wore a dress made of all the soft
tints of gray and lavender, with soft ruffles
of white?and at the top of her gray wand
was just one gem, gleaming with a soft sheen
like a pearl.
?Twilight!? whispered Nodrog, but of
course Meg knew already.
The next fairy was called Starlight, and
her dress was of a deep, tender blue, gleaming
with jewels, while Fairy Moonshine shone
with silver from her head to her heels! They

were both beautiful, and Meg hardly knew
which she loved best. The last fairy was
called Midnight. She was dressed in black,
the soft folds being caught here and there
with a tiny diamond.
Her large, dark eyes shone with a strange,
wild beauty, but Meg felt a wee bit afraid of
her, and felt glad when Daylight began to
sing:
?I, the golden Sunshine Fairy
Watch the children all the day;?
Sad at heart when they are naughty,
Glad, when they are good and gay I
And in the rosy flush of morning
Or the gloaming?s tender gray
Dawn and Twilight keep the record
Of all the children do and say.
Here Moonlight took up the song:
?When the gentle Twilight Fairy
Slowly veils her sweet gray eyes,
The million eyes of merry Starlight
Wink and twinkle in the skies.


Or I, the shining Moonlight Fairy
Take my turn as sentinel,
Sending keen and silvery glances
O?er each hill and through each dell.
Even when the world is silent
Wrapped in darkest shades of night,
Dusky Midnight?s eyes are watching,
Naught is hidden from her sight.
Then all the fairies sang together:
?So, dear Meg, be very wary,?
Let no evil spirit near!
Then each watching, listening fairy
Naught but good shall see and hear.
Then shall come the sweet Joy Fairy
Seeking you on radiant wing,
And within your heart for ever
She will sit and softly sing.?
Here they all smiled at Meg and beckoned
to her, and Nodrog grabbed her hand and
cried, ??Oh, my life! They?ll be wanting you


next! Come on, Meg! We?ve been here
quite long enough!?
Off he flew with her, though Meg would
gladly have stayed. As they went, she looked
back longingly to the beautiful fairies, and the
last thing she saw was the top of Dawn?s wand
?and what a sharp pain of remembrance
stirred in her heart as she looked at those rays
of golden light!?but just what it was they
reminded her of she really did not know.


CHAPTER X.
The Fairy Palace
The fairy king?s palace was wonderful!
It was enclosed by many fine fairy-rings of
mushrooms. I can?t begin to tell you about
the wonderful colors and shapes of those
mushrooms ?and, on each one, stood a fairy
sentry who took fine care that none but the
right people got past. There were strange,
lovely flowers and ferns, while the grass was
as fine and soft as velvet; and the air was full
of music and laden with sweet odors!
But the palace itself! Well, Meg says it
looked as if it were made of bubbles and
moonbeams!


She and Nodrog walked in between long
rows of fairies, and to Meg?s surprise, they
bowed very low as she passed. She soon
found out the reason, for when they came in
front of the king s throne, he came to meet
her, and, taking her hand, said:
?Welcome home, lovely maiden! We
have just decided that you shall be the new
queen of Fairy-land. The last queen got
much too fond of asking questions, so now
she has a nice comfortable little Fairy-land of
her own, and I have been looking for some-
one to take her place. Fairies! Behold your
queen!??
At this all the fairies began to shout a song
of welcome, and there was such a babel of
voices, and blowing of bugles, and beating of
drums, that Meg became quite confused and
frightened. Besides, she did not want to be
queen of the fairies ?she was not even sure
that she wanted to stay in Fairy-land any


longer. She knew there was something she
wanted much more, if only she could remem-
ber what!
Well, to make a long story short, she
turned away from the king and all the shout-
ing fairies, and clung to Nodrog and hid her
face on his breast, and would have wept, only
she had not a single tear. There are no tears
in Fairy-land, you know!
Then there was a fuss! Nodrog, who had
been looking very crest-fallen, at once stood
up straight and strong and put his arm round
Meg, and looking the king bravely in the face,
told him that he had found Meg first and he
meant to look after her; ?and, if she did not
want to be queen, he did not think anyone
should force her to; anyway, it was only fair
to let her know Fairy-land a bit better first.
Oh, the king was angry! He raised his
hand as if he were going to send Nodrog spin-
ning into the middle of next week?but some


of the wise old fairies agreed with Nodrog;
so at last it was decided that Meg should have
a little longer to make up her mind; but the
king was too displeased to let her remain near
him.
He said she should have a week to think
over her folly, and, as there was no such thing
as time in his palace, she must of course go
somewhere else.
He turned to a messenger, and said: ?Go
to the Time Fairies and command them to
prepare a prison for this wilful maiden! They
must be her warders for a week, and let them
see that they guard her closely!?
Then, turning to Meg, ?I hope, madam,
that you will learn sense there?but I?m not
at all sure that I want you for queen now! As
for you,? looking sternly at Nodrog, ?for your
boldness you shall be banished from Fairy-
land for the next hundred years?but, first,
you may take the maiden to her prison. Go!?


CHAPTER XI.
In Prison
Meg and Nodrog passed out sadly and
silently between the rows of fairies, and were
well out of the palace and near the hall of the
Time Fairies before either one spoke.
Then Meg told him how sorry she was that
she had got him into trouble, and how lonely
she would be without him, and asked him to
take her with him. He shook his head sadly
and told her that he had not the power,
but, if she could only get out of Fairy-land, she
might be quite sure he would always be near
her to serve her, even if she did not know him;
but, of course, if she stopped in Fairy-land, he
would not be able to see her for a hundred
years!


They were now at the end of their journey,
and they knew they must say ?Good-bye.?
Meg grasped his hand, and cried out, ?Oh,
dear, dear Nodrog! Tell me, before you go,
how can I get out of Fairy-land!?
Nodrog looked about him and hesitated
for a moment ?then he came close up and
whispered, ?It?s against the rules to tell, but
Meg if you can remember who it was you
were thinking about last, before you stepped
inside Fairy-land, then the fairies lose all
power to keep you with them?and don?t for-
get, Meg, that the king promised you, on his
royal word, that, if you could remember what
you wanted, you should have your wish. Meg,
Meg, TRY TO REMEMBER!?
Then he turned to Fairy Dawn, who came
forward to claim Meg, and cried: ?Oh, Dawn!
Beautiful Dawn! HELP HER TO REMEM-
BER.
And Dawn smiled so sweetly on them
both, that hope crept once more into their sad


hearts, and their parting was almost cheerful
after all.
Meg found that her prison was set in the
very center of the ring of Time Fairies. When
she saw it first she thought it was a bubble,
with curious markings on it like some which
she felt sure she had seen before somewhere.
But before she had time to look much at it,
she found herself inside, and discovered that
there was no room to walk about, and there
was only one window through which she could
100k ?so, of course, she could only see one
fairy at a time.
At first Meg felt quite comfortable, and
rather enjoyed the rest after all the excitement
and bustle; it was a beautiful sight to watch
the Time Fairies slowly changing places with
each other, as each one in turn took up her
watch before Meg s window; but, by the time
they had each had a couple of turns as warder,


Meg had grown tired of keeping still?and she
found Daylight a bit dazzling, and Midnight
rather weird.
But now, at last, she had time to try and
solve the puzzle that had been worrying her
Who was she? And where did she live before
Nodrog found her? And who was it she
wanted so badly that she had wept away her
memory, and almost, it seemed to her, her
very heart?
She struggled with the problem until she
thought her head would burst?but it was all
in vain! Then she would question each of the
fairies in turn, time after time, but they gave
her no reply?only looked at her, sometimes
kindly, and sometimes as if they did not care
at all!
Time was going on, and she knew that,
when Dawn came round for the seventh time,
she would have to go back to the palace?and,
somehow, although she loved fairies, she did
not want to go?you see she knew that, hidden


away in her heart, was something she wanted
so much more, if only she could remember
what it was!
Poor little Meg?she began to despair!
It was only when Dawn smiled in at her win-
dow that Hope would revive in her heart ?
and then she would stretch out her hands and
cry, ?Oh, dear Dawn! Help me to remem-
ber!?
The sight of the rays of beautiful light that
rose from the fairy?s wand always set her
heart beating fast, for every time she felt that
she would know next moment what they
reminded her of. But Dawn stayed such a
little while, always passing on before she had
quite remembered, and then her heart would
ache with disappointment!
The last day came, and Meg knew that in
the next few hours she must solve the problem
or stay in Fairy-land for ever ?and she was so
weary with the struggle that she felt she
would be glad when it was settled for good?
one way or the other!


CHAPTER XII.
The Wand of Dawn
All that day she gave neither herself nor
the Time Fairies any rest ?again and again
she went over and over all that had happened
since Nodrog had found her?but what came
before was quite a blank. None of the fairies
could help her a bit?and she knew that when
Dawn looked in, the fairies would come for
her, but, Oh dear, Oh dear I there was someone
she wanted to see far more than the fairies!
For once she waited in fear for Dawn?
for she felt that all she loved best would soon
be lost to her for ever, and it was a trembling
little Meg who looked out that morning into
the smiling face of the Dawn fairy, who


seemed to be bending towards her in an eager
manner, as though anxious to help her!
Now she could hear the bugles and drums
of the fairies who were coming for her. Oh
dear, Oh dear! She was sure that if she only
had one minute longer she would remember.
Just as the king?s messengers swung into
sight, and Meg?s last hope died in her heart,
Dawn raised her wand?and then ?as the
child?s despairing eyes rested on those golden
rays of light, they seemed to grow brighter
and more familiar-looking every moment ?
and the fairy slowly faded out of sight?and
the elfin-music died away ?and peace stole at
last into Meg?s troubled heart; for only those
glorious rays remained, and she had solved
the puzzle, for this is what they looked like?
the beautiful badge Bob wore on his hat!


While she gazed at it with eyes almost
blinded with tears of joy, it gradually changed
its shape until it looked like this?
She timidly stretched out her hand to
touch it, and found that it was real?and that
a real brown hand was holding it up before
her; then she heard a voice (Oh, Joy! It was
Bob?s) ?saying, ?Meg, Meg, wake up and see
what I?ve brought all the way from France.
?Oh, my dear little sister, all night I?ve
been searching for you?and how I longed for


i Jr
Dawn to come and help me to find once more
the ?Porch of Fairy-land,? for somehow I felt
sure I should find you here!?
Then Meg felt herself held in strong arms
and being half smothered with kisses ?and she
knew that the king had kept his word?that
Bob was home again?and oh! how glad she
was that she had remembered in time, for she
felt that it was better to have a big brother like
Bob than to be queen of all the earth, or even
of Fairy-land!
