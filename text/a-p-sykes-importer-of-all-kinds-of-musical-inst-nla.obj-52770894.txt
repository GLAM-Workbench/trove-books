THE GROVER TONE RING.
The Grover Tone Ring is the great-
est tone-increasing invention ever
known. With this Tone Ring, the
head can be instantly tightened by
turning the thumb-screws. It is the
only tone ring that can be instantly
attached to any banjo. “Tone Rings”
that form a complete circle decrease
the tone volume. The Grover Tone
Ring leaves the entire head free to
vibrate, and by tightening the head,
increases the volume of tone. Will
not injure the head or throw the
bridge out of position. Will fit in-
struments from 9 to 12 inches in
diameter. For all wire string banjo
instruments.
No. 1- —Grover Tone Ring. Each 25/-.

never be removed.
