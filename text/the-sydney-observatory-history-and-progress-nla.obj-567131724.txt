We are told by Col. Collins in his history of New South
Wales that “ Among the buildings that were undertaken
shortly after our arrival must he mentioned an Observatory,
which was marked out on the western point of the cove,
to which the astronomical instruments were sent, which had
been sent out by the Board of Longitude for the purpose of
observing the comet which was expected to he seen about
the end of this year. The construction of this building was
placed under the direction of Lieut. Dawes, of the Marines,
who, having made this branch of science his peculiar study,
was appointed by the Board of Longitude to make astrono-
mical observations in this country.” It is subsequently
recorded that “ the Observatory was erected as soon as the
colonists landed, but being afterwards * found small and in-
convenient, as well for the purpose of observing as for the
residence of Lieut. Dawes and the reception of the astrono-
mical instruments, a new one was built of stone, the
materials for which were found in abundance upon the spot.”
The comet for which all these preparations were made was
that which had been observed in 1532 and 1661, and which
was generally expected to return about the end of 1788 or
the beginning of 1789. It was one of the twenty-four which
Dr. Halley had used in his celebrated investigation, in which
he proved that comets were subject to the then new law of
gravitation and like all other astronomical bodies revolved
about some centre. In 1786 Maskelyne pointed out that
this comet would be affected by the major planets, and that
for the investigation of this important matter it was very
desirable that it should be observed in the Southern
Hemisphere, where it would first be visible; hence the
establishment of the Dawes’ Point Observatory, the first on
Australian soil, and strange to say standing on the same
headland as the present Sydney Observatory. We are not
told what was done at the Dawes’ Point Observatory, but no


doubt a great deal of useful work in determining the position
and other things committed to Lieut. Dawes’ care; for we
know that he was a most energetic officer, as was particularly
evidenced by his early attempts to find a road over the
Blue Mountains, the great barrier to the progress of the
Colony; and though he failed in this, like so many others, it
was not until he had made many journeys about these almost
inaccessible mountains that he gave up the enterprise.
Prom this time onward we hear nothing of the Observatory
at Dawes’ Point; but in 1821 Sir Thomas Brisbane was
made Governor of the Colony; always an ardent student of
astronomy, he had made himself familiar with the practice as
well as with the theory, and saw in his new appointment the
opportunity of indulging his love for the science; he was going
to a climate already famed for its clear skies and almost a new
field for the astronomer; La Caille had worked at the Cape
it is true, but with such inferior instruments that it was
obvious much must have been overlooked : under these cir-
cumstances Sir Thomas at his own cost provided a very com-
plete set of instruments, consisting of a Transit Instrument,
3f inches aperture and 61 inches focal length, a 2-feet mural
circle by Trougliton, a 16-inch repeating circle by Beichen-
bach, and an Equatorial of 3| inches aperture and 12 inches
focal length, mounted on Smeaton’s block; besides a valuable
astronomical library, and two first-class astronomical clocks,
one of which had been made originally at great cost for the
Brencli Commission of Longitude, also magnetic instruments
and other necessary apparatus. He then secured the services
of Mr. Carl S. Biimker, afterwards director of the Observa-
tory at Hamburg, and Mr. James Dunlop as assistant and
mechanic.
Immediately upon the arrival of Sir Thomas Brisbane, in
November, 1821, a site was selected for the Observatory in
the rear of Government House, Parramatta, close to the
present railway line where it cuts through the public park;
the building was begun at once and finished ready for use by
the end of April, 1822. It was a square building with a flat
roof and measured 28 feet on each side; the east and west
walls, as well as portions of the north and south sides were
straight, making a rectangular building; but on the north
and south sides the walls were in the middle built into a
curve, in order to support parts of the two domes, each lift.
6in. in diameter, which were placed above the flat roof of the
building; these projections in the walls gave the building


a remarkable appearance, which was not lessened by the
fact that each contained three small windows, the only lights
in it. Carefully made foundations, which still remain, were
prepared for the Transit and other instruments, and astro-
nomical work was begun on May 2nd, 1822. It is well-
known that the Observatory was placed in the immediate
vicinity of Government House, in order that the Governor
might devote every spare moment to his favourite study.
He took an active part in the work ; the most important part
of which was the formation of the Parramatta catalogue,
numbering 7,383 stars; for this every star had to be observed
at least twice, once with the transit and once with the mural
circle, and many were observed oftener. Besides this, special
observations of the solstice of 1822 and again of 1823 were
made, together with many occasional observations of comets,
etc. So much Avas done in the space of a few years that the
Royal Astronomical Society decided to present its gold medal
to Sir Thomas Brisbane and Mr. Dunlop as a mark of their
high appreciation of their labours. Sir John Herschel in
presenting the medal eulogized the “ care and skill with which
the observations had been made,” and said “ that they formed
one of the most interesting and important series which has
ever been made, and must ever be regarded as marking a
decided era in the history of modern astronomy.” Mr.
Rumker finally resigned and left the Colony in 1829, and
Mr. Dunlop was appointed in his place, which he continued
to hold until 1842. When Sir Thomas Brisbane left the
Colony in 1827, the Government purchased all his interest in
the Observatory, which was thenceforth carried on at the
expense of the Government.
In the early part of his career Mr. Dunlop was a most
energetic observer of double stars and nebulae and clusters of
stars; of these lie recorded 600, besides a large and valuable
list of double stars. In 1842 he resigned, and, no fresh ap-
pointment being made, the Observatory went rapidly to
decay; and in 1847 it was decided to dismantle it and remove
the instruments to Sydney, which was done, and they were
placed in the care of Mr. Dawson, chronometer-maker.
Before leaving the Parramatta Observatory it should be
mentioned that a careful drawing of it, to scale, was made
by the late Reverend W. B. Clarke, who always took a lively
interest in the scientific work that Avas done there; this
shows the plan and elevation as well as the positions of all
the instruments. In 1870 Mr. Tebbutt suggested that an


obelisk should he erected to mark the site of the Observatory,
hut no action was taken in the matter until 1875, when J.
S. Parnell, Esq., M.L.A., who had been long impressed with
the importance of permanently marking every point con-
nected with astronomical science or the Trigonometrical
Survey of the Colony, seeing that the w r alls of the old Obser-
vatory, which was in his electorate, were fast disappearing,
induced the Government to place a sum of £l5O on the
Estimates for the purpose of erecting a suitable monument
to mark the site of the Parramatta Observatory. The
following gentlemen were appointed trustees of the w r ork :
“ Mr. James Squire Parnell, M.L.A., Mr. James Barnett,
Colonial Architect, Mr. H. C. Bussell, Government Astro-
nomer.” In execution of their trust, they have had erected
a veined white marble obelisk, exactly in the position
occujhed by the transit instrument in former years. On the
east side of the obelisk an outline diagram of the transit
instrument lias been engraved, and the following inscrip-
tion :—“ An Astronomical Observator was founded here
May 2, 1822, by Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, K.C.8.,
P. 8.5., Governor of New South Wales. This obelisk was
erected in 1880, to mark the site of the transit instrument in
that Observatory.”
During the later years of Mr. Dunlop’s career, work at the
Observatory had not been carried on with energy; and in
1840, the Government of the Colony decided to establish
complete meteorological observatories at the three important
points in their widely scattered domains; for at that time
New South Wales included what is now Victoria, and also
what was more recently made into the Colony of Queens-
land. The three points were Sydney, at South Head; Port
Macquarie, an important settlement; and Port Phillip, now
within the Colony of Victoria, and then a recent and prosper-
ous settlement. At Ports Macquarie and Phillip, the observ-
ations were carried on for six years, and at Sydney for fifteen
until 1855, at which date the observer left the Colony.
Sir William Denison arrived in the Colony, January 20th,
1855; and there seems to he no reason to doubt that his
energy in astronomical and meteorological observations
induced the observer at South Head, who had been for years
working in a groove, and was disinclined for change, to
resign and leave the Colony. In March, 1855, His Excel-
lency addressed a memorandum to the Executive Council
suggesting the appointment of an astronomer wholly sup-


ported by the Colonial Government. The Council concurred
in the proposal made by His Excellency, and the matter was
at once submitted to the Legislature, and a sum of £7,000
was voted to provide buildings and instruments. The Bev.
W. Scott, M.A., of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, was
selected by the Astronomer Boyal to fill the office of Astro-
nomer for New South Wales. Mr. Scott arrived in Sydney,
November Ist, 1856, and at once selected a site for the
Observatory.
It was required that the time-hall should be visible from
the harbour generally, and that the Observatory should be
within easy reach of the other Government departments;
practically these conditions decided the question of site,
as the only suitable piece of Government land was on Flag-
staff Hill. For purely scientific reasons it would doubtless,
have been better to place it outside the city bounds to avoid
the dust, smoke, and vibration ; but considerations were
made subservient to the practical purposes for which the
Observatory was established. The building was commenced
in 1857, and finished in June, 1858; it is a handsome stone
structure; the eastern front comprises the Astronomer’s
residence. On the south or principal face there is a stone
tower 58 feet high, upon the top of which is the time-ball, 5
feet in diameter, and having a drop of 10 feet. Here also
are placed the self-registering anemometer and pluviometer.
Adjoining the tower on the east side is the meteorological
computing room, and on the west side the Transit Circle room,
24 feet by 16 feet, with two transit openings; and next to
this the Equatorial tower, which has three floors, and was
then covered by a dome 18 feet in diameter.
In June, 1858, meridian observations were begun with the
old transit instrument, one of the relics of Parramatta
Observatory, then the only available instrument; for transit
circle by Jones, which had been sent out new, and set up at
Parramatta but never used, had been sent to England to be
remodelled, and made ready for work.
During the building of the Observatory, Mr. Scott took the
opportunity to establish twelve meteorological observatories in
the principal centres of population ; two of these at Brisbane
and Bockhampton were subsequently transferred to the
Queensland Government; the others were maintained until
Mr. Smalley’s arrival in 1864 ; each station had a standard
barometer, wet and dry bulbs, max., min., and solar radi-
ation, and rain-gauge.


Owing to the imperfections of the astronomical instru-
ments at his command, Mr. Scott was at first obliged to
confine his observations to time determinations; no pro-
vision for new instruments had been made, and the only
instrument worth the name was the transit circle then on
its way from England; the small equatorial used at Parra-
matta was still in existence, hut its mounting was so worn
and dilapidated that it was useless. It was a fortunate cir-
cumstance that just then, October, 1858, the great’ comet of
Donati, one of the finest of this century, appeared in our
southern sky, and it was found that, although the Colony
had an astronomer, he had nothing hut a common sextant to
observe the comet; under these circumstances, the Parlia-
ment, with that liberality which has always marked its
provision for science, voted a sum of £BOO for a new equa-
torial ; and this was at once sent home to the Astronomer
Royal, with a request that he would purchase a suitable
instrument. He was fortunate in finding a new 7J-in. re-
fractor of 10ft. 4in. focal length in the manufactory of Mery
and Son, Munich, and this was purchased and sent to the
Colony, where it arrived in May, 1861, in fact just at the
time when Mr. Tebbutt announced the discovery of the great
comet of 1861, which rightly hears his name. The new
telescope was set up with all possible despatch, and the
comet was first observed with it on June 9th. Some repairs
to the old Parramatta equatorial had been effected, and
observations of the comet, prior to June 9th, made with it.
In October, 1858, the transit circle had arrived and was
mounted at once. Its graduated limb is 12in. in diameter,
telescope 3fin., with a focal length of 62 inches. This, with
the new equatorial mentioned above, furnished the Observa-
tory with all the astronomical instruments it was to get for
many years; and Mr. Scott at once set to work to make the
best use of the instruments in his possession by meridian
observations of stars near the zenith of Sydney and moon
culminations for the determination of longitudes and obser-
vations of such comets as were visible from time to time;
hut, as lie had only one assistant, the meridian observations
and meteorological work engaged all his attention. It soon
became manifest that the meridian circle, though good of its
kind, was faulty in several particulars, especially when
applied to determinations of the right ascensions of stars;
and that it was not equal to the meridian circle used at the
Cape of Good Hope in doing the same work ; and it became


a question with Mr. Scott, whether he should continue the
meridian observations or take up the observation of double
stars. The volume of results for 1859 contains 884 meridian
observations of stars, with many moon culminations, the
determination of the position of the Observatory, &c.; that
for 1860, 2,507; and for 1861, 2,100; in these volumes all
his comet work was also published. The work for 1861 was
less than for 1860, because some time had been devoted
to double star work for the reason just stated. It will he
seen from the number of observations that, with hut one
assistant for both astronomical and meterological work, Mr.
Scott must have worked with very great energy, in order to
get through so much. During part of the time also he
devoted some time to a class of students, who came to the
Observatory ostensibly to learn astronomy; but the attempt
was not a success; it was found that the gratuitous teaching
in mathematics was accepted; hut, so soon as astronomical
teaching began, the class ceased to exist.' These four years
of hard work had told seriously upon Mr. Scott’s health, and
early in 1862 he sent in his resignation.
Upon his resignation a request was sent home to Sir
George Airy, Astronomer Royal, to secure the services of an
astronomer for New South Wales. Meantime Mr. Russell,
who had joined the Observatory in 1859 as Mr. Scott’s
assistant, was made Acting Astronomer. He, having no
assistant, continued the meridian observations for time and
longitude only, and carried on the meteorological observa-
tions and reductions. During the opposition of Mars in 1862
he made a long and valuable series of micrometer measures
of that planet with stars on his path, but there was not time
to publish them before Mr. Smalley’s arrival, and they were
not published afterwards. At the end of 1863 the Acting
Astronomer designed and set up at the Observatory the first
self-recording anemometer in the Colonies. Special attention
was also given to the computation of such observations as
Mr. Scott had left unpublished; so that all this work and
all the meteorological observations might be cleared up when
the new astronomer arrived, and all were ready to go to
press by the end of 1863.
On the 7th January, 1864, Mr, George Roberts Smalley,
8.A., who had been selected by the Astronomer Royal to
take Mr. Scott’s place, arrived in the Colony. Mr. Smalley
had been for a time engaged as Magnetical Observer at the
Cape of Good Hope, and had spent some time at Greenwich


before leaving England. After an examination of the
meridian circle, and after hearing Mr. Scott’s report upon it,
Mr. Smalley determined not to devote his time to meridian
observations with an imperfect instrument, the more so as it
became evident that the blasting and quarrying operations
carried on within 100 yards of the Observatory caused
constant movement in the foundations. The only meridian
observations made by him therefore were such as were
required for time determinations, and with the Equatorial
the only observations were those of Encke’s comet,
published in the E. A. S. notices. He devoted considerable
time and attention to magnetical observations, and made
several journeys into the country for the purpose of deter-
mining magnetic variations at different places.
At this time an additional room was built for the As-
tronomer, and a cellar constructed for magnetical observa-
tions, and also a detached wooden house on the north side
of the Observatory, and in the meridian of the transit instru-
ment.
The meteorological work of the Observatory was improved
and extended, and a suitable shed or house made for the
thermometers. In 1867 he began the publication of the
Sydney observations monthly, in pamphlet form, a very
great improvement upon that in use before, but the
number of country stations was reduced, and foi a
time their observations were not published. Mr. Smalley
finding the unsatisfactory nature of the meridian instrument
used all his influence to induce the Government to commence
a trigonometrical survey of the Colony, which was urgently
required. At length he succeeded, and the work was en-
trusted to him, and reports were sent in from the surveyors
in various parts of the Colony showing the best sites for a
base line in each district. That at the south end of Lake
George was finally selected, cleared, roughly measured and
levelled. Before, however, it could be accurately measured
the waters of the lake rose and covered great part of it. This
involved selecting another line near it, but above the water.
In doing this there was necessarily more delay in clearing
and preliminary work, and when it was just ready to measure
another rise in the lake water covered it and again delayed
the work. The worry and annoyance of these delays, and the
trouble of carrying out such works so far from the city had
told seriously upon Mr. Smalley’s health, and during the latter
part of 1869 and all 1870 till his death in July of that yeai,


he was not able to do much to the work which he had
determined to carry out. During the time he was engaged
in the base line operations the work of the Observatory, both
astronomical and meteorological, had been left almost
entirely to Mr. Bussell, and the astronomical part of it was
necessarily confined to meridian observations for time.
Upon Mr. Smalley’s death, Mr. Henry Chamberlain
Russell, 8.A., who had been in the Observatory since
January, 1859, was appointed Astronomer.
Having had a share in all the work done with the Meridian
Circle and knowing its imperfections, he determined to con-
fine the observations made with it to those required for time
and longitude, and at once urged the necessity for a new
Meridian Instrument, a necessity which was kept constantly
before the Board of Visitors. Meantime observation of double
stars was taken up vigorously with the large Equatorial, the
working list being Herschel’s Cape Catalogue.
He next re-established the Meteorological Stations which
Mr. Smalley had discontinued, and then commenced system-
atically to increase the number of Meteorological Stations,
and to invite amateurs to join in the work of recording rain
and temperature.
In December, 1871, an important Solar Eclipse took place,
and the moon’s shadow crossed the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Professor Wilson, of the Melbourne University, proposed
that a colonial expedition should proceed to Cape Sidmouth
to observe it. Mr. Bussell entered heartily into the scheme,
and by the representations he made the Government of
Queensland were induced to lend their then new steamer,
“ Governor Blackall,” free of all expense, except that for
insurance, for the purpose of carrying the observers to Cape
Sidmouth. Mr. Bussell organised a strong party of observers
to represent New South Wales, and everything was ready for
the eclipse, when on the important day a thunderstorm
obscured the sun until it was over.
Prior to Mr. Smalley’s death active preparations were
going on in Europe for the then approaching transit of Venus,
but he had determined not to take part in it, and made no
preparations. When therefore in the latter part of 1870 Mr.
Bussell took office with a strong desire to engage in this work,
everything had to be done. The question had to be brought
before the Government and then before Parliament before
any steps could be taken to secure the necessary instruments.
Parliament liberally granted £I,OOO for this purpose, greater


part of which was expended upon the splendid llj-inch
refractor which the Observatory now possesses, and upon the
photoheliograpli made after the same pattern as those used
by the English observers. Besides these a number of minor
instruments were secured, making in all twelve instruments.
These were divided amongst four parties, located at Sydney,
Woodford, Goulburn, and Eden ; each party in addition to
the telescopes for observing the ingress and egress of the
planet was provided with the means of taking rapid photo-
graphs of the sun during the transit. Of the observers only
three came from the Observatory staff and the other nine
were volunteers who required more or less training for the
work. Eor this purpose regular practice upon an artificial
transit and in the photographic work was kept up for
some months, until all felt prepared for the work assigned to
them.
The weather proved all that could he wished, and ex-
tremely satisfactory observations of ingress and egress were
secured as well as some 1,300 photographs of Venus in
transit. These observations and photographs were a valuable
contribution to the data in the Astronomer Royal’s report on
the Solar Parallax.
The labour of preparation for this work had been com-
pressed as stated before into a very short time and had
involved great changes. The old dome had to he taken down
and a new one of metal 22 feet in diameter put up, and all
the necessary alterations made for the new equatorial chrono-
graphs had to he made; telescopes fitted up for the special work
and many minor pieces of apparatus, prepared in the Colony
under Mr. Russell’s personal supervision. This, together
with the training of the observers and the general care of
the undertaking proved a severe strain upon him, and he was
therefore given eight months’ leave of absence in order to
take the results of the observations in England. At the
instance of the Surveyor-General a sum of money £I,OOO,
was placed in Mr. Russell’s hands for the purchase of a new
transit instrument ; and after visiting all the makers in
Europe and examining their work he finally gave the order
to Messrs. Troughton and Simms, London, who produced a
splendid instrument with every modern improvement,
objective 6J inches, focal length 6 feet 8 inches, two circles of
21 inches, each read by four microscopes ; special precautions
were taken to prevent flexure and unsteadiness. In this
instrument the piers are made of hollow cast iron and there


is no provision for adjustment in level or azimuth, which is a
great improvement. The circles are so arranged that one can
he used to test the other, and the magnifying power of the
microscopes is 60 diameters. The axis is a very massive
casting in gun metal strengthened by internal braces, and
having steel pivots resting on segmental Ys; the ends of the
telescope are made as light as possible to avoid flexure. One
lamp placed at a distance illuminates the four microscopes
and the field of view, and at the eyepiece the illumination
can he changed from dark to bright wires at pleasure.
During the same trip opportunity was found to purchase
a very large spectroscope by Hilger, giving dispersion through
eighteen prisms and means and measuring one three-hun-
dredth part of the space between the D lines ; and also a
very large Rumkorff coil for the spectroscopic work and
many other pieces of apparatus. A large barrel chrono-
graph with the new compound pendulum governor lias been
made in the Colony, a very perfect barograph, and also a
meteorograph on which barometer, thermometer, wind, and
rain are recorded. In fact, since 1870, the Observatory has
been entirely refurnished with instruments of the most
modern and perfect forms, and although they are not equal
in size to some of the giant telescopes which have been
recently erected in Europe at enormous cost, they are quite
equal in quality to those in the best European Observatories,
as is proved by the observations now made with them.
When the Observatory was built one serious oversight in
the design was made. The tower for the equatorial was
placed due west of the Time Ball Tower; the effect of this
was that a part of the eastern horizon was hidden from the
large telescope, and on several occasions important observa-
tions of objects in the east had to be made with inferior
instruments. After the Equatorial was erected an
addition was made to the Observatory forming a west wing,
at the northern end of which a second dome was placed for
the 7J-incli refractor. This is in such a position that all parts
of the heavens hidden from the large refractor are visible
with it. Several additional rooms which were urgently
needed were provided at the same time, including one for
spectroscopic and kindred investigations.
In 1877, the new Transit Circle was received and at once
set to work upon stars for the Trigonometrical Survey,
and others near the Zenith for catalogue. During the first
year also it was used for observing stars and the planet Mars


in apposition, for the purpose of determining the Solar
Parallax. A long series of observations was made, which,
when combined with observations made at Washington, gave
8 - 885 as the value of the Solar Parallax.
The results for 1877 and 1878 with the observations of
Mars have been published; those for ’79, ’BO, and ’Bl are
ready for the printer. All the double star work up to 1881.
has been printed; it contains, besides measures of all the
important stars in Herscliel’s Cape Catalogue, south of the
Zenith of Sydney, a list of 350 new double stars which have
been discovered at Sydney.
In 1878, after seven years’ observations for the determina-
tion of the longitude of Sydney had been made, they were
finally discussed, and the result gave lOli. 4m. 50’81s. as the
longitude of the Sydney Observatory.
The effort to increase the Meteorological Observatories,
begun in 1870, has been highly successful; at present there
are fifty stations connected with the Observatory, and 240
private observers who regularly send returns; so that now
records are obtained from 290 points in the Colony, while in
1870 there were only six. This numerous band of observers
scattered over the Colony furnish data which form the
history of all local droughts, floods, and other meteorological
phenomena of importance.
The meteorological work at the Observatory, as will be
gathered from the instruments mentioned, has been made
much more complete.
Since 1878 the rain returns have been published in
pamphlet form, with a map showing localities, and a dia-
gram showing the result of daily observations of the princi-
pal rivers. This is an addition to the annual volume which
has also increased from eighty pages in 1870 to 200 pages of
closely printed matter in 1881.
In February, 1877, Mr. Russell began the publication of a
daily weather map which combines the observations of South
Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland,
giving in fact at one view the weather of all the Australian
Colonies. This took the place of a tabular statement which had
been previously printed in the Herald. An outline of Aus-
tralia showing the mountains and the reporting stations was
made up, partly in stereo and partly in type, so ingeniously


arranged that the whole could be prepared for printing in
less than two hours. Of these maps a sufficient number are
printed daily at the Observatory for the various Observa-
tories to which they are sent, and after that the Herald
takes a copy and reproduces it daily. The number of stations
reporting weather and also the area over which they extend
has gradually increased, and now there are fifty in New South
Wales and twenty-seven from the other Colonies, which include
New Zealand and the overland line in South Australia, in addi-
tion to those already mentioned. The maps thus produced
are invaluable in studying the weather, and are sent to all
the principal Meteorological Observatories. Eor the past
two years a diagram showing the state of the barometers all
round the coast has been added. This shows clearly the
progress of the usual storm centres which travel along the
south coast, and was instrumental in showing their character
and rate of progress.
In this very brief sketch of the Observatory, the works
published, as the outcome of what has been done, have not
been included in the text. It was thought better to arrange
them in tabular form, which will be more convenient for
reference.
In concluding this part of our subject it may be mentioned
the formal attempt to teach astronomy in a class has not
been repeated. Mr. Russell thinks that the object in view
can he better attained by the publication of such astron-
omical information as will excite interest in the subject, and
by freely giving instruction and advice to all who ask for it.
The experiment has proved very satisfactorily that the plan
is a good one. There are noAv in many parts of the Colony
amateurs who have been assisted in this way, and who are
finding in the study of astronomy pleasure and instruction,
and there are some who go beyond this and do valuable work.
The majority of the instruments in use are of 3-inch aperture,
but some are of 4-inch, 4J, 5, and even 6-inches aperture,
the latter a high class instrument, by Cooke, of York. Some
have chosen reflectors and have instruments of B|-inches,
and one Some of these are valuable instruments
with which important work has been done. It would be
difficult to compare the percentage of amateur observers here
with that in other places, England for instance; but it is
probable that the percentage of amateur astronomers is quite
as great here as in the older countries of Europe.
