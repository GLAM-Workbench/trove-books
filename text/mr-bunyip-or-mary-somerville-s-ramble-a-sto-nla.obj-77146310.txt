MR. ?BUNYIP:?
mmw Bmmwmm� iaiibij
A STO 11 Y F0 11 CII1L]) R E N,
(SKaIIY SO MERY ILLE?S School had broken up for the
Christmas holidays, and the more painstaking of the pupils
had received in a flutter of excitement their various prizes, ns
the reward of their industry during the past half-year. The
bosom friends of yesterday were to-day scattered far and wide,
carrying pleasure or pain, according as the report of their beha-
viour should he favorable or otherwise, into a hundred different
homes.
The day dreams in which the little folks had each indulged,
the visit to the distant relative, the excursion to the sea-side,
the pic-nic, or the innumerable home enjoyments, were each and
all upon the eve of their realization.
Mary had taken a prize, as she usually did, and had been
highly complimented upon her general good conduct, and was to


be transferred upon the re-assembling of the school to a higher
class. She had quite a little library of prizes in her bed-room,
which was a picture of neatness, and kept in order entirely by
herself. ? She was like a little woman about the house,? her
mother used to say. ? She could trust her to do anything? (and
she was only just turned eight), and as Mrs. Somerville?s time
was taken up with needlework, she fjund her little daughter?s
help invaluable to her. An early riser, the magpie?s note was
the signal for her to leave her bed, and then within ten minutes
she had said her morning prayer, and was washed, dressed, and
down stairs, ready to assist her mother in whatever might he
required to be done. You would never see her sitting up in bed
for a quarter of an-hour rubbing - her eyes and yawning, as some
young people do. ? Laziness is the root of all evil,? her father
used to say; ? Look at the bees, you see no idlers amongst them.?
The sun, too, is our great example in this respect Each
morning before most of us are up he commences his work,
giving us light and warmth, dispelling the mists which may
have accumulated during the night, and which if not removed
would he injurious to our health, ripening the corn, and per-
fecting the pretty flowers, ?causing the lark to pour forth his
flood of melody from his hearts? overflow of joy,?and then after
having performed his round of duties retiring to rest, to recom-
mence those duties on the morrow. The king upon his throne,
the merchant in his office, the miner digging deep into the
earth to bring forth its treasures, the mechanic at his bench, or
the little child at school, has each his duties to perform, and
cannot bo happy unless he perform them well. ? When you
work,? ?work;? her father would continue, ?And when you play,?
? play.? Do nothing by halves. ? Whatever is worth doing at
all, is worth doing well.? And she profited by her father?s
teaching. Always obedient, at Lome or at school, whatever she
was told to do she did without a murmur; and mothers would
say when their daughters displeased them, ? Ah, I wish you?d
take pattern by Mary Somerville.? Light-hearted and cheerful,
as people always are who do thait which is right, she seemed to
carry sunshine with her whenever she went, and was an


universal favorite.
At tlie time this story commences, she had received her
mother?s permission to go out for a ramble in the bush, so she
started oft with her basket on her arm, and her countenance lit
with happiness at the recollection other recent success at school,
to g?ather the pretty wild flowers with which the country was
then thickly studded. She was accompanied by her little dog
Fido, who was one of her three pets, the other two being- puss
and the canary, and she would as soon have thought of g-oing-
without her own meals as of neglecting to give them theirs. She
knew that God gives ns dumb animals for our use and pleasure,
and that therefore it is our duty to make them as happy as we
can. And Mary?s pets were never so happy as when she was
with them, because they knew she was kind to them, and
showed their gratitude to her in many ways.
As soon as Fido saw that his mistress had fairly started, he
commenced bounding about everywhere, and barking with
delight. He would pick up a stone, carry it some distance, drop
it upon the ground, and then with a paw on either side commence
barking furiously at it, as though it were some imaginary enemy
to whom he was expressing his? indignation. And so he would
continue the proceeding until he became tired, when he would
seek some other form of recreation, which would probably soon
present itself, in the shape of a bird, after which he would com-
mence an exciting chase, until it had risen from the ground and
soared high above his head, when he would stand still and watch
its upward progress in evident amazement, as though he were
saying to himself, ? However does he manage to do that ? After
having- sufficiently gratified his coursing propensities, he would
make for his young mistress, who would probably be upon
her knees gathering flowers, and pull her by the frock, to
express to her his desire that she should continue her journey.
?Be cpiiet, Fido,? she would say, hut it would be of no use,
he would still continue his attacks, occasionally retreating a yard
or two and then barking- at her as if in playful defiance of her
authority. At length she would yield to his wishes and resume


lier ramble, plucking a flower here, gathering gum from a tree
there, or collecting the sweet manna which lay at the trees?
roots, until she came to the banks of the Murray river, which
was about half-a-mile from her homo. Feeling tired the
weather being somewhat warm, and having, .in her butterfly-
like progress travelled over a deal of ground, she sat down upon
tue bank to rest. She had been sitting there some minutes
inspecting the newly acquired treasures in her basket and arran-
ging? her flowers in the form of a pretty bouquet, which she in-
tended as a pleasing surprise for her mother, singing the while
the following? song?; ?
?A fair little girl sat under a tree.
Sewing as long as her eyes could see ;
Then smoothed her work, and folded it right.
And said, dear work, good night, good night !
? Such a number of rooks flew over her head,
Crying, caw! caw ! on their way to bed ;
She said, as she watched their curious flight,
Little black things, good-night! good-night!
? The tall pink foxglove bowed his head,
The violets curtsied and went to bed;
And good little Lucy tied up her hair,
And said on her knees her favorite prayer.
? And whilst on her pillow she gently lay,
She knew nothing more ?till again it was day??
When all things said to the beautiful sun
Good morning ! good morning ! our work has begun.?
She had just finished the last verse, when a sound as of
something- moving caused her to start. She looked anxiously
around her, but no living creature was to be seen, ?she therefore
concluded that it must have been fancy on her part. She sat as
still as a mouse for some seconds, bending down her head to
listen, and now she felt sure that her ears had not deceived


her, the sound being- repeated, and appearing- to proceed from
the direction of the river. Fido gave a low growl, thereby
denoting that his attention also Lad been directed towards it.
Mary?s heart began to palpitate violently, and she thought of
all the stories she had heard of the blacks carrying people
away and forcing them to live with them; and then she
thought of her father and mother, and wished she was at home
with them again. ? Suppose it should be the black-fellows
swimming across the river to carry her away, or suppose it
should be the Bunyip, whatever shouid she do ?
She was beginning- to feel very nervous at the picture of
the horrors she had conjured up in her mind, when straining- her
eyes in the direction of the river she saw a huge monster rise
to the surface, swim towards the bank upon which she was
sitting, scramble to the top, give himself a shake to throw
the water off, and then commence walking leisurely towards
her. Her first impulse was to snatch tip her basket and
run, but fear paralysed her limbs and chained her to the spot,
so she felt there was nothing- left for her to do but to sit still
and await the result with as much composure as she could
command. Vv hen the creature had approached within about
ten yards of her, she was surprised to hear it address her thus,
in a mild, soft voice, ? e Don?t be in the least alarmed my little
clear, I know who you are. You are Mary Somerville, the
best conducted girl in your class. 1 wouldn?t hurt a hair of
your head for all the g-old in Ballaarat.? I have been listening
to that pretty song you were singing, for there?s no music so
sweet to me as the sound of children?s voices, ? Sit still,
now, till I get up to you. I can?t travel quite so fast as I
could a hundred years Wo.?
?J o
Mary?s terror had been extreme on first seeing him
coming- towards her, but his mild manner had now somewhat
calmed her feelings, and by the time he had reached within
a few feet of her, and had sat himself down as well as his
peculiar formation would permit, she had in a g-reat measure
regained her composure.


Piclo?s growl had at first given way to furious barking,
and that again to a perfect frenzy of rage on seeing the
strange creature approaching his young mistress, and it re-
quired the exercise of all her persuasive powers to pacify him
at all.
? I am very much pleased to see you,? continued the
stranger. I?ve long wanted to have a chat with you. ?I
know all about your folks; your father?s a carpenter, and
your mother?s a dress-maker. I dare say you are surprised at
my knowing so much about you all. Ah, I know a great
deal more than people give me the credit of doing.
?Do you see that little bird perched in the tree yonder.?
Mary looked in the direction he indicated, and saw a little
bird' with his head held on one side, as though he were
listening to all they were saying. � Well, you?d be aston-
ished if you heard one-half the news he brings me,? Ah,
that tree on which he?s perched is older than 1 am. It was
as Mg' as it is now when your grandfather was .a little boy
playing in the green fields of old England. But years are
beginning to tell upon it; it?s by no means the tree it was
when I first knew it. I have seen the blackfeliows and
their iubras and piccaninies sitting - under its shade many and
many a time. Hundreds of cockatoos, parrots, and other
birds have sat chattering and chirping upon its branches,
while the laughing-jackass has darted from it upon the snake
that lay sunning itself in the grass beneath, carried it high
into the air, and dropped it down again and killed it. Leaf-
less and withered, all its former feathered friends have forsaken
it, and like a man whose riches are gone, ?tis now left to
wither alone. I sometimes almost think it knows me, for
when the breeze is blowing it waves its branches towards me,
as though it rvere holding out a friendly hand to me to shake.
I say to it sometimes, ah, old friend, we?ve braved many a
winter?s blast together, but the day is not far distant when
you, and I, and the blackfellow, and the kangaroo, and emu,
will have passed away for ever. No more then will the


hlackfellow?s boomerang describe graceful circles in the air,
nor his feet beat time in the dance to his lubras? music.
His mia-mia will then give place to the white man?s cot-
tage,?little children will lisp their prayers where camp fires
once were burning, and the music of church-hells be borne
on the breeze from one end of the land to the other.?
He then fell into a reverie, during which Mary, who
had now almost entirely regained her self-possession, mus-
tered up the courage to say, ? Who are you, if you please,
sir ? ? ? Well, my name?s Bunyip,? he replied. Some of the
hlackfellows who are not overburdened with politeness, call
me ? Old Bunyip.? But, then, I make a liberal allowance
them, they never having known the advantages of edu-
cation, and we mustn?t expect much of such people. (So
this really, then, was the Bunyip! Mary said to herself, quite
surprised to find him such an agreeable creature.)
?1 ou are the first white person who has ever seen me,?
continued he. ? Though I have shown myself upon a few
occasions to the blackfellows, who didn?t, however, seem to
appreciate me much, hut ran away as fast as their legs would
carry them.?
? Mr. Bunyip,? said Mary, smiling, ? I was nearly
running away, too, when I first saw you coming out of the river,
hut I was so frightened I couldn?t move. You see, sir, I
had never seen a gentleman like you before, so it wasn?t to
he wondered that I should feel a little frightened, was it ?
l?m not the least bit afraid of you now, I know the
hlackfellows are very much afraid of you, because father
has told me so.? ? I don?t know why they should be,? said
he, ? for I never interfere with white or black fellow unless
he has done something- wrong. But such are the effects of
slander; one circulates a report that so and so is this, that,
and the other, and then there are always others ready to
believe it, and so a reputation is ruined, as mine has been,?


1 These very blackfellows I have- shielded many a time
from the ill-treatment of the settlers, and that?s the return I
get for it. But as I said before, we must make a liberal
allowance fur their want of opportunities to learn bettor.
When I hear of boys and girls wasting their time at school,
I say to myself, you?ll be sorry for this some day, my young-
friends, when it?s'too late. You?ll grow up as ignorant and
prejudiced as those poor blacks, if you don?t mind. In a
few years? time you?ll wish you?d applied yourselves a little
closer to your studies, when you see others who have availed
themselves of the advantages you have not valued shoot past
you in life, and become esteemed members of society, whilst
you dre passed by unheeded.?
Mary had lost all her nervousness now, feeling quite
at home with her new acquaintance, and had still further
lessened the distance between them, and was sitting quite
close to him. She had been taking a thorough survey of
him during the last ten minutes, but couldn?t altogether
satisfy herself -as to what he was like. She had seen pictures
of Elephants in her school-books, and she thought lie re-
sembled those animals somewhat, yet there was a great
difference between them, too. He had fins at bis sides, which
gave him more the appearance of a whale, and as he had a
difficulty in moving along the ground and seemed so much
more at homo in the water, she came to the conclusion at
last that he must belong rather to the whale species.
Fido seeing his mistress and the stranger so confidential
together, couldn?t understand the state of affairs at all, and
now only gave an occasional growl, which would be imme-
diately followed by a desponding whine. At length, seeing
that he had no power to alter the condition of things, he
quietly subsided into an attitude of repose, with his head
between his paws, and an eye, as a precautionary measure,
upon the stranger. Mary?s nervousness having now entirely
left her, and her curiosity having become thoroughly aroused,
she determined upon ascertaining all she could about her new


acquaintance. ? Have you lived long in the river, Hr.
Bunyip,? she asked. ?I shall be a hundred and eighty years
010- next Michaelmas, he replied. And I have never been
above an-hour or two at a time out of the water in my life.
? What a great many things you must have seen in that
long time, sir,? said she. ?You may well say that,? he
replied. ?I was here years and years before the foot ? of a
white man ever trod the ground. I have gone through a
deal in my time, I can assure you. Left a poor friendless
orphan, with not a relation in the river to catch a cod fish
for me, or warn me of the dangers that lay in my way,
I was constantly getting into some sort of trouble or
eating fish that didn?t agree with me, getting into too shallow
water where I lay floundering in the mud, humping my head
against the snags, or something of the kind, my path being
indeed a thorny one.?
Here his feelings overcame him, and he drew a fin
across his eye to wipe away the falling tear.
? Oh, pray don?t cry,? exclaimed Mary, in a voice trembling
with emotion. ? I know it. must have been very dreadful to
be left as you were.? (The corner of her frock being at the
same time called into requisition, to remove the tears which
were beginning to course down her cheeks, at the narrative
of her friends early trials).
?l?m better now,? he said. But when I think of all
I went through at that period of my life, it always affects me
in this way. I dare say you are surprised to see a huge
fellow like myself moved in this manner. Ah, it?s not
always the most polished looking people who have the softest
hearts. But it?s certainly very gratifying to receive such
sympathy, as I do, from you. If young people only knew
what it is to be left without father ?or mother, they?d value
their parents more than they do, and wouldn?t be so trouble-
some to them as they sometimes are. And, speaking of
orphans, I often think that if children who are blessed with


parents would remember those poor little things who are left
without any, and would put a penny bye now and then_ to
help to buy them food and clothing, they would be doing
them a great service, and would feel all the happier for it
themselves.?
i Oh, I do do that Mr. Bunyip,? said Mary. I?ve a
money-box at home that I put all the money I get into,
and some of it I give to father, and then he puts some more
to it, and sends it down for them to the Orphanages near
Melbourne.?
1 I?m very happy to hear it,? replied Mr. Bunyip, ? and
if every child in the country did the same, a large sum of
money would he collected, and when the poor orphans learned
that it came from little children like themselves, it would
make them feel very happy indeed.? Quite a feeling of
affection seemed now to have grown up on Mary?s part
towards Mr. Bunyip, and she kept nestling closer and close?
to him. It would have done you good to see the little blue-
eyed maiden, looking up into his face and listening with
wrapt attention to every word that fell from his lips.
?As an infant, I was very delicate,? he continued, ? and
all the wise fish in the river said I never could live, hut like
many other wise-acres on shore and afloat, they were greatly
deceived. I hadn?t the advantages that infants of the present
day have, there being no patent feeding-bottles in my time,
but upon being ordered change of water, they took me to a
quiet shady retreat higher up the river, where there were
plenty of delicious little fish, and I soon got better. I enjoy
verv good health now, thank goodness, and we can never be
too thankful when such is the case.?
? Do you live all alone in the river, sir,? asked Mary.
( Oh, dear no! there?s Mrs. B. and six little B.?s down there
(pointing- with his fin in the direction of the river). We
are pretty snug- there, too, I can assure you. Plenty of fish


to eat, and as much water as we like to drink. I never take
anj'tliing stronger.
I did once taste something out of a barrel marked
?Brandy,? that fell overboard from one of the steamers
that go up and down the river here, but I?ll never do it
again. I took just a sip .of it, at first, and then another,
till I had nearly finished the barrel. I now beg'an to ieel
rather excited, so I went home, and upon the old lady re-
marking that I looked strange, and swam about very un-
steadily, I told her to mind her own business. So one word
led to another, and the end of it was I gave her a thrashing,
and turned her and the little B/s out of the river, anu tneiO
they sat upon the bank all night, shivering with cold.?
< Oh, Mr. Bunyip,? said Mary, quite shocked, ? I should
never have thought a nice kind gentleman like you would
have done such a cruel thing'.'
? Neither should I, my dear, had it, not been for that
nasty stuff.? ? I never lifted a fin to Mrs. B. in my life
before.? ? I always looked upon any one as a monster w;,o
would strike a fern alb, and so I do now.?
? Well, the next morning' I woke up with a, terrible
head-ache, and went to look for Mrs. B. and the little ones,
and I can assure you I never felt so ashamed of myself in
my life as I did when I saw them ? ? However, she for-
o-ave. me when I explained how it aad all happened, : ? ?
asked her forgiveness. Bor I?m never too proud to acknow-
ledge having done wrong.?
? A fault 'confessed is half redressed.'?
? I then went and poured the remainder of the Brand}
into the river, and if you had seen the sillies the little fish
made of themselves as soon as they tasted it, you would
nave opened your eyes!?
? My wife said, that, if ? Brandy? had the same effect


upon folks on land, that it had on those in the river, the
less they took of it the better.? And so I thought, and
have not tasted a drop of anything stronger than water,
from that day to this.
?ls Mrs. Bunyip like you, sir V asked Mary??
?Oh, yes, so I believe,? answered'he. ?She was a very
good-looking- person when I first made her acquaintance
some eighty years ago.? People like you, who live on
land, might not think her very handsome, but Beauty is
all a matter of taste? ?
? Handsome is that handsome does,?
is my motto, and as she?s always been a good wife to me,
she?s beautiful in my eyes, and that is everything.?
?You said just now that I must have seen a good
deal in my time. Indeed I have. I remember the first
white settlers coming here, and some of them didn?t treat
the poor blacks very well, either. There was Peter Hard-
heart, the very first to take up a station in this neighbor-
hood ; he used to shoot down the poor fellows as though
they were wild beasts. ?They, and their people, had been
in the habit for generations of catching Kangaroos,
Opossums, Wallabys, and other animals they ate, upon the
land he occupied, and saw no harm in doing so still. But,
he invented stories about their stealing his sheep, and
firing his fences, and then shot them down wherever he saw
them.?
? But, I kept my ej r e on him, ?till, one day I saw him
chasing some of the poor fellows along the bank here, and
I was out of the water and had him in a moment.?
? And what did you do with Mr. Hardheart, sir,? asked
Mary,
? Well, my dear, I don?t like to shock your tender


feelings, so I won?t tell you what I did with him. at all
events he never went back to his station any more, liis
friends thought he was lost in the hush, hut Mrs. B. knows
better. We keep his spurs and stirrup-irons down there
(nodding his head in the direction of the river), for our little
ones to play with.?
? There was Mr. Lovelace, now, quite a different of
person, he never hurt the poor hlackfellows, hut would give
them food when Kangaroos were scarce. I?ve saved his life
more than once, hut he little thought it was Bunyip he was
indebted to for it.?
?There was Tommy Turbulent, too, who used to go to
Mr. Syntax?s school. I' knew how- cruel he was to other hoys
who were less than himself, and how he used to steal their
tops and marbles from them, so I saw him coming along one
day, and kept my head under water so that he shouldnt see
me, and the moment he came np I had him. W hen I caught
him he promised if I let him go he?d never he wicked again,
but had made so many promises that I didn?t listen to him,
for one can?t believe such people. That very afternoon he
had played truant. It?s a very unpleasant thing to have to
punish bad people, but I feel .1 have a duty to perform, and
when that is the case, one shouldn?t he deterred by its
unpleasantness.?
? When you see Susan Slattern, tell her I have my eye
upon her too. I know all about her capsizing the perambu-
lator and throwing the baby out upon the thistles, and then
telling her mistress that he?d scratched his face himself.
Tell her she?d better mind what she?s about or it may be
worse for her.?
?You must excuse my monopolising the conversation,
my dear, but it?s such a treat to meet with a good patient
listener like you, young people being generally much fonder
of talking than of listening. If ever I begin to tell my
young folks of the various things I?ve seen in my time, such


as the size of the fish I used to catch, the Corroborees of
the blacks, the bush fires, or other equally interesting? sub-
jects, they are pretty sure to break out with, Oh! for good-
ness, gracious sake pa, don?t tell us that old story again,
we?ve heard if a hundred times. But I tell them "the day
is not far distant when they won?t have me to tell them
any more stories, and then they?ll wish they?d listened to
them a little more patiently.?
? Young folks fancy because they know their ABC
that their little heads are brim-full of knowledge, and
don?t show proper respect for those who have lived so
much long?er than they have, and who must consequently
know better than they do. So, as I said before, it?s quite
a treat to meet with a good listener like you.?
? Oh, said Mary, I should never get tired of listening-
to you, Mr. Bunyip, your stories are so interesting - , and
I can understand you better than I can most people.
You speak slowly, and I don?t know how it is but I
begin quite to like you,?at least I am sure I should like
you very much when I had known you a little longer,
because it wouldn?t he right, would it, sir, to like a
strange person all at once that I had never seen before ?
My mother says I mustn?t be in too great a hurry to
make the acquaintance of people I?ve never seen before,
hut must wait ?till I know something more about them.?
? And your Mother gives you a piece of good advice
when she says so,? replied Mr. Bunyip. ? And it would
be a great deal better for many other young people
if they were to listen, as you do, to what their parents
tell them.?
: But I shan?t forget to tell them at home how kind
you have been to me, sir,? continued Mary. ? And now I
think I must he g'oing - , or Mother will be missing - me.
Can you tell me the time, if you please V


? Well, 1 don?t carry the time about with me, but I
should judge, by the sun, that it?s getting on for six.
I was about suggesting that it was getting time for you
to start. I?m sorry I haven?t been able to ask you into
our place,?we?re rather awkwardly situated in that re-
spect, It wouldn?t agree with you to stay down long at
the bottom of the river; we?re used to it, and use is every-
thing-. However, I won?t forget to mention you to them
below. It?s such an unusual occurrence to hear a beau-
tiful little creature like you saying- that she sees anything-
to admire in a huge monster,? ??
? Oh, don?t say that, Mr. Bunyip,? said Mary, who
couldn?t bear to hear him speak of himself in that way.
1 W ell, fellow, then, like myself, that I shall not
forget it for a while, I can assure you. It?s a sort of
double compliment,?it?s a compliment to you as well as
to myself, because it shows you are able to detect a kind
heart though it he enclosed in a rough skin. Your nearest
way home is round by the foot of the hill there. And
now, Good-bye, and always remember this, wherever you
may he,
THAT WHILE YOU DO THAT WHICH IS
RIGHT, YOU WILL NEVER HAVE ANYTHING
TO FEAR.*
?He then left her, and walked leisurely down the
bank. She saw his form cleave the water, and in another
instant he had disappeared from sight. She experienced
a feeling of dejection when she fully realised the fact of
his having- left her, perhaps for ever, and a sigh escaped
her bosom as. she took up her basket, and prepared to
start for home, for she felt she had lost a Friend.?
There was something about him which told her
that he must he good; he seemed so anxious not to frighten
her, and talked to her in such a nice kind manner-, that
he had quite won her little heart. Her spirits began,


however, to revive on nearing' her Home find seeing her
Mother standing' at the door as though she were looking
out for her little daughter, so she quickened her pace, closely
followed by Fido, who seemed as anxious to get home as
herselij and in a few minutes more was by her Mother?s
side.
? Why, wherever have you been all this while ! exclaimed
Mrs. Somerville. ?We thought you were lost, and your
father was just coming to look for you.?
? Oh, Mother,? replied Mary, quite out of breath, ? I?ve
seen MR. BUNYIP! and he?s such a nice gentleman, at
least he?s not exactly a gentleman, but he was kind
to me, and told me such nice stories about the blackfeliows,
and he knows all about you and father, and Susan Slat-
tern, and he showed me the nearest way home, and,
?Why, whatever is the child talking about,? her
mother, ? But take off your things and get your lea, you
must be as hungry as a hunter.?
Mary did as she was desired, and after finishing her
meal she told her mother all about Mr. Bunyip, just as 1
have told you.
Her Mother thought, that, being out so long in the sun
had made her daughter?s head a little queer, but noticing
some little prickly things called ? Burrs,? sticking to the
back of her head, she came to the conclusion, that she
