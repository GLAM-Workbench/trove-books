EQUATION OF TIME.
In the absence of a column of daily Equation, the following general Table, for
all years, will be found useful for the purpose of regulating a dock by the sun.
The ditlerence between Mean and Apparent Time is termed the Equation of
Time, and to regulate a clock by the sun, this difference has to be added to or
subtracted from Apparent or Solar Time, according to the period of the year.
In the following table the Equation is given in minutes only. The mark t in-
dicates that the clock is earlier, and the mark that it is later, than the sun.
T us: on the Ist of January, the clock to be correct must show 4 minutes past
12 when t 1 e dial shows 12; and on the 24th of April, 2 minutes to 12 when the
dial shows 12:—

Explanation. —Find the moon’s age in the calendar, and opposite to it, in
figures, in the above table, the time of high water in Sydney Cove will be found.
EXPLANATION OF THE ALMANACK.
The first column contains the day of the month ; the second, the
day of the week; the third, holydays, vigils, remarkable events, &c.;
the fourth, sixth, and eighth, the moon’s age; the fifth, seventh, and
ninth, the time of the sun’s rising and setting at 'Sydney, Melbourne,
and Adelaide.
Note. —It may be proper to state, that the times of the sun’s rising and setting,
as registered in this Almanac, have been computed for Sydney, Melbourne, and
Adelaide, from the sun’s declination at noon for each of the places, it being con-
sidered, that tlie change in the sun’s declination, between the noon of each day,
and the time of the rising and setting, would not produce a minute of time in tlie
results, even at the equinox when the daily change of declination is a maximum ;
and it may be further necessary to state, that the times as here given are those
when the sun’s centre is in the true horizon, the effect of refraction not being
taken into the account; and in the case of the eclipses, the beginning and end
refer to the first and last contact with the penumbru.

although space will only allow room for the most essential directions respecting the
methods of Cookery which experience has proved to be the best they may be depended
upon for correctness. And if a more general and full Cookery Book should be

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOILING.
The great art in boiling meat is to preserve a clean delicate appearance, and to
serve it up so as to eat rich and tender. . , . . .
Now all this is very easily to be done, the whole secret lying m slightly washing
the meat clean with lukewarm water just before you cook it -using a clean saucepan
and clean water, getting it to boil over a moderately good but not a great fierce fire,
skimming it clean as it comes to a boil, and. keeping it very gently boiling, and
covered down closely, after it is skimmed, till it is done.
Meat so cooked, iu a clean proper-sized saucepan, will always look well and eat
tender; but if the inside of the saucepan is not quite clean, and if it is not carefully
skimmed as soon as it comes to a boil, or if it be suffered to boil fast after it is
skimmed, or to stop boiling altogether, though but for a short time the meat will be
unpleasant to the eye, have little juice or gravy, and eat harsh and hard. _
Iron or tin pots and saucepans are the best and most wholesome for cooking in ;
but on no account should the liquor in which any joint has been boiled be suflered
to remain in the pot or saucepan to get cool, but should be turned out into a soup
tureen or earthenware pan, and, when it is quite cold, be kept covered over till
wanted. The liquor of boiled meat, or of boiled poultry, if cooked gently in only a
proper quantity of water, and carefully skimmed before it comes to a boil, may
always be make into good soup; therefore, if so boiled, it should be saved m an
earthenware pan. . ,
As to the time which a joint of meat will take to cook by boiling, no precise rule
can be laid down. The old idea of a quarter of an hour to every pound of meat is
nearly correct; but the thinner the article is, as poultry, rabbits, the thin part of
pork, neck of mutton, &c., the less time it will take to boil it; but close thick
joints, such as leg of pork, leg of mutton, round of beef, &c., will take a longer tune.
I mean that you must allow more time for every pound of thick joints than you do
for each pound of thin joints. ,
Pots or saucepans used for boiling should not be much larger than just sufficient
to hold the meat without touching the sides, with water enough to fairly cover the
meat, and no more. Waste room in a pot for boiling meat is bad, as the nourishing
quality of the meat is carried away in the water and steam when the pot is unneces-
sarily laro-e It is also necessarv that the covers of saucepans or pots for boiling
food should fit quite close and be rather tight: the water will be then kept simmering
by a moderate fire, and will not boil away and carry off the nicest and most nourish-
ing qualities of the food, which will be the case if kept uncovered while boiling, or
if it is suffered to boil fast over a large fire.
Frozen meat will not cook well unless it is first thawed. This is easily done by
putting the joint into cold water in the kitchen for a short time,—say from half an
D


hour to two hours, —before cooking. In cold weather all joints take rather more
time in cooking than in warm weather.
When you hoil puddings, a plate should always be put at the bottom of the pot,
to prevent the pudding sticking to the bottom and burning; hut a rolled pudding
will require a small dish.
To Boil Salt Beef. —Either the half round, edge-bone, mouse buttock, brisket,
or thick flank. Wash the joint, to clean it from the salt, and then put it into a pot
or kettle a very little larger than enough to hold it, with cold water to cover the meat
about one inch. Let it come to a boil gradually, and just as the water begins to
hoil the scum will rise : this you must carefully skim off, and continue so to do as
long as any scum arises, or it will stick to the meat and give it a disagreeable appear-
ance. When you have taken off all the scum, cover it down quite close, and let it
boil very gently till done. If the joint weighs ten pounds, it will be done in a little
more than two hours from the time it comes to a hoil; if fifteen pounds, in about
three hours; if twenty pounds, in about three hours and a half. The brisket or
flank will take a longer time to boil, in proportion to its weight, than either of the
other joints.
When you take up the joint, throw a cupful or two of the boiling liquor over the
meat, to wash off any scum that for want of good skimming may have clung to the
outside of it; then put it into a clean dish, and strain a little of the boiling liquor
over the joint to make gravy in the dish.
Boiled beef is usually served up with carrots, and greens, and potatoes, in separate
dishes; but the carrots may be sliced and served up in the dish with the beef, or
used to garnish the dish. They will take about two hours, if large; if young and
small, about an hour will do. It is, therefore, easy to manage so as to have them
done at the same time as the meat; hut do not cut them into long halves, or long
slices, until they are cooked.
To Boil a Leg of Mutton. —This joint is more seasonable in cool than in warm
weather, as the heat of summer will not allow it to he hung a sufficient time to
make it eat short, rich, and tender. Cut off the shank-bone, lay the joint for five
minutes in lukewarm water ; then wipe it, to clean it from any impurity it may have
got while hanging up. Then put it into a pot or saucepan with just enough cold
water to cover it; and as soon as it comes to a hoil, skim it cleanly, and continue to
skim it as long as any scum rises: then cover it close, and put it so on the fire that
it may boil gently till it is done, which, if the leg weighs ten pounds, will be in
about two hours and a half.
A boiled leg of mutton should be served up with mashed turnips, carrots, and
potatoes, in separate dishes, and with caper-sauce in a sauce-tureen. And remember,
when you hoil turnips, that your saucepan must be clean, and that you keep the lid
of the saucepan off, or they will not he white.
A Neck or Breast of Mutton.— These joints always require to be first nicely
washed clean in lukewarm water. Wash out the clotted blood, and cut out all the
discoloured and unsightly pieces. Carefully skim it as soon as it comes to a hoil;
and when no more scum rises cover it down, and let it boil very gently for about an
hour and a half to two hours, according to the weight of the joint; hut the breast
will take a longer time boiling than the neck. It should be served up with caper-
sauce, or with parsley-and-butter sauce, accompanied with mashed turnips if in
season, carrots, and potatoes.
A Leg of Lamb may be boiled much in the same manner, and will take from an
hour and a half to two hours, according to weight. It is considered a delicate joint;
and it must be carefully skimmed, and is usually served up with either French beans,
asparagus, or spinach, and potatoes.
To Boil an Oyster of Veal. —First stuff it nicely with veal stuffing, and then
put it in a pot with cold water enough to cover it. Skim it well; and when no
more scum rises, cover it down, and let it gently boil for about two hours and a half
from the time it is covered down; for a joint of eight pounds weight, allowing
twenty minutes to the pound for veal. When you dish it up, pour a little melted
butter and parsley over the joint, and send the rest up in a sauce-tureen. It is
sometimes served up with oyster sauce, or mushroom sauce, and is usually accom-


panied with either pickled pork, or tongue, or ham, and with either sea-cale, or
broccoli, Veal may be boiled much in the same manner, but will
not take more than an hour and a half gentle boiling. It is accompanied by pickled,
pork, or tongue, and served up with parsley and butter, vegetables and potatoes.
P A Knuckle of Veal requires longer time to boil, and should be boiled more-
gently and much longer than any other joint of the same weight. It is served up
covered with parsley and butter, and accompanied with pickled pork or bacon. It
is sometimes served up in a dish surrounded with rice, which is boiled with it, and
parsley and butter sauce, with vegetables the same as neck of veal. If cooked with.
rice, take care to stir it frequently to prevent its burning.
To Boil a Galf’s Head.— Get half a calf’s head, take out the brains, put them;
into a basin of clean water, and wash the head several times with fresh lukewarm
water • and then put it into a saucepan with rather more lukewarm water than,
enough to cover it, and let it boil slowly, carefully taking off the scum as it rises.
It must be boiled slowly till the meat is quite tender. If dressed with the skin on
it will take about three hours,—a little more or less according to its size; but it
the skin is off, it will take about two hours,—a little more or less according to its
size. After the head has come to a boil, and has been well slammed and covered
down, wash the brains twice in cold water, and, having carefully cleaned them from
skin and blood, lay them in a basin of clean water, with a pinch of salt in it, till
within about half an hour of the time of the head being done; then tie them up
with two or three cleanly washed sage leaves, in a muslin rag ; put it into the pot
with the head, and let it boil gently a quarter of an hour. Then take out the brains,
throw away the sage leaves, and chop up the brains; put them into the saucepan
you make the sauce in, with two table-spoonfuls of parsley and butter but made
with twice the usual quantity of parsley leaves, and a very small pinch of salt; stir
the whole together, and warm it over the fire, taking care not to let it boil or burn.
The ton-ue having been boiled with the head, its roots must be cut off, and then
skinned, and served up in a small dish with the brains round it.
A calf’s head may be served up either with a ham or a nice pieee of bacon or
pickled pork • with broccoli, or cauliflower, and potatoes; and plenty of parsley and
butter sauce. The liquor in which the calf’s head is boiled is good for making soup
with, or for hashing up the cold remains of the head.
Parsley and Butter Sauce.— Lay a handful of fresh-gathered parsley to soak
for ten minutes, and then wash it well in several waters; put it into clean boiling
water with a pinch of salt in it, and boil it till tender: then take it out, scrape the
leaves off the stalks, and chop them fine. Put it into rather less than half a pint of
melted butter, mix it well in the butter saucepan, and serve it up m a sauce-tureen.
To Boil a Ham. —A ham must be soaked and scraped, before it is dressed,, to
make it clean and tender. Arnold dry ham should be steeped in eold water from
eighteen to twenty-four hours, while ten or twelve hours will be enough for a small
ham, or one that is not very dry, and from four to six hours will be sufficient to soak,
a green or Yorkshire ham.
When the ham is soaked enough, take it out of the water, cut off all the ragged,
rusty, or decayed parts, from the sides and under part, and carefully scrape it quite
clean all over. Put it into a pot with cold water to cover it about two inches, and
let it be heated slowly, so that it may be an hour at least before it begins to boil..
It must be well skimmed as long as any scum will arise, and then covered elose
down, and kept simmering very gently till done. Pour hours gently simmering will
be enough for a ham of fifteen pounds, reckoning from the time it comes to a boil
but allowance must be made for the thickness or thinness of the ham, and for the
time it has been kept. If the ham is thin, you must allow rather less time.
When the ham is done, the skin must be carefully peeled off, without breaking, if
possible, as it will serve to cover the ham and keep it moist when it is put bv. As
soon as the skin is peeled off, coat the ham over with brown raspings, rasped from
the bottom crust of a loa f . Then trim and wipe the knuckle, and wrap round it a
piece of writing paper, fringed, to hold it by in carving.


The gravy which runs out of a ham when it is cut, is called Essence of Ham, and
should be carefully saved, as it is an excellent flavouring for soups and gravies.
To boil Bacon. —If the bacon be very fresh, it will take but a few hours’ soaking •
but if it be old, it should be put into water over night. It must be carefully scraped’
cleaned, and have all the rusty parts cut off, as directed for ham, before it is put on’
in cold water, to boil: boil it slowly, skimming it well. When done, which you will
know by the rind peeling off readily, skin it, and cover it with raspings, as directed
for ham.
To boil a Tongue.—Tongues, especially the foreign ones, are so hard and dry,
as to require to be soaked at least all night in cold water, and boiled very slowly, and
for a long time, in proportion to their weight, to make them tender. If the tongue
be plump, with a smooth skin, it is young, and will not require so long a soaking •
but a very dry tongue may be made tender and plump by proper soaking and very
slow simmering. After the tongue has soaked long enough, wash it in a little fresh
water, and scrape it nice and clean ; then put it in the kettle, covered with cold water,
which is to be heated very slowly, so that it does not begin to boil in less than an
hour : keep it simmering gently for three hours from the time it began to boil, more
or less, according to its size, skin it, and serve.
, BGIL A EG Pork. A leg of pork should be soaked for a few minutes to
halt an hour, according to its saltness, and then scraped and nicely cleaned. Put it
on m cold water, and let it come to a boil gently, taking the scum off carefully.
When you take it up, see that it is nice and clean, and serve it up with peas pudding
and greens, or with carrots and potatoes, or with parsnips, greens, and potatoes.
A leg of seven or eight pounds weight should boil gently for two hours to two
hours and a quarter. If boiled fast, the knuckle will be broken, and the appearance
of the leg spoiled, before the joint is done.
A hand of pork is to be cleaned and boiled in the same manner as a leg ; but
being a thinner joint, will take less time for each pound it may w r eigh.
The belly part oe Pickled Pork, being thin, will also take less time in pro-
portion to its weight than the leg. Serve it up with any greens in season, and po-
tatoes. When you can easily pull out the bones, it is done.
Peas Pudding.—Wash clean a quart of split peas, and let them soak two hours •
then tie them loosely in a clean cloth, put them into a pot of cold soft water, and
let them boil till tender, which, if they are good peas, will be in about two hours •
then take them up, untie the pudding cloth, and beat them well with a wooden spoon
adding an egg, an ounce of butter, half a tea-spoonful of white pepper, and a tea-
spoonful of salt: beat and mix all well together; tie the pudding up again verv
tight, and let it boil gently with the meat you intend to serve it up with, for another
half hour; then take it up, let it stand in a colander about ten minutes, then untie
it, and turn it out.
To boil a Rabbit.—Soak the rabbit in warm water for a few minutes; take out
the liver, and wash the inside of the rabbit clean. Put it into a saucepan in cold
water covered abont two inches; skim it well as long as any scum arises, and then
cover it down: let it boil gently after it is skimmed for half to three quarters of an
hour, according to size, or age.—A rabbit is usually served up with boiled pickled
pork, and with greens and potatoes; and with onion sauce, or liver-and-parsley sauce,
or parsley-and-butter sauce. The liver must always be boiled by itself, or it will
discolour the rabbit.
Liver-and-parsley sauce.—Boil a fresh rabbit’s liver, or fresh poultry’s liver,
m a few table-spoonfuls of water, for five minutes ; mince it fine, and bruise it in a
mortar with a little of the liquor it was boiled in; then take about one third the
weight of the liver in parsley-leaves, put them into boiling water with a tea-spoonful
of salt, and boil till tender; then squeze the parsley dry, and mince it fine, mix it
with the liver, and put the whole into a quarter of a pint of melted butter; —warm
the sauce without letting it boil; and serve it up hot.
Onion sauce.—Boil four large onions for fifteen minutes, then put them into
fresh hot water, and boil them gently till tender. Peel them, cut out the roots, and
squeeze them dry between two trenchers or plates.—Chop them very fine, and warm


them up with melted butter, made with milk instead of water. Pour a little of this
sauce over the rabbit, and serve up the rest, hot, in a sauce-tureen.
To boil a Turkey. —Your turkey being trussed for boiling, fill the breast with
the following stuffing. To two ounces of pork sausage meat, or the same weight of
finely-minced lean veal, add one once and a half finely minced suet, as much parsley-
leaves as will fill a table-spoon when chopped, half the peel of a fresh lemon, grated
fine, a little grated nutmeg, half a tea-spoonful of pounded knotted marjoram, and
the same of lemon thyme; let all be rubbed very fine, and then mixed together with
three ounces of stale bread crumbs, and the yolks and whites of two eggs; season it
with a tea-spoonful of pepper, and the same of salt, if you use the lean veal; but if you
use the pork sausage meat, half the pepper and salt will do. If you add a small
quantity of grated ham, or grated tongue, it will improve the flavour of the stuffing.
Put the turkey into a saucepan, with cold water enough to cover it about two
inches; let it come to a boil gently, and skim it carefully as the scum rises, and the
bird will look white and delicate. A large turkey will take two hours or more gentle
boiling; and a smaller one, about an hour and a half, reckoning from the time it
comes" to a boil. The liquor in which a turkey has been boiled is good to use for a
hash or for soup.
Serve up with oyster sauce, or parsley-and-butter sauce, and with either ham,
tongue, or pickled pork; and with any green vegetable in season, and potatoes.
To boil Powls, Capons, &c. —A large fowl, or capon, should be trussed and
dressed just the same way as a turkey. It is sometimes stuffed, and takes half as much
stuffing as a turkey. A capon, or large-sized fowl, will take about an hour to boil it;
a middle-sized one about forty minutes; and a chicken about half an hour, reckoning
from the time they are skimmed, and covered down. Serve up with ham, tongue,
or pickled pork; and with either broccoli, sea kale, French beans, vegetable marrow,
spinach, or cauliflower; and potatoes.
White fowls are best for boiling; dark feathered, or black feathered, or black-
legged ones, are best for roasting.
Caper Sauce. —Mince a dessert-spoonful of capers quite small, and cut another
dessert spoonful into about halves; mix with one dessert spoonful of vinegar; and
stir the whole into a quarter of a pint of melted butter, over the fire, till quite hot,
and pour it into your sauce-tureen.
Melted Butter. —Into a clean butter-saucepan put two ounces of butter, in pieces,
and a full tea-spoonful of flour, add by degrees one third of a pint of cold water,
mixing it all well together with a spoon. Put it over a clear part of the fire, and keep
stirring it all one way till it boils up ; and pour it out directly into your sauce-tureen ;
for it will oil if you keep it in your butter-saucepan a minute after it is made.
DIRECTIONS FOR BOILTNG FISH.
Much more attention is necessary in boiling Fish than in boiling meat, because
leaving fish in the water but a very few minutes after it is really done, will cause it
to crack and break, so as to be very unsightly; while, if it is served up before it is
done enough, it wall not be eatable. You must be sure to skim your pot well, or
else you will have to wash the scum off the fish when you take it up.
When done enough, the eyes will turn white, the fins will easily part from the
fish, if pulled, and the skin will crack; the moment these signs take place, the
fish must be taken up.
Fish-kettles have always a perforated false bottom, with handles affixed, called a
fish-strainer, so that it is very easy to take up fish when done, without breaking
it. When dished up, it must be slid off this strainer on to a fish-plate, which fits
the dish you serve it up in, on which fish-plate a nice clean white napkin is usually
put to lay the fish on, that all the moisture may be absorbed.
Some families do not use a napkin to lay fish on : in which case, of course, you
must only slide the fish off the strainer on to the fish-plate, which you put into the
dish, and serve it up.
Should it so happen that the fish is done before it is wanted, or that the family are
not ready to sit down, the best way will be to wrap a wet napkin round the fish, and
after placing it very carefully on the tin strainer, suspend it in the fish-kettle, over


so much of the boiliug-water as will keep it hot, but not touch it. It will thus be
ready to serve up when wanted: but it will not be quite so nice as if it had been
sent up to table the moment it was cooked.
Some cooks dissolve salt in the water in which fish is to be boiled; but the proper
way is to steep the fish in salt and water for from five to ten minutes, immediately
before putting it into the kettle to cook : the necessity of using salt in boiling fish is
thus avoided ; less scum rises, so that the lid has not to be taken off so often to skim
it, and the fish goes to table not only nicer, but with a better appearance.
Eish must only be barely covered with water, and gently brought to boil, then
carefully skimmed, and covered down close with the lid of the fish-kettle, and boiled
gently till done. It will eat richer, have a finer flavour, and be far more firm, than
if cooked in a larger quantity of water, which only soddens it, and takes away the
fine firmness so much prized.
In winter time, fish is likely to be frozen ; and as it will never cook in this state,
it should be put into cold water (without salt) in the kitchen for an hour or so, to
thaw it. It must still be put into salt and water, before yon cook it, to make it firm.
The fishmonger ought to gut and clean fish in a proper manner; but a cook must
not trust to this; a good washing and cleaning the inside will be found essential
before is fit to dress.
Melted better, to be served up with fish, should be made thicker than when in-
tended for any other purpose : as it is usually thinned at table by mixing with it
Chili vinegar, essence of anchovies, or one or other of the sauces taken with fish, by
•the persons who eat it.
The time of boiling fish differs, according to its kind; a salmon of ten pounds
weight will take about three-quarters of an hour gentle boiling; a turbot, or a cod
■of the same weight, will not take more than half an hour; salt cod will take twelve
Lours soaking before it is fit to boil, and then a fish of ten pounds will take an hour
and a half, or longer, gentle boiling ; mackarel take about five minutes ; slices of
skates, about a quarter of an hour; soles and haddocks, if not very large, about ten
minutes each ; reckoning from the time they come to a boil.
The principal sauces to accompany fish, are, lobster sauce, for salmon, &c.;
oyster sauce, for cod, &c.; shrimp sauce, and anchovy sauce : Directions for making
which are now given.
Lobster Sauce.—Take a dessert-spoonful of the spawn of a live hen-lobster from
under the tail, which the fishmonger, of whom you buy fish, will give you; pound it
in a small clean mortar with half a salt-spoonful of salt; then cut into small pieces
the white meat of the inside of a boiled lobster. Stir this, with the paste made from
the live spawn, into as much melted butter as you will require, and stir it all one way
over the fire till (he sauce turns of a fine red; but do not let it boil; then turn it
out directly into a sauce-tureen, and serve it up.
It is now usual to breakup the shells of the boiled lobster, and boil them in nearly
a pint of water, closely covered, for half an hour; then strain it through a hair
sieve, and use the strained liquor, when cold, to make the melted butter with.
Oyster Sauce. —Open, or have opened, two dozen good oysters into a basin;
and rinse them with a silver fork, or a silver skewer, one at a time, in their own
liquor, taking off their beards, and put them as you do so into a clean basin; let the
liquor stand till it is settled, then pour it clear off into the basin to the oysters,
through a small hair sieve; then put the clear liquor and the bearded oysters into a
clean butter saucepan, and let them get gently to a simmer, but not quite to a boil,
or they will be hard : while the oysters are getting warm, mix one dessert-spoonful
of flour, and two of water, with two ounces of butter, and put it to the liquor and
oysters; stir it well all one way over a gentle fire, till it just boils, then send it up.
If you use native oysters you need not beard them.
Shrimp Sauce. —Rinse a pint of shrimps in a sieve, with cold water; then shell
them, pick them clean, and stew the heads and shells of the shrimps in half a pint
of water, closely covered, for a quarter of an hour : strain off the liquor, let it stand
till cold, and use it to make your melted butter with; when made, add the picked
shrimps to it, pour it directly into a warm sauce tureen, and serve up.
Anchovy Sauce.—Boil two good-sized or three small anchovies, for about ten


minutes, in half a pint of water : then take them off and strain them, and use the
liquor, when cold, to mix with three tea-spoonfuls of flour, and two ounces ot butter;
which stir over the fire till it just comes to a boil, and serve up.
INSTRUCTIONS TOR BAKING, AND MAKING PASTRY.
To male a kitchen range answer properly for baking, and steaming, all the ashes
and cinders must he raked out from under the oven and boiler of the range, every
day you have to use it, before the fire is lighted; otherwise the heat and flame of the
fire cannot act in the flues and draughts about the oven, as they must do to make the
range act well for baking. . „ ,
Before you put anything to bake in an oven, be sure it is quite clean, tor it the
juice or gravy of any thing which has been baked in it should have run over into the
oven or if anything dirty is or has been in the oven, it will give a disagreeable taste
to whatever is baked in it; be careful, therefore, to clean and sweep the oven out
with a damp cloth, before you light the fire, or before it is too hot to do so, and let
it dry before you close the door tight. If you should have had the juice of a pie, or
the fat of a joint, or any thing else, run over a baking-dish into the oven, you must
wash and scrape the inside of the oven quite clean before you can use the oven again;
taking out the shelves, if moveable, and the baking tins, and cleaning them in the
same manner, or your oven will give a bad taste to the next thing baked.
All pies must be attended to while cooking, to. see that the juice does not boil over,
for if it does it will make a steam in the oven, which will, spoil the crust, and make
the pie appear to be done before it is well warmed. After a pie has been in the oven
for a quarter of an hour, or a joint has been in the oven about half an hour, at
furthest, it must be looked to, and the dish turned round, if neeessary, or it may be
spoiled by being burnt in one part and not done at another. .
If you should find the juice of your pie run over, you must take out the pie, raise
the erust at one end, and pour out some of the juice, which save, and pour again
into the pie when it is done, if there is room; but if there is not room, send it up
with the pie in a small sauce-tureen. .
Before you put any thing in the oven to bake you must try if your oven is hot
enough, by just dipping your finger in water, and sprinkling a drop or two on the
oven door ; if it hisses and. dries off, then it is hot enough for a small joint, a truit
pie, a batter pudding,' or any thing substantial; but for such things as a ground
rice pudding, or for vermicelli, sago puddings, or custards, your oven must be much
cooler; indeed, custards and such things had better be cooked with the door a little
open, for if they once boil they are totally spoiled.
OBSERVATIONS ON PASTRY.
Things used in making pastry should always be kept very clean, and never used
for any other purpose. If any hardened paste is left on the rolling pm, or there is
anv dust on the cutters or tins, it will entirely spoil your pastry.
Flour for puff-paste should be of the best kind : and it ought to be carefully dried
in a dish, at a good distance from the fire, a little while before you are going to use
it, otherwise the paste will not he so light and good ; but be careful not to use the
flour till it is quite cold, or the paste will be heavy. ,
The butter for making puff-paste must be worked well on a marble slab, or on the
paste-board, before you use it, to get the water and buttermilk out of it. Alter it
has been pressed and worked well with a clean knife, press it very lightly with a
clean soft cloth, to absorb the moisture, aud then it will be ready for use. it you
use good fresh butter, it will require very little, if any, working.
Piiee Paste, for Eruit Pies.— Put a pound and a quarter of fine flour into a
clean pan, and rub gently into it half a. pound of good butter : then mix into it, by
degrees, Ather less than half a pint of cold water. After it is well kneaded set it
by? on your paste-board, for a quarter of an hour ; then roll it out thin, and lay on
it a quarter of a pound more butter, in small pieces : sprinkle a little flour over the
butter ou the paste,fold it over, and roll it out thin again; then again lay on it


another quarter of a pound of butter, in small pieces, sprinkle it again with flour, and
when you have once more doubled it up, let the paste stand in a cool place for an
hour.
If yon beat up the yolk of one good-sized egg, in the water you use to make the
puff paste with, and then add it to the juice of one middle-sized lemon, it will be
found a very great improvement. The white of the egg, well frothed, will ice your
tart, with a little lump sugar sifted over the top.
Short, or Medley Paste for Meat Pies.— Divide half a pound of salt butter,
or lard, or clarified dripping, into small pieces, and mix with it, by degrees, a pound
of flour ; then rub it together between the hands, and add as much cold water as will
make it into a smooth paste. Roll it out flat; then fold it, and roll it out again,
three times, and it will be ready for use. If you use either lard or dripping, put a
pinch of salt in the water.
Short, or Medley Tart Paste— lnto a pound and a half of flour, rub with
your hands three quarters of a pound of butter; then add by degrees a little more
than half a pint of water, and knead it well into a paste.
Pruit Pies, or Pruit Tarts, —May be made of peaches, nectarines, apricots,
loquats, grapes, gooseberries, currants, raspberries, plums, damsons, greengages, or
cherries and currants, which should be quite fresh, and be well washed before you
pick them off the stalks. Put your fruit in a pie-dish, so that it may be highest in
the middle; and to every quart of fruit when picked, put four ounces of good moist
sugar. And haying rubbed the edge of the dish with water, to make the paste stick
to it, cover it with puff-paste, about half an inch thick. Close the sides well, pare
all round with a knife, and make a hole on each side, just above the rim. It must
be baked in rather a brisk oven, a longer or shorter time, according to the thickness
of the crust.
Meat Pies.— lt is frequently found, that when the crust of a meat pie is baked
quite enough, the meat in the inside of it is not sufficiently cooked to eat nice and
tender, as it ought to do : the proper way to prevent this, is to gently boil or stew
the meat in a saucepan, properly seasoned as directed for beef steak pie, in half a pint
of water or gravy, closely covered, for an hour or longer, according to its hardness ;
then pour it out into an earthenware dish, and, when cold, take some of the fat
off the top, if there is too much, and put, with the meat, as much of its liquor as it
will take, into the pie-dish ; then put on your crust, and bake it gently, till the crust
is nicely done, and serve up. If you have an oven to your range, you can bake the
meat in a dish, if you cover it closely with another dish. All seasonings for veal
pies, or chicken pies, must be only white pepper, salt, mace, and cloves, pounded, a
little grated lemon peel, and a few small mushrooms.
Beef-Steak Pie. —Divide two pounds of tender beef-steak into pieces about two
inches wide and four long; mix together three quarters of a tea-spoonful of black
pepper, a pinch of cayenne, a salt-spoonful of powdered allspice, and a tea-spoonful
of salt; sprinkle the steaks with this seasoning ; dredge them lightly with flour ;
cover the bottom of your pie-dish with a layer of seasoned steaks, then put in sea-
soning and steaks, dredged with flour, till all the steaks are in. Pour over the top
a tea-cupful of water, or gravy and one table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup. Cover
it with paste, and let it bake in a moderate oven, about one hour, or till the crust is
done. See also Meat Pies, above.
Meat Pies may also be made of the remains of any cold joints of mutton, veal,
pork, or beef; with or without a pigeon, or slices of cooked ham. In these cases,
the meat will not require any cooking, before it is put into the pie to be baked.
Baked Rice Pudding. —Pick out the discoloured grains, and wash clean in cold
w^e^ our ounces of the best rice; put it into a nice clean saucepan, with a pint and
a i ia . good milk, a quarter of the yellow part of the peel of a fresh lemon, grated
oft with a lump of sugar, a dried bay-leaf, and a bit of cinnamon, tied up in a bit of
clean muslin; four ounces of loaf sugar, and an ounce of butter; put it over a very
slow or slack fire, so that it only simmers, till quite tender, which will be in about
flail an flour, keeping it well stirred, to prevent it burning. Then take it off, take
out the spice bag, pour the pudding into a baking dish, and beat into it another ounce
of butter; then, when it is just lukewarm, beat up four eggs with a very small pinch


of salt, and strain them through a sieve into the pudding: mix it well up together,
grate a little nutmeg over the top of it, and bake it in a slow oven till it sets.
Or GROUND RICE, treated the same way, will make an excellent pudding .
the proportion should be, six ounces of the best ground rice to two pints ot nice
06 Baked Custards, or Baked Custard Pudding.—Simmer for ten minutes, a
bit of cinnamon, two dried bay-leaves, and half of a fresh grated lemon-peel, in a
quart of new milk, stir into it four ounces of powdered loaf sugar, and let it stand
till it is cold; then take out your spice hag, and mix it well with your milk, then
strain it through a hair sieve, into your dish, grate a little nutmeg on the top,
and bake it in a slow oven, with the door a little open, till it sets. If it once boils,
3t Baked Bread Pudding.—Most families have waste pieces of bread, bread-and-
butter, and toast, which if saved, and kept clean, will make a very good pudding,
thus:—Weigh your pieces of bread the day before you intend to make the puddm_,
and put two pounds weight of them to soak, in a pan, with cold water, a little more
than sufficient to cover them; put a plate on the bread, so as to keep the bread under
water, and soak it twenty-four hours. When you make your pudding, pour the
bread and water into a colander, press it as dry as you can, and return the bread into
the pan ■ then add to it rather more than one table-spoonful of flour, and six ounces
of treacle, or half a pound of moist sugar, the peel of a fresh lemon grated, four
ounces of currants, picked and washed, a dessert-spoonful of mixed spice, powdered,
four ounces of suet, chopped fine, or four ounces of sweet dripping, and six eggs.
Mix the whole well up together with a wooden spoon; grease your baking-dish
with a little butter; put the whole into it, and let it bake in a slack oven about
Bread-and-Butter Pudding.—Pick and wash, as directed for Christmas pud-
ding, three ounces of currants, strew a few of them on the bottom of your baking-
dish. Cut several very thin slices of bread-and-butter off a small loaf; pare ott
a part of the crusts, and lay some of the slices on the bottom and around the sides
of the dish ; over this layer pour some of the custard mixture, and sprinkle some
of the currants : and then two other layers of the bread-and-butter with custard and
currants bet ween them. Among the currants you may also sprinkle a little chopped
candied lemon or orange-peel. —Over this, pour the rest of the Custard mixture,
made thus:—beat up four eggs with one pint of milk, two ounces of powdered loaf
su-mr, and a table-spoonful of ratafia; and pour it over the bread-and-butter, as
before directed, two hours before it is put into the oven, so as to soak into and
moisten the bread-and-butter. It will take about three quarters of an hour to bake.
Rich Bread Pudding, with Plums and Currants.—Let half a pint of milk
simmer for ten minutes with a roll of lemon peel, a blade of mace, a bit of cinnamon,
half a small nutmeg grated, and three ounces of loaf sugar, stirring it two or three
times; then strain it into a basin, and when it is cold, beat up and strain into it
three eggs, mixing the eggs and milk together,—then put into it three ounces 01.
raisins, washed, stoned, and chopped; three ounces of currants well washed and
picked; and three ounces of white bread crumbs; three ounces of beef suet, and a
tea-spoonful of flour,—mix the whole well up together into a pudding, put it into a
buttered mould, tie a cloth over it tight, and let it boil two hours and a half. -Ibis
pudding is best, if made the night before it is boiled. Serve it up with a quarter of
a pint of melted butter made thick, to which add either a glass of white wine, or a
glass of brandy, and two ounces of powdered loaf sugar.
Baked Batter Pudding.—To make this light and good, first put into a clean
pan half a pound of flour, then beat up in a basin four eggs, with a salt-spoonful of
salt, so as to mix the whites and yolks well together: add to them a pint of milk
and half a pint of water, mixing the eggs with the milk and water well together:
strain about a fourth part of it through a sieve on to the flour, and mix both well
together, till it is quite smooth and free from lumps; then strain on to it the rest of
the eg<*s, milk, and water, a little at a time, beating the batter well together with a
wooden-spoon, all the time; and when the whole is well mixed, continue to beat it
for a quarter of an hour longer, just as if you were heating up eggs to a froth:


butter a baking-dish, pour the batter into it, sprinkle on the top a few small pieces
of butter, and bake it one hour.
BOILED PUDDINGS.
Take care that the cloth in which a pudding is to be boiled is quite sweet and
clean, or your pudding will have a bad taste. When you use it, dip it in boiling
water, squeeze it rather dry, aud dredge the inside of the cloth with flour, before
you put the pudding into it, or it will break in turning out. The water must always
boil before you put a pudding into the pot; and you should put a plate into the
saucepan, before you put in the pudding; or you will be obliged to move it about
every five or ten minutes, to prevent it from sticking to the bottom and getting
burnt. 4
To keep your pudding-cloth nice and clean, wash it, without soap, when done
with; and after washing, rinse it well in clean water, and dry it at once. No other
way will keep it sweet.
When your pudding is done, dip it in a pan of clean cold water, then untie the
cloth, and the pudding will turn out without sticking to it. If you boil a pudding
in a mould, or in a basin, it must be well buttered in the inside before the pudding
is put into it.
Bread puddings, or custard puddings, should always be boiled in moulds ; and
you must let them stand about five minutes after they are taken up, before you turu
them out.
Apple Pudding. —Chop four ounces of beef suet very fine, and mix it well with
a pound of flour, and a salt-spoonful of salt; to which add by degrees cold water to
make it into a stiff paste; divide it into two pieces, one for the bottom crust, the
other to cover over the top : roll both pieces out, but thinnest at the sides ■ lay
your pudding cloth in a colander or large basin, flour the inside of the cloth, put in
your largest piece of paste, and on that the apples, peeled, cored, and sliced; sprinkle
among them four ounces of moist sugar, six cloves, and the peel of half a fresh
lemon grated : slightly wet the edges of your other piece of paste, and join the
edges of the two pieces of paste together, and dredge the edges thus joined with
flour: tie the cloth, put it into a saucepan of boiling water, with a plate at the
bottom, aud boil it two hours to two hours and a half.
Beebe Steak or Mutton Pudding. —Well mix two ounces of finely-chopped
suet, and kalf-a-tea-spoonful of salt, into one pound and a half of flour; then make
it into a stiff paste, with as little water as needful.
Grease the inside of the pudding-basin with lard, or dripping, and lay a thin,
crust of the paste round the sides, but not too close to the bottom, or it will suck up
the gravy. Cut the steaks or mutton into pieces, season them with pepper and salt
to your taste, and put the fattest pieces at bottom : when about half full, pour in a
table-spoonful of ketchup, and a quarter of a pint of luke-warm water. Add the
rest of the steaks, or other meat, seasoned, and cover the whole with the rest of the
stiff paste, rolled out to shape. Well close the edges, and tie a clean cloth over it,
first having dipped the doth into hot water, and floured that part of it which is to
go next the crust. Put it into the saucepan, into boiling water, and let it be kept
boiling gently for about three hours, taking care to keep it well covered with water.
When done, remove the cloth, tarn it out of the basin into a dish, and serve it up.
If properly done, it will have plenty of gravy.
Kidney puddings, and all other meat puddings, are made the same way, ; the meat
being first cut into pieces.
Christmas Plum Pudding.— -Pirst, carefully look over one pound and a quarter
of currants, then put them into a clean colander, with a plate on the top of them,
and put the colander into a clean pan nearly full of pretty warm w r ater, then take off
the plate, and wash the currants well with your hands: repeat this, if the water that
escapes is the least dirty or gritty: But as soon as the water runs clear through the
currants, take them out of the colander, put them into a dean cloth, doubled lightly
over them, to keep them warm, aud there let them drain and swell for a quarter of
an hour;—then turn them into a dish, and look over them very carefully, a few at a
time, to pick out the stones. Next, pick from the stalks, and very carefully stone,


one pound and a quarter of rich Muscatel raisins; which do not require to be
washed. , , , ~ ~
Your fruit being thus prepared, finely shred and chop one pound and a quarter ot
sweet beef suet, aud mix it, with the fruit, in a pan large enough to contain all the
ingredients, into ten ounces of flour, ten ounces of finely grated stale Irench bread
crumbs, eight ounces of powdered loaf sugar, one ounce of finely ground spice, made
of equal parts of mace, cloves, and nutmeg, half a tea-spoonful of ground ginger, and
half the peel of a fresh lemon grated. Break ten eggs into a basin, and well whip
them up with one small tea-spoonful of salt, and mix them with a pint of milk; but
before you pour it into the pan, mix up with the flour and fruit five ounces ot
candied lemon-peel, two ounces and a half of candied orange-peel, and two ounces
and a half of candied citron-peel, shred, or cut into thin pieces. Then strain the
eggs and milk to the other ingredients, aud well stir it about; add a gill ot brandy,
or a quarter of a pint of strong ale, and well mix the whole together with a strong
wooden spoon, which you will find rather hard work, for it must be pretty stm, and
well mixed. Now cover the pan, and set it by till next morning.
You should first mix the spice and sugar with the flour and bread crumbs; then
mix with this the candied peel, suet, and fruit; next the eggs and milk; and then
the brandy, or ale. Next morning, just before the water begins to boil, mix and
beat up your pudding thoroughly well again; put a plate into the pot, or copper, to
prevent the pudding sticking to the bottom, which it will otherwise do; then dip
the pudding-cloth into the hot water, squeeze it rather dry, and well flour the inside
of it: then put the cloth into a colander, pour and scrape all the pudding into it,
and tie it close and tight. Put it into enough water to cover it two or three inches,
cover the pot down, and let it boil six hours. It must be kept gently boiling all the
time, and be filled up occasionally with boiling water, as fast as the water boils away.
■When done, take it up, and put it, just as you take it out of the pot, into a colander,
which put into a pan of cold water, letting it remain covered with cold water from
three to five, minutes. This will bind it, and prevent it from breaking orfalling to
pieces; then take the colander out of the water, and let it drain a further fifteen
minutes: then carefully untie and open the cloth, the pudding still resting on the
colander: put the dish in which it is to be sent to table, on the top of the pudding,
and with the help of the cloth turn it over into the dish, and serve it up. It may
be served up with a little brandy sauce poured on the top of it, and with brandy-
sauce in a sauce-tureen. , . , ....
Brandy Sauce—is good thick melted butter, to each half pint ot which a gill ot
brandy and two ounces of lump-sugar have been added. In some families, the sauce
is made with sherry-wine instead of brandy; in other families, brandy accompanies
the Christmas plum-pudding to-table.
Boiled Batter Pudding. —lnto a clean pan put half a pound of flower; beat
up in a basin four eggs, with half a salt-spoonful of salt and a pint of milk, until
the yolks and whites are just mixed together; then strain them through a sieve on
to your flour, a little at a time, beating the whole up to a very smooth batter, rather
thicker than cream ; when the batter is smooth and well mixed, continue beating it
up with your wooden spoon a quarter of an hour longer, and pour it out directly into
a well-floured cloth, tying it tight. Or you may fill a buttered mould with your
batter, and tie a cloth tight over it. Put it into boiling water, and let it boil gently
for an hour and a half, to two hours.
Or this batter pudding may be poured into a pie- dish, with a few pieces of butter
scattered on the top, and baked from three quarters of an hour to an hour.
Batter for puddings in a basin or mould will take a quarter of an hour longer to
boil, than if boiled in a cloth.
Sauce for a Boiled Batter Pudding—is melted butter, with sugar, and a
little lemon juice : some families always add a glass of white wine to the butter.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR STEAMING.
The general directions which have been already given for boiling are equally
applicable to cooking by steam-; for many kitchen ranges now have steamers


attached to them: and steaming, for many kinds of food, is much easier and
cleaner.
If, therefore, you have a steamer to your range, be careful to keep it perfectly
clean, which may be easily done by following the directions given for keeping sauce-
pans and stewpans clean. Your chief care must be to keep it steaming from the
time the thing to be dressed is put into the steamer till it is done; for in steaming
you can cook by time with the greatest certainty. To make sure of this, take the
key out of the tap of the boiler, or tie a cloth round it, so that no one can draw off
the water from the boiler, and so stop the rising of the steam. Another precaution
necessary for this purpose, is to keep the fire in your grate bright and fierce against
the side and back of the boiler. And if the fire should want fresh coals, while you
are steaming, put them on only a few at a time, and more towards the front of the
grate than usual.
_ To make a steam range answer properly for steaming, rake out all the ashes and
cinders from under the boiler every time you use it; otherwise the heat and flame
cannot act in the flues and draughts as they must do to make the steam-range act
well. The inside of the boiler must be cleaned out once in two months, especially
at the mouth of the pipe which lets in the cold water, and at the mouth of the tap by
which the hot water runs out; as well as the inside of the tap itself; which latter
can be done by thrusting a piece of copper wire up and down it, while the water runs
through the tap. The little balance cistern, which regulates the supply of water to
the boiler, should also be cleaned out at the same time, taking care not to bend or
disturb the handle of the ball-cock, because just as that is bent up or down so will the
height of the water in the boiler be, which should always stand about an inch and a
half to two inches from the top of the inside of the boiler.
In cooking by steam you can do several things at once, in the same steamer, as
easily as you can one only. For example, suppose you have a dinner to cook, con-
sisting of a stuffed oyster of veal, which is usually served up with parsley and butter
sauce, pickled port, carrots and potatoes, and peas-pudding, —first put in your pickled
pork on the false bottom, and your carrots at the side of it, because the veal being
white and delicate should not be discoloured by the pork : your veal must he put in
next, laying as little of it as you can on the pork, and your peas-pudding by the side
of that, in a cloth as usual. As soon as these are in, turn on your steam, and while
they are doing wash your potatoes quite clean in two or three waters, pare them,
and sprinkle them with salt; then put them into a cabbage-net, and according to the
length of time they will require to boil, put them into your steamer just so long
before the rest of the things will he done, turning off the steam for a moment, while
you put them in, but be sure to turn it on again directly. About three quarters
of an hour will steam middle-sized potatoes ; but large ones will take an hour.
Of course you will observe the same time in cooking, and serve up all the things
cooked this way, in the same manner as if boiled; the only difference will be that
there can be no dust or dirt among the food, and you will not have pots or saucepans
to clean; and what is still better, the liquor (which you must draw off by the tap in
front of the steamer two or three times while cooking,) will make excellent soup,
with almost any addition for flavouring and seasoning ; and the fat, which you can
take off from it when it is cold, will do better for frying things in than butter, lard,
or oil.
Another advantage in having a steamer is, that it is very convenient for many
other things, as for making apple-sauce,-jugging hare, and for warming up cold meat,
or poultry, by placing them inside the steamer in earthen vessels with covers to them,
or with a clean plate, or saucer, on the jug or basin, so as to prevent the steam drop-
ping into it. For example, if you want to make apple-sauce, you have only to pare,
core, and cut the apples as usual, and put them into a jug or jar, covered closely,
with a plate over the top, and they will cook in the steamer cleanly and nicely.
When you steam fish, first grease the tin fish-strainer with a little piece of butter
before you put the fish upon it to be steamed, by which means the fish will slide off
easily when you dish it up, and the skin will not stick in the least.
That there may be no occasion to draw off water from your boiler while steaming,
always have a tea-kettle of boiling water on the fire; especially for cooking greens,


peas, broccoli, cauliflower, Ac., which must be boiled in water, as they will not cook
so well in steamers.
OBSERVATIONS ON SOUPS, SAUCES, BROTHS, &c.
No one can ever be a good cook of either soups, gravies, or broths, who is not
particularly careful that the insides of the pots or saucepans which she uses to make
them in, are well tinned, and kept particularly clean; for if the inside of the covers,
and the inside of the stewpans, be not washed out with boiling water, as soon as
they are done with, and turned upside-down to drain, till there is time to rub them
quite dry with a warm cloth, the insides both of saucepans and covers will get tainted
with a musty, bad smell, which will give a disagreeable taste to all things afterwards
cooked in them. If they are not kept well tinned also, every thing cooked in them
which contains either sweet, sour, or salt, will take a disagreeable taste, and some-
times a disagreeable colour, from the iron ; and if the stewpan is of copper, and the
tinning not quite good and perfect, every thing cooked in it will be in a greater or a
less degree poisonous, as every thing which is sweet, salt, or sour, extracts verdigris
from copper, which is strong poison. , - , , .
Soup, sauce, gravy, or broth, must never be suffered to stand in a saucepan
or stewpan to get cold; but always be poured off while warm, into an earthen-
ware pan or dish ; which must be kept uncovered, and frequently stirred till it is
nearly cold. , . , r „ , .
Pieces of lean juicy meat, fresh killed, make the best broth or soup. If meat is
stale, broth made with it will have an unpleasant taste.
An excellent relish to flavour all brown soups and sauces, and heighten their colour,
may be made by frying sliced onions, until they are brown, in butter, with a little
flour and a little moist sugar dredged on them. They must be fried till they are
brown, and the pulp rubbed through a sieve.
The roots, trimmings, and gristles of tongues, and the gravy that runs out ol
hams, when cut, are all excellent for flavouring soups or gravies.
Cooks sometimes season soups too highly, and put in too much of things that have
a strono* flavour, as onion or garlic. They often season their soups like sauces ; not
considering that soup should always be mild, while sauces should be highly seasoned,
as they are to give a relish to anything of itself rather insipid.
The herbs and roots used must be thoroughly cleansed, and the water properly
proportioned to the quantity of meat and other articles ; allowing, in general, a quart
of water to each pound of meat, in making soups; but only half that quantity for
gravies or sauces. If care is taken to simmer slowly, and the cover of the stewpan
fits close, and is kept covered down, but a very little more water should be put in at
first than is expected to be left at the end.
To Dry and Preserve Herbs. — Herbs should be preserved when they are in the
best condition, and that is just at the time when they begin to blossom, as then the
flavour of the herb is in its highest perfection. The usual plan is to dry the herbs
in the open air, and then to tie them in white paper bags. But if you would have
the full flavour of herbs, you must first cut off all their roots, shake off as much ot
the dust as you can, and wipe off the remainder; and then, when they are quite clean
and dry pick the leaves off the stalks, and rub them to powder between your hands;
and sift it through the top of the flour-dredge. Put the sifted powder into bottles,
cork them up, and put them into a dry place. Dry one kind of herb at a time, and
put that into paper bags or small bottles, with labels on them, before you begin
another kind, in order to keep each quite distinct and separate from the other.
Mock Turtle Sour.— Get half a very fresh calf’s head, with the skin on, take
out the brains, wash and clean the head well, particularly inside of the nostrils and
ears and steep it for an hour in cold water; then put it into a stew-pan with six
quarts of cold water; set it on the fire to boil, skimming it till no more scum rises;
and let it simmer an hour and a halfthen take out the head, and when it gets cool
enough, cut it into pieces an inch to an inch and a half square; peel the tongue and
cut it into smaller pieces; put it all by in a deep pan, till next day, covering it over
with some of the liquor, to keep it from getting dry or hard on the outside. Then


put to the liquor in the stew-pan all the bones of the head, chopped or broken into
pieces, and all the trimmings, with four pounds of knuckle of veaL Skim it when it
gets to a boil; and let it boil quite gently, closely covered, for four or five hours,
taking care to stir it now and then, to keep it from burning 5 then strain off the
soup into an earthenware pan; stir it about now and then, till nearly cold; and put
it also by till next morning. The knuckle of veal will be good eating, with a little
parsley and butter sauce poured over it.
Next morning, take off the cake of fat on the top of both pans, and put the jelly
into a stew-pan, keeping hack the dregs or sediment. Peel and slice six ounces of
onions, fry them in a clean frying-pan, to a light brown colour, with two ounces of
butter, and two table spoonfuls of green sage leaves cut small; then stir in six
ounces of flour, let it brown a little, and then add some of the soup to liquify it;
stir it well about in the frying-pan till it boils up, and then gradually mix it all
together with the rest of the soup in the stew-pan, add the peel of a lemon pared
thin, a few green leaves of sweet basil, a little sweet marjoram, half an ounce of
ground pepper, and two blades of mace, pounded, with salt enough to season it.
Let the soup slowly simmer for an hour and a half, and then strain it through a
sieve, without rubbing. Put it into a clean stew-pan, and then put in all the pieces
of meat which you cut off the head, and the pieces of tongue, with two glasses of
sherry or good ginger wine, and the juice of one large lemon, strained; let the soup
and meat simmer very gently, but not boil, till the soup is quite tender, and it is
ready. Force-meat balls, and the yolks of two or three hard-boiled eggs, cut into
small dice, should be added to the soup about ten minutes before you take it off the
fire to serve it up.
For a cheaper soup you may use a cow-heel, or two pounds of the rind of pickled
pork, or two pounds of leg of beef, cut into pieces, instead of the knuckle of veal.
Forcemeat Balls, for Mock Turtle Soup, or Made Dishes. —Mince fine,
and pound in a mortar, a quarter of a pound of lean veal, mixing with it, as you
pound it, one ounce of nice fresh'butter; then take it out, and grate into the mortar
two ounces of stale bread-crumbs; moisten them with milk, mix among them a
dessert-spoonful, when chopped fine, of very clean parsley leaves, half a tea-spoonful,
when chopped fine, of shalots, and the yolks of one a half eggs boiled hard ; and
pound them smooth and well together in the mortar; then add to it the veal and
butter which you had first pounded. Mix and pouud the whole well together again,
dusting among it, as you do so, a quarter of a tea-spoonful of salt, half a tea-spoonful
of cayenne; add to it the yolk and white of one raw egg, rubbing it well into it;
and make the whole up into balls about the size of a nutmeg, squeezing each firmly
together. Use about eighteen balls to each tureen of soup.
Ox-tail Soup; —Divide three large, or four small tails, into joints, wash them
clean in luke-warm water, dry them, dredge them with flour, and fry them with a
little sweet dripping till they are of a light brown ; then put them into a stew-pan,
in which are nine pints of warm water. Slice two large onions into the frying-pan,
dredge them with flour, and a tea-spoonful of moist sugar, and fry them also till they
are of a nice brown; then add half a pint of the hot water from the stew-pan ; and
stir and rub it well about in the frying-pan till it boils, and is well mixed with the
gravy and browning, and then pour it all into the stew-pan to the tails. Put to
them fifteen berries of allspice, thirty black-pepper corns, and a few leaves of sweet
basil, all tied up in a muslin rag, and a carrot, washed, scraped, and sliced; put the
stew-pan over a slow fire, and stir it occasionally till it boils. Put on the cover of
the pan close, and let it slowly simmer by the side of the fire, till the meat is so
tender as to be easily slipped clean from the bones. It will take three hours, or
more. Then take out the tails, into a deep earthenware pan, and strain the soup
through a sieve on to them; put it by to cool; if till the next day, the better.
Half an hour or so before you want to serve it up, take away the cake of fat from
the top, cut the meat off the two largest joints of each tail into pieces, stir a tea-
spoonful of salt, half a salt spoonful of cayenne pepper, and two table spoonfuls of
ketchup, into the soup : put the whole into the stew-pan, and let it stew, but not
quite boil, for about half an hour, then pour it into a tureen, and serve it up.
If'not thick enough, mix a dessert-spoonful of flour, with a-cupful or two of the


soup, till it is quite smooth, and stir it well into the soup ten or fifteen minutes
before serving it up.
A piece or two of cow-heel, a couple of pig’s feet, or a few pieces of fresh porlcnnd,
are great improvements to soup.
Giblet Soup. —Scald, pick, and wash in warm water, two sets of geese or four
sets of duck giblets, two or three times ; cut off the bills, skin the feet, and cut the
necks and gizzards-into pieces; part the pinion bones, and put all into a stew-pan,
with a little more water* than enough to cover them ; add a pound of gravy beef, or
knuckle of veal, and let them do slowly ; skim the liquor when it is coming to a
boil; then add a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a small bunch of parsley well
washed, twenty-four blaok-pepper corns, and twelve berries of allspice : the herbs
and spices must be tied up in a muslin bag. Simmer the whole gently for an hour
and a half, till the gizzards are done tender, stirring it occasionally to keep it from
burning. Then skim off five or six table-spoonfuls of the fat liquor from the top of
the pot and mix one table-spoonful of flour with it quite smooth, and stir it well
into the soup on the fire, with a table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup ; keep stirring
it, while it simmers, a few minutes longer; then take out the spice-bag, pour the
soup into a tureen, and serve it up. . , .
These are examples of making soup; but very good soup may be made of
ox-cheek, leg of beef, and pieces of meat, or fowl, or game.
OBSERVATIONS ON MADE DISHES, STEWS, AND RAGOUTS.
The great art in preparing made dishes depends on mixing the different articles in
proper proportions so as to produce the true flavour required. Most of the obser-
vations on making soups are applicable to made dishes : and the utmost care should
be taken to cook them as gently as possible; for when ragouts, hashes, &c. are made
to boil ever so little, the meat will be hardened in a short time, or if left long boiling,
will be reduced to rags. The lid of a stew-pan or saucepan, while these dishes are
dressing should not be again taken off after the scum has been removed; but the
stew-pan must be often well shaken, to hinder the meat from sticking to the bottom.
Made dishes may be recommended for economy ; and meat dressed in this way
will often be found more grateful and nourishing than when only plainly fried,
boiled, or roasted, especially for elderly people. The great danger is in overdoing
the seasoning, and using too fierce a fire, or letting them continue too long on the
fire ; therefore, be careful in all these points, especially in using too much fire, or
too much seasoning.
HASHES AND RAGOUTS.
Ragout oe Veal. —Dishes prepared in this way are both savoury and nourishing.
Cut the bones out of a breast or other part of veal, and with them and the cuttings
make a strong broth, or stock, as it is usually called. Then cut the meat into
pieces about fourteen inches by two, and fry them with butter till they are of
a light brown colour; then lay them in the stew-pan, with enough of the stock
made from the bones, &c. to cover them ; and put in a little parsley, a few sprigsi ot
sweet herbs, four cloves, a blade of mace, a small onion peeled, six allspice, and the
peel of a small lemon. Cover it up close and simmer very gently, about two hours,
or till the meat is tender : then strain off all the liquor, and put the stew-pan, with
the meat, just near enough to the fire to keep warm. Melt an ounce and a halt ot
butter in a saucepan over the fire, and stir into it flour enough to make a stiff paste ;
then add gradually the gravy, with a tea spoonful of white pepper and salt to flavour
it • let it simmer about ten minutes ; then put to it a table-spoonful of lemon juice,
half a table-spoonful of ketchup, and a glass of white wine, and let it simmer up
Lay the veal in a ragout dish, and strain the sauce over it through a sieve. Garnish
with forcemeat balls and slices of lemon. . ,
A rabbit, or fowl, or any remains of cold poultry, may be cut up into pieces, and
dressed in the same manner, provided you have some stock to stew it in.
Jugged Habe.— Thoroughly wash and clean the hare, and divide it into con-
venient sized pieces ; put into a stone jar, which has a cover to fit it closely, a rasher


of fat ham or bacon, and half a pound of lean rump steaks ; now put in the hare, cut
into pieces, with a few sprigs of lemon thyme, sweet marjoram, and parsley ; some
lemon peel, pared thin, and a large onion with six cloves stuck in it; add half a pint
of water, and the juice of the lemon. Tie over the mouth of the jar a piece of cloth,
to keep in the steam. Lay some hay in the bottom of a saucepan, place the jar
upon it, and pour in water till it comes within two inches of the top of the jar; and
keep it in the kettle, with the water boiling, for three hours: or, if you have a
steamer, put the jar into the steamer, with first a piece of cloth, and then a plate over
the top of it, for the same time, Wheif the hare is done, strain off the gravy, and
skim the fat from the top; take out the onion, and thicken the gravy with flour ;
season it to your taste with pepper and salt, give it one more boil up, and it is ready.
Lay the hare in a deep dish and strain the gravy over it. A little cayenne pepper is
considered an improvement. The poulterer will cut up the hair for jugging, if you
wish it.
Harrtcot Mutton, or Beef. —Divide two pounds of meat into pieces fit to help
at table, and fry them in butter till of a light brown colour: peel about twenty
button onions, and let them boil in three pints of water for twenty minutes; put the
browned meat into a stewpan with the liquor in which the onions were boiled, strained
from them, adding white pepper and salt to your taste, and boiling water just to cover
the meat: take off any scum that may arise, and stew gently for an hour and a half,
or until the meat is tender. Then strain off the liquor in which the meat has been
stewed, and put it in a cool place till it is cold; placing the meat, covered up, in a
dish by the fire; pour some boiling water over the onions, and cover them up also to
keep warm. Have ready boiled one large, or two middle-sized carrots, and three
or four turnips, and cut them into slices, or balls, the size of a nutmeg, or small
dice. When the vegetables are ready, melt an ounce of butter in a saucepan, stir in
flour enough to make it stiff, and add, by degrees, the broth strained from the meat,
first taking off the congealed fat; stir the sauce till it boils, and then strain it into
another saucepan ; put in the carrots, turnips, and onions, and let it all simmer till
they are hot through. Lay the vegetables in a deep dish, and the meat around them,
with the sauce poured over them.
Game Harricot may be cooked in the same manner, and makes an exceedingly
nice and savoury dish.
A Rump Steak, cooked in this way, eats very fine.
To Hash Cold Meat. — A nice dish may be made from the remains of any cold
joints. Cutup the most underdone parts into small thin slices; pepper and salt
them, and dredge them lightly with flour : lay them in a clean dish, and cover them
over, to keep them from getting dry. Now break the bones, and put them, with
the hard brown outsides, pieces of skin, gristle, &c. into a saucepan, with a sliced
onion, a little pepper, and about a pint and a half of broth, or water ; boil it gently
over the fire for at least two hours; then strain it through a sieve into a dish or
earthenware pan, and let it stand till cold, when you must take off the cake of fat
from the top of it. Then put all the slices of meat, and the cold liquor made from
the bones, &c. into the stewpan ; mix with it a table-spoonful of ketchup/ and any
gravy you may have saved : let all simmer very gently, stirring it about every now
and then, for about tw'enty minutes, so that the slices of meat will get hot through;
but it must not boil, as that wrnuld harden the meat. Turn it out into a tureen or
warm clean dish, into w'hich sippets of toasted bread have been laid, and serve it up.
The remains of cold fowls, cold rabbits, or cold game, may be hashed and served
up in the same manner.
To Mince Yeal. —Cut up all the brown and dry parts into pieces, with the
grist es, bones, and skin, and stew them in a pint of water, or veal broth, for two
hours; adding to it half a teaspoonful of white pepper, the same of grated lemo n
peel, a small blade of mace, a little grated nutmeg, and two table-spoonfuls of milk :
then strain it through a hair sieve into a clean earthenware pan, to cool. Now
mince the remainder of the veal very small, dredge it with flour, sprinkle a very
little salt on it, and squeeze into it the juice of half a lemon. When the liquoris
cold, take off the fat from the top of it, and put the whole of the minced veal, and
all the cold liquor, into a clean saucepan, and keep stirring it over a gentle fire till it


is thoroughly hot, hut do not allow it to boil. Serve it up with sippets, in the same
manner as directed for hashed meats.
Veal Patties. —Minced veal may also he made into patties, or into scollops, if
the minced veal is only nicely seasoned, a little higher, with a little cayenne.
Chicken and Ham Patties, and Game Patties, may also be made in the same
manner, by mincing fine, and nicely seasoning, the portions of either of them that
may be left cold; using a little gravy to moisten and enrich the meat.
Mutton Broth. —Take two pounds and a half of the scrag end of the neck, and
cut out all unsightly pieces ; lay it in an earthenware pan, cover it with lukewarm
water for about ten minutes, aud wash it well. Put it on the fire with five pints of
cold water, let it simmer slowly, carefully taking off the scum, as it rises, till no
more appears; then add to it two middling-sized onions, two middle-sized turnips,
peeled and cut in half, two middle-sized carrots, a head of celery, a few sprigs of
parsley, and a tea-spoonful of salt. Simmer it gently for two hours longer, then
strain the broth through a hair sieve, skim off all the fat you can from tire top, and
serve it up. The meat may be served up at the same time, in a dish, with a cupful
of the broth poured over it for gravy, and the carrots sliced and laid round it; with
caper-sauce in a sauce-tureen.
DIRECTIONS FOR ROASTING.
This method of dressing meat may be thought easy and simple, but it really
requires more care and attendance than boiling or steaming, or even than many
made dishes.
In all but the highest families, roasting meat by a bottle-jack is the most usual
way, and will be found easy and economical. If you hang the jack in what is called
a roasting-cradle, or screen, made of tin, and something like a large Dutch oven on
feet, having a door behind to open when you baste the meat, you will require no
other dripping-pan than the one which is sold with them, nor dripping-pan stand,
as it comprises both in itself. This will do the meat better and quicker, aud with
less fire, than any other kind of meat screen.
Meat, and particularly beef or mutton, will not eat well, whatever pains may be
taken in roasting it, unless it has been first kept long enough to make it tender.
The time necessary for this purpose must depend on the age of the animal when
killed, and on the heat or cold of the weather.
The fire for roasting should be made up half an hour or so before it is time to put
the meat down, and the size of it must be proportioned to the weight of meat to be
dressed. A small thin joint would be scorched and spoiled if put down to a fire that
would be only just enough to roast a large thick joint. Hang the meat down to the
fire before it burns fiercely; but if you have allowed it to get fierce, hang it at a
greater distance.
The fat of the meat while roasting must be kept from being burnt, by tying over
it a piece of writing paper, and well greasing the paper and string with dripping,
before you put the meat down to the fire, or it will burn. Stir the fire as much as is
necessary before the joint is put down, and keep it free from smoking coals in front,
as they would injure the taste and appearance of the meat.
A large joint, if put close to the fire at first, will be scorched outside, and
never be properly done, nor be of a good colour. The distance of the meat from the
fire must depend on the size of the joint; for the larger and thicker it is, the further
off it must be hung. About twelve inches from the fire will be a proper distance for
a large joint when first put down ; when it is one-third done, put it two or three
inches closer • and when about two-thirds done, put it another inch or two still closer,
until it is finished. For a small joint, about ten inches from the fire is a good dis-
tance when you first put it down,—draw it two or three inches nearer at a time, as
before directed ; but every cookmaid must be guided by experience, and set the joint
nearer or farther off according to the heat of the fire, and to the thickness and
weight of the meat.
Whatever distance from the fire you put the roasting-cradle, of course the
dripping will fall into the pan belonging to it; but if you are obliged to use a
dripping-pan and stand only, take care to put the dripping-pan just near enough to


the fire to catch all the dripping, that it may not fall on the hot cinders on the
hearth, and raise a smoke, which would spoil the taste of the meat; at the same
time the dripping-pan must not be too close to the fire, lest any coals or ashes may
fall out of the fire into it, and so spoil both the dripping and the meat.
To preserve the dripping clean and good, it ought to he taken out of the well
with your basting-ladle once or twice while the meat is roasting, and strained
through a very fine tin strainer,, or a hair sieve, into a basin; for if all the dripping
is le*t in the pan till the meat is done, the heat of the fire will give it a disagreeable
taste and colour.
When the fire is properly made up, and everything in order, the old time rule
may be nearly followed, of allowing a quarter of an hour for every pound weight;
except for pork or veal, both of. which require full twenty minutes to the pound.
More or less time, however, will be required, according to the heat of the fire, and
thickness of the joint; and the meat will be best and soonest done when it is well
basted, as that will keep the outside tender, so that the heat can properly
penetrate it.
When the meat is about three parts roasted, the meat and dripping-pan must be
drawn back, and the fire again stirred, to make it burn bright and fierce, which is
necessary, towards the end of roasting, to give the meat a rich brown colour. At
this time, also, you should well baste the joint, and then sprinkle it with a little
salt, and dredge it with flour over every part.
It is a sign that the joint is about done enough, when the steam rising from it is
drawn towards the fire; but the cook will be best able to determine when the meat
is thoroughly dressed, by considering the weight and thickness of the joint, and the
heat of the fire; and you must also consider how the family like it done, so that
they may have it as they most approve of.
To Roast a. Sirloin, or Ribs of Beer.—As it is usual to hang meat a few
days, to make it tender, it contracts dust, and should be wiped with a clean cloth,
nice and clean. Well grease a piece of writing paper, and tie or skewer it on the
fat part, where it must remain till it is about three parts done, to prevent it burn-
ing. A good durable fire having been made up, the meat should be so hung down
that the thickest part of the joint may get the strongest part of the fire, and the
fattest part be uppermost: do not let it haug too near at first, but keep putting it
nearer as it gets on towards being done.
Put into the dripping-pan a little clean dripping, and baste it every ten or fifteen
minutes, till within half an hour of its being done. Then take the meat back from
the fire; clean out any grit that has fallen into the dripping-pan; take off the
paper that has covered the fat, and having stirred and re-made up the fire, put the
meat to the fire again, sprinkling a little salt over it, and dredging it with flour, and
let it hang till done.
Gravy for Roasted Meats.— When your meat is done, lay that end which is
the least roasted in a clean dish, before the fire, so that it may be done also; then
strain all the fat out of your dripping-pan into your basin, and put it away; next
wipe out of your pan any dust or cinders that may be in it, with a clean dish-cloth;
and then, for a joint of about ten pounds,, pour a good-sized cupful of boiling water,
with a little salt in it, into your dripping-pan, and with this water and your basting-
ladle, rub all the baked brown gravy off the pan, for nearly all the real gravy which
drops from the meat will be baked to the dripping-pan. When you have rubbed
and washed all the brown off the pan, mix it well together, and strain it through
a fine hair sieve into a. butter saucepan; simmer it gently over the fire till it is quite
hot, but not to boil, pour it over the meat, and serve it up. You will find it a good
nice brown gravy.
Horse-radish scraped tine should always be served up with roast beef; or a
sauce, made by grating the horse-radish, after it is washed, and mixing it with a
table-spoonful of sugar, a tea-spoonful of mustard, and half a gill of vinegar, all well
mixed, is considered a great improvement by some persons.
Yorkshire Pudding. —Beat up three eggs and.a pinch of salt together ; then
mix them well with a pint of milk, and strain it through a hair sieve : then mix it,
a little at a time, with nine ounces of flour, till you make it into a batter rather


stiffer than for pancakes. Place in the dripping-pan, under the meat, a shallow tin
dish, so that it may get quite hot, and be well greased, by the dripping falling into
it. Then pour in the batter; and when it is baked brown on the top, and set stilt,
cut it into squares, and turn it over, that it may be done on both sides. If it is
about an inch thick, it will be done, before a good fire, in about two hours; if three
quarters of an inch thick, in about an hour and a half. . .
A Haunch, or a Leg of Mutton—is roasted in the same manner as a sirlom
of beef; keen it well basted; and when about three parts done, well baste the meat,
sprinkle it with a little salt, and dredge it well with flour. The thick part of the
leg should hang uppermost, till it is about two-thirds done. Serve either with
venison sauce, oyster sauce, or onion sauce. _ _
A Saddle of Mutton —is a favourite dish in most families. The butcher
should take off the skin, and skewer it on again; this preserves the meat from being
burnt, and keeps it juicy and tender. About half an hour before it is done, take on
the skin, sprinkle the joint with salt, baste it, and dredge it with flour. This joint,
like the haunch of mutton, is usually sent up with venison sauce.
A Loin, or Shoulder of Mutton—may be roasted in a similar manner. In
some families, a shoulder of mutton is served up with onion sauce.
Venison Sauce. —Mix some currant-jelly and a table-spoonful or two of port-
wine, in a clean stew-pan or clean butter saucepan, and set it over a slow fire till
melted ; then stir it till quite hot, and pour it into your sauce-tureen.
A Roast Fillet of Veal. —This joint having been stuffed with veal stuffing,
should be hung not too close to the fire, and kept well basted. It will take at least
three hours, if the weight be about ten pounds. The fire must be kept up, or it will
not be done. A piece of well-greased writing paper, or, what is better, a piece of
the fat caul, should be skewered on to the veal, to keep in the stuffing, and save it
from burning. When about half done, take it down from the fire, and change its
position, so that the parts now exposed to the fire are those which previously were
farthest from it. Dredge it with flour ; and again, about half an hour before it is
quite done. When you take it up, make gravy, as directed for roasted meat, and
add to it rather less than half a pint of melted butter, made not too rich with
butter. Serve it up with boiled ham, or tongue, and garnish with slices of
lemon. . . .
To make Veal Stuffing.—Chop four ounces of suet very fine, and mix with it
four ounces of stale bread crumbs, and half the peel of a lemon, grated; add as much
clean finely chopped parsley as will fill a table-spoon, a very small tea-spoonful of
winter savoury, the same of lemon thyme, and a small tea-spoonful of knotted
marjoram ; well mix all together, with a salt-spoonful of grated nutmeg, a small
tea-spoonful of white pepper, the same of salt, and a quarter of that quantity of
cayenne. Make the whole into a stuffing, with one egg and a tea-spoonful of milk,
or with two eggs. A little pork-sausage-meat added to this stuffing is by some
considered an improvement; so is a tea-spoonful of the liquor of an anchovy, boiled
and strained, and a tea-spoonful of ketchup.
An Oyster, or the Chump-end of a Loin of Veal, may he stuffed and roasted
in the same manner.
Roast Lamb.—A quarter of lamb will take from one hour and a half to two Hours
and a half roasting, according to its size, and should be served up with mint sauce.
A leg or shoulder of lamb is asuallv served up with mint sauce.
Mint Sauce. —Wash half a handful of fresh spear-mint nice and clean, pick the
leaves from the stalks, mince the leaves quite fine, and put them into a sauce-tureen,
with two tea'spoonfuls of sugar; mix it and rub it well with the mint to melt the
sugar; and two minutes before you want it, put to it three table-spoonfuls of
vinegar: stir it well together, and serve it up. . -
To Roast Poultry.—A turkey should be stuffed in the craw with veal stuffing,
and hung down to a clear good fire. It will take from two to three hours roasting,
according to its weight; and should be served up with rich brown gravy in a sauce-
tureen. A goose, for roasting, should be stuffed with sage and onion, the onions being
first parboiled, and chopped fine, to which a little stale bread crumbs have been
added. A goose takes about an hour to an hour and a half. Capons and other large


fowls are usually stuffed with veal stuffing, and served up the same as turkev • they
take about an hour to an hour and a half, and are served up with rich brown'gravy.
A QmcK-MADs Rich Gravy.—When only a little gravy is wanted, put a piece
ot butter, the size of a walnut, and a quarter of a pound of gravy beef, scored pep-
pered and salted, into a small stew-pan or saucepan, with a middling sized onion
sliced on the top of it: place it by the side of the fire, to draw the gravy for half
an hour ; then add a slight dust of flour, a few allspice, and a little boiling water,
very little at a time, till you have a quarter of a pint, rubbing the meat about each
time you put in the water. Some add a little ketchup. It must not boil but
simmer gently till wanted, and strain it through a hair sieve, for use. If more gravy
is required, use double the quantity of every thing.
A Roast Leg of Pork may be deemed a winter joint, as pork is considered to he
best in season from Michaelmas to the end of April; hence the saying, « that pork
is best when there is an rin the month.” Before you put pork down to the fire,
rub the rind well with about a dessert-spoonful of salad oil or sweet dripping, which
will save it from burning, and make it eat nicer and crisper. You should also score
it with a sharp knife, the cuts being about half an inch apart. It should then be
stuffed with sage and onion stuffing, made mild by mixing with it about two table-
spoonfuls of stale bread crumbs.
A leg of pork requires rather longer time than other joints of the same weight,
and should not be hung too close to the fire at first, but neared gradually as it roasts.
Repeatedly basting it will make it eat nicer, and keep the skin from blistering. A
C* uT pounds will take three hours’ roasting to do properly; and on no account
should it be eaten until well done, as underdone pork is most unwholesome.
It should be served up with apple sauce; and. if not stuffed, also with sage and
onion sauce; m separate tureens. Other joints of roast pork are cooked in the same
manner, and similarly served up, the difference in weight and thickness making the
difference in the time for roasting.
Sage and Onion Stuffing.—Peel two middling-sized onions, and boil them for
about ten minutes; take as much dry sage leaves as when rubbed into powder will
hit a tablespoon; squeeze the onions dry, chop them fine, and mix it with the
crumbled sage; then add to them a tea-cupful of stale white bread crumbs, a tea-
spoonful of black pepper, a very little pinch of cayenne, and a salt-spoonful of salt:
mix all well together, and it is ready. You may use green sage leaves, if you chop
them fine. J 1
Apple Sauce.—Pare and core four or five apples into a clean saucepan, with two
table-spoonfuls of water: cover the saucepan close, and place it over a slow fire until
the apples are quite soft. Then pour off the water, and beat them up with a piece of
butter the size of a nutmeg, and a dessert-spoonful of powdered lump-sugar. Serve
it up in a sauce-tureen.
Or, put them into a stone jar, and place it in a saucepan, to boil; when soft,
bruise them well, with butter and sugar.
To Roast a Sucking-pig.—A sucking pig must be nicelv cleansed inside and
outside, and particularly the ears, nostrils, and under the tail, which is best and
easiest done by a skewer on which a bit of rag is tied, which should be pushed through
the orifice from the inside, and the whole of the inside then carefully wiped with a
clean damp cloth. Make a stuffing of two dozen good-sized sage leaves, four ounces
of stale bread crumbs grated fine, and one ounce of butter broken into small pieces,
mixed well together, with a tea-spoonful of pepper, and as much salt; put all into
the belly of the pig, and sew it up.
Now rub the outside of the pig with a table-spoonful of salad-oil, mixed with the
yolk of one egg; cover the loins with a piece of well-greased writing paper, and
hang it down to a good fire; baste it well and often, and hang it, now higher, then
lower, and afterwards reverse the ends, so that the rump and shoulders may be
equally well done : half an hour before it is quite done, take the paper from the loin,
and haste it with a little butter; and, when it looks well done, take it down, and put
the ends to the fire, to finish them ; then cut off the head, split it into two halves,
and take out the brains to make brain-sauce with, and cut the body down the back
the entire length, and lay the two sides back to back, with the crackling upwards, in


a clean dish, and place it with the ends to the fire, while you make the brain sauce.
It must he served up with rich brown gravy, with brain sauce, and apple sauce.
Brain Sauce.—Before the pig is served* up, take out the brains, chop them very
fine with about a table-spoonful of the stuffing taken from the inside of the pig, and
all the gravy which runs from the pig when it is cut in half; then put it all into a
butter saucepan, with a large table-spoonful of melted butter; give it a warm up,
stirring it all the time, and serve it up in a sauce-tureen.
To Roast an Ox Heart, or Calf’s Heart.—First cut off the pipe and deaf
ears, from the top of the heart, then lay it in cold water to soak for about half an
hour, and w r ash the blood out of the holes clean ; then put it into hot water point
upwards, for a quarter of an hour, which will finish cleansing it, and get the blood
out from the point of the heart; and to prevent the fat sticking to the roof of the
mouth, when it is eaten, boil it for a quarter of an hour. Then wipe dry all over,
and to the bottom of the holes : stuff them full of veal stuffing, and tie a piece of
clean white paper, well greased, over the top, to keep it in ; and hang the heart,
point downwards, to a soaking fire: w r ell baste it with clean sweet dripping every
ten minutes, and allow it twenty minutes, or longer, to each pound, as it should do
gradually at first, aud takes more time than veal or pork.—Serve it up in a hot
water dish and cover, with rich brown gravy in a sauce tureen, and with potatoes.
OBSERVATIONS ON BROILING.
Let the gridiron for broiling be always quite clean on the top and between the
bars. Just before using it, wipe the bars first with a piece of paper, and then with
a clean dish-cloth dipped in salt. Rub the bars over, when heated, with a little suet
or fat, and wipe them again. The fire should be clear for broiling ; for nothing can
be broiled properly without a clear bright fire, which gives a good heat.
Chops or slices of meat, for broiling, ought not to be more than three quarters of
an inch thick, otherwise the outside will be scorched before the inside can be done
enough.
A dish, and as many plates as will be wanted, should be set to warm, when chops
or steaks are put on the gridiron, as they must be served up as hot as possible.
To Broil Steaks or Chops.—Steaks for broiling should be cut from half to
three quarters of an inch in thickness. If some pieces of steak happen to be a little
thicker, they should be allowed rather longer time for dressing. Pepper your steaks
or chops, and when the fire is hot enough, throw a little salt on to it, to make it
burn clear; then put the gridiron over it to get hot; place it slanting, that the fat
may not fall into the fire and make a smoke; clean the gridiron, grease the top of
the bars, and then put the steak on it, and turn it often. It will take from ten
minutes to a quarter of an hour to broil. When you put on the steaks, or chops,
put your dish to the fire, with a tea-spoonful of mushroom ketchup and a tea-spoonful
of hot water in it to each pound of meat; and as you take up each steak, put it into
the dish, sprinkle it with a little salt, and rub a piece of butter, about the size of a
nut, on each steak. Serve up the steaks in the gravy, garnished with scraped horse-
radish. Mutton Chops are usually sent to table with pickles, and without rubbing
any butter on them ; but with the same gravy in the dish.
Kidneys.—Cut them through lengthways; season them with pepper and salt;
then pass through them a wire skewer, to prevent them curling, and that they may
be evenly broiled. Put them on the gridiron, over a clear but slow fire, and turn
them often, for about ten minutes, or rather longer, if necessary, that they may be
well done. Rub them over in the dish with a very little butter, and serve them up
with a little ketchup, mixed with a tea-spoonful of boiling water.
Pigeons, or any Small Birds.—Let them be nicely cleaned, sprinkled with
pepper and salt, and broiled over a clear but not a fierce fire. Turn them frequently,
while broiling, and put a little butter on them, as they are cooking.
When done, put them in a dish, and pour over them melted butter, mixed with a
little ketchup, and made quite hot: then serve them up.
Toasted Rashers of Ham, or Bacon.—New bacon, or freshly-cured bacon,
should be procured for toasting ; the rashers of either ham or bacon should be cut
about one-sixth of an inch thick. Cut off the rind, and also the outside of the


bottom; when so 3one, hang them on the hooks, or on the skewer, of a tin toaster,
which stands before the fire ; when done on one side, turn the hooks of the toaster,
and then do it on the other side, keeping it so far from the fire that no dust or cinders
can possibly fall into it; but if such an accident happens, you must throw away the
gravy, and wash the bacon in boiling water, and slightly toast the rashers again,
taking care to catch all the gravy which drops from it; and serve it up in a hot "dish,
gravy and all. Many families have the bacon and gravy served up, with bread, or
dry toast, for breakfast, merely on account of its superior healthfulness to bread and
butter, or buttered toast, for breakfast.
To fry bacon in a frying-pan is the most wasteful way it can be dressed, and is
now considered discreditable.
Cold boiled bacon, or ham, cut into slices a quarter of an inch thick, with a little
crust of bread grated over them, and laid in a cheese-toaster, before the fire, till they
are brown on both sides, are very good for breakfast. About three minutes for each
side will be enough for them, with a bright fire.
DIRECTIONS FOR FRYING.
Every time a frying-pan is used, it must be made quite clean; the best way to do
this is to warm it gently, and wipe it clean, first putting in a dessert-spoonful of
salt, and rubbing it well with a piece of paper, and then with a clean dish-cloth,
taking care to scrape off anything which may stick either to the sides or bottom of
the pan, before you use the cloth, for if you ’do not do this, it will make whatever
yon fry stick to the pan, and burn, and look dirty.
Butter, lard, dripping, or oil, will do to try with, provided it is clean and sweet
but clean top pot is the best fat to fry fish in : it must be made boiling hot before
you put the fish in the pan. If there is salt in the fat or dripping, it will prevent
whatever is cooked in it from browning. It is, therefore, better always to clarify
your dripping. To try if the fat is hot enough for fish, throw in a piece of crumb
of bread, about the size of a walnut, and if it quickly becomes a fine light brown, it
is of a proper heat.
To Fry Sausages.—Cut them singly, and put them in a frying-pan with a very
small piece of dripping : let them fry rather slowly, over a clear but by no means a
fierce fire ; and continue the frying till they are nicely browned all over, often turning
them, and shaking the pan, to prevent burning or sticking to the pan. Do not prick
them or break the skins. When done, lay them in a hot dish. Now pour out the
fat, and then dredge a little flour into the pan, and as soon as it becomes a light
brown, rub a little butter into the flour, and add to it a cupful of boiling water, and
a dessert-spoonful of ketchup; stir the whole well about the pan till it boils, and pour
it through a hair sieve over the sausages. Then toast a round of bread from a loaf,
till it is of a light brown colour; cut off the crust, and lay the toast, divided into six
pieces, in a dish; put the sausages with the gravy upon it, and serve up.
To Fry Rump Steaks.—Steaks ought to be cut from three quarters of an inch to
one inch thick for frying.
Pepper, but do not salt them, as that makes them hard. Put a little sweet drip-
ping into your frying-pan, set it over the fire, and as soon as it is well melted, put in
the steaks, and turn them often, till they are done enough on both sides, but do not
prick them in turning. When the steaks are done, take them out of the pan, rub a
small piece of butter over each steak,.salt them a little on both sides, and serve them
in a hot dish. Make gravy the same as for sausages.
Mutton, Lamb, or Pork Chops, may be fried in the same way, but must have
no butter rubbed over them previous to being served up. Pork chops should be
dipped in egg, and have crumbs of sage sprinkled over them; and lamb chops should
be dipped in egg, and be sprinkled with fine bread crumbs, and finely chopped parsley.
Gravy may also be made for them, the same way as directed for sausages.
Rump Steaks and Onions.—Peel and slice four or five large onions; put them
into the frying-pan, with a little salt aud a little dripping mixed among them, cover
them with a dish, for about fifteen minutes, but stirring them once or twice ; then
remove the dish, aud fry them till they become brown and tender, stirring them now
and then to keep from burning. When done, turn them out into a vegetable dish,


and cover them close. When you have got the onions into a dish, fry your steaks
with a little more dripping, and when done, put. them into a hot dish; pour off the
fat from the frying-pan, and dredge the pan with a little flour, and when it becomes
a light brown, put in a bit of butter, the size of a walnut, a tea-cupful of hot water,
a table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and a little pepper; rub and mix it all well
together in the pan, and when it boils, strain it through a hair sieve into the dish
your steaks are in, and serve up as hot as possible.
Liver and Bacon. —Cut some calf’s liver into slices about half an inch thick.
Melt two ounces of nice clean dripping in a frying-pan; dredge the sliced liver with
flour, and fry it over a pretty quick fire. Then fry or toast rashers of bacon, lay the
liver in a hot dish, and the bacon upon it. Make gravy the same way as for rump
steaks or sausages; strain it through a sieve to the meat, and serve up.
Pancakes. —Beat up four large eggs with a salt-spoonful of salt, and mix them
well with a pint of milk; strain it through a sieve into a jug, and mix well with it,
by degrees, eight ounces of flour, in a basin, half a nutmeg grated, and the peel of
half a fresh lemon, grated; whisk all well together into a very smooth batter, about
the thickness of good cream. Well clean your frying-pan, which should be a small
pan, put it over a clear brisk fire, and as soon as the bottom is just hot, put in a piece
of good sweet dripping or lard, about the size of a walnut, and when it is melted
pour in a cupful of batter sufficient to make a pancake, moving the pan round, that
the batter may be spread over the bottom of it; shake the pan, and when you think
one side is enough done, run a knife round the edges, and toss or turn it quickly.
Pry the other side carefully, and when done, lay the pancake on a hot dish before the
fire; strew a little sugar over it, and when the next is done, lay that on it, with a
little more sugar on it; and so on, till all are done. Serve up, a few at a time, as
hot as possible.
INSTRUCTIONS POR COOKING VEGETABLES.
Vegetables are in the highest perfection when most plentiful, and those of a mid-
dling size are much better than when very large or very small; but the most im-
portant thing is to have them quite fresh. Potatoes, parsnips, and carrots, may, with
proper care, be kept in a state fit for eating for many months; but cabbages, broccoli,
asparagus, green peas, and similar vegetables, must be used quite fresh, to have them
good and nice.
Turnips must be peeled as deep as you find them stringy, and if large, cut them
in two, and throw them into clean cold water for half an hour; —then put them into-
boiling water, in a very clean saucepan, without heing covered down, and without
any salt in it, and boil them about an hour; —then try them with a fork, and if they
feel tender all through, drain them, and mash them with a wooden spoon through a
clean earthenware colander; then mix them up in a hot vegetable dish with a little
butter, or a little cream, white pepper, and salt; score it into squares or diamonds;
and serve up hot
Cabbages, cauliflowers, broccoli, and several other similar vegetables, require to be
carefully looked over, to be cleaned from slugs, or insects, and all other impurities.
The outside leaves, or any others that are shrivelled or decayed, must be taken off,
and the ends trimmed. After nicely washing them, lay them, head downwards, and
completely covered, in a deep pan of clean cold water, with a table-spoonful of salt
dissolved in it, for an hour before they are dressed, which will help to draw out any
insects or dirt which you could not get at in the washing, as well as make them mild
and sweet.
Green vegetables, in general, must be boiled in a clean saucepan by themselves,
with plenty of water, with a little salt in it; putting them in the same pot with meat
will always spoil the colour and flavour of both. But green peas shonld be boiled in
only a little water, and spinach in a smaller quantity of water than green peas. The
other vegetables generally require enough water to swim in, and be completely covered.
You must make the water boil, and then throw in a little salt; take off the scum as
it rises; and when there is no more scum, and the water is clear, put in the greens,
cabbages, cauliflower, or whatever it may be, and press them down, now and then,
under the boiling water, till the vegetables become tender, and sink; then take them


out diredxly; for if they are left, they will lose their colour anTmumii. ""TfiTt Cater
should be well drained from them before they are served up. The utmost attention
is necessary in dressing vegetables, for when they are quite done, a minute longer
boiling will spoil them ; yet they must be done tender, or they will be unhealthy.
The nice colour of green vegetables will be preserved, by putting into the water
with them a piece of soda, or pearlash, the size of a nut, for a four quart saucepan.
This should always be done when you are obliged to boil vegetables in hard water,
or if they should be a little stale; but green peas, or asparagus, or any similar delicate
vegetables, would be quite spoiled if the smallest piece of soda or pearlash were
boiled with them.
