Christian Friends and Brethren, —
Having recently recovered from a severe and long-protracted illness, during
which my pastoral duties were necessarily either altogether omitted or very im-
perfectly discharged, I am earnestly desirous, with the recovered health and
strength with which our Heavenly Father has been pleased to favour me, to
resume the regular discharge of these duties in a more efficient manner than
heretofore, in the way of pastoral visitation.
At the same time it is a duty I owe to myself to state that the discharge of
my pastoral duties has for years past been greatly interfered with, as it still is,
from another cause—l mean the numerous and urgent claims on my time and
services, not only on the part of the poor and afflicted, who entail upon me be-
sides a very serious pecuniary burden from which most of my brethren are exempt,
but of persons of all classes throughout the colony, who, from my long residence
in this country, and the public and influential position I have occupied so long
as a member of the Legislature, appeal to me in their difficulties for informa-
tion, advice, and assistance; thereby subjecting me to a great loss of time which
might otherwise be devoted to my pastoral duties, as well as to much personal
inconvenience and trouble. In short, I have, in great measure, become a
virtual overseer for the poor and a general agent for persons of all classes
throughout the colony.
May I request therefore that, excusing all past omissions on my part, the
members of the congregation generally will in future not only give a more con-
scientious attendance on the means of grace and the ordinances of religion than
some of them have been doing for some time past, but that they will use their
influence with those of their brethren with whom they may come in contact to
induce them to give their personal attendance also, that the congregation may
not go down, as it has been doing through my own lack of service for the past
year or so. And as there are not a few who professedly belong to the congrega-
tion, and who regularly apply to the pastor when they require to do so, as in
the case of baptisms, but who contribute nothing for the support of the ordi-
nances of religion, I would remind all such of their culpable neglect of a solemn
duty, as well as of the great injustice of their procedure in thereby throwing an
additional burden upon the shoulders of others. There are not a few families of
this class connected with the maritime pursuits of the colony whose interest
and whose duty it is to support the ordinances of religion, and who are quite as
able to do so as the dwellers on land. May I request those whom it concerns
to give their attention to this matter 1
It is always unfortunate for a minister of religion when his income depends
upon a few only ; and the small contributions of the many are much likelier to
build up any church than the larger contributions of the few. Let us endeavour
therefore to realize this better state of things by exhorting and encouraging one
another. lam well aware that the colony has been suffering under a period of
great depression for a long time past, and that many families and individuals,
both of the middle and humbler classes of society, have long had the utmost
difficulty in providing for their bare subsistence; but, as the colony appears to
be now slowly recovering from this temporary depression, I trust we shall
speedily realize a more gratifying state of things both temporally and spiritually.
In the mean time, commending you all to the blessing of our Heavenly
Father,
I remain, Christian friends and brethren,
Your affectionate pastor,
JOHN DUN MORE LANG.
