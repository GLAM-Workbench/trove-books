JOSEPH JOHN WATTS,
Who died at his Eesidence,
SMITIIFIELD, N.S.W.,
December 17th, 1873, Aged 67 years ;
AND OF HIS BELOVED WIFE
JANE WATTS,
Who died August 30th, 1889,
AGED 82 YEARS.
“ljc givetb Rls beloved sleep.”-Ps. 127. 2v.
Time hurries on, and years roll swiftly by,
Calling our loved ones to their home on high ;
Change and decay on every side appear,
And lonely hearths receive the silent tear.
As if but yesterday we seem to see
Those happy faces lighted up with glee,
To hear their cheery welcome, and to feel
Their hand press ours with grip as true as steel.
Their lives were nobly lived without display,
No suppliant for help was turned away
From their wide open door, and to life’s end
The poor and needy found in them a friend.
Rut death’s cold hand was placed upon the brow
Of him who knows no earthly sorrow now;
In humble faith he took the Saviour’s hand,
And crossed in triumph to the Gloiy Land.
A widow’s grief! who but the tried can know
Its bitter anguish or its depth of woo!
Rut not for long was parting to be borne,
For soon the weary heart would cease to mourn.
A still, small voice proclaimed the new born day
And whispered, “Sister Spirit, come away;”
Then, smiling sweetly amid death’s alarms,
She sank to rest within her daughter’s arms.
Ah ! they have long since met on that bright shore
Where pain and sorrow enter never more,
Where angels dwell beneath a cloudless sky,
And Jesus wipes the tear from every eye.
—S.E.W.
