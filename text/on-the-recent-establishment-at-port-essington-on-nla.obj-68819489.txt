[.? On the recent Establishment at Port Essington, on the
Northern Coast of Australia. Extract from a letter of Captain
Sir J. Gordon Bremer, Royal Navy. Communicated by
Sir John Barrow, Bart., F.R.S.
The interest which the members of the Royal Geographical
Society appear to have at all times taken in receiving any new
and additional information regarding our Australian colonies in-
duces me to send you a brief account of the progress made by
Captain Sir Gordon Bremer, in the formation of a new establish-
ment at Port Essington, on the northern coast of Australia. It is
brief, but its brevity is owing, as he states, to the doubtful certainty
of its speedy arrival; and that a more detailed one is on its way.
The prospect held out in the Captains letter is flatteung. it
affords every reason to believe that it will be carried on success-
fully to the completion of the settlement, and that the accomplish-
ment of the national benefits, in the view of which it was under-
taken, will be fully realised. There is no fear, I trust, that it
will experience the fate of that untimely abandonment which befel
the two former infant establishments on the same coast, namely,
Melville Island and Raffles Bay; which were hastily broken up
from the dislike of the.military officers in command, with the
single exception of one (Captain Barker), and the misrepiesenta-
tions made to the Governor of Sydney. All this was fully sub-
stantiated by the reports of Captain Laws, of the Royal Navy.
The alleged causes which led to this abandonment were, Ist.
The unhealthiness of the climate. 2nd. The hostility of the
natives. 3rd. The non-visitation of the Malays. Now every one
of these allegations was proved to be utterly without foundation.
Dr. Wilson and all the medical officers agree in their testimony
to the extraordinary salubrity of the climate the natives, after
some slight encounters at first, became most pleased and friendly,
w r ere in constant communication, made themselves useful, and
deeply deplored our departure ?and, as to the non-visitation
of the Malays, Captain Laws reported to the Commander-m-
Chief of the Indian Station, that, between the 23rd of March
and the 10th of May, 1829, thirty-four prahus, manned by 1056
persons, visited the settlement of Raffles Bay; and their captains
all said that a much greater number would arrive in the course of
the next season'; expressed their great satisfaction at the prospect
of a permanent British settlement on this part of the coast, and
their gratitude for the friendly reception they had met with from
the settlers. The next season, however, presented to them
nothing but desolation.


One of the objects in fixing upon this part of the coast was to
afford to these people the advantage of trading with us for British
articles of commerce and manufacture, which they could only re-
ceive from the Dutch at extravagant prices; and they expressed
the great advantage they were likely to derive from having the
opportunity of sending direct from hence, to China, through
Singapore, their trepang (sea-slugs), which they fished for on this
coast. It is gratifying to find that Captain Bremer met with
several of these prahus, and heard of about thirty being in the
immediate neighbourhood.
Dr. Wilson says that when the establishment was broken up
the garden at Raffles Bay was in the most flourishing condition;
that it contained orange, lime, and lemon-trees, bananas in abund-
ance, shaddocks, citrons, pine-apples, figs, custard-apples, pawas,
tamarinds, dates, cocoa-nuts, arrow-root, sugar-cane, peaches, pump-
kins, sweet potatoes, turmeric, capsicums, black pepper, and many
other useful and ornamental articles; and all these within three years.
It must l)e obvious to every one that a coast so situated in rela-
tion to the Dutch Archipelago and to the shores of India ought
not to be left open to any European or Asiatic power that might
find it convenient to avail themselves of our absence, and establish
a settlement that in a little time might prove another Singapore.
Contemplating the future destiny of Australia, progressing, as it
rapidly is, in population, wealth, and strength, it is most desirable
that the whole of this great continent (for so it may be called)
should be held under one undivided power, and that Great
Britain, which first planted colonies on its shores, should be that
power; and that, to keep it in secure possession, she ought to
draw a ring-fence round its whole coast. T ~

?Port Essington, Qth February, 1839.
?On the 27th October, 1838, I reached this place, and, after
due consideration, fixed on this spot for the settlement. Our
operations commenced on the 3rd November, and have proceeded
with so much vigour that we have now a very admirable little town.
? The position is on a considerable piece of rising ground, mid-
way on the western side of the inner harbour. The soil around
is of the finest description; and we have already four wells sunk,
which afford abundance of water. A finer harbour is scarcely to
be met with in the world.
?The Alligator and Britomart lie in 18 feet at the lowest
water of spring-tides, within hail of an excellent pier, which
extends 100 feet. On Point Record and Spear Point are wells
where ships can water most expeditiously, while around our settle-
ment are large ponds and many running streams, all excellent.
? The rains have fallen but slightly this season, and our
gardens in consequence have not made that progress I had hoped


for; nevertheless, the orange, lemon, banana, plantain, and
cocoa-nut trees are in beautiful order; while the pumpkins,
melons, &c., give ample promise.
? As regards climate, I have no hesitation in expressing my
opinion that it is as fine as any tropical one in the world. We
have had very hard labour, and been constantly exposed to the
sun; occasionally the thermometer in the shade has been 98� and
J 00�; yet not one serious case of sickness has occurred. Some
disposition to scurvy in two individuals had manifested itself, but
by timely means it has been overcome. We have now a stock of
cattle for a month, and I look for a further supply on the return
of the schooner Essington from Timor, That vessel sailed in
December last for the islands to the northward, for the purpose
of opening a trade; and on board her I sent Mr. G. W. Earl,
whose interesting account of his voyage is amongst my other
reports. He found a considerable Christian population, under
the guidance of some intelligent Dutch missionaries, and has
given me so much information, and caused such a desire on my
part for more, that I purpose proceeding to Little Moa and
Kissa in the Britomart about the end of this month. My absence
will probably not exceed fourteen or sixteen days ; and on my re-
turn I hope to find the ship from India, by which I trust I shall be
able to give a further account of these highly-interesting islands.
? In concluding this brief despatch I feel that I am abun-
dantly warranted in congratulating the British government on
their having caused the occupation of this noble harbour, and on
the acquisition to the country of a colony which must answer all
the purposes contemplated lay Her Majesty?s government in its
formation; nor can I entertain a doubt but that, with the due en-
couragement it will receive from home, its admirable geographical
position will excite attention, its capabilities for mercantile pur-
poses be appreciated, and its soil, which evidently will produce
the most valuable articles, be speedily and successfully cultivated.?
[By more recent accounts from Sir G. Bremer, dated Bth of
March, we learn that he had returned from his visit to the islands,
and that the little colony was still going on favourably. The de-
spatch was accompanied by a chart of Port Essington, by
Captain Owen Stanley, R.N., drawn on the scale of two inches
to a mile, giving all the soundings, &c. : from this it appears that
the site of the new town of Victoria, on the western side of the har-
bour, is on a peninsula, about 70 feet above the water, about
miles from the head of the port or bay, which extends about 16
miles in a due north and south direction. The centre of the town
lies in 11� 20' 30" S. lat., and 132� 9' long. E. of Greenwich. Var,
2� 0' E. in 1839.]
