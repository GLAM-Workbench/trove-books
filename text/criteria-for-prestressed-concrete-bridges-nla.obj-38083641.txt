Preface
THE CRITERIA for prestressed concrete bridges presented in this pamphlet
have been developed in the hope that they may be useful until such time as
more complete specifications, covering the subject in far greater detail, may be
presented to the civil engineering profession by American specification and code
writing bodies.
The Bureau of Public Roads recognized in 1952 that the prestressed method
of concrete construction had great possibilities in the building of better and more
economical highway bridges of reinforced concrete, and that in many instances
prestressed concrete might become a competitor of structural steel also.
There were no American standard codes governing the design of prestressed
concrete bridges at that time. In recognition of the need for a guide to design
which would provide structures acceptable for Federal-aid projects, the Bureau,
in March 1952, prepared and distributed a Design Criteria for Prestressed Concrete
Bridges (Post Tensioning).
Although the scope of the criteria were very limited, the issue attracted con-
siderable attention, and many constructive comments and suggestions were
received from American and European engineers engaged in prestressed concrete
design and construction. On the basis of these comments and suggestions, a
rough draft of a new and greatly enlarged criteria, covering design, materials,
and construction, was prepared and submitted in September 1953 to a number
of authorities in the field both in this country and abroad. Thoroughly revised
in light of their comments, the criteria are now issued in this pamphlet, together
with supporting discussion and source references.
During the writing of these criteria a joint committee, composed of delegates
from the American Society of Civil Engineers and the American Concrete Insti-
tute, was set up to develop a code of practice for prestressed concrete. When
such a code is published, the Bureau?s criteria will be reviewed in the light of the
Committee?s findings.

Criteria for Prestressed Concrete Bridges
DESIGN
Temporary stresses
Temporary stresses before creep and shrinkage shall not exceed the following: 1
Concrete:
? . fpretensioned 0. 60/ d-
ecompression in extreme nber< , . . . -
[post-tensioned 0. s of' ci
0. 55 f' ci
Tension 0. 05/' ci
Prestressing steel: Tension 0. 80/',
Stress under dead, live, or impact load
Stress after creep and shrinkage under dead, live, or impact load, or any com-
bination of these forces, shall not exceed the following:
Concrete:
Compression in extreme fiber 0. 4 f' c
Tension in extreme fiber , 0
Where the computations show tension in the extreme fiber, unprestressed
reinforcement may be used, and designed to take the total tensile stresses, provided
that the computed tension in the concrete before the unprestressed steel is added
does not exceed 0.08/' O.
Prestressing steel 0. 6/' s or 0. 8/',?, whichever is less.
Creep, shrinkage, and elastic deformation
Decrease in prestress in steel due to creep, shrinkage, and elastic deformation
shall be assumed to be as follows
Pretensioned concrete 6,000+ 16/ cs +o.o4/ gi .
Post-tensioned concrete 3,000+ 11/ cs +o.o4/ st -.
In these criteria the efficiency of the anchorage has been assumed to be 100
percent. The designer should add to the figure given for creep and shrinkage an
amount sufficient to allow for the anchorage efficiency, as determined by test.
Light-weight aggregate: An amount to be determined by tests.
Decrease in prestress due to friction
Where the prestressing steel is ?draped? and wherever minor irregularities
occur in the alinement of the ducts, the stress in the interior of the beam will be
somewhat less than that at the jack, due to friction. This loss shall be estimated
and verified in the field as given in the section on construction under the heading
?Post-tensioning method (p. 5). A guide to the estimation of the loss will be
found in the discussion.
i A notation appears on page vi.


Ultimate strength
The ultimate strength must be such as to withstand the following loads without
failure:
D+ 3 (L +7) or 2(7) +L+7), whichever is greater.
In figuring the ultimate strength, use /'ï¿½ and o.B f' e (see under the heading
?Computing ultimate strength of beam?, below).
Principal tensile stress
The principal tensile stress shall not exceed the following:
Dead, live, or impact load, or any combination thereof: 0.03f' c to be carried by the
concrete and the excess over 0.03/' c to be carried by properly designed stirrups.
Ultimate loads, without stirrups: o.oB f' c . If this stress is exceeded, stirrups shall
be designed to take the total principal tensile stresses.
In the case of both working loads and ultimate loads, the maximum shears may
be taken at a point 1.5 times the depth of the beam, measured from the nearest
support.
End anchorage bearing plates for prestressing steel
Bearing plates shall be designed so that the bending stresses in the plates due
to dead, live, and impact load do not exceed that allowable for the type of steel
used, and the unit pressure on the concrete does not exceed:
3
whichever is less.
V &P
Computing ultimate strength of beam
Unless a more exact method is preferred, the following shall be used:
Where the prestressing elements are bonded to the concrete, the reinforcement
shall be assumed ?balanced? (i. e., when the steel and concrete fail simultaneously)
if:
Pl =e.23- / - C -
J 8
The ultimate moment m u shall be determined as follows:
Where p is equal or less than p h ,
m u = 0.9a s f' ,d.
Where p is greater than pi,
TYIu ? Mbs J 8
Where the prestressing elements are not bonded to the concrete, the prestressing
steel shall be considered as an external force and shall not be figured as rein-
forcement.
Stirrups
It is recommended that stirrups be used, whether or not computations show
that they are needed. The maximum stirrup spacing shall be not more than
three-fourths of the depth of the beam. The sum of the cross-sectional areas of
the legs of the stirrup should be -not less than 0.08 percent of the cross-sectional
area of the prestressed beam for the maximum spacing. Metal mesh of the
same cross-sectional area per foot of beam may be substituted for stirrups at
the option of the engineer.


Diaphragms
Diaphragm spacing shall be shown on the plans.
Size, spacing, and cover of prestressing steel
Where tension in the prestressing steel is maintained by bond and there is no
adequate end anchorage provided, 0.2 inch shall be the maximum size of wire
permitted, where the wires are used singly. Where the wires are used in seven-
wire strands, the maximum strand permitted shall be %-inch.
The minimum spacing, both vertically and horizontally, shall be three times
the diameter of the wire or strand, measured center to center. In no case, how-
ever, shall the clear spacing between wires or strands be less than times the
maximum size of the coarse aggregate.
The minimum cover distance for all prestressing steel shall be V/ 2 inches or one
diameter of bar, strand, or duct, whichever is greater.
Where adequate end anchorage is provided, the above limitations are not
applicable, except that a clear spacing horizontally of times the maximum
size of the coarse aggregate shall be maintained.
Composite construction
Where precast and cast-in-place concrete are designed to act integrally, as when
precast beams are used to support a east-in-place slab, the horizontal shear
shall be provided for by positive means, such as keys, and the two types of con-
crete held firmly together by stirrups extended up into the slab.
MATERIALS
Concrete
Any portland cement and aggregate may be used which is suitable for ordinary
concrete.
Prestressing reinforcement
Prestressing reinforcement shall be high-tensile wire, high-tensile wire strand
or rope, or high-tensile alloy bars.
Steel to be bonded to the concrete shall not be galvanized. If the steel is to
be left unbonded, it shall be protected against corrosion as described in the
section on construction under the heading "Unbonded steel? (p. 6).
If wire or strand is used, it shall have an elongation at rupture of not less than
3 percent in 10 inches. Bars, if used, shall have an elongation at rupture of not
less than 4 percent in a distance of 20 diameters.
Permissible variations in gage of wire
The dimensions of the wire, on any diameter, shall not vary more than plus or
minus 0.003 inch from the specified nominal diameter. The difference between
the maximum and minimum diameters, as measured on any given cross-section
of the wire, shall not be more than 0.003 inch.
Finish of wire
The wire shall be free from injurious defects and shall have a workmanlike
finish with smooth surface.


Testing
All wire, strand, or bars to be shipped to the site shall be assigned a lot num-
ber and tagged for identification purposes. Anchorage assemblies to be shipped
shall be likewise identified.
All samples submitted shall be representative of the lot to be furnished and,
in the case of wire or strand, shall be taken from the same master roll.
All of the materials specified for testing shall be furnished free of cost and shall
be delivered in time for tests to be made well in advance of anticipated time of
use.
Where the engineer intends to require nondestructive testing of one or more
parts of the structure, special specifications shall be drawn giving the required
details of the work.
The vendor shall furnish for testing the following samples selected from each
lot. If ordered by the engineer, the selection of samples shall be made at the
manufacturer?s plant by the inspector.
Pretensioning method. ?For pretensioned strands, samples at least 7 feet long
shall be furnished of each strand size. A sample shall be taken from each end
of every coil.
Post-tensioning method. ?The following lengths shall be furnished:
For wires requiring heading, 5 feet.
For wires not requiring heading, sufficient length to make up one parallel-lay
cable 5 feet long consisting of the same number of wires as the cable to be
furnished.
For strand to be furnished with fittings, 5 feet between near ends of fittings.
For bars to be furnished with threaded ends and nuts, 5 feet between threads
at ends.
Anchorage assemblies. ?Two anchorage assemblies shall be furnished, complete
with distribution plates of each size or type to be used, if anchorage assemblies
are not attached to reinforcement samples.
Inspection
An inspector representing the purchaser shall have free entry, at all times while
the work on the contract is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer?s
works which concern the manufacture of the materials ordered. The manufac-
turer shall afford the inspector, without charge, all reasonable facilities to satisfy
him that the material is being furnished in accordance with these criteria.
Rejection
Material which shows injurious defects during or previous to its installation in
the work shall be rejected.
CONSTRUCTION
General
Unless otherwise ordered by the engineer, the contractor shall certify to the
engineer that a technician skilled in the prestressing method used will be avail-
able to the contractor to give as much aid and instruction in the use of the pre-
stressing equipment and installation of materials as may be necessary to obtain
satisfactory results.
Hydraulic jacks shall be equipped with accurately reading calibrated pressure
gages. The contractor may elect to substitute screw jacks or other types for
hydraulic jacks. In that case, proving rings or other approved devices must be


used in connection with the jacks. All devices, whether hydraulic jack gages or
other types, shall be calibrated and, if necessary, recalibrated so as to permit the
stress in the prestressing steel to be computed at all times. A certified calibration
curve shall accompany each device.
.Safety measures must be taken by the contractor to prevent accidents due to
possible breaking of the prestressing steel or the slipping of the grips during the
prestressing process.
Concrete
All concrete shall be handled and placed in accordance with article 2.4.9 of the
American Association of State Highway Officials? Standard Specifications for
Highway Bridges (1953) (I). 2
Concrete shall not be deposited in the forms until the engineer has inspected
the placing of the reinforcement, conduits, anchorages, and prestressing steel and
has given his approval thereof.
The concrete shall be vibrated internally or externally, or both, as ordered by
the engineer. The vibrating shall be done with care and in such a manner as to
avoid displacement of reinforcing, conduits, or wires.
Steam curing of the concrete will be permitted in lieu of water curing. If the
contractor elects to cure with steam or by any other special method, the method
and its details shall meet with the approval of the engineer.
Transportation and storage
Precast girders should be transported in an upright position, and points of
support and directions of the reactions with respect to the girder should be approxi-
mately the same during transportation and storage as when the girder is in its
final position. In the event that the contractor deems it expedient to transport
or store precast girders in other than this position, it shall be done at his own risk.
Care shall be taken during storage, hoisting, and handling of the precast units
to prevent cracking or damage. Units damaged by improper storing or handling
shall be replaced by the contractor at his expense.
Pretensioning method
I he prestressing elements shall be accurately held in position and stressed by
jacks. A record shall be kept of the jacking force and the elongations produced
thereby. Several units may be cast in one continuous line and stressed at one
time. Sufficient space shall be left between ends of units to permit access for
cutting after the concrete has attained the required strength. No bond stress
shall be transferred to the concrete, nor end anchorages released, until the concrete
has attained a compressive stress, as shown by cylinder tests, of at least 3,500
p. s. i. The elements shall be cut or released in such an order that lateral eccen-
tricity of prestress will be a minimum.
Post-tensioning method
The tensioning process shall be conducted so that the tension being applied and
the elongation of the prestressing elements may be measured at all times. The
friction loss in the element, i. e., the difference between the tension at the jack and
the minimum tension, shall be determined by the formula:
F ? = 2
where
F i = total friction loss.
2 Italic numbers in parentheses refer to the list of references, p. 23.


Fi = observed tension at the jack.
a cross-sectional area of the prestressing element.
e = observed elongation of the element at the jack when the force at the
jack is Fi.
E = secant modulus of elasticity of the element for the stress Fi/a as deter-
mined from the stress-strain diagram of the element.
d = distance from the jack to the point of lowest tension in the element.
Where jacking is done from both ends of the member, the point of
minimum tension is the center of the beam; where jacking is done
from one end only, d is the length of the beam.
A record shall be kept of gage pressures and elongation at all times and submitted
to the engineer for his approval.
After tensioning, and wherever practicable, prestressing steel shall be bonded
to the concrete.
Bonded steel
All prestressing reinforcement to be bonded to the concrete shall be free of dirt,
loose rust, grease, or other deleterious substances.
Steel installed in holes or flexible metal tubes cast in the concrete preferably
shall be bonded, in which case the annular space between the perimeter of the hole
or tube and the steel shall be pressure-grouted after the prestressing process has
been completed.
The grout shall be made to the consistency of thick paint and shall be mixed
in the proportions, by volume, of 1 part portland cement to 0.75 pait (max.) of
sand passing a No. 30 sieve and 0.75 part (max.) of water. Within the limit spec-
ified, the proportions of sand and water shall be varied as required by the engineer.
It may be necessary to eliminate the sand from the mix and use neat cement grout.
If aluminum powder is used to expand the grout, it shall be added as follows.
From 2 to 4 grams of the powder (about 1 or 2 teaspoons) shall be added for each
sack of cement used in the grout. The aluminum powder shall be the unpolished
variety. The exact amount of aluminum powder shall be designated by the en-
gineer. The dosage per batch of mortar shall be carefully weighed. A number
of weighings may be made in the laboratory and the doses placed in glass vials for
convenient use in the mixing operation. The aluminum powder shall be blended
with pumicite or other inert powder in the proportion of 1 part powder to 50 parts
pumicite (or other inert powder) by weight. The blend shall be thoroughly mixed
with the cement and sand before water is added to the batch, as it has a tendency
to float in the water. The amount of the blend used should vary from 4.} i ounces
per sack of cement for concrete having a temperature of 70ï¿½ F. to 7 ounces for a
temperature of 40ï¿½ F. After all ingredients are added, the batch shall be mixed
for 3 minutes. Batches of grout shall be made small enough so that the batch
may all be used up in less than 45 minutes, as the action of the aluminum becomes
very weak after that period of time.
Except as herein provided, all grout ingredients shall comply with articles
4.1.1, 4.2.1, and 4.3.2 of the AASHO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges
(1953) (1). The final pressure placed on the grout shall be 50 to 100 p. s. i.
Unbonded steel
Where the steel is to be left unbonded to the concrete, it shall be carefully pro-
tected against corrosion by galvanizing and, in addition, a coating of tar or other
waterproof material shall be applied. If galvanizing is not practicable, another
method of protection may be approved by the engineer provided tests have
shown its suitabilitv.


Placing and fastening steel
All steel units shall be accurately placed in the position shown in the plans,
and firmly held during the placing and setting of the concrete.
Distances from the forms shall be maintained by stays, blocks, ties, hangers,
or other approved supports. Blocks for holding units from contact with the
forms shall be precast mortar blocks of approved shape and dimensions. Layers
of units shall be separated by mortar blocks or other equally suitable devices.
Wooden blocks shall not be left in the concrete.
Wires, wire groups, parallel-lay cables, and any other prestressing elements
shall be straightened to insure proper positioning in the enclosures. Suitable
horizontal and vertical spacers shall be provided, if required, to hold the wires
in place in true position in the enclosures.
Enclosures
Enclosures for prestressed reinforcement shall be accurately placed at locations
shown in the plans or approved by the engineer.
All enclosures shall be water-tight. They shall be metallic, except that the
contractor, at his option, may form the enclosures by means of cores or ducts
composed of rubber or other suitable material which shall be removed prior to
installing the prestressing reinforcement. Enclosures shall be strong enough to
maintain their shape under such forces as will come upon them. They shall be
one-fourth inch larger in internal diameter than the bar, cable, strand, or group
of wires which they enclose. Where pressure grouting is specified, cores or ducts
shall be provided with pipes or other suitable connections for the injection of grout
after the prestressing operations have been completed.
Prestressing
After the concrete has attained the required strength, the prestressing rein-
forcement shall be stressed by means of jacks to the desired tension and the stress
transferred to the end anchorage.
Tensioning of the prestressing reinforcement shall not be commenced until
tests on concrete cylinders, manufactured of the same concrete and cured under
the same conditions, indicate that the concrete of the particular member to be
prestressed has attained sufficient compressive strength.


Discussion of the Criteria for
Prestressed Concrete Bridges
DESIGN
Temporary stresses
In selecting permissible stresses to allow at the time of prestressing, it is be-
lieved that a much lower factor of safety should be used than for design loads.
In fact, the high temporary stresses imposed serve to test the member and thus
add safety to the structure. If a particular member fails during the prestressing
process due to some defect in the material or method of fabrication, it will be dis-
carded and a sound member substituted.
It should be noted that the allowable concrete stresses are based on the strength
at the time of prestressing and not the ultimate at 28 days.
There seems to be considerable difference of opinion among authorities as to
the maximum allowable stresses which may be imposed temporarily, i. e., before
creep and shrinkage takes place. For the maximum temporary concrete com-
pressive stress Hajnal-Konyi {2B) would allow 0.45f' C i, Dobell {22) prefers O.of'c,-,
whereas Holley {29) would allow 0.6f' c ; provided the stress was really temporary,
i. e., provided it was reduced to 0.4f' cf before creep and shrinkage took place.
Simpson {37) would also permit 0.6f' ci provided it was shortly reduced to 0.5f' e j.
Siess {36) certainly disapproves permitting the use of 0.6f' e i even as a temporary
stress. He gives three reasons; First, concrete strengths vary as much as 15
percent; second, the ultimate for sustained loads is perhaps only 90 percent of
that for instantaneous loads; and third, some allowance should be made for the
eccentricity of the prestress force.
Dean {2l A) points out that a higher temporary concrete stress should be
allowed for pretensioned concrete than for post-tensioned. He reasons that in
the former case the maximum compressive concrete stress under dead load alone
is always at the ends of the beam where it is comparatively harmless, whereas
in the post-tensioned beam with draped tensioning elements it is more nearly
uniform. It was therefore decided to allow a temporary stress of 0.60f' cl - for pre-
tensioned beams but only 0.55f' C j for post-tensioned.
The temporary maximum for steel was at first placed at 0.7f' s but both Muller
{S3) and Siess {36) point out that if this limit is adhered to it will be impossible
in many cases to use O.Gf's as the allowable prestress after creep and shrinkage.
What they apparently mean is that creep and shrinkage generally amount to
more than o.lf'?. On the other hand, Simpson {37) would not only limit the
temporary steel stress to 0.7f' s but would also require that it should not exceed
o.Bsf' sy . Dobell {22) recommends that f' s be defined as the manufacturer?s
guaranteed strength.


Inasmuch as o.6f'? appears to be a reasonable working value to assume for
the prestress after creep and shrinkage, it was thought best to raise the temporary
stress to o.Bof' s . It is believed that this will permit a final prestress of o.6f', to be
reached in most cases.
Stress under dead, live, or impact load
Article 3.4.11 of the AASHO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges
(1953) ( 1) for conventional concrete gives 0.4f' c as the allowable limit for dead, live,
or impact load. It seems reasonable to use the same stress in the case of pre-
stressed structures. The Connecticut State Highway Department used this
value in its specifications for the Hubbard Street Bridge (16) , although a maximum
limit is placed of 1,600 p. s. i. Dobell (22) uses the figure 0.5f' c whereas Muller
(S3) prefers 0.333f' c and Hajnal-Konyi (28) 0.45f' c . Leonhardt (31) suggests
o.4f'? for small cross sections and 0.46/' c for large ones, although he would permit
0.45f' c to be used at the top of the beam and 0.5f' c at the bottom.
Billig (5, p. 455) uses a load factor of or 0.4f' c , but he bases his factor on
the cube strength at 28 days rather than the cylinder strength. Basing this on
cylinder strength (assumed to be 20 percent less than cube strength) the working
stress becomes o.sf'?.
Under the heading Notes on Design Specifications for Prestressed Concrete the
Portland Cement Association (12, p. 19) gives the prestressed concrete design
standards of four foreign engineers. On page 15 of this reference the statement
is made that foreign practice uses working stresses in the prestressing steel 60 to
70 percent of the ultimate or 80 to 85 percent of the stress at the plastic set of
0.2 percent. The more conservative of these values (60 percent of ultimate and
80 percent of plastic stress) have been used here.
Billig (5, p. 456) uses as wmrking steel stresses for pretensioned steel 85 percent
of 0.1 percent plastic yield stress or 70 percent of ultimate tensile stress, whichever
is less. For post-tensioned steel he uses 80 percent of 0.1 percent plastic yield
stress or 65 percent of ultimate tensile stress, whichever is less.
A comparison between these values and certain stress standards used in this
country may be of interest.
The Prestressed Concrete Corporation (35) (headed wire system) uses steel
with an ultimate of 210,000 to 225,000 p. s. i. and a minimum yield point (0.2
percent plastic set) of 180,000 to 195,000 p. s. i. They apparently use a working
stress of 145,000 p. s. i., which is 64 to 69 percent of the ultimate and 74 to 80
percent of the yield point.
The Preload Company (25) (Lee-McCall system) uses steel of 145,000 p. s. i.
ultimate strength and 130,000 p. s. i. yield strength (at 0.2 percent plastic set);
and for working stresses they suggest 0.70 times the minimum ultimate strength
or 0.80 times the 0.2-percent offset yield point stress, whichever is lower.
Muller (33) would require an ultimate tensile strength of the steel of 200,000
p, s. i. and a 0.2-percent offset yield strength of at least 70 percent, He would
then permit a working stress 0.6 the ultimate.
The Massachusetts Department of Public Works (17) uses galvanized wire
of 220,000 p. s. i. minimum ultimate strength and yield strength of 160,000
p. s. i. at 0.7-percent extension. The specification requires that the strand be
stretched to 50 percent of the ultimate in the shop but does not give the working
stress.
There seems to be considerable difference of opinion as to how much tension
to allow in the extreme fiber under dead, live, and impact load. Capouch (20)
would allow O.OOf'cc for members having no mild steel reinforcement in the
tensile zone and 0.12f' cc for members having such reinforcement. If, by f' cc ,
Capouch refers to the ultimate 28-day cylinder strength of the concrete, then his
allowances are greater than those of Leonhardt (31), who recommends o.oBf' c

in the bottom under dead, live, and impact load and zero tension under dead
load and 0.6 (live and impact load); Garrett {26), who would allow 0.04f' c tension
in the top only; and Dobell {22), allowing 0.025f' e in the bottom of the beam and
o.osf' c in the top. Eney {2Jf) would allow no tension whatever in the concrete.
Considering all these points of view, it was decided to assume the concrete not
capable of taking tension under dead, live, and impact load. If the design is so
made that tension exists in the extreme fiber, the tension must be borne by steel
reinforcing in the conventional way. It is often argued that cracks that open up
during the imposition of the live load cpiickly close after the load has passed and
so it is perfectly safe to permit tension under these circumstances.
After due consideration, it was decided to reserve this unique property of
prestressed concrete for the overloaded condition rather than that of the design
load. This also is the position taken by the Connecticut State Highway Depart-
ment in designing the Hubbard Street Bridge {l6) and by the Freyssinet Company
{32).
Cracking loads
Criteria for cracking loads have purposely been omitted. For block construc-
tion it is obvious that the computations for cracking loads are largely meaningless.
Tests show that cracks occur considerably below the tensile strength of the con-
crete because the blocks are cemented together with mortar rather than being
cast monolithieally {3). If block beams may be accepted where the cracking
load is very low, in competition with monolithic beams, monolithic beams cannot
be required to meet a cracking standard.
Fornerod {25) believes that a block beam should be assumed to be cracked when
computations show any tension whatever in the extreme fiber, whereas 0.15/' e
should be allowed as the modulus of rupture for monolithic construction.
Hajnal-Konyi {2B) points out that a high factor of safety against cracking and
a high resistance to shock are contradicting requirements.
Considering all these points of view, and bearing in mind that certain authorities
would permit tension under working loads, it seems best to omit all reference to
cracking loads. This is also the opinion of Leonhardt {3l).
Minimum permissible strengths
It is customary for designers of prestressed concrete (e.g., 16) to specify the
minimum concrete and steel strengths {f' c and/' s ) which may be used on the proj-
ect. These data should be shown on the plans. On the other hand, there appears
to be no good reason, other than economy of cost, why such a provision should
be used in a general specification for prestressed concrete. In case weak concrete
or low-strength steel is used, the general specifications should be so worded as to
prevent the application of dangerous stresses either at the time of prestressing or
upon the application of the specified live loads. If such limits are adhered to,
it will be found, in most cases, that the resulting design will be uneconomical.
On the other hand, it is conceivable that, under certain circumstances, such a
design could be justified. This opinion is held by Dobell {22), and by Hajnal-
Konyi {2B) except for pretensioned concrete. His exception is probably due to
the need of sufficient bond strength to hold the tension in the wires. It was
decided, therefore, to specify a minimum for this case only.
Two authorities differ from this position. Both Muller {33) and Leonhardt {3l)
advocate placing a lower limit on the concrete strength. The first suggests a
5,000 p. s. i. minimum whereas the latter prefers 4,000 p. s. i.
Creep, shrinkage, and elastic deformation
When concrete is prestressed, a gradual relaxation of stress takes place both
in the steel and in the concrete. If creep is defined as the ?inelastic deformation
of concrete or steel, dependent on time and resulting solely from the presence


of stress and a function thereof? and shrinkage as the ?contraction of concrete
due to drying and chemical changes, dependent on time but not on stresses
induced by external loading? {2), then this relaxation may be divided into four
causes, which are evaluated as follows:
(a) Shrinkage of concrete; The shrinkage will be assumed as 0.0002
inch per inch, causing a relaxation in the steel of 0.0002S 5 =0.0002 X
28,000,000 = 5,600 p. s. i. or, rounded out, 6,000 p. s. i. In the case of
pretensioned concrete this should be the allowance for shrinkage. For
post-tensioned structures it is assumed that one-half the shrinkage has
occurred before prestressing is begun and, therefore, for this case only
3,000 p. s. i. is allowed for.
(b) Elastic compression of concrete: Let f ca ? concrete stress at the
centroid of the prestressing steel. The effect of this compression on the
relaxation of the steel will then be ( EJE c )f ca . If it is assumed that
E s =2S, ooo.ooo and E c =5,000,000, then the elastic compression = 5.6/ c,
or, rounded out, 5 f cs .
(c) Creep of concrete: This may be taken at 2.25 times the elastic com-
pression {3l). Therefore, the creep of concrete = 2.25X5/ cs = 11.25/ cs
or, rounded out, 11/ cs .
(d) Creep of steel; / 31 = the stress in the steel immediately after pre-
stressing. Assuming creep = 4 percent (from 10, p. 30), then the creep
of steel=o.o4/?-.
Pretensioned concrete. ?The total losses, resulting from all four of the above
causes, will be, in pounds per square inch:
(a) + (b) + (c) + (d) = 6,000+ 16/ ca +o.o4/ si .
Post-tensioned concrete? The total losses, resulting from the first, third, and
fourth of the above causes, will be, in pounds per square inch:
(a) + (c) + (d) = 3.000 +ll f cs + 0.04/, f .
Light-weight aggregate. ?The Portland Cement Association states {l2, p. 16):
It may be desirable to include the use of light-weight concrete in
specifications for prestressing. It is generally characteristic of light-
weight concrete that it has more creep, shrinkage, and elastic strain
compared with ordinary concrete. The losses in prestress from these
sources will consequently be greater. Light-weight concrete may also
have less ultimate strength and more deflection compared with ordinary
concrete. If all these characteristics can be taken care of in the design,
resulting in a safe economical structure, there is no reason why light-
weight concrete should not be considered for prestressed construction.
It was at first proposed to increase the allowance for creep and shrinkage by
50 percent when light-weight aggregate is used, but this was objected to by Simpson
{37) , who claims to know of cases where the increase of 50 percent would be quite
insufficient. It therefore seems best to require tests to be made in each individual
Decrease in prestress due to friction
The chart on page 10, obtained through the courtesy of the Freyssinet Company
of New York, N. Y., may help the designer to estimate the probable loss in pre-
stress due to friction in the enclosure. (The chart has been modified by the
substitution of a graph for a table for use in determining fa.) The losses are
assumed to be due to two causes;


The ?draping? of the steel. ?Draping causes the steel to impinge or rub against
the inside curvature of the enclosure during rhe prestressing process. The loss is
a function of the central angle of curvature and the coefficient of friction between
the walls of the enclosure and the steel.
Small deviations, either horizontal or vertical, of the enclosure. ?The process of
concreting a post-tensioned beam is apt to displace the enclosure embedded in it.
The displacement cannot easily be determined after the concrete is poured, but
field experience shows that the lack of true alinement causes appreciable friction
losses during the prestressing process. These losses are a function of the coefficient
of friction and the extent and number of deviations from a true alinement.
Coefficients are assumed for both of the above cases, after which the loss of
prestress may be estimated from the chart or obtained from the formula:
T o = T x e (Kx+fa)
where
T o =stress at the prestressing jack (p. s. i.).
T' x =stress at a point x feet from the jack (p. s. i.).
K =enclosure coefficient, which may vary anywhere from 1/200 to 1/1,500.
The following values of K are suggested:
Preformed holes where the concrete comes in direct
contact with the prestressing steel K= 1/1,000
Galvanized metal enclosure K? l/1,000
Ungalvanized metal enclosure K~ 1/500
/= coefficient of friction between the prestressing steel and the walls of the
enclosure, for which the following values may be used:
Preformed holes f=0.50
Galvanized enclosure /=0.20
Ungalvanized enclosure /=0.30
a = angle between the element at the jack and the element at the given point,
in radians.
x = length of the element between the jack and the given point. For the
center line, x = l/ 2, where I= length of beam (ft).
e = base of Naperian logarithms.
For a further discussion of this subject, see the section on construction, under
the heading ?Post-tensioning method? (p. 20)
Ultimate strength
It was at first proposed that the ultimate strength be at least 7)-f3.5 (L-\-I)
or 2.25 (D-\-L-\-I), whichever is greater, but these values appeared to Muller {33),
Preston (34), and Leonhardt (31) as being too conservative.
It is the opinion of three authorities that a difference should be made between
the ultimate load specified for under-reinforced and that for over-reinforced
beams and slabs. It is well known that under-reinforced prestressed members
tend to give plenty of warning of complete failure by excessive distortion whereas
for over-reinforced members the failure is apt to take place suddenly. Hajnal-
Konyi (28) suggests that the under-reinforced members should be designed to
withstand 1.5 dead loads + 2.5 live loads at ultimate stresses whereas over-
reinforced beams should be made to take 2 dead loads + 3 live loads. Dobell (22)
suggests using for under-reinforced beams 1 D + 3 (L +7) or 2(7) +L + 7), whichever
is greater; and for over-reinforced beams 17)+ 3.5(7/ +7) or 2.25(7) + L-l-7).
Leonhardt (31) allows for the difference in safety factors by requiring the member
to withstand 1.57)-|-27, in both cases, but, in conjunction with this, using the
compressive strength of the concrete as 0.8 of the ultimate (o.Bf' c ). If, then, the


concrete governs the strength of the member (the case of over-reinforcement),
the effect of using o.Bf' c is to provide for
I ? s ï¿½nit 2L==l - SSD + 2 ? 5L
0.0
whereas if the steel governs (the case of under-reinforcement) only 1.5 D +2L is
provided for. Although not definitely stated, a difference of safety factors is
also indicated by Fornerod {25).
It was decided to use Dobell?s suggestion as regards under-reinforced beams;
and to provide for the higher factor of safety for over-reinforced beams by using
o.B f' c instead of I.of' e , as suggested by Leonhardt.
The previous edition of these Bureau of Public Roads criteria permitted the
distribution of ultimate live load over the whole width of the bridge. That feature
has been omitted here in the interest of simplicity and consistency.
Holley {29) raises the question as to whether the bond will hold when the loads
approach the ultimate. It is true that these criteria do not specify the bond
strength of the grout. Also, it is not known whether or not the ducts will slip in
the beam even though the grout holds.
Principal tensile stress
Here again there is considerable difference of opinion among authorities.
Muller {33) suggests 0.04/' c for the temporary stress during prestressing and
0.02/' e for working loads; in case these values are exceeded, stirrups are to be
designed to take the full shear (probably he means by shear the full principal
tensile stresses). Hajnal-Konyi {2B) bases the criterion on the ultimate loads;
thus, if the ultimate principal stress exceeds 0.5 modulus of rupture, stirrups should
be used to take the full shear. Leonhardt {3l) would allow 0.015/ L for working
loads where stirrups are not used and 0.04/' c where they are used. In the latter
case the stirrups should be designed to take the full tensile stress.
The ultimate principal tensile stress was fixed at 0.08/' c , but serious objections
were raised. Muller {33), Garrett {26), and Leonhardt {3l) believe that 0.08/' c
is much too low compared with? 0.04/' e for working stresses. Hajnal-Konyi {2B),
Dobell {22), Siess {36), and Holley {29) all emphasize the fact that the principal
tensile stress at ultimate load is largely meaningless, but Muller pointed out that
some maximum value must be set to insure that the beam will not fail in shear.
Hence the value 0.08/' c was retained.
End anchorage bearing plates for prestressing steel
According to Komendant {3O), formula 182 in his book Prestressed Concrete
Structures {lO, p. 173) is based on tests and is empirical only. This formula states
that the ultimate pressure under the plate is proportional to the square root of the
ratio of beam-end area to bearing-plate area. Tests have demonstrated, he says,
that the stress under the plate can be many times higher than the crushing
strength. He also infers that the cube root of this ratio is also used by some
designers (see, for example, 5, p. 286, formula 49). In addition, Komendant notes
that the difference between the square-root and cube-root factors lies in the
interpretation of stress distribution in concrete, factor of safety, etc.
It was decided to adopt the more conservative of these values, i. e., to use the
cube-root factor. On the other hand, it is proposed to place f' c as the maximum
permissible limit of stress under the plate. Komendant {3O) apparently recom-
mends the use of a working stress 50 to 80 percent of the ultimate under the plate,
whether that ultimate is figured by the cube-root or square-root formula. Billig
(5, p. 286) uses the cube-root formula without any safety factor, or one-half the
ultimate, whichever value is less. If this ultimate means f' c the formula only


f c k\bkd=f s a s _ _ _ _ .
(1)
where f c k\ is the average unit compressive stress.
From equation (1):
a s ??-k i bkd
(2)
allows 25 percent more stress under the plate than is allowed elsewhere in com-
pression :
0.5/.-0.4/. = 0. 25/ ,
The formula given in the criteria specifies that the stress under the plate shall
not exceed/' c which, in view of Komendant?s {3O) statement that the stress under
the plate can be many times higher than the crushing stress, does not seem
excessive.
Computing ultimate strength of beam
Various methods have been suggested for figuring the ultimate strength of pre-
stressed structures. Billig, in his book Prestressed Concrete {5, pp. 260-279),
suggests one of his own and then outlines six other methods.
The method used in these criteria is believed to give accurate enough results in
most cases and to have the advantage of being easy to apply. It is based on the
following assumptions:
Ultimate strain in the concrete {9, p. 14) e' c =o. 0016
Ultimate strain in high-strength steel {27) e' 8 =O. 0105
Strain in steel after creep and shrinkage but before live load {27) _ .e p =O. 005
Additional strain in steel due to sufficient live load to cause the
compression in the concrete in the vicinity of the steel to reduce
to zero e' v ?O. 0002
Concrete compression block at instant of failure is assumed rectangular rather
than triangular.
A balanced section is assumed to be one in which the steel and concrete fail
simultaneously under ultimate load.
Beams are said to be under-reinforced when they have less steel than would be
required for a balanced section. They are assumed to fail by the stretching
or fracture of the steel. This, in turn, causes the concrete to crush. The
failure is generally preceded by serious deflections and distortions, which
give plenty of warning.
Over-reinforced beams fail by crushing of the concrete in the compression
zone. The beam generally collapses suddenly. An additional safety factor
is provided in this case by using o.B f' c instead of f c in the computations.
For any loading, the compressive forces equal the tensile forces:
Also, the strains are proportional to the distance of the element from the
neutral axis;

Where the assumed ultimate strength is reached in both the steel and concrete:

Since ki=l, for a rectangular compression block we have, from equation (2):
n oq ï¿½- 8 /'o

7 s
The ultimate bending moment for a balanced section is;
m u = a bs f' s d (1 k 2 k)
where k 2 kd is the distance of the centroid of compression from the compression
face. For a rectangular compression block k 2 = 0.5 and, approximately:
m u = 0.9 a bs f' s d.
It should be noted that bis the width of section, assuming it rectangular. For
any section other than rectangular, b is the average width of the compression
block. In other words, b is the width of an equivalent rectangle having the
same area and height as the compression block. Where a s is less than a bs :
m u = o.9 a s f' s d (approximately).
If a s is greater than a bs , the increase in a s is partly compensated for by the decrease
in f's and (1 k 2 k). By trial it is found that the ultimate moment is approxi-
mately :
m u = o.9^ab s a s f' s d.
Stirrups
Where shear exceeds the shearing strength of a beam, cracks will occur. In an
unprestressed concrete beam these cracks are most likely to occur near the re-
actions and at an angle of 45ï¿½ to the horizontal, because the shear is generally
greater near the ends of the beam and because the average intensity of diagonal
tension is maximum at this angle. It must be borne in mind, however, that
neither of these statements apply to prestressed concrete. First, the shear cracks
tend to occur, according to Abeles (19), nearer the points of maximum moment
because it is in this vicinity that the concrete is most weakened by moment cracks.
Second, the angle which the crack makes with the horizontal tends to be much
less than 45ï¿½ because the prestress resists cracking increasingly as the plane ap-
proaches the vertical. It follows, therefore, that stirrups in prestressed beams
may be placed wider apart than for nonprestressed beams because the maximum
plane of rupture is flatter and engages more stirrups. In many prestressed designs
the stirrups are entirely omitted because the prestress reduces the intensity of
diagonal tension. On the other hand, while often not needed to resist diagonal
tension, stirrups are still beneficial in holding a beam together near the ultimate
load. These criteria recommend but do not require the use of stirrups, but it
should be noted that when used they should be placed in the vicinity of maximum
moment as well as that of maximum shear, i. e., all along the beam.
Diaphragms
Corning (21) selected tentatively 17 feet or 18 feet as a suitable distance be-
tween diaphragms. Dobell (22) believes that no diaphragm spacing limits
should be imposed, and he points out that the Neckar Canal highway bridge
designed by Leonhardt has diaphragms spaced 30 feet on centers. Five Freyssinet


bridges have diaphragms spaced 20 feet to 50 feet. A bridge designed by Magnet
has diaphragms spaced 65 feet on centers. Diaphragms generally improve the
design and, at times, are necessary, but the spacing of the diaphragms should be
given on the plans and not in the specifications.
Size, spacing, and cover of prestressing steel
Requirements for size, spacing, and cover of prestressing steel appear to be
somewhat controversial.
Where dependence is placed entirely on bond, the size of the prestressing element
must be limited. Muller (33) would permit %-inch diameter strands or perhaps
diameter, and Capouch {2O) and Preston (34) think that %-inch diameter
strands would not be too large. Garrett (26) believes that limiting the size of
wire to 0.2-inch diameter is certainly very conservative. Eney (24) would limit
the size of wire to 0.2 inch. It may be noted that the American Railway Engi-
neering Association is testing wire strands up to diameter.
It was decided to restrict the maximum wire size to 0.2 inch (5 mm.) and the
maximum seven-wire strand to % inch (4, pp. 221, 223; 5, p. 446).
The minimum spacing of wires is taken to be about the same as for ordinary
reinforced concrete (i. e., 3d). A seven-wire strand is equivalent in area to a
single wire dyj 7 in diameter; hence, the center-to-center distance should be
3dV7 = Bdï¿½.
Preston (34) has an interesting way of spacing his prestressing elements. He
draws a square around the element of such size that the area of the square multi-
plied by the ultimate concrete stress equals the stress in the strand. Then he
stipulates that these squares must not overlap.
As regards cover, Dobell (22) and Leonhardt (31) would require at least 1 inch
or half the diameter of the duct, whichever is greater. Muller (33) would delete
all reference to the size of duct and make the minimum cover 1 to H/i inches.
Billig ( 5 , p. 453) specifies inch or one diameter, whichever is greater, as the min-
imum clear cover distance for prestressing members. It is believed, however,
that these latter values are much too small. Certainly the prestressing steel
should be embedded at least as much as for ordinary reinforced concrete. A
minimum clear embedment of l}i inches or one diameter appears to be more
reasonable.
The limitation of spacing as regards the coarse aggregate is taken from that
given in section 3.7.7.(a) of the AASHO Standard Specifications for Highway
Bridges (1953) ( 1).
Composite construction
Billig (5, p. 451) suggests roughening the surface between precast and cast-in-
place concrete and the use of stirrups.
MATERIALS
Prestressing reinforcement
In writing specifications for prestressing steel it is often customary to express
the ductility required in terms of elongation in 10 inches at ultimate stress. It
is certainly true that a ductile steel is less apt to sudden failure during the pre-
stressing process or when subjected to heavy live loads. On the other hand, it
appears that the higher the strength of the steel the more difficult it is to obtain
ductility.
The Oregon State Highway Department (18), for a steel of 240,000 p. s. i.
minimum strength, specifies an elongation of 2 percent in 10 inches; so does the


Freyssinet Company ( 33 ), with the stipulation that the elongation must be
measured outside the contraction both sides of the failure. Fornerod (25) suggests
an elongation of 4 percent in 10 inches for 220,000 p. s. i. wire and 8 percent in 8
inches for 145,000 p. s. i. bars. Williams (38) believes that 4 percent for wire
would be a good average figure to specify.
A somewhat greater elongation can be required for bars, as the ultimate stress
is lower. The Mac Alloy bars used by the Preload Company (25) will show an
elongation of s}i percent in 10 inches.
The following references are also of interest. Dobell (22) suggests specifying
25-percent reduction in area rather than the amount of elongation. Siess (86)
would not permit the use of alloy bars. Simpson (37) believes that the specifying
of 4-percent elongation for wire and 6-percent for bars would be much too high
and would debar good steels from being used. He recommends 3 percent for wire
and 4 percent in 20 diameters for bars.
After considering all these suggestions it was decided to adopt Simpson?s advice.
Testing
The requirements for testing are modifications of similar clauses in the California
Department of Public Works specifications (15).
CONSTRUCTION
General
Skilled technician. ?The clause requiring the contractor to have a technician in
the prestressing method used on the job comes from a Bureau specification (14)-
Safety measures. ?The material on safety was written largely from Billig?s book
Prestressed Concrete (5, p. 447).
Concrete
Vibration of concrete. ?There seems to be no objection among authorities to the
vibration of concrete after pouring. Certain specifications, viz., the Prestressed
Concrete Corporation (35) and the State highway departments of Connecticut
(16), California (15), and Massachusetts (17), insist upon it. But there is some
difference of opinion as to whether internal or external vibration should be used.
Connecticut prefers external except for slabs, California internal, and Massa-
chusetts apparently has no preference. Article 2.4.9 of the AASHO Standard
Specifications for Highway Bridges (1953) (1) requires internal vibration unless
special authorization of other methods is given by the engineer. Lewis (32) finds
that internal vibration is often difficult with prestressed concrete because of the
small spaces in which to work. He would require both internal and external
vibration except where conditions dictate otherwise.
Inasmuch as the question of the best method of vibrating depends to a large
extent on the shape, size, and clearances of the members to be vibrated, it was
thought best to permit the engineer to decide which to use.
Curing of concrete. ?Steam curing of concrete has become quite common because
it permits the early removal of forms. At least one other method has been devised
which accomplishes the same thing: The concrete is mixed considerably wetter
than with other methods and then, after depositing in the forms, the excess water
is removed by applying a partial vacuum to the surface of the concrete.
Air entrainment. ?It was thought best not to require air entrainment. Some
designers believe that it limits the shrinkage to some extent. The State highway
departments of Connecticut (16) and Massachusetts (17) both specify air entrain-
ment for prestressed concrete. On the other hand, tests made a year or so ago by
the Iron and Steel Institute (13, p. 106) do not substantiate this claim. Over a


period of years the air-entrained beams showed almost exactly the same
shrinkage as those containing no air-entraining material. Although the cement
content and slump were almost exactly the same, the strength of the air-entrained
specimens was about 20 percent less than those having no air entrainment.
Transportation and storage
Normally, prestressed beams not cast in place should be transported in such a
manner that the points of support and direction of reactions during transportation
are about the same as the beam will have in its final position. However, it was
pointed out by Muller ( 33 ), Hajnal-Konyi (88), Dobell (22), and Komendant (SO)
that it is often practical and expedient to transport in some other way. If the
contractor elects to support the beam during transportation in a way other than
that used in its final position, special precautions should be taken to avoid injury
to the beam and the contractor should be held liable in case such injury occurs.
Overstretching
It has been customary on certain prestressed concrete jobs to overstretch the
prestressing steel for a few minutes in order to decrease the creep after the steel
is finally anchored. However, the practice seems to be losing favor.
Muller (33) believes that the practice is not necessary for parallel-wire cables.
Siess (36) claims that overstretching does little good. Garrett (26) and Capouch
(20) disapprove of including a paragraph on overstretching in the specifications.
Leonhardt (31) believes that overstretching is not necessary except for certain
steels and wire ropes.
It was decided, therefore, not to insist on overstretching, although under certain
circumstances it may be advisable.
Pretensioning method
Muller (33) thinks that the minimum initial prestress should be 4,000 p. s. i.
whereas Preston (34) and Capouch (20) want the minimum strength of concrete
dependent on the size of the strand, the former believing that 3,000 p. s. i. concrete
is all right for strands not over However, inasmuch as the relation be-
tween size of strand, bond strength, and concrete compressive strength is not
thoroughly understood, it was thought best to increase the minimum concrete
strength to 3,500 p. s. i., irrespective of the size of strand. Notice that this stress
applies at the time of transfer of the bond and not at 28 days.
Post-tensioning method
If, during the tensioning process, a considerable amount of friction exists be-
tween wire, cable, or bar and the duct in which it is enclosed, the resulting tension
at the ends of the member will be much greater than that at the center. But, in
general, it is at the center of the beam where the most tension is needed. Where
any considerable friction is evident during the tensioning process it should be
either eliminated, allowed for in the design, or the beam rejected (17).
The allowance for friction when making the design is especially emphasized by
Muller (33), Hajnal-Konyi (28), and Dobell (22). Both Leonhardt (31) and
Dobell (22) believe that, if the stress-strain curve is used instead of a general
value for the modulus of elasticity, the computations based thereon should check
the field measurements within 5 percent. It should be noted, however, that a
small tension must be placed on the pretensioning elements prior to measuring
the elongation in order to take up the slack. Garrett (26) suggests that 400
p. s. i. tension is sufficient for this purpose.
Bonded steel
Requirement of bonding. ?It will be noted that these criteria require bonding of
steel to the concrete ?wherever practicable.?


Tests and theory both indicate that bonded prestressing steel produces a
stronger beam than unbonded steel (#3). The reason seems to be that at ultimate
loads the unbonded steel is stressed only a small amount above that produced by
the jacks at the time it is prestressed ( 8 , p. 15) whereas the bonded steel runs up
to the ultimate before failure (7, fig. 6, p. 192). Rather than prohibit the use of
unbonded steel, it seemed best to provide for the difference of strength by the
methods of computation. Both the Massachusetts Department of Public Works
(17) and the Prestressed Concrete Corporation (35) use unbonded steel. German
specifications published in 1950 also permit unbonded steel but they ?handicap?
the unbonded design in much the same way as proposed here (23) .
There seems to be considerable difference of opinion on this subject. Siess
and Appleton (36) believe that bonding of the steel to the concrete should be
mandatory unless tests prove otherwise. On the other hand, Preston (34) is not
at all sure that bonding is needed, Dobell (22) and Garrett (26) disapprove of
showing any preference in the specifications for bonded prestressing steel, and
Simpson (37) would approve unbonded steel under certain circumstances.
Grout. ?As to pressure grouting, Dobell (22) believes that it should not be re-
quired. He says the Sclayn bridge would not pass this requirement. As to grout
mix and consistency, the Connecticut State Highway Department (16) uses 1.3
parts Portland cement, 1 part fine sand, surface dry, and 1 part water, by volume.
If the volume of the cement is taken as unity, these ratios become, approximately,
Portland cement 1 part, surface-dry sand 0.75 part, and water 0.75 part ?the
proportions suggested in these criteria. Connecticut gives the pressure required
in the grouting process to be 80 to 100 p. s. i.
Muller (33) seems to be in accord with the proportions mentioned above except
that he wants it made clear that neat cement grout may, in some cases, be the
best. This has been emphasized in the criteria.
The California Department of Public Works (15) uses a 1-to-l mix for the grout
and does not specify the water content. Inasmuch as most modern authorities
claim that the strength of mortar and concrete depend very largely on the water-
cement ratio, it is believed to be essential that the water content of the mortar
should be specified.
The Oregon State Highway Department (18) specifies 1.3 parts Portland ce-
ment, 0.7 part sand passing No. 40 sieve, and 1.0 part water.
Leonhardt (31) points out the importance of water in specifying grout. Of
course, it is also necessary to have the grout fluid enough to penetrate all the voids
as intended. In case the required fluidity is not attained by adhering to the
given proportions of cement, sand, and water, the quantity of sand should be re-
duced. Also, if a ?thick-paint? consistency can be secured by using a little less
water, so much the better. For these reasons it was thought best to specify the
maximum proportion of sand and water rather than their definite values. Another
element tending to prevent the damming up of the grout during its passage
through the ducts is the fineness of the sand. The Connecticut State Highway
Department (16) requires that the sand grain be not over %4-inch. On the
Tampa Bay Bridge }i part fly ash and % part screened and washed beach sand was
specified (6) as the fine aggregate for the grout. The final pressure on the grout
was 35 p. s. i.
It was decided to require that all sand pass a No. 30 sieve. While this permits
a sand somewhat coarser than that specified by Oregon, it is believed that the
No. 30 sieve would be somewhat easier to obtain (being one of those used for the
fineness-modulus test of sand) and at the same time give a sand fine enough under
the circumstances. The largest sand grain passing a No. 30 sieve is about }ï¿½o-inch
diameter.
The admixture of aluminum powder to grout in very small proportions has
been found to produce minute bubbles of hydrogen which cause the grout to


swell and fill the voids more completely. Where the grout is confined, the addi-
tion of aluminum affects the strength but little {11). While not required by these
criteria, the use of aluminum is permitted. The method of mixing is taken from
a Bureau specification (14)-
Unbonded steel
There seems to be little objection to the galvanizing of unbonded steel except
that, as pointed out by Dobell {22). steel bars cannot easily be galvanized. Simp-
son {37) also notes that substitutes for galvanizing should be permitted. Dobell
{22) suggests }lj2-inch coating of tar where galvanizing is not practicable and
Capouch {2O) would dispense with the tar coating wherever galvanizing is prac-
ticable. Note that the criteria as now written require, where practicable, both
galvanizing and tar coating.
Placing and fastening steel
The clauses on placing and fastening steel were taken almost without change
from the California Department of Public Works specifications {l5).
Enclosures; Prestressing
*
The clauses on enclosures and on prestressing are modifications of similar
clauses in the California Department of Public Works specifications {l6).
Muller {33), Dobell {22), and Leonhardt {3l) all agree that }4-inch clearance
between the size of the prestressing element and the duct containing it is about
right. Eney {24) and Lewis {32) are both opposed to the requirement that all
ducts shall be metallic.
