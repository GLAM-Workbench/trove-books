PREFACE-
As the present is the first work of its kind yet compiled, the publisher
is of opinion that a few introductory remarks by way of preface would
not be out of place. The preparation of a directory is at all times
a task involving considerable labour and attention ; and especially is
the undertaking an arduous one when entered upon in regard to any
city, for the first time. Notwithstanding the many difficulties I had to
contend against, I have striven to make the “ Goulburn and District
Directory” a complete and useful manual. The want of some such
guide as that now presented to the public of these parts has been long
felt. Inasmuch as I have endeavoured to supply this want, I hope my
efforts will meet with approval, and that all may have an opportunity of
securing a copy. The work is published in a cheap and useful form. The
reader will find embodied in this handbook a quantity of local information
relative to the public institutions of Goulburn ; also valuable particulars
connected with the several religious denominations, schools and
societies, as well as the names and addresses of the residents in the
city and districts. All possible care has been taken in order that
nothing but what is accurate should appear, and to secure this object
competent and reliable authorities have been consulted throughout.
However, should there be errors detected in the following pages, the
publisher hopes to have that consideration extended to him, which is
due to the first issue of a directory in this city. In conclusion I beg to
thank the advertisers for their very liberal support and encouragement.
At the same time I may mention that it is my intention to annually
publish a work somewhat similar to the present, to be entitled “ The
Goulburn Almanac and Directory,” which will be more complete and
comprehensive in point of local and general information than that now
offered.

INTRODUCTION.
The Goulburn District is one of the oldest and most extensively settled district
in New South Wales. It comprises the whole of the County of Argyle, and part
of Westmorland and Georgiana. The area of Argyle is 1,249,480 acres. The
agricultural resources of the district are large and varied. As a rule the soil is
rich and deep, and the climate is well adapted for the growth of English cereals
and fruit. The principal crops are wheat, oats, maize, barley, potatoes, and sown
grasses. There are some large orchards which grow in quantities apples, pears,
gooseberries, cherries, grapes, peaches, plums, apricots, walnuts, almonds, figs,
quinces. There are jam manufactories in Goulburn, which are rapidly extending
their operations, and produce a really good article. The mineral resources of the
district are not yet thoroughly known, and have not yet been subjected to syste-
matic investigation. Gold has been obtained with varying success since the year
1852. Copper, tin, galena, plumbago, and antimony have also been found in the
district. Limestone abounds. At Marulan there is a marble quarry, the marble
from which has been used for the floors of several of the Sydney public buildings.
The manufactories, machines, and works in the district number some 300, which
comprise several agricultural implement manufactories, a soap and candle manu-
factory, tanneries, fell/nongery, brewery, confectionery works, jam manufactories,
copper smelting works, iron, copper, and brass foundries, boot factories, &c.
Goulburn.—The city of Goulburn is situated on a plain, surrounded bv
hills, in the County of Argyle, and police district of Goulburn (34 degrees,
45 minutes, 8 seconds South, latitude ; 149 degrees, 44 minutes, 48 seconds East,
longitude). It is 134 miles from Sydney by the Great Southern Line, on which it
is the most important station out of the metropolis. Goulburn is the seat of an
Anglican and Roman Catholic bishopric. The city is well laid out, and was pro-
claimed a municipality in June, 1859. The streets are broad, and well laid out,
and cross each other at right angles. The city has been lighted with gas since
November, 1879. Fine buildings are numerous, and of a substantial character,
chief among which is the Anglican Cathedral, which will soon be finished far
enough to conduct Divine worship within the building. Many of the public
buildings will compare favourably with those of Sydney ; the more important
edifices, as is usually the case, being those of the various places of worship. The
Anglican, Wesleyan, Presbyterian, Primitive Methodist, Baptist, and Roman
Catholic denominations have churches and chapels throughout the city. There are
five banks—the Commercial Bank of Sydney, Bank of JNew South Wales, a,nd
Australian Joint Stock Bank are among the finest buildings in Goulburn. Ihe
Oriental Bank, and the English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Banks are
also represented in the city of the South. The principal insurance companies
have agencies in Goulburn. The leading hotels are Dickson s, the Royal,
Imperial, and Thomas’s Family Hotel. Prominent among the public edifices
stands the new post and telegraph offices, the mechanics’ institute, public, and
other schools, Anglican Cathedral, courthouse, convent, two Anglican churches,
Roman Catholic churches, Wesleyan, Presbyterian, Primitive Methodist, and Baptist
churches. The Goulburn Press is well represented by three local newspapers —
the Southern Argus, Goulburn Evening Penny Post, and the Goulburn Herald, all
published three times a week. There are several factories and large industries
carried on in the city, including the Argyle flour mills, the City flour mills, and

member to Parliament. According to the last census taken in April, 1881, the
population was 6,839 ; but this cannot be taken as a criterion of population now,
as since that date the influx of inhabitants has been very large, and the sub-
stantial prosperity of Goulburn has been vindicated by the large number of
buildings in course of erection in all parts of the city, as well as the numerous
industries and businesses that have lately been established in Goulburn, all speak
in unmistakeable terms of its prosperity. The city is 2071 feet above the level of
the sea, which gives it a temperate and delightful climate in all seasons of the
year. The district around Goulburn is mainly agricultural. The Assize Courts
are held twice a year, and are presided over by the Supreme Court judges in rota-
tion, and Quarter Sessions and District Courts are held four times a year.
Bannaby.—Bannaby is a settlement of free selectors, "40 miles distant from
the city. The neighbourhood of Bannaby is celebrated for its waterfalls and the
Whombeyan caves. The caves are great natural curiosities. The entrance lies in
an amphitheatre surrounded by hills, and is 200 feet high, resembling a Gothic
window. The walls of the caves are marble interspersed with mica, numerous
stalactites being suspended both from them and the roof There are many small
chambers branching off into the mpuntain. The caves as yet have not been
thoroughly explored, the Government, however, has granted £2OO recently for
their exploration, and for the improvement of the road to them, which, when
carried out, will make it a popular resort for tourists.
Bungonia is situated on the main Southern road to Braidwood, 17 miles
south-east of Goulburn, and is 2000 feet above the sea level. It has a population
of 100. The post office is conducted by Mrs. Ellen Armstrong. There is a public
school, Mr. Michael J. Doyle being the teacher. The police office—R. Gracey.
The Shoalhaven diggings are 9 miles distant from Bungonia.
Collector is a township situated 224 miles south-west of Goulburn, and is
two miles from Lake George. The nearest railway station is at Gunning 15 miles off.
The Episcopalian, Wesleyan, and Roman Catholic denominations have places of
worship here. There is a public school which is conducted by Mr. Frederick
Longley. The population of Collector numbers 2100. It is situated 2210 feet
above sea level.
Crookwell. —The agricultural settlement of Crookwell lies some 30 miles
from Goulburn, near the western border of the district. There are steam flour
mills here, also branch of Bank of N.S.W., a public school conducted by
A. McNiven, and post and telegraph office. Court day—every Monday in each
month, Crookwell is 3000 feet above the level of the sea. Population, 240.
Laggan is about 30 miles from the city on the Reedy Creek and the main
road to Bathurst. This is a township with a good agricultural area to support its
population. Gold, tin, copper, and lead have been found in the locality. The
Burra Burra Lake is 12 miles from Laggan.
Long 1 Reach, is a township on the River Wollondilly, about nine miles
from the Marulan railway station. The limestone found here is of first-class
quality, that when polished resembles marble. Three miles off are the Gibralter
Rocks, from the top of which a grand view can be obtained of the surrounding
country.

PROFESSOR RUSSELL,
GOLD MEDALIST FOR HAIECUTTING,
(opposite royal hotel),
AUBURN STREET, GOULBURN.
IMMEDIATE RELIEF GIVEN FOR TOOTHACHE,
EAR-ACHE, OR FACIAL NEURALGIA.
Auburn Street, Goulburn, 11th August, 1882.
Professor Russell has extracted an exceptionally large tooth
for my son, and he was delighted at the dextrous manner in which it
was extracted, entirely without pain.
EDWIN QUARTLY,
Sign Writer and Decorator.
I was suffering from neuralgia and Professor Russell’s remedy
gave me immediate relief.
R. A. BURTON,
Storekeeper, Auburn Street.
16th July, 1882.
I obtained immediate relief from toothache by Profesor Russell’s
Anodyne.
MARGARET MONAHAN.
A month since I was suffering for weeks from intense pain in the
ear. I tried innumerable remedies without success till two drops from
a bottle Professor Russell gave me, cured me at once and it has never
returned. JAMES DAYIDSON.
“As good wine needs no bush,” so these testimonials, selected from some
hundreds, speak volumes.
Mrs. RUSSELL (nee Mrs. Bullock), “Dressmaker Incomparable,” can
now give really prompt attention to Ladies’ Orders.

How to Make Hens Lay. —To three gallons of boiling water add one half
ounce common salt, a teaspoonful of Cayenne pepper, and four ounces .of lard.

while yet boiling hot, stir in a meal made of oats and corn ground together in
equal proportions, until a thick mush is formed.

FOR CASH ONLY!
Some may argue that we are induced to make these concessions with a view to
influence trade to our other departments, of which there are—
DRAPERY, IRONMONGERY, CROCKERYWARE
& iffifflli, &S., &B>
—expecting that the revenue realised from an extra profit placed on goods sold in
these departments will more than cover any losses sustained on the Grocery side.
To this we say that all our goods are marked low, and we venture to think that
the evidence of a trial will altogether dissipate such an idea should it arise. We
therefore invite the public to come and judge for themselves.
