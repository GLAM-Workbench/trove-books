jVTALEKULA is one of the largest
and loveliest islands of the New
Hebrides group. It is about 70 miles
long and 25 miles at its widest part.
Ranges of hills about 2,000 feet high
rise from the beach, densely wooded to
their very summits, and with lovely
streams falling in cascades down the
valleys. The soil is deep and fertile;
yams, taro, bananas, breadfruit, and
cocoa-nuts grow abundantly. Varie-
gated crotons, crimson dracenas, hibis-
cus, coleus, and many other plants of
/i33SS/f //S ST

bright-hued leaf and flower, and beau-
tiful though songless birds, gay moths
and butterflies give brilliance to the
forest shades. No ferocious beasts
range our jungles ; a few harmless
snakes, green and striped lizards, dogs,
pigs, and rats are all our animals on
land. The sea however swarms with
fish and turtle, while shell fish—often
of huge size and leathery texture—are
found on the reef which fringes the
shore.
Clim
The climate is humid. The great
heat and excessive rainfall induce a lux-
uriant growth of vegetation, which when
decaying breeds malaria, the cause of
fever and ague from which no resident
escapes.
As there are active volcanoes on
the islands near, we have frequent earth-
quakes, and violent cyclones at times


work sad havoc among the plantations
and villages.
Commercial oahte of tin
| slant) b.
It is difficult to realise the extra-
ordinary fertility of these islands and
their commercial value. An infini-
tesimal area of the group is planted in
coffee and bananas, yet 200 tons of coffee
fetching from sd. to Bd. per lb. in Sydney
is exported annually, while the Sydney
steamer takes up 15,000 bunches of
bananas every three weeks. Both
coffee and bananas are of the finest
quality. In addition over 2,000 tons of
copra (the dried kernel of the cocoa-
nut) are exported every year. Each ton
requires 6,000 cocoanuts for its manu-
facture, and these are hardly missed
from the thousands used for food or
left rotting in the bush.


C( n Uafib.es anb tjmr Customs.
The people, of whom there are
about 20,000, are of Papuan race, dark
brown in colour, with thick lips, woolly
hair and beard into which, for lack of
pockets, they stick “ foreign ” matches
and scraps of tobacco, clasp or pocket
knife.
Cannibalism and the nameless
horrors of heathenism still hold sway
over a large portion of the island. It is
the centre of superstition to which the
natives of other islands come in large
canoes for initiation into mysteries of
heathen ritual and instruction in songs
and ceremonies. Their continual fight-
ings have driven them to live in
isolated villages, and broken up their
language into numerous dialects, so that
the people in one village have great
difficulty in understanding those ten
miles away.


Their dress is almost indescribable,
a belt of cocoanut cloth and a strip
of matting suffices the men, while the
women wear but a narrow girdle of
matting or calico. Both sexes adorn
themselves with armlets, beads, brace-
lets of boar’s tusks, plumes of feathers,
flowers and paint. On ordinary days
they daub themselves black. Ashes
are smeared over the body for
mourning; but for dances they affect
all manner of fantastic designs, paint-
ing the right side of the forehead red
and the left green, one cheek white and
the other black, a black streak down
the nose and a red spot on its tip, &o.
As there are no police and next to no
government, each man goes fully armed
with musket or spear, club or bow and
arrows —which are tipped with human
bone and poisoned.
They live in rude huts of bamboo
and sago palm thatch, like roofs set


upon the ground, destitute of all furni-
ture save a plaited cocoanut leaf for
a bed, a billet of wood for a pillow,
and a pile of stones whereon to cook
the “ pudding.” In such miserable
sleeping places we cannot expect
much “home life.” The man has his
own hut which he shares at night with
his valued pigs, and each of his wives
has one for herself. The boys, after
they reach the age of ten or twelve, herd
in the “Amil” or public house in the
village square; the girls ere they reach
that age have their two upper front
teeth knocked out, and are sold for long
tusked pigs to their future husbands
and carried off to their villages.
Women, with few exceptions, are
drudges and slaves, compelled by custom
to stand with averted faces or crouch
with covered heads at the wayside when
a man passes. A husband or grown-up


son considers himself defiled by the touch
of his wife or mother, or by eating food
prepared on the same fire as her own.
Woman is unwelcomed at birth, un-
honoured in life, and unwept at death.
Among the men themselves there are
different grades which cannot eat food
which has been cooked on the other’s fire.
Jfeasts, anb Virtues.
A Malekulan year consists of three
seasons. Four months work preparing
the plantations, then while the yams
are growing and bountiful Nature fur-
nishes abundant breadfruit for their
daily wants, four months idleness and
fighting until the yams are ripe, when
all feuds are patched up for the
Mangkes. These are feasts and dances
or dramatic representations given by
men who aspire to the honours of higher
rank. Many pigs are killed and their
flesh distributed, these must all be


boars which have been kept tied up for
years in order that their tusks may
grow long.
“ Man Malekula ” while possessing
most of the savage vices is not destitute
of the savage virtues. They are
avaricious, treacherous, cruel, licentious
and lazy, but on the other hand they
have a natural dignity, politeness, love of
children, generosity to each other, and
an uncomplaining endurance of hunger
or fatigue when necessary. Even some
of their deeds which seem so horrible to
us, such as the burial of the sick and
aged and infanticide, are prompted more
by pity than superstition or cruelty.
Superstitions.
They speak of a Creator named
“Bokoro,” who long ago made heaven
and earth and men. No worship is
paid to him, and all their legends about


Boys with Yams.




him are a strange mixture of extra-
ordinary power, foolishness, and lust.
They offer sacrifices to the spirits of
their ancestors, whose images rudely
carved and painted stand in the Amil,
and whom they invoke when in peril
on sea or land. Ere they set them up
for worship, however, they shoot arrows
into their eyes “ to”prevent them seeing
too much.” They also stand in great
fear of the sacred men who by their
incantations cause wind and rain, disease
and death, and every man carries a few
sacred stones in a bag thrust into his
girdle to protect him from injury and
death.
As to the future life they believe
that after death a man’s spirit wanders
in the bush until his funeral rites are
performed, and then his spirit—driving
the spirits ofAhe pigs slaughtered at his
funeral—descends to Lelemis. Thev


seem to have no idea of a place of
punishment. All souls alike go into
Lelemis and there take rank according
to the number of the pigs they bring.
Lelemis is a dark, dreary place, and
it is very interesting to find how closely
their description of it resembles the
Hades of the Greeks, or the place of the
dead described on an ancient Assyrian
inscription :
“ The house men enter but cannot return
from,
The place where dust is their food,
Their nourishment clay,
The light they behold not,
In darkness they dwell.”
But, after all, the real gods of the
Malekulans are their pigs! Watch a
number of them squatted on the ground
and talking, and you will see the speaker
with curved forefinger at his jaw
describe the tusk of the particular
beauty under discussion. The shadiest
spot in the yard, the warmest corner in


the hut, are reserved for “ Bui,” and on
the march, while the man with rope tied
to the pig’s fore leg “persuades” him
along, the wife must follow with
bamboos of water to pour over his back
lest the sun should “ eat ” him. With
pigs a man thinks he can obtain every
good both in this life and the next. Two
or three atone for all crimes against
property or person ; ten purchase him
a wife; a hundred slaughtered at
intervals raise him to the highest
honours of chieftainship, while according
to the number sacrificed at his grave so
is his honour and happiness in the
spirit world.
Such are a few of the more striking
features of savage Malekula. It is only
after a considerable residence among
them that one comes to realise more
fully the degradation of the horrible pit
and miry clay of heathenism.


In 1887 the Presbyterian Church of
Victoria sent out the Rev. Alex. Morton
and myself as pioneer Missionaries to
Malekula. My station was endowed
by Thomas Russell, Esq., of Victoria, in
memory of his daughter “ Amy Ger-
trude,” an example worthy of imitation
by others of God’s stewards. Two
years later the Rev. J. Gillan settled on
one of the densely populated little islets
off the N.B. coast. In 1892, however,
Mr. Morton resigned on account of his
wife’s health, and was succeeded by the
Rev. Frederick J. Paton (Dr. J. G.
Paton’s second son). In 1895 the
Rev. R. Boyd broke new ground on the
west coast.
An attempt was made almost
simultaneously with our settlement to
establish a French Roman Catholic






Mission at several points along the
coast, but although still there, their
success has not been conspicuous. At
all the stations encouraging progress
has been made amid much opposition
and frequent perils. At my own station
—Aulua —the progress attained has been
after long and painful work. The
manual labour which falls to the lot of
the Missionary and his wife in clearing
the ground, erecting a house and
making the place habitable, often with
little help save their own hands, is very
great. One has to plod on, learning the
language from the lips of the natives,
and living down their suspicions and
hostility by gentleness and forbearance.
This, too, in a depressing climate where
the slightest exertion induces copious
perspiration ; often working in trembling
ague or burning fever, and with neither
wholesome food to tempt the weakened


appetite nor sympathetic friends to
speak a word of cheer.
Jfrmn garhiuss to
Our work has passed through all
the stages of curiosity, indifference,
hostility, and interest. At first crowds
came day after day to “gape” at the
wonderful white man and his belong-
ings. The house and its furniture, the
dinner cooking on the kitchen stove, and
the looking glass all came under their
critical review ; and generally the inspec-
tion ended by a request for “ one
something” as payment for the honour
of the visit. At length having satisfied
their curiosity and got all they could
out of us, and beginning to understand
somewhat of our errand among them,
they dropped off. For nearly five years
we worked with hardly a ray of hope.
Going out to the villages we were able


to reach a number, but not one would
come at all regularly to the Mission
house. Gradually some interest awoke,
and the Story of God’s Love stole into
the hearts of a few, but with the interest
came also the opposition. Time and
again we gathered a few boys around
us only to have them dispersed by an
outburst of feasting or hostility. Fine
red flannel shirts, sewn with much
labour by the Missionary’s wife for a
class of boys, would be seen the week
after wrapped round muskets to keep
the rain from “eating” them, while
their owners glistened in a fresh coat
of paint.
In 1892 a little morning school of
four was formed, and others were holding
off anxious yet afraid to join us. The
crisis came one day when Bara-bunk-a-
bunk, our earliest friend and first


convert, came along in great distress,
saying “Oh Missionary, I am dying,
someone is burning my *nesogk,” and
so terrified was he that he had eaten
no food for two days. I gave him a
warm cup of beef-tea and a hard biscuit
which so revived him that he went
home and ate a good meal of yam and
pudding. He is alive yet. Jehovah
was acknowledged to be stronger than
the “ Temes ” and from that time the
Gospel began to win its way. In
September, 1894, we had the joy of
baptizing four men and of sitting down
with them at the Lord’s table —the
first time that Holy Sacrament was
celebrated on Malekula. One of the
men had distinguished himself in
heathen days by his opposition to the
‘Anything which had come in contact with his
person, uneaten food, or a scrap of clothing.

||loruing JUp.
Now there are 34 communicants
and about 500 people under Christian
teaching at Aulua and some of the
surrounding villages where Teachers
from other islands have been settled. Of
these, 200 have broken their “ taboos ”
and put on clothing. Near the Mission
house there are two Christian Villages
which are constantly receiving fresh
accessions from the heathen. They
have some rudiments of law and order
in the shape of a Magistrate and two
policemen, whose office hitherto has
been almost a sinecure. None are
excluded from these villages who will


wear clothing and refrain from gross
heathen practices. Even polygamists
are admitted, but they generally find
the atmosphere so tonic that after a little
they are content with one wife. Nor
do we refuse old men who have not
courage enough to break the habits
of a life time by eating in common with
the others. The village is a kind of
outer court into which all in whose
hearts “ there is found some good thing
toward Jehovah ” are welcome.
Thirteen of our church members
are being trained as Teachers, some at
home the rest at the Teachers’ Institu-
tion on Santo. lam anxious to increase
the number of these Native Teachers as
mtich as possible, as it is on them we
must depend for the evangelisation of
the thousands of heathen yet unreached.
These converts are at home among the
people, and they understand their


language, customs, and modes of
thought better than the European
Missionary can ever hope to do.
Our people are not perfect Chris-
tians by any means. They have
defects, and at times the old leaven
of heathenism manifests itself in sad
relapses into sins of temper and unclean-
ness ; but on the whole their consistent
lives, earnestness in prayer, attendance
on the Means of Grace, efforts to
evangelise their heathen friends, and
their Christian liberality, lead me to
affirm without hesitation that many of
them are New Creatures, born of the
Holy Spirit, and living for God’s glory.
A stranger might not think them either
very clean or very energetic, but to be
fair we must compare them with their
heathen brethren in order to realise
somewhat of “ the hole of the pit from
whence they were digged.” They show


their sincerity by their aggressive zeal,
starting without food long before day-
light on Sabbath mornings in order to
catch the “ sons of darkness ” ere they
go off to their plantations ; and by the
fact that during the past five years they
have contributed over £7O in copra,
arrowroot, and money, for their new
church and the printing of the Scriptures
in their own tongue.

God has wonderfully blessed us on
Malekula, but the work is only begin-
ning. The peculiar circumstances of
the field, its numerous dialects, and the
isolation of its tribes, demand a larger
staff of workers in proportion to its
population than other fields. Two more
Missionaries could find ample scope for
their energies on the north west coast,
or on the Maskelyne islets in the south.






We seek that through your prayers
and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus
Christ we may continue holding forth to
these natives the Word of Life until
“ the little one become a thousand and
the small one a strong nation.”

The New Hebrides is a group of
80 islands lying between Long. 166
deg. to 170 deg. W. and Lat. 14 deg. to
21 deg. S. They were seen and visited
by Quiros in 1606, but were really
discovered and named by Captain Cook
in 1774. For many years the group was
the happy hunting ground of sandal
wood traders and Kanaka recruiters.
The atrocities committed by those
sandal wood traders led to the murder
of John Williams and Harris, who in
1839 made an attempt to introduce the
Gospel. Under the auspices of the
London Missionary Society, Drs. Turner
and Nisbet resided for a short time on
Tanna, but had to leave owing to the
hostility of the natives. The first


Missionary permanently settled was
Eev. Dr. Geddie, from Nova Scotia.,
who began work in 1848 on Aneitynm,
the most southerly island of the group.
Under his labours and those of Rev.
Dr. Inglis from Scotland, settled in
1852, the whole island was Christianised
in about 20 years.
In course of time other Missionaries
came, among them Rev. Dr. J. G. Raton,
who by voice and pen has done more
than anyone else to create an interest
in the New Hebrides. The work spread
northward. Upborne by the prayers of
God’s people all over the world, tended
by the labours, and watered oft by the
tears and blood of many devoted
Missionaries and Native Teachers, the
New Hebrides Church has increased
until it now numbers 2,000 communi-
cants and 12,000 adherents with a band
of 270 Native Teachers and Pastors.


Last year these natives contributed
over £l,OOO in arrowroot, copra, and
money for the printing of the Scriptures
in over twenty of their dialects, and for
other Mission purposes.
There are still over 70,000 heathen
in the group, principally in the large
northern islands. This does not include
Aoba, Pentecost, and Aurora which at
present are visited by the Melanesian
(Episcopal) Mission. It is only ten years
since a beginning was made in evangelis-
ing the northern islands, and they are
not fully manned yet. The results of
this extension of the work will be more
apparent in a few years.
The Mission is supported by the
Presbyterian Churches in Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, and by the
Free Church of Scotland. Within the
last few years the “John G. Paton


Fund,” organised by Mr. A. K. Lang-
ridge, of London, and the Eey. Jas.
Paton, 8.A., of Glasgow, contributed
to by friends in all the churches whose
hearts have been touched by Dr. Paton’s
fervent appeals, has given generous help
to every department of the work.
The internal affairs of the Mission
are managed by the Missionaries in
their yearly meeting of Synod.


“THE JOHN G. EATON
MISSION FUND,”
Which already supports Five
Missionaries (1 Clerical, 1
Medical, 1 Assistant at the
Teachers’ Training School, and 2
Artisan Assistants) besides a
LARGE NUMBER OP NATIVE
Teachers and Students, seeks
to accomplish the extension of
the New Hebrides Mission as
A PERMANENT MEMORIAL TO THE
DEVOTED LABOURS AND HEROIC
life of Dr. John G. Paton.
HOW TO HELP.
Friends may help the Mission by
contributions to the Mission
Fund, either for the support of
the Missionaries of the Fund, or
of Native Teachers or Students,


or by distributing copies of the
Magazine Quarterly Jottings
which gives the latest news from
the Islands. Or arrangements
may be made for the Lantern
Lectures, or Loan of Slides (of
which there are nearly 200).
There are also Collecting Boxes
and Cards, which will gladly be
sent on application.
Please address the Hon. Organizing
Secretary of the Fund who will
gladly answer any enquiries.
