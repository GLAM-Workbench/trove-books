IN MEMORIAM
Mrs. Margaret M ‘Kin non, died at Jamberoo,
27th July, 1894, aged 64 years.
11 1 heard a voice from heaven saying unto me,
wr te, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.” —
Rev. ziv. 18.
No mother now, we whisper as the tear
' Bedims the eve;
Alone, jet not alone; a sweet voice near
Breathes in soft tndence to the list’ning ear,
“ ’Tis I, ’tis I.”
No mother now ! our day is turned to night,
Our joy to grief:
In her we found our stay and chief delight;
What now can make our oheerless home more bright,
Or give relief ?
No mother now to guide us through life’s chill
And dreary road ;
Gushed are her footsteps, and her voice is still,
We bow submissively to Jesu’s will,
And bear the load.
No mother now ! the poor, bereaved, distressed
Have lost a friend
Whose honoured name will live but to be blest
Through cloud and sunshine, quiet and unrest,
Unto life’s end.
No mother now! but we shall meet again
On yonder shore;
The days are few that can to us remain ;
Then come the greeting and the glad refrain,
“ To part no more.”
S. E. W.
Sydney, 4/8/94.
