ALL?S WELL THAT ENDS WELL;
OR, A TRIPLE EVENT,
Small Towns for gossip scandal are famed,
For which you?ll say the good folks ought
to be blam'd,
But to moralize thus is out of my way,
For Old Maids and Widows will still have
their say.
Tis a pity they have?nt more to busy
their minds,
Than listening to scandal, and peering
thro* blinds;
And all your affairs are quit� their busi-
ness,
While of their own they are perfectly
heedless.
In North of Tasman's Isle lies sweet
Ls B ��.n.
Long fam'd for religion, and girls who
carry on,
The queerest capers, quite heedless of
disgrace,
And each time they meet you stare right
in your face.
But glad I'm to say there are exceptions,
Tho'they are scarce m my own'recollection
Last year, in a calamity felly?
The death of a Doctor, who lived very well,
Leaving behind him a family of nine,
About whose vagaries we?ll take up your
time.
The mother?as good a General as can be
found,
In the interest of her family up is quite
bound,
And having four daughters marriageable
quite,
To look after husbands she thinks it so
right,
That to get them at trifles she will not
stick, 1
And if very hard press'd will call on Old
Nick !
For assistance. Now this family of four
Shees,
Know fully the affairs of most of the Hes;
To such perfection in this art have they
come.
That in their own circle they rivals have
none.
Lein M6re ??The General/' with face
like the moon,
Bays, with headaches and cares shell die
very soon;
Of writing long letters she's so very fond,
That to stop would put her in the slough
of despond;
Of ideas, I swear she has not many,
*And the largest of them is matrimony.
So keen after men have her girls been
raking,
That they?d take the first fish that lives
the ? Lake? in.
But as Bluebeard says? *? To our tale,?
There's Tera, { the eldest, with figure full
tall? Te. rI s a
Weighs eleven stone, so is not very small;
Head large, hair brown, bust passing
good, though slender ,
Feet flat.?By George ! lame from effects
of Winter.
Eyes, whose expression is anything but
love.
Though to hear bar sing you?d think she
was a dove;
As for mind, you?ll not be surprised to
hear,
That like to her mother?s, its very near.
On matrimony bent, ?at sweet seventeen,?
Bhe plighted her troth to young Georgy /
I ween,
And he, like a good 'un, on a fortune bent,
To survey New Zealand immediately went.
In Poverty Bay, as its name indicates,
Winter rules supreme?'tis the will of
the Fates,
And there fortunes are not so easily
made,
Tho* to make one you work with both
pick and spade.
For six Jong weary years did they cor-
respond,
And of him all that time she seem'd very
fond;
But a change came o'er the spirit of her
dream?
She thought he would now think her
milk, and not cream.
Bo a letter indited, and to him sent?
He read it
??-?, �^claim'd,
Ah I Now is tho Winter of my discontent!
Mias Tera being now in affections quit�

Look'd around and east eyes on 11. S. Q.
But he, sly dog, having other fish to fry,
Wouldn?t go into the net?twas ail in Ms
eye,
And as she could not fall back on Old
Tave y
Whom by the way, she met while visiting
the Cave,
She still undaunted, by obstacles un-
deterr?d,
While glancing round her spy*d the owner
of a herd.
Who. chanced to be visiting Longford
Hall,
Well known from Tom Noddy, who is
is not very tall A^cKcv *
This far fam'd mansion is oft the resort
Of country swells, and loud bouncing ii
their forte.
This gentle swain, though a very great
Barker , r
T?s said by his"friends a very poor Biter ;
In animal instinct by nature well gifted,
His mental acquirements to sea have
drifted, �, ~ .
Tho' engaged to a girl by name
He thought Tera io figure did her excel.
And forthwith to courting attention did
pay,
Well knowing what the world and Estel
would say .
Now our charming heroine, up to the
mark, 7*
Determined with Alfred to have a good
lark?
They had it: in two days after he pro-
pos'd?
She accepted much quicker than he sup-
pos'd.
On Thursday?kind reader mark well the
day?
The Gen'ral to the public had much to
say, ~
Of Tera's engagement to a young curate, ?'Ayth*v
The heir to a church dignatory's estate,
And on the Friday the Gen?ral did state,
That Tera was engaged to Alfred the
Great! !
In presents most grand twelve pounds
Alfred did spend,
And of showing ?em to friends there was
no end.
Watch, chain, brooch of diamonds, locket
for his hair,
Gen?rosity unbounded in one so fair.
Strike while ids hot is the GenTals motto,
For she deem?d Alfred slippery in toto,
And ?name the day, the happy day,?
was the word,
Held o?er him by the fam?ly like a naked
sword;
After soma hesitation, and much palaver,
He swore that in January he would have
her. ?
?It never rains but it pours,? for her
sister Poll,
Will in theliame month enter Wedlock
Sol:
Ema with a sprightly young man worthy
her love.
And unknown to Gen'ral Cathcart. By
Jove ! ~ *
This ? immortal crusher? did Harry
unseat,
In the spanking race of love, for this
young aweec.
Poor K&rry determin'd to foreign parts
to go,
To recover the effects of this dread blow?
There?s luck in odd numbers cri'd
X O IT, jy v 1 *
Oh DickieT If you?ll hare me, I will
have you.
Said Dickie, give me time until I can sec,
Whether the young Georgo-street widow-
will take me.
Poor little Ralacl&e infection has caught,
And her hand and heart to Roddy O. haa
brought. dVwn*.
The Gen?ral's quite lonely at last, c ; /
On a clerical batchelor her eyes
And popp?d the question in a manner so
new,
He put on his hat, and said ?Madam,
Adieu !
Now, kind reader, if thus far you have
perus?d,
I trust with what?s been said you art
amus?d.
And you?ll admit to the Gen?ral its a
tickler.
And I am your?s obediently,
