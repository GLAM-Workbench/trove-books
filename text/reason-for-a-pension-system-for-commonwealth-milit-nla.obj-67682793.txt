1911.
Dear Sir, ?
It has been generally recognised for some considerable time
that the Military service in the Commonwealth, in respect to pay
and pension, has many disadvantages when compared with Mili-
tary Service in all European countries, including the United
States of America, Canada and India.
Judging by the pension systems for soldiers prevailing in
these countries It would appear that the payment of pensions is
an established economic maxim, the value of which is not fully
recognised in the Commonwealth.
As an indication that our legislators recognise the desira-
b'lity of having some system established, attention may be
directed to Part X., par. 123, of the Defence Act, 1903-1910,
which reads as follows: ?
?Funds may be established in such manner and subject to
such provisions as are prescribed for providing for the
payment of annuities or gratuities to members of the
Defence Force permanently injured in the performance
of their duties, and for the payment of annuities or
gratuities to members of the Permanent Forces who
are retired on account of age or infirmity.?
The many advantages accruing from a pension system for
soldiers are obvious; economies effected and efficiency of service
are no doubt the primary reason for its adoption throughout the
civilised world. Special inducement for long service is always
recognised as an important consideration in the administration of
business institutions. This should especially commend itself to
the service of a soldier of the present period considering the
large expenditure involved in the primary and qualifying training.
In seeking a reason for the objections to the introduction of
a pension system for Commonwealth service, it is found to be
the general public belief that the pay is so much higher than


that paid in Great Britain that any obligation for payment of
pension is non-existent.
With a view of dispelling this popular illusion an arbitrative
comparison of the pay of the British versus the Commonwealth
Soldier is submitted :

An examination of these figures clearly shows that the posi-
tion of a soldier in relation to that of a citizen is considerably
depreciated in the Commonwealth when compared with his com-
rade of the British Service, inasmuch as that the citizen in the
Commonwealth receives from 8o per cent, to 130 per cent, over
his corresponding pay in Great Britain.
It is worthy of note that the most parsimonious critic has
never yet accused the British Government of an extravagance of
pay to Warrant and Non-commissioned officers and men in the
British Army. Opponents to local pensions admit that payment
of pension is a necessity when such low rates of pay prevail,
therefore, in Great Britain the pension of a soldier is in reality
an integral part of the soldier?s emoluments.
In computing the value of a soldier during his service the
value of his pension must necessarily be included to fix his status
in relation to that of the citizen in Great Britain.


The transference of the citizen of Great Britain to the Com-
monwealth increases his earning power by 80 to 130 per cent,
over the amounts he received in Great Britain, as a natural
consequence the increases would be necessary to the soldier to
enable him to maintain his social and financial status.
The following is the scale of pay which would be due to the
soldier for Commonwealth Service if a minimum increase of 80
per cent, was given over the rates of pay in the British Service:

This illustrates that if the
paid at the same rate as the

Imperial
of the Commonwealth was
Soldier for 21 years, plus
80 per cent, increase for Commonwealth service, 12 of the above
ranks would, on their present pay, be contributing the sum of
;�i,iio 4s. 2d. per annum to a pension fund.
The above rates may be claimed to appear high, but the con-
ditions of service must not be lost sight of. The Defence Act
creates the position and the regulations administer the Act;
these demand that a soldier shall cease the practice of his pro-
fession as a means of earning a livelihood for himself and those
dependent on him at a very early age; that he shall not enter
into any commercial venture during his service, consequently,
when he is cast from the service he finds that his qualifications


as a professional soldier have no commercial value; he is a long-
way short of the qualifying- age for an old age pension; his
chances of earning a subsistence are so remote that the victim
of the greatest sweater in the community would not envy his
position.
In considering the services of a soldier it is found that a
great many young - men are attracted to the service through its
seductive influence. After a very short service they begin to re-
alise that the gilt is only on the outside; a strenuous life is
necessary to obtain promotion, which offers such scant reward
that the majority leave the service on the completion of their
first period. This wastage averages 30 to 40 per cent, per an-
num, and is a dead loss to the Commonwealth, not considering
the wasted opportunities of the individual.
With a view to give effect to the expressed wish as set out
in the Defence Act various schemes for making provision for re-
tirement have been propounded, viz., Superannuation or Deferred
Pay. These schemes do not commend themselves to the service
as likely to meet the case of the soldier, whilst a pension system
meets the case in every respect.
In order to satisfy adverse critics that the payment of pen-
sions does not necessarily mean the payment of money
for which the public have not received an equivalent in service,
the only reasonable way is to treat the proposal as a business
transaction.
It is sought to maintain the relative status of the soldier to
the citizen, equal to that which prevails in Great Britain. This
necessarily means a general re-adjustment of pay to all ranks;
thus making the proportionate increases to the British pay to that
which has been obtained by all trades and callings.
To make provision for a system of pensions paid from the
consolidated revenue it would be necessary to make a compulsory
deduction from the pay so adjusted. The amount of deduction
to be decided on by actuarial investigation.
This method is in practice towards the London police; the


maximum deduction in that case is 2\ per cent, of the pay re-
ceived.
A similar method prevails in Canada in regard to Military
Officers; the deductions are 5 per cent, of salary.
It is worthy of note that in Canada provision is made to
ahow an officer to pay either by lump sum or instalment the
amount necessary to entitle him to the amount of pension due
for his length of service.
This clause would no doubt be particularly advantageous to
enable those nearing retirement to secure some consideration for
long and faithful service.
The fundamental idea of a pension payment is to guarantee
those who enter the service some assurance that when they are
compulsorily retired through invalidity, or old age, that they will
receive an allowance at regular intervals, sufficient to enable
them to live in a degree of comfort commensurate with that en-
joyed by them during their period of service.
In the case of retired soldiers a pension is incomparatively the
most desirable system. The payment is a reward for services
rendered; within prescribed limits it does not burden the soldier
with heavy deductions in pay, such as is the case under a de-
ferred pay system; it also relieves him of the responsibility of
handling a large sum of money. It is seldom found that men
who have drawn a lump sum instead of pensions are a success.
The mere mention of a deferred pay system is most unpop-
ular in the service. The proposal is looked on as an objection-
able kind of patronage on a par with the bonus system intro-
duced by certain classes of employers.
The proposal that a man?s earnings should be held as a guar-
antee of his good behaviour cannot commend itself to any self-
respecting citizen of the Commonwealth. It is most undesirable
to have any system which will menace the freedom of the indi-
vidual and reduce the service to a state of servility.
A superannuation system is only a non-economical tribute to
popu?ar .misunderstanding. The weight of the administrative
charges will have to be borne by those it is sought to benefit,


consequently the deductions will be comparatively higher than
those to pay pension as suggested.
It is advocated that the lines fol'owed by the most advanced
countries in respect of pension be adopted, and that provision be
made for widows and children.
Permission to hold meetings to discuss this question was
granted to the Service by the Minister for Defence, Senator
Pearce, and a committee representative of the various arms of the
service waited on him by deputation on 24/10/10.
The position was carefully explained to him, and in reply he
said:?
?That he had recognised for some considerable time that
the pay of the service was unsatisfactory, and that he
proposed making some provision in the next year?s
estimates. He expressed grave doubts as to whether
a pension scheme would be acceptable to members of
the present Parliament. He had discussed a deferred
pay system with Colonel Wallack, which, he thought,
would meet the requirements of the deputation. He
promised to favourably consider the requests made,
and that he would bring the pension proposal before
the Cabinet.?
It is worthy of note that after the above interview the De-
fence Bill came before Parliament and par. 123, Part X,, Defence
Act, was submitted and adopted.
The Committee again waited on the /Acting Minister, Sena-
tor McGregor, to further urge the adoption of a pension scheme.
In reply to the latter request the Acting Minister said: ?
?He was pleased to have met the men and heard their
position. He knew that a great many difficulties ex-
isted as to the pay and other working conditions of
the Soldiers, but it must be remembered that all
these had come down to the present Government as
legacies from past administrations, and it had been
impossible to put everything right during the few
months they had been in power. The men might rest
assured, however, that early consideration would be
given to their representations, both respecting in-


creased pay and future provision for the retired soldiers
of Australia. To begin radical changes right away
would upset the calculations as to the cost of Mili-
tary Forces, and the public was naturally anxious
to keep in touch with the advancing cost. He hoped
that some system similar to that introduced for the
Naval Forces would soon be possible for the soldiers.
But that would scarcely meet the case of those who
had done faithful service for thirty years, because if
they came under a deferred pay system they would get
very little out of it. A man who had given thirty
years to the Military Service would find the world
very hard when he was suddenly launched on it with-
out money. The Minister was making inquiries into
the European systems, and would see how the difficulty
could be surmounted. Ministers had been considering
how they could evolve some scheme satisfactory to the
men and public. As to the request for a Board of
Inquiry, that would be put before the Cabinet at once.?
It is admitted that there is a necessity for some action to
meet the case.
The question of providing ways and means rests with Par
liament.
The position set out in the foregoing Is the desideratum of
the service. In your capacity as a Legislator you will be asked
to decide for or against a scheme on the Canadian lines.
Trusting that you will keep -the desires of the Service In view
and that your support and influence will satisfactorily complete
what is an admitted defect in the present conditions of Military
Service in the Commonwealth.
Issued on behalf of the Permanent
Military Forces by the
CENTRAL PENSION COMMITTEE.
