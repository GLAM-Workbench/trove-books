SYDNEY:
Printed and Published by William Aitlegate Gullick, Government Printer and Publisher of the State of
New South Wales, at Pkillip-street, 12th November, 1918.
HIS Excellency the Governor announces with sentiments of profound thankfulness that he is in receipt
of information to the effect that the Government of Germany has signed an Armistice with Great
Britain and the Powers allied with her, and the great war will accordingly terminate in the complete victory
of Great Britain and her Allies.
The official announcement will be made by His Excellency, the Premier and his colleagues, and the
Lord Mayor, at the Destroyer, in Martin Place, at 12 noon to-day.
To secure the celebration, of so great an occasion with due solemnity, His Excellency, upon the advice
of Ministers, has decided that Wednesday, 13th November, shall be strictly observed as a public holiday
throughout the State.
Arrangements are being made with the various churches for the holding of services during the morning,
and it is hoped that the citizens of the State will avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded of
returning thanks for the great and crowning mercy which Almighty God has vouchsafed to the Allied cause.
It is proposed to illuminate the City of Sydney. There will be a joint religious service in the Domain
on Wednesday, commencing at 3 p.m.
His Excellency reflects with pride upon the self-respecting dignity with which the citizens of the State
have always borne themselves in the celebration of great public events. He is satisfied that these great
tidings will be received in a spirit of gratitude to Divine Providence and that the pride and joy of the com-
munity in the triumph of our arms will express itself in sober gladness.
W. E. DAVIDSON,
By His Excellencyâ€™s Command, Governor,
