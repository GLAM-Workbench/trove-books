JN RESPONSE TO MANY REQUESTS,
we haüe Made and Des’gned, this our
SECOND Book of “ TODDLERS ’
WOOLLIES” with the hope ihat We haue been
enabled to fulfil tbe.se needs.
We haüe carefully giVen the rneasurements,
of each design, rather than the age, as We
find that “TODDLERS’ of same age Vary
so mach in size.
If you tafie care to Work in the “ Lensians”
slated, each article will Work io rneasurements.
Jl larger or smaller size may sometimcs be
obtained through the use of larger or smaller
needles as the case may be; or through the use
of coarser or finer wool.
‘Please remember — if you haüe any difficulty
with your knüling or crochet write to us about
it, enclosing a stamped and addressed enüelope.
We shall be very pleased to help you.

Row—Purl. Repeat these 2 rows for desired length.
<J.arter-st. —Knit on both sides.
Moss-st. —lst Row —Kl, PI. 2nd Row—Pl, Kl, placing the Kl over

<Grafting. —Divide the stitches equally on 2 needles, with the wool at
one end, and with the right side of work towards you, break off
wool, leaving a length; thread through a wool needle; with this
begin with needle nearest you. * Put needle through Ist st. as if to
knit, take it off, and draw the needle through. Put the needle
through the 2nd st. as if to purl, but do not take it off. Now on
the back needle take Ist st. as if to purl, and take it off. Take
2nd st. as if to knit, and do not take off. Repeat from * until all
stitches are grafted together.
TWO-COLOR OR JAZZ KNITTING.
The pattem is worked in by twisting the various colors of wool
■on the wrong side of work—that is to say, the color which is being
worked is twisted under and over the color not in use, the latter being
left at a loose tension so as to allow the correct olasticity to the
Iknitting.
