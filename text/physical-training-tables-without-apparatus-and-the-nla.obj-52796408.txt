NOTES.
1. Continuity is essential if Physical Training is to
produce the required results.
A daily lesson of from 10-20 minutes will therefore be
included in unit training programmes wherever possible
(Physical Training 1937, Secs. 22-26).
2. Each of the six Tables is compiled in two Parts
each Part is designed to take about ten minutes to
complete.
3. The Tables are arranged in progression. Tables 1
and 2 are very elementary and will be used for unfit
men, e.g., in training units on mobilization. Tables 3
to 6 are suitable for trained soldiers.
4. Part I, —(a) This Part of each Table is designed
as a “ daily dozen” to keep all parts of the body toned
up, and should be done daily. No exercise should be
omitted.
(6) Method of Application. —lt is recommended that
a soldier who knows the various exercises be placed in
full view of the class and Part I carried through on the
“ Follow my Leader” principle, the class taking the
time from him. The instructor is then left free to
correct faults, coach and give “ change” orders.
5. Part II of each Table contains exercises of a more
strengthening nature. This Fart should be done in
addition to Part I whenever time permits. In par-
ticular it should be given to young soldiers with under
three years’ service, and used in all training units on
mobilization.
6. Starting positions are given in small print. The
names of the exercises are in,thick type. Explanatory
notes are given in italics. The executive word of com-
mand is not included and depends on the nature of the
exercise. In rhythmical exercises it will usually be
“ begin,” or merely “change” from a previous exercise.
The left hand diagram in each exercise shows the
starting position of that exercise.
7. Quickening exercises and competitive team games
may be included at the end of Part I or Part II if the
instructor considers them necessary ; they should not,
however, be inserted in the middle of either Part.
Details of suitable games are given on pages 13 and 14.
8. The notes on recreational training subjects show
the recognised sequence of instruction in the various
events, and are produced on this Card to assist in-
structors in units.

SWIMMING.
Breast-Stroke.
Stage 1.
Land drill on benches. Movements as shown on
diagram.
Stage 2.
Leg action in water, at shallow end with hands on
rail and human support.
Stage 3.
Standing breast deep, practise arm action.
Stage 4.
Combined arm and leg movements, with human
support or belt.
Stage 6.
As for Stage 4, without support.
N.B. —As soon as the pupil can keep himself afloat make
him swim “lengths ” to develop confidence and stamina.
Faults may later be eliminated and the stroke improved.
1 2 3
Note (a) Breathe out during Movement 1.
(b) Breathe in during Movement 2.
CRAWL.
Leg Movements.
Stage 1.
Swimmer supported by either holding the edge of the
bath, or by another swimmer, who places one hand
on his chest and one on his stomach.
(1) Move legs slowly up and down from the hips ;
legs athletically straight; toes turned in.
Depth of kick varies with the size of the
swimmer. Increase the “flutter” of the
legs until the swimmer is proficient.
(2) Swimmer supports himself in the water with
a ball or petrol tin and propels himself
along with his feet.
(3) Dog-paddle with hands—flutter with legs.


Arm Movements.
Stage 2.
(1) Standing at side of bath left hand on rail, shoulder
partly submerged and body leaning forward
from the waist. Bight arm extended back,
just above water, little finger uppermost.
(2) Raise right elbow, bending forearm and bringing
it forward, completely relaxed, in a semi-circle
until wrist in line with shoulders.
(3) Extend arm forward until palm touches water in
front of face, keeping shoulders square and
elbow 3 or 4 inches higher than hand,
(4) Cup hand slightly; press downwards towards
centre line of body, until arm at right angles to
shoulder.
(6) Arm swerves outwards, passing close to hips,
giving backward pull and elbow straightens
until original position is reached, with hand
not leaving water until arm is straight.
(6) Repeat with other arm and finally both arms
together, ensuring complete relaxation.
Co-ordination.
Stage 3.
(1) Co-ordinate leg and arm movements. Leg action
is the foundation, although propulsion is mostly
through the arms. Try to isolate legs and arms
so that they work without affecting the trunk.
(2) Same number of leg beats to each arm cycle.
(3) Arm action must gradually fit in with leg action
not vice versa.
General.
(1) Breathing to be done once every arm cycle. Turn
head only as one arm passes the face and inhale.
Exhale under water, face to the front,
(2) Crawl cannot be learnt without complete relaxa-
tion and confidence of the swimmer. So sup-
port in the water is necessary in order to
isolate movements of legs, arms and head.
(3) The best support is a “Skimmer” swimming
teacher.
(4) Petrol tins or water-polo balls are quite a good
substitute.
