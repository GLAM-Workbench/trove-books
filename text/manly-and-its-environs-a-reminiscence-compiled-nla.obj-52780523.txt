‘‘The Sea hath Its Pearls.”
ft* ANL Y BEACH, the most fashionable and popular of health resorts, is justly named “The
Queen of the Southern Seas,” and needs no justification for the proud position it
4fj|| ||Wp > undoubtedly occupies.
'jt? Charmingly and picturesquely situate on the immediate northern arm of Port Jackson’s
majestic harbor, snugly nestled within its noble and imposing entrance gates, the town
tVg of Manly distant some seven miles from Sydney—stands upon the isthmus of land con-
'll necting the North Head territory with the mainland.
As a natural consequence Manly has the unique distinction of having two separate and
distinct sea-water frontages —the distance between each being about half a mile. The one facing the inner
harbor being named after the town itself; the larger and more pretentious beach, about a mile and a half
long, is known as the Ocean Beach, upon which lash the waves of the ever restless ocean.
The Rocky Headland Bluff to the north is
Queenscliffe, adjacent to which is a spacious lagoon
named Curl Curl. A sandbar separates this lakelet
from the sea except in boisterous and stormy flood
time, when the waters burst their bondage in their
joyous outbreak to the sea.
On the south side the Grounds of St. Joseph’s
College form the boundary, thence Westerly by sea to Middle
Harbor.

Steyne Reserve forms a picturesque background to the Ocean Beach, with its towering Firs and shelter
ing Pines, offering shady seats and well sheltered pathways.
The Esplanade adjoins either side of the Main Landing Pier in the Inner Harbor. Its wealth of
shade trees being largely taken advantage of by the frequent trippers and holiday - makers, this beach is a
favorite resort for children.
A well appointed Harbor Steam Ferry Service,
controlled and owned by the Port Jackson Steam
Co-Operative Shipping Co., Ltd., connects the
Metropolis with Manly. They have a fleet of six
spacious and handsomely appointed saloon steamers,
which run half-hourly trips daily throughout the
week, including Sundays leaving the Company’s
No. 3 Jetty at Circular Quay, Sydney ; fare, adults, 4d. each way.
The trip down the harbor is exceedingly varied and interesting, so much so, that the spectacle en
route is considered by world-wide voyageurs to be one of the most entrancing unsurpassable in point'ol
loveliness or artistic excellence in marine seascape portraiture.
As an alternative to the harbor trip a special pleasing and enjoyable route can also be made by
taking the ferry steamer to Milson’s Point or Mosman Bay, North Shore, thence by electric tram to the
Spit Ferry, where commodious coaches meet the visitor, who is driven to Manly by road, passing through
some of the most delightful bush scenery en route.
On landing at the Main Pier, Manly, by steamer, the visitor finds himself at the “ Corso,” and has
the option of a variety of entertainment. Here coaches leave for all the various Picnic Resorts. Con-
veyances take return trippers to the Spit Ferry for the tram trip to Sydney, or Middle Harbor,

Hot Salt Water Sea Baths —To
meet the requirements of visitors “ who
are afflicted by nature with nature’s ills,”
such as muscular afflictions, Rheumatism,
Sciatica, Lumbago, and the like, the
Municipality of Manly has, at great ex-
pense, erected a most commodious and I
extensive Hot Salt Sea Water Bath-house,
with every desired convenience, fitted with ..
all the latest and most improved appli-
ances for the relief of the afflicted.
Invalids receive every possible attention
from the qualified attendants. A special feature
in the preparation of the bath being that the pure
salt sea water is pumped direct from the depths of the
ocean into the bath itself, and then aerated with steam, the salt water thus retaining all its natural medical remedial
properties. It is claimed that hot salt sea bathing is not only conducive to health generally, but is most

efficacious in the relief ol the various ailments above referred to. Visitors desiring to avail themselves of
the Council's forethought can do so all the year round at a very moderate cost. The bath-house is so
divided and the baths so arranged that both sexes can be attended to simultaneously, that portion devoted
to the ladies being under separate management in another part of the building. The Baths were specially de-
signed and fitted by Hannam V Co., Sydney. Attached to the undertaking are the Municipal Latrines, Lavatories,
etc., which are generously placed at the disposal of the public.
Water Supply. -Manly has a magnificent supply ol fresh water,
obtained by a specially erected waterworks plant at French’s
Forest, situated about two and a half miles from the town.
To form the reservoir, a dam has been constructed
across Curl Curl Creek 280 feel long and 40 feet high,
this conserves a water lake of about 50 acres in extent.
This water, after going through all the modern pro-
cesses of filtration, is transferred by pumping operations
to the City Service Reservoir, situate upon. Red Hill,
immediately overlooking the town, from which the
tesidents are supplied by natural gravitation—the pressure
in the lower levels being qqlbs. to the square inch.
V ■ -
Swimming Baths.— Manly is the happy possessor of what is
admitted to be the largest and most efficiently equipped Gentlemen’s Swimming Bath in the State. To
keep pace with the times the baths have been considerably enlarged from their original dimensions —
they are conveniently situated in the inner harbor to the left of the Main Landing Pier, and are easily
discernable to the visitor on arrival.


The Ladies' Baths have a considerable frontage to clear water, conveniently located adjacent to the
Esplanade of the inner beach to the right. These are also well appointed.
Both baths are under the personal supervision of the Municipality, and the greatest, care is exercised
. . lo o o o
as to their perfect completeness. fv
X r v I w < , . i
Surf Bathing . —Surf bathing is principally indulged in on the Main Ocean Beach, Tlere,
all along this vast extent of sandy foreshore, large congregations of people are, under special restrictions as
to dress, etc., permitted to bathe ala Continental. The scene is one of great excitement. The Board
Swimming or .Shooting the Breakers a la Samoa, by expert swimmers, being considered one of Manly’s
greatest attractions during the summer. It is to the credit of the Municipality that, as a Council, they
passed a series of Hy-4aws rendering it permissible under
certain conditional restrictions, of which they are the arbiters,
that the general public could indulge in the luxury of a
salt water surf bath at any hour of the day or night.
The privilege is largely taken advantage of by local
residents and visitors of both sexes.
With a generous endeavor to neutralise the possi-
bility of accidents occurring to surf bathers and swimmers
generally, the Council have very thoughtfully placed moored
beacon buoys with life lines attached at various distances
along the foreshore, so that swimmers may avail themselves
of their assistance if required. The Council have also
erected covered dressing and shelter sheds for the convenience
of bathers, for which no charge is made. .

Lovers' Walk, Commonwealth Parade.


Manly abounds in ideal spots for private picnic parties, charmingly secluded nooks for Gipsy Teas in
fairy dells, cosy corners, artistic retreats, romantic walks and sandy beaches, prominent amongst which are
The Lovers’ Walk, Fairy Bower, Shelly Beach, The Cardinal’s Path, Castle Hill, Observation Point, the
Reservoir, and the Kangaroo Look-out. From the last-named point of vantage one of the prettiest
panoramic views of Manly is obtainable.
The district of Manly embraces Curl Curl, Dee - Why, Narrabeen, Rock Lily, Newport, Pittwater, Bay
View, Balgowlah, The Spit and Middle Harbor, all of which are acceptable as picturesque holiday nooks, and
well worth visiting. A most enjoyable drive may be taken by coach from the Main Landing Pier to any
of the above-named holiday resorts as far as Newport, and Bay View, Seaside watering places on the banks of
the Pittwater. The route lies through some of the most enchanting scenery obtainable in the district.
The present Council of the Municipality of
Manly consists of:

KANGAROO BLUFF.
This rugged headland is surmounted by a stone obelisk representing a typical Australian
kangaroo, and was erected some years ago by Mr. Henry Gilbert Smith, one of Manly’s earliest settlers,
and its then largest landed proprietor, Mr. Smith’s residence was close to the base of the Kangaroo Hill,
and it is accepted generally that as in the early days all this hill and the surrounding country was densely
timbered, the stone kangaroo was placed in such a central position to serve as a guiding landmark. From the
summit of the bluff upon which the Kangaroo stands, the finest panoramic view of Manly is obtained.
A meed of praise is certainly due the present Mayor and Council for the consistency with which
they have done and are doing their utmost to popularise Manly as the Premier Health Resort of Australia.
Many improvements have been made and several important developments are in contemplation. To them
the thanks of the citizens and the visiting public are certainly due.
NARRABEEN.
To those who love cliff climbing on precipitous hills, Narrabeen offers ample enjoyment. Deep
ravines may be explored, through which the sun rarely penetrates. In these gullies are to be found
countless waterfalls with their beautiful prismatic hues, and ferns of such lovely nature as to send an admirer
into a state bordering upon ecstasy. Here may be found the Jhiiv de Us of Australia, the Waratah—also
in great abundance, Xmas bells, native roses, and the most beautiful of all the native flora, “ the flannel
flower.” As the visitor proceeds the Salvation Army Industrial Farm is reached, from the balconies of
which a very beautiful view of the ocean is obtained. Dee Why Lagoon is in close proximity and Long
Reef is renowned for its deep sea fishing. Narrabeen Lake is nestled at the foot of the lofty hills by

which it is surrounded —a most beautiful and artistic effect frequently happens here when the setting sun
throws its golden rays athwart the placid waters of the lake and tints the foliage of the surrounding
edges a lovely orange green. Visitors should not fail to obtain boats and explore Middle and Deep
Creeks at the head of the lake, also take a climb to the top of powder works hill and feast their eyes
with the grandeur of the scenery around them—the Pacific Ocean, with its broad expanse and ever varying
hues, the magnificent Narrabeen Beach and surroundings, with its wealth of color, leaves a very
pleasing remembrance. The method of communication is by coach from Manly, fare i/-, or by private
conveyance, via the Spit or by the Lane Cove-road from Gordon.
ROCK LILY.
Passing through Narrabeen, the visitor reaches the picturesque Rock Lily, so called after the
beautiful native lily which is indigenous to the district. The best view of the district can be
gained by ascending Sheep Station Hill. At the hotel are to be seen a most unique collection of
alpesco paintings, highly prized by the proprietor and generally admin d by visitors. Adjacent is Mr. J.
