Though uot regarded as incurable, Consumption is still one of the most insiduous and
Gonsumptiot]. intractable of diseases. The Medical profession throughout the world is practically
unanimous in its opinion that drugs are of little value, the one hope of success lies
in the open-air treatment. This treatment is carried on at the Nunyara Sanatorium under the most favour-
able and agreeable conditions. Every consumptive as soon as the disease is diagnosed, should go at any
rate for a time to a Sanatorium in order that the principles of treatment may be thoroughly mastered.
The treatment thus commenced can be continued at home. Another advantage of the Sanatorium is the
temporary isolation from home and friends until the patient is thoroughly educated in all the precautions to
be taken to prevent contagion.


J"tje Sanatorium.
Belair has Jong had a reputation for possessing one of the most suitable climates in
Jts Situation. Australia for the treatment of this disease, and the site has been carefully chosen to
take full advantage of the climatic conditions. Its altitude (1,050 feet) and open
position does much to mitigate the summer heat; while in winter its northerly aspect, with well-wooded
rising ground to the South gives effective shelter from cold winds. The moderate rainfall and invigorating
mountain air go to make up a climate that would be difficult to surpass. The outlook from the balconies
and bedrooms is one of the ffnest in South Australia, giving a panoramic view of St. Vincent's Gulf, the
Adelaide plains and the Mount Lofty ranges. The gradual slope of the hillside affords excellent drainage,
so that the walks in the grounds and neighbouring roads dry quickly, and it is quite exceptional for the
weather to interfere with out-door exercise. Flower and fruit gardens, pine plantations and picturesque
scenery all go to enhance tiie attractiveness of the Sanatorium.
After having visited various English and Continental Sanatoria the Medical Director

J*he Building specially planned and built Nunyara for the purpose of carrying out the open-air
treatment. Neither thought nor expense has been spared in making the equipment
perfect and fully equal to the best of its kind in the old world. The building is a handsome one of white
freestone finished in terra-cotta bricks and roofed with Marseilles tiles. These tiles add much to the appear-
ance, but their chief value lies in the fact that they reduce the temperature of the balconies and rooms

Intending patients are invited to inspect the Sanatorium at any time. Medical practitioners are
always welcomed and especially desired to visit their patients while undergoing treatment. Patients on leaving
are returned to their medical attendant with a written report of their case.
The Sanatorium is half a mile from the Belair railway station. Patients are required to bring
warm under-clothing, wraps, a rug, and a hot water bottle (indigrubber). Visiting days : Wednesdays and
Saturdays. Friends are reminded that patients do better if not too frequently visited.
FEES. — £4 4/- per week (Chalet, £3 3/-) inclusive : no extra charges, except personal laundry,
alcohol, only taken when medically prescribed, and special nursing.
A Sanatorium is not a hospital but a health resort, and the treatment, though thorough and effective,
is at the same time pleasant. Only favourable cases are taken and the social life, varied walks and motor
drives in charming scenery have a most beneficial effect. The walks in the neighbourhood, including the
National Park, are very numerous.
