WOODSIDE—DISTRICT OF ONKAPARINGA
A s the name implies, “Onkaparinga” is purely
aboriginal, and the boundaries of the District of
Onkaparinga were originally the water-
shed of the river bearing that name , /
which flows through this town.
Woodside is approximately the centre
of the district, and may be termed its
most important town. Conveniently
situated in the fertile valley of the
Onkaparinga, 23 miles by road from
Adelaide, and 33 miles by rail, at an
altitude of 1,100 feet, Woodside is one
of the most popular of the “Hills”
townships. The town comprises ap-
proximately 100 buildings, and has a
population of just on 400.
The first settlers came to the district
in 1837, most of whom were employed
as shepherds by the South Australian
Company.
The first meeting of the Onkaparinga
District Council (appointed by virtue
of Act No. 17 of 1852) was held on
14th July, 1853, the Councillors being
A. Lorimer (Chairman), W. Kelly, r •
James Johnston, F. W. Kleinschmidt, and J. Weinert,
with J. Fergusson as Clerk. A grant‘of £250 was
obtained from the Government for preliminary ex-
penses. Eary Council records show the first assessment
of the district (£15,020) to have been made by Mr. S.
Paltridge in 1854; the assessment of
to-day being £29,726.
In the year 1854 Messrs. J. Barker,
W. Giles, and S. Davenport were nomi-
nated by the Council to form part of
the Central Road Board.
During the year 1862 the district was
divided into five wards (subsequently
increased to six by the inclusion of
Forest Rangel, with a representative
for each, the wards being named Wood-
side, Hahndorf, Lobethal, Charleston,
and Oakbank. In 1888 a part of the
township of Hahndorf, with some ad-
joining sections, jvere ceded to the
District Council of Euchunga, and the
remaining portion was renamed Bal-
hannah Ward.
During the 72 years of the existence
of the Council the office of Chairman
has been filled by Messrs. A. Lorimer
(7 years), H. Duffield (4), H. Kelly
Secretary. (1), R. Kay (1), J. C. F. Lauterbach

J. M. Ferry (9 months), J. R. Sinclair (14 years),
R. Wilson (3 years), T.
Hutchens (12 years), R.
Caldwell (5 years), C.

and the present Clerk,
H. G. Tolmer (6 years).
Messrs. H. F. Thiele, R.
W. Kerber, W. C. Man-
ner, A. S. Hughes, and
H. 0. Spoehr constitute
the present Council.
That the conditions of
living during the early
stages of development
of the district were not so
peaceful as those of to-
day may be gathered
from the following ex-
tracts from the diary of
the late Charles New-
Main Street
man: —“In the year 1839 the South Australian Land
Company selected a special survey on the sources of
the Onkaparinga River. A party consisting of three
shepherds, three assistants, and an overseer were at
once placed on the new purchase, where we had many
troubles to contend with. The blacks were defiant, and
Page Seven
the wild dogs were impudent with cold and hunger,
particularly at lambing time. As we had nothing but
netting for our yards, fires had to be made at night
to help protect the sheep. We had not been long on
the new' holding when two men, Joe Stagg and Gofton,
called on us, carrying
saddles, and asked for a
night’s lodging. They
explained that they had
lost their horses at
Mount Crawford, where,
no doubt, they had been
spying about with an idea
of stealing cattle.
“The man Stagg was
soon afterwards hanged
for the murder of his
mate Gofton.
“On another occasion
w'e had to leave the hut,
and on our return found
that Green and Wilson,
two famous horse stealers,
had robbed us of all
our flour, sugar, and tea,
Their camp was near
as well as wearing apparel
what is now known as the Woodside Mines. About
this time I was shepherding near where the towmship
of Charleston now stands. A trooper approached
and asked if I had seen a strange man pass that way
during the last day or so. He w'as looking for one
Wood side, looking North.

of three men who had turned bushrangers and who
were last seen near Crafers. These were Curren,
Hughes, and Fox, the last-named (a Vandemonian) an
escaped convict, being still at large. Shortly after-
wards I saw the
trooper returning with
Fox as prisoner.”
The apex of Wood-
side’s ' prosperity was
reached during the
time of working of the
Bird-in-Hand and sur-
rounding mines, situ-
ated about two miles
east of the town, be-
tween the years 1882-
90. and old residents
still talk of the rol-
licking times of that
period. Some hun-
dreds of men were
employed at the diffe-
rent mines, and gold
to the value of more
than £70,000 was ex-
tracted. Like many other South Australian towns,
Woodside is afflicted with the slump in mining, but
Bridge over Onkaparinga at Woodside

there is little doubt that much wealth remains in the
gold-hearing quartz reefs at Reefton Heights and else-
where near the town. Aided by modern mining methods
and machinery these mines will at some future date
provide employment
for a great number of
men and prove a
source of wealth to the
owners and restore
to Woodside some of
its lost glory.
The immense possi-
bilities of the Wood-
-5i d e district for
dairying and grazing
purposes has attracted
much attention of late,
and many holdings
have changed hands
at prices that few
parts of the State can
command. On the
whole we are a pros-
“The Tiers ” perous community,
well satisfied with our
possessions and happy in the knowledge that Woodside
provides all that any reasonable person could wish for.

THE ADELAIDE MILK SUPPLY CO-OPERATIVE COY. LTD. (AMSCOL.)
The factory at present
owned by “Amscol”
was started in 1905 by
Messrs. La u t erbach
Bros, as a cheese and
butter factory, the
building being origin-
ally a Methodist
Chapel. A stone in
the building shows the
date of completion to
have been in 1857.
Started in a small
way, the factory has
increased enormously,
and to-day sends thou-
sands of gallons of
milk to the city consumers, as well as large supplies
of “Amscol” butter and cheese. Remarkably successful
results attended the
efforts of Messrs. Lau-
terbach Bros., who
built up a wonderful
business, and they
bold the distinction
of having gained
the world’s record
for butter at the
British Dairy Show,
having been placed
no fewer than sixteen
times, and, in addi-
tion, secured first
prize at the 1906
British Dairy Show
against 143 world com
petitors. Mr. J. Lauterbach, the present manager, ha«
been continuously in charge of the factory.

a very successful
career the company
was voluntarily wound
up owing to a large
proportion of the
shares being held by

Mr. Fowler was ap-

was in addition to dividends at the rate of 74 per cent,
paid during the 19 years of operation. The company

WOODSIDE PUBLIC SCHOOL
The first school in
the district was held
in a small room at-
tached to the Presby-
terian Church at In-
verbrackie, in 1849,
with Mr. Orr as first
teacher (who subse-
quently surveyed the
township of Wood-
side) . The school was
transferred to Wood-
side, and Mr. J. G.
Howard was the first
teacher. This was
about the year 1856.
About 46 years ago a
new school was built,
and plans have now
been prepared for re-
modelling the present building. In the early days a
portion of the Scriptures was read daily, but education
i nthose days was not free. It was a custom of the
District Council to pay yearly visits to the school, on
which occasions book
prizes purchased by
the Council were pre-
sented. The first Go-
vernment Inspectors
were Messrs. Dr.
Wyatt and Dewhirst.
The principal head
teachers since the time
of Mr. Howard were,
in the order named,
Messrs. J. W. Disher,
J. A. Kennedy, Webb,
J. H. Snell, E. S. Mas-
son, V. J. Mazzoral,
and the present master,
Mr. C. J. Jenner. Ad-

CHURCH OF ENGLAND
Anglican Church, Woodside.
The first Church of England in Woodside was built
in the year 1852, the minister being the Rev. John
Fulford. The parish at this time was known as Blakis-
ton and Woodside. In 1885 (at which time the parish
was known as the Mount Pleasant parish, comprising
Mount Pleasant, Mount Torrens and Woodside) the pre-
sent church was erected, the Rev. Gibbs being the minis-
ter in control. The parish is now known as the Balhannah
parish, comprising Balhannah, Woodside, and Tweed-
vale, with the Rev. F. L. Walker as minister.

CALEDONIAN CHURCH, INVERBRACKIE.
1 his church, which is now a picturesque ruin, almost
covered with ivy, is situated about one and a half miles
south of Woodside, on the road to Nairne. A stone in
the ruin hears the following inscription,: —“Caledonian
Church, 1848.’ In the year 1839 several Scotch
families settled in this beautiful fertile valley. It was
understood that a township was to have been formed
there. (This was before the township of Woodside was
surveyed; the main track from Adelaide to Reedy Creek
Mine, near Palmer, led through the valley.) A hotel
was built and named Payne’s Inn, which building is
now owned and occupied by Mr. W. Gale, the license
being concelled or refused after Woodside was sur-
veyed. It was in this inn that several Scotchmen met
and agreed to build the above church, there being no
place of worship at that time (18461 between Blakis-
ton and Gawler, except a Lutheran Church in the
German settlement of Lobethal (now Tweedvale). The
following are the names of those responsible for the
building of the church:—Dr. limes, Alex Lorimer, Jas.
Johnston, John Brackenbridge, Andrew Murdoch, John
Kelly, George Williamson, R. Wilkie, Jas. Ferguson,
R. Cock, Jas. Muir, Jas. Anderson, U. McCallum, and
A. Shannon. The first minister w-as a young married
man from Aberdeen (Scotland) named John Macbean,
M.A. In 1878, during his ministry, a Lutheran Church
in Woodside (Pastor Loessell’s) was purchased, and
named St. John’s Presbyterian Church, where services
have been continuously held to the present date. In
1884 the Rev. Macbean retired. The Rev. John
Macauley (now in charge of a church in Waverley,
Sydney), and the late Rev. B. C. Matthews subsequently
occupied the charge, the latter for 17 years. Various
ministers followed, but at present the charge is with-
out a placed minister. The present trustees are C. W.
Fowler, J. B. Hughes, R. Redpath, F. Peacock, and
J. S. Pfeiffer. In January, 1921, the manse and glebe
at Inverbrackie were sold, and with the proceeds a
new manse adjoining the church at Woodside was
erected.

A HOPE OF WOODSIDE
Extract from the report of the Government Hydraulic
Engineer re water supply for the townships of Woodside.
Oakbank, and Balhannah, dated 14/4/’26: —■
“The Bird-in-Hand Mine has recently been purchased
by the Commonwealth Government to he used as a
source of water supply for a Defence Department
Mobilisation Store and Camp, a site for which has
also been acquired. A pumping plant was installed
at the mine by the Commonwealth Works and Railway
Department, and when pumping commenced the water
level was 110 feet below 7 the surface. The water level
w 7 as reduced 10 feet, and thereafter continuous pumping
for some days at the rate of 4,000 gallons per hour
(96,000 per day) failed to low’er it further. The
Mines Department state they have no records of the
amount of water removed when the mine w 7 as working,
but that it was one of the “wettest” mines in the State.
Therefore, it appears, there is no doubt that the supply
would be sufficient for domestic purposes for the towm-
ships above referred to, in addition to the require-
ments of the Defence Department. The elevation is
probably between 100 and 150 feet, and the population
that would be served in the three towns in 1921 was /
approximately 1,500, so that 100,000 gallons per day
would provide 50 gallons per day for, say, a future
population of 2,000. The requirements of the Defence
Department would probably not exceed 100,000 gallons
per day over periods of 10 days during camp or con-
tinuous training.”
