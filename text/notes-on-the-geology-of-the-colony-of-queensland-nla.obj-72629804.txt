[Plates IX.-XXVIL]
The accompanying geological map of Queensland (PI. IX.) may be
accepted as giving the approximate areas and rough outlines of the
geological structure and rock-systems developed in that Colony, and
is appended for that purpose only. It will necessarily be open to
criticism in matters of detail; but the general features of the geologi-
cal grouping may be relied on. The section (Pig. 1) from Townsville
to the Mackinlay range shows all the geological formations in Queens-
land, north of 20� S. lat.
In a newly settled Colony the first object of the geologist is the
determination of those districts in which the best land or available
mineral wealth is to be obtained, accuracy in detail and purely
scientific investigation being deferred to an often remote future.

I collected the following data whilst prosecuting the search for
new gold-fields, on behalf of the Queensland Government, in the
northern portion of their territory, as also from the official reports of
the Geologist of Southern Queensland, and other trustworthy sources.
The consideration and history of the different formations will be
taken in their sequence of time, as far as the stratified or sedimen-
tary rocks are concerned. The igneous rocks will he described under
the various groups of Granitic, Trappean, and Volcanic.

Alluvial, containing extinct faunas.
Desert Sandstone. Cainozoic,
Cretaceous.
Oolitic. Mesozoic.
Carbonaceous. _
Carboniferous.
Devonian. Palaeozoic.
Silurian ?
Metamorphic.
Alluvial.
Fluviatile or freshwater deposits skirt all the present water-
courses ; but the accumulations are insignificant on the eastern water-
shed, except near the embouchures of large rivers, such as the
Burdekin, Fitzroy, &e.
On the shores of Carpentaria, however, and in the south-western
portions of the Colony, where the water-courses have scarcely any
fall, and where in seasons of excessive rain the country is nearly all
inundated, fluviatile deposits are very extensive.
Although the sediments redeposited as alluvia between the main
dividing range and the east coast are, as stated, comparatively
insignificant, they represent the denudation of no insignificant amount
of varied rock material, since the present physical contour of the
eastern portion of the Colony is probably due to the influence of
meteoric action, such as rain &c.
Though the dense lavas of the Upper Burdekin (volcanic outbursts
of a late Tertiary epoch) are traversed by valleys of erosion, in some
cases 200 feet deep and 5 miles broad, yet very narrow and shallow
alluvial deposits skirt the immediate margin of the water-courses
draining such valleys.
The same conditions are met with in all the more elevated table-
lands or ridges which give character to the present, physical outline
of the eastern main range.
It is only near the mouths of the larger rivers that any extent of
alluvium has been deposited; and even these areas are at the present
time in seasons of excessive rain liable to inundation, showing that
little upheaval of this portion of Australia has taken place since the
last volcanic disturbances terminated.
The meteoric or climatal conditions during this period were nearly
identical with those of the present time, heavy rains during the
summer months causing violent floods, removing seaward the aerial
decompositions and denuded materials from year to year.

What lapse of time is represented during this period of erosion is
a matter ot speculation; but it seems certain that the Mollusca of the
present creeks were also the inhabitants of the waters during the
whole period of denudation since the last volcanic eruption.
From the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north to Darling Downs in
the south, however, the fossil remains of extinct mammalia have been
found in breccias and indurated muds, which are representatives of
the beds of old water-courses through which the present creeks cut
, ale (Jrcek, in latitude 19� 30', south, good
sections of these old brecciated alluvia occur, a view of one of which
is here given (Fig. 2). The fossils from this section, as determined
Fig. 2. View of Biprotodon-breccias, Maryvale Creek, Northern
Queensland. Lat. 19� 30' S,
by Professor Owen, are Biprotodon australis, Macropus titan, Thy-
lacoleo, Fhascolomys, Nototherium, Crocodile teeth, &c.
Imbedded in the same matrix occur several genera of mollusca of
species from those inhabiting the Maryvale Creek.
My friend and late colleague, Mr. llobert Etheridge, jun., has com-
pared these with the recent forms, and finds them to consist of:?
Gasteropoda.
Melania pagoda. Melania, sp.

? subimbricata. Physa truncata.

Lamellibeancihata.
Corbicula australis, | Unio, sp.
The fact of these older alluvia forming both the bed and banks of
the present water-course (as seen also in the section delineated).


goes to prove that Diprotodon and its allies inhabited the Queensland
valleys when they presented little difference in physical aspect or
elevation from that of the present time. The crocodile (Crocodilus
australis), however, had then a greater range inland than it has now.
A study of these Diprotodon- breccias leads to the conclusion that
the remains are chiefly entombed in what were the most permanent
?water-holes? in seasons of excessive drought, and that the animals
came there in a weak and exhausted state to drink and die, just as
bullocks do under similar conditions at the present time.
No human bones, flint flakes, or any kind of native weapon have
yet been discovered with the extinct mammalia of Queensland.
Cainozoic.
Desert Sandstone. ?On the eastern branches of the Upper Flinders
river and elsewhere fine sections are exposed of lava resting on hori-
zontal beds of coarse grit and conglomerate, which lie in turn uncon-
form ably on olive-coloured and grey shales with interstratified hands
and nodules of argillaceous limestone containing fossils of Cretaceous
affinities. I have called this upper conglomerate series ? Desert Sand-
stone,? from the sandy barren character of its disintegrated soil, which
makes the term particularly applicable. Only a few rolled fragments
of coniferous wood have been found imbedded in it, proving nothing
as to its age ; and all that can be asserted is, that its horizon is above
and unconformable to the Cretaceous series of the Flinders.
Without doubt it is the most recent, widely spread stratified de-
posit developed in Queensland. The denudation of the Desert Sand-
stone since it became dry land has been excessive ; but as will be seen
by the geological map (PI. IX.), there still remains a large tract in
situ, whilst outliers and isolated ridges are to be met with in the most
unexpected localities. A view of a cliff section of Desert Sandstone,
with outlier, is represented in the accompanying woodcut (Fig. 3).
All the available evidence tends to show that this ? Desert Sand-
stone ? did at one time cover nearly, if not quite, the -whole of Aus-
tralia, with the probable exception of the south-eastern corner of the
continent from the Cordillera to the ocean. The journals of the two
Messrs. Gregory in their expedition on the north-west and north,
and Goyder?s description of the new settlement of Port Darwin, all
boar evidence to the continuity of this so-called ?Desert Sandstone?
over all the extended areas investigated by them, where denudation
has been resisted by local peculiarity of structure or other special
causes. Frank Gregory, in his description of the geological pecu-
liarities of that portion of the Xichol Bay country that came under
his observation during his exploring expedition of 1861, observes that
?it consists of a series of terraces rising inland for nearly 200 miles,
more or less broken up by volcanic hills toivards the coast.
?The first belt averages from 10 to 40 miles in width from the
sea, and is a nearly level plain slightly ascending to the southward
with an elevation of from 40 to 100 feet, the soil being generally
either light loam or strong clay, according as it is the result of the


granite rocks that occasionally protrude above its surface, or of
volcanic rocks of black scoria that frequently interrupt the general
level.
? Proceeding inland for the next 50 or 60 miles is a granite
country that has been originally capped with horizontal sandstones y

and has an elevation of about 1000 feet; this range terminates to the
southward in level plains of good soil, the produce of the next series
of more elevated country; whilst towards the northern edges the
granite and sandstones have undergone great changes, through the
action of numerous trap-dykes, that have greatly disturbed the sur-
face, producing metamorphic rocks, some resembling jasper, and
others highly cellular and scoriaceous.?
In about latitude 22� on the meridian of Nichol Bay he eame upon
another and more elevated range trending away to the S.E., having
an altitude of 2500 feet above the sea.
This, unlike the last section, has a southern escarpment of 500 or
600 feet, and an average breadth of 8 or 10 miles; it consists of
horizontal sandstones and conglomerates, which have undergone com-
paratively little change.
Augustus Gregory?s description of the sandstones of the Victoria
river, as illustrated by the accompanying section (Fig. 4), agrees
with those of the ?Desert Sandstone? of Queensland, the speci-


mens from either locality being undistinguishable the one from the
other; while the same barren sandy soil, the same hostile Spinifex,

the same fatal poison-plant, mark its presence from Perth to Cape
York.
In Queensland the Upper beds are ferruginous, white and mottled
sandy clays, the lower being coarse alternating grits and conglome-
rates ; the extreme observed thickness has not exceeded 400 feet.
Eig. s. ?Section of ? Desert Sandstone,? Betts Creek, Northern
Queensland.
A characteristic view of the Upper Desert Sandstone beds is shown
in Betts Creek (Eig. 5).
Whether these are marine, lacustrine, or estuarine deposits there is
hardly sufficient evidence to show, the enclosed drift wood, as before
observed, giving no clue.


A single shell ( Tellina) found in a bed of horizontal limestone at
the head of the Gregory on the Darkly Tableland and forwarded to
me by the Rev, W. D. Clarke, of Sydney, would, if belonging to this
series, as it probably does, give reason to believe that the lacustrine
condition may be eliminated.
What may be the value of this Desert Sandstone for free gold is at
present unsolved; but the very nature of its deposition seems to
preclude the idea that that metal will be found in paying quanti-
ties, except "where direct local abrasion of a rich auriferous veinstone
has furnished the supply.
It is indeed doubtful if any marine or extensive lacustrine beds,
except on their shingle margins, have produced, or are ever likely to
produce, remunerative workings of free gold, for the simple reason
that the majority of the sediments of which they are composed are
derived from formations the greater part of which were non-auriferous.
Mesozoic.
Cretaceous. ?As early as 1866 a suite of fossils was collected by
Messrs, Sutherland and Carson (of Marathon Station) on the Flinders
river, and forwarded for determination to Professor M?Coy in Mel-
bourne. They were never figured ; but his manuscript names are as
follows:
Reptilia.
Ichthyosaurus australis, M?Coy.
Plesiosaurus Sutherland!, M?Coy (allied to that from New Zealand, described
by Professor Owen).
Plesiosaurus macrospondylus, M?Coy.
Cephalopoda.
Ammonites Sutherland!, M'Coy (resembling A. Barandieri, of the Gault of
France).
Ammonites Flindersi, M?Coy (resembling A. Beudanti, Br., of the Lower
Chalk of France).
Belemnitella diptycha, M l Goy (resembling B. plena, of the Lower Cretaceous
beds of England).
Ancyloceras Flindersi, M?Coy (equalling A. gig as, of the Lower Greensand in
size, but more nearly resembling in structure the A. Faborelli of the Lower
Greensand of France).
Lamellibranchiata.
Inoceramus Carsoni, M?Coy (resembling the I. mytiloides, Sow., of the Chalk
of England).
Inoceramus Sutherland!, M l Coy (identical with the English species I. Cuvieri).
One locality being assigned to all the fossils alluded to in the
above notice, it was evident to me that either fossils from different
localities had been mixed together, or derived specimens had been
mingled with those obtained in situ, and no satisfactory conclusion
or inference could be drawn for purposes of correlation with Euro-
pean, Asiatic, American, or African forms. In company with Mr.
Sutherland, who supplied M?Coy with the before-mentioned ma-
terials, I therefore visited the Upper Flinders, and carefully col-
lected the fossils from three localities, viz. Marathon Station, Hugh-
enden Station, and Ifughenden Cattle Station.


At Marathon, which is some forty miles further down the
Flinders than Hughenden, there is, close to the homestead, an out-
crop of fine-grained yellow sandstone, which has been quarried for
building-purposes; and below this, to the edge of a water-hole sup-
plying the house, is a series of sandstones and argillaceous lime-
stones, containing numerous organic remains.
These I have submitted to Mr. Etheridge for examination and
correlation, the result of which will appear in the Appendix to my
paper; I, however, attach here a summary of the forms determined
by him from this locality.
Marathon.

pernoides, Eth. PI. XXII. fig. 3.
multiplicatus, Stol., var. elongatus, Eth. PI. XXII. fig. 2.
Erom these beds also came M?Coy?s Reptilia.
The ? Marathon beds,? as they may be designated, are undulating,
with an uncertain dip. Proceeding from ? Marathon ?up the Flin-
ders river (most probably over a series of older beds), no cliff-sections
arc met with ; but at Stewart?s wash-pool, on the main road, the Avi-
cula hughendensis, Eth., of Hughenden is found in abundance.
At Robert Grey?s Hughenden Station, however, which lies about
three miles east of Mount Walker, a series of calcareo-argillaceous

beds crop out, containing a marked and well-preserved fauna, indi-
cating no great difference in facies from those of Marathon.

but the latter indicates their gentle dip towards the north-east, and
therefore places the Hughenden beds below those of Marathon.
The observations collected on the journey between these two
places give the same result.
The palaeontological evidence is not sufficient to enable Mr.
Etheridge to draw any great line of demarcation.
His determination of the species from the Hughenden beds is as
follows:?
Ammonites Beudanti, Z>?Orb.,v ar. Avicula hughendensis, Eth.
Mitchellii, Eth. Pecten &c.
Daintreei, Eth.
These were obtained from horizontal calcareo-argillaceous beds,
fronting the water-hole, where the sheep-wash is placed, about half
a mile from the Hughenden Station,

Bclemnites are strewn over the surface of the two ridges which
front the Cattle-station huts, but they are rarely found in the soft
shales which crop out from under an escarpment of ? Desert Sand-
stone.?
The lithological character of these Cretaceous strata is such that
decomposition is rapid; and cliff-sections are accordingly very rare,
the resulting physical aspect being that of vast plains, which form
the principal feature of Queensland scenery west of the main
dividing range; but that the ? Desert Sandstone ? has extended
over all this country is evidenced by its existence either in the form
of outliers, or as a marked feature in situ on all main watersheds,
or by its pebbles of quartz and conglomerate, which are strewn
everywhere over the surface of the plains. The appearance of these
vast plains is shown in Fig. 8.
The height of the watershed between the Thompson and Flinders
rivers is locally not more than 1400 feet above sea-level; and as

the former river has to travel as many miles before reaching the
sea, it is easy to understand why, in a country subject to heavy
tropical rains at one period of the year followed by a long dry
season, the river-channels are ill-defined, and vast tracts of country
covered by alluvial deposits.
Down the Thompson and its tributaries these Mesozoic rocks arc
known to extend, though much obscured by flood-drifts. The first
to draw attention to the fact was the Ilev. W. B. Clarke, F.G.S., of
Sydney, who in the year 1867 received a suite of fossils from Wol-
lurabilla Creek and the surrounding district, which he described in

Quart. Journ. Geol, Soc. vol. xxiii. p. 7, suggesting that they were
? Rhsetic.?
A thorough examination of these by Charles Moore, Esq,, E.G.S.,
the results of which were detailed in Quart. Journ, Geol. Soc., vol.
xxvi., led him to the conclusion that the Wollumbilla beds have their
nearest representatives in the Oxford Clay, But it is possible that
fossils from different localities, or perhaps drift specimens, have been
mixed up, as he says ?it is not easy to decide with certainty as to
the exact position of the fossils that come from Wollumbilla. The
Lias, the Great Oolite, the Oxford Clay, the Portland Oolite, and
the Cretaceous beds may each put in a claim; but that of the Oxford
Clay appears to be the strongest.?
The Bungeworgari and Amby river-beds are considered by Moore
to be Cretaceous. This much then can be asserted, that all the
great plains of Queensland westward of the main coast-range con-
sist of subaerially decomposed Oolitic and Cretaceous shales, lime-
stones, and sandstones, or the river-detritus of such, redeposited on
their surface.
That this portion of the Mesozoic system extends throughout the
whole of Central Queensland to Western Australia is also more than
probable, hidden, however, over large areas by ? Desert Sandstone.?
The finding, by Stuart, of a Cytherea ? (first mentioned by Clarke)
on the Gregory river, a few miles north of Einnis Springs, and the
extent of marly plains similar in character to those on the Flinders,
the well-known occurrence of Cretaceous fossils in the Moresby
ranges, and of Oolitic in other parts of Western Australia, favour
this idea. We may look forward to the clearing-up of this point
when the collections of the South Australian Telegraph party are
described.
The only variety in the lithological character of the Flinders- and
Thompson-river Mesozoic rocks, is the change from shale to fine-
grained sandstone in the alternating beds, the shale greatly pre-
dominating ; its line of bedding marked by thin bands and nodular
layers of argillaceous limestone.
One other peculiarity in the strata forming the series is the pre-
sence at intervals of thin layers of limestone having the well-known
cone-in-cone structure.
This has more the appearance of a chemical precipitate than a
mechanical deposit, and contains no fossils. Its analysis gave:?
Cone-in-cone Limestone.
100*000
How far the Flinders and Thompson scries have extended over
the dividing ranges is not yet thoroughly determined.
On Pelican Creek, a tributary of Bowen river, near an out-station


hut of Mr. M e Dougal, a small patch of ferruginous grit caps a single
hill-top ;' and in it numerous specimens of Panopcea plicata are found
imbedded.
From Gordon Downs, at the head of lloper Creek, the Rev. W.
33. Clarke has forwarded me a suite of specimens, which, on Mr.
Etheridge?s authority, may be referred to the same horizon as the
Pelican-Creek beds.
They consist of the following genera :
Panopasa. Cuculla^a.
Pholadomya. Homomya*.
Tancredia. Pleurotomaria
Considering these Pelican-Creek and Gordon-Downs strata the
representatives of a lower horizon in the Mesozoic series than those
of the Flinders river, the direct representatives of the Flinders
rocks have as yet been unrecognized to the east of the dividing
range. A very large portion of Queensland, however, as far north
as 20� S. latitude, between the dividing range and the eastern sea-
board, is covered with a series of beds, chiefly freshwater, contain-
ing abundance of plant-remains, in the upper portion of which a
few beds only contain a fauna which seems, on palaeontological evi-
dence, to occupy a position between the Gordon-Downs and Flinders-
river series.
These beds crop out at the township of Maryborough, and have
been used by the Corporation of that thriving place as quarries for
road-metal. The contained shells have been named and arranged
by Mr. Etheridge as follows: ?
Cyprina expansa, Eth. PI. XIX. fig. 1.
Trigonia nasuta, Eth. PI. XIX. fig. 2.
Cuculkea robusta, Eth . PI. XX. fig. 1.
costata, Eth. PI. XX. fig. 2.

Natica lineata, Eth. PI. XXI. fig. 1.
Pulvinites ? PI. XIX. fig. 3.
Cardium? PI. XIX. fig. 4.
Dp to the present time, within all the area marked on the map
as occupied by Carbonaceous Mesozoic strata, only the Maryborough
beds have yielded fossil remains other than plants. On tributaries
of the Condamine, Brisbane, and Mary rivers, where numerous
coal-seams are known to exist, several of which have been and are
now being worked, these plant-remains are of the same character.
A collection from two localities has been examined and named bv
W. Carruthers, Esq., F. 11.5., F.G.S. A suite from the Tivoli coal-
mine he finds to consist of: ?

The Burrum coal-seams, worked for some time on a branch of
the Mary river, lie below the Maryborough Cypri na-sahdstones;
and their relation to the Wollumbilla- and Gordon-Downs series has
yet to he unravelled.
The idea which seems to offer the greatest amount of feasibility
is, that contemporaneous with the deposit of a succession of marine
hods to the westward of the dividing range, at a period in time ex-
tending through the Oolitic and part of the Cretaceous period, a vast
lacustrine deposit was accumulated over a large area to the east-
ward of the same range, to which the sea obtained access after a
very considerable thickness of freshwater beds had been piled up.
Beds of coal are a marked feature in these Mesozoic lacustrine
beds, whilst their supposed marine equivalents to the westward are,
as far as wo have any observations on the subject, entirely devoid
of that valuable mineral.
The appearance of these lacustrine coal-measures differs in a very
marked manner from their supposed marine representatives to the
westward. Coarse grits and thick-bedded sandstones form the ma-
jority of the strata, though shales, mudstones, and limestones are
interstratified throughout the system.
The physical difference is even more marked; level plains desti-
tute of timber characterize the one, whilst broken ridges, covered
in great measure with dense scrub and fine timber, are the atten-
dant features of the other.
It is of great importance to the future of the colony to ascertain
if the carbonaceous division of the Mesozoic formation is represented
in any portion of the western plains between Wollumbilla and the
Upper Blinders. If so, the coal-fields of Queensland would, indeed,
he inexhaustible, and a stimulus might thus be given to the con-
struction of that natural trunk-line of railway for Eastern Australia
(first suggested by the Hon. J, Grant, late Minister of Lands in
Victoria), from the Murray to the Gulf of Carpentaria, The neces-
sity for this will become the more apparent when the rich gold-
fields and mineral lodes of Northern Queensland are somewhat more
developed, and when these western plains, the richest pasture in
Australia, are fully stocked with cattle.
It is hoped that the determination of groups of fossils from the
localities here mentioned may form bench-marks, so to speak, for
future observers who may work this practically interesting subject
to a more definite conclusion; and the leading minds and students
of physical science in the colony look with anxiety to the parent
societies of England to aid them in their attempts to decipher the
structure and past history of this great area, whose yet unrecorded
facts must yield only to patient labour.
Mineral Springs. ?There is one other subject of practical interest
connected with the great western Mesozoic plains ; and that is the
occurrence of hot alkaline springs, which suggest the possibility of
obtaining supplies of water on the Artesian principle over some por-
tion at least of this area.

and its overflow deposits a white incrustation, which on analysis by
Dr. Flight, under the direction of Professor Maskelync, afforded:

The sulphuric acid, of which there was a small portion, was un-
determined.
Apart, therefore, from the 5-552 per cent, of chloride of sodium,
the deposit consists of sesquicarbonate of soda, or native ? Trona,?
and as such it is used by the settlers for culinary purposes, &c.
The importance of this evidence as to the probability of finding
Artesian supplies of water in districts where such springs arc met
with, should not be lost sight of ; and a bore put down in the vici-
nity of one of them (for this is not the only one) might, if successful
in obtaining water, lead to most important practical results.
Palaeozoic.
Carboniferous. ?Whilst the affinities of the southern coal-field of
Queensland are Mesozoic, a northern field, of even larger extent, has
a distinct fauna more resembling the Palaeozoic Carboniferous of
Europe.
In the upper portion of the series the organic remains are chiefly
confined to plants, the most abundant of which is Olossopteris, im-
bedded with less numerous specimens of Pecopteris, Sphenopteris, Ac.
In the lower strata, Producti, Spiriferce, &c., of true Carboniferous
age, are found associated with the above flora, though the plants arc
very sparingly represented, and in very imperfect forms.
The Dawson, Comet, M?Kenzie, Isaacs and Bowen rivers drain
this Carboniferous area; and numerous outcrops of coal have been
observed on these streams. No commercial use, however, has yet
been made of any of them, as the measures generally are too far
inland to be made available until the railway-system of the country
is extended in that direction.
Messrs. E. Etheridge, F.E.S., and W. Carruthers, F.E.S., have
examined and named, the one the mollusca &c., the other the plants,
from different localities over this large area.
The former describes, from Cracow Creek on the Dawson river:?

From the head of the Don River a suite of fossils has been for-
warded by Rev. W. B. Clarke, whom we also have to thank for the
specimens from the Nogoa and Dawson rivers.
These are said to overlie the auriferous series there, and consist of: ?

The whole of these forms agree with those found in the Hunter-
river series of Hew South Wales, which there, as in Queensland,
are found at the base of the great Palaeozoic coal-group of that
Colony.
A sketch section of the lowest observed coal-seams, with several
hundred feet of Productus beds resting on them, is here given (Fig. 9).
This section is observed about half a mile up a creek which joins
the Bowen river one mile below the ford at the road crossing from

sion of the trap range which forms the source of the creek. At the
junction of the creek, however, the dip is very slight, although the
beds are quite conformable. The marine beds are generally argilla-
ceous limestones, often very ferruginous; whilst the upper beds are
coarse grits and sandstones with interstratified shales. In these the
impressions of Glossopteris are very common and sometimes beauti-
fully preserved; but I have never been able to find the fauna and
flora unmistakably represented in the same bed.

marine beds are seen to rest directly on a coal-seam was at Pelican
Creek, a tributary of the Bowen river, a view of which is here given
(Fig. 10). At the base of this cliff a seam of coal about four feet
thick crops out the entire length of the section. Directly upon this
rests a coarse-grained sandstone, with a few imperfect easts of shells,
while at the top of the cliff an arenaceous limestone band holds
abundant specimens of the Streptorhynchus crenistria, so common
throughout all the lower marine series.
No plant-remains could be detected in the section ; but (as will be
observed in the view) the dip is very slight down the creek;
and in the next cliff, on the downward course of the stream, we have
a section of the measures of nearly the same dimensions, with shale
and sandstone interstratified, in which very perfect impressions of
Glossopteris were found.
In fact, throughout Australia, as far as observation has yctextended,
Glossopteris is confined to the older coal-measures, of which the
Producti and Spiriferae above described are the marine representa-
tives. In Tasmania, New South Wales, and Queensland, at least,
this holds good ; and where Glossopteris occurs, the associated marine
fauna is always of Palaeozoic type.
In the Taeniopteris coal-measures of Victoria, Richmond River, New
South Wales, and the Southern coal-field of Queensland no Glosso-
pteris has yet been found, and the Productus- and Spirifera-heda are
also absent. It would seem therefore that, apart from the presence
of a distinguishing fauna, Taeniopteris may be taken as evidence of
the Mesozoic, and Glossopteris of the Palaeozoic coal-formations of
Australia.
Devonian. ?From the southern boundary of Queensland up to
latitude 18� south, a series of slates, sandstones, coral-limestones,
and conglomerates extend to a distance of 200 miles inland; these
are sometimes overlain by coal-measures, sometimes by volcanic
rocks, and consequently do not crop out on the surface over such
districts. Their average dip and general character are shown in
Fig. 11.
Isolated granitic and metamorphic areas also occur in the same
belt of country; these either were islands in the ocean whose accu-
mulated sediments they represent, or have been laid bare by subse-
quent denudation or intrusion.
North of latitude 18� south, however, over the Cape York Penin-
sula, this series (so far as we have any evidence) is absent, granites
and porphyries capped by ? Desert Sandstone ? forming the ranges
on the eastern, and their abraded ingredients, the sandy tea-tree
fiats, those on the western side of that inhospitable tract of country.
Lithologically this very extensive development of Palaeozoic rocks
agrees with the ? Devonian ? system of England; and the palaeonto-
logical evidence is confirmatory of the same idea. In the higher
members of this group, which, from their general analogy to the
English group of that name, we will term Devonian, specimens of
fossil plants are abundantly met with.
W. Carruthers, Esq., F.R.S., has described and named those from

Broken llivcr, and refers them all to one form, Leptophloeum rhom-
bicum, previously described by Dawson as occurring in the Upper
Devonian scries of Canada.
At Mount Wyatt the plant-beds are interstratified with strata
containing Spirifers &c.; and as these are fully described in the

hampton. (On the left is a dyke of dolcritc traversing the

required here.
From various shafts sunk through the ? Devonian ? rocks of the
Gympie mining-district, a well-preserved fauna has been collected.

At the Lucky-Yalley diggings and at Apis Creek, near the Apis
Creek homestead, peculiar casts of encrinital stems, probably belong-
ing to the genus Actinocripus, occur in a lydianized slate. The strike


of this bed is in both places about north 30� west, which line would
connect the two outcrops, although nearly 300 miles apart.
In the limestone bands which form the lower portion of the series
(shown in Fig. 12), corals are very numerous ; in fact the limestones,

where little alteration has taken place, are a mass of aggregated
corals; and as this class of rock has resisted aerial destruction
better than the associated slates and sandstones, the barriers thus
formed mark the trend of the rock-system to which they belong, in
a very picturesque and decided manner; their bold, massive and
varied outline chiselled into the most delicate fretwork by nature?s
hand, is relieved by a wealth of richly tinted foliage, unknown in
the surrounding bush; and the eye jaded with the monotony of the
? eternal Gum-tree ? turns with delight to the changing tints and
varied scenery presented by these barrier-like records of the past
(Fig. 13). . ?
On the Broken River, a tributary of the Clarke, in Northern
Queensland, the entire Devonian system, as developed in Queensland,
could be easily and satisfactorily mapped. The branches of this
river cut right across the strike, and the bare edges of the rocks are
often exposed over the intervening ridges from creek to creek. Well-
marked beds of interstratified conglomerates seem to retain their
character over large areas; and the loose pebbles from these can be
followed readily over the ridges, whilst the rocks from which these
pebbles are derived crop out in the gullies and ravines.
As a large proportion of them are of quartz, the ridges covered by
them are often mistaken by miners for indications of a-?deep lead?


or old river-course. Though of course this is an error soon discovered,
I have been informed that they have often found gold under such

conditions; if so, it would be a very valuable addition to our know-
ledge of the earliest period at which auriferous quartz veins were
formed.
On the track from the Broken Eiver to the Gilbert Diggings,
Devonian rocks several thousand feet thick may be observed, as they
are continuous in dip, without being repeated, for at least five miles
across the strike, with an average inclination of 60�.
Although on the Broken Eiver and its tributaries a breadth of
thirty miles, with a length of sixty miles, is occupied by a persistent
outcrop of Devonian strata, gold has only been discovered in remu-
nerative quantities in a small gully, heading from a leading ridge,
where a trap dyke has penetrated the Palaeozoic rocks of the district.
The following districts, however, where Devonian rocks prevail,
have been centres of gold-mining enterprise :
Morinish.
Eosewood.
Lucky Yalley.
Talgai.
Mount Wyatt.
Broken Eiver.
Gympie.
Calliope.
Boyne.
Portion of Gilbert.
In every case here cited the country is traversed by trap-rocks of
a peculiar character, either diorite, diabase, or porphyrite ; and tufa-
ceous representatives of these are also found interstratified in the


upper portion of the same formation, and occasionally throughout
the other beds.
At Gympie, one of the richest quartz-reefing districts in the colony,
the auriferous area is confined to veins traversing a crystalline diorite,
or within a certain limit of its boundary* marked by the presence of
fossiliferous diabase tufas.
Of the crystalline rock at Gympie Mr. Aplin, who reported on the
district, gives the following description:?
? In irregular-shaped masses or broad dykes this rock occurs at
intervals over a large portion of the area of this gold-field, but is
most prominently developed within a zone half a mile or more in
width, having a longitudinal direction of about N. 60� W., and
embracing the space from the ? Lady Mary ? hill to that on which the
Gympie township commences.
? It is in the decomposed upper portions of this rock, which
weathers brown and argillaceous, though retaining its compactness,
that the quartz veins traversing it are found to be so highly pro-
ductive.
? In its ordinary condition it is excessively hard, and is the most
formidable obstacle the miners have to contend with, some from
the very surface, and others at varying but comparatively shallow
depths.?
Of the lode-stones outside a certain limit from this crystalline rock
he says : ?? The quartz-veins associated with the slates or other sedi-
mentary rocks not connected with , or affected by, the greenstone have
hitherto been found not to contain gold in paying quantity.?
Mr. Hacket, who devoted a much longer time to the survey of the
Gympie gold-field, confirms Mr. Apliu?s opinion on the latter point,
as he says in his report;?
? Skirting the greenstone-belt on both sides is a series of siliceous
slates and quartzites, highly metamorphosed, and in many cases
jasperized, banded, and cleaved.
?In this latter formation no gold has yet been found, although
many reefs have been explored.?
Mr, Hacket, however, seems to have thought that the crystalline
rocks were interstratified with the slates Ac.
My own impression, formed from two short visits to this locality,
was that the crystalline rock was in all cases intrusive, whilst the
so-called ? fossiliferous greenstone ? was a tufaceous deposit, partly
contemporaneous with, partly the result of the denudation of the
crystalline rock which represented the core or cores of Devonian
trap-vents.
The analysis of the two varieties of rock above mentioned, viz.
the so-called Gympie ? greenstone ? and the ? fossiliferous green-
stone,? gave the following results :? ?

Mr. Allport, of Birmingham, has examined sections of these ana-
lyzed rocks under the microscope, and thus describes them :
Of the crystalline rock he says :
? This is a diorite, containing hornblende, triclinic felspar, ortho-
clase, a little brown mica (biotite) and pyrites.
? Many of the minerals are imperfectly crystallized.
? The crystals of felspar showing bands of colour or striae, when


examined in polarized light, are of course triclinic, whilst those of
one colour are probably orthoclase. There are some twins showing
two colours sharply divided by the line of junction of the two
halves ; and these are certainly orthoclase,
? The secondary products are a little chlorite, and two or three
blebs of quartz, filling spaces between the crystals,
? The rock is not much altered.?
Of the fossiliferous tufa he says: ?-
? It is a fragmentary rock, and has undergone so much alteration
that the constituents cannot be well identified. There are, however,
some grains of augite and magnetite. The fragments are imbedded
in a chloritic base, which is itself a product of alteration.?
Of another specimen of the same character from the West-coast
lieef, Gympie, he remarks :
? This is a characteristic trappean ash or breccia; it consists of
numerous fragments of rather fine-grained trap-rocks, broken crystals
of felspar and augite, many black grains of magnetite, and fragments
of other rocks, the whole forming a compact mass in which there
is now much chlorite.?
The analysis of the crystalline rock indicates no very determinate
results, but suggests the presence of two felspars and two varieties
of hornblende, with a little chlorite, carbonate of lime, and pyrites.
The insoluble portion may be a mixture ofiperthite and an insoluble
aluminous hornblende, whilst the soluble portion indicates a mixture
of oligoclase, an iron and magnesian hornblende, like pargasite, and
a smaller proportion of a chloritic mineral, as indicated by the water
of constitution.
The absence of augite in its composition would, notwithstanding
the presence of the products of decomposition, chlorite and carbonate
of lime, place it among the diorites. The so-called fossiliferous
greenstone, however, would perhaps be most correctly called a
? diabase tufa,? as shown both by analysis and microscopic ex-
amination.
Whatever may be the proper technical term for the class of rock
of which the Gympie crystalline diorite is a typical example, the fact
remains that throughout the whole extent of the great Devonian area
of Queensland no portion has yet been found to include auriferous
veinstones which will pay to work, where trappean disturbance ot
this character is not present.
At the Boyne the Devonian slates are cut at various angles by
dykes of hard crystalline diorite; and for the most part the auriferous
quartz-veins are found at the absolute intersection of the two. The
very intelligent manager of the Boyne Company?s leased ground had
found this fact verified in all the mining operations conducted
there.
At Calliope intersecting dykes of serpentine, or diorite, are the
surest guides to the richest vein-stones, the Devonian slates and lime-
stones being the rocks intersected.
At Crocodile, Blackfellows, and Morinish diggings, in the Rock-
hampton district, the conditions are analogous to those of the Boyne,

In considering the mode in which the gold was introduced into
these veins, this constant association of silver is the chief difficulty
to contend with. It is evident that the solvent and precipitant must
have been able to perform their functions on each simultaneously.
All experiments based on the precipitation of gold alone from its
solutions afford no clue to the action which has taken place in nature,
where the gold, silver, and other alloyed metals are entirely homo-
geneous.
No case has yet been established in our museums where the gold
and silver are separated in the same specimen, as is seen in speci-
mens of native copper and silver from Lake Superior.
In several reefing-districts in Queensland, however, we have con-

ditions that should lead to such a result by after-reduction of the
silver salt.
A specimen from the ?Last Chance? reef in the Ncw-Zcaland
Gully, near llockhampton, shows specks of metallic gold dissemi-
nated through a mass of chloride of silver. It has not yet been
examined to see if any portion of gold may be in a form soluble in
hyposulphite of soda.
From 7 tons of the vein-stuff of the ?Last Chance? 240 ounces
of gold were washed. The harder portion, which would not ? puddle
down ? when crushed and amalgamated, yielded a bar of metal very
pale in colour, and with a much higher percentage of silver than the
washed-out gold from the same reef.
This was due to the abundance of ? poison-stone,? as the owners
called the horn silver, which remained among the harder portion of
the reef sent to the stampers.
Though this and other cases of a similar bearing would suggest
that both gold and silver were originally in solution as chlorides (the
latter by the solvent power of an alkaline chloride), yet the difficulty
of precipitating the two metals together from such a solution has yet
to be overcome. The more constant association of native gold with
pyrites w T ould also draw our attention in another direction.
A series of experiments now in hand may throw some light on this
complicated question; and when completed they will form the ma-
terial for a further communication to this Society.
Whatever may have been the solvent and precipitant of the nobler
metals in the auriferous vein-stones associated w r ith trap-intrusions,
all other but hydrothermal action may safely be eliminated, the very
nature of the reefs, composed as they arc of alternating layers or of
a promiscuous mixture of quartz, calc-spar, pyrites, &c., affording
unmistakable evidence on this point. The gold also contained in
the trap-dykes themselves is always accompanied by pyrites?both,
in my opinion, hydrothermal products separating out during the
cooling down of the trap-intrusions.
Auriferous lodes, occurring in areas where hydrothermal action
has attended trap-disturbances of a special character in Queensland,
arc generally thin?to be estimated by inches rather than by feet;
but, taken as a whole, they are far richer in gold than those enclosed
by sedimentary rocks.
The yield of the principal Gympie reefs for the year 1869 was
11,996 tons of quartz for 76,870 ounces of gold, being an average of
6 ounces, 8 dwts., 4 grains per ton, the highest return of perhaps
any gold-field in the world. The cost of mining such reefs, how-
ever, is much greater than where the vein-stones arc better defined
and of a good average thickness throughout.
The following Table, showing the thickness and yield of most of
the reefs in the llockhampton district, affords a fair representation
of the character, thickness, and general conditions of the auriferous
lodes found in the other mining- districts included within Palaeozoic
areas.

generally confined to pyritous diorite or diabase, whoso percentage
of silica rarely exceeds one half of their total constituents, another
typical intrusive rock appears to perform similar functions in the
more siliceous rocks of metamorphic districts, such as those of the
Cape River.
Sometimes this partakes of the character of felspar porphyry, and
sometimes of a porphyrite.
It is at the intersection of these acid-felspathic dykes with the
mica- and hornblende-schists, and in areas within the influence of
the said intrusions, that several of the auriferous veins round Mount
Remarkable, Mount Davenport, and Mount Elvan, in the Cape-
River Mining-district, are found.
What the age of these metamorphic rocks relatively to the Devo-
nian system may be is uncertain, though it is probable that they may
represent the Lower Silurian series of Victoria, or the still older
metamorphic system of that colony.
The richest copper lodes yet opened in Queensland, viz. ? The
Peak Downs ? and ? Mount Perry,? lie within such areas. Neither
of these seems to be in any way in contact with igneous dykes, but
to be true lodes. The former of them had, up to the 30th June,
1870, smelted 29,168 tons of ore for a yield of 5839 tons refined
copper, and had been proved, at the time of our visit at the end
of that year, to extend at the 40-fathom level 1500 feet in an east
and west strike, with an average width of 2 feet. The Mount
Perry, lately opened, with very favourable prospects, is bounded by
granite of metamorphic origin, very similar in character to that ot
Ravenswood.
In this last-mentioned gold-mining 'district nearly 200 distinct
reefs are now being actively worked, the yield, from 2120 tons of
the quartz first crushed from various claims, having been 5682 oz.
of smelted gold, or at the rate of 2 oz. 14 dwts. per ton*.
There is no evidence of trappean action influencing the produc-
tion of the veins at Ravenswood; or if there be, it is deep-seated;
and there is, therefore, this practical difference to be borne in mind
when considering the mode of occurrence of metallic minerals in
Queensland, viz. that in the fossiliferous palaeozoic equivalent of the
Devonian no case has yet been observed free from trappean dis-
turbance where paying quantities of metallic ore or metal have been
found, whilst in the metamorphic areas this has not been shown to
be an absolute necessity. That the stanniferous granites of the
Severn river, which are now yielding such marvellous quantities of
tin ore, are of metamorphic origin, seems clear from the description con-
tained in a private letter just received by me from Mr. Aplin, lately
the Government Geologist for Southern Queensland, who says?
? The rock is a loosely aggregated, coarse-grained, highly mica-
ceous granite, abounding in thin threads and veins of quartz. It
seemed to me to be metamorphic, and was not in large bosses and
broad sheets, but in numerously jointed beds.
* The total yield for 1871 from this gold-field, just received, gives 00,414 oz
of gold.


? The tin crystals arc principally associated with the quartz in
the most highly micaceous portions.?
And, speaking of the alluvial drifts from these stanniferous
granites, he adds:?
? Their richness and continuousness is extraordinary, and, I should
think, quite unparalleled in any other country .?
In the metamorphie system, indeed, is the most varied development
of metallic ores in Queensland; in it also the greatest number of
? true lodes ? have been found; and this fact affords the best reason
for the supposition that the comparatively unexplored districts at
the beads of the Mitchell and in the McKinlay ranges, where large
tracts of metamorphie rocks are known to exist, will yet add very
much to the mineral exports of Queensland when thoroughly pros-
pected. Prom the exploring expedition about to start into the
former of these districts great results may be expected.
Granitic.
Outcrops of granite extend along the eastern coast of Queensland
from Cape York nearly up to Broadsound, and inland as far as the
heads of streams running direct from the inner coast range to the sea.
Isolated patches of the same character of rock are found at
intervals from the seaboard back to the coast range, going south
from Broadsand.
Yery little rock of this character is met with west and south of
the dividing range which separates rivers flowing to the eastern
and northern coast and those trending south to the Murray or
Coopers? Creek.
In their lithological character, the granites of Queensland vary
very much in their crystalline texture and arrangement of minerals
in the same rock-masses, passing from true granites into porphyry
and quartz-porphyry; but the monoclinic felspar is always in
excess of the triclinic.
With the exception of molybden-glance, found in the porphyry
near Townsville, no metallic ores are associated with the granites
proper.
Trappean.
In a previous portion of this paper much stress has been laid on
the value of certain intrusive Trap-rocks as specially influencing the
production of auriferous veinstones in Queensland; and it is now
proposed to investigate this subject somewhat more in detail.
The petrology of these may bo divided into four type classes :
1. Pyritous porphyrites and porphyries.
2. Pyritous diorites and diabases.
3. Chrome-iron serpentines.
4, Pyritous felsites.
Group 1.
The analysis of a characteristic specimen of a porphyrite of Group 1
(PI. XI. fig. 2) gave the following results :

Mr. Allport?s description of this, from a microscopic examination.
was : ?? That it was an altered porphyrite, with pseudomorphs after
felspar, in a granular felsitic base, and contained minute grains of
magnetite, and also a little chlorite.? The specimen analyzed did
not contain pyrites, but was slightly tinged with carbonate of copper
in the mass, a portion not so stained being selected for the deter-
mination of the ingredients.
Hocks of this type, associated with auriferous veins, are developed
in the Black Snake ? reefing districts,? on the flanks of the Berserker
Range (PI. XI. fig. 3), in Xew-Zcaland Gully, and in other mining-
areas near Rockhampton, also within the auriferous radius around
Mount Wyatt.
Group 2.
Pyritous Diorite and Diabase.
In the chapter on the Palaeozoic rocks, correlated with the Devo-
nian of Europe, the analysis of a type specimen of the Gympie crys-
talline Diorite is given. That of a diabase tufa, containing organic
remains, which forms an interstratified portion of the Devonian
series, the one probably representing the core, the other the ejecta,
of a Devonian volcano is also given.
As this group, however, is widely distributed along the eastern por-
tions of Queensland, and seems so important an indicator of auriferous
wealth, the analysis of another specimen (PI. X. fig. 3) taken from near
the junction of Granite and Twenty-mile Creek, in the Gilbert district.
is here given.

Of this Mr. Allport says :
? It contains a fibrous green mineral, which appears to be horn-
blende, partially altered ; the felspar is very opaque and indistinct
in form.
? The base contains much chlorite and a few blebs of quartz,
together with a little epidote,
?The rock is highly altered; and if the green fibrous mineral
should turn out to be uralite, it might then be, called a diabase.?
All the rocks of this group, indeed, are much altered, generally in
the direction of serpentine; their specific gravity varies from 2 - 700
to 3 - 100, according to the proportion of pyrites, hornblende, or
chlorite entering into their composition. The general facies cor-
responds with that of the intrusive dykes of the Wood?s Point Dis-
trict, in Victoria, where similar geological conditions produce similar
mineral results.
Group 3.
Chrome-iron Serpentines.
The serpentines containing chromic iron, rarely pyrites, arc in
my opinion simply altered forms of Group 2.
In the Gladstone, Cawarral, and Kilkivan districts, there is con-
stant evidence of this; and in the first-mentioned district it is espe-
cially marked.
Group 4.
Fyritons Felsite.
This group is very sparingly represented in Queensland, the most
noticeable instance being that of Mount Wheeler, the analysis of
which by the late Professor Thompson, of the University of Sydney,
is as follows :
This rock rises abruptly to an elevation of 800 feet, through
serpentine, gabbro, and diallage rock. It is very close-grained and

compact. From a microscopic examination, Mr. Allport gave the
following description:?
? This is a felsite or trachyte, and consists of a fine, granular

Professor Thompson?s analysis would agree well with the former
portion of the microscopic determination; but the soluble portion is
rather difficult to understand, there being no appearance of a highly
hydrated silicate in the rock.
Pc this as it may, around Mount Wheeler, within a radius of a
mile the serpentine is traversed by auriferous reefs, whilst the ex-
tension of the same band of serpentine over a largo area beyond
this contains no parallel to the auriferous area round the above-
mentioned hill.
Some 30 yards from the bluff face of the Mount, the serpentine
was found to contain gold sufficient in quantity to pay for mining
to a depth of 20 feet below the surface; gold was also found even
to a depth of 80 feet, but not in remunerative quantities. This was
known as ? Block?s Claim; ? and it affords additional ground for
believing that the intrusion of Mount Wheeler was an active cause
in the mineralization of the country around it.
In the Cape-Piver district, the influence of this class of felsite
dykes is particularly marked ; and it was whilst in the preparation
of a detailed map of this gold-field that the practical value of these
conditions was first realized by myself.
A plan of one of these dykes, which occupy the whole of Paddy?s
and Sharper?s Gully, and cross Golden and Nuggety Gullies at their
richest points, is here reproduced (Fig. 16) from the published map
of the Cape Gold-field, in order to afford a crucial example of this
mode of gold production.
At the intersection of this dyke with the quartzites and mica-
slates of the metamorphic scries, a fine example of a friction-breccia
is seen on a steep hill-slope about one third of a mile from the
junction of Paddy?s Gully with the Punning Creek, up to its junc-
tion with Golden Gully.
The gold found in Paddy and Sharper?s Gullies was cither in the
form of losely aggregated fine gold, forming spongy nuggets, or
very fine dust, the material adhering to which was a more or less
decomposed form of the felsite.
The detritus of this formed the ? wash-dirt,? and the rock itself
the ? bottom,? or ? bed rock,? of those miners who were fortunate
enough to obtain claims in either of those rich gullies.
Large patches of soil on the slopes leading to these watercourses,
and on the watershed between Golden and Nuggety Gullies, were
leased for ? surfacing,? the character of the gold and rock being the
same in all these cases.*
* The analysis of Paddy?s-Gully gold, by Mr. R. Smith, gave
99-684


An analysis of this Paddy?s-Gully felsite afforded me :
Silica 70-800
Alumina 19*186
Ferric oxide 1-164
Magnesia 0-827
Potash . 1-826
Soda 1-208
Water, constitution 3*250
Water, hygroscopic 1-425
99-686
The appearance of the rock is that of a partially decomposed
felsite or trachyte, in which a portion of the alkali of the felspar has
been replaced by water, and kaolin formed, as has no doubt been
the case.
The peroxide of iron is evidently the representative of pyrites, as
it partially fills cubical cavities in the decomposed rock, and forms
no portion of a silicate.
Though the probabilities all tend to the assumption that this
felsite was the absolute matrix of the gold found in the ravines
which intersect it, still we are not able to make the definite asser-
tion, not possessing sufficient material to concentrate the heavier
particles by crushing, washing, and determining the presence of
gold by assay. In rock of the same character, however, in another
portion of the same gold-field, this fact is beyond a doubt.
At the Upper Cape diggings are two so-called reefs, viz. ? Green?s?
and ? The Tunnel,? which are of the same material, and of which
many tons were crushed, with a yield of from 6 to 8 dwts. of gold
per ton, and an unlimited supply of material.
The analysis of this stone afforded me :??
Silica 74-000
Alumina 16-137
Ferric oxide 0-963
Magnesia 0-627
Potash 3-791
Soda 0-987
Water, constitution 0-750
Water, hygroscopic 2-650
99-905
Specific gravity 2-451.
This was really a dyke of felsite, differing, as will be seen, very
little in composition from that of Paddy?s Gully; but the decompo-
sition of the felspar had not preceded so far into the kaolin clement.
The section in the tunnel by which the ? Tunnel reef? was
worked, is here sketched (Fig. 17).
As neither of these paid the working-expenses, they were aban-
doned, and now remain unworked.

water-level was reached, when the necessity for a supply of expen-
sive pumping machinery checked the enterprise for a time.
The analysis of the auriferous matrix of Gumming?s Reef afforded
me:
Silica 09-900
Alumina 12-707
Ferric oxide 4-413

Magnesia 0-130
Potash 0-600

Ihe analysis agrees with the examination under the microscope,
which indicates its approximate composition to be:?
The iron and copper are produced by the decomposition of pyrites,
the iron being chiefly in the form of brown iron-ore, and the copper
occurring as silicate. A little titanic acid and manganese were
found, but not quantitatively ascertained, the object of the examina-
tion being to determine the alkalies, and so approximately the
felspar element.
This so-called ? reef? is 10 feet wide where worked; and the
walls are composed of micaceous diorite. A nearly parallel case is
mentioned by the geologist of Southern Queensland as occurring at
Ban Ban, in the Gayndah district. He says, ? There is no appear-
ance of a mineral lode or vein of any kind on the spot. The mate-
rial, of which three tons were sent to the Sydney Mint for assay,
which resulted in a return of one ounce six dvvts. of gold per ton,
was taken from a mass of partially decomposed felspar porphyry,


probably a dyke, but exhibiting no traceable outcrop. It is in a
loose rubbly condition, and is exposed in a somewhat abrupt face on
one side of a broad gully running into Sandy Creek, a tributary of
Barambah Creek. Infiltrations of green and blue carbonate of
copper form thin films and coatings on the numerous surfaces pro-
duced by disintegration of the rock; and oxide of iron now fills the
cavities once occupied by crystals of pyrites. Both the copper and
the gold have doubtless been derived from the decomposition of
auriferous pyrites, which appear to have been developed sporadically
through the mass, and not collected into veins.?
Taking, then, the case of ?Green?s reef? and the ?Tunnel
claim ? to prove the occurrence of gold per se in group 4, the Ban
Ban and Cumming?s so-called ?reef? would be parallel cases for
group 1.
The Canoona Diggings would seem to afford the best evidence of
gold occurring in situ in serpentine. Here a gully has been worked
from its head for three quarters of a mile down its course, the bed-
rock being serpentine only, the wash-dirt a brown serpentine clay.
When the gold was found with the matrix attached, that matrix
was serpentine. The ?puddlers? in this gully have been continuing
their operations for years. After washing and rewashing the clay
detritus, they now take a little more of the decomposed undrifted
serpentine, and from this source still obtain a bare subsistence, with
sometimes, as they say, a ? little find.?
The case of ? Block?s claim,? under Mount Wheeler, may be duo
to hydrothermal action attending the intrusion of the felsite of the
Mount; and the gold cannot, therefore, be assumed as originally
present in the serpentine.
Of Ho. 2 (the diabase and dioritc group), from individual expe-
rience we can make no assertion as to the presence of gold through
the mass of the rock, since a large collection of pyrites obtained
from various auriferous districts in Queensland, which were intended
for assay, was found to be distributed throughout the case con-
taining them, when this case was fished up from the wreck of the
?Queen of the Thames;? the specimens were therefore useless for
the purposes for which they were collected.
The evidence of Mr. Aplin, the late Government Geologist for
Southern Queensland, as bearing on this point, may, however, be
adduced. Speaking of the Gooroomjam diggings, he says:?
? Gooroomjam is situated on that portion of the Bunya range
which divides the sources of the Brisbane river from those of the
Burnett.
?The diggings are confined to two gullies that descend from
either side of the range.
? The one is worked for about a mile and a half in length ; the
latter for even a less distance than this. Both are nearly worked
out; and there is little probability of a further extension of either,
? The area mined on consists entirely of greenstone, with the
exception of the lower portion of the workings on Monarumbi Creek,
a mile or so below the lower township, where massive hornblendie


schists crop out at the foot of tho range on the north side of the
creek, and granite on the point of tho spur constituting the south
bank.
? But I believe that tho little quantity of gold found here has
travelled down the creek from the tract of greenstone above, and
that the whole of the gold has been derived from the latter rock.
No quartz fragments are to be seen on the surface, and scarcely any
are ever found in the drift constituting the wash-dirt.?
In the Jermyn-Street Museum a fine example of gold in diorite,
from the Woods Point District in Victoria, where similar conditions
obtain, is open for inspection.
Although these instances have been pointed out to show tho
absolute presence of gold throughout the mass of certain eruptive
trap-dykes, it is by no means our intention to assert that tho noble
metal will be often found in sufficient concentration in this form to
become a source of supply in any material degree.
In my opinion, however, these four groups of trappean rocks arc
very important as indicative of tho period at which the gold was
deposited in the veins of quartz, calc-spar, pyrites Ac. which are
found at and near their intersection with Palaeozoic and Mctamorphie
strata, as well as in the trap-rocks themselves.
The study of these peculiar vein-stones has led mo to the con-
clusion that the fractures which they occupy were due partly to the
bursting power of the elastic vapours preceding the welling up of
the viscid trap into a portion of these rents, and partly to the con-
traction in cooling and crystallization of the intruded mass itself.
The vein-stones themselves arc probably deposits of mineral matter
from the hydrothermal action which preceded, ivas contemporaneous
with, and continued long after the trap itself had cooled down.
This action was similar to that of the Steamboat Springs in
America, cited by Blake and John Arthur Phillips.
This may have been, and doutbless was, supplemented by infil-
tration from tho trap-rocks themselves, the calc-spar element, so
characteristic of this class of lode, being probably supplied from
this source; for, as a ride, the sparry portion of the ore is poorest
in gold.
An exception to this rule is exemplified in a specimen previously
alluded to from the Caledonian Beef, Grympie, where the gold is
seen traversing calc-spar and quartz indifferently, the quartz crystals
being quite isolated in a menstruum of the spar. Again, in another
specimen it will be seen that in a breccia-lode where angular
fragments of quartz are cemented by carbonate of lime and brown
oxide of iron, the gold affects quartz, lime, and iron without respect
to affinities. Another shows a nugget of gold and carbonate of
bismuth, a portion of which, treated with hydrochloric acid, proved
that much of the gold was isolated from the larger portion, as if the
bismuth and gold had been originally precipitated together.
The very nature of the veins shows that they never can have
been subjected to any heat sufficient to cause fusion, but arc due
entirely to aqueous action.

With regard to the age of these dykes much has yet to be learned.
From all the evidence collected I should be inclined to place their
succession in time as follows:
Ist. The porphyrites and porphyries range from the Mctamorphic
to the Devonian,
2nd and 3rd. The diorites, diabases, and serpentines range through
all the Devonian period, the action being most intense in the lower
portion of the scries; and the interstratified diabase ashes and tufas
at Gympie favour this idea.
4th. The trachytes and fclsites are of uncertain date, but arc cer-
tainly younger than Group 2.
The true Carboniferous and Mesozoic Carbonaceous of Eastern
Queensland'arc constantly penetrated by trap-dykes ; but, with one
exception, these are dolerites, differing in no respect from the older
and newer Tertiary volcanic scries of the colony, and no vein-stones

Volcanic.
Whilst the older Trappean roclcs have apparently had so much
influence on the disturbance and fracture of the sedimentary strata
older than the Carboniferous, and by a secondary process have evi-
dently been centres of mineralizing action, the volcanic seem to have
played the most important part in determining the elevation and
present physical outline of North-eastern Queensland.
As will be seen by reference to the Map (PI. IX.), the main outbursts
of lava have taken place along the dividing range which separates
the eastern and western waters, and therefore on the line of the
highest elevation of the country.
The more northern volcanic areas, those shown on the Map north
of latitude 21�, are probably contemporaneous with the ? upper vol-
canic ? series of Victorian geologists, so extensively developed in the
western districts of that colony. These have issued from well-defined
craters still in existence, and are probably of Pliocene Tertiary age.
The southern areas, viz. Peak and Darling Downs &c., are older,
agreeing with the ? lower volcanic ? of Victoria, which have been
ejected through fissures, and have in no case a very extensive flow,
beyond the lines of fracture through which they issued. These may
be referred to the Miocene Tertiary epoch (PI. XII. figs. 1 & 2).
The rock-masses forming both the ? upper ? and ? lower ? volcanic
are basic in character, and may, with rare exceptions, be all grouped
under the general term ? dolerites.?
Mr. Allport?s description of a typical specimen from the Clarke
river, with minor modifications, will hold good for most of the vol-
canic rocks of Northern Queensland (PI. XII. fig. 3).
He says:?? This dolerite contains a triclinic felspar, augite,
magnetite, pseudomorphs after olivine. The felspar prisms are clear
and transparent, and exhibit well the striae and bands of colour when
examined in polarized light. The augite occurs in small brown
crystals and grains; it frequently contains black magnetite, and is
sometimes slightly altered. The olivine has been completely altered
to iron oxide, and appears in the sections as bright red grains and
crystals. Pseudomorphs of quite similar character occur in the do-
lerites and basalts of the coast of Antrim.?
After the examination of several specimens from various localities,
he adds :?? These are characteristic felspathic dolerites, and contain
neither nepheline nor leucite.?
The single exception that came under my observation in the upper
volcanic was that of an interstratified bed of a highly siliceous rock,
in which nearly one half the mass was composed of quartz crystals
arranged in a quartzose matrix.
The ? lower volcanic ? are, as a rule, far more altered and decom-
posed than the upper, and assume more the amygdaloidal character,
the usual occupants of the cavities being zeolites or calc-spar.

After examination under the microscope, Mr. Allport says of this
rock:?
? It must have been originally as scoriaceous as any recent lavas,
but now forms a hard solid mass of zeolitic mineral matter.
? All the cavities are filled with prehnite, in radiating groups of
crystals, which exhibit a magnificent display of colours when ex-
amined in polarized light.
? One cavity is lined with the radiating prehnite, and the central
portion filled partly with calcite, and partly with green carbonate of
copper.
? Of the original constituents nothing is left except the magne-
tite. The forms of felspar crystals are sharp and distinct; but the
original substance has been removed, and replaced by prehnite, dif-
fering in no respect from that filling the cavities.
? The reddish-brown grains and patches scattered through the
base probably represent the augite.?
It is interesting to observe how nearly these cupriferous altered
dolerites resemble in composition the interstratified cupriferous traps
of the Potsdam-sandstone series in the Lake-Superior district in
America.
Near the Dotswood Station, on a.tributary of the Burdekin river,
metallic copper, imbedded in a quartz matrix, has been observed in
thin irregular patches.
The rock enclosing this is amygdaloidal dolerite, itself containing
a little copper and copper-ore, but only near the patches of quartz.
Near the Mount Coora almost the same conditions of cupriferous
impregnation of decomposed dolerites obtain ; but in these cases the
ores seem to be the result of the decomposition of pyritous bands in
the rock, rather than a repetition of the conditions observed on the
Bowen river and near the Calliope Station.
On Agate Creek, a tributary of the Gilbert river, a local volcanic
outburst of no great extent is met with, the cavities in a thick band of
melaphyre, which forms a portion of this flow, being filled with agate
and carnelian .This resembles in general character the agate melaphyres
of the Vaal river in South Africa, the diamond-producing district.

that one fourth of the colony of Queensland is valueless, whereas
three fourths furnish good pastoral land.
Of this latter, 60,000 square miles contain extensive and very
valuable miues of gold, with numerous outcrops of copper- and lead-
ores, to which may now be added rich deposits of tin-ore; 24,000
square miles are capable of producing illimitable supplies of coal and
iron ; 52,000 square miles are, as far as soil is concerned, best adapted
for the agriculturist and squatter.
In conclusion, it may be asserted that there is here a wealth of
material resource which compares favourably with that of any other
Australian colony.
Appendix I.
Description of the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic Fossils of Queensland.
By Egbert Etheridge, Esq., F.E.S., &c., Palaeontologist to Her
Majesty?s Geological Survey of Great Britain.
Introduction.
Mr. Daintree?s late explorations in Queensland have added much
to our knowledge of the distribution of extinct life over that exten-
sive colony. A slight history or resume of the progress of geolo-
gical and palaeontological discovery in Australia may not be out of
place, and will show the difficulties attending research in a country
almost untrodden and only, of necessity, very partially examined.
It is hoped that the local societies may be induced to work up the
varied and rich fossil fauna surrounding those cities now so exten-
sively peopled in New South "W ales, Queensland, and South Aus-
tralia ; and it is partly with this view that we are induced to figure
the species found fossil in Queensland, many of which are new, and a


few common to Asia and Europe. A knowledge of the wide distribu-
tion of identical forms and extension of old seas, under different
conditions, can only be established by the united labours of many in
the same field of investigation. India is now being well explored,
America equally so. Southern Africa is being gradually examined;
and much of Victoria has been carefully surveyed; yet we know
little of the real palaeontology of Australia, owing to the few pub-
lished detailed descriptions and figures of the fossil fauna of the
stratified rocks of the country. The labours, however, of the Rev.
W. B. Clarke upon the spot, and of Professor Owen and Mr. Moore
England, have thrown some light upon the distribution of extinct
life in those rocks.
At the request of Mr. Daintree, I have examined the series of
fossils brought home by him, and have selected those species capable
of description. 1 have described thirty-eight new forms, and recog-
nize ten others that are common to England and the colony; it is
almost entirely amongst the Palaeozoic remains that this agreement
is found, and through the Coelenterata (or Actinozoa) and Brachio-
poda (which, perhaps, we should expect) rather than through the
higher groups. Amongst the Lamellibranchiata it can scarcely be
said that we possess any shell common to the two areas; but a
variety of Panopcea ( Mya ) plicata, Sow., occurs; and this with us is a
Lower and Upper Greensand and Gault species. One Ammonite, A.
Beudanti, D?Orb. (or a closely allied form), seems rather abundant in
the ? Hughenden ? Cretaceous beds ; this variety I have named A.
Mitchelli. The group Ligati is represented by one species from the
Mackinlay range ; it differs little from the French and English Upper
Greensand and Chalk forms. This, the A. Sutherlandi, mihi, is the
only species of the group at present recorded or known to occur in
Australia. We have also a doubtful Crioceras of considerable size, but
scarcely well enough preserved for description. No secondary or
Mesozoic Brachiopoda occur in Mr. Daintree?s series, although Mr.
Moore described seven species from the Wollumbilla collection *.
Systematic search in situ over the area in rocks of deeper-sea ac-
cumulation may bring to light species of this widely spread group of
Mollusca.
Only two Devonian, two Carboniferous, and one Cretaceous spe-
cies of Gasteropoda occur, or five in all.
The Devonian and Carboniferous faunas number twenty-seven
species, nine being common to England and Queensland. The Cre-
taceous twenty-five, two of which are British. Eight other forms
occur, which I believe are of Oolitic age ; but their condition is such
that no true description can be given of them ; they are, however,
figured on Plate XXV. From the Hughenden Cretaceous beds
we have the caudal portion and scales of a large species of Aspido-
rhynchus, a genus which, so far as we know, occurs in England in the
Lias, Oxford Clay, and Purbeck beds. Associated with these fish-
remains there is, apparently, the bone of an Ichthyosaurus.

History.
So early as 1831-2*, Major T. L. Mitchell, Surveyor-General of
Australia, brought Palaeozoic fossils from the basin of the Hunter
river, and submitted them to Mr. J. D. Sowerby for identification.
These appear to have been Carboniferous ; for Atrypa glabra and Spi-
rifera are mentioned amongst the few forms occurring.
Shells resembling Astarte and Hippopodium are also mentioned,
of which latter there were four species named by Mr. Sowerby; Me-
gadestnus, an Isocardiiform shell, and Trochus {T. oculus ) complete
the list. Ho conclusions as to age or stratigraphical position were
attempted, either by the explorer or Sowerby, it being evident that
they had not materials enough upon which to base reliable con-
clusions.
A. R. C. Selwyn, Esq., in 18581, mentioned in a letter to Prof.
Ramsay, having in his possession many known and new forms of
Silurian fossils, and that Prof. M?Coy was about to examine, describe,
and figure the new species; this, however, does not appear to have
been done.
Mr. Selwyn distinctly describes the occurrence, near Melbourne,
of the equivalents of the May-Hill Sandstone of England, and, to
to the eastward, of a gradually ascending series, including Wenlock,
Ludlow, Devonian, and true Carboniferous rocks, with Oolitic coal-
bearing beds, resting unconformably upon the Palaeozoic strata. Sel-
wyn also recognized to the westward, towards Ballarat, a descending
series, believing them to be Cambrian; he also mentions that about
sixty Silurian genera occur in that area, and many new species;
these are all enumerated in Mr. Selwyn?s paper ( loc . at.); but owing
to genera only being mentioned, and the chief occurring in the
older Palaeozoic rocks, they are of little value for a general table
of distribution.
In 1860 the Rev. W. B. Clarke, M.A., published + a valuable con-
tribution to the history of Australia. In the appendix, p. 282 (H),
?Fossils of the Southern Districts,? Mr. Clarke refers to the assist-
ance received by him from Mr. Lonsdale and Mr. J. W. Salter in
determining the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous species ; and
a copious horizon-lable is given at pp. 285 and 288. No less than
269 fossils are enumerated, but only 124 species determined; the
genera therefore have little value. At p. 284 Mr. Clarke refers
to the resemblance, if not identity of the Carboniferous species of
Australia with those of Ireland, as determined by Prof. M'Coy (Ann.
Mag. Nat. Hist. vol. xx.). ? We find,? says M?Coy, ? so extraordi-
nary and unexpected an amount of agreement between those beds
and the similar Shales, Sandstones, and Inferior Limestones form-
ing the base of the Carboniferous system in Ireland, that it is im-
possible not to believe them on the same parallel, and there is equal

difficulty in imagining them to be either younger or older than those
deposits/? MM. de Yernenil and Barrande also especially notice
the agreement of certain forms with those of Australia.
F. T. Gregory, Esq., in 1861*, gave to the Society a geological
sketch of a part of Australia, the result of nearly thirty years resi-
dence in Western Australia.
The area geologically explored was the Darling range and the
country to the eastward, Mr. Gregory states that he had been
unable to procure any positive proof of the existence of rocks of
Silurian age ?though, judging by analogy, there is reason to suppose
they might occur; he states that the rocks comprising ? Mount
Barren Ranges? are the only ones hearing any Silurian character
or holding that relative position with regard to other formations.
He next assumed that the Devonian series occurred in the form of
compact felspathic clays, sandstones, and ferruginous conglome-
raerates, capping the tableland of the Darling range; he, however,
failed to detect any fossils in these supposed Devonian beds. (These
are the Desert Sandstones.)
Some doubt seems to have existed relative to the Carboniferous
group, to what horizons to refer the coal-bearing strata of the
Irwin river, though probably these coals are of Mesozoic age; and
Gregory stated that on the Fitzgerald river ? a true seam of coal
had not been found,? the known bed being horizontal and resting
unconformably upon the edges of highly elevated Carboniferous
Shales, and containing distinct fragments of wood and infusible resin.
In a note by the Editor of the Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. the following
genera are said to occur in the collection brought from Western
Australia by Mr. Gregory, and which determined these lower beds
to be Upper Palseozoic : ? Spirifera , Productus , Pleurotomaria , Nau-
tilus, Cyathophyllum , Encrinital stems , being Carboniferous fossils,
with coal, from Irwin River.
In 1861 the Rev. W. B. Clarke f also briefly traced the researches
which brought to light the position of certain plants in the coal-
bearing beds of Australia, stating that Mr. Selwyn (Director of
the Geological Survey of Victoria) had recognized in Eastern
Victoria ? true Carboniferous plants,? and that the same author
had stated that the fossils of the Tasmanian coal-bearing beds are
nearly all Carboniferous or Devonian forms. So with New South
Wales, in which colony Mr. Clarke states that the plants said to
be u Jurassic ? occur associated with a Palaeozoic fish, Urosthenes
australis A-g.
In the new colony of Queensland, associated with ? calcareous
beds holding abundance of Carboniferous and Devonian zoological
forms, occur shales and fine calcareous grits charged with plants.?
Mention is made by Mr, Clarke of some sinkings at Stony Creek,
Maitland, by Mr. B. Russell, in which were found Pachydomx,
Spiriferce, Orthoceratidce, Conularice, Asteriada, &c., thus demon-
strating in that area the presence of Palaeozoic rocks and associated
genera of fossils.
* Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xvii. p. 475, 1861. t Ibid. p. 354.


In 1862 * Mr. Clarke again notices what he believes to be a
Permian fauna in Eastern Australia, between the Balonne and
Maranoa rivers (Queensland). They were referred by Professor
M?Coy to beds ? not younger than the base of the Great Oolite, and
not older than the base of the Trias.? M?Coy enumerated thirty
distinct forms from Wollumbilla Creek, the river Amby, and a
tract on Eitzroy Downsf. To what age these may all belong is
doubtful; Prof. M?Coy, however, believed then that the Wollumbilla
fossils were the marine representatives of the so-called Jurassic
coal-beds of New South Wales. Mr, Clarke also submitted to Prof.
M?Coy some mollusca from the Mantuan Downs, 200 miles north
of Wollumbilla (which were pronounced to be of Permian age?
Magnesian Limestone), a form allied to Aulosteges or Strophalosia,
and Productus calva. The occurrence of Permian strata has not been
confirmed in Australia by subsequent observers; and the same may
be said of the Trias.
Prof. M?Coy, in 1866, was the first to announce with certainty
the discovery of Cretaceous fossils in Australia, from Elinders
River, base of Walker?s Table Mountains]:. Gregory having pre-
viously doubtfully indicated such a group of fossils, M'Coy described
three species, two Inocerami (I. Carsoni and I. Sutherlandi) and one
Ammonite (A. Flindersi ). The last-named species, I think, I have
detected in Mr. Daintree?s collection from Hughenden Station.
M?Coy, unfortunately, does not give any figures. I have named
this Ammonite after Mr. T. L. Mitchell, and referred it for affinity
to A. Beudanti, D?Orb.; my name may have to give way to
M?Coy?s upon comparison with and reference to the original shell in
Victoria. Inoceramus Carsoni, M?Coy, and I. Sutherlandi, M?Coy,
may be in the Daintree series; but descriptions of such variable
shells as the Inocerami, without figures, render identification almost
impossible.
In 1867 the Rev. W. B. Clarke also communicated to the Society
his paper upon the ? Marine fossiliferous Secondary Formations in
Australia.? �
The author stated that up to the year 1860 no deposit of Secon-
dary age had been demonstrated in Eastern Australia, although
Belemnites and a few other fossils belonging to a Lower Secondary
formation had been found on the Maranoa river in West Queens-
land.
The series then under consideration from Wollumbilla, north of
the Condamine river, were not exhibited at the International Exhi-
bition in 1862, owing to delay in transit; they were,however, sub-
sequently placed in the hands of Mr. Charles Moore, E.G.S., of
Bath, for the purpose of description; that gentleman, in the year
1870, prepared for the Society an elaborate paper describing all the
new species, and notes accompanying them. Mr. Moore, in 1862
(previously), met accidentally with a collection of fossils in Somerset-

shire*, sent from Western Australia by a Mr. Clifton, probably from
Mr. Gregory?s Moresby-range series. Mr. Moore determined between
fifty and sixty species from tbe collection, and placed them upon the
horizon of tbe Lias and Lower Oolite of Britain.
Subsequently, in 1863 and 1864, the Rev. W. B. Clarke received
other fossils from a locality 15� N. of Champion Bay, probably from
near tbe Moresby Range; tbe Paleontological facies of these was
strikingly representative of early Secondary, Oolitic, or Liassic age,
as determined by such forms as Ostrea Marshii, Ammonites Moorei,
Avicula Munsteri, Belemnites canaliculatus , Ac. It would thus
appear, then, that the Moresby range was a highly typical locality
for the Jurassic deposits of Western Australia.
These disjointed notices, from good and reliable observers, are so
many facts tending to show how widely the Lower Secondary rocks
must have spread over the Australian continent, and also what
extreme denudation they must have suffered during, perhaps, com-
paratively modern times. Mr. Moore?s paper descriptive of the
series from Moresby Range has been the means of drawing much
attention to the distribution of life through these remarkable rocks,
so slightly exposed vertically, over the great plains of Australia.
Mr. Moore, in 1869, in his important paper (published in 1870t)
upon ? Australian Mesozoic Geology and Palaeontology,? did great
service in pioneering by venturing to describe and correlate the
Secondary fossils sent to him for determination; he attributes to
Mr. Clifton the credit of having had in his possession the earliest
evidence of the presence of Mesozoic fossils on the Australian conti-
nent. That part of Mr. Moore?s paper devoted to the Queensland
Mesozoic fossils, he. cit. pp. 232-259, is highly important to the
question of distribution of the Secondary fossils through the colony ;
and the list of organic remains at pp. 239-40 shadows forth what
we may expect when the rocks are thoroughly searched. He has
added more to our definite knowledge of the Secondary organic forms
of Australia than any other writer.
The only other addition of importance to our knowledge of the
Secondary fauna of Australia, prior to Mr. Moore?s paper, was
Prof. M?Coy?s notice and description of a portion of an Ichthyo-
saurus (I. australis), supposed by him to be from the Lower Lias,
although this was not clearly ascertained. Prof. M'Coy also, in 1866
(Trans. Royal Soc. of Victoria, vol. vii. pp. 49-51, 1866), in an
abstract of a paper ? On the Discovery of Cretaceous Dossils in
Australia,? mentions receiving from the western bank of the Flinders
river, at the base of Walker?s Table Mountains, lat. 21� 13', long.
143�, through Messrs. Sutherland and Carson, a small collection of
geological specimens; ? this enabled Prof. M?Coy to announce for the
first time, with certainty, the existence of the Cretaceous formations
in Australia.?

It would seem, then, that Mr, Moore has clearly determined the
presence of a Middle and Upper Lias fauna; i. e. the Australian
Lower Secondary rocks contain fossils almost identical in facies with
those of the Lias of Europe and N. E. India, or which, homotaxially,
may be of, or represent, the same age.
It is, however, to he regretted that his specimens were not
obtained in situ, instead of from drifted materials; for nothing is
known of the beds or sections from which the Wollumbilla fossils
originally came. It is not a little singular, however, that Mr.
Moore recognized twenty species as common to England and
Western Australia*. Amongst the Cephalopoda are five species
of Ammonites, one Nautilus, and one Belemnite, chiefly from the
Upper Lias and Lower Oolite; the remaining thirteen species of
Lamellibranchiata, with two exceptions, are also of Lower Oolitic
age. Mr. Moore believes that many others common J;o the two
countries occur ; but their worn and eroded state prevented reliable
identification.
Queensland.
I have now to add some new facts relative to the distribution of
life through the North Queensland rocks, from which Mr. Daintree
has obtained a more general series of Plant�, Mollusca, and
Coelenterata, mostly new, and ranging from the Silurian to the
Tertiary deposits?the Devonian, Carboniferous, and Cretaceous
being well represented.
Mr. Daintree?s specimens were mostly obtained in situ ?but
nevertheless nearly all occur in the form of casts, arising doubtless
from the solvent action of water by percolation and oxidation, as
they are not abraded or water-worn; nor, from their condition,
could they have been much exposed to the atmosphere.
It is therefore to be regretted that so few of our specimens
possess the outer shell, so essential to the true diagnosis and differ-
entiation of species. It is, however, felt that if all the Australian
fossils are to be rejected, or no attempt made to determine them,
little or no stimulus will be given to the exploration of those vast
and widely spread fossiliferous regions and rock-masses which
occupy so extensive an area in Queensland and other parts of
Australia.
To figure them also without some individual description and
indications of affinities with well-known forms would tend to mislead.
I have therefore been bold enough to do both, viz. give the best
figure possible and the clearest description I could with the materials
composing the collection at my command. Doubtless the time will
come when better and more perfect specimens will be found; the
task of identification will then be much easier than that which, at
the request of Mr. Daintree, I have undertaken.

established by stratigraphical position, sequence, or succession, is

supported by palaeontological research; and there cannot now be
any doubt that the Broken-River Limestone beds, containing
Favosites &c. Ac., are the lowest fossiliferous deposits in the
Queensland area, and their age is undoubtedly Lower Devonian
or ? Siluro-Devonian.? These are succeeded by the Gympie
group, a higher series, with the Star-River and Mount-Wyatt
beds succeeding, rich in Lepidodendra and Spiriferce. These
Devonian rocks yield generally Lepidodendron, Leptophloeum,
Productus, Spirifera, Ac. &c.?indeed, possess a fauna and flora
closely allied to that of Canada, of the same age. The Carboni-
ferous rocks of the Don river, which succeed unconformably, are
also of the same relative age as the British and European series ;
no less than ten species are known to be common to the two
countries. The genus Glossopteris is abundantly distributed through
the upper beds of this group at Bowen River, Roper Creek, and
Dawson River; and research has shown that this plant does not
range higher in the Australian rocks. Associated with Glossoptens
there occurs an extensive fauna of Mollusca, especially Brachiopoda.
It is doubtful if true Permian and Trias exist or are repre-
sented on the Australian continent. Neither organic remains nor
rocks in position afford any true clue to the occurrence of these
deposits, which are so widely spread in Europe, Africa, and India.
The Secondary rocks of Queensland also exhibit the most com-
plete unconformity to the Palaeozoic below ; the rocks known in situ
to thus overlie the Carboniferous are the Lower Oolitic series of
Gordon Downs, Wollumbilla, Burrum, and Tivoli. The upper
members of the Oolites are freshwater and estuarine beds, and
form the southern Coal-field of Queensland, characterized by the
abundant presence of Tceniopteris &c. Ac* and but few Mollusca,
indeed a small fauna so far as is yet known. Mr. C. Moore, through
specimens obtained at Wollumbilla (though not in situ) clearly
revealed and proved the presence of Lower Lias, Oolite, and
Oxford-Clay fossils in that area. At Pelican Creek and Gordon
Downs we clearly possess the marine Oolitic rocks in position; but
the fossils are in an extremely bad state of preservation, and but
few in species. . ? , , , , ? v
Succeeding these are the Coal-bearing fresh-water beds of Tivoli
and Burrum, containing Tceniopteris , which are the highest of the
Lower Secondary or Mesozoic series of Queensland.
The Upper Secondary (Cretaceous) series of Maryborough, Hugh-
enden, Marathon, and O'Connel Creek may succeed each other in the
order here given; and, from the fossil evidence, I am disposed to
place them in this order of superposition or time, believing that the
Maryborough beds are the lowest, the Hughenden, Marathon, and
Flinders beds succeeding them. . a . ?
Dolerites or augitic Trap rocks, or ? the Lower Volcanic Senes,

origin is doubtful; it was probably the latter, no marine organism
ever having been found in it: so vast an estuarine deposit would,
I must believe, under any change of level exhibit occasional fossils
of estuarine and brackish water or semimarine types. The close of
the Desert Sandstone is marked by a recurrence of Dolerite Trap
rocks, or ? Upper Volcanic,? similar in character to the Lower, or
those which underlie the Sandstone.
The above condensed stratigraphical sequence of the Queensland
formations may aid those who refer to the Palaeontological Appendix
only; their pure geology is discussed at length by the Agent-General
for Queensland (Mr. Daintree) in his extended paper.
I purposed constructing a distribution-table for the organic re-
mains of Queensland, West Australia, and Victoria &c., but, after
much research, determined for the present to abandon this until
more definite materials or data for time-range could he obtained.
Much has to be done in definitely placing together the palaeozoic
species; and as more materials are about to arrive in Lngland, it is
better to defer this attempt for the present,
Mr. Daintree has placed the whole collection at my disposal, and
allowed me to select those specimens most typical or sufficiently
characteristic and well marked to enable me to draw up some defi-
nite characters, and refer them to known forms where possible. The
Plantae receive the same attention, through Mr. Carruthers, F.R.S.;
and it is hoped that the collection * made by Mr. Daintree and
others, and now figured, will be instrumental in leading to further
extended research through the sedimentary rocks of Australia
generally.

his large collection of minerals and fossils from Melbourne, was wrecked off the

posed, neither minerals nor fossils were much improved by their long submergence
prior to recovery. The labour and anxiety of many years? research to establish
the age and nature of the stratified rocks of Queensland was then nearly lost;
and but for the fortunate position of the ship near the shore, fresh collections
must have been made to elucidate the physical character and structure of the

proportionately our single specimen agrees with his, hut apparently
is individually larger.

An impression only, and that of the inner surface, of one valve of
this singular and doubtful shell occurs. Our figure is taken from
a gutta-percha cast of the impression left; and its peculiarity induces
me to figure and notice it, in the hope of receiving perfect specimens.
That it belongs to the Asiphonida I do not doubt, and, I believe, to one
of the Aviculidae. The umbonal region is certainly not complete ; and
therefore no true conclusion can be arrived at relative to the nature
of the ears and hinge-line of the perfect shell.
Shell inequilateral, and possessing twenty-two ribs, the ends or
extremities of which imbricate or overlap in the cast; there appears
to be, or to have been, a space between the end of each rib at its
extremity, or along the ventral margin ; faint longitudinal markings
run down each of the ribs, following their course. Many of our
Limai possess bent and folded ribs (Ex. L. rustica ) ; but their pecu-
liar arrangement in our shell is different from that in any known
Lima.

Ohs. This shell resembles Av. planoradiatus, M?Coy, both in form
and in the nature of the ribs; our shell, however, has the edges of
the ribs sharp, instead of being flattened, and is not so convex a
shell as A. planoradiatus. It has also affinity with Pecten squa-
muliferus, Morris, from Mount Wellington, Van Diemen?s Land*;
I cannot, however, clearly determine the presence of imbricated
scales upon the ribs ; and unfortunately we have no ? ears ? left to
correlate with Prof. Morris?s species: it may also be compared with
the Aviculopecten docens, M?Coy, Brit. Pal. Eoss. t. 3. figs. 6& 7. Our
shell also possesses about the same number of ribs.

Edmondia concentrica, Ether. PI. XIII. fig. 2.
Shell oblong, apparently equivalve, postero-dorsal margin convex,
antero-dorsal steeply inclined from umbo to anterior slope; umbones
small, indistinct; surface with numerous concentric and imbricated
lines of growth in band-like zones; posterior side acutely rounded;
anterior obtusely rounded or truncated.
Ohs. Edmondia is a convenient genus to whicli we may refer these
Myacitiform shells, especially when no true shell-structure occurs
upon them; and in this genus I place the above shell. We are pre-
vented from seeing the large oblique cartilage-plates beneath the
umbones, owing to the matrix. The genus Sanguinolites, M?Coy (in
part), receives some Edmondiiform shells; but the general form and
aspect of our specimen precludes it. I figure it, like many other
forms, to draw the attention of Australian geologists to the Lamelli-
branchiata of the Palaeozoic rocks of Queensland and elsewhere
through the colony, in the hope that search may be made for more
perfect specimens.

outer shell wanting, but appears to have been concentrically banded.
Ohs. I place this shell in the above genus, although it may be a
Myacites ; but the want of outer shell to show whether granulated
or not, prevents our determining this point. Pullastra ovalis, M?Coy,
and Edmondia ? compressa , M?Coy, from the Carboniferous series of
Ireland, much resemble this species in form, especially the former;
our shell is from the ?fossiliferous greenstone? of Beehive Reef,
Gympie, and, from the associated Mollusca, is probably of Devonian
age.

This well-known British and European Carboniferous shell has
great range both in time and space, occurring in India, America,
Russia, Belgium, and Great Britain, and is now, for the first time,
recognized in Australia. In Britain we do not know this shell in
our Devonian series. Although described by D?Orbiguy under
this name, by De Koninck as Productus cornoides, by M?Coy as P.
corrugata, and by M'Chesney as P.pileiformis, they are nevertheless
all one species. Our shell was evidently very thin and fragile, with
a gibbous ventral valve, the surface covered with straight, wavy, or
flexuous longitudinal thread-like striae or ribs, and few spines.


The dorsal valve (fig. 2) shows the rugose undulating folds or
wrinldes at the cardinal angles.
We fail to see the concentric lines crossing the ribs on our ex-
amples, owing to their condition; and the places of former spines are
faintly traceable.
It is not a little singular that this shell, so common in the Car-
boniferous rocks of Great Britain and not known with us as a
Devonian form, is yet associated with Lepidodendra in the Devonian
rocks of Queensland, to which strata the genus Lepidodendron is
there confined, and where homotaxially it seems to have preceded
its appearance in Europe; associated also with P. com we have
plant-remains, which are noticed by Mr. Carruthers in a second
appendix to Mr. Daintree?s paper.

Spibifera bisulcata, Sow., var. acuta. PI. XVI. fig. 1.
I can only refer this fragment of a Spirifera to one of the many
forms assumed by the variable species S. bisulcata, Sow. (S. trirjo-
nalis, Mart.). One chief character (the mesial fold) is wanting in our
specimen ; but in all other respects it agrees with many British and
European forms. S. bisulcata is not a British Devonian species; its
place seems taken by the representative shell S. undulata, Rom,,
which seems to be as abundantly distributed through the Devo-
nian rocks in Queensland as in England and Germany; and the
cardinal angles of our shell are more acute than in many of the
variations assumed by European forms. The varietal name acuta,
will serve to distinguish it from those possessing more tumid cardinal
angles ; it possesses also sharp ribs.
u / i JL
Some Irish and Scotch forms of S. striata resemble our shell, but
possess usually much finer and more numerous ribs. The undu-
lation of the ventral margin, especially the mesial fold, is usually
much more pronounced.

I cannot do other than refer this fragmentary Spirifera to the
above species. It has not the number of ribs described by Sowerby;
hut their angular, imbricated, or fimbriated condition, the width of
the mesial fold or ridge, and the pointed beak, with the transversely
fusiform shape of the one valve, are sufficient to warrant my retaining
this name for the specimen from Gympie.
Many Spiriferce in the British rocks, belonging to this fusiform
group, much resemble our shell in general aspect, especially the
varieties of S. convoluta, Phill.; but none of our British or European
shells possesses the aspect of the valve under notice; five or six rows

of acutely angular imbrications are distinguishable upon the mesial
fold, and traceable along the attenuated lateral wings of the cardinal
angles. It is impossible to state what was the nature of the hinge-
area and its sides, and whether parallel or not. 1 figure the speci-
men as having an important bearing upon the determination and
distribution of these fusiform Spirifera on the Australian continent
and adjacent islands, as well as adjoining lands.

Spirifera dubia, Ether. PI. XYI. fig. 6.
Shell transversely semicircular; hinge-line nearly as long as the
width of the shell; cardinal angles gently rounded; mesial fold
having many small ribs, and wide at ventral border of shell; eight or
nine ribs occur on each side of the mesial fold upon the cardinal angle
or lateral portion of the shell. It is evident that many small ribs
occurred upon the mesial fold, and some of the ribs upon the lateral
areas bifurcated as they approached the ventral margin.
This shell resembles some forms of Spirifera undulata ; but the ribs
are finer than in normal forms of that species; the ribbed mesial
fold and bifurcating lateral ribs are essential points of difference.
Not having any outer shell, we have no means of determining any
markings upon the valves; but it differs from known species of
Spirifera . I know of no species, either Devonian or Carboniferous,
to which the above shell can be referred, the rounded cardinal angles
and almost semicircular dorsal valve distinguishing it from every
known form.

This well-known variety of Spirifera undifera needs scarcely
any description here, Romer having described it in his 6 Rheinische
Uebergangsgeb.,? p. 70, t. 4. fig. 5, and Schlotheim having previously
described S. curvatus , of which our shell is a variety. Again the
S. undifera of Schnur, ? Dunker?s Paheontographica,? vol. ii. p. 204,
t. 34. figs. 9, Qh, appears to be closely allied to our Queensland shell.
Mr. Davidson, in his 4 Monograph upon the Devonian Brachiopoda/
Pal. Soc. p. 37, t. 7. figs. 11-14, figures one variety, S. undulata ,
which appears to be scarcely distinguishable from the. Queensland
form. Comparison with Schnur?s figures of S. and S. undu-
lata, Rom., leads me to consider them varieties or modifications of the
same shell differentiated according to circumstances during life.
The Queensland specimens differ little amongst all
having the well-marked mesial fold in the ventral valve and eight
or ten ribs on either side; the hinge-line is shorter than the width
of the shell, and the cardinal angles are rounded. The beak in
dorsal valve incurved; there are faint tracings of the concentric
ridges or folds; but, owing to all the specimens being casts, the
more delicate markings cannot be determined. The distribution of


this species is nearly world-wide, being cosmopolitan or �biquitous
in every sense of the word, Strzelecki, in his ? Physical Description
of New South Wales and Van Diemen?s Land,? does not seem to
have met with it there; but a representative shell, S. tasmaniensis,
Moms, occurs in rocks of the same age: in many respects this shell
resembles our Queensland species; but the hinge-line is wider, and
the cardinal angles are less rounded.

Obs. I can scarcely detect any difference between the form and

size is greater; but unfortunately the loss of the outer shell prevents
our seeing the band or slit at the edge of the whorl, in the absence
of which it might be referred to llaphistoma or Platyschisma ; it is not,
however, sufficiently depressed to be referred to the former genus.
The species of this genus, unless well defined, are at all times most
difficult to determine; in the above case I am not justified in pro-
posing a new name, and therefore refer it to Sowerby?s P. carinata,
which it very closely resembles.

to give definite characters would mislead; it so closely resembles
F. fossula, from Mount Wellington, Yan Diemen?s Land, and St.
Patrick?s Plains, New South Wales, that I feel obliged to refer it to
that form ; any additional species would only multiply names. I had,
however, proposed the name F. densa for our Queensland specimen.
The original habit was probably infundibuliform or cup-shaped;
hut whether the bars were rectangularly dichotomous, with oval
meshes, cannot be distinctly made out.

pair of larger ones, the interspaces delicately marked by concentric
wavy lines, or striae, which pass over the costae, or ribs.
Obs. This shell differs essentially from the British species of
Streptorhynchi in the coarseness of its ribbing, or costae, in the more
depressed and truncated cardinal angles, and the more pronounced or
acute umbonal region. We have no interior for comparison, the
specimen described being the only one in our possession; but it
fortunately possesses some of the outer shell.
This subgenus of Strophomena is seldom well preserved, the cha-
racters being generally very indistinct. Only one species ( Sp. ere-
nistria), with three or four varietal forms, is known in Europe. Erom
their extreme variation the forms of Streptorhynchus have received nu-
merous specific names, now all referable to one. Mr. Davidson, P.R.S.,
has examined the above shell, and cannot refer it to any known form
of Streptorhynchus. I therefore, after careful examination, hesitate
not to name it after the distinguished naturalist and Brachiopodist
whose labours to unravel and elucidate the structure and history of
this difficult group have surpassed those of all other writers, and
who in readiness to assist those who desire information and know-
ledge is surpassed by none.

I cannot detect any difference between this one specimen and the
British species; and Mr. Davidson refers it also to P. longispinus ; our
shell is the inner cast of the dorsal valve.


This common and widely spread shell is the most variable of the
Producti, and seldom attains a larger size than our specimen, which
is a cast of the interior of the dorsal valve. It is known in the Car-
boniferous Limestone of the Punjaub in India, Carro Creek in Tas-
mania, Bolivia, Russia, and Belgium, and everywhere in Britain ; we
now, for the first time, record it from Queensland.

Productus Clarkei, Ether. Plate XVII. figs, 2, 2a,2 h.
Shell ovate, nearly as wide as long, hinge-line short, cardinal
angles rounded; the beak appears to have been moderately developed ;
the small or dorsal valve nearly flat, and following the course of the
ventral valve, which is convex, or gibbous ; beak, or umbo, moderately
developed, incurved; surface of shell covered with fine vertical wavy
lines, projecting from which are numerous slender spines.
Ohs. Affinities:?The ventral valve of this shell much resembles
in shape certain forms of P, scalenoides ; but the dorsal valve in our
species is much flatter than in P. scalenoides, or, indeed, any other
known Productus. The flat or dorsal valve is furrowed by numerous
concentric lines of growth, which apparently possessed spines, points
of attachment for which still remain.
Externally our shell is also allied to P. muricatus, Phill., but is
much larger; and many forms of P. Youngianus may at first sight be
mistaken for it; the latter shell, however, is deeper, and the umbo
more incurved than in P. Clarkei.
Loc. Bowen River. Form. Carboniferous.
No one on the Australian continent has done so much to further
our knowledge of its physical structure as the Rev. W. B. Clarke,
M.A., E.G.S., &c.; to him both colonists and geologists are deeply
indebted for the patient and determined labour with which he has
worked out the auriferous deposits and fossil contents of the Aus-
tralian rocks. I therefore associate his name with this shell, which
seems abundant.
Productus or Strophalosia. PI. XVIII. figs, 4, 4a.
I am in doubt about assigning even the generic name to this shell.
That it belongs to the Productidae is evident; but whether to the
genus Productus or Strophalosia it is difficult to determine. We
have the dorsal and ventral valves of two different individuals ; but
none of the outer shell remains, only some of the inner pearly con-
centric coats. The dorsal valve resembles that of P. scahriculus,
especially in the peculiar arrangement of its spines. It occurs in a
pale grey limestone composed chiefly of the crowded and broken
remains of the species.

This shell has all the characters of our common British species.


The mesial fold is not so well defined as in the typical Sp. striata ;
and some transverse forms of Sp. bisulcata assume this shape. We
may, however, confidently refer it to the above shell, or one of its
many varieties.
This most variable and widely distributed species of the genus
Spirifera appears to be not uncommon, as I have been given to under-
stand that individuals of the species are abundant in the Bowen-
Biver series. This shell is typical of the Carboniferous rocks in
every region of the globe where deposits of this age occur.
The hinge-line is as long as the greatest width of the shell, and
the cardinal angles somewhat acute; the ribs on the surface of our
shell are finer than in most specimens; it resembles some Yorkshire
as well as American forms ; but we have had no opportunity of com-
paring it with Russian specimens.

We may refer this fragment to Sp. convoluta ; its extreme width
and straight hinge-line essentially ally it to this sheU; the acute
angles at the extremities are lost; still many of our Yorkshire shells
strongly resemble this species : the ribs on the mesial fold are also less
defined than on most typical forms; it is, however, closely allied
to our British species.
We have only a portion of the shell by which to compare it with
British and Belgian shells ; but the identification cannot, I think, be
doubted.

The ventral valve only of this shell occurs ; and I refer it to one
of the many forms of Sp. bisulcata as being the nearest; we figure
it as an important example from the Carboniferous rocks and for future
research. The incurved and approximate beaks are well shown, also
the numerous and fine ribs upon both sides of the mesial fold. Un-
fortunately the cardinal area is not seen, but the complete description
of the varieties and forms of this shell by Ihomas Da\idson, Escp,
F.R.S.. in his valuable memoir upon the Carboniferous Brachiopoda,
Pal. Soc. p. 31, t. 6. figs. 1-19, supplies the want of better specimens.
Our shell possesses scarcely so elongated a hinge-line as most of
the forms of this species ; but the rounded cardinal extremities, or
angles, wide area and incurved beak, as well as the facies, lea\e
little doubt about its alliance. _ This, like many species of Spirifera,
is extensively distributed in time and space, especially through the
Carboniferous series of Europe.

Spirifera allied to S. striata , Sow. PL XVIII. fig. 8.
So variable a form as the above may have referred to it any species
with equally convex valves, a moderately elevated mesial fold, a
variable number of radiating ribs, and a straight hinge-line. We fail
to recognize the reticulated ornamentation of the outer surface,
arising from the want of the perfect outer shell.
We possess only the dorsal valve of this form, and, therefore, are
not justified in giving it a varietal name. I figure it amongst other
shells &c. occurring in the Don-River Carboniferous rocks. It is
said to be abundant in Queensland; I, however, only recognize one
valve amongst the Daintree collection. Many varieties of S. hisul-
cata 9 Sow., especially some forms ot the var. semic i rcu la vis , Phill.,
also very much resemble our shell. I name these affinities in the
hope that attention may be paid to them when better specimens
occur ; and the works of Davidson, De Koninck, M?Coy, <fec. are now,
or should be, in the chief Colonial libraries.

The subgenus Chonetes seems only to be illustrated by one species;
but of this there are many individuals.
Sp. char. Shell transversely oblong or semicircular, wider than
long, both valves ornamented with many ribs; hinge-line straight,
not so long as the width of the shell, area narrow and parallel?
ventral margin convex. Cardinal angles rounded and flattened at
their extiemities. Ventral valve slightly convex. Dorsal valve
nearly flat, or following the curve of the ventral. Beak small, ap-
parently slightly incurved, but not covering the hinge-line. The
place of the hinge-spines faintly traceable. The surface of the shell
covered by what must have been short and stout spines numerously
distributed. J
Ohs. The species of this genus vary to an immense extent, so much
so that they may be almost recognized according to their locality-
habitat and bathymetrical conditions, &c., being evidently the cause.
Ihis shell resembles C. hardrensis, so abundant in the Devonian and
Carboniferous rocks of Europe, but differs from the allied British
species, C. Buchiana and C. Dalmaniana. With the latter it has no
affinity, the ribs being much finer than in either of them, the spines
being more numerous and the hinge-line longer; with the variable
C. hardrensis, however, it has considerable affinity, especially with
Phillips s type form; but the spines are much more numerous, and
the cardinal angles more pronounced and flattened. Whether the
ribs bifurcated or not I cannot determine.
The abundance of this shell at Cracow Creek, and its differences
irom other known species, suggest the name I have ventured to give it.

Pledrotoitaria rotunda. Ether. PI. XYIII. fig. 3,
Shell turbinate or trochiform, with four whorls; apex slightly de-


pressed; aperture suboval or subangular. Whorls completely rounded
and concentrically striated with numerous close-set costse, which are
crossed diagonally from the mouth backwards by very fine lines,
giving the shell a reticulate appearance*. Base slightly convex.
Umbilicus very small or obsolete. Sinus scarcely distinguishable.
This shell appears at first sight to be smooth, the ornamentation
being microscopic, yet definite ; on a portion only of the shell is there
structure remaining. In form, size, and general aspect P. rotunda
resembles P. granulaia , De Kon.; but the sculpturing of the shell and
the band-like sinus remove it from that species. P. rotundata, Phill.,
in the rotundity of the whorls and other minor points, somewhat re-
sembles it; but our species is much less acute in the spire.
Only one specimen occurs, which is to be regretted.

Naticopsis? HAKPiEFOEMis, Ether. PI. XYIII. fig. 6.
Only the body-whorl of this singular little shell is left for our ex-
amination, and this only seen in part; but so rare are these shells in
the older rocks that we are glad to recognize and figure the smallest
fragment.
The only shell in the British Palaeozoic rocks approaching this in
shape is the Cylindrites (Conus) carbonarius, De Kon. ; but the body-
whorl in that species is more attenuated, and the suture appears to
have been deeper; again, we have no lip exposed, so that the aper-
ture and canal cannot be examined. The summit of the body-whorl
is ornamented with thirty or thirty-five nodes or tubercles, each of
which occupies the summit of a rib or varice. The upper whorls are
lost; they must, however, have been very much depressed. This shell
bears resemblance to Macrocheilus canaliculatus, M?Coy, and M. ava-
ils, M?Coy, especially the former?through both the body-whorl and
what must have been the depressed suture to Natica meridionalis ,
Phil. (Pal. Foss. Dev. and Cornw. t. 36, f. 173), and also Macrochei-
lus, Phil, loc. cit. t. 39. f. 197. Macrocheilus (Murex) harpula, Sow.
(M. C. t. 575. f. 5), has much affinity also with our shell; again, cer-
tain American Loxonemce have soc?y-whorls which cannot be dis-
tinguished from our specimen. Prof. Morris has suggested that our
doubtful fossil may be a small Goniatite, with a wide umbilical cavity,
and the ribs passing over the back, each rib bearing a tubercle round
the umbilicus. lam still disposed to regard it as the body-whorl of
a Gasteropod, or a shell with very depressed whorls hidden in the
matrix.

Muechisonia caeinata, Ether. PI. XYIII. fig. 5.

Gasteropods appear so rare in these rocks that we venture to figure
this in hopes that more perfect examples may be found.
* These are seen only near the aperture.


Ohs. Sandberger, Die Yerst. Rhein. Schicht. Nassau, t. 24, figures
two or three species of elongated Fleurotomarim resembling our shell
in form, viz. P. bilineata, Goldf., P. ( Murchisonia ) angulata, Phill., and
P. nerincea, Sandb.; but these shells possess a double line around the
middle of the whorls. The original Murchisonia angulata is figured
by Prof. Phillips in Pal. Foss. Dev. & Cornw. t. 39. no. 189 ; but we
cannot refer our shell to it. I have sought every source, but with-
out success, to find any shell agreeing with our (Queensland form.

Grifeituides dubius, Ether, PI. XVIII. fig. 7.
Body elongated, oval, length about twice the width, sides parallel.
Axis width of pleurae. Thoracic segments 10 to 12. Pygidium
rounded, margins entire; axis composed of 10 segments, not extending
quite to the posterior margin. Cephalic portion much crushed; gla-
bella small and round anteriorly, furrows indistinct.
Owing to the crustaceous test being removed, we have no means of
arriving at the condition of the original ornamentation; there are,
however, indications of tubercles upon the axis of the pygidium.
Ohs. It is difficult to say in the badly preserved condition of this
specimen whether it belongs to the genus Phillipsia or to Griffithides ,
the mutilation of the head preventing our seeing important characters.
I refer it, however, to Griffithides. This is the only Trilobite I have
ever seen from any of the Palaeozoic rocks of Australia younger than
Silurian. It much resembles our British forms, especially those of
the Carboniferous series ; and as the associated fauna is undoubtedly
of this age, we also assign G. dubius to the same horizon. This is
very distinct from the other genera of the Proetidae in the Silurian
rocks ; the moderate development of the cephalic shield, form of gla-
bella, and more elongated body separate it from any known Silurian
form.

the position of the anal adductor and the siphonal sinuses are nearly
at right angles to the length of the shell; these and the pallial sinus
are well marked.
Ohs. This shell appears to have attained to considerable dimen-
sions in the Australian Cretaceous seas, being much larger than the
Cyprina planata of the Lower Tertiaries of Britain and Efance.
In form and habit G. expansa is closely allied to C. planata, pos-
sessing also the compressed ventral border, deep lunule, and ex-
panded anterior or pedi-lateral margin. Of the many examples we


have of this species none possesses any shell-structure ; thgy occur

Obs. We possess only the cast of this shell; and had it been
found in the Cretaceous rocks of Britain we should have allied it to
Trigonia aloeformis , Park., or T. caudata, Ag.; our shell, however,
from the umbo to the ventral margin, is much higher or deeper
than either of the two forms referred to. We have no means of
ascertaining the ornamentation upon the shell, or Avhether it was
simply ribbed, or tuberculated. I am inclined to believe that the
concentric folds or ribs supported tubercles upon them, as in Tri-
gonia scabra and T. caudata. Only one specimen has occurred ; but
I unhesitatingly refer it to the Cretaceous deposits; it belongs to a
type not known in the Jurassic rocks, T. sanctce-crucis, Pictet and
Camp., much resembles this shell, C. L. Griesbach, Esq., describes
and figures a Trigonia, from the Umtamfuna river,-Natal, which has
an elongated posterior end and jn general shape and deltoid form is
much like our shell; want of external structure, however, prevents
our making further comparison.

no impression of pallial line visible; anterior slope appears to have
gaped for the passage of a byssus, as in Mytilus (but, possessing only one
valve, this may he doubtful ) ; ventral, margin broadly rounded and
flattened ; lateral margin slightly expanded; umbonal region very
deep. Although I have figured this cast, lam nevertheless at a loss
to know where to place it; I however refer it to the subgenus
Crenatula. The single muscular scar places it in the section
Asiphonida Integripallialia; one specimen only, and that a cast of
the right valve, occurs in the collection: our shell may have some
affinity with Pulvinites; but at present the nature of the hinge-line
and hinge-area is not known, I however suggest this.
Much interest is attached to this singular cast; and I trust our
figure will enable Australian collectors to furnish us with more
perfect specimens. I am disposed to regard it as a new genus ;
but the want of more evidence and better materials restricts me
from further description. Figure reduced

Genus ? PI. XIX. fig. 4.
Shell apparently smooth, semicircular, nearly equilateral, equi-


valve; umbones central, slightly acute and anterior; posterior and
ventral margins equally rounded and smooth ; hinge-line straight,
rounded at the angles, giving the shell an almost circular appearance.
Ohs. It is to be regretted that we have not a particle of the
original shell wherewith to recognize the nature of the markings, or
even the ventral margin to aid us in determining whether the inner
edge was crenulated or plain ; externally the shell appears to have
been smooth or delicately concentrically marked. The cast of the
hinge-line is such as to prevent our determining any teeth below the
junction of the two valves.
In outward form this shell much resembles Lucina ( Codallia )
joercrassa, Stol., from the Arrialoor Group (India) ; and the shell is
nearly equal in length to that of this species, but not so high. The
pallial line appears to be simple ; and the muscular impressions re-
semble those of Pectunculus. Some Axinece from the Indian Creta-
ceous rocks, but for their size, would very closely resemble this shell.

ings, if in the external shell, which they appear to be, remove
it from that species; in form, size, and habit, however, it closely

the valve, where the ribs (7 and 8) are all equal, and range from

Folkestone, also, from the Greensand of Plackdown. It may be the
Natica variahilis, Moore, figured as coming from the Wollumbilla

A variety of this common and well-known European shell is

pretend to define; and only a few other fossils occur or are asso-
ciated with it in the collection.
In Europe and Britain the type form is abundant in the Xeoco-
mian, Gault, and Upper Greensand beds.
Our shell is more acute than Sowerby?s typical form, the pos-
terior or anal border or extremity in this variety being less trun-
cated ; it however gapes as much. Ido not believe it is more than
a varietal form.

alternately broad and narrow, and unequal.
Obs. We possess only one specimen of this form ; and that includes
only about two thirds of the original shell, the ventral margin being
lost. In size and shape it somewhat resembles I. annulatus from
the White Chalk of Westphalia ; but the want of the true outer shell
prevents our referring it to that species, the equidistant lines of
growth in I. annulatus being characteristic and well defined.
Prof. M?Coy (Trans. Royal Soc. Victoria, vol. vii, 1866, p. 57)
describes a shell from the Flinders range, which he calls I. Suther-
landi, referring to it as having affinity with I. Cuvieri through
its concentric undulations, shape, and size, but having a more acute

With the exception of being more elongated than the shell de-

our shell appears to be the same species, allowing for those varia-
tions which the species in this genus exhibit. It is not so ventri-
cose a shell as I. striatus, Mant,, from the Lower Chalk of Sussex,

At first I was inclined to refer this shell to I. problematicus,

is also almost identical in shape with I. Lamarckii, I. latus, and
I. crispus, Mant.; but the concentric undulations are not so unequal
and pronounced, neither had this shell a corrugated and thickened
fold along the hinge-line as in I, Lamarckii ; the teeth or hinge-pits
are not seen. It is evident that this was an abundant species in
the Cretaceous seas of Queensland, its remains being numerous and
usually fragmentary.

Inoceramus allied to I. problematicus, D?Orb. PI. XXII. fig. 4.
Ref. Pal. Prang, vol. iii. p. 510, pi. 406.
I cannot see characters sufficiently good to distinguish specifically
this form of Inoceramus \ andwe have only one specimen. D Orbigny s
figures are variable enough to allow of any latitude in this species ;
and his figures 5 and 6 show characters occurring in our shell. I.
mytiloides, Sow., may be referred to as having considerable resem-
blance ; a large number of specimens, however, should be examined
before the species can be determined, where so much variation and
similarity exists.
Prof. M?Coy ( loc. cit. p. 50) has described an Inoceramus as I.
Carsoni, and states that it exactly resembles I. mytiloides, Sow.,
but has a longer hinge-line, more pointed anterior end, and more
obtuse superior posterior angle than Sowerby s species. I had, prior
to seeing Prof. M'Coy?s notice, referred this shell to I. mytiloides,
Sow.; but it has more affinity with I. problematicus, D?Orb.
Loc. Marathon station. Form. Cretaceous.
Crioceras or Ancyloceras.
There is not enough of this specimen to warrant its being figured ;
and what may have been the character of the outer shell has to be
determined. It is evident the species was large ; but whether to be
referred to Ancyloceras or Crioceras is even doubtful.
Mr. Moore, Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxvi. p. 257, t. 15. f. 3,
has described and figured a species of Crioceras from the Upper Ma-
ranoa district (E. Australia), which much resembles our specimen ;
his species, however, had an inner whorl, which determined the genus
to be Crioceras, through the non-involute condition of the coils. It is
difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the Queensland fossil
is an Ammonites, Crioceras, or Ancyloceras, My reason for venturing
to believe it to be Crioceras arises from the completeness of the
ventral surface of the whorl and what would appear to have been
a space between the first and second coil or whorl, now filled by the
matrix in which the shell is imbedded. Our shell must have been
of considerable size, measuring little less than 12 or 14 inches in
diameter, and the ribs faintly bifurcate from the centre of the whorl,
but without any tubercle at the point of bifurcation.


Ammonites Sutherlandi, Ether. Pi. XXI. fig. 4.
. Shell discoidal ; whorls three or four, with flattened sides, and
six or seven transverse wavy farrows on the outer whorl; these are
slightly inflected forwards on the sides of the shell, and pass over
the back at right angles to the keel; back sharply convex; the
surface of the shell appears to have been marked by, or ornamented
with, fine lines or striae apparently arranged at a different angle from
the sulci or furrows.
Lmbilicus small, well exposed, its walls rounded ; aperture oval,
elongated, or acutely ovate.
Ohs. A very small portion only of the shell remains upon the side
ot the outer whorl, between the last two sulci, and shows faintly the
fine undulating lines. The sutures are so indistinctly marked that
1 cannot refer them to any known species.
A. Sutherlandi has affinity with A. cassida, Raspail, from the
Xeocomian (Lycee, p. 115, no. 2; Ann. des Sc. d?Observation, t. iii.
pi. 11. f. 3); but the sulci or furrows are fewer and wider, and
the umbilicus smaller. Xone of the group Ligati, in the fine
Indian collection named and described by Eerd. Stoliczka (Mem.
Oreol. Surv. of India) affords any clue to the form from Queensland,
although some twenty-eight Indian species belong to this group.
Ihe smallness of the umbilical cavity and depth of the outer whorl re-
mote this form from any species with which we can ally or compare it.
I name this species after one of the earnest explorers of Queens-
land.
Ammonites Beudanti, Brongn., var. Mitchelli, Ether. PI. XXIII.
Shell discoidal, compressed, composed of four or five volutions or
whorls rapidly increasing; sides nearly flat, ornamented with gently
elevated undulating or sigmoidal ribs or folds bending towards the
aperture, and about half an inch apart on the middle of the whorl.
These and the interspaces are occupied by delicately arranged equi-
distant parallel lines or costse, which pass over the back; aperture oval,
back rounded and narrow, no keel; inner whorls exposed; walls of
umbilical cavity angular, flat-sided, or bevelled and smooth.
Ohs. This Ammonite, in its intermittent folds, involution of
whorls, and general habit much resembles A. Beudanti, D?Orb., from
all d aUlt � f England and France ? to which it is certainly closely
Since writing the above I have seen Prof. M?Coy?s description of
A. Flindersi. It agrees so closely with my own that I believe them
to be the same species. Xo figure accompanies M?Coy?s description,
which is to be regretted. Should, however, our shell he the
A. Flindersi of M?Coy, the above name must be abandoned, unless
M?Coy?s form is really the A. Beudanti, D?Orb. I name the varietal
orm after J. L, Mitchell, Esq., whose early labours, researches,
and travels in Australia deserve the highest consideration, Figure

Ammonites Dainteeei, Etheridge. PI. XXIV.
Shell discoidal; whorls depressed or flattened at the sides, with
a rather narrow rounded back. The sides of the shell ornamented
with numerous nearly equal and closely arranged ribs, all of which
are slightly arcuated and pass over the back or dorsal edge; um-
bilicus wide and deep, allowing half the inner whorls to be exposed ;
sides of the whorls around the umbilicus steep-sided, rounded, or
subangular; aperture broadly oval, the outer whorl embracing two
thirds of the next inner whorl. The ribs at the terminal portion of
the last or body-chamber are somewhat unequal and coarser.
Ohs. I have searched every available source for information rela-
tive to this shell, and cannot recognize any species approaching it in
the Cretaceous rocks of Europe, India, or America. It has some
affinity with A. asterianns, D?Orb., but wants the tubercle around
the umbilicus; and the ribs are greatly bent or slightly sigmoidal,
whereas in A. asterianus they are straight. It also resembles
some forms or varieties of A. Herveyi in the ribs, but is not so
tumid a shell. It occurs associated with A. Beudanti, D?Orb.,
Ancyloceras, and Inocerami in the Hughenden beds, which cer-
tainly appear to be Lower Cretaceous, or not younger than the
Gault; the scantiness of the known fauna, however, does not allow
us to assign the fossil remains to a definite horizon, such as Xeo-
comian or Gault. Figure reduced j.
Loc. Hughenden. Form. Lower Cretaceous.
Avicula hughendenensis, Ether. PI. XXY, fig. 3.
Shell oblique; umbones incurved; ears unequal; posterior ear
long, anterior short; cardinal line straight; ventral margin broadly
convex or rounded; surface of shell exhibiting a large number of
slightly wavy or undulating vertical ribs or costae, and many con-
centric undulating wavy folds, partly due to lines of growth ; an-
terior side slightly concave near the ear, afterwards becoming
curved and convex continuously with the base; surface highly polished
in all the specimens.
Ohs. This shell appears to have been very abundant and, perhaps,
gregarious, masses of them occurring together, forming a compact
and dense argillaceous limestone. I cannot refer it to any known
species.

Belemnites.
From Beleombe Creek, Black Downs, have been derived two, if


not three, species of Belemnites, all of them much broken. The
phragmocones in some cases are well preserved, and also the
alveolar cavities, with portions of the guard. These fragments
enable me to place them in the Middle or Upper Oolitic series. I
can hardly detect any difference between the Queensland specimen
and our B. abbreviatus from the Oxford Clay and Coral Hag, &c.
There is another specimen with a more slender phragmocone; but
the nature and size of the guard cannot be ascertained. We also
possess numerous broken fragments and longitudinal halves of
Belemnites which cannot be really determined.
Pleuroxomaria Cliftoni, Etheridge. PI. XXY. fig, 4.
Shell trochiform, spire elevated, apex acute, whorls 4-5, rapidly
increasing. Body-whorl large. Aperture large, and nearly round,
base convex. Columella thick, umbilicus apparently wanting or
very small.
Obs. The body-whorl is more than double the dimensions of the
preceding or fourth whorl, and proportionally much more globose,
and crossed diagonally by delicate lines of growth at an angle of
45�. The rather broad sinus occupies the upper half of the body-
whorl. I find great difficulty in referring this shell specifically to
any known British form. It, however, resembles Turbo (Pleuroto-
maria) Dunkeri, Goldf. from the Middle Lias.
We have only two specimens, which are associated with Myacites,
Homomya, and Pholadomya from the Oolitic deposits of Gordon
Downs.
I name this specimen after Mr, Clifton, who has thrown much
light upon the Mesozoic fossils of Australia.
Loc. Gordon Downs. Form. Oolite.
Homomya, Ag. PI. XXY. fig. 5.
We appear to possess two specimens of this subgenus of Phola-
domya. The absence of radiating costae, and the somewhat wrinkled
surface of the shell, as well as the position of the umbo and the gently
curved hinge-line, favour the view that the two casts belong to the
genus Homomya ; neither to Myacites nor to Pholadomya can they be
referred. I therefore place them with the above genus, and wait
the opportunity of examining better specimens.
These and the following specimens from Gordon Downs all occur
in a micaceous, sandy or arenaceo-calcareous Limestone. The matrix
resembles the Yorkshire deposits, and, like many of the organic re-
mains in that area, they possess no outer shell whatever; fragments
of wood occur also.
Loc. Gordon Downs. Form. Lower Oolite.
Pholadomya. PI. XXY. fig. 6.
Sufficient indications of the ribs remain on this single valve to
determine this cast to belong to the genus Pholadomya. The
2 b 2


hinge-line also and place of the hinge-area help us to assign this
to the genus named; the impressions of some eight or ten ribs
are distinguishable from the umbo to near the ventral margin of the
shell. I was in doubt as to whether the slightly intermittent lines
might not have represented the granulated surface or pitted struc-
ture of some Myacites ; I however refer it to the above genus.
Log. Gordon Downs. Form. Lower Oolite.
Myacites, sp. ? PI. XXY. fig. 7.
This widely distributed genus occurs in grey and red sandy
limestone at Gordon Downs; but I cannot specifically name either
of the specimens in the collection: they are merely casts, and may
be referred to many such occurring in the Lower Oolitic rocks of
Britain; they are associated with other forms occurring in the
Inferior Oolite of Europe. Externally the casts resemble those of
Myacites tenuistriatus and M. recurvus; and a portion of the shelly
structure remaining appears to be the same. It is essential that
these forms should be mentioned and figured, owing to their position ;
and they are undoubtedly of the age assigned to them, whatever
relation the deposits may have to those of Europe in time.
Log. Gordon Downs. Form. Lower Oolite.
Myacites allied to M. tenuistriatus.
In the absence of all other evidence I refer this cast to the above
species; in all essential particulars it is that to which we refer
those forms in our own Oolitic rocks that have been denuded of
their shell, and which, by close comparison, agree with the known
determined species.
Log. Gordon Downs. Form. Lower Oolite.
Tancbedia, sp. ? PL XXY. fig. 8.
The subequilateral, transverse, and donaciform shape of this cast can
only, I think, be referred to the genus Tancredia, Lycett ( Hettangia,
Terquem). No teeth, true hinge-line, or entire pointed anterior
extremity are seen; but the aspect of the shell favours this belief.
It, however, resembles some forms of Corhis. It may be referred to
C. ( Corbiella ) hathonica, Lycett. Like the other casts from the
Lower Oolite they are named to draw the attention of Queensland
geologists to the Gordon-Downs fossils.
Log. Gordon Downs. Form. Lower Oolite.
Note. ?Since my Appendix has been in type I have examined
another large series of fossils from Queensland, forwarded by Mr.
William Hann. Nearly the whole are Cretaceous, and agree in facies
with the Marathon and Hughenden series just described. The lo-
calities from which they are derived are Bowen Downs, head of
Thompson River, Tower Hill, and Barcoo-River beds near Tambo.
The fossils from Bowen Downs occur in lat. 23� S. and long. 145� E.


They evidently belong to the same series, or are upon the same
horizon, with the Marathon beds described in Mr. Daintree?s paper.
The specimens from Thompson River greatly resemble those species
occurring in the Hughenden beds. The Tower-Hill fossils, from lat.
22� S., long. E., appear to be reassorted, and may have been
laid down under freshwater or estuarine conditions. Vast numbers
of Belemnites, with siliceous pebbles in a calcareous matrix, all rolled
together, make up the chief mass of this rock.
The Barcoo-River beds (lat. 24� 50', long. 146� 25') near Tambo
are certainly of the same date as the Marathon Ammonites of the
Group Ligati (Am. Sutherlandi). North of Barcoo River (lat. 22� 40',
long. 144� 50'), we possess specimens from a well 100 feet deep;
these bear the appearance of Gault forms, and resemble the normal
condition of that deposit in England and France. 'Ward-River
group, head of Warragoo, are conglomerates of doubtful age. Again,
at the Barcoo river, fifty miles below the junction with the Alice
river, Inocerami occur, which appear to me to be Gault.
These interesting fossils will receive further elucidation; it was,
however, deemed of sufficient interest to thus notice their occurrence,
which bears out geographically the distribution of the Cretaceous
series previously noticed in the body of the Appendix, and confirms
the view taken of the great westerly extension of the Cretaceous
rocks through the plains of Queensland, thus perhaps accounting
for the universally and widely spread level land in the western
plains.

Notes on Fossil Plants from Queensland , Australia. By William
Carrtjthers, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S., Keeper of the Botanical De-
partment in the British Museum.
The fine series of Lepidodendroid remains from the Old Red
Sandstone rocks are perhaps the most important group of fossil
plants which Mr. Daintree has brought from Queensland. They
supply the means of restoring a remarkable plant in all its parts,
fragments only of which have been hitherto known, and these have
been misunderstood and misinterpreted. Further, they clear up the
reports that have at times been circulated as to the occurrence of a
Lepidodendron in the Australian coal-beds, which Mr. Keene affirmed


he had seen, and on which the Rev. W. B. Clarke depended to some
extent to establish the palaeozoic age of the coal. It is true that
the investigations of Prof. M?Coy established that Mr. Clarke?s
Lepidodendron did not belong to the Coal-beds; but we are now, at
least in this country, supplied for the first time with the materials
for clearing up the history and adding something to our knowledge
of this plant.
Unger was the first to describe this platit, in his memoir on the
flora of the Upper Devonian beds of Thuringia (Denkschr. Akad.
Wissen. Wien, vol. xi. (1856) p. 175, tab. x. f. 4-8). He figures
the terminal fragment of a branch, four inches long and half an inch
broad at its lower end. The piece is thick and blunt at the apex,
and is covered with spirally arranged somewhat obsolete cicatrices
of the leaves. The outer surface of the branch is shown only on
the lower third of the specimen ; and there the leaf-scars are seen to
he contiguous and rhombic. The specimen was so well preserved
as to exhibit the internal structure, which is figured, and agrees, as
Unger says, very closely with that of Lepidodendron Harcourtii,
Witham.
In 1860 Prof. Dawson published his first account of the Devonian
plants of Canada ; and he figured some fragments to which he gave
the name of Lepidodendron gaspianum (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc,
vol. xv. p. 483, fig. 3). One of the figures shows the surface to be
marked with rhombic leaf-scars ; and these are still more manifest in
the illustrations to a subsequent memoir (Quart. Journ. vol. xviii.
(1862) pi. xvii. f. 68), and in his Acadian Geology (p. 542, fig.
189 a). These show besides the impression of the vascular bundle
in the centre of the rhombic scar.
For another fragment of what I believe to be the same plant,
Prof. Dawson in the memoir just referred to (I. c. vol. xviii. p. 316)
proposed a new genus, Leptophloeum, characterized by the stems
having thin bark and a very large pith-cylinder with transverse
markings of the character of Sternbergia. A specimen is figured
(Z. c. pi. xvii. fig. 53), which shows, according to the author, ? a
growth of young wood at the extremity of the stem, on which the
rhombic scars are only imperfectly developed ; and at the extremity
of this younger portion the transverse structure of the pith exhibits
itself through the thin bark in such a manner that this portion, if
separated from the remainder of the stem, might be described as a
Sternbergia?
In the following year Prof. Dawson described what he believed to
be the foliage and fruit of this plant, in a further contribution to the
Canadian Devonian plants (I. c. vol. xix. (1863) p. 462), and he
gives in plate xviii. fig. 19 a restoration of the plant exhibiting
these additions. As, however, he omits all notice of these parts in
his recent memoir on Pre-Carboniferous floras (18/1), it may be
supposed that he is not satisfied as to this correlation of the dif-
ferent parts.
This historical account supplies also a statement of what is known
regarding this plant.


The large series of specimens belonging to Mr. Daintree, as well
as those already in the Museum of the Geological Society, are all
merely casts, generally in a finely grained rock, which must have
been deposited as a very fine mud, as it has insinuated itself between
the leaves, filling up every crevice, and preserving the parts, allowing
for the compression they have received in the compacting of the
beds, in their natural relations. Sometimes the interior of the stem
is filled with the amorphous material of the rock, and exhibits on
both its surfaces the leaf-scars as in fig. 9 of Plate XXYI. and in
several large trunks.
Lepidodendron nothum , Ung., had for its roots a Stigmaria
which cannot be separated from S.Jtcoides. The actual connexion
of the stem with the roots is not shown in any of the specimens ; but
that this is their relation cannot be doubted, as these are almost the
only fossils found in the beds, and certainly the only ones that could
be thus related.
The leaf-scars vary considerably in size in different parts of the
stem, and when not affected by pressure are rhombic in form. The
largest scars are shown in fig. 12 (PI. XXYI.); and these are without
any scar from the vascular bundle. This scar is generally present, but
it does not always occupy the same position in the larger leaf-scar;
sometimes it is in the centre, as in fig. 10 ; sometimes at the apex,
as in figs. 8 and 11; and in others it gives a longitudinal impres-
sion extending from nearly the bottom to the top of the scar (fig. 9).
This is as might have been expected, seeing that the small scar is
produced by a portion of the tissue which was more persistent than
the parenchyma that surrounded it, and which was able to offer
some resistance to the soft mud that filled the decayed cavity of the
stem. The direction of this vascular bundle was upwards and out-
wards from the vascular cylinders, as in other Lepidodendrons, and
as is shown in Unger?s specimens, Preed from the surrounding
cellular tissue, but yet attached to the vascular cylinder at the one
end and to the indurated cicatrix at the other, it might retain its
position in the centre of the scar, or be carried to one or the other
end of it by the pressure of the invading mud, according to the direc-
tion in which the mud came, or might even be pressed against the
cicatrix throughout a considerable portion of its length. It is thus
obvious that the position of the scar and the presence of a furrow
introduced by Dr. Dawson into his diagnosis of the genus and species
are of no value.
The form of the leaf-scar is also liable to considerable variation
from pressure. Two such forms are given in figs. 13 and 14.
The increase in the size of the scars in proportion to the dimen-
sions of the stems on which they are borne, may be traced in the
figures 7,8, 9,10,11 and 12. In the first three of these figures the scars
are suddenly flattened, and pass into subtriangular and ultimately
into narrow linear scars. This condition Dr. Dawson considers due
to the large Sternhergia-g\ih showing through the thin bark; but
it is really owing to the incomplete development of the bases of the
leaves. There has been an interruption to the growth where the


rhombic scars stop. Below this line I have not been able to detect
the trace of leaves in the matrix ; but above in the growing apices of
the branches the leaves are abundant (fig. 1). The leaves are very
small and peltate, with roundish petioles as long as the leaf
itself. The petiole was placed at right angles to the stem, and was
attached to the lamina of the leaf about one third up from its lower
edge. The larger upper portion of the leaf overlapped the lower
portion of that above it, so that externally the branch was com-
pletely hidden by the covering of peltate, imbricate, and pedicellate
leaves. In the slender and dichotomously divided branch (fig. 7),
the leaves seem to have been ordinary leaves; but in the thicker
and simple branch represented at fig. 1, a slight protuberance,
which can be detected on the middle of several of the petioles, indi-
cates, as it seems to me, that these were fruit-bearing. The re-
semblance these leaves bear to the fruit-bearing leaves of modern
Lycopods is apparent from a comparison of fig. 5, representing
Lycopodium Gayanum, Brongn., with the fossil, fig. 6,
The identity of this plant with Dr. Dawson?s LeptophlceurA rhom-
hicum cannot be doubted; and the propriety of giving up the long,
parallel-sided, and one-nerved leaves, and the strobiles borne on the
sides of the branches, as I suppose he has done*, is thus fully
justified.
Several specimens of the Ahorrm-condition of preservation of this
plant are to be found in Mr. Daintree?s collections. Inasmuch as
the internal constitution of the stems of many of the more frequent
Lycopodiaceous stems of palaeozoic rocks was similar, it is impossible
to discover in the accidental appearance of their internal and amor-
phous casts any characters which would justify our establishing them
as species, or would enable us to refer them to a known species, in
the interior of which they may have been formed. It is only in cases
like the present, where but one species is found with the Knorria-
casts to which they can belong, that certainty can be attained.
I may close this account by a more exact specific diagnosis supplied
by the materials which I have now described.

Wissen. Wien, math.-natur. Cl. vol. xi. (1856) p. 175, pi. x.

Scars of the leaves contiguous, rhombic, with a single and gene-
rally central vascular scar; leaves small, peltate and imbricate, on
long slender petioles; fruit produced on the apices ot the thick
branches, a single sporangium, almost sessile, borne on the middle of
the petiole of the leaf; roots stigmarioid.
The geographical distribution of this plant is remarkable. Dr.
Dawson?s figure leaves no doubt as to the identity ot the Canadian
and Australian plants, as far as the small fragments found in Canada
enable one to come to a positive decision; and the same may be
said of Unger?s specimen from Germany. But this only confirms
* Compare Dawson in Quart. Journ. Geol, Soc. (1863) vol. xix. p. 462, with
his ? Pre-Carboniferous Floras ? (1871).


?what has already been remarked in regard to the wide range of the
Palaeozoic plants.
I have previously recorded a species of Lepidodendron from South
Africa, which cannot be separated from a common British species,
and a species of Flemingites from South Brazil, closely allied to that
of our own Coal-measures.
There is a small group of Lepidodendra in the Coal-measures,
which by the form of their scars are closely related to this Devonian
species. Indeed there are no characters in the portions yet known
of them which justify their separation specifically from the Devo-
nian plant. It cannot be doubted, however, that this is the result
of our imperfect knowledge of these plants. The group I refer to
is that for which Presl proposed the generic name Bergeria (Stern-
berg, Flora Yorw. vol. ii. p. 184); and if a new generic name is
required to separate them from Lepidodendron proper, this, of course,
must be adopted. We may add to the forms enumerated by Presl
as belonging to this group the two following fossils ; ? Lepidophloios
tetragonus, Dawson, and Lepidodendron tetragonum, Geinitz (non
Sternb.).
Among the Devonian fossils presented by the Rev. W. B. Clarke
to the Society?s Museum, there is a fragment of a Lepidodendroid
plant which I cannot separate from that found at Kiltorkan, to
which Dr. Haughton gave the name of Sigillaria dichotoma, and after-
wards of Cyclostigma HltorJcense, and which, after receiving many
other aliases, should be named, I believe, Syringodendron dicho-
tomum, it being a species of that genus as amended by Brongniart in
his ? Histoire,? and again in his ? Tableau.?
A small fragment in Mr. Daintree?s collection seems to indicate a
third species of Lepidodendron, allied to if not identical with Sage-
naria obovata, Eichwald. I cannot, however, be certain, from the
single specimen, whether the markings are on the surface of the
stem, and so sufficient to warrant its specific determination.
Portions of the rachis of a fern like those to which Baily has given
the name of Filicites lineatus, and fragments of a Calamites (it may
be C. radiatus, Brongn.), complete the list of Mr, Daintree?s Devo-
nian plants.
The remaining fossil plants Mr. Daintree refers to two horizons,
the older characterized by the presence of Glossopteris Browniana,
Brongn., and the younger by Tceniopteris Daintreei, M?Coy.
Glossopteris Browniana has been so frequently described and
figured, that I find nothing additional worth recording from an
examination of Mr. Daintreo?s specimens, unless it be that one
shows some indications of fruit in the form of linear sori running
along the veins, and occupying a position somewhat nearer to the
margin of the frond than to the midrib.
In addition to the species which I have described and figured,
there are associated with Glossopteris fragments of a small species
of Schizopteris, apparently bearing fruit on the apex of the truncate

segments ; but the only specimen is too imperfect to justify giving it
a specific name. The same may be said of a small but well-marked
frament of Pecopteris, consisting of portions of two pinnae allied to
P. australis, Morris, but certainly different, as well as cf a Cydo-
pteris in Keene?s collections in the Geological Society?s Museum.
In Mr. Daintree?s upper horizon we find the following plants:?

leaving it at an acute angle, then passing out at right angles to the
margin, once or twice dichotomously divided.
Loc. Tivoli Coal-mine.
Cvclopteris ctjneata, sp. nov, PL XXVII. fig. 5.
Form of the entire frond unknown ; pinnae entire, large, cuneate,
narrowed at the base, with the distal margins rounded; veins
delicate, once or twice dichotomously divided; sometimes anasto-
mosing once in their length near the middle of the pinna.
Notwithstanding the slight anastomosis of the veins, these separate
pinme, which are not very frequent, represent a very distinct species
of the genus Cydopteris.
Loc. Tivoli Coal-mine.
Sphenopteris elongata, sp. Nov. PL XXVII. fig. 1.
Frond dichotomously divided, each division irregularly pinnate;
pinnae simple, bifurcate, or irregularly pinnate; segments narrow,
linear, slightly tapering upwards to the somewhat blunt apex; the
single midrib sending out simple branches, which run along the
middle of each segment.
With Pecopteris odontopteroides, Morris, this is one of the most
abundant forms. Some specimens have small oval markings scat-
tered irregularly on either side of the midrib. These probably
indicate the form and position of the sori, which are the same as in
some of the simple linear species of Polypodium.
Loc. Tivoli Coal-mine.
Pecopteris odontopteroides, Morris, in Strzelecki?s ? New South
Wales,? p. 249, pi. vi. figs. 2-4. PL XXVII. figs. 2 and 3,
Frond, with a very short and thick stipes, dichotomously divided,
the simple portion at the base of the frond as well as each branch
pinnatifid ; the segments more or less opposite, quadrate-ovate, with
the apex obliquely truncate, connate at the base ; one vein passing
into the centre of the segment and repeatedly dichotomous, several
lateral veins, simple or dichotomous, passing direct from the rachis
into the upper and under portions of the segment.
In the form of the segment our plant differs _ considerably from
the specimens figured and described by Prof. Morris. It nevertheless
belongs, I believe, to the same species. lam able to describe and


figure the venation, which is well marked in several of the speci-
mens. The dichotomous division of the frond is not sufficient to
justify Prof. M?Coy?s transference of this form to Gleichenites, with
which in other respects it has no affinity whatever.
Loc. Tivoli Coal-mine.
Cardiocarpum aijstrale. sp. Nov. PI. XXYII. fig. 4.
Fruit cordate, with an acute apex, and a ridge running along one
side of the fruit within and parallel to the edge; seed ovate, acute.
Loc. Tivoli Coal-mine.
With these are fragments of several plants, but too imperfect
to permit their description as new species, or their reference with
certainty to known species. Amongst them may he noted a narrow
linea Troeniopteroid frond, with ascending dichotomous veins, like
Pecopteris (?) salicifolia from India, a Tceniopteris with simple
veins passing out at right angles from the midrib, a before notified
Pecopteris allied to P. indica, and a Sphenopteris with linear segments
to the pinnae.
These plants do not supply any additional data to those already
known for determining the age of the beds in which they occur, and
consequently of the coal associated with them. My investigation
of the forms induces me to consider both series of nearly the same
age, and to agree with Morris, M?Coy, Bunbuy, and Zigno in the
opinion that they belong to the Oolitic period.

Mr. Etheridge mentioned that, among the fossil Mollusca exhibited
from Queensland, there were about eighty species in all, thirty-nine
of which were new. About twelve species were also found in the
British area, some of them being of common occurrence in both
countries. This was especially the case in the Palaeozoic rocks,
but also prevailed to a considerable extent in those of the Creta-
ceous period. The same similarity among fossils so widely sepa-
rated in space was found among the fossil corals of Queensland and
those of Europe. It was to be regretted that so many of the fossils
are merely casts; but he still thought that they were capable of
being properly figured, and the species determined.
Mr. Carruthers had examined the vegetable remains brought
over by the author, which were of great importance. Some of those
from the Devonian rocks appeared to be identical with species found
in North America. From the remains of one of these, which he
could not separate from one described by Dr. Dawson, Leptophlceum
rhombicum, he had been able to reconstruct it in its entirety, of
which he exhibited a drawing. The plant was lyeopodiaceous ; and
its remains served to show that erroneous conclusions had been
drawn as to the characters presented by the North-American spe-
cimens, which had been regarded as having a Sternbergia-pith.
There were specimens also of Cyclostigma, of the stipes of ferns,
and of a doubtful Calamite, With regard to the supposed Glos-
sopteris- and Tceniopteris-e pochs, which by some had been regarded
the one as Palaeozoic and the other as Mesozoic, he was not convinced
that they could be distinctly separated, but thought rather that
they might both belong to different portions of one great period.
Systematically the two forms might be very closely related, the vena-
tion of the fronds on which the genera are founded occurring in two
forms, which by Linnaeus had been included in one genus, Acrosti-
chum. He thought that neither was of a date earlier than Permian.
Mr. Smyth regretted that so many questions were brought forward


in the paper that it was almost impossible to follow the whole of
them. The connexion of the gold-bearing reefs with the igneous
rocks seemed to him very remarkable. It had in former times been
suggested that there was some limitation of auriferous deposits to
Palaeozoic rocks, and he wished to know whether the author?s ob-
servations corroborated such a view, which appeared to him pro-
blematical. He commented on the value of foreign collections of
fossils such as that exhibited, and called attention to the rich stores
of that kind preserved in the museum of the Society, which would
be found of great assistance by any one studying the geology of
Australia.
Mr. Daintree, in reply, stated that in the West-Maitland beds
Olossopteris was found distinctly underlying beds containing Spirifera
and other distinctly Carboniferous species. He had no doubt of Glos-
sopteris being in Queensland a purely Palaeozoic form. He had been
unable to trace any igneous action whatever over the whole of the
cretaceous plains to the westward; and the absence of igneous or
metamorphic rocks was further proved by the natives having to
obtain the materials for their tomahawks by exchange from those
nearer the coast. In the proximity of the dykes he had not found
any signs of alteration of structure; but the occurrence of gold in
the Devonian area was, according to his experience, limited to the
close neighbourhood of the dykes.
Prof. Ramsay remarked on the Desert Sandstone, and pointed out
that, though stratigraphically of such importance, the amount of geo-
logical time it represented was probably but small. The changes, how-
ever, of which it bore evidence since Miocene times, were enough
to strike the mind with astonishment, and to convey some idea of
the great variations in the physical features of the surface of the
world, even within the period during which possibly the human
race had existed.
