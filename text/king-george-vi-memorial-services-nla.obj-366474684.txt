THE INVOCATION
HYMN —“0 Worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness.”
O Worship the Lord in the Beauty of
Holiness !
Fear not to enter His courts in the
slenderness
Bow Down before Him, His Glory
Proclaim :
Of the poor wealth thou would’st
reckon as thine :
With gold of obedience and incense of
lowliness.
Truth in its beauty and love in its
tenderness :
Kneel and adore Him, the Lord is
His name.
These are the offerings to lay on His
Shrine.
Low at His feet lay thy burden of
carefulness.
High on His heart He will bear it for
thee,
Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy
prayerfulness,
Guiding thy steps as may best for thee
be.
These, though we bring them in
trembling and fearfulness.
He will accept for the Name that is
Dear ;
Mornings of joy give for evenings of
tearfulness,
Trust for our trembling, and hope for
our fear.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of
Holiness !
Bow down before Him, His glory
proclaim ;
With gold of obedience and incense of
lowliness.
Kneel and adore Him, the Lord is His
name.

Worship
HYMN —“The King of Love my Shepherd is”
The King of love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never ;
I nothing lack if I am His
And He is mine for ever.
Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth,
And where the verdant pastures grow
With food celestial feedeth.
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed ;
But yet in love He sought me,
And on His shoulder gently laid.
And home rejoicing brought me.
PRAYERS
In death’s dark vale I fear no ill
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me,
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
Thy cross before to guide me.
Thou spreadst a table in my sight;
Thy unction grace bestoweth ;
And O what transport of delight
From Thy j3ure chalice fioweth !
And so through ail the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never ;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy
praise
Within Thy house for ever !
Henry Williams Baker.
PERIOD OF SILENT COMMEMORATION
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. (One Verse)
THE OFFERING.
HYMN —-“0 Love of God, How Strong and True”
0 love of God, how strong and true ;
Eternal, and yet ever new ;
Uncomprehended and unbought,
Beyond all knowledge and all thought !
0 heavenly Love, how precious still,
In days of weariness and ill.
In nights of pain and helplessness.
To heal, to comfort, and to bless !
0 wide-embracing, wondrous Love,
We read Thee in the sky above ;
We read Thee in the earth below,
In seas that swell and streams that flow.
We read Thee best in Him who came
To bear for us the cross of shame,
Sent by the Father from on high.
Our life to live, our death to die.
We read Thy power to bless and save
E’en in the darkness of the grave ;
Still more in resurrection light
We read the fulness of Thy might.
O love of God, our shield and stay
Through all the perils of our way ;
Eternal Love, in Thee we rest.
For ever safe, for ever blest.


HYMN—“Abide With Me”
1
Abide with me ! fast falls the eventide ;
The darkness deepens ; Lord, with me
abide !
When other helpers fail, and comforts
flee,
Help of the helpless, 0 abide with me !
2
3
I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the
tempter’s power ?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can
be ?
Through cloud and sunshine, 0 abide
with me !
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little
day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass
away ;
Change and decay in all around I see :
O Thou who changest not, abide with
me !
4
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitter-
ness :
Where is death’s sting ? where, grave,
thy victory ?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me !
SERMON
Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes,
Shine through the gloom, and point mo
to the skies ;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s
vain shadows flee :
In life and death, O Lord, abide with
Henry Francis Lyte.
