There are times when it is not an easy job for a
workman to get up to his work, especially with
respect to plumbers, gasfitters, slaters, shinglers,
and other outdoor mechanics; and it is the same in
manufacturing. There are those who know as
much about the business they run as a mule knows
about the Chinese question. But
WE KNOW NOTHING
about anything else, comparatively speaking, but
how to MAKE BOOTS AND SHOES; and in this

In order to accommodate Theatre goers living in the

“ What’s in a name ? ” growled the
Hon. William Shakespeare, as he and
Colonel Francis Bacon were discussing
things one evening in the Dew Drop Inn.
“ Several volumes,” replied Bacon, in
a prescient tone, which indicated that he
had visions of Ignatius Donnelly.
In China two people of the same sur-
name are forbidden to intermarry. That
must be hard on the Chinese Smith
family.
“ I trust your husband had something
saved up for a rainy day,” said a
sympathising Mend. “ Indeed he had.”
replied the widow, with a fresh burst ot
tears; “He had seven umbrellas. Job a
was the thriftiest man I ever knew.”
Thus an American paper . The tele-
graph companies of Australia suffer a
good deal from the fondness of the
natives for bracelets and ear and nose
rings made of telegraph wire.” All this
statement, by the way, is true, except
that there are no telegraph companies in
Australia, and that the few stray aborig-
inals to be found near telegraph lines
never dream even remotely of touching
the wires. The remainder of the state-
ment is quite correct, that is, if there is
any remainder.

“ Colonel,” said the distinguished
Kentuckian’s northern visitor, “ I have
noticed that when you take your first drink
of whisky in the morning, or at noon, or in
the evening, or, in fact, at any other time,
you always take two more almost im-
mediately afterwards. Isn’t one at a
time enough to satisfy you ? ”
“ One would be plenty to satisfy me,
sah,” the colonel replied. “It isn’t my-
self, sah, that I considab, sah, when I take
the second drink. I take the second to
keep the first from getting lonesome,
sah.”
“ Oh, I see. That’s very considerate
of you. And how about the third ? ”
“Well, sah, wheah two are gathered
together theah may be disputes. So I
take the thuhd in ohder, sah, that theah
shall be an ahbitratah handy in case of
trouble.”

large interests in the Australian colonies, have
received letters of appointment as Purveyors of
Wines and Spirits to Her Majesty the

H.R.H. the Prince of Wales.
Messrs. Gilbey, who are proprietors of the
Chateau Londume Vineyard, in the Medoc

at the Paris Exhibition for claret produced on

He’d Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russell;
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
mght, and is credited to W. W. Dudley.
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe. On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his-
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
“ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”

Story or a Djamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wif#->
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in-
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if*
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made-
in three months’ time. »It was ordered*
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps;;
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was;
in what our contemporaries call “ high-
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball Sitting in her box, resplendent:
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportorial description the following day*
in the chief paper of the city.—“ New-
York Press.”
