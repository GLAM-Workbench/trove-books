(The third verse of this hymn, by John Wesley, was chosen by John
Lees for his gravestone.)
Thou hidden source of calm repose,
Thon all-sufficient Love Divine,
My help and refuge from my foes,
Secure I am, if Thou art mine;
And, lo! from sin, and grief, and shame,
I hide me, Jesus, in Thy name.
Thy mighty name salvation is,
And keeps my happy soul above;
Comfort it brings, and power, and
peace,
And joy, and everlasting love;
To me, with Thy dear name, are given
Pardon, and holiness, and heaven.
Jesus, my all in all Thou art;
My rest in toil, my ease in pain,
The medicine of my broken heart,
In war my peace, in loss my gain,
My smile beneath the tyrant's frown,
In shame my glory and my crown.
In want, my' plentiful supply,
In weakness my almighty power,
in bonds my perfect liberty’,
My light in Satan’s darkest hour,
In grief my joy’’ unspeakable,
My life in death, my heaven in hell.

HYMN 812.
O, Cod. our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.
Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone,
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the x-ising sun.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away,
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
O, Cod, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while life shall last,
And our perpetual home.

JOHN LEES.
The Story of a Remarkable Life
Pioneer, Soldier and Settler
A Glimpse at the Early History of Australia

In this narrative Mr. Roberts entertainingly sketches the life of the man
who gave the first acre of land owned by the Methodist Church of Anstra l asm
and erected thereon the first Wesleyan Chapel in the Southern Hemisphere
The Church at Castlereagh as it was in 1847, with the old chapel, which, was
opened an 1817 alongside to the south.

JOHN LEES
CHAPTER I.—WHY THE PILGRI-
MAGE?
“The Great Pilgrimage to the Mecca
of Australian Methodism,” as our Pre-
sident was pleased to call it, and as it
is advertised, has prompted the inquiry
by not a few; “What is it all about?”
Well, they are going to remove the
remains of John Lees and his wife,
Mary Lees, from the old cemetery at
Lower Castlereagh, and have them re-
interred in the Methodist Ceme-
tery at Castlereagh, alongside the
church, and place them among other
members of his numerous family that
lie in that “consecrated acre,” as
James Colwell calls it in his history.
“Poor fellow! Why not let him lie
in peace? What has lie done to disturb
him after so long?” asked another.
Well, you see, that’s just the reason.
It is not a very peaceful place, away
in the bush, where once a garden
smiled, and where now the bush-fires
almost annually crack the crumbling
gravestones, and where the vestages of
a deserted village are fast fading away.
It would be rank folly to piece a me-
morial to anyone away there, where
only the antiquary goes to disturb the
wild rabbits, while he studies quaint
epitaphs. Memorials are for people,
not ’possums, and should be erected
where folk foregather in a meditative
mood, and not Where bunnies burrow in
quiet seclusion.
It was, perhaps, because he lies buried
in the bush that there has not been
any column trophied for triumphal
show; but the opportunity has come
now, and the trustees of the < !astle-
reagh Methodist Church have resolved
to appeal to Australian Methodism not to
let this opportunity pass without plac-
ing a permanent memorial to the nonor
of one who cannot be separated’ from
the early history of Australian Metho-
dism, and whose life and character ar •
so well worth remembering.
This is so fitting a duty that it was
proposed to have it done when the
centenary celebrations were carried out
In but there were so many difu
culties in the way that it was aban-
doned.
Now the Board of Health has granted
t\ie necessary permission for the ex-
humation, which is to be done under
police supervision, and the remains
have to be sealed in a metal casket
before leaving the old resting-place.
The Rector of Emu Plains has kindly
consented, and his Grace the Arch-
bishop of Sydney has given his permis-
sion for the removal, and a number of
the numerous family of which John
Lees was the patriarch, are undertak-
ing the solemn duty of placing their
forebears in the Consecrated Acre they
themselves dedicated to God, while the
trustees ask Methodists everywhere to
help place a memorial in the church
worthy of the occasion.
‘ ‘ But will there be any remains after
eighty-six years?” some have asked.
Well, there’s a headstone and a foot-
stone, strangely engraved, of which I
shall say more anon, which are to
stand on a more conspicuous as
well as a very sacred position.
Besides, the thing which remains of a
godly character or a hero of the past
is not the dust that returns to the
earth so much as the impression left
on the living minds of those who fol-
low after. To live in the memory of
those who love and admire us is not
to die, and John Lees would be loved
and admired by every Methodist if
they only knew about him.
There is not so much concern about
the exhumation of the mortal remains
of John and Mary Lees as there is in
the resurrection of a memory that
should be kept living in the hearts of
all who love the power of Redeeming
Grace, and who are glad to know of the
reclamation of a sinning soldier into
a great-hearted and noble and love-
able character.
So we go to Castlereagh on October
loth, 1921, just one hundred years after
the legal conveyance of the lirst land
held by the Methodist Church of Aus-
tralia, and place a tablet in grateful
memory of the one who helped to make
Methodism possible in this sunny
southern continent.
CHAPTER lI.—A DRUNKUN CORPS
—SOLDIERS AND CONVICTS.
John Lees was a soldier; one of the
famous (or was it infamous?) second
New South Wales Corps. .
Everyone known? the story of the sol-
diers in Australia, and the need for
them in the establishing of the first
3


settlement here —how the American
Vvar of Independence prevented Eng-
land from sending any more of her
criminal population ever there, and
hew a project was entered upon with
but scant notice by the public, and
little concern of the Parliament of Eng-
land, to send some of those whom they
did not know how to provide for to the
newly-diseovered Botany !Jay.
In the year 1786 the Eirst Fleet,
which we now spell with capitals, was
organised to provide “a mere substi-
tute for hulks and penitentiaries.” The
only reference to it in official docu-
ments, apart from that of the expedi-
tion itself, is a paragraph m the King’s
speech at the opening of Parliament on
January 23rd, 1787, just before the
Fleet started, and a year before it ar-
rived in Port Jackson.
The equipment seemed to have been
almost entirely in the hands of Captain,
afterwards Governor, Phillip.
Soldiers were, as a matter of course,
needed for the control of these con-
victs, for some of them, even with over-
sight, had mutinied and tried to get
possession of the ship, but they did not
know how unarmed the guard actually
was.
In the preparation the soldiers who
set out for Australia went without
ammunition. “We have neither musquet
balls nor paper for musquet cartridges,
nor have we any armourers’ tools to
keep small arms in repair, ’ ’ Phillip
discovered, and wrote when he was at
sea.
But the First Fleet put in at Rio
de Janeiro, and among other thmgs
took on “One hundred and fifteen pipes
of rum.”
There wore other things they shipped
there, such as orange pips, gathered by
Richard Johnson, the chaplain, which
brought a little sweetness to the settle-
ment, usually left our, in records of this
expedition. But that shipment of rum
is necessary to our story here.
It had been difficult for Phillip to
gather sufficient soldiers of the right
character to assist him. The British
officers generally did not care to under-
take such an undesirable work. Those
w r ho came demanded a year’s pay iu
advance, and the story of their rebellion
against authority, their conspiracies for
the degrading of the convicts and theft
of the scant provisions, planning only
the enrichment of themselves, form one
of the saddest annals of Australian
history.
The behaviour of the convicts has
been noted in our histories as repre-
hensible, but the conduct of the soldiers
and their officers is sad reading.
“They stubbornly declined to interfere
with the convicts or encourage them
to well-doing,” as “they were only on
garrison duty.” “They nightly plund-
dered the gardens which provided the
settlement with vegetables,” while
discussing among themselves the accur-
acy of the descent of the cat-o’-nine-
tails on the back of a convict, by which
they could flay the skin from the shoul-
der to the buttock, in one, two or
three hundred lashes, and how there
was no feeling left after the flesh ap-
peared.
They would not work themselves,
though there was a time when the set-
tlement was on the verge of starvation,
and they made rnm the means of ex-
change and the basis of all barter.
The only one who seemed to raise
his voice against this was the quiet,
unassuming,, spiritually-minded, de-
spised chaplain (“One of the People
Called Methodists,” they sneered), who
went on quietly sowing and cultivating
his orange pips and slipping in here
and there seeds of other sweetness and
beauty, the only bit of goodness in the
community, and that so despised, even
until to-day, that there is no public
monument to his memory, nor place to
which his name is given.
“Kissing Point,” they called his
home, which does really suggest some-
thing in contrast to “Gallows Hill,”
and which is outlasting the latter.
Into this environment came John
Lees. As to when Mary Lees, his wife,
came out we are not sure. The wives
•were not allowed to accompany their
husbands.
One brave woman did ship unknown
as an ordinary sailor, but she was sent
back to England by Governor Phillip.
It would be interesting to know what
Mrs. Lees thought of the Rum Regime,
but that chapter has not been written.
What we do know is that John Lees
nearly lost himself body and soul, as well
as all his worldly possessions, family in-
cluded, by his submission to Rum
Rule.
CHAPTER 111.
THE LAST PIG. —THE CHANGED
FARM, AND THE STRANGE
ANSWER TO PRAYER.
The district meeting, held at Windsor-
on Tuesday, November 6, 1821, in its
report to England, published in “The
4


lies. Leigh,” p. 326, refers to tlie striking its fangs in all directions, and
Demorable Darkness nml rlv*ha«emcmf Jri • i- i ° i ,
“Deplorable Darkness and debasement
which characterise the moral concli-
tions of these colonies. They have
been peopled chiefly by the very out-
casts of society, B[ere the Mother
Country nas disgorged her most worth-
less and vitiated sons. .. The rest
of the report is gruesome reading; but
while it recognises “the vigilance and
coercion of civil authority,” and ad-
mits ‘ ‘ the presence of some virtuous
characters scattered here and there
throughout the land,” it pleaded for
more missionaries ‘ ‘ urgently needed to
saturate the whole land with the know 7
ledge and love of God. ’ ’
It is quite certain the soldiers were
not far behind any one else in the
matter of the disposal of rum, and
John Lees was not much better than
the rest of them.
Rev. Samuel Leigh says: 4 4 John Lees ’
former propensity for strong drink,
checked for a while by industry, again
developed itself and grew on him, till
he bore all the marks of a reckless,
confirmed drunkard.
“It happened in his case, as in a
thousand others, that one useful article
after another went, till part of his
land and all his live stock were gone,
except one pig, now fat and ready for
the knife. The unhappy man was con-
templating the sale of this last pig
(These words the Missioner has in
italics) to pay off a debt which he had
contracted for spirituous liquors, when
a circumstance occurred which
changed the whole coui’se of his future
life, and, we believe, his final des-
tiny. * *
Then the missionary tells the story
way. Rev. Benjamin Carvosso,
who knew Lees well, and probably
heard him tell the story over and over,
gives it with a slight variation. Rev.
James Colwell choses Carvosso’s ren-
dering, which is: “Stepping out one
night for a log of wood, he accidentally
grasped a snake, which instantly bit
him on the wrist. Seized with violent
alarm, he hastened to Windsor (about
14 miies) tc seek relief. On entering
the home of the Rev. R. Cartwright,
the Anglican clergyman, he fell faint-
ing to the ground. Medical aid and
a Gracious Providence saved him from
death. This event led to his conver-
sion. All things became new.”
Samuel Leigh’s account of if is that
the snake was a nightmare, out of a
fearful dipsomania which rose out of
his spirit-bottle “with expanded jaw 7 s
from which he woke and thanked God
it was but a dream.”
And his ride to Windsor was for
spiritual guidance.
Three years after this, in the year
that Waterloo was being fought, the
British Wesleyan Conference, from re-
presentations made by Messrs. Eaggar,
Bowden, Scott, and Hosking, who
signed the petition, sent out a mission-
ary to Australia —the Rev. Samuel
Leigh —who had been ordained by Doc-
tor Adam Clarke.
There were, of course, “People
called Methodists” in the “the settle-
ment” before this time, as the names
on the application for a missionary
indicate, ami, indeed, both" the first
chaplain and his assistant and succes-
sor, were as much Methodists as John
Wesley himself was at that time. It
is also natural to conclude that there
was some fruit among those who had
served their sentences from the many
conversions that Methodism claimed
Through their prison work and gaol
visitations, as well as their work among
soldiers.
However, John Lees prayed for three
years for the coming of a Methodist
minister.
The prayer was being answered in
a strange w'ay.
Samuel Leigh found only fourteen
people he could claim as belonging to
his society in Sydney, and having fixed
up matters in regard to their preach-
ing-place on “The Rocks” there, he
set out for the .country on his newly-
acquired horse, “Old Traveller.”
Tired and worn out, and “late in
the evening,” after his 35 miles of
a mode of travel he was not used to,
he found the house on the Nepean to
which he had been recommended with
a letter.
“He will be glad to see you; for,
like yourself, he is a Staffordshire
man. ’ *
‘ Sir, ; ’ said Mr. Leigh (Leigh’s
Life, p. 48), “I have a letter from yoir
friend, Mr. ,in Sydney. He
wishes you to allow me, as a Wesleyan
missionary, to preach to your people. ’ ’
The haughty settler replied peremp-
torily, “I shall do nothing of the
kind.” “Perhaps,” said Mr. Leigh,
4 4 you will be so kind as to allow my
horse to remain in your yard all
night, and permit me to steep in your
barn? I shall pay you whatever you
demand for our accommodation.”
“I will do nothing of the kind,”
5


was all he got for reply.
“Do you think that anyone in the
settlement will take me in for the
night ? ’ ’
“I think John Lees will,” said the
farmer. “He lives two miles off in
that direction ’’— -pointing with hia
finger.
Now we ponder as to why that
gr, umpy friend of Mr. thought
John Lees would give the hospitality
he himself denied to a Wesleyan mis-
sionary.
John Lees must have changed very
much during that three years, and he
must have known something about
“The People called Methodists” be-
fore the coming of their first mis-
sionary.
The missionary rode “as fast as the
entangling nature of the underwood
would admit” in search of the house
of John Lees. No one would think of
entangling woods over “two miles” in
any direction from that spot to-day.
It requires a sentence like that to
make us see by how much labour the
pastures of the Castlereagh have been
won from virgin scrub.
It was dark when the missionary ar-
rived at the very humble home of the
pioneer settler.
When his regiment was disbanded
the soldiers had the option of a free
passage “Home,” as England was
then called, or a piece of land. John
Lees chose the land, and his “grant”
issued by Governor King was one of
the second allotments from the River
Nepean, and on the most choice of the
Castlereagh flats. Part of an adjoin-
ing farm was sold this year for near
on to forty pounds an acre. Then
there was a wild bush out of which,
to carve every yard of cultivation;
the slab bush hut by the side of the
lagoon, a back-wnsh of the river, was
cut. This was the centre of his gradu-
ally-clearing farm. Several acres of
tall trees were felled by his own axe,
and the timber burnt off.” On ar-
riving at the wood hut he knocked with
the end of his whip at the door, and
called out, “Will you receive a Wes'
leyan Missionary ?’ ’
It must have been fairly dark by
this time to allow the missionary to
get up to the house without being
noticed, and a reception like his last
was to be expected from the quiet
that prevailed, and there seemed
nothing else before him but a most
undesirable night in the bush. Then
“The door opened, and out came a
little stiff, ruddy lad, who laid hold
yf the bridle with one hand and the
stirrup with the other, and said, ‘Get
off, sir! My father will be glad to
see you’ ” (p. 48 Leigh’s Life).
This lad was none other than John
Lees, junior, the father of the aged
Mrs. Ann Wright, of Castlereagh, who
lives on part of the original grant.
The place where the house stood is
behind the present church, across the
lagoon, and is now the market-garden
attached to the home of Alderman
Chas. Carter. ‘ ‘ The little, stiff, ruddy
lad” must have been old enough to
know' why his father would be “glad”
of a Wesleyan missionary’s unan-
nounced visit; old enough to know the
difference between being reduced to
the “last pig” three years before and
the spread table from which he had
just come. He knew, indeed, the dif-
ference between the wild nightmare
of delirium-tremens and the cry of
a soul in prayer of thankfulness for
the pardon and peace which comes of
belief in Christ.
It was not only his father who would
“be glad” at the coming of the mis-
sionary.
The whole farm had certainly shown
a gladness during those three years,
and the boy spoke for the whole farm
as well as his father.
‘ ‘ Mr. Leigh dismounted and entered
the hut,” the narrative continues.
“'His astonishment may well be con-
ceived when he observed a number of
persons sitting round a three-legged
table in the most orderly manner.
John Lees rose, and pointing to some
books which were on the table, said;
“We were just going to have family
worship. Perhaps you will have no ob-
jection to take that duty off my
hands?” “Not at all,” said the mis-
sionary, and taking the Bible, it opened
at Isaiah 35: “The wilderness and the
solitary place shall be glad for them;
and the desert shall rejoice and blos-
som as the rose.” Here he was ob-
liged to pause, the narrator (p. 49)
continues, and allows the tears to flow
until he could command the power of
utterance. He then proceeded with the
second verse: “It shall blossom abun-
dantly, and rejoice even with joy and
singing; the glory of Lebanon shall
be given unto it, the excellency of
Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the
glory of the Lord and the excellency
of our God, ’ ’ but he could proceed no
further. Five minutes before he ha I
felt himself to be a stranger in a
6


strange land, enclosed in the woods of
Australia, a late hour, and without a
home; now he was in Bethel; while
the verses which he had read opened
to his views the moral renovation of
the world. He was quite overcome:
and his manly spirit, that could un-
button his waistcoat to receive the
spear of the cannibal, was unable to
breast the tide of its own feelings.
The gurgling of restrained emotion in-
terrupted the harmonious flow of their
evening song, while their prayers,
offered in broken sentences, were the
simple expression of humble and ador-
ing gratitude. When they rose from
their knees the farmer crossed the
floor and, seizing Mr. Leigh’s hand,
sqeezed it until he felt as if the blood
Were dropping from the points of his
fingers. ‘' vVe have been praying for
three years,” said Lees, “that" God
would send us a missionary; now that
you are come we are right glad to see
you. We had not heard of your ar-
rival in the colony.” After supper
they ,retired to rest, exclaiming, “We
have seen strange things to-day.”
CHAPTER IV.—THE CONSECRATED
ACRE.—GRACIOUS LIBER-
ALITY.
EARLY LIFE ON THE NEPEAN
It does seem a little thing for a
minister to complain of “his living”
and the choice of “blue ribbon cir-
cuits” in our days, when their labours
are compared with those of such
pioneers as the Rev. Samuel Leigh—the
first missionary to Australia.
The missionary’s circuit extended
from Western Australia to New Zea-
land. including the islands of the
Pacific, and his munificent ‘' allow-
ances” were “£lO as quarterage, with
boat'd, washing, fuel, postage, station-
ery, travelling expenses, and furniture
provided.” With regard to his furni-
ture, the good people who petitioned
the Wesleyan Mission Society in Lon-
don to send him had requested that ha
brdng ‘ 1 furniture for a house, ’ ’ but
the committee ‘ ‘ understood you to ap-
ply for furniture for a hoisc.” So
“Old Traveller” was equipped with
“an excellent secondhand military
saddle and bridle and other requi-
sites.”
‘ ‘ When I commenced my mission in
Australia” (“Leigh’s Life,” p. 45)
“there w r ere only four clergymen of
the Church of England, and but few
communicants. There was no Presby-
terian. minister in the colony, and there
were only fourteen accredited Wesley-
ans. What hath God wrought?”
The “first balance-sheet” of the
Methodist Church in Australia shows
that ‘ ‘ Old Traveller ’ ’ cost £25, and
tnat the missionary received the tre-
mendous sum of £l5 for six months’
‘ ‘ allowance. ’ ’
This was the missioner who came to
the humble home of John Lees on that
memorable night. He found it neces-
sary then to have in his saddle-bag
“a good axe, and was frequently ob-
liged to alight, and cut a passage for
himself and horse through the closely-
compacted underwood,”
Mr. CHAS. HOLSWICH,
3 Organiser of the Castlereagh 11 Pil-
grimage, ” who bore, during the
war, the unique position of being
the first to be enrolled for service
in N.S.W., his regimental number
being 1, Ist Battalion. He is a
Trustee, Bible Class leader, and Sun-
day School sec, of Castlereagh
Church,
We can hardly imagine such a forest
here now' that even the firewood has
been cut out. There were other
homes besides John Lees’in this dis
irict to which the missionary found
entrance afterwards. “While travel-
ling one day in the harvest on the side


of the Nepean River the rain fell in
torrents. Himself and horse seemed to
be wrapped in sheets of lightening,
and the wind blew a hurricane. He
at last came Within sight of a hut, and
diverged from his path to seek shelter.
As he approached it he saw a tall ruf-
fianly-looking man and a female emerg-
ing from the bush. The man called
out to him, with strong Irish accent,
‘ ‘ Get into the cabin, sir-, and take
your horse with you.’ ”
These persons were the settler and
his wife. The storm had driven them
from the harvest field; and in return-
ing home the female had brought with
her a sheaf of barley, which she car-
ried on her head. On coming up to
Mr. Leigh, the man took hold of the
bridle, and pulled the horse into the
hut. When they all got in the cabin
was full. While th.- man was getting
up the fire, his wife was rubbing the
barley out of the straw in her apron
She then sifted it on the table, put
'’t in a frying-pan, and dried it well
oyei the fire. Taking a little hand-
mill, she ground it, made it into dough,
apd cooked it in the frying-pan. The
fire being now at liberty, she put on an
cld saucepan with some water, put
some tea into the water, with three
eggs, and boiled them all together.
(Please don’t laugh, you good "ladies
who have your modern culinary con-
veniences.) Taking the eggs out, and
pouring the water from the tea-leaves,
she placed the Avhole upon the table,
■observing, ‘ ‘ You see, sir, we live in a
very homely way here, but you are
welcome.” (Thank God for the brave
women in those pioneer days). In the
meantime the horse was served with a
small portion of the barley. Mr.
Leigh took one egg without hesitation,
the second Avith a degree of reluctance,
and nothing but the importunity of his
hostess could haAm induced him to take
the third. The man went out, and
gathered a bundle of grass for the
horse, and while it was eating, the
missionary spoke kindly and earnestly
about the necessity of preparing to
meet God.”
Now, that’s a better story than his
having to pick up the Indian corn
Thrown to the fowls by the comict,
who dared not give him any, and
which made him sick for a fortnight.
It has this merit, too, that it must
have been a more neighbourly neigh-
bour of John Lees’ than the other
nameless one who pointed out his house
when he first came.
It tv as for the upkeep of this good
man’s work that John Lees threw his
home open, and gave of his poverty
more liberally than anyone else in
these days for the spread of God’s
work.
The service was held every time the
missionery; came for the first few
months, in the barn attached to his
homestead. There John Lees set about
building a church on the boundary of
his farm near the road. ’ ‘Leigh’s
Life” (p. 8) says:
‘ * From his first connection with the
missionary he had exerted himself to
the utmost to promote the general in-
terests of the mission, and especially
to bring his own neighbours into fel-
lowship with the church of Jesus
Christ. The blessing of the Lord was
upon him, and he determined to ren-
der his prosperity subservient to the
glory of God and the benefit of man.
With these objects in view, he resolved
to build a place of worship at his own
expense, and give the exclusive right
of occupation to the missionary. Lev.
James Colwell says; “There is reason
to think that he built it with his own
Bands. ’ ’
“When finished the appropriation
of this little building to the purposes
of religious worship Avas signalised by
much of the Divine Presence. It aauis
noticed by Mr. Leigh in the follow-
ing terms: ‘On the 7th October, 1817,
T opened a chapel at Casth-reagh, built
and given to the mission by Mr. John
Lees. While I stood and looked at
the people coming in carts from vari-
ous quarters and remote districts, I
was reminded of the scriptural figure
cf ‘doves flying to their windows,’
and of the Amerean camp meetings.
The place was soon filled with atten-
tive hearers. I addressed them from
‘The Lord hath done great things* for
ns where we are glad.’ ”
Te spot where the building stood is
marked by a plough furrow quite close
to the present church on the left side,
toAAards the south, and between the
new church and the Sunday School,
which was built with such of the ma-
terial from the first church as was
useable.
“The chapel was a substantial build-
ing of weatherboards. It stood sur-
rounded by Methodist homes many
years, until it gave place to a larger
building.
“On the door of this primitive
building were painted the words:
‘Methodist Chapel,’ and 1 wloav them.

‘Prepare to meet thy God.’ ”
Country louts and village wags are
said to have played their practical
jokes upon the place, to the annoy-
ance of the'worshippers at times. But
Mr. Colwell says: .‘Mr. James Burns,
for many years a successful class
leader, was convinced of sin' by read-
ing that text.” Many a soul was
“born for glory” within its old walls,
as their present relatives can testify,
though few of them are left.
The conveyance of the property to
just one century' ago—and is from John
Just one century ago; and is from John
Lees (to whom the land was granted
by Governor King) to Samuel Leigh.
“The land contains one v acre, situ-
ated on the middle of the western
loundary of his farm, commencing 16
perches from the south corner line of
the tenure of Lees and Pieldhouse,
running 16 perches in front along the
said western boundary, or road, be-
tween Lees’ and Pieldhouse,. and
10 porches in width or depth, bounded
on the north, east, and south sides
by Lee’s farm, and the conveyance is
to Sampel Leigh, Benjamin Carvosso,
Walter Lawry, Ralph Mansfield, and
George Ersk’ine, preachers of the said
‘people callo i Methodists,’ and ap-
pointed by the said Conference, their
hdlrs, successors, and assigns. ’ ’
The trust was reformed by a con-
veyance from Ralph Mansfield to
Joseph Stanton and others, dated 10th
November, 1864. This year the places
of several of the trustees who have
been called to their ‘ ‘ long home ’ ’ have
been filled, as far as possible, with
sons of the former trustees. Two of
the present trust are relatives of
John Lees.
Mr. James Rutledge continues: “He
first erected a chapel to his dwelling,
in which in after years he conducted
a Sunday School even when confined
to the bed on which he lay. He also
had a nice weatherboard chapel erected
on the opposite end of his farm, on a
pio’e of land he had previously de-
voted to the missionary society, the
site on which the present church
stands, and a portion is now used as a
cemeterv.
‘ ; Mr. Lees, however, a few years
later removed from Castlereagh to Svd-
ney, and subsequently returned to his
farm at Castlereagh. where he was
confined to his bed for seven years
before he was released by death from
his sufferings in 1836.”
The trustees are;—Joshua Field, sec-
retary; Amos Parker, William Stan-
ton, Ernest P. Mason, Richard Reece,
John N. Parker, Hezikiah Parker,
David H. Parker, Charles Wright,
Ernest L. R. Keeeh, Walter E. Lance,
James Sheens, Chas. A. Holswfieh, A.
Marshall, and Charles Carter. The
other early trustees who have died are:
William Wright, Samuel Burns, Charles
Gorman, Henry Sheens, Henry Reid,
Robert Stewart, and John Jackson,
and we enter into their labours.
Mr. Wright retains an interest in
the old farm. His mother is still liv-
ing in the house adjoining the church.
Alderman C. Carter it is whose house
is adjoining the old homestead where
the first services were held.
‘•'After the public service in the
evening the people were unwilling to
leave the place, so we held a prayer
meeting, and truly Jacob’s God was
with us. At the close of these ser-
vices Mr. Lees said, “I have not yet
done my duty; having made some pro-
vision for the worship of God, I must
now contribute something towards sup-
plying the building with the ministry
of God’s word. I cannot at present
give money; but I will give one acre
of my best land. I will plough it,
sow it, reap it, thresh and sell the
produce, and you shall have ■whatever
it brings without any deduction.”
(“Lellgh’s Life”).
‘‘The missionary took one end of
Gunter’s chain and the farmer the
other, and they measured off the de-
voted acre.”
That acre looks to-day as if they
were not averse to stretching “Gun-
ter’s Chain,” and the grave-diggers
who have gone down in the soil seve-
ral times say there is not a better piece
of land man that corner on the whole
district.
“After applying the produce of this
acre for several years to the mission, ”
the narrative continues, Lee observed,
“It was a fortunate thing for me that
I gave that acre of land; for, since
that time, my neighbours have all ob-
served that my wheat has grown
thicker and stronger than theirs.”
Mr. James Rutledge, in a special cen-
tenary commemoration number of “The
Methodist,” published May 20, 1899,
which Joshua Field has preserved, savs-
“ln the history of Methodism it is dif-
ficult to find a place where the grace
of God has been more stribinglv exem-
plified than at Castlereagh and Penrith,
in the Windsor Circuit This locality
was one of the first places selected for


an agricultural settlement in the colony.
The people who made their homes
there were soldiers who had retired
from the army, liberated convicts, and
a few immigrants, of whom a few were
Germans. The Government, in order
to encourage them to cultivate the soil,
gave them grants of land,'with other
indulgences, to assist them in their en
ter prises. After the arrival of the
Rev. Samuel Leigh, his attention was
drawn to the religions wants of these
people. He soon found his way to
them. ’
The account goes on much the same
as told in ‘ ‘ Leigh’s Life, ’ ’ with this dif-
ference, that he gave the age of the boy
as six, and says he saw the missionary
coming and. ‘ ran in' and told his
father.” Perhaps both are right. Rut-
ledge goes on to say, “Mr. Lees not
only entertained the minister, but be-
came pre-eminent in his zeal in the
cause of God.”
“It has been questioned,” says Rev.
James Colwell, in Ms ‘' H’story o*
Methodism in Australia,” “if it was
the first chapel in Australia. Having
gone thoroughly into-the matter, I have
no hesitation in saving that John L eP g>
chapel was the first Weslevan Chapel
m the southern world. The difference
of opinion arises thus: The old chapel
»iow (1904) standing at Castlereagh was
the first chapel built on the acre of
mnd given to the mission by John
Lees, and cultivated for the benefit of
the mission. But this was erected
when John Lees’ chapel across the la-
goon was demolished. The Rev. John.
Pemell writes; ‘1 was the last to preach
m ihat little old place in the bush.
The floor of the_ pulpit had rotted away,
and I stood with my feet resting on
the two flooring joists. ’ ”
“There is something romantic in the
approach to the little chapel, ” Mr.
Colwell quotes from Rev. R. Mansfield!
“We have first to sail over a little
stream, then to walk through the corn-
fields, which are covered with nlent"'
Before you the fruitful fields art!
bounded by deep, umbrageous forests,
and those again by the Bine Mountains,
whose fugged and solemn brows stretch
"ay on either hard Imvo-M the trace
of the eye. In the midst of this in-
teresting scene stands the humble
1 emule of our God, inviting our steps
to its peaceful seclusion, and our harts
to adorn the Maker of all.”
There is no forest there now, and it
is not necessary to use a boat to cross
from Die old homestead to the church,
it being but a short distance to go
around, but the place has still its rest-
ful appearance, and its spiritual up-
lift.
‘ ‘ Our chapel at Castlereagh, fifty
miles from Sydney (he must have come
via Richmond) is 28ft, x 14ft. Built
by John Lees; given to the mission
free of expense. This John Lees has
been blessed in his deeds. When I
first knew him he was very poor, and
much a'flu,led, bit of late God has
blessed him with health, religion has
made him happy, and heaven has
crowned Ids labours a hundred-fold. He
is determined to render to God th •
things that be God’s. He is very useful
as a class leader, and is never weary of
warning sinners to flee from the wrath
to come, of comforring the mourner,
and of building up believers in their
most holy faith. May God spare his
life for the sake of His Church and
people in New South Wales.” (Col-
well’s History, p. 102).
CHAPTER V.—FIRST MISSIONARY
ADDRESS.—STORM OF BENEVO-
LENCE FROM THE BLUE MOUN-
TAINS.
In the next year after the building
and opening of this little church the
Wesleyan Missionary Society held its
first meetings.
In Macquarie Street Chapel, on the
Ist October, 1821, just a century ago,
the first anniversary of this Missionary
Society was held. The Rev. B. Car-
vosso, quoted in Rev. James Colwell’s
History, p. 315, says: “John Lees, of
Castlereagh, had come down in his jolt-
ing cart thirty-five miles to attend the
meeting. He had heard much of the
missionary meetings in England. They
suited his taste, and he came on tip-
toe of expectation. Various persons
had addressed the meeting. It was
drawing to a conclusion. The secretary
had taken down a pretty long list of
subscriptions, with names of the con-
tributors annexed. John, who was sit-
ting on my right hand, now stood up,
his tall, lean figure making him very
conspicuous, and said with great seri-
ousness, ‘ ‘ Mr. Secretary, put me down
for six guineas.” As those were not
the days of great givings, the meeting
was astonished. The secretary, kuow-
ing his narrow circumstances and large
family, could not bring his mind to
place so large a sum in connection with
John’s name. This storm of benevo-
11


Icnco from the Blue Mountains ar-
rested the proceedings, till John, guess-
ing the cause of the embarrassment,
got up and relieved his friends. His
heart was full of the thought of God’s
love to himself and family. Amidst
flowing tears and broken accents he
assured the meeting of his deep sense
of obligation to God and his Saviour.
He must be permitted, he said, to
present the sum he named, to promote
the cause to which he was a great deb-
tor. He concluded with a touching
reference to two of his children, whom
God had recently taken to glory. One
of these, who had married a lay mis-
sionary of the Church in New Zealand,
returned to the colony and died in the
Lord. Every individual was much af-
fected; his name was entered on the
subscription list, and his speech pro-
nounced the best of the meeting. As
he literally sought first the kingdom
of God and its righteousness, he found
means in due time to pay his noble
contribution. ’ ’
In February, 1822, Mr. Carvosso says,
"The brethren all being present, we
held a missionary meeting at Castle-
reagh. The assemlfly was not numer-
ous, nor wealthy, but our Divine Mas-
ter was with us, and the subscriptions
were very liberal. Not forty persons
were present, including several child-
ren, yet they subscribed £20.”
At Parramatta, in 1825 —Castle-
reagh in some resnects surpassed all
other places—Mr. John Lees gave 80
bushels of wheat, worth about £5O;
Mr. Lees’ children, ten pounds of to-
bacco; Mr. and Mrs. Stockfish, six
pounds and Mr. and Mrs. Field, eight
pounds of tobacco. Mr. Field also
presented to the society a new steel
mill of the value of £B.”
At that missionary meeting one of
the contributors added, "I will give
another dollar a year because I am not
a black man.”
At another meeting John Lees said,
‘‘ T will give twenty bushels of wheat
("Leigh’s Life,” p. 312) as my contri-
bution. I wish to encourage my friends
at Windsor to give liberally.” "After
the meeting he added a cow and a calf
to those noble contributions. He sold
the whole for £45, which he paid to the
auxiliary treasurer as his subscription
for the year. Though a severe drought
had occurred during the *arly months
of the year, and affected vegitation in
several districts of the country, yet,
to John, it had been a prosperous year,
both as it regarded his cattle an£ hi?
crops. The love of man originating
in supreme love to God is like a moun-
tain stream. You may obstruct its
progress by tilling up its channel, but
its accumulating waters will find a new
vent, and pour themselves upon the
valley below, spreading beauty and
fertility over the whole landscape.”
Mr. Carvosso (continuing) says:
“One of those distressing droughts with
which New South Wales is not unfre-
quently visited, having occurred,
John’s crops, in common with others,
entirely failed. After many painful
exercises as to how his subscription of
nine guineas should be paid, he resolved
to sell one of his horses. For some
months great pains were taken by him-
self, his wife, and children, to make
it as marketable as possible. It
often seen tied under a shady tree*
while the children were employed in
the woods cutting grass for it. On
the week immediately preceding our
missionary meeting at Sydney, I hap-
pened, on the day of the fair, to cross
the market place, and saw John in
the act of mounting his horse to return
home. Not knowing his errand there,
nor the state of his mind, I spoke
cheerfully to- him about attending the
meeting; for we could not well afford
his absence, having no man like-
minded. He returned no answer. On
lifting my eyes to his countenance as
he sat on the horse I saw he was over-
whelmed with grief. As well as tears
and perturbed feeling would permit,
he said, ‘No, sir; I shall now be
ashamed to be seen there! I can’t
pay my subscription; for I can’t sell
my horse.’ More astonished at this
speech of tried and disinterested bene-
violence than anything about ‘giving’
that had before dropped from his lips,
or from any other, I attempted to ren-
der him a word of consolation, such
as. indeed, the occasion seemed to re-
quire, but his distress was too deep
to be mitigated by anything that I
could say. He broke from me while
J was in the act of speaking, and bore
the burden of his painful disappoint-
ment back to his distant abode in the
bush. Apologising * absence
at the meeting, and non-payment of
his subscription, the incident did not
fail to draw tears from the audience.
Put improved cultivation. fruitful
showers, and the blessing of God on
grounds so peculiarly connected with
the skies, gave him a very plentiful
crop the following year. On leaving
his lowly roof to go with him to the
12


missionary meeting at his own chapel
in the wood, his wife, in very homely
attire, sitting on a stool with an infant
on her lap, called loudly after us;
‘John, mind, you did not pay your sub-
scription last year. , You must pay
two years now! ’
‘ ‘ Considering that Mary did not tin
everything see eye to eye with her
zealous husband, and that the rate of
subscription stood at a point so ele-
vated, this word of exhortation I could
not but regard as being above the com-
monplace. John did his duty that
evening. He put down various sub-
scriptions in kind, the whole of which,
when disposed of, amounted to, I
think, £l4. ‘ There is that seattereth
and yet increaseth. ’ ”
That same missionary society, now
called “The Methodist Missionary So-
ciety of Australasia,” has had many
princely contributions, and the annual
subscriptions have crept up year by
year, until last year (1920) they
reached £81,196 19s. 4d, A more
generous giver or a more noble-hearted
supporter than John Lees, the Mission-
ary Society has never had.
CHAPTER VI. SERMONS IN
STONES, CRUMBLING EPI-
TAPHS, AND LASTING ME-
MORIALS.
The report of the society to its par-
ent body in Englgand recorded the
“amazing change our preaching has
wrought” throughout N.S.W., in islands
of the sea, and New Zealand.
It is quite apparent that there was
in John Lees a change that was amaz-
ing, thorough, and apparent, even
though it was caused by the same
means that he and the missionaries
credited and praised so.
The man was so altered from a was-
trel to a wonder; from a dipsomaniac
to a citizen beloved and honored; from
one who was a useless burden to him-
self to one who was the helper and
counsellor of numbers who sought his
advice and sympathetic help, that Rev.
James Colwell rightly said his was “a
life of more than ordinary interest.”
Such a change is not only quite
scriptural, but it is open to all who will
only allow that Power, not ourselves,
that worked for righteousness, to have
its way in their lives.
There is so marked a difference be-
tween John Lees with his last pig and
deadly snakes to John Lees, philan-
thropist, church-builder, and endower,
class leader and benefactor, that, in
more senses than one could Samuel
Leigh add heads to his text, “The
Lord hath done great things for us,
whereof we are glad.” The miracle
of a changed life is grander than any
material wonder.
John Lees now became “distin-
guished for his. piety and power in
prayer. ’ ’
Mr. Eutledge (before quoted) said:
“He became pre-eminent in his zeal in
the cause of God (in his) liberality,
and (in his) scrupulous conduct in the
government of his family. He not
only scorned the contempt of the proud
and disregarded the scoff of the low
and the vulgar and wicked, but he
proceeded to acts that excited the ad-
miration of all others that knew him.”
“A poor woman, living in the dis-
trict, found delight in persecuting her
husband for righteousness sake. One
day, while reading his Bible, she threw
it on the floor. Retiring to the garden
to meditate on the strange act, he was
recalled by one of the children ‘Mo-
ther’s crying so,’ said the child.
•Come, Father, and see her.’ Find-
ing his wife weeping because of a
sentence which had caught her eye, he
said, ‘Come away to John Lees,’ and
taking a child under each arm, he led
his wife, without shawl or bonnet, cry-
ing as she went, to John Lees, and
there, very soon, while prayer was be-
ing offered, the peace and blessing of
God came into her soul.”
Of the simplicity and fervent piety
of this man Mr. Carvosso gives seve-
ral instances. “I had left the
chapel,” he says, “in company with
my good friend, and we walked home-
ward in silence. Our souls had been
greatly refreshed. We were happy.
John, mostly talkative on ordinary oc-
casions, had scarcely uttered a word
since we left the house of prayer.
There was no sound floating on the
soft breeze that gently wafted over the
lofty evergreens, embosoming the cul-
tivated patches. It was a beautiful,
serene Australian evening. At last
the solemn silence was broken. In a
firm and devout tone of voice John
said: “I have been praying, air, for
grace to bear the trial of this bless-
ing.”
‘‘ On another occasion, ’ ’ proceeds
Mr. Carvosso, “returning from the
same house of prayer in the wood, and
passing together in the same direction,
and over the same spot of ground, one


other striking sentence was uttered by
my devout fihend. It was the season
of harvest. John had reaped his wheat.
It stood in shocks around us. The
weather was very unfavourable. Rain
had been almost incessantly descending
for several days preceding. The corn
was at the point of sprouting at the
sheaf, being greatly damaged, and
the heavens were hung with the black
and threatening clouds. I used a
common sort of phraseology, indicating
that it was now bad weather for' the
harvest. At the sound of bad weather
from my lips he appeared moved in
an extraordinary manner. Instantly
standing in the midst of his dripping,
discoloured sheaves, he looked at me
with mingled seriousness and astonish-
ment, and, with a kind of frown on
nis countenance, said in an air of auth-
ority, ‘I think, sir, the weather will
always be right.’ The next day, by
a sudden change, the weather proving
very tine, the heat o£ the sun from the
bright heavens quickly dried the wheat,
and John, carrying it into his barn com-
paratively uninjured, I was left to
meditate on the lesson of ‘instruction
in righteousness’ which I had re-
ceived” —Rev. J. Colwell’s History.
He lived some 23 years after his con-
version, enjoying not only increasing
prosperity, but als6 the love and ad-
miration of his neighbours, and their
trust in him as a spiritual guide, both
for themselves in the class and their
children in the Sunday School.
His health was remarkably good for
the best part of that time, and then it
began to fail, and for seven years he
was obliged to endure much suffering,
the latter part of which three he was
confined to his room. Having suffered
a shock of paralisis while living
in Sydney. He continued to con-
duct the Sunday School even from
nis sick bed. Then came the end,
and the “people called Methodists,”
not having at that time provided for
a separate resting-place for the remains
of their members and adherents who
had passed away, nor as yet having
legal right to marry or bury, John Lees
was laid in a grave at a different angle
from others, in the cemetery, now de-
serted and almost in ruins, which was
then attached to the Lower Castlereagh
Church of England. A grass-covered
mound of brick dust now marks the
place where this church once stood, it,
having been pulled down to build the
one that is nearer to where settlement
shifted, and the cemetery is fast be-
coming a forgotten relic of the past.
Mary Lees followed her husband a
few years after, but there being noth-
ing engraved on the stone to her mem-
ory is an indication that she was re-
sponsible for the headstone (so much
better than others) to her husband.
Mr. Lees also ‘ ‘ materially assisted
Mr. Stockfish in the erection of a nice
chapel on that gentleman’s farm three
miles distant. This farm, with the
chapel on it, was some time afterwards
sold on the deatli of Mrs. Stockfish,
who only survived her husband three
months, but the mission suffered no
loss, for the proceeds, which amounted
1o over £1,300, went towards the build-
ing of the Mission Houses, as the par-
sonages were then called, at Parra-
matta and Windsor.”
This same Mr. and Mrs.
are interred near to John Lees’ grave
in the old Lower Castlereagh Ceme-
tery, the headstone broken and dis
figured.
There are very few interred here
before Lees’ time that have head-
stones.
‘ ‘ The oldest grave,” the historian,
Freame, wrote in a paper to the His-
toric Society, ‘ ‘ was 1811.” But there
is none now left further back than
1816, the year after the coming of
Rev. Samuel Leigh to Sydney.
John Lees’ headstone reads:—
Sacred to the Memory of
JOHN LEES,
Who departed this life after seven
years’ severe affliction,
August 28th, 1836,
Aged 65 years.
Jesus my all in all Thou art
My rest _in toil, my ease in pain
The medicine of my broken heart
In war my peace, in loss my gain
My smile beneath the tyrant’s frown
In shame my glory and my crown.
There is no punctuation except the
last stop, and the sculptor had tried to
improve on Wesley’s spelling of medi-
cine.
On the small footstone is simply the
date—lB36.
* It may be noted here, for compari-
son with the records Mr. Fraeme left
in the Historical Society, that he read
one of the inscriptions wrongly, calli-
ng “Tindale” ‘‘Tinda Le,” evi-
dently escaping the fact of defective
sculpture.
A contrast in the epitaphs of other
stones near-by is remarkable.

There is not one inscription of those
years that comes any way near the
sublimity of thought and the grandeur
of poetic expression as the verse on
John Lee-p’ headstone, which is taken
from the third stanza of John Wesley’s
beautiful hymn:
‘‘Thou hidden source of calm repose.”
—No. 107, present Hymn-Book.
‘‘They shall obtain joy and glad-
ness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away. ’ ’
The Scripture quotation is from the
first chapter (Isa. 35) read by Eev. S.
Leigh in John Lees’ home.
After all, the lasting memorial to
John and Mary Lees is the large and
ever-growing posterity, so many of
whom have kept the faith of their
Patriarch, and are earnest and zealous
workers in the Church that brought
the light and liberty which made their
family what it is. A little lad, a great-
great-grandson of John and Mary
Lees, is to be christened —John Lees
Parker —on the day the memorial is un-
veiled.
There 5 s & little sermon in stones
here, for, no doubt about it, Grace re-
fines the soul and elevates the mind,
and it is very patent even in these re-
cords on crumbling gravestones.
It were a pity for these sermons to
be so silent in the bush, where few can
read them; for so remarkable a char-
acter to have no memorial by which
the children’s children of years to
come can note the doings of the heroic
pioneer; as it would be a wonder to
them if they should turn up these old
records, quoted in this booklet, why
no notice was taken by writing in stone
an appreciation of the work done.
It shall be no longer laid to our
charge that we have entered into the
reward of their labours and not shown
our gratitude.
While ever there are worshippers in
the Castlereagh Church, or travellers
who look over the fence into the God’s
Acre, that is so sacred by the roadside,
the name of John Lee v s will never be
forgotten in Australia.
AN APPRECIATION.

The memorial is to be placed on the

of Australia, Memorials to that great
navigator, Captain James Cook, are
found the world over. Cook was the
first Englishman to see and to explore
the east coast of New Holland. Captain
Arthur Phillip is honored, and his
deeds are recorded. He was the foun-
der and the first Governor of New South
Wa'As. “The Life of Richard John-
son” has been written. Johnson was
chaplain to the first fleet, conducting
the first religious service in Australia,
and building the first church. The
Bible that he used at that first service
is reverently treasured in St. Phillip’s
Church to-day, while the service
is commemorated by a yearly pilgrim-
age to the spot whereon Johnson stood
when he preached. Samuel Leigh has
his deeds worthily recorded in a bulky
volume by Straehan. He was the first
Methodist misionary to the souther))
world, Jaying the foundations of the
Methodist Church in New South Wales
and New Zealand. John Watsford has
written his own autobiography. He
was the first native-born Australian to
enter the ranks of the Christian mini-
stry. Now the Methodists of Austra-
lasia are reminded of another pioneer.
On this historic day they have the op-
uertunity to honor the memory of John
Lees, a man in whose heart there
burned the unquenchable fire of Divine
love, which found expression in deeds
whose after-glow warms the heart, not-
withstanding the passing of one hun-
dred years.
Why honor this man, and why recall
his deeds? For this, if for no other
reason: He built the first of the 4,000
Methodist Churches now scattered over
this island continent and the islands
of the South Seas. Happily, the date
of the opening of this first chapel is
known. But the day when John Lees
made his home at Castlereagh is not
so clear. This much, however, we
know. John Lees came to this coun-
try as a soldier in the notorious New
South Wales Corps. At the expiration
of hfs term of service in that body he
could return to England or claim a
grant of land in New South Wales. He
chose the latter, and in the year 1810,
probably earlier, he was on his farm
at Castlereagh, fcr in December of
that year, when Governor Macquarie
visited Windsor, the settlers presented
him with an address. The name of
John Lees appears side-by-side- with
other names now well-known through-
out the State. On this farm the
missionary, Samuel Leigh, found one
ex-soldier, John Lees, Through the
instrumentality of the Rev. R. Cart-
wright, the Windsor chaplain, Lees had
been led into the light, and when
Samuel Leigh found him he was ear-
nestly serving God, and showing piety
at home. Soon after Leigh’s visit
John Lees commenced the erection of
a place of worship, and on the 7th
October, in the year 1817, this pioneer
sanctuary was publicly dedicated to
the worship of Bod.
The gift of this pioneer, though
primitive, chapel entitles John Lees to
be held in loving remembrance. But
that deed, notable as It is, is one
only in a category of other noble deeds.
Having given this chapel. Lees said,
“I have not done my duty.” He there-
fore proceeded to other generous deeds.
“I will give one acre of my best land,”
the produce of which was to be given
to the mission without deduction. Other
gUfts followed, including many bushels
of wheat, many pounds of tobacco, a
cow and her calf, a horse and liberal
donations in cash. “Put me down for
six guineas,” he said at the mission-
ary meeting held in Princess Street
Chapel. Here his speech was so touch-
ing and powerful that the Attorney-
Secretary pronounced it to be the best
speech of the evening. One year his
gifts realised £45, a fine sum for a
struggling farmer one hundred years
ago. The secret of this liberality was
his genuine piety; and he found giving
the surest and safest way of thriving.
Mindful of these and many other
things which might be written of this
good and brave man, the minister and
the officials of the Penrith Circuit call
oh their fellow-Methodists to do honor
to this Castlereagh farmer —the donor
of the first Methodist Chapel erected
in the southern hempisphere. Let this
timely call be matched by a worthy
response, and thus, as Goldsmith says:
“Learn the luxury of doing good.”
Though the warrior’s sun has set,
Its light shall linger round us yet,
Bright, radiant, blest.

JOHN LEES, OF CASTLE-
REACH
Rev. S. C. Roberts writes from the
Parsonage, Penrith:—
“In the account in last Saturday’s
‘Daily Telegraph* of the first chapel
and ground owned by the Methodists
in Australia, there are two mistakes.
In referring to the passing of Mrs. J.
P. L. Whyte, the daughter of Sarah
Lees, and granddaughter of John
Lees, who gave the first church pro-
perty owned by the Methodists in the
southern world, “Historicus” gave the
credit of welcoming the missionary,
Samuel Leigh, to Richard, the eldest
son of John Lees, instead of to John,
the third son. Mrs. Wright, a grand-
daughter of the first John Lees, and
daughter of his third son, also named
John, is a first cousin to the late Mrs.
Whyte, and both are granddaughters
of the donor of the Castlereagh pro-
perty, Mrs. Wright being the daughter
of John, who was six years of age (so
Rutledge says) when the missionary
was welcomed. There are other mem-
bers of the family living who are
great-grandchildren to the second
John Lees, and who all believe that
it was their grandfather, the younger
John Lees, who welcomed the mis-
sionary, and not Richard, as stated by
‘Historicus.’
“There seem to have been ten chil-
dren to John Lees—Richard, Samuel,
Maria, John, Hannah, Mary, Esther.
Sarah, Timothy, and Cornelius, in that
order. Samuel and Maria, according
to Colwell’s History of Methodism in
Australia, (p. 115), were dead in 1821,
three years after the missionary came.
They are not mentioned in the newly-
discovered will of John Lees. The
others are mentioned in the order I
give, which proves John, and not
Richard, to have been of the age
stated by the missionary.
“The other error is in the picture
of the 1847 church, with the old church
alongside the wrong way around. The
sketch was evidently made right and
reversed in the photograph. The
old church was on the south of the
new one, and not to the north, as
shown in the picture.
“Both these errors are rectified in
the pamphlet published by the Castle-
reagh trustees at the time of the erec-
tion of the memorial to John Lees.
“A further error was in the implica-
tion that the last of the family had
passed out. Seventy-nine of the clan
who have sprung from that patriarch
signed the visitors’ book at the memr
orial service, and there are at least
five grandsons and granddaughters liv-
ing to-day.’’
[ln reply to the above, “Historicus”
writes:—Rev. S. C. Roberts has, I
know, given a lot of time; in research
work in connection with the early his-
tory of th 3 Penrith district, and only
the other day I read with interest an
account of a lecture he delivered be-
fore the Parramatta Historical So-
ciety on “Some Interesting Historical
Relics around Penrith.” He is en-
titled to our thanks for what he is
doing, and anything he says should
be treated with respect. I believe he
is right in regard to the picture he
refers to. which was reproduced from
Rev. James Colwell’s History of
Methodism in Australia. Practically
all the matter contained in the article
was also taken from that admirable
book. But in Mr. Colwell’s History
the name of the son of John Lees,
who greeted the missionary, Samuel
Leigh, is given, not as John, and not
as Richard, but as Robert. Mr. Rob-
erts says it should be John. I gave
it as Richard. Why did I do so?
Simply for the reason that the copy
of the book in my possession was for-
merly the property of the late Mr.
Charles Gorman, a son of Sarah Gor-
man, who was the daughter of John
Lees, and in it he has underlined the
word Robert, and written in the mar-
gin, “Should be Richard.” Mr, Charles
Gorman, who died a few years ago,
and was, together with h}s brother, the
late Mr. Henry Gorman, connected with
the firm of Hardie and Gorman, of Syd-
ney, must have had H irom his mother,
and I submit that the marginal note
he made in the book is the best pos-
sible evidence on the point in dispute.
As to the “implication that the last
>of the family had passed out,” I wrote
nothing of the kind; I simply said
that the last member of the family of
Sarah Lees had died.l

EARLY METHODISM
£ JO, — %/8/tji?-
Sir,—l read with interest the article
by “Historicus” in “The Daily Tele-
graph” of July 26, referring to the
story of John Lees and ea,rly Metho-
dism. Mr. Lees’s son, Richard, who as-
sisted Rev. Samuel Leigh to dismount,
was my father. Mr. Richard Lees
married and reared a numerous fam-
ily, the only surviving children being
Samuel Lees, of Condobolin (credited
as beiife the first Mayor of Condobolin)
and myself, Mrs- Mary M’Kay, of
Forbes.
It might interest “Historicus” to
know that there are six generations of
descendants of John Lees, of Castle-
reagh.—Yours, etc-.
