tioned above.
POLICY
The Dealer also agrees to promptly perform and fulfil all terms and
conditions of the Owner Service Policy.
DIRECTIONS FOR ORDERING GENUINE PARTS
Always make certain that Genuine G.M.?H. Spare Parts are used for
replacements, and order them from your nearest Authorized Chevrolet
Dealer so as to avoid the possibility of having purchased inferior or sub-
stitute parts.
The following are some of the reasons why Genuine Parts only should
be replaced in your vehicle:?
Genuine Parts prolong the life of the vehicle.
Genuine Parts are built up to quality, and not down to price.
Genuine Parts ensure economical transportation.
Genuine Parts are reliable.
Genuine Parts save money, time and worry.
Genuine Parts save labour; they always fit.
Safety demands Genuine Parts.
Genuine Parts are your insurance.


It is understood and agreed that our standard warranty is null and void
on any Chevrolet model where parts not made or sold by us are used in any
replacements or otherwise.
When replacement parts are ordered from our Distributors or Dealers,
describe the parts completely, and specify the truck engine and serial numbers,
location of which may be found on Page 8.
If in doubt as to the proper name of the part required, send the broken
part prepaid to the nearest Authorized Chevrolet Dealer or Parts Distributor,
and write a letter the same date your shipment goes forward stating the
purpose for which the part was returned. When ordering parts by telegram,
always prepay the message.
All Chevrolet Dealers and Authorized Parts Distributors carry a com-
plete stock of essential parts. Therefore delays in the execution of your
order will be eliminated by placing your order with them. Genuine G.M.

Operation, Care and Maintenance
The degree of success attained in the use of any truck, regardless of
price or kind, is a direct result and in direct proportion to the thought and
effort expended in caring for that truck. It therefore rests with the driver
of the truck to do the things recommended by us, or to see that they
performed by an Authorized Chevrolet Dealer.

Like any piece of machinery, the truck requires a certain amount of
care at specified intervals, especially during the first 1000 miles. If the
truck is given this care, a maximum return on the investment in transporta-
tion may be expected, at the minimum cost per mile.


The "Caution? sticker pasted on the windshield should be followed
closely. A new truck should not be driven faster than 30 miles per hour
for the first 1,000 miles. After 1,000 miles the maximum speed should be
increased not more than 5 miles per hour for each additional 100 miles of
driving
The service facilities of all Chevrolet Dealers are at your disposal.
Each Chevrolet Service Station is equipped to serve you. This large service
organization is for your convenience and safeguards your Chevrolet.
CONTROLS AND INSTRUMENTS
The first thing the driver of a new truck must do is to familiarize
himself with the various controls provided for the proper handling of the
truck. This does not apply to the beginner alone, as although there are
many points of similarity between all trucks, there are also important differ-
ences; and it is not wise, regardless of previous experience, to drive a new
truck before fully understanding what each control is for and how to use
it. The following is a brief description of the levers, pedals, instruments
and other devices used in the operation of the Chevrolet Six-cylinder Truck.
DOOR AND IGNITION KEYS
It is* imperative that a record of key numbers be made
both by the dealer and the owner, to protect you in case your
keys are lost.
After a record has been made of the ignition key number, the tab on
the end of the key should be broken off and destroyed.
THROTTLE CONTROL
The speed of the engine is controlled by opening and closing a throttle
valve in the carburetor. This throttle is controlled from the driving com-
partment, both by a foot pedal and a throttle button. The foot pedal, ot
accelerator, is used to increase or decrease the speed of the truck, as required
in driving. The throttle button on the instrument panel is used for idling
or when starting the engine, and may be set in any desired position. Its
normal driving position is close up to the instrument panel. In this posi-
tion the carburetor throttle valve is open just sufficiently to permit the
engine to run at idling speed, after it is thoroughly warmed up. Adjustment
of the idling speed relative to the throttle posit'on may be made at the
carburetor. For starting, the button should be pulled out about \ inch, but
should be partly closed if the engine starts to race. It should, however,
be left slightly open until the engine is warm enough to permit the button
to be returned to its idling position without the engine stalling.
SPARK CONTROL
The regulation of the spark timing is operated automatically by vacuum
from the intake manifold. Additional control is secured by means of the
octane selector on the distributor. With this adjusted to its proper setting,
satisfactory performance from a knock standpoint can be obtained. When
the cheapest fuel is used the selector is retarded and when better fuel is
used the selector is advanced.


Where the
octane rating of the petrol being used is known, the fol
lowing scale can
be used to set the octane selector: ?
40
8 degrees retard
52
6 degrees retard
58
4 degrees retard
64-66 ...
0 setting
72
3 degrees advance
78
... ... 6 degrees advance
80
... ... ... 8 degrees advance
OCTANE SELECTOR
The octane selector provides a simple adjustment whereby the ignition
timing may be advanced or retarded as much as 10 degrees from the stan-
dard setting in order to obtain the most efficient setting for any grade of
petrol used. If the petrol is of a high anti-knock value, greatest power
and economy will be obtained by advancing the spark from the standard
setting. If on the other hand, petrol of a lower than average grade is
used, it may be necessary to retard the spark by means of the octane selector
in order to avoid knocking of the engine.
Fig. 2 ?Octane Selector
I?Scale1?Scale
2 Adjusting Nut
3 Lock Nut
The setting of the octane selector is correct when the engine "pings?
slightly under heavy load. This setting provides maximum fuel economy
and maximum power for the particular fuel being used.
You will note by the above scale that each division of the scale, on the
octane selector, represents TWO degrees of spark timing.
CHOKE CONTROL
When starting a cold engine, it is necessary to provide a fuel mixture
richer in petrol than is ordinarily required. The choke control button oper-
ates a device on the carburetor for enriching the fuel mixture being supplied
to the engine.
The correct use of the choke is extremely important, as if improperly
handled it may seriously affect the life of the engine by the thinning effect
on the lubricating oil, of unburned petrol leaking by the pistons.
The choke control must be pulled out far enough to provide a proper
starting mixture, so that the engine will run evenly without "popping back?
during the warming up period. It must not, however, be pulled out any
further than is necessary to attain these results, and should be returned to
its "off? position against the instrument panel as soon as the engine oper-
ation will permit.


The choke should not be used if the engine retains any heat from
previous running, without first attempting to start the engine with its
normal fuel mixture. It should be unnecessary to use it at all during the
warm weather.
OIL PRESSURE GAUGE
This gauge on the instrument panel is an indicator only and merely
shows whether or not the oil pump is working. The amount of pressure
shown on the oil pressure gauge does not necessarily tell anything about the
condition, or the amount of oil in the crankcase.
If the gauge does not register pressure, when the engine is running,
stop the engine immediately and determine the cause.
AMMETER
This instrument registers the flow of all current to or from the battery,
except that taken by the starting motor. The ammeter reading is an indica-
tion of whether the battery is receiving its proper charging current from
the generator.
PETROL GAUGE
This truck is equipped with an electrically operated petrol gauge
which increases motoring convenience and safety, by placing accurate indica-
tion of the fuel supply directly before the driver at all times when the
ignition switch is on. The dial of the gauge is illuminated by a concealed
bulb to facilitate night reading.
LIGHTING CONTROL
The headlamps and parking lights are controlled by a single switch
which is operated by a button at the lower left-hand corner of the instru-
ment group. When this button is pulled half-way out the parking lights
are lighted. When it is pulled out all of the way the headlamps are lighted.
In addition to this switch control, the direction of the headlamp beam
may be varied by pressure on the foot switch at the left of the toe board.
For city driving the lighting switch should be pulled out all of the way
and the foot switch should be in that position which throws the light nearest
the truck. To throw the light farther ahead for driving on the open road,
depress the foot switch again.
HORN BUTTON
The horn button is located at the centre of the steering wheel.
WATER TEMPERATURE INDICATOR
The water temperature indicator located on the instrument panel func-
tions as a thermometer, indicating the temperature of the water in the cylin-
der head. A metal bulb containing a highly expansive gas is inserted in
the cylinder head and is connected, by a small tube, to the indicating instru-
ment which operates on the same principle as a pressure gauge, but indicating
relative temperatures of the water by gradual movement of the pointer.
STARTING PEDAL
Pressure of this pedal engages the starter mechanism and starts the
electric motor, which cranks the engine. Since the starting motor runs off
the battery and draws considerable current it should not be operated for


(low)
YnY
[ (neutral)
(rev)) (hICh)
more than 10 seconds at a time. Release the starter pedal immediately the
engine starts and do not press it down a second time until the engine has
come to a complete rest. Serious damage may be done to the starting motor
and flywheel if this caution is not observed.
CLUTCH PEDAL
By means of this control the power required in putting the truck in
motion, may be gradually and smoothly transmitted to the rear wheels.
When the clutch pedal is in its normal position, the clutch is engaged
and the engine is directly connected to the transmission. By depressing the
pedal, the clutch is released and the engine disconnected from the trans-
mission gears, permitting the shifting of the transmission gears.
GEAR SHIFT LEVER
By use of the gear shift lever, the transmission gears are correctly
meshed to transmit power to the rear wheels in proper proportion to the
work necessary under various driving conditions.
The lever positions correspond-
ing to the different transmission
gear ratios are shown in Fig. 3.
There are four gears or speeds for-
ward and one reverse. Of the for-
ward gears, first or the low-low
gear, provides the greatest amount
of power with correspondingly low
truck speeds, and is therefore the
correct gear for heavy pulls, as
when getting the truck in motion,
pulling up a very steep grade, or on
Fig. 3 ?Gear Shift Lever Position
the level through heavy sand or mud. Fourth or high gear provides the high
speed driving range. Low or second and intermediate or third gears, as
their names imply, provides the intermediate driving range.
In shifting into reverse position, it is first necessary to raise the finger
lever on the right side of the gear shift lever.
BRAKE PEDAL
Depressing this pedal applies the four-wheel service brakes used for
controlling the momentum of the truck when stopping.
HAND BRAKE LEVER
The hand brake lever operates the internal shoes in the rear drums and is
used chiefly for parking. It is also conveniently used for holding the truck
when getting under way on a steep up-grade.
ENGINE
The engine used in this Chevrolet model is a six-cylinder, four cycle,
valve-in-head type, having a combination of force feed and splash oiling
system. The cylinder firing order is No. 1, No. 5, No. 3, No. 6, No. 2,
No. 4.
Although all of the moving parts of the engine are protected from dust
and grit by suitable covers, foreign substance may creep inside, if it is not

h'M y IS
cleaned occasionally. This slight inconvenience will be more than offset
by the saving in repair bills at some later date.
ADJUSTING VALVES
The space between the rocker arm and the valve stem (Fig. 4) should
be .006 in. on the intake valves and .013 in. on the exhaust valves. The
adjustment should be made when the engine is hot, so that the valve stems
and push rods will be expanded to the limit. If the space is greater than
this, loosen the lock nut on the rocker arm adjusting screw and turn the
screw slightly with a screw driver until the proper clearance is obtained;
then tighten the lock nut so that the adjustment will not come loose. Check
the clearance after the lock nut is tightened, to make sure that the adjust-
ment is correct.
Caution: The necessity for valve adjustment will show itself first by
excessive clicking of valve lifters, and second, by poor running of engine.
It is not necessary to make alterations under any other conditions.

LUBRICATION
Oil is carried in a reservoir located
at the bottom of the crankcase and is
filled through a filler tube on the left
side of the engine, just back of the
generator. (Fig. 5.)
Fill the oil reservoir to the proper
level with the best oil obtainable. Good
oil is cheaper than repair bills; there-

fore, observe this operation regularly and refill when examination proves
the necessity. None but the best grades of the proper viscosity oil should
be used, as complete lubrication depends upon the oil being thoroughly
atomized, so that the oil mist or vapour will reach all working parts of the
engine.
CHANGE OIL IN CRANKCASE
A complete change of engine oil is required more frequently in Winter
than in Summer, on account of the necessity of using the choke during the
Winter months. The excessive use of the choke causes crankcase dilution.
The frequency with which the oil should be changed is also governed
by the mechanical condition of the truck and on how carefully you, as a
driver, handle and care for it.
Fill the oil reservoir by removing the cap on the oil filler pipe on the
left side of the engine. Four quarts of good engine oil of proper viscosity
are required to refill the pan to the full mark on the oil gauge rod.
See article on General Lubrication, page 39, for complete specifications.
OILING SYSTEM
In the Chevrolet oiling system the vane type oil pump (driven indirectl)
by the camshaft), is placed inside the crankcase.

2 Oil Delivery Pipe
3 Rocker Arm Shaft
4?Crankshaft
5 Connecting Rod Dipper
6 Oil Pan Drain Plug
7 Connecting Rod Oil Trough
<S?Oil Pan


The oil pump sucks the oil, through a screen, from the bottom of the
oil pan and delivers it, under pressure, to the centre main and centre
camshaft bearings and through distributing pipes to the front and rear
main and camshaft bearings. See Fig. 6.
The pump also delivers oil to the oil distributor, on the left side of
the engine, where the flow is divided and passes through pipes to the oil
troughs, located under each connecting rod bearing.
When the engine is operating, the oil dippers on the end of the con-
necting rods lift the oil and a portion of it is forced up into the connecting
rod bearings. The rest is broken up into a fine spray or oil mist, which
penetrates to all moving parts of the engine, lubricates them and in turn
drains back to the oil reservoir, where it is picked up by the pump and
used again.
From the high pressure side of the oil distributor a connection leads
to the pressure gauge on the instrument panel, to indicate oil pressure at
this point.
LUBRICATION OF VALVE LIFTERS (TAPPETS)
From the low pressure side of the oil distributor, a pipe carries oil
into the hollow rocker arm shafts. Provision is made to feed just sufficient
oil through a metering groove in the rocker arm bushing to properly lubricate
the valve stems and upper end of the push rod.
A hole is drilled at the top of the rocker arm hub toward the push
rod side, through which oil is fed to the push rod socket. The rapid action
of the rocker arm adjusting screw in the oil-filled socket throws a mist of
oil over all of the valve mechanism including the valve stems. The excess
oil which may overflow from the rocker shafts is returned to the crankcase
through a telescoping tube.
CRANKCASE DILUTION
A phase of engine oil deterioration, probably the most serious of all,
is that of crankcase dilution.
By crankcase dilution, we mean a thinning of the oil on account of
certain portions of the petrol or fuel leaking by the pistons and rings and
mixing with the oil. This condition will be encountered in all classes
of trucks and engines, regardless of make or model. It is always present in
a greater or less degree and must be combated continually.
Careful attention to a few comparatively simple precautions will mini-
mize it and avert real damage.
The causes of crankcase dilution in most cases can be traced directly
to the character of the fuel used. Practically all engine fuels to-day contain
portions which are slow burning and hard to ignite. The thinning of the
engine oil is due to unburned fuel vapour which forces or works its way
past the pistons and rings and in coming in contact with the cool walls in
the crankcase, condenses and is mixed with the oil, thus reducing the body
of the oil and impairing its lubricating qualities.
All engine oils are subject to this dilution.
MECHANICAL CAUSES OF DILUTION
Dilution may be caused by such faults, mechanically, as scored cylin-
ders, poor ring fit, "sloppy? or loose pistons and faulty valves.


Poor ignition, due to any of the following conditions, will also increase
dilution: dead or fouled spark plugs, incorrect timing, faulty coil, distributor,
weak spark or leaky gaskets.
Common causes of incomplete combustion of the fuel are: over-rich
mixture (caused by improper carburetor adjustment) ; restricted air intake
to carburetor; wrong jet or nozzle in carburetor; or air leaks.
WATER IN CRANKCASE
Serious lubrication troubles may result in cold weather by an accumu-
lation of water in the oil reservoir. This condition is as a rule little under-
stood by the truck owner. To demonstrate the chief cause of water in the oil
reservoir, hold a piece of cold metal near the end of the exhaust pipe of
the engine and note the rapid condensation and collection of drops of water
on it. The exhaust gases are charged with water vapour and the moment
these gases strike a cold surface, will condense, forming drops of water.
On account of a certain amount of these gases passing the pistons and
rings, even under the most favourable conditions, we will have the for-
mation of water in the oil reservoir, in a greater or less degree, until the
engine becomes warm. When the engine becomes thoroughly warm, the
crankcase will no longer act as a condenser and all of these gases will pass
out through the crankcase ventilator system.
Short runs in cold weather, such as city driving, will aggravate this
condition.
CORROSION
Practically all present-day engine fuel contains small amounts of sulphur
which, in the state in which it is found, are harmless; but this sulphur on
burning, forms certain gases, a small portion of which is likely to leak past
the pistons and rings and re-acting with water, when present in the crank-
case, form very corrosive acids. The more sulphur in the fuel, the greater
the danger from this type of corrosion. This is a condition which we cannot
wholly avoid, but it may be reduced to a minimum by proper care of the
motor.
As long as the gases and the internal walls of the crankcase are hot
enough to keep water vapour from condensing, no harm will result; but
when an engine is run in low temperatures, moisture will collect and unite
with the gases formed by combustion; thus, acid will be formed and is
likely to cause serious etching or pitting. This etching, pitting or corrosion,
when using fuel containing considerable sulphur, manifests itself in exces-
sively rapid wear on piston pins, camshaft bearings and other moving parts
of the engine, oftentimes causing the owner to blame the truck manufacturer
or the lubricating oil when in reality, the trouble may be traced back to the
character of fuel used, or a condition of the engine, such as excessive blowbys
or improper carburetor adjustment.
CLUTCH
The clutch used on the Chevrolet truck is a standard single plate dry
disc type, consisting of a pressure plate assembly having nine pressure
springs, three release levers and a clutch disc mounted on a drop forged
splined hub. See Fig. 8. The clutch disc is of the torque spring type with
facings riveted to each side of it.


The clutch must be operated dry. A hole is located in the bottom
of the clutch housing underpan to permit any small leakage of oil from the
rear crankshaft bearing, clutch throwout bearing, or transmission to drain off.
The clutch fork is mounted on a swivel. The swivel is screwed in a
shoulder stud in the clutch housing. By means of this mounting, alignment
of the clutch release bearing is maintained because the bearing free to
find its own point of alignment without binding.
The release bearing is made of a carbon graphite composition shrunk
into a trunnion collar mounted in the fork. This collar has an oil reservoir,
which is back of the bearing, with an oiler on the top. This allows the
throwout bearing collar to be filled with oil, which in turn seeps into the
bearing.
To fill the clutch throwout bearing collar with oil remove the cover
plate on the toe board and the inspection cover on the clutch housing.
Driving conditions control the frequency of oiling this reservoir. It should
be filled with S.A.E. 160 oil.

There is only one adjustment necessary on the clutch and that is to
keep the clutch pedal in its proper position, so that it does not touch the
floor board at any time.
If, at any time, the clutch pedal is more than \ inch away from the
end of the slot in the floor board, when the clutch is fully engaged, the
clutch should be re-adjusted as follows: ?
Loosen pedal stop bolt and adjust pedal stop until the clutch pedal
clears end of slot in floor board \ inch. (See Fig. 7.)
Next, tighten or loosen the clutch adjusting bolt until the clutch pedal
will travel 1 inch before the clutch starts to disengage.
NOTE. ?When the position of the pedal stop is changed it is necessary
to re-adjust brakes.

TRANSMISSION
The transmission is of the selective type, having four speed, forward
and one reverse.
The fundamental requirement is to first engage the gears so that the
entire tooth "face? of the sliding gears mesh with those on the countershaft.
Proper engagement can be had by being sure, when shifting gears, that the
gear shift lever travels as far forward, or backward as it will go, before
re-engaging the clutch.
LUBRICATION OF TRANSMISSION
To lubricate the transmission, fill every 1,000 miles with the lubricant
recommended under transmission and rear axle lubricants on Page 40, so
that the oil level stands even with the opening in the filler boss on the
right side of the case.

Once every 5,000 miles it is a good plan to wash out the transmission
with a light oil, to remove any chips of metal knocked off the gears, or
other foreign substances, such as grit or dirt. To do this, remove the drain
plug at the bottom of the transmission case and allow the oil to drain off,
after which flush out the case thoroughly and refill with a heavy oil, such
as specified on Page 40.

UNIVERSAL JOINT
Fig. 10 illustrates the universal joint used in the Chevrolet truck. It
is directly connected to and receives its lubrication from the transmission.
Additional lubrication facilities at this point are unnecessary. The speedo-
meter is driven from a worm and a drive gear mounted on the universal
joint

The pipe plug in the universal joint housing is for manufacturing
purposes and is used to fill the universal joint at time of assembly.
In the and 2-ton trucks the additional propeller shaft length is
provided by a separate forward propeller shaft unit (see Fig. 11 next page).
The front end of the propeller shaft extension is splined to fit the
standard universal joint yoke on the rear of the transmission.
At the cross member, the extension shaft is connected to the front end
of the rear axle third member by an additional universal joint. This
universal joint is enclosed in a housing that is mounted on the second cross
member.
This universal joint yoke differs from the front universal joint in that
the extension shaft runs in a ball bearing pressed into the rear universal
joint housing.
One pound of lubricant should be inserted into the rear universal
joint chamber and inspection made every 1,000 miles. Lubricant of a
viscosity not heavier than regular transmission lubricant should be used.

22 INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPERATING CHEVROLET TRUCKS
Under no consideration should any of the so-called transmission lubricants
of the fibrous type or grease be used.
Lubrication for this universal joint is provided through the pressure
gun fitting on the side of the housing.

FRONT WHEEL LUBRICATION
The front wheels run on New Departure ball bearings which are lub-
ricated by packing the bearings with soft cup grease. See Fig. 28. In
mounting the front wheels, be careful to thoroughly pack the bearing
assembly with grease. The best lubricant for front wheel bearings is a
straight mineral grease entirely free from asbestos fibre or other foreign
matter.
Caution. ?Do not over-lubricate
front wheel bearings, as over-lubri-
cation will cause an accumulation of
grease between the brake drums and
the front brake shoes which will result
in slipping brakes.
By cramping the front wheels, as
indicated in Fig. 12, the two pressure
gun fittings are accessible for easy lub-
rication with a pressure gun, from the
front of the truck. After lubricating
the steering knuckle on one side of
the truck, cramp the wheels in the op-
posite direction and repeat the oiling
operation.
Fig. 12 ?Front Wheel Lubrication


The lubrication of the king pins should not be overlooked; they should
be lubricated every 1,000 miles. Use a chassis lubricant such as specified
under chassis lubrication, Page 40. Do not use oil having graphite or other
substances of this nature in it.
FRONT AXLE
The front axle is so simple in construction that there is little which
can be said concerning it, except that it has a very heavy drop forged "I?
beam and the steering knuckles are held to the axle "I? beam by large king
pins; also, each front wheel is mounted on two New Departure bearings.
Fig. 13 illustrates this sturdy but simple construction.

FRONT WHEEL ALIGNMENT
To make steering easy, it is required that the front wheels should "toe?
in; that is, the distance between the inside faces of the wheel felloes,
measured at the height of the wheel hubs, should be from A inch to inch
more at the rear than at the front. This causes the wheels to grip the road

better and allows the truck to hold its course without undue action on the
steering mechanism, preventing undue tyre wear.
By referring to Fig. 14, the distance indicated by line B?i.e., between
the inner sides of the wheel felloe at the rear of the front wheels?should
be from is inch to inch greater than the distance indicated by line A.
The best method of checking these measurements is by use of a front
wheel tramming device, Fig. 14. Almost any good repair shop or tyre
station is equipped with one of these devices and will check the alignment
of the wheels for you.
Fig. 14 ?Front Wheel Alignment
To decrease the distance at line "A??loosen the adjusting clamp screws
at both ends of the tie rod and turn the tie rod to the right. To increase
this distance turn to the left.
After proper adjustment has been secured, be absolutely certain to
fasten both adjusting clamp screws firmly, as failure to do so may result in
a serious accident to the truck and occupants.
The tie rod ends are equipped with pressure gun fittings for lubrication
and it is most important that the instructions given on the Lubrication Chart
(Fig. 28), be followed.
BRAKES
The brakes are known as an internal expanding type, that is, the brake
shoes expand on the inside of the brake drums on the slightest pressure of
the brake pedal or hand brake lever.
These brakes have been designed and developed to give consistent and
efficient service with long life under all conditions and in order to keep them
so, it is advisable that you follow these suggestions: ?-

Fig. 1 s ?Brake Linkage


1st ?Avoid sudden stopping unless necessary, as this puts an unneces-
sarily severe strain on the truck.
2nd?Do not delay adjusting brakes too long since they are so simple
and easy to adjust.
3rd ?Keep the clevis pins in the brake linkage, oiled.
4th ?Do not try to get the last mile out of the life of the brake linings.
5th ?A skilful driver never de-clutches his motor until the last moment,
as the compression of the motor on closed throttle, materially
helps to slow down and stabilize the truck when stopping.
6th ?Do not reline brakes with a lining other than the Genuine Chevro-
let Lining, sold by all Chevrolet Dealers, as this has been especially
developed for this particular brake.
For all normal adjustments, it is only necessary to adjust the brake
shoes to compensate for wear. After 5,000 to 10,000 miles, according to
the service that the brakes have been subjected to, it is desirable to re-cen-
tralize the cams which operate the brake shoes. The need for this is first
noticed when the brakes are applied and they feel ineffective.
RE-CENTRALIZING SERVICE BRAKES
I?Adjust1?Adjust front wheel bearings to proper tension by tightening or
loosening the steering spindle nut. Caution.?Be sure that both spindle
nuts are cotter-pinned securely.
2 ?Loosen all centralizer clamp bolts, making sure that the centralizer
is free to move by tapping cam operating levers lightly with a hammer.
3 ?Give the brake pedal a moderate push and clamp up the centralizer
bolts with pressure still on the pedal.
ADJUSTING EMERGENCY BRAKE SHOE
Jack up both rear wheels, loosen lock nuts and turn adjusting screws 14
to the right until shoes drag lightly on the drums. Tighten lock nuts on
adjusting screws 14.
Check brakes for equal braking power slacking off on the brake that
pulls the hardest, until all brakes are equal.
Do not attempt to adjust brakes by altering linkage; this is set at the
factory and does not require any further adjustment. Should this by acci-
dent or other cause require re-setting, the linkage should be adjusted by an
Authorized Chevrolet Service Station.
REAR AXLE
The rear axle on the Chevrolet truck is of the semi-floating type. The
axle shafts are supported on the outer ends by heavy duty ball bearings. A
glance at the illustration, Fig. 16, shows the construction and relative posi-
tions of the various units.
Every 5,000 miles it is a good plan to wash out the rear axle, to remove
any foreign substance, such as dirt or grit. To do this, remove the filler
plug, at the rear, and drain the oil. Then flush out thoroughly with a light
flushing oil and refill to the level of the plug, with a heavy oil, such as
specified on Page 40.

Petrol sold at most filling stations is filtered. It is a good plan when
filling the tank from any other source to strain the petrol before placing it
in the tank, in order to remove any sediment which might otherwise clog the
filter screen in the fuel pump.
In order that the petrol will flow properly to the carburetor, there is
a small hole in the top of the filler cap on the tank, so that air can enter as
the quantity of petrol in the tank is decreased. It is essential that this hole
be kept open.

CARBURETOR
The carburetor measures the fuel for the engine and automatically
mixes it with the proper amount of air to form a highly combustible gas.
The carburetor used on this model is known as the plain tube downdraught
type. Adjustment of the idle adjustment screw is the only mixture adjust-
ment on the carburetor.
Connected with the throttle and built into the carburetor is an acceler-
ating pump. This consists of a cylinder, with a plunger containing an air
bell and two gas check valves, one on the inlet and one on the outlet side.
The upward movement of the plunger, when the throttle is closed, draws
the fuel into the bottom of the cylinder. The slightest opening of the
throttle causes an immediate discharge through a jet pointing downward
into the main venturi.
The starting mixture is controlled by a button on the instrument panel
marked "Choke.? Pulling this button out closes a butterfly valve which
is hinged in the centre with one-half being spring controlled. When the
choke button is pulled all of the way out a trigger lock limits the movement
of this spring controlled valve, admitting only the right amount of air,


when the engine fires, to keep the engine running. As soon as the choke
button is released slightly, the hinged half opens and acts as an air valve
during the warming up period. This prevents overloading and produces a
smooth running mixture with a cold engine.
TO CLEAN CARBURETOR
The carburetor bowl should be cleaned every 5,000 miles. Remove
the screws which hold the bowl cover to the carburetor and remove the
bowl cover together with the float.
Remove all particles of lint and dirt from the inside. When re-assemb-
ling, make certain that the bowl cover gasket is smooth and in place on the
surface of the body of the carburetor, before replacing the bowl cover.
Tighten screws securely.
ADJUSTMENT
The carburetors have been carefully tested and adjusted to the engine,
before leaving the factory. Too often adjustments are made to the car-
buretor, when in reality, something else is causing uneven running or the
engine has not thoroughly warmed up.
There are two adjustments on the carburetor, one for idling mixture
and the other for idling speed.
To adjust the idling mixture proceed as follows:
Open the idle adjusting screw from \ to 1 turn open. Let engine
idle. Try turning screw both ways from this position until the best setting
is made.
To adjust for idling speed proceed as follows:
With the hand throttle on the instrument panel closed, set the throttle
lever stop screw so that the engine runs at approximately 350 revolutions
per minute. If the engine runs too fast, back the screw out. If too slow,
turn in until the proper speed is obtained. Best results in both performance
and economy are obtained with the mixture set as lean as possible.
ACCELERATING PUMP
An accelerating pump is required to insure positive, smooth acceler-
ation. The Chevrolet pump arm has three holes for the connector link,
giving short, medium and long strokes. The medium stroke is correct for
ordinary temperatures and standard petrol. Short stroke should be used
in extremely hot climates, at high altitudes or with high test fuel. The
long stroke is for use in extremely cold climates.
To set the pump arm it is necessary to remove the cover from the top
of the accelerating pump.
Fig. 19 ?Accelerating Pump Lever
1? Long Stroke
2 Medium Stroke
3 Short Stroke


Ic is also important that the countershaft that operates the accelerating
pump, be lubricated at least once every 5,000 miles. To lubricate this
shaft, remove screw attaching the dust cover and fill the threaded hole with
graphite grease.
FUEL PUMP
The fuel pump (Fig. 20) is of the diaphragm type and is attached to
the crankcase and is operated from an eccentric on the camshaft.
The diaphragm is composed of several layers of specially treated flexible
cloth which is absolutely impervious to petrol and benzol. This cloth
material is held between two metal discs and is pushed upward by a pump
spring. This diaphragm, in its upward motion, almost fills the pump
chamber so that, in its downward movement, a very high vacuum is obtained,
thus assuring high pumping capacity, even at low speeds.
This movement is controlled by linkage because, when the diaphragm
is in the depressed position, due to sufficient fuel in the carburetor, the up
and down movement of the fuel pump link ceases and the rocker arm spring
keeps the rocker arm in contact with the eccentric on the camshaft.

AIR CLEANER
The air cleaner is a combination air cleaner and flame arrester. All air,
which enters the carburetor, must pass through a filter element, made of
fine copper mesh, finely woven into a disc one inch thick. This unit is
saturated with oil. Any particles of dirt in the incoming air are caught
by the film of oil on the copper mesh and are prevented from entering the
carburetor.
Any flame which may be caused by a backfire through the carburetor
is prevented from reaching the open air by this same copper mesh unit,
which functions much as a miner's
lamp, preventing ignition of oil on
the engine parts and resulting fires.
Under ordinary conditions, where
the truck is driven on pavement and
gravel roads, the air cleaner must be
removed every 2,500 miles and the
dirt that has collected on the copper
mesh cleaned out. This is done by
removing the air cleaner from the
carburetor, then removing the top
cover and felt pad and slushing that
part of the air cleaner that contains
the copper mesh in petrol and then
dipping it in engine oil.
Under extreme conditions, or
when the truck is driven on gravel
and dirt roads all of the time, this
must be done every 1,000 miles.

SYSTEM
The radiator at all times should be kept full of clean water. It is
a good plan to form the habit of inspecting and filling the radiator before
the truck is taken from the garage. On long tours, especially after travelling
over hilly roads or those with a loose top surface, examine the water supply
frequently. Consider, always, that the proper amount of water is as import-
ant as your supply of petrol and oil. It is well to examine the water supply
every time a stop is made for oil or petrol.
Always use clear water. If rain water can be had, use it, as less scale
or deposit will result. The total capacity is 10 quarts.
Once a month it is a good plan to open the radiator drain cock, which
is conveniently located on the right side at the bottom of the radiator, and
let all the water and accumulated dirt run out. If the water is very dirty,
flush the radiator with fresh water.
Never pour cold water into the radiator or cooling system while the
motor is hot, as it will crack the cylinder head.


It is not a good plan to put anti-leak compounds, corn meal, bran or
other similar substances in a radiator, to stop a leak. It fouls the tubes
and decreases the efficiency of the radiator. Make a permanent repair as
soon as a leak is discovered.
Fig. 22 ?Coolmg System
WATER PUMP
The water pump circulates the water in the cooling system and, by the
adoption of balanced impeller blades, the life of the thrust washer is leng-
thened and the water pump efficiency maintained.
The water pump packing, which is called the pre-formed metallic type,
is assembled in the pump body in two halves, with a pressed steel spacer
between them. The cavity in the spacer receives the grease from the grease
cup and delivers it to both halves of the packing and the rear bushing.
With this type of packing and spacer, the operation of tightening the pack-
ing nut against the packing is reduced to infrequent intervals.
When the packing nut has reached its limit of travel against the pack-
ing, new packings should be installed.
There is an oil cup, in the water pump body, just above the front water
pump bushing, which should be lubricated every 1,000 miles. The oil cup
should be filled with a good grade of engine oil which will allow the oil
to soak into the bushing.
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
The electrical system used on Chevrolet trucks is called the double
unit system with ground return and consists of the following units: gener-

r \ vY \Q^$?*9 ENEr>l '~
/( (//X-?^^^~r^\^-^ T ' N

\V j fX DRIVE PULLEY
ator, starting motor, distributor, ignition cod, wiring harness, storage battery,
circuit breaker, ammeter, petrol gauge, horn, ignition lock, lighting and
foot control switches and lamps.
Each one of these units is self-contained and requires very little atten-
tion from the owner. There may be times, however, when expert advice is
required. When this is necessary, consult your Chevrolet Dealer.
GENERATOR
The construction of the generator is as simple as such a piece of elect-
rical equipment can be made and, beyond a few drops of oil every 1,000
miles, requires no special attention.
The generator and connections should be examined occasionally to see
that all are tight. If trouble in the generator is suspected or if the ammeter
does not show a proper charging rate at ten or twelve miles an hour, the
truck should be taken to the Chevrolet Dealer or Service Station for examina-
tion and possible necessary repair.
When cold weather arrives, we suggest that you call at your Chevrolet
Dealer?s Service Station and have the third brush on your generator advanced
slightly, thus increasing the charging rate. This suggestion is made because
of the fact that more current is required in cold weather driving than in
Summer driving. STARTING MOTOR
The starting motor is mounted on the clutch housing, having a pinion
which automatically engages the flywheel when the starter pedal is depressed.
As soon as the motor starts under its own power, the foot should be
removed from the starter pedal and the starter pinion will automatically be
disengaged from the flywheel.
FAN AND GENERATOR BELT ADJUSTMENT
The fan and generator belt is so designed that very little adjustment
is required.
The belt should not be tight, only having sufficient tension to keep it
from being thrown off the pulleys when the motor is run at a high speed.
By referring to Fig. 23, this method of adjusting the belt will be made
clear. All that is necessary to do when
the belt needs adjustment is to loosen
the clamp bolt and pull the generator
outward and away from the motor,
tightening clamp bolt securely.
TO REPLACE FAN AND
GENERATOR BELT
Loosen generator adjusting nut
(Fig. 23) and move generator toward
the motor as far as it will go. Then
place the belt over the pulleys; then
pull the generator outward and away
from the motor and tighten the adjust-
ing nut. Do not run the motor with
the fan and generator belt too tight.
See that it has a small amount of
"slack.?

IGNITION
The motor derives its power from the explosion and expansion of com-
pressed gas in the combustion chambers, the expansion driving the pistons
down, which produces power.
These charges of gas are ignited by an electric spark made in the com-
bustion chamber.
The ignition equipment used on Chevrolet trucks is designed to give
an even, hot spark at all times, regardless of motor speed. It is therefore
possible to run your truck at slow speeds with an even flow of power and
also, to accelerate without stalling.
SPARK PLUGS
Spark plugs will not deliver their maximum spark unless the sparking
points are properly spaced and the spark gap of these plugs should be set
at .028 inches.
Cleaning the sparking points of plugs should be done with emery cloth.
The correct spark plug for Chevrolet trucks can be had at all Chevrolet
Service Stations.
To clean carbon from the porcelain, proceed in the following manner:
Fill the lower part of the plug with alcohol, or any liquid metal polish,
and allow to stand for a few seconds; take a piece of wire covered with one
thickness of cloth and rub the carbon from the porcelain, so as not to affect
the glaze; then wipe clean and dry thoroughly before replacing in the motor.
Spark plugs should be changed every 10,000 miles, as they deteriorate.
New spark plugs mean quick starting, increased power, smoother running
motor and less use of choke, resulting in more economical operation of the
truck.
DISTRIBUTOR
The distributor is the automatic vacuum type, which means that the
spark is operated automatically by vacuum from the intake manifold. The
condenser is mounted in the unit, instead of in the coil.
The distributor requires no special attention, except turning down the
grease cup one-quarter turn every 1,000 miles and occasionally examining
the spring contact point on the top of the distributor arm. This spring
makes contact with the centre point in the distributor head.
LIGHTING SYSTEM
The lighting system used is commonly called the single wire with
ground return and includes headlamps, instrument panel light and tail light.
The lighting system is controlled from the lighting switch on the instru-
ment panel.
The lamps used on Chevrolet trucks embody the depressible beam and
fixed focus feature- i.e., the 21-candle power bulbs are provided with two
separate filaments, one being on the exact centre of the reflector and the
other filament slightly above the centre of the reflector. The candle power
of each filament is the same; therefore, the deflection of the light beam
from the upper filament to the lower does not affect the brightness of the
beam.

The headlamps are properly aimed at the factory and reaiming should
not be necessary, unless the adjustment of the headlamp support bolt nut
has been disturbed.

All Chevrolet trucks are
equipped with a combina-
tion stop and tail lamp.
The stop and tail lamp is
built in a unit containing
two bulbs. The stop lamp
is a single contact six-volt,
fifteen candle power bulb,
while the tail lamp is a
single contact six-volt,
three candle power bulb.
When the tail lamp is
on and the stop lamp is
off, the upper part of the
stop lamp is dark, but as
soon as the brake pedal is
pressed forward slightly,
the upper part of the stop
lamp is illuminated and
remains bright until the
brake pressure is released.

The switch operating lever on brake cross shaft should be adjusted so
that switch will make contact just as the brake begins to engage.
The stop lamp switch is entirely self contained and is serviced as a
unit only. The switch operating lever which attaches to the brake cross shaft
is sold separately.
CARE OF
BATTERY
The battery requires very little
necessary. Negligence in this respect
or short life.
attention, but that little is absolutely
is the principal cause of battery failure
Distilled water should be added
to the battery at such intervals as will
insure the plates being covered at all times. Usually, water should be added
once a week in Summer and twice monthly in Winter.
To prevent corrosion of battery terminals and connections, apply a
coating of petroleum jelly over the battery posts and strap terminals, making
sure that connections are properly tightened. If corrosion occurs, clean posts
and terminals with a strong soda solution before applying vaseline jelly.
See that the filler plugs are tight and the top of the battery kept dry.
An occasional inspection should be made of the ground strap connec-
tion between the battery and the frame as looseness in this connection is a
frequent cause of burning out of headlamp bulbs.
Periodical hydrometer readings are advisable and this inspection will
be made by the Battery Service Station.

Example of Use of Tables. ?The specific gravity of the acid in a battery
is found to be 1.140. From the above table it will be found that the battery
is almost fully discharged.
Batteries over half discharged should be used sparingly until, by charg-
ing, the specific gravity is brought up to at least 1.180 in New South Wales,
Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, and 1.150 in Queensland, Western
Australia and the Northern Territory.
If the truck is to be laid up for the winter, take the battery to an
Authorized Battery Station for proper storage.
It is not necessary to add acid to the battery. Except in cases of broken
jar or deterioration of the sealing compound, loss of acid does not occur.
It is inadvisable for truck owners to experiment with so-called quick electro-
lytes for the purpose of keeping the battery fully charged.
GENERAL LUBRICATION
Your Chevrolet dealer is equipped to render complete lub-
rication service. We recommend that you take advantage of
his specialized equipment and trained men when in need of
this type of service.
Oils and greases are much cheaper than repair bills and
should be applied regularly if you are to secure a maximum
of useful service from your truck. It is consequently important
that the proper grade of oil, as noted on lubrication chart
(Fig. 28), should be used.
The selection of lubricants should be one of the first concerns of the
owner as the life of the automobile is, to a great extent, dependent upon the
rapidity at which moving parts become worn. The minimum wear can
be obtained only through the use of the correct lubricants properly applied.
The determining factor of correct lubrication is the ability of the oil
or lubricant used to maintain an unbroken oil film on the surfaces of the
moving parts under all conditions of operation.
The correct grade of oil required to maintain an oil film is dependent
upon various factors, such as, type of lubrication system used, bearing
materials, bearing pressure and speeds, also method by which lubricant
is carried to the bearings. It is also dependent upon the viscosity
or fluidity of the oil.


S.A.E. VISCOSITY NUMBERS
The viscosity of a lubricant is simply a measure of its body or fluidity.
The S.A.E. viscosity numbers constitute a classification of lubricants in terms
of viscosity, or fluidity, but without reference to any other characteristics
or properties.
The refiner or marketer supplying the oil is responsible
for the quality of its product. Their reputation is the truck
owner?s best indication of quality.
In most territories throughout Australia engine oil of the same viscosity
may be used winter and summer. Where temperatures approach freezing
point an oil of lighter grade should be used.
ENGINE LUBRICATION
For proper engine lubrication, a well refined oil is essential. We do
not recommend the use of so-called re-refined oils, as we find that unless
extreme care is used in the refining process, they are wholly unsuited for
use in Chevrolet engines.
Increase in speed will result in the increase of oil consumption.
It is important that not over 4 quarts of oil be used in a refilling of
the crankcase.
ENGINE OIL?NEW TRUCK
For the First 300 Miles
When the truck leaves the Factory the crankcase is filled with a light
bodied S.A.E. 20, which should be used for the first 500 miles or breaking-
in period. On completion of the first 500 miles, crankcase must be drained
and refilled with an oil having a viscosity of S.A.E. 30. Charts issued by
the major oil companies show the correct grade.
All oils become more viscous and do not flow as readily at low tem-
peratures as they do at high temperatures. If the oil becomes too thick
or high in viscosity at low temperatures, it will be difficult or impossible
to start the engine. If the engine is started the oil may be too thick or
high in viscosity to flow to the points requiring lubrication, and may result
in "burned-out? bearings.
Of importance is the fact that the use of the lighter oils will insure the
flow of the oil, in a minimum of time, to those points requiring lubrication
and thus prevent the ''burning out? of bearings.
A complete change of motor oil is required more frequently in Winter
than in Summer, on account of the necessity of using the choke during the
Winter months. The excessive use of the choke causes crankcase dilution.
The frequency with which the oil should be changed is also governed
by the mechanical condition of the truck and on how carefully you, as a
driver, handle it and care for it.
TRANSMISSION AND REAR AXLE LUBRICANTS
Lubricants containing solid materials in suspension are undesirable for
ball or roller bearing lubrication.
A lubricant having the viscosity, or body, of S.A.E. 160 is recommended.
CHASSIS LUBRICATION
For chassis lubrication consult the lubrication chart (Fig. 28) which
shows the points to be lubricated and how often they should be lubricated.

Chassis lubricants, or lubricants ordinarily applied by means of a pres-
sure gun, are made from mineral oils having a viscosity between 300 and
500 seconds Saybolt Universal at 100 degrees F. and contain 8 to 11%
calcium soap. The addition of the soap decreases the tendency of the lub-
ricant to leak from the bearings in service. The consistency of these lub-
ricants is regulated to permit satisfactory operation with the types of pres-
sure guns found on the market.
Most of the chassis lubricants on the market are of the type recom-
mended above.
LUBRICATION OF BRAKE LINKAGE
The brake linkage, or clevis pins, rods, etcetera, should be lubricated
with chassis lubricant which will insure the correct operation of these units.
LUBRICATION OF SPRINGS
It may be desired to oil the springs. This can easily be done by brush-
ing the sides of both front and rear springs with the oil drained from the
crankcase.
Miscellaneous Data
ICE ON WINDSHIELD
If you are troubled with snow and ice sticking to the windshield, this
condition may be remedied by rubbing a thin film of glycerine on the wind-
shield glass.
TYRE PRESSURE
Examine the tyres to see that they are not damaged or under inflated.
Recommended pressures will be found on page 8.
These are very important, for the reason that if the deflection is too
great ?i.e., if the tyres flatten out too much under load, due to under
inflation?trouble is sure to follow.
A drop of even two or three pounds in pressure quickly affects tread
wear. The edges of the tread are subjected to a scuffing or wiping action,
which rapidly ruins the tread.
To secure best results from tyres, they must be inflated to pressures as
indicated on page 8 and should be tested frequently, to insure that the pres-
sure does not drop more than three pounds before they are again inflated.
Summary
I?Lubrication:1 ?Lubrication:
Check motor oil level and add a good grade of cylinder oil when neces-
sary. Lubricate chassis at regular intervals, according to Lubricating
Chart (Fig. 28).
2 Cooling System:
Keep radiator and cooling system filled with clean water.
3 Storage Battery:
Every two weeks, inspect storage battery and add distilled water, when
necessary, to insure battery efficiency.
4 Do not "ride the clutch?? by slightly depressing the clutch when driving.
This practice will cause early renewal of clutch parts.


5- ?Do not step on starter pedal the second time, until motor has come to
rest, as injury to flywheel and starter pinion may result.
6 Use low speed gear in transmission when starting, rather than second
or intermediate, as by so doing early renewal of clutch and transmission
parts will be eliminated. The low speed gear is installed for a purpose
?let?s use it.
7 Save your brakes by leaving the clutch pedal engaged when descending
a hill. The motor compression will assist in the braking effect.
8 ? Consult your Authorized Chevrolet Dealer on your truck problems?his
mechanics are trained; his tools are standardized and approved; his
methods are efficient; his labour rates are equitable; he uses Genuine
Chevrolet Parts for replacement.
