Invocation
“To know the love of Christ . . . that ye might
be filled with all the fulness of God.”
O Love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee:
! give Thee back the life I owe.
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.
O Light that followest all my way,
1 yield my flickering torch to Thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray.
That in Thy sunshine's blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.
0 Joy that seckest me through pain,
1 cannot close my heart to Thee;
1 trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be.
0 Cross that lifteet up my head,
1 dare not ask to fly from Thee:
1 lay in dust life’s glory dead.
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be. Amen.
Rev. John Edwards, M.A., Junior Clerk of
Assembly.
Right Rev. G. R. S. Reid, M.A., Moderator of
Assembly.
Jprttger :
Very Rev. R. Scott West, D.D., Ex Moderator-
General.
“My heart and my flesh crieth out
for the living God.”
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Though, like the wanderer.
Nearer to Thee! The sun gone down.
Even though it be a cross Darkness be over me,
That raiseth me, My rest a stone,
Still all my song would be. Yet in my dreams I’d be
“Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!” Nearer to Thee!


There let the way appear
Steps unto heaven.
All that Thou send’st to me
In mercy given,
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I’ll raise,—
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
