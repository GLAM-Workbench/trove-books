ACTIVITIES AND INTERESTS
This company since incorporation in 1921, and more
particularly in the last decade, has shown substantial
development, growing into one of the major industrial
undertakings in the Commonwealth. With subsidiaries
and associated companies, it operates 65 factories in
Australia and holds substantial manufacturing interests
in New Zealand and South Africa.
It is the largest organisation in Australia concerned
with the scouring and carbonising of wool, the making
of wool-tops and the production of felt products and
piecegoods, felt floor coverings, carpets and footwear.
Operations of the group are entirely integrated, each
unit operating virtually as an independent entity but
relying on other units for raw materials and on the
parent company for specialised advisory and other
services with regard to finance, technical processes and
marketing.
Since 1939, paid-up share capital has risen from
£831,914 to £4,349,674, while the company has the
benefit of £1,000,000 of 4 per cent, debenture capital.
During the same period turnover has risen from
£1,750,000 to over £17,000,000 ; the group’s processing
of wool has risen from 15,000,000 lb. per annum to
55,000,000 lb. per annum, while employees in Australia
number more than 7000 persons, of whom about 16
per cent, are employed in country factories.
Wool is purchased in its greasy state by four sub-
sidiaries, which process it principally for use by other
subsidiaries in the production of a wide variety of
woollen felts and woven cloths, which, in turn, pass
on to other companies for conversion into industrial
and domestic felt products, floor coverings, slippers
and shoes on the one hand, and clothing, furnishings
and similar products on the other. A substantial
quantity of wool is also processed for export and com


mission customers. In addition, the company and its
subsidiaries carry out the manufacture of a number of
miscellaneous articles, most of which are closely allied
to its central processing and manufacturing functions.
PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS
The company’s operations fall under the following
main headings :
Wool. —Scouring and carbonising, and the pro-
duction of wool tops, as a basis for the operations of
the manufacturing subsidiaries in the group, or for
sale to other Australian manufacturers or export to the
principal wool-consuming countries.
Felts.— The manufacture of “Feltex” floor cover-
ings as well as felt piecegoods for use by subsidiaries,
particularly in the manufacture of footwear and furnish-
ings for the motor body building industry, and a wide
variety of industrial and domestic felt products.
Spinning.— The spinning of woollen and worsted
yams for a wide range of woven products, both domestic
and technical.
Weaving. —The manufacture of suiting, dress and
furnishing fabrics and specialised cloths, such as tennis
ball cloths, printers’ blankets, etc.
Cabpets.— The production of Wilton and Axminster
body carpets, plain, stippled and patterned.
Footwear.— The manufacture of shoes and slippers,
using felt as the base material, and also the production
of leather and other types of boots, shoes and slippers.
Overseas Interests.— The company holds 245,000
ordinary shares of £1 f.pd. in Felt and Textiles of New
Zealand Ltd. (paid capital £726,000, in 250,000 5 per
cent, cumulative £1 preference shares and 475,000 £1
ordinary shares), 500,335 ordinary shares of £1 f.pd.
in Korma Textiles (N.Z.) Ltd. (paid capital £973,377,
in 250,000 5 per cent, cumulative £1 preference shares

PROFIT AND DIVIDENDS
Larger production and greater turnover were
achieved in 1949, and net profit of the company and its
subsidiaries advanced by £30,443 to a new record of
£564,783. This figure was shown after increasing
ordinary and special depreciation provisions by £109,684
to £438,504, and reducing provision for taxation by
£40,634 to £480,306.
Earnings on average ordinary capital were equivalent
to 26.3 per cent, as compared with 28.3 per cent, in
the previous year, owing to the larger average capital
employed for the period and the fact that a full year’s
dividend (£50,400) was paid on the third preference
capital.
It should be realised that some capital employed
during 1949 was not fully revenue-producing, as large
sums expended on buildings and machinery which came
into production later in the year, did not contribute
to profits to the extent they would have done had
capacity production been possible earlier in the period.
In this regard no profit benefit was realised from the
new ordinary share issue of £949,891 which was sub-

scribed by shareholders in June 1949. The advantages
of this new capital should become apparent in the
current and subsequent financial years.
The substantial increase which has taken place
both in capital and net earnings over the last 13 years
has been due largely to the continuing widening of
ramifications, and the purchase of established businesses,
plus greatly increased sales at higher price levels.
In the last 11 years reserves and undivided profits
have risen from £215,615 to £2,533,562, equal to 58
per cent, of total paid-up capital of £4,349,674. The
reserves exclude a special provision of £160,000 against
possible recession in wool prices and a debenture sinking
fund of £73,540. It should be borne in mind, also,
that book values of freeholds are considerably below
present market values, whilst plant and machinery
have been adequately depreciated and are kept in
up-to-date working condition.
The appended table illustrates the group’s record of
profits and dividends since the public became interested
in it in 1937, and shows the remarkable manner in
which profits have increased during the period.

FINANCIAL POSITION
The introduction of £1,054,891 of ordinary capital
in 1949 with an additional £800,932 of outside indebted-
ness, enabled the additions of £975,577 to current assets
and £1,505,643 to fixed assets. Consolidated accounts
of the company and its subsidiaries now show outside
liabilities of £7,595,932 covered by current assets of
£8,477,564 and fixed assets of £5,384,457. Included
in the liabilities are the £1,000,000 4 per cent, debentures,
bank overdrafts of £2,821,386 (down £136,974) and
Sundry creditors £1,310,255 (up £370,567). The over-
all advance in liabilities was due substantially to the
larger stocks of raw wool being carried at higher prices
and the larger quantities of processed items held against
the increasing demand for the group’s manufactures.
At 30th June each year the group’s outside liabilities
and stocks are at their maximum, chiefly because of
the necessity of carrying sufficient stocks of wool to
enable continuity of production until required types
again become available. If the balance-date were
31st December the accounts would show a considerably
Materials Price Reserve £160,000 and Debenture Sinking Fund
Reserve, £73,540. *; Dividend requirements, based on 12} per
cent, ordinary dividends, which will have to be met by the company
in 1950. The 1949 net profit comfortably covers those charges.

lower volume of stocks and of outside liabilities. As
with all great manufacturing companies, the volume of
stocks varies substantially between the manufacturing
season and the selling season, which necessarily means
wide fluctuations in bank overdrafts. The new ordinary
capital which has been brought into the business will
further strengthen the group’s financial structure by
reducing the proportionate relationship of outside
liabilities to shareholders’ funds.
Of current assets, £6,054,271 is accounted for by
stock which increased by £710,127 during the year.
A very material proportion of stocks is represented by
raw or processed wool, and a reserve of £160,000 has
been created to offset the effect of any possible recession
in the price of wool. The acquisition of additional
businesses has also contributed to the increase in stocks,
as well as to the advance of £295,410 in sundry debtors
to £2,383,929. A contributing factor to the larger
debtors was the higher general level of selling prices
for the company’s products.
Although land, buildings, plant, etc., were written
down by £438,504 during the year, the balance-sheet
valuation increased by £1,498,154 owing to the acquisi-
tion of new interests and to the expansion of existing
spinning and weaving, clothing, carpet, felt, footwear,
scouring and carbonising plants.
Reserves and undivided profits amount to £2,533,562,
subject to intangibles of £777,147, but excluding the
Raw Materials Reserve and the Debenture Sinking Fund
Reserve, giving net tangible assets of 32/4 per fully
paid £1 ordinary share.

DIRECTION AND MANAGEMENT
The development of the company furnishes a
striking example of the importance of experienced
direction and management, coupled with shrewd
judgment and foresight. The Board of Directors
comprises men of outstanding experience covering a


wide range of industrial, commercial and financial
activities.
The Honorable Sir Walter Massy-Greene, K.C.M.G.,
has been chairman since 1937, and is in the forefront
of industrial leaders in Australia, besides having
achieved great prominence in public affairs. He is
chairman of many important companies, including
Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australia Ltd., Bradford
Cotton Mills Ltd. and Associated Pulp & Paper Mills
Ltd., as well as a Director of Yarra Palis Ltd.,
Australian Knitting Mills Ltd., North Broken Hill Ltd.
and other companies.
The Right Honorable Sir George Pearce, K.C.V.0.,
has been a member of the Board (representing the
public capital) since 1939. For 37 years he was a
member of the Commonwealth Senate, holding
ministerial office for 25 years, and later rendering signal
service in a number of advisory positions to the Com-
monwealth Government during World War 11. He
has pastoral interests in Western Australia.
Messrs. W. A. Ince and L. A. Lochrin are well-known
solicitors with wide interests in business and industry,
whilst the other four Directors all hold high executive
positions in the Felt and Textiles organisation.
Mr. Rhodes-Smith became Managing Director in
1947 in succession to the late Henri Van de Velde,
who played a major part in the development of the
organisation from a small unit into one of the greatest
industrial groups in the Commonwealth. After joining
the company in 1937 Mr. Rhodes-Smith, who had had
wide experience as a wool buyer and exporter, worked
in close collaboration with Mr. Van de Velde until the
latter’s death, and his appointment to the chief
executive position was a natural outcome of his former
close association with Mr. Van de Velde and with the
progressive development and expansion of the organisa-
tion.
Mr. J. H. Titchen, Chartered Accountant (Australia),
has been the principal financial executive of the
company since 1926 and Secretary since 1938, whilst
Mr. L. B. Jacobs has been associated with the group


since 1931, and was successively Melbourne Secretary,
Melbourne Manager and later executive Director in
Victoria. Mr. H. W. Rowden is a Public Accountant
in New Zealand and has been associated with the
company’s business in that country since inception in
1929, becoming Managing Director of Felt and Textiles
of New Zealand Limited in 1941.
Each particular unit in the organisation is under the
management of an experienced executive, most of
whom have spent a lifetime in the business, and due
provision has been made for the training of future
executives. The organisation of the business is, there-
fore, based primarily on the policy of providing the
most efficient possible direction and management of
the company’s operations both now and in the future.
FUTURE OF THE COMPANY
Outstanding progress and widespread development
have been achieved by the company over the last 12
years, during which period there has been continual
consolidation of the integrated and varied operations
carried out by the group. Expansion of aggregate
production by the introduction of further plant and
machinery and greater manufacturing efficiency, together
with the addition of new lines from time to time, are
broadening the base for larger sales and profits.
Although competitive conditions now exist in some
sections of the business, resulting from the return of a
buyers’ market, the group is still unable fully to meet
the demand for many of its products, notably, “Feltex”
floor coverings and other felt manufactures, carpets,
hairfelt, and finished woollen and worsted fabrics.
As the largest single user of Australian wool in the
Commonwealth, it has, ready to hand, a large source
of supply of some of the finest wools produced in the
world. A considerable proportion of the wools pur-
chased by the organisation is for its essential manu-
facturing requirements. Scoured and carbonised wools,
wool tops and noils produced by the subsidiary wool
companies are used in the groups own spinning, weaving
and felt mills, which in turn sell a large portion of their


production to the carpet, clothing and footwear sub-
sidiaries. Wools other than for the group’s own
manufacturing companies are pm-chased against firm
orders for the organisation’s products received from
customers, and are held for the fulfilment of contracts.
Thus, the company’s wool subsidiaries are established
and conducted on a sound basis, while adequate pro-
vision has been made to meet any possible fall in the
price of wool, a contingency which is not apparent at
present.
The group has an expert and experienced staff of
wool buyers, and a well-established world-wide selling
organisation. Close contact is maintained with over-
seas textile mills, who are customers for the wool
products which are sold for export, a considerable
quantity of which are sold to Canada, the United
States of America, and other hard currency countries.
There is a large and increasing demand from every
country for these wool products.
Woollen felt production has been increased, and, in
an endeavour to meet the demand, a programme of
expansion involving new factories and plant has been
initiated. When completed, volume of output will be
increased and a larger variety of products will be
available to the trade, whose requirements are becoming
greater.
A considerable section of the carpet manufacturing
plant is in production, but further units remain to be
brought into operation. The company has as its
associate in this industry The Carpet Manufacturing
Co. Ltd., of Kidderminster, England, and increased
production of both Wilton and Axminster carpets will
result as new plant is received from England.
Spinning and weaving activities have been extended,
and attractive ranges of fabrics are being turned out
for both men’s and women’s wearing apparel. Pro-
duction of multiple-fitting suits has been developed
satisfactorily.
The footwear and accessories section of the group’s
business is fully employed. Larger production has


emanated from the addition to the number of pro-
prietary lines made, which are finding ready acceptance
in the trade. Other sections of the organisation’s
business are being developed.
Benefits from the increases in capital over the last
few years and the installation of new plant and
machinery have not yet been fully reflected in profits,
which should show continued expansion. The half-
yearly interim ordinary dividend for the financial year
ending 30th June, 1950, has been maintained at the
rate of 12| per cent, per annum.
Earnings on shareholders’ funds in 1949 were equal
to 10.4 per cent., so that the availability of £2,260,000
of 4 per cent, funds, represented by the third preference
and debenture capital, is of particular value to ordinary
shareholders.
Management is progressive and highly experienced,
whilst due regard is paid to the education of younger
executives, thus assuring continuity of efficient manage-
ment over a long term of years.
Covering such a wide field of manufacture, the group
can be expected to continue to earn excellent profits.
The ordinary shares of the company are attractive on
the long-term view, giving an exceptional income yield
for a stock of this character at current prices, with
prospects of substantial benefits over a period. For
ten years from 1937 to 1946, inclusive, an ordinary
dividend of 10 per cent, per annum was paid regularly,
with a wide margin of earnings, whilst in 1947, 1948
and 1949 the rate was 12J per cent, per annum, earnings
on ordinary capital in those years being 23, 28.3 and
26.3 per cent, respectively.
For those clients who favour fixed interest stocks,
the company’s third preference shares are available in
the market at 17/9 to yield £4/9/4 per cent, on a
dividend of 4 per cent. Net tangible assets backing
for that issue at the last balance date was £4/13/1
per share, whilst the net profit was sufficient to cover
the debenture interest and the three preference divi-
dends combined 5.8 times. In other words, net profit
