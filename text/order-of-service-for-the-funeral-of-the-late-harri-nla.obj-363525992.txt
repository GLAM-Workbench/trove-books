QPrfor nf Semite
Thy kingdom come, O God,
Thy rule, O Christ, begin;
Break with Thine iron rod
The tyrannies of sin.
Where is Thy reign of peace,
And purity, and love?
When shall all hatred cease,
As in the realms above?
When comes the promised time
That war shall be no more,
And lust, oppression, crime
Shall flee Thy face before?
We pray Thee, Lord, arise.
And come in Thy great might.
Revive our longing eyes,
Which languish for Thy sight.
Men scorn Thy sacred name.
And wolves devour Thy fold;
By many deeds of shame
We learn that love grows cold
O’er heathen lands afar
Thick darkness broodeth yet:
Arise, O morning Star,
Arise, and never set. Amen.


palm CE3CX3I
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh
my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made
heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that
keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor
sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence
upon thy right hand;
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the
moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even
he that shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming
in: from this time forth for evermore.
•SjPßmUt— 1 Corinthians 15.

The day Thou gavest. Lord is ended,
The darkness falls at Thy behest;
To Thee our morning hymns ascended,
Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.
We thank Thee that Thy Church unsleeping,
While earth rolls onward into light,
Through all the world her watch is keeping,
And rests not now by day or night.


As o’er each continent and island
The dawn leads on another day,
The voice o£ prayer is never silent,
Nor dies the strain o£ praise away.
The sun, that bids us rest, is waking
Our brethren ’neath the western sky,
And hour by hour fresh lips are making
Thy wondrous doings heard on high.
So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,
Like earth’s proud empires, pass away
But stand, and rule, and grow for ever.
Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.

Now thank we all our God,
With heart and hands and voices,
Who wondrous things hath done,
In whom His world rejoices;
Who from our mother’s arms
Hath bless’d us on our way
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours to-day.
Oh may this bounteous God
Through all our life be near us,
With ever joyful hearts
And blessed peace to cheer us;
And keep us in His grace,
And guide us when perplex’d.
And free us from all ills
In this world and the next.
All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given,
The Son, and Holy Ghost,
Supreme in highest heaven,
The One Eternal God,
Whom earth and heaven adore
For thus it was, is now,
And shall be evermore. Amen.
