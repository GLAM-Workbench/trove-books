unto Him ; Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and before Thee, and am no more worthy to
be called Thy son. S. Luke, xv., 18, 19.
DEARLY beloved brethren. [*the Scripture Thu (*) may u
moveth us in sundry places to acknowledge omitted.
and confess our manifold sins and wickedness ; and
that we should not dissemble nor cloke them before
the face of Almighty God our Heavenly Father; but
confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and
obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain for-
giveness of the same, by Hi's infinite goodness and
mercy. And although we ought at all times humbly
to acknowledge our sins before God ; yet, ought we
most chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet
together to render thanks for the great benefits that
we have received at His hands, to set forth His
most worthy praise, to bear His most Holy Word,
and to ask those things which are requisite and
necessary, as well for the body as the soul. Where-
fore,] I pray and beseech you, as many as are here
present, to accompany me with a pure heart and
humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace,
saying after me ;

which we ought to have done ; And we have
done those things which we ought not to have
done: And there is no health in us. But
Thou, 0 Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable
offenders. Spare Thou them, O God, which
confess their faults. Restore I hou them that
are penitent : According to Thy promises
declared unto mankind in Christ Jesu our
Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father,
for His sake ; That we may hereafter live a
godly, righteous, and sober life ; To the glory
of Thy Holy Name. Amen
Then shall he used the following Prayer : but a
Priest may pronounce the Absolution instead
thereof:
OLOKD, we beseech Thee, mercifully hoar our
prayers, and spare all those who confess their
sins unto Thee ; that they, whose consciences by sin
are accused, by Thy merciful pardon may be absolved;
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty,
Maker of Heaven and earth :
And in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord,
Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born
of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius
Pilate ; Was crucified, dead, and buried, He
descended into hell : The third day He rose
again from the dead, He ascended into
Heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of God
the Father Almighty; Front thence He shall
come to judge the quick and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Gho-t ; The Holy
Catholick Church; The Communion of Saints;
The Forgiveness of sins; The Resurrection of
the body, And the life everlasting. Amen.

OGOD, from whom all holy desires, all good

unto Thy servants that peace which the world cannot
give; that both our hearts may be set to obey Thy
commandments, and also that by Thee we being
defended from the fear of our enemies may pass our
time in rest and quietness ; through the merits of
Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.
O ALMIGHTY Lord, and everlasting God, vouch-
safe, we beseech Thee, to direct, sanctify, and
govern, both our hearts and bodies, in the ways of
Thy laws, and in the works of Thy commandments ;
that through Thy most mighty protection, both here

through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.
ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who alone
workest great marvels ; Send down upon our
Bishops, and Curates, and all Congregations com-

grace ; and that they may truly please Thee, pour


upon them the continual dew of Thy blessing.

and Mediator, Jesus Christ. Amen.
OGOD, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind,
we humbly beseech Thee for all sorts and con-
ditions of men ; that Thou wouldesfbe pleased to
make Thy ways known unto them, Thy saving health
unto all nations. More especially, we pray for the
good estate, of the Catholick Church ; that it may be
so guided and governed by Thy good Spirit, that all
who profess and call themselves Christians may be
led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity
of Spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness
of life. Finally, we commend to Thy Fatherly good-
ness all those, who are any ways afflicted or
distressed, in mind, body, estate; [especially those
tor whom our prayers are desired,] that it may please
Thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their
several necessities, giving them patience under their
sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflic-
tions. And this we beg for Jesus Christ His sake.

beseech Thee, give us that due sense of all Thy
mercies, that our hearts may be unfeignedly thank-

MORNING.
NEW every morning is the love
Our wakening and uprising prove ;
Through sleep and darkness safely brought,
Restored to life, and power, and thought.
A. & M
New mercies, each returning day,
Hover around us while we pray ;
New perils past, new sins forgiven,
New thonghts of God, new hopes of heav’n.
If on our daily course our mind
Be set to hallow all we find,
New treasures still, of countless price,
God will provide for sacrifice.
The trivial round, the common task,
Will furnish all we need to ask,
Room to deny ourselves, a road
To bring us daily nearer God.
Only, 0 Lord, in Thy dear love
Fit us for perfect rest above ;
And help us, this and every day,
To live more nearly as we pray. Amen.


EVENING.
O UN of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if thou be near ;
0 may no earth-born cloud arise
To hide Thee from Thy servant’s eyes.
L. & M.
When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour’s breast.
Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live ;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.
If some poor wandering child of Thine
Have spurned to-day the voice Divine,
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin ;
Let him no more lie down in sin.
Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
With blessing from Thy boundless store :
Be every mourner’s sleep to-night,
Like infant’s slumbers, pure and light.
Come near and bless is when we wake,
Ere through the world our way we take;
Till in the ocean of Thy love
We lose ourselves in heav’n above. Amen.
Q \ BIDE with me ; fast falls the eventide ;
The darkness deepens; Lord with me
A. & M. abide ;
27 When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.


Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day,
Earth’s joys grow dim, it’s glories pass away ;
Change and decay in all around 1 see;
0 Thou, Who changest not, abide with me.
I need Thy presence every passing hour ;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s
power ?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide
with me.
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
Where is death’s sting ? Where, grave, thy
victory ?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes ;
Shine .through the gloom and point me to
the skies ;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain
shadows flee ;
In life, in death, 0 Lord, abide with me.
Amen,

And every voice a song.
He comes, the prisoners to release
In Satan’s bondage held ;
The gates of brass before Him burst,
The iron fetters yield.


p He comes, the broken heart to bind,
The bleeding soul to cure,
And-with the treasures of His grace
To bless the humble poor.

And HeavVs eternal arches ring
With Thy beloved Name. Amen.

EPIPHANY.
AS with gladness men of old
Did the guiding star behold,
As with joy they hail’d its light,
Leading onward, beaming bright ;
So, most gracious Lord, may we
Evermore be led to Thee.
A. & M
As with joyful steps they sped,
Saviour, to Thy lowly bed,
There to bend the knee before
Thee Whom Heav’n and earth adore ;
So may we with willing feet
Ever seek Thy mercy-seat.
As they offered gifts most rare
At Thy cradle rude and bare ;
So may we with holy joy,
Pure and free from sin’s alloy,
All our cost'iest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee our heavenly King.
Holy Jesus, every day
Keep us in the narrow way ;
And, when earthly things are past,


Bring our ransom'd souls at last
mf Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
f In the Heav’nly country bright
Need they no created light;
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
Thou its Sun which goes not down;
if There for ever may we sing
Alleluias to our King. Amen.
LENT AND PASSIONTIDE.
WHEN I survey the wondrous Cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but lost,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
A. & M
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the Cross of Christ, my God :
All the vain things that charm me most,
1 sacrifice them to His blood.
See from His Head, His Hands, His Feet
Sorrow and love flow mingling down ;
Did e’er sucb love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown ?
Where the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so Divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
To Christ, Who won for sinners grace,
By bitter grief and anguish sore,
Be praise from all the ransomed race,
For ever and for evermore. Amen.


Urn HERE is a green hill far away,
I Without a city wall,
A. & M. Where the dear Lord was crucified,
332 Who died to save us all.
We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear,
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffer’d thei’e.
He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to Heav’n,
Saved by His precious Blood.
There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin,
He only could unlock the gate
Of Heav’n, and let us in.
Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,
And we must love Him too,
And trust in His redeeming Blood,
And try His works to do. Amen.

ASCENSION AND WHITSUNTIDE.
p /~\ UR Blest Redeemer, ere He breathed
Vy His tender last farewell,
A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed
With us to dwell.
A. & M.
mf He came sweet influence to impart,
A gracious willing Guest,
While He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.
p And His that gentle voice we hear,
Soft as the breath of even,
That checks each fault, that calms each
And speaks of Heaven.
cr And every virtue we possess,
And every conquest won,
And every thought of holiness,
mf Are His alone.
Spirit of purity and grace,
Our weakness, pitying, see ;
0 make our hearts Thy dwelling-place,
And worthier Thee. Amen.


THE Church’s one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord ;
She is His new creation
A. & M.
215
By water and the Word ;
From Heaven He came and sought her
To be His Holy Bride.
With His own Blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.
Elect from every nation,
Yet one o’er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one Faith, one Birth ;
One Holy Name she blesses,
Partakes one Holy Food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.
Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore opprest,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distrest.
Yet Saints their watch are keeping,
Their cry goes up “ How long ? ”
And soon the night of,weeping
Shall be the morn of song.
’Mid toil, and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace for evermore ;
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest,


Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won :
0 happy ones and holy !
Lord give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee. Amen.
THE HOLY TRINITY.
■I q r QLY, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!
I | Early in the morning our song shall
A. & M. rise to thee :
160 Holy. Holy, Holy ! Merciful and Mighty !
God in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!
Holy, Holy, Holy ! all the Saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns around
the glassy sea:
Cherubim and Seraphim falling down before
Thee,
Which wert, and art. and evermore shalt be.
Holy, Holy, Holy ! though the darkness hide
Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory
may not see ;
Only Thou art Holy, there is none beside Thee
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.
Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy Name, in
earth, and sky, and sea ;
Holy, Holy, Holy ! Merciful and Mighty!
God in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!
Amen.


JESU, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy Bosom fly,
While the gathering waters roll,
While the tempest still is high :
Hide me, 0 my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
0 receive my soul at last.
A. & M,
Other refuge have I none ;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee ;
Leave, ah ! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me,
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.
Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cleanse from every sin ;
Let the healing streams abound ;
Make and keep me pure within ;
Thou of life the Fountain art;
Freely let me take of Thee ;■
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity. Amen.
HOW sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear !
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds.
A. & M
And drives away his fear.
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.


Dear Name ! the rock on which T build,
My shield and hiding-place,
My never-failing treasury filled
With boundless stores of grace.
Jesus, my Shepherd, Husband, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, and King,
My Lord, ray Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.
Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I’ll praise Thee as I ought.
Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath ;
And may the music of Thy Name
Refresh my soul in death. Amen.
ROCK of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee:
Let the Water and the Blood
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
A & M.
Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands ;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.


Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy Cross I cling ;
Naked, come to Thee for dress ;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace ;
Foul, I to the fountain fly ;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyelids close in death,
When I soar through tracts unknown,
See Thee on Thy Judgment Throne ;
Rock of ages,, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee. Amen.
no JESUS, I have promised
£ O To serve Thee to the end
A. & M. Be Thou for ever near me,
271 My Master and my Friend ;
I shall not fear the battle
If Thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway
If Thou wilt be my Guide.
0 let me feel Thee near me :
The world is ever near ;
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear :
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within ;
But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
And shield my soul from sin.
0 let me hear Thee speaking
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will;


0 speak to re-assure me,
To hasten or control;
0 speak and make me listen,
Thou Guardian of my soul.
0 Jesus, Thou hast promised
To all who follow Thee,
That where Thou art in glory
There shall Thy servant be ■
And, Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end.
0 give me grace to follow,
My Master and my Friend.
0 let me see Thy footmarks
And in them plant mine own ;
My hope to follow duty
Is in Thy strength alone ;
0 guide me, call me, draw me,
Uphold me to the end ;
And then in Heav’n receive me,
My Saviour and my Friend. Amen.
(\ A IV /TY God, my father, while I stray,
*1 * |V I Far from my home on life’s rough way,
A. A M. Oh teach me from my heart to say,
264 “ Thy Will be done.”
Though dark my path, and sad my lot,
Let me be still and murmur not,
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
“ Thy Will be done.”
What though in lonely grief I sigh
For friends beloved no longer nigh.
Submissive would I still reply,
“ Thy Will be done,”


If Thou shouldst call me to resign
What most 1 prize, it ne’er was mine ;
I only yield Thee what is Thine :
“ Thy Will be done.”
Let but my fainting heart be blest
With Thy sweet Spirit for its guest,
My God, to Thee I leave the rest:
“ Thy Will be done.”
Renew my will from day to day,
Blehd it with Thine, and take away
All that now makes it hard to say,
“ Thy Will be done.” Amen.
mf O ONB of Labour, dear to Jesus,
To your homes and work again ;
cr Go with brave hearts back to duty,
dim Face the peril, bear the pain.
p Be your dwellings ne’er so lowly,
cr Yet remember, by your bed,
mf That the Sou of God most Holy
dim Had not where to lay His head.
A. & M,
584
mf Sons of labour, think of Jesus
As you rest you homes within,
dim Think of that sweet Babe of Mary
In the stable of the Inn.
Think how in the sacred story
Jesus took a humble grade,
mf And the Lord of Life and Glory
dim Worked with Joseph at his trade.
mf Sons of Labour, pray to Jesus,
dim Oh, how Jesus prayed for you !
In the moonlight, on the mountain,
Where the shimmering olives grew.


cr When you rise up at the dawning,
Ere to toil you wend your way,
Pray, as He prayed, in the morning,
Long before the break of day.
mf Sons of Labour, be like Jesus,
Undefiled, chaste, and pure;
And, though Satan tempt you sorely,
By His grace you shall endure.
Husband, father, son, and brother, '
Be ye gentle, just, and true, —
Be ye kind to one another,
As the Lord is kind to you.
Sons of Labour, seek for Jesus,
Where He tells you ye shall find,
dim In the children, ’mid the mourners,
In the sick, poor, lame, and blind, —
“ Search the Scripture,” He entreats you,
“ For of Me they testify
Love His Altar, where He meets you,
Saying, “ Fear not—lt is I.”
mf Sons of Labour, go to Jesus,
dim In your sorrow, shame, and loss ;
He is nearest, you are dearest,
cr When you bravely hear His Cross.
Go to Him, Who died to save you,
And is still the sinner’s Friend;
And the great love, which forgave you,
dim Will forgive you to the end.
mf Sons ol Labour, live for Jesus,
Be your work your worship too ;
In His Name, and to His glory,
Do whate’er you find to do ;


Till this night of sin and sorrow
Be for ever overpast ;
And we see the golden morrow.
Home with Jesus ; home at last!
Amen.
THE day Thou gavrst, Lord, is ended’
The darkness falls at Thy behest;
To Thee our morning hymns ascended,
Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.

We thank Thee that Thy Church unsleep-
ing,
While earth rolls onward into light,
Through all the world her watch is keeping,
And rests not now by day or night.
As o’er each continent and island
The dawn leads on another day.
The voice of prayer is never silent.
Nor dies the strain of praise away.
The sun that bids us rest is waking
Our brethren ’neath the western sky,
And hour by hour fresh lips are making
Thy wondrous doings heard on high.
So be it, Lord; Thy Throne shall never,
Like earth’s proud empires, pass away;
Thy Kingdom stands, and grows for ever,
Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
Amen.

THE Son of God goes forth to war,
A Kingly crown to gain ;
His blood-red banner streams afar !

Who follows in His train ?


Who best can drink his cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain,
Who patient bears his cross below,
He follows in His train.

The Martyr first, whose eatrle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave;
Who saw his Master in the sky,
And call’d on Him to save.
Like Him, with pardon on his tongue
In midst of mortal pain,
1 le pray’d for them that did the wrong;
Who follows in His train ?
A glorious band, the chosen few
On whom the Spirit came,
Twelve valiant Saints, their hope they
knew,
And mock’d the cross and flame.
They ni' t the tyrant’s brandished steel,
The lion’s gory mane,
They bow’d their necks, the death to feel:
Who follows in their train ?
A noble army, men and boys,
The matron and the maid,
Around the Saviour’s Throne rejoice,
In robes of light array’d.
They climb'd the steep ascent of'Heav’n
Through peril, toil, and pain ;
O God, to us may grace be given
To follow in their train. Amen.
