THE FAIRY 3j||||
I MET a little fairy,
He wore a round green cap,
I stared at him, he stared at me,
My heart went tap, tap, tap !
He didn't seem afraid of me,
He didn't want to fly,
But neither of us liked to speak
For both were rather shy.
He wore a little coat of brown
Close buttoned to his chin,
And he had sharp and hairy ears,
A rough and knobby skin ;
His shoes were red and pointed,
His eyes were bright and blue,
And gazed, not only up and down,
But looked you through and through.
And then we spoke together —
A silly thing to do !
He said, " I beg your pardon,"
And I said, " Which are you ? "
He might have been a leprechaun,
A pixie or an elf;
I wanted so to hear him talk
And then to talk myself.


But with a sudden terror
As silently we stood
We heard a heavy footstep
That crackled through the wood.
And he was gone, nor could I tell
The way he went, until
I saw the waving fern-fronds
That moved, and then were still.


NOT A
CENTIPEDE
& I ..o'.'o"'' I
I'M very, very glad indeed
That I am not a centipede,
For think of walking in the street
Or garden with a hundred feet!
For how they would get in my way
Whenever I went out to play,
And oh, how cross my nurse would get
If all my hundred feet got wet!
Suppose, when I began to run,
That half my feet should stop, for fun,
While fifty more went rushing past—
What would become of me at last ?
And oh, what pain if some one chose
To tread on my five hundred toes !
Oh, yes, I'm sure I'm quite agreed
I would not be a centipede.

PRESENTS FOR
MOTHER
VO- • \T. :
I'M going to buy my mother
A great big railway train ;
We'll travel right across the earth
As far as Brisbane and as Perth,
And then come back again ;
She'll sit beside the window
And watch things whir and whizz,
But I will drive the engine hard
And be the stoker and the guard
And everything there is.
I'm going to buy my mother
A 'normous motor-car,
I'll buy the biggest I can find,
The very best and newest kind
Of all the kinds there are ;
I'll drive her to the circus
And I'll drive her to the Zoo,
I'll drive her into town for tea,
And everywhere she wants to be
That's where I'll drive her to.
I'm going to buy my mother
A splendid sailing ship ;
I'll be the captain in command,
And when we're tired of drives on land
We'll always go a trip ;


A schooner or a yacht,
But mother anyway will be
So glad she's got a boy like me
To buy her such a lot.

iR; MISS MINCHIN
MISS MINCHIN is a friend of ours ; we often go to tea,
She has a lot of interesting things we like to see ;
Of course there are no children there, and she is rather old,
But there is heaps and heaps to do and nobody to scold.
Miss Minchin has a garden that we'd like to have ourselves,
But what she says are terraces are really little shelves,
Little shelves of stone they are, where plants and creepers grow,
Heliotrope and rosemary and lilies in a row.
And crooked rocky steps go down where you can sit and talk—
There isn't room for many games, nor very far to walk,
But there are shady trees above and lots of birds to sing
And locusts in the summer-time that drum like anything !
Miss Minchin lets us pick the flowers and hunt for snails that crawl
Beneath the ivy and the vines along the wet stone wall;
And then there is a loquat-tree, but oh ! it's such a waste —
We're never there in loquat-time—we've never had a taste.
It's just as nice on rainy days ; we're never dull at all,
She shows us all the books and toys she had when she was small;
And all her dolls she kept, she says, for children of her own,
But now we play with them instead —the queerest dolls we've known


12 MISS MINCHIN
For moths have eaten off their hair, and they look half afraid,
And wear such strange, old-fashioned clothes, but beautifully made;
Miss Minchin tells us all their names and what they used to do,
Or else she tells us stories then, both fairy tales and true.
We always have hot buttered toast or tiny scones for tea,
And sometimes pink and white meringues, as sweet as sweet can be ;
Then if we like—(we always do) —we sit down on the floor
And all explore her cabinet when she's unlocked the door.
To look at curious things through glass she knows is never fun,
She lets us take them in our hands—we've never broken one ;
And when at last it's six o'clock —it comes so soon ! —I know
She's just as sad to say good-bye as we are sad to go.

1|||ir TICK TOCK
e5 i .o-i- I
" I MCK tock ! " said the clock,
A " Time to go to bed.
Half-past seven, Drowsy-eyes,
Good night, Nod-a-head !
Up you get and off you go
And fold your clothes up nicely,
Wash your hands and brush your hair
And kneel and say a sleepy prayer,
And you'll be tucked in bed, I know,
At ten to eight precisely.
Then what loveliness you'll find
Waiting for your coming,
Fairies merry, fairies kind,
Tiny nests of fairy birds
Singing songs with pretty words,
Meadows full of flowers and trees,
Gay-winged butterflies and bees
With their drowsy humming.
And the lucky child who comes
Finds —I tell you true —
A little house of sugarplums
With barley-sugar windowpanes,
(They melt a little when it rains) —
It may be all for you !
The roof is made of caramel,
The walls are gingerbread.
(Tick tock ! " said the clock,
" Time to go to bed.)


And there are joys I may not tell.
My little Nod-a-head,
If you go by bridge and stream
In that kingdom of a dream,
And watch the spraying waterfalls
And hear the naiads' silver calls,
And see the water-lilies he
Delicate and pale
In their secret pool of green,
Beautiful and shy.
But if we ask you where you've been
You cannot tell us all you've seen,
No matter how you try;
We never hear the wonder-tale
Of where your wanderings led,
For over all a gauzy veil,
A magic cloak is spread.
Tick tock ! " said the clock,
" Time to go to bed."

THE jSBg^
SPOON GAME
WHEN there are visitors to lunch
I mustn't talk that day,
And so I make the spoons and forks
A kind of game to play.
Of course I play it in my head,
But still it's rather fun ;
It is a sort of story-game
That lasts till lunch is done.
The tablespoons are grannies—yes,
And sometimes nurses, too,
They all wear bonnets large and high
Like grannies used to do.
The mothers are dessertspoons then,
You see how that would be,
And all the teaspoons little girls
About as big as me.
The saltspoons all are baby things
And they must always stay
Inside their cellar-cradles, 'cos
They're far too small to play.


The gravy-ladle drives about.
Much grander than the rest;
And all the forks are men, of course—
I like the ladies best.
But when the grannies all look stern,
The mothers rather sweet,
I often think how rude it is
To use them when I eat!


CHRISTMAS
''•.•■■.t:.-. O' ''o. ; ■■" o "**"
BETTY'S hung her stockings up
And one of Mother's, too ;
Baby's still so little
That his woolly sock will do ;
We've fastened them by Betty's bed
And over baby's cot;
Santa Claus will find the place—
But then there's such a little space ;
I'm going to hang a pillow-case
Because it holds a lot!
Betty wants such little things,
Necklaces and beads ;
A rattle and a rubber doll
Are all that baby needs ;
But I want heaps and heaps of things—
A top that I can spin,
An engine and a sailing-ship,
A bat, a ball, a drum, a whip—
I'm going to hang a pillow-slip
And hope they'll all get in !


I'M GOING TO HANG A PILLOW-SLIP




jjgggL COCK-CROW J§J§||.
AT NIGHT
® I &
I WAKE up sometimes in the night,
Oh, long before it's day;
The windows show no chink of light,
They are not even grey.
My heart beats loud —I wonder why—
Much louder than a clock ;
And then I hear a far-off cry—
The crowing of a cock.
It sounds quite loud enough to rouse
The sleepers everywhere,
But no one stirs in all the house ;
I lie and listen there.
It is the loneliest sound to make,
His strange and sudden crow;
We are the only two awake
In all the world, I know !

WHEN Dick was only one year old
He always did as he was told,
He never said a single word
That we would rather not have heard,
He never climbed forbidden trees
Or stole the honey from the bees.
When Dick was two he was so good
He never grumbled at his food,
And when Nurse called him never said
" I will not, will not go to bed ! "
But sleeping in his cot you'd see
How very good our Dick could be.
When Dick was three he used to play
As happy as a bird all day,
He never thought, like Peter Pan,
He would not learn to be a man,
He never ran away at all
But was as good as he was small.
And now that Dick is four years old
I'm certain he's as good as gold.

WE haven't a garden,
We never can go
To see how the pansies
And snapdragons grow,
To watch the buds opening
In sunshine and shower,
But we have a baby
Who's just like a flower.
Her hands curl like petals,
Her face is a rose,
No flower could be sweeter
Wherever it grows ;
She smells like a nosegay
That's plucked in the dew ;
No flower could be sweeter
Wherever it grew.
Next door there's a garden
All flowery and gay,
With arches and arbours
Where children might play ;
We haven't a rose-hedge,
A border or bower,
But we have a baby
Who's just like a flower.


THE DOLL

THERE'S no one that can dress a doll
As well as Mother can ;
Her scissors flash and clash and clip
And turn, and then go snip, snip, snip,
And what, when she began,
Was just a bit of scarlet stuff
Looks like a doll's dress, right enough.
And everything she makes, of course,
Will do up and undo,
With little buttonholes as wee
As ever buttonholes could be,
And hats and bonnets, too,
And tiny underclothes all sewn
And made exactly like my own.
And once she dressed the sweetest doll
That wasn't meant for me
But for a little girl she knows ;
Her dress had pale pink satin bows
And, just below the knee,
Three fluffy little frills of lace,
And oh ! it had a darling face.
We went to see the little girl,
(I didn't know her well;)
She took the doll and looked at it,
But oh, she didn't care a bit


IT WAS HARD TO LEAVE THAT DOLL




For dolls, and I could tell
That though she sort of tried to play
She wouldn't when we went away.
And it was hard to leave that doll,
So lonely and so shy,
For no one loved her, I'm afraid,
Or noticed how her clothes were made,
And when we said good-bye
She looked so sad and wistful-eyed,
And I—l very nearly cried.


THE TINY PUSSY
* e2>
was a tiny pussy, and she was very sad,
I Because she wanted wings like ihc little birdies had ;
And all day long and half the night she used to sit and mew,
" I wish that I could fly, Oh, I do ! I do ! I do ! "
And so, what do you think she did, this naughty pussy-cat ?
She stole the pretty feathers out of Mrs. Brown's new hut,
Anil fastened them upon her back, and then went purring," Miow !
You'll see me lly among the trees just like the birdies now."
She jumped upon the table and she started off to fly ;
I Icr wings fell oil', and she fell down, and she began to cry.
But till her little sisters said, " We wouldn't pity her ;
She's only hurl her silly self, and dirtied all Iter fur."


CHILDREN
| 'o.'*o. I(&
Wo -vv- ,• '"o-..•;-•>•'•"" o *"•'
WHAT do fairy children
Have to eat ?
Honey from the scented blossoms
Wonderfully fresh and sweet,
Wee ants' eggs, and lily-pollen
Taste deliciously to them,
And they drink the milky juices
From the thistle's stem.
What do fairy children
Have to wear ?
Dresses made of flower-petals,
Silky-soft and light as air,
And the hummingbird's bright feathers,
Grass-blade ribbons, cobweb lace,
And a violet for a bonnet
Frames a fairy face.
Where do fairy children
Have to play ?
In and out among the flowers,
Darting through the fountain's spray ;
They come sliding down a rainbow,
They go sailing on a cloud —
Everywhere they wish they fly to,
Everywhere's allowed !


FAIRY CHILDREN
Where do fairy children
Go to sleep ?
In the hollyhocks and roses
They may slumber, safe and deep ;
Under mushrooms, in a nutshell
With a roseleaf counterpane
They may sleep until the morning
Wakes them up again.

GRASS FAIRIES
&
9 z::'~4y ••-•' "
THE clouds have all gone and it's beautif ly fine—
I think the sun heard when I asked him to shine.
(Bob says he didn't—he's too far away,
And never would hear if I shouted all day.)
The grass is so green and the sky is bright blue,
And the mowing machine is all shiny and new.
It's lovely to watch how our gardener goes,
All over the lawn and the borders he mows ;
And as the machine goes on chopping and chopping
The grass keeps on skipping and dancing and hopping
They are little green fairies, and Oh ! can't you see
How they're jumping and skipping, as gay as can be !
(Bob says that's stupid, and he says that it's
Only the grass getting cut into bits.)
How would he feel when he's dancing away
If somebody said he was nothing but hay ?
I hope the poor fairies can't hear him, don't you ?
It might hurt their feelings, and that wouldn't do.


THE LIGHTHOUSE
6 o. —o- a. " or
GRANNIE has kissed me and heard my prayers,
Smoothed all the bed-clothes cosy and right,
And now she has gone away far downstairs,
Taken the candle and shut the door tight.
The wind is howling and growling about,
The waves are quarrelling, cross as can be,
But the lighthouse stands on the rocks far out,
It shines on the waves and it shines on me.
What would the poor little fishing-boats do ?
How would they know the right path to take ?
How could the ships sail straight and true,
S'posing the lighthouse wasn't awake ?
I'd be afraid of the lonely night,
I'd be afraid of the cold and the storm,
'Cept for the friendly lighthouse's light—
Somehow it makes me happy and warm.
No one would hear me if I should call
(How the sea scolds on the beach below !)
No one's awake in the world at all—
Grannie and Nurse are asleep, I know.


Down by the fire, like they always do,
Grannie and Grandfather doze and nod ;
But the lighthouse watches the whole night through,
And it seems to me like the Eye of God.

O DON'T you think
Down in the ink
Little black gnomes live, or some kind of elf ?
Ready to crawl
Up, and to fall
Down on the letter you write by yourself.
Pixies and gnomes —
They have their homes
Deep in ink-bottles —they get in a rage—
Cling to your pen—
Up they come, then
Fall on your letter and spoil the whole page !
That's not a blot!
Look what it's got —
Fingers and legs and a little sharp nose,
Wrinkling with spite—
And I must write
All my long letter again, I suppose.
O, it's too bad !
Mother and Dad
Never are troubled at all, so they say.
If they don't mind
Some day they'll find
I've smashed the ink-pot and thrown them away !

HOITY-TOITY ! Hop-o'-my-thumb !
Tweedledee and Tweedledum !
All hobgoblins come to me,
Over the mountains, over the sea ;
Come in a hurry, come in a crowd,
Flying, chattering, shrieking loud ;
I and my broomstick fidget and call —
Come, hobgoblins, we want you all!
" I have a pot of a mischievous brew ;
You must do what I tell you to :
Blow through the keyholes, hang to the eaves,
Litter the garden with dead brown leaves ;
Into the houses hustle and run,
Here is mischief and here is fun !
Break the china and slam the doors,
Crack the windows and scratch the floors,
Let in the cockroaches, mice and rats,
Sit on the family's Sunday hats ;
Hiding and stealing everything little,
Smashing everything thin and brittle ;
Teasing the children, tickling their heels —
Look at them jumping ! Hark to their squeals !
Pinch their elbows and pull their hair,
Then out again to the gusty air !
" Flutter the birds in their sheltered nests,
Pluck the down from the ducklings' breasts,
Steal the eggs from the clucking hen,
Ride the pigs round and round the pen !


Here is mischief to spare for all—
Hoity-toity, come at my call!
Tweedledum and Tweedledee,
Come at my summons—come to me ! "
Thus sang a witch on a windy night,
Then sailed on her broomstick out of sight.

AR.V CHAIRS for grandpapas ; baby has a pram ;
The tramguard and the driver too have to have a tram ;
Boys with telegrams come riding bicycles, of course ;
Jockeys, soldiers—lots of men—ride upon a horse ;
Sailors go in boats and ships all across the sea—
But I like the swinging bough of our apple-tree.
Some people drive in motors; lots of them in trains ;
Even mother has a taxi sometimes when it rains ;
A little cripple girl I know has crutches made of wood ;
Fairies chase on butterflies—mother said they could ;
Elephants they ride in India, splendid as can be—

WHEN I was ill for weeks in bed
And mother had to rest.
The game I often used to play.
The one I liked the best,
Was making stories in my mind
About the tassels on the blind.
Round little heads those tassels had
And most of them were fat,
Like people walking in a row,
Some this way and some that,
With fluffy dresses sticking out,
Where the wind caught their skirts, no doubt
And one or two would stop and talk
While others walked so fast
They hadn't time for gossiping,
And some would saunter past —
All stiff and trim and prim they went,
And some were old and hunched and bent.
Then Nurse would come and light the gas
And pull the blind down low ;
I couldn't see what happened then
The whole way down the row,
But in the morning I would find
New tassel-people on the blind.

Without so much as one dead mouse."
They stretched their claws and off they went
On frolic and adventure bent
To where the garden pathways pass
By beds of flowers and trees and grass.
The kittens with a joyful squeak
Began to play at hide and seek,
All in and out among the stocks
And round the tall pink hollyhocks.
They chased a yellow butterfly
That floated on, now low, now high,
But never let their claws take hold
Upon its wings of softest gold.
They chased a willy wagtail, too,
He hopped away, and then he flew,
And from the tallest sunflower stem
He simply sat and laughed at them.


" The horrid bird ! " said Kitty Grey,
" Why should he want to fly away ? "
" I hope he'll fall," said Kitty White,
" And break his wing—and serve him right ! "
Then off they went without delay
To find some other game to play;
They teased a frog; they caught a snail;
They tried to bite a lizard's tail.
They found a beetle upside down,
A beetle in a golden gown ;
It waved its legs as if in pain—
They turned it right side up again.
Then tired at last of all their play,
" I'm going home," said Kitty Grey;
" I think it's tea-time, too." " All right !
We did have fun," said Kitty White.

J Who vras the most tremendous joker.
He used to make the bcDc't laogb
Until they nearly spirt in half.
And at for those tame merry bellows,
They were such comic l:~tle fellows,
Although one never could make out
The jokes they wheezed and choked dmt.
And then besides there were the tongs
Who used to smg such funny song*
That ah hoe fre-irono in hoe grate
Were in a quite hilarious state.
The hearhmg 'nought toe wa.s a wit-
And the felt rather out of it;
The others only jeered at that
And said her jokes v.ere ah"ays flat
But what with all the fan they had —
The poker's jetting*, rather mad,
The tongs' and bellows' lively ways—
They spent hoe mo*t delightful days.

TOPSY TURVY was an elf,
Very well pleased he was with himself;
He owned a house that was once a snail's,
He lived on pollen and tadpoles' tails.
A dear little lady bird, Nancy Nell,
Did his cooking and did it well;
A fine bronze lizard named Tour-de-Force
Topsy Turvy used as a horse.
And Topsy Turvy would often say,
Mounting his lizard and riding away,
" Richer or poorer, or rain or shine.
There's nobody's life is better than mine "

WHEN summer-time comes round again
They open wide the box
Where through the rainy winter days
They kept my summer frocks.
Then Mother comes and stands with Nurse
(And sometimes Nurse alone)
And tries them on me, one by one,
To see how much I've grown.
The muslin ones I wear for best;
The red and blue and pink
That do for lessons and for play—
I like them most, I think.
They feel so nice and cool and thin,
But oh ! so small and tight!
The skirts are always far too short,
The sleeves are never right.
And Nurse says, " This will never meet! "
Or " Here's a piece of luck !
We'll make it do for mornings, mum ;
You see there is a tuck."
And mother says, " Your sister, Nurse,
Perhaps would like those two."
(Oh dear ! I loved that stripy one
With little dots of blue.)


MY SUMMER FROCKS
And then I dip again and find
A frock I hardly know,
A pretty one with little sprigs
And rosebuds in a row ;
But as they do the buttons up
It all comes back so plain —
The party that we couldn't have
Because of all the rain.
And so my new, forgotten dress
Was sadly put away,
And Nurse said, " You're too big to cry ! "
It was a horrid day !
And here's the starchy, scrapy one
That I could never bear ;
The ugly one with little checks
I always tried to tear !
The spotty one—and that's the last;
I shut the empty box.
I do so like the day they choose
To try my summer frocks.

HI GARDEN HOSE

PLAYING with the garden hose
I love the squishy way it goes ;
First of all, it hangs its head,
Flabby—just like something dead ;
Then I turn the tap, and see !
It's as lively as can be,
Spurting water fast and far
Where the thirsty blossoms are.
How it wriggles in my hands !
Don't you think it understands
It must hurry up, and let
All the leaves get dripping wet,
All the drooping flower-heads
And the hot, dry garden-beds ?
It's no end of fun to play
Like I did the other day ;
I'm a brave and trusty knight,
Always ready for a fight,
And the hose is splendid then
As a serpent in his den ;
But I rout him out, and he
Makes a fierce attack on me.
Very desp'rately we fought
All across the tennis court !
Oh, it was a dreadful slaughter !
Blood was flowing just like water ;


But he never cared a rap
Till at last I reached the tap —
Turned it off, and with a moan
And a kind of gurgling groan,
Down he sank, completely slain,
And he never stirred again !

THE mermaids live beneath the waves,
Their houses are such lovely caves,
White shining sand is on the floors
And seaweed curtains at the doors,
All edged with shells —
So Mother tells.
Their chairs and tables too, I think,
Are all of coral, red and pink
And white—much prettier to see
Than ever wooden ones could be.
I'd like to stay
Down there some day.
The mermaids love their darling homes,
But often take their golden combs
And, swimming through the breakers green,
At midnight on the rocks they're seen ;
They sit out there
And comb their hair.
I'd like to dive and see them go,
Their bright tails waving to and fro,
And hear them sing, and then we'd talk
Of how it feels to run and walk;
I think they'd be
Quite kind to me.

ALL in the dark night-time
The winda blew about;
I crept to the window
And I looked OUT.
The wind; tossed the branches
Against the bright sky,
The tall yellow atari ahone
Far-off and high.
Among the dark branches
They'd clamber and hop,
And one I saw -.Land on
A chimney-top.
Then swift round the corner
The waiting wind*; "-.wept,
And straight down the chimney
My '•.tar had leapt !

And shoring balls and coloured things,
And all 'he wide green branches spread
With presents tied on tight with strings—

All sorts of toys, some low, some high,—
J feh him squeeze my hand up tight
And g; ve a funny sort of sigh.
And -hen when mother went at last
To cu* the presents doom, he cried
" Don't spoil the Ttee!" and held her fast,
And wouldn't listen when she 'ried
To tell hjrn what his presents were,
But pulled the scissors from her hand ;
" Don't spoil it ' —don't " " he cried to her,
Became he couldn't understand
line lovely toys and lights and ail
Weren't really growing on 'he Tree,


But ran away upstairs and hid
And cried for half an hour, he did.

AT GRANNIE'S
on,£§hjp>
I MUST wear my buckle shoes
And mustn't kick my feet
When we go to Grannie's house
Sometimes, for a treat.
Baby wears her 'broidered dress
And her frilly hood ;
When we go to Grannie's house
We must both be good.
We must kiss her carefully,
Never be too rough,
Never speak too loud to her
And yet speak loud enough.
We must only play with things
That she lets us touch ;
Never be too shy to talk
And yet not talk too much.
We have tea at Grannie's house,
(But it's milk, you know,)
Out of cups that Mother used
Years and years ago.
(Baby dropped a saucer once,
But it didn't break ;)
We must never spill the crumbs
When we're eating cake.

WHEN WE GO TO GRANNIE'S HOUSE




THE
CUBBYtfIOUSE

WE made a lovely cubby-house
With bits of board and sticks and boughs ;
We made a little window too
That you could really see things through.
We had a curtain for a door —
The hearthrug from the nursery floor ;
We tied it up with nails and string,
And Nurse was cross as anything !
And then we rolled the woodblock in—
It bumped my toes and Peter's shin ;
The pastry-board made such a flat
Nice little table out of that.
The guinea-pig's old wooden hutch
(It isn't broken very much)
We made a cupboard of, to hold
Our cakes and fruit—and Nurse did scold.
We played at Arthur's Knights, and then
At Robin Hood and all his men ;
We had the nicest kind of plays
And feasts there all the holidays.
But when at last the boys went back
To school, and I was left with Jack
Who's just a baby thing of four,
I didn't play there any more.

N r URSIE said I mustn't draw
Pictures on the wall,
But I think, behind the door
If I drew them small
Scarcely anyone would see —
Don't you think I may
Just some soldiers, two or three,
Marching quick away,
And a piggy with a snout,
And some pussy-cats,
And some ladies gomg out
In most boo'ful hats.
See, the pencil's thick and black —
Don't you think I may ?
Oh, here's Nursie coining back !
What will Nursie say ?
