JUBILEE RECORD OF CONGREGA-
TIONALISM IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA,
1837-1887.
From the S.A. Register.
Under the auspices of the Congregational
body Messrs. Webb, Vardon, and Pritchard
have issued a neat little volume, described on
the title-page as a "Jubilee Record 1837-1887,
the Congregational Churches of South Aus-
tralia." Its appearance is seasonable, and
it may rely upon a cordial welcome,
not only from the members of the denomina-
tion whose local history it chronicles, but also
from many belonging to other bodies who
have a sympathy with Congregationalism,
and appreciate the part it has played
in the religious and politicsd annals of
the time, The work of compiling the volume
J has devolved the Rev, F. W. Cox
—a gentleman holding an honoured place in
the community as an uncompromising up-
holder of the principles of religious
and whose long and intimate association with
Congregationalism in South Australia renders
him singularly well qualified for the office of
chronicler for the denomination. In penning
the jubilee record he has made no attempt at
brilliant writing. The story he has to tell
is told in a plain unvarnished way.
It is only now and then that he adds to the
role of the historian that of the critic, and
still more rarely does he encroach upon con-
troversial ground. Some few of his remarks
may be regarded as open to challenge,
and here and there are symptoms of sectarian
prejudice, but whatever failings of this sort
there are in the book are the offspring of the
author's intense admiration for the principles
of Independency. The book unquestionably
presents a striking picture of the early
struggles of the denomination to obtain a
footing in the colony, and it also bears
emphatic testimony to the prominent part
taken by it in the contest which
resulted in the severance of the Church from
the State in South Australia. The first
chapter is devoted to a brief sketch of the
establishment of the province ; the second to
the principles of Congregationalism ; the
third to the formation of the first Church under
the pastorate of the Rev. T. Q. Stow, its
subsequent development into the organiza-
tion meeting in Stow Memorial Church, and
the gradual upgrowth of other Churches be-
longing to the denomination. In the fourth
chapter, among other general observations, it
is noted that during the last fifty years
ninety-eight men entitled to call themselves
Congregational ministers have been asso-
ciated with the body. The fifth chapter
deals with a number of controversies, most
of them of a semi-political character,
in which Congregationalists have been
engaged, prominent amongst them being the
State Church controversy, the ever-memor-
able discussion between the Rev. Thomas
Jtfinney and the late Dr. Short, Bishop of
Adelaide, and the contests respecting the
Adelaide Cemetery, the Cathedral acre, the
Bishop's Letters Patent, the Marriage Act of
1867, and Precedency. The remainder of the
book is compressed into two chapters, the
one giving a complete historical account
of the Church and members of the
Congregational body, the other furnishing
particulars of the societies connected with it.
Altogether little volume will prove a
valuable handbook of the denomination, and
will prove of great service to the future his-
torian of South Australia.

PREFACE.
In the year 1883 an Intercolonial Conference of Delegates from the
Congregational Churches was held in Sydney. It was then arranged that
the next Conference should be held in Adelaide in the year 1887, which
is at once the Jubilee year of the Colony and the fiftieth year from the
founding of the first Congregational Church in South Australia. This
event was looked forward to with much interest, and a strong desire was
expressed that an effort should be made to secure the presence of one or
more delegates from England. When Mr. Richard Searle was in England he
obtained a promise from Dr. R. W. Dale, of Birmingham, and Mr. Albert
Spicer, of London, to visit Australia on the occasion of this Jubilee Conference.
The three colonies on the mainland agreed to share in the expense of Dr.
Dale's visit. Mr. Spicer generously offered to come at his own cost. The
Conference, of which we give an account in this volume, was a great
success. It was attended by Delegates from Victoria, New South Wales,
Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. A full list
of our visitors will be found in these pages. In addition to this volume,
containing an abstract of the proceedings, the Committee has published a
History of Congregationalism in South Australia, which has been written by
the Rev. F. W. Cox, a book which contains the only reliable record of the
religious struggles of the early years of the existence of this province. A
large photograph of the members of the Jubilee Conference was taken success-
fully, and copies may be obtained by those friends who wish to preserve
a permanent and visible memorial of this memorable occasion.
We have to crave the indulgence of the Authors of several of the
papers and also of our readers for any typographical errors that may
appear. The desire to issue this report with the least possible delay after


the conclusion of the meetings was so strong, and the residences of the
writers of the papers were so distant, that it was found impossible in
every case to send out proofs and wait for the Author's corrections. Even
the corrected proofs were, in some instances, not returned till after we had
gone to press. In spite of a few blemishes which we could not avoid,
we hope and trust that the report will be gladly welcomed by the
members of our Churches and by all who wish to have a permanent
record of the sermons and speeches which were delivered on this interesting
occasion. Our regret is great that we have not been able to include all
the Jubilee sermons and all the papers read at the Conference.

South Australian Congregational Jubilee.
INTRODUCTORY.
The Kev. Thomas Quinton Stow, the pioneer minister of our Churches, arrived from
England in the ship " Hartley" in the month of October, 1837. The first public services
were held in the November following, and on the 13th day of December the first fellow-
ship was formed in the little chapel of reeds and canvas that was built on Acre No. 5
North Terrace. The 50th anniversary of these events occurred this year, and was celebrated
by holding Special Thanksgiving Services in all our Churches, and by an Intercolonial
Conference. Dr. It. W. Dale, of Birmingham, kindly accepted the invitation of the
Committee to be present. He was accompanied by Albert Spicer, Esq., J.P., of London,
and they arrived in Adelaide on Thursday, September 1. To celebrate the Jubilee of this
- interesting event the Executive Committee invited the Unions of all the other Australasian
Colonies to send delegates to an Intercolonial Conference. The invitation was warmly
responded to, and over 50 of these representatives assembled with the members for South
Australia in a series of meetings held in Adelaide during the month of September.

THE PROGRAMME.
The arrangement of the business received much careful consideration. The Committee
experienced considerable difficulty in compressing into the time at their disposal the con-
sideration even of the questions of immediate and urgent interest which they felt justified
in asking the Delegates to discuss. Several important papers had to be left over till the
Conference to be held next year in Melbourne, and the fact that the colony was celebrating
its own Jubilee by holding a most attractive Exhibition, while it served to attract a large
number of strangers to the capital, also interfered with the close attention which most of
the Delegates were anxious to give to our meetings. In spite, however, of all these
counter-attractions our meetings were well attended by enthusiastic audiences, and the
success of our efforts to reduce the debts on our Churches has been such as to cheer the
hearts of all engaged in this good work. After much correspondence and numerous
alterations the following programme was carried out :

REPORT OP PROCEEDINGS
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1.
SUNDAY-SCHOOLS' DEMONSTRATION.
All will regret the disappointment which
the children had to bear who went to the Old
Raceconrse on Sept. 1 to celebrate the J übilee
of Congregationalism in the colony. As in
other Anglo-Saxon communities, the adults
of South Australia are always anxious to
promote the enjoyment of the juveniles, and
enter heartily into any schemes for that
object. A desire is apparent in all branches
of the community to identify the children's
pleasures with special occasions which awake
emotions of pride in the minds of their
parents and instructors.
The Congregationalists did well to place
the demonstration of Sunday-schools in the
foremost place on their programme of pro-
ceedings in connection with the jubilee of the
denomination, The procession of about 3,000
children which marched from Flinders-street
to the Old Racecourse on Thursday morning
was a striking evidence of the present (and
probably future) strength of the denomina-
tion, as also the earnestness with which the
Sunday-school movement is ibeing carried on
in the .colony.
Arrangements for the demonstration were
the result of considerable labour and careful
attention to detail on the part of a numerous
committee of Superintendents and teachers
from the various schools. It was decided that
the procession should.start from outside the
Stow Memorial Church at 10.30, and a few
minutes' previously the schools were in their
places, lining both sides of Flinders-street
and'the eastern portion of Victoria-square for
some distance. The crowd of onlookers could
be numbered by thousands, and many were
the expressions of surprise at the imposing
display made by|the schools and the excel-
lent order which prevailed. Several mounted
troopers and foot constables rendered useful
service in keeping the roadways clear. Every
consideration was shown the smaller children,
and the happy couptenances of all indicated
no suspicion that their hope of a joyous out-
ing was so soon to be dissipated by the re-
lentless rains and thunderstorm which swept
over the city a few hours later. The
children were formed up Tour abreast. The
youngest children were placed foremost, then
came the girls, and the boys brought up the
rear. It was noticeable that the elder
scholars—the young women in particular—
came out in large numbers. The youths'
classes were not so well represented. Several
very elegant banners were carried, besides a
host of bannerets] bearing Scriptural quota-
tions and mottoes. Led by the Hindmarsh
Brass Band the procession passed from
Flinders street to Wakefield-street, and
thence straight to the scene of the festivi-
ties. At the eastern end of Wakefield-road
two or three other schools joined the proces-
sion, which was probably a third of a mile long,
and included the following schools: —Stow,
450; Hindmarsh, including Henley Beach,
260 ; Port Adelaide, 50 ; Happy Valley, 35;
Macclesfield, 30 ; Glenelg, 170; Clayton, 200;
Hindmarsh-square, 100 ; Kapunda, 100;
Gawler, 100 ; North Adelaide, 300; Houghton,
120; College Park, 150; Mount Lofty, 60;
Medindie, 150 ; Rose Park, 170; and Kil-
kenny, 70. The Flinders-street and Hind-
marsh Model Schools Fife-and-drum Bands
played at intervals during the march.
The children entered the park by the gate-
way east of the avenue, and immediately
proceeded to the enclosure opposite the Grand
Stand, where the different schools took up
the positions allotted to them. Directly the
signal to disperse was given the children
scattered in all directions. The boys pre-
pared for football, cricket, and other such
games, whilst the younger girls resorted to
skipping ropes for entertainment, the older
ones being content to promenade in parties
and observe the frolics of their juniors,
who were bent on making the best
use of their time. The sight was very
interesting from many points of view, but
the air was rather chilly for those who were
merely spectators. Two or three races were
engaged in by the young people, but the
programme could not be carried out on
account of the bad weather. Dark clouds
had been hovering round all the morning,
and about half-past 12 o'clock they burst
with serious effect upon the holiday-keepers.
Rain fell in torrents, accompanied by thunder
and lightning, and there was naturally a
general stampede for places of shelter.
Every available inch of covering was occupied.
Both of the Grand Stands were quickly filled,
but the protection thus obtained was com-
paratively meagre, as the strong wind which
was blowing carried the rain into the build-
ings. This state of things lasted for some
time, and all hope of further enjoyment was
ended. The ground was thoroughly soaked,
and in places under water, so that the sports
and games had to be abandoned. An im-
promptu committee meeting was held to dis-
cuss the situation, and it was wisely resolved
that the gathering should be brought to an
early conclusion, as it was impossible to carry
out the arrangements which had been
made, Numbers of the children were
in the unpleasant position of being
wet almost to the skin, and it
was considered injudicious to keep them
there longer under the circumstances, espe-
cially as they could not have found a dry
corner to play in. Accordingly several of
the Superintendents mustered their scholars
and conducted them off the ground. The
weather calmed a little between 1 and 2


o'clock, and in spite of the still threatening
appearance of the sky most of the remaining
children were called to the new Grand Stand
at 2.15, where the band had taken up a
position, and there they sang five
verses of a jubilee hymn composed by
"J. McE.," and set to the music of the
National Anthem, and "The Old Hundredth,"
after eatables had been served out to them.
Light showers fell at intervals up to 3
o'clock, by which time the grounds were
almost deserted. About luncheon time Dr.
Dale arrived, and was heartily received, but
he stayed only for a little while. Mr. A.
Spicer, his colleague, and His Worship the
Mayor (Mr. E. T. Smith) also visited
the course during the afternoon. So far as
enthusiasm was concerned the demonstration
was a complete success. It was intended
that 2,0C0 of the children should render
several hymns in the Stand after dinner, and
that the Rev, W. R. Fletcher, Chairman of the
Jubilee Committee, should address them,
but of course these features had to be omitted.
The boys especially were much chagrined at
the abrupt termination of the picnic, as the
bulk of the sports were to have been contested
during the afternoon; but they will still have a
chance of gaining distinction as athletes, as
the committee have decided to call them
together some Saturday afternoon shortly for
the purpose of having the whole programme
of sports carried out. Refreshments
were plentiful, and much credit is due to
Messrs. C. J. Holder and J. Vardon, the
masters of ceremonies, and their assistants,
Messrs. E. H. Lock, H. Savage, J. F.
Scrymgour, and others, for the admirable way
in which the business part of the celebration
was performed in face of the unfavourable
weather.
SUNDAY SERVICES—SEMEMBHB 4.

day were carried out most creditably, and

evergreens, and other devices.
OPENING THE CONFERENCE.
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.
Early in the forenoon a devoticnal meeting
was held in the Stow Lecture Ball, and was
followed by an introduction of ministers,
country delegates, and friends. Short
speeches were made by Dr. Dale and Mr.
Albert Spicer (delegates from the Congrega-
tional Union of England and Wales), the
Revs. Dr. Bevan and F. W. Brown, from
Victoria; the Rev. James Hill, from New
South Wales; Mr. G. Wight, from Queens-
land; the Rev. J. Johnston, from Western
Australia; Mr. H. J. Le Bailey, from New
Zealand; and the Revs. G. Ciarke and G.
W. Sharp, from Tasmania; and also by the
Rev. J. Bickford on behalf of the Wesleyan
Church in South Australia.
At 1.30 p.m. luncheon was partaken of in
the Town Hall Banqueting-room. The Chair-
man of the Conference (the Rev. W. R.
Fletcher, M.A.) presided, and was supported
by Dr. Dale, Mr. A. Spicer, the Revs. Dr.
Bevan, Dr. Jefferis, C. Manthrrpe, S. Heb-
ditch, Dr. Paton, (Presbyterian), Archdeacon
Farr (Anglican Church), and J. Y. Simpson
(President of the Wesleyan Conference). The
company numbered over 100 ladies and
gentlemen, including several ministers of
different denominations.
The CHAIRMAN said that as this was the
first gathering of a social character in con-
nection with the Conference, their first duty
as loyal subjects of the Queen meeting in this
jubilee year of her accession was to express
the feeling of loyalty which they all shared,
and be therefore submitted as the first senti-
ment "Her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen."
The sentiment was honoured by the com-
pany rising and singing the National Anthem.
The CHAIRMAN gave as the next sentiment
"Our Visitors." They had gathered there
under most interesting circumstances, and
were delighted to see amongst them so many
friends from all parts of the world, all
earnest and hearty workers in the cause of
their common Master. He knew that the
sentiment would be warmly received. (Loud
applause.)
The Rev, G. G. HOWDEN (Kew) said he
wondered what spirit of mischief had entered
the heads of the members of the committee
when they put his name down for an after


dinner speech. He had never made one in ;
his life, and was surprised to find himself
in the very novel position he was forced into
now. It would appear from the programme
that he was expected to respond on behalf
of both Victoria and New South Wales.
Such a large district made the
duty all the more onerous. Let _ him
express the deep sympathy of those friends
living in the eastern colonies for the
Congregationalists living in South Aus-
tralia on account of the great tide
of depression which had passed over
them. (Hear, hear.) They had thought
of them and prayed for them, and were glad
to know that brighter times were coming,
and they were now filled with hope. (Ap-
plause.) He noticed that in all the ex-
pressions used about the colony having
turned the corner and days of prosperity
coming, they always spoke of "temporal
prosperity." It was the custom when we
passed through times of affliction to look for
spiritual fruit, and he had been struck with
the remarks he had heard about
recent times being periods of suffering,
and the remark that men had learned to
trust the balance in the Bank less and to
trust God more. (Hear, hear.) He hoped
there would be not only temporal but
spiritual prosperity. Whatever came the
friends in the other colonies would rejoice
with them in their joy as they had sympa-
thized with them in their sorrow. (Ap-
plause.) They were thankful to God for the
visitors who had come out from the old
country, representing so clearly and so fully
the good old Gospel. (Applause.) Reports
came of men who seem to be tired of the old
Gospel and who were preaching a gospel
according to Tennyson or a gospel
according to Browning, but they rejoiced
to know that the brethren who had come out
to visit them from England were faithful
exponents of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
(Applause.) He recognised the warm hospi-
tality of friends in Adelaide. The only
trouble was that visitors could not live in
two houses at once. (Laughter.) They
wished to promote a spirit of true fellow-
ship. Twenty-six years ago, when he arrived
in Australia, the prevailing impression was
that we were a group of comparatively small
colonies at an immense distance from the
old country, and that there were not
many people in England who cared for
us. The communication between the
colonies and England in those days
was carried on only by sailing vessels,
and was of a very uncertain nature, the
voyages lasting from 90 to 100 days. Now we
had the telegraph and the quick-running and
regular steamers, and we often heard the ex-
pression that we had the beginnings of a
great nation. From Mr. Justin McCarthy's
description of England at the time of
George I.—not so very long ago—it appeared
that London was then no bigger than Mel-
bourne and Sydney put together would be
now ; that the population of England and
Wales was only twice that of these
colonies now; that such a city as Liver-
pool had scarcely any existence; that
the leading provincial towns of Eng-
land numbered only 30,000 or 40,000
inhabitants; and that Birmingham was
no bigger than Adelaide was now, apart from
the suburbs. In spite of terrible wars, waves
of pestilence passing over the country, and
the perpetual exodus of people to the United
States, the colonies, and India, the popula-
tion and trade of England had grown to its
present enormous dimensions. Now in Aus-
tralia we had no exodus —we had an influx;
we had no pestilence; this was a beautiful
climate; and there was therefore every
reason to believe that our grandchildren
might see Australia a great and wonderful
nation in the Southern Hemisphere. (Hear,
hear.) This fact had a bearing upon their
Conference. They had a great trust. Let
them fearlessly and earnestly hold forth the
word of truth and do their part in establish-
ing Christian institutions that would grow
with the growth of this country. He hoped
the Conference would be as profitable as that
held in Sydney four years ago. (Applause.)
The Rev. J. JOHNSTON said he came from
the distant colony of Western Australia.
Although it was a part of this great conti-
nent he supposed that 1,200 miles divided the
inhabited portion of the colony from the
nearest inhabited part of South Australia.
He had taken a voyage to Adelaide, which
was indeed a beautiful city. When he stood
near the Post-Office and looked down King
William-street he thought the time was
coming when it would be as beautiful a
street as could be found in the Southern
Hemisphere. In Western Australia they
had the beautiful little City of Perth,
with good distances between the houses.
(Laughter.) It was delightfully situated
on the bank of a sheet of water 3 miles across,
and the surroundings were very charming.
The town of Fremantle, where he lived, was
at the mouth of the Swan River. They could
travel 123 miles eastward by train, and per-
haps by-and-by they would extend the line
to Eucla, when, if South Australia would
provide the necessary railway across the
intervening territory, a railway journey
might be made from Perth to Adelaide, from
thence to Melbourne, from thence to Sydney,
and from thence to Brisbane. (Applause,)
An old gentleman in speaking to him
lately about the wonderful advancement of
railway projects added, " The worst of it is
these good things are all coming just as you
and 1 are about to pass off the stage."
(Laughter.) He replied, " Don't look at life
on its dark side; let us make the best of it
while we may." (Hear, hear.) He was a bit
of an optimist, and did not take a dark look
at the future. All men seemed to have their
own forebodings. Tides of different political
and social views came in turns upon the
world. He was talking lately with a clever
young man from Adelaide, who held the idea
that Christianity was effete, and there was no
God; but still it was evident that he had
some respect for religion. At his request the
young man stated his views in writing, and
he replied to him at length. In a letter
thanking him for what he had done his
friend said he felt that the denial of the
existence of the Divine Being was owing to
ignorance and prejudice, and he was fully


persuaded there was a God who ruleth over
all. (Applause.) But he was wandering
from the subject. He was in Sydney forty-
nine years ago, when great depression
existed there. He was struck by the
gloomy view taken of the condition Jof
affairs. At a public meeting .the general
cry seemed to be, " The heavens are iron, and
the earth is brass ; our docks are all dying.
We were brought here on false pretences."
How different the scene then from what he
saw in Sydney four years ago ! (Hear, hear )
He became the colleague of an old missionary
who was one of the pioneer missionaries to
Polynesia. In the year 1800 that gentleman
paid a visit to Sydney for some reason, and
in speaking of the town to him said,
"I don't know what it is like now, but
when I was there of all the God-for-
saken places in the world Sydney was
the worst." He remembered seeing twelve
men hanged there one morning be-
fore breakfast. Forty-nine years ago he
went from Sydney by coach to Parra-
matta to see some orange gardens. On
the way back by river a man in a respect-
ful manner asked him in a low confidential
tone, " Had you a free passage out ?" (Laugh-
ter.) He replied, " es," because he had
come out in a missionary vessel. He stayed
with a very excellent man, Mr. David Jones,
who explained to him afterwards what " a
free passage" was taken to imply. When at
the Conference four years ago he saw a
city of noble buildings, with every appear-
ance of progress and civilization and the
presence of an advancing tide of industry.
Some day the tide would flow to the west of
the continent. Very slow progress had yet
been made in Western Australia. During the
last three years they had made more than in
any former ten years. Four years ago the
population was 32,000, now it was 42,000.
They had great natural resources in the land
awaiting development. They were on the eve
of great changes, for they were going to have
home rule, (Hear, hear.) In the United
States when a new piece of territory had a
population of 40,000 they were entitled to
home_ rule. The Imperial Government had
promised to concede responsible government
to Western Australia when the population
reached a point they considered reasonable,
and the request was now being made for it.
The population was over 4C,000, and no doubt
they would get what they wanted. Their
Constitution would be formulated at the end
of the year, and then they would get into
debt and carry on public works. (Laughter
and Hear, hear.) The colony had awakened
out ot its former state of sluggishness.
It was unfair to describe the people
as lazy. He knew many who had
worked hard and long. (Hear, hear.) Just
now a temporary depression was passing
over the colony, owing 'partly to the action
of Melbourne and Sydney friends, who came
over and started a land speculation mania,
from which_ there was now a reaction. (Hear,
hear). Thirty-six years ago the population
was only 3,000. Unfortunately the Govern-
ment then proposed to introduce the convict
element; the people accepted the idea, and
11,000 prisoners had been sent out. Each
prisoner was accompanied by a pensioner
soldier, who had been got rid of in that way
because he was thriftless and disorderly.
Wives and children came out also, and
seven-tenths of the added population
belonged to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thus the Congregationalists had much to
contend against. One-third of the whole
population now were Catholics. As the con-
victs were scattered over the country making
roads and bridges the Government sent out
some twelve Church of England chaplains to
minister to their spiritual wants. They re-
ceived £IOO per annumn from the British
Government, and it was recommended that
the colony should give another £IOO. A few
years ago the former grant was in effect with-
drawn, as it would not be renewed to
the successors of the clergymen sent
out. But the grant from the Colonial
Treasury still continued, and he believed
£2,000 would be paid this year. Following
upon the sending out of subsidized Church
of England clergymen, the Roman Catholics
put in their claim for assistance, and they got
£1,200 and a separate grant for schools. Then
the Wesleyans and Presbyterians and other
bodies put infclaims and got something. And
now the Congregationalists were the only
Church that had not put in a claim, (Ap-
plause. ) Their friends said, " Why don't you
accept what will be readily granted you by
the colony ?" Of course they had an uphill
fight, but they did not complain because
their friends the Episcopalians and Catholics
thought it right to take help from the State,
which had no doubt done good in supporting
clergymen in the rural parts. But the
principle s militated against the Congrega-
tional system, and he did not agree with it.
(Hear, hear.) They had lost many of their
people. Naturally, when a man went into
the country with his family, he would, for
their sake, go to the nearest place of worship.
He knew some excellent young men who had
belonged to Dr. Bevan's Church in Melbourne,
and who, having gone 1,000 miles north of Fre-
mantle, had joined an Episcopal Church
because there was no other place of worship
near them but a Catholic Church. They had
made themselves at home there, and were
doing what they could for Christ, but they were
not forgetting the traditions of their Con-
gregationalism. (Hear, hear.) A Congrega-
tional Church had been struggling on for
twenty years at Bunbury, where there were
only 700 inhabitants, without a minister.
Two or three Wesleyan families in the town
started a place of worship, and immediately
received £6O per annum from the Govern-
ment. Other denominations could therefore
take up fields: where the Congregationalists
could not. He and his brother ministers
were treated with the utmost courtesy by
their Roman' Catholic and Episcopal friends.
(Hear, hear.) A few years ago Bishop Parry
on his arrival introduced a newer element
into the working of the Anglican Churches.
A Synod was formed, and local committees
were appointed to aid the clergymen. When
the Bishop went on a, visit to England a
younger clergyman was left in charge.
The younger men in the Church began
several movements, and the clergyman who


was in charge had difficulty in guiding the new
elements that were brought into the Church.
When the Bishop returned the whole case
was laid before him, and he said, " Oh,
really, they have gone too far; this is really
Congregationalism." (Laughter.) So they
had to undo some things they had done. He
heard all about it from a young Churchman
a few days afterwards, who added the re-
mark, "We never dreamt it was Congre-
gationalism. We thought it was common
sense." (Applause and laughter.) He would
not for anything say a word to hurt the
sensibilities of any ministers of other deno-
minations. He had met with uniform kind-
ness from the adherents of every Church.
A young man, a Roman Catholic, asked him
while dying to pray by his bedside. In doing
so he realized very keenly that when we
came to die differences of opinion vanished,
and it was the same Christ who was to be
their help and into whose arms they must
fall. (Loud applause.)
The CHAIRMAN submitted the sentiment
"Our Christian Workers under Other
Flags." (Applause.) They were sometimes
called a most cantankerous denomination,
but in reality they were large-hearted and
liberal. They could woik with anybody.
(Hear, hear.) However, they were sur-
rounded in Adelaide by loyal friends. Bishop
Kennion, in a letter to him, said—" I sin-
cerely trust you will have a most happy and
profitable time." (Hear, hear.) He regretted
that Archdeacon Farr could not address
them, he having an engagement to keep with
his Bishop. (Hear, hear.) He saw there his
dear friend and colleague in many things, Dr.
Paton. They might not be equally matched
in size, but they worked shoulder to shoulder,
nevertheless, on the University Council, in
the work of Union College, and in the town.
He also saw near him Mr. Simpson, who
belonged to that great body which was a
standing proof that sacerdotalism was not to
be the religion of the Anglo-Saxon race.
(Applause.) Another colleague in town, Mr.
Mead, had retired, but perhaps Mr. Rice
would say something in his stead.
The Rev. Dr. PATON said he felt that
having come to the luncheon he had been
taken in, if not done for. (Laughter.) He
would not like to say that he was indignant at
the Chairman for calling upon him, because, as
he said, they had worked shoulder to shoulder.
He supposed that he was expected to speak
for the Presbyterians. By-the-way, he
wished Dr. Bevan had taken that duty upon
him, because undoubtedly he had a much
larger circle of Presybterian friends than he
had. He understood that Dr. Bevan was
just about as distinguished a Presbyterian
minister in America as he was a Congrega-
tionalist in London and at present in Mel-
bourne. (Hear, hear.) Therefore he could
have spoken with more authority on a
subject such as that before them. Perhaps,
however, he did not know the Presbyterians
of South Australia quite as well as he (Dr.
Paton) did, notwithstanding that his general
knowledge was vastly more comprehensive
than his own. (Hear, hear.) Well, he
thanked them most heartily for the expres-
sion of their good wishes towards the Presby-
terian Church. In Scotland they were taught
that deeds spoke more emphatically than
words, and he thought that his presence
there gave evidence of how thoroughly
he sympathized with his friends in the work
that they did. (Applause.) Certainly there
was only one feeling among the Presbyterians
—that if Congregationalists made progress in
good work so would they make progress
along with them, (Hear, hear.) They could
not go along the good road without helping
the Presbyterians to go along too. So he
rejoiced in the work they did, and in the
good influences of all Christian Churches,
and he hoped that a closer union would by-
and-by be accomplished between the Presby-
terian Churches and other Churches in the
world. (Applause.)
The Rev. J. Y. SIMPSON said a story was
told of a traveller who, in crossing a Scotch
moor on a dark night, lost himself. At last
he saw a dim light ahead, and, making for it,
found a lonely hut. Knocking at the door,
he had no response. He knocked louder,
and then cried out, " Are there any Christian
people here?" A shrill voice nailed from
inside, " Nae, nae, we're all Johnsons and
Carmichaels !" (Laughter.) It was a comfort
to know that the assembly around him were
not Johnsons and Carmichaels, but re-
presented the Christian people of South Aus-
tralia. (Hear, hear.) They had come together
in the bonds of brotherhood in Jesus Christ.
On behalf of the Methodist Church he could
say they always had the kindest feelings
towards the grand old Independent Church
of England. Their hearts were thrilled with
the story of the fights for independence and
the right to worship God as the dictates of
conscience laid down. He liked the designa-
tion referred to by Mr. Johnston, which
characterized Congregational principles as
common sense. (Hear, hear.) So the Metho-
dists regarded those principles on that broad
platform. They felt that in a young land
like South Australia the two Churches that
were most adapted to meet the wants of a
rising people were the Congregational and
the Methodist bodies. The former invited
the friendship of members of every denomi-
nation. The teachings and forms of worship
could meet the wants of families who, away
from the centres of population, could not find
any of the recognised Churches of other de-
nominations, and Congregationalists were
ever ready to make a home if called upon in
other Churches. (Hear, hear.) The Metho-
dists, by their itinerant system and lay
preachers, were able to go out, as they had
done in South Australia, as a pioneer
Church, and able also to maintain
the attitude of being friends of all and
enemies of none. (Applause.) The associa-
tions of the Congregational body were
peculiarly fitted to meet the wants of young
peoples, like we had in Australia. Other
Churches had a right to come in and occupy
the land, and then they could all work side
by side in friendliness, and wish each other
godspeed. (Applause,) His Church greatly
appreciated the honour that the Congre-
gationalists and the City of Adelaide were
receiving in the presence of the distinguished
guests from England. He would not be loyal


to his Church if he did not say that she had
a very great and profound regard for Dr.
Dale. (Applause.) His utterances in the
mother land about Methodism had been ex-
ceedingly kind. He had especially com-
mended their system of class-meetings, and
expressed his regret that an effort he had
made to introduce it into his own Church had
failed. He laid a solemn charge upon the
Methodists that they should never give up
that means of testimony from personal ex-
perience. In Australia—in the South Aus-
tralian Conferences —Dr. Dale's work on
" The Atonement" was one of the text-
books that their young students were
examined in year by year, and so
the Methodists tendered him their thanks,
and offered to him and the other visitors from
England their most hearty and respectful
greetings. (Applause.) He desired to tender
to the Congregationalists as a body the
fraternal greetings of his Church on the fact
that they were celebrating their jubilee.
Some of his friends were looking back with
kindly remembrances and a thankful sense of
indebtedness to Mr. Evan, of Stow Church,
and other saintly men. He rejoiced to see in
their midst their old and mutual friend, Dr.
Jefferis. (Applause.)
The CHAIRMAN said Mr. Rice represented
those Congregational Churches which took
another form. He hoped the day would come
when the name " Baptist" would be dropped
—he did not say drop the principle—so that
the Churches might be one, because the
Baptists and themselves were so very near
each other that it was a pity they were not
nearer. (Hear, hear.)
The Rev. W. E. RICE regretted exceed-
ingly that Mr. Mead had not been able to
remain and respond. It would be strange,
indeed, if the Baptists could not rejoice with
their brethren on an occasion like that. He
was just as much a Congregationalist in
principle as his dear friend and neighbour,
Mr. Hebditch. But a slender stream divided
them. Why should they not step across the
stream and join the Baptists? (Applause
and laughter.) They were like brethren.
The principles that united them were very
much more numerous and important than the
differences that divided them. Nothing
need hinder them from standing shoulder
to shoulder. He was not sure that they were
friendly enough. In the old country a
stronger feeling of friendliness and co-opera-
tion between the two bodies existed than
there was here. At the recent May Meetings
the Congregational and Baptist Unions of
Great Britain and Ireland met together, with
Dr. Dale, Dr. Allon, and Dr. Culross among
them. Why should not the two Churches in
this colony hold their celebrations unitedly ?
(Hear, hear.)
The CHAIRMAN said they could Dot separate
without acknowledging the very great
courtesy shown to the delegates by members
of others Churches in the difficult task of
hospitality. They had a noble offer from the
Chief Justice to throw his house and grounds
open on one afternoon for the entertainment
of members of the Conference, and he was also
the host of Mr. and Mrs. Spicer during their
stay in the city. His Honor was not present,
but perhaps Mr. Thome would reply on his
behalf, and also as representing the Bible
Christian Churches.
The Rev, J. THORPE said his denomination
recognised Mr. Simpson as the federal head
of Methodism in South Australia, If there
was any difference between the Wesleyans
and the Bible Christians, it lay in the latter
being a little nearer the Congregationalists.
(Hear, hear,) His denomination was a small
body, and was only a little over 60 years
old, but they had aimed as far as possible to
unite with Methodist fervour in carrying on
good work in which other Churches were
interested. They had always aimed at
harmony with the Congregationalists. Near
him was a gentleman who was known as
an Independent in Adelaide," while in the
country he was a Bible Christian. There
were a good many like that, and very noble
fellows, too. (Applause.) They were
delighted to welcome Dr. Dale and Mr.
Spicer.
The proceedings then terminated.
COMMUNION SERVICE.
In the evening there was a very large
attendance at Stow Church for the com-
munion service. Dr. Dale presided.
The Rev. J. WALKER (Ipswich) delivered
a most earnest and appropriate address.
The gathering, he said, was unique as com-
pared with the meetings of other Conferences
and Congresses in Adelaide during the
jubilee year. Meetings had been held in the
interests of commerce and of science, but
they had met as the redeemed servants of the
Lord Jesus redeemed by His precious
blood from sin and death to life and
holiness. There was something unique in
the fact that in this distant colony, only fifty
years after its settlement, delegates should
assemble from England, from New South
Wales and Victoria, from Queensland and
New Zealand, and Tasmania and Western
Australia, to join with South Australian
friends in that solemn service. He thanked
God that the Bible truth of the atonement
was being proclaimed in clear tones in their
Churches. There was something intensely
touching in the desire of the Lord Jesus to
impress His disciples first of all with the
profound conviction of His own divine
character, and then to prepare them for His
awful agony and death. Not until His three
years' ministry were nearly over did Christ
put the question to His disciples, " Whom
say ye that I am?" Was there not something
of exulting joy in the heart of the Saviour
when Peter replied, " Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God." And from that
time forth Jesus took a fresh departure in
His ministry to them. He revealed truths
which until that time had been kept in the
background. He took three of the disciples into
a mountain apart, and we had the symbol of
the Transfiguration they needed. There
came to the Saviour from the past Moses and
Elijah to do Him homage. They talked of
the sufferings, the death, and the resurrec-
tion of Christ. Noblest theme that Moses
and Elijah could speak of! Oh, that Chris-
tians realized more and more the great truth
that they had been redeemed by the atoning
sacrifice of Christ. That ordinance was a


witness to the Divine nature of Jesus and to
the supernatural resources of the Christian.
Since Christ had instituted it there had been
changes of all kinds in the world, but his
loyal subjects had never failed to show their
faith in his atoning death by means of it.
Standing on the top of Mount Wellington in
Tasmania he had an experience that he should
not soon forget. Clouds began to gather
below, and by-and-by vivid flashes of light-
ning and loud peals of thunder followed each
other. And yet, with all the darkness and
lightning and roaring he could look at the
face of the sun and the blue sky. It was a
symbol to him of the position of the true
Christian who could rise above the turmoil of
earth and dwell in the glory of the sun of
righteousness.
The supper having been partaken of,
Dr. DALE said —It is not easy, perhaps it is
not possible either, for individual Christian
men or Christian communities to part alto-
gether with the past. It is not easy, per-
haps it is not possible therefore, for us to
escape altogether from the darkness that
settled on the life of Christendom for a
thousand years. The clouds that obscured
the light and joy of Christian hearts are still
hanging about the horizon. The light and
glory which at one time they almost con-
cealed do not reach ourselves, and around
this, the central and most sacred service of
our faith, those clouds still seem to hover.
Through century after century the mysteries
of this service have filled the hearts of devout
men with fear and agitation and dread ; and
even now we Christian people to whom the
Gospel has been restored in its clearness, ful-
ness, and power, have not quite learned that
we should come to the table of Christ in
order that we may rejoice in Him and in His
great redemption. We ought not to ask Him
to be present here. When a friend asks
us to be his guests, and we are sitting
at his table, we expect him to
be there as a matter of course. It is Christ
who asks us to this table, or we should never
have ventured to come. He is our host. We
have to give Him thanks that He has
brought us into His presence. In my early
years devote and earnest Christian men, to
whose words Iwas accustomed to listen, when
Christian people were gathered around
Christ's table used to appeal to them to
search their hearts in order to discover the
evil that was there —used to entreat them to
remember all their unworthiness and sin, and
to determine once more to separate them-
selves from sin and to live a higher and
diviner life. I don't say such appeals are
altogether inappropriate at the table of the
Lord, but I do say that we are here mainly
to rejoice that our sins are forgiven, and to
think not of ourselves, our own shortcomings
and failures, but of Christ. There is this
difference between this service and the ser-
vices which Christian Churches ordinarily
hold. When we gather Sunday after Sunday
in buildings like this it is usual that we
should appeal to God and invoke His
blessing. The movement is from us to
Him, from earth to heaven. When we sit
around this table the movement is altogether
the other way about. The movement is from
Christ to us, from heaven to earth. Through
these symbols He speaks to us as we in our
prayers are accustomed to speak to Him.
In these symbols He speaks to us of the
highest gifts of His grace. We have but to
receive them—not to ask for them. This is
the Eucharist thanksgiving service. It is
not a time so much for prayer as for sacred
song and triumphant joy. What Christ
speaks in this broken bread, what He speaks
in this wine, we have to thank Him for,
being sure that He has not called us here
simply that we may eat the bread, simply
that we may drink the cup. There is no
unreality about any of the institutions
which Christ creates and sanctions. With
His word there is always life and always
power. Coming to His table we should
rejoice that we are sitting where apostles
sat; that we are sitting where martyrs sat;
that we are sitting where the great leaders
of religious revivals sat; that we are sitting
where the saints of bygone ages sat; and
that the unseen Christ is just as near to us
to-day as He ever was to Paul, or Peter, or
James, or John—that His power is instant,
that He is just as able to give us the strength
we need to achieve perfection in righteous-
ness, as He ever was to give that strength to
saints whose sanctity continues to shine out
through the mist and the clouds that gather
over the centuries. We remember Christ.
We hope for the coming of Christ in His
manifested glory when we sit at this table,
but we are not here to think sadly of a Christ
whom we have lost, and from the loss of
whom we have not yet recovered. We are
not here to recall cherished traditions, not
here to endeavour by impressing great
memories or great hopes upon our own hearts
to quicken and deepen the diviner life within
us. The memories are here. How patheti-
cally these symbols appeal to us. The hopes
are here. We know that He who died has
risen again and returned to the heights
of God, that in Him heaven and earth are
restored to each other, and that man and God
are one. " Where two or three are gathered
together in My name there am I in the
midst." What a declaration of a great
spiritual fact! When those who are in
Christ are gathered together in the name of
Christ, there is possible an access on Christ's
part to their spiritual life not possible
elsewhere. Finding each other we find Him.
This service, I say, should be a service of joy
because Christ ministers to us; of joy, too,
because of the great gifts of Christ of which
these symbols speak to us ; but of joy, also,
because we are not here isolated and alone —
we have brothers and sisters at the table of
the Lord. And we miss altogether the true
spirit of this service unless each man thanks
God for the salvation of his brother, as well
as for his own salvation. When 1 look
around on an assembly like this, how deep,
how intense, is my thankfulness that all of
you, as I trust, have received from the
infinite Father the redemption that has been
accomplished for sin; that in you dwells the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost; that your
support is the strength of God in all duty
ancl in all endurance, and though the ties
which bind you to those whom you love on


earth may be dissolved, you are destined by
the eternal thought and purpose of God to
share the righteousness and the blessed-
ness of the Lord Jesus Christ for ever;
that you have accepted that thought, that
you have consented to that purpose, and are
making your calling and election sure. We
may rejoice sometimes—l suppose we all do
rejoice sometimes with a great joy—over our
personal salvation. I know of no gladness
like that which sometimes fills the heart of a
Christian man when at a service like this he
looks around upon a crowd of God's children,
all of whom he hopes have received remis-
sion of sins and the gift of eternal life. The
solitary joy is infinitely augmented when we
see around us hundreds for whom we have to
thank God as we thank Him for ourselves.
What a promise of perfection is here. To
what heights of righteousness must this life
of which the bread speaks to us ultimately
reach. What possibilities of service in this
world and in the world to come must be
theirs who have received and are constantly
receiving afresh the life that is in Christ
Jesus. Let us go away from this table thank-
ing God not only for ourselves, our personal
salvation, and the salvation of those with
whom we have assembled, but resolving to
attempt work that is impossible, because we
have the lite of God to enable us to accom-
plish it.
A collection was taken up on behalf of the
Adelaide City Mission.
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7
On Wednesday the real business of the Con-
ference to celebrate the jubilee of Congrega-
tionalism in South Australia was begun in the
Stow Lecture Hall, after a public breakfast,
at which about 130 delegates and friends sat
down, in the Town Hall Banqueting-room.
It had been intended to carry on the business
in the Town Hall, but for convenience an
adjournment was made to Stow Lecture
Halh The He v. W. R. Fietcher, M.A.
(Chairman), presided over a large and repre-
sentative gathering. After singing and
prayer, the Secretary of the Conference
(Rev. J. C. McMichael) read the following
REPORT OF COMMITTEE.
The year 1887 will be memorable in the
history of South Australia as a year of
jubilee celebrations. As a part of the vast
British Empire we have joined our fellow-
sufcjects in rejoicings on the completion of
fifty _ years of the reign of Her Most
Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria.
As a colony we are commemorating the
jubilee of our existence by the International
Exhibition, into which have been gathered
the_ products of many parts of the world, and
which has already attracted so great a
number of visitors as to lead to the belief
that it will be a financial success in addition
to all the commercial advantages which are
sure to follow.
Our gathering together at this time is to take
part celebration of the jubilee of Con-
gregationalism in the colony and in an Inter-
colonial Conference, and we have the great
pleasure of welcoming ministers and delegates
from the sister !colonies. These Conferences
are to be held at stated intervals in the
future, and cannot fail to be productive of
much good.
The brief report which we present to this
meeting has reference more especially to our
own Churches and to the plans which have
been proposed and partially carried out to
celebrate the arrival in this colony of the
Rev. Thomas Quinton Stow, the pioneer
minister of our Churches, in the month
of October, 1837. The first public services
were held in the November following, and
the first Christian fellowship was formed on
December 13 in the little Chapel of reeds
and canvas that was built on Acre No. 5,
North-terrace.
That small fellowship has grown, and now
meets in the Stow Memorial Churchy thus
completing fifty years of successful Christian
work. The name of the Church is a lasting
memorial of the first pastor, as far as any
material fabric can be ; but the results of the
work of the noble band who formed the first
Congregational Church are to be seen in the
gratifying increase which we have been
privileged to witness during the past fifty
years.
The brief history of our jubilee movement
which we now offer to you is not as bright as
we hoped and believed it would be when it
was entered upon four years ago. We have
had to contend against adverse circumstances
which we could not control in connection
with several years of commercial depression,
so that financially the actual results, so far,
come short of what we feel confident they
would have been under more favourable con-
ditions. We have, however, always kept
steadily in view the paramount importance of
desiring a large increase of spiritual life, feel-
ing satisfied that if this be secured the
money required to remove all our Church
debts and to provide for the extension of
Christian work will not be wanting.
In May, 1883, jubilee meetings were held
in Sydney, in which delegates from this
colony had the privilege of taking part. The
success of those meetings was, we venture to
say, beyond all expectations, and we greatly
rejoice that nothing has happened to check
the work upon which our friends then
entered, and the accomplishment of which
they have been permitted to realise. We
also have equal pleasure in congratulating our
Churches in Victoria on the noble manner in
which they followed the example of our
friends in New South Wales, and we
earnestly desire for them the completion of
the work to which they have put their
hands, and which has been carried on so far
with such enthusiasm and success.
Our jubilee movement was initiated at the
half-yearly meeting of the Congregational


Union and Home Mission, held in Gawler in
October, 1883, Some of our friends who
were present in Sydney in the previous May
gave earnest addresses, Committees were
formed, and it was resolved to celebrate our
jubilee in this year 1887 and to raise a fund
for the removal of Church debts amounting
to £26,000, for the increase of the Ministers'
Provident Fund, and other kindred objects.
At the meeting of the Committee in
January, 1884, between £7,000 and £B,OOO
were reported as promised, and it was decided
to hold a meeting of all our friends during
the annual meetings of the Congregational
Union in April, 1884,
This meeting was looked forward to with
great expectation, and all means adopted to
make it a success. When the time for hold-
ing it drew near it was most reluctantly
postponed, on account of the severe financial
depression from which the colony was suf-
fering and has been suffering ever since, and
the attention of the Committee was directed
to the formation of auxiliaries, visitation of
Churches, and all other means calculated to
excite an interest in the movement in both
young and old.
The jubilee gathering, which had been
postponed for a year, was held on Tuesday,
March 24, 1885, and was a great success.
The Rev. Dr. Jefferis and Mr. W. S.
Buzacott, of Sydney, and the Rev. J. J.
Halley, of Melbourne, attended as a deputa-
tion. The Town Hall was crowded, and the
meeting was marked by deep spiritual
feeling. Further promises were made,
making a total of £12,000.
The Hon. J. H. Angas, M.L.C , kindly
promised to contribute 10 per cent, on all
amounts actually paid up to £50,000, and has
given £5lB 12s. on £5,185 18s. Bd. up to March
31, 1886.
The work thus auspiciously commenced
was carried on earnestly, but nothing could
withstand the commercial depression which
prevailed, and we have had to rest satisfied
with encouraging the auxiliaries, and in this
way a considerable amount has been raised.
As the jubilee term has been extended to
the end of the year 1888, we hope brighter
days are before us. With the prospect of an
abundant harvest after the late welcome rains
and with the return of commercial prosperity
we hope that our auxiliaries will carry on
their work successfully, and numerous and
substantial additions be obtained to the
promises already made. One or two interest-
ing facts may be introduced. In order to
stimulate our smaller country Churches an
immediate bonus of 20 per cent, was promised
on all sums raised towards the extinction of
their debts. One Church accepted the chal-
lenge at once, and in a very short time was
able to claim the bonus, and another Church
hopes to be in a similar position at the end of
the present year. A promise of 10 per cent,
bonus has been made to our suburban
Churches, and we hope they will in a short
time be able to claim it.
The following is an approximate financial
statement: — Promises, £14,000; receipts,
£8,101195. Id.
We now turn to a very pleasing feature of
our jubilee celebration. During a visit to
England in the year 1885 our esteemed friend
Mr. R. Searle, who has taken a deep in-
terest in the jubilee movement from the
commencement, obtained liberal contribu-
tions to our funds, and, better still, ob-
tained the promise of a visit from Dr. R.
W. Dale and Mr. Albert Spicer during the
celebration of our jubilee. We rejoice in
the happy fulfilment of their promise by our
honoured friends, and give them a hearty
welcome to the Australian Colonies.
We hope their sojourn amongst us will be
pleasant to them. We feel certain that it
will be a great blessing to us. It will be a
long time before many of us cease to apply
the term "Home" to England, and we are sure
that the bond of union will be strengthened
if we have an occasional visit from some of
our eminent ministers and influential mer-
chants, who may see our work and encourage
us by kindly words.
In connection with our jubilee it has been
decided to have a permanent record of our
denominational history for the benefit of the
present generation and those who will come
after us. Such a record has been prepared by
the Rev. F. W. Cox, whose name is a suffi-
cient guarantee that as far as possible the
history of Congregationalism during the past
fifty years will be authentic in its details,
and will be given in an instructive and inte-
resting form. The volume is ready for sale,
and we hope to have for it a large circulation
in all the colonies.
Five lectures on important epochs in
English and colonial history in which Cou-
gregationalists are specially interested were
delivered to large audiences during the month
of July. The following was the programme:—
" Queen Elizabeth," Rev. J. C. Kirby ; " Pil-
grim Fathers," Mr. A. Stow, J.P.; "John
Milton," Rev. WVR. Fletcher, M.A.; "The
Ejectment of 1662," Rev. C. Manthorpe;
" The Struggle for Religious Equality in
South Australia," Rev. F. W. Cox. These
lectures were a great success, and several have
been redelivered in some of our suburban and
country Churches.
We are devoutly thankful to our Heavenly
Father for past mercies. We hope that from
the presence, the prayers, and the addresses
of our friends who join with us in the cele-
bration of our jubilee we may be blessed
with a large increase of spiritual life and
such a stimulus as shall secure the fulfilment
of all our wishes.
The CHAIRMAN moved the adoption of the
report. He did so with a good deal of sym-
pathy with the Secretary, who had had a
hard struggle. Those who lived in the midst
of the business life of South Australia knew
how difficult it was to maintain a right jubilee
spirit in the community. The committee
saw two results before them financial
results and higher results and they
realized that the trouble, the difficulty,
and the struggle which had to
be encountered, while they might thwart
their financial ambition, had no power
even to interfere with their spiritual yearn-
ings, and therefore they were determined
that their jubilee celebrations should at all
events be an enthusiastic success—(ap-
plause)—that they would spare no expense,


even out of their own private pockets, to
make the jubilee celebration a happy occa-
sion, and they had prefaced this Conference
with very fervent prayer. For a while
they placed the money question almost
in the background, where they
thought it was necessary to do so.
They thought that the spiritual results were
worth more than any other results. (Hear,
hear.) He could state that during the year
of the greatest depression there were more
spiritual results in connection with the
Church over which he had the honour to be
the pastor than in other years. We had
had dark years. Those who had not lived in
the midst of it could have no conception of
the extent of the depression, and it had been
very hard indeed to maintain a bold front
amidst the difficulties that surrounded us.
(Applause.) However, they knew the
old motto, "Never say die." That
was the principle on which they
had acted, and that was the principle adopted
by their old friend Mr. Stow. (Applause.)
Let them think of the difficulties that brave
man had to contend with. Imagine him with
his own hands helping to build that little
reed shanty, and gathering his flosk there
and organizing his Church there. It was
heroic work, and right nobly he did it.
(Applause.) But he hoped that we had
better times in store. According to the
astronomers, we were beginning a cycle
of good seasons. We had already turned the
corner in this colony. He had thought we
should have turned it before, but we had
done so now. Facts and figures made that
manifest. If twelve months ago they had
proposed anything like a golden offering at
their Churches the idea would have been
regarded as utterly foolish. They had carried
out the idea on Sunday last with satisfactory
results. At North Adelaide 76 gold coins
were put into the plate. (Hear,
hear.) Twelve months ago he did not
suppose there would have been thirty. The
total amount collected was £IOO 03. Id. He
believed the amount obtained at Hindmarsh-
square Church was £125. (Hear, hear.) In
regard to Stow Church the returns were
equally pleasing, as the total offerings
amounted on Sunday to £261195. lOd. (Hear,
hear.) A year ago probably they would not
have reached £SO. The Treasurer, who was
rather fond of figures, had supplied details of
the amounts given. There were sixty-four
donors of gold and eight or nine donors of
paper offerings. The total number of donors
was 1,418, and the offerings were of varied
amounts down to a penny. And God did
not despise the penny donations; perhaps a
penny in the sight of the Master was as
welcome as the gold or the cheques. (Hear,
hear.) At Glenelg about £25 was collected,
and the Church at Wallaroo, which was
struggling with difficulties and was
attended by working miners, contributed
£B, which must have done Mr.
Lloyd's heart good. (Applause.) Most of the
collection in Stow Church went towards the
general Jubilee Fund. Throughout this
movement the Church had been in some
degree unselfish, and had taken the General
Fund as the object of their subscriptions.
(Hear, hear.) The undertaking had perhaps
been a little crippled and chilled, owing to
Churches collecting only towards defraying
their own debts. He thought they should
have had confidence in one another, and
poured all the collections intoonegeneralfund,
which might be apportioned afterwards.
(Hear, hear.) He hoped they would feel that
they had made a start, and that they would
not rest until they had carried on their work
to victory. They had other work to do
besides paying present debts. He appealed
to members of Churches in South Australia,
Victoria, and New South Wales, if it did not
rest upon them, now that there was being
gathered in an obscure corner of New South
Wales a large population which was being
crystallized into two or three towns,
to do something to help them. (Applause.)
Silverton and Broken Hill were crying out
for help, and they had claims upon each of
the three colonies. The place belonged
geographically to New South Wales, and
commercially, he supposed, to this colony.
He could hardly say that, because the head-
quarters of the mining interest was in
Victoria. So that they all ought to do the work.
He was glad to say that Mr. Spicer had pro-
mised £25 towards the movement if it was
began at once. (Hear, hear.)
The Rev. F. W. Cox (in the absence of the
Rev. C. Manthorpe) seconded the adoption
of the report. Very great difficulties had
been met with in carrying on the jubilee
movement thus far, but they were beginning
to see the way clear before them, and hoped
to bring the whole matter to a satisfactory
issue. In the pecuniary aspect they must
come short, but the Conference would doubt-
less be of permanent benefit, and they were
already beginning to feel that the visits of
their friends from England and the other
Australasian colonies was proving a blessing
to them. (Hear, hear.)
The report was adopted.
RELIGIOUS EQUALITY IN THE COLONIES.
TBy the Rev. Dr. JEFFERIS, of Sydney.]
I have been requested to present to this
assembly an account of the struggle for re-
ligious freedom in JNew South Wales, i.e., as
I understand it, the struggle for the freedom
of religion from State endowment and con-
trol. To do this in the brief time allotted
me is, of course, impossible, but something
may be said and I will endeavour to say it.
If any of you are thinking that the religious
history of New South Wales is not specially
interesting to the other colonies, do not forget
that the history of New South Wales for the
first half-century is the history of Australia.
In less than six months we Australians shall
close the first hundred years of our national
life. There are three distinct periods into
which the century may ba divided for the
purpose we have in view. For forty-eight
years the State supported religion by endow-
ing one of the sects ; for twenty-six years the
State supported religion by endowing or
offering to endow all the sects; for the last
twenty-five years the State has refused to
endow any of the sects. Thus we get a little
less than half a century of State and Church,
a little more than a quarter of a century of
State and Churches, and exactly a quarter


of a century of the State freed from the
Churches and the Churches freed from
the State. 1. During the first of these
periods the Episcopal Church was domi-
nant and endowed. When Governor Phillip
arrived in Port Jackson in January, 1788,
he brought with him a clergyman of the
Church of England as chaplain, but religion
was not in much request. The history of the
United States began with thanksgiving and
prayer on the Pilgrim Rock. The history of
Australia began without any public act of
gratitude or consecration. The English flag
was reared, and the officials gathering round
it drank the King's health and success to the
settlement with enthusiasm and vivacity;
but no knee was bent to the King of Kings,
no prayer was offered to the God of nations.
Judge Burton, who wrote the annals of that
early time, remarks, " How much more
might have been expected in the moral
and religious condition of the settlers, if
that occurrence had been marked by a
becoming act of religion." During six
years, so great was official apathy, divine
worship was celebrated in the open air, and
the first Church in Australia was erected at
the parson's cost. For thirteen years there
appears to have been hardly any voluntary
worshippers. One of the earlier Governors
was informed by the clergyman that only
5,006 persons out of the entire colony
attended divine worship. Orders were
promptly issued "with the view of com-
pelling the population to attend regularly
at Church." Not long afterwards the Church
was burned down, and no doubt was enter-
tained (I quote history) "that it was the
work of an incendiary, who hoped to free
himself and his companions from the neces
sity of obeying the regulation." It was the
boast of the officials of those days that the
colony was founded on the principle that the
Established Church of England was the
Established Church of the colonies. But
religion sanctioned and enforced by authority
does not carry with it much to move the
higher feelings of our nature. Absolute in-
difference or open antagonism are the
natural fruits of it. It must not be sup-
posed, however, that during this period in-
difference and hostility were universal. The
earlier Episcopalian ministers worked with
unselfish devotedness, and as time passed
others came, chiefly Roman Catholics and
Presbyterians. Religion began to express
itself in various forms of worship. For
nearly fifty years, however, no denomination
other than the Church of England was
acknowledged by Government beyond the
limits of a charitable toleration. For the
Established Church ample provision was
made. In every township 400 acres were
allotted for the maintenance of the minister
and 200 for the schoolmaster, besides which
large sums of money were granted from
the public Treasury. As a matter of
grace, but not of right, a Roman
Catholic priest and a Presbyterian minister
likewise received help from the State. The
most memorable event in our earlier ecclesias-
tical history happened in 1826, nearly forty
years after the foundation of the colony. In
that year the profligate George IV., seeking
probably to compound with Heaven for his
sins, endowed the Church of England by
Royal Charter, with one-seventh of the land
of Australia. But the time for such flagrant
monopoly had gone by, and a passive resis-
tance to the charter was offered by those in
authoricy. Grants of land, however, were
made, until at length 435,765 acres in different
parts of the colony were in the hands of the
trustees. The process of absorption was
effectually checked bv a revocation of the
charter by William IV. in 1833. The lands,
therefore, reverted to the Crown, though
they were held falsely, as I conceive, to be
dedicated to religion and religious education.
Archdeacon Broughton, reiying upon the
terms of the charter, claimed all for his
Church, but Governor Bourke, with the con-
sent of the Home authorities, and in defiance
of the charter, decided that they must be for
all denominations. An Act was accordingly
passed in 1836, called the Church Act, by
which the principle of religious equality was
affirmed. The Episcopal Church was dis-
established, and help was offered by Govern-
ment to all the sects that were willing to
receive it. 2. With the passing of the Church
Act in 1836 we enter upon the period of
concurrent endowment. Four denominations
submitted to the Government terms. The
offer, indeed, was tempting enough. Endow-
ments for the ministers from £IOO to £2OO,
and help in building Churches and parsonages
from £3OO to £I,OOO. Besides this there were
the revenues from the Church and school
lands estate ; two-sevenths of these were
devoted to denominational education, and
five-sevenths were distributed among the four
denominations. I need not say that the Con-
gregational Churches were not seduced from
their allegiance to free-churchism by these
tempting offers. If there were a few who did
not understand our principles, and were
almost inclined to listen to the voice of the
charmer, the great majority, headed by Dr.
Ross, my noble piedecesor in the pastorate of
Pitt-street Church, somewhat scornfully
refused the proferred gifts. I found recently
among our Church records a letter from the
Government offering us a site, one of the finest
sites for a Church in the Southern Hemi-
sphere, a site which has since been absorbed
into the premises of the Roman Catholic
Cathedral. And it was owing to the men of
our Churches that this miserable concurrent
endowment came to an end. In 1862 an agi-
tation was commenced, culminating in an
enthusiastic public meeting, addressed by
several of our leading ministers. Soon after
this a Bill was brought into Parliament for
prohibiting all State grants for religion. A
debate ensued lasting over four days, during
which the speeches of Mr. Slatyer and Mr.
Kent were freely quoted with praise and
blame as the authors of the movement. On
July 25 the Bill passed its second reading by a
narrow majority—29 to 28—and in due time
became law. 3. We now enter upon the third
period. The Established Church has gone.
Concurrent endowment has ceased. The
State and Church have agreed to separate.
By the Public Worship Prohibition Act of
1862, 26 Vic., No. 19, all grants for public
worship have ended. At the passing of the


Act 155 ministers were on th 6 pay-list of Go-
vernment. One of its clauses guaranteed
their stipends until they died or left the
colony. Direct State aid is now therefore a
perpetually diminishing quantity so far as
ministerial stipends are concerned. But in
spite of this Act, and in absolute contradic-
tion to the spirit if not the letter of it, State
aid continued after 1862. (1) The Church and
school lands estate was still in the hands of a
committee irresponsible to Parliament, and
the income was distributed among the four
denominations; (2) denominational schools
were subsidized by a yearly vote of Parlia-
ment; (3) Protestant and Roman Catholic
orphanages were supported; (4) grants of land
continued to be made as sites of Churches,
school, and parsonages; (5) chaplains of gaols
were paid; (6) three denominational Colleges
were endowed to the extent of £1,500 a year
with building grants, part of which had been
paid up to £20,000 each, all this in addition
to 10 acres of land close to the University,
and of immense value. During the period
under review much of this incubus, the result
of past legislation, has been removed. In
1880, undoubtedly through action taken by
the Congregational Union of New South
Wales, the Church and school lands estate,
valued in Parliament at £2,000,000 sterling,
was declared by an Act of the Legislature to
be waste lands of the Crown, and was trans-
ferred from religious to educational uses. A
little later, by resolution of the Lower House,
grants of land for Churches and parsonages
were stopped. After a very fierce struggle
the grants to denominational schools ceased
in 1879, and very recently the denominational
orphanages were emptied and closed, and the
land and buildings reverted to the Crown.
There is not much more to be done to achieve
the absolute separation of Church and State.
It is unfortunate that the history of the
struggle for religious liberty cannot be told
without such constant reference to money
grants and endowments. But every student
of ecclesiastical history knows that Estab-
lishment means endowment. It is
the money bond which unites Church
and State. But for chains of _ gold
too readily offered and too lightly
worn, the Church of Christ would declare
her absolute independence of earthly Govern-
ments. The Church is a spiritual institu-
tion ; her functions are spiritual. What-
ever of material means are wanting to dis-
charge her sacred duties ought to be raised
by the voluntary gifts of her sons and
daughters as the result of spiritual con-
secration. In future on this side the
globe it will have to be so. Australia with
united voice has declared in favour of a "free
Church in a free State." (Applause.)
The Rev. J. J. HALLEY gave an interesting
address on the same question, as it affected
Victoria. There had hardly been a struggle
for religious liberty in that colony in the true
sense of the term. Compared with _ the
struggle in England, where the opposition
forces of social and political life and customs,
of wealth, and of a great historical Church
were so strong, it seemed to him that the
poor struggles in Victoria were hardly worth
passing mention. It was certain that the
victory would be won in England sooner
or later. (Hear, hear.) The story re-
garding Victoria began with Dr. Jefferis's
second period. During the former time
they belonged to New South Wales. They
brought away from that colony many things,
both bad and good, and among others the
idea of concurrent endowment. Under the
old Constitution a sum of £30,000 per annum
was set apart for religious purposes in the
State. In addition, there were some small
grants of land, including the piece on which
stood Dr. Bevan's Church, over which Con-
gregationalists had been so much twitted.
The land was asked for by their good old
friend John Faulkner, who was one of the
founders of Melbourne, and who used to
say that as he had founded the settlement
he did not see why he should not
endow the Church with a bit of his own
property. (Laughter.) However, it was
quite certain that as soon as Congrega-
tionalism established itself in Victoria the
struggle against concurrent endowment
began. It could hardly be called a struggle
for religious equality, because the State was
ready to treat all alike. A bag of sweet-
meats was placed on the table, and anybody
who liked could put in their hand and take
some of it. (Laughter.) Some of their
congregations were urged to do so._ He had
with him a letter from their good friend, Mr.
W. Moss, one of the survivors of that time —
(Hear, hear)—and he told him that a number
of influential members of other Churches
strongly urged him to take a grant. Mr.
Moss was then receiving a stipend of some-
thing under £2OO per annum, and all he
would have to do was to go to the Treasury
and ask for a grant, and he would get £3OO
from the State in regular payments of £25
per month. A temptation like that must
have required strong principle to be resisted,
especially in bad times when many of his
own people were urging him to take the
grant. (Hear, hear.) They ought to give all
honour to the old pioneers of their Church
of that time. He did not know whether Mr.
Moss would like to be styled "an old
pioneer," but the fact remained that he and
others manfully resolved to have nothing to
do with the lucre that came from the State.
Then in 1855 the Constitution Act was
passed. Clause 53 of that Act provided that
" For the advancement of the Christian re-
ligion in V ictoria the sum of £50,000 shall be
reserved on the eighth part of schedule D,
part 8, to promote the erection of buildings
for public worship, and the maintenance of
ministers of religion, and such sum shall be
apportioned to each denomination by the
last census, every such appointment to be
made under regulations to be framed by the
Governor and Executive Council and sub-
mitted to both Legislative Houses ; provided
that no moneys exceeding in the aggregate
the sum of £25,000 shall be issued in any one
year in aid of the stipends of ministers of
religion." Very shortly afterwards the first
of the Intercolonial Congregational Con-
ferences that had taken place in Australia
was held at Collins-street Church, Mel-
bourne, and on February 20, 1855,
the following resolution was passed—


" That this Conference commenced at a time
when new and permanent constitutions for
the different Australian Colonies are about
to come into operation, and when free scope
will be afforded for the action of the public
mind upon affairs of government and legisla-
tion, deems it important to give distinct and
emphatic avowal to its convictions upon the
relation of the State to religion. It is the
opinion of this Conference that it is
not the province of Government to do
more for religion than to throw
around its adherents, in common with
the whole community, the protection
of law; and that all interference in so sacred
and so spiritual a department in the way of
legislation, permanent endowment, periodical
or occasional grants of money or gifts of
land, is contrary to sound policy, repugnant
to the principles of the Mew Testament and
injurious to the cause it professes to aid.
This Conference would further give prominent
expression to the fact that voluntaryism in
religion as opposed to State interference
to the full extent expressed in this
resolution, is an essential and fundamental
principle of Congregational independency as
understood and practised by the Congre-
gationalists of the British Empire, both in
the parent land and all its colonial depen-
dencies. It is further the opinion of this
Conference that as the errors committed by
former generations in the different nations of
Europe on the subject of State support of
religion have been the prolific sources of
heart burning and dissensions among fellow-
citizens and of unspeakable injury to
religion itself, and as the progress of
enlightenment in Europe is at this moment
strong in the direction of correcting and even
eradicating these fatal errors, it is in the
highest degree inexpedient and impolitic to
transplant into new communities in this
hemisphere obsolete and worn-out principles
and usages, whose only influence can be to
prolong unnecessary agitation and to impede
and embarrass sound legislation." (Applause.)
That was the first protest against State aid
to religion uttered in an Intercolonial Con-
ference. The vote of £50,000 was afterwards
increased, he believed, by another £30,000,
but the Congregationalists made a continual
protest, and they did not stand alone. The
United Presbyterians, the Baptists, the
United Methodist Free Church, and the
Bible Christians also protested. (Applause.)
The Wesley ana said they were opposed to
State-aid in the abstract, but they took the
money in the concrete. (Laughter.) So
their action did not help on the battle very
much. The vote had hitherto been for the
Christian religion. But the Jews said,
" Why should we not have a grant 1" So the
Legislature gave them an annual grant of
£6OO. Then the Chinese came in, he believed.
(Laughter.) They did not see why a grant
should not be made for Confucianism. No
grant was given, but in a certain case a piece
of land was allowed the Chinese for a build-
ing. So the State went cn helping religious
or irreligious people in all sorts of directions.
The whole thing bore on the face of it an
absurdity, and the battle against the practice
went on and on. The Congregationalists
wanted the law repealed, and they went in
for the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill.
Perhaps they might have obtained
their ends more quickly if they had compro-
mised matters a little at first. They called
for an immediate total abolition of State aid,
and would not consent to give way an inch.
Time went on, and ultimately in 1870 an Act
was passed setting out in clause 1 that
" From and after December 31, 1875, no
moneys shall be set apart for the advance-
ment of the Christian religion in Vic-
toria under the provisions of section
53, and for public worship under
the eighth part of schedule D of the Consti-
tution Act, and as from that day such
provisions Bhall be and the same are hereby
repealed." So that the Churches who
received the grants had five years given them
wherein to put their houses in order—grants
under the Constitution Act being made to
Churches and not to individuals—and in
December, 1875, the last penny for the direct
support of religion by the State was paid in
Victoria. (Hear, hear.) Then they had the
matter of lands, They altered that, not by
resolution, as in New South Wales, but by
Act of Parliament. The section read—" So
much of section 6 of the Land Act, 1869, as
relates to reservations of Crown lands for
places of public worship and dwelling-houses
for the ministers of any religious denomina-
tion shall be, and the" same is hereby re-
pealed, as from July 1, 1870. save as to any
reservation or application for reservation
which may have been made thereunder
before the said date." From July 1, 1870, no
grounds had been given to religious purposes
by the State. (Hear, hear.) He had de-
scribed the main battle. There was one
matter which they inherited from New South
Wales that interfered a little with religious
liberty. The Presbyterians and the Church of
England people might get married where
they liked and by whom they liked ; but any
one else had to declare that they belonged to
the denomination of the minister who was to
perform the marriage service. That little
hardship was brought from New South
Wales, but it lasted only a few months.
Then, with respect to education, the colony
had at first national and denominational
schools. The result was that in a small town
where one respectable school should be suffi-
cient many different denominational schools
of interior character might get grants from
the State. They had a minimum of education
at the maximum of expense. As time went
on what was known as the Public Schools Act
was passed, which abolished the distinction
between national and denominational schools,
but still gave grants to the latter. Ihen
came the present Act, by which the State
took over the whole primary education of
the coloDy, made it compulsory for all
children to attend school, made education
free, and declared that all primary education
by the State should be absolutely and com-
pletely secular. (Hear, hear.) Ministers of the
gospel and other persons might, if they liked,
after school hours, go into the schools and
impart religious instruction. Many of them
did so. Many were crying out for the read-
ing of the Bible in the schools, which some


people regarded as State aid to religion in
another form. ("No, no," "Yes;" and
Dr. Jefferis —" You had better learn a lesson
from New South Wales.") In Victoria they
had inherited from New South Wales the
idea of having separate burial grounds, but
they had not gone so far as that colony had
done in having denominational ceme-
teries altogether apart from each other.
They had general cemeteries, where the
denominational boundaries were marked out
by flower-bads and gravel paths. Insidious
attempts were made_ to limit the rights of
ministers to officiate in parts not set apart
for their own Churches, but they had failed.
Congregational principles had triumphed all
along the line. Australia must have free
Churches in a free State, and the genius of
Anglo-Saxonism must carry that idea forward,
until by and-by England had a complete
system of religioua freedom and equality.
(Applause.)
The Rev. F. W. Cox said he was thinking
while Dr. Jefferis was speaking of New
South Wales how widely different were the
circumstances under which South Australia
was first settled. He had had the advantage
of a somewhat intimate acquaintance with
the founders of the colony, and also with the
documents relating to the first settlement
which took place in Kangaroo Island, where
it was supposed the capital of the colony
would be—(laughter)—and it was exceed-
ingly interesting to a Christian mind
to know how earnest and solicitous those
to whom the founding of the colony owed its
origin were for the establishment of the
colony, not only upon godly principles, but
upon a basis of perfect religious equality. The
care of the aboriginals and restraints on the
liquor traffic were carefully provided for, and
the first settlers actually brought out the
proprietor of a coffee palace that was to be
started in Kangaroo Island. (Laughter.)
They brought out a schoolmaster for the
young and a sailors' missionary to look after
the seamen. When the colony was first
formed it was provided by the Imperial
Government that settlers should have the
opportunity of appointing chaplains of the
Church of England for religious purposes in
the colony. Under the Act of Settlement
the Kirk of Scotland carried equal privileges
with the Church of England. Every possible
obstacle was thrown by the Government in
the way of the establishment of the colony,
and in the way of their methods of settling
it. Even at the last moment a proviso was
made that if there were not 20,000 people in
the colony within ten years of the beginning of
the settlement the whole of the colony should
revert to the Home Government. At the
end of the period the population numbered
24,000, so the colony went on. Very early
the desire for State grants and State pay
manifested itself. As early as 1841 Governor
Gawler submitted a pet scheme of his own
to Lord John Russell, of which the essential
point was that, to make " provision for the
religious destitution of the colony," land
should be sold for ss. an acre to trustees for
religious and educational purposes. In a
country about seventeen times as large
as England and Wales, where the
colonial capitals were further away than
London was from New York, it might
seem a very small thing to sell land for
Church purposes at ss. per acre, instead of at
the standard price of 20s. Mr. Stow, how-
ever, saw what the thing really meant, and
he wrote a letter to the Register in July,
1841, contending that the scheme was more
dangerous than a direct endowment would
be, as thousands upon thousands of acres
might be taken up and held in perpetuity,
giving to their holders an immense advantage
over colonists who gave 20s. per acre. He
fought the battle bravely, and it ended
in the scheme coming to nothing. It came
out in the course of the discussion upon
it that there were 13,000 people in the colony,
and Mr. Stow congratulated himself on the
fact of there being six ordained ministers,
one divinity student, and a number of able
lay preachers. This gave one minister for
every 2,166 people, and Mr. Stow repudiated
the idea of spiritual destitution. How much
stronger would his argument have been if he
could have foreseen the result of the next
forty years' voluntary effort to evangelize the
people, when there were enumerated in the
census of 1881 no fewer than 341 clergy-
men to (say) 300,000 people, giving one
minister of religion to 881 people, besides
the host of valuable lay preachers and
readers in almost every section of the
Christian Church. (Applause.) When it
was considered that the people were scattered
over such a vast area of country, in which
roads, bridges, and works of excavation had
to be carried out, it was a matter of surprise
that there should be one stated minister for
every 881 souls. In 1846 the old idea that
State endowments were necessary for re-
ligion revived, and the nominee Legislative
Council proposed to legislate on the
subject again. It would seem that
at first a sort of capitation grant of
2s. per head was proposed, and then
it was thought that £1 for £1 should be given
to all denominations. An offer of the latter
kind must have been very tempting to poor
Churches, and a large amount of human
virtue and divine grace was needed to resist
it, especially when friendly Churches received
such a grant and increased on account of it.
(Hear, hear.) A meeting of citizens called
by Sheriff Newenham, on July 20, 1846, was
held at the old Courthouse in Way mouth-
street to express " their views on the pro-
priety of the measure being passed by the
Legislative Council for promoting religion and
education." Dr. Wyatt moved,and the Master
of the Supreme Court (quaint old Henry
Jickling) seconded a motion in favour of the
measure. Mr. Stow moved as an amendment,
and Mr. Anthony Forster (of the Register)
seconded —"That in the opinion of this
meeting no portion of the public revenue of
the colony should be applied by the Govern-
ment towards the support of religion." This
amendment was carried enthusiastically by
four-fifths of an audience of 500 people. Only
100 Church of England people went to the
meeting. A considerable amount of petition-
ing went on on both sides, and as the Governor
abruptly refused to give heed to an influential
deputation that waited on him an organization


was set on foot groaning under the stu-
pendous name of "The South Australian
Anti-State-Support-for-Religion League." It
was, however, much more lively than its
name, and did good work for some time. A
Society was immediately formed on the other
side with a shorter name, but of small
vitality, "The South Australian Church
Society," of which very little was heard. At
a meeting on August 21, 1846, the Legislative
Council determined, in spite of the public
protest to make a grant, and in the course
of 1847 £5OO was voted for this purpose,
and to be available until June 30, 1851.
At that time a special resolution of the
Council continued it until August, 1851, and
the sum of £ll9 10s. lOd. was voted to close
the account to the last-named date. This
was the last payment made by the Govern-
ment. (Hear, hear.) The final closing of
the State grant arose from the extension of
the Legislative Council from pure nominee
to the addition of sixteen elective members
added to the eight nominees. This change
caused the election throughout the colony to
turn upon the one point—" Shall religion be
left to the voluntary effort of those who believe,
or shall the State make grants to the various
bodies from general taxation ?" On August
29, 1851, Mr. Gwynne introduced a Bill for
concurrent endowment. Captain Bagot gave
reasons for not allowing the Bill to be read
even for the first time on the ground, among
others, that " it was the re-enactment of a
defunct ordinance." Mr. George Kingston
protested against the reintroduction of the
Bill " after the all but unanimous demonstra-
tion of the colonists against it." The amend-
ment that the Bill be read that day six
months was carried at once by 12 votes against
9. During the time the State grant lasted
the total amount paid was £2,669 145., distri-
buted as follows Church of England, £1,791
155.; Church of Rome, £247 75.; Church of
Scotland, £293 145.; and Wesleyans, £336 18s.
The salary and allowances to the Colonial
Chaplain would be between £3OO and £4OO a
year additional. This office was held at the
time by the Rev. Dean Farrell, an esteemed
Church of England minister, and was left
untouched by common consent, which was
creditable to the victorious party. Here was
shown that powerful principle in the English
character to respect personal vested interests,
and also the feeling perhaps that the
principle for which the lovers of free
religion contended did not necessarily extend
to those cases where men were placed in
such circumstances as not to be able to
exercise their usual rights or privileges of
citizenship—such as the occupants of prisons,
hospitals, asylums, and similar Government
establishments. The grant of £3OO and
perquisites was left in the hands of the
Dean as long as he lived, and at his
death a portion of the money was distributed
among several persons, ministerial or lay,
who regularly pet formed the required
functions at the Stockade, the Gaol, and the
Asylums. (Hear, hear.) The marriage laws
had given rise to some disputes. Whin he
read the Nonconformist or the Christian
World about the state of the marriage laws
at home he did not know whether more to
admire the patience with which they endured
the ills that the law compelled them
to bear or to feel angry with
them for not rising as one man to
overthrow the injustice that existed. He
would recommend, as showing the whole
facts, a Bluebook published a few years ago
on the marriage laws of Great Britain, with
a report by a Parliamentary Committee. (A
Delegate—" There are no less than sixty-
three Acts of Parliament regulating mar-
riages in the United Kingdom.") The
condition of the marriage laws in Britain
was monstrous and anomalous. (Hear,
hear.) At the very beginning of the
colony as soon as an Anglican minister
landed he could perform a legal marriage
ceremony without any local authorization.
A Catholic priest and a minister of the
Church of Scotland could do the same. This
was felt for a long time to be a very serious
violation of that principle of religious equality
on which the colony was formed. Great
efforts were made to set the matter right, and
a Religious Equality League was formed of
all denominations of Christians to deal with
it. In one attempt they were beaten. In
answer to the appeals of the League the Govern-
ment of the day brought in a Bill towards the
close of 1886, which was heartily supported.
But just before the second reading the Roman
Catholics held a great meeting and passed
strong resolutions against the Bill. The
House got frightened, and ultimately the
Bill was rejected. Then ensued a very lively
time indeed in the way of newspaper corre-
spondence, and on December 14 a crowded
meeting of Protestants was held in Chalmers
Church, and reports of which to the number
of 2,500 were printed and circulated through-
out the country at the expense of the late
Mr. G. H. Angas. Then came recommenda-
tions from the Legislature to the League to
prepare a Bill of their own, to be
brought in by a member of the House, and
supported by the Government if satisfactory
as to its principles and details. Conse-
quently at a meeting of the League on June
7, 1867, it was resolved—" That the Rev. F.
W. Cox be requested to prepare draft of a
Bill embodying the above resolutions (that is,
those discussed in the Synod of the Church of
England and in the Baptist Association) as
altered and amended in committee, together
with _ the suggestions now made in
committee," &c. This idea was carried
out, the_ whole draft was discussed
along with suggestions from ministers
in all parts of the colony, and eventually the
draft went into the hands of the Government
Draftsman (Mr. Charles Mann), when it was
brought before the House by the Hon. T.
Reynolds, and in a short time became law.
This, the Marriage Act of 1867, gave the
colony what the mother country had been
seeking and sighing for in vain for many
years past—a simple and uniform mar-
riage law, applicable to all sections of
the Church and to all circumstances.
It said nothing about place. The cere-
mony must be performed by a stated
minister of religion. All ministers had
to make application to the Governor for
authority to marry and to issue licences for


the same, which application had to be sup-
ported by the signature of a minister of
religion already on the roll. To prevent
oppression an alternative was allowed to an
applicant to present a memorial to the
Governor, signed by twenty householders,
stating that he was their minister, and had
been for the previous six months statedly
officiating as such. On receipt of such
application in either form, the Governor
would give the necessary authority, and it
duly appeared in the Gazette. All papers
were furnished by the Government, and the
forms were : the declaration of both parties,
the licence, the certificates in triplicate—one
for the bride, one for the local registrar, and
the other for the Registrar General in Ade-
laide. The marriage might take place any-
where—it generally took place in private
houses, at any hour of day or night—evening
marriages being very common, the sole
authority for the licence and the service
being the officiating minister himself; and the
Act applied equally to the Anglican or
Roman Bishops, to Methodists, Presby-
terians, or Congregationalists, to a Mormon
Elder or a Chinese priest, the term ministers
of religion covering every possible form. The
fee commonly recognised was £3 35., but it
was often £5, while at the Registrar-
General's Office 13s. 6d. would cover all
expense. He had known a minister to ride
120 miles north to meet a couple who had
driven 120 miles south for the purpose, and
to perform the ceremony in the middle
of the bush. (Laughter.) Here it
was sought to make marriage as
easy as possible, while in _ England
the aim secured to be in the opposite direc-
tion. When the Act went home to receive
the Royal assent it was remarked in Parlia-
ment that if a similar Act was in operation
in England many public scandals would be
avoided. (Hear, hear,) A conflict had
occurred also on the question of precedence.
Invidious distinctions had been shown at
certain State levees and other occa-
sions in favour of the Anglican and
Roman Bishops and other ecclesiastics,
by placing their names in one place,
then the Civil servants and Consuls,
and after them the representatives of the
Wesieyan. Presbyterian, Congregational, and
other denominations. The final outcome was
that the method of sending out invitations to
the representatives of the religious bodies
was modified, as also was the manner of
publishing the list of those invited to the
entries. The Congregational body avowed at
the time that it did not seek any official or
public precedence for itself, but simply con-
tended/for the equality of all religions in the
eye, ? of the State as a constitutional right.
(Hear, hear.)
Dr. DALE, alluding to the marriage laws in
the colonies, pointed out that the subject was
givinglrise to discussion in the old country.
The difficulty to be met lay in the fact that
marriage must be regarded primarily in its
civil and legal aspects, and therefore a person
who performed the ceremony was for the
time a civil and legal representative of the
State. Congregationalists at home did not
desire that ministers, by virtue of their posi-
tion in the Churches, should occupy such an
office in relation to the State. Establishment
was one thing and endowment another. If
the whole endowments of the English Church
were taken away next year it would still be
an Established Church, and the clergy would
still hold a certain exceptional relationship
to the State. That exceptional relationship
was occupied by all ministers who in virtue
of their ministerial duties performed the
official functions that'belonged to Registrars.
In the colonies ministers of religion were
accorded a higher position by the State than
a secularist preacher could occupy. Did that
fall in with the principle of equality ?
The Rev. Dr. BEVAN said he wished a
Registrar would attend every marriage at
which he officiated. Some Nonconformists
in England wanted their ministers to be on
the same level with the Church clergymen,
and to take the place of Registrars, but he did
not like that proposal. He was inclined to
think that a minister made a very poor
Registrar. But the difficulty was that ministers
rather felt that if they gave up the right to
act as Registrars for the State people would
go to the Registrar's Office, and they would
lose their three guineas. (Laughter.) In
this matter he felt that they were still keep-
ing up something of a religious Establish-
ment, and were not absolutely in an in-
dependent position as regarded the State.
The argument was very slight, but it was
worth something.
Mr. SPICER said he lately had a discus-
sion in England with a Superintendent of
Registrars on the marriage laws. The Super-
intendent said he hoped the time would soon
come when clergymen in England would have
nothing to do with registration. He men-
tioned to him a number of cases where the
registration had been carelessly done, and
had involved costly lawsuits years after-
wards. Ministers, he said, were not
appointed owing to any fitness for work as
Registrars, and therefore they should never
be allowed to do it.
The Rev. J. J. HALLEY said that the
strictest supervision was maintained in Aus-
tralia over registration, and ministers were
subject to penalties if they failed to send in
the certificates to the Registrar. No diffi-
culty had arisen here. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. G. WIGHT had a short story to tell
about Queensland. He was very interested
in the papers read, and, as far as his expe-
rience went, they were very correct. At the
same time, he thought the state of matters
in New South Wales and Victoria was
somewhat complicated, and scarcely so satis-
factory as might be desired. Moreton Bay
was a portion of New South Wales up till
1859. In 1858 it happened to be his lot
to go to that district, and to take
up his abode in Brisbane. The com-
mittee in London, in sending him out
as a minister, were exceedingly liberal in
every way. He knew at the time that
separation from New South Wales would
certainly take place about the close of 1859,
He was authorized by the committee to do
everything that appeared to him to be right
and proper in establishing a Congregational
Church in the capital of the contemplated


colony. He was told to preach, lecture,
write, and make visits, ana do everything
else necessary to get a Church established,
and he did his best. (Hear, hear.) They
knew the principles on which New South
Wales had been conducting her educational
and Church systems, and some o f them
made up their minds in 1858 that they should
start with two principles, and consent to no
compromise—first, that there should be no
State aid whatever given to the Churches,
either in regard to money or land; and
secondly, that they should establish a purely
national system of education in which
every one could join. (Hear, hear.) Those
ends were accomplished by the first Parlia-
ment six months after the independence of
the colony was proclaimed, and their first
Governor was heard to say that he was ex-
ceedingly pleased that those great and
troublesome questions had been so quickly
settled. (Applause.)
The Rev. J. C. KIRBY, returning to the
marriage question, said it was one of the
greatest moment that would be discussed at
the Conference. It would not be a light
thing to destroy the usage of ages. It
seemed to him that the universal introduc-
tion of the civil Registrar at marriages was
likely to sever the religious rite from the
contract. (Hear, hear.) Their English
brethren had revealed, not so much
a lack of efficiency on the part of
clergymen in England as the growth of
an utter incompetency on the part of the
officers of registration, and therefore he was
less inclined to trust them with the sole re-
sponsibility of marriage. (Laughter.) But
the Registrars in Australia had not been in-
competent. He had known occasions in
which gentlemen had had to pay £lO 10s. as
a penalty because they had not sent in their
certificates properly finished or within the
stated time. It had happened to a great pre-
late. This showed that the Registrars had
strength of mind enough to enforce the law
upon every kind of clergyman, and under such
a law he was not afraid cf ignorant men
being entrusted with the responsibility of
performing the marriage rites. He could see
nothing in Dr. Dale's argument that a
minister of religion should not perform civil
duties. He did not see why he should not
sell stamps or do anything else for the State
if he could earn a few pounds per annum by it.
(Laughter.) In the exigencies of human
society it came about that he was in the con-
fidence of a large number of persons, and
that he had the opportunity of seeing that
marriage arrangements were properly carried
out. Why should he not perform the woik
of registration, if the parties desired it ? He
never made any mistakes in his certificates.
(The Rev. Dr. Bevan—"That shows how
great is the intelligence of the ministers
here." Laughter.) The State showed a
statesmanlike judgment in using their ser-
vices for the carrying out of such an impor-
tant matter. He did not see what there was
to laugh at over the three guineas. People
who received £I,OOO a year salary could
afford to laugh, but if they were out in a
country district with £IOO a year, and did
not know where the new boots were to come
from, they would look upon the money in
another light. (Laughter, and Hear, hear.)
Mr. J. MULLENS could not see why there
should be any conscientious objection on the
part of ministers of religion to accept a civil
office. No payment was in this case made by
the State. (Hear, hear.) It would be a
dangerous thing to dissociate marriage from
religious rites. Ministers in their visitations
often came across people who were living
faithful to each other, but were not married,
and it was a great advantage that ministers
should in such cases be able to offer the
refuge of the marriage rite without the
presence of a Registrar and apart from all
publicity.
The Rev, Dr. ROSEBY thought the subject
had not really much vitality in it. But the
question of State aid to religious denomina-
tions in another form had arisen. In connec-
tion with the Universities of Melbourne and
Sydney there were large sections of State
lands set apart for the purpose of establish-
ing colleges to be affiliated to the Universities
—colleges to be connected with the Churches.
Their own denomination was, of course,
omitted, owing to the fact that no applica-
tion had been made for land. Was it to be
understood as an absolutely fixed corollary
from their principles that they should de-
cline to receive land under such circum-
stances ? He was not clear in his mind. A
conspicuous injustice was done to the deno-
mination by their refusal to accept this
land. Large denominational buildings had
been erected in connection with the Univer-
sity of Sydney on valuable land
that had been given for the purpose.
Would not the Congregationalists suffer
from a permanent grievance if they
insisted on refusing to accept land
under such circumstances? The wonder to
him was, with regard to large portions of
Australia, that Congregational Churches ever
came into existence, seeing how fearfully
they had been handicapped in the race by
other denominations. In this matter of
higher education and the training of
preachers for the denomination they felt
in a most acute form the grievous in-
justice under which they suffered. The
English law laid down as a principle
that there was no wrong without a
remedy. They could not take from other
denominations this land. That was an im-
possible solution. On the other hand, could
they not rectify the injustice under which
they suffered by taking a portion of land for
themselves ?
The CHAIRMAN said the question could not
be discussed. Dr. Roseby might raise it upon
a resolution if he liked later on.
Dr. DALE said he never thought of suggest-
ing that the marriage laws of Australia should
be revised. He only wanted to get informa-
tion.
The Rev. W. ALLEN thought Dr. Bevan
was entirely mistaken in supposing that
ministers upheld the marriage laws as at
present because they desired to get the
fees. (Dr. Bevan—" I was speakiDg only in
my own behalf." Laughter.)
The sitting then terminated.


PUBLIC WELCOME TO DELEGATES
FROM ENGLAND.
In the evening an enthusiastic audience
crowded the Adelaide Town Hall to give a
public welcome to Dr. Dale and Mr. Albert
Spicer, the delegates from England. Tea was
laid in the Banaueting-room and cloakrooms
between 5.30 and 7 o'clock, and was partaken
of by quite 1,000 persons. At 7.30 the meet-
ing in the hall began with the singing of the
hymn, " Forward be Our Watchword" by the
Jubilee Choir, consisting of 250 voices, under
the baton of Mr. C. J. Stevens, and with
organ accompaniment. The President of the
Conference (Rev. W. R. Fletcher, M.A.) was
supported on the platform by the leading
delegates, and also by several prominent
ministers and laymen of different denomina-
tions in the city.
The CHAIRMAN said—We are gathered
together here to-night that we may express
before our Heavenly Father our thankfulness
to Him for all the goodness He hath rendered
to us. We are indeed grateful that He
has enabled us to arrive this evening at
the goal of so many of our hopes
and anticipations—the starting point, we
trust, for fresh work and nobler enter-
E rises. (Cheers.) We are gathered
ere, I say, to thank God for His goodness to
us, and we are gatnered here also in order
that we in this colony and our friends from
the other colonies may unite in giving a
hearty welcome to our friends who have
come from over the seas to be with us on
this occasion. (Loud cheers.) It is indeed
an event to be remembered —the coming of
one like Dr. Dale into our midst that
he may give us the inspiration of his
presence, and may likewise give us
his thoughts touching the great ques-
tions that are interesting us all. We
all remember the visit of our venerable
friend Rev. Thomas Binney—(cheers)—how
much he did in this colony, and how much of
the influence of his words and of his work is
to be found to-day in our thoughts, in our
purposes, and in our institutions. (Hear,
hear.) And with the same spirit as we
welcomed Mr. Binney many years ago, so we
welcome Dr. Dale and Mr. Spicer to-night.
(Cheers.) We in Adelaide welcome them,
and at the same time we give a welcome to
our friends from the other colonies. On this
platform we have one whom I need not
introduce to you. You all know his radiant
countenance, and how it has ofttimes beamed
on an Adelaide audience, and how under the
subtle power of his witching earnestness we
have all been thrilled. I need not even
mention names; you know whom I mean.
(Cheers.) Then we have Dr. Bevan—(cheers)
—and I am sure after once hearing him you
will never forget him. This is a grand
gathering for us, representing as we do in
our Conference the thoughts and the feel-
ings and the aspirations of so many of
these colonies; and I hope and trust
that from these meetings of our Conference
there may go forth such an influence into all
our workings in the colonies for coming years,
that we shall look back with gratitude and
enthusiasm to the work that we are engaged
in at the present time. (Cheers.) It is not
for me to make any further speech. I wel-
come our friends most heartily in your name.
(Loud cheers.) Before we call on Dr. Dale,
I will ask Dr. Jefferis, on behalf of New
South Wales and on behalf of his old friends
in Adelaide, to address you.
The Rev. Dr. JHFFERIS, received with
cheers, said—The Chairman, very much
against my will, has put me forward in this
meeting to speak to you at this early stage.
1 suppose it is because I represent the mother
colony of the group, and moreover, because
I represent a Church that is the mother
Church of all our confederated Churches—
grand old Pitt-street. (Hear, hear.) I have not
lost my allegiance to Adelaide and to the dear
old Church upon the hill; but I am thankful
to say that I am the pastor of dear old Pitt-
street. Now, in the name of our colony I
think I can do what the Chairman has asked
me to do, for Dr. Dale is not to be held
within the confines of a sect or a denomina-
tion ; he belongs to the nation —yea, he
belongs to humanity itself. (Cheers.) And
so in the name of the colony and in the name
of our Churches in New South Wales I do
to-night bid Dr. Dale and Mr. Albert
Spicer a most hearty and, shall 1 say,
an affectionate welcome. (Cheers.) You
know their names; they are well known in
England. The Spicer name is held in high
esteem in the highest mercantile circles in
the world, and Mr. Albert Spicer is the
worthy son of a venerable father whose
name in our Churches in London is one of
the most honoured, and he himself has
already begun to engage in those great
works of usefulness in which the foremost
of our English philanthropists are engaging
today. (Cheers.) I heard him before a
much larger audience than this upon the
platfcrm of the Manchester Free-trad 6 Hall,
giving an address upon the condition of the
working men in London, and those of you
who have read "The Bitter Cry" will be
glad to note that the good work that is being
wrought in London as the result of "The
Bitter Cry" has been very largely added to
by Mr. Albert Spicer, (Cheers.) As to Dr.
Dale, I am sure I need not say a word.
Those of us who are thinkers and theo-
logians, who are in some sense the custodians
of the theological thought of our Churches,
all know, at all events, what a deep debt
of gratitude we owe to him. (Hear, hear.)
We have been sitting at his feet for years.
He has been far away across the seas in the
dear old home, but we have had his books,
and they have taught us principles of the
deepest import. As a philosophical thinker
he is deep and profound, both in his specula-
tions and in the working out of his theories.
But what I admire in Dr. Dale is not so
much that he has given himself to the exposi-
tion of some of the great questions touching
the Christian Church and the doctrines of the
Christian faith, but that in his own sphere as
a pastor and a minister he has set an example
to all the ministers of Britain. Quiet, un-
obtrusive, and humble I know him to be.
He has wrought in such a way as to hold the
affections of one of the largest Churches in
one of the largest towns of the old country.
(Cheers.) Well, now he has come to this


country in order that he may help us a bit,
and I venture to hope that he has come in
order to study us a bit. (Hear, hear.) If he
does not learn something from Australia I
for one shall be grievously disappointed.
Dr. Bevan told us yesterday that thought was
freer in England than it is in Australia. I
don't believe that. (Hear, hear.) He also
said something about problems—that he was
tired of hearing about problems being worked
out. I think they are being wrought out,
and that some of the very gravest problems
that affect the destiny not only of England
but of the world are being wrought out in
Australia. (Cheers.) I remember Sir George
Bowen saying long ago—"Vote by ballot,
household suffrage, the registration of land,
title by transfer —these are as much an im-
portation into England from Australia as
wool and copper." (Cheers.) And I believe
that in the present crisis of the Empire's
history, when Ireland is in that terribly dis-
contented state in which it is now, it is not
Conservative coercion or any number of
Crimes Bills that will settle that question.
(Cheers.) I believe that the statesmen of
England are learning to-day from Australia
that Home Rule, with such modifications as
the position of Ireland as the immediate neigh-
bour of England would demand, is what is
wanted to settle that great controversy.
(Hear, hear.) Upon this and upon a multi-
tude of other subjects touching our national
life I believe Dr. Dale will acquire for himself
a larger measure of knowledge than he
possesses now by studying earnestly and
accurately the free working of the Anglo-
Saxon life in Australia. (Cheers.) As for
our Churches, I hope he will teach us a good
deal. I don't think we are all that we should
be here in Australia in our Churches. There
is too much isolation—partly on account of
the enormous distances between our cities
and our townships; but I do hope that he
will show to us how we may by a wise fede-
ration diminish as far as possible that isola-
tion which has been an outgrowth of .Inde-
pendency, rather than Independency itself.
What we want is communion, intercom-
munion, organic union between the Churches,
so that as one in the Lord we may do the
Lord's work in this great land. (Loud cheers,)
The CHAIRMAN read the following letter,
which he had received from the Rev. Charles
Price, of Launceston, who began work as a
minister in the colonies fifty-six years ago,
and is now the oldest Congregational preacher
in Australasia: —
Launceston, August 17, 1887.
My dear Sir—l have been making prepara-
tion and have been anticipating the pleasure
of being present at the Jubilee of Congrega-
tionalism in South Australia, but I am sorry
to inform you that I must be disappointed,
and must remain at home. Domestic
affliction and other circumstances have led
me to this determination. I have no doubt
it would have been to me an especial
occasion of great thankfulness to meet so
many fellow-labourers as Christians and
Congregationalists. lam now in my sixty-
second year of preaching, and my forty-sixth
year of service in the colonies. I once stood
alone in the great continent of Australia, but
now we have a ministerial host, bless the
Lord ! Ido pray that much of the Divine
presence may be felt in your assemblies, and
that rich blessings may be carried away to
the homes of all who meet. From the oldest
minister, you may say, comes the benediction,
" May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost be with you all." Love to all the
brethren.—From yours in Christ, most
faithfully,
CHAS. PRICK.
Rev. J. C. McMichael, Sec.
The CHAIRMAN called on Dr. Bevan to
welcome the visitors on behalf of the meek
little sister colony of Victoria. (Laughter
and cheers.)
The Rev. Dr. BEVAN, who was also heartily
received, said—lt seemed to me that in the
natural order of this meeting we ought now
to have greeted our friend Dr. Dale. He is
the great personage whom we have all come
to honour. You have gathered these men of
worth and solemn bearing from New South
Wales and other great colonies to welcome
him, and have then invited humble little
Victoria just to wait like a younger child in
the family at your door, to be called in if
required. (Laughter.) Well, we in Victoria
are not unwilling to take a position such as
that. We are the smallest of the colonies,
but the great nations of the world have
always been the small ones. (Hear, hear.)
There is Siberia, for example, and there is
New South Wales. Of course they are not
exactly like each other in temperature, but
they are very like each other in the very
enormous stretch of country which they
cover. (Laughter.) There are the spreading
plains of South America, and there
is your own colony, both of them
famous—for sheepgrowing and other light
occupations of that character. (Laughter.)
But if you want life, and intelligence, and
progress, and culture, you go to Egypt, for
example, or to Athens in the later ancient
world, or to that tight little island in the
northern seas from which most of us come,
and which we love to call our home. (Cheers.)
Now, I must say, Mr. Chairman, that I have
a very soft place in my heart for New South
Wales, because it bears the name of my own
native country, and though 1 believe a large
number of people would like to change the
name, they cannot find any better one. It is
an honourable name, and they had better
stick to it. Any new-fangled name they may
pick up will not be so respectable. (Hear,
hear.) Well, in the name of Victoria—you
all know the growth of the wonderful city of
Melbourne, for if any of the other colonies
possessed Melbourne how they would blow—
(laughter)— in the name of that city,
and in the name of the Congregational
Churches of Victoria, I, too, would give
a welcome to Dr. Dale and Mr. Spicer.
(Cheers.) _ I have received myself
so many kindly welcomes here that the echo
of them has hardly passed away, and it is,
therefore, very pleasing for me to take this
place as a Victorian and Australian. Yes,
an Australian, for I have come here to re-
main, and I don't know of any better country
to which I should bring my children.


(Cheers.) It is a grand country. The climate
—well, I will not speak of it. Our friends
have come from England with awful terrors
of the heat, and the fact is they have been
freezing ever since they came here. (Laughter.)
And one hears nothing at home about Aus-
tralia but stories of drought, and yet here we
have been nearly washed out for the last two
or three months. (Hear, hear.) In spite of
the heat of summer and the cold and wet of
winter, I must still say that this is the best
climate I have seen. There will yet come
over you. Dr. Dale, sunny skies, and you will
feel the heat—a heat that you will endure.
It will make men and women flourish—
(laughter)—not bringing with it asthma and
pestilence and death. Those awful forces
destructive to our life seem not to dwell on
the wings of the wind that comes to this
land, and may God long keep away these
scourges. (Hear, hear.) And here is a
people full of physical strength and vigour.
The Anglo-Saxon will not deteriorate here.
You have only to go and see one of our foot-
ball matches to see that. In the English
cricket-field our men have not been without
their laurels, and upon river and stream they
stand to-dav the champions of the world.
(Cheers.) I don't see any sign of intellectual
decay in this people. Our young men are
beginning to go back to the Colleges and
Universities of the old world, and they don't
come out of the examinations with shame
and confusion. Some of the brightest students
of the last few years have received their
early education in the schools and Colleges of
these colonies. (Cheers.) Here is a land
that is a land of hope, and I think our
friends will find as they go about what I
have found —the brightness that is in this
country. There is always a gladness about
the people. We miss the dim, gloomy, un-
seeking multitudes that gather in the great
haunts of the old world. They are not here.
This land is young, its people is young, and
they have all the strength and vivacity
and hope and gladsomeness of youth—and
long may it continue. (Cheers.) May
the sun ever shine upon sunny faces and
sunny hearts. May this young nation grow
in strength and power, because it grows ever
in all those works of liberty and righteous-
ness by which alone a nation can be exalted.
(Cheers.) And now it would not be becoming
for me to say very much about our friend,
whom we are glad to welcome here. I dare
say I shall have something to say in the way
of welcome when he comes to "V ictoria, and
I want to keep my best welcome for that
occasion, because, after all, the best welcome
must be given in the best place. (Cheers and
laughter.) You may put wreaths and
chaplets, but we will put a crown upon his
head. What they will do in Sydney I don't
know. 1 hope we shall not work him so hard
in Victoria that they will have to put some-
thing else over him. (Laughter.) At all
events he may rest assured that both for
himself and for those loved ones who are
with him, they will always find a warm hand-
grasp and a thrilling heart-throb in these
colonies. (Cheers.) They will find that
this is a people that speak the
English language, and, I am happy
to say, that speak the language without a
twang to it, so that it is pretty pure. I think
it is purer than you will find it at home, for
there you will find all sorts of twangs from
London to Birmingham. (Laughter.) i must
remember that we have not all hailed from
the home country, but that born natives of
Australia are here to welcome our friends.
Don't let us forget the grand object that
brings us together. It is interesting to know
that our Church life begins almost with the
beginning of social life here. You, at all
events, as we in Victoria, find the roots of
your Church life intertwined with the roots of
social and political life. Step by step with
the progress of the nation has been the pro-
gress of our Church. Constantly as the life of
society and the State has advanced, there has
advanced along with it the life of our Con-
gregational Churches. Now, this is a chance
for our principles which the old country does
not afford. We have had, as it were, in
England to inject into the midst of English
life our Congregationalism, and a good deal
therefore of the work of Congregationalism
has been to uudo what others have done, to
place itself in antagonism to forces which we
were compelled to antagonize, and not a little
of the strength and power of our Congrega-
tional Churches have been lost in the
struggle with adverse forces under the older
conditions of the older world. Now, Sir,
we have nothing of that kind here. In the
great race I don't know that we are at all
handicapped. lam not quite sure that we
have not a little advantage, because Con-
gregationalism, whatever it is or is not, lies
along the line of the instincts and the tradi-
tions of these young nations. (Cheers.)
They are democratic nations; Congrega-
tionalism is democratic. They are essen-
tially free nations; Congregational Churches
are essentially free Churches. The ap-
peal in these colonies is to the people,
almost to the people en masse. It is so with
Congregationalism—the essential, necessary,
and absolute democracy of the Christian
Church. Therefore, if we are true to our prin-
ciples and to our opportunities in these colo-
nies, the future of our Churches will be a
very great and noble future. (Hear, hear.)
We are willing to extend a very generous
and fraternal hand to all our sister Churches.
I think I may venture to say that there is no
Church more ready to sympathise and to
unite in Christian service with other bodies
of Christians than a Congregational Church.
Look at such of our service as is set to form.
Take our hymns, for example. I think you
will find that the Congregational hymn-
book represents a larger range of
thought in the hymns used in the
public worship of God than the book
of any other body of Christian people.
If you listen to the sermons preached from
Congregational pulpits—l don't mean to say
that more of them are borrowed thaD are to
be found in other pulpits—(laughter)—but,
at all events, you will find that they touch in
thought and in feeling a larger number of the
utterances from pulpits belonging to other
Churches than will be found elsewhere
in sermon literature. (Hear, hear.)
The Congregationalist is so free and


yet so safe in his liberty that he
is able to admit the influences that come
from other phases of Christian life, and thus
we are enabled to co-operate in work in ways
from which Churches more organized and
more set in their organization than we are
are altogether debarred from taking. The
Congregational Churches, as you know, are
chiefly connected in their foreign missionary
work with the London Missionary Society,
but that Society is not a Congregational
Missionary Society. It does not send out
its missionaries to establish Congrega-
tional Churches, but simply sends them out
to preach the gospel, and to leave people to
choose such forms of Church life as they may
like to adopt. Therefore we have been hand-
in-hand in this work with other bodies, and
although they have slowly dropped away
from us yet in that Society we have shown
that large Catholic spirit until now. (Hear,
hear.) So, while we meet here as Congrega-
tionalists to consider Congregational questions,
I have no doubt that every one of us meet
with the most generous sentiments towards
every other part of the Christian Church, and
with an earnest longing to unite with them
in service for our common Lord. While our
Churches are Churches of liberty, at the same
time they desire to co-operatß with other
Churches in the various Christian objects
that are round about them. (Hear, hear.)
Still we must ever rememoer this point, and
it is one of those matters upon which here in
the life—the fresh life, shall I say the ex
cessively free life—of this young country, it is
important to insist upon, that just in propor-
tion that our machinery is not largely organized,
just in proportion as the machinery of Church
life is delicate and free from what is regarded
as completeness of organization, just in that
proportion it needs to be tenderly and care-
fully worked. Our form of Church life is not
one that could venture to do without a very
high spiritual character on the part of those
who accept it. (Cheers.) In a highly
organized form of Church life some-
times the mere organization will supply
what may be lacking of individual
earnestness, piety, and devotion. Take,
for example, the organization in connection
with our Presbyterian friends. Now it is
quite certain that a congregation of their
Church may sometimes seriously lose in
spiritual energy, in Christian character, in
the force found alike in the pulpit and in the
pew. and yet by reason of the strength which
the Presbytery throws about it, that congre-
gation shall not appear to suffer and the
Church shall not lose much. It is
not so with us in our Churches. The
individual Church that loses spirituality,
that is feeble in the pulpit, poor in the
expression of spiritual life on the part of
its members, that Church is doomed. We
have no organization to sustain it. We can-
not administer any rebuke to either the
minister or the people. We cannot step in
and give it something from the general body
of Congregationalists. That Church must
decline, and as such become a shame and a
weakness and a peril to the life of Congre-
gational Churches. Therefore it "behoves
us to see to the life and the character
which our Churches present. We need
devotion, earnestness, and piety. Don't let
us make our liberty a cloak for licence. It is
all very well to say that we lie along the
lines of the life of this young people. Don't
let us be worldly and yield to the secular
forces round about us. Let us inspire and
energise them. (Cheers.) Congregationalism
as an external form of mere Church organiza-
tion is nothing. All must depend upon the
life and character of those who form our
members and those who occupy our pulpits.
It is their piety, devotion, and nearness to
the Lord that will give strength to the
Church, and if we are to do our duty to
these young nations, stimulating and in-
spiring the better instincts of men, if we are
to take our place in fashioning the life of
this young people and inspiring it with a
high and holy purpose, we must be, whether
as individual members or ministers, faithful
to the Master whom we serve. (Hear,
hear.) I hope this will be the result
of our Conference. It will be a very
poor thing if it runs out into mere
personal grooves—if we come together
and then depart to our respective places and
do not take away fresh inspirations to our
spiritual life. But if the result of our visit
be an increase of energy and fresh impulses to
a better and nobler life then indeed not in
vain will you hold this jubilee, far better
even than the visits of these kindly and
honoured friends, though God knows it has
been cheer and strength to us to see their
faces and grasp their hands and hear
their voices—(Cheers) —better even than
that shall have been the fact
that the Master himself has been
in our midst, and has moved among the
golden candlesticks, and we have felt the
grasp of His hand stronger than ever and
tenderer than ever, holding the stars in his
mighty keeping. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. A. SriCER had a most enthusiastic
reception on rising to speak. He said—lt is
very hard to be able to suitably respond to
kindness upon kindness. My good wife and
myself have now been in Adelaide six days,
and the kindness we have received on
all hands has been simply overwhelm-
ing. From the members of our own and
other Churches, from the delegates from other
countries, it has alike been of the very
heartiest character, and it has been an
immense privilege to me to meet again
friends that one has known in past years,
who have come here to settle and work
among you. (Cheers.) Our reception in the
society of this town has been equally hearty,
and your good Chief J ustice —who has been a
splendid host to us—has set an example of
what North Adelaide hospitality can do.
(Cheers.) Then as one who has been engaged
in commerce for a long time I desire publicly
to thank your business men for the very
kindly welcome they have given me here.
What I have seen here will never fade from
my memory. Dr. Jefferis has referred to a
speech he heard me deliver in the Manchester
Free Trade Hall. I confess that some of the
circumstances attending that speech have
been in my mind since I came here. As I
have gone through your streets and seen


your working men with a look of satisfaction
and happiness on their countenances I could
not help thinking of the very different
sights which I beheld a few months ago.
It fell to my lot to take part in the
reception of the Queen when she opened the
People's Palace in the East-End of London.
(Cheers.) I drove that day through some 4
miles of the most miserable streets in the
East-End, and I shall never forget the hungry,
gaunt look worn by many thousands of the
people that I saw. A few months prior my
wife and I, accompanied by our good friend
Mr. Mearns, to whom we owe " The Bitter
Cry" (Cheers) spent a whole night
in the streets of London. Starting
at the far west, we went through
main streets and side streets, and gathered
together those whom we found without
shelter for that night, and managed to give
them a few hours' rest and warmth and the
comfort of a hot breakfast to conclude with.
(Cheers,) I pray God that we may in time
be able to avert the terrible condition of so
many of our people, and I am sure you will
join with me in the prayer that the time may
never come when you in these great countries
shall ever see a Bimilar sight to
what may be seen at any time
in London. (Hear, hear.) My first
feeling to-night is of profound and heartfelt
gratitude to you for all your kindness. I
seem to feel as if I have a right to be bere,
because when I look over the account of the
Conference in Sydney I find that from that
Conference a vote of thanks was sent to my
dear father as Treasurer for the London
Missionary Society, a post which he held
for nearly forty years. (Cheers.) Therefore,
I do feel that I have no need to be ashamed
of standing on an Australian platform.
(Cheers.) Then in coming to Adelaide I have
another source of pride. I came here a
modest man, but I am not at all sure that I
shall leave it in that state of mind. (Laughter.)
I feel pride in being connected with a Con-
gregational Church. One of the names that
will ever be associated with the true great-
ness of South Australia will be that of Thomas
Quintin Stow. (Cheers.) He came from the
country town of Halstead, in Essex. I, too,
come from Essex, and it is largely due to the
Congregational Churches of that county-
numbering about ninety—that I began to
take an interest in the Congregational
Union of England as well as in the
London Missionary Society. So I feel that
I have an association with Adelaide and the
Congregational Churches here through my
connection with Essex. (Cheers.) Now, I
can imagine that some of our friends are
asking, "Why have you come?" The
simple reason why I am here is because you
invited me. (Cheers.) 1 was told you in-
vited my wife and myself as representative
non - ministerials. I understand that
the word "layman" is objected to,
and as I never heard the word
"laywoman," I think " non-ministerials" is
much better. (Laughter.) Having had the
invitation the Congregational Union of Eng-
land and Wales were good enough to accept
me as one of their representatives, and my
friends in the business with which I am con-
nected being willing to do my work in my
absence I came away. (Cheers.) I have
come here to learn. I ventured in the Con-
ference yesterday to make a simple sugges-
tion, but quickly found that this was
not a place where I could do any
teaching, so I shall not attempt that
again. (Laughter.) I came to rejoice with
you on account of the work you have done
during the last fifty years. I came to share
in your joy, and I trust that the work may
be stronger and better in the future, I came
as a Christian Congregationalist. I have
been brought up, I may say, in the straitest
sect of the Pharisees. I have been, at any
rate, brought up in a Congregational Church,
and I am not ashamed to say that I have
learned to value and love the principles
that that Church teaches. (Cheers.) I love
the fundamental idea that a Church consists
only of a gathering of Christian men and
women—that wherever two or three are
gathered together in Christ's name, there
He is in their midst. I believe in freedom of
action and freedom of management. I re-
joice to think of the strong men and women
which our Churches have produced in the
past, and which I believe they will always
produce. I believe in the advantage
of having individual as well as
corporate work in the Church. I be-
lieve, too, in the power of the
adaptation of a Congregational Church to its
surroundings, (Hear, hear.) I am glad to
find that some of the leaders of the Episcopal
Church in London are stating that their
study of ecclesiastical history leads them to
think that the earlier primitive Churches
were distinctly Congregational. They may
seek to justify the change that has taken
place, but I am prepared to adhere to
the ideal and to strive to copy the
Church as it existed in the days nearest
to our Saviour. (Hear, hear.) There are
two things I should like to place
before my Congregational friends in this
colony. I want to ask you if you are going to
take a deeper interest in future in the work
of winning your own country for Christ. I
ask for more individual work. The tendency
in the old country, I fear, has been to leave
the work of winning souls for Christ in the
hands of our ministers. I can't help thinking
that we have deeply injured our own re-
ligious life and the spiritual life of our
Churches by not realizing sufficiently that it
is our own work as well as theirs. (Hear,
hear.) We must not fail to remember the
high calliDg to which we are called in
Christ Jesus, that trusting in Him we are
sons of God, priests unto God, and that if
our Congregational Church system is to
prove the benefit I believe it can be to those
around us, we Christian men and women in
the Churches must be up and doing in the
Master's service. We are twitted sometimes
in the old country that we Congregational
Churches are much more fitted for the
"respectable" classes—the middle classes—
and that we fail to attract those at the head
of society or those who form the great mass
of the working classes. I quite admit that
we do seem to lose a large number, even of
those who have belonged to us in what may be


called the upper middle class. They say it is
a hard thing for two generations of carriages
to drive up to the Church door. I hope that
day will soon come to an end. (Hear, hear.)
I know very well the social temptations that
come to us; but if we only have faith in
Christ and are anxious to do His will, social
temptations will not lead us away from what
we know to be right. It is said, too, that we
don't reach the working classes. I some-
times think we are not altogether treated
fairly on that ground. The fact is that when
the working classes join us they get in time
such an uplifting not only in spiritual con-
cerns but in their modes of living that we fail
to recognise them as ordinary working men.
1 confess that some of the happiest associa-
tions of my Church life have been with the
working classes of my own district, and in
the town or village in which I have been
residing. (Cheers.) But if the charge made
against us is true I don't blame our ministers
—I blame ourselves. We have not done
our share of the work as we should have
done. We have not been diffusing a feeling of
sympathy and of love to those around us. We
have failed too often in exhibiting the life in
the family and the business circle, and have
failed, therefore, to attract those whom
we should have attracted. I ask you very
earnestly, as representing the non-ministerial
element of our Church, let us see to it that
the coming period of the life of our Churches
finds us more faithful and true to our high
calling. (Cheers ) Again, I would lay a
request before you. I esteem it a very high
honour to be in any way connected with the
London Missionary Society. As one of our
seniors has passed away, I have been called
upon to occupy a much more prominent
position in that Society's affairs than I would
have chosen to take; but as the responsi-
bility has come 1 would earnestly ask
God to help me to fulfil the duties.
(Cheers.) I ask the Australasian Churches
to take a greater share in the conversion of
the heathen than they have done in the past.
I don't say this in a spirit of fault-finding.
We are deeply grateful for the help we have
received in past years, but I think the time
has come when you could take a larger share
of responsibility than you have done. (Hear,
hear.) I have come to the conclusion, after
careful enquiry, that our Congregational
Churches in England are unable to do properly
the work we have in hand in the different
mission-fields which are in connection with the
London Missionary Society. Missionary work
is, after all, a necessary completion to
the Christian life. We are not deserving
of much credit if we care only for those by
whom we are surrounded. We might well
do that for our own protection and self-
interest. But Christ has told us not to stop
there. He has commanded us to go forth
and preach His gospel to every creature.
Therefore, I ask you to take a share of the
responsibility of the work of some great
mission-field. I could say much on this
question, because it fell to my lot a little
while ago to visit the whole of the mission-
fields of our Society in India. (Cheers.)
It was said of the great Napoleon that
his leadership was marked by the entire
devotion and self-abandonment shown by his
soldiers. We serve a far greater General and
Master, and I ask you in His name to rise
to the opportunity and undertake your part
in mission work. It is said that the last half-
century has been largely devoted to the
process of setting free the individual so that
he may perform his own duty. I feel that
those who have gone before us in this country
havs done their duty. Let us, too, arise in
turn. Whatever talents we have must
be exercised if they are to be de-
veloped. Because our fathers have fought
and won, it is for us to be up
and doing ; it is for us in every way that we
can to do God's work, and then we shall have
the satisfaction of knowing that however
feebly and imperfectly we have laboured, we
shall leave the world something the better
for our presence here. (Loud cheers.)
The choir here sang the "Hallelujah
Chorus."
Dr. DALE, who was greatly cheered on
rising, said —lt is iust a fortnight
since the anchor of the good ship
in which I came out from the old
country descended into the bed of the
Derwent at Hobart, and since that time my
wife and child and I have been receiv-
ing the most extraordinary kindness from all
descriptions of people. Those who share
with us the Congregational faith have given
us a most hearty welcome, and men of other
creeds and men of no creed at all have also
received us most generously. I have dis-
covered since I have been on this side of the
world, how deep and how fervent is the
passion that binds your hearts to that great
historic land whose traditions are yours as
well as ours, and whose future, I hope, will
be yours as well as ours. (Cheers,) It is a
great and noble passion which binds the
hearts of men to the land and to the race
from which they spring. It is a still diviner pas-
sion that comes from a vivid consciousness
of kinship with all who have received that
eternal life which is our inheritance in
Christ, and who belong to that invisible and
eternal kingdom which cannot be moved.
(Hear, hear.) You are Christian men and
women : you are one with Christ, and the
life that dwells in Him dwells in you ; and I
venture to hope that the cordiality of that
reception which we have had to-night has
arisen from your conviction that we, your
guests, share that faith which is the spring
of all righteousness and the foundation of
all hope, and that the welcome you have
given us comes from the Christ that is in
you, and is His rather than yours. I thank
you, my dear Mr. Fletcher, and I thank
Dr. Jefferis and Dr. Bevan, for all the
generous words you have been good enough
to speak about me to night, words far too
generous, words which have made it difficult
for me to speak at all. It is two or three
years ago since I received fiom Mr. Searle
the invitation to visit these colonies. I am
glad to see him in this meeting to-night—
(Cheers) —for many reasons, and especially
for this, that he will sustain me when I say
that twice, I am sure, and I think three
times I told him that it was im-
possible for me to come. If the


colony of South Australia ever wants a
Commissioner to send to England in order to
undertake and carry through some difficult
negotiation, I venture from my own ex-
perience of him publicly to recommend Mr.
Searle-(laughter)—for he has the most
original method, so far as I know, of carrying
negotiations through. I told him at length
in writing how decisive were the reasons
which prevented me from accepting his
invitation. He wrote a fortnight afterwards
as if he had not heard from me at all. I
wrote again, reminding him of what I had
already written, and explaining and emphasiz-
ing with what force I had all the reasons I had
adduced for my inability to accept his invita-
tion. I did not hear from him for ten days.
He did not write to say he had not received
a reply from me, buc he wrote as if he had
not received it. (Cheers and laughter.) 1
wondered how I was to dispose of this repre-
sentative of the eagerness and persistency of
the Southern Hemisphere. In my perplexity
I spoke to one of my deacons, and told
him that I had been away from home
for many weeks that year owing to ill-health,
and it was probable that I should be away
for several weeks the next year, adding that
I felt I should not be discharging my duty to
my congregation if I went away to Aus-
tralia. " But," I said, " there is Mr. Searle,
and I want to fortify my position with your
judgment." I assumed as a matter of course
that my friend would stand by me. He
paused and said, " I should not like to
express judgment off
I said, " You don't mean to say it is at all
possible that you think it is my duty to go ?"
He said, "I should like to Ithink about it."
(Cheers.) We have at Carr's-lane not only
deacons, but a noble band' of deaconesses,
who are elected like the deacons are, and who
discharge, and admirably; discharge, many
important functions. We had to meet that
week, and my friend said, " Perhaps you had
better speak to them." So I brought the
matter forward. There was'silence for a bit,
and then the senior deacon said, "It is
rather a difficult and delicate thing for
us to recommend a judgment. If we
appear ready for you to go it may seem
as if we don't value your services." I said,
"You and I have known each other too well
to fear that." (Cheers.) Then he went on
to say that as the Churches in South Aus-
tralia had done me and the Church of which
I am the pastor the signal, honour of asking
me to visit them, he for his own part thought
that the interests of a single Church ought
not to stand in the way of any services I
might be able to render you here. Deacon
after deacon and deaconess after deaconess
expressed the same judgment, and therefore
I had no choice but to go, and here I
am—(Cheers)—trying with all my heart
to discover those elements in the life
of the Congregational Churches of this
colony that shall give me courage and
guidance in my own work at home, and
ready, so far as God maylhelplme, to render
you any slight service that may be in my
power. (Cheers.) I don't think I should
have come, however,'if had
not associated the name of my dear
friend Mr. Albert Spicer with my
own. (Cheers.) His father has won for
himself a great and honourable name among
the Congregational Churches of England, and
the son has already won for himself a
name not less honourable. As a friend
I have cherished for him for many
years past a great warmth of affection and
deep respect; and in one special work—ex-
ceptionally difficult and important —to
which I am attached, the energy, the courage,
the courtesy, and the sagacity and generosity
of Mr. Albert Spicer have given me hope and
confidence, and the establishment of a Con-
gregational College at Oxford will be largely
due to the services he has rendered. (Cheers.)
I accepted the invitation, and almost as soon
as I had done so I began to wonder why I should
come ; and when I look around this platform
to-night my wonder wby I should have come
and why you should ever have dreamt of ask-
ing me is deepened and increased. I can tell
you nothing that you have not been told
already and told many a time by Mr.
Fletcher, Dr. Jefferis, Dr. Bevan, and by
Mr. Clarke, the friend who received me
with such hospitality at Hobart. And
they can speak with a knowledge
of the conditions of your Church life,
which it is impossible for a stranger to
possess. lam more and more conscious of
the immense differences between the condi-
tions under which the Congregational
Churches of this colony are serving Christ and
the conditions under which we are serving Him
in the old country. (Hear, hear.) Just con-
sider for a moment the difference between
the manner in which the soil of England is
crowded and the manner in which the soil of
this great colony is unoccupied. I believe
you have some 900,000 square miles of terri-
tory in this colony, and the population on it
is one-fourth less than the population con-
tained within the boundaries of the Borough
of Birmingham. Nine hundred thousand
square miles in South Australia and vast
territories in the neighbouring colonies, and
taking all the British colonies in the Southern
Hemisphere together you have not among
them, I believe, the number of population
that is to be found within a radius of 10
miles of the post-office in the City of London.
(Hear, hear,) Now, the crowding of the
population in England creates economical
and social conditions of which you know
nothing. A great part of the time and
strength of the best people in our
Churches is devoted to social reform
movements which are unnecessary in
this part of the Empire. I am told you
never see in a primary school a child that
does not show that he is well fed; it may
sometimes be ill-clothed, but ill-fed never.
(Hear, hear.) We were feeding day after
day and week after week in Birmingham last
winter thousands of the children attending
our public schools, and who bore in their
very appearance signs of starvation, and
were unable to learn their lessons because
they were so ill-fed. I heard a Catholic
priest say it was financially worth while
for school managers to buy dinner-tickets
for their children at a halfpenny apiece,
because they would recover the money in the


increased grant they would receive at the
examinations, owing to the children being
able to perform their work in the school
better. That is only one instance of the
immense contrast. Members of our Churches
In England have to devote their services and
means to struggling with the misery that is
concentrated in the great masses of popula-
tion by which we are surrounded. As
I came over from Hobart to this city
the question returned to me again and
again, " How is it that we cannot
transfer to this virgin soil thousands and
hundreds of thousands of English people who
are living a hard life at home, and who here
misrht live in ease, and health, and pros-
perity?" (Hear, hear.) I put it to the Con-
gationalists of these colonies to consider
whether they can, for the sake of their brother
Congregationalists over the sea, initiate
some movement by which they may draw
to these shores men who will increase
the strength and augment the life of
the Congregational Churches of these
lands. You get hundreds and thousands
of men brought to Australia to seek
for gold. Has not the time come for
the Congregational Churches of the colonies
to send the message to the Congregational
Churches of England, " Come over here and
help us to build up a free and noble Church
life." Do this and you will render service to
the God whom you love and relieve your-
selves and others of many anxieties. I
want to see Christian people coming
here in order to add to the Christian
life of the people here, for I say if
your population is to be increased only by
those who are seeking gold, it will not be of
the same benefit as would result from men
coming here to share in your toils, and to lay
the foundation of Churches in these new
lands. (Hear, hear.) You have difficulties
of your own, grave and perplexing enough,
here. It is not for me to attempt to offer
any solution for them. But in all conditions
the Churches of the Lord Jesus Christ exist
for the same great and divine services;
under all conditions they have a
common work for their Master and
for the human race, and at a time
like this, when you are reviewing the history
of the first fifty years of Congregationalism
in this colony, I ask to be allowed to speak
on the graver and more serious aspects of
your Church life. (Cheers.) I ask you to
consider what is the real strength at the pre-
sent moment of the Congregational Churches
in this colony. That strength is not to be
measured by the stateliness of your Church
buildings, for the structure of reed and
wattle which Mr. Stow helped to
build with his own hands may have
answered the divine purposes as com-
pletely as the noble edifice you have
erected in Mr. Stow's memory. (Cheers.)
You cannot measure your strength by the
number of your Church buildings, or by the
size of your congregations, or by the wealth
of your members, or by the consideration and
esteem conceded to your ministers, or by the
influence—to which sometimes I think we
are inclined to attach too much importance—
you are exerting on the public and political
life of "this community. If you are to dis-
cover your real strength you must
go deeper and in a different direc-
tion. Churches exist for the increased
spiritual knowledge and perfection of their
own members. (Hear, hear.) Let me ask
you to discover, one by one, whether, looking
back on your own personal history, it is ap-
parent to you that year after year you have
been reaching a better and better and a
wider and wider knowledge of the
Christian revelation. The gospel is in-
finitely simple and infinitely profound,
and unless the members of a Christian
Church are increasing in the knowledge of
things eternal and divine, it matters not
to me what external signs of prosperity
they are able to point out in their Church
life. (Cheers,) Are you as thoughtful abouc
the great truths of the Christian faith as
your fathers were ? Do the great discoveries
that come to us concerning the thought of
God seem to you as august and wonderful as
they seemed to your fathers? When the
pastorate is vacant and you are think-
ing about electing a minister, is this
one of your first questions not, "Is he
likely to draw large congregations ?"
"Has he humour and fancy?" "Can
he speak with passion and fervour ?"—but
" Is he a man who has been taught of God,
and who will lead us into a deeper know-
ledge of God and of God's will ?" Is that one
of your first thoughts concerning your
minister ? If it is not, then be sure of it that
your Church life is not growing in those
elements which make it acceptable in the
judgment of the Eternal. I will ask you to
consider another question. It is only slowly
that either individuals or communities get
to understand how the will of Christ concern-
ing human conduct is to be actually
translated into practice. The moral ideas
of individual men grow slowly; the moral
ideas of communities grow slowly. Let me
ask you to look back and to consider whether
trie moral standard of the Churches to which
you belong, whether your own personal moral
standard, is higher than it was twenty years
ago. You have been passing through great
commercial vicissitudes during the last two
or three years. Let me ask you to
test your acceptance of Christ as the head
of your secular business by the manner
in which you have endured your troubles.
You know cur theory is that we
are the servants of Christ whatever we are
doing, and, as I have often ventured to say,
no matter what business you are in Christ is
the true head of the firm, and you are work-
ing under Him, It has been His business
that has suffered. Have you thought of your
losses in that aspect? Have you regarded
the disasters that have come upon you as you
would have regarded the disasters that came
upon a firm of which you are not a member,
but simply a servant? Has that been
the aspect under which financial losses
have been presented to you ? And now that
prosperity is returning are you receiving
it, not merely as a pleasing thing for your-
selves, but as something to be welcomed,
because in your business you are the servants
of Christ just as truly as I am the servant of


Christ in preaching the gospel, and because
you desire that the work He has given you
to do should prosper. Let me remind you
that Churches are intended to realize the
Christian idea of a divine society. Christian
life is not an isolated life. It is life in the
household of God. When we are restored
to God we are restored to our
brethren too. Let me ask you
whether it seems to you, looking back
on the last twenty or twenty-five years, that
the particular Church to which you belong
has been growing more N and more like a
household of God —whether heart has clung to
heart with a more fervent affection, whether
life has been bound to life with a deeper and
more tender sympathy, whether there has
been more of joy on the part of the Church in
the joy of individual life, and more of
sorrow in the sorrow of individual life?
Has there been ? These are the ques-
tions which I venture to think determine
whether Christian Churches are making
progress or not. If you can find these you
will think comparatively little of the out-
ward signs of success that may be embodied
in jubilee reports. (Hear, hear.) There is
still another question to be asked. A Chris-
tian Church ought to be a perpetual means of
revelation not only of God's thought but of
God himself to those who belong to it.
That revelation comes in many ways
partly in the public assemblies for
worship and through the preaching of
the minister, partly through the
mutual ministry of those who are
included in the fellowship. I ask you to-
night, in the presence of God, whether God is
as great to you as He was a quarter of a cen-
tury ago, as great as He was to your fathers
fifty years ago. I ask you whether your
vision of His glory has become keener and
keener as year after year has gone by, and
whether your sense of gladness in having
been restored to Him through Christ is
becoming more and more intense. As you
look back over the years and remember
how you have been called away from
all common interests and common excite-
ment and common affairs, week by week, that
you might dwell on the fact that you are
children of the Eternal and heirs of immor-
tality, I ask you how those consecrated days
have told upon your inner thought and inner
life, and whether God in the greatness of His
majesty, in the glory of His righteousness, in
the tenderness of His love, is more to you
than He was to your fathers. My Christian
brethren, unless the Christian Churches are
increasing the knowledge of their members
of Christian truth, unless they are exalting
their ideal of the Christian life, and
unless they are binding together the
hearts of those who through them
desire to glorify God their Father—unless
thev make the invisible glory of God more
real to them than transitory—whatever ap-
parent success you may have you will have
no success that can be called real. And. 1
ask each one of you to pursue the enquiries
to which I have directed you, as in the
presence of God and entreating Him to give
you a knowledge of how it stands with you.
There is another aspect of the life of our
Churches of which I should like to say
something for a few moments. It is
this, that they sustain a relation
to society and to the race. Christian
Churches, as we believe, are founded by
Christ himself. They are not private
religious Societies owing their origin to the
members who constitute them. Unless a
Christian Church recognises the Lord Jesus
Christ as its Founder and Head it loses sight
of the true dignity and glory which
Christ intends it to possess. Christian
Churches are the visible monuments
and memorials of the most glorious
moments in the life of the Eternal
Himself. They exist because the Eternal
Son descended from the heights of
God, moved by infinite pity for the
sorrows and infinite mercy for the
Bins of our race, and determined to
become man and die and rise again for our
redemption. Christian Churches are monu-
ments and memorials of that, and Christian
ministers have to preach that Gospel.
(Hear, hear.) I believe in theology, because
I believe in the functions of the intellect in
relation to things divine. Those who speak
lightly of theological systems disparage the
dignity of the human intellect. (Hear, hear.)
But the preaching of the Gospel is not the
preaching of a theological system; it is
a perpetual testimony to the power
and the grace of Jesus Christ.
As year after year and century
after century pass by it seems to some that
they are being removed further and further
away from the Christ who lived and laboured
and died for humanity in a distant land.
What Christian Churches exist for is that
they may sustain the testimony of the
preacher by their own testimony of the
power and glory of the unseen living Christ
who abides with the Church for ever. Ours
is not merely a tradition. We speak of
Christ and His teachings not only on the
ground that the record has come to us through
remote centuries from the lips and pens of
apostles and evangelists. A Church does not
deserve its name whose members cannot
for themselves say, " Christ, the Son of
God, who became man and dwelt in Pales-
tine eighteen centuries ago, is known to us
one by one. We have been absolved from
sin by the utterance of His own lips, and at
the touch of His hands we have escaped
from the chains by which we were bound,
even as Peter rose at the touch of the angel
and found that his chains were gone."
I ask you in the presence of Him
in whose name we gather, and
who is therefore amongst us, whether you
can bear an original testimony—a testimony
resting upon your own personal experience—
to the love and grace and power of God.
How can you expect the preaching of your
ministers to reach the hearts of penitent men
unless you are able to say to them, " Wo re-
pented of sin, and the Christ of whom you
hear forgave us and enabled us to escape
from its power." How can you expect men
to believe unless you, man after man, woman
after woman, can stand up and say,
" Yes, we ourselves have found God
through Christ. You have no need to trust


to statements written in books eighteen cen-
turies ago. We have seen the face of God
ourselves, for we trusted in Christ to bring us
to His feet." Infinite issues depend upon the
manner in which you answer questions such
as I have put to you. I believe as strongly
as any man in the principles that lie at the
foundation of our Congregational polity. 1
believe in the importance of the Christian
influence that we should exert over the
public life and the political inte-
rests of communities. I believe in
the importance of a confederated
Church, whilst I believe in each Church
maintaining autonomy. But if the Congre-
gational Churches of this colony are to dis-
charge their duty to God and men, none of
these things can help you unless in your own
personal life you are able to bear testimony
to the power of Christ. Every Christian man
has his own story to tell. His life and his-
tory are different from those of his brethren.
Has not Christ forgiven me sins that He for-
gave no other man ? Has He not relieved me
of cares that no other man had? Have I not seen
manifestations of His grace and pity that are
a secret between me and Him, and which
enable me to speak as no other man can
do of what I know He has done and is
still willing to do? During the last few
years there has been a great assault upon the
authenticity of the four narratives which
contain the story of Christ's life on earth,
and the hearts of some Christian men have
been shaking with fear as if the fortunes of
the Church were depending on that contro-
versy. I protest against such an idea. We
have millions of evangelists scattered over the
world who can tell the story of what Christ
has done in their own time and in their own
lives. The genuineness and authenticity of
their story cannot be challenged, and while
they are able to speak the gospel of Christ is
safe. (Cheers.) I have one other question
to ask you. I do it in the spirit of brother
speaking to brother concerning those things
that lie nearest our own spiritual life, and as
affecting the strength 'and glory of the
Christian Church. In a famous creed are these
great words, "I believe in the Holy Ghost."
Will you allow me to ask whether, looking
back upon the history of the Churches with
which you are associated, you can see, during
that period of their ecclesiastical life which
lies within your own memory, clear and
decisive eigne that you and they believe in
the Holy Ghoßt ? Has that faith become an
obsolete tradition ? Has it a place in your
theological scheme, but not a place in
your practical life ? Do ycu ever think of what
happened 1,800 years ago in a company
of devout Jews—how their imaginations
were filled in the glory of a divine manifesta-
tion, how their hearts gave answer to all the
words of trust, and thanksgiving, and hope
contained in the Psalms of David, and how
they became as truly the servants of God as
was Isaiah, or Jeremiah, or Daniel; and they
could see the glory of God lighting across the
past history of their people, and their faith
in God rose high at the historical manifesta-
tions of His goodness and power. And yet
when they came face to face with God in the
person of Christ they did not recognise Him.
Has it never occurred to you that the error
and fault of the devout contemporaries of our
Lord may be repeated in other forms among
ourselves ? Has it ever occurred to you that
our imaginations may be so filled with the
tenderness and the splendour of past mani-
festations of God that we fail to recognise the
presence and the power of the Holy Spirit
who is with us? Yes, those Jews were
faithful to the God who had manifested
Himself to their fathers, but they could not
recognise Christ. And we may be faithful to
the God who manifested Himself in Christ,
and yet be unable to find the Spirit who is
with us. Will you try to determine this
question, whether you believe in the Holy
Ghost ? Suppose the personal Christ, as
Peter and John and James knew Him, were
in Adelaide, or Melbourne, or Sydney, or
Hobart at this hour, working miracles such
as those that He wrought on the shores of the
Lake of Galilee and in the City of Jerusalem,
delivering parables, new parables, as gracious
and as tender as the parable of the prodigal
son, speaking to men in words as wonderful
as those contained in the Sermon on the
Mount; suppose He had been present in
our Conference this morning, and were to be
present in our Conference to morrow, ready
to answer any question that we might pro-
pose to Him concerning our personal life,
concerning the life of our Churches, concern-
ing those great questions over which cloud
and mystery still hang, and which the vision
of sense has been unable to penetrate—would
you believe that that would be a clear
loss to us all if we had to part
with the presence of the living spirit, who is
actually with us, is with you in Adelaide
always, at Melbourne always, at Sydney
always, at Hobart always, who was in our
Conference, as we trust, this morning, and
will be in our Conference, as we trust, to-
morrow ? Try yourselves. Does it really
seem to you as though what you had is really
better than what I have asked you to imagine.
Christ said it was expedient for His disciples'
sake that He should go away, for if He did not
go away the Spirit would not come to them.
Now, I ask you each one to put it to your
own heart whether you believe that the
Spirit of God has been so much to you, that if
it was possible for the personal Christ to
appear where I am standing to-night and to
speak to you through His own lips on condi-
tion that the Spirit returned to the eternal
throne again you would say, " Let the Spirit
remain, and we will wait for the vision of
Christ till by-and-by." Not until we come to
that have we entered into the actual posses-
sion of that which is the transcendent glory
of the Christian Church in our days. I
ask you one by one to appeal to God, as I
desire to appeal to God myself, so to fill you
with the Spirit of God that you shall be able
to say. " I am nearer to God with the Spirit
of God in me than Peter, James, and John
were when they saw the face of Christ and
heard the voice of Christ himself." Don't
pray for the coming of the Spirit. You may
as well pray for the coming of Christ. The
Jews are asking for Him and awaiting Him.
But He has come. People pray for the
coming of the Spirit. He has come; He is


in the heart of every one of you, unless you
are reprobate. What you have to ask is that
He whom we have forgotten, who has been
present with us, the life of our life and the
strength of our strength, should reveal Him-
self. Let this Jubilee Conference end in this,
an appeal to Cod to grant to us, man by man
and Church by Church, this revelation of the
great power of the Holy Ghost. (Cheers.)
I express my hearty concurrence and sym-
Eathy with what has falleD from
>r. Bevan regarding the future of these
great colonies. I suppose we have all
wondered in_ what period of the world's
history and in what land we would have
chosen to live if God had given us the choice
of the time and place of our birth.
Some might have chosen Athens, where
they might have heard the voice of De-
mosthenes : some would have preferred to
have seen Rome in the height of its great-
ness and power; some would have been in
Palestine during the life and ministry of
Christ; some would have lived in Reforma-
tion times, and thought it the highest honour
to have taken part in the struggles of the
Lutherans ; some would have elected to have
been among the early Puritans Let us not
forget that all times are great. To the
sentinel that hour is most real when he mounts
on guard. And you and I must be content
with the position that Christ has chosen for
us. I can imagine a Christian who has an
adventurous spirit choosing this land and this
time, because every man here who is faithful
to his God and country now, may help to
shape the young life of what in a few genera-
tions shall be a great people. (Cheers.) On
you God has placed a trust, the magnitude
and solemnity of which will be measured
centuries hence, as you cannot measure it
now. I entreat you to rise to the thought of
your great vocation, and in coming genera-
tions let it be said that you in your time
served God and your race with the same
temper and the same faith that have been
manifested by those whose memory has been
held dear to all great peoples and have
secured for them the homage and reverence
of many generations. (Loud cheers.)
A collection was made, and the proceedings
terminated with singing and prayer.
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8.
The Conference was resumed at 10.30 a.m.
in Stow Lecture Hall, after a devotional ser-
vice. The subject for consideration was
THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF THE
CHURCHES.
The Rev. J. HILL, M.A., opened the dis-
cussion with a paper on "Attendance at
Public Worship." The paper was of an
uncontroversial character and was chiefly
devoted to pointing out the propriety and the
advantage of a union of the people for wor-
ship. Mr. Hill spoke in enthusiastic terms
of the Temple worship of the ancient Jews,
and considered that in these days the spirit
of adoration was much inferior to that indi-
cated in the Book of Psalms.
"A TRUE RELIGIOUS REVIVAL."—BY REV.
SAMUEL HEBDITCH.
" Surely the Lord is in this place, and we
know it." It is not easy to imagine a scene
more likely to engage the interest and to
secure the presence of the Lord Jesus than
that which this room at this hour presents.
What are we, and what do we here ? We are
the angels, the messengers, of the Churches
met to confer on a question which, in im-
portance, takes precedence of all others,
namely, this—ls it possible to secure, is it
reasonable to expect, for our Churches a
large and abiding increase of their spiritual
vitality? Standing as many of us do in
close official relationship, and as we
all do in deep sympathetic relation-
ship, with them, and having their
interest as our sole object, we may be sure
that He who walks among the Seven Churches
is here, noting with pleasure every throb of
desire, every anxious fear, every hope, every
purpose in the hearts of those who " prefer
Jerusalem above their chief joy."
I shall indulge in no reproaches. He that
pleads for revival is not therefore an accuser
of the brethren. We don't blame a child
when we wish him to become a man. The
sick need sympathy, not censure, even when
the sickness may be their fault. It might be
possible to draw up a heavy indictment,
charging the Churches with sloth, slumber,
worldliuess, and many unfaithfulnesses, but
my purpose is not indictment, but incitement.
I prefer the lure to the lash. I would rather
say, see how good you might be than
how bad you are. Colonial piety, like
colonial produce and colonial manufac-
tures, and colonial art, and colonial manners,
may be compared with English, and we who
have lived amid both are always performing,
often involuntarily, a mental operation of
that kind. But, though useful, it is a risky
proceeding. Few possess the requisite know-
ledge, faculty, or fairness. To attempt to
prove that colonial Christians are inferior to
English Christians would irritate rather than
edify, and would, moreover, be quite beside
the mark, for our question to-day is not
whether these young countries are more or
less religious than the old country, _ but
whether colonial Christians, and especially
Congregational Christians, are what they
might be and ought to be, and what many
voices demand that they should be. The
answer to the former question would be both
yea and nay; to this a unanimous and
sorrowful No!
A true religious revival must in its idea, its
motive, its method, and in its discussion,
rest on truth. Let me mention a few pos-
tulates.
Religion is, in its root, spiritual life, that
mysterious, precious element which is im-
parted by the Holy Spirit, which is the Holy


Spirit, the seed of Qod, and which differences
its possessor from th a dead world. Funda-
mental to the very conception of revival is
this, that spiritual life in man, not in God, is a
variable quantity. It admits of increase and
of diminution. There may be more or less in
this Christian than in that, in this Church
than in that, in one century or decade or day
than another. There may be more of
it in the same person at different times,
or less. We may grow or wither.
Its originator, restorer, sustainer, consum-
mator is God. Whatever the media God is
the source. Regeneration is His gift; revival
is His gift—the gift of His love. The limit
of the bestowal is therefore not in Him but
in us. His will is our sanctification. His
ideal for us is "the image of His Son."
"Grow in grace," " Abound more and
more," " Be ye perfect," " Be ye holy, for I
am holy," " Filled with all the fulness of
God." The gift of His only begotten Son
and of the Holy Spirit, the various incite-
ments of the Word, the endowments and God-
prompted work of the ministry, and the
whole machinery of Providence, working as
it obviously does towards sanctification,
show not only the existence, but the
strength, the seriousness, and energy of
God's will that we should be holy.
Any reluctance on God's part, any
indifference, any arbitrary restrictions, any
delays, any needless conditions, are incon-
ceivable. Show these to exist and you prove
against God the charge of insincerity, hypo-
crisy, and mocking cruelty. If God is not
willing to increase our spiritual life, then the
Bible is a hollow profession, soundiDg brass
and a tinkling symbal, a cynical heart
borrowing the tongue of love. Show God
unwilling and you cancel every promise, you
paralyse effort, you quench desire and make
prayer the dismal cry of slaves to iron-
hearted power which could relieve, but
cares not to do so. " He is able, He is
willing," is the axiom of axioms in the
philosophy of revival.
Able and willing is He ? Why then is
there not revival ? Why does not the River
of Life fulfil Ezekiel's prophecy, rolling on,
deepening, broadening, till it has done for
the moral world what the Nile has done for
Egypt ?
Infinite Power and Infinite Love —cannot
these two mighties at once revive the Church
and save the world? The voice of sixty
centuries answers No! Not unnecessarily
has the history of this fallen world been
drawn out already through six millenniums.
How many more must pass before it becomes
a holy world depends not on any absolute
decree of God, but on the measure of the
Church's intelligence and faithfulness in
coming within the conditions of the promise.
Power and love alone are inadequate; led
by wisdom they prevail. Christ is " the
power of God and the wisdom of God." The
aspect of human redemption which will most
profoundly impress the non-human intelli-
gences of the .universe, when they come to
know of it, is the display it makes not of the
power or the grace, but of the wisdom of
God. (Eph. iii. 10.) God is as much in the
plan of salvation as he is in the fact of salva-
tion. It is the highest plane of divine ac-
tivity, and " here the whole Deity is known."
Probably in nothing has the Church been
so much at fault as in its failure to appreciate
the method of the divine working in the
spiritual sphere. Not that we can compre-
hend it. "It is not for us to know the times
or the seasons which the Father hath put in
his own power." If Jesus was content not
to know what the lather saw fit not to
reveal, we must neither wonder nor com-
plain. Of the work of the Spirit it is ex-
pressly said that it is at least as mysterious
as the ways of the wind. There is much in
revivals not contained in our philosophy.
The phenomena they sometimes exhibit have
perplexed the ablest thinkers both in
psychology and theology.
But enough is known both in Scripture
and in fact to furnish, if not a complete philo-
sophy, a rational basis of procedure and ex-
pectation. In the direction and application
of His saving power God observes a certain
order which His wisdom has laid down. It is
now plain that 4,000 years were not too many
to bring the world into the condition most
suited to the advent of Christ. " When the
fulness of the times was come, God sent forth
his Son." Not less strictly was the time
of the coming of the " other Comforter"
marked. " Tarry ye in Jerusalem till
ye be endued with power from on
high." The descent of the Spirit took
place " when the Day of Pentecost was
fully come." And why not sooner? Why,
now that the Lamb was slain which took
away the sin of the world, should the world
wait even fifty days or five days for the
quickening Spirit ? " The Spirit was not
given, because that Jesus was not yet glori-
fied." "If I go not away the Comforter will
not come to you."
We see then that God, whose will is that
all men be saved, waited many centuries till
the world should come into the fit con-
dition, and that when the fit condition was
presented and the advent had taken place,
He again waited till certain other events
should take place before He sent the Spirit,
both in fulfilment of ancient prophecy, and
therefore in accordance with a divine pur-
pose and plan. Love and Power received from
Wisdom the signal for action. The advent of
the Son of God for incarnation was one
historic unrepeatable event. The advent of
the Spirit was also a historic, dispensational
event, but is not, like the incarnation, unre-
peatable. Some days, perhaps weeks, after
Pentecost, the company to whom Peter and
John reported themselves prayed, and "were
all filled with the Holy Ghost." Later still,
at Cesarea, in a Gentile's house, the same
thing happened. Reporting the conversion
of Cornelius, Peter said, "As I began to
speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us
at the beginning." Paul's evangelistic tours
were "in the power of the Spirit of God,"
and almost everywhere, as at Thessalonica,
His " Gospel came not in word only, but also
in power and in the Holy Ghost." The pro-
mise was fulfilled. "When He is come (to
you) He shall convict the world."
On what conditions steam, electricity, and
certain chemical forces will act is well


known, and careful compliance is always
followed by action. We never expect and
never get the action without the conditions;
never steam without boiling; never the
electric current without the circle; never the
harvest without seedtime. Neither must we
expect the Spirit except after those antece-
dents which Scripture and experience show
to be the divinely appointed conditions.
To these, to these, let Christians turn their
attention ; these, so far as they are respon-
sible for them, let Christians provide. They
will never be dispensed with, _ never be
changed. God's wisdom has ordained them,
and His infinite love waits their pleasure,
waits and weeps, not because of the condi-
tions, but because they might be offered to
its longing, and are not. How interesting is
the promptitude of natural action! How
instantly water takes the lower level, how
readily fire embraces the added fuel, how
vigorously the released balloon ascends, how
generously the suspended moisture of the
air descends in rain as soon as the condensing
temperature is felt. Equal constancy and
promptitude wait on the sequences of the
spiritual sphere. Not heavier is the
pressure of the ocean on its bed than is the
Eressure of the love of God against all the
arriers which prevent it from reaching and
saving men. Take them away and it will
rush in where it has so long wished to be.
I have spoken much of conditions. What
are they ? They are few, and simple, and
obvious to every thoughtful reader of the
New Testament. The Lord Jesus limits the
functions of the Spirit in a few very instruc-
tive sentences. He shall not speak of him-
self, i.e., from himself. He is com-
missioned ; his theme and his work are pre-
scribed. "He shall receive of mine and
show it unto you. He shall glorify me.
He shall guide you into all the truth. lam
the truth. He shall bring all things to your
remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
you." "We all beholding as in a glass the
glory of the Lord are changed into the same
image, from glory to glory, even as by the
Spirit of the Lord," The substance of all this
is that to repent, to be converted, to be
recovered, to be revived, to be sanctified, to
be saved, we have but to know Christ. He
is the power of God. From Him proceeds
the attraction which will draw all men, the
transforming influence which will make all
men beautiful and glorious. We shall be like
Him when we see Him as he is. Ah, yes,
when we see Him! Who does see Him?
Who has eyes amid the mists and confusions
of this world to see Jesus? Here lies our
whole difficulty, and here is the place and
work of the Spirit. So important is it that
we should have some vision, some clear image
of Christ before us, that in addition to the
historic record of His life and teaching, and
in addition to the preacher's fullest setting
forth of the same, God has, after long
promise and preparation, sent the Spirit.
The Christian character, which, when
matured, will probably be the most beautiful
and splendid object, next to Christ, that God
has ever presented to the admiration of the
universe, is the product of three main factors
<—Christ, the Truth, and the Spirit. These
are the quickening power to impart life, the
uprooting power to eradicate sin, the cleans-
ing power to sanctify, the light to fill the
understanding, the fire to kindle the affec-
tions, the power, in one word, to make us the
sons of God. In redemption the First Person
in the blessed Trinity has given the Third to
reveal the Second, that through the Son we
may know the Father.
This is the settled order. " No man cometh
to the Father but through the Son, and no
man can say that Jesus Christ .is Lord
but by the Holy Ghost." Here, then, is the
first condition —Christ must be presented.
That by which the Spirit moves and re-
news men is Christ; not an ideal
Christ, not a Christ of his imagination,
nor of ycurs, not the Christ of the writers of
"Lives of Christ" —Strauss, Seely, Renan.
No, nor of Neander, Lange, Ellicott, Geike,
or Farrar, but the Christ of Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John, of Peter, Paul, James, and
Jude. That is the Christ who is the power of
God and the wisdom of God; that is the
Christ whom alone the Spirit acknowledges
and shows. The things of Christ which He
receives and reveals are the things written in
the New Testament. While Peter was
preaching this Christ at Jerusalem and at
Cesarea the Holy Spirit came. The testimony
of revivals is this: Preach Christ; do your
utmost to set forth the mind of God towards
men as uttered in this Logos, this " Word,"
and the Spirit will not fail you. Hearing
Christ thus preached He says, " Now is my
occasion; I must be there." If you ask why
thus limit Himself, why attach Himself to
the preacher or teacher and wait their
pleasure for His occasion ? Why does noc the
Divine Spirit show the Divine Christ to the
soul without book or preacher ? 1 can only
say—Here is wisdom ; so has the wisdom of
God ordained. Rather than depart from this
order He protracts human history and lets
the isles wait and wait very long for His law.
How easily, we might think, the übiquitous
and Living Spirit, without waiting for ex-
plorer or for missionary, could touch into life
and salvation the nations of mankind. No !
Jesus says—"He shall convict the world of
sin because they believe not in Me," and how
can they believe in one of whom they have
not heard? Salvation and the sin against the
Holy Ghost —the highest and lowest human
conditions —both require the gospel. You
must know Him to believe on Him and to
reject Him. " The Sword of the Spirit is the
Word of God." " The words which I speak
they are spirit and they are life." The Spirit
only can give life to man, but the full true
word about Christ is the system of nerves
along which the life runs and in which it
dwells. Let Christ shine full orbed from the
pulpit, and you will see a spring-like budding
and blossoming in the pew.
But there are certain secondary conditions
also which cannot be dispensed with. We
must accept the divine order ; our pride and
self-importance and self-dependence must all
go down. We must really believe and own,
which some of us are farther from than we
think, that the planting and the watering
only are ours, and are very inferior func-
tions. The increaser is God. Paul and


Apollos, and, d fortiori , we, are " but minis-
ters" —are "nothing." In all true revival
this humility has appeared, and usually
before.
TWo men stand facing each other, both
making the same Christian profession. One
is full of the Holy Ghost, the other empty-
nay, "Satan hath filled his heart." What
was the reason? Peter was obedient, Ana-
nias was self-willed. God gives "the Spirit
to them that obey him." In vain do we hope
for any increase of the Spirit in us if we are not
all round and through and through obedient.
There is a loose way of speaking of the
Spirit as if the will of man were as much
under his control as the understanding, the
memory, or the affections, and Dr. Drum-
mond's theory of the identity of natural and
spiritual law favours the dangerous opinion.
It is true that God works in us to will and to
do of his good pleasure, but he works always
in accordance with His own laws. In the
will of man we meet with a unique element,
a thing sui generis , of the speciality of which
God himself takes full account. The will of
man is the point at which God encounters a
limit to the range of His action. Jesus could
do no mighty work in Nazareth because of
their unbelief. In the gift of the Spirit He
comes as near to absolute control in the
spiritual SDhere as His own self imposed limits
permit. But He stops short of compulsion.
All the great salvation may come near, but
it pauses at the will of man for assent or
refusal. You may say no. You may hear Him
who stands at the door and knocks, and you
may not open. At that point your consent is
essential. Withhold it and for you Christ is
dead and the Spirit is given in vain. " There
is a sin unto death."
The opposite use of our freedom is neces-
sary in revival. If there be any point along
the whole frontier of your relations with God
at which there is antagonism—any duty you
will not do, any sin you will do, any doubtful
matter you will not settle, any controversy
between you and God —the Spirit's way to
your heart is barred. Entire surrender is
therefore indispensable.
When we disclose our wants in prayer
May we our wills resign ;
Let not a thought our bosoms share
Which is not wholly Thine.
Not consent only, but vehement desire is also
a condition. The interests involved in the
coming of the Spirit are so many, so vast, so
momentous, that anything less than the
whole heart in seeking it proves that the
heart is not in it at all. Some things must be
desired warmly or not at all. If you don't
love don't marry. If you don't desire her
with your whole heart don't give her a hint.
And if you would obtain the Spirit, whose
symbol is the rushing wind and the burning
fire, whose worth to us is to be measured by
the precious blood of Christ, and whose
presence in us is our only fitness for and title
to heaveD, do not ask for Him with the lips
only. " Blessed are they which hunger and
thirst after righteousness; they shall be
filled." "As the heart panteth after the
water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee,
0 God." " I wait for the Lord more than they
that watch for the morning." The agony and
bloody sweat of Gethßemane justify and
demand the utmost energy of desire. The
fit expression of desire is prayer. The Spirit
is the Fatherly acknowledgment of the filial
cry (Luke xi. 13). Prayer should be a great
and serious business, a solemn preliminary.
The Saviour has bound the gift to prayer
and prayer to the gift—"l will pray the
Father and He will give you another com-
forter." Prayer preceded the first Pentecost,
and the second, and the third. If there is
any one lesson taught by the whole history
of revivals it is that they have begun and
continued in prayer. Literally the praying
of two or three, yea, even of one, has been in
some cases the precursor of revival; but
it must be persevering. It was at the
seventh time that Elijah's servant saw the
cloud no bigger than a man's hand which
was followed by an abundance of rain. It
these conditions be observed others will not
be wanting, viz., expectation and prepara-
tion. We shall be looking for the little
cloud. We shall be observant of ourselves
and others in the hope of discovering the
beginning of the longed-for blessing. And
we shall hold ourselves in readiness for the
sharper conflicts with sin, the severe self-
denial, the more extended labours, the over-
sight and care of enquirers, and other de-
mands on our fidelity which revival may bring.
I have purposely been silent on the dis-
tinction between the two departments of
revival—the Church and the world. Revival
properly belongs only to the Church. But,
never yet has the work stopped there. Wake
up the Church and her voice is heard, her
action is seen, her influence is felt. When
the Spirit came to the praying assembly the
news soon spread, and the same day there
were added to them about 3,000 souls. Don't
trouble about conversions. The living Church
must grow. When He is come to you He
shall convict the world. Our task is simple.
On the appointed lines let us seek a large
increase of the faith and love and Christ-
likeness of Christians. Let us seek revival
where life is, and we shall speedily see life
also where now it is not. I close by present-
ing a few motives to the using of these indi-
cated means. Desire ! Vehement desire!
My soul burns within me when I think of the
reasons there are for seeking a holier con-
dition for our colonial Churches. What shall
counteract the mischiefs and destroy the
memory of the scandals of the past?
What will compel the scoffer to with-
draw his finger of scorn, and to cease
to mention names which we blush to hear?
What will remove that widespread, deep-
seated, oft uttered suspicion of the sincerity
and goodness of the great bulk of professors
of religion which you can read in the face of
thousands and detect in almost every issue
of the secular Press ? What will secure the
peace, order, and good government of our
Churches, their expansion and multiplica-
tion ? What will save them from the evils of
isolation and the suicide of an exaggerated
independency? What will protect them
against the discouragement of numerical and
financial weakness, and the perils of the
many little egos which trouble all, and
especially little Churches ? What will give to


the Congregational Churches in these colonies,
restricted, dispersed, feeble as many of them
are, the cohesion and common interest which
alone can secure their own self-respect or the
respect of others, or save their principles
from discredit and even disproof? What
will give us aggressive power, a voice to con-
vince, a hand to lead, to gather, and to hold
those that are without? What will secure
for us a balance, a preponderance of in-
comers over outgoers—the perpetuity and
predominance of our Church system ?
More urgent questions might be asked.
What will furnish the necessary counterpoise
to the democratic spirit so perilously affecting
all religious, domestic, and social institu-
tions, and so seriously endangering the
virtues of modesty, gentleness, reverence,
sympathy, and charity ? What will give the
necessary guarantee that the democratic
spirit will not run into the extravagences
and excesses and social chaos into which it
has hurried more than a few of the peoples of
the world ? What will supply the lubricating
and attempering influences which prevent
friction in the discussion of the hot
questions which are fast demanding
settlement in nearly every country of
the world, and notably in the colonies?
What especially will bring to a conclusion
the long controversy between faith and un
belief, furnishing an answer to those
who charge Christianity with want of
evidence and want of adaptation to the age ?
When will men cease to deny the divine
origin and character of the religion of Jesus?
What will arrest the reaction against dog-
matic theology before it has reached the
point where truth is cast away, if that point
be not reached already ? What will save us
from the loss of the great doctrines by which
Christianity fought her way to pre-eminence
and which alone can maintain her there ?
The faith once delivered to the saints is
honeycombed with doubt. Things surely
believed once are not surely believed now.
Men hold loosely what once they held firmly.
I fear that a very large proportion of the
Christian Revelation is doubted of by thou-
sands who have not ceased to attend Chris-
tian worship. An easy-going, flabby,
invertebrate theology which sees nothing
alarming or very culpable in sin, no neces-
sity for or reality in atonement, no need
of conversion, no obligation in creeds,
and no advantage in Church-fellowship,
and no essential distinction between Church
and world is, I am persuaded, creeping like
a paralysis over the mind of the age, and is
touching with its chilling finger the heart of
many of our young men and young women
also. Let this go on and all missions will
die out, all zeal will cool, and a Sadduceean
coldness will settle upon us, turning Christian
society, the beauty of life and activity, into
ths waxen and ghastly stiffness of a
Tussaudean exhibition.
What, 1 ask, is the meaning of all this ?
What does it call for ? What is the remedy ?
I answer, " A true revival of religion." Give
us again the Church of the past age when
the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy
Ghost; when, shown by the Spirit, Jesus
absorbed the interest, fired the imagination,
commanded the life, trnsformed the cha-
racter, and gathered communities with
whom old things were passed away and all
things had become new. Give us Churches
that are worthy to be called Churches of the
living God ; give us a Christian people who
shall live the New Testament life, walk in
love, crucify the flesh, overcome the world,
shine as light and exhibit the image of
Christ, and you will give the age the one
thing it wants, the one answer to its scep-
ticism, the one safeguard against its perils,
the one refuge from its cares, the one Aye for
its many Nays, the one good for its many ills,
the one hope for its deeping despair.
Any one who will consider these things will
be constrained to cry mightily, "0 Lord, revive
Thy work." "Oh, that thou wouldst rend
the heavens; that thou wouldst come
down." My comrades in the ministry, will
you deem it unfit in me to ask you to suffer
the word of exhortation? Me, who need it
more than you, who am perhaps more
oppressed by a sense of difficulty and failure?
The initiative in this solemn business rests
with us. I know that the great awakening
in America in 1857 began with the spon-
taneous turning of the lay mind to the
lessons of the commercial crisis through
which the States had passed. The shepherds
did not in that instance go before, but
followed the flock. And God is not tied to
gown and bands. He may again humble us
by causing enlargement to come from another
quarter. But surely on us the primary
responsibility rests. We profess to be sepa-
rated unto the gospel, to be spiritual teachers,
leaders, examples. Should not the first
signal be given, the first movement be made
by us ? Have not our people a right to ex-
pect it? Does not our Divine Lord require
it? We cannot give our account with joy;
we cannot claim to have made full proof of
our ministry till we ourselves have complied
with the conditions on which we teach ethers
to expect a fuller baptism of the Spirit, nor
till we have done our best to bring our people
into the same position. Is it not reasonably
probable, is it not certain that if we were
more spiritual our people would be more
spiritual ? Would not every real advance
which we make reappear in them? When
Moses' face shone with his own nearness to
God he called, and Israel also came near. A
warm pastor and a cold Church, a pastor
within the veil and his Church without, a
spiritual pastor and a secular Church, a con-
secrated pastor and a selfish Church are
anomalies, if ever seen, seen only for a short
time. Assimilation is rapid. What we are
they soon become. Verbum sat sapienti.
The Rev. J. WALKEK said that most of the
listeners had expected that the emphasis of
Mr. Hill's paper would have been on the
word " attendance." They had been stirred
and moved by his address, but it contained
nothing to provoke discussion. It struck him
that Mr. Hebditch's paper did not touch the
real case exactly. They had been accused of
having less sympathy with revivals than any
other Protestant denomination. He was
neither prepared to deny nor to concede
that. But was there not a feeling that
they with their democratic principles


and other things that should put them in the
very forefront of Protestant Churches, were
failing to touch deep springs in the hearts of
the people, and were failing to do very
important work that they were better able
to do than any other sect ? Was it not a cause
of pain and shame that they saw so little
revival in their congregations ? What agencies
were they to set at work in order that
Congregationalism should become synony-
mous not only with freedom but with
intensely aggressive effort from Christ?
He regretted that their non-ministerial
men generally did so little. (Hear,
hear.) In his Church he had a staff of
nineteen lay preachers, who supplied six
branch Churches. (Hear, hear.) His faith
in professional revivalists had been very
much shaken during the last few years. He
would like the ministers to exchange pulpits
sometimes. They must face the question of
aggressive Christian work if they were to
make progress in the colonies.
Ths Rev. G. CLARKE thought it might be
dangerous to seek to transfer the associations
of the ancient Temple of Israel to their own
places of worship. (Hear, hear.) Their hymns
had too many references to the Temple. Their
places of meeting were very different from
the Jewish Temple, and by an unguarded use
of such language they might tend to promote
the sacerdotal theory against which they had
to fight; for in a building of the kind there
must be an altar, a priesthood, and other
details of Temple worship. (Hear, hear.) He
hoped the whole body of ministers would
clear themselves of the charge of having any-
thing to do with the pitiful means resorted to
sometimes in order to crowd the Churches.
If they could not attract people by a lively
and earnest presentation of the gospel they
had better have done with the work. (Hear,
hear,) The members of congregations should
feel it incumbent on them to seek to per-
suade non-churchgoers to attend a place of
worship. Their advice would be taken in a
than the advice of persons who
were regarded as occupying a professional
position towards the Churches.
The Rev. Dr. ROSEBY thought the papers
contained rather, much f laudation of the
olden times. The pi icid, 'passive, "and uni-
form appearance of religious life sometimes
in past ages was distinguishable ; from the
highly differentiated individualism of the
present time. They had to utter a message
to their own brethren of their own time, and
to do that effectually they must be in the
fullest sympathy with the thought and the
restless activity of the present generation.
He was disposed to believe that more of the
spirit of Christ was manifested by men in
this last quarter of the nineteenth century
than had been ever before seen (Hear, hear.)
The Rev. Dr.BEVAN agreed with Dr, Roseby
that there never was a time in the history of
the world when the spirit of Christ was more
clearly manifest in the world. He ridiculed
the idea that religion was less thought of by the
cultured classes, and quoted statistics to show
that in America the proportion of University
students who were members of Churches was
higher now than it ever had been before.
Churches should see that revivals came from
within themselves, ami should not rely u. on
receiving benefit from the preaching of
travelling evangelists. (Hear, hear.) Other
speakers attributed the falling off in the
attendances at Church on Sunday evenings
to the increasing interest bestowed upon
religious periodicals, and to the worries of
week-night meetings causing men to desire to
stay at home with their families,
OPINIONS ON CONGREGATIONALISM.
At 1.30 p.m. tne company adjourned to the
Town Hall Banqueting room, where a sub-
stantial luncheon was provided them by
Messrs. Bricknell Brothers. After the re-
past the PRESIDENT submitted, as a senti-
ment, "The Co-workers of Other Christian
Churches." (Applause.) Canon ANDREWS,
in reply, expressed his warm sympathy with
the Congregationalists in the celebration of
their jubilee. Speaking only for himself,
although he was an Episcopalian, and
believed God's work could be thoroughly
done in connection with the Episcopal polity
—(Hear, hear)—he had great sympathy with
that particular view which was represented
by his Congregational brethren. At any rate,
he thought that as to all external matters
connected with Church government, and he
thought he might use the expression Church
polity—without touching on the question of
priesthood—all those matters were as the
small dust of the balance compared with the
great evangelical truths which Dr. Dale had
addressed them upon on the previous evening.
(Cheers.) The Rev. S. KNIGHT also replied
to the sentiment, and remarked that whilst
Congregationalists had the largest freedom,
they seemed to have the least divergence from
the Christian teachings. It was another
instance of the truth that if we trusted human
nature human nature was trustworthy. He
paid a tribute to the achievements of Dr. Dale.
Subsequently the company adjourned to
the grounds outside Stow Church, where they
were photographed by Mr. R. S. Stacy. The
blacks who were in camp near the Old Exhibi-
tion Building visited the Lecture Hall after-
wards for the entertainment of the company,
MISSIONARY ORDINATION SERVICE.
A very large congregation attended Stow
Church on Thursday evening to witness the
novel ceremony of the ordination of a
missionary agent for New Guinea under the
direction of the London Missionary Society.
The Rev. S. Hebditch presided, and was sup-
ported on the platform by all the leading
delegates from England and the colonies.
Service began by the congregation, led by the
choir, singing the hymn " The Son of God
goes forth to war," after which the Revs. W.
R. Fletcher and J. C. Kirby read portions of
Scripture. Prayer was offered by Mr. Heb-
ditch.
The CHAIRMAN read a telegram of con-
gratulation from Rev. J. P. Sunderland, of
Sydney, who for thirty years had represented
the London Missionary Society in the Aus-
tralian Colonies. He mentioned that Mr.
Sunderland's duty was generally to maintain
as far as possible their connection with the
London Missionary Society and their zeal in
the work. Originally it was intended that the


missions in Polynesia should be handed over
to the Australian Colonies as soon as they
could pay the cost. In order to carry out this
intention it would be necessary to raise about
£17,000 per annum, which at the present
moment could not be done. Mr. Miles Moor-
house, who was to be ordained on that
occasion, would be the pioneer missionary to
New Guinea from Australia, and this would
be the first time that a missionary working
under the London Missionary Society would
be ordained in the colonies. Mr. Moorhouse
was a_ young man possessed of good health,
and his name would be associated in future
with the names of Chalmers, Lawes, and
MacFarlane—all noble workers in the island
of New Guinea. The matter of allowing
ordinations to take place in the colonies had
been frequently before the Board of Directors
in London as the result of a resolution
passed by a Conference in Sydney four
years ago, but the power had now
been granted, and was to be exercised
for the first time that evening. The idea
had been to form committees out here to
examine candidates, and to forward their
opinions regarding them to the Board in
London, who, if satisfied, would accept the
candidates as their agents. The same powers
were granted in regard to Christian women.
It was not for want of candidates or for
lack of mental and spiritual qualifications on
their part that women had not gone from
Australia There was a lady in the audience
that night who would willingly go and die
in the mission-field only the doctor said she
had better stay at home. In ordaining Mr.
Moorhouse they did not consider they were
endowing him with any additional powers to
those he already possessed. Ordination did
not differ very much from recognition. It
was fit that he should go forth with the en-
dorsement, the encouragement, and the
stimulus which a service of that sort could
give him.
Mr. A. SPICER said he took it that the
reason why he had been asked to put the
usual questions to Mr. Moorhouse on behalf
of the London Missionary Society was simply
out of compliment to that Society, of which
he had the honour of being Treasurer. Many
earnest discussions had taken place in the
Boardroom in London before they took this
step in direction of Australia—home rule
for foreign missions, fle sympathized with
the step from the outset, because he believed
that they would never interest Australasian
Churches in foreign missions by simply ask-
ing them for money. It was only when they
asked them to give their men and
women to go forth into this divine service
hat they could really create the enthusiasm
that they wished to create in these colonies.
The difficulty in the way of the Australian
Churches takiDg over the Polynesian Missions
was not so great as the Chairman supposed,
because out of the £17,000 expended a sum of
£5,000 was set apart for missionary vessels,
and was provided by children's offerings, so
that the Churches in Australia would only
need to provide £12,000 a year. He con-
cluded by asking Mr. Moorhouse the usual
questions as to his personal piety, his call to
the ministry, his Christian belief, and the
purpose he entertained in undertaking
mission work.
Mr. MOORHOUSE replied co the questions at
length and in a manner which proved very
acceptable to the audience.
The Rev. J. HILL, M.A., followed with the
ordination prayer.
The Rev. J. KING, of South Melbourne,
delivered a charge, as follows: —Christian
brethren, before beginning the charge I have
been asked to deliver this evening I would
like to remind you that this ordination ser-
vice testifies in a very practical way to the
value of such Intercolonial Conferences as we
are holding this week in Adelaide. At our
first Conference held in Sydney in 1883 a
paper was read upon the subject of Austra-
lian candidates for foreign mission work,
and a resolution was passed asking the
L.M.S. to empower the Congregational
Churches of Australasia to select and ap-
point candidates subject to confirmation in
London. To that resolution the Directors
gave prompt attention and earnest considera-
tion, with the result that the power asked
for was granted. And it is a very happy
coincidence that in connection with the
second Intercolonial Conference we should
be permitted to witness as the direct fruit of
our Sydney resolution the ordination of
the first Australian missionary in connection
with our Society. By such practical
fruit in other directions may our periodical
Conferences continue to make their necessity
felt. My dear brother, as a Scriptural
starting-point rather than a text, I will
quote from Paul's Epistle to the Romans the
first chapter and the fifth verse these words:
—"By whom we have received grace and
apostleship, for obedience to the faith among
all nations for His name." Very heartily do
I congratulate you that, through the grace
you have received, you are to-night receiving
ordination to modern apostleship—that you
are being set apart to a work which has come
to you in direct spiritual succession from the
first great Apostle to the Gentiles. A greater
honour could not be conferred upon you, a
more glorious work could not engage your
thought, enlist your affection, or call into
exercise your highest and best powers. You
are to be the bearer of a divine message, a
message the divine origin and character
of which has been proved by
the effect it has everywhere produced
amongst all people to whom it has been con-
veyed. It is of vital importance that you
should go forth to your life's work as a
missionary with a conviction that you are the
bearer of a message from God, and that the
conviction should be fostered all through
your career. Paul received his apostleship
from Jesus Christ, and from Jesus Christ you
are to-night receiving your commission. You
cannot entirely dissociate this service from
its human surroundings, but it will be well
for you to try and forget every presence but
the presence of the Master. Alone in a
desert solitude Moses stood before the burn-
ing bush, and from the lips of God himself
received his charge to go down to Egypt,
and by those lips he was told to say to
Pharaoh, "God hath sent me unto you." May
nothing human come between your soul and


Christ to-night. From His lips may you
hear the command to go, and when
you reaoh the shores of New Guinea
be able to say to those benighted
tribes, "Christ hath sent me unto you."
Another conviction necessary to your success
is suggested by the words we have quoted,
The Christian apostleship of Paul was for all
nations, " for obedience to the faith among
all nations for His name." In one imperial
name and rule all nations, tribes, all peoples,
are to be federated. No ambassador from an
earthly court was ever commissioned to make
such large demands or entrusted with a charge
so wide and comprehensive. The gospel of
Jesus Christ is for all peoples. By it God
purposes to gather into one all alien tribes.
You are entrusted with a message which is
addressed to every human heart —a message
from the Son of Man to men, from the Divine
Saviour to every burdened human spirit.
The widest proof history affords of the
universal adaptability of the gospel to all
peoples has been given during the present
century. Our messengers have stood before
the magnificent temples of India, and
have denounced these false philosophies
which were already old before Christianity
was born; they have gone to China,
and the claims of Christ have held
opposed to the claims of Confucius ; they have
pushed their way into the interior of Africa,
and the silver notes of the gospel trumpet
have been heard upon the mountains of the
dark continent; they have gone to Labrador
in the north and Terra del Fuego in the
south ; they have unfurled their banner amid
the snows of Siberia and on the tropical
shores of the Western Isles ; they have
preached Christ to cultured pagans on the
banks of the Ganges and to ignorant and
blood-stained cannibal tribes in the palm
groves of Fiji. The experiment of applying
the gospel as a regenerating power to all
conditions of human knowledge, to all shades
of human character, to all false systems, and
to all the tribal divisions of the human
family has been tried in places which may be
regarded as fair trial grounds, and the result
has been a victory for the cross, unmistak-
able and convincing! In the strength of a
conviction so strongly confirmed turn your
feet, my brother, toward the newly estab-
lished mission to which you have been ap-
pointed, assured that the most degraded
New Guinean is capable of responding to
your message of redeeming love. Go, never
forgetting that you are the servant of a
Master who holds the key to every human
heart, that you represent an imperial name
after'which every family in heaven and on
earth is destined to be named. You are not
devoting your life to a doubtful cause : you
are going forth to serve a Master who must
reign till He hath put all enemies under His
feet. You have been ordained to-night as a
preacher of the gospel. May I for a moment
emphasize the fact that this henceforth is to
be your calling? You are being sent by the
Christian Churches of this colony to declare to
pagan people'the existence of Him who is to
them an unknown God, to unveil the per-
fection of His nature and character, and to
proglaim His mercy and love. And this you
are to do by telling them in its deepest and
highest and most comprehensive sense the
story of the cross —the story of human re-
demption through the life and death
of Jesus Christ. Henceforth this sacred
task is to be your vocation. See that
you never allow it to occupy a secondary
place. You are going to a land which was
until yesterday a terra incognita , a country
of much interest to the botanist, the geologist,
the student of philology and ethnology.
Tempting fields for observation and research
will present themselves on every hand. You
will be in a position to contribute new facts
to the store of human knowledge, and it will
be strange if you have no desire to render
such service. By all means do so. Glean
from these new fields of observation, both
for your own sake and for the sake of man-
kind, all the new facts you can, but do not
become a gleaner of scientific data to the
injury of the primary object for which to-
night we send you forth. If you should
develop an aptitude for exploration like
Chalmers, like Chalmers make your explora-
tion subservient to your ministry as a mes-
senger of the Churches. If, like Thomas
Powell, my old colleague who has just passed
away, you should conceive a liking for
the study of new flora, like Thomas
Powell keep botany in its proper place, and,
as he did, ever remember that before every-
thing else your life's mission is that of a
Christian teacher. Permit me now to say a
word or two about the methods of your teach-
ing. Before you can build up a structure of
Christian thought in the pagan mind there
will of necessity be some pulling down of
false and foolish ideas. In your pulling down
avoid the reckless spirit of an iconoclast-
save the harmless and the useful. You will
not only discover harmless things in the
pagan mind, but thiDgs so useful that they
will be of immense value in effecting the
transformation you desire to produce.
Heathen darkness is not absolute darkness.
Some pagan beliefs are simply perversions of
the truth, they are not essentially errors.
The foundation idea you will often find to be
a foundation worthy to bear and able to
bear a better superstructure. The spiritual
nature of God, the immortality of the soul,
the unfailing penalties of retributive justice,
and the efficacy of prayer are living germs
which you will find buried maybe beneath
much superstitious rubbish, each germ en-
cased within the pagan encrustations of ages,
but still like the grains of wheat in the
mummy's sarcophagus, living germs. A part
of your work will be to rescue such germs, to
bring them out into the light, to plant them
in a genial soil, and to watch with care their
growth, as grow they will, and bear good
fruit beneath the warm and vitalizing in-
fluence of Christian and gospel truth. What
I wish to impress upon you here is this : that
you will not have in all cases to impart new
ideas, but simply to give a right direction to
the ideas already existing in the native mind.
Much that is absolutely new to the heathen
mind and heart you will have to make known,
but the quickest way, and by far the most
satisfactory way, of leading pagan people into
new fields of spiritual knowledge is by em


ploying as stepping • stones the crude
elementary knowledge they already possess.
In like manner avoid a reckless demolition of
old customs. Do not attempt to convert
Papuans into English Christians, but aim at
Christianizing the Papuans. Conserve their
harmless national customs. Change the
atmosphere of New Guinean homes, but do
not pull down social institutions which are
not of necessity immoral. Do not rob them
of their primitive sports because they may
bear heathen names and be heathen in asso-
ciation. Change the association, but do not
change that which may still be a source of
sportive joy and healthy recreation. You
must in your teaching combine Moses and
Christ, but beware of over legislation. You
will have to be a lawgiver. The people will
ask you what they may and may not do,
what old things they are to give up, what
new things they are to adopt. In giving them
an answer you will have to exercise pains-
taking discrimination and to avoid narrow
and false standards of decision. Do not
legislate more than you can help, but
spiritualize. By your teaching and your in-
fluence introduce into the social and
tribal life of the Papuans the mind
of Christ, and let their new Christian life
develop unfettered by petty prohibitions
and irksome rules—develop naturally in
harmony with the conditions of Papuan life.
And we would remind you of the importance
of recognising the human in the savage. I
believe the secret of the wonderful influence
which Lawes and Chalmers have gained over
the people of New Guinea has been the fact
of theirbelief in the humanity of cannibals.
Chalmers in his last book speaks with affec-
tionate admiration of notorious cannibal
chiefs whom he is proud to leckon amongst
his friends—a very undesirable friendship,
some might imagine. What I mean is this,
that some of the noblest human qualities
may be found in a savage. A cannibal is not
of necessity bad all round and all through.
When you see, as you will doubtless see, a
New Guinean in his warpaint and hideous
trappings do not conclude that he is the
absolute demon he appears to be. I
have seen savages in their warpaint. I
have often dressed their wounds received
in battle, and some of them were men whom
for their sense of honour and many excellent
personal qualities I held in the highest esteem.
Forget, if you can, the cannibalism of your
future flock, and endeavour to get at the
real man underneath the human heart, for it
is human after all, and you will find in the
worst a readiness to appreciate your unsel-
fish friendship and a capability of feeling
more than interested in your wonderful
story of the wondrous love of the world's
Saviour. There are worse characters than
cannibals in the world, although we
generally use this term as descriptive
of the lowest form of human life.
There are men in civilized Christian
cities whom I would be slower to trust than
a savage New Guinean. Do not misunder-
stand me. I do not wish to exalt overmuch
the character of the Papuans, but I wish to
suggest as an essential article of your creed
a belief in their humanity, and to assure you
that much of your success will depend
upon your giving practical proof of
this belief in your intercourse with them.
One word I should like to say here about the
importance of cultivating in your future
charge self-dependence in relation to Church
life and Christian work. Foreign supervision
there must of necessity be for some time, but
from the very first that supervision should be
so directed as to prepare the native Church
for self-government. Never forgot that your
work is a terminable mission, a mission which
will terminate when you have planted
Churches strong enough to do without
foreign support. The Society under which
you are to labour exists to send the gospel
to the heathen and not to maintain pastors in
Christian communities, and your object must
be to develop as soon as possible a community
of self-governing Christians, so that the
Society may be free to expend its resources
for purely missionary work elsewhere.
It is scarcely necessary to say that amongst
such a people the influence of your daily life
will have more effect than your preaching.
It will be some time before you are able to
preach, and a considerable time before you
will be able to preach to edification; but
from the moment you land you life will begin
to speak. The natives are very keen
observers, and they will estimate the value
of your message by your character. The
gospel which the savage can best understand
is the gospel which convinces him that the
bearer of it is an unselfish benefactor. I
need hardly remind you that it was in this
way the gospel was first preached by its
divine Author. He went about doing good,
not expressing good wishes, not praying that
good done, but actually doing itHim-
self. The ministry of Jesus Christ was a
ministry of human sympathy, and in the
same spirit must your mission to New Guinea
be introduced and carried on. Make the
natives feel that you are their friend and bhey
will listen to you and be prepared to
hear what you have to say about
the divine Friend to whom you desire to
lead them. Vigilant care you will need to
exercise in regard to your own spiritual life.
The first Apostle to the Gentiles trembled
lest he should himself live beneath the
standard he was advocating. Every Christian
minister present to-night would tell you of
the vital connection between ministerial
power and personal sanctity, between holy
living and effective preaching. The fountain
of thought and desire within must be kept
wholesome and sweet, or the public work
will lack unction and effective power. And
every Christian minister present would tell
you how much watchfulness is needed to
maintain a healthy inner life. The difficulty
of doing so is greater in the mission-field
than in the home ministry. Many aids
which you have here you will miss in New
Guinea. You will miss the Christian atmo-
sphere of the Christian community, the
stimulus of Christian example and Christian
fellowship, In regard to your personal
spiritual life, as in regard te many
other things you will be thrown more
entirely upon your own _ personal resources.
A peculiar danger will arise from the fact that


your preaching will of necessity for long deal
with the most elementary truths, that your
hearers will occupy intellectually and spiritu-
ally a lower plane. In feeding your flock you
will not be feeding yourself. Your higher
and more perfectly developed life will need a
different diet, and this you must supply by
private reading and enquiry into the deeper
ways of God and meditation and prayer. In
New Guinea you will be the associate of dis-
tinguished missionaries. A gentleman once
asked me how it was the Directors managed
to secure three men like Macfarlane, Lawes,
and Chalmers for that one mission, I replied
that it was by natural selection. They had
done yeoman service in Polynesia, and they
were made the leaders of the new and diffi-
cult enterprise because they had been already
tried and proved elsewhere. Lawes I have
known and loved from boyhood. We com-
menced the business of life together. A
truer man and a wiser, safer councillor you
will nowhere find. Chalmers I know,
and who that knows him does
not admire his sympathetic nature,
his manly common sense, his unselfish
heroism. With these men you are to work.
Macfarlane has retired from the mission.
With these men you are to work. May the
stimulus which their presence and friend-
ship and sympathy will afford be very help-
ful to you, and may your record of service be
equal to theirs. I must now bring my words
to a close. In the history of Australasian
independency this service will be a landmark.
Until this evening there has been no mis-
sionary ordination on this continent in con-
nection with the London Missionary Society.
We are sending our first Australian contin-
gent into the field. The honour which has
fallen to your lot, my brother, is a very great
one, and the responsibility resting upon you
is equally great. I look forward to the time
when the Australian Churches of our order,
true to the demands of their environment,
will send gospel messengers to the near shores
of India, China, and Japan, as well as to the
great archipelago lying around our northern
and eastern shores. The London Missionary
Society will naturally look to us to
supplement its work in these regions close
to our Australian waters, and I believe our
Churches will not be slow to respond; but
of Australian missionaries, how ever many
may follow, you in order of time are the
leader. May you have grace and wisdom
and zeal to fill the post with honour to your-
self, honour the Church at Port Adelaide
which sends you, honour to this colony
and to all our Churches in all the colonies,
who will naturally and rightly feel that you
belong to them May you fill the post with
honour to the much honoured London Mis-
sionary Society, whose record of work during
this century has been so glorious, and with
honour to Him, our blessed divine Master,
in whose name we send you forth. This charge
1 commit unto thee that thou mayest war a
good warfare, holding faith and a good con-
science. Go, and may the Lord go with you.
When you plant the altar of your home in
that strange land may God spread over you
sheltering wings. May His presence around
you be a wall of defence in every time of
danger. May His spirit quicken your mes-
sage. May you have great joy in your work.
May you be permitted to gather an abundant
harvest from New Guinea tribes into the fold
of Christ. Now the God of peace that
brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus
Christ, that Great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the Everlasting Cove-
nant, make you Derfect in every good work to
do His will, working in you that which is
well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.
Dr. DALE, having addressed a few words of
exhortation to the congregation and to Mr.
Moorhouse, closed the meeting with prayer.
A collection was taken up in behalf of the
London Missionary Society.
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9.
On Friday afternoon, September 9, a devo-
tional meeting was held in the Stow Lecture
Hall, after which the work of the Conference
was resumed.
DENOMINATIONAL LITERATURE.
The Rev. R. DEY, of Sydney, opened a dis-
cussion on " Denominational Literature,"
and submitted proposals for the amalgama-
tion of the Victorian, the New South Wales,
and the Australian Independents into one
publication that should be devoted to all
the colonies. He also advocated the publica-
tion of an " Australasian Year-book," instead
of Year book for each colony. He moved—
" That an Intercolonial Congregational
Magazine be issued on January 1, 1888,
and on the first of each succeeding
month, at the rate of 6d. a copy, or
ss. _ a year; such magazine to have the
designation the Australasian Independent,
and to contain twenty-four .pages of literary
matter, eight of which shall be given
to Victoria, eight to New South Wales,
and eight to the other colonies."
The Rev. F. W. Cox seconded, and the
proposal was generally well received. Olti-
mately the following amendment, moved by
the Rev. S. HEBDITCH, was carried unani-
mously : —" That in the opinion of this Con-
ference it is desirable that steps be taken to
start an Intercolonial Congregational Paper."
The Revs. R. Dey (Convener), G. Wight, J.
C. Kirby, W. Allen, G. W. Sharp, and J.
Walker, and Mr. Watmuff were appointed a
committee to consider Mr. Dey's proposals in
detail.
AN INVIT4.TION FROM HIS EXCELLENCY.
The CHAIRMAN announced that he had on
Thursday received a request from His Excel-
lency the Governor that he would wait upon
him with a view of making arrangements for a
reception of the delegates to the Conference at


Government House. (Hear, hear.) He did
so, and His Excellency suggested that the
reception should take place on Wednesday
or Thursday next, as his time would be
available on those days only. Next Wednes-
day they would be fully occupied in Con-
ference, and he told His Excellency that
most of the delegates from the other colonies
intended to return on Thursday morning, and
that their tickets would require them to do
so. The Governor said he would commu-
nicate with the railway authorities in order
to see if the time allotted for the return
tickets could be extended until Friday.
That day he (Mr. Fletcher) had received a
letter from His Excellency's Private Secre-
tary stating that the delegates could return
by any train they liked, inasmuch as they
held the higher-price excursion tickets, He
found, however, that nearly all the delegates
had arranged to leave on Thursday, so he
had replied to His Excellency that it
would be better, perhaps, if he did not
put himself to any further trouble, seeing
chat comparatively few could avail themselves
of his kindness. At the same time he thanked
the Governor for his courtesy. (Hear, hear.)
He had publicly mentioned this matter,
because no one had suggested the idea to His
Excellency, but the invitation came from
himself alone. (Hear, hear.) On the motion
of the Rev. Dr. BEVAN, an expression of
thanks to His Excellency for the honour he
had done the delegates, and embodying their
regrets at beiDg unable to take advantage of
his kindness, was agreed to.
COLONIAL COLLEGES.
The CHAIRMAN introduced the question
of "Colonial Colleges." He referred to
the importance of the subject to the colonies,
and mentioned the points on which he
thought there could be no misunderstanding.
After a brief discussion the further con-
sideration of the subject was deferred until
Tuesday.
YOUNG MEN'S JUBILEE SERVICE.
DR. DALE ON SACERDOTALISM.
The North Adelaide Church on Friday
evening was crowded, mostly by young men,
attracted principally by the announcement
that Dr. Dale and Mr. A. Spicer would de-
liver addresses specially directed to them.
The Rev. Dr. Jefferis, of Sydney, presided,
and the meeting commenced with prayer and
the singing of the hymn, " Forward be our
watchword."
The CHAIRMAN and the Rev. W. ALLEN, of
Melbourne, having made some practical
remarks,
Mr. SPICER dwelt at length upon the
reasons why Australians should be proud of
the British Empire. He reviewed the great
social and philanthropic achievements for
the benefit of the people that had marked the
last fifty years of England's history, and went
on to show that the great privileges that be-
longed to the young men of Australia brought
with them great responsibilities. He warned
them against thinking lightly of life, and
pointed out the evils of over-speculation and
gambling, which he said were in opposition
to the divine laws of work and of love for
mankind. Commercial enterprise, if rightly
conducted, always meant mutual advantage.
He then dwelt on the duties of men in regard
to politics, and closed by urging that the
supremacy of God's laws and gracious pur-
poses should be acknowledged in all things.
Dr. DALE, in the course of a long and most
eloquent address, reminded the audience
that the jubilee of Congregationalism in the
colony was intended to recall the memory and
the courage, of the sagacity, and the zeal of
those who fifty years ago laid the foundations
of a Church organized on Congregational prin-
ciples in the City of Adelaide. Those who did
that work inherited the great traditions of
English evangelical Nonconformity and of
English Puritanism. If they traced back
their ancestry they would find it had been
illustrated by the names of many noble men
who had fought, and suffered, and died for
their principles. John Wickliffe and others
who, from the end of the 14th until the
beginning of the 16th century, maintained a
succession of secret Societies in the old
country for the worship of God, prepared the
way for the fuller light which came to us in
the days of the Reformation. What the
founders of Congregationalism in this colony
received from this great ancestry was not a
theological creed, or merely a form of eccle-
siastical polity, but it was a faith and a great
religious tradition which affected their
conception of the religious life and of
man's relations both to God and to human
society. (Cheers.) If he were to attempt to
define the common element which might, he
thought, be found in the forms of faith in the
great religious movement associated with the
names of those whom Congregationalists re-
garded as their ascestry, he should define it
as a vivid sense of the greatness and the
august majesty of God and of His nearness to
the human race. (Cheers ) It was said of
Martin Luther that he rediscovered God.
He thought it might be said of English Non-
conformity, of h nglish Puritanism, and of the
English reformers that the movement with
which they were associated had tended to
exalt the greatness and the majesty of the
Supreme and to inspire men with a
deeper and intenser consciousness that
in Him they lived and moved and
had their being. (Cheers.) Let him
remind them of some of the points on which
their ancestors insisted. Take the great
doctrine of justification by faith. When
that doctrine was proclaimed it led thefil
heart of the great northern nations of Europe
with immeasurable joy. It brought with it
the sense of a new freedom. It was in-
finitely more to them than a theological
dogma. It taught that apart from Pope and
from priests, from penances and from confes-
sions, from the rites and ordinances of a
Church a man had merely to trust in the in-
finite mercy of God as revealed in Jesus
Christ. It swept away from the path of the
penitent everything that came between him
and the God against whom he had sinned,
and from whom alone he could receive effec-
tive absolution. (Cheers.) The great struggle
against sacerdotalism was the same struggle
in another form. The doctrine of justifica-
tion by faith told every man that he need not
unfold the secrets of his heart to priest; that


God was nearer to us than priest, and that
He was more merciful to us than priest could
be. (Cheers.) Why should a man attempt
to stand between him and the Eternal. Was
he a child of God ? Then to his Father and
to Him alone would he speak of the trans-
gression he had committed against Him. And
if any man came to him and asserted on the
authority of any Church that he was dele-
gated to receive the confessions of his fellow-
men and to grant absolution in God's name,
he would tell him that he was guilty of im-
pairing the dignity which God had conferred
upon him as His child, and that he was guilty
of blasphemy against the infinite mercy and
love of God as a father. (Cheers.) Take
again the struggle against the false
conception of the Church which had
been developed during those ages
of European history which, notwith-
standing some glorious passages in them,
we were accustomed to call the Dark Ages.
What was the meaning of the struggle ? It
meant this, that God was so near to men
—that Christ was so near them —that there
was no need to look to a stately hierarchy as
the organ through which man might learn
the will of God; but that "where two or
three were gathered together in the name of
Christ" they for themselves could have His
presence ; and that neither Fope nor Bishop,
Council nor Synod, was necessary for God's
children to learn the will of their Father, and
to be taught by the Spirit. (Cheers.) If
the young men of South Australia wished
to' discharge the grave trust they had
inherited, if they were to transmit
the tradition they had received to
the generations that were to succeed them,
the first thing necessary was for them to have
a vivid sense of the greatness of the Eternal,
and a deep and sure confidence of His near-
ness to them. They could be no successors
of the Puritans or Evangelical Nonconfor-
mists unless they had that. (Hear, hear.)
Mere forms of ecclesiastical organization had
no value apart from that deep faith from
which they sprang. Doctrines, however
true, had no worth apart from the spirit of
which they were the original expression.
Each man must discover for himself that the
Eternal was near, and that human life had
its roots in Him. (Hear, hear.) Some young
men might say, " Oh, we are living in an age
of theological decay. Venerable systems of
faith that sheltered the religious life of men
of earlier generations are showing traces of
frailty, and are rapidly falling around
us. We live in an age of theological
transition, and our contemporaries have not
yet reached a final conclusion concerning
some of the greatest questions of theological
enquiry." He would answer—lf there was
exceptional peril there was also exceptional
advantages for those who lived in times of
theological decay. He could quite under-
stand that when the great system of Cal-
vinism seemed fixed and secure on founda-
tions of granite the men who lived in those
days might have been content with the
definitions of spiritual truth which were
given to them by the great theologians who
had founded the system, and instead of ap-
pealing to God himself and finding all things
in Him, they might have been content to
live a religious life on what he might even
call secondhand knowledge. This was not
possible in these days. (Hear, hear.) There
were no theologians whose authority was un-
impeached, no Church whose authority was
unquestioned. For people now rest and
strength were to be found only at the feet of
God. They had less temptation than some
of their fathers had to stop short of Him.
(Hear, hear.) He was prepared to main-
tain that the ages of transition from
ancient systems and of breaking off
of old customs had been precisely the
ages when faith in God of the loftiest and
most heroic forms had been generated.
What an age of transition that was of which
we had the history in the New Testament,
when in obedience to the call of God those
who heard the voice of Christ and of His
apostles had to go out into a new future like
Abraham —not knowing whither they went ?
Yet that was a time of grand and victorious
faith. Consider the condition of European
thought towards the end of the fifteenth
century, when the pagan literature of
Greece and Rome seemed to be reasserting
itself over the intellect and genius of the
civilized nations. There was then a complete
drifting away from faith in Christ, and the
old paganism and naturalism were asserting
their power over the intellect and moral life
of men. Just at that time the Reformation
came, and the Roman Church, which, not-
withstanding all its crimes, had rendered
immense service to the nations, was
assaulted, and assaulted with success;
the crimes of its rulers and its
priests were openly denounced, and the
fabric with all its malformations was ex-
posed. Was there a decay of faith in that
age ? Was not the era of the Reformation
when the old things were passing away, pre-
cisely the age when the Christian life pro-
vided some of the most glorious examples of
a lofty and passionate faith ? (Cheers.) He
therefore protested against the supposi-
tion that because this was an age of
theological transition it was hard for young
men to believe in God. It was hard for
them to believe in any elaborately organized
theological system ; but had they not learnt
to distinguish between man's conceptions
and his definitions of things eternal and
divine and the august realities themselves ?
(Cheers) Did they think that when the
Copernican system declared that the sun
and not the earth was the centre of the
planetary system men began to ask,
"Is it possible for us to believe that the sun
is in the heavens any longer ?'' (Hear, hear.)
After dealing with the question as to how a
deep and assured faith could be reached, Dr.
Dale impressed the thought that faith in God
should affect the whole method and course of
human life. He asked them to devote all their
powers to the service of Christ, and to
accept the creed of Christian people who in
the common paths of life manifestly lived in
authority to supernatural laws, and by their
faith transfigured all the common duties
they performed. He eloquently advocated
the claims of politics upon the attention of
young men, and mentioned that whatever


..he old Independents were able to achieve
for English freedom was the result of the
depth and the intensity of their faith in God.
They struggled and suffered, not for the love
of freedom for its own sake, but because they
felt under a supreme obligation to do God's
will. He condemned sacerdotalism, because
it led to the idea that the commonalty were
on a lower level than the clergy or priests
as regarded spiritual and moral duties and
acquirements. In a powerful peroration he
exhorted his hearers to high and lofty aims
in carrying out the duties of everyday life.
The address, which occupied nearly an
hour, was most attentively and warmly
received.
The meeting shortly afterwards ter-
minated.
" AT HOME" AT THE ACACIAS.
On Saturday afternoon, September 10, Mr.
and Mrs. E. T. Smith invited the English
and colonial delegates with the General and
Executive Committees of the Jubilee Fund
to meet in an informal way at their residence
at Marryatvitle. About 300 ladies and
gentlemen were present, comprising not only
the delegates and the leading CoDgrega-
tionalists in the colony, but a good sprinkling
of Anglicans, Presbyterians, Baptists, and
Methodists. The weather being most de-
lightful, an ample opportunity was afforded
for exploring the conservatory and green-
houses scattered all over the grounds, while
others were provided with a musical enter-
tainment in the concert room, in which a
number of guests and other friends took part,
while the Police Band further enlivened the
proceedings by some excellent music on the
lawn. Refreshments were provided in the
supper-room, and every effort was made by
the Mayor and Mayoress for the comfort and
pleasure of their guests. About 6 o'clock the
company broke up.
THE SUNDAY SERVICES.
The services at the Congregational Churches
on Sunday, September 11, were again of a
special character. The attendances were
large, and liberal collections were made. At
Stow Church, and the Churches at Hind-
marsh, Glenelg, Clayton, Hindmarsh square,
North Adelaide, College Park, Medindie,
and Rose Park young people's services were
held ia the afternoon. The morning and
evening discourses were delivered as follows :
Stow Church, Revs. James Hill and Dr.
Jefferis ; Hindmarsh, Revs. Dr. Roseby and
F. H. Browne ; Port Adelaide, Revs. F. H.
Browne and William Allen; Happy Valley,
Rev. F W. Cox; Glenelg, Rev. Dr. Jefferis
and Dr. Dale ; Clayton, Revs, G. Campbell
and J. Hill; Hindmarsh-square, Dr. Dale
and Rev, Dr. Roseby ; Kapunda, Rev, W. S.
Fernie ; Gawler, Rev. Joseph King; North
Adelaide, Revs. G. Clarke and Dr. Bevan;
Angaston, Rev. W. Currie; College Park,
Revs. Dr. Bevan and G. G. Howden ; Mount
Lofty, Rev. J. Lloyd ; Henley Beach. Revs.
J. Walker and J. W.Jones; Medindie, Revs.
J. J. Halley and J. Walker; Rose Park,
Revs. R. Dey and J. J, Halley.
JUBILEE PICNIC.
The committee of the Congregational
Jubilee Celebration arranged for a picnic
to Mount Lofty on Monday for the dele-
gates to the Conference. At 10 o'clock
the number of ladies and gentlemen
who assembled at Stow Church was
so large that the four five-horse buses that
were ordered from Hill & Co. were filled and
two additional conveyances had to be ob-
tained. Fully 200 people availed them-
selves of the opportunity of spending a
day's outing on the summit of the Mount.
At a quarter past 10 five of the coaches
started, and the sixth followed at
10.50, accompanied by two wagonettes.
Soon after the start was made a heavy
shower of rain fell, which rather spoilt the
early part of the drive; but with the excep-
tion of one or two showers later on, the
weather was well suited for a picnic. All
along the way the various places of interest
were pointed out, and the visitors more
especially were loud in their praises of the
scenery and the fine view of the city and its
environs. The Mount was reached soon
after 1, and then the company broke up in
merry groups and partook of refreshments.
This over the party scattered over the
Mount, picking the wild flowers, which were
abundant, or engaging in social converse. All
the afternoon the summit presented a most
animated appearance. Sir Thomas Elder
generously threw open his grounds to the
visitors, many of whom took advantage of
the offer. At 4 a start was made homewards,
and the city was reached at 5.30.
SACRED CONCERT.
In connection with the celebration of the
Jubilee of Congregationalism in this colony a
special sacred concert was given in the Town
Hall on Monday night. The attendance was
very large, including the English and colonial
delegates, the floor of the hall and the gallery
being completely packed. For some time
past Mr. C. J. Stevens has been engaged in
training a choir for this concert, the vocalists
consisting almost entirely of the members of
the city and suburban Congregational Church
choirs. He succeeded in bringing together
a chorus of about 250 voices, most of whom
have been unaccustomed to the rendering of
high-class choral music. The success, there-
fore, which was achieved on Monday night
may be taken as a mark of the skill of the
conductor in the matter of training what
may be considered, in this instance, some-
what raw material. In the chorus there
were doubtless some well qualified to appear
in the best of our Musical Societies, but
against this there were many who do not
aspire to take part in any music other than
that which is commonly sung in the ordinary
Church services. It is for this reason that
the correct rendering of the choruses in-
cluded in the programme is a source
of congratulation alike to the con-
ductor and those under his baton.
Gaul's " The Holy City" was evidently
written not for a first-class Musical Society,
but rather to accommodate itself to the re-
sources of perhaps a fairly large Church
choir, with, of course, opportunities for


greater effect when performed by larger
numbers. It is not to be compared with
the oratorios of the great masters from a
musical point of view ; but it nevertheless is
characterized by solos, concerted numbers,
and choruses which will always prove
attractive when well sung. In the
second part of the programme there were
several selections from "Elijah," besides an
anthem specially written by Mr. C. J. Stevens
for this occasion, and entitled "Sing, 0
Heavens."
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13.
The Intercolonial Conference in connection
with the jubilee of Congregationalism was
resumed at Stow Lecture Hall on Tuesday
morning. The Rev. W. R. Fletcher presided
over a large attendance.
FOREIGN MISSIONS.
The Rev. Dr. JEFFERIS, on behalf of a com
mittee who had considered the subject, moved
—" That in the opinion of this Conference the
time has arrived for the formation of a
distinct Missionary Society for Australasia in
close affiliation with the London Missionary
Society, and that a committee be appointed
to consider the whole question, and report
at the next Intercolonial Conference to be
held in Melbourne in October, 1888, and that
the following be the committee : —New South
Wales, Revs. Dr. Jefferis and J. P. Sunder-
land ; Victoria, Revs. Dr. Bevan, J.
King, J. J. Halley, and J. Rickards,
Hon. W. Bates, and Mr. Nichols ;
South Australia, Rev. S. Hebditch and Mr
R. Searle ; Western Australia, Revs. J. John
ston and Joseph King (deputy); Tasmania,
Revs. G. Clarke and W. Law; Queensland,
Revs. J. Walker and E. Griffith ; New Zea-
land, Rev. Dr. Roseby; convener, Rev.
Joseph King; with power to add to its'
number, five to form a quorum." .Nothing
need be said about the importance of the sub-
ject. It was advisable that Melbourne
should be the head-quarters of the committee
because of its central position.
The Rev. J. JOHNSTON seconded.
Mr. SPICER thought the Churches in
Australasia would do very much more than
they were now doing if they undertook
definite responsibilities. The London Mis-
sionary Society needed such an auxiliary as
was proposed, for their funds were not in a
satisfactory condition.
The Rev. J. C. KIRBY was glad to see that
the London Society were evincing a disposi-
tion to place confidence in Australian
Churches. They should pay special attention
to the Pacific Islands, because it was only
right that in time they should politically
belong to Austi alia.
Dr. DALE thought the Churches of Aus-
tralia should be in touch with the missions in
the Pacific, with a view of developing
strong Christian communities in the different
islands.
The Rev. Dr. BEVAN objected to the idea
going forth that any Missionary Society that
might be formed in Australia should seek to
act as the pioneer of political progress.
(Hear, hear.)
The resolution was adopted.
DENOMINATIONAL LITERATURE.
Some proposals formula ;ed by a Committee
on Denominational Literature were discussed,
the result being that the Congregational
Unions of New South Wales and Victoria
were recommended to establish an intercolo-
nial publication for the Churches, a yearbook
and other literature.
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR
CHURCHES IN REGARD TO THE
\OUNG.
The following papers were read
The Rev. Dr. JEFFERIS —The Church of
Christ has never refused to recognise its
responsibilities in regard to the young, but
often and for long they have not been felt
and obeyed. When Borromeo established
Sunday-schools in Milan, and Robert Raikes
founded them in Gloucester, it was as if a
new light had dawned on the Christian mind,
and a new and sacred feeling had touched the
Christian heart. In England for more than
100 years the Protestant Churches have been
sensitively alive to their duty, until the
Sunday-school has become almost a necessary
adjunct to every congregation of adults,
Indeed, in many instances the school paves
the way for the Church. But as the condi-
tions of national life change, religious duties
vary in the mode of their manifestation. And
sometimes it happens that zeal outruns
both prudence and piety. The very success
of one method of obedience may lead to the
neglect of others equally necessary. Some
good men are asking to-day whether Sunday-
schools are not interfering with parental
obligations, and whether to the weakening of
these is not due much of the alienation of our
youth from the Churches of Christ. In
Sydney of late a zealous minister of the
Episcopal Church has been advocating a
scheme of home training which would do away
with the Sunday-school. There are three
co-ordinate authorities to which the Master
of life has delegated responsibility in regard
to the teaching and training of the young—
the family, the State, the Churchy A wise
system of education depends on their concur-
rent and harmonious working. Within our
own Empire the State was the last to
acknowledge its divine vocation, but when
once quickened by conscience it hastened
by leaps and bounds to discharge its long-
neglected duty. In the mother land and in
every province of the Empire we have
devoted great wealth and the highest talent to
national education. Hence there is possi-
bility that the State may weaken the obliga-
tions of the Church by interfering with its
rights and functions. Now, in regard to the
family, let it be distinctly understood that if
Christian parents are willing to entrust the


entire religious education of their children to
teachers, and in doing so to neglect it them-
selves. then the Sunday-schools of the Empire
may be more of a curse than a blessing. God
has delegated the duty first of all to parents.
We cannot transfer it to others without
incurring His anger. The Church may come
to the help of parents, but must not stand in
their place. Upon this point the conscience
of Christendom simply needs fresh quicken-
ing. Our chief difficulty of late has arisen
from the conflict of the Church with the
State, or rather with the conflict of one
Church with the State. It has come about in
this wise. In discharge of the strongly felt
national duty, the State has undertaken that
children should be trained in the elementary
knowledge which is the pre-requisite to all
learning. We in this land, at the promptings
of the Christian spirit, have resolved, like
our brethren in the United States, to do this
by a uniform and national system. We have
seen that such a uniform and national system
could be secured only by declining to accept,
as our brethren in England have accepted,
the proffered aid of the Churches. One
Church, however, has absolutely refused to
agree to this. It has tried and is trying to
coerce the Government under the plea of a
divine necessity. " Hands off," it has said
and is saying, " that child was mine before it
was yours." My authority is greater than
that of the State, more continuous than that
of the parent. It covers time and stretches
into eternity. I claim, therefore, to have the
control of all the children whose parents are
of my communion during all the child years.
Whatever of secular knowledge needs to be
imparted shall be imparted under my direc-
tion, and shall be penetrated with my
divine teaching. Your State teaching, which
gives secular knowledge only, is Godless ;
your State schools, even if the facts of
Christianity are taught, even if permission is
given for the religious teacher to visit and
instruct, are seed-plots of immorality and ir-
religion." We, on the contrary, as a body of
confederated Churches, say that our re-
sponsibilities are not weakened, but rather
increased by the realization of this noble
idea of general national instruction. We say
to the State, " Persevere in the course you
have began. All truth is of God. You can-
not teach the children secular knowledge
without helping to impart religious truth.
As for the special revealed trutb contained
in the Bible, of which the Christian Church
is the guardian and the witness, let your
system be wide enough and flexible enough to
permit the different sections of Christianity
to teach it —separately if they must, unitedly
if they will. It is not the function of the
State to teach religion, but it is the duty of
the State to afford every facility for teaching
it." Having thus fenced off the responsibili-
ties of the family and the State where they
touch those of the Churches, we may now
look at our own. I will not enter upon any
of the vexed questions concerning the mean-
ing of baptism, and what distinct relation to
the witnessing Church is thereby implied.
Nor will I now consider, however tempting
the theme may be, whether it is to
found organizations among children by which
they may bear witness, as in a Church
within a Church, to the loyalty and love they
have for our divine Lord. The law of the
New Testament is clear enough upon prin-
ciples, but the commandment is exceeding
broad in regard to methods. Let love assert
itself toward the young with reverential
regard for the unity and sanctity of family
life, and means will never be wanting to
express it. Our existing Sunday-school
system carries with it mighty possibilities.
Methods of service may yet be developed
the spiritual results of which may cast into
the shade all that has yet been achieved.
Only let the Church look upon the Sunday-
school, with ail affiliated institutions joined
to it, as an integral part of herself, and the
children be cared for as belonging to the
family of God, and service will keep pace
with opportunity in the expression of her
solicitude and love. To this end I plead for a
consecration to the Sunday-school of the
highest talent in the Church. For secular
study we have the primary and upper schools,
we have Colleges and Universities. Something
like this we ought to have for divine studies
—something even answering to this in the
organization of every leading Church. Are
not some of you thoughtful men scandalized
at the way in which the teaching and culture
of religion is commonly dealt with ? Do you
not feel that there is room for the reproach
and the sneer so often directed us by the
enemies of the faith? Where and when is
the genuine study of the Bible carried on?
Where and when do we Christians thoroughly
apply ourselves to the understanding of
theology, the " Philosophia prima," the
crown and consummation of the sciences ? If
we were as interested in divine knowledge as
we ought to be, if we cared enough
about the revelation of the mind of God
in His Word and world, in history and
life, what a difference there would
speedily be in the teaching of the Church.
Should we not somehow or other have
Biblical and moral teaching adapted to every
age and every grade—pictorial in the infant
class, illustrative in the junior class, and in
senior classes for young men and maidens,
and even perhaps as in the Puritan times,
and as now in the Principality of Wales, for
fathers and mothers the riper teachings of
wisdom and experience. But very little of
this will ever be ours until the learning and
culture and talent of the Church are freely
offered. Do not tell me about the fierce com-
petition of our day, about the absorbing
demands of the secular career. It is not
necessary to be rich, and it is necessary to be
true servants of the Lord Jesus, to minister,
i.e., to be servants among the brethren, to
feed the sheep, to feed the lambs of the flock
of Christ. If only the men who have know-
ledge and experience and especial gifts, and
the women who have the wisdom that comes
with graoe and culture of soul, would give
themselves, upon a large scale, by mutual
concert to the service and teaching possible
in the schools of the Church, how soon should
we be delivered from the ignorance and the
dull uniformity which our work now pre-
sents. Little need then would there be to
resort to the sensational methods of teaching


which are so rife in modern Christianity.
There is room and reward for every sort of
faculty, for every kind of service. The poor
with their experience, the rich with their op-
portunity, the labourer and mechanic, the
clerk and the merchant, the lawyer and the
doctor, might find special work in school and
class on Sunday and week day. If ever the
Church of the future realizes the divine ideal
there will be a consecration to the Lord of
the Church for active service of powers and
opportunities such as are now too often left
to disuse and decay. But while thus urging
a higher and wider devotion, it would be
false and ungrateful not to recognise with
gratitude the offerings already made, the
results already accomplished. Was not John
Bright bearing true witness when he said
recently at Rochdale, " I believe that there is
no field of labour, no field of Christian bene-
volence, which has yielded a greater harvest
to our national interests and national cha-
racter than the great institution of the Sun-
day-schools." For the continuance of that
harvest there is one thing urgently demanded —
the special training of teachers for their work.
It has become a trite subject to contrast the
dayschool with the Sunday-school. It must
be dwelt on oftener yet. We will never
forget that the chief aim of the dayschool is
to impart knowledge, and the chief aim of
the Sunday-school is to bring the life into
obedience to Christ. But in both cases there
is need for the best kind of instruction, and
for order, method, discipline, and the
use of every appliance proved to be valu-
able. No teacher in our dayschool is
considered fit for his duty until he has
been trained for it and examined and ap-
proved. If the teaching that comes after
training is best for the dayschool, it will be
best for the Sunday-school. The teachers of
the dayschool are selected out of many that
offer their service. The Superintendents of
our Sunday-school are glad to employ all who
volunteer. All honour to the zeal which
works not for pay, but for the love of Christ.
But how much easier and how much more
successful that work would be if we could
only tiain the volunteers? I believe it must
come if the Sunday school is to hold its own.
We shall not retain our elder scholars unless
it does. Indeed, is not the complaint every-
where rising that we do not retain them now?
They have been accustomed in the day-
school to the better methods of teaching. If
you do not offer them something like it in the
Bible Class they will not attend. Piety itself
does not atone for inefficiency. But how
shall we train our teachers ? I have no sug-
gestions to offer that would not be deemed
quixotic. When the sense of need rises to an
imperative demand we shall count no cost
and no labour too great to make our teachers
fit for their noble work. It has taken a
century to create and establish Sunday-
schools. It will take another century to
render them perfect for the Master's service.
Mr. T. W. HARRIS—I am seriously afraid
that the Christian Church is losing its hold of
the rising generation of Australia. I do not
wish to include both sexes in this remark or
in my subsequent remarks. The natural in-
clinings of the gentler sex towards goodness,
their more impressionable natures, and their
purer surroundings are likely to keep the
majority of them in the path of virtue and
godliness. It is not therefore our girls and
young women for whom we need feel alarm
so much as those who belong to the other sex,
and who growing up into manhood have the
making of history in their keeping, and who
if not strongly governed by the laws of
righteousness and a deep sense of their re-
sponsibility to God may sadly mar the future
life of these rapidly growing nations of the
South. It is these, I fear me, who are
slipping away from the friendly grasp of the
Churches.
I am not usually regarded as a prophet
of evil. I always prefer taking the opti-
mistic view of things. I recognise the
good that is abroad in the world, and I
believe there is a vast deal more of it than
many are inclined to admit; I recognise the
wondrous strides that Christianity has made,
and the marvellous development of practical
philanthropy during the last half-century ;
and I look forward with confident hope to
the time when this great throbbing world
shall willingly place itself as an offering at
the feet of Him who gave Himself for its re-
demption. But when we are conscious of
the fact that the bulk of our young men are
just now so far indifferent to the claims of
religion that comparatively few attend a
place of worship, and when we know that
despite the increase in Sabbath-school build-
ings and the improved methods of teaching
there is a serious failing off in the attendance
of children at Sunday-school there is, I think
you will grant, cause for grave alarm at the
outlook as regards the generation now grow-
ing up amongst us, and you will further agree
that it behoves the Churches—not merely our
own section of the Christian Church, but all
Churches —to look to their bearings, and see
if a more aggressive and successful effort
cannot be made to win the youth of the
colonies to the side and service of their
rightful Lord and Master.
I am free to admit that a statement
of this kind should not be made unless
one has good grounds for making it. Let
us therefore to the proof. According
to Hayter's latest Yearbook—that is for
the year 1885-6 the average attendance
of Sunday school scholars in Victoria in
1884 was 146,914, while in 1885, notwith-
standing an increase of 30,000 in the popula-
tion, it had declined to 143,766, showing a
decrease of 3,148. This decrease is in face
of an increase of 6,000 to 7,000 children
of the school - going age, and in spite
of an increase of 113 Sabbath-school build-
ings and of 423 teachers. It may be urged
by some that the numbers on the roll would
be a better comparison than the average
attendance. Hayter only gives the latter,
but I think the one pretty well indicates the
other, and this is borne out by the figures
which relate to South Australia, As regards
this colony, the only statistics available are
the returns collected by the Sunday-school
Union, which deal with most of the metro-
politan and suburban schools, but not with
many in the country. However, I think
they may be accepted as a fair index of the


whole colony. According to these returns,
in the year 1884, when the population was
312,000, the total number of scholars on the
Union's roll was 11,653, with an average
attendance of 7,857, while in 1885, when the
population had increased to 319,000, the
number on the roll had declined to 10,866 with
an average a tendance of 7,184, showing a falling
off in the total number of scholars on the roll
of 787, and of 673 in the average attendance.
This unsatisfactory state of things is still
more apparent when it is mentioned that
between the two periods nine schools had
been added to the Union, representing 1,011
scholars, against three representing 353
scholars which had withdrawn from it, so
that comparing the same schools in the two
periods there is a falling off of 1,445 in the
total number of scholars, with a correspond-
ing decline in the average attendance. In
New South Wales, unlike the other two
colonies referred to, there is an increase in
the average attendance of some 5,000 scholars
between the years 1884 and 1885 ; but in com-
parison with the population the total number
of scholars in average attendance at school is
more than 40 per cent, below that of Victoria,
the figures being for 1885—Victoria—Popula-
tion, 992,000 ; average attendance of scholars,
143,766. New South Wales—Population,
958.000; average attendance of scholars,
84,522, or nearly 60,000 less than victoria,
with an almost corresponding population.
Thus it will be seen that unsatisfactory as
the colony of Victoria is in regard to the
number of children who are being taught in
its Sunday schools, the position of New South
Wales is much worse. I should add that it
is much better for 1886, but still far behind
the moderate standard of Victoria.
It will perhaps enable you to realize 'still
more vividly how inadequately Sabbath-
schools are coping with the religious in-
struction of the young if I compare
the number of school-going children with
the number who attend Sunday-school. I
can only gather the latter aproximately by
adding one-third to the average attendances.
In 1885, in Victoria, there were 202,379
children of the school-going age—that is
from 6 to 15 years old—and of this number
only 72 per cent, attend Sunday-school. The
percentage of absentees is still greater if the
age is extended to 17 years, which is allowable
for Sunday-school purposes. In New South
Wales the proportion is only about 58 per
cent. I have no means of giving the propor-
tions as they affect South Australia ; but as
regards the two leading colonies —and I fear
South Australia is not much better —the fact
is patent that out of over 400,000 children of
the school-going age only 228,000 are in
average attendance at Sunday-school, while
not more than 304,000 are on the rolls, thus
showing that at the least some 100,000
children are not receiving religious instruc
tion in the Sunday-schools of the various de-
nominations.
Advancing a stage beyond Sunday-school
children, we reach a large class which may be
included in the term of young manhood and
young womanhood. There are in the neighbour-
ing colony of Victoria between the wonderfully
formative ages of 15 and 25, no less than
223,133—that is, more than one-fifth of the
entire population, while in New South Wales
the number is 150,271, and in South Aus-
tralia 60,543. At a meeting in Melbourne
the Rev. Dr. Bevan stated that the number
of young men in that great city is variously
estimated at from 20,000 to 40,000, a large
proportion of whom live in lodgings, and, I
may add, are rarely seen inside a Church.
What is the case in the sister city of Mel-
bourne is the case in Sydney, and to a smaller
extent here. Now, the Young Men's Chris-
tian Associations touch but the veriest fringe
of this great mass of young men, and it is
these almost beyond any class of the com-
munity who should be laid hold of by the
Church and brought under the ennobling in-
fluence of Christian principle. These young
men are not low and degraded, and few of
them are of the class known as larrikins.
They are mostly intelligent, well-educated
youths, who have had the enterprise to leave
the older cities of the world to better them-
selves, and who are employed in Banks,
mercantile establishments, warehouses, and
other places of business. With their energy
and general intelligence they are bound to
become a power in these young, advancing
communities; hence the tremendous im-
portance of seeing that their lives are placed
upon right lines, and that they are subjected
to wholesome influences before they alto-
gether yield themselves captives to the world
and their baser passions.
I will not stay minutely to enquire what is
leading to this alienation from our Church and
Sanday-schools on the part of the young; but
I cannot resist the remark that I am afraid it
is partly if not largely due to the all-absorb-
ing interest which is taken in football and
other sports. It is a common thing to see at
a Saturday afternoon football match from
5,000 to 20,000 people, many if not most of
whom are young men who seem to have little
taste for higher pleasures. I notice this
abnormal interest everywhere and every day.
I notice it in the railway trains : I notice it in
merchants' and other offices; I notice it even
in Sunday-schools. It seems so engrossing
that so far as a certain and very important
section of our communities are concerned
there may, after all, be some danger of Dr.
Martineau's prediction being verified, that
the idea of God will have to go into retire-
ment for a season. Of course one does not
wish to decry physical exercise. It is ad-
mittedly as essential a part of true education
as the development of the intellectual side of
our nature, but it should be under the control
of reason, which it does not seem to be j us t now.
While saying this much, may it not on the
other hand be urged against thß Church that
it is also somewhat to blame in not accom-
modating itself to the modifying characteris-
tics of the age, and that it is losing much of
its power and influence through not seeking
in various ways to sanctify the amusements of
the people.
Now we are brought face to face
with the crux of the whole matter—what
can the Church do to restore, maintain,
and increase the influence over the young,
which it is apparently losing ? To say that
it must take a deeper interest in the


young; to say that the Sunday-school
must be made still more attractive, so that
those who go may learn to like it for its own
sake rather than because they are sent there
by their parents, and intend to leave it the
moment they can exercise their own will—to
say this and nothing more is not enough. I
have a notion that we have too contracted an
idea of the uses to which Church buildings
should be put. Surely much more might
be done with them than to make them
available only on Sabbath day, and a
few hours during the rest of the week.
They could, I think, be used in a variety of
ways, which if not actually religious might
help to keep the young morally straight, and
indirectly serve the cause of Christianity.
The world is wiser than the Church. It
makes use of amusements which are innocent
in themselves to ensnare the young, while the
Church looks calmly on and allows itself to
be robbed of the fruit which it should possess.
We shall have to learn to sanctify secular
things more, and bring them under the
sheltering wing of the Church. I know there
is a latitudinarianism to be avoided, and that
in serving the Lord a certain restraint must
be exercised over the tendencies which would
lead us too much into the world ; but there is
nothing inconsistent with an earnest disciple-
ship of the Christ and certain wholesome re-
creations which many Churches now look
upon with askance if not open hostility.
There is evidently a feeling abroad in England
that the young need to be looked after a little
more than they have been, and for this pur-
pose the establishment of Girls' Guilds and
Young Men's Guilds is being advocated
in connection with the various Churches.
Commenting upon this movement the < hris-
tian World of a late date remarks :—" There
has arisen a desire in the Free Churches for
some kind of fraternity among the young,
which should differ from Young Men's Chris-
tian Asoociations in having a broader and
freer religious basis, from Mutual Improve-
ment Societies in having a more distinctly
moral purpose, and from Debating Societies
in having a more pronounced sense of brother-
hood. Those who have observed the signs of
the times can have no manner of doubt that
in all our Churches a rallying point is needed
for the young, which at present is not pro-
vided either by the Sunday-school, the
Church, or any of the agencies now in opera-
tion." The Rev. George Reaney, of Stepney,
has established four of these Guilds—two for
boys and girls, and two for young men and
young women. From a description recently
published in the Christian World the fol-
lowing interesting extract may be quoted :
"In the midst of these Guilds and over all
Mr. Reaney himself presides as the paternal
despot in association with a a limited demo-
cracy. The Girls' Guild meets every Satur-
day afternoon. It has no rules. 'I am the
rule,' said Mr. Reaney. There are wardens,
and occasionally there is a consultation of
the whole Guild, moral discipline on the
members being exercised by the vote of
the whole Guild High moral standards are
set up, and the children are taught that there
is a prettiness superior to physical beauty.
Different classes of boys are mixed up to-
gether in the Guilds, and they are encouraged
to tell of cases of sickness and starvation,
and to give the reports of visits paid by
themselves to such cases. For the young
women pleasant social meetings are arranged
both on weekdays and Sundays. In the
pastor's parlour, fitted as a drawing room,
the young children are received sometimes,
The senior Guild of young men is encouraged
to hold theological discussions of the freeest
order. Even an atheist was courteously and
tenderly treated by them; and when the
poor fellow died, we of the Guild who had
known him, said Mr. Reaney, could not
help feeling that, in spite of his doubts, he
had gone to God. Clubs for gymnastics,
cricket, and football, a band, a singing-
class, a shop in which lads can be taught
iron and wood work—form adjuncts of
the Guild. In fact, added Mr. Reaney,
as long as the pastor is Prime Minister
in the Guild anything can be done."
The conditions of society are of course diffe-
rent in these colonies to those in England ;
but the same necessity of providing some-
thing to permanently influence the young for
good is felt here as at home, and in view of
the declension of the young from Church and
Sunday-school, it behoves our Churches to
consider what is best to be done to meet the
growing need of the day. Dr. Be van is
trying a praiseworthy experiment in connec-
tion with his Church in Collins-street, the
development and issue of which will be
watched with considerable interest by all
who are concerned in the welfare of the
young. He has formed or is on the eve of
forming a Young Men's Club or Institute,
the object of which is to draw young men
together, to provide intellectual and inno-
cent amusement for them, and to make them
feel that they are being thought of and cared
for. Without for one moment criticising the
movement, I may be permitted to express the
fear that the effort will not be attended with
much success if it is left to work out its own
salvation. Not merely the officebearers
but the influential members of the Church
must evince a direct personal interest
in the institution. They should be constant
visitors at the rooms, and should lay hold of
the members, inviting them to their homes,
and bringing their own influence and the
influence of a bright ingleside to bear upon
them. A Church is too impersonal, and
Church officers are apt to partake of the
same character, so that the work must not
be left wholly to them. What is wanted is
more individual workers after the type of the
disciple Andrew more earnest-minded
fishers of men. If Dr. Be van is successful in
getting a number of his leading members to
take a lively concern in his club, and if each
of them does what he can to sway at least
one young soul, the good that will ensue
therefrom none but the Infinite Father will
be able to measure. Such efforts are tides on
the sea of influence, which have no reflux,
and which will swell and swell until they
are absorbed in the great ocean of eternity.
There is no need for any parade of religion.
A quiet, consistent Christian example with
the influence of a loving, happy home will do
more with most young men to win them over


to Christ than the more direct teaching and
preaching which are usually employed. I
speak feelingly on this point, for it was due to
one such home that I was led to espouse the
Christian profession, and I am sure multi-
tudes of young men might almost uncon-
sciously to themselves be drawn into the
same cause if Christly men who have comfort-
able homes would deny themselves a little,
and make it a matter of duty to extend their
hospitality and the influence of their family
life to some of their younger brethren. There
are affinities in the mental and spiritual as
well as in the chemical world, and aman cannot
mix with a number of young men for many
evenings without coming into contact with
one here and there towards whom he feels
specially drawn, and upon whom he might
exercise a powerful influence for good if he
would try to do it in the way indicated. The
Church has a right to demand such help as
this. It cannot, I know, be rendered with-
out much self-denial; but if, as Mr.
Chalmers, that noble hero-missionary, put it
the other day—if we had more of God's
sympathy for man and if we had more of
Christ's own enthusiasm for the salvation of
man we would not hesitate to give it.
The work of regenerating the world must not
be left to those who are placed over us in holy
things, nor to any one section of the Church;
the call to duty comes to each and all of us
who profess to be followers of the Master.
We are all ministers of His, and we must see
to it that we discharge the responsibility that
is cast upon us. Thus, and thus only, shall
we be successful in stemming the tide of evil,
and helping on the great cause we have in
view, namely, the uplifting of the race and its
gradual inclusion in the Great Father's fold.
The discussion on the papers was deferred
until Wednesday evening.
COLONIAL COLLEGES.
A discussion on this question, which was
introduced on Friday, was resumed by the
Rev. W. R. FLETCHER, who read the follow-
ing paper:—" The questions involved in the
subject on which I have undertaken to give
you a few thoughts is one of immense im-
portance to all the colonies represented in
this Conference. As we consider them it is
probable that we are all agreed upon what
we should like to accomplish, but are not by
any means agreed upon the way in which we
should seek to bring about our wishes. We
are probably all at one on these points which
I clearly name, so that there may be no
misunderstanding. 1. The standard of
ministerial training should be maintained as
high as practicable. In this age, in which
knowledge is so very widely extended, and
in which the bearing of all the sciences upon
Biblical and theological questions is so keenly
felt and so widely acknowledged, we all feel
that our ministers ought to be men abreast of
the times. Our teachers should understand
what they teach, or if that be not always
possible they should know enough to know
how limited is the knowledge of any of us
compared with that which is unknown. 2.
We should not shut the door against those
who are fitted to do good service to our
Churches, but who from various circum-
stances are unable to pass the highest desir-
able standard. A man may be a good and
useful preacher who is nevertheless unskilled
in Greek exegesis, and who would be hope-
lessly puzzled if he tried to define the grounds
of moral obligation, or to analyze the limits
of consciousness. Nobody would think that
Moody would be any better fitted for his
peculiar work if he wrote B.A, after his
name, or would like to silence the hitherto
mute and inglorious Moodies because they
could not leap the five-barred gate of a
matriculation examination. 3. There ought
to be absolute free trade between
the colonies and with the mother
country in the exchange of students and
ministers. A young man trained in Victoria
should be as free to settle in New South
Wales as a student of Camden, and a student
of Union College should feel that the gate is
as open to him to settle in New Zealand, or
Tasmania, or Western Australia, as in South
Australia. 4. To maintain the character of
our ministry and to keep us in touch with
the work of our sister Churches in Britain it
will be advisable to invite English ministers
and English students to join our ranks. I
say this as one who has ever been anxious to
develop our colonial colleges, who has a feel-
ing of pardonable pride as he sees so many of
our own students occupying honourable and
useful stations among our Churches, and
knows that he has had some share in their
tuition. Our colonial students may be
placed alongaide an equal number of English
students, and they need not fear the com-
parison. Out of the larger number of men
who come forth from our English Colleges
the probabilities of finding one or two
who may take rank among the favoured
sons of genius is of course greater, but
taking all things into consideration
I deem that our colonially-educated
men may take their stand side by side with
their English brethren. Presuming that we
are all agreed upon these points, what is there
that stands in the way of our realizing them ?
Withregard to the first, we have the immense
advantage of having fully equipped Univer-
sities in most of the colonies. We are thus
able to follow the example of our English
Colleges, and make use of these high-class
secular institutions in providing the requisite
literary course for our young men. Our pass
degrees are equal, if not superior, to the
pass degrees of Oxford or Cambridge, though
of course in honours we are far behind.
The teaching of the professorial staff of
Australasia is the very best that can be
obtained, and there are no social and eccle-
siastical disabilities to thwart or to seduce our
Btudents. In theory the way seems plain, and
nothing seems easier than to establish a College.
Where then is the difficulty? It comes in
when we consider the second point on which
we are agreed. The young men who offer
themselves as candidates are mostly drawn
from those who have spent many years in
business since they left school, who at school
learned perhaps a little Latin which during
the intervening years has been a constantly
diminishing quantity, and who do not know
a letter of Greek. For such men to be
admitted into University classes is inx


possible. To test such men by the standard
of a degree would be very unfair. ifeTo reject
such men, if the zeal of the Lord of Hosts be in
their hearts, would be a crime against high
heaven and a robbery of the Churches.
These are the men who come before our
committees, and with whom we have to deal.
Give them four or five years of good and
wholesome mental discipline and they will
be found " workmen needing not to be
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
How to give them that training which they
need is a difficulty. It may be said that the
best way would be to prepare them for the
University, and entrust them to those learned
bodies to more fully equip them. If we were
training schoolmasters of a high class that
answer would be a good one, but a minister is
not a schoolmaster, and the education for
the two callings is quite different. A student
for the ministry must have some knowledge
of the evidences of Christianity, the peculiar
characteristics of the Greek Testament, the
course of sacred and ecclesiastical history,
and the doctrines of our holy religion. Ex-
perience tells me that very few men can carry
on the work of an undergraduate at the
University and at the same time do all that
he wishes to do as a student for the ministry.
It is more than the brain of an ordinary
young man can stand. He may try it, but
will probably break down. If he is allowed
to take his degree in peace before he begins
his proper ministerial studies we must add
two or three years to his course, even
supposing he escapes being ' plucked' or
' ploughed' in any one of his examinations.
This would lengthen his course to an in-
ordinate length. One year's preparation for
the University added to three years as an
undergraduate, and with three years' study
of theology after that, make seven years'
tuition. This for a youth of 18 is not
too long ; for a man of 23 it is a
severe tax upon his patience, and also
upon the resources of a College constituency.
Having said this much on the general
question I venture to add a few practical
suggestions which show the goal toward
which we should all be striving. Prac-
tical Suggestions.—l. Each of the colonies,
including Queensland and Tasmania, should
endeavour to establish a high-class Col-
legiate School. All our Churches in Britain
know how much they are indebted to
Mill Hill, to Tettenhall, and to Silcoates,
not only for the good education given therein
to the boys of our Nonconformist families,
but also for the way in which they have
acted as unconscious nurseries for the future
ministry. Of the boys who were with me in
that small rough Yorksbire School at Silcoates,
I need only refer to Professor Scott of Lan-
cashireColiege, Professor Simon of Edinburgh,
the Revs. J. H. Gwyther, Professor Allen,
and several others to illustrate what I mean.
The establishment of such a school has never
been attempted in Victoria or South Aus-
tralia, and both colonies have suffered loss in
conseauence. It was, I know, a doubtful
success in New South Wales, but, when I
find how it has succeeded with other religious
bodies both in Melbourne and Adelaide, I do
not see why it should not succeed with us.
To found such schools is one of the grand tradi-
tions of Puritanism. It was carried by them
over to New England. From it have arisen the
American Universities, and t to it is mainly
owing the immense influence of New England
ideas in all the States. I found that the
early missionaries of the American Board
carried this tradition to Honolulu, and one
of their first and most permanent works has
been the establishment of the Oahus;College
for the education of their own sons, the sons
of European residents, and of the more gifted
among the native youths, j Without going
into detail I do not see why such an institu-
tion should not thrive and return a fair in-
terest for money if conducted as a proprie-
tary school. The bearing of this first sug-
gestion upon the subject matter of this
paper is twofold. 1. Such schools would be
what I have called an unconscious nursery
for the future ministry. | 2. The upper forms
in such schools might be utilized for that
stage in ministeral tuition which is prepara-
tory to a collegiate education. Before leaving
the subject I would, remind you all that the
success of such schools depends very
largely not so much on the reputation
of their promoters as upon the "scholarly
Christian character of the head master.
2. Now that .liberal Universities are , estab-
lished in each of the three central colonies
they should be made use of as much as
possible. Hitherto the existence of the
matriculation examination has been a serious
dithculty in the way of many students. Some
examination like matriculation is needed as
a test for efficient teaching in private and
public schools ; but matriculation itself, that
is the privilege of entering upon a University
course of study, should be made as facile as
possible. At the University with which I
am at present connected we have resolved to
enforce no test of matriculation except such
as may be necessaryito qualify a student to
pursue his studies in any particular class.
The standard for a degree is not lowered but
rather raised by this method. In the race
for a degree the first serious„hurdle is placed
at the end of, the .first year, not at the
beginning of the course. feThis ought to make
a University more available for our purpose,
because that fuller attention .to science or
mathematics which is needful for a
degree may be., „ dispensed, with and
more time given to Greek and English.
3. The establishment Residence College
affiliated to the Universities, on the same
plan as Ormond College, Melbourne. In
such a College young men studying for any
degree might have rooms, and among them
our ministerial students might have a place.
I do not like the plan of separating our
students from the world by putting them
into cloistered homes like Airdale and Lan-
cashire. I would rather that they were in
lodgings, but better than either plan is a
proper Residence College for all classes of
students. 4. In arranging for the theological
education proper to.the ministry each colony
must take its own course. A common College
would, I fancy, fail to awaken the interest of
the Churches in the training of its local
ministry. The Churches would miss the
services of the students as lay preachers and


supplies, and I am afraid would be tardy in
responding to the appeal for the necessary
funds. Many arguments may be advanced
in favour of one College for Austral-
asia, but, however cogent, I do not think
they would find support among our people.
5. That a common Examining Board be in-
stituted independent of and supplementary to
the ordinary examiners which each College
may appoint for itself, for the purpose of
giving certificates for proficiency in Biblical
and theological studies. Oriental languages,
and mental philosophy. A move in this
direction has been made of late years in
England in the establishment of the Senatus
Academicus, which has wrought so much
good in our British Colleges. I believe this
Senatus will allow our colonial Colleges to
be affiliated with it, but I advocate in addi-
tion the establishment of a colonial Senatus.
I believe that this would do a great deal of
good in binding our separate attempts at
College education together, in making us all
better acquainted with the young men who
were studying for the ministry in our diffe-
rent Colleges, and would set up and main-
tain a higher standard of proficiency. 6. I
suggest that this common Examining Board,
or Senatus Academicus, should enter into cor-
respondence with the Council of Mansfield
College, with a view to sending occasionally
a colonial student to complete his education
under the shadow of the venerable Univer-
sity of Oxford. The prospect of being sent to
Mansfield might be held out as a prize to be
competed for as often as funds would permit,
every year or every two years, according to
circumstances. The cost of such a student
would be about £9O per year, supposing he
did not obtain a bursary or a scholarship at
Mansfield, in which case it wculd be much
less. We might lay it down as a condition
that such a student should return to one or
other of the Australian Colonies, but even if he
were left free to settle where he liked I believe
that a chivalrous gratitude to those who had
enabled him to win such a prize would prompt
him to labour among the Churches that had
sent him forth, rather than to turn his back
upon Australia. I hope that my friend Dr.
Dale, who may be looked upon as one of the
founders of Mansfield, may so enforce and
explain this idea that Mansfield may become
a means of binding the Congregational
Churches of the Australian Colonies more
closely together, and uniting them more
closely to our brethren in England."
In the course of the discussion Dr. DALE ex-
plained the position which Mansfield College
occupied in relation to the Oxford University,
and predicted that very great benefit would
accrue to the ministry as a result of the
carrying on of the institution. He was sure
that ministers from Australia would be
heartily welcomed there, and the cost of
living and other expenses need not exceed
£9O per annum.
Speakers generally considered that only
the last two of Mr. Fletcher's sugges-
tions could be acted upon, and accordingly
the following resolutions were unani-
mously passed :—" That in the opinion of
this Conference the jubilee periods of our
Congregational Churches ought not to close
without steps being taken for the establish-
ment in connection with our Congregational
Churches of high schools for boys and girls in
each of the colonies, and the Conference com-
mends the question as one of the utmost impor-
tance to each of the Congregational Unions
" That a committee be appointed to report
on the desirability of having a common
Examining Board in connection with our
several colonial Colleges, to report at the
Conference to be held in Melbourne in 1888,
such committee to consist of the Revs. Messrs.
Fletcher (convener), Gosman, and Fraser."
CHURCH WORK AT BROKEN HILL.
During the lunch hour the Rev. S.
HEBDITCH made a strong appeal on behalf of
the starting of religious work at Broken Hill,
and several subscriptions from gentlemen in
New South Wales, Victoria, and South Aus-
tralia were promised in aid of sending a
minister to the place.
OUR THEOLOGY IN ITS PRESENT
ASPECTS.
BY THE REV. G. CLARKE.
It seems right that this jubilee should not
be allowed to pass without a word about the
present aspects of our theology. I very
much wish that the task of saying that word
had been assigned to some more competent
brother, but as it is the duty has been laid
upon me, and I must do what I can to meet
the wishes of the committee. When we talk
about the present aspects of our theology we
imply that they differ from its past aspects.
Fifty years have made so great a change in
our religious thought that we may well ask
to day Where aie we, and whither are we
moving ? It is more difficult to answer such
a question now than it would have been a
generation ago. Then we had definite
systems that are now largely in solution,
and there has not been time or genius enough
for the new thoughts to crystallize into form.
In this matter we can only speak of temper
and tendency; and what I propose to do is
to show what appear to be the great currents
of thought and feeling that are sweeping us
away from the position of our fathers and
the direction in which they are carrying us.
I have to report on what I seem to see, and
if from observation I pass into comment you
will, of course, take the comment for what
it is worth. I keep to changes of drift in
the religious thought of our Churches.
It would take us too far afield to
meddle with that great outside debate of
modern unbelief that goes down to the foun-
dations of all possible religion, that rejects
altogether the idea of revelation, and "that
would make a clean sweep of all Churches
alike. That outside contention is not about
the things in which we Christians differ from
one another, but about those on which we are
all agreed. The differences that separate
Rome and Byzantium, Canterbury and
Geneva, the decree of Trent and the re-
formed confessions, the articles of the Prayer-
book and the system of the Westminster
divines, are of no account whatever in the
infidel controversy. To it we are still one in
this—that we believe in a living God and
march under the banner of a saving Christ,
and so to it we are the common enemy whom


parti-coloured forces as a whole it seeks to
put to confusion and rout. Keeping, then, to
the theology of our Churches I must still
limit the scope of our subject. Theology in
the larger sense covers all that it is possible
to know and say of God. All that revelation
of Him that is made in His works and ways,
including among these man with his natural
powers, affection, and instincts, and the
great laws of his being and well-
being, as of course theology includes
also those special revelations that are re-
corded in the Holy Scriptures, the faith that
we receive, and all the thought which plays
about that faith. I shall use the word in
its narrowest sense, meaning by theology the
theory on which we explain and vindicate
our faith, exhibit the connection of its parts
and the relation of the whole to what we
learn from observing that different order of
facts displayed in God's works and ways,
and which, as far as it goes, is as true a reve-
lation of the divine mind as that which we
receive in a careful study of the written
Word. It is necessary to make this distinction
because nothing but mischief can come to us
if we mistake or misstate the range of
thought in which we are so greatly changed,
and if we confound the things which are
shaken with what is still to us as to our
fathers a kingdom that cannot be moved.
When we talk, then, about the changed aspects
of our religious thought we shall be liable, I
say, to make a very mischievous impression
unless we are careful to separate between
our faith and what I here call our
theology. The one is a divine and constant
thing, the other is a human and variable
thing. They stand to each other in the
relation of text and comment, of testimony
and inference, of revelation and philo-
sophy. The verities that are of God are
one thing, the thought which plays about
these verities is another thing. Recognising
the difference, we have first to ask the very
serious question, Have the last fifty years
changed the faith of our Churches ? I do not
say its definitions, I do not say in the putting
of emphasis on one part more than on another,
I do not say in our sense of perspective and
proportion, but have we departed in any way
from its substance ? With the most earnest
desire to be simply true, I maintain that we
have not, and I think that this is a time
when we should say so. We are not removed
to another gospel than that which our
fathers received. I am speaking of the
Churches generally, and without taking
account of such erratic exceptions as may be
found in any Church. Look at what the
heart of our faith is. The great attributes of
the power, wisdom, unchangeableness, and
eternity of the Most High are perhaps shown
more impressively in His works than any
statement in words could make them, and
Christianity only holds these thoughts of
God in common with other religions or
philosophies. Long before the time of the
New Testament men had learned them, and
much also of God's moral perfections; nor
can we see that there was any need to make
them the subject of any fresh revela-
tion. But taking all these common concep-
tions of God for granted, as to the
rest theology is emphatically for us ChrisJ
tology. God in Christ is our God. In Jesus
of Nazareth we read a disclosure of the
Father's relations of affection to his human
children such as had not been made even to
the wisest and best of the older dispensation.
All our Churches believe in the Christ as he
is presented to us in the writings*of the New
Testament—one whom 1,900 years ago men
heard with their ears and saw with their
eyes, and who was handled by their hands.
Our faith is rooted in facts of history, and
not in any wisdom of our own speculation.
We take our stand, as our fathers did, on
the sacred Record, and the veritable Jesus of
Nazareth who spoke, and acted, and lived,
and died, and rose again, as the gospels
testify, is still for us the Son of God and the
Son of Man, the Sovereign and Saviour of
our race, the atoning sacrifice for our sins,
the object of our fullest trust, reverence, and
love—the one being, through all history, in
whom the real and the ideal of man are abso-
lutely the same, who was and is God mani-
fest in the flesh, and man repealed in the
perfectest image of God. For us this is not
in the least a matter of speculation, but of
faith. It rests upon testimony of the truth
of which for many converging reasons
we are thoroughly assured. We are not,
indeed, much given to trouble ourselves with
subtle definitions, after the manner of the
Athanasian creed, nor do we claim the
ability to explore or explain the transcen-
dent mystery of the interior relations of
Godhead, or to separate and balance by our
philosophy the exact functions of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit; but it is of the
very life of our faith that we accept without
reserve the personal ciaims of its Author and
Object; what He said of His relations to
God, and of His relations to man, and of
man's relations to Him. We are sure that
the apostles were qualified to tell the truth
about their Master, and did tell it. We see
plainly that He is the centre round whom
all their teachings resolve ; that they bear
witness of Him, and not merely of what He
said and did ; while it is equally plain to us
that they ground all hope of man's salvation
and the working of a new spirit in human
life upon the great facts of His personal
history. This and more than this I take
to be the faith of the Churches at large to-
day. Whateverlit may be to others it is not
for us an open question, and I do not think
that we are in the least disposed to tamper
with the Christian tradition. Therefore I
protest that we are not to be counted
traitors to the faith once delivered to the
saints because we draw a sharp distinction
between divine verities and human opinions,
or because we demur to some of the defini-
tions of philosophic divines fifty or 300 or
1,000 years ago, we draw other
inferences than those of venerable systems of
thought, or because we express our faith in
other forms and phrases than those which
commendedj.themselves to our fathers and
grandfathers. So much I have thought it
fitting to say, because to construe our change
of speculative thought into a change of our
religious faith is to do us grievous wrong and
to shake all trust in our teaching to the very


foundations. And yet even in regard to our
proper faith we do not hold it exactly as we
did fifty years ago. The substance of what
we believe is not changed, but our manner of
presenting it is greatly altered. We have a
different sense of the relation and proportion
of its contents. Beholding the same objects
as our fathers did, we see them in different
perspective. Some things that they com-
paratively slighted we deem to be of great
importance, and some which they put into
the front rank we put into the second, or the
third, or the last. We cannot with our fathers
make the fall of Adam and the federal theory of
our part in it, the foundation of our knowledge
of Christ and of His salvation. We lay far
greater stress than they did on Christ's reve-
lation of God as our Father. We put the
Gospels, which present do us the very image
of the Christ, and record His words and
deeds, before the argument of St. Paul's
Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians,
and we make very much more of the man
Christ Jesus than when His humanity was so
overshadowed by the doctrine of His
Divinity that the impression of his real one-
ness with our race was in fact made much
more feeble than it ought to be. On the
whole then my conviction is that the proper
faith of our Churches has not changed in
substance, though it has changed in expres-
sion and emphasis during the fifty years that
we have met to celebrate. From our faith I
Ease on to what I call our theology. And
ere I can imagine some one saying—Why
should we have a theology at all ? Why can
we not be content with holding the several
articles of our faith ? My answer is that so
long as the human mind is what it is we
cannot help having a theology. The appre-
hension of separated truths would not lift us
far above the creatures that are beneath us.
We are less than men if we take no
account of their relations. The reason
which God has given us compels us,
whether we think of the process or not, to
put one set of truths by the side of another
set of truths, to articulate them in some way,
to seek for their underlying unity, to appre-
hend in them an order, and to infer from the
whole more or less certain conclusions. We
may do it very badly, but do it in some
fashion we must, and at best we can do it
very partially, because we see only a part of
God's ways. We may be wider, but we are
not more clear and vigorous thinkers
than our fathers, and it would ill become us to
put scorn on their splendid efforts to present
in a scheme of thought the ways of God as
they apprehended them. Nevertheless, it is
apparent enough that one great change which
the last fifty years has wrought among is the
revolt of our day against the tyranny of ela-
borate confessions and formulated systems of
divinity. It has swept us far away from the
position of our fathers. It is a revolt against
what was still a living power when the Queen
ascended the throne—a revolt which was
begun by a few, which slowly extended
to _ the many, and which now, I
believe, embraces nearly all the serious
thoughts of to-day. True it is that
most of the Churches we know still retain
9uch elaborate and venerable confessions,
and require assent to them at least from
those who are in office. These confessions
stand in close relation to the controversies
of the time when they were formulated,
and they are very composite in their struc-
ture. They 6mbody what are properly state-
ments of the faith, but they also contain a
mass of human theory and explanation that
defines how and why the faith is to be held ;
and they put the Divine and the human all
on the same level of binding power. They
are forms of conception part of metal and
part of clay. They entomb much philosophy
that is long since dead, much exegesis that
no modern scholar would accept, much
assumption that no thoughtful man of our
day would allow to pass unchallenged ; also,
they ignore some of the greatest difficulties
in the history of man, and they are made
symmetrical by dealing only with parts and
sections of what is revealed in the Bible,
while they are not much concerned about
harmonizing that with the revelations of God
in his visible works, even to the extent that
these revelations must be allowed. These
confessions were alive once in every part of
them, and they expressed tne most profound
and robust thought of the age that gave them
birth. But they stand in no such living
relation to the convictions of our time. To-
day it involves no slight strain on the con-
science of intelligent, upright, and honour-
able men to accept them in their integrity.
Yet somehow they contrive to do so by regard-
ing assent to them as a mere matter of
conventional and ecclesiastical usage. Ido
not wish to say a word that carries the
slightest taint of slander on good men who
can reconcile themselves to difficulties of
subscription that seem to me insuperable, but
this I must say that the celebrated Tract
XC. started a movement in the nation that, I
think, has been most disastrous to the public
confidence in our observance of the engage-
ments that some have contracted. It seems
to me to have seriously sapped the reputation
of the Christian ministry, and it has worked
for evil far beyond the limits of the Church
of England. A straightforward amendment
or rejection would have commanded universal
respect. To evade the manifest purpose of a
binding declaration, to make that hazy
which was meant for sharpest definition, and
that loose which was intended to secure unity
of belief, and to play at shuttlecock with the
literal and grammatical sense of words and
phrases—to do this neatly and adroitly has
become one of the fine arts of our time. It is
a very sorry business. We have got so
accustomed to it that it has ceased to shock
us. No one thinks now of taking a man to
task for his doubt or denial or disregard of
many things that his confession affirms. Even
where the question of what is established by
statute law is concerned, prosecutions for
heresy are utterly hateful to this generation.
Self-absolution from the restraint of a bind-
ing power is not only tolerated, but ap-
plauded. It indicates, at any rate, a great
revolt, for that must be a strong repulsion
indeed which makes good men more willing
to bear the utmost strain of couscience than
to take the terms of their engagement in the
sense with which they were imposed by their


original framers, and the natural meaning of
which can only be set aside by what it is not
too hard to call tortuous ways of interpreta-
tion. Now, it is quite true that we Indepen-
dents fifty years ago would not bind our-
selves any more than now to a formulated
creed defining and imposing a belief for all
our Churches; but it is also true that we
were, in fact, under a very stringent yoke of
theological system. The popular feeling of our
Churches allowed no man to shake it off with
impunity. We were Calvinists. We fol-
lowed generally the method of the great
reformer, though, under the shelter of
honoured names, we ventured to modify
some of the subordinate details of his
scheme. We had our carefully drawn out
charts of divine government and plans
of salvation, and they were such
that it seemed easier to learn the
mind of Christ from them than from him.
They dominated our interpretation of the
sacred record. Practically I am afraid it
often came to this, that the human system
was the textbook and the Bible a book of
texts to prove it. But fifty years ago there
were already signs of restiveness among our
younger men. They saw that these schemes
of the Divine administration put in much
that was questionable and left out much that
was important, that the analogy of human
government was pushed so far as to transfer
the imperfections of our ignorance to the
infinitely wise God, and that the very fictions
of human law were invoked to explain the
rule of Him whose judgment is always and
only according to truth. Above all, they saw
that the method of pitiless logic, working on
the letter of doubtful texts, drawing in-
ferences from them, and inferences from those
inferences in long succession, often led to
conclusions that were morally monstrous.
They resented the hard, dogmatic way
in which they were used as tests
of a man's fidelity to Christ, and
chafed at the restraint that they put
upon the large preaching of His holy Gospel.
They felt that as to the final verdict of
theology on any given subject the natural
conscience, the general drift of Scripture
teaching, the spirit of man, and the Spirit of
Christ in a man all had a voice as potent as
logic, and that if any process of reasoning
landed men in a conclusion against which
these primary and Christian instincts re-
volted, ic could be no one's duty to accept it.
For instance, it traverses our moral sense
when we take the sovereignty of the Divine
Will in such a meaning as that it shall make
justice the creature of power, or when we so
represent man's inability as to deny his power
of choice and yet hold him responsible for
doing what he cannot help doing. Assuming
some things about the physical transmission
of sin, combined with a given interpretation
of certain texts, it can be shown by the most
rigorous deduction that original sin has
made the salvation of infants dying unbap-
tized impossible, and their eternal misery
inevitable, and so on. There was good
reason to distrust a method which
forced the human mind to such
appalling results, though it was not so
easy to defy it then as it is to-day. The
great Dr. Chalmers was not a man_ whom
any one would suspect of undervaluing the
scientific theology of his day, and yet he
sometimes felt it to be a sore hindrance
rather than a grateful help to earnest piety.
In his Sabbath Readings there are many
such passages as this " Open up my way,
O God ; remove all the obstructions which an
artificial theology has laid upon it; bring me
into direct contact and communication with
Thy Bible; and throwing aside the argu-
ments and the articles of a controversial
divinity, let me from this time forward take
my guidance and obtain all my supplies both
of encouragement and of wisdom afresh from
the fountain-head of Thine own Word." So
the process of disintegration began with the
younger men of our own Churches, and the
revolt has grown and grown until perhaps
many of us have gone too far on the other
side, and are ready to think systems
of divinity altogether valueless, and
are disposed to treat with scorn
what was after all the most pious,
patient, and profound thinking of
former times. The dialect; in which most
of our ministers preached fifty years ago
would sound very strange in the ears of this
generation, and their battle cries have no
more power to stir the blood of a congrega-
tion to-day than the questions that were
debated in the Jewish Talmud 2,000 years
ago. Even the slightly softened Calvinism
which was dominant in our Churches half a
century since is now so nearly dead that
hardly a minister among us, unless he is very
young, would care to waste a sermon on
smiting it another blow. No doubt we have
gained much by our deliverance from the
thraldom of oppressive systems, but 1 venture
to think that we have lost much too. Our
fathers were at any rate stalwart men, and
had in them a toughness of metal and moral
fibre that is not too common among their
children. They were not slippery, but what
they held to be the truth of God they held
with manly grip. The drill and discipline of
those days was a very girding-up of the loins
of the mind, and it made many homely people
in our congregations hard, patient, coherent
thinkers, who utterly scorned the soft and
sentimental way that has no backbone of
conviction to stiffen it, and that makes a man
as flabby as a mollusc. The enjoyed dis-
courses that even strained their powers
of apprehension—doctrinal sermons that
on account of their demand on thought
would empty most of our Churches in a fort-
night. They had an awful sense of God and
of the urgent necessity of knowing and doing
His will. They believed in a divine order of
truth that might be reflected in human ap-
prehension, and they thought the study of
that order a duty that was second only to the
culture of all Christian goodness. Are there
many left of this sturdy breed among our
hearers to-day ? We do not want to restore
the old tyranny, and we know well that any
scheme we could devise must be but a partial
and provisional representation of the ways
of God ; but do we not sorely want such a
reconstruction of systematic divinity as shall
at least bring back to us something of the
| drill and the discipline that we have lost ?


Another current, silently but profoundly
affecting our whole theology, is the great and
growing change in our conception of the
Bible. Without denying the possibility that
some book, in any case of very inferior inte-
rest, may have been wrongly placed in our
accepted canon, it is enough to say broadly
that we still hold the Scriptures of the Old
and New Testaments to be generically diffe-
rent from all other writings that claim to
be accounted sacred. They, and they
alone, so far as we know, record genuine and
special communications of the will of God to
men, imparting truths other than we could
lean from our observation of His works, and
transcending anything that by our philosophy
we could have discovered for ourselves. We
do not doubt that the writers of the Bible
were under divine impulse and providential
guidance in the matter and the manner of
their record, or that they spoke and wrote
as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. We
are sure that these Scriptures are holy, that
they are able to make us wise unto salvation,
and that all men should come to them with
open mind, with deep reverence, and with
prayerful solicitude to know the things that
pertain to life and godliness. For us, too,
quite as much as for our fathers, the supreme
interest of these sacred books is the testi-
mony which they give concerning the Christ.
In the Old Testament it is the testimony of
preparation; in the gospels it is the testi-
mony of personal exhibition; and in the
rest of the New Testament it is the testimony
of revising comment and exposition, showing
how that personal manifestation bears upon
the deliverance the duty and the destiny of
the human race. All this was the con-
viction of our fathers fifty years ago as
it is ours; but they supported it by a
theory of mechanical inspiration intended to
fortify our reverence for the Holy Word. We
now see that the theory is too rigid for the
facts, and that so far from being a defence it
exposes the Bible all through to easy and
fatal assault. Calvin was the first great
theologian to formulate this theory as an
article of the faith 1,500 years after the last
of the sacred Books was written. In the
great unsettlement of the Reformation he
feared for the foundations, and against the
dogma of a literally infallible Church he set
up the dogma of a literally infallible Book.
Not content with accepting the Bible as the
Word of God he declared that all its words
were the words of God, and that man had no
more to do with its composition than the
penman who writes a letter at the dictation
of his master. And so at the beginning of
the Queen's reign it was almost universally
taught in our Churches that the Bible is the
voice of God and nothing else from beginning
to end as truly as if every sentence had been
spoken from heaven. Consequently it was
held to be infallible in every jot and tittle of
its contents—infallible in the letter as well
as in the spirit, in its statements of reli-
gious truth as well as in its circum-
stantial references to what lay outside the
proper province of religion. Of course on
such a theory to prove the Bible in error on
any one of these extraneous points is logically
to overthrow its whole authority; and on
that theory the discoveries of Galileo in the
sixteenth century must either be denied or
there is an end of our religion. More and
more intelligent and devout believers in our
day are looking at the Bible in a different
light. We see more clearly now that it is a
revelation of man as well as a revelation of
God, and that it is emphatically a record of
God's working in the history of living men.
If it told us only what God had spoken from
heaven we should had one thing, namely, the
divine thought, as when it was written on
the tables of stone ; but what we really find
is another thing, namely, the thought of God
in contact with the thought and experience
of man. We have not the divine word pure
and simple, but with it a historical disclosure
of the way in which it was received by and in
which it wrought upon successive generations
of men. The inspiration of divine teaching,
the response of human feeling, and the way
in which it affected human action are all
blended together, and it is this combination
that marks off the Bible from all other
religious books, as for instance the Koran,
and that makes it an appeal of
permanent interest and living power.
The hard, inflexible theory of inspiration
that we can hold no longer practically put
on the same level the earliest and the latest
books in the sacred collection, though they
are separated from each other by more than
1,000 years of religious experience, and it
failed to take due account of the record as a
growing disclosure of the mind of God. We
see more clearly that it exhibits a progress
both of divine doctrine and discipline care-
fully graded in its successive parts to the in-
crease of receptive power in each new gene-
ration. To us the Bible is not a lake, but a
river. The divine communications gather
depth and breadth and volume as they go
on, and it is idle tc look in the Book of
Genesis for the fulness of grace and truth
set before us in the Gospel of St. John.
What we have is a slow disclosure of truth
and duty, necessarily defective in its earliest
stages, and perfect only in its latest, begin-
ning with light that was feeble and faint,
waxing brighter and brighter as the eyes of
men were trained to bear it, and clearing at
last into the perfect day of the excellency of
the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.
The unity of plan and purpose that binds
the whole series and succession of the
divine oracles into one is analogous to
the unity that connects the stages of
growth by which we pass on through infancy
and childhood and youth to complete man-
hood, or that joins on in one process of edu-
cation the simple rudiments of the Kinder-
garten and the highest attainments of the
finished scholar. In every stage of progress
in knowledge we drop something of the pre-
ceding stage, and lay aside some portion of
its accommodative dress, while we retain the
heart of the truth which it taught us and
carry it further on. This is a conception of
th 6 Bible that accords with everything that
we know of God's works and ways. They
are all progressive. They advance from
littleness and deficiency to the stature and
completeness they are destined to attain, and
often to our apprehension they do so very


slowly. We may wish it had been different.
We may fancy that it might be even more
divine to dispense with delay and to produce
the designed perfection at once, but plainly He
who ordained the process of growth in all His
works and in all His discipline has deter-
mined otherwise. On the whole it is a dif-
ferent way of looking at the Bible from that
to which our fathers were accustomed, and it
compels us to apply its teachings differently,
while at the same time it sweeps from our
path a host of difficulties which must always
besetithose who stand on the whole as if it were
a level platform and not what it is—a gradual
ascent in the knowledge of God, and of duty,
and of destiny. Once more. Calvin's theory
of inspiration, which down to my younger
days was still the theory of our Churches,
made the Bible answer with its life
for the correctness of the natural science.
_With our changed conception no such burden
is put upon it. The Bible was not intended
to teach science, but religion. It did not
anticipate the discoveries of these latter
days. It spoke to the science of early gene-
rations and as things appeared to the eyes of
men in the olden time. It would have de-
feated its purpose if it had done otherwise.
It spoke of the sun as rising in the east and
setting in the west. It spoke of the earth as
a central extended and immovable platform
sustained on pillars, and overarched by the
rounded firmament which was not after all so
very far above us. It spoke of the stars as if
they were created to be ministering and
attendant lights on the world of man. It
might have used words more true to our
modern notions of science. It might; but
then where would have been your Bible?
W ho among the generations of the past could
possibly have understood it ? It would simply
have confounded human faculty, heaped up
insurmountable difficulty, arrested human
research, and drawn men off entirely from
that way of knowing God that comes by
humble and patient observation of His
visible works and ways. It is plain that the
tendency of our changing views is greatly to
reduce if not altogether to remove the fric-
tion between scientific discovery and re-
corded revelation. Nothing can be more un-
happy than the terms on which students in
these two realms have stood to each other.
It is a melancholy fact that whatever con-
cessions the Church has made to science have
been wrung from it when resistance was no
longer possible. Science as far as it goes is
as true an exponent of the mind of God as
any that we can conceive. Its ascertained
facts are as certain as anything that it is
possible for us to know. The theories and
speculations of scientific men that play about
the facts are quite another thing, and we
may well refuse to put them on the same
ground as the verities round which they re-
volve. Science cannot touch that range of
things which transcends all human discovery,
and about which the Bible is most concerned.
For these natural science has no instruments
of research and no tests of verification. And
one thing it is jwell to remember. No
passible discovery in the order of nature is of
the least avail to alter or annul a real fact of
history. The fact, for instance, that Jesus
Christ lived His life 2,000 years ago cannot
be made no fact by any observation iu the
realm of matter. Science may modify our
estimate of a fact, but a thing once done is
done, and no power in the universe can make
it other than it really was. Our interpreta-
tion of some things, especially in the earliest
records of the Bible, may have to be revised.
We may have to read the first chapters of
Genesis as presenting objects to us in some
measure after the manner of vision 01 parable,
but nothing can take out of that old-world
hymn of the creation the sublime teaching
by which it is distinguished from all the
myths of heathen cosmogony, that sun and
moon and; earth and stars are not gods, but
only the works of God, that He was before
the whole frame of visible things, that He
is more than the sun of all the objects and
all the forces of the universe, that the order
of the worid is His order and altogether
good, that man is the highest of His earthly
works, being made in His own image, and
that He Himself is above all as well as in
all and through all, God blessed for ever.
The third and last great change that I notice
in our religious thought is the effect upon it
of the softer temper that is characteristic of
our time. There is good and evil in it, and
therefore I say our softer rather than our
humaner temper. In so far as it is humaner
we cannot say anything too good about it;
but in so far as it is only softer we can
hardly say anything too bad. Indeed, if I
mistake not, it is just here, in the tendency
to confound the two things, that one of our
greatest dangers lies. The devil confessed,
with horns and hoofs and bestial mien, is not
a very formidable personage to Christian
men, but the devil, disguised, and draped in
charity, with sweet, angel face, and gentle
accents and tender ways, telling us of evil
that it does not matter much, may well be
feared by the best of us. That a great
softening has come over us, ana that we are
more sensitive to our own pain, and more
sympathetic with the suffering of others than
our fathers were, no one, I think, will deny.
Of course in some respects it has worked
most beneficently, but not in all. We may
be softened all round and all through, and
down to our very bones until we
are too limp to walk erect as men.
Unless we are careful the temper of which I
am speaking may reduce our religious love
from the most moral robust and manly
affection of which we are capable to a thing of
as poor a quality as the fondness of an
indulgent parent which sacrifices the future
and substantial good of the child for the
sake of sparing him and himself the pain
and trouble of the moment. We may water
down the very wine of life to the washiest
sentimentalism. It may indispose us to look
the sterner facts of moral government in the
face. We may get so latitudinarian in our
broadness as to become tolerant of things that
should set our moral indignation aflame, and
so relaxed in our feeling as to lose all sense
of urgency in pressing upon men the instant
need of repentance toward God and faith
in the Lord Jesus Christ. Take, for instance,
the stress that we have come to lay upon the
universal Fatherhood of God, and the conse


que it brotherhood of man. It is a great and
blessed truth. God is the Father of us all,
and, therefore, we are to see in all men, how-
ever low they may have sunk, our real
brothers. He is the Father of the prodigal
still, though the younger son has gone " into
a far country, and wasted his substance in
riotous living." It is the Father still who,
while the son " was yet a great way off, saw
him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell
on his neck and kissed him." He has
not ceased to care for us because we have
ceased to care for Him. A blessed truth
again, I say, if we only know how to use it.
Hut it plainly needs most careful handling.
It is possible for us so to hold or to present
it as to dissolve every attribute of the divine
nature into pity, until it is little better than
the weakness that we call in ourselves good
nature, making Him one on whose indulgence
we may lightly count, even though we choose
the ways of sin and pay no regard to the
urgency with which He calls us to turn from
evil to good, and are careless about His
warnings not to neglect His great salvation.
We may use the truth of His universal
Fatherhood in such a way as to swamp all
that is distinctive in the doctrine that per-
vades the New Testament, namely, that there
is a sense in which some men are His children
as other men are net His children ; some to
whom the Incarnate Word, because " they
received Him," gave " the right to become
the children of God, even to them that
believe on His name." The solitary text
which St. Paul quoted from a heathen poet,
" For we are also His offspring," may be
made to do duty for "Ye must be born
again," just as the Apostle's word
to Cornelius, " In every nation he
that feareth Him and worketh
righteousness is accepted of Him" may be so
expounded as to make it seem of small con-
sequence whether men are converted to the
definite faith of Christ or not. Then, again,
it has no doubt been a great gain to us that
we have learned to give closer heed to the
real humanity of the Lord Jesus Christ than
was common with our fathers; but it, too,
has its serious perils. What it may run to
you may see in the namby-pamby of many of
our popular hymns, that positively drivel with
fondling terms addressed to the Lord of All,
such as we should not dare to use towards
our equals in the closest intimacies of life.
Fancy our fathers singing them! Can any-
thing be more painful to true reverence
than the maudlin way in which good people
allow themselves to speak of One who with
all His tenderness was and is the Awful,
Majestic, and Eternal Son of God ? And yet
their phraseology is regarded as even super-
latively evangelical! We see, too, how this
softness works in whole volumes of sermons
that tell us much of the gentle Jesus, but
almost nothing of the kingly Christ, and the
very preaching of the Cross is of such a
sensuouß and sentimental cast that it hardly
even touches the moral conscience and the
practical will. I hold that the difference in
meaning and effect is not measurable between
preaching Jesus crucified and preaching Christ
crucified. We must know from what height
the sufferer stooped before we can estimate
the greatness of his condescension and the
strength of his love or the extremity of
human need that it met, nor can we other-
wise understand why the atoning death of
Christ should be charged with such a weight
of meaning by all the writers of the New
Testament and by Himself. One more illus-
tration of the working of this softened temper
both for good and evil, and I will bring this
trying deliverance to a close. It has greatly
affected all our thoughts of human destiny,
especially in regard to the countless millions
of every generation who have lived and died
in overwhelming disadvantage, or who have
never had the offer of Christ's salvation made
to them. The Bible plainly declares that
there will be after this life a revelation of the
righteous judgment of God on all who have
sinned persistently against the light that was
in them —the heathen against his light and
the Jew against hi 3, and the Christian against
his. That sin is much more dreadful in itself
and in its results than we have ever realized —
that the sense of God's displeasure when fully
awakened, and the consciousness that we de-
serve it, must be more terrible than any other
evil that we can experience, that separation
from the good and association with the bad is
as dark a moral fate as we can conceive, and
that the apprehension that what we might
have received and enjoyed has been rejected
and lost by our wickedness and folly is a
depth of sadness beyond which we cannot
think—all this is plainly put as being within
the possibilities of the future of any of us.
But upon this foundation there has been built
a superstructure of horrible imagination that
turns the mystery of life and the glory of God
Himself into a darkness that has no counter-
part in any eclipse of the natural world.
Here we are by no choice of our own. We
had no opportunity to accept or to refuse the
terms and conditions of our being. Life and
its environment, with all its responsibilities
and perils, and with all its possible issues, has
been thrust upon us by no will of our own—
and this is what was said of it:—God, who is
above all things just and good—the God of
whom the apostle tells us that He is love —
has given life to countless millions in every
generation, and put them on a probation in
which failure was inevitable, though He
devised means to save an infinitesimal minority
from the universal wreck. For the rest—that
is nearly for the whole—they were not given
the chance of knowing Him, nor were they
even warned of the tremendous doom that
threatened them. That doom was nothing
less than that they should be kept
in conscious existence as long as that
of God Himself, in one of literally end-
less sin and endless suffering. And yet we
were told that the Power which subjected
the race to such an appalling destiny has a
right to the homage of conscience and the
worship of love, being no other than the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who of old
proclaimed Himself gracious and merciful;
slow to anger and of great kindness; the
Lord who is good to all, and whose tender
mercies are over all His works. As I inti-
mated before, the great revolt against the
tyranny of doctrinal systems arose, partly
from the feeling that a true theology must be


the product of the heart as well as of the
head; of the living conscience also, and of
that mind within us that was in Christ
Jesus. What truth, justice, and love are
in men that they are also in God, differing
only as the imperfect and finite must differ
from the perfect and infinite. If not, then the
Bible is mocking us all through, and any
moral apprehension of God at all is not
within our capacity. It is impossible to
reconcile such a dread issue of life with
any representation of God as a Father,
true and just in all His ways, loving
and tender towards all His works.
It is a wonder to us how good men could
persuade themselves that they really held this
doctrine and yet could go through life buying
and selling, eating and drinking, laughing and
playing, marrying and giving in marriage
children! Why, humanity itself would
dictate that the sooner the race was
ended the better, and the sternest
discipline of the monks of the Thebaid
would be the only rational course for
all mankind. Most of us I imagine reject
it to-day because we are convinced that
it simply effaces all that is worshipful in
God. But now the danger comes. Beyond
our rejection of this fearful dogma, and oe-
yond what I have stated, and what I think
we all accept as the teaching of Scripture
about future retribution, the rest is only
speculative theory. It does not become us
to be over positive about our forecast of a
future for the vast majority of our race where
the Bible gives no plain and clear intimation,
and above all we have need to take care that
in our recoil from the old theory we do not
break the force of that urgency of present
salvation which is always represented as
pressing upon all of us here and now. Let us
see to it that we do not quench the old
passion and relax the old strenuousness
which gave intensity to the message of St.
Paul, of Wesley, and Whitfield, and many
others. Be ye reconciled to God. Thus,
then, I have tried to tell you how the present
aspects of our theology present them-
selves to my mind. We are not changed,
I think, as to the substance of the evangeli-
cal faith, though we hold its contents in a
different proportion and express them in
different phrase than that which commended
them to our fathers. But we have drifted
into a great revolt against the authority of
systems that they held to be second only to
the written Word ; we have a different con-
ception of the Bible aB a whole than that of
fifty years ago, and both for good and evil
we have been greatly affected by the softer
temper that has slowly grown upon us. Our
feeling to-day is that we too, like our fathers,
only know in part, and we prophesy in part;
but when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away.
. . . And through all our changes of specu-
lative thought we remember that there
abideth faith, hope, charity—these three—
and that the greatest of these is charity."
CHRISTIAN UNION AS AFFECTED
BY A SCIENTIFIC CHRISTIAN
THEOLOGY.
BY THE REV. T. ROSEBY, M.A., LL.D., BAL-
LARAT.
No one acquainted with scientific litera-
ture can fail to be struck by the marked
contrast between it and the literature of
ecclesiasticism and theology. Scientific en-
quiries are pursued by a method which at
length puts an end to controversy. The dis-
cussion falls away into matters of curious or
incidental interest only. The only con-
troversy about the infinitesimal calculus is
whether Newton invented it or Leibnitz.
The only controversy about the planet
Neptune is whether the merit of
its discovery belongs to Leverrier or
Adams. There are no conflicting schools
on the subjects of dynamics, or physics, or
chemistry, or astronomy. Geology is becom-
ing more and more an exact science ; so is
biology. We know, of course, there are still
great outstanding questions—hardly yet
resolved—in biology. But the conflict in
that region is a waning conflict. There are
many signs that the battle is drawing to a
close. For there is perfect agreement among
scientific men as to the method of resolving
these residual questions. And the issue,
without a doubt, will be the general accep-
tance by scientific men of a theory of
life and of the history of life which in its
main features will remain as unquestioned
as the Copernican system in astronomy, the
law of gravitation in physics, and the unifor-
mitarian theory in geology. Even in politics
by the partial adoption of the same method,
there is being established a scheme of ordered
thought—a complexus of principles—which
promises to raise political economy to the
rank of a true science. Already the
Ricardian doctrine of rent, the theory
of values and of exchanges, the function
of money, are principles recognised as
ascertained and verified beyond controversy.
But how different it is in the realm of
theology. It is true that the violence of the
controversial temper is very much abated.
But the controversies themselves remain.
They remain and multiply. The Victorian
era has been marked by the disruption of
the great Church of Scotland, by the split-
ting up of Methodism into I know not
how many sections, and by the separa-
tion, along intersecting cleavage lines, of
all the sects of Christendom, into more
or less conflicting schools of thought.
There are not only more denominations, but
there is less agreement of thought among
those belonging to the same denomination.
And now arises the question. What is the
cure for all this ? But there is a prior ques-
tion. Is it curable ? Or does it even need
any cure? No doubt, from one point of
view, this very diversity is a healthy sign.
It shows that the intelligent thought of
men is being seriously exercised upon
the great questions with which theology
is concerned. Dissent and diversity
cannot breath the air of indifferentism. No
doubt either, in our present state of know-
ledge and opinion, much of this diversity is
inevitable. Many man, many minds. 1


remember, among the many excellent series
of lectures on preaching recently delivered,
of which those by Dr. Dale were among the
best—l remember one by an eminent divine
in the Anglican Church, wherein he ad-
monished the young preacher always most
carefully to listen to the voice of adverse
criticism. "You may repudiate and deny
what they say, but still, when all is done,
carefully think it over. The chances
are there is something in it." Most whole-
some counsel that, and as good for
differing Churches as for criticised parsons.
"There is something in it." 1 am not myself
what would be called a Calvinist in theology,
but do not ask me to give a philosophical
refutation of the doctrine of necessity. There
is something in it. There is a great deal in
it. I am not a Baptist, but I recognise the
truth of individualism and of personal respon-
sibility which lies at the base of the theology
of Spurgeon. I am not an Episcopalian, but
I think I read more Episcopalian than any other
divines. I am not a Roman Catholic, but I never
read an article of Lilly's or a book of Newman's
without feeling there is something in it. But
that does not exhaust the question. After
making every just and charitable allowance
for these great diversities among Christian
Churches and Christian men, and even
admitting that as things now stand they are
inevitable, I am not reconciled to them as a
permanent feature in the divine order. I
believe that as the Church grows more in-
telligent, better informed, and wiser, its
intellectual diversities will tend to dis-
appear. And 1 will tell you why. Christian
theology (and it is with it alone that
I am at present dealing) is in large
measure a matter of evidence, a matter of
historical research, a matter of literary inter-
pretation. (I purposely avoid raising, in this
paper, any question between religion and
natural science.) And in this historical and
literary region the one thing urgently needed
to-day is the rigour of the scientific method.
I do not deny the great and pregnant truth
pectus facit theologum. So far as religion is
mystical, transcendal, spiritual—and in its
highest range it is all these —its organ of
knowledge is not scientific. The vision of
God is a beatific intuition. But in this
lower realm—lower, but most deeply im
portant—this realm of history, and evi-
dence, and literature, and interpretation,
we have no other means of discovery or
examination available than those which serve
us, and most adequately serve us, in dealing
with any other history or any other litera-
ture. The present Vice-Chancellor of Oxford
startled the theological world of thirty years
ago by saying that the only sound rule of
Scriptural interpretation was to interpret the
Bible as we would any other literature.
Yet the principle now seems to us so
obviously sound that we almost wonder it
could ever have been disputed. Such
questions as that of the age and authorship
of the several parts of this great divine
library, the literary history of the Old Testa-
ment, the composite authorship of the Hexa-
teucb, the Deuteronomic code, the Levitical
legislation, the position of the books called
Paraleipomena, the dual authorship, if so be,
of Isaiah, the date of Daniel, and the precise
sense in which the authorship of the gospels is
to be connected with those whose names they
bear—all such questions in respect to the
external history of the sacred volume,
revealing to us, perhaps, a greater com-
plexity in its structure, older elements
embedded in later recensions, and so a
richer variety in the character of its contents-
all these are questions to be decided by the
same method —the same rigorously scientific
method—as that illustrated by Niebuhr in
the history of earlier, and by Gibbon in the
history of later, Rome, by Grote in the his-
tory of Greece, and by Green in the history
of England. To the great scholars of
Germany, France, and England who
have given minute and diligent attention
to these literary and historical enquiries
the Church of Christ has yet to acknow-
ledge how profound are its obligations.
It is to be observed, however, that the very
rigour of that scientific method will involve
a careful inclusion, estimation, and adjust-
ment of all the available evidence, and, in the
questions surrounding the literary history of
theOJd Testament, the testimony of our Lord,
so far as it really touches these questions,
will be one of the main elements of the
problem. But to say this is only to
say that the scientific treatment of
these questions must not be partial,
but exhaustive. Yet, obviously true as all
this is, how little is it practically regarded
among the differing sects of Christendom.
If an Anglican priest in his investigation of
the constitution of the early Christian
Churches discovers that that constitution was
really Congregational, and dares to say so,
a host of infuriated Churchmen rise up
to protest against the Bampton Lectureship
being so dishonoured —dishonoured, that is to
say, by conducting an historical enquiry in
the only way in which such enquiries can
ever be safely and fruitfully pursued ! If a
Presbyterian minister so reads his Bible as
to arrive at the belief that Christ died for all
he must cease to be a Presbyterian minister.
And his Methodist brother on the other side of
the street will ba rejected from his ministry
if his Presbyterian neighbour is ever able to
convince him that Christ only died for some.
To the same order of thought belongs the
common horror of German theology. It is
forgotten that there are 40,000,000 people
who cannot help being Germans, and that if
they are to have any theology at all it must
be German theology. Gne recalls the keen
but just irony of the great Pascal —"In the
just and the unjust we find hardly anything
which does not change its character in
changing its climate. Three degrees of an
elevation of the pole reverses the whole of
jurisprudence. Right has its epochs—a
pleasant justice which a river or a mountain
limits. Truth on this side of the Pyrenees ;
error upon the other." How puerile is
all this! How little of the sobriety
of mature manhood there is in it!
Any reverent, not to say impassioned,
search for truth on these conditions is
simply a delusion and a snare. Let a
Judge upon the bench be told that he
is to give a calm, careful, and impartial


hearing to both sides in a certain case
and decide according to the weight of evi-
dence, but let him be told at the same time
that the evidence for the plaintiff is so over-
whelmingly strong that if he decides for the
defendant he will be unseated ; who, under
such circumstances, would care to read His
Honor's judgment. It is (I am proud to
say) the characteristic glory of our
Independency that it imposes no such
limitation upon the freedom, the Divinely
chartered liberty, of our Christian faith and
testimony. It is that fact that made me an
Independent and that keeps me one. Here,
my beloved brethren, I am persuaded, arises
one of the main causes of our divided Chris-
tendom. It is a factitious and not an inevi-
table cause of division. It is a stone of
stumbling which it only requires more
humility, more teachableness, more courage—
in one word, more of the spirit of Christ, to
remove. There is a constant tendency on all
sides, amid the controversies of Christendom,
to assume too confident a tone. Was it not
Norman Macleod whospoke of "my cock-sure
of-every thing brethren?" Thex-e is a tendency
to exaggerate and to repress, to magnify
and to minify in the interests of what
the polemic calls the truth, though truth in
that sense is only, after all, what the angry
disputant "troweth." It is well that we do
not take the words of St. Paul too literally,
else the deepest damnation of ecclesiastical
and theological controversy would be its
doing evil that good may come. "The
giving," as Archbishop Whately so in-
cisively puts it, " wrong reasons for what
are deemed right conclusions, wrong grounds
tor what is deemed right belief, false prin-
ciples for right practice—what is all this but a
sort of blasphemy against the Spirit of Truth?"
And with this is constantly allied a bitter-
ness of tone. Strong feeling and hard words
are made to do the work of argument. The
mind of the enquirer is dazed and his ears
deafened by Salmonean thunder. God pity us
.for the feebleness of faith and the pettiness
of spirit that vainly leans on such aids as
these. 1 know that there are certain debased
and unchristian elements in human nature
which facilitate all this. Preachers of the
Sacsverell type, religious newspapers of the
Record type (I purposely choose my illustra-
tions from a remote age and a remote place,
but they may be found much nearer home), are
always popular favourites. But it is by the
lack of the spirit of faith, that is of the spirit
of Christ, alike in teacher and disciple, that
such popularity comes. And it is a sort of
thing which cannot but make the judicious
grieve. It is not really helping men. It is
not permanently settling things. It is not
promoting, as it zealously claims to do, but
fearfully hindering, the coming of the king-
dom. Consider this fact. The fiercest and most
implacable controveries of our time are really
questions as to how far it is possiblo to
strain the meaning of theological for-
mularies, ecclesiastical confessions, framed
ages and generations ago. These are
not living controversies. They are
factitious controversies. And, this is the
point I am anxious to emphasize, they are
the result of an over hasty synthesis made by
theologians, wise and good men, too, who
thought, just as their successors of to-day
thiuk, that they knew enough to stereotype
all thought with finality of definition. But
that over hasty work has always to be done
over again. It is mere wood, hay, stubble.
Are we never to learn wisdom from these
errors and failures ? Science pursues a
method which at length issues in agreement.
It is a method of exact, guarded,
and verified statement. Is theology to
know nothing of this method? Is it
still to remain a chaos of angry,
blind, divisive, fruitless controversy ? No
doubt it is easier to assume tho role of advo-
cate than that of judge. Ages of polemic
strife have wonderfully enriched the rhetoric,
for those who care to use it, of sarcasm, of de-
nunciation, of ridicule, and of disdain. But to
do this is not to do any real work. It is only
making work for others, for the progress of
thought and intelligence, to undo. And
surely it is time for Christian men of all
Churches and of all schools of thought
to lay aside these weapons. " Non tali
auxilio defensoribus istis." It is by the
adoption of another method that other
seekers after truth are steadily attaining to
unity in science. Why may we not hope that
by taking a lesson out of their book in a
similar realm—the realm of historical and
literary research—we may similarly attain
to a substantial unity of faith ?
SCEPTICISM v. CHRISTIANITY.
BY GEO. WIGHT, BRISBANE.
It has rejoiced my heart, how much
I cannot say, to listen to the papers
and addresses which have been placed before
us during these Conferences on the spiritual
aspects of our Churches ; and especially on
the necessity of a pure, spiritual, and active
life on the part of those who have given them-
selves to Christ. It would greatly distress
me—it would quench all the pleasure I have
received —were anything in the following
paper, either in statement, or sentiment, or
tone, to disturb the fine spiritual feeling that
has permeated and characterised all the ut-
terances of these past days. My predecessors
on this platform have been privileged to treat
of the precious gem ; mine is the humbler
task to examine briefly the condition of the
casquet in which the gem is enshrined. Will
you accept the invitation of the ancient
Jewish bard, and, with me, take a leisurely
" walk about Zion, and go round about her,
to mark her bulwarks and consider her
palaces," that we may ascertain whether her
foundations have received material damags
from the careless beating of the waves of
infidelity. Scepticism is rife even in
these new lands. It presents different
phases, derives its existence and suste-
nance from various sources; but on
every phase, from whatever source it may
have been derived and is being sustained,
one characteristic is stamped—one spirit ani-
mates the whole—that of determined, un-
wearied, often unscrupulous and bitter
opposition to Christianity. One wonders at
the animosity manifested by many of the
advocates of scepticism. It can perhaps best
be accounted for by the condition of the


human heart. It would occupy too much of
the time at our disposal to minutely charac-
tarisethe phases of present day scepticism,
or to trace it with exactness to its various
sources. Suffice it to say, the term scepti-
cism, as used in this paper, embraces all
those forms of unbelief that prevail, antago-
nistic to the Christian religion, springing, it
may be, from a tainted literature, the dreams
of scientists, the partial knowledge of science,
the woeful ignorance of Christianity, or the
vitiated condition of collective humanity.
For it should be noted that human nature, as
we know it, has stronger sympathies with
doubt and unbelief than with faith and
spiritual truth. Are we then to ignore litera-
ture because a portion of it is tainted with
unbelief? Certainly not. This would be a
sacrifice indeed ! Are we to cease communion
with the great minds of the past, which
moved and moulded the nations of the world
—are we to put from us that "feast of
reason" which the magnificent literature of the
nineteenth century, both in book and periodic
article, places before us so sumptuously,
because some of that literature may be
tainted with scepticism? Certainly not.
But, if we would stand fast in our faith, we
must read with discrimination : we must
"try the spirits" whether they speak
according to " fact," and in accordance with
acknowledged principles. I have known men
of intelligence who were carried away by
every novel idea which they met with in their
reading. They did not read with discrimina-
tion. Their judgment was at fault; the
critical, weighing, testing faculty was either
wanting, or weak. It would be hard to
prevent such minds from rushing into scepti-
cism. Here it may be remarked, that
doubting is an experience which all thinking
men have passed through. We should have,
and all intelligent Christian men do have,
much sympathy with honest doubting; for
honest doubting is generally the best prepara-
tion for intelligent faith. Is science to be
tabooed because of the eccentricities, ex-
travagancies, and the hasty conclusions
arrived at by some of its votaries ? Again,
we answer no—emphatically, NO. The science
of our day is a marvellous revelation ; but
it is a revelation of God, and God is our
Father. In the Bible there is the revelation
of His will: in the universe there is the
revelation of His working. Those who are
engaged in scientific investigation, in what-
ever department of nature, merit our approba-
tion and our gratitude, even though the
results may be partial and imperfect, and the
deductions sometimes erroneous. These
defects will be righted in time. Workers in
the fields of science are extracting and piling
up facts, which are indispensable to the for-
mation of a true conception in the scientific
mind of the Divine Worker, and for the
fixing of the place and functions of science
itself in the " Cosmos." Earth, our present
habitation, has been given to the children of
men. In our Father's house, even here,
there "are many mansions." Science is ex-
ploring and revealing the wonders of these
mansions; and in doing so, under more light,
and in a more reverent spirit, it will finally
leave intact the fundamental principles of
Christianity. It is admitted that the sceptical
tendencies of the time constitute a powerful
and as yet unchecked force —a force subtle as
powerful—with which Christian men must
cope, and Christianity itself must reckon.
There is no evading this conflict, and the
struggle will be severe, and probably pro-
tracted. The coming of the enemy has long
been heralded; those who " have put their
ear to the ground," have long been conscious
of the tramp of the war-horse; but, warn-
ings have gone unheeded, and many are now
rudely roused to a sense of danger, by the
sharp clash of arms, and booming of heavy
guns allalongthe line. Ourremarks shall have
special reference to the assumed antagonism
between Science and Christianity. Is the
issue doubtful? We think not, if Christian
men of thought and condition and valour
shall come to the front. The occasion will
bring the men. Already there are some
soldiers in the field, harnessed and equipped
for the battle, who are doing excellent
service. They have shown that, neither the
astronomer from the starry universe, nor the
geologist from the crust of the earth, nor the
biologist from his tremulous search after the
scientific origin of life, they have shown that
neither of these explorers has returned with
proof, that the God of the Bible can be dis-
pensed with, or that science has supplanted
revelation. We are aware that there are
men who assert the contrary, but so far as
sober science speaks without hesitation, we
are justified in saying, that it is only asser-
tion. A recent writer in summarising the
achievements of science during the last fifty
years makes some sweeping, and as we believe
groundless statements, which it had been better
for science, had they never been made. Truth,
as it appears to us, is sacrificed to uniformity,
law is substituted for God. Take the follow-
ing extract:—" Life thus falls into its proper
place in the scheme of things as due essen-
tially to the secondary action of radiated
solar energy, intercepted on the moist outer
crust of a cooling and evolving planet
How the first organisms came
to exist at all we can as yet only,conjecture; to
feeble and unimaginative minds the difficulty
of such a conjecture seems grotesquely ex-
aggerated, but granting the existence of a
prime organism." This is uncommonly like
taking for granted the thing to be proved.
To write of science as the author of that
paper does in his closing sentences, is, to our
thinking something more than imaginative,
it is disingenuous and misleading. Science, he
says " sets before our eyes the comprehensive
and glorious idea of a cosmos which is one
and the same throughout, in the sun and star
and world and atom ; in light and heat, and
life and mechanism, in herb and tree, and
man and animal, in body, soul, and spirit,
mind and matter." — Fortnightly Review. Say
we not well that truth is sacrificed to the
passion for uniformity in things that essen-
tially differ ? Is it proved that man is
descended from the monkey ? It is only sup-
posed, for the evolution hypothesis really
goes no further than this. But, even though
it were proved—what then ! It only modifies
onr conception of God's method of working ;
it does not touch the essential principles of


Christianity. Is mind evolved out of matter ?
Who has proved It, and where is the proof
to be found ? We have a right to put these
questions. Has science furnished a rational
account of the genesis of the human conscience
or the articulate language of man ? Max
Muller, the greatest living authority on the
science of language, asserts that Mr. Darwin's
hypothesis does not bridge over the chasm
that exists between the gibberish of the most
accomplished mammal and the language of the
human creature. The language of the above
extract supposes, and then coolly asserts that
the scientific origin of life is at last discovered.
Max Muller says—" Organic life is looked
upon as a mechanical process, though it is
fully admitted that science has not yet
mastered it." Professor Huxley, who stands
at the head of biological investigation, says :
—" The present state of knowledge furnishes
us with no link between the living and the
non-living."— Art Biology, new tdEncy.
Britannica. It is more than a dozen years
since Dr. John Tyndall thought he saw in
inorganic matter " the promise and the
potency of every form and quality of life."
But, notwithstanding the closest scrutiny by
the ablest scientists, the promise has not been
realised—nature still keeps her secret: " The
deep saith, it is not in me; and the sea saith
it is not with me. Destruction and death
say, we have heard a rumour thereof with our
ears. God understandeth the way thereof,
and He knoweth the place thereof." We do
not admit, then, that the teaching of science
is opposed to the teaching of Christ. Christ's
teaching waß on a higher, because on a
spiritual plane; and its subject-matter had
regard to facts and principles which science
cannot reach. While science and religion,
in our opinion, move on separate lines,
their attitude towards each other, when each
is honestly interpreted, is not antagonistic,
but friendly. The Christianity in which we
believe, is that system of principles and
precepts, simple ritual and worship, which
able exegeses have fairly deduced from the
New Testament Scriptures, whose founda-
tions rest on the Person, the words, the doings
of Christ, read in the light of the teachings
and practices of the apostles. Sceptical
writers inflict grievous injury on Christianity,
we shall not say intentionally in all instances,
by selecting generally, the most corrupt of
all the churches, and the most fantastic of
theological opinions, as the equivalent of
the Christian system. We shall give two
examples. In Dr. Draper's work on " The
Conflict between Religion and Science," as
we have elsewhere written," the Roman
Catholic church is taken as an equivalent for
Christianity; and as that system is easily
proved to be in conflict with science, the con-
clusion is readily drawn that Bible Christianity
is placed in the same predicament. Now,
this is not only not true, it is the reverse of
the truth. Every one knows who knows
anything about the subject, that the spirit
and teaching of Christ and His Apostles are
embodied in the exhortation of Paul —" Prove
all things; hold fast that which is good." In
comparing or contrasting science with religion,
candour and fair-play demand that the
comparison or contrast should be made with
Christianity as embodied in the teachings and
doings of its Divine Founder, and not with
any existing church, however ancient or self-
asserting. The second example is no less
glaringly unfair. Mr. Cotter Morrison in his
recently published book on " The Service of
Man," does his utmost to discredit and
damage Christianity. He would instal
positivism in its place. He reasons in this
way—Certain moral defects attach to persons
professing to be Christians; therefore,
Christianity is effete, and should be discarded.
It would not be difficult to show that
positivism, for the same reason, presents no
ciaim to be installed in its place. Certain
antiquated theological opinions are raked up
and presented as Christianity, which the
great body of Christians have no more faith
in than has Mr. Morrison. Because an in-
finitesimal fraction of professed Christians did
and it may be, still do, profess anti-nomianism
therefore, he concludes, Christianity is a law-
less and an immoral system ! Surely this is
child's play, not rational argumentation.
Unfair treatment of a subject so profoundly
important, can only recoil on the heads of
those against whom it is chargeable. Ano-
ther favourite argument with this class of
writers is, that the Christian system is a hash
of the old religions of the world. On this
great question we can only offer a few senten-
ces. The strength of this argument lies in
our ignorance; and hence the Christian world
should hail the collection and translation of
the " Religious Books of the East" —under
the editorship of Professor Max Muller. The
Chinese Sacred books, the Rig-Veda and
and other Indian collections, and the Egyp-
tian Book of the Dead, contain many moral
precepts ; but they are like grains of wheat
among tons of rubbish. Christianity has
nothing to fear from this quarter. The books
have only to be known and read to divulge
the rotten character of these systems. Yet,
this is the utmost that poor human nature
has been able to accomplish in four thousand
years. W ill you allow me to quote again from
myself?—" Christianity contains many ele-
ments of truth which the Indian sages were
never able to reach; it throws clear light on
problems of the deepest concern to men,
which baffled all their attempts at solution ;
it presents the only perfect ideal of humanity
in the person of Christ which the world has
ever seen. The old systems of religion, how-
ever, have served a great purpose —a double
purpose. First, they adumbrate Christianity ;
for whatever of good is found in them is the
shadow of better things to come—the promise
and the foretaste of a nobler Faith and a purer
worship—for the Lord our God " keepeth
truth for ever," Secondly , in them are seen
manifest preparatory processes for the ulti-
mate reception of Christianity, for when great
powers both of penetration and reasoning
exercised over a period of from three to four
thousand years, have failed to solve the pro-
blems of the world and of God, men may be
supposed to be more willing to listen to
the exposition of a more excellent way.
Thus they become " schoolmasters " to bring
men to Christ. In our view, the good ele-
ments in the ancient faiths are but the early
fitful streaks of dawn— the first faint quiver


ing blushes of coming day—on the dark
mountains of ignorance and sensuality; while
Christianity, stripped of all human accretions,
pure and simple as it came from the hand of
the Divine |Revealer, is welcomed as the
effulgence of the perfect day. By acknow-
ledging the good in these systems we do not
thereby homologate the evil; and in acting
thus we are only following the exampleof the
divine Master and the great Apostle of the
Gentiles. The spiritual enlightenment and
moral renovation of the world, like all the
works of God, are slow, silent and sure. Men
may marvel at the Divine method of working,
and some may possibly querulously question
the procedure ; but, it may well be asked, if
even the wisest of men are in any sense
qualified to pass judgment on matters so
transcendently beyond their comprehension"
" The Old Faiths of India and Christianity,"
pp. 8, 9.—The germ of the above undeveloped
ideas is to be found in the first part of the
first chapter of the Gospel according to St.
John. Men and brethren, the crisis that is
close upon us—that old men may escape, but
that young men must meet- is one of momentous
importance to Spiritual Truth. In the strug-
gle, lean see that the hearts of many will fail;
faith must needs have to undergo a more
severe and winnowing trial than it has ever
been exposed to before. But they who endure
unto the end shall triumph. The questions
are, " How shall we neutralize the subtle
poison of unbelief that is permeating the body
social ? How shall we successfully meet this
tremendous force that is dashing its waves
against the old fortresses of our Faith ?" It is
not for one so insignificant as the speaker to
attempt an answer to these questions. It best
becomes this Conference in its wisdom and
experience to undertake the task. Still, with
your permission, I may venture on a few
hints. Let us frankly receive the clearly-
established facts of Science. Let us be careful
not to abuse the workers in the fields of
science, however much we may deplore the
attempts of some to stir up antagonism be
tween science and religion. Don't be
constantly nagging at science and men of
science—this produces nothing but irri-
tation. Betray no fear of the ultimate success
of your cause : but beware of treating ligthly
the power with which you have to contend.
Dont rashly enter the field of controversy, be
well equipped for the fight. Our best men
must be entrusted with the unhampered
management and direction of the campaign.
We have many friends among the scientists.
We shall need their help ; be careful not to
estrange them. We have arrived at the most
dffficult and delicate point of all. What of
the Christian side of the controversy ?
What of some of the current interpretations
of the Bible? These are solemn and far
reaching questions, and should be handled
wisely and tenderly. Some of our interpre-
tations require reconsideration, such as those
in regard to the age of the earth, and the re-
ferences to science generally. May we not
have fallen into error on some of these
points? Is our faith in the essentials of
Christianity so firm, and our moral courage
so strong, that we cap afford to acknowledge
our mistakes, and remedy them? The object
of the Bible is not to teach sciences but it
must need refer to them. The references to
astronomy are made on the acknowled prin-
ciple, that all people in the affairs and
experiences of daily life, speak of objects as
they appear to be, not as science knows
them to be. The popular idea of the
age of the earth, and by implication of the
relative age of man, is not a revelation but
a deduction; it is not what God says, but
what man concludes. The friends of the
Bible may therefore, with all safety, give the
geologist time for the building up of the
crust of this globe, under the shelter of
this sublime sentence " In the beginning God
created the Heaven and the earth." The
" natural day " theory in the mosaic creation
is now abandoned by most intelligent Christ-
ians ; some of whom think that the " epoch"
theory meets the case, and some after the
late Hugh Miller think thai the narrative
furnishes a sublime poetic vision of creation
aiming not so much at scientific accuracy, as
at the fixing the great truth in men's minds,
that the universe is not eternal, nor self-
formed, but is the outcome of the Supreme
Will. These and similar questions demand
liberal and candid discussion, in the light of
the present time ! but what concerns us first
and most, is the conservation and practice of
those spiritual and moral principles that con-
stitute a living Christianity. I should not do
justice to my own belief were I to close this
paper without stating, that in my judgment,
spiritual Christianity has yet another enemy
to reckon with, far more powerful and far
more subtle than Science, with all its avail-
able forces combined. This enemy is within
the camp. The power that sits like a horrid
nightmare on India and all the East; the
power that enslaved Europe mentally in the
.Dark Ages, and is still enslaving her in part,
the power that is so insidiously stealing over
the senses and the minds of men, alike in
enlightened Britain and in her robust depen-
dencies, the power of Sacerdotalism, that is
the tremendous power with which spiritual
religion must some day grapple.
DR. DALE'S JUBILEE SERMON.
At Stow Church on Tuesday evening a
service was held, at which there was an over-
flowing congregation.
Dr. Dale preached the following special
jubilee sermon from Acts xxvi. 22, " Having
therefore obtained help of God I stand fast
unto this day." When Paul stood before
Agrippa he had been a Christian about five
and twenty years. At his conversion he had
passed through a great intellectual conflict
and a great moral agony, and since then he
had lived a hard life. He had made many
rough voyages and three times he had been
shipwrecked. He had travelled in wild
countries and had endured hunger and thirst
and cold and great physical exhaustion.
Again and again he had been imprisoned.
Five times he had been flogged and received
the nine and thirty lashes with which the
Jews were accustomed to punish criminals.
Three times he had been beaten with rods by
the order of the Roman magistrates. In
cities he had been stoned by violent mobs;
in mountain passes he had been robbed by


brigands. He was hated by his countrymen
all over the world and slandered as a traitor
to the historic glories and to the great hopes
of the Jewish nation. A large number of
Jewish Christians regarded him with dis-
trust and hostility, and their antagonism was
the harder to bear because they claimed to
be the true representatives and trustees of
the Christian faith ; they maintained that
they had on their side the original apostles
and the men who were the personal friends
of the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly
life, and that Paul was creating a schism by
breaking the customs of the mother church
of Jerusalem. The heathen were against him
and the Jews who did not believe in Christ
were against him, and very many of the
Christian Jews were against him too. His
life had therefore been one of incessant con-
troversy. He had fast friends, but he also
had many furious and inveterate enemies.
But for five-and-twenty years he had main-
tained his ground, and he held it still. " Hav-
ing obtained help from God," he said to
Agrippa " I stand firm unto this day." It was
not to the vigour of his character that he at-
tributed his constancy, but to the Divine
strength ; and it was on the Divine strength
that he rested for the time to come.
We are celebrating the Jubilee of Congrega-
tionalism in this colony. We are commemora-
ting the faith and the zeal and the sagacity of
the devout men who, fifty years ago, founded
the Church which meets within these walls —
the first Congregational Church in South Aus-
tralia. Their trust was in the God whom
they desired to serve, and, recalling the diffi-
culties through which the Congregational
Churches of this colony have struggled, and
considering their present strength and their
present resources, you, their children and
successors, may adopt the words of the
apostle and say, " Having obtained help
of God we stand fast unto this day."
I need not remind you that Thomas Quintin
Stow and those who shared with him the great
task of laying the foundation of Congrega-
tionalism on these shores inherited the tra-
ditions of the Congregationalists of England.
Our history, before 1837, is yours as well
as ours; our history since 1837 is largely
yours as well as ours, for the twelve thousand
miles of ocean which separate you from the
old country, have not separated you from
those conflicts of religious thought and those
vicissitudes of religious life through which
English Congregationalists have been passing
during the last half century. I wish to re-
mind you this evening of our common history
and our common principles.
For 300 years the descendants of the Eliza-
bethan Congregationalists in England, in
America, and in these colonies, have en-
deavoured, with varying fidelity, to realize
the glorious ideal of the Christian Church,
and, having obtained help of God, we
stand to this day. I might indeed claim
for English Congregationalists a still longer
history. From the time that Wickliffe ap-
peared in England—" The morning star of
the Reformation" more than 500 years
ago, there can be traced an almost un-
broken line of religious societies, which
were in fact Congregational Churches.
They were cruelly persecuted—sometimes
almost extinguished—but their faith was un-
quenched and their courage unbroken. But
it was under the reign of Elizabeth that the
true idea of the Congregational polity in its
spiritual depth and power was first firmly
grasped, and since then through times of
storms and times of peace, Congregational
churches, founded on definite Congregational
Erinciples have always existed among all
ranches of the English race.
It would not be difficult to draw a close
parallel between our history and position
and that of the Apostle Paul. One of the
fiercest elements of the opposition which
he had to endure was Jewish patriotism.
His countrymen hated him because they
believed that he was false to the national
faith and was breaking up the national
unity. This was also one of the chief elements
of the antagonism to our own ecclesias-
tical ancestors. Three hundred years ago it
seemed a matter of the first importance to
unite the whole strength of the nation in
support of the throne of Elizabeth. In Eng-
land itself there were popish plots against
the crown and against the life of the queen,
and she was regarded with deadly hatred by
Spain and the Pope. The Protestant cause
throughout Europe seemed to depend upon
the national spirit of England and especially
upon English fidelity to the crown. And our
ecclesiastical ancestors, while they were men
of enthusiastic loyally, refused to acknow-
ledge that the Queen had authority to deter-
mine how a Christian church should be
governed, and how Englishmen should wor-
ship God. This was the very heart of the
quarrel between Puritanism and the Anglican
Church; and the Separatists, the Congrega-
tionalists of those days, were among the
most vehement in their resistance to the
queen's ecclesiastical claims. And as the
country was generally persuaded that the
safety of the nation required that all'author-
ity—civil and ecclesiastical—should be con-
centrated in the hands of Elizabeth, the
patriotism of Englishmen raged as furiously
against the Congregationalists, as the patriot-
ism of tho Jews raged against Paul.
Paul had also to resist the conservative party
in the Christian church itself—the party that
wanted to perpetuate the old Jewish cere-
monies-circumcision, the sabbath, regulations
about food, and a hundred things besides.
Many of those who contended for the per-
manence of these customs were good and
devout Christian men, but they could
not understand Paul's want of reverence for
the sacred institutions which had been hon-
oured by the saints of many generations. It was
hard for him to be obliged to fight them; but
he had no choice. The freedom of the Chris-
tian Church was at stake, and.he could not
help fighting them, And our ecclesiastical
ancestors had a similar struggle. Many of
the bishops of the English; Church at first
yielded reluctantly to the pressure of the
Queen, and, only to avoid collision with her,
consented to enforce the..old. Romish cus-
toms to which the Puritans objected. Some
of these customs may appear to us now very
harmless. But .in those days they were
questions of life and death. The Puritans


refused, for example, at the Queen's bidding
to wear the vestments ; the vestments were
priestly vestments, and they were ready
to endure the loss of all things rather than
appear before their people as priests. They
declared that they had no sacrifice to offer-
one sacrifice had been offered for the sin of
the world and there was no other. They
declared that they had no authority to
absolve from sin—from the lips of Christ Him-
self every penitent must receive absolution.
They regarded these vestments as the Pope's
uniform, and at a time when Spain and the
Pope were trying to crush Protestantism
all over Europe they passionately resented
the Queen's commands that they should
wear the livery of the common enemy. Some
of the Bishops who thought that to avoid
worse evils what one of them called the Ama-
kitish garments, should be worn, were good
men and able men ; but our ancestors were
obliged to oppose them, and just as Paul's
struggle with the Judaizing Christians, was
more bitter and more angry than his struggle
with the unbelieving Jews and the heathen,
the controversy with those whom our fathers
regarded as Romanizing Churchmen was even
more bitter and more angry than with actual
Romanism and with infidelity.
The conditions of the struggle have greatly
changed, but some of the original elements of
antagonism have continued down to our own
time. We in England have still to resist—as
Paul had to resist —a great force of national
and patriotic feeling, for we too are separated
from the National Church —the Church of
the Crown—the Church which is sustained
and defended by national law, the Church
whose chief ministers receive their appoint-
ment from the Queen, and occupy seats
among the Peers. When Paul became a
Christian his countrymen felt that he was
only half a Jew, and that he had broken
with the traditions and separated himself
from the national life of the race. And to
this hour large classes of our fellow-country-
men at home feel that since we refuse to ac-
knowledge the ecclesiastical authority of the
Crown and to observe the religious ceremo-
nies which are instituted by English
law we are only half Englishmen,
The feeling is natural; it is inevitable.
From this element of difficulty you in this
colony are happily free. l?our strength is
notexhausted by politico-ecclesiastical contro
versies which embitter those relations of af-
fection and confidence which ought to exist
between all Christian men. You are stung
by no sense of injury. You are not over-
shadowed by a stately and powerful national
church. It is for you to show the strength
and the graces that can be achieved by Con-
gregational Churches in a country which en-
joys perfect religious equality.
It is not only a patriotic, a national
force, that we have had to resist ; we
have had to confront, as Paul had to
confront, the authority which is exerted
by religious tradition over the imagination
and sentiment of the ordinary mass of
mankind. The Jewish customs and cere-
monies against which Paul revolted were
consecrated by the memories of 1.500 years.
The Romish customs and ceremonies against
which our ecclesiastical ancestors revolted
were consecrated by the memories of at least
1,000 years. It is always hard to break with
the past. But Paul knew that the future of
the Christian Church belonged to him : We
know that the future of the Christian Church
belongs to us,
I might run the parallel closer. Paul
had to endure severe persecution, and yet
he stood firm. We have also had to
endure severe persecution. In Elizabeth's
time men were hung for writing books
in defence of our ecclesiastical principles;
they were hung for distributing the books.
Men and women were shut up in foul un-
wholesome prisons for being present at ser-
vices like those which are held in this place
every week. They were subjected to ruinous
fines because they would not attend church ;
and at last, as a desperate measure, in order
to clear the country of us and to stamp us
out, we were banished from the kingdom.
The persecution continued though with les-
sened severity under James i. and Charles I.
Even after the civil war began the majority of
those opposed to the King and the bishops
were unwilling to give us liberty. They
were dismayed and furious at the idea of
leaving us uncontrolled ; and it was only be-
cause Cromwell became necessary to the
Parliament that the Independents were able
to vindicate their freedom under the Com-
monwealth. With the return of the Stuarts
persecution began once more, and lasted till
the Stuarts were again driven from the
throne. Since then we have had legal
toleration, and gradually, in great towns
at least, we have become strong enough
to hold our own. But in many parts of the
country down to our own times those who
share our ecclesiastical faith have had to
maintain a hard struggle. The custom of
the gentry has been withdrawn from the dis-
senting shopkeeper, landlords have refused
their farms to dissenting applicants, and
have given notice to quit to dissenters in
actual possesion of farms. In the settlement
of some estates it has been provided that
no land shall be sold for the erection of dis-
senting chapels, and that if dissenting
worship is held in any buildings on the estate
the leases of those buildings shall be for-
feited. Where no such settlements exist,
individual landholders have pursued the same
policy. As long as the Anglican church re-
mains the Established Church and a grave
political difference separates Churchmen from
Nonconformists, these troubles are likely to
continue. We at home must accept them
unflinchingly, bear them patiently, refrain our
lips from hard and bitter words, acknowledge
frankly that the landlord who gives a dis-
senting farmer notice to quit for holding a
prayer meeting in his kitchen may be as
honest and conscientious as the farmer who
after he and his ancestors have held the farm
for 200 years is obliged to seek another home.
All things have been against us, the pride of
national feeliDg, the influence of the crown,
the influence of the aristocracy, the influence
of wealth. Not unfrequently the blind pas-
sion of mobs has been against us, our chapels
have been gutted and burnt. The religious
traditions of the country have been against


us, and good men, whom we ourselves honour
for their devoutness and zeal, have thought
us the enemies of Christ and His gospel.
Great secular forces have been against us and
many of our greivances remained for genera-
tion after generation unredressed because
statesmen who acknowledged that we were
wronged did not care to risk their own fate
and the fate of their party in the attempt to
do us justice. But like Paul we can say that
having obtained help of God we stand to this
day, and still bear witness to the faith for
which our fathers suffered and for which, if
necessary, we in our time are ready to
suffer too.
You have acheived freedom. How are you
using it ? The first duty of those to whom the
great idea of Congregationalism has been re-
vealed is to be loyal to the Church to which
they belong, and to consecrate their affection,
their strength, their resources to its service.
A Congregational Church, according to our
fundamental principle, consists of those who
have received the remission of sins and the
gift of eternal iife. This is the condition of
membership, and there should be no other.
It is enough that those who desire to enter
our communion are already the friends of
Christ —His brethren—children of the Eter-
nal by the regeneration of the Holy Ghost.
We require of men faith in Christ as the Sa-
viour and Lord of the human race—this and
nothing more; but this is indispensable.
Knowledge of Christian truth may be very
elementary ; it may not only be defective, it
may be impaired by grave error. Character
may have grave faults and the exceeding
greatness of that power which worketh in all
that believe, may as yet have failed to break
many evil habits and to subdue many evil
passions ; the fair graces of sanctity may as
yet hardly appear. But, if a man has faith
in Christ the roots of his life are in Christ;
he dwells in God ; God dwells in him ; he is
under the teaching of the Holy Ghost; he is
destined to a consummate perfection. Hence
a Congregational Church, if it is faithful to
its central and fundamental principle, is an
"august society of saints;" and this char-
acter it holds even though some unregenerate
members may have been received into its
fellowship, or though some who, when they
came, were faithful to Him, have fallen away.
As an august society of saints you are to
think of it. You are to think of its members
as having the lite of God. One by one, in
solitary places, they have spoken to God and
He has answered them. Their sins are for-
given. In the power of God, with more or
less success, they are trying to do His will.
Sometimes the divine glory breaks upon them
and they anticipate the blessedness of heaven.
The great titles which are given to saints are
theirs, and theirs the immortal hopes. You
ought to discern—if.your vision is keen enough
you will discern —in their life and character,
the dawn of eternal splendours, the
prophecy of the transcendent perfection
of those who dwell in the Home of
God. You will regard them with affection
because they are infinitely dear to Christ,
because they are one with Him, and they
must be enfolded in the love you have for
Christ Himself. You will regard them with
reverence because of the dignity which is
theirs—a dignity diviner than belongs to
great nobles of an ancient race, or to regal
or imperial crowns. They are akin to God.
You will recognise the sacredness of the
duties which rest upon you as members of
so august a society. You will be eager to
be present at its worship ; you will prepare
for its worship, that by your own devote-
nessyou may add to the reverence of its ador-
ation, to the urgency and trustfulness of its
intercession to the rapture of its praise. You
will share its work, and you will see that
work in fellowship in the Church must have
in it more of real, though sometimes less of
apparent, spiritual force than work of your
own, carried on apart from the society which
possesses the life and power of God. You
will respect its decisions, for they are the
decisions of a society which declares that it is
guided by the will of Christ, not by its own.
You will respect its officers, not because they
receive their authority from a society so great
—for it is not the Congregational theory that
ministerial and official authority in the
Church is derived froip the Church itself —
but because according to the faith of Congre-
gationalists, those whom God has destined
to teach and to exercise authority have been
recognised and appointed to office in the
Church in obedience to God's will. You will
regard it as a singular privilege to contribute
to the support of the institutions for the
development of the life of the Church itself,
and for the evangelization of those outside,
whether in your own immediate neighbour-
hood or in the distant parts of the colony, or in
foreign lands. For it is not enough to pray
in words that God's will may be done on earth
as it is in heaven. We must pray by work
and pray by generous gifts.
Our fathers suffered, and suffered heavily for
Congregationalism; not merely for those great
truths of the evangelical faith which we hold in
common with many other Christian people—
they might have held and preached these with-
out enduring fine, imprisonment, exile, death.
They suffered for the congregational polity,
and it was worth suffering for—it is worth
suffering for still. There is something in it
to stir a vehement enthusiasm and to secure
the vigorous sympathy of all that is most
generous in the Christian life. It requires no
doubt —and this is at once its strength and
its weakness —a large measure of Christian
intelligence, a high development of some of
the rarest, most precious excellencies of the
Christian character, and especially it requires
that which Paul expreses in the text, a strong
faith in God.
I say that Congregationalism requires a strong
faith in God ; it r squires a faith which some
Christian men may regard as extravagant and
audacious. I can illustrate this only very
briefly. Take first of all the form of our wor-
ship. There is nothing in the mere polity of
Congregationalism, in the organic structure
of Congregational churches, to prevent a
Congregational church from adopting a
liturgy. Here and there a liturgy has been
adopted. But the traditions of Congrega-
tionalism are against it, and further I venture
to say that the genius of Congregationalism
is against it. It was one of the principal


grounds on which our fathers objected
to the national form of worship, that
it imposed what in their sharp lan-
guage they called "stinted prayers."
They believed that the same Spirit that
taught the saints of other centuries how to
pray teaches us, and that Christian Churches
should rely on His living presence and on
His inspiration. The venture is a bold one.
Speaking for myself I may say that it is the
devotional part of our service which demands
of a Congregational minister the richest re-
sources both of intellect and life. In my earlier
years I often wished I could fall back on the
prayers which have been written in other
centuries bydevout men, and which still con-
stitute the expression of the wants and
thanksgivings of many of our fellow Chris-
tians. The divine fire in my heart at least
sometimes burns low. The heavens are
sometimes covered with mist and impene-
trable cloud. Sometimes lam ready to ask
whether ancient fountains of inspiration
have not ceased to flow. I think 1 feel as
keenly as any of my people can feel, the fre-
quent absence of that glow, that ardour,
that serenity, that faith, that urgency which
ought to distinguish public prayers. Some-
times on Sunday after Sunday I seem to wait
in vain for that chariot of fire by which in
happier hours we are all carried upwards,
away from the restlessness and tumult of
this world to the home of God. But I have
ceased to wish for a liturgy. The loftier
faith seems to me the true faith. I prefer to
rely, and to rely altogether, on the divine
light and life. Let the inspiration come
direct from Heaven, or let it not come at all.
When the minister does not know how to
pray, the people may still have close access to
God ; when the spoken prayers are weak and
faltering, with no depth or intensity in them,
the people may still be strong in faith and by
their silent petitions and intercessions may
secure for themselves and others the largest
blessings. Yes, I stand by the loftier faith.
But let us remember what it means This
worship of ours in which we refuse the aid of
a liturgy, means that we believe God is as near
to us as He ever was to the saints of any
former generation, and that the Spirit of God
teaches us as He taught them how to pray.
It is only because we have obtained in our
worship the help of God that we stand fast
in our freedom.
Take another element of Congregatio-
nalism, one of its essential elements.
We admit no strong central ecclesiastical
authority of any kind; no bishop with
the clergy and churches of a great diocese
UDder his government, no synod or assembly
ruling the churches of a whole nation.
Every little group of Christians, no matter
how poor, how uninstructed, stands by
itself in absolute independence. It must re-
gulate its own worship, it must administer
its own discipline, it must elect its own
officers. No matter what heresies the minis-
ters of this Church may fall into, his own
people alone are his judges. No ecclesiasti-
cal court outside these walls can control either
him or them. No matter what quarrels may
break out amongst them, no external author-
ity can step in and compel them to be at peace.
Inthepresenceof thegreat organised Churches
of Episcopacy and Presbyterianism
the rulers of which can bring a law, sustained
by the consent of hundreds of thousands of
adherents, to bear upon a single minister or a
single congregation, I say, in the presence of
the great organised Churches, we seem to be
powerless. I admit the venture that we
make is a daring venture—but it is only a
trustful answer to the great words of Christ,
" Where two or three are gathered together in
my name, there am I in the midst of them."
This is what we mean by the Independence
of our Churches. In every Church meeting we
rely upon Christ's presence. He is there as
one of the company, and we say that we can
permit no appeal from a decision to which
we think we have been guided by Him, and
which has received His sanction. This is
what I call the boldness, you may call it the
audacity of Congregationalism. It is an im-
possible scheme of Church polity unless Christ
is really present with us. To entrust the
conduct of Church life, with all the delicate
and difficult questions which it sometimes
involves to the uncontrolled decision of a
few persons, the majority of whom are some-
times without education, without leisure for
much thought, and without that self-control
which comes from a wise discipline of char-
acter, appears certain to give rise sometimes
to ruinous mistakes, and sometimes to bit-
ter quarrels. These small societies, without
interal coherence, without external control,
are likely to be broken to pieces by the folly
and passion of their members ; and if they
last it may be urged that they will be the
strongholds of ignorance, prejudice, and self-
conceit. I have no answer except one to
make to these criticisms—but this answer is
complete. Take the last objection first: —
These groups of uneducated people are cer-
tain, you say, to be governed by prejudice
and self-conceit. Yes. But we believe that
Christ the Divine Teacher is among them.
He will illuminate them with His own spirit.
He wiil enable them to grasp the principles of
His own teaching. He will do for them what
He did for Peter and James and John, and
for the other fishermen and peasants of Gal-
ilee who became, through Him, the teachers
of mankind. Take the other objection—
These little groups of men or women will be
disturbed by quarrels originating in vanity,
in self-will, in morbid sensitiveness, in
ambition. Yes it is infinitely probable : and
the group of disciples that gathered round
the Lord Jesus Christ was disturbed by simi-
lar quarrels. There were hot disputes among
them who should be the greatest. But when
they brought their quarrels to Him, He made
them sensible of their guilt and gave them
repentance, and inspired them with some
measure of His own gentleness. He does the
same for those among whom He lives in our
own day. If, indeed, a Congregational
Church forgets that it is a Church of Christ
—that Christ is its Master and Lord —that
in all Church affairs His will is supreme
—that no member has the faintest
right to have his own way—but that
every member is bound to try to learn what
Christ way is and to sacrifice for that per-
sonal tastes and personal preferences, there


will be infinite trouble. If a Congregational
Church forgets that it is a Church of Christ
and that He is present in it to lead the mem-
bers from month to month and from year to
year into a deeper knowledge of His mind
and will, then there will be bigotry, narrow-
ness, intense sectarianism. And Churches
are in danger of forgetting Christ just as in-
dividual Christians are in danger of forget-
ting Christ, but if they are really Christian
Churches they will not forget Him long, just
as individual men, if they are really Chris-
tians, will not forget, Him long, and there will
be humilitation and shame and penitence in
both cases as soon as Christ is again remem-
bered, If Churches persist in forgetting
Him, go on month after month thinking no-
thing of His presence and authority, then
they cease to be Churches altogether and be-
come human societies, religious clubs,
irreligious clubs, without divine guidance,
without divine protection, and then it
is no wonder if they are guilty of great
offence and endure great misery. There is
a divine boldness, I repeat, in our principles.
We venture everything on our faith that
Christ is really present according to the
Word, where two or three are gathered to-
gether in His name.
There is a third characteristic of our
polity which is distinguished by the same
boldness and the same faith. A doctrinal
creed is altogether foreign to the genius
of Congregational Churches. We have no con-
fession of faith to impose upon any man as a
condition of Church membership, no Thirty-
nine Articles to be signed by a minister as
the condition of his appointment to the
ministry. Some unwise Congregationalists
sixty or seventy years ago began to introduce
doctrinal clauses into the trust deeds of our
places of worship, but this was an innovation
and they did not perceive that they were
departing from the principles which they
had inherited. Even these unwise and
pernicious safe guards of true faith lie outside
our Church life ; they leave the Church, as a
spitual society untouched; they only make
it a condition of the use of the building that
the minister should hold certain doctrinal
opinions. But the policy was a mistake, and
1 trust it is not being repeated here. When
we erect a church building we should erect
it for a Church, and leave the Church the
absolute command of it for the purpose of
Christian worship. This was the policy of
the earlier Independents. The refusal to
impose a defined creed even on ministers or
people, is one of the direct results of our
Congregational faith. We refuse creeds,
not because we say that we are
religious enquirers in search of truth, and
cannot define our creed, but because we say
that we have found the great Teacher —that
He is living with us, and that by His spirit
He is leading us into all the truth. We don't
imagine that He had taught our fathers 200
years ago all He had to teach, or all He
has to teach, or that there will be nothing
for Him to discover to our children. If
Christ were dead, or if He had forsaken
the Church, or if His Spirit was not
with us any longer, then perhaps it would be
a wise plan to try to draw up in a series of
theological propositions all that He taught
His disciples when He was here, as far as we
could discover it, and to say, " These propo-
sitions shall always be taught by our minis-
ters, and none of our members shall deny
them." But Christ is alive, this is the
foundation of the faith of Christendom.
He lives among every group of Christian
men united together in His name; this is
the foundation of the polity of Congregation-
alism, and therefore a formal creed seems
to us not only unnecessary but something
worse. It seems to imply that He cannot
keep those whom He is teaching loyal to
is own truth. And if you ask —What is to
happen when a Congregational Church ceases
to have faith in Christ as its living Teacher,
and listens to other voices than His, and
whether in that case a definite creed may not
keep the pulpit right and the Church right.
I answer that it ceases to be a Church when
Christ is no longer acknowledged as its living
Master and Lord, and that no written creed
will keep it a Church in the absence of this
acknowledgement. We refuse creeds, not
because we are doubtful about everything,
but because we are sure that Christ will lead
us into all the Truth. In the first 800 years
of the history of ancient Rome, the city was
surrounded by no strong fortifications. It
was like the Church of Christ before it
encompassed itself with creeds. Strabo says
that the absence of fortifications is to be
accounted for by the native spirit of the
Roman people, which made them defend their
walls by their men, not their men by their
walls. That is the spirit of Congregational-
ism. It relies upon the Church to protect
the Truth, not upon formal definitions of
Truth to defend the Church ; or rather, we
trust everything to Christ, While He is
amongst us everything will go right; if He
ceases to be among us we cannot prevent
everything from going wrong.
Yes, this for me is the chief glory of
Congregationalism. It affirms with strong
and deep and passionate emphasis that
the living Christ is present whenever two
or three of those who are one with Him
are gathered together in His name. We
rejoice in His presence with Christian
people of other Churches when they are
gathered together in Christ's name—with
devout Methodists of every description,
with devout Presbyterians, with devout
members of the Episcopal Church, with
devout members of the Church of Rome.
But we affirm by our very polity that He is
with us. This is the root, this the founda-
tion of our Church order. Let us never
forget it in our personal life; let us never
forget it in our preaching. Christ is not
dead. No Christian Church, no Christian
man believes that He is dead. He is alive,
and looking back through the 18th
centuries of Christian history, on gene-
ration after generation we can see
the revelations of His life and power.
Christ is alive, and His life has been revealed
in the Church of every century, and of every
land. The Church is the body of Christ, ana
in all that is pure and generous, in all that is
merciful and devout in the Church Christ is
coptinually manifested. As the life of a vine


is revealed in the wealth of the clusters
which hang upon its branches, the life of
Christ is revealed in the virtues and the sanc-
tity of innumerable saints. What Christ is
I learn not from the Gospels only ; I learn
it in the passionate zeal for the salvation of
mankind, which burned in the heart of St.
Paul, and which was kindled by Christ—in
the courageous calmness in which Stephen
and Polycarp, and innumerable maidens and
children and aged men in the earlier ages of
the Church, endured torture and death
rather than deny the faith—the courage and
calmness that came from their union which
Christ. In every succeeding age I see the
proof that He ever liveth, the perpetual
fountain of all Christian righteousness. I see
Christ's hatred of sin in the bitter penitence
which marks the confessions of Augustine.
I see the fervour of His love for man in the
fires which it kindled in the soul of St, Fran-
cis. I see His passion for holiness in
Thomas a Kempis. In the perfect faith
and conscious union with God of Fenelon, I
see Christ's union with the Father. The
very spirit of Christ swells in the heart of
Ambrose in the Te Deum, and reveals itself in
vehement fervour of the hymns of Charles
Wesley. It is because Christ is moved with
compassion that ministers of His mercy, in
every age, seek to reclaim the fallen, sooth
the sufferings of the sick, and relieve the
hardships of the poor. Christ listens to the
cry of the oppressed; and it is He who
through the hands of patriots and heroes
breaks in pieces the oppression. It is not
their own zeal, but His, by which they are
inspired, when heroic missionaries venture
into the dark depths of unknown continents,
and imperil their lives among barbarous
races to rescue them from heathen ignorance
and vice. And when, after the exhausting
work of the week, frail girls and youths for-
get their weariness in the enthusiasm which
moves them to teach little children the truths
of the Christian Gospel, it is because the mind
that is in Christ, is in them ; His love
is shed abroad in their hearts, and it is not
they that live, but Christ that liveth in
them. Yes, He ever liveth, not only to
make intercession for us, but to be the
spring and inspiration of every virtue
and grace which ennobles the character of
saints, and of every merciful work by which
mankind are blessed, _ Again I say that
our Congregational polity is rooted and
grounded in the faith that Christ ever liveth,
and that Christian people are one in Him,
and we should be earnestly endeavoring to
realize the great conception that underlies our
polity, determining to make it evident that
the history of Christ on earth is not over,
but that He is still a living presence and a
living power among those who gather to-
gether in His name. Men speculate some-
times about the future of Congregational
Churches. We can determine the future
for ourselves. Content yourselves with the
traditions and customs of your fathers, and
no matter how devout and saintly your fa-
thers were, the future cannot be yours. Trust
the living Christ to teach you the truth con-
cerning the internal, to reveal to you new
ideals of Christian character, and new glories
and sublimities of Christian worship, and
the future is yours because the future is
Christ's. We have faith in the destinies of
the Churches to which we belong, because
we believe that so long as they dwell in
Christ and Christ dwells iu them, the ex-
ceeding greatness of the power of God is
theirs.
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14,
The delegates and friends met in large
numbers in Stow Lecture Hall on Wednes-
day, After the usual devotional service the
Rev. W. R. Fletcher took the chair, and the
Conference was resumed.
The following paper, forwarded by Pro-
fessor Gosman of Victoria, was read by the
Rev. J. J. Halley
IMPERIAL FEDERATION AND CON-
GREGATIONALISM.
Hy PROFESSOR GOSMAN, of Melbourne.
I. It may be laid down and accepted as a
general principle, that our Church life, like a
river, is coloured by the soil through which
it flows, and is modified by the forces it may
happen to meet with in its course. The dis-
cussions of theNicene fathers as to form
were the reflex of Neo-platonism, even if it
should be granted that as regards
their matter they were Paulini and
scriptural. Knight-erranty and the Crus-
ades were much in common. They can
both be traced to that marvellous uprising of
emotion throughout Christendom, when the
Winter of the dark ages was beginning to relax
its hold, and the quickening influences of the
coming spring were stirring into activity all
the vital forces of society, No one can fail to
observe the close connection that exists be-
tween the period of the Commonwealth of Eng-
land, and the ecclesiastical independency of
the era. And as for Presby terianism, whatever
may be said for or against it by copious
quotations from the New Testament, the fact
remains that it is, at least to a very large
extent, the religious side of Scottish nation-
ality. We have, in fact, illustrations of this
principle in the sacred writings. The
theology of the book of Job, although not
vitiated by eastern speculation, has at the
same time its Jewish sitting relieved by
orient colours. The Calvinism of the schools
although professedly drawn from Scripture,
and welded togother by the strongest iron bands
of logic ever forged, was to a very large ex-
tent also the outcome of the philosophical
thought of the age and the political move-
ments of the day. The governmental develop-
ment in the nature of God, the most
prominent feature in the theology of the


Puritans, is not inconsistent with the
doctrine of the divine Fatherhood, however
much this age may seem to regard them as
incompatible. Whether we like it or not
then we also are affected by our environment,
and our safety lies, not in trying foolishly to
ignore it, or to lift ourselves out of it, but to
understand it, and to guide ourselves wisely
in the midst of it, and so, according to the
Divine purpose, to benefit by it. 11.
Amongst the many movements of the day
that cannot fail to affect our Church life,
there are two that deserve special prominence
at this Jubilee Conference, because of their
bearing on our cherished Congregationalism.
The first is that which clothes itself with the
demands for local management and control
in our civic and provincial affairs, and whose
loudest word at present is " Home Rule for
Ireland." This movement, for convenience
sake, we may call the centrifugal force in our
national life. The other is that larger move-
ment for Colonial and Imperial Federation
which we may call the centripetal force.
This latter movement has passed out of the
region of speculative politics; and while it
supplies a harmless theme for after-dinner
speeches to men in authority, when it might
be inconvenient to discuss matters that are
not ripe enough to be brought under the light
of public opinion, it is rapidly rising into one
of the most important public questions of
the day. It is a remarkable circumstance
that these two movements are not only con-
temporaneous, but cover a very large area of
political opinion, are compatible and supple-
mentary. Where, however, the contripetal
sentiment overbalances the contrifugal the
necessity for maintaining the integrity of the
Empire sweeps away the question of Home
Rule for Ireland, on the ground that it is
the first step in the direction of the dis-
memberment of the Empire. But where the
centrifugal is the preponderating force,
justice to Ireland is conceded, Dot only on
the ground of policy, but the rights of men
and nations. When these two forces are in
equipoise, Home Rule for Ireland is not
regarded as inconsistent with Imperial Fede-
ration ; and there are those who are already
beginning to see that the success of the
movement for drawing closer together the
bonds of Empire is the solution of the so-
called Irish question. 111. It is not the pur-
pose of this paper to discuss these two
movements in their political aspects, but to
enquire how far they touch our Church life
and affect it, and to what extent they may be
supposed to modify our ecclesiastical institu-
tions. In so far as the tendency of political
thought trends in the direction of local con-
trol or provincial government we are not
likely to be modified or affected by it at all,
simply for this reason, that we have already
developed our Congregational liberty as far
as it is possible to go. Independency is Home
Rule in its simplest and most elementary
form. Anything beyond this, if it were
possible, would leave us no home to rule. In
our ecclesiastical polity the unit of reck-
oning and combination is the congrega-
tion ; nor is there any evidence to show that
centrifugal force which works in the direc-
tion of Congregationalism is being either
checked or diminished. We feel that we
have at least solved one great ecclesiastical
problem in the assertion and maintenance of
Congregationalism, and we believe with the
strength of a conviction which experience
has ratified, that whatever modifications
composite ecclesiastical bodies may receive
in the immediate future from these political
environments, Congregational liberty is not
in the least likely to be either invaded or
circumscribed. One of the most prominent
features in the legislation of Britain and her
colonies at the present day is to let the
churches alone ; and for that policy, in so far
only as it does not spring from the assump-
tion that the State has nothing to do with
religion, we are devoutly thankful. There
are no threatening clouds hanging on our
horizon at present in reference to this great
question of Congregational liberty. We are
emphatically free, and what is more con-
tented. To all in authority we say let us
alone that we may enjoy our liberty. And
to those who do not enjoy the same amount
of freedom, we have only to say that it is a
devout and unselfish wish on our part that
they also may speedily enjoy what we prize
so highly. There is nothing either in the
state of the ecclesiastical world to engender
any nervous fear, that the full and complete
triumph of Congregationalism may be inde-
fiuitely delayed, but everything to inspire us
with confidence and hope. IY. But the
relation of Congregationalism to the federal
movement is by no means so clear and
assured. It is not that we are altogether
exempt from the centripetal forces that are
ever putting forth their energies within the
social and religious sphere, but no section of
the Church has been less influenced by this
movement than ourselves. Congregational-
ism and Catholicism represent the extremes
in what may be called constructive ecclesias-
ticism. In this connection we may remark
in passing that it would be an interesting
inquiry to discover the reasons why the
Catholicity of the Church of Rome, for exam-
ple, has succeeded in completely crushing
Congregationalism ; and why Congregation-
alism, as we know it and give expression to
it has little or nothing of Catholicity in it,
knows nothing of it in fact, save as the
impracticable dream of some religious vision-
aries. At the same time it must be acknow-
ledged that at no period in our history were
we content to assert Congregationalism pure
and simple. The Independency of to-day at
least is highly organized, and is certainly
more complex than it was fifty years ago.
We have everywhere our country associa-
tions and National Unions. We have
theological colleges for the training
of ministers, and funds for their relief
when no longer able for active service,
building associations spring up here and
there to assist Churches to erect suitable
places of worship in localities where the
necessities of the district are in excess of its
resources. Through the London Missionary
Societies our Churches endeavour by their
free contributions to carry the gospel to the
heathen in accordance with the command
of Christ. The federal spirit manifests itself
in Jubilee gatherings like the present, and in


conferences and deputations from one part of
the Empire to another, and what is more
striking still, there is the fact of the similar-
ity of our modes of worship thoughout the
whole extent nearly of Congregational ser-
vice. Any one with the terrors of Indepen-
dency in his priestly soul would be apt to
think that in the absence of an enforced
litnrgy Congregational worship would be
sure to run into extravagance or vulgarity.
But the logic of fact here is dead against the
licence of fear, for there is more real same-
ness in our modes of worship where the
congregations are absolutely free to regulate
their own forms than in churches when the
order is determined for them. Our service of
praise and song for example is pretty much
the same in all our Churches, and it requires
a considerable amonnt of ministerial talent
to make any striking or original arrangement
or novelty in the "order of service." But
notwithstanding these facts, our organiza-
tions, even from a Congregational point of view
are defective and might with advantage come
more under the federal principle, a force that is
ever working in the direction of a free and
enlightened Catholicism. Our organizations
and institutions seem to me to be open to the
two following objections. First, they are not
so closely associate I with the Churches as
they ought to be, and as they may be, with-
out the sacrifice of any portion of Congrega-
tional liberty. They depend upon the
Churches for their existence and manage-
ment, and yet the Churches as such have no
direct control over them. Our colleges for
example while they exist for the benefit of
the Churches, and while they are for the
most part supported by them, are yet not
directly under the control of the Churches,
and there is nothing to prevent the govern-
ing body from regarding the interests of the
denomination as secondary to the mainten-
ance of their own authority. Our societies
and institutions have been on the whole
conducted with great wisdom and unselfish
devotion to our principles, but still it is
largely an unsolved problem how to bring
them into closer connection with the
Churches. If the congregation is the organic
unit, it should enter into every organization
whose functions go beyond those of the
primary germ. At present, the institutions
outside the Churches are themselves units
with a good deal of the pertinancy that be-
long to the unite that have a strong con-
sciouness of the individual life in them, and are
free from the dreams of a higher development.
In the second place our Congregational insti-
tutions are not themselves bound together
by any vital link of connection. The Colo-
nial Missionary Society has nothing to do
do with the London Missionary Society.
Our colleges stand apart, each within its own
academic borders, whereas there is nothing
that I can see to prevent them being a cluster
of confederate colleges, with Mansfield, in
Oxford, at their head. The existence of the
" Senatus Academicus," in England, was an
important step in the direction of federation,
but much remains to conquer still, while the
theory of the separate existence of institu-
tions is still the dominant thought in our go-
verning bodies. V. Bet us now glance for a
little at some of those ecclesiastical neces-
sities that may arise in the midst of us were
imperial federation to become an accom-
plished fact. By such federation I mean
the legislative union of the whole empire for
certain definite purposes, such as defence,
postal communication and internationalism,
We are one people and one empire at pre-
sent. We are all British subjects, and the
Queen is the visible embodiment of our unity.
But we are not constitutionally one for Im-
perial purposes. There are four millions of
people in these Australian lands that have
no voice in determining the foreign policy of
England, We may be reminded that we are
also free from the taxation required to up-
hold such policy. We are free from direct
taxation, it is true, but in the event of war,
we in these colonies would have to take part
in a quarrel we had not provoked, and to de-
fend ourselves against an enemy we had not
offended. The present relation of the colo-
nies to the mother country will give rise, in
the immediate future, either to separation or
Imperial Federation. There is no other al-
ternative. While the difficulties of federa-
tion are acknowledged to be many and great,
its achievement is ardently hoped for, because
of the strong repugnance felt everywhere,
and by almost every one to the notion of sepa-
ration. The prevailing sentiment in largely
in favour of maintaining the Imperial con-
nection. Now, assuming, as I have said, the
realisation of this dream of a British Empire
encircling the globe like a belt, how would
such a federation affect our Congregational-
ism ? Can there be any doubt that it would
give rise to the necessity of an Imperial Con-
gregational Council? Su"h an organization
would have the same relation to the empire
as the Congregational Union of England and
Wales to that portion of the British people
within these geographical boundaries. To
such a council may be referred, in the first
place, the important question of a denomina-
tional literature. A religious body that does
not, as such, produce a literature, has failed
to fulfil one of the most important functions
for which it was called into existence. It is
acknowledged with gratitude and pride that
the contributions to sacred literature by In-
dependents will bear favourable comparison
with those of other bodies ; but our achieve-
ment in this direction would have been
richer and larger, had we as a body risen to
the perception that the creation of a sacred
literature was as necessary to our healthy exis-
tence, as the accumulation of wealth to the
prosperity of the state. It is said sometimes
that we are, as a body, not large enough to
maintain a highly educated class of men
whose duty it would be to enrich our theo-
logical stores of knowledge by their undis-
turbed investigations ; but that difficulty
would disappear, if it ever existed, by en-
larging the area of readers, and making it
co-extensive with the empire. To such a
body also may appropriately be referred the
Service of Song in the House of the Lord.
A hymn-book for the churches of the empire
must not abound in figures and references
that have little or no meaning outside of
England. We can no longer, in these South-
ern climes, give out, in the presence of our


native-born, these lines, to say nothing of
their poetic merit
" I thank the goodness and the grace
That on my birth have smiled,
And made me in these Christian times
A happy English child."
Our churches will in all probability adopt
any new hymn book the Congregational
Union of England may publish; but its
adoption would be a matter of course,
and of heartiness had we been in any
way consulted in the revision. This is
not said by way of complaint, but
in the interests of a healthy representation.
It now only remains for me to refer to two
other functions that such an Imperial Coun-
cil may discharge with dignity and effect.
The time is at hand when interdenomina-
tionalism. like internationalism will assert
itself, and be recognized as one of the most
important constructive forces of our modern
church life. We are in these colonies much
nearer the border-land of mutual recognition
and co-operation than our friends in the
home country, still overshadowed by a State
Church, whose arrogance and assumption at
this distance are more amusing than obnox-
ious. Now if Protestantism is ever to pre-
sent an organic unity to the world, the goal
must be reached, not by the disintegration of
existing ecclesiastical bodies, but by some
bond of union on the basis of their present
existence. And no body could act for us
better or more accurately represent us than
an Imperial Congregational Council. At the
risk of being considered by some an ecclesi-
astical fossil, or by others a mere visionary
in relation to the future, I cannot refrain
from expressing my conviction that our Con-
gregational notions require, or will shortly
require, re-adjustment with regard to the
relation of the State to religion and to the
Churches. The battle of religious establish-
ments, as far as the principle is concerned, is
fought out; and we only wait now
with hopeful interest, now ill-concealed
impatience, its applications in the free
dom and emancipation of all State-
maintained Churches. We are not envious
of those who receive State pay for the
the performance of ecclesiastical duties ; and
we try to be charitable even when we are
looked down upon by them as if we were an
inferior race. For the sake of those who
from their official position are tempted to
put on lofty airs of superiority, and for the
sake of religion itself, _we labour for their
freedom, and we rejoice to believe that
already the rosy fingers of dawn herald the
day of their deliverance from the thraldom
of State Churchism. But the State need
not cease to be religious, although it has
disestablished that portion of the Church
formerly endowed and exclusively recog-
nized by it. It is a perilous position to take
up and say that the State has nothing to do
with religion. Are we to withdraw as
churches from all political affairs, and let the
tide of atheistic secularism that is threaten-
ing to engulf the nations of Europe come in
upon us like a flood, and sap the foundations
of a civilization that has taken centuries to
build up? The State cannot cease to be
religious without becoming not non-religious—
irreligious; and if the State is religious, the
existence of Churches cannot be ignored, and
if the Churches cannot be ignored, we cannot
be ignored. There are great events and crises
in our national life in which the utterance
of religious emotion is the only fitting ex-
pression. To stand aside with cold indiffer-
ence, or to be put aside with haughty
contempt on such great occasions is not a
pleasant reflection. The late J übilee of the
Queen, could not have been appropriately
celebrated unless the nation had assembled to
give thanks to Almighty God, the King of
Kings and Lord of Lords, and I for one
felt the uprising of indignation and _ shame
that we as a body had no active part in that
religious service. We were there simply as
spectators, cornered and out of sight. From
a national point of view we _ had as much
right to be there taking an active part in the
nations devotions, as the dignitaries of the
Church of England. Westminster Abbey
and St. Pauls' belong to the people, and
when the nation, by its representatives,
assemble in either of those national temples
for prayer and thanksgiving, by what right
are we shut out ? if we have rights in this
direction, we must not refrain from giving
them expression, and in no better way can
they be expressed and enforced than by the
creation of an Imperial Congregational
Council.
In the course of the discussion, Dr. DALE
criticised the paper at length. Their first
concern was to increase the fidelity and
force of the unit of Congregational organ-
ization. He deprecated any course that
might lead to weakening the vigour of the
germ of their ecclesiastical life. It was ad-
visable that the Unions in Australia should
send such men as Mr. Fletcher, Dr. Jefferis,
and Mr. Clarke to England at certain inter-
vals in order that the Congregational Union
of England and Wales might have the bene-
fit of their experience.
THE NEW HEBRIDES.
The Rev. JOSEPH KING moved the following
resolution " That this Conference views
with deep concern and sympathy the difficul-
ties which our Presbyterian missionary
brethren in the New Hebrides are experienc-
ing, and the injury which has been done to
the native population by the continued pres-
sure and interference of French officials in
that group, who, regardless of the agreement
between the English and French guaranteeing
the independence of the New Hebrides, have
established a military station on one of the
islands, and are assuming an authority in
connection with the land, in which the rights
of the natives and the missionaries who are
British subjects are ignored; that we join
in the appeal which the Presbyteries of Vic-
toria have forwarded to the British Govern-
ment asking that prompt consideration
may be given to the existing state of affairs ;
and that this resolution be forwarded through
the Governor of South Australia to the
Colonial Society in London." There were
timeß when the Churches in federation had
a right to utter their voice in regard to State
questions, and in considering this matter the
Conference should remember that the London
Missionary Society had been the first to


carry the gospel to the New Hebrides. They
ought to do what they could to help their
Presbyterian brethren, and to seek to main-
tain inviolate the treaty which England had
made with France.
The Rev. Dr. ROSEBY seconded, but not
without diffidence. Political action moved,
as all action did, along the line of least re-
sistance, and if religious denominations could
give due prominence to the particular in-
terests they represented, that would operate
as an important factor in stimulating the
Government. They should not assume too
quiescent an attitude. (Hear, hear.)
The Rev. J. JOHNSTON believed that a joint
occupation of the islands by the English and
French would be the best solution of the
difficulty.
The Rev. Dr. JEFFERIS opposed the mo-
tion on the ground that Religious Societies
should keep clear of political complications
as far as possible. When the London Mis-
sionary Society laboured under grievances
similar to that felt by the Presbyterians they
did not employ missionaries to stump
different places in order to excite an inflam-
matory public opinion, but they calmly and
quietly pressed their case upon the attention
of the Government. It was quite possible
that a proud nation like France would re-
quire very little provocation to break off
friendly relations with England, and a war
between the two countries might ensue. The
matter might safely be left in the hands of
the Government.
Mr. J. M. DOWIE supported the motion.
The Rev. S. HEBDITCH thought it most
unlikely that England or France would be so
stupid as to go to war on the question. They
were right in showing that the French were
acting unreasonably.
The Rev. Dr. BEVAN thought the resolution
might be modified, so as to be a little less
fault finding towards the French. It was
necessary to keep the nose of the Govern-
ment to the grindstone—(laughter)—but
they should be careful to avoid anything
that might provoke hostile feeling on
the part of the French. England
was a most moral country, and
had always disliked war—(laughter)—
and yet when it was stated that Russia had
advanced her frontier a little bit nearer
Afghanistan some time ago the whole country
howled with delight when Mr. Gladstone
flung down the gauntlet and threatened war
against Russia. So it was quite possible that
this question might lead to war, unless the
Government exercised great care. He moved
—"That this Conference views with deep con-
cern and sympathy the difficulties which our
Presbyterian missionary brethren in the New
Hebrides are experiencing, and the injury
which is being done to the native population
by the failure to carry out the agreement
between the English and French Govern-
ment guaranteeing the independence of the
New Hebrides, and would urge upon the
English Government the necessity of a
settlement of this question as quickly
as possible, alike in the interests of
the Empire and of the natives, and
for the assurance of the rights and liberties
of the subjects of all nations, and especially
those engaged in the religious instruction of
the people, and that a copy of this resolu-
tion be sent to the Home Government and
the Board of Presbyterian Missions."
The Rev. J. KING accepted this motion in
lieu of the original proposition.
Mr. A. SPICER thought that in Dr. Bevan's
remarks they had a modus vivendi. France
was a proud and sensitive nation, and was
longing for an opportunity to lecover her
military prestige. They should act mode-
rately and firmly, and go direct to the Go-
vernment.
Mr. J. MULLENS spoke in strong terms of
the indignities which the natives of the New
Hebrides and other islands had suffered at
the hands of the French.
The Rev. W. LAW moved and the Rev. Dr.
JEFFERIS seconded the following amend-
ment " That this Conference records its
sincere sympathy with the Presbyterian
Missions "in their difficulties in the New
Hebrides, and expresses its hope that the
negotiations pending between the English and
French Governments upon the question of
the New Hebrides will soon be brought to
an amicable and satisfactory conclusion, and
that a copy of this resolution be sent to the
Home Government and to the Board of
Presbyterian Missions."
The Rev. G. CLARKE supported. Nothing
should be done that would help to impair
the friendly relations of England and France.
The Rev. J. J. HALLEY ridiculed the
amendment as being devoid of backbone, and
urged the Conference to lend a helping hand
to the Presbyterians with a view of compell-
ing the French to respect the treaty entered
into with England.
After further discussion the amendment was
rejected, and Dr. Bevan's motion was carried
by a large majority.
THE GUARD OF HONOUR TO CARDINAL MORAN.
During the discussion on Professor
Gosman's paper the Rev. C. MANTHORPE
called attention to the following extract
from the Register report of the proceedings
in connection with the investiture of Arch-
bishop Reynolds at the Roman Catholic
Cathedral on Sunday last: —" The Perma-
nent Force in their handsome uniforms under
Lieutenant HawUer filed in along the aisle
for the Cardinal, but the crush was so great
that they had to occupy seats in the western
aisle." He wanted to know by what right
members of the Permanent Force were sent
to Church to do honour to a Cardinal or
any one else. (Hear, hear.) Why not send
them to Stow Church? (Hear, hear.) He
noticed that Mr. Rees was going to ask in
Assembly, "Why was not the State carriage
of the South Australian Rail ways placed at the
disposal of His Eminence ?" Why should it not
have been placed at his disposal? (Laughter.)
The CHAIRMAN— ProbanIy, if the carriage
had been placed at the Cardinal's disposal
Mr. Rees would have been the first to have
asked how it came about. (Laughter). The
Rev. Dr. BEVAN— Perhaps it is satire on the
part of Mr. Rees. (Hear, hear). The mattei
then dropped.
VOTE OF THANKS.
After the luncheon delegates from the
colonies spoke on a motion by the Rey. J, J.


HALLEY, expressing their high sense of the
hospitality afforded them daring their visit
to Adelaide. The motion was carried by
ringing cheers, and the CHAIRMAN and Mr.
DOOLETTE replied in suitable terms.
CONGREGATIONALISM IN THE AB-
SENCE OF CHURCH CONFLICT.
BY THE REV. JOSEPH WALKER, OP IPSWICH.
The title of this paper assumes as a fact
in the history of Congregationalism that it
has played an important part in connection
with Church conflicts. We are not ashamed
of this part of our denominational history
but we do not, even at this Jubilee celebra-
tion, desire to give it undue emphasis or pro-
minence. What our fathers have done in
this direction, they have not done from in-
clination, but from necessity. They have
seen great principles in peril, they have seen
exclusive and intolerant sections of the
Christian Church claiming for themselves
alone spiritual rights and privileges which
are the common heritage of all believers, and
they felt that they could not be loyal to con-
science and to God, without fighting the
battle of spiritual democracy against any
form of religious intolerance and sacerdotal-
ism. We have not the power to forget what
they did, and God forbid that either we or
our children should ever have the desire to
do so. The presence of Dr. Dale at this
Conference is a reminder to us of how he
and others, like-minded, have entered the
arena of conflict, and in the dear mother-
land have fought for those principles of
individual right and spiritual freedom which
are the very lifeblood of Congregationalism
throughout the world. Some of us who have
some claim to be called " old colonists,"
remember something of colonial conflicts
which we were permitted to share, and
which resulted in religious freedom being, as
we believe, permanently secured to the
colonies. The writer of this paper, then only
half a Congregationalist, was associated with
the late George Barker and A. M. Henderson,
and many now living and valued friends, in
the last agitation in the colony of Victoria
for the abolition of state aid to religion.
We have heard the story of the struggle for
religious freedom in the three older colonies,
graphically told at this Conference by Dr.
Jefferis and Revs. Halley and Cox. But let
me emphasise for a moment the part that the
pioneers played in those struggles, and the
testimony since borne from different quarters
to the value of their work. South Australia
especially, claims this recognition from some
visitor to this conference. We thank God
for the gifted, sagacious, and courageous min-
ister, the Rev. T. Q. Stow sent as our first
representative to South Australia. We
must not lose sight of him and his work, as
we call to mind that this colony was the first
to throw off the incubus of state aid to religion,
and this step was taken with so much advan-
tage to the interests of religion, that the
members of the synod of the English Church
in South Australia could say in an address
presented to their Bishop on the 19th of Feb-
ruary, 1866, "If we test the provision for
the spiritual wants of our people by a com-
parison with other colonies, we find we have
about one clergyman for every twelve hun-
dred of the Church population, which is
more than three times the provision made in
the neighbouring and far wealthier colony of
Victoria. When moreover it is considered
that there is no state aid to religion, that we
have for many years been left to our own re-
sources the existing
state of the Church seems more encouraging
than the most sanguine could have beforehand
ventured to hope for." That is a very re-
markable testimony to the soundness of our
principles, and also to the value of a measure
that was so unwillingly received by those
who afterwards spoke those words. I can-
not refrain from quoting a paragraph from
" Foster's South Australia," written in 1866,
respecting the Congregationallsts of this
colony. He says " The Independents are
active politicians, and possess an influence
disproportional to their numbers. They have
obtained a great hold upon the press of the
colonies, and their influence seems likely to
leave a permanent impress upon the
character of those who shall constitute the
future people of Australia." Gentlemen of
this Conference, that is not more historically
true than it is prophetically and practically
suggestive. Before proceeding to indicate
some features of our mission—our peaceful
mission in the future—suffer a brief reference
to my own colony " Sunny Queensland." We
are but a few people altogether, very few when
compared with our wide extent of territory,
with its genial climate, and its truly wonder-
ful resources. We Congregationalists are
only a few amongst this few but we have not
been altogether unworthy of our traditions
and principles. How we have influenced
legislation in the direction of spiritual free-
dom and equality is eloquently told in the
little volume on "Congregationalism in
Queensland," recently published by
my venerable and modest friend Mr.
George Wight, the chairman of our
Union. He himself, at the formation
of the colony was the leader in the press and
on the platform of the political Independents
of that period. They were contemptuously
called by the Premier of Queensland in 1860,
"A small section of Independents," but they
nevertheless according to his confession, and
also to his annoyance, so laboured, that they
impressed the community with their views
and secured early in the history of the colony
a national system of education; and the
abolition of all State aid to religion. Enough
has been said of our church conflicts in the
past. Others have laboured, nobly laboured,
in this direction, and we have entered into
their labours. But let me ask, is the necessity
for religious conflict entirely at an end in
these colonies ? The victory of religious
equality has been won all along the line, so
far as the Statute book is concerned, but the
spirit of exclusiveness and intolerance is not
yet extinct. The necessity for watchfulness,
and if need be, for conflict, will not cease
until the little irritating relics of a by-gone
supremacy are abandoned. Let me illustrate
what I mean —At the opening of the last two
sessions of Parliament in Queensland, digni-
taries of the English Church have had places
of honour assigned to them on the floor of the


House, while the Rev. E. Griffith, a true
Congregational Bishop for over a quarter of a
century, and the father of the Premier, found
his place in the gallery. And only last
Sunday, in this city, a company of citizen
soldiers, in official uniform, are said to have
attended at the Catholic Cathedral as a guard
of honour to Cardinal Moran. These may be
little matters in themselves and scarcely
worthy of notice in this Conference, but the
spirit that arranges and accepts them is the
spirit that would take us back, if that were
possible, to the hard and unchristian ex-
clusiveness of the past. Leaving this part
of my subject, with the gentle warning which
my illustrations suggest, let me say that it
appeared to me as I pondered over the title
of this paper, that there is in it a kind of
wondering element as to whether Con-
gregationalists, in the absence of church
conflict, will have any valid reason for their
separate ecclesiastical existence. For my part
I do not think we are the Ishmaelites of the
Christian church, though we have sometimes
been compelled to take the thankless position
of its prophet and schoolmaster. Even the
most warlike among our brotherhood, say
for instance Dr. Dale and his venerable
friend and colleague in conflict, Mr. Rogers,
would not be sorry to And that part of their
occupation gone, which has brought them
into antagonistic relations with other
churches. Except in rare instances Church con-
flict of any kind has been unwelcome work to
Congregationalists, and has only been under-
taken because of its stern necessity: a
necessity which could not be ignored without
a personal sense of disloyalty to conscience
and to God. So that if we can be for ever freed
from this constraining influence towards
ecclesiastical warfare—that is, freed from it
by their being no occasion for it, we shall
turn with grateful hearts to give ourselves
more completely to that higher work which
our One Master has given us to do. Does
this seem to hint at our possible neglect of
this higher work in the past ? Our reply is
that as a denomination, we have never claimed
absolute perfection for our Church work,
hardly even for our Church polity. So that
if we admit that Church conflict has some-
times hindered our more spiritual work, this
is a confession we need not be ashamed to
make, and which may be a necessary pre-
liminary to greater faithfulness and progress
in the future. When a nation is in conflict,
it is not to be wondered at if its internal
development is hindered, and its chief
interests are made to suffer. But when a
nation is at peace, its true policy is to build
up itself from within, and strive after its
ideal in condition and development. So with
Congregationalism, the splendid services
rendered by our fathers in struggling under
manifold disabilities for the largest measure
of spiritual freedom has excused and in part
accounted for some defects in our methods
of work and our numerical feebleness as
compared with other great Churches. But
now that we have the fullest measure of
freedom, the freedom for which our fathers
struggled and suffered, we ought not to be
content unless we see our Churches manifest-
ing the highest spiritual life, and striving to
accomplish all the purposes for which
Christian churches are called into existence.
It is not enough to have a name that is
synonymous with high spiritual aims and
great religious principles. If we would have
others take us at our own valuation we must
show in concrete forms how lofty and un-
selfish is the character of our spiritual life ;
and how specially adapted our Congregational
principles and methods of Christian work
are to win sinful men to Christ, and to build
them up in the strength and beauty of holiness.
None of us, I trust, are insensible to the
value of our work in the past. We are here
at this Conference to rejoice over past
acheivements, and to thank God for what He
has accomplished through our Congregational
ancestors and pioneers. But we are here also
to look our position fairly in the face, and to
gird up ourselves for the greater work that is
awaiting us in the future. In this spirit let
me suggest, that in the absence of ecclesias-
tical conflict, we must pay more and more
attention to our spiritual life. In this lies
our potency and all the possibilities of growth
and success. Congregationalism is only
another name for spiritual life and loyalty
to Jesus Christ. The absence of these
in our brotherhood means weakness,
discomfiture, and death. With our high spir-
itual claims we must have a lofty spiritual
standard. What synods and conferences do
for other religious bodies Jesus Christ work-
ing in the spiritual life of our people must do
for us. In the presence of such life, and by
its force and power our ministerial and other
difficulties will be best adjusted. A minister
remaining as the pastor of a church after his
work is manifestly done in connection with
that fellowship, will be impossible if minister
and people alike are in living touch with the
presence of Christ, and their supreme desire
is to do His will; and, on the other hand,
this lofty spiritual life will in some form pro-
vide at least a maintenance for all who are
called to be ministers of Christ's gospel, so
that their duty to Christ and His Church
may not be made harassing and difficult by
the fear of want. There are other difficulties
that will be present in your minds, such as
the relation which our large and small
churches bear to each other. But we have
no power to legislate for these on any hard
and fast lines, and thank God we do not need
to do it. The throbs of a healthy spiritual
life leading us to feel that we are all brethren
will more effectually adjust these matters
than any kind of merely mechanical legislation.
In the absence of ecclesiastical conflict Congre-
gationalism must keep itself in touch with
all moral and social questions that are press-
ing for solution. The land and labour ques-
tions are to the front, and we cannot be true
to our fundamental ideas of a Congregational
Church and ignore them. It has been said
that ours is the Church of the middle classes,
that the poor, as we understand the term in
these colonies, are scarcely found in our
brotherhood. If there is much truth in that
statement, God have mercy upon us, for we
have grievously departed from the spirit of
Christ, and unless we retrace our steps our
doom as a Christian Church is Bealed. If we
admit the statement in part let us look upon


this as one of the defects in our condition
and method of working, and apply the remedy
as soon as possible. Among the questions
that are pressing for solution which we can-
uot, as Congregational Churches, ignore is
the great drink question, From my life-long
interest in this subject I may almost claim to
speak as in some degree a specialist. I would
not lay down to this Conference any definite
line of action, which all its members ought to
take, but, remembering the enormous and
wide-spreading evils of intemperance, how
we are sending this withering vice into every
country where we send our missionaries and
our commerce, I do ask, passionately ask,
that our Congregational Churches should in
some way bear distinct and emphatic testi-
mony against this terrible evil. This fair
city of Adelaide has a good Congregational
record on this question. The first temper-
ance meeting ever held in this city was held
by permission of the Rev. T. Q. Stow, in the
earliest Congregational Church building ever
reared in this colony; and the first minister
of religion who joined himself to the temper-
ance cause in Adelaide, was the Rev. Mr.
Watt, formerly Congregational minister of
Hindmarsh. Differing in our views on this
subject, and also in our practice, we must be
at one in regarding intemperance as a mon-
ster evil; and we can and ought in some way
to bear our testimony against it. In the ab-
sence of ecclesiastical conflict we ought to
show to the world that our individual free-
dom as Congregationalists is allied to an
intense and passionate love for souls, and an
absorbing desire for their salvation. I re-
member being startled some years ago on
reading a statement in one of the reviews,
that " the Congregationalists, as a body, had
never been associated with any great religi-
ous movement or revival among the people."
I am not prepared to say whether that state-
ment is true or not; but, so far as the colo-
nies are concerned, I fear that it is so. We
have received into our churches those who
have been converted to Christ through the
evangelistic labours of William Taylor, Mat-
thew Burnett, and Dr. Somerville ; but we
have sent back no returning contingent of
converts to which these brethren belong.
What is the reason of this? This question
should be seriously pondered by all of us. If
our very polity throws us directly upon the
grace and guidance of Jesus Christ, two re-
sults at least should follow. We ought to
catch from Christ himself that passionate
love for souls which was a consuming fire in
His own heart. And, with our other advan-
tages, we ought to be able to labour for souls
in what is called evangelistic work, without
so much of that ignorance and unhealthy
sensationalism which frequently characterise
this form of Christian work. I would res-
pectfully press the importance of this work
on these grounds : —l. It is necessary that we
may fulfil all the functions of a Christian
Church. 2. The spiritual life of many of our
people will not be enriched and satisfied
without it. 3. It is necessary, if we are to
keep our young people, to do this we must
win them to the Saviour. It is also neces-
sary, if we would secure a succession of de-
vout and gifted young men for our ministry.
We are continually drawing to our ranks
men who have been converted to Christ in
other communions—men who prizing our
freedom, come to us, desiring it as they de-
sire life. It would ill become me, as one
who has been generously received into this
Congregational liberty, to say one word
against this exodus that is continually going
on. But let me say this, that while we are
attracting to our freer ministry teachers
from other folds, we are not reaching and
attracting to our ministry the young people
within our own churches. Nor shall we do
so on any large scale until we labour on the
lines of Christian intelligence and consecra-
tion for revivals of that kind so beautifully
described by Mr. Hebditch. Let me say in
conclusion that the trend of the age is more
and more towards democracy. Mere autho-
rity in the form of kingcraft or priestcraft
was never held in less respect than now.
We, as Christian democrats, have done some-
thing towards moulding the spirit of the age.
We have diffused the principle of Congrega-
tional freedom far beyond the bounds of our
denomination. We rejoice together in what
has been accomplished; but our mission is
not yet fulfilled. Let us keep up the stand-
ard of education and intelligence in our min-
istry, always having due regard to the free
working of the Spirit of Cod. Let us prize
our spiritual freedom, and strive after the
highest personal purity and righteousness,
and above all let us seek the living presence
of a living Saviour, and the living baptism
of the Holy Ghost, and the future of Congre-
gationalism in these lands shall be brighter
than the past, and not unworthy of those
noble men, our colonial fathers whose work
and memory we revive to-day.
Discussions were afterwards resumed on
papers dealing with the responsibility of the
Churches to the young and the present
aspects of theology and science.
THE NEXT CONFERENCE.
The Rev. J. WALKER moved —" That the
next Intercolonial Conference be held in
Melbourne in connection with the jubilee
celebration of the Victorian Congregational
Churches next year; that at that Conference
the subject of future Intercolonial Con-
ferences be considered ; and that a committee
be appointed to draw up rules for such Con-
ferences, such committee to consist of the
Revs. S. Savage, J. C. McMichael, and J. J.
Halley." The Rev. J. C. KIRBY seconded.
Agreed to.
The following motion by the Rev. S. HEB-
DITCH, seconded by the Rev. F. W. Cox, was
then carried :—" That this Conference re-
quests that the Congregational Union of
England and Wales will send out a delega-
tion to the Intercolonial Conference which
will be held in Melbourne to celebrate the
centenary of Australia."
The question of publishing a colonial hymn-
book was briefly discussed, and remitted to
the Congregational Unions of the colonies to
bring before the next Conference.
CLOSING THE CONFERENCE.
At the suggestion of Dr. BEVAN it was
decided to close the Conference that evening.
Some business was accordingly postponed
until the meetings in Melbourne.


Votes of thanks were passed to the Press
and to the Chairman, and the meeting closed
with prayer.
" AT HOME" AT MONTEFIORE.
In the afternoon the delegates were enter-
tained by the Chief Justice at an " at home"
at Montefiore. Among those in attendance
were Dr. Dale and Mrs. and Miss Dale and
Mr. and Mrs. Spicer. The guests also included
a large number of ladies and gentlemen not
connected with the Congregational body.
Sir Henry Parkes, Sir Henry Ayers, and
several other prominent politicians were also
present. Refreshments were served in a
marquee, and music was provided. Alto-
gether a delightful hour or two were spent.
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15.
THE LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY.
On Thursday evening, Sept. 15. a meeting
to urge the claims of foreign missions was
held at Stow Church. Mr. R. Searle presided
over a large attendence.
Mr. A. SPICER (Treasurer of the London
Missionary Society) delivered a highly inter-
esting address on missions in India, narrating
chiefly his own experiences during a recent
tour through the principal States, visiting
the different mission stations. He took a
hopeful view of the work, and showed how,
apart from spiritual results, missionary agen-
cies had rendered most valuable services to
education, politics and commerce. He des-
cribed the opposition to Christianity offered
by the laws of caste, the superstitions and
the degraded condition of women, and made
a powerful appeal for further help te the
missions from the Christians of Australia.
Dr. DALE said —It would,! venture to think,
have been greatly to the advantage of the ob-
jects which this meeting has been called to
promote, if my friend Mr. Spicer had occupied
the whole of our time tbis evening. From
what you have heard from his lips you have
already discovered how large and how inti-
mate is his knowledge of Christian work in
India, and ho w deep and intense is the inter-
est he feels in it. While listening to him I
began to wonder whether any of us had done
anything to realise the solemnity, the pathos,
the grandeur of the work to which he has
been calling our attention. He was speaking
to you, gathered on these Australian shores of
250,000,000 or 300,000,000 of people, not stran-
gers. hardly foreigners, belonging to the same
empire as ourselves, loyal as we are to the
Queen. These people are within three weeks
sail from your ports. What is the real sig-
nificance of the whole of the speech which he
addressed to us ? What are the assumptions
underlying it, and underlying the work which
has drawn us together to-night ? I confess
that the more I consider these assumptions
the more profoundly am I impressed with the
mystery of our own relations to the Eternal,
and the mystery of the relations of different
parts of the human race to each other. One
of the assumptions on which our appeal to
you to-night rests is this: that every one of the
300,000,000 of people that are to be found be-
tween the Himalayas and Cape Comorin, is
infinitely dear to the heart of God, dearer
far than your children are to yourselves—that
every one of them, according to the Divine
thought and purpose, has been created to
bear the image of God, to inherit eternal
righteousness, eternal wisdom, and eternal
joy in the immediate presence of God. But
that the fulfilment of the Divine thought
and purpose has been made to depend
upon the energy of our love for them, upon
the intensity of our sympathy with Him who
came from the heights of God, to seek and to
save the lost. The trouble is that none of us
find adequate time to permit these great mys-
teries to sink into our thought, and to touch
our heart, and to take possession of those ac-
tive energies which they ought to control.
(Hear, hear.) My own impression is that
this missionary enterprise will never secure
its true place in the life of the Church, and
never command the resources it has a right to
receive, until there is a more serious intellec-
tual effort, as well as a more serious moral
effort to consider its vastness and its solem-
nity. (Hear, hear.) Most of us, I suppose,
have bad our imagination mastered during
the last few years by the mystery of God's
ways in relation to the visible universe. We
have discovered lately that the world has
not yet been created—that it is in process of
creation. We look back over immense ages
that defy all measurement, and we discover
all through the process of that movement
of the Divine energy which has at last resul-
ted in the magnificence and splendour, in the
terror and in the beauty of the visible uni-
verse by which we are environed—mysteries,
mysteries impenetrable to human vision.
Under our feet are the sepulchres of buried
races; every flower, every tree, every fish,
every bird, every creature that has been dis-
ciplined to the service of man, every creature
that has defied the sovereignty of man and
still ranges free in the forest and bush, has
an ancestry to be traced into the mist
and darkness of remote milleniums, and to
tbem all their present strength and grace has
come through periods of rivalry, of conflict,
of agony, and of death. The great process
is not yet complete, and for anything that we
know, the material universe which is our
home, may be only as yet in the very morning
of its history, and it may be in the Divine
thought and purpose to surround Him-
self, and to surround His creatures
with visible majesty and grandeur infinitely
transcending all those aspects of the material
world in which as yet we are familiar.
The human race, the millions of India
among them, belong in part to this natural
order But the gospel has revealed to us
that all who share the mysterious gifts and
powers of humanity, while on one side we
touch regions that are bound fast in the iron
chain of law; on the other we are akin to


Him by whom the universe was created and
Bhare the life of the Most High. But while
God has thus invested every man with these
mysterious powers and dignities, and while
in the goapel He has revealed the future to
which He has destined the human race in
Christ, He has made the actual achievement of
His purposes concerning us and concerning all
mankind dependent upon the manner in which
we to whom the gospel has come respond to
the great appeal, which the gospel makes to
the heart of the human race—the extent to
which we catch the spirit of Him concerning
whose grace and glory the gospel speaks,
and are content to labour and to suffer in
order that God's children may be brought
home to Himself. The discoveries of modern
science have revealed to us to what heights
life of the baser order may in the course
of long ages ascend. The Christian gospel
has revealed to us heights transcending all
hope and all thought, to which humanity
may reach and ascend if only it receives into
itself the life and the power of God, which
has been made aD inheritance in Christ
Jesus. But for this great development of our
nature—in order to lift our race to those
regal and immortal dignities for which it
was created, God appeals to us and makes
us comrades with himself, asks us to
share the labour that at last we may share
the glory and the joy. God created sun and
star without us. God created the majestic ele-
ments of the material world that awaken our
wonder and awe and admiration, without us.
But the grace and the beauty of that moral
and spiritual universe which is to crown all
the other achievements of the Most High
that these may be achieved God appeals
to us to show to our brethren the same
love that he has shown to ourselves.
That is the heart—that the principle of this
missionary enterprise. When I consider the
mystery and the glory of it, it seems to me
that it ought to touch our imagination, and
to fire our thought as no scientific discoveries
concerning the history of the material uni-
verse can do. (Cheers.) One of my most seri-
ous grounds of regret in relation to my own
personal life, and one of the most serious things
concerning which I wish to speak, is this,
that it seems to me that none of us give ade-
quate time to brood over these great things,
in order that the truths and facts that we
accept and believe may become as real and
august and as important to us as they should
be. (Hear, hear.) I ask you Christian people
in time to come, to endeavour in solitary
places, and at the feet of God, to master as
you have never mastered yet, the mystery
and the greatness of this missionary enter-
prise. I ask you to consider it in relation to
God himself. You know something of the
intense earnestness of God, for the salvation
of mankind. The energy of His love, as re-
vealed in Chrißt, has touched your own
hearts and has inspired your own faith.
You believe that when you confessed your sin
at His feet, He had infinite joy in granting
you remission of sins and the gfft ot eternal
life. You believe He was sad when you
wandered away from Him, and was glad
when you returned. Now I ask you not to be
content with listening to appeals from earnest
and impassioned speakers on missionary
work, but go into solitude, and to think of
soul after soul of the millions of India, re-
membering that each one is as dear to God as
you are, and to consider whether, although
in the deepest sense we may speak of the
"ever blessed" God, we must not imagine
and believe that as God looks upon those
millions, He is infinitely grieved that to them
there have never come those discoveries of His
grace that have come to you, and by which
you have been led to trust in Him and to
attempt to keep His commandments. (Hear,
hear.) lam not among the number of those
who believe that the Eternal Father has no
direct access to the spiritual life of His
children even in heathen lands. I am not
among the number who believe that those
who have been born to an inheritance of the
foul traditions of heathenism and have never
heard the Christian Gospel are beyond the
reach of the Spirit of God, and that their
feet cannot be led into the ways of righteous-
ness. " There is a light that lighteth every
man, and this is the condemnation that light
has come into the world and men have loved
darkness rather than light because their
deeds were evil." But among those to whom
the light has come in heathen lands, are there
not some who have loved it and desired to
live in it, and who have passionately desired
that the light should become brighter still,
in order that the mysteries of human life
should be solved, that its burdens may be
lightened, and that the great questions they
ask concerning the future may receive some
answer. I for one hope that there may be
many such. (Hear, hear.) But since we
know by experience that our own heart has
resisted the fuller glory, dare we hope
that the number of those who receive the
fainter light can be very great ? Must not
the heart of God be sorrowful at seeing
millions of those whom Christ died to save,
living and dying and knowing nothing of that
supreme revelation of His grace? You can-
not consider the condition of the millions of
India without having brought home to you
their sore heed of the gospel of Christ; and I
want to remind you that you are entrusted
by the thought and will and grace of God
with this immeasurable glory, with this
dignity transcending all other "dignity that
God can confer on His own children—every-
one of you may have some share, direct or
indirect, large or small, in satisfying the
yearning of God's heart and fulfilling His
intense desire that these children of His
should know of his love as you know of it,
and should be brought under the inspiration
of thoße immortal hopes that have trans-
figured and glorified your life. Missionary
enterprise derives its strength from two
sources. It descends into the abysses of
darkness and sin and woe into which
humanity has sunk ; it ascends to the throne
of God, and finds humanity there in the
person of Jesus Christ. It believes that He
who when He was on earth revealed the
Father is the prophecy of the perfection
possible to every child of man, and that by
the power of the gospel and by the spirit of
God, those who have sunk the lowest may
be lifted to those Divine heights, and share


the perfection and the glory of the Most
High. This is the work in which you are
asked to engage, and if these considerations
do not fill your heart with wonder, with
devout fear lest you should be false to your
trust, with an eager desire to fulfil it, I know
of no other considerations that are likely to
be effectual. (Cheers.)
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27.
CONGREGATIONALISM IN ENGLAND.
ADDRESS BY DR. DALE.
On Tuesday evening, September 27, Dr.
Dale, of Birmingham, delivered an address
in Stow Church on " The History of Congre-
gationalism in England during the Last Fifty
Years." The Rev. W. R. Fletcher presided
over a large audience, and the meeting com-
menced by the choir singing the anthem,
" All ye Nations Praise the Lord."
The CHAIRMAN, in his opening remarks,
said that happily the victory of religious
equality had been won here, but he hoped
that the interests of the Congregationalists of
South Australia in the struggle taking place
in England—which struggle was destined to
be repeated among all the nations of Europe
—would not grow less and less, and that they
would look forward with confidence to the
time when in every land religion would be
set free from State patronage and control.
(Hear, hear.)
Dr. DALE said he was afraid he had been
unfortunate in the selection of a title for the
address, as Mr. Fletcher evidently imagined
that he was going to tell the story of the
struggle which had been going on in England
during the last fifty years for religious equality;
but it had never occurred to him to say
one word about it. The history of English
Congregationalism was one thing and the
history of the struggle for religious equality—
although the Congregational body took part
in it—was another. It had been his good or
evil fortune to have his name rather inti-
mately connected with that great conflict,
but in reality the matter had occupied a very
inconsiderable portion of his time, thought,
or strength. What he proposed to speak
about was " The History of the Internal Life
of the Congregational Churches," for he felt
it might be interesting to them to know
something about the changes which had
taken place in the customs and modes of
worship, in the preaching, theology, and
general life of those associated with the Con-
gregational Churches during the last fifty years.
Let him first refer to the relative strength of
Congregationalism to the population of Eng-
land and Wales in 1837 and in 1887. In the
year when the Queen came to the throne the
estimated population of England was about
14,000,000, in 1887 the estimated population
was 26,000,000. The Congregational Chapels
in England in 1837 numbered 1,850; in
1887 the number was 3,300, so that the
number in proportion to the population
was slightly less at the present moment
than fifty years ago. But the accommodation
provided in these buildings for the purposes
of religious instruction and worship was, he
believed, very much larger now than fifty
years ago. Many of the Church buildings
which in 1837 held 400 or 500 people had been
enlarged and rebuilt and could now accommo-
date 1,000 people or more. Nearly all the new
buildings were considerably larger than those
erected during the first decades of the century.
How much more accommodation was pro-
vided now it was impossible for him to say or
even roughly estimate, for Congregationalists
in England had a most wholesome dread
of central authorities, and if the Secretary
of the Congregational Union sent out circu-
lars inviting a return of the accommodation
which the Church buildings provided, he was
sure that two-thirds of them would go into
the waste-paper basket, and the Noncon-
formist and Independent, and Christian World
would be filled for a few weeks with letters
from indignant country correspondents. (Hear,
hear, and iaughter.) In Wales in 1837 the popu-
lation was about 860,000 and in 1887 about
1,500,000, or not quite double. In 1837 there
were 450 Congregational Chapels in Wales,
and in 1887 there were 999, so that the
number had considerably more than doubled.
(Hear, hear.) Great changes had taken place
in the style of Church buildings. In 1837
there were very few buildings of Gothic
architecture; he doubted whether there
were half a dozen Congregational Churches
which had spires and towers, and he
was not sure that there was one. In
the majority of the new Churches there was
an attempt, not always successful, as he ven-
tured to think, to illustrate the ecclesiastical
style. He ventured to doubt whether the
change had been wholly wise. It was pos-
sible to use the Gothic for any purpose, but
most architects and Building Committees
seemed to think that if they erected a
Gothic building for congregational wor-
ship they must make it as like as pos-
sible to the ancient parish Churches of Eng-
land. Those old Churches were admirable
for the purpose for which they were erected,
but were not suitable for Congregational
Church services. Their services were not
spectacular, nor did they need any long aisles
for religious processions. They wanted a
hall in which every person could see the
minister and the minister could make
every person hear without difficulty.
(Hear, hear.) What their fate had
been with regard to Church architec-
ture in this colony he could not say,
but many Congregational Churches in England
during the last fifty years had been
built more or less beautiful to look
at outside. But then Churches were
intended mainly for the people inside,
and some of them were almost worth-
less for that object. A Congregational
Church was utterly ruined if placed in a
building in which it was hard to preach. A


lofty Gothic roof might be more beautiful
than a flat one, but in nine cases out of ten
the preacher had the best chance in a
building with a flat roof, lie was
thankful that he preached in a building
with a flat roof. It was not architecturally
beautiful, but it answered its purpose better
than if it were stately as the Cathedral of
York or Lincoln. (Hear, hear.) Then, as
to their services. On the whole they had
changed for the better, though all the changes
had neither been very intelligent nor success-
ful. When he began to preach they had
the " usual" service. When he asked
thirty years ago what order of services he
should follow—a question which he did not
ask so often now as he did then, because he
thought a little freedom about the order of
the services was an advantage, and he had
come to think he might take his own way
about it, but when he asked thirty
years ago he was generally told
"the usual order." That usual order
was, first the congregation sang a
hymn, then the Scriptures were read,
then came what was commonly called the
long prayer, then they sang again, then fol-
lowed the sermon, then singing, a short
prayer, and the Benediction. Sometimes a
short prayer was offered at the opening of the
services. A few years later some ministers
began to offer a short prayer before the
sermon, and about the same time the long
prayer, which occupied twenty or twenty-five
minutes, was divided into two. The ser-
mon occupied usually fifty minutes at
least, and in the evening usually longer. The
long prayer being divided into two, with
the short prayer at the commencement, made
three prayers instead of the one, with which
their fathers had been satisfied. In connec-
tion with this change there was an attempt
which deserved most serious, thought-
ful, and devout consideration —to give
a more liturgical character to the service.
He had the impression that that attempt had
on the whole been a disastrous one. They
had more dignity perhaps in the form and
perhaps in the substance of their worship
than they had thirty or forty years ago, but
less of passion. Each kind of public prayer
had its advantages. There were qualities in
a good liturgy which could not be reached in
extemporaneous prayer. There were qualities
in extemporaneous prayer when he who led
the devotions of a devout people was
filled with the Holy Ghost that no
liturgy, however beautiful or stately,
could ever rival. He believed that
the attempt to blend the characteristic
qualities of the two would always be a
failure. Their fathers did not consider the
aesthetic qualities of a prayer. They did not
consider whether it was the kind of compo-
sition that would touch the sentiment of
those who listened. In their best days they
were absorbed in the thought of God's in-
finite grace and power on the one hand, and
the sore need of the people on whose behalf
they were interceding on the other. All
dignity of thought was forgotten in the in-
tensity of passion with which they appealed
to God to have mercy on His people and to
bless them. Now he thought a long prayer
gave a man whose heart was really touched
by the spirit of God much larger freedom
than the shorter prayers which had taken its
place—(Hear, hear)—and although it might
be said that long prayers were sometimes
wearisome he was inclined to think that if a
Christian Church had caught the spirit of
prayer, believed that God was near, and that
in fellowship with Christ it might find access
to Him, the complaints about long prayers
would be likely to disappear; and for his own
part he was inclined to think that during the
next twenty or thirty years they would return
to the practice of their fathers. (Ap-
plause). The most remarkable change in their
worship had been in their psalmody. Some of
them perhaps remembered when they sang
Dr. Watts's psalms and hymns, the hymns
being in three books. In some churches
there was a small collection o
supplementary hymns. Few persons
ever thought what wonderful service Watts
rendered to the Churches of the English-
speaking race. Practically he invented the
hymn. There were a few in the English
language before, but very few indeed. He
doubted whether there were 20 good
hymns before Watts published his
first book. There were psalms, but hymns
were practically invented by Watts,
and he produced such a large number
of excellent hymns that for 150 years the
Congregational Churches on both sides of the
Atlantic were satisfied to sing them only.
That was a wonderful achievement. But
their fathers began to feel that it was wise
to avail themselves more freely of hymns
that devout hearts had been inspired by God
to write in later times. In 1833, immediately
after the formation of the Congregational
Union of England and Wales, the Union
decided to prepare a book that should
be a supplement to Watts. That supple-
ment was issued in 1837. Josiah Conder,
father of his friend I>r. Eustace Conder,
of Leeds, was the responsible editor, and the
collection contained some of his own hymns.
There were 620 hymns in the supple-
ment, of which 120 were for domestic and
private use. Of course there were some
people who resented the interference with
the supremacy of Isaac Watts, and just as
Watts had a hard fight to get his hymns
sung, so fifty years ago the people had a
hard fight to get other hymns sung. They
had perhaps heard of the witticism of a
famous preacher in Watts's days who described
his hymns as " Watts's whims." That
was the general feeling in those days.
Fifteen years later the New Congrega-
tional fiymnbook was issued, including
the hymns of Watts's most in use. That
book was edited by a committee, and he
could imagine no surer method of producing
a bad book than by asking a committee to
edit it. (Laughter.) It was produced at a
time when the religious life of their Churches
was very cold. The " Supplement" was an
attempt to correct some of the defects of
the original book. He was glad that the Con-
gregational Union had recently issued a new
hymn-book, for he believed that the coldness
of what was known as the Congregational
hymn-book, issued thirty years ago, had very


seriously lessened the fire of devotion in some
of their Churches and discouraged some of the
nobler forms of religious life amongst them.
He had no doubt that the new book was
infinitely better than the old one. In
some respects their recent hymnology was
open to criticism. The most popular of their
modern hymns were soft, sighing, sentimental
hymns—hymns about themselves and the
infirmities and imperfections of human life.
Their spiritual music was for the most part
in the minor key. With the exception
of two or three, among whom Mr.
T. H. Grill was conspicuous, modern hymn
writers seemed to know very little of the
triumphant blessedness of restoration to God
through Christ. There was a great want of
noble hymns celebrating the divine greatness
and the divine glory. Passing from the
hymns to the music, there had been a great
change. Fifty years ago there were but
few organs in their Churches at home. In
country Churches they had violins and
flutes and double basses. Congregations
sang with infinitely more fire to string bands
than to an organ; and if they could only get
a good string band to lead their singing
they would have singing of a far more intense
and rejoicing character than was within reach
at present. (Cheers.) But the violins and
double basses and flutes were apt at times to
be a little grotesque, and they were gradually
going out. They had to rely on a dozen
peopleif they had a band, but they had to
deal with only one man if they had an organ ;
and such was the delicate sensitiveness of the
musical temperament that in some cases one
man was quite enough to tax the energies
and to test the sagacity of the authorities
of the Church. (Laughter.) Since 1837
organs had come in. Then fifty years ago
they had a set of tunes that had almost
entirely disappeared. Some of them were
very riotous and some very vulgar. But he
remembered his father used to go about the
house nearly always humming the tune which
he had sung on Sunday. People liked to
sing. They did not find people going about
singing hymns to tunes that Dr. Allon
introduced in the first part of the
Psalmist. Fifty years ago, just as some
thought they should have ecclesiastical
architecture, some thought they should have
ecclesiastical music, and the consequence was
that hymns that set congregations on fire at
that time had to go, and instead came hymns
exceedingly proper, extremely dignified, and
extremely dull. But they had another
change in the last twenty-five years, and he
hoped they would have the fire and brightness
soon without the riot and vulgarity that they
had forsaken. It was only fair to acknow-
ledge that Mr. Wait, Mr. Curwen, and Dr.
Allon had rendered very great service, and the
later parts of Dr. Allon's " Congregational
Psalmist" gave them a different conception of
what Congregational music ought to be
from the part he issued first. Mean-
while anthems had come into use.
When he first had anthems in his Church
some of the people were troubled. What
troubled them was that in the course of the
anthem there was sometimes a tenor, a treble,
a contralto, or bass solo. It seemed incon-
sistent with worship. He had to remind
them that in prayer there was only one voice
heard, and they could worship God following
what was said, and that for his own part he
could not understand why they should not be
able to worship God in an anthem. One of
the best of his people, who greatly resented
the anthem for a time, was converted at last.
She told him how she became converted. He
did not know whether it was complimentary,
but she said, " I have noticed what an effect
the anthem has upon your spirit and
upon your thought in the prayer that
immediately follows it. It reminds me
of the effect of David's harp upon Saul."
(Laughter.) He was quite satisfied, and per-
haps she was nearer the truth than she sup-
posed. Then they had also come to have a
great deal of chanting in their worship—
chanting of Psalms, and chanting of canticles.
About the musical merits of chants he would
not venture to speak, although it seemed to
him that the rhythm of music required
hythmical words, and that it was inartistic
to sing mere prose to any music whatever.
That he would not discuss. He would speak
of a far more important matter. The words
of many of the Psalms and canticles sung in
their congregations seemed to him wholly
out of place. Suppose they had had a
Psalmist during the last fifty years, inspired
as David was, what would he have written ?
He would have written a sorrowful psalm on
the sufferings of our soldiers in the Crimea, a
psalm of triumph on the taking of Sebastopol;
another psalm of sorrow on the Irish famine
of 1845-1846, and a psalm of hope on the
opening of the great Exhibition in 1851;
there would have been a psalm for the
Queen's coronation, one for her marriage,
one for the death of Prince Albert, and
another for her jubilee, and these would have
gone into the Book of Psalms. But they
would think it very absurd for a congrega-
tion a thousand years hence to be singing
even inspired psalms about the sufferings in
the Crimea, the fall of the fortress of Sebas-
topol, the Irish famine, the Exhibition, or the
Queen's Coronation and Jubilee. Many of
the Psalms celebrated similar events in the
life of the Jewish people and their kings, and
yet they went on singing them from day to day.
That seemed to him unreasonable. Many of
the canticles seemed very inappropriate.
How beautiful it was for the mother of their
Lord to sing " My soul doth magnify the
Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God, my
Saviour, for He hath looked upon the low
estate of His handmaiden, for behold from
henceforth all generations shall call me
blessed." But what did those words mean
on their lips? They were not the Lord's
handmaidens; they had not received the
dignity and grace of being the mother of
the Messiah. For old Simeon to sing, " Now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, 0
Lord, according to thy word," was beautiful,
but for a congregation with hundreds of
bright looking young women and robust young
men, who hoped to live thirty or forty
years to sing it, was surely a grotesque
mockery of worship. (Hear, hear.)
They might just as well sing at noon a
hymn written for a midnight service, It was


time that they served God with the under-
standing as well as with the spirit and voice.
(Hear, hear.) The preaching of Congrega
tional ministers in 1887 was in many respects
very different from the preaching of their
predecessors in 1837. Of course, in that com-
parison he had to take the more conspicuous
men as types of the rest, and he supposed
that was a tolerably trustworthy method, tor
the preachers who were accounted great at
any period in the history of the Church had
an immense influence in determining the
general style of their brethren. The address
to the Queen on her accession by what was
called the general body of dissenting
ministers of the three denominations in
London and Westminster was presented at
St. James's on July 21, 1837, by the venerable
John Clayton and his son, George Clayton.
They were representatives of a generation of
Congregational ministers which was even
then disappearing dignified, stately,
courteous gentlemen, taultless in their
dress, faultless in their manners, faultless in
doctrine, faultless in character—devout men,
but net very enthusiastic. They were the
pastors of congregations consisting of prospe-
rous middle-class Christian people, who lived
an easy unheroic life, and who believed that
it was possible to make the best of both
worlds. And those who believed that would,
he ventured to think, make the best of
neither. (Applause.) But the men who
held the foremost places among the Con-
gregational preachers of that time were men
of quite another temper. William Jay was
one of the most popular. He was a man of
shrewd practical genius, who was not afraid
to speak in a simple, frank, and homely style,
which had a charm for all sorts of people. He
(Dr. Dale) did not know how it might be in
Australia, but the younger preachers at home
when before a congregation of cultured
people were apt to use fine words. He
assured them that a half-educated congrega-
tion often liked fine words, but an audience
in which there was real education preferred
simple words. (Hear, hear.) He remem-
bered preaching once at Dr. W. Lindsay
Alexander's Church at Edinburgh, which was
supposed to represent a great deal of intellec-
tual culture. After the service a gentleman
thanked him for his sermon, and added,
"Most of the men who come co speak
to us think we are all M.A.'s, but
we don't want to be reminded of our Univer-
sity standing on Sundays." (Hear, hear.)
William Jay stood alone. He represented no
one but himself. His characteristic manner
was beyond imitation. The representative
men were Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool, John
Angell James, of Birmingham, Dr. Leifchild,
of London, Andrew Reed, of London, who
was even more eminent as a philanthropist
and founder of asylums than as a preacher,
though he was a preacher of very remarkable
power, and Dr. McAll, of Manchester,
who died towards the end of 1837 or early in
1838. Dr. Hamilton and John Ely, of Leeds,
and John Kelly, of Liverpool, were also dis-
tinguished for their efficiency as preachers,
and Hamilton was distinguished for his
scholarship. John Burnet, of Camberwell,
was becoming known for the intellectual
vigour of his sermons, and still more for the
humour and eloquence of his speeches. John
Campbell was at the Tabernacle, but his ex-
traordinary energy was as yet almost unsus-
pected. In 1837 I think that Dr. Vaughan
was at Kensington, where he had a brilliant
congregation. He had not yet achieved the
position he held for many years before his
death as a platform orator without an equal
or a rival in the Congregational ministry.
Among their theological scholars at that time
Pye Smith was the most eminent, but Drs.
Halley, Henderson, Fletcher, Bennett, and
Redford were regarded, and rightly regarded,
with great respect. Thomas Binney was
comparatively young, but he was already re-
cognised as a man of singular originality and
force. Caleb Morris —a less famous name—
was at that time or soon after attracting to
himself in the Cbapel in Fetter-lane large
numbersof themore thoughtful and cultivated
of London Congregationalists. Mr. Binney
and Mr. Caleb Morris were exerting a great
influence over the younger ministers, and
were assisting to change the character of
Congregational preaching. The preaching of
fifty years ago, speaking generally, had more
of rhetorical brilliance in it than was com-
mon in the present time. It was Ciceronian.
The popular preachers liked to sweep along
in a chariot of fire, and the fire blazed out
most gloriously in the peroration. Most of
them had given up perorations during the
last twenty-five years. He did not say that
they ought to do so. (Hear, hear.) In some
sermons there was elaborate decoration, an
almost Asiatic profusion of imagery—though
perhaps that was beginning to disappear—in
England when this colony was founded. But
even then preachers were as careful about
the workmanship as about the metal of their
sermons. They were sculptors, not mere
quarrymen. Usually they did not read their
sermons. Many wrote, and then learned
what they had written; but some of them
had great powers of impetuous, extempo-
raneous, popular eloquence. They excited
their congregations, and when one of the
more famous of them was to prea )h a fecial
sermon away from home the chapel was often
crowded an hour or two before the service.
Of later years it had become general to
attempt to preach what were called
" thoughtful" sermons ; and thoughtful ser-
mons might almost as well be read as spoken.
The sermon had become too much like
an essay, too little like a speech to a
popular audience. The appeal to emotion
was less frequent, or if there was any appeal at
all it was to the softer and quieter kind of
emotion. People did not crowd into a Church
an hour or two before the service began to
listen to preaching of that kind. (Hear,
hear.) The best preaching among them
was interesting, instructive, and devout
rather than impassioned. Preaching of the
popular kind had, he thought, more of
humour in it than it had fifty years ago. Con-
gregations were not afraid to laugh, and there
were, he supposed, some preachers who were
not careful to avoid saying things that raised
a laugh. Fifty years ago a laugh in a sermon
would_ have been regarded by Congrega-
tionalists as quite indecorous, inconsistent


with the seriousness, or at least with the pro-
prieties, of a religious service. In that respect
they had gone back to the methods of a still
earlier time. When George 111. was King
there were many witty and humorous
preachers in the pulpit, preachers of whom
Matthew Wilks and Rowland Hill were
conspicuous examples. They owed it, he
imagined, to Mr. Spurgeon, who when
he was younger somstimes said very
keen and amusing things in his ser-
mons, and did so now at times, that
the older style had revived. It was not
inconsistent with the intensest earnestness,
but it was not without its dangers, and a
man ought to be intensely in earnest for it to
be safe for him to be humourous in a sermon.
(Hear, hear.) Passing from the mere intel-
lectual and emotional elements of preaching
to the substance of it, he thought it must be
acknowledged that there had been during
the last fifty years a very consider-
able change. There had been a general
break up in the religious traditions of
England, and Congregational Churches had
been largely influenced by the currents of
contemporary life and thought. They had
been passing out of an old order into a new,
and what the new order would be they
were not quite certain. The change was far
less deep and central than was sometimes
imagined, but for the time there was great
confusion, and a few years ago there was great
alarm. The alarm had very much subsided,
but the confusion still remained. Fifty years
ago the Calvinistic theology still seemed to
retain something of its ancient stability and
solemn grandeur. The Evangelical clergy in
the English Church were for the most part
Calvinistic, and though the best times
of the Evangelicals were already over,
the Evangelical clergy and the Evan-
gelical laity were still, in religious
fervour and energy, the most powerful party
in the English Church. Among the free
Evangelical Churches of England, with the
exception, of course, of the Methodists, who
always abhored Calvinism, the Calvinistic
form of faith was still generally acknow-
ledged. In the Congregational Churches,
however, there were already signs that it had
begun to decay. The Calvinism of the De-
claration of laith and Order adopted by the
Congregational Union at its first meeting in
1834 was Calvinism of an exceedingly mild
type. Its mildness created great dissatisfac-
tion among the most robust theologians of
the older sort. Richard Winter Hamilton,
of Leeds, condemned the declaration strongly,
and other men thought they saw in it
ominous indications that Congregationalisms
were drifting away from the faith of their
fathers. It was drawn up by Dr. Redford,
of Worcester, in consultation with Mr.
James; and Mr. James, though as a student
he had been trained in Calvinism, was
touched in his early religious life by Methodist
influences, and subsequently he followed
with great interest the Calvinistic con-
troversy in America between the two
parties known as the old and the
new school Presbyterians, which led
to the temporary division of the
Presbyterian Church in America, and
his sympathies were wholly with the new
school. He used some of the technical
phrases of Calvinism to the last, but he had
put new wine into the old bottles, and the
wonder was that the bottles did not burst.
Mr. James was rather a conspicuous illustra-
tion of the general change that was passing
in their theological thought. Large numbers
of the men of his generation were silently—
some of them unconsciously—surrendering
everything in Calvinism that was worth
keeping, but they could not throw
off the old language. The men that came
after them gave up the language of Cal-
vinism as well as its creed, and some of them
fiercely assailed its more characteristic doc-
trines. Here and there Calvinism real
Calvinism still remained, but speaking
generally and broadly its living force had
gone. They had lost something, they had
lost much in losing it. It the days of its
strength it filled men with the most
august sense of the infinite great-
ness of God; and the true root of the
greatness of man lay in the divine greatness.
The devout Calvinist had a God whom he
could worship—for whom he had a reverential
fear, before whose infinite majesty he was
sometimes obliged to lie prostrate in silent,
awful wonder. He had a God whose
eternal decrees gave transcendent dignity
and absolute security to his personal
life; and a God whose free, spon-
taneous grace inspired him with
passionate love and devotion. Since parting
with Calvinism many had come to have a
mere good-natured God. He did not think,
however, that in the case of the men of that
generation—the leaders of the Free Evan-
gelical Churches in 1837—the loss of Cal-
vinism had any serious effect on the religious
life. Their real theology, the theology on
which they lived, was the theology
of the revival. Its great articles
were the sinfulness of man, his peril
if he did not repent, the death of Christ
for the sins of the world, justification by
faith, and the necessity of the new birth.
These they kept, and in graduallv parting
with their traditional Calvinism they were
conscious of no loss. But they discovered,
and discovered with alarm, that the
younger men seemed to be passing through
a still more serious change. In
1814 there appeared a series of
articles in the Congregational Magazine
in which this alarm was expressed. The
articles were on Academical Theology, the
Theology of the Study, and the Theology of
the Pulpit. The students at one of the
Congregational Colleges—grave, grey-headed
men now—were very angry. They passed
resolutions denouncing the magazine, and
banishing it from the College table. One of
the resolutions pledged the students to
recommend their friends in the Churches
to give up subscribing for it. Of course
the editor inserted these resolutions in his
next number, and called upon his supporters
to stand by him in what he regarded as a
grave duty to the truth and to the Con-
gregational Churches of the country, and this
brought him letters from different parts of
the kingdom, encouraging him to be firm, and


declaring that his charges were well founded.
The students and the younger ministers
thought that they were suffering cruel in-
justice, but on looking back he was inclined
to think that the older men were so
far in the right—that about that time a very
real and substantial change was showing in
the new generation of ministers. It was not
a question of holding fast to Calvinism; it
was a question of holding faßt to the theology
and to the traditions of the evangelistical
revival. The younger men might have said,
" We do not reject the doctrine of human
sinfulness, or human peril, or the atone-
ment, or justification by faith, or the new
birthbut the older men, could they
have seen clearly how the matter stood,
might have replied, " Perhaps not, but these
truths do not hold the same place in your
faith that they hold in ours. You hold them,
but they inspire you with no passion, no
wonder ; you haven't that vision of the glory
of Christ's redemption which fills our hearts
with joy. The articles of our faith may be
found in yours, but with you they have
their place among a crowd of other
beliefs, instead of being sceptred, crowned,
enthroned, and ruling all your thoughts."
To this charge it would have been difficult
for the younger men to make any successful
reply. And the older men might have gone
on to say, " We have cared supremely about
converting and saving men; there are some
theological doctrines about which we have
been doubtful, some which we have
modified, but about the central truths
of our faith we have never had
any doubt, and our great concern
has been so to preach these absolutely certain
things as to fill men with sorrow for sin and
to prevail upon them to trust in the Lord
Jesus Christ for eternal redemption. You
seem to care more about resolving difficult
questions of criticism and theology and about
finding satisfactory definitions of doctrine
than about saving human souls. Our
chief concern has been with men; your
chief concern is with truth.'' In other words,
they might have told their younger brethren
that they were breaking with the traditions
of the revival. And it soon became appa-
rent that while the younger Congregational
ministry believed that they held fast by the
substance of the evangelical faith, the intel-
lectual conception and expression of Christian
doctrine which had satisfied the evangelical
Churches was regarded by them as inade
quate; and for forty years there had
been going on a gradual process of
change in their theological position, nor had
they even now formed a clear, firm, and
coherent theory of their faith. They would
find it hard to draw up a Confession of Faith
or a catechism. Yes; the most important
change that had passed upon Congregational
preaching during the last half-century was
the result of the gradual disappearance
of the traditions of the great evan-
gelical revival. The leading preachers
among them fifty years ago were children
of the revival. Some of the influential
ministers of that time were indeed the repre-
sentatives of the elder Nonconformity, but
he most popular men—men like James
Parsons, Angell James, and Leifchild—were
penetrated through and through with the
spirit of that great movement which changed
the religious condition of England in the last
century. They had a profound conviction
that men were in danger of an
awful doom if they did not trust
in the mercy of Christ, receive pardon
of sin, and the new life given in regeneration.
They made a strenuous endeavour to convert
men. In their sermons there was direct,
vehement appeal. They appealed to fear as
well as to the conscience and to the kindlier
affections of the human heart. Their theory
was rarely to preach a sermon that might
not have something in it to touch the
hearts of sinful men and to lead
them to faith in Christ. Gradually this
passionate assault on the unconverted
lost its fire, and preaching during the last
fifty years had become more instructive and
less evangelistic. It was thought that the
constant reiteration of evangelical truths
when preaching to congregations largely
composed of Christian men and women was
unnecessary. Again and again there had
been attempts made to renew the fervour
and methods of the evangelical revival, but,
as a rule, they had been of a spasmodic
character. Here and there hearts had been
filled with the love of God, and men had
broken with sin as a result of those efforts ;
but, speaking broadly, the attempt to renew
and to repeat the evangelical revival of the
last century had not succeeded. It could
not in the nature of things be repeated. God
never repeated Himself. That was wonder-
fully illustrated in the religious movements
recorded in the Scriptures, as well as in
Lutheranism, Puritanism, and the movement
in which Whitfield and Wesley played such
a prominent part. Those who desired to see
the whole life of the Church rise to clearer,
loftier, and more blessed heights—those who
desired to see the Christian Gospel exerting
some of its old imperial power—must not
suppose that those results were to be achieved
by imitating what was done by Whit-
field and Wesley a hundred years ago.
They must appeal to the living God and ask
Him to teach them the way in which His
work was to be done now. He had the
warmest sympathy with those who sought to
get the revival of the last century re-
peated ; but they should entreat God
to teach them what was best. Men did not
require a new gospel, but they required the
old gospel to be preached by living men to
their contemporaries in their own speech,
so as to touch the dangers and the sorrows
by which they were environed. (Hear, hear.)
He might further say in regard to the life of
Congregationalists in England that there had
been a departure from some of the traditions
which controlled and governed the personal
life of their fathers in the last century. The
Independents a hundred years ago bad a very
definite character of their own, almost as
definite as that which was illustrated in
these days by the Society of Friends; but
there came upon them the new traditions
created by the evangelical revival, and those
were the traditions which ruled devout Con-
gregationalists when this colony was founded.


They lived a much simpler life than they
lived now. The middle classes now were
much richer in England than they were fifty
years ago; they gave larger entertainments,
and mixed much more freely than they used
to do with those who did not hold the
Christian faith. Their conceptions of the
Christian life had considerably altered; many
of them danced, many went to theatres,
and he supposed all read novels. Fifty years
ago a novel was regarded with the gravest
suspicion. That tradition was justified by
the general character of the novels of the
eighteenth century, and people fifty years
ago did not properly understand the
great change which Scott had wrought
in that field of literature. It seemed
to him that the Victorian era would win as
splendid a place in English literature by its
writers of fiction as the Elizabethan era
had won by its dramatists. (Hear, hear.)
But when he considered the time devoted to
novels that were utterly worthless he almost
regretted that the old Congregational rigidity
in respect of such works had passed
away. (Hear, hear.) It might be doubtful
whether family prayer was as universal in
Congregational families as it was fifty years
ago, and speaking briefly it appeared to him
that they wanted to recover a conception of
a method of life. Everv method of life
must gradually decay and be reconstructed
with the changes in the civilization and
social condition of a people, but unless a
Christian Church had an ideal method of life
which should exert a certain authority over
its members most Christian people were apt
to go astray. Christ governed men by prin-
ciples, but it was necessary that they should
take a concrete form. He trusted that as
God renewed the spiritual energy of Con-
gregationalists, as he believed he was doing
in England, that they would come to a
clearer intellectual conception of how the
great laws which Christ had given for
the guidance of His Church were to be
better expressed in practical life. (Loud
applause.)
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28.
FAREWELL TO ENGLISH DELEGATES.
A crowded public meeting was held in the
North Adelaide Congregational Church on
Wednesday evening. September 28, to bid
farewell to Dr. R. W. Dale and Mr. Albert
Spicer, the delegates from the Congregational
Union of England and Wales to the Inter-
colonial Conference held to celebrate the
jubilee of Congregationalism in South Aus-
tralia. The meeting was preceded by a tea
in the lecture hall, which attracted a large
gathering. A spacious temporary platform
had been erected in the Church for the
accommodation of speakers and the repren-
sentatives of various religious bodies. The
Rev. F. W. Cox presided.
The CHAIRMAN said Changes in life!
we continue not in one stay. First the
welcome, and the sounds scarcely die
away but the farewell comes. For a long
time we South Australians looked forward to
our Conference with mingled feelings of in-
terest and anxiety. One portion of our Jubilee
we anticipated without alloy—the coming
of Dr. Dale and Mr. Spicer. They came,
increasing our pleasure by the presence of
those whom they brought with them, and to
whom for their own sakes and for the sake
of those who brought them, we have been
delighted to show what hospitality lay in
our power. They came; they have spoken
to us in our meetings in town; they have
served in our pulpits; they have visited some
portions of our colony in the agricultural,
pastoral, and mining districts. I need not
say with what power they have spoken, with
what words of weighty wisdom they have
instructed us, or with what gracious sweet-
ness thejr have cheered our souls in bringing
the privileges and blessings and responsi-
bilities of Christian life under our notice
with fresh force. We recognise God's hand
iD what they have been to us, and we thank
the Giver of every good gift for what we
have received at their hands. But we cannot
forget the honoured servants who have been
the instruments by which this grace has come
to us. We welcomed them when they came,
and now we have to bid them farewell—a
long farewell; for most of us will never see
them again, perhaps, till we meet in the
Father's house where there are many man-
sions. We meet to-night to commend them
to God and to the Word of His Grace as
well as to say good-bye to them. We can
only hope that the experience they may have
of their visit to the Antipodes will be so
happy as to stir up others in the old country
to follow their steps and be angels of the
Churches and ministers of grace to us. They
will go back with enlarged knowledge of the
British Empire in its most distant and most
prosperous dependencies, for they will know
them by the seeing of the eye and not merely
by report of what others have seen. We
hope that knowledge will not be disappointing
to them, as to the Bocial or material or
spiritual aspects of life in these new
lands, where the streams of the old
national life have to flow in fresh
channels and with surroundings oftentimes
entirely new. The conditions of life are to
so large an extent changed, for we have
next to no past. Everything is new and
even raw. We have the making of history
for ourselves. We are therefore rather eager
and anticipative than retrospective. It is
one of our dangers to have broken with the
past and to be forgetful of its lessons. Still
we are hopeful and with God's blessing upon
us we take courage for the future. We speak
thus because we value the visit of our friends
and we shall be glad to see them among us
again in, say seven years. Our hope is that
they and others like them may come among


us and speak words of wisdom to help us in
these new southern lands.
The Rev. J. C. MCMICHAEL, Secretary of
the South Australian Jubilee Fund Executive,
then read and presented the following
address to Dr. Dale and Mr. Albert Spicer:—
To THE ESTEEMED BRETHREN IN CHRIST,
DR. R, W. DALE AND MR. ALBERT
SPICER.
Dear brethren. —We have been for some
year or two past anticipating your presence
among us in South Australia with feelings of
the liveliest pleasure. We have thought of
you not only as visitors from the dear mother
country, but as brethren occupying—
deservingly occupying—prominent positions
in the Church, one as a minister of Christ's
holy gospel, placed by the head of the Church
over an important congregation in a very
active and intelligent community, at the
same time, as a theologian, contributing
largely to the deeper thoughts of the age in
matters relating to God and to his Christ.
Also as an important factor in the educational,
social, and political activities in the stirring
times in which we live. The other, as one
whom for want of a better word, we call a
layman, prominent also in every movement
for the advancement of our common country
on the lines of true progress, leading the
young and old from sin to holiness, from the
world to God. You have come among us and
spoken words which the Holy Spirit of God
has given jou to speak to us. We can say
without fear of contradiction that your
words have been as ''good news from a far
country," which have been to us as cold
water to our thirsty souls. Words are feeble
to express our sense of what your presence
and teaching have, under God, been to the
large numbers of all sections of God's people
who have been drawn together to listen to
your utterances; now entering into the
depths of divine thoughts that underlie our
ordinary conceptions, and now charming and
cheering us with the sweetness and gracious-
ness of loving wisdom caught from the very
mind of Christ. You have left impressions
on many minds that can never be effaced.
We do not hesitate to say that the influence of
your visit to these southern lands has been
enhanced by the presence of those so dear to
you who "have favoured us with their
company, and who must have made your
absence from home less anxious than it would
otherwise have been. Now you are about to
leave us for the other Australian colonies
our prayer is that you may everywhere meet
with open hearts and hospitable homes
among the Christian brotherhood in those
lands. That by the good hand of God our
Father you may have a blessing upon the
Churches everywhere, and that in all your
journeyings in Australasia, and when you
have to make the longer v oyage back to
England, the Lord will have you. Dr. Dale,
Mrs. Dale, and Miss Dale, and Mr. and Mrs.
Spicer, in His mighty and loving keeping.
Giving you all a hearty farewell we wish you
God speed. Signed on behalf of the S.A.
Congregational Jubilee Committee,
WM. ROBY FLETCHER, M.A., Chairman.
J. C. MCMICHAEL, Secretary.
Adelaide, September 28, 1887.
The CHIEF JUSTICE said it appeared to him
to have been a singularly happy arrangement,
having regard to Congregational principles
and to the history of Independency in these
colonies, that one of the representatives of
the Congregationsl Churches in England and
Wales to the Churches of South Australia
should be a layman ; and he thought every
one must agree that the choice was a happy
one when it fell on a Nonconformist who was
loyal to the Church of his fathers, and one
whose carriage had not carried him past the
Chapel or the meeting-house to a Church with
a more aesthetic worship or with greater
social prestige. (Cheers.) Coming to Dr.
Dale, he was sure they would all agree with
that he was the most distinguished minister
of religion who had visited South Australia
since the visit of the Rev. Thomas Binney.
(Hear, hear.) When he said that he did
not forget that they had had a visit from the
Bishop of Manchester. Dr. Moorhouse was
certainly the most eloquent platform speaker
to whom he had listened in Australia or
anywhere with the exception of John Bright;
but, after ail, his position as a theologian
was not comparable to that of Dr. Dale, and
in addition the platform which he had
spoken from in Australia was a provincial
and colonial one, while Dr. Dale addressed
two hemispheres. (Cheers.) Dr. Dale's
public utterances in South Australia had
been quite worthy of his high reputation,
whether they began with that noble dis-
course in which he justified the ways of God
to man, or to that admirable sketch of Con-
gregational history which he gave on the
previous evening, and which induced them
to hope that he would direct his great
powers to the writing of a worthy history of
religious thought during the last fifty or 100
years. (Cheers).
The Revs. Dr. PATON, W. R. FLETCHER,
ADD S. HEBDITCH also spoke.
Mr. SPICER said—l confess that I agree
very cordially with the Chairman in the ex-
pression that it is difficult to remember that
it is now nearly a month ago since you gave
us the first welcome at the Adelaide Railway
Station, followed by that wonderful welcome
in the Town Hall a few days afterwards, and
that we have now come to bid farewell to one
another. You, Sir, have referred to the
mingled feelings with which you have antici-
pated these meetings. I can assure you for
my part that our feelings were very mingled
also. 1 often wondered while on the voyage
out why it was 1 had accepted the invitation
that Mr. Searle had brought to me in your
name. But when I accepted it I did so
because I believed it was more than an
invitation, that it was a call, and looking
at the long connection which I had had
through my honoured father with the
colonies, looking at the fact that those
connected with me in business were willing
to do my work during my absence, it seemed
to me that the hand of Providence pointed in
the direction of Australia, and to Australia I
came, and I certainly speak with very
mingled feelings to-night. On the one side
I will not hesitate to say that 1 am some-
what glad that my speaking in South
Australia is over. I think if you work


all your laymen as hard as you worked
me during the last week, and give them
preaching to do as you have me, they
would feel as I do now. (Applause.) But
there is a sad side to it in the fact that we
are now compelled to look forward to leaving
our many friends. Speaking for my wife as
well as for myself I am sure we shall never
forget the kindness we have received from
every one while we have been in your city.
The work, 1 freely admit, has been hard,
not so much on account of the meet-
ings or even of the preparation for
the meetings, as on account of the
kindness shown by everybody making
it necessary almost for us to have three or
four more hours in a day to enable us to get
through our engagements, and I am sure you
will forgive me if I say that whilst I cannot
mention all the names of those who have
treated us so well I rejoice exceedingly that
on this platform is one who has been to us
the very dearest friend throughout
this visit. I refer to His Honor the
Chief Justice. (Cheers.) We came into
his house by his invitation as strangers from
the old country, but so unvarying has been
his kindness from that moment until now
that the other day when I sent a message to
him that we were coming back from Port
Pirie, I felt that the only words I could say
were, "We are coming home." (Cheers.)
We are not accustomed to use such words
as these unless our feeling goes with the
words. (Hear, hear.) I thank him very
heartily, both on my own behalf and in
the name of my wife and those we
represent. I fully realized, however, that in
receiving the welcome I have received at
your hands and in receiving the kindness
you have shown to us I ought not to accept
this as the treatment of an individual. I
accept it because I have the honour and the
privilege to represent thousands of laymen
in England and of being a delegate from
the Congregational Union of England and
Wales, and beyond that because I have
the good fortune to hold a name that
has been known now for some generations in
connection with I trust all that is best in
Congregational Church life. (Cheers.) I do not
hesitate to say this visit will tend to draw
closer the ties which bind this country with
the old mother country. It is perfectly true,
not only in Birmingham, but in different
parts of England, that many are reading news
from Australia who in the ordinary way
are not accustomed to read such intelligence.
A new interest is created with members
of families and members of the Churches by
means of these visits, and I know, speaking
for my own Church, that Australia—although
I am glad to say it has already many ties
which bind our Church to this and the other
colonies—will have a new interest in the
hearts of those people because of all we shall
be able to tell them of your work and of your
love. Some one has hinted that at any
rate Dr. Dale and I were not jealous of
one another as a deputation. (Cheers
and laughter.) Certainly I know my good
friend Dr. Dale has no need to be jealous of
me, for 1 have equally with yourselves ap-
preciated the privilege of hearing him speak.
I do not often have that privilege in Eng-
land, and it has been one of the joys of my
voyage out that 1 have been with him day
by day, and have listened to his words, and
I trust that we may all be better for what
we have heard from his lips and for the
example which he sets us. It has been
my misfortune several times owing to his
kindness during this visit to stand between
the meeting and Dr. Dale, and I have tried
to use that privilege with discretion, and I
intend to do so again to-night. I thank you
again for the kindness you have shown to us,
and I pray that all that has been said may
receive divine blessing. (Cheers.) I have
tried—T can say it before God—to be simply
myself, 1 have tried to speak out the
experience of my own heart and
life, and I can desire nothing greater
or grander for those who with me are
growing up and will have to take year by
year a greater share of responsibility not only
of home life, not only of commercial life and
of the public life of this country, when I say
that I trust the result of these meetings will
be that we shall all appreciate that we have
a higher calling, that God has called us to a
noble position, that He has entrusted each
one of us with a service for Him, and that as
we exert ourselves in His name, He will
enable us to be blessings to those with
whom we come in contact and blessings to
the country in which we live. (Cheers.)
Dr. DALE, received with cheers, said—l am
sometimes in the habit when I am at home
of saying that with many great and noble
qualities we of the English race are con-
spicuous for one great defect. We are afraid
to tell other people how much affection, and
how much esteem, and how much respect
we cherish for them. I sometimes quote a
phrase which I found somewhere a great many
years ago—" Love me and tell me so," and I am
inclined to think that on the other side of the
world English people need to be reminded of
the duty of letting those whom they love know
of their affection. Whether it is owing to
the sunnier skies under which you are said to
live—(laughter)—or to some other cause I am
unable to determine ; but, at any rate, you
seem in parting from the mother country to
have escaped from that hereditary imper-
fection of our race. (Cheers.) Whilst
listening to the very generous words of the
address, which 1 gratefully acknowledge, and
to the extremely kind speeches which have
been delivered since the address was handed
to me, I have been reminded of something
that happened to me a great many years ago,
and which 1 have often recalled since. When
1 was a very young man—not quite 20 and
still a student—l was asked by Mr. J.
A. James, whose colleague 1 subsequently
became, and whose successor I now am, to
preach for him on one Sunday morning. I
am bound to say I think he asked me by
mistake. (Laughter.) I was not then in the
" preaching class," and as my friends on the
platform who have been at_ our English
Colleges know, the impression in England is
that until a student has been in the preaching
class it cannot be expected that he should be
able to preach. However, I preached. It was on
the first Sunday of the month, and Mr.


James delivered an address at the Lord's
Supper afterwards, in which he referred very
generously to the sermon he had just listened
to. One of the founders of Springhill College
was still living—an old lady of great sagacity
and kindness—to whom I liked to listen when
she told me about the experience of her early
life during the latter part of last
century. 1 had a message from her on the
Monday morning that she wanted to speak to
me. I called, and for half an hour she said
nothing of exceptional importance, but as 1
rose to go she said " Oh, my dear, I hear that
Mr. James said some kindly things about
your sermon in his address at the
Lord's Supper. Well, you must not
mind; it is only his way." (Laughter.) The
tone of profound sympathy in which she
expressed herself touched my heart, and
when 1 used to listen to him afterwards
speaking of me as he was apt to speak in his
generous manner, I often thought of her,
and while I have been listening to
the words of excessive generosity which
have fallen from the lips of my friends
to-night I have thought of her again.
(Cheers and laughter.) I am very grateful to
you for all their kindness, and I should like
to take this opportunity of expressing my
sense of obligation to many who are not here
to-night who have shown to Mrs. Dale and
to my daughter and to myself very great
courtesy and very great kindness since
we came to your beautiful city.
It is rather dangerous, amid such
a crowd of friends, specially to
refer to any, but I should like to acknow-
ledge the courtesy we have received from His
Excellency the Governor —(cheers) —from the
Bishop of Adelaide—(cheers)—from the Mayor
of Adelaide, and other distinguished citizens ;
from Sir Samuel Davenport, and from Mr. J.
H. Angas, to whom principally we owe
a most interesting journey up country, and
from whom I received, whilst sitting
at his side on the box of the coach,
a most interesting and charming account
of the early days of this colony and the
services which his father had rendered to it.
(Cheers.) Hon. Alexander Hay and other
gentlemen have also shown us great considera-
tion. But, Sir, I must be allowed, even after
what my friend Mr. Spicer has said concern-
ing His Honor the Chief Justice, specially
to refer to the unexampled and unmeasured
kindness which he has been_ showing us
since we have been here. He is endowed—
as I have discovered with many and
varied accomplishments, but I venture to say
that one of his most conspicuous qualities is
a positive genius for hospitality (Cheers.)
At his table we have been permitted to meet
many of the most distinguished men in your
public and political life. I must confess
that I am a little uncertain about the results
of the extremely pleasant conversations that
I have had with those gentlemen. I knew
something about Australia when I landed at
Hobart about five weeks ago, but as the
result of listening to them—well, to-night
I feel that I have no opinions at all.
(Laughter.) I shall have to wait for a
few weeks for all that I have heard
to settle down and take form. At present
my thought is in a very chaotic condition
about many of the most important questions
about this colony in which I am interested.
How long the process of evolution will take
before chaos will pass into cosmos I am not
prepared to predict. (Cheers.) I should like
also to refer to the very great kindness
that we have received from Mr. and Mrs.
Fletcher. I esteem it to be one
of the most felicitous circumstances con-
nected with my visit here that I have come
to know Mr. Fletcher, of whom of course I
have heard for many years past, but whom I
have not had the pleasure of meeting since
that time when I inspired him with so much
awe. (Cheers and laughter.) And I see
one gentleman in this audience to-night to
whom I must be allowed to refer, who is
mainly responsible for my being here at all.
I cannot express my serise of obligation to
Mr. Searle for the unwearied —I will say for
the affectionate —kinkness that he has been
showing to us ever since we came to Ade-
laide, and for the incessant anxiety he has
shown to make our visit to this colony
agreeable to us. (Cheers.) Well, you
have been good enough to say in the
address that has been submitted to us
that you are grateful for our visff. Let me
speak frankly and say that I think here
and there I have discovered some indication
of disappointment. There has been on the
part of many—not a few at least of those
with whom I have spoken—an extreme
anxiety that I should express some opinion
in public concerning questions by which the
public life of this colony is agitated. It
seems to be the impression here that
I spend most of my time in England
in conducting an assault on one of the
most venerable institutions of the country.
It is true that I feel it my duty to take part
in the great agitation for the disestablishment
and disendowment of the Anglican Church.
(Cheers.) I have joined in that agitation
under a grave sense of religious duty, but,
as 1 have ventured to say before, it is
altogether a misapprehension to suppose that
my chief strength and my chief time
are devoted to that agitation. I also engage
in many educational controversies, and, what
affords me much greater pleasure to look
back upon, in the administration of great
educational institutions; and perhaps it is
not unnatural that some of those
who know a little of my public life in
England should expect me to discuss
economical and political and educational
questions here. Well, I have avoided them
all, and I intend to avoid them, for many
reasons. (Hear, hear.) You know a great
deal more about England, no doubt, than I
knew when I came here about South Aus-
tralia, but, with the utmost respect for the
men who stand in the very forefront of the
public life of this colony, I venture to say
that if they came to discuss with us in
England questions on which the public
mind there is divided, we Bhould
be certain to find in what they said
many indications that they were not familiar
with the forms the controversies have
assumed at home. Not until I had been in
South Australia many months should I be in


a position to discuss seriously the topics
which are dividing the politicians and public
men in this colony. I have a great dread of
talking about things I know nothing about,
and therefore, so far as your public contro-
versies are concerned, I came to learn what
I could rather than to teach. And I may say
further that while to me questions relating
to the development of a free and rich and
noble municipal life, questions relating to
the development of a great and comprehen-
sive system of public education, and questions
relating to general national politics have the
very keenest interest to me at home, there
are other questions which there as here
transcend them infinitely in interest and im-
portance ; and it seemed to me there-
fore that for a few months I might throw off
the yoke and choose my own part—that I
was under no obligation here to touch the
exciting and troubled questions that I am
under an obligation to touch at home, and
that I was free to speak to you on those
matters about which I care most, and about
which I was sure I should be able to speak
under a strange sky most wisely and most
effectually. (Cheers.) Differences grave and
serious contrast your public life with ours.
The same questions assume different forms
at home and here, and although there
are great central truths which I
think should determine the solution
of these questions everywhere, I am old
enough in public life to feel this, that men
who discuss great questions in the air with-
out touching facts are not likely to speak
with great advantage to those who listen to
them. (Hear, hear.) But so far as those
great truths and obligations and hopes are
concerned of which I have spoken,
those are the same in every clime;
those are the same among people of
every race, and 1 was sure that speaking in
the name of Christ concerning those things
which I trusted Christ had taught me to
those who also had sat at His feet, you would
recognise for yourselves our common kinship
to Him. What I had learned you had been
learning, and if I had been taught anything
that you had only imperfectly discovered, I was
sure that under the illumination of the Spirit
you would rejoice to listen to me, as I in my
turn should rejoice to learn from you what
you had learnt but what had before been
but imperfectly known to me. (Hear,
hear.) Now, at this closing meeting there
are a few things which I should like
to speak about, but I limit myself to one
or two. I should like to speak to
those associated with the Congregational
Churches in this colony concerning a subject
discussed at the recent Conference. I
hear a great deal in this colony from Congre-
gational ministers and others about Congre-
gational Church life in the absence of ecclesias-
tical conflict, and sometimes there has
been a faint suggestion that it is
rather a disadvantage to Congregational
Churches to be exempted from ecclesias-
tical conflict. Let me say that you
ought to thank God from your very hearts
that you have not to carry these con-
flicts on. (Hear, hear.) You are not fight-
ing for freedom—freedom is won, and you
have to use it. In the old country our whole
ecclesiastical life is influenced more or less
injuriously by conflicts forced upon us by our
position. I need only refer to the political
aspect of the controversy maintained by the
free Churches, which sometimes appears to
lead people to forget that we are not
struggling for political ends, but are
struggling for the assertion of the Congrega-
tional Churches that to the Lord Jesus alone
are we responsible, and to Him alone should
we look for the development of Church life
and for the direction of our ecclesiastical
action. Now, you are in no danger
of being absorbed by the political interests of
the struggle in which the free Churches of
England are engaged. You are left free to
develop in your Churches that reverence for
the supreme authority of Christ which con-
stitutes the life and strength and glory of the
Churches who heartily recognise it. We in
England are living under great disadvantages
of another kind. We have had to protest, we
have been forced to protest, through generation
after generation, against what we regard as
certain false conceptions of the power and
functions of the Christian sacraments which
are found in the offices of the Anglican
Church, which is the established Church at
home. The result of that has been, as I think,
to drive us into a position which it is
extremely difficult to maintain and to
justify in relation to the sacraments.
In our intense anxiety to escape
from what we believed to be a
false attribution of power to the sacra-
ments of the Church, we have been led, as I
believe, to empty them largely of their true
meaning and force. We have departed very
far from the position in relation to the sacra-
ments that was held by the founders of
Independency 300 years ago, and by the great
theologians who gave glory to the name of In-
dependency under the Commonwealth, and I
am not sure whether many of our Churches
will not continue to retain their false posi-
tion until the controversy with the Anglican
Church as an establishment is over. When
any Church is driven to oppose a great error
in another Church it is only too likely to
forget the truth that underlies that error
and to exaggerate its protest against
the evil. (Hear, hear.) One thing I
venture to say with profound respect to
my Christian brethren of all Churches who
are present in this audience. I suppose you
are in danger, all of you, in consequence of
the exceptional conditions of your Church
life, of underestimating the importance of de-
veloping the intellectual and theological life of
your Church. There is a tendency at home to
depreciate the importance of theology. I don't
identify theology with religion. All human
creeds ar6 but faint and imperfect attempts
to express divine mysteries, but the intellect
has its rights in religion as well as in every
other province of man's activity, and it is an
insult to the human intellect to throw scorn
on theology and to imply that the intellect
cannot express in definite form some of the
divine truths which have been revealed in
Christ. (Hear, hear.) I don't believe that
any Christian Church will ever exert
its true authority over the thought of


its time unless its intellectual life is active as
well as its ethical and spiritual life. There
has been a strange disposition to depreciate
the functions of the intellect in relation to
religious truth. But look back to the best
times of our own Churches —look back to the
best times of the Presbyterian Churches, and
you will discover that in those days men were
not merely inspired with a great passion for
the glory of God, for the salvation of mankind,
but that they felt that the noblest and most
glorious function of the intellect of man was
to explore those provinces of divine truth
which may be discovered if only we
listen to the teaching of the Holy
Ghost, and dwell on the revelation which
God has made of Himself in Christ. There
is a certain intellectual indolence, I believe,
creeping over the Church of our times that
makes it indisposed to pursue those great
and heroic intellectual ventures, and until
Christians discover that great theologians
have their place in the Church as well as
great preachers, I believe the best
days of the Christian Church will
never be restored. (Hear, hear.) I ask
those of you who have influence and
authority among the Churches of these
colonies to resolve not to be content with
merely popular religious thought. Cultivate
to the utmost of your possibilities theological
science in the interest of the higher life of the
Church. (Cheers.) Well, we are here to say
farewell. You, Sir, have said that in the
blessed life we hope for, farewells will be
known no longer. But I feel that to those of
us who are heirs of immortality, who abide
in Christ, and in whom Christ abides, that
there are no real farewells on earth. I am
reminded of a passage which occurs, I think,
in one of the books of my old tutor Henry
Rogers. I can imagine that even in the perfect
life above, some of us may desire to venture
out into regions of God's great universe that
others may not care to explore—to do so with
the happy and certain hope of meeting those
whom we have left behind, not only in the
fulness of the life which they possessed when
we parted from them, but with that life richer
and more robust, with new splendour on
their brow, and new and richer joy in their
hearts, to be sure of finding those from whom
for a little time we had parted not only
standing fast in their loyalty to God,
living in the light of His presence,
but receiving more and more of His infinite
and eternal life. And such farewells are
those that we Christian people bid each
other on earth. We are not to be parted
because we shake each other's hands and say
farewell to-night. By-and-by those who belong
to'the old country will have returned; but the
life we receive is a common life, which has its
roots in one divine person. We are going to
meet again, if only we allow the strong
and loving hand of Christ to keep us.
It lies with each of us to determine whether
this shall be a farewell or not. Through
Christ's grace we may rely on being kept so
near to himself that although we may never
meet again under these Australian skies, or
on the soil of the old mother land, we shall
yet meet in a fairer world than this. We are
not going to be divided between now and
then. Life has been blended with life in
the meetings and services that we have held
together. You have spoken to God and
entreated Him to let His Spirit rest upon us
all, and in answer to your prayers I believe His
Spirit has revealed to us together the glories
of the same love and the splendoursof thesame
infinite grace. Those whose lives have thus
been fused even for a little time under the
fire that fails from heaven cannot be sepa-
rated. We are not one only in Christ, as all
those are one who have been drawn into
union with Him by the power of the Holy
Ghost, but one because we have shared the
same joys in His presence, and have received
together gifts from His hands. Do you
suppose, however far they may have been
separated from each other, that those who
met in the upper-room at Jerusalem could
ever afterwards live an isolated and indepen-
dent life ? Was not the life of every one of
the Apostles blended with the life of every
other Apostle, because the fire of the divine
love had rested upon them together and at the
same time. They lived a common life, no
matter though mountains and oceans divided
them ; and I shall trust, my dear Christian
friends, that even if we are separated by
12,000 miles of ocean you whose homes are
in this beautiful city, and we whose homes
are in England, shall be conscious that our
lives are blended together for ever in the
eternal life of God. (Loud cheers.)
DEPARTURE OF THE ENGLISH DELE-
GATES FROM ADELAIDE.
Dr. Dale and family, and Mr. and Mrs.
Albert Spicer left Adelaide on Thursday
afternoon, September 29, by the express for
Melbourne, Prior to their departure the
visitors, with a dozen or so of their most in-
timate Adelaide friends, were entertained at
luncheon by His Honor Chief Justice Way
at his residence at Montefiore. At the Ade-
laide railway station there was a large and
representative gathering, including most of the
city and suburban Congregational ministers.
Mutual regrets at parting were freely ex-
pressed on both sides, the visitors professing
their deep gratitude for the hospitality they
had received during their stay in the colony.
As the train moved off three hearty cheers
were given by those on the platform.
THE NEW HEBRIDES.
The following telegram from the Presbytery
of Victoria, with reference to the resolution
adopted at the Conference regarding the New
Hebrides (page 86), was received too late to
be inserted in its proper place :
" To Chairman Intercolonial Conference,
Adelaide. Thank Conference in our name
for resolution re New Hebrides.

A SUGGESTION TO THE OFFICERS
AND TEACHEKS OF OUR SUNDAY
SCHOOLS.
" The Jubilee Record of Congregationalism
in South Australia," by the Rev. F. W. Cox,
a review of which we publish in another
column, is now published. It will contain a
complete history of our Churches in this
colony, the story of the unswerving
testimony which our fathers bore to the
cause of religious freedom, and of the
important and conspicuous part which Con-
gregationalists have played in moulding the
public life ©f the colony. It will be in every
sense a most valuable addition to our
literature, and should be carefully studied
by every Congregationalist. We urge this
upon the attention of the officers and
teachers of our Sunday Schools. Let them
see that a copy is put into the hands of
every scholar above the age say of 17 years.
This might easily be done if the teachers
would bring the matter before their scholars.
It would make an appropriate reward to the
successful children. We commend this very
earnestly to the officers and teachers. Only
as our young people know the splendid
history of our Churches, and thus learn the
cost at which the privileges that they enjoy
have been bought, will they properly
appreciate them.— Jubilee Independent.

FOR THE CAUSE OF TEMPERANCE
AND TRUTH.
Repeated analyses have undeniably proved
that almost without exception the Bitters of
various makes and names so widely adver-
tised contain the smallest possible allowance
of medicinal ingredients and the largest
permissible quantity of alcohol, and that of
the cheapest, commonest, and most injurious
kind. The consequence is that not only is
there no benefit derived from them, but that
very real injury often results from their con-
tinued use, while the high price charged for
them would warrant the expectation of a
really good article. Finding the above state-
ments to be undoubtedly correct, we have
sought to introduce an article which, while
absolutely
FREE FROM ALCOHOL,
shall yet be replete with medicinal virtues of
the most wholesome nature. In the pre-
paration now so well known as BIKES'
BITTERS these advantages are combined
in a marked degree, and while those who
wish only for a polite form of tippling, and
are not satisfied without being continually
dosed with spirits, may turn from them with
indifference, yet all who seek an honest
remedy, a wholesome, uninjurious, yet
palatable medicine, suitable to the necessities
of our depressing climate, with its constant
changes and enervating heat, will find in
BIRRS' BITTERS what they need.
We lay no claim to the discovery of an un-
failing cure-all, a universal panacea for the
diseases of humanity, but recognizing how
many of these arise from a disordered diges-
tion and an inactive liver, we receive with
the utmost satisfaction the repeated
assurances of those who testify with heartfelt
gratitude to the very beneficial effects re-
sulting from even a short course of treatment
with our Bitters. From our experience of
the past three years we can confidently re-
commend BIRKS' BITTERS. In
cases of ordinary Indigestion, Flatulence and
Biliary Derangement, as well as loss of
Appetite, Inordinate Craving for Food,
Giddiness, Nervous Excitement, Chronic
Constipation, Persistent Headache of
Females, Sick Stomach, Morning Sickness,
Heartburn, General Debility, and many other
minor evils, all arising from derangement of
the digestive organs, from which, by the
various channels of nutrition, the whole
system is fed.
SOMETHING NEW.
It is some time now since we were able to
report anything very striking in the way of
improvements in Sewing Machines, so we
have pleasure in calling attention to a new
patented process just invented and used on
some of our Machines, which makes them
absolutely silent—by comparison with any
others. As this will be readily recognised
as along-felt want, we trnst that all who are
not thoroughly satisfied with their present
Machines, and Ladies not yet possessing this
household necessity, will at least inspect ours
before deciding on any.

STYLES.
Vide the following report:—
•Messrs. G. P. Doolette & Co. occupy a considerable
space to the north of that portion of the eastern
annexe allotted to South Australia. Side by side are
pifcced two black-and-gold cases, 7 ft. 6 in. by 2 feet,
which contain specimens of shirts manufactured and
dressed by the firm. The collection numbers about
150, and all of the goods are excellently got up. The
majoyjortion of the shirts are white, but several are
made of neatly patterned materials. In front of these
cases is a red cedar vitrine, in which are shown
specimens of court dress, and ordinary, military,
hunting, and scholastic hats sold by the firm. The
show is a first-class .one. A novelty in connection
with ,this case is the style in which the firm's sign is
inscribed on the case. The lettering is in gold, and
each letter is studded with holes, in which are hung
small electro-plate discs that are kept constantly
swinging by means of an electric battery placed at
the rear. The effect is very striking.
