SHAREHOLDERS OF HACKSHALLS LIMITED
ON 28tli November, 1912, Hacksballs Limited first became incorporated as a
Company r— that is just forty years ago. 1 o commemorate these forty years of
progress >—> for sucb they have been the Directors think it a fitting occasion
to give a brief history of the development that has taken place over the years, believing
that such information will be of interest to the Shareholders, especially to those who
have acquired their holdings in recent years.
This brochure, too, in recording the progress of the Company since its commence-
ment, is proof that Hackshalls Limited has been built on solid foundations and should
continue to prosper.
The growth of the Company is reflected in the increase which took place over
the years in Paid-up Capital,
In 1912 Paid-up Capital was £750. This was increased in 1914 to £1,050 and
in 1917 to £1.250. Then in 1918 to £7,000, in 1920 to £17,500, in 1922 to £26,500,
in 1923 to £60,000, in 1925 to £BB,OOO, in 1926 to £lOO,OOO, in 1928 to £150,000,
in 1929 to £250,000, in 1935 to £300,000, at which figure it remains to-day.
BEGINNINGS OF MASCOT FACTORY.
The Company began its operations in 1912 at the present Head Office site in
Old Botany Road, Mascot. The district was then sparsely populated and little indus-
trialised. The Company was then, as now, engaged in the manufacture of biscuits.
EXTENSION TO SUVA. FIJI.
In 1921 a very careful survey was made by Mr. H. R, Gough of trade conditions
and possibilities in Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, with the result that the Directors decided


to build and equip a biscuit factory in Rodwell Road, Suva. Manufacturing
commenced there in 1922. This branch of the Company, which trades under the
name of Pacific Biscuit Co., is under the personal control of our co-director, Mr.
Malcolm M. Brodie, who has now served there for 28 years.
In 1950 the Company, with others, became interested in the formation of Union
Soaps Pty. Limited for the purpose of manufacturing soap and expressing Cocoanut
Oil in Suva, Fiji. A substantial share interest is held in this company. In 1947 the
directors of both Hackshalls Limited and Union Soaps Pty. Limited decided to increase
the size of their respective adjacent factories and in 1951 the buildings were completed.
The biscuit and soap factories have now a combined frontage of 554 feet to Rodwell
Road through to Struan Street, Suva,
It is interesting to note that the population of Fijians and Indians has substan-
tially increased during the 50 years of manufacturing in Suva. The original total in
1921 was approximately 126,000 and this has more than doubled at the present date.
Estimates show that a further steep increase will take place in coming years.
The Pacific Biscuit Company and Union Soaps Pty. Limited supply biscuits and
soap respectively to the Fijian island group, Rotuma, Samoa, Tonga, Fanning Island,
Washington Island, Line Island, Niue Island, Solomon Islands, Gilbert and Ellice
Islands and Cook Islands. Union Soaps oil mills are working practically 24 hours
a day manufacturing Cocoanut Oil for both soap making purposes and shipment to
the British Ministry of Food, London, and the by-product, Oil Meal, is used locally
and is also shipped to the United Kingdom and New Zealand.
The Fiji factories are well staffed and managed. The Company in its building
programme provided a manager s residence and cottages for its European employees.
FURTHER EXPANSION IN BISCUIT MANUFACTURING.
The 80-year-old business of Hardman Bros. Pty. Ltd., Biscuit Manufacturers,
of Sarah Street, Newtown, was acquired in 1925, and with future development in


mind the Directors from time to time purchased a number of properties adjoining or
adjacent to the biscuit factory. (In due course the Southern Cross Flour Mills and the
Sunshine Bread Company, Newtown, were built and established at this centre.) Here
again there has been considerable building extensions since 1925, and further addi-
tions are at present in progress.
ENTRY INTO BREAD MANUFACTURING.
During the years 1928-1929 entry was made into the bread industry. A num-
ber of bakeries was purchased, including the old established bakeries of Morans
Limited, Randwick, and W. R. Moran Limited, Camperdown; also Palmers Bakery,
Rozelle; Reed & Stephens, Annandale; Olivers Limited, Darlinghurst; Freemans
Bakery, Darlinghurst; Petersham Bakery, Petersham; Raiths Bakery, Stanmore. An
entirely new bakery was built at Railway Parade, Burwood. In 1953, Hunters
Bakery, North Sydney, was acquired. Later, the common name of * Sunshine bread
was applied to the product of the whole of the bakeries and a large new bakery was
built on the Newtown site. This is the most up-to-date bakery in Australia, being
equipped with the most modern plant, including gas travelling ovens and bread
handling plant for the manufacture of high quality bread. Also installed at this
bakery is the latest machinery for the wrapping and slicing of the well-known Sunshine
Sliced and Wrapped Bread. A plant is also installed for bread canning. The trade
of many of the smaller bakeries previously acquired was incorporated into the business
of the Newtown bakery.
FLOUR MILLING ACTIVITIES.
During 1935 the Southern Cross Flour Mills were built on the Newtown site,
and completely equipped with the most modern flour milling plant under the super-
vision of Mr. F. C. Bates, who has since capably managed the undertaking. The flour
mills supply flour to the bakeries and have proved a valuable addition to the export
Island business.


GENERAL SUMMARY OF INTERESTS.
The present interests of the Company include
1. Head Office and Factory, Mascot.
2. Branches and Factories of Sunshine Bread Co. at Newtown, Burwood,
Balmain and North Sydney: Southern Cross Flour Mills, Newtown; and
Pacific Biscuit Company, Suva.
3. Wholly owned subsidiary companies; Morans Pty. Limited, Randwick;
Sunshine Bakeries Pty, Limited, Camperdown; Hardman Bros. Pty. Limited,
Newtown.
In addition to the capital invested in the avenues indicated in the foregoing, a
substantial holding of shares is held in Union Soaps Pty. Limited, Suva; Australian
Soaps Limited, Sydney; and Starkeys Limited, Sydney. In respect of both the latter
companies, Mr. H. R. Gough is Chairman of Directors. Shares are also held in a
number of companies listed on the Stock Exchange.
CONCLUSION.
The Directors realise that this brief record of development and achievement
could not have been reached without the enterprise and co-operation of their staff, and
they wish to pay tribute to all who have so loyally assisted in the Company s progress.
In order to commemorate this occasion the Directors have declared a special
(non-repetitive) commemoration dividend of 2i%> payable to shareholders whose names
are registered on the Company share register on the 14th November, 1952.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
The Director’s have pleasure in. submitting to shareholders the Annual Accounts of the Company
for the year ended 30th June, 1952. Nett profit earned was £42,679 after providing for taxation and
writing off £14,891 depreciation.
Satisfactory results were obtained, despite trading conditions which have given concern.
The heavy increase granted in respect of quarterly basic wage adjustments is having an unfortunate
effect on all costs, creating an inflationary factor with resulting general instability throughout the
economy.
It is regretted that the Taxation on the earnings of Public Companies remains at 9/- in the £ and
that Pay Roll Tax is still levied on all wages and salaries paid. The taking of 9/- in tax from each £1
of profits earned and the further taxing of so much, of the remaining 11/- as is distributed as dividend,
according to the individual shareholders’ rate of tax, represents far too great a share of company
profit to be taken by Government Authorities.
Supplies of most lines of goods are in excess of the demand and on a market that is strongly
competitive the continuation of Price Control is both unwarranted and unnecessary.
In accordance with the Articles Mr. M. M. Brodie retires from the Board but is eligible for
re-election and offers himself accordingly.
Mr. Robert Barclay, F.C.A. (Aust.), the Company’s Auditor, retires in accordance with the
Articles and being eligible offers himself for re-appointment.
PROPOSED ALLOCATION OF PROFIT
It is recommended that the profit of £42,679 be dealt with as follows:
(1) That a final dividend of 64% be declared payable on the 10th October, 1952. With
the interim distribution of 6ifo this makes the full year’s dividend and absorbs
£37,500.
(2) That the balance of £5,179 be added to the balance brought forward of £41,877 leaving
the final amount to be carried forward £47,056.
