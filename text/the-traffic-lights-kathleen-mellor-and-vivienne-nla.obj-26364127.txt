"How do you get that willing co-operation?" is a
question often put to a pre-school teacher. In
this picture-story book two Lady Gowrie Child
Centre teachers give you some answers:
"Make learning interesting"; "present children with
the reasons In ways that are meaningful to them";
"make it a positive approach, no Dont's or Threats
or coercion through Fear"; "rather know that it is
soul satisfying for the young child to identify himself
with the great and the strong and behave as they
do". Safety rules dramatized come home to
children in a vital way, and will help them to become
cautious without making them timid and fearful.
The creative teacher who puts her skill into practical
form Is a rare find, and we are grateful to Miss
Mellor and Miss Morris who, through this book,
reveal their deep understanding of how young
children learn joyfully.
