ESTABLISHMENT AND CONDUCT

NEW SOUTH WALES.
PRINTED FOE THE BOARD OF NATIONAL EDUCATION
BY R. BARR,
124, YORK STREET, SYDNEY.
1853.




fA 3
REGULATIONS, &C-
CHAPTER I.
AS TO THE BUILDING AND ESTABLISHMENT OF SCHOOLS.
T-1
1. The Commissioners will grant aid towards the
building and support of Schools of two classes, Ele-'
mentary Schools and Schools of Industry; but they
can grant aid only to a limited number of the latter,
and they must be at certain distances from each other.
One third, at least, of the cost of each building must
be locally subscribed and provided for, under the
guarantee of the Local Patrons, who will be expected
to pay that amount into the Union Bank of Australia
in Sydney, to the credit of the Board of National Edu-
cation, or actually expend it upon the School House,
before the sum to be contributed by the Board can be
made available.
2. Applicants for aid towards the building of a
School House or towards the support of a School already
established, are to submit the names of not less than
three persons, who have consented to act as the Local
Patrons, under the superintendence and directions of
the Board of Commissioners. In the selection of Local


Patrons it is desirable that each of the leading religious
denominations of the colony should be represented in
the person of at least one Patron.
3. All applications are to be in writing, and are to
state the number of children expected to attend the
School, distinguishing males from females, and to
furnish such other particulars as are comprised in the
form of application given in Appendix A.
4. The Commissioners will consider themselves at
any time entitled to add to the number of Local Patrons
of a School, to name such additional Patrons, and to
remove, for sufficient cause, any Local Patron.
5, Applicants for aid towards the Building of a
School House, in cases where grants of land for this
purpose cannot be obtained from the Crown, will be re-
quired to describe the site of the intended building, and
the nature of the title to the land forming its site, and
to procure a conveyance of the fee simple (or lease
where specially agreed on), to be made to the Board of
Commissioners. If the Commissioners approve of the
application, a plan and specification of the necessary
works, with an estimate of the expense thereof, must
be submitted to them, and, if approved of, they will
then notify the extent of aid which they are disposed
to grant, within the limitation expressed in clause 1.
The conveyance must be duly executed before the works
are commenced,
6. The Commissioners will require that each School
Building shall admit of a separate room being set
apart for the reception of children while under special
religious instruction. Without wishing to prescribe
authoritatively, the Commissioners invite the attention
of local Patrons to the plans in Appendix 8., as furnish-
ing examples of the best mode of constructing and
furnishing Schools.


7. The Commissioners will contribute, where neces-
sary, a portion of the expense required in the first in-
stance for fitting up or furnishing a School House, but
provision must thenceforth be locally made for keeping
the house repaired and furnished.
8. When the School House is completed, the in-
scription, „ NATIONAL SCHOOL,”
and no other, shall be put up conspicuously on the
outside.
CHAPTER 11.
AS TO THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOLS.
1. The Commissioners will grant a salary to a master
and mistress for their joint services of not less than
£5O per annum.
2. The income of the Teacher is to be augmented'
by such school fees as shall be paid by the parents
of the children under regulations to be framed by the
Local Patrons of each School. In framing such regula-
tions the attention of the Local Patrons is invited to
the Circular of the Board on this subject (Appendix C.).
Further augmentation of the income of deserving
Teachers by local subscriptions may be appropriately,
and, it is hoped, not unfrequently resorted to.
3. In addition to the weekly fee paid to the Teacher,
each child will be required to pay a further sum of one
half-penny per w T eek towards a Book Fund. The sum
thus raised will be appropriated to the furnishing
and maintaining a supply of the requisite books for
the use of the School. The Teacher shall be responsi-
ble for the safe custody of the books, which are to be
considered the property of the Commissioners, and
are not to be taken from the School House,


4. If tlie parents desire to purchase books for their
children, in order to admit of their use at home, eveiy
facility will be given for procuring them, through the
Teacher, at the reduced prices mentioned in the list
provided by the Board (Appendix D.)
CHAPTER 111.
AS TO TEACHERS.
1. The appointment of Teachers rests solely with
the Commissioners, who will, however, pay regard
to any recommendation of candidates by Local Patrons.
2. A Teacher should be a person of Christian senti-
ment, of calm temper and discretion, imbued with a
spirit of peace, of obedience to the law and loyalty to
the Sovereign ; and should not only possess the art of
communicating knowledge, but be capable of moulding
the minds of youth, and of giving a useful direction
to the power which education confers. These are the
qualities for which Patrons of Schools, on their recom-
mendation of Teachers, should anxiously look. They
are those which the Commissioners are anxious to find,
to encourage, and to reward.
3. Candidates for appointment as Teachers under
the Board are to apply in terms of the Form given in
Appendix E. They must possess an elementary know-
ledge of the subjects usually taught in National
Schools, that is, reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar
and geography —this knowledge will be tested by an
examination before the Head Master of the Model
School in Sydney, who will report upon their qualifi-
cations. They must also attend for a sufficient period
at the Model School to acquire a familiarity with the
methods of teaching there adopted.
4. The Board will not appoint or continue as Teacher
any person who is a recognized minister of religion, or


who acts in public as religious instructor, the exercise
of such a function by a Teacher being calculated to
excite religious jealousy, and thus to interfere with
the impartial and national character of the School.
5. Should the Commissioners consider a Teacher
unfit for office, or otherwise objectionable, they shall
have the power to dismiss summarily such Teacher,
and to provide another.
6. The Commissioners will regard the conduct of
any Teacher taking an active part in public meetings
held for political purposes, as incompatible with the
performance of his duties.
CHAPTER IY.
AS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF SCHOOLS
The ordinary School business, during which all children,
of whatever denomination they may be, are required to
attend, will be governed by the Time Table given in
Appendix F., and no vacations are to be given without
special permission.
2. During an hour of each day (designated in the
Time Table) children, whose parents desire that they
should receive special religious instruction from the
pastors or other approved religious teachers of their
icspective communions, are to be allowed to receive such
instruction, so far as the School Buildings will admit
of distinct classes being formed. Every National
School is to be so arranged as to admit of the forma-
tion of one such denominational class at least; and if
the simultaneous teaching of more than one be im-
practicable, it will, of course, be necessary to arrange
that classes of the different denominations be formed
on distinct days of the week. If the hour appointed
in the time table be found inconvenient to any Reli-
gious Instructor, a special appointment for some other


time may be made with the Teacher. —Such arrange-
ments are left to the good feelings and convenience of
the parties concerned, as circumstances must necessarily
vary too much to admit of any uniform regulations
being applicable.
3. In case no special religious instructor should at-
tend during this hour, it is to be employed by all the
children who are able to read, upon the Scripture Les-
sons compiled for the general use of the National
Schools, and all whose parents do not desire them to
attend the denominational class, are to remain so
employed for the same interval, wherever this is pos-
sible without their overhearing or interrupting the
denominational class; provided that if the parents of
any children object to the reading of the Scripture
Lessons, such children shall be excused therefrom.
4. The Teacher is to take care that the religious
books employed in the denominational classes be
strictly confined to the time and place of denomina-
tional instruction, and that they be not left in the
way of the children whose parents may object to them.
5. The Commissioners will require that the principle
of the General Lesson, Appendix G., be strictly incul-
cated in all Schools under their superintendence, and
a printed copy of the lesson itself, to be furnished by
them, shall be hung up in each School.
6. The Teachers are expressly enjoined to use, for
the ordinary School business, such works only as are
supplied or sanctioned by tbe Commissioners. The
titles of Books, not supplied by the Commissioners,
which Conductors of Schools may wish to use, are to
be reported to the Commissioners, and such Books are
not to be used until the Board shall have notified its
approval of them.


7. Registers (according to the form given in Ap-
pendix H.) are to he kept in each School. Returns
(according to form Appendix I.) are to be forwarded to
the Board, approved and countersigned by one or more
of the Local Patrons, and duplicates thereof retained
in the School.
8. The Board require that no nse shall he made of
their School Houses tending to contention—such as
the holding of political meetings in them, or bringing
into them political petitions or documents of any
kind for signature; and that they shall not at any
time be converted into places of public worship : any
such use made of a School House, being a violation
of the principles of the National Education System,
will be regarded by the Commissioners as a sufficient
reason for dismissing the Teachers, and withdrawing
their confidence from the Local Patrons.
CHAPTER V.
ON THE INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS.
1. The Commissioners, by themselves or their officers,
have the Tight to Visit and examine the Schools
whenever they think fit. Those who visit on the
part of the Commissioners will be furnished with cre-
dentials under their seal, which such visitors will shew
to the Teachers.
2. Every Teacher of a National School is required
to receive courteously visitors, both clerical and lay, of
all denominations, who purpose to inspect it, to afford
them free access to the School Room, and full liberty
to observe what works are in the hands of the children
or upon the desks, what tablets are hung up on the
walls, and what is the method of teaching; but Teachers
are by no means to permit any person to interrupt the


business of the School, by asking questions of the
children, examining classes, calling for papers of any
kind, or in any way diverting their own attention or
that of their scholars from the usual business. This
restriction is of course not intended to interfere with
the provision of Rule 2, Chap, iv., whereby access is
afforded to clergymen and religious teachers of any de-
nomination, for the purpose of communicating special
religious instruction during any day in the week.
3. Should Visitors wish for information which
they cannot obtain by such inspection, it will be the
duty of the Teacher to refer them to the Local Patrons.
4. Every Teacher is required to have the “Visitors’
Book” lying upon his desk, that visitors may, if
they ghoose, enter remarks in it. Such,remarks the
Teachers are by no means to alter or erase.
5. The Commissioners reserve to themselves the
power of altering or revoking any of the foregoing
Regulations, as from time to time, it shall seem to
them to be expedient or necessary.

APPENDIX.
(B.)
The Plan marked No. 2 would be best for Country Schools*
being adapted for both sexes. This Plan could be enlarged or di-
minished, to suit the probable number of Children.
The Plans are intended to show the general arrangements; but
the buildings must be of that material that can be obtained in the
locality of the intended School.
The smaller Plan No. 1 would also do for a Country School of
two sexes, the divisions by curtains nearly separating the rooms;
and being only for 48 Children, would most probably have both
sexes from families.
The two larger Plans are adapted for populous places.
HENRY ROBERTSON,
Architect to the Board of National Education.

Circular No. 1. National Education Office, Sydney.
Gentlemen,— The subject of the Fees payable by the Parents of Children
attending the National Schools having excited some difference of opinion in the
Country Districts of the Colony, the Commissioners of National Education have
been induced to lay the following considerations before the various Boards of
Local Patrons, and I am directed to reqnest that the plan founded thereon
may be generally adopted.
School fees have come under the deliberation of this Board in three points of
view, viz.;—The propriety of receiving them ; the proper amount of them ; and
the best mode of appropriating them.
1. On the first head, it has been urged by certain Local Patrons that instruc-
tion ought’to be imparted perfectly gratuitously, and that no fees ought to be
raised from the parents of children attending National Schopls. All experience,
however, as well as the evidence taken on this subject both in Great Britain and
New South Wales, goes to prove that the classes of society most likely to avail
themselves of these Schools, are apt to care little for education given gratis, and
are induced to make their children attend regularly at school, by few circum-
stances, so much as the idea that they lose their money when they allow a child
to play truant. The object of the Commissioners, therefore, is not so much to
raise a fund from these fees, as to give parents a pecuniary interest in making
their children attend school regularly. The Board think, moreover, it very ad-
viseable that some fee, however small, should be exacted from the poorest parent,
in order that no child may be taunted by schoolfellows with being a pauper, de-
pending entirely for education on the charity of the community.
2. With respect to the amount of the fee to be taken for each child, the Com-
missioners conceive that no parent ought to be called on to pay less than three-
pence per week, leaving any increase on that sum to the judgment of the Local
Patrons.
3. According to Rule 2, Chapter 2, of the Regulations published for these
Schools, it will be seen that the Board require that their teachers shall have a
portion of their income derivable from school fees. The Commissioners, indeed,
consider that in no way can the school fees be so well appropriated as in the
augmentation of the income of the teachers. While, however, the teachers will
thus have a direct interest in the increase of the number of his scholars, he must
understand well that this Board cannot recognise his right to determine the
amount payable in any individual case. That amount must rest on the decision
of a majority of Local Patrons—the simple question to be decided by them in
every case being, that sum which will be so small as to encourage the parent to
send his child to the National School, and at the same time so large as to render
him anxious not to lose the value of his money ; payment in advance may bo ad-
visable to enlist this latter motive in favour of the punctual attendance of the
child. If the Local Patrons should most properly conceive that the advantage
and respectability of their children’s teacher ought likewise to be attended to,
they are expected by the Board to supply whatever they may deem deficient in
his'income bv voluntary subscription rather than by any undue pressure on the
poor, which would infallibly tend to keep children away from the school, and
thus’thwart the benevolent intentions of the Legislature.
I have the honor to be, Gentlemen.
Your most obedient Servant,
W. C. WILLS, Sec.
To the Local Patrons of the National School at
Note.—When this Circular was originally printed, a minimum of one penny was therein sug-
gested, but the altered circumstances of the colony have now rendered a higher payment
advisable.


APPENDIX.
. (D.)
Circular, No. 2, . . „ ,
National Education Office, Sydney.
Gentlemen— The subject of the charge for National School Books having been
duly considered by the Board of National Education, I am directed to lay before
you the following regulations relating thereto, with a request that they may be
strictly adhered to. . .
Ist. By Buie 9, chapter I, of the printed regulations, it will be seen that
the Teacher of every National School, is held responsible for the books
which are furnished by the commissioners at stated prices ; and to prevent con-
fusion which would inevitably ensue, by opening a debtor and creditor account
with each Teacher for school books, the Board have considered it expedient
that whatever books are required from time to time for the use ot the
scholars, shall be applied for by the teachers, and paid for by them in advance.
2nd. The books will be furnished at the prices undermentioned, and on no
account is any master or mistress to sell them at a higher rate, or sell them to
any one except their own scholars. . , . ~
3rd. The Commissioners will also furnish, at the prices mentioned in the
second column, any books which they may have to spare to Schools not National.

enable me, in the opinion of the Head Master, to conduct a National
School with efficiency.
If appointed, I bind myself to observe all the Board’s regulations,
and to carry out, as far as I am able, the system of National Educa-
tion.
DIRECTIONS FOR CANDIDATES.
1. Candidates for situations under the Board of National Educa-

Circular No. 7.
National Education Office,
Sydney, Ist March, 1851,
Sir, —The subjoined Tables, shewing the subjects taught at a
National School, and the particular time devoted to each, are
forwarded for your guidance in the conduct of the School under
your superintendence.
Haying settled a time table for your own School, it is to be
plainly written and hung up in a conspicuous part of the School
Boom. It is not intended by the literal adoption of this Time

therein ; but it will be a guide to Teachers in distributing the
occupations of the children.
It is imperative however,
1. That the subjects named therein be taught;
2. The time of instruction observed;
3. The hour for religious Instruction observed.
Time to be distributed in these pro-

GENEEAL LESSON.
“ Christians should endeavour, as the Apostle Paul commands
“ them, to live peaceably with all men.” — Rom. cJi. xii. 18.
“ Our Saviour Christ commanded his disciples to love one another,
“He taught them to love even their enemies, to bless those that
“ cursed them, and to pray for those that persecuted them. He, him-
“ self, prayed for his murderers.”
“ Many men hold erroneous doctrines, but we ought not to hate
“or persecute them. We ought to seek for the truth, and to hold
“ fast what we are convinced is the truth; but not to treat harshly
“ those who are in error. Our Saviour did not intend his religion
“to be forced on men by violent means. He would not allow his
“ disciples to fight for him.”
“ If any persons treat us unkindly, we must not do the same to
u them, for Christ and his Apostles have taught us not to return
“ evil for evil. If we would obey Christ, we must do to others not
“ as they do to us, but as we should wish them to do to us.”
“ Quarrelling with our neighbours and abusing them is not the
“ way to convince them that we are in the right and they in the
“ wrong: it is more likely to convince them tbat we have not a
u Christian Spirit.”
“ Wo ought to shew ourselves followers of Christ, who when he
was reviled reviled not again.”—l Pet. ch. ii. 23.

Circular No. 14,
National Education Office, )
Sydney, Ist June, 1853. J
Sir, —I Lave the honor, by direction of the Board of National Education, to
forward to you revised blank Schedules, numbered I and 2, for the purpose of
enabling you to furnish therein the Quarterly Returns of the Children attend-
ant upon your School, and the Yearly Return of the expense of supporting the
School. These Schedules, will supersede the forms in the printed circulars Nos.
10 and 12.
2. You will take care to forward the Return No. 1 at the close of this and
every succeeding Quarter. As these Schedules will obviate the necessity of
ruling forms yourself as heretofore, and are intended to secure uniformity in the
National School Returns, I ana directed to request you will take great care, that
they are made under the various headings with neatness and correctness. They
are to be in Duplicate, Oxe part to be forwarded to this Office ; the Other to
be retained by yourself as a record of the School for the information of the
Inspector and of the Public. No Salary due, or accruing at or after the end of
any quarter, will be paid, until the Return properly completed, has been received
at this Office.
3. You will also fill in and furnish fo this Office, after the close of
each year as possible, the. Return of the Total Expense of your School, under the
Form No. 2. If the School has not been in operation the whole year, the ex-
pense will be computed from the time of its commencement.
4. The following remarks are intended to guide you in making these Re-
turns; —
First. The School Quarters end on the last Saturday in the months of March,
June, September, and December,
Second. The School weeks end on Friday ; Saturday morning is not to be in-
cluded in the Daily Report. The average attendance will therefore be cal-
culated from the attendance on five days only.
Third. In country Schools the names of children who have left the School
are to be struck off the Rolls at the end of every Quarter.
Fourth. Under the head of Total Number of Children on the Class Rolls,
state the Total Number of Children who have attended during the Quarter.
Fifth. The attendance of Boys and Girls is to be kept separate iu the Daily
Report Book.
Sixth. In stating the amount of School Fees paid, include all contributions
from the parents,of children, whether in kind or otherwise.
Seventh. Under the head “Amount paid] for Books.” state the sums paid in
accordance with the rule laid down in Chap. 2, Rule 3, of the Regulations.
Eighth. All Returns are to be signed by one of the Local Patrons of the
School, to testify as to their correctness.
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient Servant,
W. C. WILLS,
Secretary’,.
To the Teacher of the National School
