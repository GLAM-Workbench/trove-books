The tyranny of the British Government rent
America from the Empire, and inflicted a deep and
lasting injury on mankind by pi eventing the extension
over the Western World of the genius and the taste
of Englishmen. As a consequence it was confronted
with the question as to where to send those criminals
sentenced to transportation.
While the Ministry were considering the matter,
Mr. James Maria Matra brought forward “ A proposal
for establishing a settlement in New South Wales,” in
August, 1783. This was laid before the Coalition
Government of Fox and Lord North, but the Ministry
went out of office in December, 1783, and no action-
was taken. Mr. Matra’s proposals, however, were
made use of by the Pitt Ministry in preparing the
scheme, which was ultimately carried out. This
scheme appears to have former the basis of Sir George
Young’s proposal, forwarded to Lord Sydney in Janu-
ary, 1785. In the pamphlet issued by Sir George, the
following passage occurs:—" The' proposal here sub-
mitted offers a system more useful and important in
its consequences, than perhaps hitherto attempted;
for, abstracted from all commercial and political
motives, it must certainly tend to promote the
Christian religion among thousands of our fellow
creatures, who are at present totally destitute of all
rational worship, and should it have the good fortune
to obtain His Majesty’s protection, it will add to his
glory for ever.”
On the 23rd January, 1787, the King’s Speech
at the opening of Parliament contained the following
passage:—” A plan has been formed, by my direction,
for transporting a number of convicts in order to re-
move the inconvenience which arose from the crowded
state of the gaols in different parts of the Kingdom;
and you will, I doubt not, take such further measures
as may be necessary for this purpose.”
In this Plan provision was made "To have a
chaplain on board, with a surgeon, and one mate at
least; the former to remain at the settlement.” The-
salary was fixed at £lB2 10s. per annum.
As soon as the scheme for founding the Colony
was decided on by the Ministry, the Premier, not
knowing where to look for a chaplain, sought the aid
of William Wilberforce. Wilberforce enlisted the ser-
vices of his favourite preacher, the Rev. John Newton
ol Olney. In September, 1786, Newton set about to-
hunt for a chaplain, and took into his confidence the
poet Cowper, and Mr. John Thornton, the philanthro-
pist. Cowper was acquainted with a student named'
Richard Johnson, who had expressed a desire to take
Holy Orders. Through the courtesy of the Rev.
Stuart Alexander Donaldson, 8.D., the present Master
of Magdalene College, Cambridge, I am enabled to-
give the following extracts from the Register of that
College with reference to Richard Johnson: —

It may be mentioned that the president—praeses
—was, and still acts as vice-master of the College.
Samuel Pepys was elected Smith Scholar of the
College, October sth, 1683. The Smith Scholar-
ship, as such, does not now exist, but with other
scholarships and exhibitions forms a general fund for
open scholarships. From the above extracts it will
be seen that Mr. Johnson was the son of John John-
son, of Welton, in the County of York, and that he
had been educated at the Public School of Kingston-
upon-Hull. He entered Magdalene College, Cam-
bridge, on January Ist, 1780, as Sizar. In December
of the same year he obtained the Smith Scholarship.
He took his 8.A., degree in 1783, and was ordained
Deacon and Priest in 1786 by the Archbishop of Can-
terbury.
Mr. Johnson’s name was submitted to Wilberforce
by Newton as the only candidate for the Chaplaincy.
Pitt, therefore, accepted Wilberforce’s nomination of
Johnson for the vacancy, and made out the papers
necessary for the appointment. Captain Arthur
Phillip was appointed Governor of New South Wales
12th October, 1786, when a Commission, briefly
worded, was signed. His formal Commission was
dated 2nd April, 1787. In the Instructions issued to
him on 25th April, 1787, the following clause appears:
“ It is further our Royal will and pleasure that you do
by all proper methods enforce a due observance of
religion and good order among the inhabitants of
the new settlement, and that >ou do take such steps
for the due celebration of publick worship as circum-
stances will permit.” Mr. Johnson’s Commission as
Chaplain was dated 24th October, 1786. His salary
was to be at the rate of £lB 2 10s. od. per annum.
His duties commenced on 10th October, and on the
22nd he visited the hulks at Woolwich. Towards
the end of 1786, the following letter of introduction
to Under Secretary Nepeau was handed to Mr. John-
son by Sir Charles Middleton:—
‘‘ Dear Sir, —As Mr. Wilberforce is not >n town


himself, I introduce for a few minutes’ conversation
Mr. Johnson, who is nominated as Minister for Botany
Bay. He has settled his business with the Treasury,
and therefore comes to you for his appointment, and
an order for a few parish things, which are perfectly
proper, and not paid for by individuals. He may
procure them himself, and they may be brought into
one list of necessaries.
“I am, etc.,
“CHAS. MIDDLETON.”
These “parish things” included a Bible and
Prayer Book, and they are those which are so care-
fully preserved in St. Philip’s Church. The Bible has
on it the inscription: “Botany Bay, December 14th,
1786,” and the Prayer Book a similar one. For many
years these precious volumes were kept in an iron
chest in St. Philip’s Vestry, upon the 'id of which
the following inscription was placed:—

In a sermon delivered by Archdeacon Broughton
in St. Philip’s Church on Sunday, January 26th, 1834,
he thus refers to these sacred volumes:—“As an ap-
propriate monument also of the event which this day
witnessed, and in perpetual acknowledgment that the
frame of society should stand upon the Word of God,
and be compacted together by His pure worship, pro-
vision has been made for the preservation within the
walls of this Church, the oldest place of Christian wor-
ship existing in this Colony, of the Bible and Book
of Common Prayer, which accompanied the original
settlers, and were here first used in the service of
Almighty God. May they remind us, and our pos-
terity to the latest generations, of our duty to rever-
ence and study that Sacred Word: and thus at least


to show our thankfulness to God who has brought us
into “ a land where we may eat bread without scarce-
ness, and not lack anything in it.”
It was on the 13th May that Phillip, having
Hoisted his flag on board the “Sirius” as Commodore
of the Squadron, gave the signal to weigh anchor, and
the ships under his command, one after another,
spread their sails to the wind The vessels of the
First Fleet arrived in Jlotany Bay on the 18th, 19th
and 20th January. 1788. The Rev. Mr. Johnson was
on board the “ Golden Grove.” there can be but
little doubt that Divine Service was held on board the
“Golden Grove,” and probably on some of the other
vessels, on that Sunday, but not on shore. There
being no shelter for the ships in the Bay, Phillip went
northward, and found that Cook’s Port Jackson was
the finest harbour in the world. He returned to
Botany Bay, and ordered the ships to proceed 10 Port
Jackson. On the 25th January, 1788, Phillip reached
Port Jackson in the “Supply,” and on the 26th landed
in Sydney Cove, and with a party hoisted a flagstaff,
on which was displayed an Union Jack. This was
on the point of land at the entrance to the rivulet,
near the present site of the Obelisk in Macquarie
Place. About dusk, the “ Sirius” and the rest of
the ships arrived, but too late to take place in the
inaugural ceremony. There was no public thanks-
giving, for the reason that the Chaplain was on board
one of the fleet of vessels that reached the port at
dusk, after the ceremony had been completed by
Phillip and his party of marines. On the following
day, which was Sunday, however, Divine Service was
performed under a great tree by Mr. Johnson in the
presence of the troops and convicts. It was thus the
privilege of the Rev. Richard Johnson to be che first
to raise the Banner of Christianity in this Southern
land, on the banks of a crystal rivulet which flowed
through a thick wood into the waters of the white,
sandy-beached Sydney Cove.
As we have already seen, Phillip had been strictly
enjoined to enforce a due obserrnce of religion, and
to take steps for the celebration ot public worship,
but, unfortunately, these instructions were more hon-
oured in the breach than in the obsci vance. One of
the first buildings to be erected should have been a
Church, in which God could be acknowledged, but the
Chaplain was soon made to understand that the pres-
sure of the important business of building storehouses,
barracks, and dwellings, must be attended to, before
a single thought could be devoted to an House for the
worship of God. Under these circumstances, Divine
Worship continued to be performed every Sunday,
when the weather permitted, under a great tree. The
first Sermon was preached on Sunday, 3rd February,
from the text, “What shall I render unto the Lord
for all His benefits towards me?” (Ps. 116, 12). The
first administration of the Holy Communion was on
the 17th February. The first service under cover was

performed on the 6th April, 1788, by Mr. Johnson, in
one of the new storehouses which was not sufficiently
completed to admit of provisions being stored therein.
Soon after this the stores were housed, and the ser-
vices in the open air were resumed in all kinds of
weather.
It is interesting to know the exact locality of Mr.
Johnson’s house, especially as it was the residence of
the Cowper family at the beginning of the last cen-
tury. It was on the site of the present Lands Office,
and faced the triangular piece of ground called Mac-
quarie Place. The Judge Advocate’s house was on
one side, and the Surveyor-General’s on the other, h
was in this cottage that Dean Cowper was born on
July 3rd, 1810.
In 1792 the Chaplain held Service in an old boat-
house, with both ends open to the weather. In 1793
Mr. Johnson sent to the Rev. John i\ewton the manu-
script of “An Address to the Inhabitants of the
Colonies established in New South Wales and Norfolk
Island.” This was published in London, largely by
subscription. Mr. Johnson’s chief work, by which
his name will be handed down to posterity, was the
building of the first Church in Australia, after waitirg
for five vears for an answer from the Crown to his
frequent appeals. Governor Phillip left the Colony in
December, 1792, without having fulfilled his promise
to erect a place of worship. On the 10th June, 1793,
Mr. Johnson commenced the erection of his "wattle
and daub” Church. It stood at the comer of Bligh
and Hunter Streets. The dimensions of the main
building were 73 feet by 15 feet, and at right angles
there was another building 40 feet by 15 feet. The
structure seated 500 persons, and accommodation
could be provided for 100 more if necessary. It cost
the Clerical Architect £67 12s. nd., of which £sg
18s. 6d. was paid in dollars, and the balance in spirits
and provisions. The sacred edifice was opened on
the 25th August, 1793.
On the 3rd September, 1793, he addressed a
letter to the Right Honourable Henry Dundas, inform-
ing him that he had built a Church, and asking for re-
imbursement of the expense to which he had been put.
This letter was forwarded through the Lieutenant-
Governor, Major Grose, who, in a covering letter, in-
formed Mr. Dundas that Mr. Johnson, “ who is one
of the people called Methodists, is a very troublesome,
discontented character.” It was not until 31st Janu-
ary, 1797, that authority was given to pay Mr. John-
son’s bill, and then it was only through the influence
of Mr. Wilberforce, who told the Secretary of State
for the Colonies that “ he (the Chaplain) was one of
the worthiest men breathing, the most active, and at
the same time very little acquainted with the world.”
The question now arises, Had this Church a
name? If so, what was it called? On this point we
have the information contained in a letter published
in the " London Chronicle” of 4th June, 1789. The


letter is dated 14th November, 1788, and the passage
is as follows:—“As soon as a sufficient quantity of
bricks can be made, a Church is to be built, and
named St. Philip, after the Governor.” As the later
Church was called St. Philip’s, after the Governor, it
is more than likely that this one also was so named.
There are many interesting events chronicled
with reference to this Church, but space will not per-
mit a reference to them.
On the Ist October, 1798, the Church was burned
down. Let me quote Governor Hunter’s own words:—
“ Government and General Order.
“3rd October, 1798.
“ Parole Sacralegious. Countersign Incen-
diary.
“ Whereas some worthless and infamous person
or persons did on Monday last, between the hours
of seven and eight in the evening, wilfully and
maliciously set fire to the Church and School-house,
bv which it was completely consumed. And whereas
the discovery of characters so extremely dangerous
to the Colony at large, as well as to its inhabitants
individually, is of the utmost importance: Notice is
hereby given, that if any person will come forward
and give such information as shall serve to convict so
horrid a character before a Court of Criminal Judica-
ture, they shall receive a reward of £3O. And if the
informer shall happen to be a convict, such convict,
in addition to the above reward, shall receive a full
and absolute emancipation, and be recommended to
the master of any ship in which he or she may desire
to leave the Colony.
“JNO. HUNTER.”
The apparent reason for the destruction of the
Church is given in a Despatch by Governor Hunter
to the Duke of Portland, dated ist November, 1798.
Let me give two extracts from this Despatch:—
‘‘About a month past some wicked and disaffec-
ted person or persons, in consequence of a strict
order which I saw it absolutely necessary to issue,
for compelling a decent attention upon Divine Service
and a more sober and orderlv manner of spending the
Sabbath Day, took an opportunity of a windy and
dark evening and set fire to the Church. This builrl-
ing had also serv’d during the week days as a school-
house, in vihich from one hundred and fifty to two
hundred children were educated under the immediate
superintendence of the clergyman. In two hours it
was completely consumed.” ‘‘ This misfortune of
having our only Church destroy’d has not, however,
answer’d the end propos’d by its destruction—that of
setting aside for a time all appearance of religion or
attendance on Divine Worship, and of employing the
time set apart for those necessary purposes or dutys
in such manner as best corresponded with the differ-
ent views of the various characters; tor, having a short
time before finish’d a large storehouse, which had not
yet been applied to its intended purpose, I have had it


fitted up as a temporary place for public worship, and
I have laid the foundation of a large and substantial
stone Church at Svdney, which we shall continue to
work at with such men as we can afford from other
essential labour untill it is finished.”
Governor Hunter had prepared a piece of land
rear the Lieutenant-Governor’s house, leading from
High Street to the brow of the hill, now known as
Church Hill, and here he laid the foundation stone.
In 1799, an upper chamber in the wheat store,
a building which stooa in High Street, now George
Street, at the corner of Jamieson Street, was used for
the celebration of Divine Service. After the comple-
tion of the Female Orphan School, which was opened
in Captain Kent’s house, by the Rev. Samuel Marsden
or August 16th, 1801, the fittings of the temporary
Church were removed thither, and the dining room
was used as a Church on Sundays. This building
stood in George Street, just below Bridge Street. Mr.
Johnson left the Colony on the 17th October, 1800,
in H.M.S. ” Buffalo,” of which ship Captain Hunter
had assumed the command. We know but little of
his subsequent movements in England. At one time
he was Curate of West Thurcock, near Grays, in
Essex. In 1810 he was appointed to the Rectory of
St. Antholin, in the City of London, and in 1817 he
was inducted to the perpetual Curacy of Ingham, in
Norfolk. He died on March 13th, 1827, at the age
pf 74 years. His memorial, which is now in the
Church of St. Mary, Aldermary, opposite the Mansion
House, in Cannon Street, London, bears this testi-
mony to him:—
“He faithfully preached Christ, and Him
Crucified.”
The second clergyman to reach New South Wales
was the Rev. James Bain, Chaplain of the New South
Wales Corps, which arrived with Major Grose in the
“Pitt” on the 14th February, 1792. Soon after his
arrival he relieved Mr. Johnson of some of his work,
while he was absent at the outlying settlements. No
doubt after the opening of the Church he took part in
the Services, but his duties were specially with the
Military Establishment. In November, 1793, he
accompanied Lieutenant-Governor King to New Zea-
land to leave two New Zealanders there. On the
17th December, 1794, he sailed in the ” Dcedalus,”
with Grose, for England.
On the 10th March, 1794, the Rev. Samuel Mars-
den arrived in Port Jackson in the ship ‘‘ William,” as
Assistant-Chaplain. A few days after his arrival
he took up his residence at Parramatta. It is a
curious fact, which has only recently been elicited,
that Samuel Marsden, like Richard Johnson, was edu-
cated at the Public School of Kingston-upon-Hull. He
was the son of Thomas Marsden of Rawden, near
Leeds, in the County of York. He was admitted a
Sizar to Magdalene College, Cambridge, on the 24th
June, 1790. The Act Book of Dr. Moore, Archbishop


of Canterbury; has the following entry:—“ 24th May,
1794. His Grace granted a letter dimissory to
Samuel Marsden, Student of Magdalene College, Cam-
bridge, and designed for the service of the Church in
the settlement of Botany Bay, to receive Priest’s
Orders from the Bishop of Exeter D(-eacon), 17th
March, 1793, Bristol.”
For a period of six years the Rev. Samuel Mars-
den had no one to assist him in his ministerial duties.
In 1800 he addressed the following letter to the Duke
of Portland:—
“ Sydney, N.S.W., 16th Feb’y, 1800.
“ My dear Duke,
‘‘Some important changes having taken
place in my family since my departure from England,
which render it necessary for me to return, I shall feel
myself happy if your Lordship will request His Ma-
jesty to grant me leave of absence for a short period,
to enable me to settle my private affairs.
“ I am, etc.,
“ SAMUEL MARSDEN.”
This application was not granted until some years
afterwards. Marsden left the Colony with Governor
King in the early part of 1807, and returned to Sydney
in 1810. In order to allow Mr. Marsden to go home,
the Rev. Henry Fulton was recalled from Norfolk Is-
land, and installed in his place. Fulton was once a
beneficed clergyman at Killahoe, but having connected
himself with the 1798 Irish Rebellion, he was transport-
ed to Botany Bay. In 1806, he obtained a free pardon
from Governor King, but this was quite unnecessary,
a", he was never convicted, but was allowed to trans-
port himself, after being compelled to confess that
he had sided with the rebels. Mr. Marsden reached
England in November, 1807, and after a long search,
at length met with two admirable men in the persons
of the Rev. William Cowper, and the Rev. Robert
Cartwright. Mr. Cowper was ordained Deacon by
the Bishop of Winchester, in the Chapel Royal at St.
James’ Palace, in 1803, and Priest in 1808. His ap-
pointment was made by the King-in-Council at St.
James’ Palace in March, 1808, and he arrived in
Sydney on August 18th, ißoq. He took up his
quarters in the Rev. Richard Johnson’s old parsonage
in Macquarie Place, and commenced duty on the day
of his arrival. When Mr. Cowper arrived in Sydney,
he was the only clergyman in Australia. Mr. Mars-
den returned to the Colony in February, 1810, and
Mr. Cartwright arrived towards the middle of that
year. Mr. Marsden went to Parramatta, while Mr.
Cartwright took charge of the Hawkesbury district.
On the 26th June, 1707, H.M.S. “Reliance”
brought to the Colony a large clock. A few months
afterwards Governor Hunter built a square tower 150
feet high on the brow of Church Hill. At the end of
December, 1797, the tower was completed and the
clock placed in position. It was used bv the officers
as a sort of observatory. The clock began to tell
the time on January 31st, 1798.
Beyond laying the foundation-stone at the base


of the tower in October, i 798, very little progress was
made in the erection of the Church during the re-
maining months of that year. The foundations were
excavated for a Church 150 feet long anu 52 feet in
width. The works at the Church were almost at a
standstill during 1799. On the 4th, sth and 6th June,
1799, a southerly gale raged in Sydney, accompanied
with torrents of rain. Many public buildings were
blown down, including the substantial stone windmill
on the site of the Grosvenor Hotel. Later in the
month there was another heavy gale, and this de-
stroyed one side of the clock tower. Fortunately the
clock was found to have sustained little or no
damage.
During the year 1799 the Governor rebuilt
square tower, and set up the clock in it again.
On April 16th, 1800, Governor King arrived in the
“Speedy.” He assumed the Government on Septem-
ber 25th, but Governor Hunter and the Rev. Richard
Johnson did not leave the Colony until October 20th,
1800, in H.M.S. “Buffalo.” On September 25th,
1800, Governor Hunter forwarded to the British Gov-
ernment a list of the public buildings in progress up
to that date. Speaking of St. Philip’s Churcti, he
says:—“A Church at Sydney: the foundation dug out,
and was to be built of stone until it became on a
level with the base of the clock tower, and then to
have been completed of brick.” Governor King ad-
mitted the truth of these remarks, and wrote opposite
to them the following words:—“ Will be begun about
as soon as possible, as the absolute necessity of that
building is evident.” On August 2ist, 1801, Gover-
nor King wrote to Sir Joseph Banks that he had re-
ceived a London newspaper, which contained a state-
ment that Sydney boasted of having ‘‘an elegant stone
Church.” He then added, “ the statement is quite
untrue,” “ one of brick and stone will be finished in
the course of the year at Parramatta, and the founda-
tion of one at Sydnev has just begun.” Governor
King reduced Governor Hunter’s foundations from 150
to 97 feet in length, and from 52 to 32 feet in width.
On July 23rd, 1802, Governor King, by General
Order, fixed the boundaries of the Parishes of Sydney
and Parramatta. That part of the Order which refers
to St. Philip’s is as follows:—‘‘His Excellency is
pleased to direct that in all spiritual, judicial, and
parochial proceedings, transactions, deeds, instru-
ments, and registers, the Districts of Sydnev, Peters-
ham, Bulanaming, Concord and Liberty Plains, be
comprized within a parish, to be henceforth named
‘St. Philip.’ in honour of the first Governor of the
Territory.” The Order concludes by stating that
‘‘the Churches now building at Sydney and Parra-
matta be respectively named St. Phihp, in honour of
the first Governor or the Territory, and St. John, in
honour of the late Governor, Captain John Hunter.”
On December 20th, 1803, the beautiful Service of Com-
munion Plate, which is so highly prized at St. Philip’s,


arrived by H.M.S. “Calcutta.” The Service com-
prises a Flagon, fifteen inches in height, with a handle
three inches higher; two cJialices, each ten inches in
height, and two Patens, each 10J inches in diameter.
A cross runs through the Sacred monogram, “1.H.5.,”
Da each article, and below is the inscription, which
reads as follows:
“This Service of Communion Plate was presented
by His Majesty King George the Third for the use
of the Chapel at His Majesty’s Settlement at Sydney,
in New South Wales, 1803.” The “ Gazette” notice
of the arrival of the Plate adds: —“To that Royal
donation is added tablets of the Lord’s Prayer, Belief
and Ten Commandments.”
George Caley, writing to Sir Joseph Banks in
1803, says:—“The best public building in the Colony
is a new Church at Parramatta, which is not yet fin-
ished. Another is also begun in Sydney.”
On March Ist, 1804, Governor King wrote to
Lord Hobart, “ Respecting the officers’ attendance:
I have signified your Lordship’s suggestion to them,
and required them to be more constant in their atten-
dance on Divine Service than has hitherto been the
case, which I have no doubt they will do when the
Church at Sydney is finished. The walls are of hewn
stone, and as it is covering in I hope it will be sufficient-
ly completed to perform Divine Service in it in two
months hence!” Governor King must have been mis-
leading the Home Government, for, on 13th August,
1806, we read with reference to the new Church: “The
wall at one end down, and the tower; the roof only-
half up.”
Governor King’s administration came to an end
on August 13th, 1806, by the assumption of office by
Governor Bligh. Two months before Bligh’s arrival,
the Church had the misfortune to lose its fine square
tower. On June 4th, 1806, a fearful storm raged,
and the clock tower fell. On July 6th, 1806, Gover-
nor King laid the foundation of a new tower. This
was the round tower which figures in the old views
of Sydney. Apparently, King had seen the old
Church of Beeston St. Laurence, in Norfolk, and was
determined to reproduce the round tower. Governor
Bligh was very busy in 1807 completing the Church,
for on February 7, 1807, he wrote to the Right Hon.
W. Windham: “We have now all our artificers em-
ployed building the Church of Sydney, which I hope
will be completed, or nearly so, in six months.” On
Friday, 29th May, 1807, the tower was completed.
Its height was 49 feet, 6 inches, ana its diameter 12
feet. The Chancel at the west end was completed
at the same time. Governor Hunter had brought with
him from England a peal of eight small bells. Thev
had been carefully stored. Governor Bligh found
them and had them hung in the Church tower. They
were rung for the first time on Friday, 29th May, 1807.
Owing to the thickness of the walls of the tower, the
tones of the bells could not be heard distinctly beyond


the distance of 300 yards from the tower.' On 7th
June, 1807, the bells rang out a merry peal irt' honour
of the Ring’s birthday. I have already spbken of the
Rev. Mr. Marsden’s visit to England in 1807. Had
he been in the Colony Governor Bligh Would never
have been deposed, and the Church would have been
opened in 1807. Governor Bligh was deposed on
January 26, 1808. On Monday, February Bth, 1808,
there was a very noisy public meeting held in St.
Philip’s Church by the deposers of Bligh. At this
meeting resolutions were passed thanking Lieutenant
Colonel Johnston and the New South Wales Corps for
the part they had taken in the rebellion. It was also
decided to present a sword to Johnston, and a dele-
gate, in the person of John Macarthur, was selected
to go to England, “ to state to His Majesty’s Minis-
ters those grievances the inhabitants of this Colony
laboured under during the administration of 1 His Ex-
cellency Governor Bligh, and praying redreSS.” This
rebel meeting was the opening of the new Church, and
certainly would not have been held there had' the Rev.
Samuel Marsden been in the Colony.
When the Rev. William Cowper arrived on 1 the
18th August, 1809, he found that the Rev. W. P.
Crook and Major Abbott had both been conducting
services in the Church. Mr. Crook had beeh a Mis-
sionary at Tahiti. During the time that Governor
Bligh was under arrest he acted as Colonial Chaplain t
and was allowed a salary by the' Home 1 Government.
Subsequent to that, Governor MacQuarie sent for him
and told him that he would not be allowed to admin-
ister the Holy Communion, not being a Minister of the
Church of Ehgland. He persisted in doing what he
conceived to be his duty, and the Horne Government
protected him in the end. He went back to Tahiti,
and returned to Sydney in 1831. In 1832 he raised
contributions and built a small stone Chapel at Wat-
son’s Bay, and preached in it for a considerable time.
The Chapel has only been demolished during the pre-
sent year (1910).
In the Government and General Order, dated
22nd August, 1809, the appointment of the Rev. Mr.
Cowpfer as Assistant Chaplain is notified, and also
that he Would be stationed and do duty at Sydney.
In the same Order he is appointed a member of the
Committee of the Orphan School, t hat he took much
interest in the children is evident from the following
ektratt f/oih the “ Sydney Gazette”:—” On August
iOth (181 a) an examination was held in the Church
of Upwards of *2OO 'children, who were catechized by
the Minister on moral and religious subjects, in the
course ’of which many excellent maxims were laid
dowti'iri terms best 'calculated to impress the youthful
mltld with dbbcomihg sense of duty to their Creator,
attd to their'fellow-mortals.” From this it is clear
that 'both he and the Rev. Richard Johnson were im-
pressed With the fact that upon the formation of the
earty character the future course in life depends,


On January 2/th, 1810, an Order was issued that
all public-houses were in future to be shut up during
the time of Divine Service.
An Order was issued on May 19th, 1810, direct-
ing that “ the several Government working gangs
shall in future parade under their respective overseers
every Sunday at half-past nine o’clock (subsequently,
altered to ten a.m.), in the morning, in the Market
Place, clean and properly dressed in their best clothes,
in order to be marched from thence regularly to
Church.” This Order was issued because "very few
of the Government servants ever attend Divine wor-
ship on Sundays; and trusting that this neglect pro-
ceeds partly from a mistaken notion that there is not
sufficient room for all of them in the Church.” This
shows that St. Philip’s was being regularly used for
Divine Service at that time.
In June, the times of Service in the Church were
“b o’clock in the morning for the troops, and 11 in the
forenoon for the free inhabitants and convicts; the
hours for the afternoon service to continue the same
as heretofore.”
On October 6th, 1810, an Order was issued of
which the following is an extract: —“The open space
of ground, or area, whereon the Church of St. Philip
now stands, and which is hereafter intended to be
formed into a handsome square (the street hitherto
known by the name of Church Street forming the
west side thereof), has been named ” Charlotte
Square,” in honour of Her Majesty, by which name
only it is henceforth to be denominated.”
The following Government and General Order was
issued on Saturday, 22nd December, 1810:—‘‘On
Tuesday next, the 25th instant, being Christmas Day,
by Divine permission it is intended that the Church
of St. Philip, at Sydney, shall be consecrated by the
Rev. Samuel Marsden, Principal Chaplain.” ‘‘The
prisoners and others in the employment of Govern-
ment, including the ticket-of-leave men at Sydney,
will parade at the usual hour and place for Divine
Service on Christmas Day.”
Let us enter the Church during the Service. The
principal entrance is through the round embattled
tower at the eastern end. The first thing that strikes
us is the lofty pews. To the right, near the middle
of the Church, is the curiously carved reading desk
and pulpit with its sounding board. On two ends of
the building are two galleries, supported by timber
Doric columns, on the capitals of which rest similar
pillars, supporting the low roof of the building. The
gallery at the eastern end of the Church is occupied
by the scholars of the Sunday School (and in which
in later years was placed the small organ). The gal-
lery on the southern side, which faces the pulpit, is
occupied by the officers and soldiers of the 73 rd Regi-
ment, whose Band leads the singing of the Chants and
Hymns. The Chancel, which is semi-circular, consists
or a small space railed off, sufficient to contain com-


fortably the Communion Table, the cushions and
draperies of which, as of the pulpit, are of crimson
velvet. On either side of the western window are
large boards with the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer and
the Ten Commandments, surrounded by a border of
ornamented scroll-work duly painted thereon. The
windows are small, and semi-circularly arched, but
undivided by mullions, and devoid of ornament.
• The Governor and Mrs MacQuarie, with His Ex-
cellency’s Staff, the civil and military officers, and the
leading members of the commercial community,
amongst whom were Messrs. Campbell and Riley,
occupied the body of the Church. The clergy with the
churchwardens enter by the eastern door, and proceed
up the aisle to the Holy Table, repeating the 24th
Psalm as they go. The Rev. Mr. Marsden then pro-
ceeds with the Consecration Service. After that fol
lows the service of Holy Communion. There was very
little singing, only a few verses of Tate and Brady’s
metrical version of the Psalms after the Ante-Com-
munion. There is but little doubt but that the Rev.
Robert Cartwright as well as the Rev. William Cowper
took part in the Service.
Let us now look for a short time at the early life
of the Rev. William Cowper. He was born at Whit-
tington in Lancashire on the 28th December, 1780.
His father was a yeoman farmer, and his parents
were pious, though not wealthy. In his e?.rly years
he was devout and zealous in the cause of religion. In
his boyhood he was much impressed and affected by
reading the “Pilgrim’s Progress.” His father en-
couraged him in his early years to store his mind
with useful, as well as religious, knowledge. He used
every endeavour to give him an education which would
fit him for a commercial life, but his unaffected sim-
plicity and Godly sincerity clearly showed that he was
more fitted for the Church than for clerical pursuits.
About the year 1796 he was engaged as a private
tutor in a clergyman’s family at Northallerton, in
Yorkshire. It was during his residence here that
he was impressed with a desire to enter the Ministry.
On the completion of his engagement at Northallerton
he became a clerk in the Royal Engineers Department
at Hull. Here he gained the affection and regard
of Dr. Charles Hutton, by pointing out some mistakes
in a book on Mathematics which the Doctor had pub-
lished.
While at Hull, Mr. Cowper sat under the Rev.
Thomas Dykes, and under his guidance he prosecuted
his studies for the Ministry. Mr. Cowper married
while in Yorkshire. Three sons and one daughter
wer.; the issue of this marriage. Henry, the eldest,
became a surgeon, and died in the forties. The
daughter married Dr. George Brookes. The second
son, Thomas, was a grazier in the Northern districts
of this Colony, while the third son, Charles, became
famous as an Australian statesman. Mr. Cowper’s
first wife died about 1808. It was about the be-


ginning of the year 1808 that he was introduced to the.
Rev. Samuel Marsden, who had been commissioned by"
Lord Castlereagh to secure the services of two clergy-
men to act as Assistant-Chaplains in New South
Wales. The purity of his language and sentiipents
made a great impression on Mr. Marsden, who ear-
nestly solicited him to devote himself to the Church
in Australia. At this period he was residing at Dry-
pool, near Hull. Early in the year 1808 he was
ordained Deacon by the Bishop of Winchester in the
Chapel Royal at St. James’ Palace, by letters dimjs-
sory from the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Arch-
bishop having signified to the Secretary of State for
the Colonies his approval of his appointment to an
Assistant-Chaplaincy in New South Wales. He re-
ceived his Commission in the month of March, 1808.
He was to leave Hull for Portsmouth in June, 1808,
and had received £l2O for half a year’s salary. Out
of this he paid £g 3s. Bd. for his Commission, Epid
£l2 for Income Tax. During his detention in Eng-
land he was ordained Priest by the Bishop of Bristol
His first curacy was at Rawdon in Yorkshire. Mr.
Cowper was to have sailed with his family in the
“Aeolus,” in June, 1808, but through unavoidable
circumstances he was detained for some months.
Prior to his departure he was married to a lady who
proved herself a true mother to his children, and a
valuable helper to himself in his Ministry. Eventu-
ally he sailed in the "Indispensable,” and arrived .'n
Sydney on the 18th August, 1809. On Sunday, 2oth
August, he preached his first sermon in St. Philip';
Church from the text, “Do I now persuade men or
God? or do I seek to please men? For if I yet
pleased men, I should not be the servant pf Christ '
(Galatians, chap i., verse x.) The note which he
struck in that sermon characterised his Ministry
throughput his whole career. It was resppnsibility
and devotion to Christ as the Saviour of Mankind. He
was there by authority of the British Government, as
a Servant of the Crown; but with a higher commission
still from the Lord Jesus Christ, to whom he was re-
sponsible for what he taught and for the way in whicn
he sought their salvation. The Rev. Mr. Cowper was
the only clergyman in the Colony to welcome Governor
MacQuarie on his arrival on 28th December, 1809, ir.
H.M.S. “Indostan.” He took part in the ceremony
of MacQuarie assuming the Governorship on Ist Janu-
ary, 1810. He took part, also, in the establishment
of the first free school in Sydney on 24th February,
1810. He witnessed the departure of the New South
Wales Corps, and also that of the deposed Governor
Bligh. MacQuarie and Bligh in tneir despatches
speak highly of Mr. Cowper in the performance of his
Church work. Mr. Cowper was one of the founders
of most of the older charitable institutions in Sydney,
such as the Benevolent Society, the Sydney Dispen-
sary, and the Orphan Schools. In 1812 Mr. Cowper
suffered from a very severe attack of rheumatic fever,


(Tlic Urn. Ardu'ittuntt (f otaper, D.O.

which was brought on by visiting condemned prisoners
in the damp cells of the gaol. The Rev. Henry Fulton
was appointed at this time to assist Mr. Cowper at
St. Philip’s, and continued to do so until 1814.
An item appears in the Government expenditure of
August, 1814, for the payment of £2 5 to Daniel Reid,
mason, for a stone font for the Church. This font
has now found a resting place in the Western porcn
of the modem St. Philip’s.
On Sunday, August 21st, 1814, there was a great
innovation in St. Philip’s. Instead of the ordinary
Prayer Book version of the Psalms being used, a new
version by Dr. Goode was introduced. Governor
MacQuarie was present, and on the following day he
caused his Secretary to write the following letter to
Mr. Cowper:—
“ Secretary’s Office, Sydney,
“22nd August, 1814.
“Revd. Sir,
“I am directed by His Excellency the Gover-
nor to inform you that in the celebration of the Churcn
Service yesterday at St. Philip’s, Sydney, he was
much surprised to observe that the regular and legally
established version of the Psalms was omitted and in
their stead others from a new version by Dr. Goode
were sung.
“His Excellency alike from duty and inclination
to preserve uniformity and consistency with the legally
established Rules and Ceremonies of the Church of
England, with which any unauthorized version of the
Psalms must militate, desires to be informed by you.
in writing, by what authority you have acted in thus
venturing to depart from the old-established cere-
monies of the Church, and unless in this communica-
tion you shall be enabled to shew that this new version
of the Psalms by Dr. Goode is ordered to be sung
in Churches by the authority of the Supreme Head ot
that Church, it is His Excellency’s desire that you
shall not in future use it in the public celebration of
Divine Service, such innovation being neither justifi-
able by necessity nor by that obedience to the religious
establishment of this Colony, which it is alike, his and
your duty to uphold.
“ I have the honour to be,
“Revd. Sir,
“Your obedient Hon. Servant,
“JNO. THOS. CAMPBELL,
“Secretary.
“ Rev. William Cowper,
“Assistant Chaplain,
“Sydney.”
Not content with this, the Governor wrote a
lengthy despatch—too lengthy to reproduce—to the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the subject,
in which he states that Mr. Marsden “either imported
(with other Books on his own account) or received
from a Missionary Society, a number of copies of Dr.
Goode’s version of the Psalms,” ffe then goes op


to state, “ t have deemed it my duty to prohibit this
version or any other than that attached to the Bible
and Prayer Book of the Church of England from being
any longer used, until such time as reference could
be made to the Supreme Authority of our Church and
the commands of H.R.H. the Prince Regent should oe
communicated to me.” And now the Governor shows
his feeling towards Mr. Marsden:—“My apprehension
of the consequences which might attend the submit-
ting to, or in any degree sanctioning changes of this
kind, are not a little heightened by the consideration
that Mr. Marsden and some of the Assistant-Chaplains
are originally of low rank and not qualified by liberal
education in the usual way for the Sacred functions
entrusted to them, and are also much tinctured with
Methodistical or other sectarian principles, which dis-
pose them to a hasty adoption of new svstem<=, or at
least of new forms, to the exclusion of the old estab
lishments ot the Church of England.”
It is needless to say that no more was heard of
Dr. Goode’s version of the Psalms in St. Philip s
Church.
In the accounts of the Trustees of the Police
Fund, dated 31st December, 1817, we find the follow-
ing entry:—
“For performance of Church Music in Church at
Sydney, £3 10s. od.”
Again, on 30th June, 1818, Sergeant Parsons re-
ceived £5 ss. od. “ For Musicians v performance of
Sacred Music in St. Philip’s Church, Sydney.* ’ What
these performances were we do not know, whether in
the matter of assisting at the ordinary Services, or
of the nature of a special performance of Sacred Music
by the Military Band. A few years later the Church-
wardens procured instruments for the use of the choir,
as the following quaint request shows:—“The Clerk of
St. Philip’s respectfully requests instructions from the
Churchwardens in reference to the disposal of an old
Bassoon, Clarionet, and Flute, purchased by direction
of Archdeacon Scott about ten years ago for the use
of the Choir.
“These instruments, after about seven years’ ser-
vice, and having been repeatedly repaired at the ex-
pense of the Clerk, were laid aside about three years
ago, and have not since been used.
6th August, 1838.”
One can hardly imagine what the Musical Services
in Old St. Philip’s were like. They certainly appear
to have been much in advance of the modern St.
Philip’s.
The ship “Guildford” arrived on April Ist, 1818,
and brought the sad news of the death of the Prin-
cess Charlotte of Wales. The Princess Charlotte
Augusta, was the daughter of H.R.H. the Prince
Regent, and Consort of His Serene Highness Prince
Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. She died in child-birth on
November 6th, 1817.


. / , / ■ < •


On April 2nd, twenty-two minute guns were fired
from Dawes’ Battery, in commemoration of the years
which the Princess had nearly completed. The Royal
Standard was hoisted at half-mast at Fort Phillip, and
the Union Jack at Dawes’ Battery, each day from the
2nd April until the 6th, from sunrise until sunset. The
bells of St. Philip’s were tolled for an hour at sunrise,
and an hour at sunset, on those days. On the Sunday
everyone was directed to put on mourning.
The Governor directed all the Civil and Military-
Officers to assemble at Government House on Sunday,
sth April, at ten o’clock, in appropriate mourning, to
proceed thence with His Excellency to St. Philip’s
Church, “there to humble themselves before the
Throne of Divine Mercy on this sad and afflicting
event.’’ In compliance with the Governor’s Order
the Civil and Military. Officers assembled at Govern-
ment House on the Sunday morning, and accompanied
His Excellency to St. Philip’s Church, where an affect
ing and most impressive sermon was preached by the
Rev. Mr. Cowper. The procession moved from Gov-
ernment House at half past ten, and passed through
a lane formed by the 48th Regiment, extending from
Government iiouse to the Church. The Colours of
the Regiment were dipped as the procession passed.
A Hymn and an Anthem were introduced into the
Service, and the report says: “these, from their very
appropriate selection, tended considerably to heighten
the general feeling.’’


The Church was draped with black cloth on the
occasion at a cost of £g qs. od.
One might tell of many other similar Services in
the old Church, such as, for instance, that for the
Queen, who died on November 17th, 1818, and for
whom the bells of St. Philip’s were tolled twice daily
from the 19th to the 27th June, 1819, and a similar
Service to that for the Princess Charlotte was held
on the Sunday.
The Rev. Richard Hill arrived in Sydney on June
18th, 1819, by the “Hibernia,” and was stationed at
Sydney, to assist Mr. Cowper at St. Philip’s.
I do not think it is generally known that the Rev.
Mr. Cowper laid the foundation stone of Christ
Church, Newcastle, by direction of Governor Mac-
Quarie, in 1817.
St. Philip’s Parsonage, in Gresham Street, was
completed in 1819, but Mr. Cowper was not satis-
fied with it, and consequently alterations and additions
were made to it a further cost of After his
removal from the Rev. Richard Johnson’s Parsonage
in 1810, Mr. Cowper lived in the building which after-
wards became Mrs. Purcell’s Custom House Hotel, in
Macquarie Place, and moved into the Gresham Street
Parsonage towards the end of 1819.
The Porch on the Northern Side of the Church
was built by Major Druitt in 1821, and the vestry and
school-room at the back of the Church were erected
in 1829. Mr. Commissioner Bigge arrived in the
Colony on September 25th, 1819, and from his Report,
we learn some interesting facts. The convicts were
mustered at the door of the Church, and occupied the
whole length of the Southern Gallery. Mr. Bigge
informs us that “ When the Church is completed that
is now building in Hyde Park, the attendance of all
the convicts at a place of public worship may be easily
provided, both on Sundays and on two or three more
evenings of the week.” This gives us the reason
why it became necessary to build St. James’ Church.
The foundation stone of the building which event-
ually became St. James’ Church was laid on October
7th, 1819. I say “eventually,” because the building
was orginally intended for a Court-House. On Sun-
day, January 6th, 1822, Divine Service was performed
in it for the first time, and the Rev. Richard Hill sev-
ered his connection with St. Philip’s. St. James’
Church was consecrated on February 11th, 1824, bv
the Rev. Samuel Marsden. Mr. Hill died suddenly
in St. James’ Church on May 30, 1836. The first
Evening Service was held in St. Philip’s Church on
April 29th, 1821, and the first Sunday School Anni-
versary in the same year. On November 7th, 1830,
the Church was draped in black, and a special sermon
preached as a tribute of respect for His Majesty
George IV.
The Anniversaries of tne foundation of the Colony
were never forgotten at St. Philip’s. Archdeacon
Broughton preached in St. Philip’s on Sunday, Janu-


the foundation of the Colony. The subject of his
ary 26th, 1834, being the forty-sixth anniversary of
sermon was “Religion, essential to the security and
happiness of nations.” The text was taken.from
Deut. iv. 39-40.
I should like to reproduce the greater part of the
sermon, as it is specially appropriate in the present
day, but must content myself with the quotation al-
ready given, when reference was made to the Bible
and Prayer Book.
An important meeting was held on September
18th, 1840, for the purpose of forming St. Philip’;
Parochial Association. The objects of the Associa-
tion were, “ to provide pecuniary assistance towards
the maintenance of education and religion generally
in this Colony, and especially in this Parish, in con-
formity with the doctrines and formularies of the
Church of England.” We shall see, as we proceed,
the great influence this Association had in the pro-
motion of education in the Parish, and the important
part it took in the erection of the new Church. The
meeting was presided over by the Bishop of Australia.
Bishop Broughton was a man of vigorous intellect, un-
compromising views, unswerving integrity, and unre-
laxing energy. As Archdeacon, he was the first
minister of the Gospel in Australia who tried to serve
the aborigines. He it was who established a mis-
sion to them. During his visit to England he was
Consecrated by Archbishop Howley, on February 14th,
1836, and returned to Sydney with the title and auth-
ority of Bishop of Australia. Anxious for counsel
from the Episcopal bench in England, he went home
in 1852, and died in 1853. He was buried in Canter-
bury Cathedral. Honest, brave and good, he must
be honoured, he will be honoured, in the.religious an-
nals of the Australian Colonies. One of the first acts
of the Parochial Association was to enclose the vacant
ground attached to the Church and School-house, both
for the protection of the buildings, and : for the pur-
pose of keeping the school children more under
control.
In 1840 the Rev. John Elder was curate of St.
Philip’s.
Another old identity appeared on the scene at
this time—Mr. Edward Macßoberts, who was Parish
Clerk of the Old Church, and had been master of the
Infant School for many years. He contributed no less
a sum than £137 towards the erection of the present
Church, and was always foremost in any good work
connected with the Parish. His wife was the first
organist of whom we have any record, £nd her con-
nection with the old instrument dates back to 1840.
Speaking of the organ, I have not, as yet, been able
to find out when it was placed in the Church. But
this we do know, that it required three persons to
play it. They were the organist, the bellows-blower,
and the stop drawer. In 1840 Mrs. Mcßoberts, the
wife of the Cl er k, was organist; the bellows-blpwer


was James Mcßoberts, son of the Clerk; and James
H. Greenway was the stop drawer. Mrs. Mcßob-
erts received £2O per annum, James Mcßoberts £\
16s. od., and James H. Greenway £l. Mr. Edward
Mcßoberts received for his services as Parish Clerk
the remuneration of £26 14s. od. per annum. The
other offices of the Church at this time were the sex-
ton, Francis Abel, who received £l3 17s. od. per an-
num; the beadle, Joshua Allott, £\J Bs. od.; the bell
ringer and church cleaner, James Winters, £26 14s
od.; and the grave-digger, John Furey, £6 10s. od.
At that time there were no less than fourteen paid
members of the choir.
In 1844, Sarah Jane Uhr was appointed organist.
In August of the same year John Deane was appointed
organist at a salary of £so per annum. Messrs. John-
son and Kinloch received the sum ot £4 4s. od. per
annum for tuning the organ.
In 1844 the organ does not appear to have given
satisfaction, and Mr. W. J. Johnson sent in alternative
tenders for erecting a new instrument either in the
gallery or in the body of the Church, but the old organ
was patched up, and continued to do service until the
new Church was opened.
The clock and bells were also a cause of much
anxiety. The clock was always out of order, for we
find in 1843 that Mr. W. H. Beaumont states that
“The clock of St. Philip’s Church being again out
9f repair, I beg to state that I will undertake to do
the necessary repairs of the clock for the sum of Five
Pounds.” The case was also to be repaired at a
cost of Six to Eight Pounds, and he was to wind it
for a further sum of Five Pounds per annum.
In 1845 the Church had to be re-shingled, and a
new floor put in. Indeed, it was rapidly falling into
a state of decay. The story of the introduction of
gas into St. Philip’s is interesting. The Gas Works
in Kent Street were completed on May 24th, 1841,
and the event was celebrated by an illumination on
Church Hill. St. Philip’s Church was the first Church
in Australia to use that illuminant, as, before the end
of June, 1841, there was an installation of 26 Argand
burners in the Church. The cost of the gas was
255. per 1000 feet, and the account for the first
quarter was £6 ss. od. The cost of the installation
was £l4 17s. od. The light given was not satis-
factory, and in the next quarter a further expenditure
of £s} iqs. Bd. was incurred for extra fittings. This
led the Churchwardens into difficulties, for the bill de-
livered on December 31st, 1841, amounted to no less
than 16s. Bd. By the 31st March, 1842, this
was increased to £qo 6s. Bd. As this amount was
not forthcoming, the matter was placed in the hands
of Mr. D. Poole, Solicitor to the Company, and it was
paid to him on October 6th, 1842.
The first Evening Service was held on the sth
March, 1840, when Bishop Broughton preached. In
1841, the Rev. T. B. Naylor was Acting Curate at
St. Philip’s.


tn February, 1842, the Rev. Mr. Cowper left tor
England for the purpose of having an operation per-
formed on his eyes. At a meeting of the members
of the congregation held on February 23rd, 1842, the
following resolution, which shows the esteem in which
Mr. Cowper was held by his parishioners, was passed.
—“ That this meeting records the deep sense of the
loss they have sustained by the departure for England
of their much-respected Incumbent, the Rev. Mr.
Cowper. For more than thirty years, he was the
zealous Minister of this Parish, and the warm sup-
porter and friend of every religious and charitable
society, of every society which aimed to promote the
Glory of God and the welfare of man. This meeting
feels assured that he still remembers them in his
prayers, and sincerely hopes that by the blessing of
God upon the operation to which he is about to sub-
mit, his eyesight may be restored, and that he may
soon return to aid them by his counsels and exer-
tions.”
During his absence the Rev. J. C. Grylls acted
as locum tenens. He entered upon his duties on
March 10th, 1842.
The new School-house in Harrington Street was
opened in November, 1842, when Mr. Barton was
appointed master-in-charge. The girls’ and infants’
schools were removed to it. The room in which the
primary school had been held was greatly enlarged,
and a portion of that which had been occupied by
the infants was converted into a vestrv. At this
time there were 380 children attending the school.
There are many interesting accounts of the
gatherings of ihe Sunday School children for services
in St. James’ Church, and for refreshments afterwards
in the Old Court House. At the one held on Trinity
Sunday, 1843, there were 312 children present from
St. Philip’s.
In August, 1843, Mr. Cowper returned from Eng-
land with his eyesight restored. Prior to his return
the Archbishop of Canterbury conferred upon him the
honorary degree of D.D. as a mark of appreciation ot
the long and faithful services which he had rendered
to the Church in Australia. In January, 1845, the
Archdeaconry of Cumberland was created, and Dr.
Cowper was collated to be the first Archdeacon. After
the return of Dr. Cowper, Mr. Grylls officiated in the
Harrington Street Schoolroom, morning and evening.
He had been appointed to Holy Trinity Parish. The
foundation stone of Holy Trinity Church had been laid
on June 23rd, 1840, and was then in such a state
of progress that it was thought it would soon be avail-
able for the celebration of Divine Service. During
the year 1843 St. Philip’s Parochial Library was
formed, and it was opened on August 27th, 1844. On
August 23rd, 1844, an important meeting was held
in the Schoolroom, to consider what measures it might
be advisable to adopt for the maintenance of the
School connected with the Church of England in the


Parish. It had been decided by tbe Legislative Coun-
cil, by a majority of one, that thefe must not be
any prayer, nor any catechetical instruction, nor the
reading of the Holy Scriptures in the School at any
time. A Petition was signed for the support of de-
nominational education.
The Parish was now burdened with the heavy
debt of £l4OO on the new Harrington Street Schools.
.Vith a view to lessen this amount the Churchwardens
received contributions at the doors of the Church
after each service on the Sundays.
In September, 1845, the Rev. John Elder severed
his connection with the Parish as Assistant-Minister,
he having been appointed to a parish in the interior.
In January, 1845, an Evening School was opened
for young men, with very gratifying results. The
average attendance was twenty-five.
At the suggestion of Dr. Cowper in 1845, several
members of the Parochial Association undertook the
laborious task of visiting the dwellings of th£ parish-
ioners attached to the Church of England, with a view
to ascertain the number of persons who might require
Church accommodation. On this matter they re-
ported that “ Notwithstanding there are three Ser-
vices in the Church on each Lord’s Day, and one every
Thursdav evening, still, several hundreds of the
parishioners, if disposed to attend, must unavoidably
be without any accommodation in their own Parish
Church: —Whence, there appears to be a necessity
for some arrangement to be made as early as practi-
cable, for a new and more commodious Church. This,
indeed, would be a work of years, and, as in the
meantime, the population may considerablv increase,
there seems to be an urgent cause for some plan to
be adopted without delay.” On January 2nd, 1846,
the Rev. Dr. Cowper placed in the hands of trustees
the sum of £5OO towards the erection of a new
Church.
An important meeting was held in the Harring-
ton Street Schoolroom on November 24th, 1846 —the
Bishop of Australia in the chair—when the follow-
ing resolution was carried:—“ That tne site and state
of the present Church of St. Philip’s, and the very
inadequate accommodation which it affords for the
members of the Church of England in this Parish,
render it necessary to adopt measures whereby a new
and more commodious Church may be erected as
speedily as circumstances will permit.”
In 1847 it was ordered oy His Excellency the Gov-
ernor and the Executive Council, that the site for the
new Church and School be upon the most desirable
part of the Church Hill, bounded by three streets, viz..
—Un the East by the continuation of York Street, to-
wards Cumberland Street; on the South by the con-
tinuation of Jamieson Street, towards Clarence
Street; on the West by the continuation of Clarence
Street, towards Princes Street; and on the North by
a line from East to West at the distance of 160 feet


from Jamieson Street. The Rev. J. C. Grylls retired
from the position of evening lecturer in September,
1847, and on October Ist, 1847, the Rev. R. L. King,
8.A., was appointed as Curate. When the site of
the new Church was examined, previous to the exca-
vations necessary for laying the foundation, it was
discovered that the surface (and in many parts to the
depth of four feet) was composed of lavers of ruo-
bish, which had by degrees accumulated. It was
therefore deemed necessary to remove the whole sur-
face, and to lower the site to the level of the south-
east corner. The site had previously been occupied
by the house in which Captain Rossi lived when he first
arrived in the Colony, and, in clearing away the rub-
bish before mentioned, the doorstone of his house was
found at some depth beneath the surface. The old
well from which the builders obtained the water still
exists. When the rubbish had been removed, the
rock appeared in almost every part. But upon closer
examination it was found that in many places it con-
sisted of thin layers, with soft clay between. It was
therefore necessary to dig through these layers, that
the foundation might rest in every part on the solid
rock. The first contract entered into was in De-
cember, 1847, and was for the fencing of the ground.
The second, commenced in March, 1848, was for the
excavation of the site to a level with the proposed
alteration in the street on the west side. By the
third contract, commenced in April, 1848, and com-
pleted in May, 1849, the foundation was laid, and the
walls carried to the height of twelve feet above the
ground. The foundation stone was laid on Monday,
May Ist, 1848, being St. Philip’s and St. James’ Day.
Divine Service was first held in the old Church. After
the Service the congregation proceeded to the ground,
where after a short preliminary Service, the Bishop,
who, it had been announced, would lay the Founda-
tion Stone, requested Arcndeacon Cowper to have the
goodness to perform the dutv. The Archdeacon, after
a short address, then laid the Foundation Stone at
the north-eastern corner of the Chancel, saying, “I
lay this as the foundation and corner stone of a
Church, to be built in this place, to be named St.
Philip’s Church; and to be set apart for the preaching
of the right Catholic faith, which we believe and con-
fess, in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Ghost. Amen.” After prayers had been
offered, the Bishop pronounced the benediction.
By the fourth contract, commenced in May, 1849,
the wall of the south aisle was finished, and by the
fifth, the wall of the north aisle was completed by
May, 1850. In June, 1850, the sixth contract was
entered into for the whole of the pillars on each side
of the nave. In consequence of the strong tempta-
tion which the gold diggings exhibited to the masons,
the work was discontinued for a time in 1851.
In 1850 the new School which forms the back of
the Central portion of the School buildings was com-


pleted, and brought into use. In May of the same
year a loan of £2OO. on the personal security of Mr.
John Campbell and Mr. Mitchell, was obtained from
Lowe and Stephen at ten per cent, interest, towards
the cost of erecting this School. The Commercial
School, which had been managed by Mr. George Tay-
lor, was transferred by him to the Rev. R. L. King,
with the new designation of St. Philip’s Grammar
School. It was opened by Mr. King on the Ist Octo-
ber, assisted bv Mr. J. J. bavies.
In 1851 Mr. Fairman was appointed Master of
the Infant School. In 1852 the work of the new
Church was proceeding in a satisfactory manner.
In 1854 the walls of the Church were ready to re-
ceive the roof. By the end of 1855 it was so far com-
pleted that as soon as the glass for the large eastern
window and that for the small clerestory windows ar-
rived, the Church would be ready for Consecration.
In 1856 the kev. John Allmann Burke, 8.A., and Mr.
Horace Sendall arrived from England, and took up
the work of the Grammar School. The number of
scholars at that time was 46.
In July, 1855, the Rev. G. W. Richardson was ap-
pointed to succeed the Rev. R. L. King, as Curate,
on Mr. King’s promotion to the Incumbency of St.
John’s, Parramatta, and continued to hold that office
until the end of July, 1858.
In spite of the many difficulties the Churchwar-
dens and Trustees had to contend with, they suC-
ceeded, by March, 1856, in completing <he building
to a sufficient extent that it could be used; the only
part remaining to be added was the to\/er. Up to
this time the cost had been upwards of /12,000. The
total cost was about .£16,000, and the whole of that
sum was raised by voluntary contribr tions from the
congregation, and their friends. The Church was
designed by Mr. E. T. Blacket, architect, of this city.
On March 27th, 1856, Bishop Barker consecrated
the Church. The Bishop, accompanied by his chap-
lains, the Rev. Mr. Allwood and the Rev. Mr. Synge,
entered the building at the western entrance, where
he was received by the Venerable Archdeacon of Cum-
berland, who acted as Chancellor, and Mr. H. K.
James, the Registrar; the Trustees, Messrs. John
Campbell, J. K. Ingelow, and J. A. Matthews; the
Churchwardens, Messrs. J. H. Thorne and H. Allan,
and a number of the clergy:
After the Consecration Service, the Bishop
preached from 2 Chron., chap, v., verses 13-14. The
collection amounted to £217 is. iod.
The organ was not completed until October, 1856.
Until that time an harmonium was used, the first or-
ganist being Mr. E. H. Cobley.
The organ occupied the gallery at the western end
of the Church. At the time of the opening of the
new Church there was a Parochial Library of 1200
volumes. On June Bth, 1857, a meeting was held,
presided over by the Bishop, at which instructions




were given to Mr. Dean to sell the materials of the
old Church, and certain of the fixtures, within a week.
The pulpit, reading desk, and font were given to S‘.
Luke’s Church, a site for which had been selected i i
Sussex Street. The body of Captain Putland, of
H.M.S. “ rorpoise,” which had been interred in the
vault, was removed to Camperdown Cemetery. The
Bible and Prayer Book, which were brought out in
the First Fleet, and the Communion Service, which
was presented to the Church by His Majesty King
George 111., were, of course, removed to the new
Church, where they are still occasionally used, and
very carefully preserved. The site of old St. Philip s
was agreed to be surrendered to the Crown in con-
sideration of the grant of the new site. Archdeacon
Cowper made a determined effort to have the site kept
as an open space. At that time there were per-
sistent efforts by others to obtain the site. The Ro-
man Catholics alleged that they had a promise from
Sir George Gipps of a position of the site when the
old Church should be removed, but they could not pro-
duce any evidence of such a promise. A portion of
the site was offered to and accepted by the Bible
Society for the erection of a hall. After the congre-
gation of St. Philip’s had removed to the new Church,
the congregation of Holy Trinity Church was allowed
to occupy the old one temporarily for public worship,
pending the completion of their own Lhurch. Event-
ually it was decided that, after the removal of the
materials of the old Church, the site should be
as a Reserve for public recreation, to be granted tc
Trustees in the manner provided for in the Act of
1854. Unfortunately, the City Council made use of
that portion of the Reserve, on whicn the old Churca
stood, as an Electric Lighting Station.
Archdeacon Cowper was permitted to realise his
long cherished desire of proclaiming the Gospel in the
new Church. His first sermon was preached in it on
Sunday, March 30th, 1856, and his last on Sunday.
April 25th, 1858. He died on July 6th, 1858, and
was accorded a public funeral.
Dr. Cowper’s character was one which would
bear the most careful and scrutinizing examination.
Its greatest beauty, perhaps, was its remarkable con-
sistency, throughout so long a period. A high sense
of duty, a clear and resolute purpose to do that which
he believed to be right, cool judgment and justice in
weighing the consequences of actions and events’
these and other great qualities gave great weight to
his observations and decisions, and made him a valu-
able counsellor to those who had to seek advice at
his hands. As a preacher he was bold, faithful and
uncompromising, in rebuking the vices and errors of
the day; and in setting forth that Gospel which he
had found to be the means of salvation to himself,
and in the light of which he had walked for more than
fifty years. As a pastor he was affectionate, sym
pathizing and tender. Often a sufferer, he knew


Interior |Jl)tltp’s Cljmxlj before reuobafiou bISSb). Christinas.


how to feel for others, and to apply the consolations
of the Gospel to their hearts. A tew weeks before
his death the last stone was placed on the Tower,
and on the day of his funeral the bells, which had
been presented by the Hon. John Campbell, for the
first time, gave forth, in measured and solemn tones,
the Knell of Death.
The new Parsonage was completed in 1858 at
a cost of about £3774, including the amount paid for
the land. During the passage of the St. Philip’s
Parsonage Bill through Parliament (a Bill for the
sale, exchange or disposal otherwise, subject to cer-
tain conditions, of the old Parsonage), a Petition
emanating from certain persons residing in Holy
Trinity Parish, praying that a considerable portion of
the funds which might be derived from the sale of
the St. Philip’s Parsonage property might be trans-
ferred to Holy Trinity Parish. Dean Cowper sent
in a counter Petition, with the result that the Bill
passed both Houses, without amendment. The old
Parsonage and land were sold on March 10th, 1859-
The Bishop now offered tTYe vacant position to the
Rev. William MacQuarie Cowper. He preached in
the Church for the first time, as Incumbent, on Aug-
ust Ist, 1858. The Bishop also conferred upon him
the office of Dean and Archdeacon of Sydney, the
duties of the former to commence as soon as the
Cathedral was completed, those of the latter at once.
His first sermon in the Colony was preached in St.
Philip’s Church on February 21st, 1836. The Rev.
John Steele was Curate from November 28th, 1858,
to October 6th, 1859. In 1862 Bishop Barker went
to England and deputed Mr. Cowper to take charge
of the Diocese during his absence. The Rev. Thomas
O’Reilly had entered upon his duties as Curate on
January 6th, 1861, and, in order to enable Mr. Cow-
per to give more time to the work of the Diocese, thi
Bishop appointed the Rev. E. M. Saliniere as an ad-
ditional Curate. These two gentlemen remained ac
St. Philip’s until Easter, 1864. After Easter the
Rev. G. A. C. Innes was appointed Curate, and con-
tinued to hold office until the end of the year. In
January, 1866, the Rev. W. J. Gunther, M.A., en-
tered on his duties as Curate, and continued to hold
office until January, 1868, when he became Incumbent
of St. John’s, Parramatta. He was succeeded ;n
March, 1868, by the Rev. Joseph Dark, who only
remained until the end of February, 1869.
On July 1 st, 1869, the Rev. Mr. Cowper resigned
the Incumbency of St. Philip’s. We all know how
faithfully he walked in the footsteps of his father,
and how consistently he followed the noble example
set before him. He was succeeded by the Rev.
Thomas O’Reilly on July Ist, 1869.
From the time of its completion the Church was
badly lighted. In 1869 new designs were furnished,
and seven light standards without globes were sub-
stituted for the old two light ones, at a cost of £133.


On January Ist, 1870, the large new Schoolroom
for Infants was completed, and it was used on that
day as a Sunday School for the first time; the Mas-
ter’s residence was occupied a few weeks earlier.
The old buildings in Harrington Street were then
sold.
On April ist, 1870, the Oxford Edition of Mer-
cer’s Hymn Book was introduced.
On May ist, 1870, Mr. Cobley resigned his
position as organist, and was succeeded by Mr. W.
H. Palmer.
In 1870 efforts were made to recover the Regis-
ters of Births, Marriages and Deaths belonging to
St. Philip’s Parish. These had been placed in the hands
of the Bishop’s Registrar, by the Rev. William Cow-
per, in 1839, for safe keeping prior to his departure for
Europe. Eventually they passed into the hands of
Mr. Kerrison James. They comprised Registers from
1787 to 1839. Those from 1826-1839 were recov-
ered in 1871, the earlier volumes were secured by
the Government, and are now in the Registrar-Gen-
eral’s Department.
In June, 1872, an order was sent to Walker and
Sons for a new organ for the Church. On August
17, 1872, the beautiful little School organ was played
for the first time, the Children of the School having
collected the amount required for its purchase.
In July, 1873, the block of land adjoining the
Parsonage was purchased for the purpose of erecting
an addition to the Parsonage. The new organ for
the Church arrived in January, 1874. Its cost was
£BB5. It was played at Evening Service on Thurs-
day, 26th February, 1874, for the first time. The
old organ was sold to Mr. Betts, of Goulburn, for
£lOO. The Organ Chamber was erected at a cost,
of £4BO.
In October, 1871, the news of the murder of
Bishop Patteson was received, together with that of
Stephen Taroaniara, a youth supported by the chil-
dren of the Sunday School. The children resolved
that for the future the School offering towards the
Melanesian Mission should be £3O per annum, instead
of £2O as heretofore.
In 1875 the addition to the Parsonage was com-
pleted at a cost of about £lB5O.
In February, 1870, Canon O’Reilly’s health broke
down and he was granted leave of absence for twelve
months for the purpose of taking a trip to England.
His locum tenens was the Rev. W. J. K. Piddington.
The Canon returned, a mere shadow of his former
self. In June, 1880, the Rev. R. Nelson Howard
was appointed Curate, and he filled that position until
June, 1881, when the Rev. Thomas Harrison suc-
ceeded him. The Rev. J. D. Langley relieved Canon
O’Reilly from December 18th, 1880, until February
3rd, 1881.
Canon O’Reilly died at Parramatta on Sunday,
18th December, 1881. His last sermon was preached

in the Church on the evening of Thursday, Septem-
ber 2Qth, from the text, “He hath done all things
well.” During his last illness, the Rev. W. Bryan-
Brown occupied the pulpit, and during the vacancy in
the parish the duties were performed by the Rev.
Thomas Holme.
Canon O’Reilly was a large hearted man; earnest
in whatever he undertook, and communicating the
earnestness to others by force of language and ex-
ample. In St. Philip’s Parish his influence was felt
not only in the workshops of the men, but of the
women also, and there are many still alive who can
testify how much brighter and happier the working
hours became when they learned that everything
was to be done “as unto the Lord.” His preaching
was very powerful; he had a good delivery, a cleai
voice, and a heart full of love for souls. There was
no sparing of sin, no glossing of it over; it was pre-
sented by him in all its deformity, but never without
pointing to the way of escape, the refuge from it
in Jesus. He was a bold preacher, fearlessly de-
claring the truth, without respect of person. To
some he gave offence by his outspoken denunciations
against the Liquor traffic, and those engaged in it.
He was truly in style a Boanerges, neither fearing
the frown, nor courting the favour of any; a brave
champion for Gospel truth, and a powerful advocate
in the cause of temperance—a man, moreover, highly
esteemed by all who really knew him, whose great
and sympathizing heart went out to others in the ful-
ness of Christian love. It was in the sick chamber,
however, where his character, as a Minister ot
Christ was most appreciated. He led the poor
sufferer straight to Jesus; direct communication to
the Saviour was not hindered by those aids to devo-
tion some at the present time think necessary; his
whole soul would have revolted against these new
ideas which are creeping into the Church of England.
The Rev. J. D. Langley was nominated and ap-
pointed Incumbent on February Ist and entered upon
his duties on March 11th, 1882. On May Ist, 1882,
the Rev. Robert McKeown accepted the office of
Curate.
In 1882 there was an overdraft of over
at the Bank of New South Wales, caused by the
erection of the addition to the Parsonage. By Eas-
ter, 1884, this debt had been liquidated; the Trustees
of St. Philip’s Glebe granting the. sum of £829 14s.
6d. towards the debt on the Parsonage, a Sale of
Work realizing over £2OO, and from collections and
donations, further sums were forthcoming, which
enabled the Churchwardens to bring forward a bal-
ance sheet showing a credit balance of over £ 5O.
In April, 1883, the Hymnal Companion was
introduced.
Mr. McKeown resigned at the end of September
1883. The following is a list of the Curates who
have held office in the Church since that time:—The


Revs. J. M. MacMillan, John O’Conor, J. Howell ibicc,
W. A. Charlton, W. E. H. Percival, J. Olley, P. Need-
ham Hunter, George Moore, C. Swatridge, E. W.
Doyle, J. W. Gillett, F. Kellett, P. Presswell, J. G.
Fenton, Godfrey H. Smith, R. B. Hammond, H. R.
Holmes, H. Woodger, H. T. Langley, W. Newby-
Fraser, and R. L. Houston.
In 1869 the land fronting Clarence Street, at the
rear of the Parsonage, was purchased at a cost of
£761. In 1884 a Bill was passed through Parlia-
ment, giving the Trustees power to lease the land
on a building lease. In 1885 the land was leased
for the sum of £l5O per annum.
In February, 1887, Mr. William Scoles resigned
the office of Verger, which he had held for over thirty
years.
In 1888 a new bell was added to the peal in
commemoration of the Centenary of the Colony. An-
other bell was added at a later period in memory ol
the Hon. Charles Moore.
At Easter, 1890, a team of Victorian Ringers
paid a visit to St. Philip’s Belfry. On Wednesday,
April 9th, 1890, they succeeded in ringing “Holt’s
ten part peal of Grandsire Triples” of 5040 changes.
A start was made at eleven o’clock, and at fifteen
minutes past two thev had completed their task.
In 1890 great alterations were made in the in-
terior of the Church. A new reredos was erected,
the seats were modernized, the chancel and aisles
were tiled, the gallery at the western end of the
Church was abolished and replaced with a dwarfed
screen, and a new reading desk and pulpit were
erected. The Church was re-opened, after the alter-
ations, on June Bth, 1890. On September 30th
1900, the Centenary of the laying of the foundation
stone of the older St. Philip’s Church was celebrated.
His Grace the Archbishop of Sydney preached in the
morning, and Archdeacon Gunther at the evening
service.
In 1893 the Trustees restored the tower, making
it correspond as nearly as practicable with the
original design. Unfortunately, on August 19th, one
of the workmen, George Kinder, was killed by a fall
from the tower. On April 9th, 1895, Mr. Langley
was appointed Archdeacon of Cumberland.
In 1900, the Trustees determined to build a new
Rectory in the grounds of the Church, and to lease
the old one. On October sth, 1901, the Archdeacon
and his family took possession of the new residence.
On January 3rd, 1902, Dean Cowper paid a visit to
the new Rectory: “He gave the greeting of ‘Peace’
to the household there, and before leaving gathered
them around him in prayer for a blessing upon the
‘home and on the Diocese.’ He greatly enjoyed the
revival of old memories; it was the last time he went
beyond his own doors.’’
On March 25, 1906, special services were held
in the Church to commemorate the jubilee of its Con-


secration, which actually eventuated on March 27th,
1856. Bishop Stretch preached at both the Morning
and Evening Services. The Bible and Prayer Book
which were brought out by the Rev. Richard Johnson
in the First Fleet, were used on the occasion, as well
as the Communion Service which was presented to
the Church by His Majesty King George 111. The
new Communion Table of solid oak, provided by the
Trustees was unveiled and used for the first time,
as a Memorial of the jubilee.
On Sunday, 12th August, 1006, Memorial Ser-
vices were held in the Church for the late Bishop
Langley, the Rev. Canon Archdall preaching in the
morning and the Rev. Canon Jones in the evening.
The Ven. Archdeacon Langley, having been appointed
to the vacant Bishopric of Bendigo, resigned his posi-
tion as Rector of St. Philip’s, after a ministry ot
twenty-five years. He was consecrated Bishop of
Bendigo on the 25th January, 1907. A farewell
gathering of the friends of Bishop Langlev was held
in the Chapter House on the 26th February, presided
over by the Archbishop.
The new Rector, the Rev. A. E. Bellingham,
M.A., was inducted by the Archbishop of Sydney on
the Ist August, 1907.
Shortened evening prayer was read by the Acting
Rector, the Rev. H. T. Langley; the lessons by Canon
Hough and Canon Jones. The Archbishop preached
a sermon on the Scriptures read at the Service, and
expressed his jov at the continuance of a Gospel
Ministry at St. Philip’s, urging his hearers to prayer
and earnest co-operation with their new minister in
the work of God. Then followed the induction ac-
cording to the prescribed form. The new Rector
first stood before the Communion rails, while Dr
Houison read the licence, and afterwards knelt
there while the closing prayers and benediction were
read by the Archbishop.
After the Service a reception was held in the
School-hall, which proved to be far too small for the
gathering.
His first sermon was preached in the Church on
Sunday evening, the 4th August. The Rev. H. T.
Langley, who had been Acting Rector of St. Philip’s,
preached his farewell sermons on the 24th November,
he having been appointed Rector of St. James’ Church,
Traralgon, in the Diocese of Gippsland.
There are manv other points of interest in the
history of our Church, but space will not permit of
reference being made to them.
We are grateful to remember the past, bearing m
mind, as I have shown, that St. Philip’s Church is
literally founded upon a rock, and “set apart for
the preaching of the right Catholic Faith”; we look
hopefully to the future. Much prayer has been
offered, and the anticipations of many are that large
and lasting benefits to the Church of Christ, and the


present Interior, fJbiUp's Clnu'rij.


people in this parish, will follow from the appointment
of our present Rector. The author gives two direc-
tions in Hebrews xiii.: he bids us look at the pastors
who have passed away, and to those who bear rule
over us. He bids us obey those who at present fill
the office. May we then, each one, strive to
strengthen our pastor and encourage him—
strengthen him by that interest in his work which
takes the form of sympathy and support—support
by personal and pecuniary efforts. Encourage him
by work, by your manifest interest in the work *n
which he is engaged; encourage him by your sym-
pathy in discouragement and difficulties, by your
confident belief that God will be present with him in
his purposes and labours; encourage him by your pe-
titions to the Throne of Grace that he may especially
be one of those wise teachers who turn men to
righteousness and shine in the brightness of the
firmament as stars for ever and ever. We are but
the creatures of a day, and ere another century comes
round we shall have passed away to that bourne from
which no traveller returns, but what we are now doing
on earth is being registered in God’s Book of Remem-
brance, and in due season everything which is done
here for the advancement of Christ’s Kingdom on
earth will be recognized at the great day of account.

We desire to call your attention to the fact that on December 25th

next, we shall celebrate the One Hundreth Anniversary of the Older St. Philip's
Church, Sydney. The Parish is so associated with the Religious History of
Australia that the Rector, Churchwardens, and Parochial Council desire to mark
the occasion by holding Special Services, D.V., on SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18th
at which the Preachers will be, in the Morning, the MOST REV. THE PRIMATE,
and in the Evening, the RIGHT REV. THE LORD BISHOP OF BENDIGO.
A Special Service for the Children will be held in the Afternoon.
It is further proposed to hold a Gathering of Past and Present Parishioners,
in the Hall of the Y.M.C.A., Pitt St., on the Evening of Wednesday , December
21st, at which the Lord Bishop of Bendigo will preside.
A small charge for admission will be made. Tickets may be obtained from
any of the members of the Parochial Council, or from the Verger.

Kjiimn 2—(H.C. 397) “Christ is the head of the church ”—Eph. v. 23.
The church’s one foundation Elect from every nation,
Is Jesus Christ her Lord ; Yet one o’er all the earth,
She is His new creation Her charter of salvation
By water and the word: One Lord, one faith, one birth;
From heaven He came and sought her One holy Name she blesses,
To be his holy bride. Partakes one holy food,
With His own blood He bought her, And to one hope she presses
And for her life He died. With every grace endued.


Though with a scornful wonder Till with the vision glorious
Men see her sore opprest, Her longing eyes are blest.
By schisms rent asunder, And the great church victorious
By heresies distrest: Shall be the church at rest.
Yet saints their watch are keeping,
Their cry goes up, “How long?” Yet she on earth hath union
And soon the night of weeping With God the Three in One,
Shall be the morn of song. And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won:
’Mid toil and tribulation, Ob happy ones and holy!
And tumults of her war, Lord, give us grace that we,
She waits the consummation Like them, the meek" and lowly.
Of peace for evermore; On high may dwell with Thee.
Amen.
