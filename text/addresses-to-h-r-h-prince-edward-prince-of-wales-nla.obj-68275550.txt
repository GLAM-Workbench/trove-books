MAY IT PLEASE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled,
welcome Your Royal Highness with assurances of our devoted attachment to the
person and Crown of our Most Gracious Sovereign.
We recall with pride the latest visit to. Australia of His Majesty the King before his
accession to the Throne, when he was graciously pleased to open in person the inaugural
session of the Australian Parliament.
The abiding memories of that epochal event - have proved a potent factor in
strengthening the ties of kinship and affection which hold together the free nations of the
British Empire in a union which war and danger only help to consolidate.
We therefore rejoice at the presence of Your Royal Highness, and we offer you a
warm and loyal welcome, not only as Heir Apparent to the Throne and as our future
Sovereign, but also as one who was hailed by our gallant Australian soldiers as a comrade
on the field on which so many brave men fought and died in the sacred cause of freedom.
We congratulate Your Royal Highness upon the spirit you displayed in the great war
now happily ended, and we feel that we may indulge a becoming pride in the thought that
the high sense of duty and responsibility by which Your Royal Highness was animated was
shared to the full by Australia?s sons and daughters, who by their valour and their sacrifices
contributed a worthy part to the ultimate triumph of those principles which are the glory
and the pride of the British name.
Your progress throughout the Commonwealth will afford Your Royal Highness an
opportunity of observing the energy, enterprise and character of our people in the
pursuit of the arts of peace.
We earnestly trust that your visit to our shores may be fraught with happiness and
pleasure to Your Royal Highness, and that your mission to our people may be blessed with
an abundant measure of success to the present and enduring advantage of Australia and the
