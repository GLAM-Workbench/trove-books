PHTHISIS IN VICTORIA.
■OP[ A-IN
A Paper read by John Singleton, M.D., at a meeting of the'
Medical Society of Victoria, 6th September, 1876.
(Extracted from the Australian Medical Journal.)
Mr. W. Thomson of South Yarra, in an essay lately published,-
advocated the theory “that climate was powerless to modify or
prevent the development of that disease, or act as a remedial agent
in its cure.”
In support of this theory (which by no means is in consonance*
with the general experience of medical men), he endeavoured to
prove by the aid of Victorian statistics, to which he made reference,
‘‘ that tubercular consumption was increasing in Victoria, and was
as general and fatal in it as in England \ that the Australian or
native born of our population had a special pre-disposition to it,
and that the disease was proving fatal to them at a rapidly
increasing ratio.” Erom Mr. Thomson’s reputation as a medical
practitioner, as well as an author on similar subjects, it would very
naturally have been supposed that he would have had incontro-
vertible evidence of their truthfulness and correctness before he
made such statements as these, calculated to involve the character of
our climate in the opinion of intending emigrants from Europe,-
and likely to create anxiety and cause disappointment to the long-
cherished hopes of numbers who had made Victoria the land of
their adoption, believing they would have a far greater immunity
from the ravages of this disease here than in Europe.
A few years ago, I read a paper on a similar subject before this
Society, and from statistical facts I then became acquainted with,,
felt sure that the theory was utterly fallacious and untenable, and
that the statements made in its support must have been founded on'
error, and would not bear a fair critical examination.
I now redeem my recent promise by bringing before the Society
the results of such an investigation, hoping they may help in some
measure to maintain the well-earned position Victoria has held as a
most suitable place of residence for those having a predisposition tO>
phthisis, or other lung disease arising from hereditary or other
causes ; also to relieve the anxiety created in families by the essay,
and favourable reviews of it hy the press, j-:. -a

It has also been stated on reliable authority, that even a cold
climate, if free from damp and having good natural drainage, is
very favourable to the prevention of phthisis. Archangel, on the
White Sea, the most northern port of Bussia, although in a very
cold latitude, is on this account remarkably free from this disease,,
and persons from districts less favourably situated as to drainage,,
dryness of soil, etc., resort to it as a residence with great benefit
in the earlier stages of consumption.
Within a very recent date, Dr. Lombard, and other scientific
medical men on the continent of Europe, have, by a careful observa-
tion of facts, thrown considerable light on this subject. They found
that at certain altitudes the disease became less frequent and fatal.
Thus, at an elevation of 4000 feet above the sea level, it was but
little known ; and at 6000 feet, it scarcely existed. As we have,
within two or three hours’ journey by railway, Mount Macedon, at
an elevation of 3800 feet, and five or six mountains over 6000 feet
in height in Gipps Land, which will shortly be easy of access, no
doubt their eastern slopes will probably be tested then as a residence
for consumptive patients, and the results be carefully noted by our
medical men.
The Swiss have taken advantage of this discovery, by erecting


While looking through the works of British statists on this
subject, I met with a variety of interesting facts on the influence of
climate on this disease, to some of which I now refer, as they
appeared to me to open up a wide and honourable field for future
scientific investigation in the interests of humanity. Dr. Bowditch,
of Boston, stated in 1862, in a work on the subject, the theory that
“ dampness of soil had much to do with increasing the prevalence
and fatality of tubercular consumption.” In 1867 he threw further
light on the subject, and it was shown that in those territories of
the United States of America which were swampy and undrained,
the deaths from it were 100 per cent, greater than that of England.
Dr. Buchanan, medical officer to the Privy Council, in his report
of 1867, was quite in unison with Dr. Bowditch; and it was proved
that damp, undrained low-lying positions, or houses built on clay or
other moist sub-soils, increased the prevalence and fatality of
phthisis.
In Scotland, where the death-rate from this disease to population
is higher than in England, being one death to each 398, its presence
has been carefully noted in towns and districts ; and it has been
shown that in the counties of Kilmarnock, Dumfries, Montrose, and
Hamilton, which are ill-drained, the death-rate from phthisis is
from 30 to 4 5 per cent, greater than in Dumbarton, Wigtown,
Kirkcudbright, and Renfrew, which are well drained.
It has also been proved by direct experiment, that tubercular
consumption can be produced in young dogs, by confining them for
a few weeks in a damp cellar.
It has also been stated on reliable authority, that even a cold
climate, if free from damp and having good natural drainage, is
very favourable to the prevention of phthisis. Archangel, on the-
White Sea, the most northern port of Russia, although in a very
cold latitude, is on this account remarkably free from this disease,,
and persons from districts less favourably situated as to drainage,
dryness of soil, &c., resort to it as a residence with great benefit
in the earlier stages of consumption.
Within a very recent date, Dr. Lombard, and other scientific
medical men on the continent of Europe, have, by a careful observa-
tion of facts, thrown considerable light on this subject. They found
that at certain altitudes the disease became less frequent and fatal.
Thus, at an elevation of 4000 feet above the sea level, it was but
little known ; and at 6000 feet, it scarcely existed. As w T e have,
within two or three hours’ journey by railway, Mount Macedon, at
an elevation of 3800 feet, and five or six mountains over 6000 feet
in height in Gipps Land, which will shortly be easy of access, no
doubt their eastern slopes will probably be tested then as a residence
for consumptive patients, and the results be carefully noted by our
medical men.
The Swiss have taken advantage of this discovery, by erecting


sanitaria on their picturesque and lovely mountains, from whence,
as well as other similar institutions in other mountainous parts of
Europe, the most hopeful accounts have recently been received.
Other scientific observers have proved that in warm as well as
dry and well-drained climates, there is almost an immunity from
this disease. Upper Egypt and the Cape of Good Hope are given
as good examples and proofs of the truth of this theory, each
having a particularly warm atmosphere and a dry well-drained soil.
It might very reasonably have been inferred from these facts, that
Victoria, whose soil as a rule is well drained naturally and free from,
dampness, with an average temperature ten degrees higher than that
of England, and having so low an amount of humidity of the
atmosphere, would be favourable for preventing the formation of
phthisis, and also for promoting its cure. I have prepared a few
tables, taken from the South Australian and English statistics,
giving the death-rates from phthisis at certain ages, compared to the
same ages of the population. Mr. Hayter, the Government statist,
has in his Year Book intimated that between the ages of twenty
and thirty-five there was, at the census of 1871, a deficiency of the
population amounting to 43,000 (I suppose to bring it into harmony
with that of the same ages in England). It would therefore be
necessary in any calculation or comparison made with other countries
or former censuses to take this into account. I have done so in
every instance, by adding this deficiency to the population, and its
full complement of death-rates to that returned in the census, the
more so as four-fifths of the entire death-rate from phthisis in
England takes place under the age of thirty-five.
In the table No. 1, I have given the average deaths from
phthisis to the population of censuses 1861 and 1871 ; also of
England for the latter census, showing about 100 per cent, more in
England than Victoria ; and in Table No. 2 the average of five
years of Victoria, 1860 to 1864 and 1870 to 1874 (inclusive), and
of England 1871, from which it appears that one in 768 died in
the former, but only one in 800 in the latter ; while that of England
was over 90 per cent, higher than in Victoria, or one in 425.
In examining the question as to whether there was special pre-
disposition of the Australian or native-born of our population to
this disease, as asserted by Mr. Thomson, or not, it is necessary to
draw attention to a fact of some importance, which seems to have
escaped his notice, or he would hardly have written on the subject
as he has. It is this, namely, the census return in 1871 gives the
large number of 3 58,226 as Australian or Victorian born, nearly
one-half the entire population at that census. It might, without
any stretch of fancy, be assumed that these were with very rare
exceptions included in the population under thirty-five, numbering
524,381 (by the recorded numbers in the Victorian Statistics), and
that as by far the greater proportion of these to the different ages


were under twenty years of age, that the latter especially would,
give unmistakeable evidence as to the liability to, or special
immunity from, this most destructive of all other diseases when com-
pared with those of England at the same ages. The results of such
Comparison may be seen in the annexed table (No. 3), which show's
under thirty-five (from birth) there was one death from phthisis to
921 of the population in 1861, while there was but one to 1144
in 1871 ; and in England, same year, one death to 374, 200 per
Cent, more than in Victoria, or three deaths in England for one here
in a similar number of the population.
The contrast of those under twenty is far more remarkable, as in
1861 census there was one death to 2559 under twenty ; in 1871
census, one death to 4780; and, in 1871 census, England, one death
from phthisis to 991 of the population, or 400 per cent, greater,.
Between the ages twenty and thirty-five, there was one death in
England to 170 inhabitants at the same ages ; one to 485 in Victoria,
or nearly three and a half times more in England. In 1861, the
death-rate was but one to 546, very little less than in 1871.
This great immunity of the native born of Victoria from this
much dreaded disease is fully sustained by a comparison of the
death-rates from tabes mesenterioa or consumption of the mesenteric
glands ; a cognate disease of phthisis, mostly confined to children,
and therefore, to the native born here, there being but one death
from it (in the average mortality from 1870 to 1874) to 10,981
of the population, while that of England was one to each 3389, or
200 per cent, greater mortality from it in England than here, as in
Table No. 4 ; and a considerable diminution in Victoria from the
census in 1861, (upwards of 40 per cent.)
The same testimony is. given by a comparison even of Melbourne,
with its hospitals, benevolent and immigrants’ homes, where so
many die of phthisis from the rural districts, when compared with
the death-rates of England, rural and urban, under 35 years of age.
In 1861 there was one death to 511 ; in 1871 only one death to
631 of Melbourne population under 35 : while in the whole of
England there ivas one death to 375 of the same population (Table
No. 5). This is more remarkable when the large number of immi-
grants from Europe, hopelessly affected with this disease, who front
time to time arrive here but to swell the bills of mortality from it,
is taken into consideration.
Tlie very small amount of death-rate from pneumonia, bronchitis,
and all other diseases of the respiratory organs in Victoria, being
but one death to 670 of the population, while in England the same
is one to 275, or 150 per cent, greater than Victoria (Table No. 6),
is also worthy of note. With such facts as the above, and a general
death-rate from all diseases 33 per cent, less than that of England,
rural as well as urban, it may with confidence and truth be made
known to the world, that Victoria is not excelled, if equalled, for

tical information for past years, that as this class predominates, the
death-rates from these, as well as all lung diseases, will continue
with ordinary precautions to be reduced to a minimum; while
Victoria may, ere long, become even more of a sanitarium to
less favoured countries, by a careful testing and noting of the
