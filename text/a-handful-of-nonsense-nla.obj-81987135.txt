There lived an old Angler at Brighton,
Who thought he’d the fishes enlighten.
So he baited his hook
With a leaf from the book
Of Old Isaak Walton, the cute one.
A Policeman was seen in the Park,
Who for once thought he’d have a rare lark,
So he stood on his head,
Whilst his helmet instead
Bid duty for him in the Park.
There was an Old Man in the Strand,
With manners so gentle and bland.
If you trod on his toes
He d straight pull your nose,
In a way none could misunderstand.
There once was a Cabman named Strange,
Who never would give any change ;
Were a shilling his fare,
“ Half-a-crown ” he’d declare,
And “ no gen’l’man axes for change.”
There lived a young fellow at Bow,
Whose house stood in such a long row.
If he went late at night,
He could seldom see straight,
And his street door he never could know,
There was an old Gardner at Jvew
Who delighted in plants that were new,
If you showed him some grass,
He would cry “ I’m an ass,
But this plant ne’er before met my view.”
i.heie was a young Scholar at Harrow,
Himself wheeled to school in a barrow/
“ I am glad I got in,”
He said with a grin,
i or the road s so confoundedly narrow.”
There lived a teetotaller at Pinner
Who never took beer to his dinner,
Only water he drank,
Soon he emptied the tank,
And each day he grew thinner and thinner.
Ihere was a young yachtsman at Ryde
Wore his trousers so monstrously wide,
If it blew a slight breeze
They flapp’d round his knees,
Noi could he then walk though he tried.
There was a young Lady from Wales,
Her chignon tried to weigh in the scales;
It went down with a bound,
For it weighed just four pound,
Such a chignon ne’er before came from Wales.
There was an old Porter at Tring,
Who for years had done nothing but ring,
Ask when the train’s due,
“ At five bells, or two,”
Was ever the answer ’twould bring.
An Irishman lived at Ballinawick,
Who flourished aloft a shillelah so thick,
If you ask’d Paddy why,
With a wink he’d reply
** Arrah sure it’s my teeth for to pick.”
There was once an old gent named M’Genny,
Who thought such a deal of a penny,
If two halfpence he got
He cried what a lot
Of change one may get for a penny.
There was an Old Tar once at Dover,
Who went to bed half seas over,
He got up in the night,
And called for a light
To look for his good ship the “ Rover.**
There lived a young Lady in Grosvenor Square,
Who prided herself on her flowing red hair ;
When she walked in the street
It reached down to her feet,
At its length so prodig’ous the children all star©.
A JiuLdier mere once lived at Wapping,
In his shop he was often found napping,
And he grew thus so big,
“ There’s a twenty stone pig,”
Cried the boys as they met him in Wapping.
