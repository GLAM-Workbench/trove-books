LAPWINGS, FOR INSTANCE
It pleases me to see the plovers come back,
small flocks of them flickering high in the blue,
catching September sunlight as they move,
round wings lapping the air as a cat laps milk;
to hear them crying pee~oo~wit! over the turned earth ...
And because the idea of God can become all but a vice,
gripping the mind so that it can’t be moved
but can only look forward to eternity,
it’s only things like this that still ring true.
History, too, hinders; it can be a halter:
the difference is you face the other way.
... Though without these we are locked in the quotidian
like beasts ...
But whereas it was once enough
to sing a few notes of the unending symphony
meaning, This is the present, This is where 1 live,
and that would be prayer
and would acknowledge the humus enriched
with so much blood, now we must add a motif
to show we can move and be moved to refuse
man-made unmaking.
Somehow I must set
a patient repetitious Let it live
low but insistently like Schubert’s quail
in all my celebrations of this now,
and in my crying over the turning earth.
