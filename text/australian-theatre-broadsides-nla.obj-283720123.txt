There were altogther about three hun-
dred distinct epidemics of influenza in
Europe between 1510, when the disease
was first noted at Maha, and 1850. In
1729 the whole of Europe suffered severely.
According to statistics published by the
Novoe Vremya, the disease caused 908
deaths in London in one week, and in
Vienna sixty thousand persons were af-
fected. In 1737 and 1743 there were
further outbreaks, and the deaths in one
week in London amounted to one thous-
and. In 1775 domestic animals were
fist attacked by it. In 1782 forty thous-
and person's fell ill of it in St. Petersburg
in twenty four hours. In St Petersburg
quinine is now served out daily to the
troops, mixed with vodka.

THE HARRY COIOR SEASON.
Messrs. WILLIAMSON MOSGEOVE take pleasure in announcing the
return to Australia of the favorite American Comedian, Mr. HARRY
CONOR, whose enormous success when appearing in “ A Trip to Chinatown ”
some three years ago is still fresh in the minds of Sydney playgoers. Mr.
CONOR will make his re-appearance in Sydney with a SPLENDID COM-
PANY OF AMERICAN ARTISTS, specially engaged for the interpretation of
Messrs HOYT & McKEETS Typical American Pieces.
During the Season will be presented some of the most successful of
Charles Hoyt’s Comedies (including the famous popular “ A Trip to China-
town,” etc , etc.) The initial production of the season will be CHARLES H.
HOYT’S successful, satirical, farcical Comedy, in 3 acts, entitled—
A ST RANGER IN NEW YORK.
Over two thousand performances have been given of this piece in
America, where it is still running with enormous success. When first
produced, it ran for 400 consecutive nights at the Madison Square Theatre,
New York. The piece will be staged with that attention to detail which
characterises the Firm’s productions.

A new story of Ouida is going the

was visiting her, he ventured, in the
course of a very friendly conversation, to
ask her how she came to know so much
about clubs, camp life, barracks, gamblin
houses, and other places which are or
visited by men. She placed far hand
upon her knees, and, looking straight at:
her questioner, saucily said, “It is nor
of your business.”

guards wore red coats, like their pre

piay the train out of the station, and for
a time the “ harps ” were actually entered

in the knees, legs, hips hands and shoulders. The agony was fearful.

nothing to ease it. At last he was told to try Dr. Williams’ Pink

“ She was an awful contrary woman.”
“ She was that, about everything, and
she kept it up to the last. In fact I don’t
believe she would have died at all if it
hadn’t been for her perverseness.”
“ Why, how was that ? ”
i‘She was very sick, and her husband,
with tears in his eyes, said : ‘ Dear Jane,
you must not die.’ Then she looked at
him, and said; ‘ I’ll show you whether
I’ll die or not,’ and turning her face to the
wall, -was dead in a minute.”—“ Texas

her the mysteries of poker)—“lt seems very
simple. I suppose one can play it as well

Thought He’d Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russell
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W, Dudley,
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe. • On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this way;
If the Prince of Wales should go to
America and pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think, it darned queer, an’ so I thought
I’d stop over here a few days and pay my
respects to the Queen.” —“New York Star.’
Story of a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wife
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
:in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
) necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportorial description the following day
in the*chief paper of the city.—“ New
York Press.”

When Henri Rochefort escaped from
New Caledonia the news of his landing at
Sydney was conveyed to Marshal
M’Mabon by D’Harcourt, who was-
generally supposed to be the real Pre-
sident of the French Republic, The
marshal, much concerned by this news,,
said: —“ This is very serious ; we must
telegraph at once to the United Stateg-
Government and see if extradition
cannot be obtained.” The faithful
vicomte whispered to his master “ But,.
Monsieur le Marechal, Sydney is not in
the United States; it is in Australia.”
Whereupon the marshal, whose know-
ledge of geography had never been very
extensive, threw up his arms and
exclaimed, in admiration : —“ That devil
of a Harcourt, he knows everything,”
