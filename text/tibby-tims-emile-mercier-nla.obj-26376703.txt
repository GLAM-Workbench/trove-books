A Kookaburra came to our place one day.
I shooed him, and shooed him, but still he would stay.
He laughed such a lot, this cheeky young chappie.
That I let him stay, 'cause he made me feel happy.


This tying on ties is a new one on me.
My knots are the plumpest you ever did see.
I'm eager to grow up for then I shall learn.
How Dad gets his neat with a twist and a turn.

When I get this coat on I'll say I am smart.
But the getting it on is a bit of an art.
There's holes where the arms go, it should ought to fit.
Perhaps I'll get Mummy to help me a bit.


One day when I walked down the street.
The biggest man I chanced to meet.
He was as tall as tall could be,
I hope I grow as tall as he.

I've eaten the bread, I know that I'll cop it.
So on second thoughts I think that I'll hop it.
But that would be mean, and bound to annoy
My very best Mummy, I'm such a bad boy.


I'll never play with matches,
A lesson I have learned.
My hand is sore in patches.
On account of it got burned.

If I press my nose to the window pane,
I can hear the wind and can see the rain.
Gee! How I wish that I was out.
In all that rain to splash about.

IVe got myself in a terrible muddle#
I'm all mussed up 'cause I sat in a puddle#
I was running so fast when I had this fall#
That I failed to notice the puddle at all.


Sometimes my Dad is very cross.
He says he'll teach me who is boss.
But when he's nice, he's nice as nice is.
And buys me lollies, drinks and ices.

I'm learning to swim. Dad says I'm a wonder.
He holds me quite tight, so I never go under.
To teach me to swim is his most earnest wish.
He says by next summer I'll swim like a fish.


'lt puzzles me," said Mrs. Bee,
'Why everyone's afraid of me.
I'm not so tall, in fact. I'm small.
They shouldn't notice me at all."

It's dinner time so I must hasten.
To wash my hands in the little basin.
This is a task I do with a dash,
I stand on the stool and gee! do I splash?


j -jra-s ,
When playing a game of hide and seek,
I have a most secret spot to sneak,
I hide behind Daddy who's reading a book.
And nobody ever knows just where to look.

I sit at the table, my meal looks inviting.
If I eat it up, there's a cake most exciting.
Chocolate with cream in, I feel I could kiss it,
I MUST stay awake, or else I shall miss it.

"I'm tired/' said Tibby, so jumped into bed.
Of course, that was after his prayers had been said.
To-morrow he'll tell of his wonderful dreams.
This dear tiny bundle of troublesome schemes.
