PAPER
INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE
COMMITTEE
AFFAIRS of SOUTH AUSTRALIA,
PART OF HIS EVIDENCE,
COLONEL TORRENS,
On Tuesday, the 30th op March, 1841
Hoibon:
PRINTED BY T. BRETTELL, RUPERT STREET, HAYMARKF.T.


Having obtained the requisite financial
returns, authenticated by the accountant of
the commission, I am now prepared to redeem
the pledge given to the Committee on a former
occasion, and to demonstrate, that a loan of
120,000/., if obtained in June 1840, would have
averted, until parliament could have interposed,
the calamity which has overtaken the colony of
South Australia.
I beg, in the first place, to refer the Com-
mittee to the financial paper, No. s*, which
was prepared by the accountant, under my in-
structions, and presented by Mr. Elliot. It will
there be seen, that on the Ist of January, 1840,
the available balance in the hands of the Com-
missioners was 30,136/., while the debt due to
the Emigration Fund, at that period, was
36,812/.; and that, therefore, if the Emigration
Fund had been required for emigration pur-
poses, there would have been an actual defi-
ciency of 6,676/., which it would have been
requisite to provide for by a loan.
Now, considering how precarious is the
money market under our banking system, and
* Appendix, A.


how great was the demand for labour in the
colony, I hesitate not to say, that, even in Ja-
nuary 1840, it was not too soon for the Com-
missioners to have made arrangements for taking
advantage of the then comparative facilities of the
money market, and of the high state of the credit
of the colony, and to have contracted for a loan,
to be paid by distant instalments.
It will be seen by the same account to which
I have already referred, that, on the Ist of July,
1840, the funds at the disposal of the Com-
missioners, amounted to 36,756/,, while the
liabilities amounted to 56,079/., leaving a defi-
ciency of 19,322/., while the debt to the Emi-
gration Fund had been increased to 63,737/.; so
that, if the Emigration Fund had been required
to be replaced for the purposes of emigration,
there would have been, on the Ist of July, 1840,
a total deficiency, as regards the Revenue Fund,
of 83,059/. Considering the provisions of the
Act of Parliament, and also considering the
frequent derangement which occurs in the
money market, and the fact that the land sales
in this country had nearly ceased, I submit to
the Committee, that this was a position of finan-
cial hazard, which the Commissioners, having-
power, under the Acts of Parliament, and the
then credit of the colony, to place themselves
in a situation of security, ought not to have
permitted to occur.
I would now beg leave to call the attention


of the Committee to another financial return*,
also signed by the Accountant of the Commis-
sion, and entitled <f Financial Statement from
? January to June 1840.? By this return, it
appears that, on the Ist of January, 1840, the
assets in the hands of the Commissioners ex-
ceeded their liabilities by 30,136/., and that on
the Ist of February following, the excess of
assets above liabilities was only 21,944/. I beg
the Committee to observe, that this was a rate
of declension leading to insolvency in little
more than two months, even if all idea of com-
plying with the Act of Parliament and replacing
the Emigration Fund had been abandoned.
It appears, by the financial return under con-
sideration, that, in the course of the month of
February this rapid declension in the amount of
available assets was arrested, by the payment to
the Commissioners of 15,636/.; but that from
the Ist of March to the Ist of May, the surplus
of assets above liabilities had declined from
30,244/. to 12,067/. Upon the face of this
account, therefore, it is apparent that at this
rate of declension the Commission must have
become insolvent in the first week in June,
even putting the replacement of the Emigration
Fund and the continuance of Emigration alto-
gether out of the question. I, therefore, sub-
mit for the serious consideration of the Com-
* Appendix, B.


mittee, whether upon the Ist of May, 1840, the
financial position of the colony was not one of
extreme hazard, demanding that the Commis-
sioners should seize the very first favourable
opportunity afforded by the state of the money
market for securing the loan, without which the
colony might even then be considered as verging
on insolvency.
Upon the Ist of June, 1840, the surplus of
assets above liabilities, was 3,453/., while bills
of unusual amount were coming in and
while it was certain that additional liabilities,
under pending contracts with the ship-owners,
would be immediately incurred. On the Ist of
June, therefore, the Commission w T as, in fact,
insolvent, unless the Commissioners could suc-
ceed in contracting for a loan.
Under these circumstances it was, that I urged
upon ray colleagues the extreme danger which
we incurred by delaying to secure the loan while
the money market was comparatively easy, and
the credit of the colony high. They concurred
with me as to the necessity of a loan, but, un-
fortunately, deemed it necessary to postpone
the measures for obtaining it for several weeks,
in order to obtain the sanction of the Treasury
for obeying the Act of Parliament. And it is
now contended that a loan of 120,000/., which
they used every exertion to obtain in the
early part of August, would not have been
effectual had it been obtained in June. I have


pledged myself to demonstrate before this Com-
mittee, that if my advice had been followed,
and a loan secured in June 1840, the calamitous
crisis which has overtaken South Australia would
have been averted, until the meeting of Parlia-
ment had afforded an opportunity for placing the
finances of the colony on a secure foundation.
By the paper marked A*, entitled, ? Monthly
? Statement of Ways and Means for the year
? 1840,? it is shown that if a loan of 120,000/.
had been raised in June, and if a moderate
stream of emigration had been kept up during
the autumn of that year, there would have
remained in the hands of the Commissioners on
the 31st of December, 1840, a balance of 69,969/,
after the discharge of all liabilities presented for
payment up to the 31st of December, 1840.
Now, by the financial statement which I hold
in my handf, and which was ordered to be pre-
pared by the Committee, it appears, that if a
loan had been raised in June 1840, there would
have been in the hands of the Commissioners
on the Ist of February, 1841, funds to the
amount of 48,753/., after the discharge of dll
liabilities falling due up to the 31st of January.
And it further appears by the same account,
which I now hold in ray hand, and am about to
present to the Committee, that had the loan
been secured in June, there would have been
* Appendix, C.
t Appendix, D,


upon the Ist of March, 1841, in the hands of
the Commissioners, over and above all demands
falling due up to the end of February, funds to
the amount of about 40,000/., exclusive of the
Guarantee Fund, amounting to 15,000/. more,
which the Secretary of State was authorised to
appropriate to such colonial expenses as could
not otherwise be provided for. I therefore
submit to the Committee, that the raising of a
loan of 120,000/. in the month of June 1840,
when it could, without difficulty, have been
obtained, would have had the self-same effect in
warding off the calamitous crisis which has occur-
red, which could have been produced by the Loan
to a like amount, which in July and in August,
the commissioners, when it was too late, en-
deavoured to obtain. 1 further submit, that
the statements which I have now made, veri-
fied as they are by the financial returns signed
by the Accountant of the Commission, set
at rest the question between ray colleagues
and myself as to whether a loan of 120,000/.,
secured in June 1840, would, or w T ould not,
have averted until the appointment of this
Committee, the serious disaster which has
overtaken the colony of South Australia.
These returns, as I conceive, demonstrate, that
had such loan been raised, all claims upon the
Commission falling due up to the 28th of Fe-
bruary, might have been discharged; that, in
the autumn of 1840, Emigration, instead of


having been altogether suspended, might have
gone on in a continuous though diminished
stream, and that there would have been on the
Ist of March available assets, exclusive of the
Guarantee Fund, amounting to about 40,000/.
I am aware that to this view of the subject, it
has been objected that a loan of 120,000/., if
obtained in June 1840, could not have averted
the financial crisis, because it was the inten-
tion of the Commissioners, if such loan had
been obtained, to have obeyed the Act of Par-
liament, and to have continued emigration upon
the same scale upon which it was conducted
in the year 1839, and because the expenditure
required for this intended emigration would
have left no available funds for sustaining the
credit of the colony by meeting Colonel Gaw-
ler?s drafts. To this objection I submit the
following replies
First ?In June 1840, the Commissioners
w r ere unanimous in considering that a loan of
120,000/. was required, and the difference of
opinion which then occurred amounted to no
more than this ?my colleagues thought it neces-
sary to obtain the advice and sanction of the
Treasury before they complied with the provi-
sions of the Act of Parliament, and went into
the market for a loan, while I, fully agreeing
with them as to the propriety of explaining
the circumstances of the colony to the Govern-
ment, contended, that as the only advice which


the Treasury could give was to obey the Act of
Parliament, we ought to obey it at once, while
the state of the money market, and of the credit
of the colony, enabled us to do so. My col-
leagues would have concurred with me in raising
a loan of 120,000/., if they had then obtained
the sanction of the Treasury for the measure.
This is proved by the facts, that they applied
for that sanction on the 7th of July, that they
pressed for the earliest possible reply to the
application; and that on the 23rd of July, the
day after the anxiously awaited sanction was
obtained, the advertisement for a loan of
120,000/. was issued. Now, how, I ask, can my
colleagues, after having asked for the sanction
of the Treasury for raising a loan on the 7th of
July, after having acted on this sanction on the
23rd of July, the instant it was received; after
having negociated with various private parties
in August; after having importuned the Secre-
tary of State and the Chancellor of the Exche-
quer through all the remaining months of the
year; how can my colleagues, after having thus
used their utmost efforts to obtain the means of
meeting Colonel Gawler?s drafts, and sustaining
the credit of the local government, consistently
maintain that a loan which would have been
good at any time in July, and early in August,
would have been useless in June ; and that they
would have allowed the mischief to come with
the means of averting it in their hands ?


Second ?It appears, by the financial state-
ments* laid before the Committee, and already
referred to, that on the Ist of July, 1840, the
debt due to the Emigration Fund was 63,737/.,
while the cash and Exchequer bills in the hands
of the Commissioners amounted to 36,756/. Un-
der these circumstances, the Commissioners had
the alternative of continuing emigration, and
dishonouring Colonel Gawlers drafts, or of
stopping emigration, and honouring these drafts.
They adopted the latter course. They ceased
to advertise for ship tenders in the beginning of
June, and they continued to honour Colonel
Gawlers drafts until the latter end of August.
And it is here to be particularly remarked, that
at this time the Commissioners considered it so
imperative upon them to uphold the credit of
the colony, that they continued to accept Colonel
Gawlers bills, not only as long as they had the
means of paying them when due, but until they
had left themselves without the means of pay-
ing their own contract debts with the ship-
owners. With what consistency, then, can it
now be asserted, that had a loan been obtained,
giving them the power of upholding the credit
of the colony while continuing a moderate stream
of emigration, they would have reversed their
whole proceedings ?have enlarged the stream
of emigration, and have dishonoured Colonel
Gawlers drafts ?
* Appendix, A.


is urged that the Commissioners
had early come to the resolution to conduct
emigration during the year 1840, upon the same
scale on which it had been conducted by their
predecessors in the year 1839. But this reso-
tion cannot be taken as a law of the Medes and
Persians. It must have bent to the facts that
in 1839 the land sales had yielded 160,000/.,
and that in 1840 they fell to almost nothing.
Fourth ?My colleagues contend, that if a
loan had been raised in June, the Act of Parlia-
ment would have required that the sum borrowed
from the Emigration Fund should, in the first
instance, have been replaced ; and that, there-
fore, a loan in June could not have placed in
the hands of the Commissioners the means of
paying Colonel Gawler s drafts, and averting the
crisis. I answer, in the first place, why was not
this objection urged by my colleagues against
obtaining a loan in July and early in August ?
I answer, in the second place, that the Act of
Parliament did not require that the Commission-
ers, while dishonouring Colonel Gawler?s drafts,
should continue emigration. The third section
of the amended Act provides, that when the
money borrowed from one fund in aid of the
other, is required for the purposes of the fund
from which it is borrowed, then a loan shall be
raised, and the money so borrowed shall be
replaced. Now, the money borrowed from the
Emigration Fund could not have been required


for the purposes of emigration, had the Gover-
nor?s bills been dishonoured; and for the obvious
reason, that the stoppage of salaries, the discon-
tinuance of public works, and the general dis-
tress occasioned by the bankruptcy of the local
government, must have so diminished the de-
mand for labour as to require, not a continuance
of emigration from this country, but rather, it
is to be feared, the re-emigration of the labour-
ing population previously sent out. To have
continued emigration upon an extensive scale,
while dishonouring the Governor?s drafts, is a
course which may have been inconsiderately con-
templated, but it is one which I cannot believe
it possible that the Commissioners could have
actually adopted.
Fifth ?Passages in the correspondence ad-
dressed by the Commissioners to the Colonial
Department, have been referred to as proving,
in the event of a loan being obtained, that the
Commissioners contemplated the continuance of
emigration, and the rejection of the Governor?s
bills. I reply, that all the other passages in
that correspondence which refer to the evils to
be apprehended from the rejection of the Go-
vernors bills, go to prove that the contemplated
course would have been injudicious in the highest
degree. But the Commissioners could not have
felt themselves bound to act upon an intention
formed without a due consideration of the conse-
quences. Even if they had desired to act upon it,


the Secretary of State would not have permitted
them to do so. Their statements (not, as I
fear, too highly coloured) of the nature and ex-
tent of the mischief to be apprehended from
the rejection of the Governor?s bills, induced
Lord John Russell to represent to the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer, that unless aid were
afforded by Her Majesty?s Government, the
property, and even the lives of the colonists,
might be endangered; and it can hardly be sup-
posed that the Secretary of State for the Colonial
Department would have permitted the Commis-
sioners, had a loan been effected in June, not
only to create the danger they described, by
dishonouring the Governor?s drafts, but to
jeopardize hundreds of other lives by continuing
emigration on an extended scale-
Sixth ?The intention to carry on an exten-
sive emigration, while dishonouring Colonel
Gawler?s drafts, evinces, as it appears to me, an
imperfect acquaintance with the economical
conditions of South Australia; with the nature
of the peculiar danger to which that condition
exposed the settlers; and with the character of
the appropriate means by which, under any
unfavourable occurrence, that danger might be
warded off. In the letter of the 26th August,
which the Commissioners addressed to the Co-
lonial Office; in my draft, bearing the same date,
which I gave in to the Committee; and in the
letter of the 17th September, which I submitted,


in my individual capacity, to the Secretary of
State, the economical condition of the colony is
fully explained. In these papers it is shown
that the delay of the surveys caused the capital
of the first settlers to be invested in building,
rather than in cultivation; that the value of the
capital thus fixed was sustained by the demand
created by the inflowing population; and that in
border to prevent a suspension of prosperity, it
would be necessary that the population should
continue to increase, and that the credit of the
colony should be sustained, until the increase of
stock, and the extension of tillage should enable
the industry of the country to support the in-
dustry of the town. This state of things
demanded forethought, and a knowledge of
principles part of those entrusted with
the management of the colony. I endeavoured
to point out the danger, and I suggested that
should a revulsion occur, it might be expedient to
adopt in South Australia the arrangements with
respect to emigration which are recommended for
Canada in the Appendix B. of Lord Durham?s
report: ?namely, to keep up a stream of emi-
gration, and at the same time to create a demand
for the labour of the emigrants, by employing
those who might not obtain work from private
capitalists, upon such public works as are calcu-
lated to render the capital of individuals more
productive, and thus to attract an influx of
opulent settlers. Continued emigration, with


occasional employment upon public works, as
recommended in Lord Durham?s report, as the
appropriate means for promoting the prosperity
of Canada, might have secured South Australia
against the danger incident to the economical
condition just described, until the multiplication
of flocks, and the extension of tillage over the
most fertile districts as yet discovered in New
Holland, should have rendered the colony inde-*
pendent of external aid. Whether it would
have been practicable, if the credit of the colony
had been early sustained, to have obtained,
under the provisions of the amended act, the
means of applying to South Australia the prin-
ciples of Lord Durham?s report, I will not now
stop to inquire. If sufficient means could have
been commanded, I should have conducted emi-
gration on the principles of that report; and if
unable to go thus far, I should have taken the
next best course, and have sustained the credit
of the colony in the first instance, as essential to
the continuance of the demand for labour, and
then, with whatever means might have remained
at my disposal, have kept up a continuous but
cautious supply. My colleagues would have
adopted a different course. With a loan of
120,000/. at their disposal, they w r ould have sus-
pended the demand for labour by destroying the
credit of the colony, and then they would have
employed the resources at their command in
increasing the supply of labour. Under this


process the emigrants must have perished oil
the shore, or have immediately re-emigrated to
the neighbouring settlements. Had my col-
leagues obtained the loan they advertised
for in July, and sought from private parties in
August, and had the Secretary of State per-
mitted them to have employed it as they con-
tend it ought to have been employed, then this
loan, as far as South Australia is concerned,
would have been thrown away, and all the evils
which have overtaken the colony would have
been aggravated, instead of having been re-
lieved.
Seventh ?If it were true, as my colleagues
contend, that a loan of 120,000/., raised in June
1840, could not have averted the crisis, because
it would have been imperative upon them to
have employed it, not in paying Colonel Gaw-
ler?s drafts, but in continuing emigration, then a
loan to a similar amount raised in July, or in
August, could not have averted the crisis;
because upon their own principle, such loan
must also have been expended on emigration,
and not in upholding the credit of the colony,
by honouring the Governor?s drafts. Every
argument which they urge to show that they
were right in refusing to raise a loan in June, is
an argument showing that they were wrong in
endeavouring to raise a loan in July and early
in August. And every effort which was made to
obtain a loan in July and in August, every


exertion which was resorted to, to uphold the
credit of the colony, by obtaining an advance
from private individuals, from the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, and from Jpe Bank of England,
was, in point of fact, a practical demonstration,
that in refusing to raise a loan in June, the
Commissioners committed a grievous mistake.
Eighth ?Had a loan of 120,000/. been raised
in June 1840, the provisions of the Act of
Parliament would have required that at the
close of the year 1840, a transfer should have
been made from the Revenue Fund to the credit
of the Emigration Fund to the amount of the
sums borrowed from that fund; and the avail-
able assets would have appeared on the books
of the Commission as belonging partly to the
Emigration Fund, and partly to the Revenue
Fund. And it would have been necessary, in
meeting Colonel Gawler?s drafts, to have bor-
rowed again from the Emigration Fund. I am
aware that my colleague, Mr. Elliot, has stated,
in one part of his evidence, that in his opinion
this would have been a most improper course;
and that no loan should be taken from an Emi-
gration Fund, created by the land sales of a
previous year. But this opinion is inconsistent
with another part of Mr. Elliot?s evidence, in
which he states, that it was expedient not to
resort to a loan in the early part of the year
1840, so long as the Commissioners had the
means of borrowing from the Emigration Fu nd


then in their hands, afid which fund had been
created by the land sales of a previous year.
And further, the opinion of my colleague, that
it would have been most improper to borrow in
1841 from the Emigration Fund, created by the
land sales of a previous year, is inconsistent with
my colleague?s own practice through the whole
course of the year 1840. That year commenced
with a debt to the Emigration Fund of 36,000/.;
and notwithstanding this, the Commissioners
deemed it so necessary to uphold the credit of
the colony, that they borrowed from the Emi-
gration Fund, created by the land sales of the
previous year, an additional sum of about 60,000/.
It appears to me most strange, that after having
pursued this course in the year 1840, in the
expectation of averting a crisis, my colleagues
should object to adopting the self-same course,
under the certainty that, by its adoption, a crisis
might have been averted until Parliament had
an opportunity to interpose.
For the several reasons which I have now de-
tailed, I cannot concur in the opinion expressed
by my colleagues, that had a loan of 120,000/. been
negociated in June, emigration would have been
continued on an extensive scale, and the drafts
drawn by the Governor on the Commissioners
dishonoured; and I retain the opinion, the
truth of which, as I conceive, the financial
returns which have been already referred to,
fully demonstrate, that, had a loan to this


amount been secured, the financial crisis might
have been averted until the meeting of Par-
liament afforded an opportunity of placing the
finances of the colony under the control of the
Treasury, as, in my opinion, they ought from
the commencement to have been.
I have already stated to the chairman, that,
in the evidence of my colleague, Mr. Elliot,
there are statements which appear to me to
be erroneous. Some of them seem to have
proceeded from inadvertence ; and it will be
sufficient if I verbally allude to them, after
having concluded this paper. Others, however,
involve principles and consequences, and, there-
fore, require a more formal notice.
My colleague says, ? I find, in the twenty-
? second page of the Fourth Annual Report of
? the late Commissioners, a passage alluding
? to a scheme for placing the finances of the
? province on a stable foundation, by providing
? for the payment of the interest, and ulti-
? mately, of the principal of the debt; on which
** scheme, if no remarks were made, it might
? be supposed that the new Commissioners had
" been negligent. Had any such plan been
? communicated to the Commissioners who as-
? sumed the management of the affairs of the
? colony in January 1840, they would have
? accepted it with gratitude; but during the six
? months, from January to July 1840, not a
? word was mentioned to us of this scheme.


Now, having said that we never heard of this
? plan till July, when it was too late to take any
? advantage of it, the Report in which it was
? alluded to being written by a member of our
? own board, I really must go on to explain,
? that up to the present day we are not aware
what the plan was.?
The plan alluded to in the Report, was a
very simple, though, as I believe, a perfectly
efficacious plan. The measures which it com-
prised, and which it was my intention to have
submitted to the late board, were successively
brought under the consideration of my present
colleagues. They were the following: ?To
raise a loan at a reduced rate of interest, by
the issue of bonds convertible into land at par;
to prevent the facility for raising successive
loans, which this arrangement would give, from
leading to extravagant expenditure, by placing
the expenditure of the local government under
the control of representative members of coun-
cil ; and to provide for the liquidation of
the colonial debt by the appropriation to that
specific purpose, of a sufficient extent of
unalienated land. My colleague admits, that
the first of these measures was discussed at
the board, and set aside; the second was
not only fully explained to my colleagues,
but was approved by them, and recommended
for adoption in their letter of the 7th of July;
and the third measure, for the establishment of


a landed sinking fund, is detailed in the draft of
the 2<3th of August, which my colleague refused
to sign; and also in the letter of the 17th of
September, which I addressed to Lord John
Russell in my individual capacity, of which letter
my colleague was fully cognizant.
I understand my colleague to have stated, that
if a loan had been raised to pay a debt due to the
Emigration Fund, it would have been contrary
to the Act of Parliament, and most improper to
reborrow from the Emigration Fund so reple-
nished. In both these statements, as it ap-
pears to me, my colleague is in error. Neither
the letter, nor the spirit of the amended Act,
precludes reborrowing from a replenished fund.
Looking to the letter of the Act, we are allowed
to borrow from any existing emigration fund
not required for emigration purposes, without
any reference as to whether such fund has arisen
from the land sales of the present, or of a pre-
vious year, or from the replacement of a former
advance; and looking to the spirit of that Act,
I can say with confidence, that it was the intent
and purpose of its framers to give the power of
borrowing from one fund to the other, irrespec-
tively of the source from which the funds to be
borrowed from might be derived. If a loan of
120,000/. had been obtained in June 1840,
under the arrangement specified in the paper
marked A*, there would have been in the hands
* Appendix, C.


of the Commissioners on the Ist of January,
1841, a replenished Emigration Fund, amount-
ing to 70,000/. But this fund could not have
been required for the purposes of emigration,
had the demand for labour in the colony been
narrowed by the insolvency of the local governr
ment; and I, therefore, contend, that while it
would have been strictly legal, it would also have
been most expedient and most proper to have
reborrowed from the replenished Emigration
Fund, for the purpose of averting a financial cri-
sis, until after this Committee should have met.
Mr. Elliot has stated (question 1362) that the
Fourth Annual Report of the late Commis-
sioners was not only given in, but composed in
July 1840; and he adds (question 1365), that
? the parliamentary papers show that the Fourth
,c Annual Report was in the course of being
? written in the month of July 1840.?
How my colleague could have fallen into
these misconceptions I am at a loss to conceive.
The Report was not composed in July 1840,
and the parliamentary papers do not show that
it was then in the course of being written. The
Report was commenced and almost wholly com-
posed in the early part of the year, and all that
the parliamentary papers go to show is, that its
completion , by adding the statistics of the colony
up to the 31st of December, 1839* and by
* i See Note at the end.


.sending it round for the approval of the late
Commissioners, was postponed until July 1840.
My colleague has himself shown, in a letter
appended to the Report, that it was in progress
among the former Commissioners on the 9th of
June.
Mr. Elliot stated, in answer to the question
642, that ? there was no one at the board who
? would have said, let us pay the individuals to
? whom we owe money, and neglect the Emi-
? gration Fund. I may safely assert this. If
? we had got money in July, no doubt we should
? have replenished the Emigration Fund first.
? We should have obeyed the law.?
I cannot, as a member of the board, assent to
the correctness of this statement. Had we ob-
tained money in July, and had we, while refusing
to pay those to whom we were indebted, applied
the funds at our disposal to emigration, we
should not only have neglected the Emigration
Fund, but, as far as concerned South Australia,
have actually thrown it away; inasmuch, as
the emigrants sent out while the colony was
thrown into a state of confusion and embarras-
men t by the insolvency of the local govern-
ment, would have been compelled to seek
employment by re-emigrating to the neighbour-
ing settlements. If the statement were correct,
it would go to prove that the Commissioners
were wrong in endeavouring to obtain a loan in
July, and in the early part of August. As a


member of the board, I could not have acted as
my colleague assumes I should have done. I
may safely affirm this, because, from the begin-
ning of June to the end of August, the three
Commissioners concurred in paying the persons
to whom money was due, and in honouring
Colonel Gawler?s drafts, not only to the neglect
but to the entire exhaustion of the Emigration
Fund.
In commenting upon the draft, in which I
have represented, as I conceive it was my duty
to do, the opinion I had been led to form
respecting the system of administration created
by the Act of Parliament, and the peculiar
position in which, through the operation of this
system, the settlers in South Australia had been
placed, Mr. Elliot has advanced some observa-
tions, to which I would request permission very
briefly to allude. My colleague has said (ques-
tion 1363), ? Up to the date at which the draft
? was proposed, I had heard of little else but
? the success of the colony, and the satisfaction
? of all who were interested in the working of
? the experiment. At the first appearance of
? danger, I did not like to reverse the whole
? language that had been held.? If my col-
league had referred to the early minutes of the
board ?to the first, third, and fourth Annual
Reports, and to the voluminous correspondence
between the Commissioners and the Colonial
Department, on the Guarantee Fund, on the


amendment of the Act, on financial control, and
on divided authority, he would have found that
no satisfaction had ever been expressed regard-
ing the system of administration created by the
Act of Parliament, and that the language of the
draft in relation to this system, so far from
being novel and inconsistent; is the language
which, from the first, the conductors of the
experiment uniformly held. The principle of
defraying the expense of emigration by means
of the value which immigrations confer upon
the waste lands of, the colonies, has been suc-
cessful ; the system of financial administration,
in conjunction with which that system has been
applied in South Australia, has broken down.
My colleague will himself admit, upon reconsi-
deration, that the affirmation of two propositions
so entirely distinct from each other, involves
no inconsistency.
Though fearful that I may have already ob-
truded on the Committee too long, yet I must
crave indulgence for an explanatory observation
relative to the position in which I stand.
Though I did not originate the colony of South
Australia, yet circumstances occurred which
rendered me mainly instrumental in planting
it. When the other Commissioners, who had
been nominated by Mr. Secretary Spring Rice,
resigned their functions on the change of go-
vernment in 1834, I remained at my post, and
frith the sanction of Lord Aberdeen, and sub-


sequently of Lord Glenelg, formed a new com-
mission for carrying the Act of Parliament into
effect. When the provisions of the Act, requiring
that we should commence with borrowing money
toform a Guarantee Fund, and with effecting pre-
liminary sales in an unexplored country, appeared
to present insuperable difficulties, I resorted to
measures through which we overcame them. I
appealed to the public in speeches, pamphlets,
and books; I urged and almost coerced the
.candidates for appointments under the commis-
mission to become purchasers of land; I re-
quested my colleague, Mr. Mills, to take part of
the loan required for the Guarantee Fund; while
I lent my own aid to some amount, towards
the completion of the preliminary sales. The
result of these exertions has been, the planting
of 15,000 souls on the shores of South Australia.
These 15,000 settlers, whom I was mainly
instrumental in removing from their homes,
have been overtaken by a disaster which must
ruin the fortunes of many, which must throw
hundreds out ofemployment, and whichm ay
occasion destitution, disturbance, extensive plun-
der, and .the loss of life. Under the heavy respon-
sibility that pressed upon me, it was impossible
for me to abstain from demonstrating the fact,
that this disaster, with its as yet unknown
results, would not have occurred if my arrange-
ments had not been overruled. It was due to
my own reputation, and still more, it was due to


a great principle of national improvement, which
mismanagement on my part might discredit,
that I should disclose the truth, and the whole
truth, regardless of the consequences, whether
to others or to myself, which might result
therefrom. I have placed myself in opposition
to my colleagues, not voluntarily, but through a
moral necessity, which no one could resist My
object has been, not to cast censure upon them,
but to show how the colony I planted might
have been saved. My colleagues, with whom,
personally, no ground for difference ever has
arisen, acted upon the best of their judgment,
under new and difficult circumstances; and the
government approved of the course which they
pursued. This, for them, will be a sufficient
justification. But, after all that had occurred
through the five preceding years, mine was a
position far different from theirs. For me, there
was no justification short of a demonstration, that
the measures I proposed for adoption would
have averted the calamity which has over-
whelmed the thousands whom I was instru-
mental in removing from their homes.
The demonstration which was necessary for
my justification I now have given. I have
shown, by a financial statement, prepared and
signed by the Accountant, that, in January
1840, the unpledged funds of the Commission
were decreasing in a ratio leading to insolvency in
little more than two months; that though this


decrease was for a time averted by a payment in
February, from the land sales of the previous
year, it became apparent, on the Ist of May,
that without a loan, we should be insolvent in
June, and that in the first week in June in-
solvency had actually occurred. I have shown,
by the correspondence with Mr. Freshfield,
copies of which I gave in at a former examina-
tion, and the originals of which, registered and
stamped as official papers of the Commission,
and indorsed as such in my colleague?s own
hand writing, I subsequently handed to the
Chairman, that in February I made preparations
for a loan, and that in March the subject was
brought before the Board. I have shown, by
a reference to the statement of ways and means
for the year 1840*, prepared and signed by the
Accountant, that if a loan of 120,000/. had
been raised in June 1840, and a moderate
stream of emigration kept up during the latter
months of the year, there would have remained
in the hands of the Commissioners on the
31st of December, 1840, after discharging
all liabilities falling due up to that date, an
estimated balance of 69,969/. I have shown,
by a reference to the amended Act, and to
the practice of the Commissioners, during
the whole of the year 1840, that had a loan
been raised, and the emigration fund replenished
* Appendix, C.


therefrom in December 1840, the
in January 1841, could, under the third section
of the Act, have re-borrowed any portion of the
emigration fund not required for emigration;
that no portion of the emigration fund could
have been required for emigration, unless the
credit of the colony had been first upheld ; and
that in order to obey the Act, as regards the
continuance of emigration, it would have been
necessary to have re-borrowed such portion of
the emigration fund as might be required to
maintain the demand for labour in the colony, by
preventing a financial crisis, and a consequent
suspension of employment. I have shown, by
the financial statement for the first months of
1841*, that had a loan of 120,000/. been raised in
June 1840, and a cautious stream of emigration
been kept up, the Commissioners would haveheld,
on the Ist of March 1841, after discharging all
liabilities falling due up to the 20th of February,
an available balance of 40,000/.; and I have
shown, by a reference to the financial statement
put in by my colleaguest, and the corresponding
statement now put in by myself J (both prepared
and signed by the Accountant of the Commis-
sion), that a loan of 120,000/. in June 1840,
even with the increased expenditure of the
continuous emigration which that loan would
have enabled us to keep up, would have left,

+ Appendix, F.


on the Ist of May, 1841, a colonial debt, ex-
ceeding by only 4,775/., the debt which,
without averting the calamitous crisis, has been
actually incurred.
I therefore submit to the Committee, that I
have now fully redeemed my pledge, and that I
have justified myself to those to whom I am
morally responsible?the 15,000 settlers planted
in South Australia.
R. TORRENS.
The Report could not include the financial statistics in the
Colony, subsequent to the 31st of December. The excessive
number of bills presented in June, were dated in January,
when the late Commissioners were out of office, and could not,
by possibility, have been included in the Report of their
administration.
