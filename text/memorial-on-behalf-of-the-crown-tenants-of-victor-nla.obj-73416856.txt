TO THE
RIGHT HONORABLE HENRY LABOUOHERE,
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES,
THE MEMORIAL
ON BEHALF OF
THE CROWN TENANTS OF VICTORIA;
Humbly Shewethy
THAT the unsettled state of the Land Question in Victoria is injurious to the peace and prosperity
of the Australian Colonies; and that your Memorialist, therefore, begs to draw your attention to the
state of that long vexed question, by submitting the following brief statement of facts, and references
to the Order in Council, and Proclamations of the Governor General:?
1. By the Act 9 and 10 Victoria, and by the Order in Council of the 9th March 1847, a right to
a Lease, and pre-emptive right to purchase, was granted to the Licensed Occupants of Crown Lands in
New South Wales, which then included Victoria.
2. By Proclamation of the 7th October 1847, the Order in Council was made to have the force and �
effect of law in the Colony.
3. Under an Act of the Government of New South Wales, assented to on the 17th June 1848,
the boundaries of disputed runs were settled by Commissioners, who were paid by fees exacted from
the Occupants.
4. By Proclamation of the Ist January 1848, regulations were established for the acceptance of
Tenders for forfeited, vacant, and new runs, and under it premiums were paid for a right of lease, &c. ''
5. By Proclamation of same date, the transfer of runs was sanctioned, and thereby made market-
able, so that a large proportion of the Pastoral Property in the Colonies changed hands, and millions /�
were invested under such pledges of public faith.
6. By Proclamation of the 7th October 1847, it was intimated, ? that all practicable despatch would �
be used for the purpose of putting the Occupants of Crown Lands in possession of the Leases.?
7. By Proclamation dated 28th October 1851, the Governor General, with the advice of the Exe-
cutive Council, established regulations relative to the dates and terms of the Leases to be issued for
Crown Lands in the intermediate and unsettled districts, ? under Her Majesty's Order in Council, and
directed that the maximum term of 8 and 14 years, as the case may be, shall commence from a certain
day, namely, the Ist January 1852, without reference to the actual date on which the lease may issue.?
8. By Proclamation dated 11th March 1852, the Governor General, in reserving lands from lease,
fully acknowledged the Licensed Occupants? pre-emptive right to purchase the land at a fair value,
even within the Reserves.
9. That the Licensed Occupants complied with all the conditions and requirements of the Govern-
ment in demanding leases,-?in the payment of fees to the Government for the settlement of boundaries,
?in the payment of premium by tender for new runs,?and in the regular payment of the stipulated
rent.
10. That notwithstanding so many implementary steps having been taken towards carrying out
Her Majesty?s Order in Council, the Executive Government of Victoria suspended preparations for
issuing the leases, though some were issued in New South Wales, and limited the pre-emptive right of
purchase to 640 acres, until the question could be referred to the Home Government; but shortly after,
and before any instructions were received, the Governor disposed of the lands, in many instances to the
heavy loss of the Occupant.


11. Ihat on the 17th August 1852, the Legislature of Victoria unanimously expressed an opinion
that the question should be referred to the Home Government j but the Duke of Newcastle?s despatch
ot the 2od November 1853, unfortunately left the question unsettled, though it certainly empowered the
Executive to settle it.
12. That his late Excellency, Sir Charles Hotham, with the best intentions, appointed a Commis-
sion of Eleven Members of the Legislature to report upon the question ; that that Commission, from His
Excellency s want of knowledge of the parties, was unfairly constituted, is proven by a reference to the
votes of the Commissioners in the Council; and that the Report was an entire failure, is evident from
the fact of eight of the eleven Commissioners having protested against it.
13. That in the ? Waste Lands Repeal Act,? and in the ? New Constitution,? there are clauses
providing for the fulfilment of any promises and contracts entered into by Her Majesty, though the
general management of the Crown Lands is transferred to the Colonial Legislatures.
14. That the strong jealousies, prejudices, and interests, opposed to the claims of the Crown Ten-
ants of Victoria, and the swamping of their Representation, renders it hopeless to obtain an equitable
expression of opinion from the Legislature, and incurs a heavy responsibility to the Governor.
15. That the Crown Tenants of Victoria have formed an Association in defence of their rights,
and that a collision with the Executive is evidently not far distant, unless steps are taken to avert it.
16. That, in order to avoid a state of impending anarchy?to respect the sacred rights of property
?to establish good government, and to relieve the Governor of the Colony, and the Secretary of State
for the Colonies, from the responsibility of correcting the errors and neglects of their predecessors in
office, your Memorialist humbly entreats you to refer the interpretation of the question to the Law Offi-
cers of the Crown; and he appends points which, he trusts, may be submitted for opinion, as your
Memorialist feels assured that an expression of opinion obtained from such eminent authorities as the
Crown Law Officers, would be received with great respect by all parties in the Colonies, and would be
the means of enabling a firm Government to effect an equitable settlement of this grievous question.
And, as in duty bound, will ever pray.
Edinburgh, 21 st May 1850.


POINTS SUBMITTED FOR OPINION
1. Assuming
Licensed Occupant or Tenant of Crown Lands fulfilled the conditions
premiums for new runs ; fees to Commissioners for defining-boundaries,
imposed upon him,
and large sums for the transfer of runs,?Has he acquired a right to a Lease for the maximum
term, from a certain date, and a right to a Renewal of it ? See Order in Council of 9. March 1847 ;
and Colonial Proclamation, dated 1. January and 17. June 1848, and 28. October 1851.
2. Has the Occupant a pre-emptive right or option to purchase the land, before the Governor
can sell it by auction to any private person, for profit or enjoyment? See Sections 6, 8, 10, and 15
of Order in Council*
3. Is the Governor justified in reserving land from sale to the Crown Tenant, and afterwards
selling it byAuction to other persons, for their individual profit, for pastoral or agricultural purposes,
or for the more speculative purpose of being held for a rise in value; and can such sales be construed
into public purposes, under section 9of the Order in Council ? See references on last point.
4. Has the Crown Tenant who applied to purchase land upon his run under his pre-emptive right,
any recourse for compensation, when his right to purchase has been refused, and the land sold to
speculators, by auction, to his loss ?
