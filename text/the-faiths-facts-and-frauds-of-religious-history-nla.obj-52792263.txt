INTRODUCTORY.
A few words will suffice to introduce the following pages to
the attention of the reader.
When first their author came to Australia, some twelve
months since, it was her intention to give a course of lectures
solely on the facts and phenomena of the great new spiritualistic
movement of the 19th century. After a certain number of
opening addresses, based on the above-named plan, the audience
—according to custom—were called upon to select their own
subjects, when it became apparent that the majority of those
present on each occasion were bent on the discussion of
theological problems, especially in relation to the enormous
claims of Christian Hierarchies, and the fundamental prin-
ciples of truth involved in religious institutions.
Prompted by the obvious tendency of popular feeling, the
author’s lectures have gradually been directed towards
analytical researches into the origin of religious beliefs; their
nature and use to mankind ; their authenticity, and the
evidences which ecclesiasticism could, or could not bring, to
prove its right to dominate over the human mind. The
propositions thus called forth have necessarily involved many
startling and revolutionary assertions, and as the limits of
extemporaneous addresses scarcely permitted the quotation of
2


numerous authoritative witnesses, the author has realized the
duty of providing for her many trusting listeners, some
compendious and accessible definitions of the chief points
contained in her theological lectures, together with such a mass
of corroborative testimony, and references to acknowledged
authorities, as would place the means of verification at each
reader’s command.
The author is already in possession of an immense array of
curious and recondite memoranda on this subject, furnished to
her by the erudite author of “ Art Magic,” but as this
storehouse of information is not at present accessible, and its
publication would require many months of leisure to prepare,
it has been deemed best to put forth a small but thoroughly
analytical digest of the subjects under consideration.
Why the writer has so constantly given the words and
opinions of far more undeniable authorities than herself, is a
fact that need scarcely be ccimmented upon.
As far as possible, the most available means of referring to
the authors quoted from, have been clearly pointed out, and
although but a tithe of the matter worthy of the true Free-
thinker’s study has been touched upon, the author feels
confident that the sum of what has already been given, will
suffice to point the way to the realization of purer faiths,
and more enduring facts, than religious history can ever
furnish to mankind, under the specious garb of clerical
authority, and the tremendous shroud of that mystery which
is the stronghold of priestly fraud and ecclesiastical
imposture.

INTRODUCTORY.


THE FAITHS, FACTS, AND FRAUDS OF
RELIGIOUS HISTORY.
SECTION I.
NATURAL AND REVEALED RELIGION.
“ The truth against the world. ”
The principal aim of the following pages, is to trace out the
primal source from whence have been derived the various
systems of theology which divide up mankind into votaries of
many conflicting faiths.
That all the diverging lines of religious opinion on earth
have proceeded from a common centre there is ample testimony
to show; and when we remember the awful sacrifice of life,
liberty, human happiness, and human brotherhood, which those
divergencies have occasioned, and the enormous cost of wealth,
time, and talent which their maintenance now involves, we can
scarcely over-estimate the importance of any discoveries which
might tend to pulverize the cruel lines of sectarian demarcation,
or calculate the illimitable benefits which might accrue to the
race, from building up a religious system whose only founda-
tion stones were divine truth and practical good.
The first questions which naturally arise in this connection
are—What is religion ? What is its special sphere of influence 1


and. from whence does its authority proceed 1 To these pre-
liminary queries we answer, that there is in humanity a
natural, original, and indestructible sense of religion, which blos-
soms out into faith in Deity, immortality, and the laws of right,
just as normally as affection, intellect, or any other of the soul’s
faculties.
Natural religion then —or that original spiritual sense which
antedates the existence of all credal faiths, and will pulsate
through the life-currents of humanity when sectarian beliefs are
blotted out from remembrance —may be defined as the belief in
a Supreme Being, the knowledge of the soul’s immortality, and
the recognition of human duties and responsibilities.
Viewed from the standpoints of its origin in human nature,
religion is, or should be, the crowning attribute and sum of all
knowledge.
The birth chamber and the death chamber are the two
portals through which every human being must pass. Whence
and witherward 1 These are the inevitable queries which every
thinking mind must propound, as it reflects upon the stupen-
dous mystery which enshrouds life’s gates of entrance and exit.
But besides these incentives to human speculation, all through
the pilgrimage by which humanity wins its way between the
two eternities, there is a viewless angel ever hovering at each
one’s side, whose voice, though differing in tone and intensity
with the varieties which mark the race, is still heard and recog-
nized by all. Men have agreed to call this unknown one
Conscience, and in accordance with the acute or blunted per-
ceptions of the listener, so does this angelic monitor remind
each one of his departure from, or obedience to, the laws of
right. There is no need to inquire what these laws are. Con-
sciousness is the handmaid of conscience, and she never fails to


write such a decalogue of right and wrong, as time and place
permit, upon those soul tablets, which all human beings carry
within them. To explain the awful mysteries of the “ whence
and witherward,” to stimulate human consciousness to a sense
of right and wrong, and awake the soul to the monitions of con-
science, are the special functions of religious systems; and no
religion, or rather form of religious faith, can claim the right to
dominate over the human soul, that does not exercise its
influence in these special directions.
Our affections, intellects, and appetites are all regulated and
unfolded by appropriate methods of culture. Society enacts
laws for the promotion of national interests, and courts of judi-
cature to protect the rights of individuals. It is essentially the
function of religion then, to administer to man’s spiritual nature,
and promote all those stupendous interests which affect the
soul here and hereafter. Ho other department of human
thought can supersede the influence of true religion, or match
the boundless range of its responsibilities. Religion is em-
phatically the science of life, and the only solution which life
past, present, or future, can find of all its mighty problems.
As religion is the highest element of life, and the highest
form of civilization should represent the noblest phase of
religion, it is to Christianity, as the faith pirofessed amongst
the most advanced of earth’s nationalities, that we should look,
to find the most perfect results of religious influence upon
human conduct.
But, in addition to this, if we assume that religious progress
keeps pace with the march of mind in every other direction,
and remember that the representative Christianity of to-day
is the culmination of 1800 years of persistent experiment, we
have the right to expect that it will manifest itself, as an


example to the whole human family, of all that is most
excellent in practice and most truthful in doctrine.
It must be remarked, however, that the faith thus pro-
fessed by the highest of civilized nations bears no relation to
the primordial and instinctive sentiment in humanity, before
described as “ natural religion.” On the contrary; Christianity
does not admit of any instinctive origin in the consciousness of
man. It does not antedate other forms of credal faith ; hr fact,
with the single exception of Mahometanism, it is the last and
most modern of all theological systems. So far from its source
existing in the efflorescence of soul growth, it claims for itself
a distinct revelation ; a revelation totally outside of human
experience, knowledge, judgment, or the known laws of nature ;
made in a comparatively recent period of the earth’s history,
to a very limited number of the human family; and that,
under conditions which the natural emotions and reasoning
faculties of the soul would inevitably revolt from.
Again ; Christianity claims as its revelator the direct agency
of a Being, of whom the finite mind can not have the faintest
conception—even the Infinite and Eternal Author of the Uni-
verse in propria personas. And this revelation is not supposed
to be made by any impression or spiritual agency common to
human experience in general, but by special procedures,
subversive of all the known laws of nature, and under such
conditions as render the possibility of testing the truth of the
allegations thus put forth impossible.
To render this position still more impregnable, all attempts
at enquiry are stifled, under the assumption that the majesty
of God is impugned by any research into, or doubt of, His
“ incomprehensible waysthat the men who claim to be the
sole interpreters of His sublime mysteries are invested with


full power to punish, torture, or kill all who dare to question
whatever they choose to allege in their God’s name ; and in an
age when the laws of nations intervene to protect human beings
against such summary methods of treatment, mankind are
scared into silence and subjection by threats of still more
horrible torments extending through all eternity. “ Believe
die ! ” has been the motto of the highest form of theological
faith, amongst the highest forms of civilization, during the first
seventeen hundred years of its domination. That cry is
changed now to—“ Believe, or be tabooed in this world, and
damned to all eternity in the next ! ” How much mankind are
gainers by the change, the spirit of the age is rapidly demon-
strating.
Now, the claims above referred to are so enormous, that if
they stood alone, and were pressed on the world’s acceptance as
the special assumptions of any one sect, they would infallibly
be rejected as the utterances of,raving lunacy or audacious
blasphemy ; but just at the very point when mankind—aroused
from its dream of blind superstition by the clarion trump of
intellectual progress —prepares itself to apply the gauge of
science and reason to the monstrous affirmations of ecclesiasti-
cism, modern research steps in and brings to light correlated
systems of belief, streaming up in full tide from the remotest
periods of antiquity, and all tending in converging lines
towards that point, in time and place, where Christianity enters
upon the scene and absorbs all former revelations, in the
impossible assumption of being their original founder.
Granted that modern discoveries, by disinterring the tombs
of ancient faiths, entirely strip Christianity of her arrogant
claim to divine favour, through an original and special reve-
lation; the problematical question still remains as to whence


arose the primeval ideas upon which all theological systems are
founded 1 To remove the source from Judea to Egypt, and
from thence back to ancient India, or even to trace its
threads of ideality to the still more antique conceptions of the
wandering Aryan, is only to complicate the difficulty, and
shift the ground plan, without explaining the significance of
of the primal legend. Why, then, do we fear to advance to
the mysterious shrine wherein the veiled “ Demiurgos ” sits
enthroned, and boldly question its nature, personality, and
right to rule 1
In this inquisition we have nothing to fear for true religion,
which, as an inherent part of human nature, will live or die
only with its author. The destruction of external forms
cannot touch the deathless soul, nor annihilate that natural
religion, which is the soul’s voice, witness, and interpreter.
Neither has humanity aught to lose, were the very corner-
stone of ecclesiasticism to crumble away into the shifting sands
from which it was formed.
As for Christianity—the apex of ecclesiastical power and
pride—what loss would accrue to humanity in her downfall 1
The ghosts of ancient faiths arise to convict her of audacious
plagiarism, and the vanished generations of eighteen centuries
return to accuse her of overwhelming the earth with oceans of
blood and tears.
She adds nothing to the science of true religion, for she
throws no light on the solemn problems of life, death, or Deity.
She elucidates no mysteries of nature, explains no causes in
harmony with science, no effects that tend to the world’s
improvement or instruction, and she would leave the race
now, as deeply steeped in sin, sorrow, violence, and wrong, as
she found it, eighteen centuries ago.


As for the brand of “ Infidel,” which she imprints on all
who presume to question her impossible assertions, or the
bugbear of eternal torment with which she has been
accustomed to stifle the arguments of her antagonists, the
thinking portion of the race is beginning to rank them in the
same category with the promissory notes which she issues,
payable in the banks of a heavenly kingdom, which no sane
man would desire to inherit.
But even if these many defalcations did not form a sufficient
inducement to urge forward the enquiry into the sources and
authenticity of ecclesiastical pretensions, the best interests of
justice, reason, common sense, and true religion, demand from
the age an analysis as searching for the discovery of truth, as
for the exposure of fraud and error ; for the restoration of pure
religion and undefiled, to a suffering and ignorant age, as for
the dethronement of blind superstition and expensive idolatry.
Let us enter upon that analysis fearlessly then, and, convinced
that there is no truth that need fear the light, and no error
that can long endure it, commence the noble warfare for truth
by considering the relations between religion and religious
systems, spiritual light and ecclesiastical darkness.
SECTION II
OF THE SABEAN SYSTEM, OR, THE ASTRONOMICAL
RELIGION.
Passing over all the ramifications of opinion into which Sec-
tarianism has broken up the distinctive faiths of history, we
find we may resolve the latter into six well-defined groups, or


x’epresentative phases of religious thought, the nomenclature of
which runs thus :—Brahminism, Buddhism, Parseeism, Judaism,
Polytheism, and Christianity. Mahometanism of course adds
a seventh to the list; hut as this form of faith stands alone,
neither borrowing from, or inrparting aught to, other systems, it
needs no special notice here. The fairly informed student of
religious history need not be reminded that there are certain
marked features pervading all the six systems enumerated above
constantly repeating themselves, with no other shadow of
variety than may be expected to result from differences in time,
climate, customs, and language.
They all combine in teaching the fall of man, or his deriva-
tion from some pre-existant and higher state of being than that
of earth.
All preserve the legend of a general flood, and predict the
final destruction of the earth by fire. All cherish faith in
one Supreme Being, the doctrine of the Trinity, and hierarchies
of subordinate spiritual existences.
The belief in the soul’s immortality and (with certain sec-
tarian modifications) faith in retribution and compensation
hereafter, for good or evil enacted here, are also items of
universal acceptance. All subdivisions of religionists supple-
ment their doctrines with codes of morals for the conduct of
humanity, and enjoin upon their- followers religions observances
in the form of sacraments, sacred days, places, garments, and
other consecrated objects.
They all set apart certain persons, who form a priestly order,
teach the efficacy of rites and ceremonials, and assume to found
their special form of faith upon special revelations from divine
sources. The most curious and important feature of universal
belief, however, is yet to be noticed, and this is, that all


shades of Sectarian religionists, whether ancient or modern,
set up for worship one central figure, whom they claim to be at
once God and man, adoring him with even more lavish rever-
ence than they accord to the Deity, yet claiming that He was
the subject of human birth, death, persecution, and martyrdom
whilst on earth.
And the mystery attendant on such a subject of worship
deepens, when we trace out the main features of the history
woven around this God-man, and find, that though each people
insist upon presenting a different personality, all, however
removed from each other in point of time or locality, maintain
certain coincident points of similarity, for which no other
account can be rendered than the fact of their origin being
O O
derived from one common source. For example : all nations,
from the most ancient Hindoo to the comparatively modern
clmstian, inculcate belief in an incarnate God-man, born of the
Supreme Being, through the maternity of a woman. The
mother in nearly every case is represented as a pure virgin, and
all the attendant circumstances are more or less miraculous.
The birthday of the Avatar is invariably fixed at mid-
winter, and the decease at spring or autumn. A royal descent
is in some mysterious way claimed, and a prophecy that the
sovereignty of the earth is to be assigned to the new-born
babe, is represented as exciting the jealousy of some reigning
Tyrant, by whom the Virgin Mother is persecuted. There is
also a putative Father introduced, who is represented as sub-
mitting complaisantly enough to the divine intrigue, which
makes his betrothed the mother of a God. By aid of this
obliging spouse, the infant is always sheltered in obscuiity
until a certain period, when, after a miraculous infancy and
boyhood, he issues forth to assume the prophetic mantle, with


all the paraphernalia of fastings, baptisms, and other such
divine signatures of favour as may be common to the country
and time.
Then succeeds a chain of miraculous performances, many of
which bear the most striking resemblance to each other when
ever detailed.
The God-man is invariably a moral teacher, and a reformer
of the prevailing abuses of the time. The same mysterious
similarity prevails in the doctrines enunciated, whether they
come in the name of Boudha, Mitlma, Zoroaster, Chrishna,
Prometheus, Balder, Hesus, Osiris, or Christ. All are
protests against the prevailing corruptions of the age, and
enunciations of those divine principles of good, which vary
not with time, and are never peculiar to place or nationality.
Then follows the last act of the drama, which is the
invariable triumph of adverse powers : a violent death—
generally a crucifixion —the proclamation that the martyrdom in
question is designed for the benefit of the race ; a descent into
hell, or the nethermost parts of the earth, to show that divine
mercy compassionates even the most degraded spirits in being ;
a short season of lamentation, always carried on by faithful
women and mourning disciples ; the whole followed by a
resurrection from the dead, a triumphant ascent into heaven,
and the installment of the miracle-working Mediator as the
future “ Judge of the dead,” and the “ Saviour of men.”
These are the main points upon which all theologies, without
exception, are founded; and though we admit there must
necessarily be certain modifications in the presentation of
this grand drama, growing out of the varieties of time and
place which distinguish the religions of different nations, the
essentia] features of the scheme (that is, the fundamental


ideas above narrated) are invariably coincident, and never fail
to re-appear.
It may be urged that we can have no means of delineating
the faith of nations whose scriptures have perished, and that
when we simply reiterate the legendary opinions that time
perpetuates, we may be liable to colour the prevailing tra-
dition by our own prepossessions.
To this we reply, that for the thorough understanding of
antique lore, we have two methods of interpretation, the com-
bination of which is quite as authentic as written history.
The first of these we obtain in a study of the Monuments,
with which the entire of the East is overlaid, and the second
in the science of philology, which, by connecting modern
tongues with their roots, or affiliations in ancient languages,
forms a chain of complete relationship between present and
past modes of expression.
Thus the very limitations which hindered the ancients from
beqrreathing written scriptures to posterity, impelled them to
engrave their ideas upon the far m ore enduring pages of stone,
enabling us to derive from the sculptured remains which con-
vert the land of the Orient into one grand, imperishable volume,
a means of testimony far transcending any written scriptures in
worth and authenticity.
"Writings may be lost, int erpolated, or tampered with in many
ways. Whole libraries of polemical literature have been wilfully
destroyed, or wilfully fabricated, for the purpose of maintaining
a favourite point of doctrine, or confuting an adversary; but
the old Temple voices of antiquity cannot lie, and the mute but
eloquent testimony of stony preachers, whose witness dates hack
through immemorial ages, proclaims, without fear or favour,
revelations which Inquisitions cannot burn or torture into


silence, nor the reckless mendacity of partisan bigotry misrepre-
sent. The venerable slabs, planispheres, and ruins of Nineveh,
the Zodiacs, Pyramids, and tombs of Egypt, the stupendous
Cave Temples of India, together •with all the colossal remains
and gorgeous mementos of vanished splendour, marred, yet not
obliterated, which combine to bear indestructible witness to the
faith of ages, and cover the earth, wherever the footprints of
civilization have left their mark—form, in their totality, a
bible, the revelations of which are becoming household words
amongst the people, in this intellectual and progressive age ;
revelations which no priest can ban out of existence, and no
bigot can longer stifle.
It is from such sources as these, as well as by consulting the
scriptures of all nations, instead of one alone, that we are
enabled to re-construct the scheme, upon which—as we shall
hereafter perceive—the entire of the world-wide systems of
theology have been upreared.
SECTION III
CONTINUATION OF THE SABEAN SYSTEM, OR, THE
ASTRONOMICAL RELIGION.
Tub learned and authoritative writers who have contributed
to elucidate the principles of the famous astronomical religion,
may now be numbered by the score, and any one of them
would afford us ample testimony to the truths of which we are
about to present a brief abstract to our readers ; but as all
modem authorities draw more or less from those inexhaustible
fountains of knowledge, supplied by the learned Dupuis in his


magnificent twelve-volume work— L’Origin de tons les Cidles,
or The Origin of all Religious Worship,” we cannot do better
than open our case by presenting the reader with such excerpts
from our great author’s work as will lay down in concise terms,
and in an almost literal translation from the French, the
scheme of which M. Dupuis has given such elaborate details.
Our excerpts will be drawn from many different portions of
the original, as we could not jiossibly obtain a connected idea
of the author’s views in such a consecutive extract as any single
volume would furnish.
In the opening chapters it is said :
“ Ancient civilization extended over a great part of Asia, a
portion of Africa, and parts of Europe.
“ The Greeks and Romans, whom we sometimes call the
ancients, knew less of the antique civilization of Egypt, India,
Asia Minor, and other Eastern lands than we do, for we learn
nothing from them on these subjects, whilst our modern
researches are adding to our stock of knowledge on ancient
civilization every day
“ There are marks of a high civilization existing throughout
India. Egypt, and Asia Minor, at periods far beyond our
means of calculation ; but, starting from an era which we may
assuredly fix at five thousand years ago, we find established
beliefs and customs prevailing, whose origin must have
antedated that epoch by many centuries at least
“ Throughout the entire of the lands of the East, including
Hindostan, Egypt, Arabia proper, ifcc., ic., ifec., are traces of
that form of antique worship, called indifferently Sabeanism,
Fire worship, Solar worship, the Astronomical system, and by
Christians designated by the general terms of ‘ Paganism’ or
‘ Heathenism.’ The truth is, one and the same system prevailed
everywhere; and, dating back from three or four thousand years
before the Christian era, it seems to have been more concrete
and uniform than in later times, when the scattering abroad of
many ancient dynasties tended to introduce new ideas, and
modify old ones, so that it would seem as if the later nations
had not received, or had departed from, the old doctrine; but


that this was not the case, our finest monuments in the older
nations of India, Assyria, and Egypt, do abundantly prove.”
In the third volume of his great work, M. Dupuis gives a
very extended list of the nations amongst whom the Sabean
system prevailed, marking especially the differences which
arose, as he judiciously infers, from local or chronological
changes; but as the pursuance of his exactitude of style would
necessitate a mass of quotation which would far surpass the
limits of this treatise, we must substitute the term “ the
ancients,” as a general synonym for the numerous Eastern
nations to whom he refers. With this single change in the
manner of quotation, we proceed :
“ The ancients worshipped the powers of nature either
directly or as leading to a superior invisible, and alhper-
vading Godhead the assumed governor, of the universe.
That the priests of Chaldea,
Babylonia, Hindostan, Egypt, and Sidonia, disclaimed any
actual worship of the things seen—or the visible order of the
universe —we have over and over again shown; but they
taught, as did the later Greeks and Romans, that these visible
signs—such as sun, moon, and stars —were necessary objects
for the vulgar to contemplate, as by them they could realize a
specific idea which was represented in their motions. The fact
that the true religion of the Sabeans was always celebrated by
the priests in mysteries, is confirmed by Cicero, Plato,
Pythagoras, and the Brahmins, who all alleged that the priests
taught of the soul or spiritual part of the universe in mysteries,
but through images, idols, and visible signs to the people.
“ The earliest nations of the earth were chiefly employed in
agriculture, and, to promote the better understanding of the
seasons, to discover which were the fitting times to sow, plant,
gather in, &c., the study of the stars—as the rulers or governors
of the seasons —became a most necessary branch of science. It
was obvious to the ancients, as to ourselves, that the sun—as
the source of heat —must be the lord of life and the author of
all that exists on the earth’s surface. His light-giving beams,
moreover, were acknowledged then, as now, to be the principle


of revealment from which we derive all knowledge and all
truth ; hence the corner stone of the ancient worship was the
sun, or rather that spiritual principle displayed in the sun’s
influence upon earth. The ancients, as I have sufficiently
explained, taught these ideas in esoteric or spiritual doctrines
for the priests, and exoteric or visible systems of worship for
the people. . . .
“ The variations in the seasons were not attributed to the
changes occasioned by the earth’s rotation, of which, as I have
before shown, the ancients were generally (though not in all
instances) ignorant. Deeming that these perplexing variations
were owing to the course of the sun through different portions
of the heavens, it naturally came to be thought that the stars,
or lesser lights, which strewed the plane of the heavens, must
be in some way influential upon the benign influence of the
solar ray. The ancients —destitute of our resources for con-
verting all seasons into benefit —cotdd not comprehend the
necessity of winter, and only realized its rule as one of famine,
desolation, and evil. Their flocks and herds, their fields and
crops, were cut off, blighted, and destroyed; and when, in
addition to atmospheric influences, fierce storms, earthquakes,
cyclones, and all the awful paraphernalia of tempestuous forces
prevailed on earth, people who attributed every phenomenon
of nature to the direct action of invisible, powerful, and un-
known intelligences, naturally enough supposed those sources
of evil must proceed from powers antagonistic to the benign
and gracious sun.” .
Following out these leading ideas, M. Dupuis goes on to
show how the ancients first set apart their wisest and most
learned men to study the heavens, discover the modes of
motion prevailing throughout the starry hosts, reduce those dis-
coveries to order, and evolve thence a chart of the sidereal
heavens, from which accurate knowledge might be obtained
concerning the seasons, their various changes, the good or
evil influences to be expected on earth, and the best means of
propitiating the unknown but terrible potentates who divided
the hemispheres amongst them, and marshalled their alternating
3


forces of astral light, in the tremendous and unceasing war of
day and night, summer and winter, and—from an assumed
moral correspondence with the physical universe—good and
evil, malign and benign influences, upon the helpless inhabi-
tants of earth.
Father Kirchen, the learned Jesuit and Egyptologist; Mr.
Bryant, the renowned author of “Eastern Antiquities,” etc.; and
Godfrey Higgins, a still more authoritative writer on these
subjects; General Hitchcock and J. F. Stewart, American
writers of no mean celebrity; Mons. Yolney, the renowned
author of “ The Ruins ; ” the Rev. Robert Taylor, in his astro-
theological lectures, and many other eminent writers on
kindred subjects, have described in detail the principles of the
celebrated Sabean system, and shown how obviously they
might have originated in most ancient times, when men were
compelled to pursue astronomical studies for the sake of guiding
and directing the activities of agriculture.
Hie advances whiph the ancients achieved in both these
branches of knowledge, are too well known and too thoroughly
demonstrated by Oriental remains, to need farther comment.
As our space will not permit us to make many quotations,
however, we will pursue our researches a little farther through
one of the most painstaking and authoritative of authors on
these subjects, and again invite our readers to follow out the
investigations of M. Dupuis. He says:—
“ The path of the sun was traced out by the ancients as
marking on the heavens an imaginary wavy line called the
ecliptic, hence the sun (assumed to be the traveller rather than
the earth) crossed the equator at two distinct points, and at the
two distinct seasons of the spring and autumn equinoxes. The
ancient planispheres and zodiacs are often found with the lines
of the equator and ecliptic correctly defined, and the equatorial


circle divided up into the then recognized 360 degrees. The
ancient astronomers based their system on the recognition that
the sun, following the wavy line of the ecliptic in the northern
hemisphere, dispensed the full force of his light and heat in the
beneficent influence of summer, but after crossing the equator
at the autumnal equinox, and sinking into the southern hemis-
phere, he became subject to the adverse powers and malignant
influences of winter. These primary divisions of the solar year
into summer and winter, formed the first grand act of the
Astral drama, evolved from the impersonation of the solar hero
into the god of the earth. Subsequently, the two main divi-
sions of the year were subdivided into the four seasons, when
it became necessary to impersonate the spring and autumn
months as heralds of the opposing powers of summer and
whiter. The belief that the stars or lesser lights were the
symbols of subordinate intelligences or angelic hierarchies,
whose influence upon the sun was potential for good or evil,
caused the ancient astronomers to map out the heavens into
groups or constellations of starry bodies, who, according to their
position whilst the sun was above or below the equator, were
supposed to be antagonistic or beneficently disposed towards
men. In this plan the wintry constellations of course signified
the adverse power ; those of summer represented the beneficent
angels. The spring constellations were the heralds of hope and
promise, those of autumn the prophets of the evil days at hand.
The path of the sun about the equator being thus defined,
the groups of stars through which his march was conducted,
came to be called ‘the zodiac,’ which signified, in ancient
Chaldee, an animal, or the living world of power through
which the earth received the life and light of godhead.
“The zodiac, as the ruler and model of the solar year, was
divided up by some of the ancients into ten, and by others into
twelve, groups or constellations of stars. Each of these corres-
ponded to, and were assumed to be, the ruling powers that
governed the months.
“It is needless to remind our readers, that the same sub-
division of the year into twelve months, symbolized at least, if
not governed by the zodiacal signs, is still preserved in our
charts and almanacs to the present time. As before explained,
the zodiacal circle was divided into three hundred and sixty


degrees; these again into four right angles of ninety degrees
each, and the whole into twelve signs, including each thirty
degrees.
“ The constellations were named, as it is supposed, chiefly from
the operations which transpired on earth at the period when
the sun passed through them. Amongst the Hebrew cabalists,
they were regarded as houses of the sun, and were called Beth-s ;
amongst the Chaldeans, the houses of the summer sun were
termed El-s, and those of winter On-s. El or A 1 signified
light, On darkness ; and these nomenclatures were ultimately
adopted by most of the Oriental nations; hence we find the
winter constellations, Angels, or houses of the sun, spoken of as
the Dragon, Appollyon, Abaddon, Dagon, etc,, whilst the
summer mansions are termed Michae/, Gabrie/, Bethe/, Dank/,
Ilaphae/, Azra el, etc., &c.
“All the names common amongst Eastern nations, having El-
or On- as terminations or prefixes, were derived from the
priesthood, who were named after the houses of the sun; or,
according as different temples of worship were dedicated to the
sun in different constellations.
“ The names assigned to the zodiacal constellations, or the
rulers of the twelve mouths, were as follows: —Aries the
Lamb governed March, the real first month of the year amongst
the ancients. The Bull was the ruler of April, because the
season of agricultural pursuits connected that animal with the
group of stars then in the ascendant. May, the season when
summer and winter are united in an almost equal division of
time between day and night, was ruled by the Twins, or
Gemini. In June, when the sun appears to undergo a sort of
retrograde motion (significantly explained in astronomy), the
constellation was named the Crab, or Cancer. The raging heat
of summer was typified by naming the July constellation the
Lion. The August constellation was called the Virgin, in
reference to the fruitfulness which prevailed at the harvest
season. The Scales, or Balances, was the title of the September
sign, to signify, once more, the equilibrium prevailing between
the hours of day and night. The Great Dragon of October,
the Archer of November, the Water-bearer, and Fishes, of
January and February, were all named in accordance with the
evil portents of the wintry months over which they presided.


“At mid-winter, or that period which now corresponds to
December in the northern hemisphere, the constellations were
supposed to correspond to a goat or ram, surrounded on all
sides by stars, which the Oriental tendency to impersonate
ideas, and image forth all things into natural forms, called the
Stable, or Manger of the Goat, Capricomus. About this con-
stellation, also, were several minor groups, the most noted of
which were termed the Virgin, being a reappearance of the
summer group, so-called from another aspect; Bootes, or
Joseph, ‘the herdsman,’ and Spica, or the ear of corn, which
the fanciful mind of the ancient astronomer placed in the hand
of the Virgin, to signify her special attribute of fruitfulness.
“ In summer, the constellation Virgo appears at the marriage
feast of the year, when the sun turns the weak water of earth
into wine ; when the earth is in the plenitude of her power,
and unites all seasons in the marriage anthem of gladness.
Her reappearance in mid-winter, in the stable of the Goat,
occasioned her to be called the ‘ Virgin about to bring forth,’
and hence the winter Virgo represents the mother of the
young newly-born sun, she who ‘ brings forth,’ in the stable
of Capricomus, ‘ Virgini partnrae.’ ”
In order to make the elaborate description of the Solar
scheme, which M. Dupuis has distributed through several
volumes, somewhat more clear to the reader than we could do
by fragmentary excerpts, we will now give the condensed plan,
rendered by the celebrated Anacalypsis of Godfrey Higgins,
in which we shall find the most direct and unmistakable
definition of the entire subject.
Mr. Higgins agrees with Volney and Dupuis in the belief,
that the sun, as the central figure of the starry heavens,
became to the ancients the representative of the Deific plan
on earth, so that the path of the sun, and his “ adventures ”
through the zodiacal circle, formed the grand scheme of the
heavens, the sun being at once the hero of the sublime
legend and the visible symbol of the invisible principle of
Deific good.


Commencing with the mid-winter constellation of Capri-
corn, the sun is first introduced on the gorgeous theatre
of the starry universe as a new-born babe, conceived through
the maternity of a pure virgin (the constellation of the
wintry Virgo)—because, says Dupuis, “ The virgin and child
represented the vigour of nature in peopling the earth, of which
perpetual virginity, not destroyed by procreation, affords a
poetical idea; also, it suggests the resurrection of the dead,
annually renewed, in the return of mid-winter day each year,
an acceptable and universal type amongst the ancients, of
God’s best gift to man of immortality unquenched by death.
. . . . The same figure, sculptured for the heathen
amongst the Hindoos, Eg3 T ptians, Syrians, Assyrians, and
others, has since served for the Virgin Mary in our Christian
religion.
“ The heathen or ancient Virgin forms a prominent figure
among the constellations, and, in their beautiful fables, was
presumed to bring forth a son annually, as the season
(Christmas) came round, when the sun awakening from the
death of winter first began to rise towards the spring solstice.
This feast of the ancients—celebrated even as early as amongst
the Aryans at mid-winter—has been transferred to the
Christian religion, and adapted to Jesus by the Catholic and
Episcopal churches; the Scotch, and some dissenting parties to
the above churches, refuse the application, and do not keep
Christmas day, repeating the allegation of Celsus and other
Greek philosophers, that it was held sacred only as the birth
of the sun, and Christians betrayed the origin of their legend
only too surely when they adopted that day as the birthday of
their God.”
To return to Godfrey Higgins. He next describes how the
months of January and February were deemed under the
dominion of the evil wintry stars, because the sun was then
comparatively hidden or obscured by the storms and tempests
provoked by the lord of winter, the adversary, typified by
Aquarius, the water-bearer, who pours out the vials of his
wrath upon the earth. Pisces (the fishes) represents the
young children whom the wintry tyrant slays, in the hope of


destroying tlie new-born child of the virgin, who is to reign as
the king of heaven, and subvert the power of the wintry god.
In some of the allegorical sculptures of the East, the zodiacal
sign of the fishes is changed to multitudes of infants’ heads,
and the sign is dedicated to the “ Innocents.” During these
two evil months the new-born sun is hidden, or carried away
into concealment by his mother Mary, Marc, or Maria,
all synonyms for the sea, from which the spring Venus,
the mother of forms, is assumed to rise—Joseph (Bootes),
the bright constellation named the herdsman, being in
close relation to the wintry virgin, is called her betrothed,
and aids her in her flight to conceal the young child.
In March, when the genial season of spring is heralded in by
the appearance of the young lambs of the field, the constellation
Aries—the lamb—is in the ascendant. At this point the sun
crosses the equator, ascending from the darkness and conceal-
ment of the Southern hemisphere, into the triumphant North, so
full of hope, promise, and renovation to the earth, groaning
under the tyranny of the wintry season.
After the sun crosses the vernal equinox, the earth is re-
deemed—the darkness ends—famine, want, suffering, and cold
lose their sway; hence, the cross is the sign of this great
redemption; the lamb is the redemptive symbol, and the sun him-
self, coming forth from the wilderness of fasting and famine—
baptized by the advent month, Februai-y, dedicated to purifica-
tion by water—begins his career as a miracle worker, healer,
and redeemer. He passes through the sign of Gemini, or
brotherhood, conquers the retrogression of the wandering
disciples in June—signified by Cancer the crab—and shines
out as the sun of righteousness, in the royal sign of the mid-
summer Lion. We next see him at the marriage supper of the


year, when in conjunction with the virgin mother (the mid-sum-
mer Virgo), he turns water into wine, feeds multitudes from
the five loaves of the wintry months, and the small fishes—now
converted into the plentiful harvest sufficient to feed all comers ;
heals the sick, cures the afflicted, preaches peace on earth and
good-will to men, until the adverse signs of winter appear,
heralded in by Lucifer—the bright and beautiful star, that in
the spring was Vesper the evening star, and now in autumn,
fallen from the high place, or seat of pride in the northern hori-
zon, appears low down on the edge of the southern hemisphere,
and, by virtue of this descent, is called “ Lucifer, the star of the
morning.” “No portion of the famous astronomical myth has
furnished forth more food for the poetical imagery in which the
Oriental mind delights to adorn its metaphors, than this appari-
tion of the fallen star Lucifer,” says Dupuis. Higgins also,
and General Hitchcock in his fine treatise on biblical astronomy,
dwell with particular emphasis on the myths and legends con-
nected with this renowned astral conjunction. Higgins goes
on to depict the position of the constellations at this juncture, as
ominous of woe and destruction to the power of the solar hero
of the skies. “ Now enters in,” says he, “ the Great Dragon of
the skies, the largest of all the zodiacal constellations, sometimes
known as the Scorpion, but more especially famed as the
Oriental Dragon; the long train of stars which follow in
his wake giving birth to the myth of ‘ the war in heaven,’
in which ‘ the old serpent, the devil and Satan,’ or the adversary,
contend with Michael the prince of light, and drags down in his
fall one-third of the hosts of heaven.” The mythos here obviously
confound Lucifer and the Dragon, but the ancient astronomers
expressly depict Lucifer as a single star, one and the same with .
Vesper the evening star of spring. In his fall he is the leader


of the hosts commanded by the Dragon, in ■ whose train are
numbered one-third of the heavenly host.
Bryant in his “Astronomy of the Ancients,” the Jewish
cabalists, and many of the learned Gnostic writers, all combine
in drawing this distinction in favour of Lucifer, as the
leader of the rebel hosts, and place the Dragon simply as the
follower; in fact, the Apocalypse of St. John is the only
ancient authority (and this can scarcely be considered as an
antique scripture) which confounds the starry personalities of
Lucifer and the Dragon. The two—say Dupuis and Higgins
both—are distinct, and “ their personality cannot be con-
founded by those who desire to master the true secret of the
solar legend.” After the ascent of these ominous influences
into the seats of power, the career of the Sun-God becomes
one of woe and trial. “ Gethsemane, Calvary—even the
judgment-hall of Pilate, the crowing cock, the denial of the
faithless Peter—all are found in the complications of the
•astral legend.” So say our various authorities, and so writes
Henry Melville, in his elaborate key to the astronomical
mysteries, recently published in London, under the title of
“Yeritas.” But the final act of the divine drama is the
crossitication of the sun, who, in his descent or passage across
the equator to the Southern hemisphere, is always represented
as crucified between the two evil months of November and
December. The angels of the December month indeed relent,
or become penitent, and, in token of their pity for their victim,
give place to the angels of the mid-winter constellation,
Capricorn, who furnishes a shelter for “ the Virgin, about to
bring forth,” in his stable or manger.
For three days at mid-win ter, or as some legends affirm for
one only, the Sun is lost, i.e., stands still—when the weak and


shrouded character of his influence is represented as his
descent into the grave; by other legends, as his descent into
hell, the nethermost parts of the earth, the locale of which
was only vaguely realized hy the ancients. They believed that
the mysterious Southern realms into which the beneficent light-
bringer’s rays had sunk, was the fabled hell of their fertile
imagination, and as they peopled every region with living
entities, so they taught that their adored Sun-God had gone on
the merciful errand of preaching to the evil spirits, imprisoned
for punishment in hell, or the nethermost parts of the earth.
For a given period of time, the ancients mourned their hero
dead; but even in the midst of their lamentations, loving
women (the constellations of the Andromeda group) bring
the glad tidings that the new-born sun will be resur-
rected, and brought to periodic life, through the annual
maternity of the ever Virgin mother, the sea, the Mare, Maria,
Mary —mother of forms; in a word, that the Saviour of men
is born in a manger, or the stable of the goat Capricomus,
a sign which, in all nations dominated by the famous
astronomical religion, was revered as the symbol of God—the
Zeus of the Greeks, the Ammon of the Egyptians, the Brahm
of the Hindoos, the Unknown or Unknowable of Plato, the
“ Father ” of the Christian Trimurti.


SECTION IV.
OF THE HELIOCENTRIC SYSTEM; OR, THE ANCIENT
NEROSES.
When or how the first priests of antiquity began to interpret
“ the fiery scriptures of the skies,” and spell out the unbroken
lines of correspondence between the heavens and the earth, we
have no means of determining. All we know is, that the
most ancient, as well as authentic of historians, date their
earliest records from periods when Hindostan was grey with
the accumulation of untold ages, and Egypt had long passed
the culminating heights of her splendid civilization.
Assyria, Babylonia, Phoenicia, and all the great dynasties
of the Orient were sinking into the night of decay, and point-
ing back into an unknown “ long ago,” when first the
“Thoth”* of antiquity took pen in hand to inscribe their
histories.
When the Grecian sage, Solon, visited Egypt to become an
auditor of its then renowned priesthood, and referred to what
he deemed the most ancient of all eras, that of the Deucalion
Deluge, one of the oldest of the priests rebuked him in the
memorable words recorded by Plato : —“ Solon, Solon, you
Greeks are always children; you mention one deluge, whereas
many have happened.”
In confirmation of all other testimony, oral and written,
ancient and modern, the stupendous ruins scattered profusely
throughout the lands of the East bear -witness to the very
remote periods of time during which the ancients pursued their
* Thoth —The name assigned in Egyptian mythology to the secretary
of the gods.


astronomical studies, and the thousands of years they
employed in framing and elaborating their vast system of solar
worship.
Yale, in his abridgement of Dupuis on the Apocalypse,
says :—“ We trace the existence of the Zodiac for six thousand
years, and we possess, in India alone, magnificent astronomical
remains nearly up to that period.”
Within the last century, the researches of Sir Wm. Jones,
Colebrooke, Maurice, and other eminent Orientalists, by throwing
open wider fields of observation to the scholar, deepen our
astonishment at the achievements of the antique mind, and
the correctness of its astronomical calculations.
One of the most remarkable and startling of these ancient
astronomical discoveries was that of the “ precession of the
equinoxes,” and the division of immense epochs of time into
cycles, marked by the motions of the solar and astral bodies.
Writing of that curious piece of composite sculpture, the
Sphinx, Baillie, in his celebrated work on “ The Astronomy of
the Ancients,” brings forward many plausible arguments to prove
that it was designed in the most remote periods of antiquity
to record the precession of the equinoxes. This author says:—
“ The seasons were formerly symbolized by the four signs most
significant of the operations proceeding on earth—namely, the
Bull, the Lion, the Eagle, and the Man. That these signs
were the evangelists or recorders of the sun’s passage through
the heavens during the solar year, we have ample testimony,
oven in the fact that the, early Christian historians adopted
them to symbolize Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the
evangelistic historians of Christ; but the sun holds a very
different relation to the signs now to what he did five thousand
years ago. This change;, together with corresponding varia-
tions in the order of the seasons, is occasioned by an apparent
slow forward motion of all the stars round the poles of the


ecliptic, called the precession of the equinoxes. And this
actual position of the sun in the seasons, affords us the best
evidence that astronomy was understood and identified with
the worship of the ancients five thousand years ago. . .
Now, in connection with this advance of the stars, about the
poles of the ecliptic, the sun appears to fall back or retrograde,
a change not appreciable from day to day, or year to year,
until we come to reckon about nineteen years, when it will be
seen that the sun has retrograded, or the stars advanced, a
well-defined section of a degree.” Dupuis, following up the
same subject, says:—“ The sun formerly crossed the equator
near Aldebaren, in the Bull’s eye, at spring. It obtained its
greatest elevation, therefore, near Eegulus, in the heart of the
Lion, at mid-summer, and its greatest southern declination at
mid-winter in Aquarius, or the Water-bearer.”
Owing to the forward movement of the stars, above
referred to as the precession of the equinoxes, the sun now
crosses the vernal equinox in Aries, instead of, as formerly, in
Taurus, in spring, and falls back to the sign of the Lion in
mid-summer, instead of its former place in Virgo.
To effect the exchange of even a single sign, the ancients
allowed a period varying, in different methods of calculation,
from 2,000 to 2,160 years. It is evident, then, that their
astronomical observations must have been handed down through
many generations, and have extended over vast periods of
time. Those who correctly understand the precession of the
equinoxes, can find the exact position of the stars at any
remote period of past time, and it is by comparing the ancient
zodiacs with our modern systems of calculation, and determining
what must have been the position of the sun in relation to the
constellations when those zodiacs were fashioned, that we are
enabled to understand how very far the ancients must have
advanced in astronomical knowledge at the time when we
stigmatize them as barbarians and heathens.


To celebrate the precession of the equinoxes, and erect an
enduring witness of its having been observed, the ancients
invented the singular monument called the Sphinx, in which
will be found graphically depicted a compound of the two
mid-summer signs through which the sun had been known to
pass —namely, the Lion and the Woman. To fix the idea still
more clearly in the order of solar worship, its priests instituted
a grand festival at mid-summer, or, rather, changed the original
character of the harvest festivities of mid-summer into what
they called the marriage feast of the year. Innumerable are
the legends which grew out of this celebration. The Greek
festival of Ceres, the patroness of the harvest season ; the
Bacchanalia in honour of Bacchus, the god of the vintage ; but,
above all, a mythical marriage of the seasons, typified by the
union of the masculine and feminine forms combined in the
Sphinx, were some out of many other appropriate ceremonial
rites by which the ancients solemnized the beneficent influence
of the sun in the summer solstice, and recorded the important
changes which his position in the heavens occasioned.
Dupuis, Volney, and other learned authors of the rationalistic
school, point with deep significance to the narrative of the
“ Marriage supper at Cana in Galilee,” when the Jewish
Messiah, by turning water into wine, recalls, in many of its
essential features, the celebrated marriage festival of the
ancients, at which the same feat was supposed to occur —
symbolical of the beneficent change which the miracle-working
sun effected in ushering in the grape harvest.
Both Dupuis and Godfrey Higgins allude to the symbolical
rites of the ancient mysteries practised at the mid-summer
season, and claim that from thence arose the idea of feeding
vast multitudes with five loaves and two small fishes —the


loaves?, as in the festivities of the Grecian goddess Ceres, cele-
brating the growth and expansion of five ears of com into an
abundant harvest, and the fishes representing the watery signs
of the Pisces of February, changed into the grape harvest of
summer. Both these learned authors trace the origin of the
modem society of Freemasons to the ancient mysteries, and
claim that their St. John’s Day, besides the entire formulae of
their rites and ceremonials, are vestiges of the ancient astro-
nomical legend, in which the adventures, death, resurrection,
and annual birth of the sun during the solar year form the
basis alike of the ancient mysteries and the modern order.
The discovery of the precession of the equinoxes must have
been made in the remotest periods of antiquity, as is proved
by the existence of long rows of colossal sphinxes, leading to
temples of unknown date, whose origin is lost in the night of
pre-historic ages.
We can but conjecture the processes by which the ancient
priests arrived at this discovery; but Dupuis assumes that it
arose from the fact, that the feasts which had been originally
established to celebrate the sun’s entrance into some particular
part of the heavens, in course of time began to fail in their
application.
The solar hero of the astronomical legend was found to have
receded in his annual march, or the constellations through
1 O
which he passed had changed their ancient relations to him.
To correct these perplexing aberrations, the persevering
researches of many generations must have been brought into
operation; the result was, the discovery of the equinoctial
precession, a motion of the heavenly bodies now recognized by
modem astronomers, and one which still engages the attention
of the most philosophic observers.


In connexion with this complicated astronomical phenomenon,
the following extract from the great work of Dupuis— L'Origin
de tons les Cidles —may be read with interest;—
“ The ancients found that the sun, starting from the equator
at spring at an angle of twenty-three and a half degrees to the
north and east, after traversing all the signs, at the next year
crosses the equator fifty-two seconds of a degree short of a com-
plete circle ; and this phenomenon is of constant recurrence, the
sun re-crossing the vernal equinox every year fifty-two seconds of
a degree less of the circle than the year before. . . . The
stars, too, are found to advance—not on the line of the equator,
and about the north and south poles, but on the line of the eel iptic,
and about the ecliptic poles; so that the stars shift their places
in regard to the equator, both in advance to the east, called
eighth ascension, and also to the north and south of the
equator called declination, so that, by this motion, stars once
south of the equator, are now north, and those formerly a little
north are now more north Even the north
star is making a circle round the pole of the ecliptic.”
That the ancients knew and accurately calculated these
complicated movements we may be assured by a careful study
of their zodiacs, planispheres, statuary, and the legends by
which they so sedulously strove to celebrate these motions.
Another striking evidence of the mastery of the most difficult
astronomical problems is proved in the accuracy by which the
ancients calculated and predicted the periods of eclipses, a
condition of the heavenly bodies, which, as wo shall hereafter
see, gave rise to the extraordinary legend of Divine Incarna-
tions, or the births of God-men. Dupuis says:—“We have
no proof that the ancients knew the minute motions of the
moon, for she is subject to certain changes only to be
understood by later discoveries; but they had arrived at
correct methods of calculating eclipses, and discovered, with
astonishing precision, the periods when certain astronomical


phenomena would recur. These recurrences they called cycles,
Neros, or Neroses. They are generally given in round
numbers as to years, days, hours, and minutes, but there still
remain fractions by way of correction. The Egyptians, and
their most apt scholar, Pythagoras, evidently understood these
fractional variations, and knew well how to correct them.”
The simplest and most easily ascertained of the cycles were, of
course, the seasons, the changes of the moon, and the place of
the sun in reference to the constellations of the zodiac
throughout the solar year. As soon as the precession of the
equinoxes was definitely ascertained, and the priests of one
generation began to consult the observations recorded in
earlier ages, a fresh set of phenomena dawned upon the
student, and ultimately became resolved into an elaborate and
complex scheme of vastly extended cycles or Neroses.
The first of these occurred every nineteen years, when it was
found that the sun had fallen back a certain section of a
degree on the plane of the ecliptic.
Passing over many less important epochs recorded in the
scheme, we next notice the completed cycle of six hundred
years, when it was found that the sun and moon appeared in
■the heavens in that remarkable conjunction which, to the
fertile imagination of the ancients, signified far more than the
inevitable eclipse which such a position would occasion. It
must be remembered that the sun was esteemed in the
astronomical scheme as a masculine symbol of Deity, the
visible representative of the Lord of life, the Creator of forms,
and the Father of men. The moon, on the contrary, was, by
most of the ancients (though not by all), regarded as the
emblem of the feminine or receptive principle, and, as
approximating next in size and importance to the majestic
4


sun, she was hailed as the symbol of maternity, the repre-
sentative of the earth and nature, and thus designated Astarte,
Queen of Heaven, Isis, Diana, etc., etc.
The apparition of these two celestial luminaries in periodical
conjunction gave rise to that most extraordinary and important
of all the astronomical myths—namely, the belief that at this
epoch a divine man, or “ Son of God,” would be born, whose
celestial history was to correspond literally with that of the
parent sun in his travels through the zodiacal signs of the
solar year, whilst his incarnation on earth was to give him a
history more or less in accordance with the solar legend ; cause
the foundation of a new sect, restore a sinful race to divine
favour in his character of mediator, reform the corruptions of
the age, and especially of an effete and arrogant priesthood,
and generally enact the role of God and man, assigned to the
numerous Avatars of ancient history.
To appreciate the acceptance of this stupendous myth by
any sane mind, whether in ancient or modern times, as an
actuality, it must be remembered that the ancients were
accustomed to impersonate the powers of nature, and regard
sun, moon, stars, earth, elements, and all the other potencies of
the universe visible expressions of invisible spiritual intelli-
gences.
The belief that the external universe was but the symbol,
and not the actuality of the Deific or Angelic existence, con-
stituted the heart of the ancient mysteries, formed the esoteric
doctrine of a learned and philosophic order of priests, and still
enabled them to govern the ignorant multitude by attributing
mysterious sanctity to the visible signs. It was unquestionably
in this spirit, that so many of them permitted a system of
adoration to be offered to idols, and ceremonials to be practised,


against the gross superstitions of which their more highly-
informed reason and judgment revolted.
The calculation of eclipses, and the accuracy with which these
wily astronomers predicted the changes that would ensue in the
heavenly bodies, and their correspondential results on earth, in-
spired the people with full confidence in their teachers ; induced
the belief that they were in direct communication with the gods,
and could propitiate their favour, or appease their wrath, by the
favourite and time-honoured custom of vicarious sacrifices for
sin.
We need not pause upon the details of this well-known sys-
tem of priestcraft, nor does our space permit us to enlarge upon
the wide distinctions of belief which obtained, in the esoteric
religion of the priests, and the exoteric superstitions impressed
upon the people. It is enough to remember, that the true
moaning of antique worship was carefully veiled from the vulgar
mind in solemn mysteries, hence it is fair to infer that the
philosophers of Greece and Rome were right when they alleged
“ that belief in the gods was a necessary item in the government
of the people, but was only a subject of ridicule and contempt
amongst the enlightened
How far the celebrants of the ancient mysteries believed in
the actual birth of a God-man from the conjunction of heavenly
bodies, whose periodic recurrences of position had been defined
for thousands of years, we need not now pause to enquire;
enough, that such a doctrine was universally taught by the
priests of antiquity, hence the grand Xeros of the six-hundredth
year was regarded as one of the most stupendous in the whole
astronomical scheme, and the legend founded on it has become
the central figure of all the theological systems that have suc-
ceeded each other, from the first institution of the Brahminical


order to' the last installment of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
or the Pope of Rome.
We shall presently show, by numerous extracts, that the
ancients placed the birth periods of all their Avatars, or incarnate
gods, at the close of the six-hundredth cycle, or about the time
when the periodical conjunction of the heavenly bodies above
alluded to favoured the idea of some great correspondential
changes being acted out upon earth. It is not surprising,
therefore, that, at or about the time when these solar conjunc-
tions were predicted, the people as invariably expected a new
Messiah, or God-man, to descend from heaven, and be bom
amongst them, according to the traditions of past ages, as they
deemed that the Deific principles of creation were symbolized,
if not actually impersonated, in the mysterious luminaries of
the skies.
The spirit of anticipation thus fostered by the priests, and
sanctioned by the most sacred traditional beliefs, tended to
invest any exceptionally great reformer or inspired prophet
who might chance to be bom about the close of the six-
hundredth Neros—with all the Messianic attributes. Such
individuals were generally adopted by a sect of enthusiasts,
and though they were just as frequently persecuted by one
party as adored by another, the deeply rooted faith of the
multitude sufficed to convert every incident of the new
Avatar’s life into additional proof of his divine origin.
Even the martyr’s death, which so often closed the career of
such individuals, was but a fresh point of similitude with the
legend of the Sun-God. Thus it was, after the curtain had
fallen on the earthly portion of the drama, its scene of action
was exalted to the skies; the fervid zeal of partisanship
composed such a biography of the new Avatar as would


■“ fulfil the scriptures ” of older incarnations, always taking
•care to make it conform in every particular to the famous solar
myth, and thus was handed down to posterity the paradox of
a possible existence, with an impossible history; records of a
being, like the woman of the Apocalypse, clothed with sun,
moon, and stars; a man metamorphosed into an astral monster,
and a God degraded into an ideal man.
Reserving for future sections a more direct application of
this famous myth to the different religious systems of history,
and again passing over a record of many other subordinate
epochs of the Neroses, we come to the three final configurations
of the heavenly bodies, which completed the calculations of the
ancient astronomers, and closed up the marvellous scheme
which their untiring observations had discovered.
The first of these, after the establishment of the six hun-
dredth cycle above referred to, was the precession of the equinoxes,
or the complete transition of the sun from one sign to another,
a movement which has been before referred to, and which
different nations recorded as occurring between the periods of
2,000 and 2,1 GO years. The next most important Neros of the
astronomical scheme occurred at the close of every six thousand
years, when the precession of the equinoxes would occasion a
complete change in the earth’s polar axis, when the planes of
the ecliptic and the equator would almost coincide ; and, as the
result of the tremendous and revulsive physical changes which
must necessarily ensue upon any given spot of earth, the
popular belief obtained that the world would be destroyed again,
as it had been before, by the alternate action of flood and fire.
To account for the universality of man’s faith in this terrible
legend, it is necessary to recall the conditions of ignorance
which prevailed in ancient days, concerning the extent of the


earth’s surface, and the variety of its 2>eoples. The population
of OHental nations were accustomed to calculate the effects of
any great physical changes only on that portion of the globe
known to themselves.
Understanding, therefore, that the change of the polar axis
which must ensue under the configuration of the heavenly
bodies above alluded to, would bring their own favoured land
either into the desolation of the Arctic north, or sink it to the
“nethermost regions” of the south, which their untaught fancy
depicted as the realms of insufferable heat, they naturally
enough conceived the idea of the earth being destroyed by
the dreadful alternations of fire and flood. It was on this
basis that the Hindoos constructed their celebrated doctrine of
the four ages, “ Yugs,” or cycles of time, in each of which they
taught that the human race would become more and more
degenerate, and the earth hasten on, with ever-increasing
momentum, to the final consummation of its present state of
being.
This theory re-affirmed the scheme of the Neroses, and the
belief in the alternate destructions and renovations of the
earth by fire and flood at the close of every six thousand
years.
The philosophers of all ancient nations taught that these
stupendous changes in the polar axis would break up the icy
regions of the north, submerging the earth beneath an
universal flood, or precipitating what was then the land
of the east into the unknown regions of the south—the
land of fire and desolation, also the scene of the
fabled Gehenna of lost souls. The four great cycular changes
thus described, culminated in the last and most stupendous of
all the Neroses included in the famous astronomical system, and


this was defined as occurring at the end of every twenty-five
thousand years, when the precession of the equinoxes would
have earned the solar hero through the whole of the zodiacal
constellations. This formed the great astronomical year of the
ancients, about the close of which clustered every idea which
the wildest flights of the metaphysician could conceive of,
or the heated dreams of fervid enthusiasm image forth.
The final judgment-day would then arrive ; the elements melt
with fervent heat, the heavens shrivel together like a scroll, and
all the gorgeous pageantry of an apocalyptic millennium set in.
The visions of an Ezekiel, Daniel, and John, would find their
realization in the awful wrecks of time and space ; but “ the
new heaven and the new earth ” would, pheenix-like, spring up
from the ashes of a destroyed world, and the reign of a trium-
phant Messiah would inaugurate the long-promised kingdom of
heaven upon earth, sending creation forward on its path of
inconceivable glory, through the unknown cycles of eternity.
SECTION V.
REVIEW OF THE SABEAN AND HELIOCENTRIC SYSTEMS.
Although the subjects treated of in the preceding pages may
be familiar enough to those who have carefully studied the
literature and religious systems of the ancients, they are too
strange to the general mass of readers to be apprehended readily,
without concise methods of narration, and some reiteration.
It is for these reasons that we have substituted condensed
statements, for the elaborate writings of Dupuis and Higgins,


and, with a similar end in view, shall now summarize the
scheme which has already been detailed.
If our readers have fully mastered the ideas we have aimed
to present, they may content themselves by passing over the
next few pages; but, if, on the contrary, they have yet to
combine in one ideal grasp the full proportions of the
astonishing and elaborate system touched upon, it may assist
the mind to rehearse its principal features in the following
brief compendium:—
The ancients evidently believed that “ the skies ” formed the
plane upon which the whole order of creation, providential
government, law and being, both here and hereafter, were
mapped out; and religion, to their apprehension, consisted in the
study of this grand chart, and its application to human life
and actions. In this belief, the sun, as the largest and most
powerful of the heavenly bodies, was the central figure, and
constituted the masculine representative of the ci’eative energy,
and the source and giver, as well as the ruler and sustainer, of
life.
The moon, as the next in size and importance of the “ celestial
host,” was the symbol of the feminine principle, and was
invested with all the attributes of universal maternity.
The stars which clustered around the sun’s path, called the
Ecliptic, were grouped into constellations, named after the
activities seasonable to the several months of the year, invested
with an imaginary correspondence between moral and physical
attributes, and their whole groupings arranged into a consecu-
tive legend, which formed the solar drama enacted by the sun’s
passage through them during the twelve subdivisions, or
months of the year. Perhaps the ancients would never have
carried their ideas beyond the fanciful symbolism growing out


of the sun’s annual passage through the twelve zodiacal signs,
and the moral correspondence in which they seemed to read
the destiny of man, here and hereafter, had they not made the
discovery that the sun every year crossed the vernal equinox
52 seconds of a degree later than on the preceding year, thus
proving beyond all doubt, or peradventure either, that the sun
was falling back on the plane of the ecliptic, or that the stars,
through which his pathway lay, were advancing.
This discovery, since called “ the precession of the equinoxes,”
compelled them to alter the many feasts and ceremonials which
they had established in reference to the seasons, and other
points of the sun’s annual journey. In process of ages, how-
ever, the records of past generations compelled the belief that
the whole of the astral and solar orbs were in motion, and that
various complicated movements, differing in speed and direc-
tion, were constantly transpiring between the sun, moon, and
stars, as well as in their relations to the earth, and the physical
changes which they produced upon its surface. The sum of
all these stupendous discoveries ultimated in establishing, in
unknown ages of the remotest antiquity, the heliocentric
system, sometimes called the Neroses, or cycular periods. These
Neroses were divisions of time into periods marked by some
great change or notable conjunction in the heavenly bodies, at
each of which it was assumed corresponding changes must ensue
upon earth, algo in the attitude of Deity towards man, and the
destinies of man and his planet.
As the ancient mode of dividing up the year into months
was regulated by the moon, the cycles were formed of “ luni-
solar” periods, and the first marked change, or Neros, occurred
at or about the end of nineteen years, when the sun had
receded a special section of a degree on the plane of the


ecliptic. The next Xeros of great importance was fixed at the-
close of every six hundred years, when the sun and moon
appeared in the heavens in that particular conjunction or direct
line, which, to the figurative imagination of the ancients,
suggested the idea of a new divine birth- —the advent or
renewed incarnation of the “ Son of God,” from whence, by
correspondence between the earth and the skies, it was inferred
that the newly-born Avatar was to descend to earth, be born
of a woman, and thus become both God and man ; that his
mission in this mysterious incarnation was to reform the
world, establish a new sect, set a fresh example of righteousness
to mortals, and by his birth, life, sufferings, and death in
human form, become a propitiatory sacrifice to an offended
Deity for the sins of a degraded and degenerate race.
All the “ incarnate gods ” of antiquity were claimed to
be born only after the masculine symbol of Deity, the sun,
and his feminine counterpart, the moon, had thus appeared in
heavenly conjunction. This was only (as before noted) at the
Xeros of the six hundredth year; and if the earth did not at
that period furnish any individual, pure and powerful enough
to become the hero of the great solar legend, a fictitious history
was invented, and this, in after ages, formed just as good a
substratum of ecclesiastical history as a genuine earth-born
mortal could have afforded.
After a sufficient time had elapsed to revive the cycular
legend, give birth to a new sect, permit the hero of the skies to
return to his blest abode in heaven, and sit at the right hand
of God as judge of the dead, his history was published
abroad, and the old religion revived to fit the new incarnation,
but always in such a form as would exactly accord with the
famous solar legend, and prove the late Avatar to have been an


actual impersonation of the sun in his annual journey through
the twelve zodiacal signs.
The next important Xeros was celebrated at the end of
every 2,160 years, when the sun had passed completely through
one sign, and retrograded to another, compelling his ancient
worshippers to alter the date of their feasts, and change the
symbols by which they signified the seasons.
The next Xeros occurred at the end of every six thousand
years, when the sun, by passing through three entire signs, had,
together with the change of the constellations, so altered the
earth’s polar axis as to bring the east and west to the place
formerly occupied by the north and south.
In this tremendous physical change, the inevitable breaking up
of what must have once been the Arctic and Antarctic regions,
and the consequent melting of the ice-fields, would necessarily
submerge large portions of the earth beneath those immense
Hoods, which were analogous, in the imagination of the ancients,
to its complete destruction by water. As the Xeros of six
thousand years must occur four times for the sun to complete
his long solar journey through the whole of the twelve constella-
tions, so the ancients divided up a grand astronomical year of
twenty-five thousand solar years, into four cycles of six thou-
sand and fractional parts in each. These were their four-
grand ages of the earth’s present life, at the close of which the
last and most stupendous of all the Xeroses set in—namely, the
completion of the astronomical year of twenty-five thousand
solar years, when the sun would return to the sign from
whence he set out; when the end of all created things would
ensue, followed by a general judgment, a millennial reign, and
all the Apocryphal paraphernalia of “the new heaven and the
new earth ” before alluded to.


In the brief summary herewith presented of the heliocentric
system, we must not be understood to give either a detailed
account of the ancient or a scientific representation of the
modern scheme. We only point to its existence, and the re-
lations it bore to those theological principles, which have since
been claimed to proceed from the direct revelation of God and
■“ His only-begotten Son. ” Whilst all ancient nations enter-
tained the idea of dividing time by solar and astral phenomena,
their means of making correct calculations were far more
limited than they are in the present age of scientific attain-
ment. The system of Neroses, taught by the Chaldeans,
Hindoos, Egyptians, Siamese, Chinese, Greeks, Romans, &c.,
Ac., although approximating within a few years of each other
in results, and dividing up the recurrence of eclipses and other
celestial phenomena upon generally correct modes of obser-
vation, were still variable in the calculation of long periods,
and depended for data mainly on the records that were trans-
mitted from generation to generation. Fortunately, the ancients
were lavish and indefatigable in their efforts to transmit the
results of their observations to posterity, by means of splendid
monuments, engraved zodiacs, planispheres, and colossal
imagery, temples, and inscriptions —the records of which, as
before remarked, transcend in value and authenticity any, or
all, of the more perishable records of later times. To one fact,
however, all researches into the religious vestiges of antiquity
bear indisputable record—that is, that every form of theological
belief has been derived from the impersonation of astronomical
signs and the motions of the heavenly bodies.
The more diligently we search into the source of theological
affirmations, the more inevitably we are driven to the con-
clusion that religious rites and personages are embodied


astronomical ideas only. Tims, the ancients taught that day
and night, as the symbols of good and evil, must be ruled over
by good and evil angels. All the divisions of time, like the
hours and seasons, though founded upon astral order, were
assumed to have a moral correspondence in human action, and
be influenced by tutelary angels from the realms of light or
darkness. The days of the week were dedicated to planets,
which subsequently became identified with the gods supposed
to rule them. Months were but the records of lunar journeys;
seasons, the milestones which marked the solar highway; Neros
of years, centuries, and ages, were regarded as incidents in the
life and labours of a sun deity; and the whole order of the
heavens constituted the scenes, acts, and personages of a grand
drama, in which the earth was the stage, the constellations
the dramatis persona, infinity the scene, and eternity the
period of action. In a word, theology, with all its rites and
mysteries, is astronomy in action, and ecclesiasticism is the
play, composed of its legends and myths impersonated.
Gen. Hitchcock, in his fine work on Biblical Astronomy,
called “ Christ the Spirit,” says : —“ The Chinese, Siamese,
Syrians, Assyrians, Tyrians, Phoenicians, Babylonians, and
Chaldeans, understood and recorded their knowledge of the
heliocentric system of cycles as accurately as did the Hindoos,
Egyptians, or the more modern Greeks and Eomans. Indeed,
Baillie, Higgins, Faber, and Cassini the astronomer, consider
that the Siamese possessed a more accurate knowledge of the
Neroses, and calculated them with greater exactitude than even
the Egyptians.” Be this as it may, the parity of the scheme
in all lands, and its result in a legendary system of universal
belief, can no longer be doubted. Even if the astronomical
basis of the myth were proved incorrect, the universality of its


acceptance, and its correspondence ■with the apparent motions
of the heavenly bodies, remain untouched, and afford a clue to
the source of all religious beliefs, from the authority of which,
in point of unity and design, there can he no dissent. Modern
science may invalidate the worth of antique deductions, but it
cannot affect the source of the faith, nor. the universality of
its acceptance as the corner-stone upon which every religious
system has been upreared. Vale, the astronomer, says:—“The
celebrated walls of Babylon were, as Berosus, the Assyrian
historian, intimates, constructed to meet the awful emergencies
of that universal flood which had occurred before, and, accord-
ing to the system of the Neroa, must recur every six thousand
years. Thus, the famous and mysterious towers on its walls
were evidently designed as places of refuge, when the
plains of Shinar should be overwhelmed with the expected
deluge, and their distracted inhabitants flee to the great city
for safety.”
Our space will not allow us to point out the remarkable
significance of the famous Tower of Belus (Babel), wherein
the builders, by its concentric circles, designed to symbolize
the great serpent of the skies, or the sun in Scorpio, when,
after descending through its seven concentric rings or cycles of
ages, it must arrive at the Antarctic circle, at the last point of
which -was to ensure the final destruction of the earth by fire
or water. One thing is certain—the ancient Chaldeans, Jive
thousand years ago , anticipated our discoveries in the remains
of tropical plants and fossils at the Arctic regions, and proved
by their traditions, monumental remains, and theological
myths, that they realized the changes that the Neros would
bring in the direction of the polar axis, and that they knew, to
a positive certainty, that the lands of the Orient they then


inhabited had once been submerged by Arctic floods, and would
jet become the polar regions, when, as Berosus declared, “ the
land would be shrouded by the awful gloom of a long,
unlighted, and tempestuous winter, whilst the benignant rays
of the sun-god would only illuminate the earth feebly, during
the reign of what had once been the joyful season of almost
forgotten summers.” In these words the old Assyrian historian
predicted that the changes of the polar axis would carry the
land of the East into the desolate regions of the poles, and
that the six months’ winter and six months of feebly-illumi-
nated summer would prove “the awful judgment” under
which the earth would groan during the anticipated season of
the much-dreaded six thousandth Neros. The Chaldean luni-
solar, or heliocentric system, represented that the first period
of the earth, when their own land was actually on the
temperate line, above the equator, was the golden age of
humanity, during which all was bloom and beauty, fertility
and plenty, and man, in correspondence with his earth, was
gentle, good, and happy. The earth was then a garden of
Eden. . . . The first change produced by the Neros of
6,000 years resulted in a flood, followed by a gradual resti-
tution of things; a second age, less fortunate and happy than
the first, was succeeded by a second cataclysm at the next
Neros through the action of fire; a third period of alternate
rehabilitation and destruction of man and his planet ensued,
followed by a fourth epoch (styled by the ancient Hindoos
“ Yugs,” by the Egyptians Neroses, or Cycles), and man enters
the present existing order of things, denominated by all
antique philosophers “the iron age,” or the culminating period
of the earth’s existence.
Interpreters of the Bible who realize that it is, in a great


measure, an astronomical and mythical -work, will understand
that the visions of Daniel, Ezekiel, and the author of the
Apocalypse, receive from these premises a totally different mode
of explanation to that which the letter of their mystical
delineations would convey.
They write in the true Chaldean spirit of the Neroses, and aim
at depicting in allegorical language celestial conflicts between
antagonistic constellations with the hero of the skies, the
mighty sun. They calculate the approaching changes in the
celestial and physical universe upon the basis of the Neroses, and
whilst the personages of their grand dramas are seasons, suns,
stars, planets, and satellites, the destinies of men are so
intermixed with the hierarchies of natural and spiritual forces,
that nothing hut an understanding of the cycular system, with
all its complicated machinery of correspondences, could throw
any light on its mystic utterances.
Beginning with the order and motions of the stars, represent-
ing the sun, as the deific hero of the skies, contending with the
antagonistic principles of good and evil, impersonating every
star and every element in nature, and combining the whole
into one grand scheme of correspondence with the life and
destiny of man; dividing the celestial motions into periods
which also found an exact correspondence in the physical
changes of the globe,' and elaborating this wonderful and
complicated scheme through the successive generations of
thousands of years of time, the whole coloured and shaped by
the fervid mentality of Oriental fancy, is it any wonder that
the Sabean system grew into a world-wide faith, or that the
facts of astronomy deepened into a religion so stupendous and
wrought into the nature of succeeding generations, that not
all the promptings of common sense, reason, evidence, and


scientific demonstration have proved sufficient to dethrone its
empire over the human mind 1
We shall conclude this necessarily very brief and very much
abridged account of the stupendous system under consideration,
by a few extracts from certain authoritative writers, whose
views on the Neroses are worth recording. Godfrey Higgins, on
page 245 of the Anacalypsis, says :
“ From the epochs and cycles explained by Mons. Cassini (a
celebrated astronomer of the last century), we may readily
infer the mode in which Eusebius and the Christian Fathers
settled the times of the festivals, the birth of John, Jesus, &c.
All this dovetails perfectly with the astronomical theories of
Dupuis, and into what the learned Spaniard, Alphonso the
Great, said— ‘ That the adventures of Jesus are all depicted in
the constellations ; ’ into what Jacob is reported to have said—
‘ That the fortunes of his family were read in the stars ; ’ also
into what Isaiah said —‘ That the heavens were a hook ’ —a
statement believed by the Cabalists, who divided the stars into
letters.”
In a very elaborate review of biblical astronomy, and the
only half-perfect way in which Josephus and other Jewish
writers understood the cycular system, Godfrey Higgins shows
how thoroughly the biblical writers meant to designate cycles
when they wrote of persons. The Jews computed the first
great Neros at 608 instead of 600 years. As this gave many
incorrect renderings, Higgins deems that the myth of Joshua
stopping the course of the sun and moon was a correction
of the cycle of 608 years, and he concludes his arguments in'
these words :
“ The Bible says, about a day. At that time each degree, or
72 years, represented a cycular day, the solar year being then
calculated at 360 days only. Every festival then would fall
back or stop a day in about 72 years.”
5


“ The circumstance of the moon being stopped, as well as the
sun, is allusive to the double cycle of sun and moon. It was a
throwing back of the luni-solar period. If this were not so,
why should Joshua stop the moon 1 Surely the sun gave light
enough without the moon ! But why argue at all 1 I suppose
nobody is so weak in these days as to take the letter of the
text literally.”
In a long dissertation on the allegorical sense implied in the
name, character, and writings of Isaiah, the learned author of
the Anacalypsis shows that a similar correction of an erroneous
calculation of the Neroses is implied in the cabala of Isaiah
pretending to make the shadoio on the sun-dial go hack ten
degrees. He says ;
“ The cycles would require correcting after several revo-
lutions, and we find Isaiah making the shadows go back
ten degrees on the sun-dial of Ahaz. This is nothing
but a similar correction pf the Neroses, occurring at
the era attributed to the reign of Hezekiah, when the cor-
rection of the cycle retarded the coming period of evil, which
would ensue in Hezekiah’s reign, ten degrees.” After
very elaborately showing that the Hebrew compilers of the
Old Testament had endeavoured to define the cycles as the
Hindoos did, and represent the different Neroses as the advent
of greatly-inspired god-men or incarnations of deity, Higgins
adds :—“ I before stated that the first cycle was placed at the
birth of Enoch. This cycle only fulfilled half the period—for
God took him at 365 years—making the other half-cycle a lapse,
for the corrections necessary. The cycle being incomplete, and
dying out, in order to make corrections, Enoch did not die, but
God took him The second cycle ended with the
birth of Noah ; the third with Noah’s leaving the ark, he being
then 600 years old. The fourth ended about the time of Abra-
ham, who was also Isaac, which name signifies joy, gladness,
laughter, so-called because he was the new incarnation or
saviour, not because his mother laughed at God. . . . The
fifth Jewish cycle ends when the Samaritans say Joshua or
Jesus (the names are one) brought the ark to Shiloh. . . .


The Jews, like the Hindoos, had many saviours, or incarnations,
or persons in whom a portion of divine wisdom was thought to
he incarnate.” ....
“The next cycle must be, I think, that of Ellas, or Elijah—
* The Lord God/ according to Calmet and Cruden—that is, it
means to say, an incarnation of the Zeus of the Greeks, or
‘ the solar power.’ He left his prophetic power to Elisha,
which Calmet and Cruden say means, ‘ the Lamb of God/ or
Aries, the next sign to Taurus, which means the sun.” . . ,
“It seems that the Bible was a collection of secret writings,
known only to the chief priests, probably first exposed to the
public eye by Ptolemy Philadelphia, 246 years before Christ,
when he caused the Pentateuch to be translated.”
“ I feel little doubt that the publication of the Jewish
writings was forced, as the Jews claim, by Ptolemy.” . . .
“ After they were once translated and published abroad, there
would be no longer any use in keeping them secret, and copies
of the original would be multiplied At the
Babylonian captivity they were not destroyed, because the
desolation of Palestine happened at two different periods, so
that one part of the people preserved the sacred books in their
temple when all was burnt in the temple of the other.” . .
“Of the hero of the eighth age it is said in our version,
thus saith the Lord to his anointed Gyrus, whose right hand I
have holden, tlx., tie. . . . The eighth period began about
600 years, then, before Christ. The ninth began, as the
Siamese say, with Christ.” ....
In the Classical Journal, Vol. xix.,p. 72, the Rev. Mr. Faber,
a strong partisan for all the affirmations and claims of the
Christian religion, makes the statement that Melchizedec was
thought to be an incarnation of the Son of God. He adds—
“lt was contended that every extraordinary personage whose
office it was to reclaim or instruct mankind was an ‘ Avatar/
or descent from the Godhead.” Again, he says:—“ Adam,
Enoch, and Noah, might in appearance be different persons,
but they were really the self-same divine man, animating
different human bodies.” Now, unless the Rev. Mr, Faber be


a re-incamationist, and a disciple of Allen Kardec, the French
spiritist and teacher of re-incarnation, he comes to precisely
the same conclusion reached by the profoundest students who
have studied the Oriental doctrines of the cycles, and who all
contend that Adam, Noah, Enoch, (fee., (fee., were imaginary beings,
representative of the different ages, or cycles known to have
existed in the early history of mankind Again,
Mr. Higgins writes on page 283 of Anacalypsis :
“ There are few readers who will be surprised that I should
look back to an existent state of the globe at a very remote
period. I allude to a time when the angle of the plane of the
ecliptic with that of the equator was much larger than it is
now, the effect of which would be to increase the heat in the
polar regions, and make it a comfortable place of residence.
This easily accounts for the remains of tropical plants found in
those regions.”
“ Every appearance of this kind is easily accounted for as
the effect of that periodical motion of the earth, which, if
continued, will bring the plane of the ecliptic and equator to
coincide, and in process of time to become at right angles to one
another.”
“ The circumstance of the animals of the torrid zone being
found in the high latitudes near the poles, is itself a proof to
an unprejudiced mind that the time must have been when, by
the passage of the sun on the plane of the ecliptic, his line
of movement must have been much nearer the poles than now;
hence, those which are now the northern regions must have had
a temperate climate. . . .”
Mr. Higgins has furnished a larger amount of valuable
matter on the heliocentric system and biblical astronomy than
would suffice to fill this little treatise. Bryant, Baillie,
Basnage, the authors of “ Asiatic Besearches,” “ Universal
History,” “L’Originde tousles Cultes,” “La Cite Antique,”
ifec., (fee., have all contributed valuable information on the same


subject ; but though we must now bring our review of this
subject to a close, and only renew it incidentally in connexion
with other matter, we have given our readers as fair and
authoritative a compendium as our space would permit, and
for the more elaborate details of a system to which the history
of all ancient nations has contributed, we refer the scholar
to the numerous authentic writers above mentioned, or the
many others quoted in these pages.
SECTION VI.
ORIGIN OF ALL RELIGIONS IN INDIA—BOUDHA.
Wiiolk libraries have been written on the subject of the
ancient man’s religious opinions. Unfortunately for the cause
of truth, these important topics have either been treated of in
books too voluminous to be placed within the reach of the
ordinary reader, or they have been distorted by the bigotry
and arrogant assumptions of those who write only in the
interest of a sect, or for the honour and glory of some form of
credal faith. Thus the only class of men whose educational
advantages qualify them to become authorities on these all-
important subjects—namely, college-bred ministers of the
Christian religion—are generally the most unscrupulous libellers
of all systems but their own, and the chief promoters of those
un-Christian teachings which denounce, with all the bitterness
of sectarian bigotry, the antique faiths, on which their own is
upreared.


The aim of this little treatise being to avoid the Scylla and
Charybdis presented by both these barriers to the diffusion of
knowledge on religious subjects, we shall offer that which we
have to say in the most compendious possible form, and prove
our freedom from all sectarian bias, by grounding our
assertions, for the most part, on the opinions of authentic
writers, rather than by presenting views of our own. In this
spirit we approach that most ancient form of faith, cherished
by that most ancient of all nations, Hindostan.
Without entering in this place upon the question of India’s
priority amongst nations, we take ground with most of the
learned Orientalists in the belief that the civilization of
Hindostan ascends into higher periods of antiquity than that
of any other historic nation, and that it was from the meta-
physical speculations of her early sages that the first elements
of the celebrated astronomical religion were derived.
Taking up her religious history at that point when her
temples, monuments, and scriptures afford us abundant data
for all our researches, we find that ancient Hindostan taught,
if she did not originate, the belief in one Supreme Being, called
Brahm, a word which signifies the void, or space; also the doctrine
of the Trinity, or three subordinate emanations from the First
Great Cause—named, from their supposed attributes, Brahma
the Creator; Yishnu, the Preserver; and Siva, the Destroyer and
Be-producer. The Hindoos also taught of a paradisaical garden;
the disobedience and fall of man; the alternate destruction
and renovation of the earth by fire and flood; the belief in
the soul’s immortality; the doctrines of good and evil;
rewards and punishments hereafter, and, what is more
pertinent to our present researches, the division of time into
“Yugs” or “Cycles,” defined by astronomical observations,


and the incarnation, of Deity in the person of earth-bom
God-men, at different periods of time, according with the
movements of the heavenly bodies. It would be unnecessary
to discuss the question whether the Hindoos were the first
discoverers of this system; it is enough that no other nation
can point to such indubitable evidences in the form of
wonderful sculptures, monuments, and scriptures of high
antiquity, and that all these refer to still earlier ages, in which
the specialties of the astronomical religion are constantly
found. The “ Mahabharata,” an ancient poem, which the
Brahmins assert to have been in existence at least 6,000 years
ago (a claim which Wilkins, the learned Sanscrit scholar,
considers to be not altogether unfounded) descants upon all the
special features of theology above enumerated. It also refers
to the heliocentric system, makes mention of past incarnations
of the solar power, or gods born into mortal forms, and assigns
dates for these incarnations in connexion with the cycular
system of Neroses.
The most important feature in Hindoo theology is this doctrine
of divine incarnation, not only on account of its frequent recur-
rence in accordance with the ancient solar legend, but because
the Christians founded their stupendous system of ecclesiasticism
on the assumption that the incarnation of their “ Lord and
Saviour, Jesus Christ,” was a part of an original scheme, acted
out within the last nineteen centuries of time, for the especial
behoof of those who could believe that he was the only-
begotten Son of God; that he descended to earth to be born,
through the maternity of a pure virgin, for thefirst time in human
history, at Palestine, some 1879 years ago; furthermore, that
belief in these claims is essential to man’s salvation, through
all eternity. Now, whether these claims are true or false,


they are certainly of a very important character, and their
authenticity is calculated to produce immeasurably important
consequences upon the race.
The Rev. Robert Taylor has very significantly put the case
in these words ;
“ The time assigned for the historical origin of Christianity
is, the three first centuries from the reign of the Roman
Emperor Augustus. Any continuance of the history after that
time would be unnecessary to prove the origin of the system,
as any proof of its existence before that time would be fatal to the
originality challenged for it.” (Vide Diegesis.)
As the Hindoo systems of incarnation exactly meet this case,
and actually publish abroad to the whole earth all the essential
features of the scheme claimed by Christianity to be original,
and follow it up with successive proofs recorded during thou-
sands of years prior to the advent of Christianity, it is manifest
that the best interests of the Christians themselves—in fact,
we might say, of the whole human race—demand a thorough
investigation of the enormous claims put forth on the one side,
and so determinately refuted on the other.
As our limited space will not permit us to enter into the
complicated systems of Hindoo theology at any length, we must
confine ourselves to a notice of those features deemed, for the
above-named reasons, so highly important —namely, the several
claims of its incarnate gods. Hindoo scriptures, supported by
the abundant sculptures and temples of Hindostan, teach that
Vishnu, the second person of the Hindoo Trinity, has been
incarnated in an earthly form some eight times. The first of
these incarnations was called Boudha, the last but one, or eighth,
Chrishna; and as the legends clustering around these sacred
personages are the most striking and best authenticated of the


■whole scheme, it is to their histories that we shall chiefly con-
fine our attention. The first Boudha of the Hindoos must not
be confounded with a sacred personage of the same name who
appeared, as some historians allege, about 1,200 years before
the Christian era; others deem at a still later period.
“ Boudha Saida Mouni,” alleged to be the ninth incarnation
of Vishnu, was supposed to be born at Nepaul, of royal parent-
age, and was no doubt named Boudha, rather in accordance
with his prophetic pretensions and reformatory mission, than
as receiving that name from his parents. Boudha, signifying
a saint, or the enlightened one, was a name published abroad
and honoured as the first incarnation of Vishnu, for probably
more than five thousand years before the Christian era. As the
Boudha Sakia of more recent date leaves a history behind him,
which in no way connects itself (except by a confusion of names
and persons) with the original of that soubriquet, or bears any
affinity with the earlier incarnations of Vishnu, we shall pass
over his record as not essential to the purposes of this treatise,
and call the reader’s attention to the most ancient founder of
the wide-spread Boudhist faith.
Forbes, in his “Oriental Memoirs,” vol. iii., says: “The
oldest mythology of which we have any record, is that of the
Boudha of the Eastern nations, amongst whom are to be found
all the doctrines above described— i.e., the doctrines of the
later Christian faith.”
At page 101 of Godfrey Higgins’s Anacalypsis, it is said, in
relation to blood offerings as sacrifices :
“ Tradition states that in the earliest times no bloody sacri-
fices took place there; and amongst the Buddhists, who are
the oldest religionists of whom we have any sacred traditions,
and to whom the first book of Genesis probably belongs, no
bloody sacrifices ever prevailed. It never was practised by


the followers of Boudha, and they have constituted a majority
of the inhabitants of the world. . . .”
In his sth book (Anacalypsis) Mr. Higgins writes ;
“ The time is now arrived to enter upon an examination of
the doctrines of the celebrated Boudha of India, the foundation
of all the myths of the Western nations, as well as those of
Chrishna, and from these two were supplied most of the
superstitions which became engrafted into the religion of Jesus
Christ. I shall show that Boudha and Chrishna were only
renewed incarnations of the same Being, and that Being the
O' O
solar power, or a principle symbolized by the sun, Boudha
being the name of the sun in Taurus, the Bull; and Chrishna
being the same solar power when (by the precession of the
equinoxes) the sun receded into the sign of Aries, the Lamb.”
Mons. Creuzer, in his celebrated work Religions de
EAntiquite, vol. i, says :—“ The name and character of Boudha
are purely astronomical. His birth, through the Virgin Maia,
has direct reference to the sun’s annual birth in the constel-
lation of that name at mid-winter; his royal descent, life,
sufferings, miracles, death, and resurrection, are all derived from
the solar journey through the constellations of the zodiac.”
“ The earliest Buddhists were evidently worshippers of the
sun in Taurus. They were the builders of the temple of
Juggernaut, in front of which the Bull projects, and were
expelled from lower India, when, by the change of the signs
from Taurus to Aries, the religion of Chrishna eclipsed that of
Boudha. . . .” Now, as the change from the Bull Taurus
to theLambAries could not have taken place in less than 2,160
years, and the religion of Chrishna, the Sun in Aries, has been
in vogue for at least 3,000 years, we may form some idea of
the extreme antiquity of the ancient Buddliist system. Again,
on page 201 of the Anacalypsis, we find these words : —“The
Rev. Mr. Maurice has given a long and particular account of
the ten grand Avatars or incarnations of the god of the
Hindoos. . . . Boudha was universally allowed to be the
first of these incarnations; that of Chrishna was the eighth.
At the era of the birth of Christ, nine of these incarnations
had appeared on earth, and another was expected to follow
before the end of the Cali Yug, or, the present cycle.”


“All the Hindoo incarnations were bom—or, rather, their
appearances noted to occur —at the close of the 600th Neros ;
hence, from Boudha (the sun in Taurus) to the eighth incar-
nation, Chrishna (or the sun in Aries) was a period of over
2,160 years Between the Brahmins and Budd-
hists there exists the greatest conceivable enmity. . . .
Yet Boudha is allowed by his enemies the Brahmins to have
been a divine Avatar, and the Bull of the Zodiac was his
emblem. He is described as Divine Wisdom—the Sun in
Taurus. This is the first Boudha, or incarnation of Divine
Wisdom, by many Brahmins opposed, because they confound
him with a later personage, to whom the same name was given.
In fact Boudha, or the wise, seems to have been the appella-
tion of a doctrine assumed by many persons at different periods
of time. Rev. Mr. Faber thinks that this one person is sup-
posed to have been incarnated many times, and from this
circumstance much confusion has arisen.”
The mother of Boudha was Maia, a name also assigned to
the mother of the Greek Mercury, in which Maia sometimes
typifies the Sea, the Mother of Forms, and sometimes the
Month of May. The followers of Boudha claim for him no
earthly father, but an immaculate conception, through a royal
mother, and a ray of heavenly light. After a long dissertation on
the character, history, and attributes of the original Boudha,
Higgins makes use of these remarkable words ;
“ Boudha passed his infancy in innocent sports, and yet he
is often described as an artificer. In his manhood, he had
severe contests with wicked spirits, and finally he was put to
death, we shall find, by crucifixion, descended into hell, and
re-ascended into heaven.”
In treating of the various Avatars who have so unmistak-
ably formed the ground-plan upon which Christians have
upreared their peculiar doctrines, it may not be entirely unim-
portant to know that their original model was neither more nor
less than a negro; in short, the Christ who, eighteen hundred


and seventy-nine years ago, was assumed to have been born of
the Supreme Being and the Blessed Virgin Mary, has derived the
principal items of his history from the woolly-haired, thick-lipped
Hack Boudha, who, at a period of not less than five thousand
years before the advent of his renowned Jewish imitator, was
born of a ray of light, through the maternity of the “blessed
virgin” Maia, otherwise the Sea, or the flowery month of
May.
In confirmation of these statements, we shall now cite some
fragments of an immense mass of testimony, combining to show
that the first of the Hindoo Avatars—the most ancient Boudha
—was depicted as a negro, and obviously represented a race of
people who, like the statues of their god, were of negro
origin.
Our first quotation on this subject will be taken from the
Anacalypsis (page 40).
“ The religion of Boudha of India is well known to have
been very ancient. In most of the temples scattered through-
out Asia, where his worship is yet continued, he is found,
black as jet, with the flat face, thick lips, and curly hair of the
negro. Several statues of him may be met with in the museum
of the East India Company.
“ There are two exemplars of him brooding on the face of the
deep upon a coiled serpent. To what time are we to allot this
negro 1 He will be proved to have been prior to the god
Chrishna. He must have been prior to, or contemporaneous
with, the black empire, supposed by Sir "William Jones to have
flourished at Sidon. The religion of this negro god is found, by
the ruins of his temples and other circumstances, to have
spread over an immense extent of country, even to the remotest
parts of Britain, and to have been professed by devotees
inconceivably numerous It was the opinion
of Sir William Jones that a great nation of blacks (not
certainly, though possibly, negroes) formerly possessed the
dominion of Asia, and held the seat of empire at Sidon (more


probably Babylon). These must have been the people called
by Mr. Maurice Cushites, or Cuthites, described in Genesis,
and the opinion that they were blacks is corroborated by the
translators of the Pentateuch, who constantly render the word
Cush, by Ethiopia.
“It is very certain that, if this opinion be well founded, we
must go for the time when this empire flourished, to a period
anterior to all our regular histories.
“It can only be known to have existed from accidental
circumstances, which have escaped amidst the ruins of empires
and the wrecks of time.”
Mr. Wilsford, in the Asiatic Researches, says :
“ Many of the ancient statues of the god Boudha in India
have crisp, curly hair, with fiat noses and thick lips ; nor can
it be reasonably doubted that a race of negroes formerly had
pre-eminence in India.”
The Rev. Mr. Maurice, the learned missionary and writer on
Hindoo antiquities, says :
“ The figures (i.e., gods) in the Hindoo cave temples are of
a very different character from the present race of Hindoos ;
their countenances are broad and full, the nose flat, and the
lips remarkably thick The figures in the caves
in India and in the temples in Egypt are absolutely the same
as those given by Bruce, Niebuhr,” &c., etc.
Sir William Jones, in Asiatic Researches, makes the
following remarks ;
“ The remains of architecture and sculpture in India seem
to prove an early connexion between this country and Africa.
The pyramids of Egypt, the colossal statues described by
Pausanias and others, the Sphinx, and the Hermes Canis,
which last bears a great resemblance to the VariihAbatar, or
the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of a boar, indicate the
style and mythology of the same indefatigable workmen who
formed the vast excavations of Canara, the temples and images
of the black Boudha, and the idols continually dug up at Gaya.
“ The letters on these monuments appear, as I have before


intimated, partly of Indian, and partly of Abyssinian or
Ethiopio origin, and all these indubitable facts may induce
no ill-founded opinion that Ethiopia and Hindostan were
colonized, or peopled, by the same extraordinary race
The mountaineers of Bengal and Behar can hardly be dis-
tinguished in some of their features from the modem
Abyssinians, whom the Arabs call children of Cush ; and the
ancient Hindoos, according to Strabo, differed in nothing from
the Africans, but in the straightness and smoothness of their
hair, while that of others was crisp or woolly
Hence, the people who received the first light of the rising sun,
according to the limited knowledge of the ancients, are said by
Apuleius to be the Arii and Ethiopians, by which he meant
certain nations of India, where we frequently see figures of
Boudha with crisp curled hair.”
Higgins closes a very profound and exhaustive review of
this subject by saying—-“ The learned Maurice says : —‘ Cuthites
(i.e., Celts) built the great temples of India and Britain,’ and
the great mathematician Reuben Barrow has no hesitation in
pronouncing Stonehenge to be a temple of the black, curly-
headed Boudha ”
In commenting on the extreme antiquity of the worship of
Boudha in India, Oriental scholars point out, that, whereas
Boudha represented the sun in Taurus (the bull) and Chrishna
represented the sun when, 2,160 years later, he fell back
into the sign of Aries (the lamb), so the changes between these
two signs, and the consequent alterations in periods of sacred
feasts, ceremonial rites, &c., were often attended with savage
conflicts, and even long-protracted wars between the adherents
of the rival sects.
The worshippers of the sun in Taurus would not part with
their favourite emblems, and branded the Chrishnaites as
“ infidels ” and blasphemers against their God.
This spirit of antagonism towards the innovations promoted
by astronomical discoveries, prevailed throughout the East,


especially in those lands so often referred to in the Bible. In
Assyria, Babylon, Phoenicia, and many parts of Arabia, the
worship of Boudha symbolized by the Bull became corrupted
into the worship of Bel, Belus, Bael, Bael-peor, &c., &c., all
synonyms of the Bull, and all degraded remnants of what
was once the pure and simple worship of Boudha, the “ Good
God,” the “ Lord of Heaven,” the “ Enlightened One.”
It was from this tendency to degrade and corrupt what was
once a system of pure morality—one, too, which all authori-
tative writers acknowledge utterly repudiated sacrifices of
blood—that Tauric rites eventually gave birth to the monstros-
ities of the worship of Juggernaut. This horrible form of
idolatry still recognizes the sun in Taurus as its foundation,
hence the bull figures largely in the rites. It is commonly
supposed, too, that the hideous idol itself was merely designed
by the priests to represent an exaggerated form of the negro
god Boudha, and this, with mementos of the still more antique
symbolisms and ceremonials of Siva the Destroyer, made up
a composite form of worship well calculated to impress the
ignorant masses with awe and terror, and keep them in
subjection to the priests of so tremendous a system. Mr.
Higgins says :
“ When I contemplate what the character of a true Buddhist
must have been, before corruption crept into the religion, I
can readily believe anything good of the people professing it.
The true, conscientious Buddhist must have been an exact
prototype of Jesus Christ, as I shall prove, both in doctrine and
practice.”
Mr. Higgins goes on to argue that Moses, who derived all
his sacerdotal loro from the Egyptians—these again receiving
their religious systems from India—strove to inaugurate the
new worship of Aries, or the Lamb, in all his levitical rites;


hence his anger against Aaron for encouraging the people to
return to the old, corrupt, and idolatrous worship of the bull
or calf, which the reformers of the time were striving to abolish.
It now only remains to say that in the worship of the most
ancient Boudha, as in that of his far later successor, Chrishna,
we have all the elements that make up the specialities of faith
claimed by Christians. Besides elaborate accounts of the
famous “ virgin mother Maia,” the popular tradition of her
child’s birth from her side, and his gospel infancy, corresponding
in nearly all respects to the Apocryphal gospel professing to
describe the infancy of Jesus, we have the worship of the cross
as a sacred emblem, and that of the Trinity as the oldest form
of mythology in existence. Speaking of one of the splendid
cave temples at Elephanta, in which the Hindoo triumvirate is
sculptured in colossal proportions and magnificent style of
execution, Maurice says ;
“ Of exquisite workmanship and of stupendous antiquity, to
which neither the page of history nor human traditions can
ascend, that magnificent piece of sculpture, so often alluded to, in
the cavern of Elephanta, decidedly establishes the solemn fact
that, from the remotest eras, the Indian nations have adored a
triune deity. There the traveller with awe and astonishment
beholds, carved out of the solid rock, in the most conspicuous
part of the most ancient and venerable temple of the world, a
bust, expanding in breadth nearly twenty feet, and no less than
eighteen feet in altitude; a bust composed of three heads
united to one body, adorned with the oldest symbols of the
Indian theology, and thus expressly fabricated to indicate the
one God in his triune character of the Creator, Preserver, and
Regenerator of Mankind.”
In these days of wide-spread knowledge and universal
research we need no individual testimony to prove that all the
doctrines of the Christian religion were known and published
abroad throughout the East thousands of years before the


Avatar of the Christians was known, yet the testimony of so
learned a man and so devout a Christian as Maurice, to the
origin of the Trinitarian doctrine, in periods which antedate
all historic records, is one of the most conclusive evidences
extant that—silently, surely, and inevitably—the authority of
truth is yet destined to supersede the fleeting and evanescent
rule of superstitious credal faiths, even though their votaries
should be compelled to bear unwilling witness against them-
selves. In the same spirit of fatuity, we find a devoted
Christian witnessing against the originality of his own faith,
when the celebrated monk, Gregorius, in his Tihetium
Alphehetum, describes, and gives illustrations of, the Hindoo
God, Indra (the sun), nailed to a cross, with Jive wounds /
Gregorius says that these crosses are to bo seen in abundance
in Nepaul, especially at the comers of the roads and on
eminences. The good Romish monk expresses much naive
astonishment at finding these mementoes of the Christian religion
in places only known to the world by the irruption of Alexander
the Great. As Higgins suggests, these confessions, like many
others of the same character from similar sources, “ prove a
little too much,” the crucifixes in question being relics of an
unknown antiquity, dating back to periods when the honest
monk’s worship was never dreamed of, and looming up in
spots utterly unknown to any Christian pilgrims before his
own time.
A similar problem has been presented for the bigotry of
sectarianism to solve, in the mysterious characteristics of
another of the Hindoo Avatars, named Wittoba. Moore, in
his celebrated Indian Pantheon, has given several plates of
this god, with his feet pierced. The author describes the
manner in which the god Wittoba is represented; his images
6


often representing him in the form of a Romish crucifix, the
feet placed one over the other, and pierced as if with a nail. In
the splendid temple erected to him at Punderpoor, a glory from
above is shining over him, and the pointed Parthian coronet is
on his head. From the frequency with which the Indian
Avatars are represented with a similar coronet, it may be
inferred, the later idea was derived of representing the Jewish
Avatar with a crown of thorns.
Higgins, with the fearlessness and candour which mark his
style, comments very severely on the ominous silence which all
writers in the interests of Christianity observe, on the subject
of Wittoba, the ancient temple of Punderpoor, where his
crucified image is found, and the manifest attempts that have
been made to suppress the plates which Air. Moore published
in his Indian Pantheon, with representations of this ancient
Avatar. Air. Higgins says :
“ Long after the above was written, I accidentally looked
into Aloore’s Pantheon, at the British Aluseum. I discovered
something Air. Aloore has apparently not dared to tell us—
namely, that in several of the icons of AVittoba, there are
marks of holes in both feet, and in others of holes in the
hands. In figures 4 and sof plate 11, the figures have nail
holes in both feet; in fig. 3, in one hand; fig. 6 has on his
side the mark of a foot, and a little lower in the side a round
hole. To his collar, or shirt, hangs the emblem of a heart,
such as we generally see on the Romish pictures of Christ.
In plate 97, Ballaji, or Wittoba’s right foot, is represented
crushing a serpent.”
Comment on these representations is unnecessary, although
Air. Higgins deems otherwise, for he not only roundly rates
the various societies of Europe for a general tendency to
smother, and keep back, all notices or representations of this
Avatar, but he adds :—“ Air. Aloore gives an account of an


influence endeavoured to be exercised upon him, to induce him
not to publish the print for fear of giving offence.” Again,
he says, after many scathing criticisms on the above subjects ;
“The silence itself of our literati and missionaries speaks
volumes.”
Another, and equally striking evidence of the mode in which
travellers, however indefatigable, and writers, however learned,
endeavour to bend the most obvious truths of antiquity, so as to
support the claims of sectarian bigotry, is to be found in
Arthur Aiken’s English translation of M. Denon’s celebrated
work on Egyptian Antiquities, where it is said, in the 2nd
vol., 19th chap., in an elaborate description of the famous
ruins at Philoe :
“ I found within it some remains of a domestic scene, which
seemed to be that of Joseph and Mary , and it suggested to
me the subject of the flight into Egypt in a style of the utmost
truth and interest.”
The author is not, unfortunately, possessed of the original
work, and is therefore unable to determine whether this
audacious perversion of a fact which might label the Christian
Holy Family with the names of Osiris, Isis, and Homs,
instead of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus, is due to the French
writer’s bigotry, or that of his English translator. It is enough
to say, that this same temple at Philoe was one of the most
ancient in Tipper Egypt; and as if to render the hypothesis that
it might at some unknown period of Christian history have
been sculptured over by Christian devotees an utter fallacy,
the existence of these figures was unknown, until Belzoni
restored them to the light of day by causing excavations
of sand to be removed, which must have been the accumulation
of thousands of years. Yolney very pertinently inquires “ if.


the early Christians brought the sand there to cover up the-
Holy Family, as soon as they had sculptured it 1 ”
We must conclude this long notice of the early Buddhist
incarnation and doctrine, omitting hundreds of noteworthy
points which our space forbids mentioning, by asking
reflecting Christians to explain, if they can, why so many of
their European statues of the Virgin and child are represented
like the ancient Boudha, Chrishna, and the Eastern Virgins,
black, and for what reason (except in the transformation of the
ancient faith into the modem), these marvellous anomalies are-
sanctioned in Catholic countries 1
That they exist, every Continental traveller must be aware,
although some have been removed, and more sightly forms,
figures, statues, or— idols —substituted.
Many of these remarkable paraphrases of Eastern worship
may be seen throughout Europe, but we may especially direct
the attention of the curious to the Cathedral at Moulins, the
celebrated chapel of the Loretto Virgin; the Church of the
Aniumciata, the Church of St. Lazaro at Genoa, St.
Francisco at Pisa, St. Theodore at Munich, the Cathedral at
Augsburgh, the Borghese Chapel, the Pantheon, and one of
the small Chapels at St. Peter’s.
On pages 174-5 of the Anacalypsis, Mr. Higgins writes;—
“ There is scarcely an old church in Italy where some remains
of the worship of the black virgin and black child are not to
be met with.
“ Very often the black figures have given way to white ones,
and, in these cases, the black, as being held sacred, are put into
retired places, but were not destroyed, and are yet to be found
in the churches. . . . Pictures in great numbers are to be
seen where the white of the eyes and teeth and the lips a
little tinged with red, like the black figures in the museum of


the East India Company, show that the black colour was
not the work of time. . . .
“When the circumstance has been named to the Romish
priests, they have endeavoured to disguise the fact by pre-
tending that the child had become black by the smoke of the
candles; but it was black where the smoke of a candle never
came ; and, besides, how came the candles not to blacken the
white of the eyes, the teeth, and the redness of the lips?
. . . If the author had wished to invent a circumstance to
corroborate the assertion that the Romish Christ of Europe is
the Chrishna of India, how could we have desired anything
more striking than the fact of a black virgin and child being
so common in Europe ? A black virgin and child amongst the
white Germans, Swiss, French, and Italians ! ”
SECTION VII.
ORIGIN OF ALL RELIGIONS IN INDIA—CHRISHNA.
Passing over the many curious details which belong to the
history of the six Avatars of Vishnu, who succeed the first, so
well known as the black or negro Boudha, we resume our
review with that celebrated character which Hindoo theology
points out as the eighth incarnation—namely, Chrishna, whom
the effigies represent as of a bluish-black hue, but with the
straight hair and aquiline features of the modern Hindoo.
All the romance of Hindoo ideality and religious fervour
centres upon the memory of this famous Avatar. Whether it was
that the full sum of legendary lore which had been growing
through countless ages into a stupendous system of theology,
found its embodiment in Chrishna, or that some truly inspired
mortal actually appeared at a certain time on earth, in the


character of a great religious reformer, one whose history
—according to the immemorial custom of antiquity—his
disciples subsequently invested with the mythical attributes
of the sun-god, it would now be impossible to determine; cer-
tain it- is, that no character in the voluminous records of the
Hindoo Pantheon, ever commended itself so intimately to the
deep religious sentiment of his followers, and no name has ever
been enshrined in loving memory with a holier and more fervid
spirit of worship than that of Chrishna—the eighth incar-
nation of Yishnu.
Another striking fact in connection with this great Avatar’s
history, is the extraordinary sensation its wide-spread know-
ledge has awakened in the strongholds of Christianity.
The salient points in the myth of Chrishna, from their very
first publication in the European literature of the last century,
have been met by the most furious spirit of denial and perver-
sion on the part of Christian writers. Every fresh discovery
which hastended to throw light upon the origin of this inter-
esting subject, has either been sedulously suppressed or grossly
misrepresented. Those who have persisted in questioning its
singular and unmistakable parity with the Christian legend,
have been labelled as the enemies of mankind—infidels, blas-
phemers, or divers other epithets of a similar nature, strongly
indicative of the idea that the foundations of the Christian
faith were not as impregnable as their advocates pretended, and
that the wide-spread knowledge of the story of Chrishna was
likely, in some mysterious way, to prove inimical to the claims
of a divine revelation and special originality for the similar
story of Christ. Despite the attempts of meek Christians, and
gentle followers of the loving Nazarene, to crush, hide, or brow-
beat the legend of Chrishna out of popular circulation, it


has still gained ground, and a continued succession of Eastern
discoveries, published far and wide through the pages of our
cheap popular literature, have at length narrowed down the
formidable ranks of partisanship to the plain common sense
question, which is the original and which is the copy! That
the claims of Christianity should be reduced to the forlorn hope
of maintaining all its high and time-honoured pretensions, only
on the condition of proving the myth of Chrishna an imposture,
or at best a spurious copy of its own original scheme, may
seem a more astounding revelation in our generation than its
plan of redemption would appear to any shrewd, intelligent
savage who listened to its recital for the first time ; but if
our readers will be pleased to recall the earlier pages of this
little work, especially where they are illuminated by the rays
of glory which stream up from the antique heads of a Boudha,
Wittoba, &c., itc., they will find that Chrishna only sets the
seal upon a history already too thoroughly known and appre-
hended to be much longer mistaken.
Chrishna is not the only gorgon’s head which Christianity
cannot look upon and live; nevertheless, this Avatar forms such
a remarkable link in the chain of proof as to where our
religious systems come from, that we may well ponder over
the principal features of his myth, and reiterate the question,
which is the original and which the copy?
Eollowing out the plan pursued in former sections, we shall
draw the materials of our present memoir from such authorit-
ative sources, as will commend themselves to the reader’s
acceptance with far more force than our own unsustained
statements.
We have frequently referred to a work entitled Asiatic
Researches, a voluminous mass of writing, issued about 1784, in


sixteen volumes. Since its first publication, it has been revised,
and added to by several authoritative writers, especially by
the celebrated Sir William Jones, one of the most learned
Oriental scholars of the age, and President of the Asiatic
Society. Fine editions of this great work are now to be found
in most of the public libraries.
It is from a copy, in the magnificent Asiatic collection in
Boston, U.S.A., that the author gives the following extract
written by Sir Win. Jones ;
“ That the name of Chrishna, and the general outline of his
story were long anterior to the birth of our Saviour, and
probably to the time of Homer, we know very certainly.
“In the Sanscrit dictionary, compiled more than two
thousand years ago, we have the whole story of the incarnate
deity, born of a virgin, and miraculously escaping in his
infancy from the reigning tyrant of his country
“ The celebrated poem Bhagavat contains a prolix account
of the life of Chrishna. Chrishna, the incarnate deity of the
Sanscrit romance, continues to this hour the darling god of the
Indian women. The sect who adore him with enthusiastic
and almost exclusive devotion have broached a doctrine which
they maintain with eagerness—-that he was distinct from all
the Avatars who had only a portion of his divinity, whereas
Chrishna was the person of Vishnu (God) himself, in a human
form.
“ Chrishna was believed to have been born from the left in-
tercostal rib of a virgin, of the royal line of Devaci. He
passed a life of a most incomprehensible nature.
“ His birth was concealed through fear of the tyrant Cansa,
as it had been predicted that one born at that time, in
such a family, would destroy him. He was fostered, therefore,
in Mathura, by an honest herdsman surnamed Ananda.
“ Chrishna, when a boy, slew the terrible serpent Caliyaga,
with a number of other serpents and monsters. He saved
multitudes partly by his arms and partly by his miraculous
powers.
“ He raised the dead, descending for that purpose to the


lowest regions. . . . He washed the feet of the Bramins
and preached very nobly indeed and sublimely, but always in
their favour.”— (Asiatic Researches on the Gods of Greece, Italy,
and India.)
Mrs. Lydia Maria Child, in her admirable and most rever-
ential work, entitled, Progress of Religious Ideas, gives an
extended account of the life, character, and attributes of the
celebrated Hindoo Avatar Chrishna. This excellent writer
quotes Sir William Jones in the Asiatic Researches at far
greater length than our space will permit us to insert, but the
following fragments of history, the learned authoress derives
from other sources :
“ Next to the Yedas and the code of Menu, the most ancient
and venerated of the sacred books of the Hindoos are the
Ramayana, and the Mahabharata.
“The Mahabharata commemorates a later incarnation of
Vishnu in the form of Chrishna. Bramins attribute it to Vyasa,
and say it was written before the commencement of the Cali
Yug, consequently more than live thousand years ago.
Wilkins thinks there is satisfactory evidence of its being at
least four thousand years old. Scriptures on the old rock
temples prove that the Bramins have not assigned too great
antiquity to either of these poems.
“ The Mahabharata contains a celebrated episode called the
Bhagavat Geeta, containing the life of Chrishna. It relates
the history and conversations of Vishnu, while on earth, in the
form of Chrishna.”
In vol. i., page 60, Mrs. Child comments on the history of
Chrishna in these words :
“ The Vishnuites split into two sects. One is more
devoted to Vishnu in the form of Rama; the other believes
that his eighth incarnation, in the form of Chrishna, is the
most poetic and remarkable. The Bramins date it before
the Cali Yug—that is, more than five thousand years ago.


Sir William Jones supposes it to have been written one-
thousand four hundred and fifty-one years before Christ.”
Then follows an abridged account taken from the poem in
question, but as it abounds with Hindoo metaphor and romantic
accounts of various miracles evidently in accordance with the
history of the sun-god, our readers will be just as well
informed upon the subject by the extracts given from Sir
William Jones and those that follow, as if we rendered the
entire of the famous Hindoo romance.
Mrs. Child notes that representations of the mother and child,
th a flight of the holy family by night, or the slaughter of the
innocents, by order of the tyrant Cansa, are sculptured on the
walls of most of the temples dedicated to this Avatar. She
describes the famous legend of the slaughter of the innocents
thus:—
“ Meanwhile, a prophetic voice had told Cansa, ‘ the boy
who is destined to destroy thee is bom, and now living.’ As
soon as he heard that, he gave orders that all the male
children throughout his kingdom should be put to death.
Among the sculptures in the cave-temple at Elephanta is a
conspicuous figure with a drawn sword, surrounded by
slaughtered infants, in allusion to this part of Chrishna’s
history.”
Later on, this authoress says:—
“One of the titles of Chrishna is, ‘Pardoner of Sins;’’
another, ‘ Liberator from the Serpent, Death.’ In allusion to
this, the image of Chrishna is sometimes seen sculptured in the
folds of a serpent that is biting his foot, sometimes treading
victoriously on its head.”
From the Bhagavat Geeta, the following sentences are
given as examples of the conversations between Chrishna and
his disciple, Arjun :


“Although I am the Lord of all created beings, I am made
evident by my own power, and as often as there is a decline of
virtue and an insurrection of vice and injustice in the world, I
make myself evident. Thus I appear from age to age, for the
preservation of the just, the destruction of the wicked, and the
establishment of virtue.
“ I am animated with equal benevolence towards all beings.
I know neither hatred nor predilection ; but those who adore me
devoutly, are in me, and lin them. Even he who has sinned,,
if he adore me only, is reputed virtuous. He will immediately
have a just soul, and obtain eternal peace. Have faith in me.
Ho one who worships me can perish. Forgetting all else,,
address thyself to me. I will deliver thee from all sin.”
Allowing for some difference in the modes of expression, the
parity of ideas between the great teacher of India jive thousand
years ago, and the equally great teacher of Jerusalem eighteen
hundred years ago, cannot fail to strike the reader with
astonishment.
In considering and comparing the several histories under
review, it must be borne in mind that the ancient record looms •
up from the mists of antiquity, unlighted by the methods of
modern civilization. If, therefore, the ancients may present
ideas in more unadulterated shapes, they still lack the precision,
excision, interpolation, &c., &c., &c., to which all Christian
Scriptures have been subject, both in their production and
inodes of subsequent publication. It is to these different ways,
of treating the same subjects that we owe the preservation of
the gospel of Chrishna’s infancy, and the careful suppression of
the same document in relation to Jesus. The “gospel of the
infancy of Jesus,” although in the earliest ages of Christianity
accepted as a genuine record of facts, has since been consigned to
Apocryphal obscurity ; while that of Chrishna has been
preserved, and is often ostentatiously paraded before the world


in comparison with “ that pure and divine record contained in
the evangelical writings,” as a witness of “the preposterous
absurdities of the heathen scheme, and the exquisite simplicity
of the Christian.”—( Vide Rev. Mr. Maurice.) Had the gospel
of the infancy of Jesus been presented to the world as candidly
as that of the Hindoo Chrishna, instead of being consigned to a
prudent state of Apocryphal seclusion, the comparison of the
two would again have afforded us food for the perplexing
speculation as to which was the copy and which the original.
But of this, the reader shall be the judge.
On page 160 of the Anacalypsis, Mr. Higgins writes;—
“In the first place, the Chrishna of India is always repre-
sented as the Saviour and Preserver of mankind; he is also
represented as the Supreme Being, taking upon himself the
state of man; that is, he became incarnate in the flesh, to
save the human race.— (Parallel Nicene and Athanasian
creeds.)
“As soon as Chrishna was born he was saluted with a chorus
of Devatas (Angels) with divine hymns.— (Parallel Luke,
chap, ii., verses 13-1).)
“He was cradled amongst shepherds, to whom were first
made known his divinity.
“ ‘As shepherds watched their flocks by night.’
— Dr, Watts’s Christian Hymn Boole.
“Soon after Chrishna’s birth he was carried away by night,
and concealed in a region remote from his natal place, for fear
of a tyrant, whose destroyer it was foretold he would become,
and who had for that reason ordered all the male children born
at that period to be slain.
“This story is the subject of an immense sculpture in the
cave of Elephanta, the date of which is lost in antiquity. —
(Parallel Matthew, chap, ii.)
“ Chrishna was by the male line of royal descent, though he
was actually born in a dungeon. Jesus’ descent is traced to
King David, though he was born in a stable.


“The moment Chrishna was bom, the whole place was
illuminated, and the countenances of his father and mother
emitted rays of glory.— ( lnfancy of Chrishna. Parallel Gospel
of the Infancy of Jesus , chap, ii.)
“ Chrishna could speak as soon as he was born, and com-
forted his mother.— (Parallel Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus.)
“ Chrishna was heralded in, and assisted by his elder brother
Ram; Jesus, by his kinsman John.
“ Chrishna descended into Hades to restore the lost dead,
and returned to Vaicontha—Paradise.— (Parallel Four Gospels
of Jesus.) Chrishna was called the Good Shepherd.
“ After the birth of Chrishna, the Indian prophet Hared
visited his father and mother at Gokul, examined the stars,
and declared him to be of celestial descent.— (Visit of the wise
men of the East to Mary.)
“ Chrishna was carried to Mathura (Mattea) on the river
Jumma, where many of his miracles were performed, and at
which to this day, he is held in higher veneration than
in any other place. The Rev. Mr. Maurice says : —‘ The
Arabic edition of the Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus records,
Mathura (Mattea) to have been the place where the infant Saviour
resided during his absence from Judea, and until Herod died.
At this place Jesus is reported to have wrought many miracles,
and among others, to have produced in that arid region a foun-
tain of fresh water, the only one in Egypt.’ ”
We feel it duo to our readers to pause here lest they
should fail to remark upon the wonderful coincidences of
history. Some four thousand years ago, the infant Chrishna
■was conveyed to Mathura by his father and mother, to
avoid the wrath of a cruel tyrant king, and there, even
in his tender infancy, he wrought many miracles, amongst
others, caused a pure spring of water to flow forth from
the arid desert. To this day his name is remembered and
honoured in that place, and many spots in the vicinity
are pointed out as the scenes of his miracles. Two thou-
sand years later, the infant Jesus is brought to this very spot


by his father and mother, fleeing there for the very same reason—
namely, to avoid the wrath of a tyrant king, who acts in the very
same murderous way in slaughtering all the male children of his
-district, whilst the infant Jesus emulates his celebrated proto-
type, by performing just the very same class of miracles at the
river Jumma, and the only difference in the legends which still
attach to that sacred spot is, that the Eastern nations generally
-attribute the miraculous works done, to an ancient saviour
named Chrishna, and the Christians—such as Eusebius, Athana-
sius, and, on the strength of their assertions the Eev. Mr.
Maurice—attribute the performance of the said miracles to a
modern saviour named Christ. Again the pertinent question
•obtrudes itself, which is the original which the copy 1 Let
the stony'forms of the ancient Chrishna sculptured in temples
•antedating historic record; the famous sculpture at Elephanta
of the slaughtered infants; the Bhagavat Geeta, with its
undoubted antiquity of over fifteen centuries before Christ,
as vouched for by the pious Sir "William Jones; let
the worship of the ancient Avatar, with its records of faith,
traditions, statues, and temples ; all grey with age, or ever the
Jewish Avatar was heard of—answer the question, and the
reader may decide which system has the facts, and which the
frauds of religious history.
Our space will only permit us to make a few more extracts
“from Mr. Higgins’s splendid work, the Anacalypsis, ere we
close. Page 162 :
“After Chrishna came to man’s estate, one of his first
miracles was the cure of a leper. Upon another occasion,
a woman poured on the head of Chrishna a box of ointment,
for which he cured her of an ailment, and to show his
Tiumility and meekness, he washed the feet of the Bramins. In
the gospel of the infancy of Jesus, he is represented as turning


Tiis young companions into sheep, and at the solicitation of their
parents, restoring them to their proper form ; a similar history
is attributed to Chrishna in his youthful days. In the gospel of
Jesus’ infancy, he has a remarkable adventure with a serpent,
which had poisoned one of his companions, matched by the
young Chrishna’s combat with the serpent Caliyaga, which had
poisoned the cow-herds.”
In the gospel of Jesus’ infancy, he is represented as being
sent to Zaccheus for instruction, and astonishing his master
with the extent of his learning. The same tale exactly is
related of Chrishna. Many other points of exact similarity
could be recorded did space permit. To all these proofs of
iact on the one side, and fraud on the other, only two theories
have ever been hazarded by way of explanation. The one is a
vague suggestion on the part of Sir William Jones, that the
Bramins, having charge of the sacred books of the Hindoos,
might have tampered with the copies, and interpolated them
■after the Christian religion was published abroad.
The eminent character of Sir William Jones has rendered a
suggestion, at once absurd and impossible, so mortifying to
his numerous admirers, that it is very seldom referred to, and
then only in terms of astonishment and regret. Were it
possible —which it never could have been, to have tampered
with Scriptures jealously guarded and preserved for thousands
of years in their original condition as divine law—even then it
would not have explained away Sir William Jones’s own
assertions concerning the immense . antiquity of the
Sanscrit Dictionary and Bhagavat Geeta, in which the learned
Orientalist himself confesses to have found the entire history
of Chrishna, together with all the legends above alluded to.
But, worse and worse for the scholar who has been com-
pelled to advance such a desperate effort at defence! even


his great ally and contemporary, the equally learned and equally
pious, Maurice, deserts him, and comments upon the petty
idea in such arguments as the following, extracted from
Maurice’s Indian Antiquities :—
“In reference to the opinion of Sir W. Jones, happy and
ingenious as it may be, it would still afford but a partial
explanation of the difficulty.
“Many of the mythological sculptures of Hindostan that,
relate to the events in the history of this Avatar more immedi-
ately interesting to the Christian world, being of an age
undoubtedly anterior to the Christian era ; while these sculptures
remain unanswerable testimonies of the fact recorded, the
assertion, unaided by the collateral proofs, rather strengthens;
than obviates the objection of the sceptic. Thus the sculptured
figures copied by Sonnerat from one of the oldest pagodas,
representing Chrishna dancing on the crushed head of the
serpent, while the enraged reptile is seen biting his foot, together
with the history of the fact annexed, could never derive their
origin from any information contained in the spurious G-ospels.”
Rev. Mr. Maurice might have cited, with still more pertinence,
the celebrated sculpture of the slaughter of the innocents, in
the oldest temple in the world, the Elephanta cave. The-
sculptures scattered all over India of the various incidents-
above referred to, including the figures of the flight into Egypt
and multitudes of other stony scriptures—scriptures which no.
interested priests could interpolate, and no interested apologist
deny the vast antiquity of. All these, together with the
legends of Mathura, and the fact that the worship of Chrishna
was a stereotyped form of antique faith centuries before
the Christian’s Lord and Saviour was born, combine to
throw a discreet mantle of silence over the learned Orientalist’s:
“ happy and ingenious idea,” and create a sincere wish on the-
part of his many admirers that he had never descended to the-
imbecility of its expression.


The second attempt to remove the fatal Hindoo witness,
Chrishna, from the realm of fact into that of fraud, was under-
taken by a certain Dr. Bentley, who, in his zeal for Chris-
tianity, through a series of “the most laborious re-
searches,” announced to the world about the end of the
last century that he had succeeded in obtaining an
astrological calculation, which placed the birth of Chrishna
at or about 600 years later than that of Christ; and he also
alleges that the Bramins—by a system of “back reckonings,”
&c., the mode of which, even according to Mr. Bentley, was so
abstruse, that no one of sane mind could follow out their
demonstrations —had succeeded in imposing upon the world
claims for an antiquity to which they could lay no foundation.
Against the maintenance of this remarkable theory there were
two fallible points. One of them being that Bentley’s astro-
logical scheme as a demonstration of the period of Chrishna’s
birth, would just as well have applied to the age of Noah as to
600 years after Christ, the position of the planets recurring
periodically in many given epochs of time; but, even if Dr.
Bentley could have succeeded in entangling the reason and
common sense of his sympathizers so deeply amongst astrologi-
cal calculations, that they could neither prove nor refute what
they could not understand, even then there were other
learned astronomers cotemporary with Dr. Bentley—such as
Baillie, Higgins, Playfair, &c.—who, with a set of calculations,
just as laboriously pursued, and just as exact, were enabled to
demolish Dr. Bentley’s theory, and reduce it to ashes. But,
beyond all this, the monuments, sculptures, temples, and
ancient poems still remained! Still, the memory of Chrishna
and his sects came looming up from the remotest ages.
The wars undertaken between rival sects, the worship
7


authenticated all over India, and the entire history
engraved in characters of enduring witness which no
flimsy attempts at astrological wrangling could obliter-
ate, still remained unaccounted for. Why do we
pursue the petty theme farther! Why waste time upon
recitals so humiliating to their chief actors, and so desperately
injurious to the system of modern faith, which bases its last
chance of defence upon a foundation of mere quicksand 1
Why ! Because within the last six months the author of this
treatise was called upon to read aloud to a large gathering of
intelligent listeners these very self-same groundless and utterly
false deductions of Dr. Bentley, reiterated in a work written
and published for the benefit of these Australian colonies by
one of their own most learned bishops—a gentleman who, with
the spiritual welfare of a large colony of persons entrusted to
his pastorship, deliberately disinters the exploded theory of
Bentley’s absurd “back reckonings,” and informs his uninformed
readers that the history of Chrishna, that terrible bugbear of
Christianity, was not published abroad to the world until some
centuries after the Christian era!
Let us close up this ungrateful and humiliating theme, by
pointing to the fact of the great champion’s (Dr. Bentley) final
recantation, and, in the words of Godfrey Higgins, show that
even this frail reed was ultimately snapped in twain by the
hand which first wielded it. On page 344 of the Anacalypsis,
Godfrey Higgins writes: —
“ Long after I had written the above respecting Mr. Bentley,
I found what at once settled the question; but as I think it
extremely desirable, in a case of such importance, that my
readers should see the steps by which I have gradually arrived
at my conclusions, I shall not expunge what I had previously
written.


“If any dependence can be placed on Mr. Bentley’s own
words, he was at last satisfied that the story of Chrishna having
been copied from Jesus Christ was not to be supported. In
.a letter from him, published by the Rev. J. Marsham, D.D.,
in his Elements of the Chinese Grammar, is the following
passage:—‘July 4th, 1813. Krishna was contemporary with
Yoodhist’hira (see the Geeia), and the epoch of Yoodhist’hira’s
birth was the year 2,526 of the Cali Yug of the present
■astronomers, or about 575 years before the Christian era. ’"
The italics are Mr. Higgins’s, and are doubtless intended
to give point to the last admission the words contain. Mr.
Higgins adds :
“ The fact of Chrishna’s living more than 500 years before
Christ, at once disposes of all the nonsense, both oral and
written, about the history of Chrishna being copied from
that of Christ After this, in another letter,
Mr. Bentley goes on to show by astronomical calculations
and proofs that he is correct, and that Chrishna was certainly,
as he had before said, more than 500 years before Christ.”
As the author of a very learned treatise on “ Ancient and
Modem Astronomy,” Dr. Bentley was at first hailed by all
true Christians as one of the most “able, as well as authoritative”
defenders of their faith. Why his recantation has not been
as widely circulated as his grave error, it remains for the
defenders of the faith to prove, yet we should scarcely have
expected to find a learned bishop re-affirming the well-exploded
error in the 19th century, and that without the slightest
allusion to the stupendous evidences which the entire land of
India, with all its priceless wealth of antique lore, scriptures,
temples, and monuments presents. Weighed against the
testimony which the history, traditions, and monumental
vestiges of Hindostan afford, Mr. Bentley’s theories for or
against the date of Chrishna’s advent amongst men, are no


more than so many straws, set up to show which way the-
winds of sectarian bigotry blow.
Christian authorities have been very busy during the last
eighteen centuries in the attempt to settle the doctrinal points,
which their Incarnate God never preached. Why have they not
been more particular in placing the period of his advent upon
earth some twenty centuries or so earlier 1 According to Mr.
Bentley, if they had only removed their first Christmas day
five hundred years back in time, they might have stood on safer
ground; but if they had been still wiser, and, like the great
“Sun of Righteousness ” they worship, fallen back in time a
whole sign, and set the date of their Incarnate God’s birth 2,1 GO
years before their present era, moving the Hindoo Avatar
on to its commencement, what a different answer they might
have rendered to the intrusive question—Which is the original
and which the copy 1
As it is, the Hindoo’s favourite Avatar was born 2,000 years,
too soon, or the Christian’s, 2,000 years to late. If one is the
fact, how can we fail to come to the conclusion that the other-
is the fraud of religious history '?
SECTION VIII.
THE SUCCESSION OF INCARNATE GODS DERIVED
FROM INDIA.
Recukrixg to the logical definitions of the Rev. Robert Taylor-
on the claim of the Christians to an original divine revelation,,
we might almost close our review at this point; the obvious


priority of the legend attributed to Christ, in the histories of
the first Boudha, and Chrishna, of the Hindoos, sufficiently
demonstrating the fact that, as far as any original revelation is
•concerned, there is not one iota of proof to justify such a claim
in behalf of Christianity.
In the best interest of true religious facts, however, and con ■
sequent abhorrence of audacious religious frauds, we shall
pursue the analysis commenced in the last sections, into still
wider fields of observation.
Besides the two great Avatars of India above referred to, we
have records in the scriptures and monumental remains of
India of several more incarnations, amongst whom we may
name India, the god of the Firmament ; Salivahana, a later
incarnation than Chrishna ; Jao, of Nepaul, whose crucified
figure is to be seen on many ancient sculptures throughout that
province; Rama, the fourth incarnation of Vishnu, and the
subject of the celebrated poem called the Ramayana ; Bali, of
Afghanistan, Wittoba, and Boudha Sakia, said to be the ninth
incarnation of Vishnu.
We have already alluded to the various notices which ancient
history furnishes concerning these Hindoo Avatars, we must
therefore proceed to consider how universally the specialties of
their legend permeates the religious faiths of other nations.
OF RELIGIOUS FAITH IN CHINA.
The Chinese claim for themselves an antiquity little short of
the Hindoos, although the latter affirm that the land of the
Mongols was originally settled by colonies from India. Be this
as it may, history proves that the Chinese calculated eclipses
correctly, and possessed a remarkably accurate knowledge of


astronomy, besides other arts and sciences, upwards of two
thousand years before the Christian era.
The doctrines taught by the celebrated sage, Confucius,
whose period is not much more than about 500 years before-
Christ, must not be taken as examples of Mongolian theology.
Confucius gave to his country a pure and beautiful code of
morality, but he originated nothing in connexion with theological
belief. In the compilation, attributed to him, of the Five
Volumes, or the Chinese sacred books, he simply re-arranged,
or, to use a modern phrase, edited, that which was in existence
thousands of years before. In these sacred books we find all
the traditions concerning paradise, the fall, the doctrine of
divine incarnations, the story of God-Men being born through
the maternity of a pure vifgin, and the vicarious atonement for
sin.
The Five Volumes state that—“ The source and root of all is
One. This self-existent unity necessarily produced a second ;
the first and second produced a third; these three produced
all.” The ancient emperors solemnly sacrificed every three-
years to “Him who is One in Three. . . . Tien is the Holy
One without a voice. The Holy One is Tien, speaking with a
voice —(the ivord). . . . By consulting the ancient traditions,
we know that though the Holy One will be born on earth, yet
He existed before anything was made.” One of the Five
Volumes, Yu King, says ;
“ The Holy One will unite in himself all the virtues of
heaven and earth. By his justice, the world will be re-estab-
lished in righteousness. He will suffer much. He must
pass the great torrent, whose waves shall enter his soul,
but he alone can offer up to the Lord a worthy sacrifice.”'
These prophecies of an incarnate God were supposed to bo-
fulfilled in the person of Boudha Sakia Mouni, whose doc


trines were introduced into China by his disciples, taking such
deep root amongst the people that Buddhism has completely
divided its empire over the Chinese mind with the doctrines of
Confucius. The worship of Boudha is celebrated under the
name of 80, and though during the many centuries that have
succeeded its introduction it has shared the fate of all legen-
dary systems, become corrupt, degenerate, and full of mystical
interpolations, the main features of the scheme are preserved,
and may be summed up in the following extract; —“ But
though details vary much in different countries, the prominent
features of Buddhism are everywhere the same. They all
teach of one invisible Source of Being, sometimes called the
supreme intelligence, sometimes by the name of his attributes.
. . . Boudha is said to have appeared four times in worlds (or
ages) preceding this, and always with the benevolent purpose
of withdrawing men from the vortex of illusions in which
matter has plunged them. Into this present age he (Boudha)
descended, in the form of Boudha Sakia Mouni. His mother
was a holy virgin (Maia), and his birth was foretold in a mir-
aculous dream. The object of his mission waste instruct those
who were straying from the right path; expiate the sins of
mortals by his own sufferings, and procure for them a happy
entrance into another life by obedience to his precepts and
“prayers in his name. He is always spoken of as one with God
through all eternity, and his most common title is the Saviour
of the world. As he has repeatedly assumed the human form,
so will there be repeated incarnations of his spirit.” —( Progress
Eeligious Ideas.)
“ Lamaism,” and many other corrupt forms of Buddhism,
are repeatedly cited by Christian writers in evidence of the
degradation into which the heathen world is sunk, and as a
proof how much said heathenism needs the salvatory religion
of Jesus Christ.
Such egotists forget that the dungeons of the Inquisition,
the massacres of St. Bartholomew, the horrors of the English
Star Chamber, the Puritanism of Hew England and Scotland,
&c., &c., &c., would form about as poor a representation of the


religion enunciated by Christ as the fanaticism of Lamaism
would do if presented as an illustration of the sweet and
gracious teachings of Boudha Sakia. Unfortunately, too, for the
success of Christian missions amongst the Chinese, the learned
men of the land—and there are many such—retort, as a certain
mandarin did to M. Le Hue, the eminent French missionary—
“ You are a man of prayer. Why do you steal our Boudha,
and offer him back to us as your Christ % Go to school, and
learn that Boudha was old enough to be grandfather to an age
o o o
of Christs before yours was born.” William Yon Humboldt
publishes the famous ten precepts, copied from the sacred books
of the Chinese, as an evidence that those who seek to convert
them might gain something by becoming themselves the
converts. They are these :
1. Thou shalt not kill even the smallest creature.
2. Thou shalt not appropriate to thyself what belongs to
another.
3. Thou shalt not infringe the laws of chastity.
4. Thou shalt not lie.
5. Thou shalt not calumniate.
6. Thou shalt not speak of injuries.
7. Thou shalt not excite quarrels by repeating the words of
others.
8. Thou shalt not hate.
9. Preserve faith in the holy writings.
10. Believe in immortality.
There is much in the teachings of Buddhism which, so far
from deserving the contemptuous epithets bestowed upon it,
and stimulating the egotism of Christians to change it into their
own system, might do honour to Christianity by being engrafted


upon it—that is, always provided there were found Christians
honest enough to render honour where honour was due, and
allow that they derived it from the Chinese, rather than
originated it after the Chinese had possessed it for ages.
THE EGYPTIAN TRINITY.
-Few religious legends are better known and more widely cir-
culated than that of the Egyptian Trinity—namely, Osiris the
Sun-God; Isis the representative of nature, the spouse and twin
sister of Osiris; and Horns, the Child, the representative of the
world of created forms.
The worship of Osiris, although extremely ancient, ante-
dating by many centuries the Mosaic age, is still claimed by
the Egyptians to be of a comparatively modern period, that is,
in comparison to the immense antiquity claimed for the pre-
ceding theocracy by which the land was said to have been
governed. Herodotus, who visited Egypt aboutfour centuriesand
a half before Christ, says, in his celebrated history of Egypt,
that the priests told him they kept the record of a Government
by a succession of thirty-six gods, the last of whom were
Osiris and his son Horus, and that all these preceded the rule
of mortal men, or the priests who bore the names of the
special temples in which they served. From the rule of Osiris
to the period recorded by Herodotus, they reckoned nearly
fifteen thousand years, and, in testimony of these immense
periods, they showed the great historian three hundred and
forty-one colossal images of the priests, every one of whom,
in the order in which they lived, was obliged to deposit in the
great temple at Thebes a statue of himself.
Herodotus, on this basis, allowing an average of three


generations for every century, gives an antiquity for the period
of Osiris of not less than eleven thousand years. Contemporary
monuments, the known period of the great pyramid, at least
a thousand years before the date of Moses' birth, together with
tombs, sculptures, and ruins which daze the mind and captivate
the senses by their stupendous grandeur, colossal proportions,
and incalculable antiquity, carry us back into those realms of
physical power and spiritual perception, which present us as
pigmies compared to the Titans of ancient Egypt.
And in the midst of these luxuriant unfoldments of mental
power and intellectual attainment, arises the momentous
question —What was the religious status of these antique
giants 1
From all the reliable sources open to us we have the best
reason to believe that the faith of the ancient Egyptian was
derived, like his national existence, from India. The wise and
world-renowned priesthood of Egypt taught of paradise, the
temptation and fall ; of original sin, of a triune god, divine
incarnation, and vicarious atonement; in a word, of all the
main features of belief common to Oriental nations, and subse-
quently plagiarized by the Christians.
As the central figure of all Egyptian theogony is Osiris, the
representative and embodiment of the famous astronomical
legend of the Sun-God, we select from a vast mass of authentic
history on the same subject, some extracts concerning this
celebrated personage, from the excellent treatise on Egyptian
theogony in The Progress of Peligious Ideas.
Our author says:—
“Of all Egyptian deities, Osiris is the name most
familiar to modern ears He appears to have
been like Siva of the Hindoos, in his general capacity


—the fructifying or generating power of the universe— ‘ the
sun.’ All the emblems of the sun were sacred to him, and
astronomical ceremonies celebrating the sun’s annual passage
through the zodiacal signs constituted much of his worship.
. . . . Reverence for the production of life introduced
into his worship the sexual emblems so common in Hindostan.
A serpent —the emblem of immortality—always accompanies
the image of Osiris. The hawk—considered as a bird of the
sun—was sacred to him, and his emblem was a winged globe,
representative alike of the sun and the bird, the wings being
significant of time and space.
“ Osiris, called the eldest son of time, being a general represen-
tative of life and the generating principle, caused a commixture
of ceremonies and emblems in his worship which has greatly
complicated the mythology of Egypt. He is represented as the
incarnation of deity, at whose birth angelic voices proclaimed
—the lord of the world is born !
“ Having gone forth to carry the arts and sciences to other
nations, his brother Typho (the winter), by a successful
stratagem, shut him up in a chest and threw him into the sea.
Isis (natureor the earth) —his spouse and sister—wandered about
in mourning garments, seeking for- the body, which at last was
found ; but Typho discovered it and tore it up into fourteen
pieces.”—(The fourteen lunar subdivisions of the ancient year.)
“ Isis gathered up the fragments and gave them burial at
Philoe,” where the famous statues of the holy family Osiris,
Isis, and Horus the Child, have been found, and plagiarized as
the holy family of Judea. “After his death, Osiris, resurrected,
is represented as descending into Amenti, Hades, or Hell to
rescue lost souls, and reascending into Heaven, where he remains
to dispense blessings to those who address prayers in his name ;
to judge the dead, and finally overcome the power of evil which
destroyed him.”
The second person of the Egyptian Trinity was Isis, the ■
Mother of Forms, the representative of nature, the inseparable
companion of Osiris, and the embodied idea of the feminine or-
receptive principle of life. Her emblems were numerous, and
are often greatly misunderstood. The egg, the hawk’s head, as -


twin with Osiris; the sistrum, a musical instrument which, in
sex worship, represented the ever-renewed virginity of Spring;
the human form with horns, significant of the crescent moon ;
or the head of the cow, symbol of maternity, these and many
other similar illustrations imply the astronomical and mythical
character of this favourite goddess. The most universal modes
of representing the image of Isis are either as nursing her
infant Horus, or bearing him in her arms. Horus, the third
person of the Trinity, is universally acknowledged to be the
symbol of created forms—the product or result of the divine
principle of generation, and, as such, an indispensable figure in
the symbolism of the Egyptian Trinity. Our space does not
permit of any extended notice of Egyptian theogony, although
it is (next to India) the most abundant in symbolical forms of
any of the antique faiths. Rich in ideality, Titanic in the
breadth and sublimity of executive power, the remains of
Egyptian civilization point back to a true Theocracy—a nation
ruled, formed, and fashioned by gods ; a people whose ideality
scaled the heavens, and brought up the fundamental bases of
things from the profoundest depths of the universe. All the
nations of antiquity sat with child-like reverence at the feet of
the Egyptian priesthood, and it is from the inevitable succession
of ideas transmitted through all ages, that we know that
Egypt upreared her cyclopean superstructure of civilization
upon the foundation-stone of Indian metaphysics, and bequeathed
it to all posterity through the inherited lore of younger nations.
The fruitage of her stupendous wisdom has not been lost—
as some writers affirm—in the mists of antiquity. Orpheus,
Solon, Thales, Pythagoras, and Plato, were auditors of her
priests, and interpreters of her noblest philosophy. It is now
unquestionably believed that the Greeks paraphrased the


famous Osiric and Isic mysteries, in those of Bacchus, Ceres,
Eleusis, etc.
The Grecian gods are hut poetical and flower-crowned
Embodiments of Egyptian ideas, and it is doubtful if a single
form in the elaborate Pantheon of Greece ever existed which
did not owe its birth to the fertile imagination of the
Egyptians. Abraham and his successors, up to Moses, and on
forward to the Evangelists of the Christian history, all derived
their elements-of theology from Egypt. Every authoritative
writer acknowledges that the Jewish Jehovah was but one of
the Egyptian tutelary spirits, or the Aleim, who ruled over days,
weeks, months, seasons, and elements. Bellamy, Parkhurst, Dr.
Shuckford, and many other accomplished scholars, have proved
conclusively that in multitudes of instances where the words
God, Lord, and the Lord God are rendered, in the common
version of the Hebrew Scriptures, the original was a plural word
for Deity, derived from the Egyptian Elohim, or Aleim. It is
only in such sentences as “ Let us make man” (Gen., chap, i.),
and “ The Lord God said, Behold the man has become as one
of us” (Gen., chap, hi.); also, in Gen., chap, hi., “When your
eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods ” —that the
translators have been faithful in rendering the plural, instead
of the singular number, for the Deific power spoken of.
Parkhurst, in his Greek and Hebrew Lexicon, shows that the
Hebrews were forbidden to pronounce the name of their God—
a superstition clearly derived from India. The name of
Jehovah, Jah, or Jao, was that applied with modifications to
a tutelary Deity of the Egyptians, one of the Elohim; a
Spirit of the Mountains; not the God of Eire, the Adonai,.
Adonis, or Lord God, whom Moses believed in and taught of,,
as appearing to him in the burning bush—an allegory, by the


way, significant of the solar fire, ever burning, but never
■ consuming the object it illuminates.
The most eminent Egyptologists—amongst them, Higgins,
Bunsen, Wilkinson, writers of undoubted authority—all show
that the modes of Egyptian worship were almost synonymous
with those instituted by Moses. The Oracle ship of Ammun,
■ one of the names of the Sun-God, was the original of the
Ark of the Hebrews, and was carried about in a similar way
on poles. Abraham unquestionably derived the rite of cir-
• cumcision from the Egyptians, as also the methods of sacrifice.
The institution of the Levites’ order, their dress and the
ornaments of the priests, were exact transcripts of Egyptian
models.
The fasts, feasts, and celebrations, the very instruments of
music, and the sacred dances practised by the Hebrews, were
pure imitations of Egyptian customs. The veneration once
bestowed upon the famous Apis, or Bull of Egypt, has already
been shown to have originated with the worship of the sun in
the sign of Taurus, the zodiacal bull. When Egyptian
. astronomers discovered that the precession of the equinoxes
had carried the sun into the sign of Aries, and a consequent
• change was instituted in the celebration peculiar to that
season, many severe sacerdotal conflicts arose. The celebrants
of the old worship resisted innovation with the utmost rancour,
and in the strife, it is said, the famous schools of Heliopolis
and Ammun were arrayed for many years against each other.
It was from the above-named change in the zodiacal signs that
the celebration of the Paschal Lamb was instituted. During
this solemnity, the votaries of the new faith, in order to
distinguish themselves from the Tauric worshippers, were
-accustomed to mark their dwellings with a certain red powder.


By this token they announced that they had duly observed
the sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb. When the Hebrews
became residents in Egypt, and insensibly fell into the
theological forms of belief prevailing around them, they
adopted the new worship, and in sign of conformity with its
customs, marked the door-posts of their houses with blood, a
piece of symbolism which the Jewish historians have mixed
up with the ancient Hindoo legend of the slaughter of the
innocents. Finally, they paraphrased this, as well as many
other Egyptian customs, into a piece of Jewish history, and
enlarged upon it until they had resolved it into the institution
of an original Jewish Passover.
In chapter ii. of Anacalypsis, we find these words :
“If the religion of Moses and the Hindoos were the same, it
is reasonable to expect we should find the celebrated Egyptian
festival of the Passover in both countries, and it is found
accordingly. We have it in the most solemn religious rites of
the Bramins, the sacrifice of the Yajna Lamb. I have no
doubt that, with the Hebrews, this succeeded to the Mithraitic
(Chaldean) sacrifice of the Bull, and that both rites celebrated
the Passover of the equinoxial sun in spring.
“ The history of the passage of the sun and of the Israelites
from Egypt affords a remarkable example of the double
meaning of the Hebrew books.
“ The story of the ten plagues of Egypt might be very
suitable for the rabble of Jerusalem and London, but the higher
classes in the former had, and, I should hope, in the latter now
have, too much sense to believe such degrading accounts of
Deity, as the literal meaning of this history exhibits.” . .
(Maimonides, the most learned of the Eabbins, clearly avows
that the Paschal Lamb was but a type of the astronomical
Lamb). . . “ Before the time of Moses, the Egyptians fixed
the commencement of the year at the vernal equinox.
“In the Oriental Chronicle it is said the day when the sun
entered the sign of Aries was held as a great festival, whereat
the Hebrews marked their door-posts with blood, the Egyp


tiaus with red. The Hebrew name for the celebration was
pedach, which means transit, and the Lamb itself is often called
Pesech, or the Passover. ‘ln India, the devotees throw red
powder on one another at the Huli, or vernal equinox.’ ‘This
powder is in imitation of the pollen or fructifying powder of
plants.’
“ A plant which does not produce this powder, or flour of
flowers, is useless, and not typical of the rays of the regenerator
of the earth—the sun in spring. This Huli festival is the
origin of Yule, and our word holy .”
The erudite author of the Anacalypsis descants at great
length on the many forms by which the opening of the
Egyptian year through the Paschal Lamb was celebrated; also
upon the many derivations which the name of the Lamb has
given birth to, until Agni, and the Latin Agnus, became the
Agnus Dei (“Lamb of God ”) of the modern Catholic Mass,
when the analysis closes. Amidst a mass of highly recondite
literature, drawn from Scriptural, traditional, and monumental
vestiges —as interesting to the candid seekers for truth as they
would be startling to modern “ defenders of the faith ” —we
have only room to notice two pieces of biography concerning
the great Jewish law-giver, Moses, which we do not find in any
of the Scriptures so vaguely attributed to his authorship.
The first of these is found in the celebrated Orphic verses,
attributed to a Grecian sage named Orpheus, a great traveller,
and one who wrote about twelve hundred years before the
Christian era. This compiler of the traditions of many nations
alleges that Moses was one and the same with Mises, signifying
a law-giver, and Bacchus, the sun, who, like Osiris, was repre-
sented as being picked up out of the water, in which he had
been exposed for fear of a tyrant king who had caused all
the male children of the kingdom to be slaughtered. The
Orphic legends also name this half-mortal, half-mythical being


Bimater, from his having had two mothers, the one who bore him,
and another who adopted him. He (Orpheus) says, Mises had
a magical rod by which he wrought great miracles, and which
he could change into a serpent at pleasure. He passed the
Bed Sea dry-shod at the head of an army; divided the rivers
Orontes and Hydaspus by the touch of his rod, and passed
through them dry shod. He drew water from the rock,
and wherever he marched the land flowed with milk and
honey.
If it be asked how it was that the characteristics of Bacchus,
the Sun-God, celebrated throughout India as Dyonisius, in
Egypt, Phoenicia, Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy, under
different names, came to be confounded with the famous law-
giver of the Hebrews, and especially how the slaughter of the
innocents —sculptured in the most antique temple in the world,
the Cave of Elephanta —could, thousands of years later than
its first inscription, be repeated in the history, first of the
Jewish Moses, and still later in that of the Jewish Christ—we
answer now as we would gladly do in more elaborate detail, if
space permitted, that many of the best and most profound
scholars, pronounce the Jewish Scriptures to be for the most part
cabalistic writings, full of allegory, and written in the veiled
mysticism common to the sacerdotal methods of the ancient
priesthood. Some original personages, of course, formed the
woof and web of the history, but the main pattern and colouring
of the fabric were drawn from Oriental sources and traditions
gathered up from the many nations amongst whom the Jews
were wanderers. Their Noah was but the transcript of many
similar legendary characters. Their Genesis contained only the
fragments of most ancient Eastern legends. Their Jephthah
was the Greek Agamemnon, with precisely the same history.
8


Their Samson, Hercules of the Egyptians and Greeks, para-
phrased. Elijah, Elisha, Joshua, and numbers of other
personages, believed to be such by the literal interpreters of
these mystic writings, represented the impersonated myths of
the astronomical religion, and all their prophets wrote cycular
legends, the true meaning of which can never be explained
until the famous cycular theories of Persian, Syrian, Phoenician,
Assyrian, and Egyptian astronomy are fully apprehended. To
return in brief to the reputed law-giver of the Jews.
The mere supposition that the history attributed to him in
the literal phraseology of the Jewish Scriptures could be true,
implies a subversion of human reason and lack of reverence for
the awful character of a Supreme Being, which amounts to the
insanity of credulity. Happily for the redemption of human
reason from the paralysis which priestcraft has so long
impressed upon it, the testimony afforded by the Orphic verses
that the chief features of the history had been applied to Osiris
at least a thousand years before the Mosaic era; that it had
been interwoven with the astronomical mythsof Eastern worship,
and celebrated in lands whose traditions were sinking into the
night of decay before the Jews had an existence at all; in a
word, that the story had been said and sung until the Jews, in
their communications with the Egyptians, must have become
as familiar with it as our babes become with nursery rhymes,
may easily answer the questions of trembling credulity, and
that without drawing at any greater length on accepted
authorities.
Full of overwhelming interest and instruction as the
mementoes of Egyptian civilization must prove to the scholar,
we must close our review by a brief extract from the
“ Progress of Religious Ideas.”


In the article on the Jews, Book L, the author says :
“Manetho,* as quoted by Josephus, states that the provinces
of Egypt rose against the shepherd race, and finally expelled
them. They were permitted to depart from Egypt with all
their families and effects, and make their way towards Syria.
But as they stood in fear of the Assyrians, who then had
•dominion over Asia, they founded a city in that country, which
is now called Judea, though others say the name of their
district was called —from being inhabited by the Pali, shepherds
—Palistan, the land of shepherds, and subsequently Palestine.”
Manetho narrates how King Amenophis—being desirous
of beholding the gods and attaining to the Divine powers of
prophecy and seership, enjoyed by one of his predecessors,
Orus—learned from the priests that, to attain his desire, he
must cleanse the land of lepers and other unclean persons.
In performing this office, and removing the numerous
lepers who abounded in the land to the deserted district
formerly inhabited by the shepherds, it was found that many
of the priesthood themselves were afflicted by the fell disease ;
hence, to make the renovation of the land perfect, these sacred
personages must also share the doom of the others. The
sacrilegious act of laying hands on the sacred persons of the
priests was warmly resented, and stimulated the exiles to a
general revolt, in which, it is said, they were led on by a ruler
named Onisarph, a priest of Heliopolis, whose remarkable
talents well fitted him for the office of a leader.
Onisarph, in the first place, enacted a law that his people
should neither worship the gods of the land nor abstain
from eating the animals held sacred under the old system of
* Manetho was high priest at Heliopolis, in Egypt, about three
hundred years before the Christian era. He wrote a history of Egypt
in the Greek language, fragments of which are still preserved.


Tauric worship. Onisarpli, as a priest of Heliopolis, unques-
tionably taught the worship of the sun in Aries, consequently
his enactments must have been unpopular enough to the advo-
cates of the old system. A long war ensued. Onisarpli invited
the expelled shepherds to join his standard, and after con-
stituting himself their leader, and ravishing the country with
tremendous power, himself and his forces were vanquished
and driven forth from the land by Amenophis and his son
Rampses. Such is an outline of the Egyptian history in
which the Exodus of the Israelites is recorded —a version
quoted by Josephus, and confirmed in some measure by oral
tradition.
The Onisarph who figures so prominently in these legends, is
said to have become the elected leader of the shepherds, and by
way of distinguishing him in his now character of law-giver,
he was at first named Mises, and subsequently Moses.
His traditional history was, according to custom, made up of
the temple legends which clustered around the god whom he
served; but of his real origin and character, no genuine details
may ever be expected to find their way down the stream of
time. As we shall have no other opportunity of commenting
upon the Jewish Scriptures, and their cabalistic meaning, we
will close this section by a few words of valuable and suggestive
philosophy from the author of Anacalypsis. On page 108, he
says :
“ The difference between the religion of Moses and that of the
surrounding nations consisted in this : the latter had become
corrupted by the priests, who had set up images in allegorical
representation of the zodiacal signs, which, in long periods of
time, the people came to consider as representations of real
deities. The true and secret meaning of these emblems, the
priests (that is, the initiated) took care to keep to themselves,


their object being to hold the people in a state of debasement,
that they might be more easily ruled. . . . The sacrifices
.and rites of Baal and Moloch, and the idolatries of Tyre and
Sidon, itc., were of the most horrible kind. The priests in all
ages have found that the more gloomy and horrible a religion
is, the better it has suited their purpose It was
to keep his people from falling into this degraded state that
Moses framed many of his laws. ■ To the original religions of
these countries he could' have had no objection, or else he
would never have adopted so many of their astronomical
■emblems, and called his God by the same names.
“ The adoption of the names, signs and emblems of the Magi
and Egyptians may be no proof of the sagacity of Moses, but
they sufficiently prove the identity of his religion with that of
the Magi before it was corrupted. . . . The brazen ser-
pent set up by Moses in the wilderness, and worshipped by the
Israelites till the time of Hezekiah. . . . The cherubim, under
the wings of which the God of the Jews dwelt —the faces of the
■cherubim, representing the four equinoxial signs of the ox, the
lion, the eagle (formerly the scorpion), and the man—all these
things were purely astronomical.
“Every ancient religion, without exception, had Cabala, or
secret doctrines, and the same fate attended them all.
“ In order that they might not be revealed, they were not
written, but only handed down by tradition.
“ In the revolutions of centuries, and the violent convulsions
of empires, they were forgotten. Scraps of the old tradition
were then collected and mixed with new inventions of the
priests, having the double object in view of ruling the people,
and concealing their own ignorance.
“ The twelve standards of the Israelites were the twelve signs
of the Zodiac ; the Ark was an exact copy of the Ark of
Osiris, set afloat in the Nile every year, and supposed to
sail to Biblos, in Palestine; the festival of the Passover at the
vernal equinox was an exact copy of the Egyptian festival at
the same time ; these and all the ornaments of the temple, altar,
•and priest, were, in each country alike, of purely astronomical
significance, though their secret meaning was studiously con-
■cealed in magical allegory and Cabala.
“ The reader will perhaps ask—What, then, is the truth


respecting the Old Testament ? It is difficult to answer this
question in a few words. . . . It is probably a collection of
tracts, mixed up with traditions, histories, and rumours of events,
collected together by the priests of an ignorant, uncivilized race of
shepherds, intermingled with the allegories and fictions in
which the ancient philosophers veiled their learning from the
eyes of the vulgar.
“ The Pentateuch is evidently a collection of different mytho-
logical histories, and of the transactions of Moses, the chief of a
tribe of wandering Arabs, who was believed to have brought his
people from the borders of Egypt, and to have conquered
Palestine
“ The treatises in the Pentateuch are put together in so
awkward and unskilful a way, that they would have passed as
the work of one person with none but such uncivilized bar-
barians as the Jews, if they had related to any of the common
concerns of life, and where the reasoning faculty of the human
mind could be brought into fair action; but in matters
connected with religion, this never has been done, and never-
will be. Eeason has nothing to do with the religion of
mankind generally
“To this the priests of to-day will reply; The circumstances
which mark identity in the religion of the Jews and Gentiles
we do not deny. The heathens copied almost all their super-
stitions from Moses and the Prophets. Probably to multitudes
of believers this will be very satisfactory ; a satisfaction that
may be expected amongst persons with whom reason does not
operate. To them it is of no consequence that those heathenish
superstitions which are alleged to have been copied from Moses
were in existence hundreds, and even thousands of years before-
Moses was born or thought of.”


SECTION IX.
THE PANTHEON OF INCARNATE GOD-MEN.
In a very industrious compilation of ancient history, pub-
lished by Mr. K. Graves, an American, under the title of
Sixteen Crucified Saviours, the author gives a list of thirty-
four Avatars or God-Men, whom he names in the following
order :
1. Ciirisiina, of Hindostan.
2. Boudha Sakia, of India.
3. Salivahana, of Bermuda.
4. Zulis, also Osiris and Horus, of Egypt.
5. Odin, of the Scandinavians.
6. Crita, of Chaldea.
7. Zoroaster and Mithra, of Persia.
8. Baal and Taut, of Phoenicia.
■9. Indra, of Thibet.
10. Bali, of Afghanistan.
11. Jao, of Nepaul.
1 2. \Y ittoba, of the Billingonese.
13. Tiiammuz, of Syria.
14. Atys, of Phrygia.
15. Xamotis, of Thrace.
10. Zoar, of the Bowzes. •
17. Adad, of Assyria.
18. Deva, Tat, and others, of Siam.
19. Alcides, of Thebes.
20. Mikado, of the Sintoos.
21. Beddru, of Japan.
22. Hesus, or Esos, and Bremiiilla, of the Druids.
23. Thor, Son of Odin, of the Gauls.
24. Cadmus, of Greece.
25. Hil and Teta, of the Mandaites.
26. Gentaut and Quaxalcote, of Mexico.
27. Universal Monarch, of the Sibyls.
28. Tsciiy, of Formosa.


29. The Logos of Plato (The Word).
30. Holy One of Xaca.
31. Po and Tien, of China.
32. Adonis, of Greece.
33. Ixion and Quirinius, of Pome.
34. Prometheus, of Caucasus.
Besides these legendary heroes, there are many more whom it
would be tedious even to catalogue, and some few important
names omitted from Mr. Graves’s list, to two or three of whom
we jmrpose to call attention in this section. We may remark,
however, that in tracing out the histories of his divine per-
sonages, Mr. Graves gives an exhaustive comparison of the
various items of faith professed by their worshippers, and
comes to nearly the same conclusion as the author of this
treatise—namely, that the chief elements of the legend are pre-
served in a more or less marked degree in every case, and may
be summed up thus : —The first pivotal pioint of all theological
faith is—the worship of an incarnate God who is born of a
virgin mother by a divine father.
This Avatar is prophecied of, andhis ajipearance is always made
in accordance with prophecy, at some special epoch, which bears
relation to other epochs defined by cycular periods. These
“ Saviours of the world ” are alway born at mid-winter ; always
excite the jealousy of some kingly tyrant, and, though them-
selves of I’oyal descent, are born in caves or mangers ; fain to
pass their infancy in obscurity, and not infrequently cause the
“ massacre of all the innocents ” in the district of their birth.
They are always miracle-workers, and are generally connected
in some mysterious way with serpents, who either oppose them
in conflict, or are made to represent the evil power adverse to
them. They generally perform the same class of miracles,
preach the highest morals of the age and land in which they


■appear ; are most benevolent, and act tlie part of reformers, and
especially that of censors of the theological abuses of their
time. They feed multitudes, devils, heal the sick ;
finally they succumb to the powers of evil that oppose them ;
•die a violent death—very often by crucifixion ; descend to
the lower regions to rescue lost souls ; reascend to heaven, and
thenceforth become judges of the dead, mediators, redeemers
of men, who offer vicarious sacrifices to God for the sins of
the people.
Without following Mr. Graves in his elaborate and circum-
stantial methods of comparing the myths of many nations upon
the above points, we present them in summary, as examples of
the kind of doctrine which is invariably found pervading the
histories of all the incarnate gods, commencing with the first
Boudha, and ending with the Avatar of the J ews.
THE GOD-HEN, OR DIVINE INCARNATIONS, OF GREECE
AND ROME.
We have already reminded our readers that the succession of
ideas which the providences of history have transmitted from
age to age, and land to land, bring down the main features of
ancient theology in direct lines from India, through Egypt,
China, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Arabia, Asia Minor, and
Palestine; to the Greeks, Homans, Celts, Gauls, modem
Europeans, Americans, and Australasians; from pre-historic
to historic ages ; from the Boudha of the Tauric constellations
to the Christ of Aries, and all preserve the types of the Sun-
God’s history ; all impersonate his legend in the national forms
of differing lands, and renew the antique garb, with the shreds
and patches of ever increasing theological complications, for the


benefit of modem fanaticism, and the edification of those who-
are contented to accept of priestcraft in lieu of religion.
Midway between the most ancient metajdiysics of India and
the most modem materialisms of Christianity stand the exqui- ■
site ideality and glowing philosophy of the Grecian sage, and it
is to some of the most prominent embodiments of the universal
solar legend, embellished by the luxuriant fancy and graceful
imagery of the classical Greek mind, that we now call our
readers’ attention. Slight as may be the sketches here pre-
sented, we have but to transfer them to Babylon, and re-olothe
them with the fervid orientalism of that magnificent land, to
find our Prometheus converted into Bel; or, with another still
slighter change, to Syria or Persia, where we recognize him in
the features of Adonis or Mithra.
Wandering farther north, and changing the beneficent rays of
the sun, illuminating the flowery plains of Illium, to the ice-
bound regions of Scandinavia, we should recognize the beautiful
Balder, or the terrible Thor; and a still less perilous flight
across the blue waters of the Mediterranean, would convert the
beneficent Saviour of mankind, Esculapius, into the same high
sounding title at Palestine, or the no less revered Boudha of
the ancient Cingalese.
Commencing with a brief notice of the far-famed Samian
sage, Pythagoras, we shall have no difficulty in recognizing the
family likeness which the stream of time has washed down from
India to Greece. The general details of this celebrated per-
sonage’s life, scientific discoveries, and theurgic achievements,
are so well known that we shall only touch on those particular
points which bear upon the subject of our inquiry, and we can-
not do this more concisely or on a more authentic basis than by
giving some extracts from tlie Anacalypsis.


“ The reader will recollect that in our observations on the
Chrishnaof India, some difference between him and Jesus, relat-
ing to the immaculate conception, was observed by Mr. Maurice,
and laid hold of as a point by which he could ridicule the idea
of the identity between the histories of Chrishna and Christ.
The life of Pythagoras will at on,ce show where the Christians
could have found the particulars which differed from the history
of Chrishna.
“The first striking circumstances in which the history of'
Pythagoras agrees with that of Jesus are, that the former was
born at Sidon, the latter at Bethlehem, both in Syria. The
father of Pythagoras, as well as the father of Jesus, was ■
prophetically informed that his wife should bring forth a son,
who should be a benefactor to mankind. They were both born
when their mothers were from home on journeys—Joseph and
his wife having gone up to Bethlehem to be taxed, and the ■
father of Pythagoras having travelled from Samos, his residence,
to Sidon, on mercantile concerns. Pythais, the mother of
Pythagoras, was overshadowed by the Spectre or Ghost of the
God A])ollo, who afterwards appeared to the husband, and
informed him of the divine origin of the child about to be born.
From these circumstances, Pythagoras was known as the ■ Son of
God, and was supposed by the multitude to be under divine
inspiration.”
His youth spent in Egypt, divine life, noble teachings, the
extraordinary miracles ascribed to him, the persecutions by
which he was ultimately destroyed, and the fact that he lived,
and his history was published abroad at least some centuries
before the advent of Christianity, are all circumstances too
well known to need farther notice.
In the celebrated Orphic verses are to be found, amongst
notices of other incarnate gods of Greece, elaborate descriptions.
of the famous Hercules. This celebrated myth has most com-
monly been identified with the equally mythical Samson of the
Hebrews, that portion of Samson’s history relating to Delilah,
and his shaking the temple from its foundation, &c., being a


•direct paraidira.se of the mythological Hercules history, as
sung of in the Orphic verses described in Bell’s Pantheon,
Parkhurst’s Greek Lexicon, and other classical works. There
are, however, many other points of resemblance between the
history of the Greek and Jewish God-men which are too striking
to be omitted. Hercules, or Alcides, as he was called in
Greece, was always claimed to be the Son of God (Jupiter),
by a human mother—Alemena, wife of a Theban king. The
date of his birth was fixed about twelve centuries and a half
before the Christian era; yet his famous twelve labours, and
the remarkable virtue and benevolence attributed to him,
procured him the title of “ Saviour and Benefactor of Man-
kind” twelve centuries before it was conferred on his Jewish
successor in Palestine.
The Rev. Mr. Faber, in his Greek Antiquities, commenting
•on Hercules as the evident impersonation of the solar myth,
says :
“ On the sphere, he is represented in the act of contending
with, the serpent, the head of which is under his foot; and
this serpent, we are told, is that which guarded the tree with
the golden fruit in the midst of the garden of the Hesperides.
“ But the garden of the Hesperides, as we have already
seen, was no other than the garden of Paradise, consequently,
the serpent of that garden, the head of which is crushed
beneath the heel of Hercules . . . must necessarily be a
transcrijit of that serpent whose form was assumed by the
tempter of our first parents.” . . Parkhurst, in his Greek
Lexicon, says : —“ It is well known that by Hercules was
meant the sun, or solar light, and his twelve famous labours
have been referred to his passage through the zodiacal signs.
But the labours of Hercules seem to have had a still higher
view, and to have been originally designed as emblematic
memorials of what the real Son of God and Saviour of the
world was to do, and suffer, for our sakes. . . .”


If the reader cannot recognize into what realms of comparison
the joint admission of these two reverend scholars are drifting,,
our words of explanation could do no more by way of
enlightenment.
In Bell’s Pantheon we have a full account of another cele-
brated God-man, whose worship commenced at a very early
date, and, after having been established for many centuries
in Phoenicia and Egypt, subsequently became transferred to
Greece. Prom the fact that several splendid temples were
erected to him, a vulgar opinion prevailed that the worship of
Esculapius originated in Greece.
Some centuries after Esculapius had received divine
honours at Epidaurus, he was formally adopted as one of the-
gods of Rome, and about 280 years before the Christian
era his worship was celebrated at Rome with the utmost
splendour. This incarnate God-man was represented as the
son of the virgin Coronis, by Apollo, the sun-god, whose
oracle recognized and proclaimed his divine origin. In infancy
he was brought up amongst shepherds, who at once perceived
his divine nature by the rays of glory which encircled his
head. In manhood he cured the sick, raised the dead, and by
aid of liis. staff, wreathed around by a serpent which he had
conquered, he performed such extraordinary miracles of healing
that he was always termed “ the good Saviour,” and, after a
violent death, was worshipped as the benefactor of mankind
and the judge of the dead. The cock and serpent were his
emblems, and the miracles related of him are so curiously
prophetic of the still later performances in Judea, that we cite
one as an example.
The biographer of Proclus, the Greek philosopher,
writes :


“ The daughter of Archiades, and wife of Theagenes, when
she was yet but a young maiden, and living with her parents,
was seized with a grievous and incurable distemper.
“ All help from the physicians failing, her father ap»plied to
the philosopher (Proclus), entreating him to pray for his
daughter. He therefore went to the temple of Esculapius,
intending to pray for the sick woman to the god; for the city
(Athens) was at that time blessed in the undemolishod temple
of the Good Saviour, but while he was praying, according to the
ancient form, a sudden change appeared in the damsel, and she
was immediately restored to health, for the Saviour, as being
God, easily healed her.”
Middleton, in his Free Enquiry, writes :
“ Strabo informs us that the temples of Esculapius were
constantly filled with the sick, and that tablets were hung
all over the walls, describing the cures effected by ‘ the
Saviour.’ There is still a remarkable fragment of one of
these tablets extant, and exhibited by Greuter in his collection,
as it was found in the ruins of Esculapius’ temple in the
island of the Tyber, at Rome, which gives an account of two
blind men restored to sight by Esculapius, in the open view,
and with the loud acclamations of the people acknowledging
the power of the god.”
What a pity but what this miracle had occurred three
hundred years later ! the Christians would have been at no
loss to determine from whence the Romans borrowed their
narrative.
We conclude this sketch by an extract from Addison’s
translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, in which the following
prophecy, relating to the future of the infant Esculapius, will
be familiar to every schoolboy, and would be, of course, deeply
interesting to every Christian, could the time to which it relates
have been pushed forward, as above suggested, two or three
centuries.


‘ ‘ Once, as the sacred infant she surveyed,
The god was kindled in the raving maid, *
And thus she uttered her prophetic tale :
‘ Hail, great Physician of the world, all hail!
Hail, mighty infant, who in years to come,
Shall heal the nations and defraud the tomb !
Swift be thy growth, thy triumphs unconfined,
Hake kingdoms thicker, and increase mankind ;
Thy daring act shall animate the dead,
And draw the thunder on thy guilty head ;
Then shalt thou die, but from the dark abode,
Shall rise victorious, and be twice a god.’ ”
In the same smoothly-flowing rhymes, Addison, whose versi-
fication of Ovid has so familiarized the world with some of the
most curious elements of Grecian mythology, gives us the
history of still another and yet more celebrated sun-god—
namely, the Indian Dyonisius, or the Greek Bacchus. The
specialty of this famous myth seems to he the representation of
the sun in the grand festivities of harvest, and the season of
vintage. It is for this reason that the Greeks, to whom this
season was of all others the most festive and welcome, commingled
so strangely the rites of Ceres, the corn-harvest goddess, and
those of Bacchus, the patron or representative of the solar
energy in the grape harvest. In India this god was obviously
counfounded with, if not the actual original of Siva, the prin-
ciple of generation, as well as destruction. His worship was
also extensively practised throughout Phoenicia and Syria, where
he was known as Hesus. He is also considered to be synony-
mous with Adoneuos, the Giver, and some mythologists have
identified him both in history and character with the Egyptian
Osiris, also the symbol of the sun in summer. Certain it is that
the Osiric mysteries were transferred from Egypt into Greece,
* Pythoness or Sybil.


where they became the Bacchic rites, just as the mysteries of
Isis (Nature) became in succeeding centuries, the mysteries of
Eleusis, in which Ceres, the queen of heaven, and representative
of the fruitful earth, was the central figure. Orpheus distinctly
identifies Bacchus with Osiris, whose history was subseqtiently
transferred to Moses; but Ovid and Horace describe him, as
usual, as the son of a god, by a mortal woman—as concealed
from the wrath of a tyrant king in a chest which was set afloat
on the waters; rescued by a king’s daughter, by whom the
divine infant was brought up. Ultimately he becomes the great
miracle-worker ; is worshipped as the saviour of men, and their
redeemer from the storms, tempests, and sufferings of winter;
alternately adored as a god, and persecuted by adverse powers,
he is finally torn in pieces, like Osiris; like him, however, and
in imitation of the solar legend, he is annually resurrected and
annually reasceuds to his place in the heavens, to be re-born and
to re-enact the successive events of the sun-god’s yearly myth.
Apollo, Mercury, and Adonis, are all incarnations with frag-
ments of the same history, each of them being “ Sons of God,”
by mortal woman ; each being for a time incarnate on earth for
the benefit of mankind; each destroyed and received up into
heaven again, as mediators between the Most High Zeus, the
great Unknown and Unknowable, and sinful men. The last,
and perhaps the most poetical of all these Greek Avatars, has
been celebrated by the renowned tragic poet -ZEschylus, under
the name of Prometheus. There have been so many exquisite
poems and popular descriptions given of this famous myth, that
one is at a loss to point to the best version extant. Prome-
theus, “ himself a god,” is represented as descending to earth,,
and for the sake of elevating humanity to a higher standard
than mere forms of clay, he steals the divine fire of immortality


from heaven, and by infusing into men the deific principle,
renders them, like himself, sons of God.
For this act of sacrilege, the god-man is doomed to be nailed
to a cross and exposed on Mount Caucasus, until death trans-
lates him once again to a triumphant re-ascent into the heaven,
the gates of which he thereby for ever unlocks to the human race.
In writing of this god, Mr. Graves says very concisely ; “In
the account of Prometheus of Caucasus, as furnished by
Seneca, Hesiod, and other writers, it is stated that he was
nailed to an upright beam of timber, to which were affixed ex-
tended arms of wood, and this cross was situated near the
Caspian Straits.” The New Am. Cyclopaedia, vol. i., p. 157,
says ; “ It is doubtful whether there is to be found in the whole
range of Greek letters, deeper pathos than that of the divine
woe of the demi-god Prometheus, crucified on the Scythian
crags for his love to mortals.” Mr. Graves adds :
“In Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary, and the Anacalypsis,
may be found the following particulars :— ‘ At the final exit of
this god, the whole frame of nature became convulsed; the
earth shook, the rocks were rent, the graves were opened, and
in a storm which seemed to threaten the dissolution of the
universe, the solemn scene for ever closed, and the Saviour gave
up the ghost.’ ”
Mr. Taylor makes the statement in his Syntagma (p.
95), that the whole story of Prometheus’s crucifixion, burial,
and resurrection, was acted in pantomime in Athens five
hundred years before Christ. For further particulars con-
cerning this celebrated Avatar, the reader is advised to
study Hlschylus’s sublime tragedy of “ Prometheus
Bound,” as acted in Athens some five centuries before the
Christian era. Those unversed in classical lore, may now obtain
9


fine translations of this noble work by Potter and other
distinguished writers. Failing in this, let them consult any
of the four books of the New Testament, in which they will
find the life, death, sufferings, and main incidents of the
Promethean tragedy, plagiarized under another name. True,
the Greek version of the story was published abroad at least
five centuries before the Jewish ; but as the latter has been sub-
ject to thousands of revisions, alterations, interpolations, and
amendments, undertaken in different centuries to suit the views
of interested commentators, the reader will have all the benefit
of these “ modern improvements ” in the gospel version. • For
the original of ALL originals, consult the sacred books and
still older monumental scriptures of the Hindoos, in which the
entire legend may be studied in its primeval freshness and
antique ideality.
SECTION X.
THE LAST OF THE AVATARS AND HIS RELATIVE POSITION
IN HISTORY.
There are many students of religious history in the world,
and some into whose hands this little volume may fall, who
have been accustomed to think the all of religion is comprised
in their forms of faith, and who mistake their opinions for well-
proven facts.
To such persons, the preceding pages will not he judged by
the weight of evidence which accompanies the statements
they contain, but rather by a comparison of those statements
with their own preconceived prejudices, and the unreasoning


belief that whatever is opposed to their faith must be false.
Readers of this temper, if they deign to oppose our heretical
doctrines with any show of argument at all, would do so in the
usual fashion, substituting faith for reason, and asking in fear
and trembling, lest the very contact of logical reason should
tarnish the mystic aura of unreasoning faith. “ Where, then,
do you place our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and Him
crucified ? ”
Author. —Amongst all the other Lords and Saviours of
history, only ranking him as the last of the Avatars, instead of
—as you would urge—the original of the scheme.
Christian. —But you seek to destroy the foundation of our
faith on the testimony of heathen writers, heathen scriptures,
and heathen vestiges only. We who are the salt of the earth,
the chosen of the Lord, and the special recipients of His Divine
revelation, cannot stoop to contend with evidence derived from
heathen sources, and proved alone by heathen records.
Author. —Who made the heathen ? Do they derive their
origin from the same creative source as yourselves, or do you
teach of more Gods and more Creators than one 1
Christian. —Oh, there is but one God, of course ; that is,
three Gods in one, and one in three, &c. ; and, no doubt, this
Divine Trinity created all men—the heathens as well as the
Christians, but
Author. —lf this be so, then why should not the testimony
of one part of God’s creatures be as good as that of another 1
and who is to determine that the legend originated by the
heathen is not divine revelation, as well as the copy of that
legend plagiarized by the Christians 1
Christian. —Because we have the testimony of God’s own
word in the Bible.


Author. —How do you know the Bible is God’s own word?
Christian. —Do not Jesus and the prophets, the patriarchs,
and, in short, the Bible itself, say so ?
Author. —lf they did, that would not make it true. But
neither Jesus, nor the prophets, the patriarchs, nor the Bible
itself, claim any divine inspiration for its utterances, or any
infallibility for its teachings. On the contrary, many parts of the
Bible declare that it can only be understood spiritually, and that
“ the letter killeth.” Some of its most simple narratives are
affirmed to be allegories, and throughout its pages no claim is
ever set up for its divine authenticity. In the face of those
scientific revealments which resolve the chief portions of its
writings into cabalistic allegories, it would scarcely matter
to the true scientist, what its alleged grounds of authority
were.
No book can witness for itself without ample corroborative
proof, and all scholastic proof is in direct antagonism to your
claim.
Beyond this, the internal evidences of your Scriptures are
fatal to your assumptions. For example, all the books of the
Pentateuch, the histories of Noah, Abraham, the patriarchs,
and Moses, are direct and glaring plagiarisms from the Scrip-
tures and traditions of far older nations than the Jews; nay,
the very personages you claim to be such, are so confounded
with solar myths, that the most learned commentators are at a
loss to discover where the myth ends, and the history begins.
During the two great epochs of the Assyrian and Persian
captivities, also, the cities, temples, records and books of the
Hebrews were destroyed. It was confessedly to Ezra that the
Jews owed the re-construction of any scriptural records, and
that at a very late period in their national existence, and from


the oral gossip of the ancient men of the tribe, from whose
.sayings and traditions alone, the sacred word of God contained
in your Old Testament was compiled.
As for your prophetic writings, we have shown in former
sections how useless it would be to attempt to unlock their
■cabalistic mysteries without the key of astronomical symbolism
and cycular calculations. Again : The entire of the New
Testament turns upon the existence of an Incarnate God, whose
history we have shown you was published abroad in every
•country of the earth thousands of years before the Jews were
known as a nation. You cap establish no claim, then, either
to originality, truth, or special revelation, until you have dealt
with and accounted for all antecedent records of a similar
character. The mere fact that you designate these records
“ heathenism,” proves nothing, explains nothing, cannot blot
them out of existence, or show your Incarnate God is
entitled to the characteristics these records assign to others.
You must produce more stringent tokens of original divinity
for your Avatar before the heathen histories can be sneered or
abused out of the world’s logical acceptance.
Christian. —You throw away the Bible, deny the Son of God,
revile the sacred word, and trample on the cross ! How can
we contend with such blasphemous infidelity ?
Author. —Stereotyped terms of accusation, and old stories
which prove nothing; abusive epithets which convey no proof
and offer no rebutting testimony to our stubborn facts 1 Prove
that the Bible is the word of God, Jesus the Son of God; that
the cross is aught more than the cross of every other Eastern
nation, and that we are infidel to the truth instead of to your
theories; then, and not till then, your words will have some
meaning.


Christian. —lf you will not accept of the sacred record
Author. — Prove that it is sacred.
Christian. —We refer you to the history of Christianity itself,,
and the witness afforded by the faith of the most civilized
nations of the earth.
Author. —We accept your new ground, and propose to select
from several millions of records a few passages illustrative of
the opinions of the. most authoritative writers on Christianity,
and that at periods so nearly in approximation with the time
fixed for the scene of the Christian drama that it would have
been impossible to forget or falsify its main incidents, had
they been historically true. Let our first witness be from
the pages of the much-vaunted “word of God” itself. How
truly its authors wrote, we may judge from the following,
passages :
“ But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of
God, what shall we say? ” (Bom. iii. 5.)
“ For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my
lie, unto his glory, why yet am I also judged as a sinner 1 ”
(Bom. iii. 7.)
“ For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
they should believe a lie : that they all might be damned.”
(2 Thess. ii. 11-12.)
“ Which things are an allegory.” (Gal. iv. 24.)
“ And communicated to them that gospel which I preach
amons; the Gentiles, but privately to them that were of reputa-
tion.” (Gal. ii. 2.)
“ God also hath made us able ministers of the Hew Testament,
not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter killeth, but
the .spirit giveth life.” (2 Cor. iii. 6.)
We now turn to some of the most authentic of the early
Christian writers, foremost amongst whom stands the celebrated
Eusebius, a writer born at or about the year 288 of the-
Chi-istiau era, and whose works, especially his “ Ecclesiastical


History,” are quoted with scarcely less veneration and implicit
belief than the “Holy Scriptures.”
In the first book of his great history, this devoted and
blindly-bigoted partisan of Christianity, heads his fourth
chapter with these remarkable words :
“That the religion published by Jesus Christ to all nations
is neither new nor strange .”
“Neither new nor strange,” indeed, for in several succeeding
chapters he conclusively proves that all the doctrines, words,
works, epistles, and gospels of Christianity, were synonymous
with the words, works, and writings of the most ancient
Essenes or Therapeuts, a sect which flourished and was
widely known both in Judea and Alexandria "for over two
hundred years before the Christian era.
In the 17th chapter of his second book, Eusebius says dis-
tinctly : —“ Those ancient Therapeutic were Christians, and
their ancient writings were our gospels and epistles.” That the
universal resort of the Christians—namely, to pretend that all
antique truth or philosophy was borrowed from them —may be-
come of no effect, we may remind our readers that the most
circumstantial and complete history of the Essenes that was
ever published was written by Philo, a learned Alexandrian Jew,
who was himself one of their order, and who was born about
forty years before the period assigned for the birth of Christ.
The Rev. Robert Taylor, in commenting on the important
admission of Eusebius above quoted, says ;
“ Lardner, in his Credibility of the Christian Evidences,
quotes this astonishing confession of the great pillar of the
pretended evidences of the Christian religion, and shows how
aware he was of the fatal inferences with which it teems.”


Fautus, the learned Manichean bishop of Christianity,
writing in the fourth century, says;—
“It is an undoubted fact that the New Testament was not
written by Christ himself, nor by his ajiostles, but a long
while after their time, by some unknown persons, who, lest
they should not be credited when they wrote of affairs they
were little acquainted with, affixed to their works the names
of apostles, or of such as were supposed to have been their
companions, and then said that they were written according
to them.”
Mons. Daillee, a learned French writer, in his fine work on
The Ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Religion, says :
“The Papists took their idolatrous ceremonies and worship
of images from the most ancient heathen religions.”
“ There is no difference between Pagan and Catholic worship,
but only this, that names and titles are changed.”— Ludovicus
Virus.
“All the heretical forms of Christianity were borrowed from
the heathen.” — Epiphainus.
“It mightily affects me to see how many there were in the
earliest times of the church who considered it as a capital
exploit to lend to heavenly truth the help of their own inven-
tions, in order that the new doctrine might be more readily
allowed among the Gentiles. From which source, beyond
question, sprang innumerable books under the name of the
Lord and his saints and apostles, which in no wise favoured
even the least of their doctrines.” — Casauhon.
“ Such was the licence of inventing, so headlong the readiness
of believing in the first ages, that the credibility of transactions
derived from thence must have been hugely doubtful, and thus
the Church of God has reasonably to complain of its mystical
times.”— Evidences of Church Ilistorg ( Bishop Fell).
“ Ecclesiastical history reads nothing but the roguery and
folly of bishops and churchmen.”— 22ml Epistle of Grotius.
Our space does not permit of our inserting here any descrip-
tion of the Therapeuts or Essenes above alluded to, but if the


reader will .study the works of Philo, or take tlie second book of
Eusebius’s famous “ Ecclesiastical History,” lie will therein find
so perfect a description of the character, doctrines, habits,
miracles, and teachings of Jesus Christ, that it will be necessary
to assure himself that it is the great Christian partisan
Eusebius who is writing, and that he is describing a sect, who
lived lomj anterior to Christ, and not a Christian community.
The learned Basnage, in his history of the Jews, says that
although Philo’s testimony clearly enough proves the Essenians
and Therapeutic were neither Catholics nor Monks, the
Christians, Catholics, and Monks conclusively enough demon-
strate their origin to have been from the Essenians, seeing that
they derive all their doctrines and manners from thence—that is,
if two distinct sects should not present exactly the same features
without copying from one another. Rev. Robert Taylor, in a
most elaborate argument, from every possible
source that the sect of the Essenes was the root and foundation
of the later Christians, concludes an array of exhaustive and
unanswerable proof by showing that in this way only is
accounted for, the fact that Jesus and his followers constantly
alluded to a church and church organizations already in existence,
and flourishing before the period of his death and his followers’
attempts to inaugurate his religion. Mr. Taylor adds :
“ Throughout all these epistles we find the gospel spoken of as
already preached, to every creature under the sun ; Scriptures
continually alluded to of high antiquity, churches already
established, distinct orders of bishops, elders, priests, deacons,
Ac., exactly as described by Philo in his account of the Essenes,
but an impossibility amongst a sect just sprung into existence,
and one whose scriptures were not in St. Paul's time even in
existence. From the researches of Prof. Upham, of Bowdoin
College, U.S.A., whose long residence in the scenes he describes
entitles him to pronounce with absolute certainty upon their


geographical positions, we gather the following significant
details :
“ ‘He came upon the sea of Galilee through the midst of the
coasts of Decapolis.' —(Mark vii. 31). The name of Decapolis
was not known before the reign of Kero, and it had no coasts.
‘“He departed from Galilee and came into the coasts of Judea
beyond Jordan.’ —(Matt. xix. 1). The Jordan itself was the
eastern boundary of Judea, and there were no coasts of Judea
beyond it.”
The writer of the fourth gospel, claimed by Christians to have
been the beloved disciple, and an eye-witness of Jesus’ life and
acts, writes of Annas, the high priest, at the time when Caiaphas
is said to be holding that office. Again he says, “ Caiaphas
being high priest that year,” when the office was not merely an
annual one, but, according to Josephus, was held by Caiaphas
ten years. The same statement, repeated in Luke, and several
times in John, thus—“ In the high priesthood of Annas and
Caiaphas,” proves the writers to have been ignorant of Jewish
institutions.
“Bethany beyond Jordan” is another solecism which proves
the writer to have been wholly ignorant of .what he wrote
about. There did not exist any Bethany beyond Jordan, and
though Origen subsequently tried to account for this passage
by suggesting that there might have been two Bethanies, most
reliable authorities admit that there might have been—but that
there were not.
“John was baptizing in Aenon, near to Salim in Judea,
because there ivas much ivater there.” Such a place as Aenon
was unknown even in the third century, and Aenon signifies a
spring. The writer did not understand his own language, then,
in pretending that a spring was the name of a place.
The account in the fourth gospel of the Pool of Bethesda, with


all its circumstantial description and miraculously creative
powers, is, like the miracle performed there —a fiction. Neither
Josephus nor any of his contemporaries mention such a
place; nor has any such locality, nor even a tradition of its
existence, been found, except in the fertile imagination of the
Evangelist.
“ Near a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar.” No
such place was ever known, and though the most elastic
“ explanations ” have been fitted to this difficulty, in the hope
of explaining it away, such great Biblical scholars as Credner,
Ewald, Hengstenberg, &c., only make confusion worse con-
founded by striving to find places to fit Sychar that won’t tit,
and meanings for the term that won’t apply.
Taylor, in a still longer and more damaging list of Bible
impossibilities than we could find room for in many sections,
describes their gross inapplicability to Jewish authorship thus :
—“ ‘lie departed into Galilee, and leaving Nazareth, came and
divelt at Capernaum ; which is much such geographical accuracy
as if one should relate the adventures of a hero who departed
into Middlesex, and, leaving London, came and dwelt in Lom-
bard-street ; ” or, to bring the matter nearer home, who departed
into New South Wales, and leaving Sydney, came and dwelt in
George-street, <C-c., <Lx., <L-c.
Christian. —And so you first make our Lord and Saviour’s
divinity a myth—an imitation of scores of other pagan heroes
—and then you show, upon the strength of a few indiscreet
remarks of the great and good Eusebius, that the very Christian
religion itself was but a re-hash of some contemptible sects who
flourished before Christ, and happened to teach, preach, and
live out the same doctrines and life that he lived. Worse than
all, you abuse the Word of God by attempting to prove that


the very gospels were written by foreigners, ignorant of the
geography and customs of Palestine ! Have you never heard, 0,
child of perdition ! how the good Justin Martyr, in his famous
apology for Chistianity, and subsequently the divinely-inspired
Chrysostom, both exjdained all these little discrepancies and petty
■ difficulties by showing that the devil—that cunning adversary, ever
seeking whom he might devour—jmt it into the heads of the heathen
to invent these things first, so that ivhen the Lord and Saviour of
Men should really be born lie should not be believed in.
Leaving, however, the realm of polemics and vain disputations,
at least you must acknowledge that, in Jesus, the world has
the highest model of the purest life, and the divinest teaching
that was ever yet given to humanity.
Author. —Even there we cannot join issue with the Christians.
Let the following examples of pagan morality and ethics sj)eak
for themselves :
“ God, who is perfect wisdom, and perfect happiness, is the
final refuge of the man who has liberally bestowed his wealth,
who has been firm in virtue, and who honours and adores the
Great One.”
“ Preserve thyself from self-sufficiency, and do not covet the
property of another.”
“ The way to beatitude is only open to him, who, without
omission, speaketh the truth.” —Vedas, the most ancient of the
Hindoo sacred books.
“ Thou shalt not kill even the smallest creature.”
“ Thou shalt not appropriate to thyself that which belongs
to another.”
“ Thou shalt not infringe the laws of chastity.”
“ Thou shalt not lie.” “ Thou shalt not calumniate.” “ Thou
shalt not speak of injuries.” “ Thou shalt not excite quarrels.”
■“ Thou shalt not hate.” “ Preserve faith in the holy writings.”
“ Believe in immortality.”— Greed of Boitdha Saida.
“Do to another what you would he should do to you. And
do not to another what you would not should be done to you.


Thou only needest this law alone. It is the foundation of all
else of good.” —Maxim 2 ith, Confucius.
“ Let not soft slumber close thine eyes
Before thou recollectest thrice
Thy train of actions thro’ the day—
" Where have my feet found out their way ?
What have I learned, where have I been ?
From all I’ve heard, from all I’ve seen,
What know I more that’s worth the knowing,
What have I done that’s worth the doing,
What have I sought that I should shun,
What duty have I left undone,
Or into what new follies run ?
These self inquiries are the road
That lead to virtue and to God. ”
—Golden Verves of Pythagoras.
Volumes could not contain the noble truths and gracious senti-
ments to be found in the scriptures of Hindoos, Egyptians,
Chinese, Persians, Greeks, Romans, and other heathen nations,
written long ere the day when similar but neither finer nor-
purer teachings were enunciated in the “ Sermon on the
Mount.”
Confucius, Boudha, Chrishna, Osiris, Zoroaster, Pythagoras,
Plato, Socrates, the Great Saladin, the English Alfred ; many a
crusading hero, and many a turbaned infidel; Joan of Arc,
Savonarola, Pastor Oberlin, Theodore Parker, Swedenborg,
Martin Luther, Christopher Columbus, John Brown, and many
other such stars of goodness, wisdom, and truth, whose multi-
tude outnumbers the galaxy, and whose brightness outshines
the physical sun of earth, have all inscribed names on the
shining roll of immortality, not second in excellency, or infe-
rior in worth, to that adored as God by Christian worshippers.
Narrow-minded and narrow-souled bigots ! If Jesus had been


God, no man could have imitated him. Being man, how could
he be better than the good and true and pure of any age or any
land 1 And it is a libel alike on God’s work and man’s history
to affirm that there are not more truly good in the world than
truly bad; or that goodness and worth, when it attains its
acme, needs the idolatry of worshipping crowds to prove that it
is a constant concomitant of human history.
Christian. —Still again the question, though I tremble at the
blasphemy of propounding it. Who, then, would you say was the
Lord Jesus, and where would you place him!
Author. —He was either a personal or impersonal represen-
tative of the Essenes, appearing in Judea about the time when
the doctrine of that sect had taken deep root in many other
places, and eventually came to be preached there also. He
might have been the ideal man of the grand solar drama, which
the Essenes, in common with other mystics of the East, cherished
as their esoteric doctrine, whilst exoterically, they, like other
ancient religionists, taught to the people a pure and simple
system of theology and morals. At the same time it is possible
that he may have been a man, a truly good and pure man,
around whom his friends subsequently wove the famous solar
myth, writing just such a history as “ the Scriptures ” required,
for the fulfilment of the expected Avatar of that particular
cycular epoch. But even if he were a man, there is no evidence
■of such a personality save the four gospels, the authorship of
which has conclusively been denied by the best authority to
have belonged to any disciple of Jesus.
No contemporary historian makes any mention of such a
personage. The events said to have occurred at his trial and
death are neither found in Eoman or Jewish records, neither
in the writings of the officials, nor historians of the time. Yet


Philo, the learned historian of the Essenes, wrote of his
period without ever alluding to him. Josephus, the voluminous
historian of Herod and his times, makes no mention of him.
Early in the fourth century, indeed, the unscrupulous and
devoted partisan, Eusebius, claimed to have found a copy of
Josephus in which one single passage appears descriptive of
Christ and suggestive of his divine life and mission. It is
needless to remind the well-informed scholar that even the most
.zealous of modern historians, writing in the interests of Chris-
tianity, have been compelled to give up this one passage in the
one copy of Josephus, and acknowledge that it was an audacious
interpolation. No writer has more curtly or deliberately
condemned this forgery to the obscurity it cannot (unfortunately)
find, than Gibbon in his Decline and Fall, etc., when he throws
in a note admonishing his readers “ that the passage concerning
Jesus Christ was inserted into the text of Josephus between
the time of Origen and that of Eusebius, and may furnish us
with an example of no vulgar forgery. . . .” Philo,
writing at the very time when the miracles of Christ, if they
ever occurred, must have been known to him, makes no mention
of any such personage.
Tacitus, Pliny, Suetonius, Epictetus, and Plutarch (all learned
writers, born within the very century marked as that of Christ,
writing of his sect and country, and familiar with all the ch’-
cumstances of contemporaneous history), make no mention of
the personage, or only allude to the traditions current about
him’ as promulgated by Christians themselves. Where, then,
would you place your God, oh Christians, save with the gods of
other nations, and as the last hero of a legend which has been
the prophetic mantle thrown over the shoulders, now of in-
spired men, and now of impersonal myths, until the stern facts


of history and corroborative testimony alone can decide which
are the characters of actual fact, which of blind faith, and
which of deliberate fraud 1

CONCLUSION.
THE RELIGIONS OF THE PAST AND FUTURE.
On reviewing the preceding pages, every truly thoughtful reader-
must be prepared to consider the question, as to what conclu-
sion he can deliberately arrive at concerning their contents.
If they are false, the magnitude of the interests they assail, and
the supernal character of the subjects they deal with, render
such falsity an unpardonable crime against God and man.
But if, on the other hand, they are true, and prove their truth
by the unassailable character of the evidence upon which they
rest, is not the conclusion of every candid mind inevitable?
and can there be any appeal from such a conclusion % True, we
have left much of the story untold. We have not attempted
to unmask the tremendous frauds perpetrated during the first
centuries of Christianity, in reference to the Scriptures, and
other forms of testimony, imposed by Synods and Councils
upon a mystified but all too trusting world. We bear no-
record to the savage wars and cruel massacres, by which
Christian lands have decimated Christian communities, and


that oh. no other pretext, than the settlement of impossible
points of faith, or incomprehensible propositions in metaphysics.
We close our ears to the agonizing cries, whose echoes still
vibrate from torture chambers and blazing piles, where
Christians arc torn in pieces, or roasted alive, for the honour
and glory of other Christians’ gods.
We steel our hearts against the bitter moans and piteous
wails resounding through the loathsome dungeons of monastery
and inquisition, where many a hapless victim has died a
thousand deaths, in the unspeakable horrors of ecclesiastical
punishments. We cannot in this place number up the many
thousands that have been haled to shameful deaths because
they could not believe the baker’s bread and brewer’s wine,
dispensed by priestly hands, could become the flesh and blood
of a being whose very existence on earth was doubtful,
through the magical hocus pocus of ecclesiastical jugglery ; in
a word—the eighteen centuries’ record of what Christianity
has done, and said, cannot form a part of this little treatise.
Enough has been told, however, and enough written, to give
any intelligent reader an interior view of the Shekinah
wherein the true secrets of religious “ faiths, facts, and
frauds,” have been kept enshrined.
To any candid mind, the sum of all that remains of that
foundation upon which proud ecclesiasticism has uproared
its stupendous empire will be a foundered ship, tossing
on the wild and tempestuous billows of divided opinion, and
only waiting for the next lightning flash from the heaven of
knowledge and enlightenment to sink into the unresurrecting
abyss of oblivion—a ship with sails all rent, rudder gone,
compass lost, masts level with her parting planks; captain,
pilot, steersman, and crew all dead, or melting out into the
10


visionary realms of myth and allegory, from whence their
unreal forms were drawn. The world may ask—Can such a
wreck as this ensue from the mere withdrawal of the veil of
mystery that has so long enshrouded the hollow pretences of
ecclesiasticism 2
Even so. This is the breaking up of systems that have
stolon the sacred garb of religion to array their idols in.
The melting away of idle visions and vain superstitions,
baseless theories, and legendary myths, worked up into human
forms, with deifio attributes. A pageant meant at first to
dramatize the solemn march of nature, but ending with the
worship of the players. A farce constructed on the awful
name of God ; a tragedy of darkness, wrought out of cheerful
sunbeams; a melodrama, where men pretend to call each other
gods ; and mimic in their play, the tutelary angels of suns and
systems.
And yet, in the midst of all the mighty upheaval which
modern science, art, discovery, and reason are effecting in the
fantasies of theology, and the groundless assumptions of priest-
craft, let it never be supposed that either pen or voice can
mar with irreverent touch the sacred elements of true religion.
God lives and reigns, although the mythical forms of ten
thousand God-men should vanish into the airy realms of allegory
and imagination. The facts of immortality can never be dis-
proved, although the Avatars, on whom a superstitious faith
have built up their only proofs, resolve themselves into solar
fire, and their histories merge into sun and star beams. Good
and evil are stubborn facts, and sin is a stain on the soul of
man, which the conjurers of ecclesiastical “ rings ” can never
convert into good by spells and tricks. The truths of religion
were born before ecclesiasticism, and will survive its wreck.


The ruins of faiths men deplore do not affect the principle of
natural, heaven-horn, primordial religion ; and were every form
of faith now prevailing, blotted out from the earth one minute,
the next would see created man worshipping his creative
Father, God; following the beckoning hands of immortal
friends, with the confident assurance of their own immortality,
and listening to the pleadings of the importunate witness for
good and evil within them, conscience, with the acknowledg-
ment that they were responsible beings, and must create, by
their deeds here, their heaven or hell hereafter.
Religion is not shipwrecked in the downfall of ecclesiasticism.
On the contrary, it will rise up fairer, purer, more true to God
and nature, and more in harmony with the demands of life
and destiny, when the tree of idolatry is cut down, and God’s
imperishable Bible in creation is open for the study of his
creatures, unrestricted by the anathemas of priests, and the
mysticisms of man-made scriptures. And all the while, the
elements of true revelation are growing brighter and brighter,
and bringing conviction to the soul of man that there is a
veritable science in religion, the indestructible foundations of
which are laid in physical nature, the crowning glory of which
will culminate in spiritual existence. And all the while, and
all down the ages, come bright glimpses of higher worlds than
earth ; interventions of higher existences than earth’s ; spiritual
.sights, sounds, and revelations, which keep alive the glorious
assurance that we are not left to our own blind vision to
discover truth; not compelled to grope our way without
stronger guidance than our own; in short, that the invisible
things of the universe are but witnesses of a higher, grander,
and more permanent universe of invisible realities within, and
that when we arc ready for it, and the ground is cleared of the


superstitious rubbish that now encumbers it, we shall be
inspired to outwork the facts of a spiritual science, in which
all motions in the universe—past, present, and to come—shall
bo found acting together in purest harmony; in which the
immutable principles of Divine science shall not leave us any
longer at the mercy of every new form of faith or fraud that
man can devise ; in which God and angels, men and spirits, life
here and hereafter, eternal progress and supreme good, ever
triumphing over evil, shall all be unfolded, combined, and
linked together in the imperishable faiths and eternal facts
of the religion of the future.
